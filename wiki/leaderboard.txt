**[HERE IS THE LINK TO THE MAIN RATE WIKI PAGE](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-threads#wiki_rates)**

Welcome to the r/Popheads rate leaderboard! This page will be updated after every rate.

[HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ipkqcc/stats_from_every_song_rated_by_rpopheads_after/) is a snapshot of stats at the 100 rate milestone

[HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/lvi2x7/a_new_rate_songlist_search_tool_and_also_more_fun/) is a list of rare stats including leaderboard sweeps, early exits, and 0 wins/11 losses. (Done at 113 rates)

For those unaware, the subreddit performs 2-3 rates a month where we all come together and ~~endlessly bicker~~ send in scores to determine our general consensus/opinions on songs! A good overview on past rates and how to do it can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-threads#wiki_rates).

Shoutout to all the hosts that make things happen by running the rates, the rate committee for selecting / setting them up, the sub mods for getting everything in order, and the artists that make the rate playlist art (like /u/resisbythebatphone / Nick - if there are others let me know)! Also thanks to the other stat trackers /u/TragicKingdom1, /u/jackisboredtoday, /u/elizabethddos, /u/frogaranaman, and /u/RandomHypnotica (see sections on the page for specific inputs)! Not to mention the raters that make all of this possible!

**About the data:** 

Not included here is:

 * The bonus rate for the Up and Coming Rap Girls since the conditions for rating were different than normal (and it breaks basically every statistic). 
 * The Videography rate since it rated the videos, not the songs

Let u/TiltControls know if you spot any errors in the data or have any suggestions for additional charts.


#Full Songlist Data

**Here is a [link to the raw data/full songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/).** 

It is very useful if you want to find whether we have rated a song or artist (or how they did) but don't want to search through 100+ rates.

* Ctrl/Command + F is useful if you are looking for specific artists/songs
* Feel free to sort/filter the lists any way you see fit!
* Due to the headers, to determine a song's ranking just take 1 off the row number (ignoring ties)
* Some of the songs/rates are missing data (usually controversy or participant data). Due to this some of the aggregated stats might be slightly off (score-related stats should be all fine though)

#Rate Songlist Search Tool

**THE TOOL IS NOW ON VERSION 2.1 AS OF 2022-01-09**

###Lowest Scores

For almost 85 rates some random throwaway country song from 2012 managed to hold the top spot of this list which is... actually pretty impressive in its own right. For now **Earth - Lil Dicky** holds the top (bottom) score and if someone would suggest a more fitting songs I'd be very interested to find out what.

*Exception to Dancing On My Own and Get Outta My Way, the power couple of the Futuristic Flops rate, combined taking nearly two-thirds of the rate's 11's.

###Zero Magnets

In contrast, these songs helped keep 0’s in their rate from landing on actually decent songs. Again, no one has taken over 50% of the 0's in a rate, but at this point if Earth couldn't do it I don't think it's actually possible.

###Highest Low Score

This is for the highest low scores given during a rate. For example, How Will I Know didn't get a single score below 8.3 in its original rate.

|Rank|Song|Artist|Lowest Score|Rate|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|1|How Will I Know|Whitney Houston|8.3|She's So Unusual vs. Madonna vs. Forever Your Girl vs. Whitney Houston|

|6|Do I Wanna Know?|The Arctic Monkeys|7.5|The 1975 vs. AM vs. I Love You .vs. Modern Vampires of the City|

[In total, 29 songs](https://pastebin.com/KJ64aiUH) have hit a minimum score of 7.0

###Lowest High Score

So far this list is reserved to a single artist in a single rate. This is an album that was nominated for 2 Grammy awards too.

|Rank|Song|Artist|Highest Score|Rate|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|1|You Wrote the Book on Love|The Backstreet Boys|7.0|Oops!…I Did It Again vs. Christina Aguilera vs. No Strings Attached vs. Millennium|

|3|Spanish Eyes|The Backstreet Boys|7.8|Oops!…I Did It Again vs. Christina Aguilera vs. No Strings Attached vs. Millennium|

###Most Controversial Songs

Controversy is basically agreement on a song's score. High controversy means there was a lot of variation between the scores sent in. Low controversy means that the score was consistent across most ballots (whether that accepted score is high or low can vary!)

* We're missing the number of 11s from the first time we rated Toxic, so it's likely she would be higher

###Least Elevens

Right now **one** artist has no 11's

* Master P (0 elevens/6 songs)

Really Master P deserves an asterisk since his rated songs are just interludes he featured on that were unlikely to ever get an 11. Though to his benefit, he also gets to feature on the no 0's list.

### No 11's

I don't think anything will be here. I mean it's pretty difficult for us to rate an album and not have anyone enjoy at least one song off it enough for at least ONE person to 11 it. An album like that probably would've had to flop in the rate to an extraordinary, record-setting degree and - oh wait

**Albums**

- Drake - Views
