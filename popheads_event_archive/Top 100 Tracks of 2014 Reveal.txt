[13:50:40] Roxie: when i saw ed for the subtraction mini shows he was like 'all of my friends always send me memes about this song and im always like 'have you been under a rock because everyone was already making this joke in 2014''
[13:50:40] BleepBloopMusicFan: Photograph is really good tbh I could have voted for that
[13:50:46] emayzee: I was a huge ed sheeran stan for + and x but then my phone died while listening to divide the day it came out and just never revisited it
[13:50:47] impla: i see fire saur good omg
[13:50:55] akanewasright: like obviously his partner here is doing more work but that's kinda just partner work to some extent :shakey:
[13:51:02] bigbigbee: kinda need to give Castle On The Hill an 11
[13:51:04] Roxie: divide is actually the ed album i go hardest for which is really embaressing
[13:51:15] Roxie: i loved + and x i actually only had heard half of for years
[13:51:25] TiltControls: divide's got a couple killer album cuts
[13:51:35] bigbigbee: on divide I really love Barcelona lol
[13:51:43] bigbigbee: and on Plus my favorite song is Give Me Love
[13:51:44] TiltControls: I think  + is probably the strongest consistently imo
[13:51:46] bigbigbee: i LOOOOOOOOVE that song
[13:51:47] akanewasright: thinking about how i fully thought galway girl was an album cut
[13:51:49] Roxie: divide i bought in 10 grade and then became the only album i had on itunes because my other music got errased and so i would just listen to it every day in 10 grade and be depressed
[13:51:50] Jules: oop that's like the one song I totally don't care for
[13:51:50] TiltControls: yesss so true on give me love
[13:51:53] emayzee: I remember liking dive off that album

[13:52:17] impla: and drunk
[13:52:18] Roxie: i have a feeling its one of mine sdlfkhfds
[13:52:22] pig-serpent: My sister was right about that one
[13:52:22] jirachi: and shape of you the icon
[13:52:24] emayzee: grade 8 too omg
[13:52:37] impla: ed sheeran so real and valid actually
[13:52:42] Roxie: give me love live was an amazing experience
[13:52:47] Roxie: people died (me)
[13:52:49] pbklol: love live omg
[13:52:51] pig-serpent: I do not like his approach to electronic music but his acoustic stuff is nice
[13:52:55] Roxie: he made quaters of the arena do the vocal round
[13:52:55] jirachi: i might have given ed sheeran two 1s in year end but he's cool
[13:52:58] Roxie: it was beautiful
[13:53:06] pig-serpent: Snow Halation was 2013 right?  Or later?
[13:53:08] emayzee: I remember my first day of 9th grade when + was new thinking I was so indie and different when I said he was my fav artist in an icebreaker activity

[14:47:08] lilb-basedgawd: is it weird to call Shakira underrated? Like, she's extremely popular, but I feel like she doesn't get *enough* credit for how good of a musician she is

[14:48:39] Roxie: shakira is so pretty
[14:48:46] seanderlust: she has some lyrical clunkers (like a coffee machine in an office sometimes does) but some of her lyrics are very poetic and gorgeous
[14:48:46] lilb-basedgawd: Let's see if there's a song I hate more than Animals
[14:48:47] ignitephoenix: yeah like i know her music very casually but I know her fans always talk about her songwriting
[14:48:54] lilb-basedgawd: can't believe animals made it on, my god
[14:48:57] seanderlust: especially in spanish - dia de enero is one of my favorite love songs of all time

[14:51:56] lilb-basedgawd: This and Rather Be both felt like breaths of fresh air in 2014
[14:51:57] Jules: can I say there were a few other indie women I would've loved to have in this one's place but I do also like this
[14:52:45] bigbigbee: &gt;  enough attention for her to be booked for the random Jingle Ball concert I attended in December 2014, but not enough that I ever learned a single detail about her personal life
[14:52:46] seanderlust: good writeup tk
[14:52:49] emayzee: ppl in 2014 music videos loved dressing like it was 1990

[15:02:34] TiltControls: (in a good way)
[15:02:43] ignitephoenix: this was on my list
[15:02:44] bigbigbee: &gt; And if Take Me To Church was Hozier's look at the devotion to religion over love then Work Song is the opposite; a loving, voluntary commitment to another over all else.
why i'm kinda emotional.......

[15:25:19] gucci6629: i bring up this anecdote whenever we play lana i think but my mum is a big billie eilish stan so i naturally bought her the ultraviolence CD to listen to and she listened to half of it and was like "my god this girl is so depressing"

[15:26:02] bigbigbee: did mitski slaughter this rate or was it even
[15:26:15] TiltControls: mitski did some slight slaughter
[15:26:19] pbklol: time for something completely different! in fact if youre not a sub regular you prob do not know it!
[15:26:19] akanewasright: ybag was like
[15:26:20] Jules: This is like the opposite of when I gave my mom the Hounds of Love cd and she went "The second half was quite experimental... but it was great! I need more music like that"
[15:26:22] akanewasright: a VERY dominant winner
[15:26:23] bigbigbee: a bit of slighter
[15:26:24] TiltControls: i think only lost her first at the very end of day 1
[15:26:27] jirachi: LAZERPOP
[15:26:28] jirachi: OMG
[15:26:30] TiltControls: then yeah completely swept the 1st place spot
[15:26:34] SteelStepladder: I'm not ready for when I begrudgingly 11 A&amp;W later this year

[15:43:57] bran: this should've been her espresso
[15:44:01] Jules: What is prediction for a song with 11 votes?
[15:44:01] BleepBloopMusicFan: It is truly something that exists
[15:44:11] Roxie: i wanna watch the reveal but i have a strong urge to read a book rn,,,, what will win
[15:44:15] TakeOnMeByA-ha: oh we're not even out of the 11 votes yet sob
[15:44:17] akanewasright: remembering when tove lo came in first and last place with the same song (bc the remix of habits was in)
[15:44:18] jirachi: @bran her espresso was stay high
[15:44:21] bogo: roxie what book
[15:44:26] Jules: We're actually not even out of the 10 kurp
[15:44:33] bogo: is the remix of habits actually that bad
[15:44:34] Roxie: idk there are at least 17 books in a basket behind me
[15:44:38] bigbigbee: the remix of habits is SOOOOOOO ASSSSSSS to me
[15:44:39] pbklol: habits remix kinda awful
[15:44:39] bran: you can read any day
[15:44:39] Jules: the next song will be 11
[15:44:40] jirachi: @bogo kinda
[15:44:42] akanewasright: i do not care for habits [2]
[15:44:43] impla: real roxie
[15:44:44] bigbigbee: it takes out all the stuff that makes the song work
[15:44:45] Jules: wait im
[15:44:45] akanewasright: *habits remix
[15:44:49] akanewasright: the original habits was my 11
[15:44:54] bigbigbee: and makes her chipmunky
[15:44:54] pbklol: the original habits would win if it was eligible
[15:44:57] Jules: the habits remix is the only good version of the song
[15:44:57] Roxie: i dont think i heard habits while it was big at all
[15:45:06] bogo: if i was around for that rate my 11 would probably be figure 8
[15:45:11] bigbigbee: i LOVe figure 8
[15:45:12] bogo: that's the right ellie album right
[15:45:12] akanewasright: taste tbh
[15:45:14] akanewasright: yeah
[15:45:17] Roxie: now talking body? that was the 'walking into world history class' smasha
[15:45:18] pbklol: is habits a rate winner i forgor
[15:45:21] TakeOnMeByA-ha: yes
[15:45:21] Roxie: yeah
[15:45:22] bogo: yes
[15:45:24] TMB: yes
[15:45:24] pbklol: as it should be
[15:45:33] jirachi: habits remix had the ow ows which were the best parts in the original anyways so
[15:45:38] bran: the remix is better 3
[15:45:40] TakeOnMeByA-ha: not only did it win the rate but it got like a stupidly high average too
[15:45:41] Jules: sorry the original habits is just so boring
[15:45:42] akanewasright: that rate was like designed for my middle school self... like regretably i also loved 1000 forms of fear
[15:45:45] TakeOnMeByA-ha: like a 9.7something i think
[15:45:46] ImADudeDuh: and it'll be another rate winner in 2014 year end
[15:45:55] bigbigbee: https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1dxhlea/the_top_100_tracks_of_2014_according_to_rpopheads/
[15:46:03] bigbigbee: link for those who don't have it for those who wanna keep reading writeups
[15:46:05] TMB: @ImADudeDuh people decided to come out as habit haters
[15:46:05] lilb-basedgawd: @akanewasright that reminds me. I'm genuinely curious how much Sia is on this list, if at all
[15:46:06] bogo: i kinda really don't want a repeat winner in 2014 year end :sob:
[15:46:08] akanewasright: people liking the remix is crazy to me bc like... the storytelling... the mental breakdownery
[15:46:19] halz: hello
[15:46:19] jirachi: it's a different vibe tbh
[15:46:19] lilb-basedgawd: Chandelier is still a good song but it can't be denied her rep's taken a hard beating
[15:46:21] Roxie: i mean there are only 3 options
[15:46:22] jirachi: hi hals
[15:46:23] Roxie: hi hals
[15:46:26] bigbigbee: hey hals!
[15:46:28] impla: partition is 99 percent the winner i fear
[15:46:30] akanewasright: @lilb-basedgawd i hope she's not bc :shakey: but i'd get it if chandelier shows up
[15:46:30] bogo: hi hals!
[15:46:33] pbklol: hals omg!!!
[15:46:33] halz: hiiii my loves
[15:46:35] pbklol: hi queen
[15:46:38] Jules: I don't think having a mental breakdown is good actually
[15:46:39] Roxie: i still think even if we get a repeat winner we should just rate it again idk
[15:46:40] BleepBloopMusicFan: Hi Halz!
[15:46:45] halz: &lt;3
[15:46:46] TakeOnMeByA-ha: not if everyone lowers their paritition scores to a 9 instead of a 10
[15:46:46] Roxie: it would be funny to see the difference
[15:46:47] bogo: god partition is so good but it's probably THE rate villain
[15:46:50] halz: happy 2014
[15:46:50] jirachi: is elastic heart eligible
[15:46:53] flava: habits made me lie face down in my bed for about an hour, i dont think i ever heard the remix
[15:47:01] akanewasright: @TakeOnMeByA-ha why the fuck would anyone do that...
[15:47:06] pbklol: next up an artist who was in the honorable mentions! azealia banks its your time :mischief:
[15:47:09] Jules: I support just being in a club for a fun time

[15:48:49] Jules: their best song remains dancing with a stranger
[15:48:52] akanewasright: i really do like lay me down, if only bc i have a nice memory of a friend slaying it
[15:48:59] flava: dancing with a stranger a massive bop
[15:49:03] Roxie: how do you sleep is not bad but unfortunately i heard it on the radio too much
[15:49:04] akanewasright: dwas so good
[15:49:09] Roxie: its also not the best song with that title i've heard i fear
[15:49:09] SteelStepladder: Latch forever their best
[15:49:14] bogo: how do you sleep and dancing with a stranger both ate
[15:49:14] lilb-basedgawd: "Dancing with a Stranger" and "Latch" are hood classics
[15:49:15] akanewasright: how do you sleep i keep thinking about how zayn almost had it
[15:49:17] BleepBloopMusicFan: I wish I heard it on the radio more tbh
[15:49:19] Roxie: oh wow
[15:49:21] jirachi: actually im way too good at goodbyes is good too
[15:49:21] flava: i need that sam back, send unholy sam to hell
[15:49:27] akanewasright: and i like zayn's voice more but the video defines the song for me and he woudl never
[15:49:28] lilb-basedgawd: Latch made me expect more interesting stuff from Smith's career as a whole tho
[15:49:28] bogo: how do you sleep deserved to be a top 10 hit
[15:49:35] Jules: normani and sam have this strange not real chemistry but it truly feels like people who know each other well and just kinda hate each other but there's also love
[15:49:35] Roxie: YOU SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY IM CRAAAAAZY
[15:49:37] BleepBloopMusicFan: Diamonds is a bop too

[15:49:58] jirachi: I KNOW I AM NOT THE ONNLY ONEEE
[15:50:03] akanewasright: i like unholy [2]
[15:50:05] WesternWind: Wait Jules spill
[15:50:05] impla: what was the collab with calvin harris? was it diamonds or smth else
[15:50:08] Jules: I love that stupid kim petras verse
[15:50:11] ImADudeDuh: Promises
[15:50:12] WesternWind: For dancing with a stranger
[15:50:13] emayzee: [3]
[15:50:16] ImADudeDuh: Promises is THEEEEE vogue bop
[15:50:16] halz: i liked unholy before it was overplayed
[15:50:18] impla: promises good as well
[15:50:21] TakeOnMeByA-ha: oh this actually sounds a lot better when its not the shity techno remix that my work plays constantly
[15:50:24] ricki: does latch count in this discussion
[15:50:28] Roxie: it should
[15:50:31] ricki: bc i think that's sam's best song if so
[15:50:31] akanewasright: this is a good song but i always feel weird whenever i watch music videos for queer people where they like
[15:50:34] jirachi: but.
[15:50:34] bigbigbee: latch their best if it counts
[15:50:36] jirachi: whennnnnnnnnnn
[15:50:37] akanewasright: have other actors do the main plotline
[15:50:41] akanewasright: and its straight ppl
[15:50:49] bogo: honestly i don't care for a lot of sam's music but there aren't any songs by them that i flat out can't stand. honestly even unholy is fun it just desperately needed to be longer
[15:50:51] lilb-basedgawd: "Unholy" was lowkey a historical moment---a chart topper from a nonbinary artist and a transwoman?
[15:50:52] impla: straight people are valid too
[15:50:52] Roxie: were they out at this point /gen?
[15:50:58] akanewasright: like its allowed, do your art your way, but also i know sam didnt come out immediately and it feels weirdly like
[15:50:58] lilb-basedgawd: It's wild to me that no one really cared
[15:51:00] bigbigbee: I THINK so........
[15:51:01] bigbigbee: oh
[15:51:01] emayzee: yes Sam was out
[15:51:02] impla: i think they were always out??
[15:51:03] lilb-basedgawd: because the song was just ehhh
[15:51:03] akanewasright: idk it feels like "label closet"
[15:51:13] flava: when i was making a playlist for 2014 year end rate, i got to stay with me on the year end list, and added this to the playlist cause i thought sure this would be in it, spent like 10 minutes wondering why i had 101 songs in my playlist instead of 100
[15:51:13] akanewasright: i feel like sam came out midway through this era
[15:51:20] Jules: OU daddy daddy if you want it drop the addy my balenciaga daddy in your zaddy im a baddy in the triple cover maddy
[15:51:22] Jules: best verse ever
[15:51:25] BleepBloopMusicFan: They just wanted to have Diana slay in their MV
[15:51:32] bran: I thought they came out after
[15:51:34] impla: true!!
[15:51:44] flava: i thought they came out before
[15:51:44] akanewasright: but even if they were out my point still stands bc like.. idk, trying to "tamp down" queerness in music videos is something ive thought about a bit
[15:51:45] jirachi: this wouldve been my 11 in year end
[15:51:57] bogo: wait are we talking about coming out as gay or coming out as nb
[15:52:01] halz: while i do like this song, i think it could be like a min shorter oop
[15:52:03] ImADudeDuh: @flava i once did that with every #1 song from the 2000s but i added two Savage Garden songs but only one hit #1
[15:52:03] bigbigbee: yeah agree akane
[15:52:04] impla: gay
[15:52:05] bran: gay
[15:52:05] WesternWind: Gay prob
[15:52:11] babadork: is that the guy from mindy project?
[15:52:16] akanewasright: ok i looked it up
[15:52:16] emayzee: nb was years later probably 2020ish
[15:52:20] lilb-basedgawd: remember their oscar speech for the bond theme
[15:52:23] akanewasright: sam came out like a montha fter stay with me dropped
[15:52:25] akanewasright: like on stage
[15:52:25] jirachi: i thought they came out in 2017

[15:54:42] SteelStepladder: This song is so pretty
[15:54:44] akanewasright: caution is v good and is a decent entry point
[15:54:44] bigbigbee: i could write essays about how a vocaloid closed Porter's first album but how the closer for nurture is his own voice......
[15:54:47] impla: okkkk glados vocals
[15:54:50] BleepBloopMusicFan: I'll continue that discog dive soon...
[15:54:50] bran: actually yeah I think its from tiktok
[15:55:23] jirachi: sad machine being his highest song maybe popheads do have taste
[15:55:39] Jules: Caution is a great album
[15:55:39] jirachi: well if he still has one song in...
[15:55:49] akanewasright: like caution's rollout was what got me to listen to deep dive mariah
[15:56:05] Jules: though tbh I like almost every mariah album
[15:56:06] starlit: it could be sea of voices but i doubt sad machine didn't make it
[15:56:08] bogo: i've heard a no no which is a slay
[15:56:10] lilb-basedgawd: this vid is kinda eating
[15:56:26] jirachi: this is the pussy of the song
[15:56:35] bogo: a no no kinda feels like one of the least discussed rate winners to me but it's great
[15:56:39] Jules: haters will tell you music box is boring but I disagree!!!
[15:56:42] akanewasright: caution is very much "this is what she's always done well songwriting wise, but its all in one concise package," which is why i think its a good entry point
[15:56:44] Jules: I mean it is boring but a good boring
[15:56:57] akanewasright: music box has now that i know, it's not that boring!
[15:57:12] akanewasright: help

[16:17:16] flava: this should have a mv
[16:17:17] Roxie: i have been very broke this year and this song has been speaking to me in a spiratual level
[16:17:22] akanewasright: shakey
[16:17:23] pbklol: it has a music video but this has more views and the mv is like a minute longer

[16:17:56] akanewasright: in a complimentary way! like there's a lot of lightheartedness there
[16:18:00] Jules: Not to ignore pitbull but I really feel like people really ignore destiny's child impact when talking about beyoncé and it's like... no they were already really big but then beyoncé became ever bigger
[16:18:08] Roxie: honestly
[16:18:15] Roxie: i say that like i was there
[16:18:17] lilb-basedgawd: Kelly Rowland got a number one before Beyonce, too

[16:18:20] lilb-basedgawd: dilemma was huge
[16:18:20] bogo: the way one of the radio stations i listen to is trying to push another pitbull and ne-yo collab that recently dropped
[16:18:39] starlit: @bogo valid we NEED mr. worldwide back on the radio
[16:18:44] bogo: independent woman was #1 for like 11 weeks
[16:18:46] akanewasright: but yeah the verses of say my name arguably changed music
[16:18:49] lilb-basedgawd: y'all watch Mic the Snare's Pitbull deep dive
[16:18:50] starlit: world went to hell after this was pitbull's last hit
[16:18:55] lilb-basedgawd: i don't know why it exists. but good vid
[16:18:58] babadork: Spotify was telling me how much i love ne-yo today (based on nothing as far as i can remember), but maybe they knew i'd be bopping to this
[16:19:02] Jules: Dilemma is also so great
[16:19:04] pbklol: i keep thinking of shitposts im not sorry
[16:19:10] pbklol: the minute we lost from the pitbull mv died for this
[16:19:16] akanewasright: shakey

[16:19:23] Jules: the impact of dilemma on kpop cannot be overstated
[16:19:26] akanewasright: gowestyoungkanye the prophet you were

[17:22:18] akanewasright: calvin's fourth appearance omgggg
[17:22:32] bigbigbee: &gt;  Rita Ora of Detective Pikachu fame

[17:22:36] pbklol: glkafjglksj
[17:22:42] pbklol: ok but phoenix highkey amazing album
[17:22:48] akanewasright: i love hikk so much [2]
[17:22:57] akanewasright: phoenix good!
[17:22:57] crimsonroset: rita ora's detective pikachu genuinely a top5 popheads moment
[17:23:10] Roxie: does this sample something
[17:23:19] camerinian: don't think so?
[17:23:21] pig-serpent: Ok I was skeptical but this bops
[17:23:29] TMB: pretty sure it's just written and produced by calvin
[17:23:31] Roxie: okay i need to figure out what this reminds me of
[17:23:32] akanewasright: rita is a genuinely good singer she just needs to harness that on songs that match her
[17:23:37] Roxie: its driving me a little insane
[17:23:46] bigbigbee: i'm so sad hikk is busy today
[17:24:00] pbklol: kinda needed his reaction to this
[17:24:02] bigbigbee: roxie is it waves
[17:24:09] bigbigbee: the beat reminds me a LITTLE of that song
[17:24:20] Roxie: waves by who
[17:24:21] Roxie: lemme check
[17:24:25] jirachi: is this from the album where she threatened to release with 100k likes
[17:24:31] WesternWind: Pls
[17:24:34] akanewasright: like phoenix has great fucking production, like "let you love me" was one of the first big (in the UK) pop songs produced by a PC music alum and it fucks
[17:24:36] bigbigbee: mr probz - waves robin schulz remix i think
[17:24:39] Jules: This is an insane comparison but this this song reminds me a little of It's Time by Imagine Dragons
[17:24:45] WesternWind: Also jirachi can’t believe u rejected the song I wrote for….
[17:24:49] bigbigbee: i think they may have similar chords jules
[17:25:00] Roxie: okay i checked and its not that
[17:25:08] TMB: she singing the fuck out the "Oh uhOHs"
[17:25:11] Roxie: i think whatver its reminding me is slightly slower
[17:25:12] akanewasright: this song kinda should be rita feat calvin bc the synth feels like a featured vocalist
[17:25:13] pbklol: remember when i said this 3 song lineup was really funny. lol
[17:25:16] ricki: this reminds me of american girl
[17:25:22] ricki: woooahh i was raised by a television
[17:25:25] ricki: everyday is a competition
[17:25:28] Roxie: the only way i can describe it is that 'its also purple' but i know that means nothing

[17:33:35] akanewasright: the third album being the one ive heard
[17:33:35] camerinian: it still fucks maybe i should have put this in
[17:33:50] Nagisoid: i think all of the pinkprint was eligible iirc

[17:34:40] akanewasright: do i just like it bc i like the colors and think she looks good? maybe, but
[17:34:54] Jules: also this is how I find out apparently pills n potions was the lead for the pinkprint?
[17:34:58] Jules: Who approved that decision
[17:35:23] akanewasright: noitssad
[17:35:40] lilb-basedgawd: 2010s nostalgia in the 2030s is gonna be weird
[17:35:55] pbklol: next one's writeup is incredible
[17:36:04] akanewasright: the pinkprint rollout kinda confusing, bc i think they put pills n potions out to be like "she's mature now" but its fully a dr luke produced pop song with a sung chrous
[17:36:32] akanewasright: and then they put out anaconda, which was obviously massive but also undid that messaging fdjlkasj
[17:36:44] pbklol: idk how to hint at this one
[17:36:52] Jules: also like who really wanted nicki to be like super mature
[17:36:57] pbklol: umm hey speaking of the **pink**print
[17:36:58] akanewasright: tbh
[17:37:04] Jules: w/e this is too much talk about this rollout

[17:46:22] Jules: prince johnny is so great omfg
[17:46:25] camerinian: sad we're probably only getting the one trackbut
[17:46:30] gucci6629: ofc jules gets it...
[17:46:33] Jules: YOURE KIND BUT YOURE NOT SIMPLE
[17:46:47] bogo: i like st. vincent's most recent album but i've never been able to get into her older music
[17:46:51] ricki: knock yourself out xd amaze it made me start appreciating porter a lot more than i had before kii
[17:46:54] lilb-basedgawd: ...i think my favorite st vincent is New York
[17:46:58] akanewasright: the masseduction album was my intro to st vincent so i was shocked to learn that she was a well respected rock musician and not a new up and coming pop star discovered by jack antonoff
[17:47:01] lilb-basedgawd: when it came out i just listened to it on repeat
[17:47:04] Jules: New York so good too
[17:47:06] lilb-basedgawd: I dunno why. It scratches an itch
[17:47:08] bigbigbee: My favorite St Vincent is this song but i also LOVE Cruel
[17:47:10] akanewasright: wait youre so right ricki
[17:47:10] SteelStepladder: Yeah when I fist heard this album it was a real "what is this... I love it" moment for me
[17:47:13] lilb-basedgawd: oh yeah, Cruel
[17:47:19] gucci6629: cruel is also a banger
[17:47:27] camerinian: bogo i do feel u, the other singles do give "probably lift heavily in the album context" more than cheerleader does
[17:47:30] akanewasright: cruel maybe the most st vincent st vincent song in my mind
[17:47:36] bigbigbee: or they might not, which is OK
[17:47:43] Jules: I do think my fave st vincent song is pay your way in pain which is funny cause that album sucks
[17:47:44] bigbigbee: i don't think it's deniable that porter's new stuff sounds different
[17:47:47] bigbigbee: I like it but it's not for everyone
[17:48:04] bigbigbee: i'm still gonna ride hard for it tho EOY HAHAHHAHAHA
[17:48:15] Roxie: already we're at 31,,,, heres how no control can still win
[17:48:17] lilb-basedgawd: I wish her teaming up with Sleater Kinney went better
[17:48:18] pbklol: i did the next writeup :3 im trying to think of a hint for it but its just too...
[17:48:21] akanewasright: so true roxie
[17:48:26] bogo: i remember masseduction being talked about as like a hyped up pop breakthrough and was shocked when i eventually learned that st. vincent was an already acclaimed indie pop artist and that masseduction was actually considered a pretty big disappointment

[17:52:25] lilb-basedgawd: first time i misheard the opening line as "first things first, i'm a realist"
[17:52:29] lilb-basedgawd: that sounds harder, right?
[17:52:31] seanderlust: the beat is very dj mustard-coded
[17:52:33] bigbigbee: bogo is right charli MAKES this song
[17:52:33] Roxie: to be fair i've never watched the video and i watched clueless for the first time like 3 months ago

[17:53:50] bogo: why do i think doja cat could eat this up
[17:53:57] kappyko: @Jules wildest dreams????
[17:53:58] ricki: you can try to rewrite history charli, but we know when you were a real brat
[17:53:59] camerinian: but charli and icona pop blend together so hard there it's impossible to tell who's who
[17:54:06] camerinian: this is pure, distilled charli
[17:54:11] Roxie: i love it so good
[17:54:16] akanewasright: i love it magic [2]

[17:54:43] kappyko: real charli xcx fans remember her iconic like a g6 cover
[17:54:44] bigbigbee: the 2014 styling fits her like a glove
[17:54:50] pbklol: charli era charli will always be charli to me
[17:54:51] Jules: that is true
[17:54:52] Jules: the curls

[17:56:23] lilb-basedgawd: look. look. i get it. A Rush of Blood To The Head era Chris Martin?
[17:56:26] bogo: chris martin kinda just looks like a man to me
[17:56:31] Jules: you know when chris martin looked hot? In the viva la vida mv
[17:56:42] bogo: he just looks normal
[17:56:44] camerinian: love that they all have these elaborate kit setups and you can't hear a single instrument in the mix lmao
[17:56:59] pbklol: chris martin seems like a guy who'd be like weirdly into DMT
[17:57:04] camerinian: adf;jkadsfsdaf
[17:57:04] kappyko: i dont think chris martin necessarily is hot but anyone wearing a goofy one man band contraption becomes hotter
[17:57:07] Jules: what is dmt
[17:57:12] pbklol: its a hallucinogenic
[17:57:12] lilb-basedgawd: i actually like their song with The Chainsmokers because you can hear a guitar in it
[17:57:15] lilb-basedgawd: y'all remember guitars
[17:57:25] gucci6629: i could go to bristol rn and immediately find 10 men that look like chris martin
[17:57:30] kappyko: theres a guitar in the video right now!
[17:57:33] akanewasright: chris martin seems like he'd probably be a nice guy
[17:57:33] kappyko: guitars!
[17:57:41] Jules: Who Needs Guitars Anyway
[17:57:42] bogo: chris martin seems really nice [2]
[17:57:46] TMB: i think something that detracts from chris martin is you can easily call him piss fartin
[17:57:46] akanewasright: like deeply corny in a way that's endeering
[17:57:47] Roxie: i feel like he knows alot of people
[17:57:48] gucci6629: with that being said, i like coldplay because they just seem to do their own thing and vibe
[17:57:57] Roxie: like his contacts list goes crazy
[17:58:02] kappyko: no i think chris martin wakes up and thinks of how to make everyone's day worse
[17:58:02] bogo: chris martin is randomly good friends with beyonce [2]
[17:58:05] kappyko: and is very mean
[17:58:13] Roxie: did this song end one of the sing movies
[17:58:15] starlit: @bogo he also did a song with beyonce so
[17:58:17] Jules: Coldplay is a lot of fun but that last album sucked so much im sorry
[17:58:18] lilb-basedgawd: Colplay from 2000 to like 2005 deserves more credit
[17:58:24] kappyko: this album so good mind
[17:58:31] gucci6629: anyway the next song on the list is muchhhh more fun
[17:58:33] lilb-basedgawd: I do love Adventure of a Lifetime
[17:58:35] camerinian: i've heard this song a weirdly high amount in the past two weeks purely cos stars are a big part of nz's most recent public holiday
[17:58:39] kappyko: ink went platinum on the kappyboard charts
[17:58:45] pbklol: next song i need everyone to be extremely normal. just for 4 minutes please dont burn us down
[17:58:48] bogo: the last coldplay album had good singles but the album itself was. not
[17:58:50] Jules: The next song is kinda like a good version of this song if you think about it

[18:05:08] Roxie: do we think uptown funk makes it
[18:05:12] crimsonroset: i hope so
[18:05:14] impla: i voted
[18:05:15] Roxie: i kinda thought it would be lower
[18:05:18] camerinian: i think it can yeah
[18:05:18] BleepBloopMusicFan: I guess it took a while to become a hit
[18:05:22] lilb-basedgawd: we stan a king that runs a successful small black-owned business with his girl
[18:05:28] apatel27: uptown funk should be top 10
[18:05:32] bogo: fetty wap the artist of 2015 and exclusively 2015
[18:05:36] ignitephoenix: i don't think uptown funk makes it because people forgot it was 2014
[18:05:39] impla: its one of the most iconic songs of the 2010s
[18:05:39] bogo: like. where did he go after that
[18:05:43] akanewasright: i remember listening to this song after seeing it discussed in an article and being like "wait this sounds like musical candy"
[18:05:43] Roxie: same yetti
[18:05:44] ignitephoenix: but i put it on my list
[18:06:05] Roxie: i dont think people would remember but i feel like if they did it wouldve been lower 70s
[18:06:08] lilb-basedgawd: Im calling Uptown Funk makes it to top 10 or 15. i have faith
[18:06:15] Jules: This is such a good song gawd
[18:06:20] ignitephoenix: who here put it on their list tho
[18:06:21] impla: im sure it must be in roxie
[18:06:24] crimsonroset: all of this could have been avoided if i had won a ratlympics game
[18:06:25] impla: me
[18:06:25] Roxie: i think i put it
[18:06:27] lilb-basedgawd: me
[18:06:31] akanewasright: i feel like uptown funk could do well bc i did see. highly upvoted comments promoting it
[18:06:31] lilb-basedgawd: iirc the top comment mentioned it
[18:06:45] ignitephoenix: okay nm it did make top 20 probably
[18:06:46] camerinian: if ed sheeran can make top 40 like
[18:06:47] camerinian: anything is possible
[18:06:48] Roxie: i think i rushed to get a comment in early to mention that and I sdflkhdsfkl
[18:06:49] impla: yeah i put it in bc the comment mentioned it
[18:07:01] lilb-basedgawd: i agree that it and this both defined 2015 even tho they came out in 2014. pop music id weird
[18:07:02] akanewasright: but also every year there's one song that we all assume is gonna be on the list and we clown that its gonna be there until the top 10 and then we realize its not on the list
[18:07:02] Jules: oh who are these men

[18:15:15] seanderlust: oh hell yes
[18:15:19] bogo: help
[18:15:20] bigbigbee: king had a lot of fun with this writeup
[18:15:22] Jules: I just say always
[18:15:22] TMB: sophia grace - best friend mashup of this goes crazy
[18:15:22] bigbigbee: &gt; It also had a remix with Iggy Azalea. Yeah. It's fine.
[18:15:38] pbklol: this also means that impla has our final user submitted writeup
[18:15:39] nonchalantthoughts: godshe don't end the other girls like this
[18:15:44] akanewasright: lemme actually save the kendrick tinashe thing .... for the future
[18:15:45] ignitephoenix: why are all her videos dancing in industrial settings
[18:15:45] impla: oprah,!
[18:15:55] impla: i feel like i won then idk
[18:15:56] Jules: Oh wait
[18:16:00] Roxie: @ignitephoenix she was inpsired by the work from home video
[18:16:01] lilb-basedgawd: @ignitephoenix we stan a queen aligned with the working man
[18:16:09] ignitephoenix: kgndfgk
[18:16:16] ignitephoenix: two good answers
[18:16:21] bigbigbee: god she looks so YOUNG here
[18:16:23] akanewasright: @ignitephoenix i mean tbh i think tinashe is at her most "pop star charismatic" when she can just dance her ass off and own it, so like...
[18:16:24] nonchalantthoughts: @Roxie no she was the blueprint for 5H!
[18:16:27] Jules: one of my top 20 writeups has a guest feature
[18:16:31] Roxie: you're so right
[18:16:32] pbklol: oh yeah true
[18:16:47] gucci6629: i love the flute here
[18:16:47] pbklol: impla the last solo writeup sob
[18:16:49] Roxie: its not the point but i keep being like 'girl what if those shipping containers fall'
[18:16:52] Jules: whatever that person can share the crown with impla
[18:16:57] akanewasright: thinking about how bebe rexha wrote this song
[18:17:02] gucci6629: she did????
[18:17:02] bogo: were all of the top 20 writeups written by the hosts
[18:17:02] impla: i will still take that
[18:17:09] pbklol: also funny story impla asked for 1 artist and 1 artist only and thats how we ended up here
[18:17:14] impla: gtuyuggyuf
[18:17:24] nonchalantthoughts: tinashe could write (and make it good) i luv it, but camilla cabello could not make nasty!
[18:17:25] akanewasright: like bebe has a demo and the only part added in the tinashe version was the bridge.... and also she made the chorus lyrics better but
[18:17:27] gucci6629: @bogo 21, yes
[18:17:28] Roxie: trying to imagine how impla could be writing for no control
[18:17:31] impla: im a choosy bitch
[18:17:38] akanewasright: like it used to be "two in the front three in the back" and i think tinashe made a good call there
[18:17:39] lilb-basedgawd: Girls soundtracking-core is a good-ass descriptor
[18:17:40] impla: thats winning tho roxiw
[18:17:45] lilb-basedgawd: I wonder how well that show's aged
[18:17:54] Roxie: true,,
[18:18:11] akanewasright: thinking about how i was heartbroken in 2019 and decided this bridge was like. my lifeblood
[18:18:12] Roxie: i think i will be missing the top 20 to get my hair done
[18:18:14] Roxie: but we will see
[18:18:22] pbklol: aw man

[18:18:43] Roxie: i dont have any blonde left
[18:18:48] Roxie: i have red though
[18:18:52] akanewasright: cryign at the idea of tinashe's label budget being used to rent construction sites
[18:18:53] pbklol: next song a former 11 of mine
[18:18:54] crimsonroset: kirishima slay

[18:19:35] pbklol: also implas writeup is amaze
[18:19:38] ignitephoenix: yeah we are at 3 mitski alreayd
[18:19:43] pbklol: @lilb-basedgawd this is her 3rd song which is the limit
[18:19:48] pbklol: so yea no more mitski sadge
[18:19:51] akanewasright: i was reading bmamc reviews from the time and like
[18:19:56] bigbigbee: oh my god speaking of babies
[18:19:58] bigbigbee: she looks baby here
[18:20:07] gucci6629: fr
[18:20:08] akanewasright: seeing ppl compare the melody to a 60s girlgroup song was crazy but also it made me like the song more
[18:20:15] pbklol: thats wild
[18:20:27] lilb-basedgawd: the writeup - I know want to watch a milhouse edit set to this song
[18:20:30] lilb-basedgawd: "the dud"
[18:20:34] lilb-basedgawd: *now
[18:20:46] BleepBloopMusicFan: I could see that comparison
[18:20:48] impla: we need the amv
[18:20:59] BleepBloopMusicFan: It kinda has that vibe a little.
[18:21:09] bogo: i wish this song won on indieheads
[18:21:11] akanewasright: damn those subtitles
[18:21:15] pbklol: it deserved the win
[18:21:19] bogo: townie slays but this song is just amazing
[18:21:22] akanewasright: i prefer puberty 2 to this album, but makeout creek is such a fascinating mix of styles and influences
[18:21:31] pbklol: the mannequin with heels built into the foot is such a crazy visual
[18:21:46] BleepBloopMusicFan: When you're born serving
[18:21:49] lilb-basedgawd: song that stings the closer you get to 30
[18:22:27] pbklol: ok so the next hint will unfortunately be discord exclusive
[18:22:29] pbklol: but itll be worth it
[18:22:36] akanewasright: like mitski being a scrappy new guitarist who jsut graduated music school (where she wrote on piano), letting out all her energy and emotions she'd had to suppress is just such a magic concoction
[18:23:20] akanewasright: this music video kinda rocks
[18:23:32] akanewasright: like the subtitles do so much

[18:44:46] gucci6629: it's so random
[18:44:48] bran: this is their best song
[18:44:55] gucci6629: especially as BO$$ only got a meagre 3 votes
[18:44:56] Roxie: i think i brought them up when you said the girl group thing
[18:45:03] ricki: it wouldnt be a popheads top 100 without a random gaggy song being in
[18:45:07] bigbigbee: oh my god the dancing in this mv is so bad and this is their best foot forward

[18:45:09] lilb-basedgawd: 5H fans hide in the shadows
[18:45:10] BleepBloopMusicFan: I'm glad i haven't been looking at my vote list because then I wouldn't have been gagged getting reminded of this
[18:45:27] akanewasright: i forget that this is like. a quality pop song bc i just think of the humiliating performances they did for it
[18:45:33] bran: normani and camila flopping methinks they bring back 5H already
[18:45:34] akanewasright: like the "everybody clap" one :sob:
[18:45:48] nonchalantthoughts: said no one, let them be solo
[18:45:50] lilb-basedgawd: wait wait wait hold the phone

[18:45:59] Jules: We do need 5H back actually without the killer contract I feel like they could work something out
[18:46:01] ignitephoenix: meghan trainer put her pen to work here
[18:46:02] crimsonroset: my conspiracy is they 100% meant jackhammer but that doesnt sound as good
[18:46:04] bogo: the normani album is good [2]

[18:46:27] Roxie: when i was doing 2014 year end i was learning about how much song writing megan was doing for radio disney core artist this era
[18:46:45] akanewasright: bc like... if she was hustling like bey was for b'day, i'm positive we'd be getting at least some radio play somewhere
[18:46:54] ricki: normani and diana agron have such similar work ethics
[18:47:03] ignitephoenix: not dianna dflgdfg
[18:47:13] akanewasright: like her team seems to think she's 2013 bey famous and forgot that bey worked her ass off to promote everything for ages

[18:56:41] akanewasright: and that was like. before his breakout
[18:56:43] TMB: talking body not being here would be a crime
[18:56:44] bigbigbee: I comment on it in the writeup but like this music concept is so at risk of being like uncomfortable in a bad way
[18:56:47] bigbigbee: but it's uncomfortable in a good way
[18:56:48] bigbigbee: IMO
[18:56:52] akanewasright: and then they released it without abel when he was starting to blow up :shakey:

[18:57:25] ignitephoenix: I think i voted talkign body
[18:57:26] crimsonroset: ~if the people want this song to do worse in the rate they should get their ballots in~
[18:57:29] camerinian: it kinda was thee fka twigs for ages
[18:57:34] lilb-basedgawd: here comes the shaaaaame
[18:57:44] seanderlust: this came out when i was in college too and the number of people in my school who fully missed the point that this wasn't a party song and just sang along with the III WANA SWIIING part
[18:57:44] akanewasright: thinking about the one video that was like
[18:57:46] Roxie: my favorite sia songs being *checks notes* elastic heart, cheap thrills ft sean paul and santas coming for us
[18:57:46] camerinian: cellophane has probably overtaken it now tho
[18:57:48] akanewasright: phantom of hte chandelier
[18:57:59] nonchalantthoughts: i think from my ballot I'm going to guess 2on and uptown funk made it
[18:58:00] lilb-basedgawd: @Roxie Breathe Me?
[18:58:04] pbklol: the next 6 songs being 3 writeups from the same person twice in a row ctfu
[18:58:05] nonchalantthoughts: not sure about west coast
[18:58:06] lilb-basedgawd: the, uh, the six feet under song
[18:58:07] Roxie: i do not know that one
[18:58:07] Jules: I do lave snowman if we're talking christmas
[18:58:10] crimsonroset: my favorite sia song being from LSD
[18:58:12] Nagisoid: west coast prob next
[18:58:17] akanewasright: where it was a cover of hte song but at the end they started belting the high part with the key going up each time like in phantom of the opera
[18:58:18] ignitephoenix: cheap thrills definitely is one of the best isa songs
[18:58:22] Jules: I also love alive
[18:58:24] Roxie: i actually dont know many sia songs outside of the hits
[18:58:31] gucci6629: lowkey forgot how amaze this mv is
[18:58:33] akanewasright: cheap thrills kinda the 11 to me [2[
[18:58:34] gucci6629: i used to be obsessed with it

[18:58:38] crimsonroset: lsd - thunderclouds an insane song
[18:58:44] Jules: omg and she wolf
[18:58:44] ricki: i was kinda a sia stan during 1000 forms of fear era tbh
[18:58:45] Roxie: cheap thrills was my go to just dance song for a minute

[18:58:48] nonchalantthoughts: yeah cheap thrills is the only sia song i like
[18:58:54] akanewasright: same ricki...
[18:58:55] bigbigbee: though i think of that as a guetta song
[18:58:56] ignitephoenix: titanium a classic
[18:58:58] pbklol: i cant give any hint for the next song thats not EXTREMELY obvious so... idk make of that what you will
[18:59:02] crimsonroset: that whole project is so much better than it has any right to be like who put labirinth sia and diplo together and was like 'now eat'
[18:59:02] Jules: she wolf falling to pieces is so incredible
[18:59:10] pbklol: its an artist we havent seen yet tho!
[18:59:11] LowFrantico: my early music taste was anything that was on just dance
[18:59:14] Jules: I hate lsd the group
[18:59:14] akanewasright: cheap thrills i found when i twas released as a promo single pre sean pual remix and i was immediately like
[18:59:15] crimsonroset: marina

[19:00:10] ignitephoenix: stunning 3
[19:00:13] lilb-basedgawd: i was strictly on the fandom/superwholock side of tumblr and this bitch still had my dashboard on a chokehold
[19:00:14] jirachi: stunnhng 4
[19:00:16] bigbigbee: I have such a good memory of this song because of Winners 2
[19:00:22] pbklol: i knew if i said the word familiar everyone would clock it immediately . so i said nothing
[19:00:27] ricki: this being the shortened version pisses me awfff
[19:00:28] TMB: the music video cutting out the extra verses is a crime though
[19:00:31] bigbigbee: i think i gave it like a 7 there and then had the classic "wait this is a 10" after
[19:00:32] Roxie: i know so much marina secondhand from my fandom dash [2]
[19:00:33] TMB: wbk ricki
[19:00:54] akanewasright: marina fr had it all figured out this era... she wrote the whole album all on her own, it was mostly great songs, the quirk was still there, but it felt like there was a real band behind her most of hte time... man
[19:00:54] nonchalantthoughts: so i guess west coast has a chance
[19:01:02] ignitephoenix: why is the dude just sitting there in this video lol
[19:01:02] akanewasright: and the tour was SO good

[19:01:32] akanewasright: in a just world happy would also be here but i knew we were not voting for hte power ballad
[19:01:35] Jules: tbh marina also was very broke this era I think
[19:01:36] Roxie: it kinda lives rent free in my head
[19:01:38] akanewasright: GOD not melanie
[19:01:42] SteelStepladder: Looking at the songs I voted for that's not in. I'm surprised Often by the Weeknd didn't make it

[19:03:26] bigbigbee: &gt; The lyrics are a kinda weird metaphor for her being extremely horny, like truly next level horny but I think she’s selling it well.
[19:03:31] Jules: I do want to say I was listening to Disconnect recently and maybe in an alternate version that collab could've worked into something great

[19:23:48] jacksboredtoday: but anyway the turn video got a ton of hype at the time but i always thought it was kinda too gimmicky
[19:23:50] pbklol: if you catch me on the right day this is her best song

[19:25:57] jirachi: we gagged
[19:25:59] ignitephoenix: song of the decade
[19:25:59] crimsonroset: genuinely the moment i get a slot in a meta rate its so over for yal
[19:26:03] bigbigbee: you cannot stop yourself from dancing if you head this in real life
[19:26:06] camerinian: uptown funk and shut up and dance top 10 omg the wedding playlist won
[19:26:09] jacksboredtoday: remembering when i rewatched this video a few years ago and couldn't unsee that its the New York Street from the Fox Studio lot
[19:26:11] bigbigbee: even if you don't like it that much in the context of the radio
[19:26:13] bigbigbee: source: me yesterday
[19:26:13] lilb-basedgawd: call the police and the firemen't

[19:26:15] BleepBloopMusicFan: Honestly Cam
[19:26:17] nonchalantthoughts: i didn't realize shut up and dance was eligible, i would have voted for it
[19:26:25] impla: this vid saur good as well
[19:26:31] Jules: I do agree with the stereogum review that this was more a cultural moment than really even a hit song
[19:26:35] akanewasright: obviously bruno mars was well established by this point, but this song is kinda where he solidified as a person with a face and an artistic identity
[19:26:36] Roxie: tbh
[19:26:36] ignitephoenix: so top 5 is style, 2 on, shut up and dance, two weeks and ??
[19:26:38] ricki: boom clap | style | 2on | two weeks | shut up and dance
[19:26:42] ignitephoenix: boom clap right
[19:26:46] bigbigbee: This did unspeakable things to kpop for a bit btw
[19:26:52] nonchalantthoughts: waahhh
[19:26:53] gucci6629: it still is...
[19:26:53] kappyko: as soon as this song was released parents everywhere had it installed into their systems
[19:26:54] ignitephoenix: boom clap shouldn't be this high im sorry
[19:26:55] ricki: AJU NICE
[19:27:02] bigbigbee: aju. NICE
[19:27:02] impla: tea yetti
[19:27:07] lilb-basedgawd: @Jules Tom Breihan is a great rider and I read that column every week but he's still my enemy for the Barenaked Ladies review
[19:27:14] camerinian: i voted for boom clap but if it was top 20 i wouldn't have complained
[19:27:15] lilb-basedgawd: *writer. rider? aw man
[19:27:16] akanewasright: help what did he do
[19:27:19] gucci6629: damn this song is great though

[19:27:46] akanewasright: the way the last time i heard this in full was probably watching sonic 2
[19:27:53] bogo: tom breihan HATED one week and fucking tore into it in the number ones column on it
[19:27:55] lilb-basedgawd: @bigbigbee thank you Bruno Wars Wiki, very cool!
[19:27:55] bigbigbee: that fandom page is very unfunny to me but the fact that it EXISTS confused me greatly
[19:27:57] nonchalantthoughts: wahhhhh
[19:28:04] BleepBloopMusicFan: Man I should have voted for this actually I forgot how good it was
[19:28:06] lilb-basedgawd: *Mars i can't spell. save me
[19:28:10] Jules: to me that column is kinda meh to me but I read it every week anyway
[19:28:11] BleepBloopMusicFan: 24K magic still better but it's better than most things
[19:28:20] lilb-basedgawd: I'm a That's What I Like man myself
[19:28:21] impla: this song amaze
[19:28:25] Roxie: can bruno come back and drop another album,,,,

[19:28:48] ignitephoenix: with anything truly
[19:28:50] Roxie: just because nobody else wanted it doesnt mean i didnt,,,,,
[19:28:55] lilb-basedgawd: this was a reset for Bruno's whole career fr. He found his true niche
[19:28:58] impla: maybe we need to rate the album first
[19:29:02] akanewasright: i was kinda tired of bruno for a while but like. its been long enough that by the time of silk sonic i was eager to have him back, and i'm back there still
[19:29:07] BleepBloopMusicFan: Need him to make more modern music that my dad enjoys
[19:29:08] bigbigbee: i'd take an unorthodox jukebox retread too
[19:29:11] Roxie: he did the superbowl half time show before this came out right?
[19:29:12] bigbigbee: i LOVE locked out of heaven
[19:29:12] BleepBloopMusicFan: There's only so much of it
[19:29:17] akanewasright: yeah @ roxie
[19:29:18] Jules: yes
[19:29:19] ignitephoenix: locked out of heaven the smash 2
[19:29:19] bran: the way it's been 8 years since 24k magic...
[19:29:21] Roxie: so wild
[19:29:21] bogo: bruno kinda one of the coolest people alive
[19:29:21] camerinian: bruno took the exact right amount of time off after 24k magic
[19:29:22] ignitephoenix: treasure also
[19:29:24] Jules: which is insane
[19:29:33] BleepBloopMusicFan: I always forget about Treasure but it's very good too
[19:29:36] bigbigbee: treasure good
[19:29:38] lilb-basedgawd: Treasure solid
[19:29:40] Roxie: when he won over lorde and for months you could not talk about bruno on the sub
[19:29:42] Roxie: dark times
[19:29:43] camerinian: treasure bops so hard
[19:29:44] ignitephoenix: thinking about all the rumours about how he was broke
[19:29:48] lilb-basedgawd: love the video only being in 360p or 480p
[19:29:53] akanewasright: very much appreciate that he's like. one of few pop stars who people are not generally parasocial about
[19:29:53] nonchalantthoughts: when roxie cooks their silk sonic rate, I will be first in line
[19:29:54] crimsonroset: TWON
[19:29:54] crimsonroset: UP
[19:29:55] pbklol: a lot of people seem surprised this next song got so
[19:29:57] kappyko: i kinda underestimated how great this outro is omg
[19:29:57] Jules: tbh his win over lorde was also insane

[19:29:58] nonchalantthoughts: upvote and fave
[19:29:58] lilb-basedgawd: the rumor come out: is bruno mars gay

[19:36:57] Roxie: not the free drugs
[19:37:09] akanewasright: @bigbigbee the kindest thing i can say about him as an actor is that 2021 WSS making tony an asshole semi on purpose was a decent artistic choice, even though he's still the weak link in an otherwise excellent movie
[19:37:11] bigbigbee: genie is the music app from korea!
[19:37:13] ignitephoenix: thinking about how my friend spoiled TFIOS before i read it
[19:37:18] TMB: die walk the moon

[19:37:19] camerinian: where are these free drugs and how can i theoretically avoid them
[19:37:21] bogo: thinking about this one youtube review of west side story I watched that basically listing off all the main actors and praising them and then was like "and ansel elgort should be in prison,"
