Therokinrolla: So, every song is gonna have a score distribution chart, where it shows how many of each individual score (1,2,3, etc.) were given.

>Oh, my GOD! "White Noise" is destined to flop but *I don't care*, this rate meant soooo much to me when I was hosting it and the reveal was so much fun to get through. Back when rates were HUGE on our subreddit, this rate was basically payola-d into existence because of being in the same comment as the REALiTi Art Pop Rate! (Shout out to the lovely /u/Mudkip1, who I later co-hosted that rate with!) I felt like I introduced so many people to so many amazing bops through this rate, and I literally discovered one of my favorite artists through coming up with this rate, KAYTRANADA. Can I talk about KAYTRANADA for a bit? Did you know he was gay? Did you know that he has a dog named Boris? Did you know he won the Polaris Prize over Carly Rae Jepsen's acclaimed record *E•MO•TION*? Did you know he most recently produced a remix for Kelela's "Waitin"? Did you know he is literally the most talented person alive and that my praise for his performance at Coachella got me a retweet from XL Recordings?
>
>Well, anyways, "White Noise" was the most unexpected winner for the rate. "Latch" got sabotaged by Rokin because of his homophobic treatment of Sam Smith, "Never Be like You" got sabotaged by Swearword because of reasons that I cannot fathom, "Say It" was not good enough somehow, and KAYTRANADA really, really did not stand a chance, unfortunately. It was interesting seeing KAY get slaughtered in the all-stars rate and "Say It" somehow making day 2! "White Noise" is so completely out of left-field, and it's probably the most unexpected winner below "Slumber Party". I really do think it's perfect pop, though; AlunaGeorge's voice is sleek as honey, and Disclosure's slick UK dance production is so evocative of that perfect 2013 sound. Definitely a great song, hopefully /r/popheads doesn't underrate it even though it's almost definitely third out. - /u/kappyko

---

**Therokinrolla** (7.5): Poor /u/kappoyko, his beloved EDM duo has earned the dishonor of being in very last place for our winners rate. And I see the points popheads has made: I had to relisten to this song because I couldn't remember what it sounded like, and now I'm writing this blurb finally a few hours later and I have again forgotten. It is a fine slice of EDM pop but in a rate full of all-time legendary tracks, diamond certified records, and pop-culture icons this just didn't have a chance. It isn't like it even has a big name feature for the rabid stans to throw 11s at, nor is it one of those instantly recognizable tracks that you can go "ayy I know this, TEN" to. Nothing worked in its favor, other than an 11.

---

# Slap, crackle, bop!

**ZankeeZero** (11): An absolute KNOCKER! AlunaGeorge and Disclosure were meant to collab ever since they both started their respective careers and i'm absolutely overjoyed at the fact that it happened. wig

**frogaranaman** (10): Literally the American government.

**MashLuke** (10): this gets the worst out of club kid me, so fucking good

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): but why is her voice like that

**twat\_brained** (10): I've been meaning to get into AlunaGeorge for awhile; I'm fond of "Attracting Flies", as well as the DJ Snake rework of "You Know You Like It" and "To Ü" with Jack Ü. Thankfully, I can't think of an EDM collab of theirs I haven't enjoyed, and this is far from an exception. As for the ginger jocks, this is the pinnacle of what made their EDM style so refreshing; it's the perfect blend of garage, house and trance, encapsulating listeners, making at least a foot tap or leg shake almost irresistible. It also helps that Aluna Francis totally bodies the lyrics here too.

**Tomoki** (9.5): Listening to this song was like taking a hit of poppers. I really felt like I was transported to a circuit party and now I’m ready to take 12 inches.

**1313Harbor** (9): Her voice in the chorus is so dreamy and perfect.

**camerinian** (9): I’m gonna be honest and say that I’ve never really dug Aluna’s voice, but fuck me if everything else doesn’t work here. Settle is one of my favourite albums of the decade, and this is one of the most immediate tracks on an album already full of absolute club classics.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): My third favorite song on ‘Caracal’. Still a very good one indeed.

**mysario** (9): this song reminds me of doing Edward 40 Hands and idr why

**stansymash** (9): i have applied my grooving ass and am prepared to groove

**1998tweety** (8.5): The vocalist is Britney and Ellie's lovechild.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Am I the only one who thinks this song may have also been created in order for...multiple purposes? I mean, when you have a high-pitched British female vocal over a electronic beat saying 'You just want to see me crying'...eh, maybe my mind's too tainted. White Noise is definitely a song I see the merit in, even if I'd think it a pain to put it on repeat. Like all good EDM songs, the repetition here is a strength, looping over and over again in your mind and perfectly suiting the messed up feedback AlunaGeorge is trying to tell us about. There's not much to say about it, but, hey, it works. It's nice hearing a Disclosure song that's not Latch.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): disclosure knows how to make a special kinda bop yo

**enecks** (8): This is mid-tier Disclosure. So it still puts most of the charts to shame.

**ExtraEater** (8): yes, hello. i was wondering if you could play that song again. the one that goes 'bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-beep.'

**notdallin** (8): I’d pick almost any of the other singles from Settle over this one but the exciting thing about new Disclosure in 2018 is that we have future pop/house music that sounds like this again and I’m here for the revival.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Me @ white noise machines

**Bendariaku89** (7.5): my opinion on this song changes everytime I listen to it.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): disclosure’s production is fantastic but I’m not a fan of the vocals and the underwhelming build up. It would bang in a high end club though.

# (White Noise Joke)

**MrSwearword** (7): the vocals still don't measure up, but the funkiness remains

**nooodisaster** (7): "If you wanna get tough/Then let's play rough" is the best part of this song.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (6): fun fact, I actually won some radio merch thanks to this song. i still don't like it though.

**HoodooMooJuice** (6): It has a good beat I guess...

**literally100bees** (6): It's fine

**Shadow1087** (6): there's not too much substance to this one

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (6): production is good but the vocals miss

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5.5): ugh her voice bothers me so much but the song kinda slaps but it shouldn't have won

**jamesfog** (5): Ummm..

**J\_Toe** (4): this sounds like one of those generic electropop songs they play using spotify at my gym

**gannade** (3.5): im sorry kappy but this is so ... noisy ... white noise

**ComeOnAndSlang** (3): sure is

**FireLordAegon** (3): I liked some parts, but this is gonna be a no from me.

**shipsinker44** (3): wait this is trash LMAO how bad were the rest of the songs in this rate that caused this to win

**welcometoNY** (3): i don't know what this is supposed to be and it's very very forgettable

**animefangrant62** (2): this would be better if it sounded like the title

**flickeredinmymind** (2): sounds similar to the years & years guy

**GoWestYoungKanye** (2): this is not my kind of song which is sad because i like disclosure and alunageorge separately and again i have to wonder if this was really the best song in its given rate

**NuneEtsuko** (1): Wtf? Why is this song here with all these iconic songs?!

**SpanKKy1** (1): this sounds like the music they play in the garden at a club where all the smokers are and it makes me anxious

**bloupp** (0): How did this win a rate?

**Solovrinne** (0): HOW this won a rate, I'll never know. Nope.

#Throwback to my 0 

**Roxieloxie** (8): wait this isn't latch

**VodkaInsipido** (8): latch deserved better

**radiofan15** (7.7): I'm not sure of the context of this song winning a rate but if it was a rate including the whole album Settle then IT DID NOT DESERVE TO WIN WHEN "WHEN A FIRE STARTS TO BURN" AND "F FOR YOU" AND EVEN "LATCH" EXISTS

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): i like disclosure a lot but they have bigger bops

**strawberryswing1** (6.5): How the Hell did this beat Latch

**bespectacIed** (6): This won a rate? Of all the songs from Settle?

**Leixander** (2): at least this is not latch but it is as annoying

>Used To You winning the Fantasy Eurovision was a cool moment for me. I submitted it because I am a fan of the singer's music and I've loved the song since the first time I heard it on the radio. The track was written by Dua Lipa and sent to Annalisa and although it wasn't that big of a hit in Italy nor anywhere else, winning that rate made it pretty memorable here. It was a great a way for me to introduce the community to some good Italian music and I still remember the day it won. It was a weird patriotic internet moment for me and one year later, with its bubblegum beat, colorful music video and charming dance routine I still love this song and apparently that day so did most people. A bop is a bop, no matter where it's from. - /u/MashLuke
>
>Beating out French CRJ (Cocovan) and Dutch Dua Lipa (Maan), Annalisa enjoyed a comfortable 14-point win in the first Eurovision rate. A breezy song, this is certainly one of the more fun songs from the rate, and potentially the winners rate also. - /u/berober04

---

**letsallpoo** (9): Annalisa is like the Italian Little Mix, except even more local, so she was instantly doomed when she was tossed into the fray here. Even in her original rate, our first iteration of /r/popheads Eurovision, she wasn't seen as a winner - most people looked to the French and Carly-lite Cocovan as a the clear victor. But Annalisa won in the end, and unlike most of the doomed artists from our Eurovision contests, she's continued to have a successful career, even if that success is almost entirely contained to Italy. "Used to You" doesn't try to do anything special -  even the titular line, "I could get used to you," isn't trying too hard - but it's all the better for it. It's like a blast of warm air; it's not quite summery, but it carries a carefree and infectiously upbeat giddiniess about it. I forgot how much I adored this song until this rate started up again.

# Anna-LIT-a

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Synthpop perfection. A little tinged with melancholy, but then again, all the best songs are.

**MashLuke** (10): a bop

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): gurl i hear sumn and it slaps

**poppinmmolly** (10): a bop!

**camerinian** (9.5): I guess this is my punishment for being a stinky English-language centric coloniser. I could have had this song in my life two years ago and I’m only just listening to it now. I hate myself, but I loved this song immediately.

**ExtraEater** (9.5): was a real surprise when i first heard it, and it's still just as great now

**Roxieloxie** (9.3): danceable bop

**dramiaa** (9): This song blew me out of the water lol. I wasn’t expecting it to be as good as it is. It’s a great track and its also crazy catchy with like 5 different hooks. I appreciate the fact that she says the name of the song for the 1st time on the bridge, and Im not even annoyed by the random “whoop”s throughout the song

**frogaranaman** (9): I love Dua Lipa!

**mysario** (9): one of the few songs I hadn't heard before but thoroughly enjoyed

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): Outitalianed G*ga

**RandomHypnotica** (9): wow annalisa coming out with the suprise bop of the rate

**shipsinker44** (9): wow ive never heard this but its actually good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I’ve literally never heard this song before - not only is it a megabop, but it sounds like YouTube intro music but GOOD

**welcometoNY** (9): i have no idea what this is or where it's from but i love it

**ZankeeZero** (9): This is a huge bop! i'm really surprised at how this wasn't a single because it's REALLY catchy.

**twat\_brained** (8.6): Being a Kim Petras stan has ruined my life because every time I hear those "whoo"s I keep thinking I'll hear "ah" afterwards. Apart from that the song sounds lovely, even if Annalisa herself sounds pitchy here and there.

**Leixander** (8.5): there are so many good songs here that I can't really say this is going to be robbed but this is going to be robbed

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): This is the first I've heard of Annalisa but I'm going to have to explore her a bit more, I really like this sound and her voice. The video is weird and generally falls on the bad side of weird, but the song is cute and catchy.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (8): idk which rate this is from but damn if I didn't added this to my playlists immediately... real fun song, kinda Dua-ish, but not on par with the other songs of the rate

**bespectacIed** (8): First time hearing this song so I don't want to rate it high, but this is a MAJOR bop. What rate did this song won in coz I've never heard of her


# Anna-loser

**1998tweety** (7.5): This song is decent but it doesn't really hold up with everything else in the rate.

**banananaise** (7.5): let's be real, this would not come close to winning a real eurovision

**Bendariaku89** (7.5): i like the chorus. the rest is fine, but definitely not anything outstanding.

**HoodooMooJuice** (7.5): Love this beat! hope it drops hard... Edit: it didn't, but it's still good

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): One of the two Eurovision songs in the rate, which might make it stick out like a sore thumb. That may be too harsh of a judgement, though. Maybe it's not much compared to all the iconic winners we have lined up here, but it's by no means a forgettable track. I believe this was the submitted song for Italy, and that it was a surprise victory over other countries like France, which featured a solid enough song from a Carly clone, and the United Kingdom, which featured an absolutely hilarious freestyle chock full of references from Lady Leshurr. I'm still not sure what made it win over those two (I'm not bitter or anything, I gave my highest score to a rap song from Cyprus that was never going to make it) but if I had to take a guess, I'd say it's because this was an above average pop track that appealed to most people voting, as opposed to some other songs like the ones I just mentioned. That my have made it rack just enough points to step on top of the podium. On its own, I only find it  decent, but it sure is an interesting winner for one of our most unique rate events.

**PuggleMaster** (7.5): I love the synths

**raicicle** (7.5): is this bebe rexha’s sister

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): I didn’t know this song, it’s cute

**strawberryswing1** (7.5): kinda a bop!

**CarlieScion** (7): this sounds like dula peep

**ignitethephoenix** (7): It’s cute and I like the techno production, but it just doesn’t stand out to me that much.

**J\_Toe** (7): what rate did this song win I don't know it?

**MrSwearword** (7): Italy's answer to This Is How We Do. At least this person knows how to hold better notes. Still, a scoche underwhelming.

**Shadow1087** (7): italian privilege is never being asked if you're buying too many tomatoes

**Solovrinne** (7): Well that was a pleasant surprise. Never heard this before but it's definitely a bop. Lyrics are incredibly cliché, though.

**warmishblood** (7): This isn't one of my favourite Annalisa songs, but I'm glad its here.

**airylnovatech** (6.5): It's so bouncy and happy, my friends hate it

**dropthehammer11** (6): its okay

**enecks** (6): No offence, but this is super lightweight and doesn't weigh up to the classics in this rate

**FireLordAegon** (6): I was not a huge fan of this song.

**kappyko** (5.5): this aged really poorly for me especially when i started listening to dua lipa

**AbnormalPopPunk** (5): what is this

**jamesfog** (5): A basic pop song compared to classics in this rate.

**JohnnyBAverage** (5): This won a rate?

**Tomoki** (5): OK queen go off!! A fun bop, but the production really holds this back.

**selegend** (4): It’s cute

**GoWestYoungKanye** (2): what rate did this win cause um i refuse to believe this was the best of anything lol. Annalisa girl get some priorities you don’t need a man

**NuneEtsuko** (2): dafuck is this? The voice is great but the song is trash IMO

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (2): omg what is this "this is my first time trying Garage Band" ass music

**original\_doll** (0): this isn't even bad in an interesting way, it's just annoying and boring

Therokinrolla: **cyborglilith** (8): bop

**didney-worl** (8): How have I never heard this absolute bop before?

**lunasaflowers** (8): Such a happy and cute bop! Very late 00s/early 10s in the best way.

**nooodisaster** (8): P!nk and Dua Lipa had a baby, and she's... not bad. To me, the chorus is a bit just there, but the overall production and that bridge are really great.

**stansymash** (8): PLEASANT

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8): cute lyrics and good production

**radiofan15** (7.8): I've never heard this song before this rate and it's cute I guess but it must have been a really weak rate for this to win.

**tapdancingpig** (7.8): I’m trying to be hard on everything this rate, but this would probably be at least a 9 in a normal rate. It’s such a bop!

**notdallin** (7.6): I know I’m appealing to a very small intersection of the Venn diagram but this song sounds like it’s a Bee and Puppycat bloop song remixed.

**letsallpoo** (10): When amazing pop album after another was dropped in 2016, it was obvious that they would all wind up in a rate. Most contendors were obvious: *Anti*, Rihanna's long-overdue eighth album that was also her most consistent; *Lemonade*, another one of Beyonce's surprise releases and a eclectic and incredible mixture of sounds and genres; *Joanne*, Lady Gaga's mildly country album that birthed a million memes. And then there was *Glory*, which was...a good album by Britney Spears. I insisted that Britney still be included, though, because even though I was sure she wouldn't win, I still believed she deserved a spot among the big leagues.

And then she won with a Tinashe collaboration. The gradual meltdown in the day 3 rate thread was glorious, as you watch the Beyonce songs whittle away, Gaga and Rihanna eventually depart, and Britney somehow hold on to the very end. It was, in a word, iconic, and the term "Slumber Party" entered /r/popheads lexicon afterwards whenever an underdog eventually won. Is "Slumber Party" better than every other song on those albums? I mean, probably not - I think most of the people who participated in that rate would disagree, including me. But I don't regret this winning in the slightest. If anything, I hope "Slumber Party" serves as a reminder to not take these rates that seriously. Now everyone please go buy tickets to the Domination show - she's flopping and needs to support her children.

# Tinashah

**SpanKKy1** (11): watching britney lick milk off a table is the reason i haven't killed myself yet

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Y’all give this song too much shit for stealing the rate, it had every right to do so :/

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I never really paid much attention to Britney’s most recent era until I heard that this won a rate. Then I decided to take a listen to this song, and wow this should have been so much bigger. It’s extremely catchy and the production fits so well with the song. Also this song is probably the peak of Tinashe’s career lol. I won’t even be mad if this song somehow wins the rate again. It would be peak popheads and the sub should be renamed slumberpartyheads if it does.

**JohnnyBAverage** (10): look it's probably not worth a 10; however, i remember when this won the 2016 rate and it was so glorious and it fills me with joy everytime (speaking of Britney 10s) . For this I owe tribute to that which is Slumber Party and i see how our wonderful overlord deserves to go number 1 again. Tin-ah-sha good work, sorry about Ben Simmons, fuck the sixers anyway gurl

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): i love Britney

**Piccprincess** (10): pls meme

**shipsinker44** (10): ONE OF GLORYS BEST SONGS AND IT DESERVED TO WIN ITS RATE AND BTW THE REST OF THE GLORY ALBUM DESERVED TO WIN SO MUCH MORE, IF MAN ON THE MOON WAS HERE IT WOULD BE GETTING MY AUTOMATIC 11

**1313Harbor** (9.5): QUEENS

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): not the 10 i originally would’ve given it (had too many 10s) but i still love this song, it’s in my top 20 (yeah, there are too many good songs so it barely reached it).

**bespectacIed** (9.5): Lol I've heard stories of this infamy. I adore this song though ugh the horns on the final chorus is so genius

**yatcho** (9.5): Memes aside this is the best thing Britney has done since Toxic

**radiofan15** (9.2): It's catchy, sexy and deserved better (in the Billboard charts at least) but I'll never understand how it defeated all of the songs in Glory, Lemonade, Joanee and Anti in that rate.

**FireLordAegon** (9): I know this song is... controversial in rates (I didn't participate in that rate and even I'm mad at the outcome), but issa bop sooo...

**strawberryswing1** (9): I love how sexy and sultry this song is. Forever an icon.

**twat\_brained** (8.4): Julia Michaels' career peak. Fight me. Is this the best song on Glory? It's definitely right up there. Revisiting it for this rate, I don't rate it as high as when I was 18, however it proves can still absolutely sound gorgeous if and when she wants to, and her duets remain fantastic. I say duet because Halsey's ex was a feature on *Glory*'s lead single, and a lacklustre one at that. This remains a great song, however, and I'd love to hear it live at the Domination residency.


# This anti-SlumberParty'd this time

**lunasaflowers** (7.6): It's a good song, but it's still hilarious that this won over ALL of Lemonade.

**HoodooMooJuice** (7.5): I remember really liking this when it released, it's not as good as I remember, but it's still alright.

**stansymash** (7.5): your reputation preceeds your slumber party. you are okay

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): kinda slaps but definitely should not have won against a lot of the songs in Lemonade and ANTI

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): /u/MrSwearword. I have learned the errors of my ways. Please stop cursing me for this every rate. The crops are dying. My wife had a miscarriage. The family is dying. Please.

**Solovrinne** (6.8): I remember this rate. I didn't participate but I wish I did. I can dig it after a few listens but it's nothing special.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6.7): its..........not bad

**notdallin** (6.7): This song is actually better than I remember it being but where’s Tinashe even featured in this song lol?

**CarlieScion** (6): i am confusion, how did this win its rate?

**dropthehammer11** (6): yall overrated the fuck out of this thing its decent on its best day

**poppinmmolly** (6): mediocre

**ReallyCreative** (6): This song doesn't suck and I almost like it but I don't and that's really all I have to say

**TragicKingdom1** (6): a shrinker, i get bored around the 2 minute mark

**AbnormalPopPunk** (4): my mind spins thinking that this won against everything from lemonade, joanne, and anti. even if a song from glory did win, it should've been what you need or clumsy, not this trainwreck

**camerinian** (4): Damn were you guys so starved for something halfway decent from Britney that you let this Hotline Bling-ass beat win out lmao guys y’all are like 7 years too late to the “Britney’s done” club

**Roxieloxie** (4): this is kinda basic

**welcometoNY** (3): anyway...this continues to have zero redeeming qualities except for making her sound pretty good

**airylnovatech** (2): Look, I just hate Slumber Party alright

**gannade** (1): i am NOT letting this bland ass song win a rate again! its a really by the numbers pop song and sucks the personality of both performers. if tinashe wasnt in this, u know it wouldve never reached top 20! and she adds nothing to the song

**nooodisaster** (1): This winning the "Ultimate 2016" rate is just what 2016 deserved. Not even top 5 on its album.

**chihuahuazero** (0): I was one of the lowest raters of this song in its original rate, and I’ll be one of its lowest raters again. Of the songs in this winner’s rate, it’s not even the best song from the Ultimate 2016 rate. “Pulling a Slumber Party” became a thing for a reason. It showed popheads that even if we think ourselves of higher taste, the most popular song isn’t always the best. This is an okay song, as expected from a pop star past her peak. The production is pleasant and the main subject is piquing. But amongst a sea of 10s, the 4.5 won’t get #1 again.

**enecks** (0): Britney is a D- vocalist with cheap production in this case and y'all heteros put it over Formation?

**ImADudeDuh** (0): Trash! It was forgettable af in the original rate and it has not improved at all over time. One of the few rate winning songs I legitimately hate.

**MrSwearword** (0): Remember those generous two points for a cute Yanis Marshall video? NOT TODAY, SATAN. Fuck this song and its stans. I Kissed a Girl sucks and it's not like this pandering horseshit did it any better.

**SinfulAnarchy** (0): this sounds like a Trisha Paytas song

Therokinrolla: **VodkaInsipido** (9): don't get me wrong still mad this won over freedom

**ZankeeZero** (9): Taking a risk here seeing as this literally coined a term called "slumber partying a rate" in the popheads vocabulary, but I trust the huge amount of extremely bitter gays in this sub to keep it out of the n.1 spot.

**1998tweety** (8.8): I already know this song is gonna get robbed, I mean its for sure not the strongest song in the rate but the anti-circlejerk is gonna kill it.

**mysario** (8.5): I miss having slumber parties

**twat\_brained** (8.4): Julia Michaels' career peak. Fight me. Is this the best song on Glory? It's definitely right up there.

**banananaise** (7): (begin tired meme) wow i love tinasha (end tired meme)

>So many questions to answer. What are we doing? Hollywoo stars and celebrities: what do they know? do they know things?? Does any of this really matter? is there anything I can really say about this song? The answer to all of those is no. Here is a song that speaks for itself. Here is the iconic song of a generation. Here is the progeny of Jesus himself. Here is the song that launched the career of pop mega star Alessia Cara. I really can't do this song justice nor can i say anything about it that it cant say for itself. To attach meaning to this song would be to define the empty space between our fingers. Here. - /u/FranklyTheTurtle

**letsallpoo** (8): Around the time "Here" was released, I found myself at a college party I didn't want to be at. I couldn't leave - my suitemates had brought the party to our domain - and I felt too uncomfortable and unfamiliar with anyone there to do anything beyond sit at the end of the sofa and dissociate. "Here" is a pretentious little song about being too cool for the party, and I can see why it would be polarizing to listeners. Regardless, I still adore it; I don't think any song has come close to articulating what I felt during that party, as I sat at the end of the sofa, smelling cheap beer and weed, trying to ignore all the strangers around me, and suppressing an urge to bust down the door and leave.

# This song is here, unlike any Halsey, Taylor, Rihanna, Lana, Janet, & Katy

**1998tweety** (10): This is a throwback for me cause its from the first popheads rate I did!

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): tumblr generation who

**Bendariaku89** (10): a song for introverts and really well written too. i haven’t been to a lot of parties, but that’s because i relate to the sentiment of disliking being around strangers. this song won’t probably win because not all people are introverts but it’s definitely one of my favorites and one i relate to.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): I know y’all are gonna bog down on Alessia because y’all think she’s trying too hard to be that ‘street-smart’ and ‘woke’ teen but come on, this is a masterpiece. #5 in America is great for debut single and she’s managed pretty well following it up. Glasses raised for all the loners at parties everywhere!

**dropthehammer11** (10): this is one of this decade's shining moments in pop music. prove me wrong. spoiler you fucking CANT

**gannade** (10): Halsey shouldve won this rate but Here is a slay. some girl talkin bout her haters, she aint got none...

**JunkyGS** (10): One of the best pop songs and strongest debut singles released in the past 5 years. No contest.

**MashLuke** (10): I think we shouldnt play this song in plug.dj because then it would contradict the song's theme. Everyone should just play it on their own without any contacts from the outside, it's what Alessia would do

**mysario** (10): ironic party hit

**rickikardashian** (10): When I first started frequenting this sub I remmeber waiting impatiently to do this rate, and when it finally came, my dumb-ass forgot to submit scores, and Im still angry about it. Anyway, Know It All is a great album and Im glad this won

**Dracyoshi** (9.5): These lyrics are brilliant and Alessia sounds fantastic. You can feel the tension and atmosphere; through the lyrics, vocals, and production. I find the "OooOOh OooOOh here" hook a bit annoying, but admittedly it's appropriate for how uncomfortable she is.

**radiofan15** (9.5): I know Alessia isn't well liked here but Here, her debut single, shouldn't be ignored just because of that. Her Isaac Hayes/Portishead sample is JUST so well used and gave to the radio stations of the time some well needed sonic variety.

**notdallin** (9): wow I haven’t listened to this in a while and as soon as those strings pour in it takes me somewhere else. Amazing production. What a unique song.

**NuneEtsuko** (9): 21st century's Glory Box and I'm living for it.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Kind of post-Lorde 'i'm not like the other girls'-core lyrically but her delivery is kind of weirdly dark and powerful that it makes it work. The sinister production really gives the song kind of a unique edge that I really like, especially with the low-key string section. It makes me wish Alessia hit this level of interesting again instead of making songs like Scars to Your Beautiful and Stay.

**ZankeeZero** (9): I gave this my 11 during that teen pop rate, but I don't know if I agree with that choice anymore tbh. It's a great song, but the lyrics are kinda... awful.


# What IS this doing here tbh


**welcometoNY** (7): i forgot how much i liked this song. it's actually really really solid

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6.3): I remember when the payola for this first started because she was on my local iHeart station ALL THE TIME and no one knew who the fuck she was and my pretentious ass was like ‘haha this is how I feel about parties!!’ And I could totally be A&R cause I knew it was going to blow up well before it did (except, looking back now, that was the payola). Well Alessia, I discovered BOURBON. And TEQUILA.

**airylnovatech** (6): There too

**hikkaru** (6): I adore the vibe of this song, with the sample that plays throughout and the fluttering piano notes and the horns and just EVERYTHING. Unfortunately, Alessia completely squanders the great potential of the production with a topic and lyrics that just make me shake my head. It's just so pretentious and I can't stand the people that are So Above house parties and would rather "listen to music with a message" like NO it's fun to get drunk and bop to some Kesha song from 2010 with your friends! I get that that lifestyle isn't for everyone and believe me, I'm not the most extraverted person ever either, but looking down upon a fun party in such a pretentious way is just so exhausting. Production? 10. The rest is obnoxious though.

**kappyko** (6): a loser? per haps

**Piccprincess** (6): ILY sis but how did you win a rate

**Shadow1087** (6): it's okay

**patronsaintofaspies** (5.5): Here was almost as unexpected to win its rate as Slumber Party was, but for all the ire the latter gets, I have a feeling Here might end up ranking below it. This is the song that brought attention to Alessia, attracting people's attention for having a song about being an introvert reach the Billboard Top 5; its perspective alone was probably what made a lot of people check it out. Personally, I hate parties, even if I'm actually more extroverted than I let on, but over time, this song ended up sounding more obnoxious to me than insightful or relatable. The bridge in particular is pretty cringeworthy. Musically, Here doesn't have enough redeeming or interesting elements for you to forget its botched criticism. I actually liked Alessia's debut, even if it was a little cookie-cutter, and I think there are much better songs on it than Here, both lyrically and sonically. If anybody wants to see the girl pull the sound she's trying to go for here better, I'd recommend listening to I'm Yours and Four Pink Walls.

**camerinian** (5): Gotta be honest that second verse about listening to “music with a message” really does kill the song for me like sorry ur not hearing fuckin hopsin or whatever at this frat party u loser. Points for sampling Portishead on a major pop song, but if u could not be such a twat about it thank

**dramiaa** (5): Just go home, girl. I don’t really like the vibe this song gives off, Im over songs about not liking parties and about not being like “other teenagers”. BUT, the instrumentals are great, I dig the hard drums, they compliment her voice very well,, plus her vocal delivery is great

**selegend** (5): I’m not one of the cool kids xD

**Tomoki** (5): I kind of tuned out listening to this one.

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): I like Alessia's voice but this song is just "I'm so cool because I don't do parties, ugh can you believe people smoke WEED, and get DRUNK ugh I'm so cool because I don't though" like we get it, you took Catholic school super seriously. Also you say you came to hang with friends and then immediately complain about how there's no one here who cares about your well-being. You sound like that one shitty friend who demands all the attention or none of it, that or you need to find new friends.

**aulyve** (3): Eh. Nah. Weirdly paced and lacking character, hook is weak as hell.

**mother\_rucker** (2): Pretention: The Song

**MrSwearword** (1): BYE

**static\_int\_husp** (0): It's amazing how 3 years ago this was regarded as quite good but now it just seems to sound super dated

**yatcho** (0): We get it Alessia, you're not like those girls you have really important things to say

Therokinrolla: 

**raicicle** (9): literally the only interesting song alessia cara has made in her entire career

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Kind of post-Lorde 'i'm not like the other girls'-core lyrically but her delivery is kind of weirdly dark and powerful that it makes it work. The sinister production really gives the song kind of a unique edge that I really like, especially with the low-key string section. It makes me wish Alessia hit this level of interesting again instead of making songs like Scars to Your Beautiful and Stay.

**ZankeeZero** (9): I gave this my 11 during that teen pop rate, but I don't know if I agree with that choice anymore tbh. It's a great song, but the lyrics are kinda... awful.

**FireLordAegon** (8.8): Oh shit I really liked this. Maybe I should stop dismissing her music?

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): i mean i used to be like what this song describes, but now it seems so… teenage

**followingfreeways** (8.5): it's a shame this song was so overplayed bc now i can barely stand it but it is a solid song and ridiculously relatable lol

**JohnnyBAverage** (8.5): I’m screaming I’ve heard this song so many times before and I had no idea it was Alessia Cara despite knowing who her and all her stars are,  shit twist I really dig this song, unfortunately it doesn’t have the great personal factor to elevate it but  don’t get me wrong - it bangs

**original\_doll** (8.5): just leave the party

**banananaise** (8): i must have really underrated this last time because i don't remember it being this good! really reminded me of a Bond song (the strings girl group) i listened to when i was a kid but i can't remember which one

**enecks** (8): This song is painfully relatable. I've gotten spiked at more parties than I've had fun at. Loneliness is underrated.

**frogaranaman** (8): She made one good song then dipped.

**Leixander** (8): this song asking itself what it is doing in this rate

**literally100bees** (8): There's one good Alessia Cara song and it's this one

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): Alessia Cara make good music again challenge

**RandomHypnotica** (8): i mean, sure some of the lyrics are kind of clumsy and the vocals kind of clash in flow with the beat, but it's still an enjoyable listen

**sbb618** (8): I love the slow, lilting tempo of this

**shipsinker44** (8): akskxblwsd im so surprised to see that alessia won a rate. this song is good, i was never really wow-ed by it and in fact i remember hating it when i heard it on the radio, but its grown on me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This song vs. the rest of Alessia’s discography is like watching season 1 of Prison Break vs. any other season of Prison Break

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): my favorite pretentious song

**HoodooMooJuice** (7.5): It's a solid pop song with a good lyrical groove and some nice production (really like those tambourines), but nothing really special. Probably my favorite Alessia Cara song TBH.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I like how Alessia made a song for those who aren’t really into partying but you feel peer pressured to go anyway because that’s how society rolls sometimes. It’s nice to see a popular song that’s the opposite of most pop/rap songs out there, but overall the song is just okay to me.

**jamesfog** (7.5): A chune that does not stack up to the competition

**skargardin** (7.5): This will forever be her magnum opus

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): I was about to rate this lower, since I’m now kind of sick of Alessia Cara, but then I listened to it and remembered who I loved this song when I first heard it. I’ve been to MANY parties where I’ve basically done everything she describes, but even if I hadn’t, I would have understood her discomfort through her lyrics. Plus, she sounds SO GOOD

**Solovrinne** (7.1): A moody bop. Introverts unite. Would be on my playlist if I was a few years younger. I think the deep voice in the background is incredibly eerie. Something about it throws me off. Otherwise, I dig it.

**animefangrant62** (7): probably my favourite Lorde song

**bespectacIed** (7): The "i'm not like any other girls, i'm so edgy" schtick doesn't age well, but it's a cute song

**CarlieScion** (7): im salty as FUCK that this beat halsey

**nooodisaster** (7): Okay so here's the thing. The lyrics in this are unique and great, & the vibe is strong, so on first listens it snatches wigs. But to me it's just not catchy or even really melodically appealing? So it has very little replay value. (also b4 you wanna read this rate, there were at least 10 songs better than this in it)

**SpanKKy1** (7): this is no seventeen

**stansymash** (7): this is the song that makes me think i'm about to hear 90s Classic Song Glory Box by 90s Classic Band Portishead but instead its here by alessia cara

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7): I only realized that this was Alessia in this song until I heard this for the rate. I remember this being played on the radio and at the store.

**twat\_brained** (7): Decent production but the vocals leave something to be desired, and Alessia just sounds so snobbish on this song. Don't like a party? Don't stick around! I kinda liked this song at first because I liked the sound it had. These days Alessia's music just seems a bit blasé; she's not doing enough to warrant her Best New Artist Grammy over Khalid and SZA. I'm also still really upset Colors lost and y'all trashed it in All Stars.

**VodkaInsipido** (7): maybe alessia is great

>One of the highest rated songs EVER out of any rate returns to see if she can snatch the ultimate crown. Creep is about a woman cheating back on her BF after he cheated on her; a message member Left Eye famously did not support and threatened to protest in the music video because of it. Creep peaked at #1 on the Hot 100 for four consecutive weeks, certified Platinum with 1,400,000 sales in the US, won a Grammy, has been cited by many major publications as one of the best songs ever to come out of the 90s and it's accompanying music video is considered one of the most iconic pop music videos ever. After listening to it once and hearing their smooth harmonies, infectious production and forward thinking empowered approach to the song, it is hard not to see why it picked up all of these accolades and is considered iconic. - /u/JunkyGS

---

**Therokinrolla**:Well, so much for our highest rated song of all time ever and forever (I think it was overtaken by some hag but I don't remember which song it was so for the purpose of this blurb I will say it is the highest because otherwise I genuinely don't have much to say about this song), we have a case of the mild problem that arises when different rates are compared to one another. When a relatively niche rate happens, people who are a fan of that niche are gonna do the rate, and people who don't like it won't do it, leading to rate scores not really easily being comparable to each other and giving poo and I a reason to host this clusterfuck!

Imma be real witchu chief I find this song entirely average. It's *fine*. It's not bad, but it's no highest rated song ever in /r/popheads history, and I think Popheads has realized that, given this quite low ranking in comparison to Creep's fellow rate winners. Anyways, time for some comments from people that have something to say!

---

# Here are the five comments people left for this song

**bespectacIed** (10): This is my "what one song defines the 90s to you" song

**gannade** (10): This song is so iconic and i am tired of people trying to erase it from the arbritrary overall rankings. if you dont think it shouldve been that high then maybe you shouldve done the rate!!! it DESERVES that 9.8+ average! all u stupid underaged twinks better learn some history!

**MrSwearword** (10): sorry again Left Eye, but even though you hated this song, it slays.

**PuggleMaster** (10): a classic that's gonna get robbed

**ReallyCreative** (10): TLC never did no wrong by my book and creep is no exception

**Roxieloxie** (10): tbt when i was a band kid and had to play this for five weeks straight

**TragicKingdom1** (10): leave junky alone

**1998tweety** (9.2): Lana outsold but this is cute.

**camerinian** (9): I don’t think I ever gave this song much of a thought before doing this rate because No Scrubs and Waterfalls seem so much more prominent in modern day culture, but honestly this song is great. The g-funk-esque beat with those horns is so great and, even thought those DJ scratches are a bit dated, the girls all pull off great performances. The harmonies on this are killer. This rate’s really prompted me to put this in regular rotation now / hate myself for not doing so earlier

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): Not my favorite TLC track, but easily in my top 5.

**mysario** (9): instrumentally, it feels dated but if anything, it adds to the allure of it

**stansymash** (9): i have applied my grooving ass and am prepared to groove

**tapdancingpig** (9): This is very 90’s, but it also bops hard. I’m kind of in love with the occasional horns thrown in with the repetitive synths and record scratches.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (8.8): left eye :(

**FireLordAegon** (8.8): Waterfalls and Red Light Special deserved better, but a bop is a bop

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I have a confession: my favourite part of this song is Left Eye going 'yezz, it's me again' at the beginning. Something about it is just so memorable for whatever reason. As for the song itself: is it better than Radiohead's? Actually, yes, it is. Thom Yorke may hate his own creep, but I doubt TLC hates theirs. I no longer enjoy this as much as I use to, because the crackling production is questionable, but if I manage to ignore how distracting it is, I can see why songs like it ended up allowing their record CrazySexyCool to sneak into Rolling Stone's Best Albums of All Time list. The lyrics, which detail a girl having revenge on her partner by cheating back on him, may make some uncomfortable, but even if the politics here are questionable, the girls deliveries pull the song's vulnerability, shadiness and guilt all at once, and the beat makes you recall a time where RnB was funky and innovative.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): An r&b classic, however I feel it lacks the staying power of Waterfalls or even Say My Name, which I'm STILL not over losing!! TLC on their TLC shit still bangs though

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): is this a legendary, awesome song? yes. did it deserve to win against jumpin', jumpin'? absolutely the fuck not.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (8): can't hear this song without thinking of The Other Guys

**cyborglilith** (8): I had a feeling that it sounded too similar to Something New by Zendaya

**mother\_rucker** (8): This was #1 on the day I was born, which means that I am older than 90% of Popheads users.

**Solovrinne** (8): It's smoooooth. Not my style but it ain't bad.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): B O P

**MashLuke** (7.5): too sad for me man, I dont like making my ears fall asleep

**notdallin** (7.3): dated in the best way possible.

# 5 more

**JohnnyBAverage** (7): so we have come to the highest rated song of all time. /# herstorian. I feel bad saying this but, I’m a little bored? In my opinion Waterfalls deserved, but hey who am I to argue against the general populous that is r/popheads. Don’t get me wrong, I’m really into this beat and the production is hot… but best of all time?? Idk

**original\_doll** (7): good song but it overstays its welcome

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): decent but very forgettable

**nooodisaster** (6.5): I **SAID**, don't go chasing waterfalls *picture of TLC pointing a gun*

**radiofan15** (6.2): OK nice... I respect Lisa Lopes and TLC's archievements but Creep just went by from one ear to the another... also Radiohead remains unbothered

**J\_Toe** (6): why does the singing sound flat?

**jamesfog** (6): Lol

**WilsonJason** (6): i see what you did here trying to steal our 10s but you aint foolin me

**enecks** (5): We aren't doing this again

**ignitethephoenix** (5): uhh why are their voices so nasally sounding and flat? Just not a fan of this even if the rest of the song is alright.

**Piccprincess** (5): dont meme this up again please ty

**strawberryswing1** (5): How did this song have such a high avg

**frogaranaman** (4): Literally half the users on Grindr. (As you can tell, this is the moment I have run out of creative juices for this rate. Please excuse the decreasing quality of comments. I am tired. God please help me. I have no homework done. Get me my ADHD medicine hoylfuck ing shit.)

**hikkaru** (3): This sort of R&B just isn't for me, sorry :/

**GoWestYoungKanye** (2.3): why did i think this was gonna be the radiohead song lmao this sub would hate the radiohead song. anyway i don’t really like this, i feel bad about it but i don’t.

**selegend** (2): I never liked this song tbh, don’t get how it ended up being so well received

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (1): sis what is this

>Can we all agree that the Queen of Pop has been robbed in every other single rate she's been featured in? Yes? Let us bask in the cold, frigid glow of Frozen's glory for just a minute, and then to repent for our pop sins, DON'T ever forget Her Madgesty ever again, and DO reflect on how perfectly crafted and hauntingly beautiful Frozen is. - /u/joshually

---

**Therokinrolla** (10): It is ironic that in a song called Frozen, Madonna has never seemed warmer and more open. Madonna had nothing to prove anymore - she was Madonna, songwriter, actress, dancer extraordinair. She had conquered all soundscapes she undertook, so the move to electronica was no surprise, just another challenge for her to overcome.

It is no mistake that the move to more robotic synths and electronic beats is paired with her most personal lyricism. The icy electronic beats pair superbly with the strings that seem to cascade across the chorus, vaguely reminiscent of Björk before she became *Björk* Björk. This song is about Madonna the person, not Madonna the celebrity. The "mmmm" in the chorus have no meaning alone, yet at the same time stand for the patience and understanding she has for the subject of this song.

She isn't presenting a complex mataphor of the nature of emotion, that can be saved for Björk. But what she does provide us is a song that has gorgeous and subtle imagery that is above all, human.

# Open hearts :relieved: 

**VodkaInsipido** (11): alright this is my 11, madonna isn’t exactly my favourite artist but i feel really attached to some albums of her (madonna, ray of light, confessions) because they are fantastic, and frozen is definitely one of her peaks: it’s trip-hop at its best, closer to art pop than to anything else in her discography, and probably one of the greatest pop songs of all time

**didney-worl** (10): honestly kinda prefer the west coast mashup don't @ me

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Very good song, and it’s not even my favorite on *Ray of Light*.

**gannade** (10): i never really got into madonna but ill admit this is good

**jamesfog** (10): This is a masterpiece and I didn't see that when this rate happened. Imagine thinking Together Again and Honey are better than this lol

**MashLuke** (10): her best song tbh, clever, clean and good

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): outsang Demi and that flop Idina Pretzel!

**MrSwearword** (10): THE 32ND BEST MADONNA SONG EVER

**radiofan15** (10): One of my top five songs by Medonner, which is saying a lot as she's one of my faves. I love everything about it, from the dark and cold yet embracing atmosphere to her cinematic and delicate delivery... it's a masterpiece deserving of it's spot in the pantheon of best songs of the 90s and Madonna's songs overall.

**teenage\_meme** (10): this came very close to being my 11. beyond beautiful. i loved this song as a kid. i kind of remember a horse in the video? was there a horse?

**TragicKingdom1** (10): one of the most atmospheric songs EVER

**bespectacIed** (9.5): How can a song sound so ahead of its time and like a product of its time both at the same time?

**lunasaflowers** (9.5): DAMN i have to listen to ray of light someday clearly

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): So good, to the point where it was even banned in Belgium. Madonna's enlightened persona may have been a little too orientalist for my taste, but even if she dropped it pretty quickly after a few years, her artistry in Ray of Light still feels ethereal and timeless, as if Madge is still this all-knowing middle-aged lady who's forever at the absolute peak of her career. Frozen is her most critically acclaimed song from the time period she managed to pull that image off, and it might be the most renowned composition of her career, at that. The production off Ray of Light is perfectly suited for Frozen, fitting in with the harsh, snow-cold atmosphere portrayed in the music video, true to the song's name. Madonna makes lyrics about a deteriorating love sound like wisdom literature put to poetry, and the end result is so beautiful that you don't even mind it being six minutes long.

**Solovrinne** (9.1): Justice for Ray of Light. Still a stellar song.

**1313Harbor** (9): The strings are amazing; this song sounds so cold and timeless.

**CarlieScion** (9): this song still gets played on norwegian radio lmao

**enecks** (9): Madonna couldn't let it go, could she? She just HAD to do THAT.

**itsabop** (9): #NotIdinaMenzel

**LandonKidatrea** (9): MY MOM LOVES THIS SONG

**mysario** (9): hauntingly beautiful

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): oh shit I thought this was that Enya song lmfao this bangs tho

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.9): oh wow, this surprised me, even though it sounds like a Disney deep cut and not a Madonna song

**1998tweety** (8.7): This is a nice song so maybe its cause I'm doing this rate late at night and I'm tired, but this song isn't captivating me as much as I think it should. It's still nice though.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): The humming and the strings just make this song feel so enlightening. I think we'd only need about 4 minutes (no pun intended) of it rather than an entire 6, truth be told. Nonetheless, this is definitely an underrated gem in Madge's discography, so I'm surprised not to see more love for it.

**nooodisaster** (8): Even tho it's the lead single, this still felt like it slumber party'd when it won, idek bro.

**stansymash** (8): this reminds me of a disney film. tangled i think

**tapdancingpig** (8): I don’t think Madonna’s training for Evita actually had much of effect until this album. I hate her in Evita, but she sounds SO GOOD on this song.

**original\_doll** (7.5): elsa is shook

# Closed hearts :pensive:

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): I liked this, but it felt like a 6 minute long bridge for a song that never had the building blocks around it. It's a good bridge, but I think I was just looking for something more?

**J\_Toe** (7): woulda been a ten if this was Ray of Light

**shipsinker44** (7): this song i have to be in a really specific mood for an itstoo long for me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): [insert Frozen joke here]

**Roxieloxie** (6.5): it's nice but it's too long

**bloupp** (6): I always think about the movie whenever I hear the word frozen now. I haven't even watched it

**camerinian** (6): All this song made me want to do is go listen to Pure Shores by All Saints since those synth tones are damn near identical but Pure Shores has a much more fun melody. Not wild about Ray of Light era Madonna, soz

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (6): How this won a rate where The Roof was also in is absolutely beyond me.

**ZankeeZero** (6): I'm so sorry to my friends in Madonna's [redacted], but i'm going to have to rob this one

**notdallin** (5.9): the strings are pretty but Madonna’s vocals over trance is just weird to me

**FireLordAegon** (5.5): Idk about this. It was cool at first, but maybe just a bit too long.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (5): one of Madonna's most boring singles tbh...also i hated how local radios would play this like 10 times in 12 hours even in 2011

**aulyve** (5): Whatev. Sounds great but pretty weak melodically.

**JohnnyBAverage** (5): Let me start out by saying i LOVE Madonna. She is absolutely in my top 10 and yet, this isn‘t it (obligatory isn't it isn't it isn't it isn't it). I swear I’ll rate hung up higher; i guess my heart isn’t open

**WilsonJason** (5): real talk for a minute. I reckon broods album this year will be their best

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): this sounds like it's come from a really generic movie soundtrack

**Piccprincess** (4): LET IT GO!!! LET IT GO!!!!! CANT HOLD IT BA-- oh wrong song?

**frogaranaman** (3): This song serves as a reminder for why you shouldn’t hook up with older gays. They’ll just play this shit while fucking you and it really throws you for a loop.

**warmishblood** (2): I think the song is boring, overly long and I don't like Madonna's voice here.

**Bendariaku89** (0): call it bad taste (probably is) but I think this song is just so boring and awful.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): What a snooze. How did this win a rate? The production reminds me of Hindi films which is interesting, but I feel like this is kind of forgettable.

**SpanKKy1** (0): this song is sonically the representation of getting dragged along a gravel and glass road tied to the back of a truck

>The second Eurovision was much closer than the first, with Lilac Sky winning by a single point. A booming beat over a subtly powerful voice, this was a worthy winner. - /u/berober04
>
>When I first found "Lilac Sky", it was instantly the song I knew could get far. It sounded so catchy, so interesting, and sounded like something that with a little bit of polish could be a huge alternative hit. The bass guitar is so suave, and the chorus sounds ripped straight out of the Ariel Rechtshaid book of tricks. I did not, however, expect to win... but when I did, I was so happy! I felt like I was able to share this amazing, unknown pop artist with so many people! I hoped she would be able to notice it!
>
>However, she has effectively dropped off the face of the Earth.
>
>Like, seriously! She has not posted new music in years, and there seems to be no social media for her. I wonder whatever happened to her? - /u/kappyko

---

**letsallpoo** (8): This is a 100% pure, USDA certified, grade A bop. When you're listening, you can just imagine the strobelights flashing as that bass guitar digs in, bodies gyrating around you as sweat lacquers your face. Julia Vero, unfortunately, seems to hvae completely vanished since dropping this song in 2015. No new music, no social media posts (or even social media accounts), no nothing. I genuinely believe one could argue that her career peaked when she won our second Fantasy Eurovision game. I just hope she's not waiting on tables in Sweden these days.

# Funky

**bloupp** (11): I know I'm throwing away my 11 but this song deserves it

**1998tweety** (10): Wow this song is gorgeous and extremely catchy.

**CarlieScion** (10): bop

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): best chorus of the rate? maybe?

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): I have no idea what rate this was a part of but if even half of the songs in it were this good I would be on my way to build a time machine

**gannade** (10): ok wow no name trash snappt. kim petras, take notes.

**FireLordAegon** (9.5): Woah Woah Woah where did this bop come from? Who is this girl???

**Solovrinne** (9.2): I can vibe to this, her voice works wonders at some parts.

**enecks** (9): This shit's funky

**lunasaflowers** (9): Holy damn, I never heard this before this rate but this is a BOP! I hope it doesn't go out Day 1 because of lack of name recognition. :(

**mysario** (9): I love that thicc bass

**JohnnyBAverage** (8.75): Wow look at me being basic af not hearing this prior to the rate.  Inflation is super difficult in this rate,  and I know I'm giving songs I haven't heard previously lower scores than they deserve. but what can I say I’m a little emo fuck at heart and this bops

**jamesfog** (8.5): A great song that deserved its win. Sad to see it in the bottom 5 !

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): okay but why does this sound like Side Effects by The Chainsmokers

**twat\_brained** (8.4): You touched me and suddenly I was a lilac sky, and you decided European music just wasn't for you. What frustrates me about the song is that I think she's gonna title drop at the end of the chorus by saying "like a lilac sky" but she **DOESN'T** and it's BEYOND FRUSTRATING! It's the perfect lead-in to the drop but she doesn't follow through and Julia's REALLY lucky I'm giving this

**cyborglilith** (8): y o u w e r e r e d , a n d I w a s b l u e .

**MrSwearword** (8): Sweden's answer to Sky Ferreira and I can get the appeal

**original\_doll** (8): huh this is actually pretty good

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I looked up Julia Vero online, and looks like the girl's not even famous in Sweden. The best pieces of promo I could find were a Bandcamp out, and a couple of other basic links. With that in mind, perhaps I can excuse the production on Liliac Sky for being unnecessarily abrasive. Though Liliac Sky is a surprisingly fresh track, combining dozens of devastating metaphors to create an earworm that sounds daunting and dangerous, what pulls me off actually loving it is the sound that layers Julia's voice, which tries to seem cool and echoey but ends up more of an annoyance than anything else. The song's apparent low budget makes me excuse such a result, though. Definitely the more interesting Eurovision entry.

**Roxieloxie** (8): kinda chill

**stansymash** (8): well this is nice good work sweden

**VodkaInsipido** (8): great discovery

**camerinian** (7): This is a fun little tune. Can’t say I’ll remember much of it, so maybe it’s not fair to be putting it up against so many classics, but I enjoyed listening to it I guess.

**MashLuke** (7): I wonder what colorblind people hear

#shitty

**amumumyspiritanimal** (6.8): was this an Eurovision song? I mean it's fun and cute but not really that great tbh

**notdallin** (6.8): pretty averagely good song if you ask me. Love song comparing love to drugs/addiction/getting high blah blah blah

**banananaise** (6.5): i'm docking 0.5 points because KEEP EUROVISION ENGLISH-FREE

**nooodisaster** (6.5): I don't wanna give this a bad score bc it's less known, but I'm just... not snatched? It's good, long chorus, slick production, like the intro, nothing amazing tho.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): LITERALLY who

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6): Had never heard this before but I enjoyed it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): /u/lilacsweetener

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): not bad

**radiofan15** (5.2): Honestly i'm not suprised this is the kind of songs that win rates in here... to each their own I guess.

**frogaranaman** (5): Fried bananas go harder than this song.

**warmishblood** (5): This song is alright but Dynabeat was robbed

**welcometoNY** (5): a bop but forgettable

**J\_Toe** (4): this sounds like one of those generic electropop songs they play using spotify at my gym

**Leixander** (4): sorry kappy but if you remember i didn't like this song back then as well

>Although the closest thing Kehlani has had to a hit has been the infamous and underrated Suicide Squad soundtrack song "Gangsta", "Distraction" was still the lone survivor of a rate with a title as long as her album. The pop and urban infused banger draws from 90's icons like Britney and Destiny's Child and transpires sensuality and boss bitch energy throughout breezy production and an infectious chorus. For me, "Distraction" is both Kehlani's saving grace and downfall: not only is it a good ass pop song with every part in its right place and perfectly executed, it has a dope music video, beautifully shot and i just have to do the little hand choreo in the chorus every time i listen to it. Sadly, the song is just too great for its 19 track parent album - you might just want to press pause on it and listen to something else. (Aquarius, maybe?) - /u/mokitsu

---

**letsallpoo** (9): Before I knew what a Kehlani was, I knew this song. It once played at my college dining hall, and that chorus stuck with me for some reason. Months later, I had to write a short description about rapper Tink, and for some reason I misattributed "Distraction" to her. I listened to her entire discography trying to find this song's chorus, but I couldn't, and I eventually gave up. I finally got my closure when we rated Kehlani and I realized that I had somewhat racistly confused Tink for Kehlani. Disirregardless, this is a huge bop and the fact that I remembered it despite originally not knowing anything about the artist is a testament to the strength of its hook. I'm glad we collectively decided that this song is better than all of CTRL. Queers won!

**Therokinrolla** (7): IDK how to write a paragraph about Kehlani but she is bisexual and pregnant so I will add 7 points to every song of hers from now on

---

# Queer Satisfaction

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): YAS QUEEN

**Bendariaku89** (10): that hook is stuck in my head now.

**CarlieScion** (10): B O P

**FireLordAegon** (10): Kehlani main pop girl 2019

**MrSwearword** (10): I'm still salty about Broken Clocks losing, but at least I can act like a stripper to this song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Holy skinny cow, is that you, Mariah?! Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, this song probably doesn't deserve a perfect score, but, sheesh, if it doesn't remind me of Mimi's own work...though it's a nigh-impossible task to ever reach the vocal capability of the Songbird Supreme, Kehlani's voice holds up very well in Distraction, never overexerting itself at any point in the song and carrying a sweet and tempting allure that tastes just like honey. Her performance works extremely well over a kind of lively, colourful RnB instrumental that we haven't been blessed with in years, and all in all, Distraction strongly implores me to check out more of Kehlani's work.

**PuggleMaster** (10): my first 11 that one and i'm sad that it won't make it to day 2

**shipsinker44** (10): omg one of myfavorites from this album

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): she snapped in this, the production :despair:. Immediately snatched my wig

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the real pop perfection song in the rate

**ZankeeZero** (10): A perfect pop song! IMO Tinasha deserved with a song that was not 2 On, but this is still a huge bop.

**bespectacIed** (9.5): Peak kehlani. If there were any justice in the world, this should've catapulted her to fame, but alas :(

**dropthehammer11** (9): a song

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Kehlani deserves to be so much more popular, this song bops.

**Roxieloxie** (9): do you do you do you do you

**Shadow1087** (9): gay

**camerinian** (8.5): This was the first song I heard by Kehlani that convinced me she was a seriously huge pop star in the making. I’m sure she’s still got a stone cold classic to come in her somewhere, but that chorus melody really is something else

**1998tweety** (8.4): This bops but I'm still a bit surprised it won the rate.

**stansymash** (8.1): hey thanks to the rate runners for all the hard work you do

**1313Harbor** (8): The “do you do you do you do you” hook is too good.

**chihuahuazero** (8): Thank you, popheads, for introducing me to this bop.

**enecks** (8): Isgood

**jamesfog** (8): An 11

# Mere Distraction

**cyborglilith** (8): I forgot Kehlani existed.

**MashLuke** (8): fine

**mysario** (8): I've already committed to writing a comment for every song but idk what to say here, it's p good I guess

**RandomHypnotica** (8): this was a nice distraction from the rest of the real competitors in this rate

**twat\_brained** (8): I like it much more than I initially presumed I would; the chorus is pretty fun. It's nowhere near as hooky as "2 On", which I really wish we were rating instead.

**banananaise** (7.5): tbh i don't remember liking Kehlani much when i did this rate but this time i'm kinda into it! maybe it's because i'm comparing her to kanye instead of tinashe lmao

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): decent song but SZA got robbed

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Nice instrumental but I really don’t think this one stands out.

**NuneEtsuko** (7): Not the most exciting song but not too bad either..

**original\_doll** (7): like the 'do you do you do you' part but otherwise the song is kind of unremarkable? idk it's like elevator music to me

**ReallyCreative** (7): Not bad, somewhat generic sounding but it's pretty good. I will say the gray wig/white outfit is legitimately the worst look I've seen in a music video in a while

**VodkaInsipido** (7): did sza die for this

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6.7): this was sultry. nice.

**kappyko** (6.5): why is the chorus so quiet

**nooodisaster** (6.5): The "do you do you do you wanna be" hook almost feels like an interpolation because it's SO MUCH better than the rest of the song.

**notdallin** (6.4): I went back to see what rate this song won and I can’t believe you FLOPS this song won the female R&B debut rate over SZA and Tinashe. Not even the best song on SweetSexySavage (shout out to Advice!)

**Solovrinne** (6.4): A mess, not in a good way.

**radiofan15** (6.2): I guess it's fine but definitely not my style, sorry girl.

**aulyve** (6): Undercover is way better.

**SpanKKy1** (5): tom holland’s booty is a distraction

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I want to give this a 0 out of spite for SZA and Kehlani’s own Undercover being robbed, but I’m not that petty. I am not that petty. This song will always be one of the rate winners I will never get.

**welcometoNY** (5): it's a cute moment but how did this win a rate

**frogaranaman** (3): I got *distracted* and don’t remember any of this song! Hahahaha, haha.. Hah. I have ADHD.

**gannade** (2): I never did understand kehlanis music, this included. its okay but against 49 other rate winners?

**JohnnyBAverage** (0): this is a petty 0, but this song beat a sza song so...

**Therokinrolla** (3): List of Things Miss Rokin Has Done In His Life:

[  ] Had an emo phase

[  ] Heard Welcome To The Black Parade before this rate

[  ] Enjoyed emo music in general that wasn't Born This Way era Lady Gaga

[X] Given this song a bad score in this rate

So I may not be the best person to write this blurb where I am supposed to be praising this song. However, I am considerably better suited for this than Britney stan and KPop extraordinaire letsallpoo, because I HAVE actually stanned Paramore.

So why do I think this song struck a chord in teens across the nation? Well 1.) is the incredible amount of black on the cover, in the video, and even in the name. 2.)? I really don't know. Maybe it's the feeling of power hearing that "We'll carry on" hook gives. Maybe its the feeling of security and self-worth this very left of center song about a dying man gives the outcast listener. Maybe it's just a fucking jam. But these are but ponderings of a lowly gay who spent his time during this period of music learning all the words to Fergalicious.

# Welcome

**1313Harbor** (10): Maybe not my favorite song in the rate, but I have to support my 14 year old self. No voice gives me goosebumps like Gerard’s.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): the OG emo rate introduced me to this song, and god i did not regret it. It's such an amazing epic bop.

**animefangrant62** (10): better than bohemian rhapsody

**camerinian** (10): I’m a borderline Gen Z who hates every other Gen Z born after me of course I love this song what u mean

**CarlieScion** (10): i love being emo

**enecks** (10): this iconic banger defined an entire musical note. When will your faves?

**ExtraEater** (10): queen, 2006

**frogaranaman** (10): https://youtu.be/1QlJbpwZvxE

**ImADudeDuh** (10): The bohemian rhapsody of emo.

**lunasaflowers** (10): There are gonna be people in this rate conspiring against this song, and those people are wrong. My Chemical Romance have always deserved more respect than they've gotten, The Black Parade is hands down one of the best rock albums of the 2000s, and this is a classic song.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): that hook is really infectious oh my

**mysario** (10): Okay now this is epic. For real, this is one of the best "emo" songs and one of the best 00's rock songs in general

**nooodisaster** (10): One of the only emo/punk songs I both ironically and UNironically love. This is just a quality song about accepting death while also being a fun meme song to scream on a road-trip.

**original\_doll** (10): everyone turns emo when listening to this, it's that iconic

**Roxieloxie** (10): another 11 but it brought back too many memories of 7th grade so i had to give it a 10. I suddenly need to grow back my fringe and have the urge to go to hot topic.

**skargardin** (10): Middle-school me from ten years ago would kill me  if I did not give this a 10

**strawberryswing1** (10): I still think Sugar, We're Goin Down deserved but this song is epic and the definition of a 10.

**teenage\_meme** (10): i remember listening to this in the car when i was 15 on the way to get some more inking pens for my manga.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Hey I'm not gonna be ashamed of my MCR era cause they made some fucking JAMS. This was the Bohemian Rhapsody for angsty twinks and scene girls in the same way SICKO MODE is the Bohemian Rhapsody for 17 year old twitter hypebeasts.

**twat\_brained** (10): I swear to God that G note absolutely sends me. I listened to TBP to listen to music for art class once but I don't think I was in the right headspace. I know that I *love* this and Teenagers, but I've never really given much thought to the rest of their discography. I'll listen to their This Is playlist on Spotify after this and reignite the emo phase I started when I wore out Blurryface. On a personal note, I'm certain I will have a day when I've just had enough and will cease to exist. If/when that happens, I want this playing at my funeral.

**stansymash** (9.7): you can hear the metronome at the beginning! haha amateurs, garbage song for garbage people (the twist is that i'm a garbage person)

**dramiaa** (9.5): I don’t care what yall think, this is a great piece of work, as is the whole Black Parade album. The change of pace throughout the song, from the piano intro that transitions into the verses to the chant-y end, its all very well thought out. Also bonus points for actually living up to the “parade” title, by incorporating parade-y drums and such in the track

**HoodooMooJuice** (9.5): Confession: I have never listened to TBP until now, so... Edit: It's pretty good, I might check them out later.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): whatabanger

**1998tweety** (9.4): This song is pretty different from my usually listening, but I could see myself adding it to a playlist. Its got multiple hooks and the multiple switch-ups are pretty cool.

**radiofan15** (9.2): Back in the day MCR was my favorite band on the strength of Helena and Ghost Of You (those were different times) and Black Parade was hard to process at the time... and even if it's my favorite song from them right, I still have this weird feeling of disassociation everytime I listen to it because of that experience

**aulyve** (9): g......f#,b,e.......d, g, c................b, e, a................d..............................WH

**literally100bees** (9): Love the emo shit

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Apparently most people on the Discord dislike this. Here's my verdict: what the fuck, people? Why? You might not have good memories of pop punk and emo scenes, but even if it isn't your thing, Welcome To The Black Parade isn't terrible. The dramatic, Bohemian Rhaspody-esque story it builds up seems a little overwrought when you aren't actually listening to the song and just recalling the lyrics by themselves, which makes it a wonder that the song isn't considered cringe for the most part, but that's because Gerard Way (who I consider a genuinely good vocalist) makes everything sound like a grand, sweeping tale instead of some fanfic from 2005. The instruments are also fantastic, starting from a few piano chords everybody on earth knows at this point and then culminating in the guitar that accompanies that epic climax. I mean, I'm not gonna lie,mI can see why y'all hate it, but I can't. Also, this is (arguably) one of the first ever pop hits by a nonbinary person, so pay respect, folks!



# Goodbye

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (7): I always preferred Panic at the Disco...

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): I don't get the appeal of this song but it's alright

**notdallin** (6.2): Such an anthemic opening that kind of devolves into furiously rehashed emo tripe—which has never really been my bag. Not surprised at the rate that it won but it doesn’t stand a chance among the popheads greats.

**chihuahuazero** (6): Interesting piece of pop-punk, but it’s usually not my genre.

**jamesfog** (6): Helena is better.

**MashLuke** (6): not about this life

**MrSwearword** (6): still anthemic but yikes the AGGRO DREDGE is coming back and that's the thing that had me hate that album.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): look, i'm a fan of pop-punk, but I'm not a big fan of this song ok

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Honestly, was this really better than I Write Sins Not Tragedies 🤔

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Who let the emos in

**VodkaInsipido** (6): eh

**CopyCatJ** (5): bohemian rhapsody for emos?

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): There’s a reason this song is a meme: it’s not very good.

**raicicle** (5): i never had a pop-punk phase so im going to be unfairly harsh to this for no reason

**PuggleMaster** (4): what the fuck was this.........

**ComeOnAndSlang** (3): goodbye

**gannade** (3): i think the beginning is fine but it kinda devolves into screamo

**GoWestYoungKanye** (0): why did you make me listen to a mcr song it is 2018 i hate you fucking emo bitches

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (0): Sorry I can't stand pretentious emo music

**Tedyonce** (0): Oh God

Therokinrolla: **rotating3Dtext** (9): I was never an emo but it good

**shipsinker44** (9): my emo ass still listens to this occassionally

**sighcology** (9): could have been a 10 but i fell over when performing it once and its forever ruined a little bit

**Solovrinne** (9): I know how influential this song was to our young, impressionable minds in the mid 2000's. It is what it is. Rock on.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): an anthem but i can't fully relate bc i'm not emo

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Is this the emo kids version of Bohemian Rhapsody?

**FireLordAegon** (8.3): The reason I can tell a G by ear. Perfect pitch who?

**amacaroon** (8): I feel like I need to listen to this in a movie theater or something

**JohnnyBAverage** (8): My memoir will be called: my life as a young emo, and somehow I can’t give my full support to this song. Is this because I was a fall out boy stan in the sixth grade? Probably, but also, might not be the best MCR era. It was cool to show off to people i could play that opening rff though

**SpanKKy1** (8): I wasn’t sad enough to listen to this when I was younger

>I think Do I Wanna Know’s win was never in doubt for me or kappy, or anyone who participated in 2013 Alt Rock. That said, it was well deserved - the song and its parent album, AM, kickstarted most of the indie rock revolution that swept through angsty teen-infested corners of the internet in the early 2010s, with Alex Turner’s smooth drawl lazily winding itself around a laid back, groovy guitar riff, and a powerful and catchy chorus, it cements itself as one of this decade’s most influential rock songs. While DIAWK was not a surprising winner (almost to the point of ridicule), it was both a welcomed and deserved one - /u/fourchip
>
>"Do I Wanna Know?" was basically destined to win the rate from the very beginning. Everybody shat on the 1975's pitchy vocals, no /r/indieheads kids decided to help out Vampire Weekend, and the Neighbourhood just flat out sucked. While AM remains loathed by the ever self-important hipster community, "Do I Wanna Know?" remains some of my favorite pop rock songs of the 2010s because it does everything so amazingly right. That loud, stadium-ready beat? Those sexy guitar riffs? Alex Turner's deep crooning? God, what a song! It's definitely not for everybody, but for anybody who loves a good stomper this song is hard to beat. It's bound to be remembered as one of those classic 2010s songs, even if it didn't get too high on the Hot 100. Do I Wanna Know? is a song that shows that the alternative side of music still has importance in this decade's cultural zeitgeist.
>
>Hosting this rate with /u/fourchip was kind of crazy. I kind of went through a breakdown near the end but the podium sweep of Arctic Monkeys at the end is just iconic. /u/fourchip is a great guy and I feel so bad about how little I appreciated him during our rate reveal. Thank you so much for what you did, man! As much as I wish Vampire Weekend won or that "Heart Out was the top 1975 song, I can't say that I have too much to complain about. Shout out to the /r/music_survivor server for shitting on the rate idea, though. Suck my dick, the whole point of the rate was how incongruous the albums were together to an /r/indieheads rat. - /u/kappyko

**letsallpoo** (10): If you were on Tumblr in 2013, then you know this "Do I Wanna Know?". The word I would use to describe this song is *intense*. The steady beat, the ominous and sparse guitar chords, the wistful but strangely foreboding vocal delivery — they combine here to make something that's dark yet irresistable. This song deserved to go way further than it did!

# I Do

**CarlieScion** (10): KINGS

**chihuahuazero** (10): Although it’s considered a selling out by some fans, AM was one of the albums that got me into the rock side of alternative rock. Its opener starts strong with that compressed stomp-clap, deranged guitarplay, and Alex Turner’s ability to make you swoon over an attempted relationship rebound.

**followingfreeways** (10): whatever i dont care if my inner 13 yr old w all of AM illegally downloaded onto my ipod touch is coming out... this song still sounds fresh today

**frogaranaman** (10): This song screams “girl who wears a choker and has close to a thousand followers on her aesthetic Instagram by junior year of high school that is massively depressed” to me and it’s oddly comforting.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): When i heard this on tumblr and my wig immediately went flying.

**lunasaflowers** (10): I have a very complex relationship with this song, because I associate it pretty strongly with a time in my life when I didn't know where my on-off relationship with someone was, whether they still were into me, and I knew in my heart it was dead but I didn't want to ask because I didn't want to know what the truth was. But what can I say, it speaks to me.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): i want Alex Turner to fist me

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Don't get me wrong this is a 10 but R U Mine outsold.

**NuneEtsuko** (10): The ultimate song to pretend you're a badass character in a movie. Love love love it.

**rickikardashian** (10): This defined an era. Tumblr was never the same after this was dropped. Girls bought black lipstick and did coke like crazy. Artic Monkey was for Tumblr girls what Drake is for guys on twitter now

**shipsinker44** (10): i feel so basic giving this a ten but its actually stellar and it used to be exclusively what i listened to

**skargardin** (10): iconic

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Me when there’s a situation where I’m questioning whether I want to know more about or not

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Easily one of their best singles and songs in general. One of Alex Turner's sexiest vocal performances, that intoxicating vocal riff, and the explosive chorus. I love all the peaks and lows of the song, it makes it kind of unique and unpredictable for a rock song.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): i forgot this indie stage of my life

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): banger.

**1998tweety** (9.4): Sweater Weather was robbed. This still bops though.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.4): I saw them do this live at a festival just after the album came out and yes it banged yes I was like 16 yes I wanted to fuck the greasy version of Alex Turner 😎

**AbnormalPopPunk** (9): you can not look me in the eye and tell me your head is not bopping back and forth listening to this song

**camerinian** (9): That riff is iconic and honestly no other male voice arouses me as much as Alex Turner, and here is one of his most seductive performances ever. Tbh I prefer the songs from AM with more energy like Snap Out Of It and R U Mine, but this is a monster and a half

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (9): this is the only Arctic Monkeys song I like so I'm glad it's here

**gannade** (9): What is this straight music? It's really moody and nice background music

# I Don't

**MashLuke** (7.5): not my thing

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): It's good but the beat gets old after a while

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7): i mean... it is a song... i guess.. saw them live recently and honestly the song is like a 9 live, but digitally it's not that universally likable

**aulyve** (7): Still mad about how this rate went!!!!!!!!!!

**moooo566** (7): Call me back when I can rate Mardy Bum

**MrSwearword** (7): the guitar is great, but this goes nowhere for me.

**Roxieloxie** (7): my best friend in 7th grade loved AM but she was a bitch so this brings back memories of that time

**teenage\_meme** (7): flashbacks to 2013 tumblr; photosets of leather jackets and cigarettes and smudged lipstick; "let's make out to AM"

**FireLordAegon** (6.3): This song got me into AM, but it's not my favorite by a long shot.

**radiofan15** (5.8): I never understood why this song was so popular... I can find that same chorus in at least 50 other "indie" songs and the lyrics are serviceable at best.

**JohnnyBAverage** (5.5): The weird thing is, I usually am into rock and basic alternative sounds. I remember when the Arctic Monkeys were the cool thing to like, and even though I did my best to be into it back in those days I never got and i still don’t. Like c’mon either take the Black Keys or Arcade Fire, don’t combine them to just create something lesser than. It’s fine

**dropthehammer11** (5): this isnt bad but i honestly find this brand of indie rock super boring

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (5): I love countryheads

**ComeOnAndSlang** (4): arctic shunkeys

**enecks** (4): This song's so heterosexual it spat in my face and called me a slur then proceeded to drink-drive to a gender reveal.

**Solovrinne** (4): I... actually hate it. Don't know what to say.

**welcometoNY** (4): i get that this is iconic but i literally already forgot what it sounds like

**notdallin** (3.5): I guess this song appeals to the people who wondered how many possible ‘you’ rhyme combinations Alex Turner can make.

**hikkaru** (3): I fell asleep…

**Shadow1087** (3): kind of droning, it bores me

**SpanKKy1** (3): I wish I didn’t know

**stansymash** (3): this is the best song on AM.

**Tomoki** (1.5): The only thing I wanna know is when the good part starts

**mysario** (0): worse than Arabella

=====

Therokinrolla: **ignitethephoenix** (9): That bass line with the clapping is so good and I love how it carries the song.

**literally100bees** (9): Bass line makes me (s)cream

**static\_int\_husp** (9): The one good song from the Black & White 2013 Indie Rock Rate

**HoodooMooJuice** (8.5): the bassline is pretty good. Kind of reminds me of Big God by FATM for no reason.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Wait I thought this was the Sweater Weather person, I'm shook.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Okay, I think I'm sick of listening to this! I may try to avoid letting bias creeping into my scores, but this is one of the only alternative hits that isn't pop punk that you'll ever hear people below the age of 25 know the lyrics to, and I think a lot of us used to play it a lot a few years ago thinking it was the coolest thing ever. I still think the hollow subtlety of the rhythm is pretty brilliant, making use of Alex Turner's famous Brit voice and quietly introducing some elements to AM that ultimately have their roots in American RnB. The video for this is also transitions from boring to delightfully wild in a special sort of way that has to be seen to be believed. But even if it might be the best song ever for a classroom to clap too, it's still not innovative enough like other songs in this rate to avoid the trap of getting old. It's good, sure, but at this point I only happen to play it in full when I come across it by hitting shuffle. Then again, I'm not a huge rock fan. Maybe I just harbour reverse racism against white people.

**tapdancingpig** (8.2): Wow. This surprised me. The slow beat drives the song forward, the guitar hooks itself inside your brain, and the instrumentation is sparse enough that the lyrics (which are great) can stand out.

**airylnovatech** (8): "Simmer down and f*** er up"

**bespectacIed** (8): Ughhh i'm still fuming vampire weekend didn't win this rate just because popheads wanted to be predictable, but eh this is an iconic song nonetheless

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I’ve never been a fan of the ‘emo indie rock sadboy’ scene that Arctic Monkeys are a part of. That being said, this is the best song to come out of that genre.

**twat\_brained** (8): Two imperfections on this song: the first is when Alex goes from the first half of the second verse to the second half of the verse while elongating one word, and also the outro feels a bit lengthy, only for the song to end abruptly following a, shall we say, less-than-stupendous denouement. It's unquestionably great and far and away the best song the Arctic Monkeys have released. What it's not is perfection, which is *mandatory* to win this rate.

**original\_doll** (7.6): overrated, but still good

**jamesfog** (7.5): A good rock song.

>I knew this song was going to win immediately, as this song fell from number one twice, very briefly at the beginning. But it got to number one, and it stayed there for almost the whole month. And you could see why, compared to the other acts as Fifth Harmony couldn't escape the hate and One Direction's love was spread out over too many songs. But like with Rolling in the Deep, it didn't get a lot of low scores, so the fact that it was so likable, and the fact that this was the Little Mix song really helped it win so easily. - /u/Nerdy_boy_chris
>
>Little Mix, the group that uses witchery not only to make guys fall in love with them, but also to pull off a win on a rate against 10 One Direction songs. Black Magic, a song that seems to be liked by almost everyone for their catchy melodies and fun ~~and lowkey cheesy~~ lyrics. This song is **THE** girlband song, and if any of you bullies decide to do it wrong on this rate, [you will have to face the consequences](https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/07-aAPH6vg-1432927243.gif?quality=.8&height=281&width=5000) - /u/rickikardashian

**letsallpoo** (8): The UK has a [whole lotta history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozx-VvqO_ys) when it comes to girl groups. If you're from there and you're not in middle school, you've likely heard of Girls Aloud, The Saturdays, Sugababes, All Saints, or maybe even Bananarama. If you're not from there, the last UK girl group you might've heard of is probably...the Spice Girls? Unless, of course, you frequent this forum, and you've heard of Little Mix.

"Black Magic" was the closest that Little Mix go to piercing the US market, but its overseas success is a bit overstated - it infamously got outpeaked by the likes of "Hello Kitty" and "Chinese Food." Regardless, the song arguably remains their biggest hit and a career-defining song, earning them another UK #1 and a nomination for Single of the Year at the Brit awards. It's hard to deny its charms - that cheerleader-esque stomping and rallying, the infectious chorus, or that killer bassline. Hopefully someday the US will appreciate bops like this. And considering the song's position here, hopefully someday /r/popheads will too.

# Pierce Piers Morgan's Organ

**Shadow1087** (11): i would've given my 11 to what's it gonna be if it wasn't robbed but nonetheless black magic is just the perfect bop

**1998tweety** (10): Another incredible pop song. Stan Little Mix and stream their new album which is actually out while the reveal is going on.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): this song is surprisingly strong in the context of this rate, definitely deserves a top 20 placement.

**dramiaa** (10): I had only heard bad things about this song, I guess I had been hanging around str8 ppl too much,because this is amazing. Especially the chorus

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Their best? No. Their best on Get Weird? Hell ye.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): u/fax5jrj listen to this song challenge

**MrSwearword** (10): damn, they made a song about witchcraft so fucking catchy.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): I was mad when this ended up winning like people said it would. I'd just discovered Made In The A.M, and boy, did I love that album. I ended up giving a One Direction song in that rate my 11, obviously, and while I still do love their latter-day musical output, I'm freely ready to admit that I should have chosen Black Magic over any songs from the boys. Black Magic is one of the best songs to come from a girl group this century, and it's a perfect testimony to the harmony present among Little Mix's ladies. It's so delightfully carted for the group's teenage fans, combining sugary music with sweet witchcraft references that will have you harkening back to Charmed. Call me crazy, but this is my Halloween anthem.

**rickikardashian** (10): this was honestly such a good rate, props to the hosts:)

**shipsinker44** (10): while this would not have gotten my 11 in its original rate it IS a deserving winner

**Tedyonce** (10): THIS IS POP PERFECTION OH MY GOD

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): /u/TragicKingdom1

**twat\_brained** (10): Perrie, Leigh, Jesy and Jade just throw their entire weight onto this track, and it all blends together so excellently; the harmonies, the guitars, the hooks, I stopped being a Mixer right when their creative stride shone through! This still has nothing on "Touch", though, that shit slaps.

**ZankeeZero** (10): One of the best UK girl group tunes of the 2010s! I still don't think they're this decade's answer to Girls Aloud but they're still great.

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): WHAT A FEELING WAS FUCKING ROBBED IN THIS RATE....but this is a bop though.

**perfumevee** (9.5): So catchy!

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): Can I declare war on Simon Cowell for not properly promoting this in the US?

**stansymash** (9.1): oh my god its this song! i love this song! i had no idea this song was called black magic by little mix but thanks rate for identifying it for me!

**camerinian** (9): Gonna be honest I think the way they stick so heavily to the lyrical theme of this song is kind of goofy but shit it’s so fun i shouldn’t care this much

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): I vastly prefer “Hair” but I certainly didn’t complain when this won

**mysario** (9): watch Sabrina on Netflix

**nooodisaster** (9): I have this under a playlist called "modern 'i wanna dance with somebody'" because of the pure joy I get listening to this, and the perfect pop melodies that accompany it.

**welcometoNY** (9): i will never be over the fact that this beat what a feeling but at least it's a bop

**JohnnyBAverage** (8.7): watch ahs apocalypse on fx

**Solovrinne** (8.6): This song is so silly! I love it.


**original\_doll** (7.3): it's catchy but it's very disney channel

# Piers Morgan Appears To Produce Points

**amacaroon** (7): I don’t like the beginning

**MashLuke** (7): witches

**warmishblood** (7): This song was very overplayed in the UK, but its a bop

**strawberryswing1** (6.5): What a Feeling deserved

**FireLordAegon** (6): I live in the US, so I don't listen to Little Mix, but I really liked this song when I first heard it a few weeks ago... but not so much anymore. I literally got tired of it on the second listen. It's still catchy and enjoyable though.

**ReallyCreative** (6): It's a decent bop but the video is so bad oh my god what kind of Southern California Hogwarts bullshit is this

**selegend** (6): Gives me middle school prom teas but alas a bop

**SpanKKy1** (6): okay so in the music video they use black magic to give an innocent girl irritable bowel syndrome, then whore out other innocent bystanders against their will because they felt bad for a nerd, then lastly interrupts not only a lecture but forces every student to throw their hard work in the air, little mix are domestic terrorists.

**static\_int\_husp** (6): The least deserving rate winner in recent history

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Someone teach me black magic

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5.3): I am still ethically opposed to love potions

**frogaranaman** (5): No wonder they can never succeed in the U.S.

**gannade** (3.5): local mix appropriating voodoo culture smh. the song is sweet as confection but i thought this was artisticallly a step back after their debut and Move. i guess i was wrong since it was such a big hit, but I think Shoutout to My Ex was a much stronger version of the bubblegum pop vibe they were going for here

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (3): This sounds like Cher Lloyd, maybe Poo snapped

**ComeOnAndSlang** (1): oof

**cyborglilith** (1): No thanks!

**notdallin** (0): I know all of these songs won rates and stuff blah blah blah but this song still gets my 0

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (0): I haven't given a 0 in so long, I think it's about time to bring it back

>***Heartless***, was the second single from *808s & Heartbreaks* and debuted at #4 on the Hot 100. To its release it received much critic praise. The song itself uses auto-tune as a tool to help provide a unique sound to drive home Kanye’s feelings of his breakup throughout the song. The song became Kanye’s second highest debut on Billboard and fluctuated in and out the top 10 before hitting its peak at 2 in February 2009. Paired with a video that used rotoscope animation and acted as a partial tribute to the film American Pop, the two make a combo that are hard to forget and are considered a staple in late 00s culture, along with the album *808s & Heartbreak* itself. - /u/ResTheHesitantAlien

**Therokinrolla** (8): Before we get into it I just wanna say i find it really clever that this songs artwork is literally [heartless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartless_(Kanye_West_song)#/media/File:Kanyewestheartless.png), whereas a motif of this era was that weird wrinkly heart thing.

Anyways, before the whole Trump era Kanye and honestly let's go before TLOP era Kanye as well, one of the most shocking things Kanye did in his career was stray from his previous soundscape into the world of autotune, electronica, and pop, and this was not taken too well at first. Auto tune was still a very dirty word used by pop pessimists that didn't really understand what they were complaining about. This was 2008, when Katy was still a punkish pop star with shaky vocals, Britney was on top of the charts with Circus, Womanizer, and 3, schoolboys everywhere were complaining about Miley Cyrus and PITUSA, and Gaga wasn't out of the closet as a vocalist. This? This was a strange look for Kanye, and in theory, a fucking wacky move commercially. He was moving into the audience of soccor moms and general pop fans thought he was a pompous ass with no talent, and alienated the music snobs who appreciated his music for his artistic merit.

And he fucking did it?!?!? It became one of his biggest hits yet (and still to this day is), peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and 808s is now considered to be one of his most intricate works. Say what you want about this Republican, but his musical talent is undeniable, and his ability to smash both expectations AND the charts is really something else. This song is a staple of his discography and the pop music landscape of the late 2000s.

# Kan-Yay!

**MashLuke** (11): that bitch did not need to hurt him like that

**amacaroon** (10): This is probably my 4th favorite song off this album. Still a 10

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): I know this is Popheads’ favorite album by him and we’re right, it’s one of his best. This is a great song despite what others will tell you

**dropthehammer11** (10): listen yall can say what you want about kanye but dont forget that this man is a musical genius kthx

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): 808s is a top two kanye album, u can throw your tomatoes now

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Who would have thought that one of Kanye’s more memorable songs would be one of the more poppier ones that was a drastic change from everything else he was doing. Normally auto tune bugs me, but I think that this song does auto tune correctly.

**MrSwearword** (10): Kanye's best song [yes, he's a complete fucking idiot as of late]

**mysario** (10): peak Kanye

**radiofan15** (10): FUCK YEAH KANYE! This is my favorite Kanye pop song and such a highlight on his already brilliant discography... Also the sample of Alan Parsons Project is brilliant and I never heard anyone mention it (it's not even in the Wiki page despite how prominent it is)... also also the line "How could you be so Dr. Evil?" was originally "fucking evil" but Mr. Hudson convince him to change it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): but in the end it's still so lonely :(

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Kanye's best pure pop track. The main vocal melody is so catchy and the beat is one of his more simplistic productions but it's no less effective.

**ZankeeZero** (10): ugh just want him back...

**camerinian** (9.5): I’ll admit I prefer Kanye at his more experimental and wild, but this is an iconic track and basically responsible for most of the modern rap/rnb hybrid scene, so make of that what you will

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): a classic despite anything kanye says or does

**stansymash** (9.1): if you pretend he's singing this song to mike myers it makes one line somewhat funnier and thats about it so maybe dont do that

**shipsinker44** (9): i cant believe u guys tricked me into listening to kanye west in 2018

**tapdancingpig** (9): I wanted to hate this song. I hate Kanye as a person, and as a result, I have avoided his music to the best of my ability. I legitimately only heard this song from Kris Allen because my dad was obsessed with it. But this song... everything about it is so good! I can’t rate this anything lower than a 9!

**VodkaInsipido** (9): love lockdown is still better but not mad

**1998tweety** (8.7): This feels very poppy for Kanye's standards.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Kanye doesn't sound like a total douchebag here, what a revelation. It sounds like he's coming from a genuine place of heartbreak, and you can tell he misses his ex. His use of what I think is a panflute here is also rather peculiar for a pop song. Or at least semi-pop.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Ugh, I used to love Kanye as a musician, but I'm going to have to try really hard not to judge his winning songs based on his recent behaviour. Anyway, the man is still a genius of a musician, even if he's quite the ass, and thought 808s and Heartbreaks is a record I've always respected more for its influence than enjoyed, I view Heartless as a constant reminder of why so many people declare the era to be one of his best. Utilizing the most critically acclaimed use of Autotune since Cher, Heartless repeats the juxtaposition between Kanye's artificial vocals and his lyrics, further anticipating his growing sense of numbness. Another thing I commend about this song is the fact that Kanye concentrates on his emotions here, without resorting to the slightly misogynistic insults present in some of his other hits. This is a pop song through and through, and after a few listens, you realize it's quite the innovative one.


# How could you be so-

**WilsonJason** (6): kanye schooling us on how shitty vocal effects can ruin songs

**gannade** (5): its catchy but the autotune is a turn off.

**literally100bees** (4): :/

**CarlieScion** (3): hello autotune

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (3): would've been a 10 if not for... you know...

**ImADudeDuh** (3): Another song I legit don't like. The overuse of autotune has always turned me off to the song, which is weird cause of the people i know that hate kanye, this is the normally the only kanye song they like.

**selegend** (3): Autotuned mess

**rickikardashian** (2.5): what rate did this win? did it really not have anything better?

**enecks** (2): Weakest song in 808's, and extremely whiny.

**Bendariaku89** (1): the chorus sounds awful with the odd autotune that’s there somehow? the verses bore me. it’s boring. the bridge is fine, but then the chorus comes back in, which then gets irritating. the lyrics are nice, but the whole just doesn’t give it anything.

**nooodisaster** (1): One song has to get the Kanye hate train, and I nominate this one. It's a pretty standard pop song and the only clever thing is its single cover. #DumpTrump

# heartless?

**amumumyspiritanimal** (0): I'm heartless and this song always annoyed me. I understand why people like Kanye but his voice, his production, his style, and his soundbites are just really annoying. Also, overdone autotuned choruses are my biggest musical pet peeve since Cher's Believe. The song doesn't work for me at all, and let's not even talk about Kanye's personality and other stuff.

**cyborglilith** (0): nah

**ReallyCreative** (0): I can't stand any part of this song it's just so god awful. The lyrics are garbage, the sound is grating, it feels like the longest sub-4 minute song I've ever heard, and if that wasn't terrible enough everyone and their fucking hamster wants to cover THIS song for some reason

Therokinrolla: 
**JohnnyBAverage** (8.1): My complicated relationship with Kanye West continues. There was a point in my life where I really related with this song, but yeah don’t really fuck with this kind of stuff anymore. (See what I rated it though? God I'm such an artist)

**dramiaa** (8): This is actually a great pop song

**frogaranaman** (8): You know who else is heartless? That’s right, the Republican party. If you’re American, please go vote in November it is extremely imperati

**LandonKidatrea** (8): Ansem Seeker of Darkness is shook. Maleficent found dead in Hollow Bastion.

**notdallin** (8): there can be no understating the impact that 808s & Heartbreak has had on 2010s hip hop—minimalistic production, rappers spilling their emotions rather than puffing out their chests, and of course, it singlehandedly made autotuned rapping cool and a legitimate mode of filtering vocals. Heartless may or may not be the epitome of that style, but it’s the most popular one, and I guess I can deal with that.

**Roxieloxie** (8): i want to hear a mash up of this and umbrella

**SpanKKy1** (8): my inner year 6 is quaking

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): 💔

**FireLordAegon** (7.5): classic Kanye

**jamesfog** (7.5): Blassic

**lunasaflowers** (7.5): Good song, but Flashing Lights is better IMO.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (6.9): I never knew this was Kanye until now


**HoodooMooJuice** (6.5): Kanye's not my thing

**kappyko** (6): I love most of Kanye's discog but like I don't care for any of his winning songs that much lmfao

**Solovrinne** (6): The verses bang but I despise the chorus with a passion, perhaps because of how much it was overplayed.

**letsallpoo** (10): This song is so good that it kept people interested in an artist who did jack shit for five years. Issues with her label continue to plague Sky Ferraria, but even if she never releases a song again, she'll still be remembered for this incredible tune. It's not only an amazing distillation of Sky's strengths, as an artist who can evoke moodiness with a veneer of cool, but also a great representation of producer Ariel Rechtshaid, the basis of the rate this song won. Here's hoping she actually releases something this winter!

---
# Sky-high

**pickupthephonebaby** (11): i would like to marry this song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): Call me pitchfork-core but this is quite possibly the best pop song of the 2010s

**bluehxrizon** (10): who cares if masochism ever comes out this is her peak

**FireLordAegon** (10): Perfect pop song. I love the bridge

**JohnnyBAverage** (10): one of my favorite songs of all time too bad where’s the album Sky

**Leixander** (10): repetitiveness in this song just makes it even better somehow

**MrSwearword** (10): hello song I softened up to by the time the original rate you were in came up. Good to hear you again.

**notdallin** (10): It’s been so long since a real Sky release that this song feels like a rare gem, like maybe we’ll never reach these heights ever again simply because of a lack of material. WE MUST TREASURE THIS SONG AT ALL COSTS.

**stansymash** (10): would be an 11 in any other feasible rate but popheads hates me so i have to give this incredible achievement a weakass 10

**Tedyonce** (10): Dev Hynes has perfect production, and Ferreira serves gorgeous vocals and harmonies

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Such a perfect 80s throwback in a great modern indie pop presentation. Sky's moody, reverby vocals fit the style so amazingly, and she'd go on to really perfect it on Night Time, My Time. Ariel Rechtshaid and Dev Hynes teaming up is a match made in heaven, and it does not disappoint. Easily one of her best songs, although I wish You're Not the One or I Will took this rate.

**twat\_brained** (10): You don't know what you have until it's gone. That's unfortunately the case with Sky; she had some great music and apart from Baby Driver, she's basically nowhere nowadays. How can we get her back to the world of music? There's too much moodiness without any poptimism too offset it.

**Solovrinne** (9.8): Her best work of course. I'm a sucker for synths.

**bespectacIed** (9.5): So frustrated that I can't give miss part-time musician a 10 because the superior you're not the one lost

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): the real embarassment is sky and her label

**1998tweety** (9.2): Wow these lyrics are so relatable.

**CarlieScion** (9): this is good but why does it sound like she recorded the vocals in her bathroom

**MashLuke** (9): everything about her label certainly is

**mysario** (9): a mood

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Ah, Sky Ferriera. Once an up and coming alt pop musician with a lot of hype attached to her image. Now a meme thanks to pop music's very own Winds of Winter. Sad, right? I do wish Sky would hurry up and release Machoism, because I enjoyed listening to Night Time, My Time. Everything Is Embarrassing is widely considered the best song Sky's ever released in her minimal discography, so it's a bit puzzling to paste a song like it onto the album's deluxe version, but the track is a lot softer than most of the record, presenting itself as synth and soft over hard and heavy. Perhaps that's why it won over glossy pop tracks like Nuclear Seasons or If I Could Change Your Mind. There's a sensitivity here that even Sky's detractors respect here, both in the music itself and the track's vocals, and despite the messy state of mind shown in the lyrics it manages to come off as a gentle gush of overwhelming feelings of insecurity. A song as beautiful as this definitely deserves to be played along with an orchestra.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (8): didn't really hear this song prior but it's really great, definitely deserves a high placement.

**enecks** (8): This will totally be an accurate description of the rate results

**followingfreeways** (8): wow I genuinely havent listened to this song in 5 years

**literally100bees** (8): Oh this is good

**nooodisaster** (8): I definitely don't get the hype of this being the best song of the decade or whatever, but it's good enough.

**Roxieloxie** (8): another chill bop

**tapdancingpig** (8): I’m not sure I’ve ever heard an 80’s beat like this on a song this depressing before.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): This sounds like Forever 21 music, not that it’s a bad thing, but it just seems like background music to me (even if it’s good).

**radiofan15** (7.8): Ok, I was ready to dismiss this one as another one of those leftovers of direct-to-TV teenager film soundtracks that have been appearing here but I was actually charmed of how much I truly enjoyed this song (I never heard it before this rate)... now I gonna have to start listening to Sky Ferreira

# You are the reason we will never get Masochism

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): it’s not bad, I just wish it was… more

**jamesfog** (7.5): A bop, but HAIM or You're Not The One deserved to win

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): same lmfao

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): It’s an alright song but I can’t see myself listening to it much in the future.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its ok but an iconic title

**chihuahuazero** (6): Remember when a bonus track won a rate?

**camerinian** (5): I have never got the appeal of Sky Ferreira, and this song is doing nothing to convince me. This sounds like a third-rate Haim song where they just forgot to write a prominent melody for anything other than the vocals

**J\_Toe** (5): what does it mean when Youtube says Pitchfork officially released this song?

**raicicle** (5): people thinking this is the best song of the millennium is REAL tea when solange and dev literally made losing you which is just the same song but better in every possible way

**shipsinker44** (5): that was forgettable

**frogaranaman** (3): This is *almost* a song.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (2): i have never and will never see the appeal in sky ferreira. this song is incredibly bland and goes nowhere, like most of the album.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (2): i don’t remember who does the maths but, the maths: sky is a 1, those drums are a 1, i’m nice so i’ll give it a 4, that’s a 2

**SpanKKy1** (2): sky ferreira’s career is embarrassing

**gannade** (1): I honestly detest this song. it feels like one note over and over and over and over and over and over and over

**sighcology** (0): i am spiteful and hate sky with a passion

notdallin: REALLY late to this but reading through I canNOT with this slander so I'm just gonna subtweet all you guys who gave this song a bad score because of either (1) PETTY saltiness that it won over the actual album tracks  (the best song is the best song on the rate--bonus tracks are not just included as red shirts, they CAN win alright?); (2) STUPID "embarrassing" puns having to do with her career that are neither funny nor hot takes in 2018; (3) thinking "Losing You" is better and comparing them just because of the Dev Hynes beat  (even if they could be compared, Solange is objectively more monotone and sedated in that song than in Everything Is Embarrassing); and (4) whoever compared her to HAIM must have LITERALLY never listened to HAIM before because they are NOTHING alike--not even in the same genre friend! Thanks for playing but y'all are tasteless 5 year olds for letting such petty reasons keep you from rating this song 8+

>In my initial rate, I pegged Ultralight Beam as a pretty obvious winner contender. It’s got a fantastic Chance the Rapper verse, subdued but beautiful production, and a soaring finale with a gospel choir. In many ways, it’s representative of Kanye’s artistic style from the early to mid 2010s: he features on it as just one piece of the puzzle, allowing Chance, Kelly Price, Kirk Franklin, The Dream, and the choir to take the spotlight while he stands back. Pablo was a chaotic album and a chaotic era, released actually unfinished, but now it’s almost quaint and nostalgic. Ultralight Beam is only two and a half years old, but it feels like a lifetime ago that Kanye had the world briefly behind him, before “slavery was a choice”, “free thinking”, Candace Owens, and wearing the damn hat everywhere. Kanye’s been subject to a lot of deserved criticism this year and burned a lot of bridges to both other artists and fans (including me after the latest run of awful public statements), but I guess sometime’s it’s nice to think back to the innocent days of “BILL COSBY INNOCENT !!!!!!!”. - /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus

---

**Therokinrolla** (9): Kanye is an established shape-shifter, able to proclaim himself a God and make the locals call him a flurry of derogatory things one day, and then the next make the most stunning and profound God-praising song that I've ever heard. Kanye's production is held back and restrained and let's his voice, the features, and the choirs do the work. And GOd I just feel the connection there. Kanye has made something generally intangible (his connection to God) incredibly tangible. I'm not exactly religious, but Ultralight Beam makes me want to believe in whatever makes him feel compelled to create this masterpiece.

---

#Ultralight people

**AbnormalPopPunk** (11): picking my 11 was extremely difficult for this rate, but objectively, this song is just absolutely perfect. the structure, production, performance, lyrics, everything. the features are perfectly placed and executed, and kanye's not too bad himself.

**amacaroon** (10): I listen to a lot of gospel music for a 20 year old half Jewish atheist and this one one of the most catchy gospel-y songs I’ve ever heard. Also, Chance’s part is iconic

**Bendariaku89** (10): this song is absolutely amazing, no denying. the message of course works for those who agree, though i can’t say i do, especially that line about questioning god which apparently we’re supposed to just accept. maybe that’s just my own beliefs conflicting with the song. regardless of what i believe though, ultralight beam is amazing to listen to, even if i can’t relate to the lyrics at all.

**camerinian** (10): A beautiful holy track to open an unholy mess of an album

**dropthehammer11** (10): listen yall can say what you want about kanye but dont forget that this man is a musical genius kthx [3]

**radiofan15** (10): No matter how messy TLOP is overall, I'm glad it exists as it proves Kanye can still create magic even in his most unreliable moments. Even if it's a weird choice as an album opener, UB is such an experience, a powerful track that even non-religious people can fully embrace; the first time I heard it took my breath away, and still does... so many of UB's elements shouldn't work and yet Kanye's manic magic somehow made them all great.... also I'm curious on Bieber's contributions (unreleased so far) to the track, which up to this days remains rotting in Kanye's vault.

**Roxieloxie** (10): fuck this is really good ~~lol remember when harry styles gentrified this song~~

**sbb618** (10): The Life of Pablo is a great album for roughly six minutes, until Kanye's verse on Father Stretch My Hands kicks in. But Ultralight Beam just blows you away right from the start.

**stansymash** (10): this song title is dumb but the song is good

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I miss the old Kanye, rename the album Kanye / The messy rollout and not Trump talk Kanye

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): ugh i love gospel music

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): It feels like it's been about 10 years in Kanye time since this song come out, but I don't think it makes it any less beautiful. Kanye's status as a "curator" in the early to mid 2010s is pretty much on display in its best version here, as the main spotlight is given to the various guest vocalists and Kanye is pretty much absent from the song after the two minute mark. It's an interesting decision for an album opener, but it definitely works out as everyone comes in and kills it, especially Chance who drops one of his best verses ever. It's a touching, subtly produced, amazing opener, and while I didn't give this my 11 in my first rate I was more than happy with it winning.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): a classic despite anything kanye says or does [3]

**VodkaInsipido** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/291004511000985600/508053962394566676/deepfry.png

**aulyve** (9.5): Remember when Kanye's lovey spiritual vibe translated to good music?

**Dracyoshi** (9.5): I'm not religious... but I feel so moooved... Makes me wanna praaaayyyyy~!

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This song has the power to take non-believers to church. I think the song definitely benefits from having minimal Kanye parts, and focusing more on all the supporting players. That church inspired production is just so good.

**lunasaflowers** (9.3): goddamn, kanye!!!!!!!!!!

**1998tweety** (9): The choir adds a lot to this song.

**frogaranaman** (9): Chance, if you’re reading this, I’m ready to ask for forgiveness. I’m sorry. Please unblock me so we can talk it out.

**HoodooMooJuice** (9): Three kanye songs... c'mon. Anything gospel is great though.

**nooodisaster** (9): Chancey steals the spotlight here. It's in the same vein as Runaway, epic masterpiece, but it's a lot less personal and thematically weaker to me. Soft DumpTrump.

**Solovrinne** (9): Yeah okay. Now this is good. A really strong opener, it captivates you and prepares you for the ride.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): And, the night before I typed this out, Kanye officially announced he was withdrawing from politics, making all my previous comments about his entries semi-useless! Womp, womp. Ah, well. Ultralight Beam was Kanye's first ever song to take the winning trophy, but, unfortunately, I actually think it's the worst. Of course, this has nothing to do with the song's religious imagery, which I like for personal reasons (I share the same faith as Chance, though I don't know what the heck Kanye believes in) or the fact that this is a much more straightforward rap song than either Heartless, which borderlines into being a pop hit, or Runaway, which transcends genre on its own. There are many things here that make it a song that deserves its title, though, ironically enough, it's not Kanye that shines on the song, but Chance, and the glorious chorus that accompanies it. The song's just a little too lowkey for me. It's a bit of a sincere, slowly burning candle, which is great, but I was in the mood for a fire. Maybe I was just too spoiled by Jesus Walks.

#Ultraheavy people

**amumumyspiritanimal** (4): ugh this song annoys me to Hell and I have no idea how y'all made it win a rate.

**FireLordAegon** (4): I haven't heard a lot of TLOP, but I didn't really like this. I am kinda surprised cause I usually really like kanye. I did think the rap near the end was cool.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (3.1): I actually don’t like Ultralight Beam at all. I remain a pre Pablo Kanye stan. Also why is Chance’s voice Like That.

**twat\_brained** (0): Harry Styles covered this so I'm guessing it's important. I'm not sure why there's a screaming child in the beginning, nor what the screaming choir at the end is supposed to do. More than anything it just hurts my eardrums. In fact, all I hear is just a preachy ass song about Christianity that seems more like it's on the side of attempting to convert those rather than detail how enlightening religion is to them. I love you, Harry, but the only rate winner I want to hear you cover is The Chain. Anyways stream Delicate, a single from Reputation, which sold 2,000,000 copies in the U.S. compared to just 1,000,000 from TLOP 😘

Therokinrolla: **JohnnyBAverage** (8.9): True story: The first time I heard this was during Yeezy Season 3 or whatever that fashion show was, sitting on the back of the bus waiting to get to class - no lie i started to cry. Nothing had touched me like that in a long time. Unfortunately, Kanye has really done a number on what it means to follow him lately and I don’t fuck with any of that. In this essay, I decide whether to rate the art removed from the artist, and ngl: I don’t know if I can.

**MashLuke** (8): somehow that messy album cover became "in", fashion is an interesting world

**mysario** (8): overrated album

**cyborglilith** (7.5): highkey annoying

**notdallin** (7.1): like most of The Life of Pablo, this song feels unfinished to me—the bare bones of something greater. Kanye mumbles in spaces that feel like placeholders for future work but are chosen to be left in. Artistic choice? Lazy forgetfulness? A way to make a clearly spiritual song rawer or choral-esque? You choose.

**Piccprincess** (7): Why did this win? Fade is way better than this lol

**chihuahuazero** (6): This song hasn’t clicked with me. I appreciate its ambitions, but put this alongside “Runaway” and you see the difference. With Kanye’s antics lately, it’ll likely stay that way.


**tapdancingpig** (8): Holy shit! This song is SO GOOD! The only thing I don’t love about it is that HE DIDN’T CREDIT ANYONE AS A FEATURED ARTIST! And there are a LOT of featured artists. Everyone else does as much to make the song as amazing as it is as Kanye does. WHAT THE FUCK, YE?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Jet fuel can’t melt ultra light beams

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Not a fan. Chance’s verse saves this from a lower score.

**jamesfog** (6): I like it but it is nowhere near as good as other songs in the rate. Fuck Christians !

**literally100bees** (6): Oh Kanye

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (5): Chance's verse is good

**enecks** (5): It's a god dream alright. Because this shit puts me to sleep.

**MrSwearword** (5): originally, I gave this three points higher, but on a listen long after the rate, it doesn't hold up the same.

**shipsinker44** (5): this was my LEAST favorite song from tlop

chihuahuazero: I just realized that Kanye has 3 songs in this rate compared to Taylor Swift having none.

Well, partly it’s that Taylor has more competition in her rates than Kanye, but that’s amusing.

**letsallpoo** (6): A simpler time when Chvrches was a fresh, up-and-coming synthpop band and wasn't making weird [Imagine Dragons ripoffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1YqueG2gtQ) on their third album. When "The Mother We Share" was released as their debut, some reviewers decried it as a Purity Ring knockoff. Eventually, though, critical reception to the song grew, and as Chvrches' discography grew and their career blossomed, this song became a synthpop classic of sorts. Its relative unpopularity meant it was doomed in this rate, but it's still a great song in its own right.

**frogaranaman** (10): Please don’t be full of sibling jokes, please don’t be full of sibling jokes, please don’t be full of sibling jokes.

**MashLuke** (10): this is about Caitlyn Jenner

**mudkip1** (10): THIS SONG'S A MOTHER FUCKING BOP

**mysario** (10): buy Dropmix

**rotating3Dtext** (10): one of those songs that you just don’t skip

**Tedyonce** (10): One of the best alt-pop songs ever made

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Me @ my sister

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): I feel like CHVRCHES have spent their albums since their debut trying to recapture the magic of this song, and I still don't think they've come even close. The melody on the chorus is just beautiful, the synths and vocal samples just build on each other so well, and that bridge just sends my wig to orbit.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): memories of fifa

**welcometoNY** (10): i still have no idea what this is about but it's a goddamn bop

**twat\_brained** (9.6): What can I say? The millennial whoop can more often than not work wonders in a song, and that's exactly what it does here. And damn, if it isn't adorable how I can hear Lauren's Scottish accent when she sings!

**1998tweety** (9.3): Everything about this song is great: the synths, the lyrics, even the auto-tuned style vocals suit the song well.

**stansymash** (9.3): svnthpop

**camerinian** (8.5): I mean, I love Chvrches, I really do, and this song is great, but tbh Every Open Eye is actually such a better album than Bones it’s not funny, and I would go back to most of the songs off of that before this one don’t @ me.

**jamesfog** (8.5): A great synth-pop song

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Lauren Mayberry does really sound like she's in her early adolescence, although that's not a bad thing. Her youthful vocals might make me a little disturbed when she says the word 'fuck' at some point, but in all honesty, the anomaly of how old she sounds only makes The Mother We Share an even better debut single. This is the second CHVRCHES song I've ever heard, and while I'm a little surprised and disappointed at how brief it is, Lauren's delivery only makes the track sound more haunting. I'm still not quite sure what the subject matter's actually about, actually, but sounding like a small child, the lead singer's vocals perfectly accompany the backing synthpop track that sounds deceivingly innocent.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): my first time listening to this was for this rate. i enjoy it.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (8): who?

**gannade** (8): i used to really love this song when i first heard it years ago but it has aged kinda poorly since then... the oh woah oh oh hook still pretty addicting tho

**kappyko** (8): i remember loving this and relistening now i actually still love this

**Piccprincess** (8): I hear this in supermarkets like every time I go..

**Roxieloxie** (8): me, a known dubmass, "wow this sounds like that dead air song from the soundtrack rate, i wonder if they worked with the same people"

**tapdancingpig** (8): There’s something off about this song. I’m not sure if she’s slightly off pitch in parts, or if the production is just off kilter enough to give me uncanny valley or something. Either way, the song is also a jam, so I forgive it.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8): cute

**ReallyCreative** (7.7): Is it weird that CHVRCHES is the one female-lead/fem-sounding band that my vaguely homophobic/sexist acquaintances love? Good song though

**nooodisaster** (7.5): The start of this song always makes me think it's gonna hit harder than it does.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): i think it's a little slow and chvrches' production style has been done better on other songs

# [Foes](https://imgur.com/a/qHSPTfm)

**CarlieScion** (7): her voice is so annoying to me but the instrumental bops

**dramiaa** (7): The ultimate synth pop song lol. Although the lyrics are a bit silly, the chorus is great as is the instrumentation

**dropthehammer11** (7): the best song on a meh album

**enecks** (7): I basically give every Chvrches song a 7. They're good but I don't see much remarkable about them.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (7): i love this band, but this song ain’t that special for me for some reason

**RandomHypnotica** (7): i think i listened to this song wayyyy too much when I first discovered it, and ever since I've been super burnt out on chvrches and can't listen to this song without dying a little inside.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): this song was literally written for some white girl on an indie movie to get on a bus and start her life over i kinda fuck with it

**Solovrinne** (6.5): The "oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh"'s sound really forced to me. Not digging it.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): It’s okay synthpop but I’ve never been a big fan of these guys.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I just don’t get it or care it for much.

**MrSwearword** (6): "Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens" almost made me want to nuke this to hell, but the production and singer are pretty decent to good.

**shipsinker44** (6): okay i liked the song when it was on but then i literally forgot that it was playing. i listened again and its cute but oof its not that great

**FireLordAegon** (5.5): Didn't click for me, but I can see why this sub loves them.

**radiofan15** (4.2): I always read "Synthpop heaven, Jack Antonoff fuck me, Allie X is better than Jesus etc". in this sub and I understand this is a pop sub but not everyone likes that bland music that can only serve Netflix Original Movie trailer realness and not everyone thinks that genre is gonna save pop, ok?!?!?!? thanks for coming to my TED talk.

**JohnnyBAverage** (4): really thought I’d be more into this than i am

**GoWestYoungKanye** (3.2): chvrches are from glasgow so im like obligated to give them a good score for surviving glasgow but i really don’t want to lol i guess i just hate their music

**ComeOnAndSlang** (2): eek

**notdallin** (2): Hard pass on this version of this song. I can’t stand the album version—Lauren’s vocals are a complete mess, unlistenably flat, and totally pale in comparison to the single version released in 2012. I can’t in good conscience give this song a higher score because I need to get the word out about how bad this version is due to the vocals. Had this been the single version, I’d have given this song at least a 9.

**original\_doll** (1): listening to this gave me a headache

**Therokinrolla** (10): I blame this song for my bisexuality.  Beyonce, as she does, has her own brand of confidence. She knows who she is and she owns it, hell, arguably one of the main themes of her later works is the fact that she is Beyonce, she is on top of the world, and she is better than you. That is not a drag I will gladly say Beyonce is better than me, if only for this song that I believe is the peak of her career. The introduction to the real meat of this song is called Yonce, and it is clearly a celebration of herself. It has a sickening heavy beat that never fails to pump me up for the next part.

Y'all. This song is so fucking hot. It doesn't hold back or censor itself for anyone, it is beautifully explicit and perfectly risqué. She drips confidence in the verses, whispers elegence in the chorus, and invents French in the bridge. This song is a journey, and one about pure lust. It is one of the best anthems to sex I've ever heard. Damn

---
# ARTPOP should've won

**bespectacIed** (10): This is not just a hoe anthem, this is THE hoe anthem. The confidence, sex, self-awareness, bravado this song has. If any other pop girl did a legendary visual AND concept album, she'd be deified by this sub, unfortunately this was made by bey so :shrug:

**cyborglilith** (10): anthem

**dramiaa** (10): Epic

**FireLordAegon** (10): This song deserves all your 10s and 11s.

**gannade** (10): gay queen

**mother\_rucker** (10): This song is pure sex, only virgins will rate it lower than a 6 :eyes:

**MrSwearword** (10): Applause was robbed, but again, it was to a Beyonce song worth a damn.

**radiofan15** (10): OK THIS ONE IS JUST IMMACULATE... "I sneeze on the beat and the beat got sicker" is still one of my favorite double entendres of all time and then the transition from Yonce to Transition and the heavenly subdued chorus and HOLY SHIT. Her self-titled is the album that finally made me realize what all of the Beyoncé hype was all about and even from the beginning this was THE album highlight for me.

**rickikardashian** (10): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/352972169732685826/510193658398638080/Screenshot_20181108-175221-1.jpg?width=496&height=601

**Roxieloxie** (10): favorite beyonce [vine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnd8kaQj2zQ)

**SpanKKy1** (10): this beat gave me an anal fissure

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This is such a weird song, especially for a single. Basically opening with a 2 minute long interlude before transitioning into the actual song is a risky move, but the kind of thing I expect from Beyonce more than other pop acts. The song is a banger, its incredibly catchy and quotable, and it takes so many bizarre, weird turns that it can't help but be instantly memorable.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): yes i am french. yes i love this song. yes i am not gay. we exist.

**ZankeeZero** (10): An absolute sex BOP done absolutely right, deserves every bit of praise it's been getting

**HoodooMooJuice** (9.5): How have I never heard this intro before... this beat, her flow slaps!

**lunasaflowers** (9.5): This song is so fucking sexy and sleek, definitely one of my favourite Bey bops.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): so much going on here but it all works pretty well together. certified banger.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.1): hello! est-ce que tu aimes le sexe? le sexe, je veux dire ‘l'activité physique, le coït’. tu aimes ça? tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe? les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent.

**camerinian** (9): I never actually listened to any other Beyonce songs from the self-titled era because I think I heard Drunk In Love and Flawless, didn’t hear much I liked, and then tuned out, but wow this is sleazy as fuck and I love it I feel like a chump for neglecting this for so long. Not wild about the outro but the rest is so good omg

**dropthehammer11** (9): banger

**frogaranaman** (9): You could play this at a college party multiple times and people would get more lit each time it came on.

**JohnnyBAverage** (9): always a personal fav of mine. For some reason I feel this might go out too early but who know prove me wrong popheads.

**nooodisaster** (9): The Yonce interlude isn't my favorite, but Partition is one of the absolute bests from BEYONCE. The sex appeal, your fav could never.

**Piccprincess** (9): the dirtiest of slut bops

**sbb618** (9): I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker / https://youtu.be/Kppx4bzfAaE?t=34s

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): When Beyoncé said “45 minutes to get all dressed up, we ain’t even gonna make it to this club” I felt that, but only because I have crippling social anxiety and depression.

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): I'm biased towards this song and really the entire album because it was released on my birthday as a surprise. I love how sexy it is.

**notdallin** (8.6): I SNEEZED ON THE BEAT AND THE BEAT GOT SICKER

# ARTPOP should've won

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): A little too choppy for me. First minute or so is pretty bad, but it picks up by the end.

**enecks** (7): The Monica Lewinsky line is trash but the rest is good

**RandomHypnotica** (7): I really like the intro to this song, especailly the paparazzi bit, unfortunately, the rest of the song comes in to ruin it.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): this isn't even that much of a bop, i think Work Bitch could've beat it if Britney Jean was in the rate

**MashLuke** (6.5): eh

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Eh, this songs ust kind of disjointed and doesn't really go anywhere. Not Sure how this won, even against other songs on Beyonce's self titled

**CarlieScion** (6): not even the best song on s/t

**welcometoNY** (6): self-titled is my favorite beyonce album but this song has never really sat right with me. "he monica lewinsky'd all over my gown" is just an all-time worst lyric

**amumumyspiritanimal** (5.8): still dont understand the appeal of the song

**original\_doll** (5): I get that this song was trying to do something interesting and clearly a lot of people like it. I am not one of those people.

**followingfreeways** (4): I remember this being a lot better than it was

**Leixander** (4): a really disappointing winner

**ComeOnAndSlang** (3): eek

**CopyCatJ** (3): lemonade slaps tho

**warmishblood** (3): I'm surprised this won a rate

**WilsonJason** (2): i feel like beyonce cant make a good song and halo was a fluke

**PuggleMaster** (1): I gave this a 1 in the original rate and i'm gonna do it again.

**animefangrant62** (0): this hurts to listen to

**jamesfog** (0): Will never understand the praise for this song. A 0 in the 2013 rate and a 0 in the winners rate. Seethe!

**LandonKidatrea** (0): This song is garbage. Like, what else is there to say? It's awful.

**mamas\_spaghettini** (0): how was this a winner of anything

**poppinmmolly** (0): this song is absolutely terrible why do people like this

Therokinrolla: **patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Just one question: are we supposed to rate Yoncé with this? Because Yoncé is one of the best minute and a halves I've ever experienced. I suppose we have to rate the song it's stuck to instead, though. While Flawless may have been the more frequently spammed feminist anthem, Partition definitely garnered more critical respect, managing to shift between a controversial, sexy bop and a treatise on how women handle their sexuality, complete with Monica Lewinsky references and tangents in surprisingly good French. I won't lie and say that some of the decisions here don't baffle me (I never want to hear the voice telling the production team to get out their drums over again) and that the lyrics don't make me a little uncomfortable, but aside from dipping into being problematic just a little bit, much like the other songs that accompanied it on Bey's self-titled surprise drop, Partition ultimately succeeds at what it's trying to do. It's the best of both worlds, and it sure as hell doesn't need any negative comments from Emma Watson.

**aulyve** (8): Dunno if it justifies its length but still great.

**lilacsweetener** (8): i love how the instrumental gets more and more intense as it builds, also the lyrics/video were a huge hint to jay's continued infidelity

**mysario** (8): I bought this album when it dropped and I appreciated all the videos with it

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): Lower score because Yonce is better than Partition

**rotating3Dtext** (8): the bass gives me life

**Shadow1087** (8): very good

**tapdancingpig** (8): Partition itself is one of my favorites that Beyoncé has ever done, but I’ve always found it odd how it was combined with Yoncé, which is a fun song, but it also means that I have to fast forward or wait two minutes for one of the ultimate (married!) thot anthems of all time. Since this is up against some of my other favorite songs ever, I docked two points for that. I feel awful.

**Solovrinne** (7.9): What a bizarre song. It's... experimental. That's the impression I got at first listen and that hasn't changed. Can't deny some parts will just fuck you up and other parts just don't. I know people who will stan this to no end and think this is peak Yoncé material but I can't reach to that level.

**stansymash** (7.7): theres like 5 better songs on this album i dont understand popheads

**banananaise** (7.5): beyoncé? beyoncé? are you happy to be in paris?

**yatcho** (7.5): I have a confession to make: I hate the Yonce part. The rest is a fucking smash but thats not enough for a good score in this rate

**twat\_brained** (7.1): The bass in Yoncé is skinny as hell but I'm not that big on Bey's bars, she ought to leave that to Jay. Not to mention, for someone as left-wing as Beyoncé, reminding everyone of a really ugly moment in recent history for Democrats doesn't look great. And how nasty are y'all that you don't just make out in the back of a limo like you do on prom that you just fuck in the backseat? While we're at it, leave the intercuts of French to Lady Gaga, she knew what she was doing in Bad Romance. You don't.

**1998tweety** (7): What is this mess and why is it among so many iconic songs? It picks up a bit in the second half though.

**amacaroon** (7): Weirdly, I think I’d like this better if Beyonce didn’t sing it. She delivers, like always, but I just don’t believe her? Like, my image of Beyonce is of someone too perfect and boring to be having sex in public. Or even fantasizing about having sex in public. Her persona really shouldn’t affect my enjoyment of this song, but it kinda does. Especially because this song is less of a song and more of an artistic statement.

>What you OUGHTA know is that this song is fucking TRASH on multiple levels and i as a rate host feel insulted, upset, hurt, victimized, and irritated even to this day. the fact that you heathens would have the sheer NERVE to give this a better overall average than an iconic song by an actual iconic artist with three (3) DIAMOND CERTIFIED ALBUMS is simply beyond me!! i don’t understand. i don’t think i’ll ever understand. how does you oughta know even go? i, for one, couldn’t tell you at all. this travesty of a song has been permanently BLOCKED from my memory: this blurb serves as a reminder to instead stan Republican goddess Shania Twain, or at the very least stan unproblematic grandma Celine Dion. miss Celine at least has decent music in her discography unlike unknown has-been alanis morisette who hasn’t had an OUNCE of relevancy since like 1999. bye sis!!! - /u/Mudkip1
>
>I can't necessarily say I wanted this to win the rate. Man! I Feel Like A Woman! is played at every wedding or wedding social I've been to in my life, and it fucking slaps. Shania Twain is a Canadian legend who only deserves respect. It's one of the greatest songs ever made, and anyone who disagrees should honestly just be banned because they clearly don't appreciate good music. That being said, I can't necessarily be mad that this song won. You Oughta Know is a Canadian staple that I still hear on the radio pretty regularly. A multi-grammy winning song, has an explosive chorus that instantly turns anyone into an angsty teen mad at their ex-boyfriend for dating someone new. This song serves as a big fuck you to the guy, and that this new girl's got nothing on Alanis. Alanis ended up with Ryan Reynolds before they broke up so who really won here? - /u/NapsAndNetflix

---

**Therokinrolla** (8): The emotional impact of this song is almost damning. It's incredible how much anger comes across through the just under four minutes the song covers. Many would attribute this to the punchy hook, or the all-consuming rock production, and, obviously, the lyricism. "When I scratch my nails down his back I hope you feel it," and "is she perverted like me? would she go down on you in a theater?" are great exaple of poetic angst. However, great lyrics need great delivery to make the lyrics feel real and honest.

This song is very rarely "sung," this song is snarled, it is screeched, it is grunted, and it is growled. Her voice is imperfect, it has fry, it has yelling, and screaming, but never does it feel overdone or oversung. It feels fierce, biting, like Miss Alanis is in the room and I stepped on her toe. She feels unfiltered, brash, and ready to cut a bitch. This song is emo, perfected.

---

# I'm here to remind you...

**chihuahuazero** (11): This is my favorite song from the 90s. Every line burns with resentment, and I love it.

**ReallyCreative** (11): This song is just fucking amazing, the energy and spite you can FEEL in the lyrics and the way Alanis delivers them. We stan an absolute icon.

**animefangrant62** (10): why does she sound irish?

**bluehxrizon** (10): eat me out @mud

**Dracyoshi** (10): The anger in this song shakes me to my core. This is THE breakup song. Even more than that, it's THE spiteful anger song.

**gannade** (10): the anger in this, ugh i sing along each time at a heartbreak i never had

**lunasaflowers** (10): This song will always fucking KILL. Alanis's rage is amazing and powerful and Jagged Little Pill is a classic.

**MrSwearword** (10): Not her best song ever made but still a fabulous song

**mysario** (10): iconic musicians making an iconic slap back track

**perfumevee** (10): A classic.

**radiofan15** (10): ANGRY MAN-HATER WHITE WOMEN SLAPPED. One of my favorite things about this song and I heard very little about it is the bass: it's so menacing and funky yet so "cathartic" for some reason... also "you're thinking for me when you fuck her" made me scream aloud the first time i've heard it more than 10 years ago

**saucymac** (10): I can't believe Uncle Joey did this to her

**skargardin** (10): Oh look a classic

**camerinian** (9.5): Given how much I fucking hate Adult Alternative as a genre, I’m really glad that Alanis was one of the biggest artists to come out of it, since she can actually convey the honest rage that makes actual alternative music good, and putting her in the same genre as, like, Matchbox 20 and Train is honestly a little offensive

**bespectacIed** (9): but this is alanis' most overrated song. Not even the best song on the first half of JLP.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): Please don’t call me any names but I didn’t give this a ten because of some of her weird pronunciation.

**HoodooMooJuice** (9): I should check Alanis out, this bangs

**nooodisaster** (9): The more I listened to this, the more I liked it. The lyrical content is BEYOND. There's so much personality and anger and lines like "Would she go down on you in a theater?" is still shocking today, let alone 20 years ago. But beyond that, the chorus is just really catchy, and doesn't sacrifice melody for the lyrics.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Alanis actually had a second successful era globally after she released Jagged Little Pill, but who even remembers that the name of the record it was based off? I remember finding songs like All I Really Want or Hand in My Pocket hard to swallow during the Canadian rate, because of how jarring their vocals sounded to my ears, but You Oughta Know has always been a song that fits Alanis perfectly, even if she performs it with a weird accent. It's hard not to be in awe of the unbridled anger in this song, nor of how scathing the callouts in it can be. Dear John may be great, and Don't Hurt Yourself may be amazing, but they may have to take a step back if they're confronted with this one.

# of this mess.

**shipsinker44** (7): idk i never really liked this song tbh, ironic is better

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This song sounds like a filming of someone doing parkour with a fisheye lens that’s so high in contrast it looks like it’s nighttime and at the end of the video the protagonist jumps off a building and lands on their ex

**FireLordAegon** (6.5): Not my style of music, but I still enjoyed it.

**original\_doll** (6.5): love the cutting lyrics, and I get that the aggressive singing is obvi intentional but it sounds SO unpleasant

**frogaranaman** (6): This is 2006 Youtube personified.

**jamesfog** (6): Underwhelming winner.

**selegend** (6): Iconic, I never expected this to win over Shania and Celine in a popheads rate

**SpanKKy1** (6): why is she yelling at me

**raicicle** (5): wait this is actually bad. how ironic

**Solovrinne** (5): I don't want to give it a low score just because it was before my time listening, but it's definitely not something I want to listen to again.

**strawberryswing1** (5): I feel bad giving this a bad score because I know she's such an icon, but I really don't feel this.

**airylnovatech** (4.5): I dunno though

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4.5): holy shit what was r/popheads going through when this won a whole rate???

**notdallin** (4): go down on you in wHERE? NOT ON MY GOOD CHRISTIAN SUB.

**VodkaInsipido** (4): how can you not hate this

**GoWestYoungKanye** (3): im sorry i know i suck

**mother\_rucker** (3): The movie theater blowjob line is iconic, you go Joey Gladstone.

**PuggleMaster** (3): I like the chorus i think, everything is just so awkward and forced. I'm really confused how this won a rate....

**welcometoNY** (3): this is kind of a mess but the chorus goes off

**dramiaa** (0): I honestly thought this song was a Spotify Ad for a solid 5 seconds when it started lmao. I don’t like this at all: the vocals sound way too forced, there is something off with the volume, the lyrics are cringy, she sounds like she’s dying in the background, and the verses are so bad they might as well be the worst part of this rate. How did this win anything ? wtf? Am I missing something??

**kappyko** (0): probably the only rate winner I legit hate lmfao

**mudkip1** (0): HEIL SHANIA

Therokinrolla: **rotating3Dtext** (9): she’s so angry I love it

**Tomoki** (9): Alanis is THAT girl for this song.

**hikkaru** (8.5): This really is the definition of SNAPPING. Sis goes off and this song is iconic for good reason

**literally100bees** (8.5): If I was a young gay in the 90's I would have been obsessed with Alanis Morissette

**rickikardashian** (8.5): This was one of the first rates I did, and ngl, I’m still angry about *It’s All Coming Back To Me Now* and *Man! I feel like a Woman* losing, but this has grown on me a lot. It truly embodies anger and bitterness, and I love it, because sometimes man truly aint shit, and I need angry bop to dance it off, and this is perfect to that. Thanks bitch

**stansymash** (8.5): one heck of a chorus hoo baby!

**1998tweety** (8.3): Wow I remember this from my childhood, iconic af.

**Bendariaku89** (8.2): i didn’t expect this song to grow on me, but it definitely did. I absolutely hated it the first listen, but now i genuinely like the song.

**twat\_brained** (8.2): What the hell did David do to poor old Alanis? Why is she so angsty? Engaging in oral sex in the middle of a film isn't sexy; it just leads to a public indecency charge. I'm always glad to have people putting Canada on the map, but even this is a bit much for me.

**1313Harbor** (8): This song has grown on me so much. Did Alanis invent vocal fry? The Kardashians could never.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (8): not a huge alanis fan, and this song is pretty medicore compared to the rate, but it's still a  big bop

**aulyve** (8): Everyone is going off. Alanis on vocals. Flea on bass. That other guy from the Chili Peppers on the guitar.

**enecks** (8): I flirted with some Canadian exchange student. He said he wasn't into guys. Jokes on you, I'm transitioning to a girl now

**J\_Toe** (8): oh hey this is Alanis Morrisette? I recognise the melody, but I've never looked into it. Thanks popheads!

**MashLuke** (8): fuckboys lost

**sbb618** (8): Insert clip of Kevin from The Office

**tapdancingpig** (8): This song is kind of a cliche at this point. The production encapsulates almost everything dated about 90’s production, and it has hundreds of imitators. Still, the song hits you where it hurts.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Incredibly 90s but still a bop. My favorite two bits of trivia about this song are it possibly being about the goofy uncle from Full House and half the Red Hot Chili Peppers playing instruments on it.

**banananaise** (7.5): the chorus is great but in such a competitive lineup it's just not enough!

**JohnnyBAverage** (7.5): yas daddy dave coulier get yours A Star Is Born now in Theaters

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): you oughta know this song will be out on day 1

**Roxieloxie** (7.4): what is happening here

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): that chorus is iconic and awesome, but the rest of the song just seems like an annoying wait until the chorus. personally my least fave single from jagged little pill

**CarlieScion** (7): WHY did this win over YOU LEARN

**dropthehammer11** (7): ya its good

>Belgian polymath Stromae has as much a knack for smart and cutting commentary as he does setting it to unabashedly fun pop music. The World Cup-style fervor of the guitars and militarised house beat are a surprising but well-fitting accompaniment to the lyrics—a unexpectedly scathing critique on absent fathers. The hook is an incessant cry of “Où t’es papa où t’es?”, or “Where are you dad, where are you?” that Stromae makes so equally catchy and tormented that you barely need to speak French to understand the gist of the whole song. It’s not hard to see why the song caught on even outside the Francophone world—for Stromae, the language barrier is a trivial obstacle in writing a great song. - /u/raicicle

---

**letsallpoo** (10): Behold, a French pun: ["Empapaouter" is occitan argot for "to swindle", but "papaouter" sounds just like “daddy, where are you?”](http://www.thesinglesjukebox.com/?p=7331) Fittingly, the song is about an absantee father from his child's perspective, and you can clearly hear Stromae's emotions jumble up as he sings, language barries be damned. He vcaillates between confusion, rage, depression, desperation, and rage again, and the song ends without any kind of resolution. Knowing that Stromae's father was killed in the Rwandan genocide only heightens the cathartic force of the track.

---

# Lucky for you

**animefangrant62** (10): apparently this is about not having a father growing up but man does it bop hard

**Bendariaku89** (10): for a song in a completely different language, I completely love it.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): nous stan une légende ... quelle bonne bonne chanson

**didney-worl** (10): alternative title: daddy?

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Weirdest music video ever, one of the greatest modern Eurodance tracks.

**enecks** (10): WOO

**frogaranaman** (10): My friend once said “I’m glad I learned French so I could be roasted about not having a father in multiple languages” and to say I was gagged was the least of my worries because the fucker only said that to kill me in Smash 4.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): at risk of sounding cheesy, j’ai les sentiments compliqués sur la musique francophone; le rap francophone est presque toujours merde. il y a, je sais pas, quelque chose, à propos de stromae... il est différent. je sais c’est dumb, mais, il est spécial. la façon dont il fait la musique, délibérée et belle en même temps, il est difficil.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): omg the french have made some points

**MashLuke** (10): je aime ce chanson, americains stay pressed

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): i don’t speak french, but this is a bop

**MrSwearword** (10): CHRISTINE WAS ROBBED but at least this song packs such a fucking punch and a half.

**mysario** (10): another example of foreign skinnies making better music than American fats

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): this is probably going to go out day 1 which proves once again that r/popheads is a tasteless sub!

**1998tweety** (9.6): I remember bopping to this a lot in French class in high school, sad it's gonna get robbed here cause its in French. The lyrics tell a great story and the beat is so good too.

**twat\_brained** (9.5): First and foremost, RIP to Stromae's father. I imagine he had to dig deep and really pour his emotion into this track, and I truly feel it. Not only that, but he sings so well and the beat is just brilliant. The only imperfection is the guitar in the outro, it sounds slightly out of tune on some bars for whatever reason. Still an all-round brilliant foreign-language song, nonetheless.

**amacaroon** (9): I used to be able to understand and speak French fluently and from what I can remember, the lyrics are really good. Also, I managed to forget the entire French language in 4 years but not the lyrics to this specific song

**HoodooMooJuice** (9): This Slaps?! 🎶 Poopoo Papa Poutine 🎶

**Solovrinne** (9): It surprised me how emotion this way. Pretty good!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): The beat on this track has extreme boppability

**FireLordAegon** (8.7): Ok but why does this bop so hard?

**Roxieloxie** (8.3): im not a multicultured hoe but this bops

**aulyve** (8): Great memories of French classes where my teacher would play this as an example of French culture because he couldn't be arsed to teach grammar. Great bop too.

**CarlieScion** (8): a non-english song? in my popheads rate?

**notdallin** (8): /r/unexpectedcryingatlyrictranslations

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I get the feeling that a lot of people who haven't stuck around the sub for long are going to listen to this a few times for this rate before slapping it with a decent score without ever looking up what the lyrics mean. Here's a tip: don't. I'm not the biggest fan of French as a language, but I promise the incredibly well-written narrative in Papaoutai is going to destroy you. I don't know much about Stromae, but apparently the track is specifically about his father who died a victim of the Rwandan Genocide, before Stromae could even get to know him, which...fuck, makes it even sadder. Musically, Papaoutai's only an above average track for me, but knowing the context behind it makes it only that much more of a tearjerker.

**Shadow1087** (8): groovy

**SpanKKy1** (8): what the heck is this ethnic banger I’ve never heard before

**tapdancingpig** (8): Ok, this bops pretty hard.

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): I don't understand anything that's happening but it's pretty cool so yeah

**followingfreeways** (7.5): idk what he’s saying but it’s a bop

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Catchy hook, meaningful & emotional lyrics, and all done by one dude. Impressive.

**shipsinker44** (7.5): usually im xenophobic but this was nice

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): a french bop? i fucks w it

**J\_Toe** (7): omg i saw this video on rage once but didn't catch the song title or artist and I mildly wanted to know who or what the song is but I never looked into it thanks popheads yet again

**Leixander** (7): strong message, delivery etc. but I don't find myself listening to this much

**selegend** (7): This will probably go out Day 1 and I blame it on xenophobia

**stansymash** (7): positive

# I got all these daddy issues 😭

**jamesfog** (6.5): A good song, but Completement Fou deserved :corn:

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): i get why this won a eurovision rate, it sounds exactly as cheesy as a real eurovision song

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): idgi

**ZankeeZero** (6.5): okay, okay, hear me out. this was a huge hit around here and I just have really bad memories around it.

**JohnnyBAverage** (6): I got an A in french in high school, but I deserved a D

**amumumyspiritanimal** (5): ugh one of the most annoying songs of the rate, Tous Les Memes was much better.

**radiofan15** (4.9): I think i'm missing something as everyone loved this song back when it came out but I always resisted it as if I was some sort of hipster who resented how 'real music' wasn't popular... I still don't like it, but at least doesn't generate me antibodies as much as it did back then.

**camerinian** (3): i’m gonna front I always found this song really fucking annoying. The chorus is mind-numbing, that post-chorus synth drop is really basic and has not aged well and Stromae sounds like he’s a half-step behind the beat on the first verse, and i don’t know if that’s a problem with his flow or the production but it’s distracting as shit. I (like everyone else lol) didn’t do this rate originally, but it must have been a weak field if this could win it

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (2): I can't even understand it, how did this win a rate i-

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): completment fou is better

>In a cutthroat rate full of synthpop queer anthems deserving of the title, MUNA's "I Know A Place" reigned victorious because of its message of community and togetherness. Written in the wake of the 2016 attack on Pulse Nightclub, "I Know A Place" is a synthpop ode to the queer community with a danceable beat and devastating lyrics. #Sadbopheads wins again! - /u/whatareblackhole

---

**letsallpoo** (8): [From my blurb in the /r/popheads top 100 tracks of 2017 list:](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7oe97v/reveal_the_top_100_tracks_of_2017_according_to/ds96ke4) 'I Know a Place' sounds perfectly attuned to the troubles of 2017, but its origins date back to 2015, after the death of MUNA's friend from cancer. It was borne out of a sorrow that predates Trump, predates Pulse, and predates any of the specific atrocities we've faced over the past years, but rather was borne into a stream of darkness and hatred that has no fixed start and end. Yet "I Know a Place" stands in this darkness and finds a light, inviting the bruised and the broken to lay down their weapons, to go out dancing instead of giving into more hatred and violence. Bolstered by gorgeous, shimmering synths, the song offers a place of refuge to the marginalized, never once giving way to platitudes and always sounding genuine and loving. The bridge reveals the obvious, that such a place only exists in the imagination, but it's our need to strive toward that place that pushes us forward as a society and as individuals. It's not just a song that we need now; it's a song that we've always needed.

# Support the Gays!

**bluehxrizon** (11): this song made me not homophobic anymore

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (11): I'm not crying, you're crying

**kappyko** (11): i wonder how many uncreative twinks will comment avocado voice because they have no actual original critiques of their own

**mirandacrocsgrove** (11): this definitely won’t win this time, but I will always give this an 11 for its meaning and will never forget amumu’s sabotage oops 🙊

**1998tweety** (10): A beautiful gay anthem that's actually that, a gay anthem.

**dramiaa** (10): I cant wait for yall to cut this song out on the first day (pls don’t do that).

**frogaranaman** (10): How do I lay down my dick?

**Leixander** (10): lay down your weapon @earth

**mysario** (10): ANTHEM

**Roxieloxie** (10): a fucking 11 but i don't have any more. This song is so important and i love it so much!!!

**shipsinker44** (10): omg ive never hesrd this but ahat a fucking bop

**SpanKKy1** (10): I know a face tom holland can sit on

**Tedyonce** (10): I cry every time I listen, the sense of love and community is overwhelming. I need to feel like I have a place to go, and this song makes me feel less alone. Infinite love.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Why am i sobbing

**TragicKingdom1** (10): /u/InfernalSolstice i know a place we can go ;)

**notdallin** (9.5): One of the very best songs of 2017, a timeless synthpop song about general inclusivity, and yet so timely and pertinent for now.

**lunasaflowers** (9.3): Gorgeous queer song.

**jamesfog** (9): Great discovery.

**JohnnyBAverage** (9): Again first time listen. Beautiful.

**nooodisaster** (9): We love an emotional, politically tinted bop with immaculate production & hooks, as well as a gut-punch of a bridge.

**selegend** (9): And you're a f*ggot, so you're not even allowed in a church. Mind your business.

**VodkaInsipido** (9): this is a bop

**literally100bees** (8.5): I love the gays

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Our favourite emo lesbians take the moment to seemingly pause the sad, downcast music that normally fills the walls of their debut to deliver one of their most well-known fan favourites, I Know A Place. Make no mistake - the way the song sounds does fit its ultimate message, but there's quite a depressing background behind what caused MUNA to pen this brave and hopeful anthem down. Originally, it was written for their friends suffering from disease, but, unfortunately, after Pulse, the phrase 'lay down your weapon' has turned this into a queer anthem that's somber yet insistent in a better future for us all. Knowing the context it's taken nowadays, it's really hard not to tear up at I Know A Place, but boy, is the song as good as it ever was. The dark clouds gathering around us right now somehow only make it stronger.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.5): a bop!

**amumumyspiritanimal** (8): while I gave this a super low score in the original rate, I really warmed up to the song. Although there are still parts that kinda annoy me, but the production is flawless, and it's still super gay so I can't really give it a bad score now.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I mean it’s good but I must admit when results come around I guarantee I’ll have no idea which song this is

**HoodooMooJuice** (8): I wouldn't be mad if this came on, but it's not something I would seek out. The lyrics are nice.

**MrSwearword** (8): right idea, but Keane did it better with Somewhere Only We Know. Also, note to amumumyspiritanimal to LAY DOWN THEIR WEH-PAWN

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): kinda bangs actually

# Deport the Gays!

**Solovrinne** (7.9): I like it, it bops, I think it still has to grow on me though.

**stansymash** (7.7): okie dokie!

**twat\_brained** (7.7): Love the beat but it sounds like they're saying "lay down your ribbon" and sounds **oddly** similar to Gimmie Love, much like "Chic" by Cocovan.

**camerinian** (7.5): I’m not particularly won over by the sound of this song, like, it ain’t groundbreaking, but it’s groovy and I really like the lyrical sentiment, so take that for what it’s worth. I hadn‘t heard this song before this rate to be fair, but I might just keep an eye on these girls. There’s something here

**MashLuke** (7.5): I know many places too, you aint special

**strawberryswing1** (7.5): This is kinda a bop but I don't love her voice

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): I hate her singing. She has some significant technical flaws that prevent me from enjoying her voice. Otherwise, this is a massive bop.

**enecks** (7): I always misread MUNA as NUMA

**Shadow1087** (7): whats it gonna be is better in every way

**warmishblood** (6.7): I hate the weapon line so much, but the rest of the song is good

**banananaise** (6.5): i was really into this subgenre at some point but now i'm just tired

**ExtraEater** (6): on earth

**FireLordAegon** (6): Kinda forgettable

**aulyve** (5.5): Nice enough but I wouldn't listen to it again.

**original\_doll** (5): nice message but this is so boring. and am I wrong or is the singer putting on a fake accent lol

**GoWestYoungKanye** (4.4): crying on the bathroom place is better

**radiofan15** (4.2): I already forgot about this song as soon as it finished.

**gannade** (4): I might just not be gay enough to understand what everyone sees in this song.

>“Party in the USA” prevented World War III. It is the sun that shines on the Earth every day. The modern national anthem penned by Jessie J about her experiences with stepping into LA was modified into an all-ages classic for then-teen sensation Miley Cyrus. Everyone had this on full blast, guilty pleasure or not, whether you were an 8 year old watching Disney Channel or a 22 year old going off at a club. Miley brought about one of the most unifying anthems of the 21st century. The gargantuan success won the brutal Disney/Nickelodeon Singles Rate with absolutely no shock factor; its win was so obvious that it only received one 11 but 55 10s. Any person who doesn’t like this ubiquitous pop classic shouldn’t be invited to parties. It even unites the gays and straights by name-dropping Britney and Jay-Z. How can you listen to this and not nod your head like “yeah” and move your hips like “yeah”? - /u/selegend

---

**Therokinrolla** (10): Lord, I remember being nine and hating this song. I would hate it when it came on the radio, I would change it asap, I would laugh at people who enjoyed it, and I was overall an asshole about it. Because, in this world's storm of social norms and expectations, one of them in the southern U.S. of A was for boys to hate Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus, because that was for girls and boys cannot be caught being girly, nothing but another misogynistic expection of America. What does this story about feminism have to do with Party In The U.S.A?

This song is so fucking fun and well put together. The sharp melodies, the surgically precise production, and just Miley's delivery that sounds like she is at a party having the time of her life. As I grew up and began piecing myself together I realized how much of a banger PITUSA was, and how much I was missing out on. In 2016 I left southern America for the first time in my life and went with some friends to California, and we needed a soundtrack, because thats what the fuck you do. And PITUSA was a part of it, so much so that when we were disembarking the plane, a group of us was singing it very very loudly, all the way to the second chorus (because we didn't know the bridge, oops). And we got some looks but I did NOT care. We were fucking living, singing that song that itself sings about the place that preconditioned me to dislike the song.

# U S A! U S A! U S A!

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Nostalgia.

**ExtraEater** (10): suddenly the national debt is cleared

**gannade** (10): the disney singles rate was tragic because of all the underaged twinks but in the end, a total bop won. i love seeing this climb itunes and spotify every fourth of july

**mamas\_spaghettini** (10): a classic

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): “Who Owns My Heart” is a better bop

**mudkip1** (10): outsold michael jackson and prince

**mysario** (10): top tier Summer slam

**NuneEtsuko** (10): 2009 was really the year of Pop, love this one too.

**pickupthephonebaby** (10): dump trump

**shipsinker44** (10): Q U E E N MILEY WHO GETS TOO MUCH SHIT FROM THIS SERVER EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS GIVEN US GREAT SINGLES

**SpanKKy1** (10): invented freedom and abolished slavery

**teenage\_meme** (10): i don't care what anyone says, you can't get much more fun than this. and a britney song was ON!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I don’t support the USA but I fuck with this

**VodkaInsipido** (10): i love you america

**Solovrinne** (9.9): I remember bopping to this while playing pokemon platinum. what a mood thank you for taking me there.

**1313Harbor** (9.5): This song released right before my senior year of high school, and it’s still iconic today.

**HoodooMooJuice** (9.5): The kind of innocent bop we need now in 20gayteen

**radiofan15** (9.5): Ill always find really funny that Miley had never heard a Jay-Z song at the time of the song's popularity... also, the media uproar that took place after her performance with a pole in the Teen Choice awards would never stop to amaze me... also also the fact that the song became associated with the death of Osama Bin Laden, i mean... my point is that PITUSA is the more iconic thing Miley has ever done and you can't change my mind

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): The absolutely ICONIC disney bop

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): This song is exactly what you expect it to be, it just does it really really really well

**1998tweety** (9.4): This is a big bop, a nice feel good song.

**FireLordAegon** (9.2): July did not have a 4th day until 2010

**dramiaa** (9): this song is not supposed to be this good, like, at all. It has one of the best pop chorus of all time, or maybe it’s the nostalgia speaking lol. Did the petition to make this the national anthem go anywhere?

**literally100bees** (9): Yeah this is still good

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): a classic tbh

**twat\_brained** (9): Miley's voice is very shouty here, and it sounds quite nasal and jarring at times. That being said, there are some points the creedy producer and u/sapphire1921's queen made with this beat. Also +0.6 for the Britney shoutout ;)

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Me in middle school: Ew this song is dumb and Miley is sleazy, I miss the old Miley. Me today: A BOP, MILEY IS A LEGEND!

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (8): this was literally the first song I listened to when I moved to Los Angeles

**didney-worl** (8): motion to replace the u.s. immigration test with just screaming the lyrics to this song, all in favor say put your hands up cuz they're playing your song

**mother\_rucker** (8): I dream of a world where this is sung at national sporting events.

**Roxieloxie** (7.8): I have never heard a britney song on the radio

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.7): im a white american dad its the fourth of july i am eating a hot dog and this is a banger (lol i still can’t hear excess in ‘fame excess’, it’s one hundred percent xx) (also why does she have to say tummy god)

# The United States is a prime example of the inherent problems of capitalism and the democratic process. Both only work when the system of individuals participate in the process and go out of their way to educate themselves on their local and national issues; however, in both cases attempts are made to stifle and disenfranchise minorities , with false information and the parasitic and infectious nature of advertisement. This results in low voter turnout and the manipulation of many for the prosperity of few with "shiny things" and a false sense of status attributed to overpriced material items, and that is nothing to praise.

**stansymash** (6.9): i'm sorry im just a little too heartless to go all in here

**aulyve** (6.5): Wait what Jay-Z song was it.

**nooodisaster** (6): Some rates are stronger than others. Like I'm sure if I did the nicktoons rate I'd give this a 10, but here... ? The first verse & chorus is a serve tho.

**notdallin** (6): post Hannah montana, pre-bangerz Miley was a WEIRD ERA.

**LandonKidatrea** (5): I feel bad for Miley Cyrus. She's in this rate with pop music legends and icons. And while I don't wish to downplay her significance in modern pop music, her representation in this rate is fucking Party In The U.S.A. I mean, jeez, the Weird Al parody of this song is better. Weird Al is hilarious.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): This is one of Miley's songs that I can semi-tolerate, but I still don't really like it that much. Maybe I just don't have as much nostalgia for the early 2010s Hollywood Records sound like some other people on this sub.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): i go back and forth on this

**enecks** (3): this shit sounds cheaper than some of the shitty condoms my grindr hookups use

**Shadow1087** (1): not actually that good and also fuck america

**CopyCatJ** (0): Miley Cyrus: 'I've never heard a JAY-Z song' also it sounds horrible.

Therokinrolla: **patronsaintofaspies** (7): Has there been another song more obviously written by somebody else? Miley's as American as a girl can get. Though I do wish Jessie J kept Party In The U.S.A for herself (I'm convinced she'd be able to pull it off better, due to her stronger vocals and, y'know, actually not being from the country she's singing about visiting for the first time) it became Miley's first defining hit, for better or for worse, and it's cemented itself in pop culture's collective memory as this dumb song that's annoyingly catchy and maybe kind of cute. I used to hate this like the plague, if I'm being honest, but I'm actually starting to like this a little. This is one of Jessie's best compositions, and I find the lyrics awkwardly adorable. I've always been agnostic on Miley Cyrus, though, and I'm not sure she pulls this off to its maximum potential. While it seems tailor-made for a teen pop Disney star, Miley's vocals, which are solid most of the time, sound shrill and too inexperienced here for her to perform it as well as the song's writer normally would. It's decent, but I still don't think it should have won over Selena or Demi.


**amumumyspiritanimal** (7): o v e r r a t e d but still bops

**camerinian** (7): “Text MILEYWORLD to 66937 to get a Free Miley Wallpaper for your phone! MSG&Data rates may apply” is still on the official video for this and that is a beautiful and hilarious symbol of how kind of dated this song is whoops

**CarlieScion** (7): the climb outsold

**Dracyoshi** (7): These lyrics are a disaster, but that doesn't stop Party In The USA from being a fun summer jam.

**frogaranaman** (7): Certified Jesuit prep school banger.

**jamesfog** (7): What a horrible rate this was.

**JohnnyBAverage** (7): happy fourth of july everyone hope the earth isn’t nuked before I see the rate reveal!

**MashLuke** (7): cute and thats about it

**MrSwearword** (7): Miley is still bad, but I've softened to this song as it stands as one of her lesser offenses in music.

**rotating3Dtext** (7): I mean, iconic, but cheeeeesy

**tapdancingpig** (7): I have a lot of nostalgia for this song, but I’m not impressed with Miley on the song. Well, I was fine with with it, until I realized that Jessie J would not only sound 1000 times better (and I’m not a stan at all), but also would make more sense.
