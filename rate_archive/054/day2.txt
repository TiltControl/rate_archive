>I‚Äôm super duper glad this song won instead of miss grims atm lol. FKA Twigs is THRIVING and serving excellent stripper choreo on her instagram while grimes is rotting in the corner with her ugly billionaire boyfriend and her batshit insane ex best friend who should honestly be put in an insane asylum. come for me all you want azealians!!! - /u/Mudkip1
>
"Two Weeks" is a fantastic alternative R&B/art pop song that somehow, perhaps through some witchcraft, beat the entirety of Grimes' album *Art Angels*! /u/Mudkip1 was a great co-host and it really helped me become friends with him :herpes:. It's one of the most participated rates, but we unfortunately didn't get quite to 100 participants! IT was still amazing, though, and I loved being able to host a rate last year. It's a slow burn of a song, but it's so cinematic and entrancing. The wobbly bass and echoing percussion that sounds like it's cascading down a hallway complements Miss twigs's voice to a T. /r/popheads expects a sex bop to be those hyper-active, Gaga dance bops. This is what a sex bop is: explicit, beautiful, dirty, crazy, sexy, and cool. A wash of noise that still sounds futuristic 4 years later. The 2010s pop and R&B scene has gotten obsessed with the bassy and futuristic sound that FKA twigs helped usher in to the point of homogeneity, but I can guarantee when she makes her return to Earth she'll remind us there's none other quite like her as an artist. - /u/kappyko

**Therokinrolla** (10): Art pop is an incredibly loosely defined genre of music, and if you asked most people to define it I feel like you'd get a bunch of examples of art pop songs before you'd get a real stable definition. Does it mean simply weird? Does it mean sacrificing some traditional pop tendencies for the sake of message and artistic merit? Or is it some strange combination of the two that is muddier than my Alabama woods backyard during a rainstorm? Why is New York by Queen St Vincent art pop but Heavy Metal Lover by miss Gaga isn't?

I'm gonna be fucking honest I have no fucking clue what concretely defines the art pop genre. I've always thought of it as a focus on a specific part of pop music which is the flipped, stretched, changed, and overall experimented with whilst keeping the hook and melody-driven nature of typical pop. But I could be entirely wrong, and I probably am.

The point of all this is that words are stupid, and something doesn't need to qualify as "art pop" to be an artsy and stunning, emotionally riveting song. I can't point out what Two Weeks does specifically to make it sway into the art pop category, but what I CAN do is tell you that it's motherfucking GOOD. The moment you hear those low, bassy synths morph into miss twig melodically moaning (Melody Moans would be a good drag queen name) and making her intentions CLEAR, you KNOW that this track is stellar and a fantastic display of sexuality through music. It really is unmatched in how purely HORNY she sounds good lort.

In conclusion, all the genre "art pop" does is allow white gay hipster snobs to feel good about their music taste. Please stream Bjork, Tori Amos, Regina Spektor, Fiona Apple, and Kate Bush NOW.

# FKA wigs

**cyborglilith** (11): It was hard to choose between this and Love Me Harder (again), but I needed to give this the score it deserved after trashing it in the rate.

**enecks** (11): Yeah this is amazing. Honestly I just replay this song for hours on end sometimes. It's kinda weird, but so catchy. It's ahead of its time. It's hypnotic. It's complex. It's simple. FKA Twigs did T H A T.

**mudkip1** (11): MOUTH. OPEN. YOU'RE. HIIGH

**Tedyonce** (11): I ADORE Everything Is Embarrassing, but this classic needs all the help it can get. I was spellbound at first listen. Hypnotizing, strange lyrics, a strong hook and an incredible music video make for a titan of a song.

**1313Harbor** (10): I mean, this fucking bangs.

**1998tweety** (10): I really wanted to give this my 11 but someone edged out by just a little bit. With that said wow. This song is absolutely incredible. The way Twigs' vocals glide on top of the synths makes me feel like I'm levitating. Her soft whispers cut at the perfect syllables as she spits out the word motherfucker. This song does sex better than Love Me Harder. Twigs demonstrates complete sexual domination, her sex is so good that she makes her partner completely forget about his previous love; if that's not powerful then idk what is. The bridge is the perfect climax to this song, the lyrics push the theme even further. "High motherfucker, get your mouth open, you know you're mine." is my favourite lyric in the entire song, it perfectly sums up the entire song.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): pendulum deserved to win this rate but whatever this works too

**bespectacIed** (10): FKA is legit on another league in terms of talent.

**camerinian** (10): wtf im straight now

**chihuahuazero** (10): Throwback when rock.genius.com declared this Album of the Year because we agreed it was better than any of the actual rock albums on the list. It deserved it.

**CopyCatJ** (10): LP1 Album of the Decade

**didney-worl** (10): I love you twigs please come back

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): That voice is everything. This song is ethereal. That is all.

**FireLordAegon** (10): Honestly I considered giving this song my 11 instead of RAWM... THAT'S HOW GOOD IT IS!! twigs sounds like a robotic angel just giving you the best foreplay of your life and before you know it, you all of a sudden have a cosmic orgasm along with her. Give here two weeks and you won't recognize any of your faves.

**gannade** (10): a really good song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Whisper queen, selena is shaking

**kappyko** (10): at first i was scared mud would kill me for not giving this an 11 but then i realized it actually is my 11 oops EDIT: kappyko is sorry

**MrSwearword** (10): Exceptional and lethal vocals

**nooodisaster** (10): twigs truly merged art pop with mainstream expectations in a perfect way, her MIND.

**PuggleMaster** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before (praying for day 3!!!)

**selegend** (10): girl please put the bird down

**stansymash** (10): when she says "i can fuck you" i throw up my eyebrows like i'm a concerned dad who thinks the movie he's watching with his 2 sons may be inappropriate after all anyway how are you

**teenage\_meme** (10): GORGEOUS. i could listen to this for the rest of my life. so lost in it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): my only 11 to ever win a rate lol. an iconic timeless banger.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): where is the album

**ExtraEater** (9.5): fortnite

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.5): My favourite Twigs song is still Ache but like... ‚Äògive me two weeks you won‚Äôt recognise her?‚Äô UGH. If you unappreciative whores send this out Day One...

**CarlieScion** (9): pretty

**dramiaa** (9): This song is so different its amazing. I love the chorus, and the background vocals throughout the song. The only bad thing about it is that it took me a long time to get into it

**Leixander** (9): now opehn your eyehs


# Fake twigs

**shipsinker44** (6): ive never heard an fka twigs song and this doesnt give me an amazing impression... idk i think its hervoice that i rly dont like

**twat\_brained** (6): I like how it sounds but I can barely hear a damn thing Twigs is saying most of the time. Conversely, Flesh Without Blood is marginally more intelligible, but the strong punk rock undertones make it so much better for me.

**bloupp** (4): Idk, didn't really do anything for me.

**berober04** (3): [](#twigs)

**Bendariaku89** (2): this is a song that just got worse everytime i heard it, like this was like an 8 at first and after each listen the vocals just got less interesting and the song starts to feel more repetitive. interesting as a song that way, i guess.

Therokinrolla: **patronsaintofaspies** (9): Definitely one of our most unique rate winners ever, and it's probably going to continue to be the most downright experimental one unless Bj√∂rk wins her first true rate in November. Despite being art pop, like more songs in the genre than you'd expect, Two Weeks isn't abrasive or off-putting; FKA's breathy vocals combine with the lucid, ethereal production to make a song that takes a few listens to get, but remains beautiful to listen to all just the same. This rate is really making me want to check out albums featured in the rates that I've missed, isn't it?


**rickikardashian** (9): Best song out of a fucking terrible album. Still pissed at this Slumber Partying against the entirety of Grimes album. Im not even a Grimes stan, but she deserved to win, 10 times more. If i wasn‚Äôt a decent human being I would sabotage this to make sure it‚Äô‚Äôs a Day 1 song, but I‚Äôm a nice fucking person and I know this is fucking great, I hate this

**Solovrinne** (9): I LIVE for the synths. This song just puts you in a MOOD.

**aulyve** (8): Drop new music queen.

**HoodooMooJuice** (8): it's a slow burn, I wish it dropped.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I kind of like this.

**MashLuke** (8): the time her career lasted. Jk she cool

**mysario** (8): one of the worst in the rate but it's still wicked good. I hate doing this rate

**welcometoNY** (8): her best song hands down

**notdallin** (7.8): [](#twigs)

**Roxieloxie** (7.8): what is this

**jamesfog** (7.5): Her only good song

**frogaranaman** (7): I don‚Äôt remember any of what the fuck I just listened to, but I guess mood?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Ah yes, the Grizzly Bear song.

**ZankeeZero** (7): fight me, but as an FKA Twigs stan this is one of the worst songs on LP1 (which means something considering it's still a 7) Pendulum and Give Up deserved!

**ReallyCreative** (6.7): Probably my favorite FKA Twigs song but she's one artist I don't understand, even if I can recognize that she's talented

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): i understand the appeal but can't really vibe with it

**radiofan15** (6.2): I remember having heard of her when she was dating Robert Pattinson and tried to listen to some of her music and then, realizing it was the kind of "weird" stuff you need to pay attention, I left it aside until I had the time. I never went back to her. But listening to this song I knew I didn't missed that much.

**original\_doll** (6): excepting 'higher than a motherfucker' I have no idea what she's saying lol

>Despite Lush Life winning for literally the entire rate, Blow Your Mind (Mwah) (which is not even the best song on the album when songs like Lost In Your Light, Begging, and Be The One exist) somehow pulled out the win over more deserving songs. But it's a cute gay bop and Slumber Party'd the rate. Thank god Bebe did not win. Thank you. - /u/jamesfog
>
>It was so tragic that this won when literally every Bebe song was robbed, smh. Anyway, this was definitely one of the most deserving songs in the rate and Dua deserved the win for having the best album in the rate. She blew our minds (i‚Äôm sorry) with the results of its first rate, and let‚Äôs hope it pulls through and can beat the rate powerhouse that is britney spears and win this one too! - /u/shipsinker44

---

**letsallpoo** (7): While "New Rules" went on to achieve global dominance, "Blow Your Mind (Mwah)" wasn't released to much fanfare, intsead becoming a fan favorite track. It's short (just under three minutes long), simple, sassy, and a whole lot of fun. It plays to Dua's strengths well, whose kisses don't really have a purpose in the song other than to sound cool and give the gays something to imitate in their Grindr bios. I didn't really expect this to win its rate, but considering what it was up against, I guess it makes sense.

**Therokinrolla** (8): Blow Your Mind (Mwah) is total /r/popheads core: a unique female voice, clean and precise production, and a superb hook that introduces a chorus that begins as a bop and ends as a banger. Also the gays can sassily pose and say "Mwah" very homosexually. BYM isn't a revolutionary or an introduction of something new to the pop scene, but it IS extremely well written and is my personal favorite from her self titled debut.

# Alive, Ain't No Dollar Sign
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): gooood hearing this song live was such a bombastic feeling

**camerinian** (10): This really is the perfect synthesis of all of Dua‚Äôs best traits. Her strange blend of soulfulness and brattiness combine perfectly over that frankly disgusting chorus beat.

**CarlieScion** (10): why is this here when the actual winner of this rate was Hotter than Hell? :thinking:

**frogaranaman** (10): https://youtu.be/KLtLbiQBe8s?t=56s

**gannade** (10): love the aesthetic

**hikkaru** (10): This winning over New Rules (but almost losing to Lush fucking Life) was iconic

**ignitethephoenix** (10): First I‚Äôm super glad this won its rate (cause I never did it). Second, this is such a good song and probably Dua‚Äôs best. The production is epic, and I like Dua‚Äôs vocals and and how she has fun with the lyrics.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): dua can fist me tbh

**MrSwearword** (10): DUA LIPA'S BEST SONG. NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

**mysario** (10): kisskiss

**PuggleMaster** (10): Chile i know the salty Zara stans are gonna sabotage this, praying for day 2!

**Shadow1087** (10): dua said gay rights

**shipsinker44** (10): omg the song that won my rate :gaycat: its not gonna be getting my eleven in this rate but it did in that one which it still and always will deserve

**static\_int\_husp** (10): A good rate winning upset

**twat\_brained** (10): Dua fucking snapped here! Speaking of which I need to purchase a physical copy of her Complete Edition. Yes, I am still **that** bitch who will purchase CDs. When an album has as much killer and as little filler as hers, what reason is there not to??

**WilsonJason** (10): dual epas best song

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): :kisskiss:

**HoodooMooJuice** (9.5): exciting and extra, so glad Dua didn't flop.

**Solovrinne** (9.5): It slaps, it's sassy, it's Dua's best bop.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.4): i was this close to uploading the entire five minute video i took of her performing this in glasgow but im just gonna link my gifs of my video instead SHE HAS STAGE PRESENCE YALL JUST HATE EASTERN EUROPEANS https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/goldscars/166307333370

**radiofan15** (9.1): She can keep the "mwah" but even with that this song is amazing and i'll never understand how it took her until New Rules to really blew up.

**1998tweety** (9): TikTok memes won.

**Bendariaku89** (9): this was definitely designed and manufactured to probably be a perfect pop song. i don‚Äôt think it quite manages that, but it certainly bangs and the production is impecabble.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9): dua wiga

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): So much swagger and confidence here. Dua really knows how to sell a song and I  don‚Äôt see her stopping anytime soon.

**dropthehammer11** (9): mwah

**MashLuke** (9): Dua can blow me anything really

**original\_doll** (9): nice to see some personality and energy from Dua

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): This sure was an unexpected win for me. I'd given it my 11 and I predicted it to be Top 5 material, maybe Top 3 at best, due to the Lemonade effect. Instead, it ended up being my fourth lucky bet. It sure may not be as historic or culturally and critically significant as Toxic or Run Away With Me, but I find Blow Your Mind to be a serious contender for Dua's best single; expertly fit for the runway much like its EDM sister One Kiss, Blow Your Mind manages to exemplify high class messiness so well that you can almost hear the cameras flash when you listen to it. Dua's lip smacking is also, surprisingly, not at all disgusting.

**strawberryswing1** (9): Lush Life deserved

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): I played Dua Lipa for my family like a year ago and now my dad loves her, especially this song. My impact

**notdallin** (8.7): queen of correctly spelling out the onomatopoeia of a kissing sound

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): my girlfriend snapped :)

**ZankeeZero** (8.5): I used to enjoy this a lot more, but something about the spoken word part of the chorus sorta turned me off it? it's still great though.

**enecks** (8): Dua Lipa new main pop girl H Y P E

**FireLordAegon** (8): Dua with a hint of a personality... who even knew she had one? Ok but seriously although not my favorite Dua Lipa song, I do want her to head down this direction.

**nooodisaster** (8): The New Rules sabotage was far too much tbqh. This song is a solid 8, catchy and sexy but nothing revolutionary.

**SpanKKy1** (8): friendly reminder that she loves control deserved to win this rate

**tapdancingpig** (8): I wish this broke through to the US.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Daily reminder I was front row for Dua Lipa with a record for her to sign 5 minutes before my festival got cancelled for thunderstorms

**Tomoki** (8): Good chorus, pretty bland verses.

**lunasaflowers** (7.8): Very fun! Think I'm finally really coming around to Dua's husky voice.

**ExtraEater** (7.5): the true beginning of it all

**stansymash** (7.4): thanks due lip

# Dead In A Ditch

**jamesfog** (7): DID NOT DESERVE TO WIN THE RATE!

**JohnnyBAverage** (7): good, doesn‚Äôt exactly‚Ä¶. Blow my mind (bum tiss)

**skargardin** (7): What is it about this song that I don‚Äôt get? Everyone seems to praise it to the heavens but it has never clicked with me. I mean it‚Äôs good but is it rate winner-worthy good?

**aulyve** (6.5): Captain Cardboard comes through with a decent bop.

**J\_Toe** (5): There are other Dua songs I prefer WAY more to this (sorry)

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): Mediocre, although I had to chuckle at the random LGBT flag in the video

**dramiaa** (4): This was great the first hundred listens, but now Im really over it

**welcometoNY** (4): dua's worst solo song

>Oh No is considered one of the best songs of Marina, it was chosen the best in Top 10 Pop 10 in this subreddit and won a rate where it competed with songs like Dog Days Are Over and Cameo Lover which are also considered by some to be the best songs of Florence and Kimbra. I think it is pretty easy to see why, even if you don't look at the lyrics the song has so much to offer. Production, handled by Greg Kurstin, is amazing and the one-two punch at the beginning of the song immediately hooks you in. The chorus itself is really satisfying and in the end you find yourself dancing. I personally see this song as one of her best written, it talks about how you go worse and worse as you believe all the pessimistic things you thought about yourself when you were down and live your life based on them, which is referred to as self-fulfilled prophecy. - /u/Leixander
>
>In February's 2010s Indie Pop Debuts rate, three slightly-left-of-field pop songstresses by the names of Marina, Florence, and Kimbra competed against each other for the crown; and, despite having the lowest album average of the three records and many users predicting an early bow-out for her Family Jewels low in the top 10, it was one shiny little single by the artist formerly known as Marina And The Diamonds, Oh No!, that reigned victorious, winning with a lovely 9.384 average and eight 11s to its name.
>
>It's not hard to see why r/popheads users connected with Oh No!; it's a deeply relatable piece of tumblrcore pop perfection, from the pows of its opening synths to the glittering flourishes of percussive piano chords that characterise the track, as Marina, in her classic early-era emotive theatricality, sings of all the extremes she's caught between in: assured ego and debilitating self-doubt, hard reality and celebrity glamour, knowing the ills that will fall if she gets what she wants and being unable to not fulfill her self-determined prophecy. It's the centrepiece of The Family Jewels, and ruled in its own rate...but can it do the same here? Let's see! - /u/lunasaflowers

---

**Therokinrolla** (9): Oh No! is an interesting song. It is not my favorite Marina song, but it certainly impresses me with Marina's fascinating ability to be so confident in her... uncertainty. Oh No! is an assertion of her want and need to be a pop star, yet at the same time uncertain that it's the best thing for her. She is perfectly built to be a pop star, and she holds this goal higher than all else. She lists the faults in her that make her pop star material, saying, "I feel like I'm the worst so I always act like I'm the best," surely a common feeling amongst plenty. This song overall feels like a gigantic paradox, two competing ideas that at the same time make total sense. It immediately connects to those that struggle with anxiety and can even question the most certain and undeniably true things. And what better way to introduce Marina Diamandis? The simultaneously outspoken and insecure, the artist that is indie in the same way the Starbucks Pink Drink is a "secret" menu item, and the artist that released the very materialistic "The Family Jewels" and the introspective and transcendental "Froot." It is one of the things that makes Marina who she is and not just another "indie girl xd". That, and she has the worlds most confusing stage name.

# Exactly What I Want

**Leixander** (11): Objectively, there are better songs in this rate. But I love this the most.

**lunasaflowers** (11): Not just getting my 11 because it won my rate-- The Family Jewels is my favourite album of all time, and this song is everything to me. This is the song that defined my adolescence and the song that made me discover and love music. Thank you, Marina.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): this is going out day 1 but at least i can prolong it to not embarrassingly bad on day 1! the punk agenda will fall!!!

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): not even the best from the album and still a 10, marina is truly iconique

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): God this song is so fucking amazing and I know it will be done wrong in the rate because of stanning, but it's just so fucking good.

**CarlieScion** (10): :kimbryell:

**Dracyoshi** (10): OH NO! I dig how overdramatic this song is, it's the perfect song for when you're just tired of your issues and want to poke fun at them while wallowing in self-pity.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I first heard this song on a Just Dance and that‚Äôs how I discovered this amazing song! This song should have been a hit!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Marina and the Diamonds

**moooo566** (10): If I had another eleven

**MrSwearword** (10): it robbed Dog Days Are Over and Hollywood. However, it's still a very good song.

**original\_doll** (10): I think "tv taught me how to feel, now real life has no appeal" is one of my fave lyrics ever

**Roxieloxie** (10): unlike hung up i head this song in the plug one day and i really loved it

**shipsinker44** (10): QUEEN MARINA WITH HER B E S T SONG

**Solovrinne** (10): It took me such a long time to get into this song. Now I can't believe I ever hated it.

**SpanKKy1** (10): everyone remember to buy clean bandit - baby ft marinara and the meatballs and despacito guy

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I haven't listened to too many Marina and the Diamonds songs, but this is the first single I've ever heard, and....hmm, I'm getting the impression that her vocal delivery used to be...questionable, at best. Oh, well, sometimes you can't get everything in life. Marina's voice is alright, most of the time, but it's a big part of why I can't board the hype train for Oh No!. It's not the quality of the lady's pipes themselves that unnerve me, but how high and forced she makes every other line sound, and how much she makes her normally entertaining Welsh accent jar with everything else. While these things did end up negatively affecting my score for Oh No!, however, I do enjoy Marina's songwriting skills on this track. Maybe the lyrics get a little too obnoxious in trying to sound like social commentary, but they're hilariously campy, and Marina keeps the song full of hooks, inserting a pleasantly airy bridge featuring a memorable clash of contradictions ('I'm gonna live/I'm gonna flu, I'm gonna fail/I'm gonna die'). Though her artistic foothold may not be quite here yet, Oh No, definitely sounds as an early standout and decent single.

# Oh No, No!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): This may have been an okay song in the rate it was in, but up against these other songs it pales in comparison.

**J\_Toe** (3): I've never got into Marina. I was hoping this rate would help with that. It didn't.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (3): I don't think this is it

**camerinian** (2): I really wanted to participate in this original rate because I love Florence and Kimbra but that would have meant listening to Marina, and at that point the only song I‚Äôd heard from her was Primadonna and I hated it, so I ended up sitting it out. Well now here I am, full of regret, because this ended up winning and holy shit what actually is this. The verses are fine but the rest is so deeply annoying, like how can you people stand this, much less stan it? This is like the worst parts of Gwen Stefani, Katy Perry and Lily Allen combined. She is so squeaky on the pre-chorus, the chorus melody is like a power drill to the ears.. Now that Dua Lipa exists to fill the role of deep-voiced British pop starlet, can we leave this behind? How this beat out Cameo Lover and Dog Days will forever mystify me.

**enecks** (2): I used to date someone who stanned Marina. She got me into her music. Life was good. Then she got into an argument with me and said I deserved to get raped. I broke up with her. I broke up with liking Marina.

**radiofan15** (0): OK honey, you were right about how "it has no appeal"... your singing is irritating and the chorus is such a bunch of nothing... also I COULD SWEAR THIS WAS 6 MINUTES LONG but it's apparently "only" 3 minutes long.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (0): You know what, maybe I just don't like Marina

[/r/popheads/comments/a014kf/the_popheads_winners_rate_day_2_a_good_ye_to_die/eadtlzm/]

=====

Therokinrolla: **tapdancingpig** (10): This song was my intro to Marina. It was on my favorite Just Dance game (y‚Äôall dabbled with weed in college, I messed with Just Dance), and I routinely use this song to illustrate that pop songs can have substance to them.

**twat\_brained** (10): Did I lie? I love the insight this offers into fame and Marina's concerns over embodying it. Thankfully, this doesn't appear to have happened to her, which I think has definitely been aided by the time she's taken to figure herself out and remain out of the public eye.

**ZankeeZero** (10): I was thinking about protecting my Marina stan brand here but I think i'm gonna have to pass on giving this an 11 though.

**JohnnyBAverage** (9.7): A too relatable

**1998tweety** (9.5): A great song. /u/The_PC_demands_blood has made several points.

**bespectacIed** (9.5): So quintessentially marina. Marina pit The Family Jewels on spotify challenge :(

**mysario** (9.5): I have no idea how to describe this to people but it slays

**stansymash** (9.2): i would like to apologise to god herself for never listening to this song before. i am instantly in love

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): I‚Äôm still salty about this winning over ‚ÄúDog Days are Over‚Äù but I hold massive respect for this one. It‚Äôs a lot better than I thought

**FireLordAegon** (8.5): this is more like a 7.5 but "No! My name is Marina"

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.3): ugh htgkmo marina

**VodkaInsipido** (8): marina is now at a mcdonalds

**notdallin** (7.8): ok, I get why you guys stan Marina now: ‚ÄúCause I feel like I'm the worst, So I always act like I'm the best.‚Äù

**jamesfog** (7.5): BOP, but dated.

**MashLuke** (7.5): her accent make me cackle

**LandonKidatrea** (7): This song isn't on Spotify so I had to watch the music vid on Youtube and HOLY CRAP Marina Diamandis is so pretty! Anyways the song's a solid bop.

**nooodisaster** (7): The chorus is catchy and I'm sure the lyrics resonate with self-hating teenagers, but a rate winner?

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): charli cxc

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): sorry /u/THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD this ain't it

**frogaranaman** (6): I feel like I‚Äôm about to come across fandom discourse on my dash now.

>Two years ago, back in the rate that this song won, I said: ‚ÄúThis song is perfect. This is one of the songs that we need to attach to spaceships and send to outer space when we scout for alien life.‚Äù And you know what? I still hold to that, this song has aged like the finest of wines. And it‚Äôs not the standard loud, fast paced ‚Äúbop‚Äù that usually wins these rates. What other songs do with energy, ‚ÄúSay It Right‚Äù does with elegance. It starts almost empty, demanding your attention at every moment, as it slowly adds more layers in the ethereal vocals. In short, the song is haunting. So much so that 12 years after its release, it feels as if it never really left at all. - /u/TeamAwesome4

---

**Therokinrolla** (8): Everyone knows Say It Right, I mean really, everyone does. A song that so delicately balances sensuality and uncertainty deserves its widespread fame and acclaim. It feels like a whisper, but the most important one you've ever heard. She isn't urgent but she doesn't seem patient either. Sure, its just another song about a girl asking a guy to let her know if they can work, but it doesn't feel overdone or dramatic. It feels assured and realistic, but hopeful. And I think that is what is so grabbing about the song and what allows it to stick with you for longer than most other bog-standard pop love songs: the intimacy and whistfulness, which just come together so beautifully for the "promiscuous girl."

# Said It Wrong

**yatcho** (11): This song is SO ahead of its time. The lyrics are almost complete nonsense, but that adds to the amazing atmosphere. Also its not fair Nelly and Timbaland have all but disappeared and I have to crusade for this song to not be forgotten

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Nelly Furtado + Timberland = legendary music that doesn‚Äôt get old

**jamesfog** (10): The epitome of a nostalgic classic

**Leixander** (10): pop classic

**MashLuke** (10): so good Nelly, you can say it in any way

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): the intro to this timeless bop sounds so similar to Carly‚Äôs ‚ÄúFever‚Äù

**MrSwearword** (10): Promiscuous was fucking robbed but a great NELLEGEND GODTADO track, regardless.

**sighcology** (10): i wish i could also give this 11

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.7): NELLY FURTADO SINGS THSI?? a fucking eleven. god fuck this rate.

**mysario** (9.5): truly ahead of its time

**1998tweety** (9.4): Nelly and Timbaland are an amazing duo.

**notdallin** (9.4): IF Y‚ÄôALL RATING THIS SONG BELOW AN 9 Y‚ÄôALL NOT SAYIN‚Äô IT RIGHT AT ALL

**twat\_brained** (9.1): This, Mirrors and The Way I Are are the holy trinity of Timbaland works. Also, I'm really not sure why Nelly Furtado's career seemingly went nowhere after this; this was a #1 song! Even though I can't tell all of the lyrics, it's still incredibly solid and holds up reasonably well.

**enecks** (9): holy shit I slept on Nelly

**followingfreeways** (9): wtf this song is a classic and I never knew it called this or by Nelly furtado?? Im shook

**ReallyCreative** (9): It's so simple but it's soooo soooo soooo good, the chorus is just mystical

**Solovrinne** (9): Who didn't love this song?

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): god what a fucking jam

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Timbaland x Nelly Furtado in the mid 2000s was a combination that produced literally nothing but bops and I will not take any other opinions. As far as Nelly singles I probably prefer Promiscuous but this one is great too.

**whatareblackhole** (9): OMG I always forget what this song is called but it is the perfect slutbop

**stansymash** (8.6): give the guy saying "hey" in the background a raise

**1313Harbor** (8.5): I just noticed that the beginning of this song sounds EXACTLY like CRJ‚Äôs Fever.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I'm picking this for the song that grew on me most of all during the process of rating this playlist. The first time I heard it, I went 'eh, what's that weird plasticky synth?' and aside from the immediately enjoyable 80s-influenced hook, Nelly Furtado's voice didn't end up impressing me much at all. In succeeding listens, though, I came to realize that I actually found these elements in Say It Right beneficial, over distracting or dated. Nelly doesn't belt or go off here like you might expect from other singers, but her vulnerable delivery works incredibly well with Timbaland's slow and seductive production in the background. I'm not sure if it's one of the best pop songs of the 00s, but it's definitely gotten better with age.

**radiofan15** (8.5): Back in the day I found this as typical third single material, that would be inferior to the prececessors (in this case Promiscuous and Maneater)... I still think that, but at least I can appreciate it more than before

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I love Timbaland and Danja so much.

**banananaise** (8): i'm sorry, this is a great song, but out of ALL the songs on Loose, yall picked Say It Right??? not Maneater? Promiscuous? not even All Good Things?

**camerinian** (8): Imma be real I feel like this is missing a chorus, like it feels kind of abrupt ending where it does. Still a banger of a track and a monster of a hook, and I guess if my complaint is that I want more of it it can‚Äôt be that bad

**CarlieScion** (8): bop

**frogaranaman** (8): I feel like I‚Äôm about to be a slut.

**shipsinker44** (8): this is rlycute

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Extreme bop

# Said It Wrong

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Never quite got off the ground for me.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): tbh a weaker timbaland hit

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7): mediocre outside of its rate.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): ‚ÄúPromiscuous‚Äù and ‚ÄúManeater‚Äù didn‚Äôt get snubbed for *this* to win. I mean, it‚Äôs not bad but *come on*.

**dramiaa** (7): The chorus is catchy AS HELL, but at the same time its repetitive AS HELL. huh

**RandomHypnotica** (7): i was digging this song, but then it kind of never went anywhere

**Roxieloxie** (7): its alright.

**gannade** (6.5): Promiscuous and any of fergies 5 singles and hips dont lie >>>>>

**HoodooMooJuice** (6.5): I can tell the beat's trying to go hard, but it's putting me to sleep.

**FireLordAegon** (6): I like her other songs better. I did like this more since the first time I heard it however.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Relistening to this, I'm surprised how kinda boring it is? Like i felt like this was more fun before.

**hikkaru** (4): Promiscuous was robbed af just let me say that

**selegend** (4): We all know why this is here

**cyborglilith** (2): extremely boring

>Easily one of Kacey Musgraves biggest song, it was not a HUGE surprise this won. The Grammy winning song, written by Kacey with highly acclaimed writers Josh Osborne and Shane McAnally, was Kacey's debut to the world. Showing a masterclass in songwriting, Kacey shows the mundane life of middle America. The cycles people get into, whether they want to or not. The somber song doesn't attack rural life, but instead shows a passing observation of it. The song had me hooked from the first listen, and Kacey's had my heart ever since. Now while I don't think she deserved to decimate Kelsea like she did, there's no doubt that this song will go down as one of the greatest country songs of the 2010's. - /u/NapsAndNetflix

---

**letsallpoo** (10): Country music is often cited as "three chords, and the truth," and "Merry Go 'Round" embodies that description perfectly. Over a layered but simple string instrumental, Kacey sings plainly about smalltown country life and how its cyclical toxcitiy impacts generations of people. She never full-on criticizes this lifestyle - her lyrics are more like passing observations of something that's not right for her. Three studio albums later, I still consider this song as Kacey's lyrical peak, and I'm happy /r/popheads recognized it for the greatness it is.

# Country

**LandonKidatrea** (11): I love this song. It's so well written and poignant. It blew me away on my first listen. I live in the Philippines so we don't really have trailer parks, but everything else resonated with me so much. Seeing this conservative ideal of fulfillment be painted with such bleak colors is cathartic for me, but it makes me wonder how many of my friends and relatives who did follow this route in life are actually fucking miserable. Kacey Musgraves is a damn talented songwriter.

**notdallin** (11): not even kacey‚Äôs best song and it still earns my 11. Amazing wordplay that somehow rides the line between classic and clich√©, yet sounding completely fresh. Instantly relatable, inspiring, nostalgic, and beautiful. The fact that it‚Äôs a country song also adds to its wonder considering how few people fw country music; and yet no one who listens to this song will admit that they don‚Äôt feel something when she sings ‚Äúand just like dust we settle in this town.‚Äù

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): adorably lovable lyrics, sweet instrumental, beautiful vocal delivery. thats how u do it folks.

**dramiaa** (10): The best song in Kacey‚Äôs album, I always gave this my 11 in the Country Girls Rate (but I just had to give it to Maren, sry Kacey). The songwriting is the highlight ‚Äì the lyrics are incredible

**ExtraEater** (10): sleepy town blues

**gannade** (10): Kacey is a WOKE queen. drag the midwest that voted for trump!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): She's a motherfucking QUEEN! She DESTROYED this with iconic lyrics!

**nooodisaster** (10): wow. EDIT: OKAY I JUST WANTED TO MIC DROP THAT BUT I HAVE TO WRITE MORE. This legit left me speechless. I said, whoever didn't do the country-pop rate (me), your mom's a hoe. From the first line, Kacey drops truth bomb after declaration nearly every line. Just the chorus twists so much lyrically; it's genius. This amount of societal self-critique was unheard of in country music for me, and now I'm hooked.

**original\_doll** (10): ngl I thought Golden Hour was overhyped, but I might have to give Kacey a 2nd chance. This song is exceptionally well written! as someone who lives in a southern small town I'm living for her pointed criticisms and also can relate to the sense of resignation in this song over being kind of stuck in the ways of life as it is here

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Probably my favorite recent rate winner (even though it didn't get my 11 then, nor does it get it now)

**strawberryswing1** (10): ü§†ü§†ü§† Stream Golden Hour, the 2018 AOTY ü§†ü§†ü§†

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the lyricism jumped out

**welcometoNY** (10): maren was robbed in this rate but this is still a great song

**ZankeeZero** (10): aww

**stansymash** (9.7): okay just because i have listened to next to no country music whatsoever doesn't mean my opinion that this is the greatest country song ever has no weight

**1998tweety** (9.5): Kacey's songwriting is at its best in this song. I love it when artists use the same word in different ways.

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): love the mary lines, that was pretty genius. this song is just really well executed.

**Dracyoshi** (9.5): I love the mixing in Kacey Musgraves' discography; it feels intimate and natural. It doesn't sound like I'm listening to a recording, but like she's there in front of me. I love some good mixing. It especially stands out on Merry Go 'Round!

**HoodooMooJuice** (9.5): This is so pretty, so soft...

**camerinian** (9): can‚Äôt wait for all the ‚ÄúI hate country but‚Äù metropolitan apartment dwellers to show up for this one. Stop pretending the music on the radio represents the whole genre, if you did that for any other type of music people would justifiably call you stupid, but because it‚Äôs popular to shit on country you can get away with pigeonholing the whole genre as meaty bro-dicks who love trucks, because you‚Äôre too narrow-minded to move outside of the mainstream framework. Anyway this song‚Äôs pretty good

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): Sad country that manages to not be sappy at all. I applaud you Kacey.

**JohnnyBAverage** (9): This is going to be so hard considering this is the first song I‚Äôm listening to in the rate. As someone from a small little hick town this definitely hits deep; HOWEVER i must take into consideration everything I‚Äôm rating against. Also in High School this one girl did a weird interpretive dance to this song which at the time I thought was cringey but that I now understand as genius. You know what, for that It‚Äôll be rated higher fuck it.

**mysario** (9): corny lyrics I love to sing

**raicicle** (9): i hear summ,,,and it slaps!

**RandomHypnotica** (9): me before this song "ew country is gross" me after this song "yee haw"

# Coun-tried

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (7): I grew up in a small Midwest town. this is the soundtrack to my Facebook news feed. accurate but sad

**frogaranaman** (7): I think I have to go fuck my cousin now.

**jamesfog** (7): 80s Mercedes or Follow Your Arrow are better.

**Roxieloxie** (7): i thought this was early taylor swift at first

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): where is the merry go round emoji

**amumumyspiritanimal** (6.8): Not really her best tbh, I'm sorry

**yatcho** (6.8): it's cute but all the gorgeous in this rate devours cute

**MashLuke** (6.5): I'm too european for this

**SpanKKy1** (6.5): I would like to publicly apologise to /u/napsandnetflix for not giving this a 10

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6.2): poo you‚Äôre gonna be so mad you waited for my scores so long and this lol. idk, i feel like i vastly overrated most of kacey‚Äôs debut during the country girls rate. i still like the mary-mary-mary-mary scheme and kacey‚Äôs voice is soothing but it‚Äôs an awful clich√©. oof.

**MrSwearword** (6): I never quite liked the fact this sounds like something that won Platinum Star in a country themed or challenge that was centered around reworking a nursery rhyme into a song.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): 80's mercedes deserved

**J\_Toe** (5): look i know people like country but every time I here the twang of a banjo I just remember that TIL about country music producing the same stimulus to the brain that pain does

**aulyve** (4): Pbbbbbbt no.

Therokinrolla: **ReallyCreative** (8.6): Not my favorite Kacey song, but as someone that lives in Appalachia, these lyrics really resonate with me.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): While I ended up not having the time to do our country rate, I did decide to listen to Kacey's debut album out of my love for Golden Hour, and it certainly didn't disappoint. Along with Blowin' Smoke, Merry Go 'Round was my immediate pick for the record's immediate standout. While Kacey's lyricism still remains sharp as ever years after her career started, there's wordplay and subtle themes here that are a little harder to find off her most recent release, using the words 'Mary' and a few of its homonyms so cleverly that you'll hardly end up missing anything the first time around, and by the end of it you're just impressed with Kacey's wit. I definitely love my country bops from the lady, but I also love songs like this one.

**shipsinker44** (8.5): this is so cute! why did it win

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Kacey‚Äôs lyrics are as absolutely devastating and sharp as always.

**FireLordAegon** (8.4): I love Kacey. She is just the cutest!

**twat\_brained** (8.4): I'm gonna be 21 in 4 months but I'm committed to a childfree lifestyle and I'm agnostic oop tradition can kiss my ass. Also I'm gonna say "Country Mary" three times while looking into a mirror and hopefully Kacey will appear

**amacaroon** (8): I really shouldn‚Äôt be able to relate but I kinda do

**enecks** (8): Can I get uh... chart hit for Musgraves

**ignitethephoenix** (8): These lyrics are so good and cutting to the small town culture. I love her commentary and imagery so much.

**mamas\_spaghettini** (8): mary mary quackenshmary

Inside the ocean is a vivid party - pink strobe lights illuminate the deep pits of the ocean; there‚Äôs a giant orgy of people of all genders violently humping each other. The chorus is so brash and abrasive, full of sexual ardor as Lovato persuades a girl friend to ‚Äútake [Lovato] down into [girl‚Äôs] paradise‚Äù. The electric guitars build a sense of urgency with the fast-paced EDM production and Lovato‚Äôs loud, earnest vocals. The rotation between gradual sensuality (the verses and the bridge) and raw, hardcore lesbian sex (the pre-chorus and chorus) fulfills the feeling of sexuality - the verses are the foreplay and the chorus is the sex, the cherry-biting, a harsh, remorseless rush of adrenaline. The sexual rollercoaster is bolstered by Lovato‚Äôs voice circling as she sings ‚Äúbody tYYYYYpe‚Äù. Max Martin and co. found the bop optimum for Lovato‚Äôs razor-edged voice and her need to prove herself as a force in the pop music industry. It‚Äôs no surprise that this unapologetically and directly gay rollercoaster of a song won our first ex-acts rate. - /u/selegend

**letsallpoo** (10): Songs about bicuriousness are often controversial. It can't just be about girls kissing girls; our shifting views on sexuality and the hypersensitive Twitterverse demand to know why girls and how girls and what girls. Speaking of girls, the great "Girls" stan war, which spanned multiple messy /r/popheads threads on the Rita song, is a testament to how sensitive a topic sexual orientation can be. Demi avoided most of that discussion when she dropped "Cool for the Summer," and the reasons are numerous. The song is quite coy, not only in how Demi sings to her lover, but also in that lover's gender identity - there's no pronouns or any other explicit gendered language. But still, there's only so many ways to interpret a line like "Got a taste for the cherry / I just need to take a bite," and the title itself operates as its own invented [queer slang](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lesbian-slang-terms-definitions).

But back to the song, which is so *fucking* good. The tinkling piano starts the song off gently, then transitions to a searing electric guitar right when the chorus hits, ramping up the song from sexy subtlty to cataclismic carnality in an instant. Both instruments carry the same melody (thank you, Max Martin) and Demi rides them perfectly, shouting and cooing when appropriate, drawing out "Body tyyyype" like she's drawing curves with her voice. It's been my song of the summer for every summer since 2015, and I don't see that changing in the coming years.

# Demi stans

**gannade** (11): I have really grown to love Demi. I think she's a great role model for how honest she is and how willing she is to let her fans learn from her mistakes. Cool For The Summer is a total bop, but it also reads like a vulnerable Demi trying to escape from all her troubles for just one night to have one hell of a time. It's a mood tbh, and it's sugar-coated pop perfection.

**hikkaru** (11): Listen up y'all I DON'T CARE if talented legends of music like Madonna and Prince are in this rate. I don't care that there are more critically acclaimed popheads faves like Carly or Lorde, DEMI IS GETTING MY 11. This song is just pure bliss and perfection to me, the raw POWER of it all is just so mind blowing. The piano riff shakes me to the core and then the EXPLOSION of guitars is just so perfect. It even has an iconic vine associated with it, how many of the other songs can relate? Let me tell you, "die for each other" outsold and outpeaked saxophone seal and that's the tea!

**PuggleMaster** (11): I wanted to give my 11 to one of my winners, but Demi deserves this one. Especially since i didn't give her my 11 in the original rate.

**selegend** (11): just read my blurb tbh

**shipsinker44** (11): this song fucking deserves everything. i wouldnt even call it demis best song becauee her discog is so spectacular but its still absolutrly one of the best pop songs this decade

**TragicKingdom1** (11): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/291004511000985600/496488996344692737/Screen_Shot_2018-10-01_at_6.09.30_PM.png?width=800&height=415

**1313Harbor** (10): If this is lesbianbait, consider me baited.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): agh my gay awakening starts over again everytime i hear this song

**animefangrant62** (10): was gonna give this an 11 but Ribs exists

**Bendariaku89** (10): this song is just really fun, and very fun to sing. it‚Äôs certainly odd compared to the other songs i gave a ten (hell it‚Äôs in my top 10), but that doesn‚Äôt make the song any less amazing.

**bloupp** (10): Queen of ending global warming

**camerinian** (10): I can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt like this when it originally came out, I genuinely have no idea why. Those punchy electric guitar flourishes over the chorus are, like, mosh-ready, and it just feels huge. Like, everything about this song is arena-sized, and Demi is putting everything into this. I wish she would have made more songs like this and Confident instead of going to the boring middle of the road stuff she made on her newest album

**enecks** (10): @KatyPerry this is how you do a bi bop

**ExtraEater** (10): dead (for each other)

**followingfreeways** (10): this is SUCH a bop and low-key made me question my sexuality when it came out lolol

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I honestly forgot about this song until recently, but this goes so hard for a pop song. Love the fun and sexy vibe it has, and the intense production with the guitars, and how that contrasts with the piano.

# Halsey stans

**warmishblood** (5.5): Demi sounds like Halsey here

**aulyve** (5): Man I wish this were better produced. Great melody but the shredding in the chorus is so silly and the drums are just atrocious.

**kappyko** (5): confident is better i will die on this hill

**dramiaa** (3): haha

**welcometoNY** (3): wow i always forget how much i hate this. kinda saved by the last chorus but the rest is a hot mess.

**MrSwearword** (1): still hate this even worse I Kissed a Girl like I did then. BYE

**nooodisaster** (0): Wow I actually felt physically ill listening to the first 10 seconds of this, lemme just move my 0 over to this...

**strawberryswing1** (0): Every once in a while there will be a song that smashes and everyone seems to find amazing and super catchy that I don't understand the appeal of at all. I know it's kind of a circlejerk on this sub to shit on Meghan Trainor, but when "All About That Bass" came out, I really didn't understand how so many people found it good and catchy. That's how I feel about this song. I admit I'm not a big fan of Demi's music or personality in general, but I've listened to this song multiple times trying to "get" what I'm missing from it and I just can't. It's so noisy and just....not good. Sometimes Demi's screeching works well in songs, like Heart Attack, but there's nothing about this song that I enjoy. I'm sorry u/selegend please forgive me.

Therokinrolla: # Sorry guys, our blurbs for this were big so we had to move a lot of comments here lol

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Demi's best song that isn't from her Disney days.

**MashLuke** (10): how can she be cool when she's hot in every season

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): should‚Äôve been Demi‚Äôs first number 1

**Tedyonce** (10): Demi's sexist and most pussy-poppable song

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): The POWER of this song, I love how explosive the chorus is. It just keeps building and building and getting more and more epic, and just when you think the song has peaked, it hits that amazing, huge, enormous, wonderful, crazy final hook. That "ooh-woo-ooh-ooh!!" on the post-chorus is 10 worthy alone.

**twat\_brained** (10): C

G-F-D#-F-D#-F-C

G-F-D#-F-D#-F-C

G-F-D#-F-D#-F-C

That's all Max needs to play on piano to hook listeners right in. Combine that with Demi's modulation between a sultry tone and her all-conquering chest voice, you have pop greatness flood your ears for a solid 3 and a half minutes.

**WilsonJason** (10): such a good song holy hell I fell in love with it from first listen


**cyborglilith** (9.8): legit I love every song with the word summer in the title

**radiofan15** (9.7): My favorite Demo song and it's such a shame SNS was the one that the GP latched onto because this is near-perfection, I mean HOLY SHIT THAT GUITAR OR SYNTHS OR WHATEVER IT WAS AFTER THE CHORUS

**1998tweety** (9.6): The singles off this album are amazing: CFTS, Confidant, and Stone Cold. They all stand out in their own ways, but this comes the closest to pop perfection out of any of Demi's songs.

**ulikejazz** (9.6): D I E   F O R   E A C H   O T H E R. No but seriously, I don‚Äôt really understand the vibe of this song. It‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ Aggressive? Really catchy tho, I kind of love it

**HoodooMooJuice** (9.5): Pop rock is my favorite and Demi slays it with this one!

**mysario** (9.5): loses some appeal when it's way past Summer here in New England and we only keep warm from our fire hot sports streak

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): I played demi lavato path to fame too much in 2016 so this song activates my fight or flight reflex

**Tomoki** (9.5): The best thing about this song is that one vine it gave us

**Solovrinne** (9.1): Chaotic bisexual vibes. Definitely Demi's best work.

*dropthehammer11** (9): ok dis hard

**frogaranaman** (9): https://www.youtu.be/fJ_kLnPXJCM

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): ...bi curious anthem

**stansymash** (8.6): you cant have a mind on someones body and a body on your mind without that literally meaning the same thing. anyway this song is great

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Ah, queer pop stars soft outing themselves via their music...looks like Demi did Dress early, huh? I kind of have a little grudge against Cool For The Summer, because it was all I heard when I played Episode, but there's no better way to drop hints that you're bisexual than releasing an absolute banger like this one. The deserved summer hit that never was is perfectly suited for Demi's powerful voice, teasing the lesbian subtext loudly and unabashedly instead of making it come out in whispers and winks. It's no wonder why this won the original winner's rate in r/EmotionDeluxe, if anybody even remembers that.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.5): bisexual bop https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndl__n35IjY

**ZankeeZero** (8.5): Not as into it as I used to be, but it's still a great bop that marks one of my favorite "good girl gone bad" type of comeback single. I hope it flourishes!

**tapdancingpig** (8.1): I think I stan Max more than almost any Pop Girl. He and his crew helped Demi write one of the best songs she‚Äôs ever done.

**CarlieScion** (8): "It‚Äôs ‚Äúbisexuality as a taboo,‚Äù Halsey told Paper, before citing some of the lyrical tropes she dislikes: ‚Äú‚ÄòDon‚Äôt tell your mom‚Äô or ‚ÄòWe shouldn‚Äôt do this‚Äô or ‚ÄòThis feels so wrong but it‚Äôs so right.‚Äù‚Äù

Explaining why she dislikes these lyrical tropes, Halsey added: ‚ÄúThat narrative is so fucking damaging to bisexuality and its place in society."

**lilacsweetener** (8): dem guitars doe

**static\_int\_husp** (8): It's alright, but this is another example of a song that's definitely **not** the best song from it's rate... and not even on it's own album

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Me @ Phineas and Ferb

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.7): everyone‚Äôs gonna link that one vine so i‚Äôm just gonna hope someone did it for me, but that one vine

**jamesfog** (7.5): A great pop song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ_kLnPXJCM

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): not even one of demi's best bops. still jams tho.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Not a bad song but certainly not the one I would pick. I vastly prefer ‚ÄòConfident‚Äô.

**FireLordAegon** (7): Demi is pretty hit or miss for me and this is more of a hit.

**Leixander** (7): confident, the title song, outbopped

**Piccprincess** (7): little bit of gay shaming but werk I guess

**Shadow1087** (6.5): this song did not age too well

**notdallin** (6.3): the best demi song but the bar is pretty low imo. i mean come on, the whispered ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell your mother‚Äù??? that‚Äôs a mood I guess. (My wife says that I need to put in here that Sorry Not Sorry is better.)

**J\_Toe** (6): oh i didn't realise this was the song with the "take me to paradise" hook. For some reason I assumed that was a Katy song.

**ReallyCreative** (6): I want to like this song so badly, it's a MUCH better version of I Kissed A Girl, but I just don't like the chorus that much, even though the pre-chrous SLAPS. There are great elements to this song but it just comes up short for me.

You‚Äôre sitting on a beach chair as the fresh sea breeze brushes against your moist skin.

The pre-chorus gets more intense with every line, backed up by a burgeoning rock guitar. Sweat is running through your cheeks and every bone in your body is rattling. ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell your mother‚Ä¶ KISS ONE ANOTHER‚Ä¶ DIE FOR EACH OTHER‚Ä¶‚Äù Lovato roars ‚ÄúWE‚ÄôRE COOL FOR THE SUMMER HA!!

>The winner of the 2017 EP rate, Cyber Stockholm Syndrome is one of the most prominent songs of the past decade. Combining 2000's R&B and pop with a modernized production and amazing writing skills, Rina Sawayama created an outstanding ode to the modern relationship between human and technology. With her sharp imagery, she perfectly describes the millenial experience of feeling alone in the outside world, but finding comfort and happiness in the digital one. The song starts on a down-tempo beat and builds up into a bombastic chorus, and later, bridge, as the lyrics dive into the imaginery phone. The blend of late NSYNC-esque instrumentals and Rina's smooth, sweet highnotes create a pink digital cloud in the listeners mind, filled with all the wonders of the internet. Although the rate is full of great classics from all the ages, but none of them can take you in and capture you, and make you addicted like Cyber Stockholm Syndrome. - /u/amumumyspiritanimal

---

**Therokinrolla** (8): Cyber Stockholm Syndrome is an ode to Grindr gays, and you cannot convince me otherwise. Here, Rina describes herself being uncomfortable at physical social events but THRIVING in the online space of love that is Grindr. Yes, Rina is a woman, but she knows her audience. Rina is much more comfortable giving herself over the phone rather than irl because it's less intense and anxiety-inducing. It's just easier, and Rina finds its easier for people who are sometimes judged in society (the gays) to comfortable exchange dick pics online and eventually play hide the sausage. Remember to always do you're regular STD tests kids!

# Robot Sex Is Good

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (11): This is really good and I love how this sounds. The production is great and gives a vibe. That last part of song dewigs me

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): this winning the rate made me check out, and eventually be obsessed with this song so THANK YOU POPHEADS

**bespectacIed** (10): rina is the future

**camerinian** (10): god DAMN i have been sleeping on this and I hate that i did that but I‚Äôm glad I finally got an opportunity to actually take this in. Everything about this is brilliant, and I need to listen to that EP yesterday holy shit the breakdown at the end wow good lord

**didney-worl** (10): I've listened to this song so many times and it hasn't gotten old. Pop perfection.

**dramiaa** (10): The bridge of this song is so good its unfair, its euphoric. Rina made the best bridge in this rate, and I love bridges. The production is top-notch, and I love the small lyric change in the 2nd chorus. Plus I love how in the end it sounds like a lot of things going are on at the same time, trasnporting u to another plane of existence

**J\_Toe** (10): reddit anthem

**MashLuke** (10): a new underground queen that will never receive mainstream attention

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): i love Rina "fist me" Sawayama

**original\_doll** (10): a relatable bop

**PuggleMaster** (10): LEGEND!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): iconic future tech bop from our pixellated queen

**tapdancingpig** (10): This one will be robbed, I can almost guarantee it. The first time I heard it, the song bored me until the bridge and modulation hit, which are still my favorite parts of the song. Over MANY repeat listening, I grew to love it, with its off kilter premise and weirdly catchy hooks.

**Tedyonce** (10): The explosive breakdown at the end makes for timeless pop production

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I had no idea Rina invented Artificial Intelligence, but I‚Äôm grateful for her innovations

**twat\_brained** (10): This sound takes me back to a time I yearn to relive, complete with lyrics allowing me to reflect on the musings of my modern-day life, and how much of it is spent gazing at digital, electronic screens. Rina is **it** and her career is only gonna skyrocket in 2019.

**yatcho** (10): The bridge of this song alone merits a 10

**ZankeeZero** (10): an absolutely flawless song that stuns me every time i listen to it, I really hope this wins but I feel like it might get a lil sabotaged, i'm glad it made it in here either way.

**1998tweety** (9.7): This is great, I hope she becomes the next big main pop girl.

**ExtraEater** (9.5): ok this is epic

**mysario** (9.5): I can never get over her sound giving a futuristic 90's nostalgic feeling

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): it's kinda surreal how rina went from not being on anyone's radar to winning a popheads rate in like 6 months

**FireLordAegon** (9.4): Amazing song! Love Rina, main pop girl 2019

**stansymash** (9.2): buy rina on itunes and also buy think peace on itunes etc

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): It‚Äôs a great track; very ephemeral though...it feels like it ends too soon

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I really like the 2000‚Äôs vibe this song (especially in the chorus) has and how it‚Äôs mixed with the current music trends. And that bridge is so good!

**ReallyCreative** (9): A generic first half to whatever the fuck you call that second half jesus christ it's amazing, Queen of traveling with friends in a convertible through the information superhighway, Rebecca Black is stuck at home eating cereal in a bowl

**Solovrinne** (9): It bangs, production is slick, chorus rocks and THE BRIDGE. A yes from me dawg.

**VodkaInsipido** (9): this kinda bopped

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.5): oh, THIS is why yall go on about rina. although i have to say it sounds like one of the songs off the kim possible soundtrack. i‚Äôll get back to you on which one eventually.

**HoodooMooJuice** (8.5): Queen of biting straws?

**notdallin** (8.5): Best discovery of the rate. A fun pop song about cyber romance vs. IRL romance. I GUESS THIS SONG IS WHAT‚ÄôS WRONG WITH KIDS TODAY.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Man, it sure is nice to have a bisexual Asian pop musician, since I identify with both of those things. I'll be honest in saying that this isn't my favourite Rina Sawayama song, mainly because I love the ironic sophistication in Ordinary Superstar and the Kim Possible-esque persona the girl puts on in Take Me As I Am, but Rina uses her retro pop production to shed light on a state of mind that's very contemporary. You'd think one of the first pop songs to talk explicitly about the issues with social media would be cringey, ala 'How many likes is my life worth?', but Rina details an experience I actually used to relate to very well here, placing the song in the here and now instead of rattling on about abstract concepts without context like so many other criticisms of technology do. I do wish the song was about a minute longer, because the lack of a bursting chorus at the end of the chaotic outro makes me a little disappointed, but Rina still pulls this off well enough to make it a future period piece instead of a dooming it to be a dated tirade.

# RINA round the rosie pockets full of posies ashes ashes this songs rank falls down 

**frogaranaman** (7): I can never remember, is this the song about robot sex?

**shipsinker44** (7): okay i have a lot of problems with this album thats hard to explain but this song is NOT THAT GOOD

**CarlieScion** (6): i still dont know how to feel about this song

**nooodisaster** (6): I used to be a huge fan of upbeat sounding songs with depressing lyrics, but now I guess I'm old and just like things simple. The production of the last minute or so is really epic, but it still doesn't draw me in emotionally to this song.

**MrSwearword** (5): sometimes I wonder how certain songs win their rates, and I wonder how this one got so much love. It's just 2004 R&B tinged pop with "future" shit around it. I hope Rina has better songs than this.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): This is so bland why do you guys stan

**radiofan15** (2.5): I knew I would hate the song as soon as I saw the album cover (it screamed 'i'm so artsy and indie with my weird hairdo and photo filters') and heard the laughs in the 'vintage' intro... and BOY I WAS RIGHT... this is not as lame and disturbingly boring as an Allie X/Bleachers song (at least there's a musical build up and a drop to keep things dynamic) but OH YEEZ PLEASE SHUT UP GIRL you're distracting me of how actually good is the production in your song!

>Runaway is considered by many to be Kanye West's magnum opus, a beautiful, emotional song about being emotionless. From the slowly building piano notes that start the song, to Pusha T's guest appearance, to Kanye's distorted lyrics and vocoder-affected solo, every element comes together to perfectly accentuate the message: Kanye admitting all of his flaws to the world. - /u/pickupthephonebaby
>
>Runaway is one of my favorite songs of all time, so I was of course incredibly happy to see talent win during our rate. Obviously my status as a Kanye stan has been in flux as of recently, but it's impossible to deny that the man has made some fantastic music in his lifetime. Whether he completely ruins his legacy or not remains to be seen, but I'm just happy that we can appreciate true art when we see it. Runaway is arguably Kanye's magnum opus, and the users of /r/popheads definitely gave it the recognition that it truly deserves. - /u/awesometuck1559

---

**Therokinrolla** (8): Well doesn't this song become more and more relavent to the social discussion over time? Kanye reached his peak when he reached self-awareness of his public perception in 2010 with the drop of Runaway, a stunning ode to asshats and the fact they have feelings too. The artistry of this track has insofar been insurmountable in his career: his messy album releases stumbled out whilst Runaway casually remained at the top of "All time" lists, and forever pertinent in the career and life of Kanye West.

I think a lot of that read as a drag, which even though *he* wholeheartedly deserves, his artistry does not. Nobody has so gracefully rapped about dick pics and douchebags. A simple but powerful piano melody the echoes in the background throughout the song, meanwhile Kanye has never sounded more genuine and introspective. I like the idea that the extended outro is us hearing Kanye get further and further away, succeeding in "running away" into his own state of bliss, which I really hope our poor troubled Kanye can reach one day, if for no reason other than this song.

---
# Up Like Donald Trump

**radiofan15** (11): Runaway is Kanye's best song and his biggest (not on sales unofrtunately) in almost every possible way: from the minimalistic paino riff drowned yet complementing the intrinsicate production, the deeply open lyrics and the double entendres (is it about a doomed relationship or about he and the media), Pusha's legendary verse, THOSE samples and the legendary 4-minutes autotuned outro... all of that add up to create a monster of a track, something that everyone and anyone can actually relate, and even non-Kanye fans can enjoy... also his SNL performance of the track is one of the best things i've see in my life, like I got literal chills (and still got them) when he and the ballerina dancer are alone on stage while he's playing his MPC; that fucking moment HOLY SHIT.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): top 10 songs all time

**amacaroon** (10): One of my favorite songs

**bespectacIed** (10): Why did 2018 kanye had to happen goddamnit

**camerinian** (10): Fuck the number one of the rate the real competition here is this vs Welcome To The Black Parade for most iconic opening piano note

**chihuahuazero** (10): The vocoder outro is a top 5 Kanye moment and a demonstration of how far hip-hop has gone as an art form.

**CopyCatJ** (10): I am a Kanye stan and I think the vocoder at the end is one of the most overrated moments in music history. Song still a 10 thank to Pusha.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Holy crap I hadn‚Äôt heard this song before this rate and I‚Äôm in awe. Sad and powerful all at once.

**dropthehammer11** (10): listen yall can say what you want about kanye but dont forget that this man is a musical genius kthx [2]

**frogaranaman** (10): Me, for the first 20 seconds: A literal child could play this! | Me, for the next 42 seconds: Oh shit, wai- | Me, right when Kanye starts rapping: Oh, right.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): i don‚Äôt even have anything flippant to say

**ImADudeDuh** (10): tbh if people give this a low score just cause kanye is a mess now, y'all are kinda trash.

**JohnnyBAverage** (10): This is my favorite song of all time. After what Kanye has done recently in the press, I have completely distanced myself from this artist I once called my first and foremost creative inspiration. Despite me knowing damn well what my 11 would be going into this rate no matter what, I somehow feel I‚Äôm putting this song too low. Fuck what kanye said about Trump and the 13th amendment though don‚Äôt put your faith in media figures is the lesson I guess. Still 10 tho I wrote an essay when I was drunk about this song, but I'll spare y'all Basically dark Kanye is well... dark

**lunasaflowers** (10): Again: godDAMN.

**MashLuke** (10): the uncensored version of this must suck

**MrSwearword** (10): Another exceptional Kanye track [yes, he's a complete fucking idiot as of late]

**mysario** (10): even if the end is basically just mush, it's still one of Ye's best

**nooodisaster** (10): Probably Kanye's GOAT. The production is as usual immaculate, but the emotional power is what sets this apart. Everyone with any self-awareness has felt like an asshole or a liability at one point in their life. This song perfectly captures the struggle of truly not wanting to hurt people anymore, feeling lonely and sorry for yourself because of the people you're losing, but then hating yourself for thinking you even deserve to feel sorry for yourself. ANYWAY, I'm in a happy place in my life right now so don't worry lmao :)

**Piccprincess** (10): one of kanyes best ever songs tbh

**sbb618** (10): I had this as my 11 for a while

**skargardin** (10): Yall hear sumn?


# More like my RUMP

**Bendariaku89** (4): the instrumental‚Äôs nice.

**InfernalSolstice** (4): this would be at least a 8 if it were maybe 5 minutes

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (0): I'm pretty sure this was my 11 in the original rate but it is ruined for me. this is the song I would always listen to when I was feeling sad and worthless. it was nice to hear that someone I respected, someone so incredibly talented, had the same fears and guilt and self-loathing. now, all I can think about is how he succumbed to his own demons and has either (a) stomped all over his own legacy or (b) is in the middle of a full-fledged mental breakdown and has no one to support him or help him. either way it's depressing as shit. I don't wanna listen to this any more

**ComeOnAndSlang** (0): eek

**kanyewestrep3** (0): this song is honestly terrible, probably the worst on MBDTF after Lost In The World. Pusha T has a nice verse, but not something i'd wait 3 and a half minutes to hear.

**raicicle** (0): okay but here is my HOT TEA, this is the worst song on my big fat greek wedding. the production is an out-of-tune piano, garageband strings and showcases the bad mixing of that album the most of any of the songs on it,,,,and kanye can‚Äôt sing and also straight people are too easily impressed by someone extending a song that‚Äôs literally four chords by 4 minutes with the exact same loop and someone warbling with a vocoder like its somehow virtuosic, its like watching a performance art performance in the MoMA but really all you want is a mcdonalds

[/r/popheads/comments/a014kf/the_popheads_winners_rate_day_2_a_good_ye_to_die/eadwkae/]

=====

Therokinrolla: **stansymash** (10): theres a lot of great aspects to this song but i think the best bit is when pusha t says "24/7 365 pussy stays on my mind"

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Absolutely my favorite Kanye song. Unfortunately, I feel I may need to take his advice...

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): ‚ÄúYou been putting up with my shit for way too long‚Äù yes i have kanye, yes i have

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This is my favorite song of all time, and I could go on for hours about what a fascinating piece of music it is. Everything about it is 100% perfect from the single piano note to the end of the extended vocoder outro that thematically fits the song so well. However, Kanye has zero chance of winning this rate so giving this an 11 for a second time would be kind of a waste, and it also just kind of makes me sad and miss the time when Kanye's treatment by the public felt legitimately unfair.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): a classic despite anything kanye says or does [2]

**VodkaInsipido** (10): we get it you are sad !

**FireLordAegon** (9.5): The GOAT of "I'm a pos" anthems.

**notdallin** (9.5): the magnificent centerpiece of what I and many consider Kanye‚Äôs best album‚Äîthe magnum opus MBDTF. For me, it‚Äôs not what Kanye says in this song but what‚Äôs not said. For nearly half of the song, he croons like a dying cyborg with more emotion than most rappers can muster in an entire career of music‚Äînot a single intelligible word for miles but computer-generated arpeggios crash and careen in a waves of harmonic catharsis.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): It's hard to determined a song included in this rate that's the most critically acclaimed of all, but together with generation-defining hits like Billie Jean, Runaway is a serious contender for the title. One of the longest songs most people have ever put on repeat or even heard, Runaway takes the already influential use of Autotune on Kanye's previous album and combines it with a simple yet highly effective combination of piano chords to make an emotional mess of a song that still manages to hold itself together, resulting in an absolutely gorgeous magnum opus. It's both exceedingly difficult and exceedingly easy to see Kanye as a sympathetic figure, as Runaway reminds us, and the peek into his mind the song ends up giving will definitely make you grudgingly acknowledge that its artistic merit can't be ignored.

**1998tweety** (9.4): The only 9 minute song by a Trump supporter I'm listening to is Venice Bitch. With that being said this song is really good and just like Venice Bitch they don't even feel 9 minutes long. The only part that lags a bit is the very end.

**enecks** (9): This is one of the few Kanye songs I can still listen to this year because it's about how Kanye is a piece of shit.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): The piano here is so unforgettable and it so good. I love the chorus as well; this is one of Kanye‚Äôs most iconic songs for sure (and his best album imo).

**SpanKKy1** (9): lorde did it better but I‚Äôm still here for it

**amumumyspiritanimal** (8.8): now this is a good song with good production, and kind of the only Kanye song besides Stronger that I kinda listened to.

**followingfreeways** (8.5): every time I hear this song I try to sing the lower key on time but I always mess it up:/ rude

**jamesfog** (8.5): Long masterpiece.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I REALLY like this song, the lyrics are honest and raw but really shine a light into this era of Kanye's psyche and his self-awareness.

**aulyve** (8): Pusha's verse, as good as it is, kind of undermines the isolating vibe of the song, and I think Bon Iver's outro goes on a little too long. Great stuff regardless.

**hikkaru** (8): Something something runaway with me

**mirandacrocsgrove** (8): but did this really need to be 8 minutes long????

**rotating3Dtext** (8): it‚Äôs so long...

**Solovrinne** (8): Points for being a long song but not sounding excessive but I don't know what people are smoking when they listen to this and think it sounds like perfection.

**Roxieloxie** (7.9): i hate you all for making me listen to kanye

**rickikardashian** (7.7): +.5 for that intro YES

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7.5): why so long Jesus christ

**gannade** (7): Kinda more relevant than ever, huh?

**HoodooMooJuice** (7): How long is thsi damn song

**tapdancingpig** (7): I feel like this may be the definitive Kanye song (I‚Äôm not a fan AT ALL, as you can tell, so I could be wrong). His production work is positively genius, but he‚Äôs acting like a complete prick (a self aware prick, but still). I can‚Äôt get over that. His attempts to be sympathetic do nothing for me. I‚Äôm sorry?

**yatcho** (6.2): I just do NOT enjoy this song at all. Call me young, call me illiterate, i just dont get it

**literally100bees** (6): Honestly pretty solid but was 9 minutes totally necessary?

**shipsinker44** (6): i didntthink this was very good and im surprised it won over some other obviously better songs on this very album

**original\_doll** (5.5): the first minute and outro of this song are kinda unnecessary

**LandonKidatrea** (5): If this song had ended at the 5:47 mark I would've given it a 9. Maybe I'm just uncultured.

**twat\_brained** (5): Did you not know this song is in the key of E? Let me play it repeatedly and in punctuation so you get the message! When you open the song talking about sending nudes, it's not a good look. And Pusha's verse does nothing for me, I don't even remember what it was about. Also, the outro is RIDICULOUSLY long. There's a reason why "The Louvre" is as long as it is, and it doesn't overstay its welcome. This does. Not to mention it's a much more fun song to listen to.

>Los Ageless should win because meta Annie is best Annie. And also Annie should just win. - /u/Piccprincess
>
>Los Ageless did something unique for St. Vincent‚Äôs career. Five, or six including the David Byrne collab album, albums into her career, Annie Clark released a track arguably at the top of her game. Partnered with Jack Antonoff, Annie created a track layered with metaphors, synths, and lead head-on with one of the catchiest hooks of 2017. The exact reason why this song is as good as it is is honestly hard to pin point. You can say that the mesmerizing chorus, 
>
>*how could anybody have you, how could anybody have you and lose you, how could anybody have you and lose you and not lose their mind too*
>
>Draws upon a simple melody, with meaningful and relatable lyrics, yet features the small details in the composition that makes it so reminiscent of St. Vincent‚Äôs usual sound, and that‚Äôs what makes this song as good as it is.
>
>Maybe it‚Äôs the outro, almost a full minute of Jack Antonoff grade A production, and a point of emphasis for Annie‚Äôs guitar.
>
>On the flip side, maybe it‚Äôs the intro and guitar lines throughout? It features a sample from earlier in the album, Masseduction, synths, a driving guitar in the second verse, and added vocal lines that creates not just a song with depth, but almost a full symphony of production, vocals, guitar, and lyricism that truly makes it one of the greatest songs of the 21st century. - /u/_wailordfan

**Therokinrolla** (10): This song is frankly genius. It is so intelligently crafted, and gives off peak kinky wine-mom vibes. Smart, sharp lyrics, bounce in between a fine-tuned chorus that manages to repeat the same line, but change it slightly to add wildly different meaning each time, each time more and more pleading.

I find this song so genius I wrote a paper about it for AP Lit, in which I claimed the song is a critique of the ageism of Hollywood. It's a clear metaphor, with the verses where Annie sings about mothers milking their young, or the old stars burning their memoirs they never got to write, along with Annie also desperately repeating the fact that she will keep running from aging.

It wasn't bad, got a 93, but he was a notoriously easy grader (he claimed it was because he was sick of getting complaints from parents about their children doing poorly) so it was probably closer to an 88/89 of a paper. But it was still one I was pretty happy with, about a song I still find infinitely interesting and superbly crafted.

# How could anybody have you?

**Dracyoshi** (11): Los Ageless is by far my most played song of all-time and absolutely deserving of that honor. Everything about this song is perfect; from Annie's emotional vocals to the chorus that hits harder than a truck while serving a fantastic hook.

**1313Harbor** (10): I play this for my friends who don‚Äôt even know who St. Vincent is, and they‚Äôre becoming conditioned to bop to it. This is probably my favorite song I‚Äôve ever discovered thanks to popheads.

**1998tweety** (10): Re-post from the original rate: After a bit of a lukewarm start, its nice to get to a song that captures me off the first note. The beat is loud and driving but doesn't drown out Annie's vocals. I've noticed a thing with Annie that here chorus' are almost always the weakest parts of her songs. In the verses shes allowed to spend her time creating this beautiful metaphors, but she has to resort to repetition in her chorus. This song does it a bit better than her others though. The lyrics change slightly and the meaning is easy for the listener to pick up on. The highlight is easily the bridge, the guitars are perfect here and Annie's scream singing layers on top really well. The final chorus builds up well, something you'd expect from a song your wanted to market as a single. I don't know exactly how to feel about the spoken word outro. The single version of this track stands well on its own, but I don't feel as though this outro takes much away from the track. Imo its a bit too long, but it being there flows well into the next song. My favourite line from this track is, ‚ÄúIn Los Ageless, the mothers milk their young‚Äù, and the reason for that is because it has multiple meanings packed into it. The first is the obvious one, mothers are milking their kids for all the money they can get out of them; it's a twist because mothers are supposed to milk themselves and provide milk for their children. Stop me if I'm reading into this a bit too much, but it also sounds like it can be taken in a sexual way. I'm sure we all know of the abuse some children and teenagers suffer in Hollywood, so this line could be referring to that.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): How is this better than all of Melodrama again?? answer: it's not. It's still a 10 though, and thanks Bojack for making an homage to the song.

**frogaranaman** (10): Huunggdfdssjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjngngngngngngngngngngngngngngngngnslslsososldkfmcmcmcmcjahandmdnfbvjvkxlxwoiwiwiwiwiwodoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoekdjdjdjdjdjdjdjejdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalaoqoqpqoeedididididid I‚Äôm gay

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Melodrama stans can stay mad we aren't rating Perfect Places

**JohnnyBAverage** (10): Personal bias, I‚Äôm really into this album right now, don‚Äôt blame me I‚Äôm just following the hood of my car (get it because that‚Äôs what she says in the song) Also I go wild when this song comes on in spin class so props to that

**lunasaflowers** (10): If I had to name a St. Vincent song to introduce people to St. Vincent with, this would be it.

**MashLuke** (10): St Vincent is totally a dominatrix, 100%

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): how hilarious would it be if one of these songs that ‚ÄúSlumber Partied‚Äù actually won the rate again lmao

**MrSwearword** (10): song > video, let's be real but the song fucking kicks so much ass. Annie's guitar skills are unmatched of any modern "rock"/"alternative"/whatever the fuck her music falls under.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Boy, do I feel vindicated for correctly predicting that this would win over all of Melodrama! Though the latter is a top-tier record in its own right, Los Ageless was always fated the immediate standout in a rate filled with consistent, high quality albums, attracting the most 11s out of St. Vincent's growing Popheads fanbase. Personally, the reason why I enjoy Los Ageless so much is because, true to its name, it sounds like the perfect track for hardboiled crime solving in a noir backdrop of a futuristic, dystopian clone of Los Angeles. Annie absolutely lets loose on the bridge, displaying her vocal talent on full blast and perfectly portraying her mental anguish over a breakup in a way few artists manage to do. I do have a problem with the outro, which is heartbreaking in the context of Masseduction but a bit tedious to listen to on its own, but other than that, Los Ageless is unquestionably one of the best pop songs of 2017. Cara must be one hell of an ex-lover, huh?

# Why would anybody want you?

**CopyCatJ** (7): prefer her older stuff :(

**J\_Toe** (7): what is the appeal of this song? What is its meaning? It seems like a cliched and misguided hate-fest on LA, for what? Eating Sushi? Practicing Yoga? Opting for plastic surgery? this seems like the most naive and misguided form of criticism to ever be put to pop.

**jamesfog** (7): I recently realized how good this album is.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Meh

**aulyve** (5.5): This was the song where I really started to worry about MASSEDUCTION after New York underwhelmed me. The verses and middle 8 are cool but that hook is unbelievably weak.

**notdallin** (5): The song is whatever, but what warrants this rating is how disappointing it is compared to literally everything else St. Vincent has put out. I know that it ended up getting a lot of acclaim from critics and fans but MASSEDDUCTION won‚Äôt ever win me over. It‚Äôs not good and every time I listen to its songs I want to throw on Actor or Strange Mercy.

Therokinrolla: **mudkip1** (10): fuck yeAH ANNIE FUCK ME UP

**mysario** (10): you're in Hollywoo, see what I did there, I made a BoJack Horseman reference

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Aghhh what a masterpiece

**pickupthephonebaby** (10): good

**strawberryswing1** (10): Even as a huge Melodrama stan, I wasn't mad at all about this song winning. The outro is godly.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): How could anybody love /r/popheads

**TragicKingdom1** (10): jack antonoff is a god except on reputation

**twat\_brained** (10): I copied down what I want to say in my notebook, let me find it. @ fellow Lorde stans: **WHY COULDN'T WE DECIDE ON AN 11 BEFOREHAND?!?!?!** Saltiness aside, Jack and Annie truly come into their own on this track, making for one of the more unusual and underrated songs of 2017. In fact, I think I love it so much because it's what would happen in Daria Morgendorffer had a music career. Then again, one could argue a similar case for "Pure Heroine" by Lorde. Shoutout to whoever included this in BoJack Horseman Season 5. 

 P.S. I heard this at a restaurant since my laptop and phone are dead and now Digital Witness is playing not 20 minutes later. Who here stans Annie????

**VodkaInsipido** (10): perfect places deserved better

**stansymash** (9.8): i almost bought a t shirt with the bum on it but i realised that no

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.6): I didn‚Äôt listen to Masseduction because of some personal trauma related to St Vincent but then they used Los Ageless during the opener of this series of Bojack Horseman and I heard that chorus and I was fuckeddddd, let me tell you

**camerinian** (9.5): bumping this up by half a point because of how perfectly it was used in Bojack Horseman. It‚Äôs one of Annie Clark‚Äôs best pop songs in its own right, but honestly shoutouts to Bojack‚Äôs music supervisor, that guy gets it

**Solovrinne** (9.5): It's funky, it bops, the chorus is SUCH an earworm.

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): Wow. I‚Äôve been putting off listening to St. Vincent‚Äôs music for a while. I predict that that will end soon. This is exceptional.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): mom

**enecks** (9): Would be a 10 if not for the solid minute of ambient filler at the end

**hikkaru** (9): Jack Antonoff shorten the outros of your songs challenge... anyways I would have preferred something from Melodrama to win that rate (Perfect Places and Green Light are for sure 10s) but this is a great song too, just wish I didn't have to listen to her sweet whispers for over a minute after the song ends

**ImJustJoshingYa** (9): So it turns out this song is actually not called Los Angeles

**Leixander** (9): wouldn't be in my top three of Masseduction now but it is such a great album so
**RandomHypnotica** (9): god i just live for that long outro

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): I stan whoever picks the music for Bojack and this song's HOOK

**warmishblood** (8.5): This is one of my favourite singles (and albums) of 2017

**FireLordAegon** (8.2): This was not what I expected. I loved it!

**nooodisaster** (8): Remember when this slumber party'd and beat the 4 other Lorde songs in the top 5? Yeah I'm not bitter :)

**Roxieloxie** (8): perfect places was robbed

**shipsinker44** (8): honestly i love lorde but fuck her stans tbh this deserved winning

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7.5): a great song, but not the best from masseduction

**radiofan15** (7.5): So I only heard Los Ageless when it came out and never came out... now I know why... it's cute but nothing as mind-blowing as I always read on here

>Complicated is a song that is a total bop but Behind These Slayzel Eyes should've won this rate. Complicated is the angsty teenage anthem that Lorde wishes she could make. - /u/gannade

---

**letsallpoo** (9): Sometimes when I listen to "Head Above Water," I imagine it's about that (controversial) rate. "/u/jailhousepoop KEEP MY SONG / ABOVE KELLLLYYYY!" and on like that. Although I would like to point out, as rate host /u/gannade has said multiple times, that "Complicated" would still have won without his scores. And it deserved to! It's the kind of affectless teenage anthem about not fitting in and not caring anymore, the one that she tried to recreate for the next ten years of her career. At its core is a high school love song, but it feels like so much more than that.

# Jailhouse sympathizers

**WilsonJason** (11): not even a top 20 avril song

**animefangrant62** (10): our skater princess died for our sins

**cyborglilith** (10): nostalgia

**didney-worl** (10): *Cries in 2002*

**Dracyoshi** (10): I feel overwhelmed by nostalgia when listening to this song and I didn't even listen to pop until over a decade after this got big. I love the vocal inflections and the hooks are 10/10.

**dropthehammer11** (10): a classic

**gannade** (10): Behind these slayzel eyes shouldve won but  I cant deny this talent

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Why did jailhouse_poop have to make this song's win so complicated?

**itsabop** (10): #PopPunkPrincess

**MashLuke** (10): tfw she's more masc than popheads

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): i love sabotage

**MrSwearword** (10): because it's a great song. Although considering SABOTAGE Gigante was committed to make it win, that doesn't sour the song itself for me.

**mysario** (10): I thought it was "take off all your crappy clothes" for far too long

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): So I have a complicated (sorry had to) relationship with Avril, as in I think most of her music is terrible, but this song is just early 2000s pop punk at it's best.

**shipsinker44** (10): fuck ME im giving so many damn tens in this rate but popheads surprisingly has a little bit of taste!! this remains top 3 in avrils discog, next to hello kitty and never growing up (/s)

**SpanKKy1** (10): amazing song but can‚Äôt compete with girlfriend

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): since u been gone i can breathe for the first time /u/jailhousepoop

**welcometoNY** (10): iconic. one of the best pop songs of the 2000s

**1998tweety** (9.6): I have so many memories to Avril's early hits, a Canadian queen.

**aulyve** (9.5): A classic. The woodwind in the bridge is such a stroke of genius.

**original\_doll** (9.5): dude you wanna crash the mall

**bespectacIed** (9): Avril's songwriting is so laughably immature and this is the only (kinda) exception.

**CarlieScion** (9): y e s

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): I heard someone call this song ‚Äúsour apple bubblegum pop‚Äù and I can think of no better way to describe it. Truly one of Avril‚Äôs best.

**hikkaru** (9): Everytime I hear this song my inner emo 13 year old girl jumps out. Avril's first two albums really do manage to capture the magic of a lifestyle that you can feel, even if you have never experienced being an emo 13 year old girl.

**rickikardashian** (9): Look, I appreciate Avril‚Äôs music like we all do BUT SINCE YOU BEEN GONE SHOULD BE THE ONE WE SHOULD BE RATING RIGHT NOW. FUCK THAT ONE BITCH SABOTAGING THE RATE. KELLY DESERVED BETTER.

**yatcho** (9): This song is so heatfelt it stand out even among this powerhouse list

**notdallin** (8.9): UH-HUH. UH-HUH. LIFE‚ÄôS LIKE THIS.

**Roxieloxie** (8.7): they always ask yee haw but never ask haw yee

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): This is a good ass song, Melissa could never

**dramiaa** (8.5): Ah, the good ol days. Im With You is a better song though

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I'm a few months older than this song, and I like it well enough, but I'm not going to lie and say I don't feel a little disconnected from it. Honestly, the first time I saw what Avril Lavigne looked like, in magazines that I read when I was seven or eight, my only thought was 'Why is she wearing that eyeliner?' Then Hello Kitty got released a few years later and my opinion of her went downhill from there. Now, of course, she's supposedly been replaced by a clone, but I'm old enough to understand that she had an impact on pop music way back when I was a little kid, though most of the time her music just doesn't do it for me. I don't get what preppy clothes are, and I don't know whether she's actually going for a punk aesthetic or not. Yet despite the artist being a thing of the past, I can still recognize that Complicated is, for many people, a nostalgic song, and a very good one at that. I'm not sure how old Avril was when she made this, but it evokes being a teenager for me in a very specific and fond sort of way, even if I'm listening to it in 2018, when being a teenager is quite different than it used to be back in 2002. In short: Complicated is simply great.

**radiofan15** (8.2): A cute song but so heavily dated and diluted by its memetic status... I can't be the only one who prefers I'm With You to Complicated.

**frogaranaman** (8): I can‚Äôt stop thinking of that ‚Äúlooking for an emo gf‚Äù video whenever I listen to this song.

**HoodooMooJuice** (8): I remember listening to this song a lot when I was younger and really liking it, but now I can't help but find the guitars and vocals really dry. The chorus is alright though.

# Lasagna haters

**ExtraEater** (7): the fact that i'm listening to this right now leaves me with no doubt that this indeed did win a rate before

**J\_Toe** (7): lol this song just reminds me of the Weird Al version

**jamesfog** (7): Behind These Hazel Eyes, Since U Been Gone, I'm With You... all deserved. But still a classic.

**JohnnyBAverage** (7): As a kid I thought she sang ‚Äúhonestly and promise me I‚Äôm never gonna find ya naked oh nooo no noo‚Äù I thought it was quITE the scandal

**kappyko** (7): im so done with pretending to be too cool to like this

**nooodisaster** (7): I really want to give this a 0 bc of that person who sabotaged the rate, but I'm gonna be the BIGGER PERSON and give it what it deserves. A 7 lmao.

**perfumevee** (7): The first time I heard this I was buying a Roxy hoodie at the mall and it spoke to my teenage heart.

**teenage\_meme** (7): gosh when i was 9 i wore a tie on top of every dang shirt

**amumumyspiritanimal** (6.8): I know every American who was a teen in 2008 really loves this song but honestly its boring if you dont have emotional ties to it

**banananaise** (6.5): when you strike your paeuwze??? why does she say it like that???

**camerinian** (6.5): I loved this song as a kid, but if I‚Äôm being honest I kind of find the chorus a bit annoying now. The whooping melody honestly is not‚Ä¶ good. Plus I never liked ‚Äúpeauxse‚Äù ‚Äúcleauthes‚Äù, like we get it you‚Äôre Canadian, but you don‚Äôt HAVE to put that in

**tapdancingpig** (6.5): I like Avril a lot, but did y‚Äôall seriously let this win over I‚Äôm With You?

**enecks** (5): I don't forget the sabotage that happened in this rate. I don't forgive it either. Avril is not a good vocalist, and this isn't even one of her better songs.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (5): not my cup of tea but it's so 2000s and it's so iconic so it's not that bad

**selegend** (4): We all know why this is here

**BreezySeason** (3): My sister loved this song so much that I hate it

**NuneEtsuko** (2): I just never got into this song, hate it and find it the definition of basic and boring.

**twat\_brained** (7.2): Avril was THAT bitch in the early-mid 2000s and yet I feel this fluctuates in and out of the top 10 of her discography; songs like "My Happy Ending", "Sk8er Boi" and even "Hot" pack more of a punch than this. I'd say even "What the Hell" can compete with this, and that's from peak "Melissa". I still have mad love and respect for Avril, but it's naive to think "Complicated" will even make the top half of the results.

**Therokinrolla** (10): Way before Gaga was "That rah rah bitch," Miss Kylie known widely as "the La La Bitch." Already a very popular artist in Australia and most of Europe, Kylie skyrotted into being one of the most celebrated pop artists of 2001 with her album *Fever* and this iconic as hell single.

I made the part about the La La Bitch up,  but I'm sure at least some of you believed me. That hook is so infectious and iconic that it makes total sense. Sometimes, however, I feel the rest of the song gets pushed to the side, and how could you do something so cruel? The repetitive but boner-inducing synths that phase in and out and get layered on top of one another throughout the song, which then escalates into the REAL chorus of the song, where Kylie's voice becomes 99% breath and 1% vocals, which works so perfectly as an antithesis to the hook.

Since CGYOOMH Kylie hasn't really had a big hit in the USA (Get Outta My Way deserves), but the legacy of this song continues to live on: nonsense hooks,  lowkey synths, and I'd even say the unconventional structure the song carries. And also winning a Popheads rate.

# Australians

**awryj** (11): iconic

**banananaise** (11): no matter how all yall no-taste sweaties vote, CGYOOMH is the best song in this rate, sorry i don't make the rules

**mamas\_spaghettini** (11): support local produce

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (11): Not Kylie's best song, but still the best and most iconic song here.

**perfumevee** (11): There was some close competition but my queen must have my 11!

**1998tweety** (10): I know I've used this to describe a lot of songs in this rate but its true: pop perfection.

**CarlieScion** (10): im offended that some people (TK) are so tasteless (TK) that they (TK) give this a 0

**chihuahuazero** (10): Hook after hook after hook.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): I think the rate *Fever* was put in was created specifically in mind for this song to win.

**dramiaa** (10): Not even that good. Why does she keep repeating ‚Äúla la la‚Äù ? This is the definition of overrated: not catchy at all, terrible instrumentation strange vocals‚Ä¶ Even Cool for the Summer deserves the win more than this

**enecks** (10): Deserved to win over Toxic don't @ me

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I honestly can‚Äôt ever get this song out of my head when I hear it.

**itsabop** (10): #KyliesBest

**jamesfog** (10): Kylie Minogue is underrated.

**MashLuke** (10): "hey Kylie what'd you want the chorus to sound like" "I'm leavin' soon, make it a blah blah blah or something mate" a hit was born

**MrSwearword** (10): exceptionally made music

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Australia has given us a lot of great things. The platypus is one. Kylie Minogue is another. Can't Get You Out Of My Head is the only international hit the Southern Hemisphere's Madonna has managed to push successfully outside Europe and Oceania, aside from the Locomotion, which absolutely nobody outside of dedicated pop fans remembers. Though Kylie's incredibly stellar solo career definitely ended up being wasted commercial potential in the rest of the world, Can't Get You Out Of My Head was onviously the best choice of hit that would end up managing to cement her legacy; it's supremely catchy and incredibly well produced, and even that is an understatement. It even beat out its twin sister, Toxic, in an incredibly close rate match. It's a solid track for Kylie to be remembered for, and if you're like me, it was a sure gateway into checking out the rest of her absolutely fantastic catalogue (which I'm still not done with).

**radiofan15** (10): Pure bubblegum pop perfection, there's not too much to say about a song that's so good it actually allowed Kylie to chart worldwide, a least for a while.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): THE defining song of the 00‚Äôs for me

**strawberryswing1** (10): fuck you u/tragickingdom1

**twat\_brained** (10): Fun fact, I heard this in my car today while I was running late to class before getting that same car scraped by a truck before sitting in a parking lot for 2 hours dissociating from reality. Sorry, I was getting sidetracked. It's a shame this was Kylie's only hit in the Americas, but if she's to be remembered for one it may as well be this. Even though Love at First Sight will forever be my favorite by her, this one is still a true pop statement.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): kylie end me

**welcometoNY** (10): it's not better than toxic but it's still pretty damn good

**ZankeeZero** (10): My least favorite Fever single, but as a Kylie single i'm pretty sure ii'l commit suicide before contributing to this doing semi badly somehow.

**NuneEtsuko** (9.7): Genuinely can't get this song out of my head hours after I accidentally hear it.

**Solovrinne** (9.6): A product of its time. It's still so catchy to this day. The song title is very accurate.

**mysario** (9.5): I'm ashamed to say I had no idea who sang this for half my life


# Americans

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I mean it's not as good as I remembered tbh...

**shipsinker44** (7): oh tbh i expected more?

**SpanKKy1** (7): me @tom holland

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): Huge Kylie fan, but this song doesn't do it for me, it's weird that this one took off in the US because it's kinda boring but it's Kylie so it's not bad

**original\_doll** (6): I actually like Kylie but this song specifically is overrated and kinda annoying

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): r/popheads and being obsessed with average songs: name a more iconic duo

**FireLordAegon** (5): Please don't hate me gays

**gannade** (5): its slightly catchy but also really overrated and i never could listen to it more than once at a time.

**HoodooMooJuice** (5): I don't know why you all like Kylie so much, this is just bad... This song sounds as if Eiffel 65 and The Black-Eyed Peas had baby.

**JohnnyBAverage** (5): alright I‚Äôll say it. I absolutely love kylie Minogue. She is one of my personal icons, but god this song is so overrated. Most will disagree, but I‚Äôm not sure I see what is the starmaker in this song. Still pretty fucking good though. The truth is hard sometimes.

**Tomoki** (5): As a Kylie stan‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt get this one. I think it sounds dated and the chorus isn‚Äôt fun at all. She‚Äôs done much better work both before and after.

**frogaranaman** (3): Set me free from this song, please. Not because it‚Äôs catchy or anything. Because it‚Äôs bad.

**hikkaru** (3): The "la la la la" part... yeah I can't get it out of my head, but I sure wish it would get out omg... I've never understood the love for this song and don't really know why it smashed so hard globally.

**CopyCatJ** (2): this song makes me feel queasy

**TragicKingdom1** (0): ok ok ok this is my sole hot take in the entire rate. this song has been a MAJOR shrinker across my years of browsing this sub and hearing people sing its praises, primarily for having too many hooks. i kinda agreed with that line of reasoning for a while, but now whenever i hear it i just feel REALLY annoyed. it reminds me of 2009-era will.i.am in the worst possible way. sorry to the kylie stans, but this is the only song in this rate that i actively dislike, and thus it receives my 0

Therokinrolla: **tapdancingpig** (9.5): This actually took a while to grow on me, but now I recognize it as one of the best pop songs of the 2000‚Äôs

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.1): This is one of the oldest songs in this rate but it is the future of pop, ta

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): ugh the radio in my childhood really destroyed the enjoyment of this song for me but I can't deny that it's still a strong 9

**bespectacIed** (9): Same with toxic, why is this song regarded as a pillar of pop music??? It's a great bop, I just don't understand the overpraise

**camerinian** (9): ok i was all ready and good to give this a 10 and then i re-listened to it and i swear i‚Äôm getting mandela effect‚Äôd or something but were those weird background synth effects over the verses always there? Idk but they are way more dated than the rest of this song, which is one of the first songs I remember knowing so of course I‚Äôm gonna rate it highly it‚Äôs basically responsible for turning me in to this mess

**nooodisaster** (9): Ugh I don't want to give a chorus that's just "la la la" such high a score, but this is actually sooo good. It's unique and has stood the test of time and the vibe is STRONG.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): we love our aussie queen of dance pop

**notdallin** (8.8): I had the biggest change of heart on this song since going through my music discovery years in the early 2000‚Äôs‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt stand it before. Now? I want the disco revival more than ever!

**stansymash** (8.7): i have applied my grooving ass and am prepared to groove

**sbb618** (8): Does the intro of this sound like Bruno Mars' "Grenade" to you? It's all I could think of when relistening to this.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Can get you out of my head, please and thank you

**Roxieloxie** (7.6): its okay

>Rehab is the peak of Amy's career, earning 3 Grammys for Record, Song, and Female Pop Vocal of the Year at the 2008. It deserves to win just as many rates - /u/Piccprincess
>
>Penguin: Has there ever been such a single that summed up a career as well as Rehab has? Amy Winehouse was told to go to rehab. She said no (no, no). Rehab is perhaps her magnum opus, a Ronson-assisted modern Motown smash. Like some of the greatest songs of all time, it was conceived accidentally and was recorded in about three hours. What they created in that short session is a song that brilliantly weaves together themes of alcoholism, heartbreak, responsibility. Winehouse channels her substance abuse in a way that feels both universal and understandable, and with a simple chorus everything made sense.
>
>In the Grammy Song of the Year Rate, Rehab was not in first place until the very end. It climbed a bunch of spots to get the rate throne at #1. And it damn well deserved it. Rehab is a lightning in a bottle track, and with its three Grammy Awards, it‚Äôs clear this isn‚Äôt an isolated opinion. Over a decade later, it‚Äôs clear that Rehab will continue to captivate generations to come. - /u/ThatParanoidPenguin

---

**Therokinrolla** (10): Rehab has taken on a drastically different meaning since it was a hit around 2006. Rehab was Amy Winehouse giving her music a vaneer of pop, and it turned the song into a fun, jazzy, track with easily quotable lyrics. It was a pop radio hit and gave Amy her breakthrough moment...

But of course, with the passing of Amy Winehouse due to her alcoholism, Rehab seems less like a fun radio smash than a hit autobiography. Mark Ronson, who produced the track and album, recalled a time when Amy came into the studio talking about how upset she was at her family and friends for trying to make her to go to rehab. She didn't need to go and she was fine and specifically recalled the quote, "They want me to go to rehab, and i said no no no." Ronson said, "that sounds like a hook, let's write that down and see where it leads." And we know where it lead. He was ashamed that his reaction was to write a song out of it instead of talking to her about it.

She eventually got to rehab. Even then, the song started to have a whole different meaning. She was a new pop starlet, so her name was all over the news and you better believe everyone knew about Amy's struggles.

[She won a Grammy for this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKraZ_2XvdU), and that video is honestly one of my favorite of hers. You can see how shocked, humbled, and emotional she is. It's the video of a girl in her early twenties accomplishing one of her dreams, accepting an award for a song that tells a tale of what would lead to her passing. I know this is a very depressing Amy writeup, don't worry, I'm much more celebrative in her Back To Black writeup, a song that wears its meaning very plainly. But Rehab just feels so different, so stark in intention and actual meaning. I can never listen to this song without thinking of what it stands for, and how ironic it is that this song is her biggest hit.

---
# They tried to make me listen to Rehab and I said, "Yes! Yes! yes!"

**Bendariaku89** (10): this is amy‚Äôs story, and she‚Äôs bringing me through it. the oddly happy music makes me really love this with its darker more melancholic message and lyrics. it‚Äôs the best way to convey this gloom that isn‚Äôt quite depressive.

**camerinian** (10): I hated this song when it came out when I was 9, and frankly 9 year old me was a dumb piece of ass cos I‚Äôve been racking my brain and I can‚Äôt think of a single reason why. The production is immaculate, the bluesy progression is really refreshing, and of course Amy is a goddamn powerhouse. Obviously the lyrics hurt to listen to in retrospect, but shit if it isn‚Äôt legendary.

**frogaranaman** (10): The members of Lanex when I see them snorting coke off of the men‚Äôs toilet seat right before closing.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Still mad at how this placed in the Sophomore Stunners rate (even if it won another rate). Y‚Äôall better not do this song dirty here.

**lunasaflowers** (10): I feel like people often think of this song as tragic in the context of how Amy's story ended, but honestly this song is absolutely heartbreaking entirely on its own. A masterpiece, though, without a doubt.

**MashLuke** (10): this is so sad I need a drink now

**NuneEtsuko** (10): I always forget how much I enjoy this jam.

**original\_doll** (10): kind of a depressing song retrospectively but still a classic

**radiofan15** (10): ANOTHER WINEHOUSE CLASSIC. If I had made the rate British Sophomore rate, this would have been my 11 just by hoW important it was for me: seeing Winehouse peforming Rehab at the MTV Movie Awards opened a lot of musical doors for me and made me the music lover I am today. BRAVO AMY BRAVO.

**raicicle** (10): amy is a legend wbk

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is a really close 11, i love it so much

**shipsinker44** (10): a contender for my 11, this is a legendary song that should never be forgotten

**SpanKKy1** (10): too real but still a slapper

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is the best song on B2B, I can't believe that the title track won that rate last month.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Literally just a song written about Bojack Horseman

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): iconic

**twat\_brained** (10): The SOTY rate and seeing this win truly made me appreciate Amy's legacy not only in reviving soul but also as one of the genuine best 27 Clubbers out there. It doesn't get any easier without here and this song confirms that.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): a classique

**ZankeeZero** (10): There are infinite points that she has made

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I can't speak for everybody, but I think a lot of us were expecting Viva La Vida to win the Grammy rate, or even for Adele to climb on top of the podium a second time. I was absolutely shook when Rehab got all the glory instead. That's when I started to appreciate the landmark it is. As much as Amy deserves to be remembered for other songs like Tears Dry on Their Own or Love is a Losing Game, there's an obvious reason why Rehab ended up being her biggest original hit. In wake of her death, there's hardly another recent song that can sound so morbidly captivating, combining elements of jazz and soul to create one of the most infamous examples of dramatical irony set to musical form. While everybody sees it as the ultimate showcase of Amy's substance abuse problems and partying lifestyle, not many people take the moment to realize that it also gives hindsight into her character, giving you an unfortunate idea of why, in the end, the woman didn't make it. I may not have appreciated her music until years after she passed, but it still haunts me to this day that, even after it won awards and critical praise, nobody in Amy's management actually stopped to consider what this song was trying to tell them.

# SMH don't you know she passed have some respect lort

**gannade** (7): not as good as B2B

**notdallin** (7): Issa bop but if plz if y‚Äôall need to go to rehab please go go go :(

**Solovrinne** (7): Unfortunately I do not dig this as much as Back to Black. I think the message is a little... problematic? Doesn't stick with me. Sorry Amy.

**tapdancingpig** (7): This song is about a minute longer than it needs to be, and good God, it‚Äôs uncomfortable now. Also I‚Äôm bitter that this was the big crossover hit and not You Know That I‚Äôm No Good or Back To Black.

**welcometoNY** (7): this is pretty much her only song that doesn't bore me

**nooodisaster** (6.5): We go from the best song on Back to Black to like... 12th best. Still better than some of y'all's favs' whole careers, so there IS that.

**lilacsweetener** (6): good song but also a cry for help

**Shadow1087** (6): never listened to amy winehouse prior to this but im just not a fan of the vintage sound

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (6): maybe she should have gone to rehab üò≥

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (5): Just makes me sad now, tbh...

**teenage\_meme** (4.5): it goes on forever GOD WHY

**mudkip1** (1): this song aged like milk

Therokinrolla: **mysario** (9.5): I've heard it too much to give it a full 10

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.3): Put this on at a party filled with people who have never drank in their life and they will still scream THEY TRYNA MAKE ME TO GO TO REHAB off key

**1313Harbor** (9): ‚Äúi just need a friend‚Äù me too amy

**1998tweety** (9): This song is so groovy it's hard to not want to dance to it. The juxtaposition between the haunting lyrics and the carefree instrumentals really elevate this song to another level.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): great song, not B2B levels of perfect, but still one of the best of the 2000's

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): Not my favorite song by her but it‚Äôs still very nice. Love the tubular bells and the horns.

**dramiaa** (9): An all around great song. The verses are interesting, the instrumentation is very fitting and dramatic, and the chorus is just iconic

**dropthehammer11** (9): do we stan yes we do

**FireLordAegon** (9): Amy slaying as always.

**Tomoki** (9): One of those songs that you love to sing along to because it‚Äôs SO catchy, and then later you realize what the lyrics are and feel bad

**stansymash** (8.8): this one takes me back to my days in rehab

**amacaroon** (8.5): I love anything Motown, and this sounds like something Smokey Robinson would write

**bespectacIed** (8.5): I initially thought this song was really grating albeit being a bop, but the context is heartbreaking as always

**ExtraEater** (8.5): m a r k  r o n s o n

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): the church bells make me feel like this is a christmas song in disguise

**enecks** (8): The irony's too bitter to make this my Winehouse of choice, but issa classic.

**jamesfog** (8): A classic bop

**MrSwearword** (8): *see comment for Back to Black*

**airylnovatech** (7.5): I Say-ee Nowwoahwoah

**literally100bees** (7.5): Great song, but really sad in hindsight

>This is the closest thing to a second Run Away With Me that we really had from Carly. It's huge, anthemic, joyful, and while I can see why it didn't make the main cut of Emotion it's a pretty decent bop. As a rate winner, all I will say is that since Poppy is now a criminal we had no other options - /u/bluehxrizon

---

**Therokinrolla** (8.5): I think the scariest moment of my life was the beginning of this rate, when I thought that Store was enough of a meme to defeat this and Vroom Vroom. I still am behind Vroom Vroom, but Higher is good and its easy to see WHY it won a rate. I mean, that chorus, that brilliantly high octane chorus, is just so impressively done. The fact that this is a B side of Emotion is astonishing and a symbol of how high quality that album is. While I don't think it has that much more going for it beyond the dazzling hook, it is a great track and very cleary represents the quality of Carly's songwriting.

**Solovrinne** (11): After much consideration, this is it. The bop of all bops. My 11 and I am shameless. This song is LEGENDARY and you all know it.

**1998tweety** (10): I prefer Fever off of B-sides, but this is really good too.

**bloupp** (10): Lowkey Carly's best song

**chihuahuazero** (10): I went into this thread expecting for this to have worn off but it‚Äôs heavenly as ever.

**enecks** (10): If you make a joke about "every one of my fears is spanish" I curse you to eternal erectile dysfunction

**gannade** (10): euphoric

**literally100bees** (10): Masterpiece

**mysario** (10): from the best album of 2016

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): :kimbryell:

**PuggleMaster** (10): queen of Spanish Roses was still robbed

**rotating3Dtext** (10): I listened to this song so many times...

**stansymash** (10): carly rae jepsen is getting my highest scores because i just couldnt get more boring if i tried

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Carly keeping this perfect pop song for a B-sides EP shows just how much quality material was created during the Emotion sessions. The production is dripping with 80s and the big MTV hook reminds me alot of Heaven is a Place on Earth.

**twat\_brained** (10): I can't even lie, this fucking bops and is better than half of E‚Ä¢MO‚Ä¢TION. Why did LA Hallucinations make it and this didn't? In fact, I really ought to give both the parent album and Side B a relisten sometime soon. In the meantime I may as well vanquish my fear of Spain I got from this song. That glass percussion is definitely gonna help in doing so.

**JohnnyBAverage** (9.7): all of my fears are spanish. Not even my fav on B-sides but what can you say that already hasn‚Äôt been said. I don‚Äôt know where but she sends me there

**bespectacIed** (9.5): This song is about drugs and fever is about an STD, don't @ me

**camerinian** (9.5): This is like blueprint Carly, like it‚Äôs great, obvs, but it‚Äôs kind of boringly great by her standards, get what i mean?

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): Greg Kurstin is a highly underrated producer

**FireLordAegon** (9.3): CARLY SLAY JEPSEN

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): B side legend that should have been on the main album but I'm just glad it exists, I will say I blame listening to this song for a recent smash bros bracket loss against a bayo player that carried me off the top like 3 times but I'll forgive Carly for that

**radiofan15** (9.1): Not one of Carly's best (even on this EP) but i'm not mad that it exists (after all it's in an outtakes EP) but Store is better.

**CarlieScion** (9): every one of my fears is spanish :kimbryell:

**HoodooMooJuice** (9): Seamlessness, flawless.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): why wasn‚Äôt this on emotion

**jamesfog** (9): Top 5 songs of 2016 for sure

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I think y'all are just bitter that Carly won a rate again. This song is gorgeous. Despite being absolutely fantastic, Higher's regulation to Emotion Side B isn't a mistaken choice, simply because it doesn't really fit into Emotion's iconic tracklist. You couldn't find a way to squeeze it between I Really Like You and Gimmie Love, or in the middle Making the Most of the Night and Your Type. On its own, though, much like the other songs on its parent EP, Higher is up to par with the quality of Carly's previous release. Pure ecstasy floods you when you hear the glorious synths build up to the magnificent chorus, and divorced from one's biases, I can't ever imagine the song sounding anything near boring. 'Everyone of my fears is Spanish' is honestly the best mondegreen since Hendrix, too. For a white Canadian, Carly sure is anti-colonialism!

**shipsinker44** (9): > one of my fears is spanish< carly voted for donald trump pass it on

**SpanKKy1** (9): store outskinnied

**teenage\_meme** (9): THIS SONG IS SO HAPPY

**amumumyspiritanimal** (8.5): in the context of the EP rate it was a definite 10, but here... it seems kinda mediocre. I mean still a 8+ but yeah not near a 9.

**Roxieloxie** (8.2): like the 4th best song on this ep

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): this isn‚Äôt even the best song on side b

**nooodisaster** (8): It's like the 4th best song on its EP, but still really great :)  The last chorus' "second best! second best!" stole my virginity.

**tapdancingpig** (8): I docked a point because ‚Äúevery one of my fears is Spanish‚Äù isn‚Äôt the real lyric.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): [Abbreviated list of songs that Higher by Carly Rae Jepsen is better than](https://i.imgur.com/gg2aBE7.png)

**welcometoNY** (8): this is the worst song on side b so of course it would win a popheads rate

**aulyve** (7.5): This is like the.....fifth........best song on Side B maybe? But guess what: it still slaps!

**hikkaru** (7): I don't even know why this won lol it's not even close to the best song on Side B imo

**ImADudeDuh** (7): "every one of my fears is spanish" yas queen of racism! Trump is SHAKING at this Latinophobia!

**J\_Toe** (7): trust me I like CRJ it's just this isn't my favourite of hers

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): Rihanna's Higher is better

# Party for 1s

**AbnormalPopPunk** (6): great production, fine lyrics, bad delivery. the chorus isn't even as catchy as half the stuff on emotion or side b. first time literally laughs in this song's face.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): I think this is really overrated. Kill me if you want

**MashLuke** (6): boring

**notdallin** (6): the most overrated song on side B fosho

**Shadow1087** (6): this just reminds of bad times

**selegend** (5): Carly‚Äôs kinda iconic for getting a B-side in here

**Leixander** (4): worst song on Emotion Side B managed to win a rate somehow heh

**MrSwearword** (1): Hasn't aged well since first listen and will more than likely continue to age like yogurt.

>Wow! That's all I can say about this anthem. In the iconic dancepop comebacks rate, the golden statue went in Madonna's arms, which stopped her from falling behind her competitors. Her victory was slow, but steady - and, like a timebomb, she straight-up murdered Brit and Kylie. She truly did it again. In fact, I was gonna cancel the whole rate, if someone else had become the one. I believed in you, Madge, and still can't get Hung Up out of my head. - /u/awryj

---

**Therokinrolla** (10): After the career misstep that was American Life," a sonically confusing and thematically shark-jumping album, even for Madonna, it seems pop culture tried to call her "over" once again. However, that is not Madonna Louis Ciccone. Famously stubborn and legendarily inventive, she called back to her more dance driven album's "Madonna" and "Music" and ended up creating what is widely regarded as one of her signature albums "Confessions On A Dancefloor," the album from which this single originates.

With a very 80s disco groove and an even more 80s sample (yes it was released in '79 I know), Hung Up is a truly electrifying track. It encapsulates and brings your whole body into the rhythm, and it holds you through every increase or decrease in energy. Every line feels iconic and perfectly for screaming along. God, someday I really pray to be in a gay bar when this song comes on because it is gonna get lit. Obviously, this song didn't just strike a chord with the lonely gays on popheads, the song was a hit with the public. It was a number 1 hit in 24 (twenty fucking four, the list of chart peaks on its wikipedia page is one of the msot impressive I've ever seen) countries, while in America being the number 1 song on the dance charts *of the decade*, though it peaked at #7 on the BB100. "Time goes by so slowly," Madonna says, but when this song is on I never want it to end.

# Those who Run

**MrSwearword** (11): WE LOVE THE GUINNESS WORLD RECORD HOLDER FOR MOST COUNTRIES TO GO #1 [goddamnit, U.S. way to fuck up]

**Tomoki** (11): Okay hookers, sit down and let me explain to you why hung up is THE greatest pop song of all time. Without a doubt the single most iconic use of a sample in a song, maximal production that is both new and timeless, and a chorus that pops my pussy EVERY üëè TIME üëè.  When you think the song is over, but then it comes back for two more minutes? Your fave will *never*. Carly sweetie I‚Äôm so sorry, but Madonna gets this 11 today.

**1313Harbor** (10): Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! A bop after midnight!

**1998tweety** (10): Pop perfection, I remember this huge bop from my childhood. I wish I had another 11 to give to this song.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): seriously it's impossible to go wrong with Abba sampled songs.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): If you can manage to convince *ABBA* to give you a sample, you know you‚Äôre doing something right.

**Dracyoshi** (10): This is one of the best utilization of a sample I've ever heard! The production in this song is wonderful; it perfectly compliments what Hung Up is going for and brings it to the next level with details like the ticking clocks in the intro.

**enecks** (10): this lives up to the GOAT ABBA song

**jamesfog** (10): Another masterpiece from Madge

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): Madonna is literally the queen of being ahead of her time. She keeps on reinventing herself for each era and has set the path for the pop girls we know and adore now. ABBA deserves all the credit for the sample, though.

**nooodisaster** (10): Yep, this was a serve.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): More songs from old hags! It's a miracle that Madonna's ended up winning a rate twice on a sub like this one, but here I am, giving Hung Up yet another perfect score. Though this isn't the song I liked the most overall from its rate of origin, I definitely thought it was the best one, musically. Madonna makes perfect work of an ABBA sample on Hung Up, turning the backing track of Gimmie Gimmie into yet another astounding comeback single from the Queen of Pop herself. There's so much to be amazed at in this song's five minutes, not least Madonna turning a fifteen year old lyric ('time moves by so slowly') into a modern-day disco hook. There's one reason why people don't unjustly despise all of Madonna's post-Music work, and it's the existence of Hung Up and it's majestic parent album.

**radiofan15** (10): Imagine how happy this song makes me as a Madonna AND an ABBA stan... Madonna definitely knows her (gay) audience

**selegend** (10): Shook every limb in my body

**Solovrinne** (10): The ABBA sample just SLAYS ME. I am hung up on this song!

**stansymash** (10): my mom saw this list and said hung up would be her 11 so this one is dedicated to my mom

**strawberryswing1** (10): Honestly it's incredible that Madonna managed to release one of her best songs so far into her career. Truly the Queen of Pop.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): my biggest regret in life is forgetting to give an 11 in this rate

**twat\_brained** (10): If Michael Jackson is the king of pop, then ABBA are not too far in the pop kingdom. Thankfully, Madonna herself is the queen of pop, and she proves it here by reinventing not only her own sound, but by honoring those who came before her in a flawless use of a classic sample, bringing disco to the forefront of music minds just as she had done 15 years prior. And I'm glad to see she learned since her cover of "American Pie" how NOT to pay homage to a classic.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): madonna you are my god

**JohnnyBAverage** (9.9): Bitch find me in spin class during this song unstoppable

**bespectacIed** (9.5): Lukewarm take: this song is better than GG (AMAM)

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): The ABBA sample here is perfection! A bop from start to finish!

**mysario** (9.5): great non-80's 80's track

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): America has no taste. This has been established throughout the years. However, their biggest crime (besides stuff that actually matters) is not taking this to #1.

**yatcho** (9.2): That sample UGH

**banananaise** (9): truly madge's masterpiece

**ImADudeDuh** (9): a lazy sample but it bops so its mostly forgiven

**notdallin** (9): peak Madonna idgaf what you guys say.

**shipsinker44** (9): alright big big bop and the best of this album

**aulyve** (8.5): STILL FUCKS.

**camerinian** (8.5): if i‚Äôm gonna nitpick (and i have to cos of how good everything here is) I would say the bridge does kind of kill the momentum for how long it lasts for with not a lot going on, but that is the only fault I have with the otherwise killer crescendos from verse to chorus

# Time goes by so SLOWLY

**frogaranaman** (7): I‚Äôm hung.. up on my boyfriend!! And how hung he is.

**MashLuke** (7): ABBA did it better but this is fine

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (6.9): did blackout outsold? discuss

**warmishblood** (6.5): Good chorus, great production, alright verses, Gimme More should've won

**LandonKidatrea** (6): Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (Dirty Bit)

**original\_doll** (6): yeah the sample is well used but I would rather just listen to Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!

**Bendariaku89** (3): i just associate this song with that part of madeon‚Äôs pop culture song.

**dramiaa** (2): this chorus is not nearly good enough to be repeated this many times and ‚ÄúRing ring ring goes the telephone‚Äù might be the worst lyrics on this rate. The song would also be much more bearable if it wasn‚Äôt pushing 6 minutes: when you finally think its ending at the 4 minute mark it starts up again with that annoying clock sound. Madonna could also have found a better phrase to keep repeating other than ‚Äútime goes by so slowly‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt think it would have saved the song. I‚Äôm probably gonna get hate mail‚Äôd for this

**Roxieloxie** (0): i heard this song in the plug once and hated it and was really shocked that it's that it's this popular

Therokinrolla: **FireLordAegon** (8.5): Solid bop.

**ZankeeZero** (8.5): it keeps growing on me with every listen. Unfortunately, it still hasn't grown on me enough for a 10, maybe next time :pensive:

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): [insert dick joke here]

**literally100bees** (7.5): That ABBA sample slaps

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): it's alright

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.1): if you ‚Äòsample‚Äô (or just straight up take the instrumental of) the best ABBA song, your song is gonna be a banger

>This rate was so cool because it had songs from 5 decades. and honestly, nobody could've won this rate besides Prince. Our most famous mod probably approves. - /u/superr_rad

**Therokinrolla** (8): My mom quite likes this song. She is, what you would call, a Prince stan. I have heard this song many times throughout my life, although I never actually knew its name or who it was. Color me suprised when I was doing the hag rate and I heard that iconic piano/synth/whateverthefuckthatinstrumentis, melody and immediately was able to place it to my mom and the thousands of times I heard that song not actually knowing what it was. It was a nice emotional moment for me.

Sadly, my mom is a racist, and for that reason this song is out. thank u, next

---
# Lovey Dovey

**static\_int\_husp** (11): I said it once in the All-Stars Rate, I'll say it again here. As a Minnesotan I will always give Prince my 11 when given the chance. Plus, you can't NOT love the synths at the end of this song. So cool.

**amacaroon** (10): The perfect song. Would be an 11, but I‚Äôm not really a fan of Prince doing that baby voice thing

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): This is my Dad‚Äôs favorite Prince song so what else can I give it?

**Dracyoshi** (10): When Doves Cry really showcases Prince's talent, both vocally and musically. I don't need to make a write-up about this song, hundreds of other people already have. It's amazing.

**enecks** (10): It's no Purple Rain, Darling Nikki, or Let's Go Crazy, but Purple Rain is the GOAT album so it's still a 10

**frogaranaman** (10): Prince is horny in literally every single song he makes, but he is EXCEPTIONALLY horny in this song.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Masterpiece

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I fucking love prince

**itsabop** (10): #Classic

**lunasaflowers** (10): A straight-up PERFECT song. The guitar fucking kills.

**MrSwearword** (10): PRINCE'S BEST SONG. DEAL ACCORDINGLY

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Before the All Stars rate, there was When Doves Cry; barely robbed by Billie Jean in the 80s rate, it managed to be uploaded to Youtube just in time before it beat Blondie and exchanged its silver medal for a gold one. Along with its original rival, this is probably most critically acclaimed song to ever win a rate, climbing on a top of a lot of already beloved Prince songs; given that, there's not much to say about its musical merit except for the fact that it honestly makes my ovaries fucking burst. Prince is hot, the song is fire, and the entire world ends up getting shaken during the last minute and a half when he starts panting. Goodbye.

**radiofan15** (10): Because of how unavailable Prince's discography was online I discovered WDC thanks to a cover by Alex Clare just barely knewing this was a Prince song. After he died and saw Purple Rain for the first time, it really hit me how Alex Clare's version was nicely performed but interior in every conciveable way, thanks Prince's state for showing me the way!

**Roxieloxie** (10): a fucking banger

**Solovrinne** (10): I'm amazed at the production for this track given its time!

**stansymash** (10): poople rain

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Classic again

**TragicKingdom1** (10): timeless bop

**JohnnyBAverage** (9.7): I still cannot believe there is no baseline in this song, it blows my mind everytime I think about it.

**1998tweety** (9.1): This is pretty groovy.

**1313Harbor** (9): The production on this song outshines the lyrics for me, but the whole song is iconic.

**mysario** (9): I'm not shocked this won a rate, I'm shocked it won a POPHEADS rate

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): submitted without comment

**amumumyspiritanimal** (8): iconic

**camerinian** (8): God I don‚Äôt want to be the guy who nitpicks a song like this, given how many stone cold classics Prince has released, but‚Ä¶ this song always felt a bit empty to me. LIke, it‚Äôs missing a bassline, or another synth melody, or something to make the production feel a bit more fleshed out. Of course Prince himself is on point as ever, but this isn‚Äôt one of my favourites from him.

**jamesfog** (8): This won a rate?

**nooodisaster** (7.8): I always heard this as "When love dies" so I'm always surprised when I hear this song. Also, the 80s was a flop decade.

# Dovey Deady

**FireLordAegon** (7): It was ok.

**MashLuke** (7): birds don't cry

**notdallin** (7): This is first time I‚Äôve ever listened to Prince?????

**twat\_brained** (7): The guitar solo at the intro is really out of place with the rest of the song, I don't get it. The synths, however, are incredibly on point and really make the song for me. I'm not sold on the guitar solo at 4 minutes combined with Prince's screeching, though. And what's that riff on the 5 minute mark? Why are we at a 5 minute mark? Bad Romance itself is just under 5 minutes, yet it doesn't feel drawn out. This does. I now wish Call Me won instead.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (6.4): doesn't need to be that long but ok

**gannade** (6): I forget what rate this won and if Purple Rain was also in it but Purple Rain >>>>>

**original\_doll** (5): kinda wish I was giving this song a better rating, but it's just okay in my opinion. Prince has other songs that I really like :/

**GoWestYoungKanye** (4.3): I have a feeling I‚Äôm going to be murdered for this but I hate the industrial parts of this and the random shrieking especially because I KNOW Prince is better than this song

>A bonafide classic, and a very worthy winner in a rate which gave back to the world. Having been in the Top 5 through the majority of my rate, fingers crossed it's the same here! - /u/berober04

---

**letsallpoo** (11): There have been plenty of rate winners that I've fostered deep and personal connections with over these past years, and I thought about all of them as I mused over my 11. "Merry Go 'Round" was the song that got me into not only Kacey's incredible artistry, but also country music as a whole. (Its victory over the deserving but slightly inferior "Follow Your Arrow" made me ecstatic.) "Cool for the Summer," not only my favorite pop song of the past five years, was my first 11 to win a rate. In the end, though, I had to settle on "Heaven Is A Place On Earth," the winner of the first (of hopefully many) charity rate and the song that I submitted to it on a whim. Even divorced of rate context the song deserves this score - it's a classic bop (revitalized by *Black Mirror*) that has gotten me through some tough times. But I'll forever cherish that Christmas Eve when I was sitting in the backseat of the car, bored out of my mind and following the rate, and learning that my song had somehow won.

---
# Heaven IS a place on Earth
**camerinian** (11): This is one of those songs that has always been in my life and probably always will be. It is 80‚Äôs pop perfection, from the punchy synths and drums (especially the drum breakdown in that bridge omfg), the evocative lyrics, the lovestruck delivery, the subtle guitar strumming over the chorus and pre-chorus that make all the difference in the world, the gorgeous melody, the masterful key change, there is not one element out of place in this song. I had to ignore my childhood loves of MCR, Michael Jackson and Kylie and my current loves of Chvrches, Kendrick and Lorde in order to recognise stone-cold perfection in music. This would easily make my personal top 10 songs ever, and might be my favourite pop song of all time, andifthislosestoslumberpartyisweartogod

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): Oh, boy, if all the comments on this song are about Black Mirror...I admittedly haven't taken the time to dive into her work, but from what I've read up on Belinda Carlise's career, I wonder if pop music fans should pay more attention to somebody seemingly so iconic. Heaven Is A Place on Earth is, alone, a huge indicator to me that the woman is talented in creating catchy hooks. Hearing snippets off the bubbly lyrics, you might end up assuming that the song's a cute one that's meant to end up being played in crowded grocery stores, but to listen to it in full is to be treated to an irresistible tsunami of bravery, goodwill, and sheer hope for the future. Not one section of Heaven Is A Place On Earth can leave your mind afterwards, because, secretly, despite our grumbling and exhaustion directed towards the mess that life tends to be, Belinda is singing about the love and humanity all of us desire and crave for. Who knew a simple pop song could end up stirring such emotions?

**1998tweety** (10): The definition of iconic. The chorus is so easy to dance to.

**cyborglilith** (10): Who hates this song?

**MrSwearword** (10): one of the best slices of 1980s cheese

**mysario** (10): I gave it a 9.5 last time and idk why

**original\_doll** (10): love how triumphant and joyous this song is, 80s perfection tbh

**twat\_brained** (10): When people think "80s pop", often Madonna, Michael Jackson, Prince and Whitney Houston come to mind. And then we have your one hit wonders. With all due respect to Belinda, I'm afraid this falls under said category. Thankfully, she made it count, giving us a truly iconic staple of '80s power pop.

**Dracyoshi** (9.5): Sugary sweet 80s pop. Almost a bit too sugary, but still fantastic.

**jamesfog** (9): POP PERFECTION!

**HoodooMooJuice** (8.5): I've only ever heard this song in commercials to be honest. But issa bop.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): honestly she kinda snapped

# The gays are appropriating again

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): I mean even before it was a kinda lesbian anthem it was a perfect song, so yeah.

**bespectacIed** (10): I'll pile on the inevitable barage of unoriginal san junipero comments. If you won't give a 10 to a song that conjures an image of a lesbian utopian afterlife set in a 80s beach-side California disco town, you're 100% homophobic, /s.

**enecks** (10): Lesbians represent

**gannade** (10): san junipero

**radiofan15** (10): Instead of doing a San Junipero joke, i'm gonna say instead that I almost convince my boyfriend to put this song in the graduation video of his class but he chose It's Time by Imagine Dragons instead and no matter how much I love him i'll never forgive him for that.

**raicicle** (10): lesbian

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This song always makes me think of San Junipero, which is a very good thing

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): I know 95% of the comments are going to be about Black Mirror but hey, I can't fault it for reintroducing this amazing 80s pop ballad to the world. This song is basically an unironic Robin Sparkles song and its absolutely wonderful.

**ZankeeZero** (10): A holy gay bop.

**chihuahuazero** (9): I still need to watch Black Mirror.

**JohnnyBAverage** (9): lesbian anthem  thanks black mirror. Rated a point lower because Belinda Carlisle was mean to Michelle Visage that one time but this is one of my favorite songs of all time

**RandomHypnotica** (9): I can't seperate this song from San Junipero anymore (not like that's a bad thing tho)

**VodkaInsipido** (9): i love gay people and sun junipero

**animefangrant62** (8.5): something something black mirror am I right?

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): something something...San Junipero... something something...the gays won

**1313Harbor** (8): The power of Black Mirror and lesbians.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (8): San Junipero

**warmishblood** (8): A classic that I'll now associate with San Junipero

**lilacsweetener** (7): obligatory watch san junipero if you haven't already

# They don't know what that's worth...

**notdallin** (7): I like this song but the chorus lowkey sounds like a commercial jingle for like mentos or something

**frogaranaman** (6): A creepy older Grindr gay once messaged me ‚ÄúI bet heaven is a place on earth with u ;)‚Äù and that‚Äôs greatly diminished my enjoyment of the song.

**J\_Toe** (6): prefer Britney's Heaven on Earth

**nooodisaster** (6): I honestly have no context in how to rate this. Like.. it's a catchy song? Nothing special. I was negative 8 when this album was released and honestly the 80s was a flop decade besides "I Wanna Dance With Somebody" so......... a 6?

**ReallyCreative** (6): It's pretty bland as far as 80s pop rock songs go but it's inoffensive on the ears

**selegend** (6): /u/letsallpoo make love to me

**Tomoki** (4): This won a rate?

**flickeredinmymind** (0): I hate this song so much. It reeks of the 80‚Äôs. I despise the chorus

>I don‚Äôt think any other song in Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs discography is as much a display of sheer raw power than DNA. While the song has a good beat courtesy of Mike Will, an ear-worm chant of a hook, and powerful delivery from Kendrick, it‚Äôs really the final minute where it turns from a great song to a classic. The beat builds as the Geraldo Rivera sample cuts in, and then it counts down as Kendrick prepares for liftoff. The final minute of DNA. is what makes it a rate winner, with some of Kendrick‚Äôs very best rapping and Mike Will‚Äôs very best production. This was the rate where Kappy truly lost. - /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus

---

**letsallpoo** (10): I've seen this song referred to as the greatest "I'm the best rapper alive" song in the past few years, and I can't think of a better description. Also, fuck Fox News.

---
# DNA more like DNYay

**ComeOnAndSlang** (11): it's lost its magic from the first dozen listens, but god fucking lord were those initial listens amazing. pure hatred, fuck everything, fuck everyone, fuck me, fuck YOU

**dropthehammer11** (11): kendrick might very well be my fav artist period and this is one of his best songs so a big fat 11 for this icon

**Roxieloxie** (11): i wasn't even gonna give this my 11 but fuck, that last verse goes so hard. do you know how therapeutic it is to yell "MOTHERFUCKER I GOT WINNERS ON THE WAY" when you're mad also this was robbed from being in black panther

**1313Harbor** (10): Mike Will snapped. I actually love how short this song is, it‚Äôs absolutely packed.

**Bendariaku89** (10): wow. what a blast of lyrical genius.

**bespectacIed** (10): As a huge kendrick fan who was a bit let down by DAMN., I thank kung fu kenny for blessing us this GKMC-quality masterpiece

**camerinian** (10): I‚Äôve listened to this song probably 100+ times and that fucking beat switch still blows my fucking mind like Travis Scott tried to do this on basically every song on Astroworld and he couldn‚Äôt get one a tenth as good as this holy shit

**chihuahuazero** (10): Kendrick freestyled the second verse acapella.

**cyborglilith** (10): H Y P E

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): no explanation necessary.

**gannade** (10): a jam

**ignitethephoenix** (10): THE BEAT CHANGE CURED MY ACNE AND KENDRICK HEALED MY SOUL WITH HIS RAPPING.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I got, I got, I got, I got

**MrSwearword** (10): first time I'm listening to this...it's really good but let's be real, HUMBLE. was robbed. Still, this knocks like a motherfucker

**Piccprincess** (10): I just have to hear ‚Äúsee yousa yousa yousa yousa BITCH‚Äù and I hit the stan button so fucking hard lmao

**radiofan15** (10): Anyone complaining about Kendrick winning the Pulitzer should travel back in time and met me when I frist heard this track and the beat switch left me fucking bald from everywhere (butthole included) and say that to my face as the beat switch also gave me the stregth of a twink's hips who other than being a top, also loves the reverse missionary position and has a thing for obese guys.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): absolute banger

**strawberryswing1** (10): I GOT I GOT I GOT / GIMME SOME GANJA!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): igotigotigotigot

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This song made Big Quint break his chair leg from dancing and he wasn't even halfway through the song yet. It's an enormous banger while also being a lyrical showcase for Kendrick, proving that yes, white rappers that aren't Mac Miller, you can make good music that is also technically good rapping. Mike Will Made It also comes through with two of his best beats, and the song is so good it almost makes me forget I was rooting for it to lose so Tyler and Kali could have this spot.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): 911/10

**ZankeeZero** (10): Absolutely irresistible, a perfectly executed tune with great production! ~~but let's not pretend Tyler didn't deserve though~~

**FireLordAegon** (9.6): That last part/verse slays me every time.

**mysario** (9.5): Kendrick can go hard 24-7 if he wants but he's too busy getting a "Pulitzer Prize" pfft

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): one of the best hip hop songs of the decade. i don't have a personal connection to it tho so it will not be among my 10s

**Solovrinne** (9.2): Hot damn this slaps.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (9): bop!!!!

**enecks** (9): I had a brief phase where I hated this but nah this is amazing.

**frogaranaman** (9): [Is this blackface?](https://youtu.be/kfWksCufMwY)

**MashLuke** (9): a good song

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): One of my top picks for the best song of 2017, along with another song in this rate (Praying). The rap songs on this playlist can be a bit of an anomaly, but DNA is the track here that goes off the hardest, and Kendrick's pop radio appeal made this a perfect candidate to win in one of the sub's few hip hop rates. An immediate standout when one listens to DAMN., Kendrick wastes no time in pulling off the punches over a hard, arresting beat, firing raw lyrics that are easy to memorize within seconds of hearing his raps. The best part of the song is the climax, where an extremely white Fox News snippet leads into the man absolutely going off. It might be more radio friendly than anything we've heard off his past two albums, but it's still Kendrick.

**shipsinker44** (9): ive never been AMAZED by this song but it is really fun

**stansymash** (9): kendrick knows his tennis tournaments, nobody can take that away from him

**tapdancingpig** (9): I don‚Äôt like hip hop. I never have, and I don‚Äôt quite know why. Anyway, my hip hop loving friends well and truly stanned Kendrick, and I get it now. Every word in this song is there for a reason. Also, that sample in the middle of the song... genius.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I got adenine in my DNA, I got thymine in my DNA, I got cytosine in my DNA, I got guanine in my DNA

**twat\_brained** (9): I got new DNA strands I count 'em. The fucking **BARS** in the second half of the song, man! Someone look me in the eye and tell me Kendrick hasn't established himself as one of the rap greats. I would have no evidence to back this up as I don't listen to rap but that's beside the point.

**notdallin** (8.8): this song is so massive and loaded with surefire lyrics that I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs only just over 3 minutes! That breakdown 2 minutes in is so impressively creative.

**original\_doll** (8.5): probably an unpopular opinion but I like this better before the beat switch, still slaps tho

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.4): idk why I was expecting this to be the BTS song (horses not zebras, bitch) but I‚Äôm so glad it wasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not my favourite off DAMN, but it‚Äôs certainly a banger in its own right

**1998tweety** (8): Little Mix and BTS both did it better. This song is hyped up so much but I just don't get it. The last verse is pretty cool though.

**aulyve** (8): I wish it could hear the Blood --> this song for the first time again.

**JohnnyBAverage** (8): Best rapper of our generation bar none. My favorite song? Maybe not but the first time I listened to this song when that fox news bit hits I was absolutely living.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8): We love a fox news promo. Song slaps

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7.8): Humble should've won.

# DNA more like DNR

**nooodisaster** (7.5): This isn't my genre, but I can see how the lyrics could be really powerful for POCs and I do like the switch-ups in production.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): this isn't even one of the best on damn smh

**J\_Toe** (7): prefer the Lily Singh version

**welcometoNY** (6): the last minute goes OFF

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): i honestly don't get the hype behind this

**jamesfog** (4): :genericsmile:

**letsallpoo** (7): Out of the singles from *My Everything*, "Love Me Harder" sticks out a bit. "Problem" was a Pitchfork-approved bop that first established Ariana as a charting force, "Break Free" was a campy bop that established her as an artist for the gays, and "One Last Time" re-entered public conciousness in the wake of the Manchester bombing. "Love Me Harder" is different from all of the other singles. It's slower, sultrier, and sexier' the title obviously wants the listener to substitue "love" with a different four-letter word. The Weeknd is here, doing his usual thing, and their voices play into each other perfectly. The song is far from her defining hit, but it's become a relative fan-favorite, as evidenced by its inclusion in this rate and how preposterously high it got. Hopefully AG5 brings back the downtempo bops.

---
# Ari Go Round

**ignitethephoenix** (11): What do you get when you put 2 of the best current vocalists over Max Martin production? Pop perfection. This honestly is one of my favourite songs of all time (Ariana and The Weeknd are 2 of my favourite artists), and I‚Äôm perched for more collabs between then even though it will probably never happen again. Also shout out to whoever else gives this an 11 (unless I‚Äôm the only one then shout out to me)

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (11): Is it possible to be both R&B and pop perfection? This is an unexpectedly perfect combination of artists that really helped define their maturing and changing styles going forward and is also an amazing song. Max Martin's team kill the production and make the song both intimate and huge when it needs to be.

**Bendariaku89** (10): definitely ariana‚Äôs best sex song (yes, it‚Äôs better than god is a woman. fight me) it‚Äôs not the type of sex that isn‚Äôt just second thoughts full of hormones or parts, rather it‚Äôs the feelings and emotions, and that‚Äôs what makes this song better than other sex songs, because you can feel it (helped with the throbbing backbeats and the voices).

**dramiaa** (10): Painful to listen to

**followingfreeways** (10): this isn‚Äôt her best single but this is the single that got me interested in her soooo I owe this single My life probably

**hikkaru** (10): Ariana did the transition from wholesome pop girl to sex goddess the best out of all of her peers, imo. I mean obviously Miley's was wildly successful but boy was it jarring to the public! Ari's felt natural and it's this song that really pushed her that way - it helps that this song is AMAZING. The pulsating synth is so sensual and the production as a whole is boppy yet still fit for a sex jam. Ari and Abel both fit their parts incredibly and sell the song extremely well, which is so important to it succeeding. Definitely one of Ariana's best songs.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): My first 11 win!

**MashLuke** (10): I bet people fuck to this, I wonder if Pete and Ari did get it on to this, I'll leave you with this image

**MrSwearword** (10): collab that continues to age well

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): One of her absolute best. Ariana's voice is just magical against this production, a QUALITY smash hit!

**original\_doll** (10): brings out the best in Ari and Abel, plz collab again

**PuggleMaster** (10): ugh we stan

**rotating3Dtext** (10): the first Ari song I loved, and it introduced me to Abel

**selegend** (10): Best song by a long shot on that rate

**shipsinker44** (10): MUST I EXPLAIN this song is just fantastic, a contender for my 11

**Solovrinne** (10): One of the 3 songs on the list that's on my playlist. Maybe that says something about me. Maybe that doesn't. This is far above anything Ariana has ever done so far and is the epitome of the type of pop music I love. The chorus hooks you in like no other.

**twat\_brained** (10): Ari's sultry, intimate vocals combined with the dark, broody pop The Weeknd brings to the table makes for a song which, looking back, did relatively well when it peaked at #7, yet is surprisingly absent in the conversation regarding Ari's best songs. In any case, thank u u/letsallpoo for giving me the chance to hear this again. **Next.** ;)

**ZankeeZero** (10): A knocker.

**FireLordAegon** (9.8): Uhh this song is so relaxing, sexy, and fun all at the same time.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.7): I should have known I would be an Ariana stan way sooner

**camerinian** (9.5): Putting aside my personal anti-Weeknd bias, this is one of the most jaw-dropping songs in Ariana‚Äôs discography, and where I think she started really showing her potential as a balladeer. Like, it‚Äôs just brilliant in so many ways, in a very obvious way

**mysario** (9.5): normally guest artists make songs worse, but The Weeknd helps as a good counterpart here

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): I Feel like the Weeknd holds it back a *tiny* amount, but it's still a classic

**1998tweety** (9.3): Sex as a song...but its not even the best song at that in the rate.

**radiofan15** (9.1): Adriana and Habel's voices together sounds like a match made in heaven and among Grande's sexy tracks it must be my favorite... but that bridge always takes me out of the track (if we're rating this many great tracks, I can allow myself to be this picky)

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): is this really the only Ariana song that won a rate? sad. If it was Weekndless though it would be a perfect 10

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): "Problem" is still my favorite by her, but this comes in a close second. She should tackle synthpop more often, this sounds pretty exquisite. Fun fact: this was also the first song featuring The Weeknd I heard when it first came out.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Arguably, the classic rhythm and blues Destiny's Child and TLC popularized a generation ago more or less declined as a singles genre this decade, blending into mainstream pop and hip hop. Given that, it can be a little too easy to take its influence for granted: fortunately, The Weeknd makes you remember to pay your respects as he joins Ariana in this hit that ended up beating Call Me Maybe and State of Grace, outranking other well-loved singles from My Everything. Love Me Harder was another unexpected win; what made it triumph over big fan favourites or much more successful singles? While it wouldn't be my choice to win the anniversary rate, there's no denying that Love Me Harder is one of Ariana's most delicate and tender, yet marketable works; the innuendos flow smoothly here, drawing your focus to the song while not being explicit enough to make you tune out. Though My Everything an album had a singles problem, Love Me Harder served not only as a gateway for The Weeknd's later success, but as proof that Ariana was a serious pop artist, and more than just another ex-act hitmaker.

# Aritated

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This is a decent song but it really didn‚Äôt deserve to win the rate it won, and I‚Äôve heard better synthpop songs from both artists.

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): Mediocre but not unpleasant, there are so many better Ariana songs though

**welcometoNY** (5.5): the fact that this beat all of red and kiss is...not it. the weekend sounds gross (when does he not tbh) and ari actually sounds good but the lyrics are just the worst and the production isn't good enough to make up for that.

**RandomHypnotica** (4): what the fuck do you popheads see in this song. All I see is a painfully generic and forgettable attmept at a "sexy" break out from young ari

**Leixander** (3): what is this song doing here smh

**WilsonJason** (2): holy fuck i hate this song so much please dont remind me about it ever again

Therokinrolla: **dropthehammer11** (9): its a goddamn bop yall but lowkey should not have won the rate it was in

**enecks** (9): It's no Into You, but anthems for demanding a thorough dicking are always needed

**gannade** (9): Ari's discography is very hit and miss and you know it u stupid twinks but this is a hit.

**HoodooMooJuice** (9): YES Ari!!! Those arpeggios in the chorus... love my ears harder!! Sidenote the Weeknd is really good in this as well.

**nooodisaster** (9): IF YOU  W A N T  TO PLEASE ME!!!! Wow, what a perfect pop song.

**tapdancingpig** (9): Easily my favorite song from My Everything. I don‚Äôt love The Weeknd on the track, but the hook is so strong, that he just doesn‚Äôt matter. Also, Ari fucking KILLS IT!

**teenage\_meme** (9): i think this is the first ariana song i really liked! love it so much.

**NuneEtsuko** (8.9): Not Ariana's best song IMO but still a bop.

**jamesfog** (8.5): An amazing pop song.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.5): we love a song about threatening to leave a relationship if you dont destroy aris pussy harder, wow her mind

**amacaroon** (8.2): I usually love the Weeknd‚Ä¶ but Ariana outshines him a lot on this track and its a little distracting

**1313Harbor** (8): Wow I haven‚Äôt listened to this song in awhile, and I‚Äôm amazed at the actual enunciation she is giving.

**aulyve** (8): I know it's sacrilege but I think this is a better EDM Ari song than Into You. God the Weeknd is lame though.

**chihuahuazero** (8): I‚Äôve been following The Weeknd since Kiss Land and I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to imagine him on a song like this.

**frogaranaman** (8): This is about cock-and-ball torture.

**kappyko** (8): Ari snapped!!!

**notdallin** (8): You know what Abel? I think we knew what this song was about without that ‚Äúpressure between your hips‚Äù line; bUT FOR THOSE IN THE BACK, ITS ABOUT ROUGH SEX Y‚ÄôALL.

**Piccprincess** (8): daddy

**Roxieloxie** (8): i associate this song with one time i got lost in five below

**SpanKKy1** (8): this is so popheads.com

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): a good song but not Ariana's or Abel's best

**JohnnyBAverage** (7.5): I really like how she says gotta here??? idk

**skargardin** (7.5): I like it but it‚Äôs definitely overrated, there were better songs in the rate

**bespectacIed** (7): One of the few songs in this rate I don't like. Such a generic song from a generic album of one of my favorite main pop girls :(

**CarlieScion** (7): not even the best song on my everything lmao

**literally100bees** (7): I mean, it's good but it's no Dangerous Woman

**stansymash** (7): im about 100% certain this is a song

**Tomoki** (7): A solid chorus, but the verses are a little boring.

>It's little wonder that The Chain, at the time of writing, is the highest-scoring song in a r/popheads rate. Like the titular line says, Fleetwood Mac is the chain that keeps us together. "Us" meaning 16 year old girls who think they're witches, Marvel fanboys, r/lewronggeneration, and white suburban parents after a few glasses of red on a Sunday arvo. You all know this one. Now show it some love. (pls do not sabotage this just because you thought Dreams was robbed) - /u/sletrab07

---

**letsallpoo** (7): "Dreams" is a quiet, langorous little ballad, but it exudes such a strong warmth that will always succeed in leaving an imprint on your brain. Stevie shares simple maxims about life, on love and loneliness, on thunder and rain, that creates such a powerful sense of solitude but also strength. It's not like the battle of Troy - there's a lot that's subtle here. I'm not one to listen to older music, especially older rock music, but "Dreams" is an exception to me, and even after its rate, I find myself constantly replaying it. It's perfection in audio form, an absolute 10/10 in any conceivable metric, and I'm so glad that it's in this ra-...wait, what?

---

# Hooked on A Feeling

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (11): Y‚Äôall better not sleep on this. Words cannot express how much I love this song. That guitar solo, the harmonies, the drums...I could go on and on.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (11): my inner harry styles won, im sorry i‚Äôm so white

**SinfulAnarchy** (11): Epic.

**zekkyzach** (11): dunnnn dundun dun dundundun dundun dunnnnn

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): The best rate winner so far, I'm really curious where will it place overall. I have a feeling it will be sabotaged a bit but honestly it's top 10 worthy no matter what. Although Dreams should've won the rate, it's still one of the most iconic songs from the most iconic band of all time(Beatles who???) and it really deserves a highlighted placement in itself.

**dropthehammer11** (10): absolute fucking classic

**enecks** (10): Every time I consider "maybe this song is overrated" I listen to the hook and I end up singing along.

**gannade** (10): love it

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Iconic song. The guitar parts in this song are so good, and Fleetwood Mac vocals and emotion is amazing.

**JohnnyBAverage** (10): Fleetwood Mac is my, and probably your weird uncle‚Äôs, favorite band. I‚Äôd write an essay on Stevie Nicks here (work Stevie work) but oh what was that? Dreams didn‚Äôt win the rate? Anyway I can‚Äôt even be that salty because the Chain is a 10 and it slaps

**mamas\_spaghettini** (10): iconic

**mudkip1** (10): dreams is objectively better but oh well

**mysario** (10): the build up and harmonies in this are just breathtaking and I'm trying my best not to make a GOTG reference but

**radiofan15** (10): FLEETWOOD MAC is perfection and THE WHOLE RUMOURS IS PERFECT and if this doesn't get to the top 5 I will personaly go full Liam Neeson in Taken (the first, not the third one) on your asses

**stansymash** (10): based on the data we have, surely this should win right. its mathematical

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Fleetwood Mac is legendary, as is this song

**strawberryswing1** (10): I love you u/sletrab07

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Dreams really should‚Äôve won this rate

**Dracyoshi** (9.5): So much tension... I do wish it had a stronger climax to release that tension, but whew. Amazing song.

**jamesfog** (9.5): Blassic

**notdallin** (9.2): only in /r/popheads is the classic rock song from one of the most critically darling albums of all time an underdog in the rate.

**1998tweety** (9): Not my style of music but I can appreciate it.

**HoodooMooJuice** (9): Such a classic and deservedly so!

**itsabop** (9): #Classic

**original\_doll** (9): great songwriting! Harry Styles has a pretty nice cover of this fyi

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I'm going to boost my score for this by half a point for being from one of the best albums of all time, but even if it boasts the highest average a song's ever got in a rate, I'm going to add fuel to the heretic fire here and say that I'm a little tired of it. Yes, go ahead. Sue me. A lot of people love The Chain because of that one section everybody knows (sing it with me: CHAIIIINNN KEEPS US TOGETHER!) and while that part of the song is indeed amazing (RUNNING IN THE SHADOWS!), despite Lindsay Buckingham's guitar rift being an absolute standout, I tend to prefer the bass on Dreams or Stevie Nick's vocals on Silver Springs these days. While The Chain is still a fantastic song, maybe that fact's been done enough to death for me to truly feel an attachment to it. Of course, I could be wrong. Maybe months from now I'll think The Chain deserved to win this rate and I'll be gushing about how wrong I was on Discord.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): I kind of hate this for undeservingly beating Pet Sounds but that moment where Star Lord throws Ego into an asteroid and turns into Pac-Man... bro

**VodkaInsipido** (9): dreams is better

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I'm trying to associate this with Harry Styles and dissociate this from rose-tinted, nostalgia obsessed old male racing fans who associate this song with a time when F1 was better. Don't get me wrong, that beat switch is fantastic and this song deserves all the praise it gets. If anything I just wish the vocals were a bit better; Harry knows how to knock this out of the park when he sings it.

**camerinian** (8.5): Look I love Fleetwood Mac as much as the next guy, but honestly this isn‚Äôt one of my favourites from them. It‚Äôs a bit too classic rock trope-y, if you get what I mean. Like, of course the harmonies and the lyrics and the bassline are all great, but up until the outro it‚Äôs just a bit grooveless. Go Your Own Way would‚Äôve been a contender for my 11 fwiw

**nooodisaster** (8.5): *thumbs up*

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): i still think dreams is better but ok

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): post malone

**Bendariaku89** (8.2): this grew on me

**MashLuke** (8): more like fleetwoold mac

**MrSwearword** (8): I can kinda get why Dreams was robbed for this...

**skargardin** (8): Dreams deserved

**Solovrinne** (8): Harry Styles covered this! I'll give it a decent score. Just for him. He gave me a different look on the song.

**Roxieloxie** (7.9): this isn't harry styles

# On The Loose 

**banananaise** (7.5): why are americans like this

**kappyko** (7.5): this is good but is it dreams good

**frogaranaman** (7): Me: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Person that wears overalls as a fashion statement and exclusively follows trends who thinks liking Fleetwood Mac makes them indie: I wish I went to Woodstock.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (7): stream Off the Chain by Selena Gomez & the Scene instead

**shipsinker44** (7): idk if idsay this is the song that should represent fleetwood mac

**welcometoNY** (7): i am ~uncultured~ so i had never heard this before and honestly it was such a let down after everything it had been hyped up to be. like it wasn't bad or anything but there's nothing spectacular about it.

**raicicle** (6): deducting marks solely for being in guardians of the galaxy because it has made it a local meme

**FireLordAegon** (5): I feel bad for giving a non-pop song a low score, but I really didn't enjoy much of it.

**hikkaru** (5): I'm so sorry to everyone that has actual taste and likes older music that isn't that poppy but this just isn't for me even if it is iconic

**ComeOnAndSlang** (2): snooze

>If anything was gonna take down Gaga in a rate as vicious as 2011 Ultimate, I'm glad it was one of Beyonce's best songs ever made. As I said on Day 3, We came close, Team Gaga but as in the 2013 Ultimate Rate; we have to concede to a Beyonce song worth a damn. - /u/MrSwearword

---

**Therokinrolla** (9): WHAT is more alpha than releasing a 4 minute single where the second half in entirely key changes? NOT MUCH. I am not exaggerating, the last 2 minutes and 5 seconds of the song is the same chorus repeated 5 times with 4 key changes. And it sounds. so. good. Its such an unabashedly ornate showing of vocal skill. And it is no studio-fluke either, as she can so impressively slay this vocal performance [live too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISBOIMhWWFA).

And yea, the vocal showboating is absolutely stunning, but isn't the only reason this song is here. This song makes me so jealous, [maybe not of Jay-Z](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bwi7zDUIAAEQ57M.jpg), but of this kind of love, like damn you can tell she is singing this from the HEART. Someone please be my boyfriend.

# Take a shot every time someone says "key change"

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): talented incredible brilliant amazing never the same totally unique

**Bendariaku89** (10): didn‚Äôt know this was the song title for this song. i definitely enjoyed this song from when I was young to today. it‚Äôs just excellently executed and it‚Äôs very fun to listen to, what with the (6!)key changes and her voice.

**bespectacIed** (10): Would've given my unflinching 11 to bey if Countdown (one of the best songs released this decade) won this rate, but this score's high enough I suppose

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Holy hell I‚Äôm sorry I missed out on this rate, this is exquisite. She should do more disco-like tracks.

**enecks** (10): I'm kinda shocked a top anthem did so well in popheads

**gannade** (10): these vocals

**hikkaru** (10): I don't actually like Beyonce that much but WHEW

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is one of Beyonc√©‚Äôs best songs and I will fight anyone to disagrees. The quadruple key change at the end is iconic.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Key changes alone deserved a grammy.

**J\_Toe** (10): recently heard the album version rather than the video version and realised for the first time they're different it was an experience

**MrSwearword** (10): as I said, if Team Gaga had to go down in flames, at least it was to a Beyonce song worth a damn.

**mudkip1** (10): we stan key changes

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): If you haven't shredded your vocal chords attempting the 7000 key changes in this song are you even gay?

**NuneEtsuko** (10): Best Beyonce's song hands down!!!

**original\_doll** (10): queen of key changes

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Is there a moment where Beyonce transitioned from a good (and occasionally great) vocalist to a legendary one? That probably happened several times over the course of 4, but if we're talking about her songs that the general public remembers, that moment arrived, no doubt, once Love On Top was released. Giving the sax a welcome comeback around the same time the Edge of Glory did, Love On Top may as well be pop's music last love letter to jazz for the time being, combining some unworldly belts with a strong beat and melody, topping off in a fantastic key change that even Greedy can't hope to rival. In conclusion: Yep, I think this deserved the throne over Countdown. Sue me.

**perfumevee** (10): Funky, gives me a bit of an 80s vibe. Somehow I missed this song when it was originally out?

**Roxieloxie** (10): second favorite beyonce [vine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkJrNldb1ew)

**tapdancingpig** (10): This is one of my favorite ever Beyonc√© songs, also one of my favorite vocal warm ups. Just start singing the chorus in a fairly low key, then go up a half step until you hit the end if they keyboard. Works for warming up belting and soprano range.

**welcometoNY** (10): i'm a sucker for a good key change

**ZankeeZero** (10): This is the most embarrassing thing i've ever admitted but I used to dislike this and I absolutely get it now, it's so sunny and it feels like running in a nice, spring day with the sun shining, an above average gpa and having extremely relationships with every single object in your life, which is completely impossible considering that we're all gays with extreme issues but it's a nice Fantasy (by Mariah Carey)

**FireLordAegon** (9.7): You already know why this got a high score. Great vocals, sweet lyrics, KEY CHANGES, awesome instrumental. Overall just a top notch song from our Queen.

**camerinian** (9.5): This song has the unintended downside of ruining every other one of Beyonce‚Äôs bragging songs because she will never make a stronger flex than that chain of key changes

**JohnnyBAverage** (9.42): True story: The first time I heard this song I was with my high school best friend coming up on shrooms watching the music video. I swear I couldn‚Äôt believe the amount of key changes then, and I can‚Äôt believe them now.  Goddamn goddamn goodaMnN. Anyways of course beyonce delivers

**Solovrinne** (9.2): Yeah. I don't dig a lot of Beyonce songs but this is great. Wish I could hear something else like this in her discography.

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): Where were you when Beyonce literally invented key changes? Some say she's still climbing up there to this day

**1313Harbor** (9): This song is so fucking cute. I have a note on my phone to play it at my wedding.

**CarlieScion** (9): :kimbryell:

**HoodooMooJuice** (9): Anything for you BEyonce!!!

**static\_int\_husp** (9): The lst chorus, which just keeps going up, is so so good

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): scream queen, fox wishes

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Even though it's very throwback, there's such a refreshing, timeless feel to this song. It sounds like the big opening number to a really fun musical, and the lively, warm production helps amplify that mood as much as possible. I don't think its possible to not feel better listening to this.

**1998tweety** (8.7): Everyone raves about how great this song is, but I don't feel all of the magic. Sure the key changes are cool but I hesitate giving this a high 9. Nonetheless, its still a bop and is cool vocally.

**aulyve** (8.5): Did this really win over Countdown? Oh well. Great song. Ending is such a flex.

**banananaise** (8.5): it's impossible to NOT bop your head along to this beat

**stansymash** (8.3): it has a key change so i guess its good


# /u/MashLuke stole my category name for this section so there's really no point

**MashLuke** (7.5): considering the sub, it's mostly love on bottom

**radiofan15** (7.5): Cute Beyonce song and a surprise coming from her but I'm not a bif fan of it like most people... although I understand why most might disagree with me, I mean those key changes kept acumulating as if there was no end!

**shipsinker44** (7.5): honestly this song has kinda done the opposite of growing on me. chorus is forever iconic ofc but listening to the song now just isnt that fun

**chihuahuazero** (7): The key changes make this song, but beyond that, it‚Äôs mostly a curiosity.

**dropthehammer11** (7): countdown is the only song on this album worthy of a spot in the winners rate

**ExtraEater** (7): if this song was a drink, it would be lemonade

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Something something bottoming something something

**ComeOnAndSlang** (5): love on snooze

**RandomHypnotica** (5): This song sounds like it was made to be generic yet recognisable upbeat commercial background music

**selegend** (5): Good song, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs among her best

**lilacsweetener** (3): never understood the hype and the video is terrible

letsallpoo: # Miss Songeniality!

For this rate's miss songeniality poll, we considered how each song got here by beating out a bunch of other songs. When you think about it that way, all of those songs were also "robbed" of being in the top 10. To be fair to all of those songs, our Miss Songeniality poll has every single song that were in the first 50 rates we've done!

[Vote here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_SRxHI5PNgdbhth5vZMp8RbHDQqCF9JhMkchAR946IXfSkw/formResponse) You'll need an email to vote, but your email won't be recorded. Also you can only vote for one song btw have fun

JunkyGS: Hmm I would never think to interpret it that way. 

I took the references to religion & God as "You have done something so fucked up that no human being is capable of forgiving it" and the message being taking the sourest lemon life gave you and trying to form something resembling lemonade, not romanticizing it. 

Sorry this triggered and upset you in such a way friend. Do what is best for your mental health & way to cope <3
