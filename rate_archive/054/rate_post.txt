The Popheads Winners Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/9kljd3/the_popheads_winners_rate/

**Back** in February /u/dropthehammer11 hosted the All Stars Rate, a collection of our favorite rate losers where Toxic came out on top because it couldn't win its first rate because Kylie outtalented (don't tell poo I put this here). And now, on this blessed day we are pleased to announce the hopefully highly anticipated Winners Rate, where we took all the songs that won their first respective rate and also Toxic which needed a second try, and we will rate them. 

This will be a disaster.

#Hello homosexuals.
It is your favorite pair of hosts here, /u/letsallpoo and I, here to take you guys on a journey of anger, frustration, robbery, and slurs. Last time you saw us we invited a stunning array of pop superstars and also Tinashe to our humble internet forum to present the coveted Popheads Year-End Awards^**TM** . For better or for worse we have returned, and we plan for this rate to be the biggest yet. But first, some ground rules.

---

#RULES
 
* Listen to each song and **assign each a score between 1 and 10**. Decimals are fine so long as it is to **only 1 decimal place**. Ex) 7.2 and 4.9 are good, 3.33 and 7.75 are not.

* Yes that says EACH SONG, ballots without all songs given a score won't be counted. 

* Your scores should **NOT** be considered confidential.
 
* You may give **ONE** song a 0 and **ONE** song an 11. Please reserve these for your least favourite and most favourite tracks.
 
* You can **change your scores at any time**! Feel free to PM poo or I again afterwards.
 
* For rates we use a program that makes life easier for both the hosts and the users. There is a very certain way that your ballot has to be laid out, and luckily, as your hosts, we have done it for you.

* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space! Same if you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!
 
**This is the ONE AND ONLY correct format:**
 
> Runaway: 1 #DumpTrump
 
**These are INCORRECT, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:**
 
> Runaway: 1: #DumpTrump
 
> Runaway: #DumpTrump 1
 
> Runaway: I'm giving this a 1 because #DumpTrump
 
> Runaway: 1-#DumpTrump
 
> Runaway: 1 (#DumpTrump)

There is not a clear winner in this rate, and every ballot matters so PLEASE have a bigger voter turnout here than y'all do in the actual polls. 😒
