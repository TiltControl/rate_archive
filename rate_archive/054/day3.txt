>Mr. Brightside is one of the best songs ever created. It’s been almost 15 years since its release and it still sounds fresh. It is one of the few songs that can unite people of all music tastes. It’s been described as part of the soundtrack to our generation, but I think it will be in the soundtrack of future generations as well. It remains in the top 5 rated winners of all time on r/popheads, and rightly so. - /u/strawberryswing1

---

**letsallpoo** (10): "Mr. Brightside" is the definition of a classic, at least in the UK. Its endless charting across the pond have reached meme status, spawning [thinkpieces and whatnot](https://www.metafilter.com/173054/The-enduring-appeal-of-Mr-Brightside). Fun fact: It didn't even chart that well when it was released; only later in The Killers' career did this reach its legendary status. All of this hullaballoo is kind of funny when you really listen to the song, though, which is just about a guy whose girlfriend is cheating on him. You'll notice that there's only one verse that's repeated (apparently a result of Brandon Flowers not having prepared enough before arriving to the studio), and that then the bridge is just some synths and two words, and then the song ends. Yet even with its limited lyricism, "Mr. Brightside" manages to be so anthemic and cathartic, feeling so massive in scope yet feeling deeply personal as well.

# EMO ⚫ TION

**berober04** (11): /u/Leixander

**Piccprincess** (11): ~~gamer~~ emo bros rise up

**strawberryswing1** (11): I feel really basic and stereotypical giving the winner of my own rate my 11, but this is honestly one of the best songs ever made, and I worry that the general popheads population won't do it justice compared to the rest of these poptimist bops. Here's to hoping it makes Day 3!

**1313Harbor** (10): What a crowd pleaser.

**1998tweety** (10): This song has some of the most well known lyrics among my generation. Honestly every line follows perfectly, I can't really think of any improvements that could be made. The bait and switch line is amazing too.

**followingfreeways** (10): ok so according to last.fm this is my most played song which doesnt really make sense but it is one of the most iconic bops ive ever heard in my life and it never gets old soooo I guess it’s ok

**frogaranaman** (10): This song is the living embodiment of “I’m copy/pasting my work to meet the page requirement and hoping the teacher doesn’t notice” and it’s become the anthem of our generation because we all relate to that.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): if you don’t give this song at least a ten, you don’t like pain

**ignitethephoenix** (10): There’s a reason why this song was on the charts for a million years in the UK

**ImADudeDuh** (10): KINGS OF THE UK

**itsabop** (10): #StillOnUKCharts

**jamesfog** (10): One of the best rock songs of the century

**lunasaflowers** (10): It slaps, next question.

**MashLuke** (10): America's best export to the UK after Halsey

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): this song made me straight and it can really use some remastering tbh

**MrSwearword** (10): come on, even I know to give this song full marks. Shit, it's STILL on the UK charts.

**mysario** (10): straights thrive on this

**nooodisaster** (10): l am white.

**notdallin** (10): CAGE-COMING. FINE-DOING. CAB-CALLING. DRESS-STRIPPING. RATE-INVIGORATING. CHEST-BEATING. FIST-PUMPING. CLUB-DANCING. RADIO-TOPPING. ME-KILLING. EAGER EYES-OPENING. BECAUSE I’M MR. POPHEAD.

**original\_doll** (10): this song is fucking timeless

**RandomHypnotica** (10): one of the most iconic songs of the 2000's, it's hard not to love a song as infectious as this

**rotating3Dtext** (10): it’s like, iconic

**Roxieloxie** (10): gay culture was me and my best friend screaming this while our straight friend just stared at us

**shipsinker44** (10): iconic legendary

**SpanKKy1** (10): this is the anthem for all white people

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): C O M I N G  O U T  O F  M Y  C A G E

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This song kind of randomly became a meme, but nobody should ever forget how much of a bop it is. That whole prechorus launching into the classic hook will never ever get old.

**twat\_brained** (10): When you hear Dave Keuning pick the D flat major chord, you fucking know what time it is. Also it took me until I was like 17 to notice the fakeout from "sick" to "chest". Hell, listening to it now I'm getting goosebumps just from hearing it. This is and always will be the epitome of '00s indie rock, and is justly considered one of the best songs of all time.

**welcometoNY** (10): this song is the definition of epic.

**aulyve** (9.5): Eternal.

**Dracyoshi** (9.5): A fantastic song, I just wish the vocals were a bit higher in the mix.

# On the bright side...

**AbnormalPopPunk** (6): yeah its iconic and whatever, but i will never willfully listen to this song in full

**bespectacIed** (6): Forgive me for my one sabotage (kind of), but I can't let this inexplicable meme place high in this rate

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): https://imgur.com/a/0kf2yCU

**J\_Toe** (6): Didn't even know about this song, much less how big it was in the UK/ The world until last year.

**selegend** (5): Coldplay and Maroon 5 had much better songs

**stansymash** (5): i dont have to answer your questions

**Leixander** (4): a four because /u/berober04 would flay me otherwise /s nah i don't hate it as much now but still not a song I would listen to much.

**gannade** (3): this song just rubs me the wrong way. its ... so... aggressively heterosexual and vanilla

**tapdancingpig** (1): I don’t know how I avoided this song. Apparently it was ubiquitous when it came out, but I never heard this until now. I know I’m being controversial, but I don’t get it all. I would have given this a 0, but I do like the guitar riff. The rest... I don’t know. It feels dated in a bad way. To all the ~~straight white boys~~ people who love this, I’m sorry, but I had to.

**Shadow1087** (0): garbage, what even makes this good, it just sounds like noise
[/r/popheads/comments/a0a23j/the_popheads_winners_rate_day_3_rolling_in_the_10s/eag3ypm/]

=====

Therokinrolla: **airylnovatech** (9): Turning snakes in to the sea, 20 percent lullabies, Joking on your alibis, butt is just the price I pay, destiny is calling me, open my eagle eye, cause I mister briiiiightsiiiiide

**camerinian** (9): gonna be real my generation has overplayed this song to shit, so I’m a little sick of it, but on the other hand I haven’t had a greater rush at a concert than at The Killers show when they fucking opened the set with this when I think everyone expected it as the closer or encore, so like that’s a killer (heh) experience that’s directly the result of this song’s ubiquity so like yeah dang

**enecks** (9): It's a classic, but Somebody Told Me is objectively better in every way.

**JohnnyBAverage** (9): drunk white girls anthem. But tbh when I was coming to terms with being in love with my straight best friend not realizing i was gay(™) yet at 17, this song was the absolute shit. I can’t lie this bangs. The weariness on that second “I’ve been doing just fine”? So Good.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): This rate is basically meme paradise, isn't it? I'm surprised All Star isn't here, too. Along with Welcome to the Black Parade, you might as well call Mr. Brightside the Stairway to Heaven of this generation, much to the ire of middle-aged classic rock fans. Everybody can sing the lyrics to it as a party, and chances are this'll end up getting in your head every time you check the British charts and see that the song snuck back in again. The Killers aren't my favourite band by any means, and I occasionally do find Mr. Brightside's production too heavy to make me stand putting it on repeat, but the song has so many merits to it where it's impossible not to see why it's so popular internationally. Everybody's favourite bunch of Mormons (sorry, Imagine Dragons) interpolates a little known sample from David Bowie's proto-punk classic Queen Bitch to bring you one of alt radio's biggest hits in the early 00s, wild and confused and just generally more epic than the scenario Brandon Flowers is telling us about. Even sabotage couldn't stop this from being one of our most highly rated songs, ever, and on a sub like popheads, that should tell you everything.

**rickikardashian** (9): so this did grow on me after i did the rate and i like it quite a lot, BUT WHY IS IT A CHARTING SONG AFTER A DECADE?? LIKE IM NOT SAYING IT’S BAD, BUT THIS KIND OF SHIT ONLY HAPPENS TO LIKE MARIAH DURING CHRISTMAS, BUT NOT TO RANDOM ASS SONGS AT RANDOM TIMES OF THE YEAR.

**amacaroon** (8.9): Subtracted 0.5 because I’m not British /s

**Solovrinne** (8.9): The karaoke song. Everyone knows it. I don't think it's as timelessly amazing as people say it is.

**literally100bees** (8.5): but she's touching his CHEST

**teenage\_meme** (8.5): i wanted to give it a lower score just because it is so not the "millennial stairway to heaven," but i have to admit it does bang.

**bluehxrizon** (8): white anthem

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): definitely a good, catchy song, but I don't really understand its icon status or memeability

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): Good but not great, wyd UK

**FireLordAegon** (7.5): This is white America's national anthem and honestly, they have taste.

**hikkaru** (7.5): i mean it's a good song and all but i guess i just don't have the deep emotional connection to it that allows me to burst into karaoke whenever it comes on

**radiofan15** (7.4): I hate to be the hipster here but I prefer their Sam's Town stuff... but even I can't deny the power of this eternal UK charting entry

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7): OUT OF MY CAGE AND IVE BEEN DOING JUST FINE but the song isnt anything outstanding if you are not british

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7): is this emoheads

>This song winning honestly shocked me when i saw the results, mostly because the song was actually from 2011 and didn't really define 2012. And I thought there were so many songs that the sub probably liked more that also defined the year (Call Me Maybe, Take Care, Die Young, Niggas in Paris) but this song, that got very little low scores compared to people that actually gave the other songs really bad scores, and so it ended up coming out on top, through sheer likability. - /u/Nerdy_boy_chris

---

**letsallpoo** (7): When people complain about how we're rating certain songs multiple times, I usually try to point out how not everyone has done the original rate with that song, and that there's new people joining the sub, and that the song's eventual placement will still depend largely on the songs it's grouped with. But for "Rolling in the Deep," I'm starting to get tired of it. This is our fifth goddamn time rating this song, and it's sitll in the top 10 again. I'm impressed by those who have consistently done these rates and still feel compelled to give this high scores. I agree that it's a great song, but I think Adele's put out some much better music since this song. Is it iconic? Yes - it's a huge earworm, surely, but it's also the song that kickstarted Adele's domination outside of the UK. Is it good? Well, yeah. I'll readily admit that. Am I sick and tired of it? Yes, yes, a thousand times yes.

# Y'all we've rated this song five times and you're STILL giving it tens?

**1998tweety** (10): This song is incredible, the chorus is explosive and I love how it has a third verse and then a bridge.

**amacaroon** (10): fuck all the people who say Adele makes soccer mom pop as an insult. If this is what soccer moms like, they have quality taste

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): perfect bop tbh

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): I mean come on, how can you not give this the (second) highest score possible? It literally redefined pop music at the time and told everyone that it was a genre that was still to be taken seriously.

**enecks** (10): I mean this is just a stone cold classic. Is there anything new to say about this? The production which does a lot with surprisingly little, Adele's wig-snatching performance. It's all been rolled into the depths of the collective consciousness.

**ExtraEater** (10): scientifically cannot get tired of this song

**followingfreeways** (10): i distinctly remember me trying to sing this when i was like 10 and realizing that i cant sing for shit:) anyway this is iconic

**frogaranaman** (10): God, my ex ain’t worth shit. I don’t have one, but he ain’t worth shit.

**gannade** (10): i will not be giving my 11 to it this time but its a huge bop. queen adele really slayed the competition when she marched her way into the mainstream with this

**MashLuke** (10): a song about a stoner living in the undergrounds

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): # 1 – Lights – Ellie Gouldong

**mudkip1** (10): https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/020/327/skai.jpg

**mysario** (10): gets my hyped while crying

**nooodisaster** (10): Adele corroborating to include this song in every rate to ensure she always gets our streaming money: https://66.media.tumblr.com/e0fbd76f639f383b1df98dc9af9fcbf3/tumblr_inline_mtpun1bJsZ1qix8w1.jpg

**original\_doll** (10): thank u godele for blessing us with this song

**radiofan15** (10): A NEW CLASSIC. Those drums, the piano, the harmonies at the chorus... it really deserves its status, although the John Legend/Glee acapella version outsold /s

**shipsinker44** (10): a banger is her career

**Solovrinne** (10): The most unforgettable Adele song. Very tempting to get an 11. Honestly one of the greatest songs ever made.

**SpanKKy1** (10): this skinny legend snapped tbh

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The loud, punding rock beat from Adele is honestly my favorite song of hers. Just great.

**strawberryswing1** (10): fuck sabotagers this is a wig snatching song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Easily one of the best songs of the millenium, a true dinger for middle-aged women everywhere.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): can't wait for the bottom to fall out under this and it misses day 3

**twat\_brained** (10): I love this song and I both love and miss Adele's music presence. My neck still hasn't recovered from being stepped on when I first heard this at age 12. From the guitar in the beginning, to the drum in the verse, to the piano in the prechorus, to the absolutely flawless chorus, complete with a backup chorus layering everything so beautifully; I swear, this is one of those songs where I'm not even mad at its overplay, it's a perfect song that deserves to be shared with everyone. And that doesn't even cover how barnstorming this sounds live.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): how can you not love this

# Overrated

**JohnnyBAverage** (7): I had a voice teacher who really wanted me to be able to sing this song but obviously no one can sing this song as Adele. Unfair standards tbh for that its a 7

**ReallyCreative** (7): I don't think it's aged super well compared to some of her other discography but it's not a bad song by any means

**Tomoki** (7): The song that ruined Adele’s vocal chords (I assume) and also mine trying to imitate her. A solid bop.

**welcometoNY** (7): a bop but so ridiculously overrated

**notdallin** (6.2): this song came out at a time when I was completely out of the music world. Coming back to music years after this song came out I had no idea why it was so beloved. Still not quite sure to this day what’s so great about it.

**ZankeeZero** (6): VERY overplayed. goodbye

**MrSwearword** (5): I'll commiserate until people start accepting it. Only the GRAMMYs performance post vocal surgery is the good version of this mediocre tripe.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): ellie goulding - lights

**selegend** (4): I contend that this song is mediocre, and it never deserved to win that rate!!

**PuggleMaster** (0): My least favorite Adele song, I wish literally any other song was her break out hit.

#Déjà Vu

**Leixander** (7): how many rates will you be in

**skargardin** (8): This again?

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): On average, we now rate Rolling In The Deep almost two times per year. In fact, it's likely that we'll rate it a sixth time after Billboard's official decade end chart is released soon, as there's little doubt that it'll be in it. For this alone, it's easy to predict that Adele will get her lowest average score ever this month, and that this may very well be a Day 1 boot. I hope it isn't. Sure, even I'm getting tired of seeing this song, but it's a legitimately fantastic icon of modern-day blue-eyed soul in Britain. It's hard to believe that this is one of the biggest songs of the 2010s, considering all the hip hop we got later on, but even if Rolling in the Deep serves as proof that 2011 was actually a really long time ago, it still remains monumental.

**bespectacIed** (9.5): I never submitted scores on any popheads rate and even I am exhausted of rating this song lmao. This is deservedly her signature song though

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Can this finally go a rate since the 2012 rate without being sabotaged by people afraid of this winning?

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve rated this song, but it’s still a 10 and a classic.

[/r/popheads/comments/a0a23j/the_popheads_winners_rate_day_3_rolling_in_the_10s/eag4qi1/]

=====

Therokinrolla: 
**NuneEtsuko** (9.6): Never fails to get me pumped up.

**bloupp** (9.5): Someone Like You is better but this is still iconic

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.4): It was at this moment I realised I was actually doing a rate of 10s and 11s. Some 100s, even. [Poo please give us 100s it would make the bloodbath so much more bloody ty.]

**camerinian** (9): I wasn’t actually as blown away by this is 2011 as most people seemed to be but I’ve also listened to this song probably more than other hit from that year since because of how it aged so much better than everything from that weird awkward period of mainstream pop so good on it there i spose lol

**dramiaa** (9): The ultimate karaoke song. I liked it when it was still being played on the radio, and I like it now. The bridge is everything. My favorite Adele song

**dropthehammer11** (9): how can u not give this a great score

**jamesfog** (9): A meme in the popheads community.

**Roxieloxie** (9): it's good but it's no someone like you

**sbb618** (9): Side note before I start I didn't see this until now so that's why I'm sending this in a week after the deadline I'm sorry

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): queen

**stansymash** (8.8): i lost all my scores and comments cause i refreshed the page so all the gold i wrote like "this song is good" is gone

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Look, this song was EVERYWHERE when it first came out. It probably would have been a 10 if I wasn’t still kind of sick of it.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Definitely one of Adele's best singles. I tend to prefer her songs that have a grander feel to them over ones that try to be uptempo pop songs (Send My Love can GO) but this one really works.

**airylnovatech** (8): Years later and we still don't know what this means.

**aulyve** (8): This is one of those songs where I'm never tempted to listen to it but when it comes on I'm like oh yeah it's a good one

**CarlieScion** (8): not adeles best!

**kappyko** (8): it slams mannnn. as much as adele gets associated with the most boring and vanilla of adult contemporary pop soul, "rolling in the deep" remains this amazingly badass tune. the greatest indie song of all time

**LandonKidatrea** (8): Ellie Goulding was robbed. Lights should have won.

**lilacsweetener** (8): good but was never a favourite of mine

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): I love this rate already because I get to be overly critical and bitchy about hit songs, my favorite hobby! That being said this song is still good.

**raicicle** (8): a good song but have you ever noticed the fact that the background vocals going “starting to wish she” are singing the wrong harmony

**teenage\_meme** (8): even though i've heard it so many times i'd change the channel if it came on the radio, it's a really really solid track. i love her attitude, and she has such a great belt.

**FireLordAegon** (7.5): It's a certified bop!

**Shadow1087** (7.5): quite good innit

It is genuinely one of my favorite songs ever. - /u/InfernalSolstice

---

**letsallpoo** (10): There was no other option for the winner of the Ultimtae 2017 rate. It was obvious to most that it would be "Praying," and its eventual victory felt like more of a relief than a cause for celebration. Just look at its original stats - it accured 36 11s, the most ever for a single song, and only a modium of low scores. The fact that there weren't really any other viable options in the three mediocre albums in that rate probably helped, but a win is a win.

"Praying" is not perfect. The mixing is a bit off - Ryan Lewis (of "Macklemore &" fame) produced it, and the soft piano keys often don't mesh well with the vocals. That high note in the bridge, that apparently took numerous attempts to land in the studio, definitely sounds like it, and its unavoidability has doomed several live performances of the song. The first half of it, without the belting and shrieking and pounding drum and bass beats that constitute much of what people remember of the song, can be construed as boring.

But the song is perfect enough, and well-worthy of all those 11s. The song is ostensibly about Dr. Luke and the emotional and physical abuse she suffered at his hands, but "Praying" operates as an unmasking of herself to the general public as well. Ke$ha was marketed as a sleazy dirtbag, or "Taylor Swift + vodka" as Facebook memes and YouTube comments liked to put it, which was a character that brought her a lot of profit but also a lot of derision despite her solid music and detectable rock and roll leanings. The story goes that that's not who Kesha really is though, and as her first major release since she dropped the dollar sign, "Praying" loses the glitter and electropop and tries to bare to the world who Kesha really is.

Part of me resents the extant necessity of "Praying." Implicit in the song is the idea that to prove yourself as an artist to the general public and to critics, it's necessary to shed the gaudy carapace of a pop star, flush your music out of synths and fun, and adopt a country or acoustic facade. The fact that her musical talents were only really recognized after this song's release bothered me greatly. Despite all of my poptimism, however, I can never fault the greatness of this song and its emotional power, or how it still sends shivers down my spine. Forget the high note - the part that always sticks with me is right after the first chorus, where she plainly sings, "I am proud of who I am." And here she is, as the Kesha who was always there: talented, raw and broken, and not going down without a fight.

# no nothin good starts in a gold trans am car

**itsabop** (11): #RobbedByTheGP

**1998tweety** (10): I don't think much needs to be said here since I'm sure everyone else will have already commented on it. I love that the more passive chorus starts ramping up into an aggressive one as the song goes on.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): It was so hard to not give this song an 11. It's one of my favorite songs of all time, and I always tear up a bit when I listen to it. Not many songs can channel raw emotion this strongly through music.

**camerinian** (10): [Comment redacted by lawyers representing the estate of Dr Luke, who was pronounced dead to the world when this song came out I mean whoops haha best of luck I’m sure Max will return your calls soon]

**chihuahuazero** (10): Saw this live!

**enecks** (10): I wish I could move on from being abused. But that never happens. It just keeps happening again. I wish I could have strength to move on. Instead I just keep attempting suicide. I wish I had more stability. Oh yeah, Kesha is a legend

**ExtraEater** (10): changed the world

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): It’s just so fucking beautiful. The raw emotion. The pure talent. ‘When I’m finished they won’t even know your name’. Ugh. I’m so grateful for Kesha channeling her pain into this song, I can’t imagine it was easy.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A motherfucking power ballad.

**JohnnyBAverage** (10): I’m really trying not to overreact with high scores for every song. But also - 10. I remember crying when the song first came out, and sobbing at the music video. This song came out right as I was able to get the courage to leave an abusive relationship, and let me tell you this song was on repeat for a while there.

**Leixander** (10): top ten of this rate is going to be a mess

**lunasaflowers** (10): Still so fucking powerful.

**MashLuke** (10): God hates gays, Kesha prays to God, Kesha and God are friends, she's cancelled. The song is still good tho

**MrSwearword** (10): again, it's mainly for context of release/timing is everything and this is catharsis in a song.

**mysario** (10): omg that high note gets me every time

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): One thing I've realized recently is that, despite how good of an anthem Praying is, it's not a song I come back to often most of the time. That's because it's not an easy one to listen to. Personally, Praying opens raw wounds for me; I, too, was sexually abused by a person in a position of power above me, just like Kesha was, and that made coming back to the song for the first time in awhile a rough journey. While it may not be hard, solid evidence admissible in a legal court, nothing convinces me that Kesha's gone through some sort of trauma more than all the pain she floods Praying with, which is a rollercoaster full of hurt and suffering from start to finish. Yet, despite all the agony that's present here, agony that I deeply relate to, Kesha also makes Praying a closing chapter. There's ambiguity here despite the power, ambiguity about how she's going to deal with her struggles exactly, and ambiguity over whether she chooses to forgive her abuser or not, but as Kesha states, the most sorrowful part of her life is now past, and in the chorus, she wishes the darkness - and the man that caused it - farewell, this time for good. In that sense, Praying is also as much if an empowerment song as it is a confessional. That's the genius and the power of Praying, and that makes me regard the song as a perfect one, even if there are a few flaws in it here and there, like Kesha's voice running short for a few brief minutes. Whatever rough edges the song has only makes it have more of an impact.

**gannade** (4): I have always been a harsh critic about Keshas vocal ability so a ballad from her never did appeal to me. she just doesnt have the voice to pull it off. i do like the lyrics & the emotion in the song tho

**frogaranaman** (0): This just triggers me from my own personal experience more than anything other emotion this song is intended to evoke. So hard pass.

**Solovrinne** (10): I didn't know what I expected from Kesha coming back but this of course blew me away. Opinions about her lawsuit aside, this is such a good song on its own. Those high notes! The chorus that starts soft but explodes!

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This song was robbed of a Grammy

**tapdancingpig** (10): Like you don’t cry when you listen to this.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This isn't a song I can really listen to casually in a shuffle playlist, as its just so emotionally powerful that I need to ready myself. I love how the song, both Kesha's lyrics and the instrumentation, starts small and quiet and just slowly grows in confidence and volume, musically bringing you on Kesha's journey to this moment. When those drums and that chorus hit, you feel ready to take on that piece of shit Dr. Luke with her. It's just an incredible, raw, heartbreaking, triumphant piece of music.

**twat\_brained** (10): My favorite part of the song is the second chorus. It doesn't have **that** F6 note but I love how the pianos are absolutely thumping, and you can hear the raw catharsis in Kesha's voice. This song stood head and shoulders above its competition in its rate and I'll be damned if it doesn't go top 10.

**Dracyoshi** (9.5): Amazing. I just wish Praying built up to the climax faster because the first minute is a little underwhelming.

**HoodooMooJuice** (9.5): A revolutionary revenge song.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Kesha absolutely killed this song in the best way possible

**nooodisaster** (9.5): well she snapped.

**stansymash** (9.5): i didnt understand how good kesha was until this song and now i will never look back

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): near perfect, wish the second verse was a little shorter tho

**dramiaa** (9): This is so emotional, I have to be in the right mood to listen to it, because the chorus brings actual tears to my eyes. The way the chorus keeps getting bigger is fucking amazing, and really delivers the message. Have I mentioned how much I love this chorus?

**original\_doll** (9): this is one of those songs I can't just listen to casually because it's too emotional

**Roxieloxie** (9): i'm not a kesha stan but i really love this song

**SpanKKy1** (9): dr luke’s impact

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): https://i.imgur.com/MBkDTGe.png

**VodkaInsipido** (9): a great song

**jamesfog** (8.5): One of her best, one of the best songs of 2017.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): what an amazing and empowering comeback from kesha

**ZankeeZero** (8.5): aaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**notdallin** (8.4): 2010 ke$ha can’t believe she wrote this song in 2017 either.

**radiofan15** (8.2): LISTEN TO ME, I know context is important and everything but if you took it out of this song you're only left with a good song, not a great one, in spite of how awesome is that high note.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I get it, it’s a good song.

**Piccprincess** (8): popheads be like "Yassss Kesha ended Dr Luke" (Now playing Heart To Break on Spotify)

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): if this song was as good as r/popheads has convinced itself it is, Kesha's comeback really would have been amazing. it's still good though.

>As I write this, this is the most recent addition to our list of winners, and the final entry into this rate. Back to Black breezed to victory in its original rate, where I never saw it leave the top spot after it took it. It's not hard to see why. The song is carried by a clean, consistent and catchy drums/piano combination, joined by an ominous violin in the chorus. Amy Winehouse's voice is instantly recognisable, and her natural talent is clear. Her lyrics are effortlessly poetic, without coming across very pretentious. In fact, she's very relatable across the song; it's a topic anyone can relate to.
>
>But most of all, besides all the composing elements of the song, what makes it stand out is Soul. Not the genre; though Back to Black borrows from old Motown and classical 60s girl groups, its production (and frank lyricism) sets it apart from the classics it emulates. What brings all this together is Amy's pure charisma, her voice that carries emotion naturally, as if it was born to do so, her lyrics that are without regret, defiant, but still so pained. She connects with the listener in a way that goes above and beyond the parts that make the whole.
>
>If there was ever any doubt about it: this is one of the defining classics of the 2000s. Winehouse is one of the last great soul voices, and sometimes it's depressing to think about the decline of the genre. But, really, isn't the sadness part of the point? -  /u/blue_heart_

---

**Therokinrolla** (10): Amy Winehouse had an incredible ability to come across as introspective yet detached in her music. Amy doesn't use abstract and emotive words to purvey her inner feelings, but imagery where you can infer her sentiments. In a jarring first verse that reminds me of the startling line about self-starvation in Florence's *Hunger*, Amy loathes her ex keeping "his dick wet." I love the line in that its is just great at grabbing your attention right out the gate.

In fact, the first time Amy introduces a non-concrete thought is in the chorus where she says, "We only say goodbye with words," and even then it somehow comes across as the least emotive way to say you can't let go of somebody. They farewelled with nothing but words, and their hearts, their minds, and even their fate is still together. It a lot said with so few words (ironically), yet still feels almost dismissive.

I think that's really a key thing about not just Amy's music but herself in general. Her image was of this tough, stubborn British girl. But she's not, she was a talented, poetic artist with her own troubles that she had to battle daily. And that is what really settles this song as her best track for me. It says so much in what it doesn't say. Her impact will be known for a long long time, and it's horrible we had to lose such a talented individual so early in her life. Rest in peace, Amy.

# rip

**NuneEtsuko** (11): My Queen singing her masterpiece, that is all. <3

**1998tweety** (10): This and Rehab were the only songs I heard before going into this album. Call it single bias but I believe both of those songs deserve 10s. The lyrics are the highlight of this songs, but the way her haunting vocals match the production is what makes the song so good.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): the whole album is absolutely iconic

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): it's only right that there are two Amy songs in the rate, but this is the better one. obviously.

**Bendariaku89** (10): her voice is phenomenal, and the song is an incredible message and story that i can’t relate to. i’ve never used drugs nor have i had a relationship, but the song just tells and shows you with its eerie but seductive tone laced with hints of desperation.

**bespectacIed** (10): ugh amy is such a generational talent :( Definitely her magnum opus. Kept all of our dicks, and ultimately our eyes, wet

**camerinian** (10): After I got over my stupid phase of not liking Amy Winehouse because… I dunno, I was a dumb edgelord kid who thought she was better shitty joke fodder than a musician, this was the first song of hers after the singles and I hit myself for ignoring this. Then 2011 happened and in spite of the circumstances I fell even more in love with it. She is a legend and the sooner stupid edgelord stop using drug addiction as comedy material, the better we’ll all be

**chihuahuazero** (10): “We only said goodbye with words, I died a hundred times.” Bam.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): The amount of soul packed into this song is almost too much for me to handle. I know it’s a cliche but seriously she was taken too soon from us :(

**enecks** (10): I miss Amy holy fuck she's amazing.

**FireLordAegon** (10): sigh... I wish I had a few more 11s.

**gannade** (10): you go back to her and i go back to black might be the best lyric of all time

**HoodooMooJuice** (10): Girl! Come in and slay me with this jazz ballad! Adele is Amy 2.0.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): okay first; why is this the clean version on the playlist smh. Also this is an amazing song and is Amy’s signature song that is not Rehab.

**jamesfog** (10): A masterpiece

**kappyko** (10): i miss u amy

**Leixander** (10): an 11 worthy song

**lunasaflowers** (10): We miss you, Amy. :'(

**mysario** (10): imagine being two acclaimed musicians covering this and screwing it up

**nooodisaster** (10): She snapped!!

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Popheads better *keep their dicks wet* with this song I will NOT accept robberies.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): The most recent rate winner probably won't take the throne this time around, sadly, but it still remains one of the best songs released this century. The jazz found in Frank is laid off a little in Back To Black to compose a solo version of girl group neo-soul, and as baffling of a choice as that may have sounded like in 2006, the acclaim this song's gotten proves that, without a doubt, Amy Winehouse was enough of a musical genius to pull the idea off. Don't let her rough, working-class vocals fool you; they carry Black to Black extremely well, putting emphasis on every word she says and making the song much more devastating. Though Rehab may have been her signature song during the aftermath of her death, it's likely that her final album's title track will go on to be the best display of her iconic songwriting skills, cementing itself as proof of the talent that left us too soon not so long ago.

**radiofan15** (10): After 12 years Back to Black still give me the chills. Her delivery, THOSE lyrics and the bridge are all mindblowing

**raicicle** (10): amy is a legend wbk

**shipsinker44** (10): queen of winning two rates omg, this whole ALBUM is a ten

**Solovrinne** (10): Who doesn't love this song. She did that. A stunning song with stunning lyrics and stunning vocals and stunning everything. Stunning. That's what this song is.

**SpanKKy1** (10): queen of substance abuse

**tapdancingpig** (10): This could have been my 11.

**twat\_brained** (10): RIP Amy. Gone but never forgotten. Already, this song works as a heartbreaking tale of a romance gone south but its poignancy increases at least twentyfold with Amy's passing.

**stansymash** (9.5): i am a bitch for a powerful chorus

**1313Harbor** (9): I’m sorry I can't hear you through the sound of my very loud sobs

**Dracyoshi** (9): I understand she's trying to go for that classic aesthetic, but I don't think it justifies the intentionally low sound quality. Not a great experience with headphones

**ExtraEater** (9): m a r k  r o n s o n

#She's meditating guys

**aulyve** (7): I'm gonna be honest I think some of Amy's music hasn't aged super well. I still enjoy it but the arrangements are so OTT and the dark, descending-chords soul sound is a lil cheesy.

**dropthehammer11** (6.5): its decent but she has better songs

**notdallin** (6.1): DAE think that Adele filled the Amy Winehouse-shaped hole in our hearts when she died maybe a little too snugly? I love Adele, but listening to their songs so close together makes me realize how similar their sounds are.

**teenage\_meme** (5): sorry guys, this just so isn't my sound.

**welcometoNY** (5): i know everyone loves this song but it does nothing for me

**mudkip1** (4): someone like you deserved

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (4): can she like hurry up and finish the song

**PuggleMaster** (2): I'm not really a huge fan of Amy's voice

Therokinrolla: **ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Me when I got a gold iPhone 6s and then they didn’t have a gold iPhone X

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): the only album with two different songs winning rates your fave could never

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Amy Winehouse was such an incredible talent that we lost way too soon. I know I've probably made the "this sounds like a Bond theme" note on around 80 songs in rates but this totally sounds like it could be one. The strings in the last minute are just gorgeous.

**Tomoki** (9): We miss you Amy <3

**JohnnyBAverage** (8.9): iconic Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it rip amy

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.8): every time i do something i shouldnt like skip breakfast or check up on people who were unkind to me this song plays so basically i hear it every day u feel

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): I love the song but i like the live version more

**dramiaa** (8): This has one of my favorite chorus of all time. And have yall noticed that in the Back to Black album cover her leg fits perfectly into the “H” of “Winehouse”??

**frogaranaman** (8): When I was younger and stupid I thought this song was about sex and therefore racist. But no, no, no.

**MashLuke** (8): not my thing but it's a good song

**MrSwearword** (8): Amy has better songs but this is cute

**warmishblood** (8): I usually hate this genre, but Amy Winehouse was so talented. It should be a James Bond song.

>When I found out that Ribs was going to win this rate while calculating the results, I was surprised but I shouldn't be. I understood why it won because the song resonated with a lot of people who were scared of growing up. Not to mention it was backed with the minimalist production that I miss from Lorde. - /u/DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy

---

**letsallpoo** (7): When you look back at the rate this song won, with two incredible albums as well as *Electra Heart*, "Ribs" isn't a song you would peg as a winner. Hell, it wasn't even a single, making it one of two nonsingles to win a rate (Carly's "Higher" is the other one). Still, "Ribs" has proven its lasting impact in the subreddit since its parent album dropped and since that rate. Aside from being a consistent reply in any "What's a good song about being a sad teenager?" thread that I swear I see every week, it's even appeared in our weekly charts.

As I grow older and move away from 2014, when I was wrapping up high school, feeling angsty, and listening to "Pure Heroine" on repeat, the less I'm drawn to songs like "Ribs." As one comment pointed out, it's a bit weird to hear a sixteen year old sing about getting old. Lorde probably feels the same - even pre-*Melodrama* she discussed how she hates listening to her old lyrics, and she largely abandoned those themes of youth and aging as she entered her sophomore era. Maybe that's just part of leaving adolesence: learning that being older than 20 isn't too bad, and that the things you liked when you were younger might've not actually been that good.

During the end of summer and the start of fall, the general discussion threads routinely get clogged with messages from people going off to school, whether it be college or high school or whatever else. It's usually around this time that "Ribs" makes a small but discernible climb up our charts. There's a lot of young people on this subreddit, and even though our past users are steadily aging, there's always new members joining in who are eager to discuss the wonders of pop music (or maybe just want to shitpost about Carly). I like to imagine that songs like "Ribs" haven't lasted so long because the same people keep listening to it, but rather because annually, new people go through the pangs of growing old at 16 and are in need of a song to articulate the fear, regret, hope, and pure angst trundling within them. While "Ribs" does little for me now, this little nonsingle is still uniquely perfect for anyone that age, whether they're that age now or that age 20 years from now. Is this how songs become classics?

**Therokinrolla** (10): About two years ago I discovered Lorde as an artist. I already knew her as, "that angsty broke girl" because of Royals, and I heard Tennis Court before too. A few months before that I was really beginning to get into music like never before: I was listening to whole albums and researching artists, whereas before all I listened to was literally the radio. This was all thanks to Lana Del Rey, who deserved this spot over Lorde, but Ribs is good anyways.

And so due to a ton of comments on Lana's music videos about Lorde, my angsty self carried my way over to the Lorde sub to see what songs they recommend and it was all about Ribs. So, fair enough. I expected some minimalist slightly angsty maybe even RnB tinged bop, but what I got was my fourth favorite song ever. It was so much that I hadn't really heard before, the super hopeless lamenting of time passing, the strange song structure, the airy and atmospheric lowkey production... it overwhelmed me and one of the very few times in my life that I would say was really "love at first listen." I was 16, it was the summer before junior year, I was scared about college (and didn't really wanna go), and everything resonated with me.

I immediately went to the /r/Lorde subreddit and posted [this ode to Ribs](https://www.reddit.com/r/lorde/comments/4vwmib/you_may_get_posts_like_this_often_but_i_have_to/). It was horribly written and kinda cringey, but cute nonetheless. Anyways, the **SUPER FUN PART OF THIS STORY** is that a Lorde fanpage posted my ode to their Twitter... and then [Lorde herself liked it](http://imgur.com/m1Enmfy). That was pretty cool, the artist that changed my world liking the post I wrote for it the same day. Needless to say, I stanned. Melodrama wasn't the same to me. I understand why people like it more, but something just wasnt there. Ribs and Pure Heroine as a whole felt like the angsty teen anthems we needed but wouldn't say because we aren't *that* angsty. No matter what Lorde does in the future, she ALWAYS has Ribs, a song that will remain anthemic for angsty teens for generations.

Therokinrolla: # I done TOLD you there was a lot of comments

**ZankeeZero** (10): I REALLY don't want this to win because that'd be super predictable but I can't give this less than a 10. Ii'l just

**notdallin** (9.9): am I salty that Lorde bested Lana Del Rey in the alt-pop rate? Yes. But that does not mean I can’t recognize taste where taste is present. The kaleidoscopic production is what elevates Ribs to legendary status. The lyrics are juvenile in the same endearing way that all of Pure Heroine is but the way that Lorde talks about how scary it is getting old resonates across ages. And not even laughing until our ribs get sore is enough to stop the ride.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9.5): mm

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9.5): This song is kind of an outlier on Pure Heroine in having more of a quicker tempo, dance-pop feel while keeping the minimal synth+drum machine sound of the album. In some ways, it's kind of a preview of her future evolution, but it has no Jack Antonoff so that makes it much better.

**shipsinker44** (9): i LOVE this song

**tapdancingpig** (9): I forgot how much I loved this song. I love the verse and chorus having the same lyrics especially, that’s such a fun trick.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): a whole A E S T H E T I C. So good and the vibe it gives :comfy:

**JohnnyBAverage** (8.9): now this is a surprising score because i absolutely love lorde. But yeah, this didn’t do it for me this time even though in the past I’ve really related. Maybe I’ve just gotten older. But even acknowledging that aginging within this song brings a sort of pain and anoime(sp?), so i guess she deserves more. Re-read this comment sober, I’m giving it a higher score because she does deserve more.

**aulyve** (8.5): Joel Little to Jack Antonoff is such a downgrade.

**FireLordAegon** (8.5): Oh my Lorde! THE EMOTIONS!

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I'd like to apologize for a dumb thing I said in the Discord back when I was fifteen and edgy. I said I didn't relate to Pure Heroine, in particular Ribs, because I disagreed with the line 'It feels so scary getting old'. Well, guess what? It's been one and a half years, and, haha! I'm scared! Help me. I don't want to adult. I still have a hard time preferring the minimalistic production of Lorde's debut over Jack Antonoff's iconic work on Melodrama, but hearing Ribs wants me to go back to the album and give it another chance. A borderline synthpop track, Ribs exemplifies the themes of Pure Heroine better than almost any other track off the album, speeding up into a then-surprisingly fast tempo for Lorde in order to perfectly give you a glance at the bittersweet insecurity you start to experience in your mid adolescence. I still don't think it's the best song in the world, but now I can see why so many members adore it.

Therokinrolla: # SO MANY
**amumumyspiritanimal** (11): ughhhh this should be A World Alone but this is still one of the best written songs ever, and is overall amazing. I had to give this my 11, because any other song I'd feel guilty about but Ribs is really that bitch, and I basically grew up with it.

**bespectacIed** (11): I actually felt bad passing off the legends and icons in this rate to give this girl my 11, but giving anything lower than this for this song is a disservice to myself

**CarlieScion** (11): THE song of my adolescence

**CopyCatJ** (11): I don't wanna grow up.

**didney-worl** (11): hit me like a freight train oml

**dramiaa** (11): Overrated

**followingfreeways** (11): lorde was around 19 when this came out, I am 19 now, and I understand completely where she was coming from, this song is really important and makes me feel a lot of things. sometimes I feel like I am in a really weird space in life and this song kind of captures that. She is so talented.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Anyone that gives this less than 2, especially /u/gannade & /u/napsandnetflix, are clearly repressing their traumatic childhoods and this song brings up negative flashbacks and I think they all need help going through this.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): this song is just so special to me. I first heard it when I was 16, and it just connected with me in a way no other song had, and it helped me realise that it's ok to be afraid of getting older, even though at the time i felt like I was the only person who wasn't excited to finish school and be an "adult". It's entracing, magical and nostalgic, and it's the reason I stan Lorde

**Raykel** (11):  

**rotating3Dtext** (11): my eleven cause I didn’t get to rate it the first time around… this song means a lot to me. It marked the start of a new stage of my life and now I’m going to see Lorde live, in a moment where I feel like my life is changing again. And with ‘the only friend I need’, who introduced me to Lorde and might be reading this (hi).

**theburningundead** (11): I don’t think I could ever get sick of this song, the way the intro dances around from ear to ear and then how the intensity of the instrumental slowly builds over the course of the track. I feel like I can get lost in it, the use of repetition is executed so perfectly and really drives home the inescapable passing of time and trying to come to terms with it. I have seen someone describe it as “drenched in nostalgia” and I don’t think I could describe it any better, it takes a special kind of song to makes me nostalgic for memories I don’t even have. There are plenty of songs that tackle the topic of growing up but very few capture it as well as Ribs. It feels honest, personal and there honestly isn’t a single part I could fault. “I’ve never felt more alone, it feels so scary getting old” is one of my favourite lines in any song ever, and even if I can’t always look back on memories of the past fondly that sentiment is something I can certainly relate to.

**welcometoNY** (11): this song means everything to me. it puts into words everything that i've felt in high school in a way that no other song has been able to capture, all against a gorgeous sonic backdrop. the climax is one of my favorite musical moments ever.

**1998tweety** (10): Lorde is a lyrical genius for sure. This song captures nostalgia perfectly and while the lyrics are the definite highlight of this song the production very much adds to the song as well. It fades in and out at the perfect times. Like with most songs in this rate, the bridge is amazing and brings the song to a new level.

**animefangrant62** (10): this song makes me so nostalgiac, I still remember listening to it and buzzcut season on repeat while playing a rally video game

**camerinian** (10): For as cold and detached as the singles from Pure Heroine seemed to be, it’s the genuine moments of warmth that really make it a classic, and this is perhaps the strongest evidence of that. Lorde’s verse delivery just feels like getting a big hug - it’s intimate, it’s maybe a bit low-key, but it’s filled with so much genuine upbeat passion, and then the build up to that final verse and outro is so fucking brilliantly paced. What a beautiful track

**cyborglilith** (10): this will slumber party

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): This is one of the most ethereal songs I’ve ever heard. It’s very heartbreaking.

**Dracyoshi** (10): Ribs is a fantastic song about the fear of growing up. I especially love how the chorus is fast-paced; it really makes it the stress show. And that bridge... wow. It makes me want to cry.

**enecks** (10): This is a magical song. It's a vibe I will never get to relate to - that of a wistful, romantic teenage summer.
ttle kids

**J\_Toe** (10): not my favourite from Lorde (that would be Buzzcut Season or The Lourve) but I have to throw support to my fave here.

**lunasaflowers** (10): This really is THAT song, and it only speaks to me more and more at the stage of my life I'm at. This song is atmospheric and just an absolute gem.

**mamas\_spaghettini** (10): you wont find a 10 like this on melodrama

**mudkip1** (10): /u/gannade is a fag

**nooodisaster** (10): When I say Lorde's mind is so powerful, I literally mean how the hell did she, at 16 years of age, come up with this masterpiece of a song. The slow verses repeated back in a hurried burst of anxiety, and holy SHIT that bridge. I respect any pop song that climaxes during its bridge, and they're usually some of my all time favorite songs (i.e. XO, All Too Well, etc.).

**ReallyCreative** (10): I love how she builds things up just to let them release, I don't think this song is slept on in this sub but I do think the GP is unaware of just how good it is

**strawberryswing1** (10): I can't wait for this to only make Day 2 when all the "Lorde is overrated by the sub" people jump out.

**Tedyonce** (10): This song is a masterful cut

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): play it louder for the kids in the back

**TragicKingdom1** (10): eternal mood

**twat\_brained** (10): I must have heard this song at least 100 times, and it brightens my day up almost every single time. Every time I try to listen to the lyrics, though, I feel like I'm missing something; there are people here who cry to this song but I just chalk it up to Ella being nostalgic for when she was a tween, putt-putting around NZ with her pals. Is there more to it than that?

**VodkaInsipido** (10): lorde is my god

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I really like this song and the synth ‘ahhs’ in the production but I feel like it’s not as profound as this sub makes it to be. Sure growing up can be scary and heartbreaking but this song doesn’t do it fully for me.

**jamesfog** (8): Lana deserved to win with one of her many better songs. (Editor's Note: Tea!)

**Roxieloxie** (8): this is one of those 3am depression songs

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): queeeen

# I want to break Lorde's ribs

**yatcho** (7.8): She has better

**Shadow1087** (7): a little too quiet for my taste but amazing otherwise

**warmishblood** (6.5): I know everyone loves it, but its one of my least favourites on Pure Heroine

**original\_doll** (6): being about the same age as Lorde and I get what she means by it, like the change from adolescence to 'adulthood', but I find it sort of cringe to hear her at like 16 singing about "getting old" lol

**radiofan15** (5.8): I really never got into Lorde until Melodrama, and just like Beyoncé (who I never appreciated outside of her singles before her self-titled) I never really cared about her earlier material that much... listening to Ribs for the first time makes me realize I took a good decision... Ribs is tighly constructed and the instrumental is nice but I mostly forgot about it as soon as it ended, as the lyrics and beat are so repetitive it distracted me from everything that might have made the song more engaging to me.

**NuneEtsuko** (4): Boring af, sorry!

**SpanKKy1** (4): everything on melodrama is better than this

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): the bleach you spilled all over me

**mysario** (2.8): panda said he'd sit on me if I gave this any higher

**MrSwearword** (2): not worth a second listen so long after the rate.

**gannade** (0): If I have to hear one more underaged twink talk about how much of a lyrical genius lorde is while simulataneously complaining about how tough their life is from their freshman year of college...

>What is there to say about “Oops!...I Did It Again"" which hasn't already been stated/overstated over the course of its 18+ year existence? If you ask me, it is not only pop perfection, but it is perhaps my favorite Britney Spears song of all time, largely because it contains my favorite Britney Spears music video costume of all time, the shiny, bright red catsuit combined with a set of extensions which made for great hairography. Not only that, but it has one of the easiest choreographies to mimic as well, which is another reason why I’m so drawn to the video.
>
>As for the song itself, whereas others may see it as Max Martin literally copy pasting “…Baby One More Time"" and changing keys on it, I see it as “it ain't broke, so don’t fix it”. Aside from that Titanic shoutout, that’s pretty much what Max and Britney did.
>
>With “Oops!”, Britney not only proved she could seamlessly transition from one era to the next; she proved she was more than a one-era wonder; she'd be here to stay. This is proven not just by “Oops!” winning the rate; it is the 5th-highest rated song on Popheads, out of literally thousands. It's my proudest 11 I've ever given - /u/twat_brained

---

**letsallpoo** (10): I'm kind of gagged that this song made is so far. I kept waiting for this song to fall but somehow it never did. I guess that's just the power of our favorite catatonic pop girl Britney Spears and her inoffensive and iconic bops! But honestly though, this song is amazing. I gave it a 9 in its original rate and I must atone for my sins. Yes, it's a bit of a BOMT rehash (and the title kind of alludes to that quality) but it's still pop perfection. It's catchy, sassy, and has honest-to-god the weirdest bridge in this entire rate, but it still works somehow. This is honestly better than Toxic, don't @ me.

---

#Britney always wins

**twat\_brained** (11): I already have a big assay for this song, so allI will say is this: Godney bless Max Martin and his deft musical touch. And @ knee stans, y'all should do what Swifties can't and channel all your 11s into this song; it **does** boast the 4th-highest all-time average, after all.😘

**1998tweety** (10): Mega bop. I love the triple chorus at the end though.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): Goood it's so hard not to give this 11 this rate is really difficult tbh

**CarlieScion** (10): pop perfection

**FireLordAegon** (10): This is like ...Baby One More Time but somehow better.

**JohnnyBAverage** (10): duh have you guys heard this song? That Titanic reference? Icon. As a child I used to think the chorus was "Oops I did it again, I played with your heart Got lost at the baseball field (idk either) oh baby baby Oops you think I'm in love that i'm sent from a Dove I'm not that PICKLE PEN" And you know this story is true because that's honestly not even a good bit c'mon three year old me

**MrSwearword** (10): this fucking slays

**mysario** (10): I relate to Britney

**original\_doll** (10): iconic for a reason tbh!

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): She's not! That! Innocent! A lock for a rate winner if there ever was one, Oops can be perhaps described as the defining song of Y2K, carrying the glittery atmosphere that a certain Japanese indie pop artist would later emulate and sealing its status as a period piece off with the spoken bridge featuring a Titanic reference everybody knows and loves. There's no reason why it shouldn't be ridiculously dated, but Britney somehow manages to avoid that by giving us pure pop joy courtesy of Max Martin's legendary production. With all due respect to Toxic stans, I have to argue that this is the best song Britney ever recorded; in fact, for all the questionable music teen pop may have produced, this might just very well be the best it ever had to offer. Also, bonus points for featuring her actually singing!

**PuggleMaster** (10): a classic that i'm sure will make day 3

**radiofan15** (10): A Y2K CLASSIC. That "Titanic" bridge never fails to make me smile.

**ReallyCreative** (10): This song is everything and more, the fucking break in the middle for the dude to give her the titanic necklace gets me every single time, we truly didn't deserve Britney, this song is a gift

**shipsinker44** (10): iconic, legendary, vocalist, i will never be over her

**SpanKKy1** (10): when you get blackout drunk and message your ex

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): http://www.capncrunch.com/assets/img/products/three-quarter/oops-all-berries.png

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): iconic tbh

**bespectacIed** (9.5): I CO NIC. Invented lycra suits and spoken skits before the final chorus

**ExtraEater** (9.5): as a midwesterner i much prefer 'ope!... alrighty then'

**HoodooMooJuice** (9.5): I haven't heard this song in a while and the production is better than i remembered. I haven't heard a lot from Britney, but this is really good! The talking bit kind of ruins the flow of the song though.

**teenage\_meme** (9.5): would be a 10 if not for the spoken interlude. otherwise, it's perfect. quintessential britney and max. the production packs such a punch, her delivery is so on point, it's such a great opener to britney's second era. still pop and catchy as heck, but polished and edgy and a little SASSY! (what a family friend used to say when she really meant "sexy")

**frogaranaman** (9): http://alarmingpenguin.tumblr.com/post/173517714224

**ZankeeZero** (9): I really don't want this to win, but I can't really get myself to rig it. It's a great song.

**Bendariaku89** (8.7): i don’t think this is perfect, but it’s definitely iconic.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): It’s a good song and it’s a memorable part of Britney’s discography but it’s not one of my favourite songs from her as a whole.

**notdallin** (8.5): 18 years ago Britney Spears received the Titanic necklace from a boy who thought she was sent from above. She told him “Aw, ya shouldn’t have” because she knew he was destined for great things. That boy was Barack Obama <3

**Solovrinne** (8.5): Maybe not as good people think it is. It's not Toxic. But it's Britney bitch.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): This isn’t my favorite Britney song, but it’s iconic as fuck. Also the bridge chorus is the best thing ever. Thanks Max!

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.4): this is what incels think all women are like i love the 90s

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.3): invented nasa, fuck Elon musk

**camerinian** (8): I always kind of thought this was a bit too close to Baby One More Time for its own good, but I mean I’m not gonna come out here and shit on something that has become a pop classic

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I know y’all are gonna crucify me for not giving this a ten but I infinitely prefer "Toxic"

**dropthehammer11** (8): it's just a worse version of baby one more time but it still goes hard

**enecks** (8): As far as Brinty goes this is good... but her vocals suck

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Not as good as Baby One More Time

**J\_Toe** (8): wish ...Baby One More Time was here instead but I don't know the context of the rate

**MashLuke** (8): if all martians were like her, I'd be pansexual

**nooodisaster** (8): Stans these days throw around "iconic" if their fav sells 3% more than average. THIS is iconic. People still throw around "I'm not that innocent" to this day.

**yatcho** (8): Not Britney's best but iconic nonetheless

**stansymash** (7.6): you sure did britney! haha! i'm so funny!

**banananaise** (7.5): i want a titanic adaption where jack is a max martin type megaproducer and the titanic is an aging pop star's fading public relevancy

>Billie Jean is a song of impressive complexity. A carefully constructed instrumental track containing dozens of layers that work together effortlessly. A bass line that has stood the test of time, a synth riff that has enthralled for decades – and a vocal track that was, as legend tells, the end result of nearly a hundred re-recordings until the obsessive singer and producer-pair struck gold. Billie Jean is an extraordinary song. In a career of multitudes and superlatives, one song still stands above all others in the King of Pop’s discography. Its live performances were legendary, its ability to summon a crowd to a dance floor unmatched. A song for people to go mad to, to revel in the capacity that Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones had to create pop perfection. And yet, what is this song about? A twisting tale of accusation, lies, adultery and mistakes. A narrator who feels trapped by a woman who stalks him, who denies with passion that he got a girl pregnant but by all means seems to insinuate that he did this very thing – he did ‘dance on the floor in the round’ with her – and the words that would serve as a warning to the singer himself: “Be careful what you do, because the lie becomes the truth.” Throughout his music, as much as it could be celebratory, extatic and optimistic, one theme seems to be central to Michael Jackson's message: that of fear, and distrust. A Michael Jackson album is a bi-polar rollercoaster that takes the listener from bright, magical and Disney-esque realms to a world of deceit, paranoia, and anger. On the same album Michael could sound like a choir boy in love and like a tormented prophet raging against a storm – hell, even in the same song he would find a way to rapidly switch between hope and despair. And yet it seems from a mind so haunted, as very often is the case in art, comes a creation so flawless. The drive and ambition to create Thriller, and the songs it contains, proved to be the most succesful masterstroke in the history of modern music, and created a legacy of millions and millions who still remember the first time they heard those familiar drum beats, tried to strike a pose, and glide backwards on the floor, only to shrug their shoulders and wonder: “How did he do it?!” - /u/Jelboo

---

**letsallpoo** (9): I could rack my brains to try to write something meaningful here but tbh just go read Jelboo's blurb.

---

# The One

**airylnovatech** (11): Momma always told me, be careful how you rate, don't go around breaking r/popheads hearts (Editor's Note: I thought this was a Daddy Lessons reference at first, shows my age)

**HoodooMooJuice** (11): This should have been sent to space

**mysario** (11): I didn't know what to give my 11 to in this rate at first since most every song is amazing, but this song stands above the rest. It's recognizable, it's funky, it's glorious - hell, it's timeless! MJ is, and will always be, the king of pop for a reason. Billie Jean is my liver, case dismissed, bring in the dancing lobsters! dancer dancer dancer

**SuperBatSpider** (11): MORE MJ SONGS, THEYRE ALL 11

**amacaroon** (10): There are very few songs iconic enough that I recognize it from the first beat. Everything about it is iconic: his outfit, the title ‘Billie Jean’, the entire performance (not just the moonwalk), even the depressing backstory behind the lyrics. I posted on askreddit a while back asking about what person’s name would be remembered the longest, most people responded with things like Gilgamesh or Jesus but like 3 or 4 people responded with ‘Billie Jean.’ I don’t agree, but it shows how iconic the song is. Plus, it’s a good song. The bizarre baseline, the snare kick, the paranoid singing, the gradual 5 minute crescendo you hardly even notice… everything fits so perfectly together. Also, fun fact: Michael Jackson wrote this song while driving on the street I live on.

**aulyve** (10): Me - Just remember to always think twice. My one remaining brain cell - (DON'T THINK TWICE) DON'T THINK TWICE (AWOO)

**camerinian** (10): Every single piece of this is iconic and timeless. The bassline, the sliny synth melody, the chorus, Michael’s falsetto, the lyrical content which is a rare still unique subject in pop music. Nothing here has aged a second and everything is still brilliant to listen through. It’s MJ at his peak

**CopyCatJ** (10): the kid is not my son, Drake wishes.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): such a FUCKING classic, the part where his voice goes like ~~~~ wavy in the pre chorus > literally anything

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Invented modern pop music! But seriously, this is a classic and the bass line is iconic.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Most iconic pop song of the 80's, almost objectively.

**J\_Toe** (10): what rate was this a part of and how come Thriller didn't win? Thriller deserves a twelve!

**MrSwearword** (10): MICHAEL JACKSON'S BEST SONG. THIS IS NOT UP FOR DISCUSSION

**nooodisaster** (10): Y'ALL ACTUALLY HAD TASTE ON THIS ONE!!

**notdallin** (10): Everything you could want in a fantastic pop song: a compelling story, unreal vocals, yelps, and falsetto, slick synths, bumping bassline, dramatic strings, and an instantly iconic dance popularized by it. It has earned its place in history and will continue to be beloved by popheads of every generation.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): Let's not only focus on the competition between Kylie and Britney here; Billie Jean and When Doves Cry also have parallels histories in terms of rate placements. While I'm stopping short of giving Billie Jean a perfect score like what I did with the latter song, I have to admit that both tracks are just as iconic as the other, and just as good, too. Billie Jean may get to me a little less than Prince's screams at the end of his entry, but as a song in itself, it's absolutely amazing, and it's one of those pop hits that even the most pretentious classic rock fan can't help but dance along to. It has one of the most famous backing synths of all time, and quite the unique story behind it; Michael's fictionalized and slightly exaggerated account of a persistent fan's insistence that he bore her child is a haunting ear worm, making you skip around the room you're in just like he does in the music video and making you a little disturbed when you listen closely to the lyrics. His voice is also an underrated element here, retaining the control it had back in his Motown days to make the stress here even more unnerving. It'll be an absolute shame if this doesn't score highly.

#[FLACCID]

**Leixander** (8): i will never understand why this song is beloved of all other songs in his discography, still good but you know...

**Roxieloxie** (9): why did i see billie jean and think i was rating smooth criminal.

**shipsinker44** (9): a good bop but its not his best song!!!

**Solovrinne** (8.5): It's dated, but it is oh so good.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): Although a great song, it's still really not my style. I would give it an 8 but that would be an offense to MJ and he does not deserve any.

**ReallyCreative** (8): Not the best MJ song, but it's still great and I love the sound

**VodkaInsipido** (8): little mix is better than this

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): I know this is *everyone’s* favorite MJ song but it’s not mine.

**ZankeeZero** (5): im sorry jelboo i hope ull forgive me

# [CLASSIC]

**itsabop** (10): #Classic

**lunasaflowers** (10): It's fucking MJ, it's a classic.

**mamas\_spaghettini** (10): a classic

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Classic

**frogaranaman** (10): Certified hood classic.

**Bendariaku89** (8.7): classy.

**FireLordAegon** (9): A classic bop to end all bops

>Bad Romance is one the most iconic songs of the 00s, going platinum almost everywhere and diamond in the US. It has an extremely catchy pre-chorus and hook that make it an instant earworm. - /u/pickupthephonebaby

---

**Therokinrolla** (11): Before she became "the rah rah bitch," Gaga was still a relative newcomer to the pop scene. Just one with four top 10s under her belt. Yet, even with the penis rumors and the infamous MTV Paparazzi performance, at this time she wasn't the enigmatic, strange performer we know today. Boys Boys Boys, a track from her debut album *The Fame*, was planned as the sixth single before her label decided to immediately push a song from the forthcoming record *The Fame Monster*, and for good reason.

Bad Romance was a stark departure from Gaga's previous few hits, which, while good examples of extremely well written pure pop bliss, were relatively simple. Inspired by techno and German club music, Bad Romance immediately displays Gaga's new artistic direction within the first ten seconds with the iconic Rah Rah hook and a stronger vocal performance than her previous hit. Every line is a new hook, no section lingers for too long before introducing another, and each lyric is well thought out an calculated, with emotion unfamiliar to her previous hits. I mean name a song that manages to be as weird and as emotional as Bad Romance, specifically that "I don't wanna be friends" from the bridge (the third part of the bridge, anyways, after the French part and the runway breakdown).

And it is now a huge part of pop culture. Billboard called it the best music video of all time, the song is widely heralded as a classic, and it is certified diamond. When I was about 10, even before i was a manic Gaga stan that knew how bisexual I was, I would freak the FUCK out when this song was on the radio, because it was weird, and I was weird, and it somehow felt like Gaga and I had this weird cute little thing together in the form of this phenomenal song.

---

#Want your Bad Romance

**1998tweety** (11): Wow everything about this song is incredible. The multiple layers of production throughout the entire song, the explosive chorus. The best part though is the bridge into the final chorus. There are like 3 different sections to this bridge and each just keep adding more and more. The last part with gaga belting "WANT YOUR BAD ROMANCE", with multiple layers of "bad romances" in the background is heavenly. Finally the song explodes into one last chorus.

**J\_Toe** (11): my favourite Gaga song is Telephone but this needed an 11 (the hardest thing about the rate was deciding whether Bad Romance, Toxic, or Can't Get You Out Of My Head deserved the 11)

**jamesfog** (11): Possibly the best pop song of all time.

**teenage\_meme** (11): i will never forget first hearing this song. it is startling. it is so magestic. it's untouchable. this song transcends pop, it's almost art. (oh my god artpop) the ultimate.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): For a while, this was the most played song on my iPod. I’d listen to it every day on my way home from school.

**nooodisaster** (10): Undoubtedly in the top 10 pop songs of the last decade and probably her first song musically that truly showed what a talent she was. The buildup to the last chorus with three layers all perfectly in sync, and then the emotional outburst of the last "I DON'T WANNA BE FRIENDS... WANT YOUR BAD ROMANCE!" A million homosexuals were born.

**NuneEtsuko** (10): Can't believe this is the only Gaga song here, her jams and particularly this one are on another level and for me define the perfect pop bops.

**radiofan15** (10): Back in the day Gaga slowly conquer me with Poker Face (i didn't care that much for Just Dance) and then LoveGame... by the time Bad Romance came in she conquer me, I feel into her trap and i'm glad I never recovered... also be sure to get A Star Is Born in DVD, Blu Ray and Digital Download as soon as it comes out.

**twat\_brained** (10): I will never forget November 27th, 2009, when I saw Lady Gaga on the opening night of the Monster Ball Tour, saw her deliver one of the concerts of her life, and cap it off with a sensational rendition of this, to uproarious and raucous applause from the audience. I knew I'd be a Monster for life since that night. #pawsup P.S. Are you a true pophead if you've never tried to do the choreography at least *once* to this song?

**welcometoNY** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before

**JohnnyBAverage** (9.5): as the only lady gaga song in the all time rate, it wouldn’t feel right doing anything under a 9. This song is the definition of iconic, i’d argue it is goddamn historic. Insert picture of Steffani Germonnata (I didn’t  go to school for fucking spelling) will never be Famous Facebook Page here

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): Gaga might have attracted attention from the public for songs like Just Dance and Poker Face, but all the hype and criticism surrounding her fully reached its peak with the release of Bad Romance, which is an absolute thriller of a song that proved she wasn't just a one-off curiosity. A massive improvement over her already stellar debut, the Fame, Bad Romance displays Gaga's love for drama and exaggeration for the first time, directing the spotlight solely on her. Unlike her singles from her previous era, Bad Romance isn't just a great dance pop track. It's a phenomenal work, perfecting the hook she explored previously and letting go of the dated electronic production off The Fame to make one of the best song's she's ever released up until today. With Gaga's vocals reaching god-tier level for the first time, an amazing video that went viral back in the day, and an iconic Superbowl performance that made it chart back up at #50 for one week in 2017, I find it hard to believe that this wasn't the song that cemented Gaga's legacy.

#Fad Romance
**camerinian** (8): ehhhhhhhhhhithinkthisisabitoverrateddont@me

**MrSwearword** (8): GAGA NOT GETTING MY 11? More likely than you think considering this is only the 25th greatest Gaga song to her name and that the hype is with the video and really...apart from being a great song, there's better songs to her name and you will all deal accordingly.

**Roxieloxie** (8): im not a gay man so i don't really care for lady gaga

**Tomoki** (7.5): This is one of those songs that when it came out I gobbled it up like the little gay bitch that I was (am). Now in retrospect, I think it’s pretty cheesy and it makes me cringe a little. Giving this a 7.5 for the memories alone, but if this song came out today I think I would score it less.

**bespectacIed** (7): this is not a bad score but anything less than a glowing praise and ass-kissing for her holiness is a hate crime in this white gay forum wew. Undeniably iconic music video and irrevocable pop landmark but the song is messily written and too self-possessed imo.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6): why do people never let the best songs on a given album win and give their 11s to singles

**selegend** (6): Dated but it still bops

Therokinrolla: **Dracyoshi** (10): A non-stop barrage of great hooks, perfectly danceable production, and personality. Peak Gaga.

**dropthehammer11** (10): i feel gay listening to this in the best way possible

**enecks** (10): Just an incredibly fully-formed career peak in quality.

**FireLordAegon** (10): You can even feel the emotion in the opening synths... that's insane! This is just a perfect, iconic song front to back.

**frogaranaman** (10): At every high school dance, the floor cleared out during this song so the gays could recreate the choreography and, honestly, THAT’S being an ally.

**gannade** (10): lowkey pokerface shouldve won

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of the best pop songs of this millennia so far! This actually made Gaga iconic.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Major motherfucking bop. Invented the gays.

**Leixander** (10): winner worthy, one of gaga's best and a modern classic

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): anyonE who gives this less than a 10 is straight

**mysario** (10): fun fact, this was the first music video on YouTube to be the most watched!


**RandomHypnotica** (10): probably gaga's defining hit, an absolutely stunning europop-esque hit that I can't help but love

**ReallyCreative** (10): This song and video are just so fucking weird and bizarre and I love it, even the product placement is campy as fuck

**shipsinker44** (10): forever iconic, one of her best, one of the best pop songs ever created, and another contender for my 11

**SpanKKy1** (10): I remember being 11 and closeted af believing I’m straight while having this on repeat and learning the choreo

**tapdancingpig** (10): That damn rah rah bitch.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): rara bitch

**letsallpoo** (10): This song was winning for the majority of the voting, and while it wasn't too surprising, it still gave me a minor existential crisis. This won our very first rate, and after 49 more of them, we couldn't find a song that we liked more? What was the point of all of that? Will we ever find music that we collectively enjoy just as much? And then it fell in the last 30 or so votes, coming in at a comfortable second place. If anything, I feel bad for "Into You". It got blocked by our two highest rated winners!

In case you don't know, this sub was basically made because of Carly. Legend goes that /u/kappyko, frustrated by the influx of Carly-centric posts on his beloved /r/indieheads, created this subreddit in response. It was partly a joke, but it gained some traction and has developed into the incoherent but enjoyable mess that it is today. I hosted our very first rate a few months into the creation of the sub, and to ensure success, I decided to include three of the biggest recent pop albums: *1989*, *Dangerous Woman*, and *Emotion*. While *Emotion* largely destroyed the other two albums, I do think that was a good matchup; those three artists are arguably the foundation for this subreddit. "Run Away With Me" is still our /r/popheads national anthem, and while it didn't quite win this time around, it's still beloved. I hope y'all are still supporting her and streaming "Party For One"!

Run away with me

# #NoMeme

**1313Harbor** (11): This song makes me so nostalgic, the video is perfect, I’m gonna cry.

**JohnnyBAverage** (11): obviously. Let’s all stand for the popheads national anthem. I’m not going to be able to write anything half as succinct as some of y’all will so I won’t try. But guys that saxophone???Do what is right popheads. Get Carly that #1

**nooodisaster** (11): If you rate this less than a 10, you're straight and that's that on that. And b/c I'm a whore, I'm gonna copy paste the review I wrote of this for my blog: "Now THIS is how you start an album. Four minutes into Emotion, and you've already listened to the best pop song of 2015. If anything, the placement hurts the album because nothing can live up to it. There's a sense of nostalgia, of epicness, of pure ecstasy that bleeds from the synths, saxes, and vocals of this track. This is the perfect maturation of Carly - still blissfully optimistic, but with a more complex understanding of just how special that is. Get ready for a treat, because songs like this barely come around once a year, let alone once an album."

**stansymash** (11): wow youre giving your 11 to run away with me stansymash. you must really be special stansymash. shut up whoever you are because this song is a noted bop for a reason. every melody is stellar, every lyric hits the spot, and the production is stellar. and i love to do the thing where i pretend i'm whipping something when the "pow" sound plays just before the chorus. i really enjoy doing that.

**tapdancingpig** (11): If this doesn’t win, I will riot. This is the perfect song to drive to, walk to, dance to, or even just live to. I know this song is kind of circlejerked, but that’s because it is that good. I’m gonna stop because I know that all of you gave this your 11 too.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): this is, objectively, a fantastic song

**aulyve** (10): Yeah.

**bespectacIed** (10): One of the best pop songs released ever. Pop perfection was coined because of this song.

**camerinian** (10): yeah its OK

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): That sax is everything. Without it this would be a seven or an eight

**Dracyoshi** (10): When someone asks you to link a song that perfectly encapsulates pop as a genre, this is it. Run Away With Me is pure pop perfection.

**enecks** (10): This song is actually as good as the circlejerk says it is. That's the nicest thing I can say about it. I didn't give it a 11 because I guarantee a bunch of people will give it a 0.

**frogaranaman** (10): https://redd.it/9bovyn

**gannade** (10): obligatory 10

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Man its hard to make a meme comment on this cause there's so many meme comments that hve already been made.

**itsabop** (10): #CarlysBest

**jamesfog** (10): Pop perfection and a song that perfectly epitomizes popheads. Would not be mad to see this win.

**lunasaflowers** (10): Just a lovely euphoric bop, enough said.

**mysario** (10): from the best album of 2015

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): deserves the circlejerk tbh

**notdallin** (10): everything about this song is iconic from the blaring saxophone to the carefree lyrics of jettisoning everyday life for the runaway unknown and finding her clyde’s lips in the streetlights. I loved it from the second I heard it. Every. Single. Minute.

**original\_doll** (10): hyped so much on popheads, but it's worth the hype. so damn good.

**radiofan15** (10): OK LISTEN UP YOU GAYS THIS WAS NEVER GOING TO BE A HIT THE "SAX" IS ICONIC AND THE CHORUS IS CATCHY BUT IRLY WAS MORE ACCESIBLE THAN RAWMe... and yeah, it hurts me too but most people i've showed them this song didn't like it as much as CTTF or IRLY, even my boyfriend through the chorus was anticlimatic, which is a shame because that really hurt me.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i don’t think i need to explain my score

**Re*TherallyCreative** (10): The opening is the bat-signal for homosexuals, this song is amazing from start to finish and there's nothing more to say

**rotating3Dtext** (10): seeing this live! was! amazing!

**Roxieloxie** (10): [popheads spamming CRJ until i finally admit i like her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i98qe-gPz3Y)

**SpanKKy1** (10): I wanna run away with tom holland to a secluded cottage in the forest where no one else can hear my banshee like wails during sex

**strawberryswing1** (10): 🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPM6FFD2eCk

*ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): If this song gets sabotaged to death by heathens, I'll be sad but that's kind of just a sign of this song's power. I have no criticisms of it, it's perfect from the saxophones to the way it makes you feel like you're taking a wonderful journey through song to the video so flawlessly capturing the song on screen. If I ever take my girlfriend on a world tour I'm blasting this on repeat until she can't stand it anymore.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): The meme...the myth...the legend. What can I say about the song that literally invented Popheads? I still remember coming across this song for a first time in 2015 when I was stumbling across a Buzzfeed article. Todd In The Shadows describes it as 'one of the best songs I've ever heard'. Is it just a little overhyped? Sure. It's a fantastic little song, no doubt, but there's nothing quite as groundbreaking here as Toxic or When Doves Cry. That's not what Run Away With Me tries to do, though; it's not meant to make another statement than 'Hey, I really like you. Let's run away together.' It's the modern, less commercially successful version of Heaven Is A Place on Earth, at least in that regard. It may not have received the amount of press it needed to, but Lorde was right; the reason why this song didn't even chart in the majority of the world is because we were all starting to feel depressed in 2015, a feeling that would get only worse as the years went by. Run Away With Me was never meant to succeed in this day and age, but it will succeed in terms of critical remembrance; in the meantime, we can all just have it to ourselves.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): ok this is epic

# I don't want no mediocre

**cyborglilith** (3): very mediocre

# At least its not a zero!

**MrSwearword** (1): hated it then, hate it now, fuck this song.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.8): I like to thank this song for the creation of this sub. Can’t believe Carly Rae Jepsen invented popheads! I love this song, but took off 0.5 though because sometimes the saxophone at the beginning can be grating and it determines whether I will listen to the song or not that day.

>Britney is one of pop's most recognizable faces, and it's hard to imagine that this song didn't have anything to do with that. The wonderous violins mixed with the sexy, breathy vocals couple for a pop song that lasts the test of time. Who doesn't love that hook? In my opinion, there isn't quite a song that deserved redemption like this one. - /u/dropthehammer11

**letsallpoo** (10): We started out this year with "Toxic" winning a rate, and we're nearing its close with the same outcome. This song's victory shouldn't be a huge surprise - we're a pop music forum, and this is one of the most iconic pop singles of all time. Even then, this wasn't winning until the last third of the votes came in (which basically meant the last day before the deadline, since everyone procrastinated). I can't deny that a part of me was sad to see "Run Away With Me" fall to second place; this subreddit's history is so intertwined with Carly that her victory would have felt more poetic. But even then, Britney has certainly had a lot of history with rates here. "Toxic" lost to "Can't Get You Out Of My Head" in its first rate, but then later won our first iteration of All Stars, where robbed songs competed in another chance at the crown. She also won a rate with "Slumber Party" along the way, then won a rate with "Oops! ...I Did It Again" later this year.

This brings her total victories to four, which officially puts her ahead of Kanye (thank God). Maybe now I can finally stop payolaing her into a rate every cycle. But regardless, 20 years after her debut, and after she's turned into an apathetic, minion-meme-loving mother of two, it's nice to see us still appreciate Britney's impact on pop music and recognize her incredible discography. "Toxic" is the definition of pop perfection - actually, no, just perfection in general. There is truly no song like it. Now @everyone, please go buy tickets to the Domination Vegas residency. She's flopping and has two kids to support.

# Did Toxic Slumber Party? Discuss

**aulyve** (11): Maybe the best pop song of the century so far.

**original\_doll** (11): iconic, classic pop perfection, nothing else needs to be said

**1998tweety** (10): Her most iconic mega bop.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): it's Toxic, what else there is to say

**Bendariaku89** (10): what can I say, i’m intoxicated by this song.

**camerinian** (10): This gets a 10 purely for the visceral joy/pain of trying to sing the bridge at karaoke. No other song does that to my poor little man voice and it’s great

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Why even bother pretending to give this any other rate?

**Dracyoshi** (10): wow a song about competitive gaming communities!

**dramiaa** (10): This isnt even real music

**dropthehammer11** (10): nothing 2 say other than perfect pop song

**frogaranaman** (10): https://twitter.com/mikedolan_vevo/status/1042327511143776256

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is the one song that can unite all pop music haters and lovers. This is the gold standard of pop songs. Unique and interesting production, catchy lyrics, and an iconic music video.

**J\_Toe** (10): this song will forever be a ten. I once saw it described as the one Britney song society caved in to liking because it's that irresistible and it's true!

**JohnnyBAverage** (10): maybe one of the only other contenders for my 11, again. Everything intelligent about this song has already been written, so don’t mind me while i slut drop to this electric violin that has ingrained itself in the mind of at least three generations Derrick Berry whoms’t’ve??? Dragometry undersold

**MashLuke** (10): gays may say this song is what made them stan, straight boys may have very different memories attached to this

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): I love Britney pt. 2

**MrSwearword** (10): BRITNEY'S BEST SONG. This is not up for discussion.

**mysario** (10): a top 3 song of the 00's

**notdallin** (10): from the rate write-up, am I correct in reading that this song is tHE ONLY ONE THAT HASN’T WON????? BETCH BY FAR THE BEST SONG IN THE RATE SO FAR

**NuneEtsuko** (10): Sounds as fresh and addictive as when it first came out.

**perfumevee** (10): Shout out to Cathy Dennis!

**radiofan15** (10): WE LOVE A CLASSIC GAY ANTHEM. Everyone and their mothers and grandmas knows this song and that's a fact.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): literally everything about this song is pop perfection and if you are scoring this less than a 9 you should be permabanned

**shipsinker44** (10): my most played britney song because im a basic bitch, its the song that brought me back into britney after a brief drought of not listening to her (fuck u/therokinrolla)

**Solovrinne** (10): Name a more iconic song. I'll wait!

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Probably the best Britney song

**tapdancingpig** (10): This isn’t my favorite Britney song, but it’s probably her best ever. This shows what she could do with her voice beyond having it get manipulated by auto tune.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Me @ persistent toxins such as PCBs, DDT, TBT, pesticides, furans, dioxins, phenols, and radioactive waste. Heavy metals are metallic chemical elements that have a relatively high density and are toxic or poisonous at low concentrations. Examples are mercury, lead, nickel, arsenic, and cadmium. Such toxins can accumulate in the tissues of many species of aquatic life in a process called bioaccumulation. They are also known to accumulate in benthic environments, such as estuaries and bay muds: a geological record of human activities of the last century. Chinese and Russian industrial pollution such as phenols and heavy metals in the Amur River have devastated fish stocks and damaged its estuary soil. ^^[77]

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): imagine not giving this a 10

**twat\_brained** (10): It's Britney, in her prime, working with Bloodshy, Avant and Cathy Dennis, in THEIR prime, without a music video directed by a not-yet-publicly racist Joseph Kahn. This could go out on day 1 for all I care; I'm just so thankful it won a rate and my day never fails to liven up when I hear Godney's magnum opus. There's literally nothing about this song I don't love.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): honestly? if you don't like this how are you human

**welcometoNY** (10): this came out 15 years ago and still sounds futuristic

**ZankeeZero** (10): Well

**stansymash** (9.7): id love to give this song a low score to give my 11 a better chance of victory. the issue is that this song is Toxic by Britney Spears and i have ears

**jamesfog** (9.5): One of the best pop songs of all times

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): There was one mainstream pop song critics universally acclaimed before Taylor, Carly and Ariana forced Pitchfork to start liking them, and that was Toxic. I'm sure somebody will prove me wrong and give it a low score, but I can't really find anybody that dislikes Toxic. Even the most vehement Britney hater I knew ended up giving it an 8 and admitting it was iconic. Perhaps what's best about it is that this isn't a song where Britney has to try and be something she's not, like somebody with a belting voice post-90s or a robotic hit machine. Here she is in her prime, using the sexy, breathy vocals that ended up becoming both a blessing and a curse over a Bollywood sample that results in the best thing Indians have given us since introducing civil disobedience (hi, Param). 'I need a hit, baby give me it' is also a call back line that only compares to 'My loneliness is killing me no more'. It's the closest Britney ever got to perfection, and it's no wonder it'll still be remembered after the end of the universe, as per Doctor Who.

**bespectacIed** (9): This is a great pop song but this sub overrates it so much almost to the point of me hating it

**FireLordAegon** (9): This song finally clicked for me a few weeks ago and now I see why everyone loves it.

**PuggleMaster** (9): I remember i used to scream this one when i was little (I'm surprised my mom didn't know i was gay then)

**ReallyCreative** (9): Might be a hot take, while this song is amazing, it's not Britney's best, and it might not be in my top 3 Britney songs. It's still amazing and a cultural phenomenon in its own right, but it's slightly overrated imo

**ExtraEater** (8.5): ...ketamine?

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Invented music videos.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): the sample/production is really good and it's obviously super catchy, but i do feel like it wears thin after a while

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): You can just play a 1 second clip of that string sample and basically anyone can immediately identify this song. It's a classic for a reason.

ThatParanoidPenguin: It’s so crazy it feels like yesterday the first time I stumbled upon rates - I believe my first rate was either Punk’s 2016 hip hop rate or Poo’s 2016 Ultimate Album Rate - both were incredibly messy and ruined my life. I’ve spent too much time obsessing over scores and comments and spamming refresh and it’s become a monthly ritual to do these.

Thank you Poo and Rokin for this wonderful rate, and also thank you for giving me the opportunity to give this legendary rate some fitting images. I hope you guys enjoyed them, and I hope you guys enjoyed the rate!

TragicKingdom1: i was working so sorry for the slight delay

first i'd just like to point out that bc toxic lost its 1st rate, no song in rate history has not lost at least once

secondly here is [this](https://pastebin.com/V13QEFjq), /u/JunkyGS gets his 6th and /u/rickikardashian was the only one to give Toxic an 11 for both victories

SinfulAnarchy: I agree, but keep in mind that this is a pop subreddit, so most people will be biased toward pop songs. Ofc, in a rate like this -- which contains "good" music across multiple genres -- it all comes down to subjective taste, and since it's popheads, most people will give higher scores toward the more contemporary, mainstream songs, and the alternative/rock/older songs are probably more controversial and therefore score lower.

Ofc, there are many people who find certain songs in this rate better than Toxic, and just because Toxic won this rate -- based on this sub's specific demographics -- doesn't mean that it's "better" than all the other songs.

deleted: So what you’re saying is that Bille Jean isn’t a pop song?
[/r/popheads/comments/a0a23j/the_popheads_winners_rate_day_3_rolling_in_the_10s/eagonj4/]

=====

SinfulAnarchy: Billie Jean placed 4th out of 50 songs, so it's not like it was heavily snubbed or anything; if anything, it confirms the fact that most people here are biased toward pop songs (understandably, i guess, since it's literally called popheads).
