Welcome everyone to the 2022 Anthemic Indie Pop Rate! 

Indie Pop as a whole thrived in 2022, but these four albums brought a cathartic, bombastic release to them that was perfect for going wild and screaming along to in the comfort of your own living room. You'll find all four albums share many songs about letting go to either happiness or the hope of eventual happiness. Not to say these albums didn't have their own quieter, intimate moments as well. But even then there's often a plea to them, asking the void where one's place is in the wider world.

But what is a rate without the albums themselves? Though as you could probably guess from the title and year this line up has 

**MUNA - MUNA** vs. **Maggie Rogers - Surrender** vs. **Florence + The Machine - Dance Fever** vs. **Mitski - Laurel Hell**

Hosting this rate is myself (u/TiltControls), and also the incredible u/BleepBloopMusicFan ! If you have any questions about the rate (or rates in general) feel free to send either of us a message!

All four artists here are no stranger to rates, but will someone new take the crown like Maggie or Florence? Or will we see someone pick up their second win like MUNA or Mitski? Only one way to decide and that's by sending your ballots!

## **What is a rate?**

If you're wondering what a rate is in short, it's a subreddit activity where we're given a list of songs with some common grouping. Then you'll score each one on a 1-10 scale based on how much you like the track. You get one 11 and one 0 per rate to use for your favourite and least favourite tracks (though not required to use!). Then at the end the ballots are compiled, the results are calculated, and there's a multi-day reveal going from the bottom to the top of the rankings. It's great fun and we usually run 2 a month! If you need more info, there's a great [intro video that can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ1SDlLZcpM). Otherwise the rules should outline how to submit!

You can find all [active rates here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-threads#wiki_rates) (though the upcoming section is a little empty right now since our selection process for the next 4 months is starting up! Keep an eye open for the voting form coming up soon!). If you want to keep up on any rate discussions join the Popheads discord! There's usually always something going on in the rates channel.

## **The Albums**



###**[MUNA - MUNA](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/28/Muna_2022_album.jpeg/220px-Muna_2022_album.jpeg)**

Let’s get sapphic!

Pop trio MUNA has been steadily gaining popularity in synth-fan circles since their debut in 2017.  You may have heard that they’ll be opening for a [certain inventor of indie music](https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1587420275959910402) later this summer!  With all three members identifying as queer, and their lyrics often focusing on love, lust, and heartbreak between women, the group have established themselves as a prominent fixture in the LGBTQ+ music scene. If you like the 80’s and you like the ladies, there’s a decent chance you’ll like MUNA.

MUNA made their debut in 2017 with About U, an album as catchy as it is painfully yearning. The standout single from that album, “I Know a Place”, is simultaneously joyful and heartbreaking, and its compelling crafting both musically and lyrically have led to it becoming a queer music essential (and a previous rate winner).  The group further fine-tuned their bop-making abilities on sophomore outing Saves the World, where they told said world to “Stan Yourself!” on lead single Number One Fan (a previous rate loser).  

The group’s self-titled 2022 album is not a huge stylistic shift for them, but it still very much has its own identity.  Compared to their previous two albums, MUNA is more joyful and self assured, highlighted by the fiercely catchy and confident “What I Want”, which is about MUNA getting exactly what they…well yeah.  The trio is often lovestruck on the album, most notably on the anthemic “Silk Chiffon” which, with the help of a feature from fellow-Swift adjacent artist Phoebe Bridgers, became their most successful song to date. However, MUNA still has its moments of sadness and self-doubt, such as on the driving, semi-regretful “Home by Now,” and the trio continue their quest to prove that synths can complement any emotion.

Will MUNA’s recent success convince popheads to give them what they want? Or will the raters decide to tell them “anything but you”?

###[**Maggie Rogers - Surrender**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/Surrender_album_cover.jpg/220px-Surrender_album_cover.jpg)

Maggie Rogers first hit the scene in early 2016 with a viral video of Pharrell listening to one of her in-progress tracks, Alaska. His high praise brought in people's attention to the previously unknown NYU student who soon after released an EP, *Now That The Light Is Fading*. The EP was a relative hit and Maggie set to work on her debut album *Heard It In A Past Life*. A stellar 2019 indie pop album that unfortunately already lost out in its own rate against Sigrid. As she finished her first major tour in early 2020, she quickly began to work on her follow-up album. However with the pandemic starting, those plans would be delayed for a couple more years.

She had her first (albeit minor) Billboard hit on a collaboration with Phoebe Bridgers covering Iris by The Goo Goo Dolls. The song was only available for purchase for a single day, but it got enough traction to earn her first appearance on the hot 100. She started her graduate program in 2021 at Harvard Divinity School, later earning her Masters in early 2022. But at this point, three years later, she was finally ready for her follow up. Produced primarily with Kid Harpoon (who was involved with Light On on her debut) they created 12 stellar tracks to fill out the album.

That's Where I Am became the first single off the album. Written as a positivity note to herself around the 2020 election, That's Where I Am brought a bit more grit to her sound and set a great first note for the direction the album would take. Also fun fact: the music video features David Byrne, who'll show up in the bonus for another artist in the rate! The second single, Want Want, went even further and went full 'anthem to sing in your kitchen at 2am' with an ultra-slick chorus and guitar line. The final single released right before the album was Horses, which was a bit more in line with what Maggie had brought to her debut album. With the album date fast approaching Maggie was ready to reshow her craft to the world with *Surrender*. The best word to describe the album is probably 'cathartic'. It's a fitting name for an album about surrendering yourself to the music and releasing your feelings to the world. It's a fantastic mix of catchy anthems and more intimate moments that make Maggie so well loved by her fans. She also had a few guest features on this journey, including Clairo, Claud, and (in a crossover event) Florence Welch on Shatter.

Unfortunately for Maggie, her album's release ended up being overshadowed by another [fantastic album released the same day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_%28Beyonc%C3%A9_album%29). Luckily for Maggie, we already got that album [rated a few months ago](https://redd.it/11vsbwr). Now that she's in the spotlight will Maggie be able to shatter her previous best placing?

###**[Florence + The Machine - Dance Fever](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/41/Florence_and_the_Machine_-_Dance_Fever.png/220px-Florence_and_the_Machine_-_Dance_Fever.png)**

Florence + The Machine likely needs no introduction. The indie pop band, helmed by lead vocalist and frontwoman Florence Welch, has been on the scene for nearly 15 years now. Releasing their first album *Lungs* in 2009, they've continued with a string of fantastic follow-ups leading to their 5th in 2022, Dance Fever. 

The title Dance Fever comes from the act of choreomania (also a song on the album!) which apparently was the equivalent of a psychologically induced flash mob dance session in the olden times. Historians don't know the exact cause of why people suddenly decided to break out into dance, but one leading theory was people finally broke under the oppressive weight of their lives and needed a release (which, honestly? I get it). Really all that you know though is that Dance Fever is about letting loose and freeing yourself to the music. Florence herself said that the album was inspired by the wild styles of Iggy Pop (who she also covered for a deluxe track with Search and Destroy). The album's aesthetics were also heavily based around the medieval era that the phenomenon occurred during.

The album's first single, King, recruited the subreddit's favourite producer ^(citation needed) Jack Antonoff to help make a bombastic beating anthem to start the era off. It was soon followed up with My Love, a track more geared toward dancing in the club instead of the kitchen. It was finally followed by Free, another Antonoff collaboration with a steady beat leading toward a cathartic release. A few weeks later the album saw its proper release to positive reviews. 
 As a surprise addition we are also rating Mermaids! Which came out only a few days ago on the Complete Edition of the album and acts as the 4th album single. If this rate was hosted any other month this cycle would've had this left in the dust to rating history.

Despite multiple albums and songs rated, Florence has yet to win a rate. Will her prayers be answered enough to get her that win?

###**[Mitski - Laurel Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mitski_-_Laurel_Hell.png)**

Did you know that Anthemic Indie Pop is a landlocked rate?

Not satisfied with establishing herself as an absolute force in the indie music scene, singer-songwriter Mitski has found a large crossover appeal with pop fans (as evidenced by her absolutely massive rate win with “Your Best American Girl” in 2020). Mitski’s talent for writing heartbreakingly personal and vivid lyrics have helped her build a large and devoted fanbase, who find both sadness and comfort in her meticulously crafted words and melodies (though probably more of the former).

Mitski released her debut album Lush in 2012, with her follow-up Retired from Sad, New Career in Business coming the next year. Neither album has a shortage of fans, but it was her landmark third album Bury Me at Makeout Creek in 2014 that established her as a rising superstar in indie music. The acclaim continued for her fourth album Puberty 2 (including the greatest honor known to womankind: a popheads rate win).

Mitski’s 2018 album Be the Cowboy launched her to even greater heights of popularity, expanding beyond the indie fan scene into …*horrified gasp* (kinda) mainstream popularity! Thanks to a certain zoomer dominated social media platform, “Washing Machine Heart,” “Nobody,” and “Me and My Husband” became three of her most popular songs. What do all these songs have in common? They showcase the poppier, synthier direction Mitski sometimes took on Be the Cowboy, in contrast to her previous guitar-heavy albums.

And if you were a fan of that direction… introducing Laurel Hell. Mitski’s 2022 album takes the occasional 80’s pop inspiration of Be the Cowboy and runs through a forest with it.  Mitski’s signature vivid and heartbreaking lyricism is still present, but on Laurel Hell those words are often contrasted with upbeat, synth-heavy instrumentals. This is best illustrated with the one-two punch of “The Only Heartbreaker” and “Love Me More” though more soft moments are still present on the album, including lead single “Working for the Knife.”  For many, this contrast worked wonders, with longtime fans and newcomers alike sadly shaking ass through the whole runtime.  However, not everyone was a fan of main pop girl Mitski, including some of her diehard fans who preferred her more traditionally indie rock material.  Will Mitski’s commitment to delivering bops deliver her another win on popheads or will our sub shun our name and kindly request that Mitski release Puberty 3?

- **You are allowed to give one song an 11 and one song a 0 for the entire main rate**. You are not required to use these. It is also highly recommended you leave comments for your 11 and 0. You cannot use your 11 or 0 in the separate bonus rate
- Speaking of comments, **comments are highly encouraged!** They aren't required but it adds flavour to the rate and helps give your thoughts on the track. Comments should be formatted by commenting after the song without adding anything else. For an example:
 - Want Want: 10  I want comments!
- Please do not format your comments any other way or it will break the rate machine
- You can also leave comments on albums by formatting them like the following (don't forget the colon after the album title)
 - Album: Dance Fever: The only cure for this fever is rating!
- Comments and scores attached to songs are not confidential and will be shown during the reveal along with your name.
- You are also free to change your comments or scores at any point before the due date! Message either of us (u/TiltControls or u/BleepBloopMusicFan)
- **Do not sabotage!** We reserve the right to ask you to resubmit your ballot or (in extreme cases) reject the ballot entirely if we think your scores feel off. 
 - If you're unsure, adding comments to songs/albums explaining your reasoning is usually enough to get it accepted.
