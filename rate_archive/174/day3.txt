**TiltControls** (9): And just barely making it into day 3 is the extra Mitski song! For the longest time it was actually Florence with the most tracks in day 3, but right near the end this and Choreomania ended up swapping days. Like Heat Lightning, I like the darker tone Mitski takes here compared to the rest of the album.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I won’t deny that the lyrics are really cutting (lol) and effective. It’s Mitski. However, to me this is just such an absolute SNOOZE sonically. I’d say it’s significantly more boring than the slow songs y’all tanked into Day 1, but I know that’s not a popular opinion. It’s our first song out of Day 3, but, thanks to a last minute boost from our final few ballots, it is a Day 3 song!

---

## Silently shouting

**Awkward\_King** (11): i didnt dislike this on release but i really didnt connect with it, over time though it grew and grew and i kept wanting to come back to it and now it's easily one of my favourite mitski songs. the melody is beautiful and i love how it hovers in between being a fast or a slow song. the lyrics are great and mitski at her peak lyricism which is always great to see!! idk i just rly love this song, i love mitski!! <333

**1998tweety** (10): now if that aint a vibe...

**akanewasright** (10): me after working one 9 hour shift at Buffalo Wild Wings:

**cremeebrulee** (10): bitch me too tf

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Me, happy the day this came out as Mitski’s comeback single before Only Heartbreaker dropped: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIjcUNQpgbs . anyway yeah, I kinda feel like this could have been a good central thesis of Laurel Hell, and a more honest depiction on (what seems to be) Mitski’s current ambivalence about her career and artistry. Hey Mitski maybe your next album should all be gothic country :3

**Frajer** (10): Fever Ray is her boss

**jman457** (10): she filmed this music video in my hometown so I have to stan3

**just\_thonking** (10): Me when I'm the sound engineer for a Swedish electronic music duo

**musical\_pyn** (10): I literally listened to this song for 45+ min straight when it first released I was that in love with it

**phonethephoenix** (10): a song that requires patience on my end but is so so worth it. she's so smart!

**plastichaxan** (10): “I cry at the start of every movie and that’s cause I wish I was making things too” Oversharing time but I’ve never felt a lyric so deep inside as a film student who has struggled a lot to do things in that sense due to many factors in their life and just aaaaaaa fuck why do you do this to me Mitski like thank you I feel seen but why

**ReallyCreative** (10): comrade behavior

**runaway3212** (10): Aren't we all

**Stryxen** (10): perfect. Real music for a blank stare at the ceiling

**nick1372** (9.6): This was just okay when it came out, but after each video of Mistki being harassed on tour and every tweet where she was overwhelmed by obnoxious stans it just became more and more depressing to listen to. :(( Mitski please take a break and don't let the obnoxious teenagers get to you.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this song ruined my Friday

**Roxieloxie** (9): lemme just say this is a current post grad mood and move on

**uberpigeon** (9): ok fever ray

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): what the production reminds me of https://imgur.com/6GMknEn

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): hahaha me (🥲)

**savemeaseat143** (8.8): extra points solely because "working for the knife" has become a part of my vocabulary

**afs** (8.5): release HER

**alexismateofan** (8): Hopefully the knife responds, baby!!!! KNIFE I JUST WANT YOU TO COME BACK HOME BABY.

**beeozan** (8): how much pay do i get for working for the dreijer siblings

**bogo** (8): what's wrong with working for the knife, mitski? you don't like synth pop? you got something against silent shout?

**homestarguy** (8): 30-year-olds rise up

**JIRACHI** (8): that's cute but have you ever considered working for the MONEY???

**Nagisoid** (8): Can't wait for Mitski's remix of Silent Shout!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): me at my job

**impla77** (7.6): existence is futile but i dont want to think about that :)

**camerinian** (7.5): can anyone crack this one I'm not really sure I get it, what's the Knife meant to be

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (7.5): she was trying really hard with this single. mid tier percussion that vamped as industrial (its not), an opening line that sounded spat out, and one key truth that she was "working for the knife" under big horns. lordy she sounded tired. remember when the twitter account came back with: "account run by management" and the video shot of her in a cowboy hat? It all felt so stilted.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): i’m working for the money but we’re all doing something right

**Poydoo** (7): it's good i guess, a bit too short

**scythersboots** (7): lyrically, vocally, fascinating. Musically kinda dull until about half way through.

**shesdoingyoga** (7): She does some interesting things with the melody

**welcome2thejam** (7): I know Silent Shout was a big deal but damn maybe they should lay off a little

## Cutting deep

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Her Karl Marx-ionnista era

**CrimsonROSET** (5): me when i keep my 9 to 5 to buy one of those sets of japanese knives that i know i wont sharpen

**shhhneak** (5): This doesn’t really go anywhere, kind of like working a 9-5 for the rest of your life.

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): this kinda snoozy mitski does nothing for me I fear

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): I'm sorry, this song just felt really bland and uninteresting to me. How was this the lead single?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yeah this one only got 15th place but it’s also the only song in the rate I’ve heard in a restaurant and I’ve heard it multiple times! So who’s the real winner here??

**TiltControls** (10): I really thought for the longest time that this would’ve been the top Maggie track, but here we are with it just barely even making it into day 3! Want Want is a pretty ugly title and weird hook, but damn it works. Maggie brings the full energy to the chorus with the rapid fire lines that make it so easy to bop along to.

---


## Want (x 1000)

**beeozan** (11): who loves being a tv? me. i appreciate the tv pov. really good vibes when i roleplay as a tv and survey peoples living rooms. ok its getting a little deranged now. something something lain

**cremeebrulee** (11): not only does this sound amazing (that dissonant piano!!) but the lyrics ate. somehow the gayest song in a rate with MUNA in it

**musical\_pyn** (11): either this or what I want will be my eleven and that will be a last minute decision

**1998tweety** (10): bop bop

**Awkward\_King** (10): music

**bigbigbee** (10): Heartbeats by The Knife but a lil bit cuter

**CrimsonROSET** (10): and people say tkyola never worked

**Frajer** (10): Rihanna when she sees the rude boy

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I feel like this has a chance of winning, so i’m willing to give it my 11 instead of Horses. Edit: you know what? fuck that, Silk Chiffon might end up taking the crown anyway. Edit 2: I feel like this has a chance of winning, so i’m willing to give it my 11 instead of Horses. Edit 3: I feel like I need to be true to myself and give my 11 to what I think it’s the best song on the rate and fuck the rate results.

**JIRACHI** (10): this is lowkey an ass shaking song in this essay i will

**shhhneak** (10): This is the song that screams “feral joy.” I love Maggie’s howling—my god is it purgative. Do you need a release? Do you want a release?

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the moment where she shakes her wig off in a sweaty karaoke bar the music video is the perfect summation of this rate

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): if my 10 leads to this song winning i’m about to kick the fuck off

**phonethephoenix** (9.8): this song is real and fun and catchy and good

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): Very easily the highlight of the album! I feel like this song is gonna win since everyone has hits out for everyone else and its not exactly what i would've expected but i can respect maggie for playing the quiet game and winning by virtue of everyone fighting everyone else

**bogo** (9): i'm not entirely convinced she's saying actual words on the chorus but it slays so

**kappyko** (9): IFYOUWANTWANTWHATYOIUWANTWANTTHENYOUWANTITTTTTT [COMPUTER SHARTING]

**Nagisoid** (9): MUNA you're over

**Poydoo** (9): I love the fuzzy guitars, but the hook sucks

**runaway3212** (9): She ended with this one too

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (8.6): the intro sounds like a jingle for a fast food joint but then she basically makes a really good landfill "non-US coded" indie pop cut; the kind with big yelps and cheerleader pom pom dance routines that makes me want to eat a hamburge-HAY! anyways this is white girl utopia coded music and it just casually rips

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): It’s giving giving

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): The chorus reminds me so much of Rihanna’s Rude Boy (specifically the pre-chorus). Pretty dope.

**slimboyfriend** (8): what an embarrassing name for song. I like it but I would never say the title out loud lmao

**jman457** (7.6): Solid song

**camerinian** (7.5): i kinda think the hook is a bit annoying which is a shame cos the sentiment really hits

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): i want want this song to not win

**impla77** (7.4): I feel like that this should hit harder for me but it just doesn’t.. I still like it but I want it to be more visceral

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): this is punchy so I get why it’s a popheads favorite. I like the hook too but this isn’t necessarily my favorite mode for maggie

**afs** (7): whos gonna say this was their tumblr caption

**welcome2thejam** (7): Hype chorus

## Y'all want her?

**ReallyCreative** (7): I loved this song on release but it has not aged too well

**alexismateofan** (6): The way when I first heard this song before listening to the album I thought it’d be my favorite track of the album. WELL.

**Stryxen** (6): the high pitched bg vocals in the intro send me a bit

**vayyiqra** (6): rawk

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I first heard this on my local alt-rock station and tbh I did not care for it

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): i fear this song is nowhere near horny enough… that sex must be so unfulfilling

**scythersboots** (4): I can’t unhear Ricky Martin’s “Shake Your Bon-Bon” (1999), a song my mother played repeatedly purely to irritate elementary school-aged me. I wonder if she realized how campy it was at the time ( pretty sure he wouldn’t come out for a while after this album but…did he have to?)

**flava** (2.5): if Surrender is to Maggie what Harry’s House is to Harry then this is her Music for a Sushi Restaurant

**nick1372** (1): What is going on here. Why does the instrumental sound so crunchy. Why is she spitting lyrics at me in the chorus what emotion is this supposed to convey??? What does "And when we're cheek to cheek / I feel it in my teeth" supposed to mean...

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): no more desires, I'm sick of desires

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Lyrically, I guess this is kinda the opposite of Surrender My Heart. But, thankfully, they’re both big time bangers and easy 10’s.

**TiltControls** (7.5): I’m a little surprised this track made it so far within the Mitski album. I think it’s solid, but there were a few others I thought would place over it. I like the choruses and verses fine enough, but it’s lacking a little bit of a punch that some of the other Mitski tracks have.

---

## Nice and cozy

**plastichaxan** (11): I love it it gives me that buzz… There’s something about this that makes me feel like I need to play it at full volume to listen to every detail while drowning my screaming of the lyrics and it just feels so cathartic in a way

**Awkward\_King** (10): i love the greek mythology imagery in this song and video, mitski sounds so etheral on this. suck it caroline polachek

**Frajer** (10): mother is mothering

**phonethephoenix** (10): sooo good. great concept! my fav line is "cause I could be your stoker."

**ReallyCreative** (10): i'm obsessed with the way it sounds like Sims music before her vocals come in

**Roxieloxie** (10): Over the past two years I've been wrestling with the concept of being 'too soft' My personality is nice and nurturing and thats how I want to be so I dont regret it but its been feeling like outside of that I dont have anything else. 'stay soft get eaten' feels less like a threat and more of a survivalist tool. and i really like exploring that with the 'sex god' metaphor of just trying to do anything and anything to please and to stay around and be needed by this person because it just feels like being nice means being remembered for something at least right? but sometimes thats even worse than just being alone. idk in conclusion

**runaway3212** (10): fuck it this is a 10 too

**akanewasright** (9.5): I’m not surprised that mitski can serve cunt, but I’m a little surprised she chose to do it here

**homestarguy** (9.5): Insert Twitter meme of “when a song sounds like :) but the lyrics are :(”

**afs** (9): not the song being the opposite of the title

**alexismateofan** (9): Harden you say?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): kinda like Nobody’s more mature older sister

**JIRACHI** (9): when he has erectile dysfunction 😞

**musical\_pyn** (9): I go absolutely FERAL for the second verse

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): wow this is groovy

**1998tweety** (8.5): my dick when i look at anime girls

**jman457** (8.5): good 80’s art pop throwback

**seanderlust** (8.5): me moisturizing

**uberpigeon** (8.5): my second boyfriend whenever we[this comment has been removed]

**savemeaseat143** (8.4): sounds good to my ears

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (8.2): chorus is weak until she gets to "HELL". but even the energy is strangely restrained across this workhorse, slyly arena ready cut. this has the same self-consciousness as an REM reveal track. hell, the emphasis back on keys and chambersynth mendings...a sketch of this would be a bandcamp cut from a decade prior; the kind of mitksi pop I'm happy to see flourish here in such a weird way.

**impla77** (8): anyway i’m not gonna say anything here for fear of tmi lol

**just\_thonking** (8): Me to the inside lining of a new sweatshirt

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): oh she’s awake here

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): ushy gushy

**CrimsonROSET** (7): soft and supple

**Nagisoid** (7): You just had to be there when her rabid fans heard the "I'm your sex god" line

**scythersboots** (7): fun, a great workout song

## Clotheslined

**Stryxen** (7): very good but not the best I wish toward the end there were more piano than just chords

**Poydoo** (6.8): meh

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): this is kinky erasure, what if I enjoy getting beaten up?

**bogo** (6): i am just going to smile and nod and refrain from making filthy jokes about the title of this song

**kappyko** (2): sorry but this is not a good chorus ?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): And Florence’s last deep cut has left the building! One thing about Florence, she’s gonna absolutely nail a song where the title is a woman’s name.  This song was Day 3 for the large majority of the rate and it’s not hard to see why.

**TiltControls** (9): If this song was just the first minute like some of the others on the album I wouldn’t have been surprised if it ended up on day 1 like Back in Town. However, unlike that song Cassandra actually picks up after this point. Florence does a fantastic job weaving the music together into a folktale telling of her own.

---

## Clairvoyants

**alexismateofan** (10): Absolutely haunting, very revenge focused, I love it.

**beeozan** (10): ok energy yeah! go machine go

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh this is where the witches are

**flava** (10): Those seemingly endless months of lockdown have long-ended now, but that collective sense of trauma still lingers throughout the world. A lot of people have lost the ability to see their own future, especially those with more future than average. And it makes it kind of an inspired choice for Florence to compare herself to a Cassandra who has lost her gift of prophecy, especially with how earlier in lockdown she likely lost her ability to sell people on “the future” with it becoming illegal to perform concerts

**impla77** (10): Any song that references Greek myth I am pretty much guaranteed to enjoy so this was an easy home run for me! Anyway, a few (not so) fun facts for you about the Greek myth referenced in this song (CW for lots of murder, rape): The titular Cassandra was one of the daughters of Priam, the king of Troy, with the gift of prophecy but cursed by Apollo to be always disbelieved after she rejected his advances. This made her family view her as ‘mad’ (ties back into earlier songs of Florence herself being patronised and undermimed due to being seen as ‘too sensitive’ to to her anxiety). As for almost all women in Greek myth, Cassandras story is not a happy one, being taken as a Agamemnon’s (the leader of the Greeks) slave, then being murdered by Agamemnon’s wife Clymtemnestra (as well as Agamemnon himself also being murdered by his wife due to him SACRIFICING THEIR DAUGHTER and also finding another man lol). Fortunately the cycle of murder doesn’t end there, bc then her other kids murder her! Anyway, Florence also references a couple of other things in the first verse, ‘they cut out my eyes’ being the fate of another seer, Phineas, also tormented by harpies to not allow him to eat anything. I don’t know much about this guy tbh, only that he was an asshole in Heroes of Olympus. Finally, they also ‘cut out my tongue’, something which happened to Philomela, raped by her sisters husband who cut out her tongue so she couldn’t tell her sister. Instead, she weaved the scene and showed her sister, who subsequently killed her son and served him to her husband. He chased the sisters and the gods all turned them into birds for some reason. Isn’t Greek myth fun?

**ReallyCreative** (10): there are just so many tracks that I feel like go under the radar in this rate that I just really need to do well and

**runaway3212** (10): A bop and a moment

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): For ages this was my favourite on the album. It didn’t shrink on me or anything, it just has some serious competition

**welcome2thejam** (10): Oh boy, this picks up on the third verse and goes to some fun places

**savemeaseat143** (9.8): thinking thoughts...

**1998tweety** (9.5): she ate

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Jenkins? Anyway, stream An Overview on Phenomenal Nature

**seanderlust** (9.5): banger!! it sounds so big and encompassing. the line "you can take your complaint straight to the lord" is a great one as well

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): best DA2 romance

**Poydoo** (9): nice one florence + the machine

**Stryxen** (9): she loves her some female names

**phonethephoenix** (8.9): kind of a classic florence song

**shhhneak** (8.8): me when I have vivid deja vu during the most mundane things.

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): my favorite greek mythology character exactly

**afs** (8): cassie c

**Nagisoid** (8): Indie pop songs titled after feminine names are always bangers it's a constant of the universe

**akanewasright** (7.8): oh I just know I’d be gagging if I heard this in middle school

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): i was prepared to give this a lower score but damn that buildup at the end

## Cursed

**jman457** (6.9): There is a sexyness here but wish there was more

**Awkward\_King** (6): cant spell cassandra without ASS AND

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): I once played Cassandra. This has nothing to do with the song, I just wanted y’all to know

**TiltControls** (11): I want to go back to when this was top 4 please. Anyways, though there were plenty of songs that could’ve easily taken my 11 - this was always going to be the one for me. It was probably my most played song in 2022 and hit me in a way that not too many songs do. I’ve been in the place of wondering if you’re making the right choice or throwing everything away stupidly in a relationship and it sucks. Even when you know it’s the right decision it rarely ever feels like it is. MUNA does a fantastic job encapsulating that in this song and I’m glad they were able to make it this far at least.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Throwback to the brief moment at ballot 23 when both of the host 11’s were in the top 5. We were so happy on that day…

---

## Homeward bound

**bigbigbee** (11): It was between this and Silk Chiffon but this one, with its classic MUNA sound, is what won out for me. Sounds like a warm summer evening

**impla77** (11): this makes me want to run down the street in the rain fr

**shhhneak** (11): I considered several songs for this score but they did what had to be done. Physically, mentally, spiritually and metaphorically, I will always remember and never recover, but I cannot blame them for this slay, I can only blame myself for living this shared experience.

**walkeddowntheblock** (11): They've nailed the sad banger

**akanewasright** (10): fuck

**cremeebrulee** (10): a breakup never sounded this good wtf

**JIRACHI** (10): i cry to this a lot tbh

**musical\_pyn** (10): that last chorus gets me everytime, I don’t know what it is

**ReallyCreative** (10): wow, another song about queer longing that makes me emotional, how original

**savemeaseat143** (10): why IS it so hot in LA, in late October? (global warming)

**seanderlust** (10): truly incredible synth track

**shesdoingyoga** (10): MUNA overall have some of my favorite songs lyrically in recent music and this song is one of the peak examples

**alexismateofan** (9): This song hits home to me because I too have been stuck in a maze.

**scythersboots** (9): i dismissed this song as kind of boring when this album first came out but for a nostalgic overanalyzer like me, this song speaks to my soul

**slimboyfriend** (9): yet another crying on the Dancefloor banger MUNA does so well

**static\_int\_husp** (9): "They can't see the bigger picture, so they get stuck in a loop. In the end, I was afraid that that's what you and I would do" yeah as someone who did decide to stay in a relationship to see if it can be fixed, this is pretty much exactly what's ended up happening and it's real fucking tragic.

**phonethephoenix** (8.9): a great question!!

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.3): ‘why is it so hot in L.A. in late October’ because I was there. hope this helps!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): me when my bus delays:

**Nagisoid** (8): Hell yeah, Home at Last by Steely Dan is a good ditty

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): harry's home by now

**jman457** (7.6): Nice driving synth but the chorus felt a bit underwhelming

**homestarguy** (7.5): Ana-MUNA-guchi

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (7.4): this is a very inspired reworking of u2's a sort of homecoming i think

**afs** (7): the loop thing literally happened to me in minecra- oh she's talking about something else

**welcome2thejam** (7): A little CHVRCHES in places... MVNA I suppose

## Don't shoot me down

**runaway3212** (6): I wish all boring songs on this album had this quality lyrics

**uberpigeon** (6): its cute ig

**vayyiqra** (6): this is definitely a synthpop song by MUNA

**Poydoo** (5.1): boring

**IIIHenryIII** (5): what the fuck is wrong with her voice? I’m not a fan of how she sings this

**Stryxen** (3): nothing burger with idgaf toppings and snooze sauce

**TiltControls** (10): Honestly? Better than the original by a mile. MUNA does an amazing job making a fantastic summer bop here. I just want to go to a beach party and listen to this 100x times. Though I’m a huge fan of key changes, I actually don’t know if it was really needed here. I think the original key worked amazingly well enough that they could’ve just stuck with it and hit gold.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I think this is a really great sounding cover overall. But yeah the key change part at the end is so jarring and does not sound good two points off for that. Also damn I guess Mitski is the only artist in the rate with nothing Britney-related. I wonder if that’s a good or bad sign?

---

## Burning up

bigbigbee (10): I might have given this my 11 if it had been in the main rate

Frajer (10): Muna, Britney, and Joel Kim Booster my beloveds

FreeCuddlesAnyone (10): and when i say this is better than the original...

Lilacly\_Adily (10): My favourite of the covers

PrimaryCrusaders (10): Yaasss get that Hulu coin girls!!!

ReallyCreative (10): Fire Island is an absolutely adorable movie and really scratched that gay rom com itch that a certain other movie could not!

seanderlust (10): mlm/wlw solidarity we love to see it

shhhneak (10): This cover is way too good for this blue checkmark gay movie.

slimboyfriend (10): somehow better than the original and imbued it with the queer energy Britney’s fans had always projected on to the song

TiltControls (10): Honestly? Better than the original by a mile. MUNA does an amazing job making a fantastic summer bop here. I just want to go to a beach party and listen to this 100x times. Though I’m a huge fan of key changes, I actually don’t know if it was really needed here. I think the original key worked amazingly well enough that they could’ve just stuck with it and hit gold.

alexismateofan (9): Controversially might be better than the original for me?

cremeebrulee (9): -1 for the key change

InSearchOfGoodPun (9): This is way better than the original and better than it has any right to be. Fun movie, too. Pride and Prejudice remakes are evergreen.

1998tweety (8.5): cute bop

BleepBloopMusicFan (8): I think this is a really great sounding cover overall. But yeah the key change part at the end is so jarring and does not sound good two points off for that. Also damn I guess Mitski is the only artist in the rate with nothing Britney-related. I wonder if that’s a good or bad sign?

phonethephoenix (8): so sweet! :') also movie song vibes for sure lol

afs (7.5): the damn key change

IIIHenryIII (7.5): this is actually quite a banger. I like it!

jman457 (7.4): Fire Island gays are annoying but this bopped so I will allow it.

## Burning it down

scythersboots (7): i love Muna but like…the treatment is too anthemic imo

Awkward\_King (6.5): bonus rate 11 and 0: fire island vs bros

flava (5): they really made Britney’s music gayer than it already was

plastichaxan (5): Another point this movie made for homophobia

WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine (5): rock on fire island

Nagisoid (4): “Sometimes” is the closest thing to a ballad My Bloody Valentine ever came to creating. The distorted guitars backed up by subdued percussion and rising organs create a dreamy, atmospheric sensation, complemented by Kevin Shields‘ softened lyrics. Also Britney Spears made a song with the same name and MUNA did a not-so-good cover of it.

welcome2thejam (3): Wish I could've seen myself get actively mad in real time as I slowly realized this was a cover

oscarbrierley1 (1): no just no

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I don’t have a lot to say here besides THAT BRIDGE AND FINAL CHORUS screaming crying throwing up etc.  I’m really glad this one got multiple 11’s because it really deserves it.

**TiltControls** (10): And back to back we have what would’ve been my second choice for an 11. Maggie pretty much encapsulates the ‘anthemic’ part of this rate on this song. Once the halfway mark hits it’s impossible for me not to want to just scream alongside Maggie here. Sad that both of my faves are just barely missing the top 10, but it’s strong competition in this rate for sure.

## Bermuda, Jamaica

**bogo** (11): OKAYYY SHE'S EATING HERE

**Lilacly\_Adily** (11): “All I've ever wanted is to make something fucking last” i love how she sings that line and I love the energy of this song.

**1998tweety** (10): the bridge on this song goes HARD. ARE YOU READY TO START????

**musical\_pyn** (10): that bridge is a TWELVE

**phonethephoenix** (10): this makes me wistful

**Poydoo** (10): Run Away With Me if it was half as good

**ReallyCreative** (10): catharticcc

**savemeaseat143** (10): I'm such a romantic

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Make something FUCKING last

**shhhneak** (10): This is my favourite song on the album and encapsulates everything I love about Surrender. The slow thumping build to a cathartic, feral confession of a bridge that can only be sung at the top of your lungs while you’re running for your life. I have a strange affinity for ‘road trip music,’ a loose genre of songs that sound like you’re in a convertible on some desert highway escaping it all.

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): is that a Morgan Wallen read?

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): I get serious Thoroughfare vibes from this song

**homestarguy** (9.5): Wow

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (9.4): this one has a bizarrely good ethereal piano line that a many bandcamp tapes could learn from. yeah its sorta sleepy but when Aggie Rogers tells me she'll go anywhere i fucken say so tru. her underlying bass beat rlly reinforces dat and she earns an f bomb (two actually, god DAMMN!) and that weird vocal shit and talking bout losing your mind in a hotel room. i've done that and it rules. and then it keeps going to heaven. great ditty

**CrimsonROSET** (9): bestie you had a song about this two songs ago and it was a lot superior. edit: nvm it got better

**nick1372** (9): Best bridge in this rate!!!

**welcome2thejam** (9): Wish it didn't lose a little steam after the hype of the drums kicking in, but damn does it make it up and then some

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.7): oh to be gay and in love

**jman457** (8.7): Euphoric bridge

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): she wants to go anywhere but names a hotel room first idk girl be a lil more crazy.. lets go to an abandoned industrial park

**afs** (8): i had picture in picture on and thought maggie hacked my laptop

**akanewasright** (8): okay I’ll give her this one a little

**Nagisoid** (8): Her saying "bro" followed by a bunch of random chopped up vocals cracks me up like what's the purpose

## Bros

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): forcing myself to lower some scores so that the whole album isnt 7s and above bc i dont ride for it like that but i can tell im gonna be pissed when songs go out and regret it......

**Stryxen** (6): cute

**impla77** (5): ‘that song I’m supposed to know by a fucking bro’ - popheads when listening to any song with male vocals

**runaway3212** (3): boringcore

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This song has some of my favorite lyrics on Laurel Hell. …Like your ex dating someone who looks exactly like you but just isn’t super emotionally unavailable and is much better for them overall? Oh it’s so fucking brutal. Also, god damn I love those piano hits! With this song making it into our top 10, I’m obviously not the only one.

**TiltControls** (8.5): A bit of an odd track from Mitski honestly, but it definitely grew on me since the first time that I listened to it. The odd instrumentation really helps the track stand out and Mitski does a fantastic job with her vocals and lyrics. (Still wish my other 2 faves beat it but I fully understand why it made it here)

---

## It's a me

**akanewasright** (11): idk she slayed harder than everyone else…

**alexismateofan** (10): I need everyone to understand that if this was any other rank, this would be my 11. This is what I’d consider one of my all time favorite songs. It’s PERFECTION.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpKc8N3FJsQ

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): remembering when this came out and people called this “Mario Kart music”, it’s like they’re musically illiterate and don’t know that synthpop was originally people being sad over upbeat synths. Listen to Depeche Mode and get over yourselves, kiddos!

**homestarguy** (10): Should’ve Been an 11

**musical\_pyn** (10): probably my favorite from this album, such a great sound and mitski's lyrics work surprisingly well

**nick1372** (10): Super cool instrumental that creates a feeling of movement that matches the lyrical sentiment perfectly.

**phonethephoenix** (10): another song that makes me go ahhhhh. love the pace and the instrumentation and the lyrics

**plastichaxan** (10): That little synth (? I don’t know anything about music idk what instrument it is) that gives ABBAcore scratches my brain so good

**Poydoo** (10): nice and funky

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this isn't mario kart core it's just an ABBA song

**ReallyCreative** (10): bop

**Roxieloxie** (10): this one is SO fun live * knock knock * * knock knock * I dont think I got this one at first outside of loving the production but then i became a #jealous bitch and was like Ah I Get It Now

**Stryxen** (10): oh if you know you know

**uberpigeon** (10): me when rate selection has been finalised and hosts are being contacted

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): it’s weird that Mitski’s better at being a popstar than a lot of actual popstars

**welcome2thejam** (10): Kinda reminded me of Hall & Oates' Maneater with the way they use the bassline. Excellent, definitely a much needed lively track

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): my friend got into mitski after years of me trying because she realised this sounds identical to maneater by hall & oates

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): this album should've been this song 10x over

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9.5): This one is very cool too! It's like a mix of "Lovecats" meets "Mr Blue Sky" meets the Inspector Gadget theme.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): I haven’t revisited this album much since it dropped because I just didn’t care for a good chunk of it but that means I haven’t given the attention I should to the songs that I actually do like and I regret it

**1998tweety** (9): me when someone asks about taylor's biggest hit

**beeozan** (9): where were u hiding the bells mitski im kinda having fun with them shouldve brought them out sooner

**Frajer** (9): in her Hall and Oates era

**savemeaseat143** (8.6): I love the chorus, it's so funky

**kappyko** (8.5): Tove Lo's "Suburbia" oh you're OVER

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (8.4): cornball shit. this album needed WAAAYYYYY more of intros like that. it's

**jman457** (8.3): This is Sesame Street music if it served

**afs** (8): PINAOA

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): this mario ass instrumental i can’t

**JIRACHI** (8): now why the instrumental lowkey giving 5 minutes craft...

**Nagisoid** (8): She was facing the Mario Kart music, selling out and cashing on the synthpop trend allegations, yet still served this bop 💋

**vayyiqra** (8): a jam

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this production is so anti mitski dk how to feel

**scythersboots** (7): its giving “Maneater” but sapped of most of its energy; I do like the lyrics tho

## Not for me

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): manifesting should’ve been us by tori kelly as the interlude since I don’t think we will be getting should’ve said no by she-who-must-not-be-named

**runaway3212** (6): Positive vibes? In my Mitski song??? It's more likely than you think

**camerinian** (5.5): I'm really trying to connect with the narrative of this song but the cornpoke cheesiness of this instrumental seriously overwhelms it

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): I have an irrational hatred for that incessant piano(?) stab. It sounds so cheesy like it’s from some cheesy 60s sitcom although I’ll give her credit for that “must be lonely loving someone trying to find their way out of a maze” lyric

**shhhneak** (3.8): She’s on that David Byrne shit again.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): yo i forgot about this song why were there TWO songs this rate cycle giving fucking Hall and Oates Maneater vibes lmfaoooooo. beyond that this song is annoying sorry

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): My god there was a point about a third of the way through submissions where the Maggie singles were absolutely languishing in Day 2 and I HATED to see it. Thankfully, both this and Want Want managed to climb back into Day 3 and this song into the Top 10. (Horses my beloved there was no rescue for you). Maggie is our first artist down to only one song, and it’s a deep cut! Huh. Whoda thought?

**TiltControls** (10): Though it’s probably only my 4th favourite track on the album I do think this was the perfect one to lead with. It’s a good evolution from her work on Heard It In A Past Life, while still being very familiar. It was hanging outside of the top 10 for a while, but I guess as Maggie says ‘It all works out in the end’

---

## GET OVER HERE!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): What a song!!!!!!! ANTHEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**kappyko** (11): It was the best song ever made

**memezaharamole** (11): makes me want to use words I don't quite understand the meaning of in order to describe this song and how much I love it. Visceral. Palatable emotion. The intermixture of production.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): she did a discord AMA when this song dropped and i asked her if the album was more yass or slay and she responded with slay. anyways this song is PROOF

**Awkward\_King** (10): god this is such an amazing song, i wish mitski wasnt in this rate so i could 11 it. when i think anthemic indie this is just the epitome of that. im using my one alotted "tk spilled" of the year right here but well and truly, tk spilled

**ignitethephoenix** (10): treat you better but for hipster indie women in NYC

**IIIHenryIII** (10): holy mother, the hook melody is insanely good

**jman457** (10): This is the perfect break up song

**just\_thonking** (10): She has never slayed so hard

**Lilacly\_Adily** (10): Maggie is all-in and I’m for it

**phonethephoenix** (10): she has a great voice!

**plastichaxan** (10): So anthemic, so indie, so pop

**runaway3212** (10): She had everybody gagged... then renaissance came but like she was a gay moment for 5 seconds

**shhhneak** (10): Barack Obama’s Stan card checked out once again.

**Stryxen** (10): the teasers for this sounded SO corny I was preparing to book a flight to ijbol island when this released but then it all made sense as a song and its so good…..

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): girl he's just not that into you... (I've been there though)

**1998tweety** (9): devoured

**camerinian** (9): crazy how a great performance can turn boring material on paper into something spectacular

**CrimsonROSET** (9): as someone who’s an absolute shut in 90% of the time the thought of someone being like ‘wherever you go i’ll be there’ is scary like is this what people expect out of me

**Frajer** (9): a pavlovian response when I remember her teasing the intro to this song for like a month

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): clingy girl anthem

**savemeaseat143** (9): romcom soundtrack vibes

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Sitting at my desk

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): stalker anthem

**afs** (8.5): david byrne is sabotaging the rate pt 1

**seanderlust** (8.5): Me finding my location on the mall directory

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (8.2): this one was sorta squeaky clean in a good way that ripped hard. made me go awooga. i dunno what this lady is on with her voice glitches or mini-sledgehammer drummer sound. but i love her and that IS where i am with this ditty!

**scythersboots** (8): love Maggie’s voice & use of multiple vocal layers in this one.

**alexismateofan** (7): Thank god she didn’t try to rhyme Boulder with anything.

**Nagisoid** (7): What IVE dropped on April 10, 2023:

## Restraining order

**Poydoo** (6): boringe

**welcome2thejam** (6): This one was a bit better beforehand, but a second straight second where a single moment carries it to a higher score (though I do also like the outro). Hold up she got David Byrne and the dude from The Walkmen in the MV?!

**RandomHypnotica** (4): i just don't like a lot of the production choices in this song

**nick1372** (2): Everything that Heard it in a Past Life got right about the combination of synthpop and folk rock goes so terribly wrong here. The vocal bits and sound effects scattered throughout the mix are so obnoxious and the hand clapping leading to piano riff in the pre-chorus tries so hard to be anthemic just to lead to a nothing of a hook. Oh my god I just realized this is structured like a pop drop song but doesn't even have a drop. It just builds to nothing. The chorus is so cliche'd and meaningless too. Some catchy melodies made me like this a bit at first but it gets worse and worse with every listen.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Well…this song was indeed the loser in this game. Will that be true for Mitski as an artist? Stay tuned to find out…

**TiltControls** (8): And suddenly we’re down to our final Mitski track! I find this a pretty good evolution from her earlier work, though for the synthy songs I think I prefer Love Me More a bit more. It sounds nice, but it’s lacking in a bit of substance some of the other Mitski tracks on the album have for me.

---

## Heartbroken

**afs** (11): NO DONT BE THE LOSER IN THIS GAME

**homestarguy** (11): SHEESH this song was even better than I remembered. The only slight is that it’s too short imo. That synth motif is pure musical gold.

**runaway3212** (11): YASSSSS

**vayyiqra** (11): remember the discourse about the singles on this album I think they are Fine in fact this one is Good it nailed the new wave vibe idc !

**alexismateofan** (10): if you see a light on in my bedroom and hear this song pumping out my window, no you didn’t and mind your business

**bogo** (10): need a 5 minute version of this song i want the climax to last even longer

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i went into the rate thinking this was the 11 and its still such a good track, the feeling of knowing something is your fault so wanting to put faults on others to justify yourself is so relatable but also rarely talked about

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): I HAVE TO SIGN ON AS A DEFENDER OF THIS SONG!!! That guitar solo, the synths… yeah Mitski’s done better but this is still really fucking great. The mv is bad though. See, I’m reasonable and not stan-brained.

**flava** (10): not many Mitski songs really work for me, mostly because her sense of introspectiveness can come across as too grating to be relatable, but this song, about just feeling like a failure in your relationships even when it isn’t always her thought hit a bit too close to home so…

**impla77** (10): I forgive you bc a bop was made

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): This is my favorite War on Drugs song

**JIRACHI** (10): OKAAYYY!!!

**jman457** (10): Pop star mitski is amazing to witness.

**Nagisoid** (10): I'm glad Mitski created The Only Heartbreaker, Led Zeppelin who?

**phonethephoenix** (10): catchy and good instrumentation and relatable?? okay

**RandomHypnotica** (10): haters eat shit this song FUCKS!!!

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song is indeed very basic but I think Mitski has earned the right to make a perfect basic pop song

**Roxieloxie** (10): I only listened to 2 pre singles before this album came out and this was one of them and oh boy what a time to hear this one. Im very anti painting mitski as 'sad uwu music to listen to when your crush rejects you' and painting her as this person who only creates music to die to because I feel like her music is so much more to that and people wont let it be anything outside of it! That being said this song dropped at a period where I was truly just going through the ringer of life, and it hasnt been until recently that I realized just how much of it i was carrying all by myself trying to unpack. I remember sitting on the rug in my dorm just replaying this because it truly felt like i was the common denominator in every situation going wrong, in my academic perfomance, in family stuff at home, in having a strained relationship with my closest friends it just really felt like I was the person ruining it all and this song just really expressed exactly what i wanted to go to the roof of my academic building and just scream out to the entire world but couldnt formulate into words

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I don’t know what it is with Mitski specifically but I find myself only really enjoying her poppier songs

**shhhneak** (10): This was made in a lab to be robbed and win songeniality.

**nick1372** (9.7): There's an alternate universe in which Mitski's team played up the Take on Me influence in this song and this became a top ten smash. That would've made her absolutely miserable, though, so it's for the best.

**1998tweety** (9): the bop

**akanewasright** (9): I get the complaints but also like… I’m so sorry she’s right, I will be the only heartbreaker

**camerinian** (9): Jesus it's nice when Mitski remembers that she's really good at writing hooks and climaxes

**IIIHenryIII** (9): the simplest is also the best

**Poydoo** (8.2): cool song

**ignitethephoenix** (8): she’s the bad guy chun li?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): This is the point where the album gets good. This one is pretty dope. Loving the washed out synth-rock vibes here. The instrumental bridge is so epic too.

**welcome2thejam** (8): I'm a heartbreaker... my name... Mitski.

## Heartbreakers

**Awkward\_King** (7): i love this lyrically. the situation of the other partner being perfect so you're constantly the one hurting them but you don't know how to stop. ultimately i really dont like this as much as the other synthier tracks on the album bc it feels a little generic to me, but at the end of the day im bopping so. i just hope stay soft and love me more outplace this :emotipray:

**uiscebeathaoir** (6): it’s competently made synthpop, but I just feel nothing listening to it

**Stryxen** (5): it's okay. I don't really get it. One of my least fav mitski songs but I love the noisy sped up part. The hook is really awkward.

**cremeebrulee** (2.6): this is such a nothing song to me im sorry

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): hoo boy. let me be brief! when i heard this during a Youtube premiere, the start of those extremely cheap-sounding synths filled me with such despair lmao. This song is so anonymous and derivative, and Mitski’s voice does not match the vibe at! all! Hate all the melodies used here, hate pretty much every moment of this which I’ve made clear. Yes this song somewhat broke me as a decade-long Mitski fan lmfao, it’s soured me a lot towards the Laurel Hell era and whether Mitski even wanted to do this album at all. The production sounds soooo cheap here, meanwhile Mitski has before complimented the immaculate production of the amazing Ringo Sheena - Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana??? And then turned this lazy song in as a final cut?? Truly the sound of phoning it in for me, sorry for the rant but yeah everything about this song makes me so mad lkslkdskl

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (0): irrational hate 0 to this auto pilot nonsense. like yes, if this were a cut by any other artist in this rate i don't think I'd be scoring it like this. It hits its marks, it not bad, just sorta there. yet with mitski in 2022, it has the same cadence that I felt with a couple of the 2019 Mac Demarco singles from Here Comes the Cowboy: a strong sense of "i don't wanna be here anymore". And it's not that I won't listen or consider that perspective, its that Mitski delivers it with the most "okay here's the chorus, here's the verse, here's the synths, and here's my giant im gonna go crazy dance outro! last verse lol". any resemblance of mitski's usual songwriting that possibly could give this a real affect is strikingly gone. some of the most bitter shit I've felt in recent modern pop. truly makes me go "okay then, why?" to this.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yeah from the beginning of the rate I never thought for a second this had an actual chance of winning, no matter how much people called it a frontrunner. There was just too much backlash for whatever reason. It did have a brief moment in the sun for ballots 15-17, but after that it never got back to first place. As for me, yeah I’m firmly in the “life’s so fun, life’s so fun” camp with this one. SIIIILK! CHIFFON!

**TiltControls** (9.5): And now we start cutting one of the big rate frontrunners! This song is just pure joy and fun. I get why some people may not love the track, but I am not one of those people. It’s hard for me not to hear this song and not imagine a perfectly sunny day when I listen to this. We had some anthems of sadness, but this is the most joyful anthem in the rate for sure.

## Wheels

**pheromenos** (11): joint slay: maximized

**phonethephoenix** (11): song of the summer three years in a row?? breezy and joyous and fun!

**slimboyfriend** (11): so euphorically lesbianic that it almost turned this overgrown twink straight

**akanewasright** (10): I have never felt more single than when I listen to this

**alexismateofan** (10): It came up on my cottagecore mix on spotify and this was my first time listening to MUNA and all I can say is GO OFF BITCH.

**bogo** (10): SILK! chiffon

**camerinian** (10): sorry haters i would have been on your side if we rated this a year ago but tragically the charm has worked its way into me and now i’m also very gay

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is for the fashion avenue lesbians of nyc

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): slightly embarrassing to admit that I’m having a wlw renaissance because of this song. Not because it’s a bad song (I gave it a 10 after all!), but because the wlw renaissance was inspired by a song and not like a… zest for life.

**flava** (10): pls do not tell anyone I did not give this a 0, I’m embarrassed that it grew on me

**jman457** (10): This will get an insane amount of 10’s and will win by just being not controversial

**Lilacly\_Adily** (10): there was a time where I actually didn’t get why every was so enamoured by this song. But I get it now.

**nick1372** (10): LET'S GO LESBIANS!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): life isn't really so fun but for 3 minutes and 27 seconds MUNA can make me believe it is

**ReallyCreative** (10): you really get a newfound appreciation for this song by getting high and going to CVS

**savemeaseat143** (10): it's a perfect song

**scythersboots** (10): I went into this rate thinking SI11K CH11FFON for sure but upon more scrutinous re-listens, I feel like Phoebe’s discomfort w a more pure pop sound comes through on this song…or maybe she’s just really selling the anxiety in the lyrics. Who knows! Still a bop.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Gay

**shhhneak** (10): If you go to 1:17 in the MV you can see the exact moment I started gatekeeping MUNA.

**uberpigeon** (10): lisbon!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Smart move by ratcom to approve the Boygenius rate, now those three are guaranteed to show up to the reveal and perform this

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): man, i wanted to be an anti of this song so bad and I was for a little bit but it keeps growing on me. I saw muna live since meet me @ the alter were opening for them and at the end they brought edith and the band out to sing with them and do phoebes part and the lighting in that room was so pink and the energy in that room was so queer and Sapphic that something in me just broke and I decided that I supported this song. I'll be a little :/ if/when it wins but I Get It

**Quiet-Tone13** (9.5): it's so fun, it's so fun

**cremeebrulee** (9): using the chorus of this as a litmus test for how i’m feeling… like 5 weeks ago i was listening to this song and started violently sobbing during the “life’s so fun” portion which is how i realized maybe i am not in the best state of mind rn

**Frajer** (9): Barbie after she realizes she's sapphic and dumps Ken

**IIIHenryIII** (9): sounds like something that came straight out of the early 2000s and that’s a compliment

**Poydoo** (9): Silk! chiffon

**Shay\_Min** (9): there's just something so fuckin freeing about that chorus

**static\_int\_husp** (9): y'all girls are so fuckin soft if I had known that earlier I would have came out as a lesbian much quicker

**1998tweety** (8.5): the girls are girling

**impla77** (8.5): phoebe bridgers! when did you get here??

**seanderlust** (8.5): music for a cute sapphic commercial for bupropion

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): “Life’s so fun life’s so fun” yeah ok ms. “jesus christ I’m so blue all the time, and that’s just how i feel. always have and i always will”

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): the happiest phoebe verse

**afs** (7.5): why did i just get an english translation for chiffon when i searched it up :sob:

**homestarguy** (7.5): The Weird Al parody “Grey Poupon” gonna do numbers among my weird friend group.

**Awkward\_King** (7): this song is so good i wish lesbians were real :(

## Heels

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The verses and build-up are so good but the chorus kinda falls flat. Also Phoebe Bridgers I do not care that you went to CVS

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): ‘life’s so fun, life’s so fun’ think of us depressed people MUNA!!

**Stryxen** (5): who the hell is siobhan

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (2.7): look, "rollerblades n' miniskirt" lyric is cornball bad. weird streamlined post-butt rock guitas, and the sort of TV-Y7 vibe of the whole thing is just a massive black hole of evil for me. this is sirius alt nation bait. just an insane blight on an otherwise chill album

**plastichaxan** (2.5): It does NOT feel good to me sorry

**runaway3212** (2.5): why they ever made this boring collab out of such a promising collab it's actually killing me

**vayyiqra** (2): I do not like this song much nor Phoebe sorry! I feel like I've heard many, many alt-pop songs like this before in my life and this is like a more annoying and boring take on them.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): I’ve never gotten the hype for this. Something about this feels very trite and annoying to me sorry. I hate the way they sing “Silk” in the chorus. And I swear I’m not anti-WLW, please stream [Me'shell Ndegeocello - Bitter!!!!!](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/meshell-ndegeocello-bitter/)

**Nagisoid** (0): I would joke about the Phoebe Bridgers verse being as stereotypical as possible if it wasn't actually written by a member of MUNA trying to do Phoebe LARP. It is extremely convincing which is the scary part, but the song itself is dystopian in the sense that it does not fit with the rest of the album and also increasingly becomes more unbearable as it advances until I just want to skip it. Life's not so fun!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): It took me a while to get this one. For a long time I liked it significantly less than the other two singles (Heaven is Here doesn’t count, let’s be serious).  The slow-burn aspect and the fact that it doesn’t have a super obvious hook definitely made it less immediate to me. But at some point, something really clicked. It’s an absolutely perfect introductory track for the album, with the build-up easing you into the sound of Dance Fever and then that big release giving you the first taste of the cathartic sound that the album excels at so much. Jack Antonoff made several points!

**TiltControls** (9.5): Florence does a fantastic job making this booming anthem to start off the album. I think it’s grown off me a little since hearing it (especially compared to its closest relative, Free), but it’s still a stellar track that does a fantastic job setting the stage for Dance Fever to knock it out of the park.

## Royalty

**1998tweety** (11): transmasc anthem, i ascend at the part when she starts yelling

**bookthieving** (11): idc what she says she's still mother

**nick1372** (11): There are songs in this rate that reflect something more personal or meaningful to me than King, which is just a song about Florence's midlife crisis. Yet this is my 11 because it's gorgeously perfect. Florence & Jack bring out the best in each other and their ability to switch between intimacy and bombast is never displayed better than this. In a "making of" video for this song Jack talks about how he compresses the drum sound so that it sounds less perfect but brings out the emotion inside of it and I feel it within my soul on every hit, from the moment this song begins to that crescendo before the scream. I love this song so much.

**alexismateofan** (10): Unfortunately, you will find me dancing to this on a Friday night.

**Awkward\_King** (10): 🧍

**bogo** (10): with this song and darjeeling in caprimami333 we're really just slowly doing a popheads user rate aren't we

**CrimsonROSET** (10): there are two wolves inside of you: one wants you to ping your bestie and perhaps call him slurs, the other wants to make a joke that might or might not be relating to a song by meghan trainor

**homestarguy** (10): Oh yeah Florence is back baby

**plastichaxan** (10): I forgot the way this makes me do the white woman dance Scarlett Johansson does in Marriage Story… unmatched

**Poydoo** (10): despite her claims, i have determined that she is in fact, mother

**runaway3212** (10): wow maybe she ended

**scythersboots** (10): her power ugh

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Queen of being King

**shhhneak** (10): This is BBC News. We’re interrupting our schedule for the following announcement. Buckingham Palace announces the coronation of a new King.

**Stryxen** (10): jesus christ OHHHHHHHHHHHH

**uberpigeon** (10): my second favourite british pophead

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): really tempted to make a joke about the “i’m no mother” line, but i already know there’s gonna be plenty of those

**camerinian** (9.5): god i love how Florence could have just ended this song halfway in but no if she knows anything it is when to fucking indulge the feeling

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Jack can make good music!!

**Frajer** (9): enby vibes

**IIIHenryIII** (9): slay moth-... slay que-... let me try again, slay King

**impla77** (9): Maybe this puts the mother rumours to rest

**JIRACHI** (9): she is no mother but she is MOTHER there's a huge difference between the two

**Lilacly\_Adily** (9): I remember when this first sing came on and I was so underwhelmed but it makes so much sense in the context of the album

**memezaharamole** (9): Ms Welch going into her deep croak is one of my favourite things on her tracks. This intro has everything I have loved about Florence - the vocals, the harps, the range, the lyrics, the symphonic peak.

**Nagisoid** (9): She mothered here even if she didn't want to

**savemeaseat143** (9): feminist manifesto

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I just know Lydia Tár listens to this on her morning jogs

**welcome2thejam** (9): Builds oh so wonderfully

**afs** (8.5): mother

**phonethephoenix** (8.3): the chorus took a minute to grow on me but it did! it really does work for what the song is going for. i like her noises lol

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (8): I like that bloody sword to swing part

**Roxieloxie** (8): Best song on the album, not my favorite in the rate but it won me over by being upbeat enough and by being a song about motherhood which is a genere i find myself liking right now

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): im not gonna tag him

**jman457** (7.4): Solid but not spectacular florence first single, cool breakdown midway through though

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): what if this King was awkward

**kappyko** (7): Okay fine but if this wins

## Revolt

**akanewasright** (6.5): I like the song in theory a lot more than I do in practice, like the build and the lyrics are cool but don’t really move me. there are many things that “Jack Antonoff producing Florence” could have sounded like and… imo this is one of the more predictable options

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (5.4): this was written for an AMV for that funny lil' King demon critter voiced by Alex Hirsch on the Owl House, right? anyways this cut feels like it was supposed to come out in 2016 and be a response to perfume genius' queen. its hard mid. truly textbook anthemic. if the lyrics were better it'd be a 6

**cremeebrulee** (5): awkward_king kinda deserved a better song than this

**beeozan** (4): tanked some points for the supposed catharsis moment that literally had anti build up. the machine should do power metal if they want to make moments like this work

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): the build-up to this was too long

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I really love Ethel, and this is a collab that makes all the sense in the world. However, there’s something about the sound of this that makes me like it just a little less than the original. But it’s still really, really good in my opinion.

**TiltControls** (9): I think I still prefer the original over the collab, but Ethel does a fantastic job going along with Florence here that I still really like the track. Hopefully on one of their next albums we get a proper collab.

## Say what you want

bogo (10): this is the closest we will ever come to rating preacher's daughter so i gotta make this score count

flava (10): I don’t normally use the word “mother” but I might be willing to make an exception here

impla77 (10): The art makes me think of that Doctor Who episode in Venice with the vampires. Scary shit

phonethephoenix (10): yes the live duet is lovely too!

ReallyCreative (10): mothers

savemeaseat143 (10): A great gift to this world

seanderlust (10): when you, a mother, come across another mother and you have a joint meeting to maximize your motherhood

shhhneak (10): this song would kill the population of colonial Massachusetts between 1692-1693.

Stryxen (10): this song. Is so … on another level. live…….. I can hear the hairs standing up in that room. This is perfect………

1998tweety (9): mother ate

BleepBloopMusicFan (9): I really love Ethel, and this is a collab that makes all the sense in the world. However, there’s something about the sound of this that makes me like it just a little less than the original. But it’s still really, really good in my opinion.

Nagisoid (9): This is how Ethel Cain can still win a rate-

nick1372 (9): Love the live instrumentals here. Ethel unfortunately gets overshadowed by Florence but that is not her fault in the slightest.

TiltControls (9): I think I still prefer the original over the collab, but Ethel does a fantastic job going along with Florence here that I still really like the track. Hopefully on one of their next albums we get a proper collab.

jackisboredtoday (8.5): do we think American Teenager would have won this rate if we included it?

afs (8): ethel sounds like a toned down miley here while florence sounds like florence

IIIHenryIII (8): this is beautiful

scythersboots (8): omg the harp - if DARE had just told us this is how hangovers would feel, we’d have a nation of sober millennials.

RandomHypnotica (7.8): this definitely was an improvement from the album version

WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine (7.8): okay but the image of them is adorbs

jman457 (7.5): a really beautiful life recording that I’m sure meant a lot to Ethel

alexismateofan (7): While Ethel Cain’s voice is beautiful to listen to, it doesn’t actually fix my problems with Morning Elvis. BUT Ethel Cain does save it from my utmost hatred of live songs so we count that as a victory.

slimboyfriend (7): American Gothic meets actual Gothic

welcome2thejam (7): Dope album art, though unfortunately not even the most memorable in this bonus rate [glares at iris]

## Say it like you mean it

cremeebrulee (6): :2018indiepophosts:

## the revolution

alexismateofan (10): Something entirely too powerful is in this cover here. I fear it might destroy the cosmos if I don’t give it a 10.

CrimsonROSET (10): probably my 11 if it was in the main rate

IIIHenryIII (10): they sound gorgeous

musical\_pyn (10): oh.

RandomHypnotica (10): oh this is a really gorgeous cover

savemeaseat143 (10): one of the greatest covers in existence!

scythersboots (10): how is this better than what i imagined (crying emoji) the harmonies are SO beautiful and its in the perfect key to showcase Phoebe’s soft upper range and Maggie’s vocal breaks. The strings are so fun. It feels so wrong that this song is by such a mediocre band originally.

shesdoingyoga (10): yes

shhhneak (10): I’m a Goo Goo Dolls apologist first and foremost.

Stryxen (10): I had a very odd experience with this song once that would be grounds for 0ing or 11ing it. I can do neither so I'll just award this for being a decent cover of one of my fav songs

TiltControls (10): The Goo Goo Dolls version is a 10 and so is this. Maggie and Phoebe have such great voices together on this track. Only reason I maybe could’ve tanked it for would be making it a pain in the ass to access.

phonethephoenix (9.6): a great cover of a great song!

BleepBloopMusicFan (9): It’s so, so pretty and a very worthy winner of our bonus rate…but god damn it the Soundcloud picture I’m never going to be able to take this seriously :sob:

Frajer (9): with Phoebe the line between irony and sincerity can be very blurred and this is a perfect example

InSearchOfGoodPun (9): easily an improvement on the original because of the pretty voices and pretty harmonies

Nagisoid (9): Love that Pokémon character. The song as well!

PrimaryCrusaders (9): Excellent cover of an excellent song.

Shay\_Min (8.8): such calm vibes

jman457 (8.7): I mean it’s a cover of one of my favorite songs for charity so I can’t be that mad at it

plastichaxan (8): The superior Phoebe collab of the rate

slimboyfriend (7.5): how does Phoebe Bridgers’s voice turn the most inane lyrics into the most heartwrenching

Awkward\_King (7): phoebe couldnt stand the thought of there being an indie girl rate without her

impla77 (7): this is perfectly pleasant

welcome2thejam (7): I have a soft spot for the original, and this feels like a pretty straightforward & solid cover

## Alt rock best rock

afs (6.5): sadgirlhours

WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine (6): i remember watching the bandcamp for this go OFF as this came out for the donation download. it served a crucial purpose to get someone elected to office iirc. but also it really is just a middling cover with a meme picture that tells you just how fucking deep we've been in phoebe's imperial era now.

flava (1): if you think to yourself, should I cover The Goo-Goo Dolls’ Iris, the answer is always no, just dont

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Across the popheads subreddit and discord leading up to this reveal, I saw a lot of variations of “If Florence is winning it’s with Free,” and “Free is definitely Florence’s frontrunner.” Well…y’all were consistently wrong, but I wish you hadn’t been. If I had 11’ed Florence, it would have been this song, which is just the absolute sonic epitome of “cathartic” to me. The only good thing about this elimination? It gives us a perfectly even top 4, which is definitely something I was hoping for as I watched the results take shape.

**TiltControls** (10): I was so hoping that this would end up the top Florence track, but I guess it wasn’t meant to be! I know that this is basically a Bleachers song but I fucking love Bleachers so it works perfectly for me. Jack is hit or miss on the sub, but if this is what he can do with Florence then I hope we get even more appearances from him on her future work. Anthemic in every sense of the word.

---

## Picks me up

**Frajer** (11): she's just like me for real, about to have a panic attack

**Nagisoid** (11): The popheads community has FORGIVEN Jack Antonoff after producing this SOTC (Slay of the Century)

**RandomHypnotica** (11): the lady giving out samples in the grocery store:

**Stryxen** (11): this makes me do the corniest indie coming of age film dance ever and IDGAF that's just what being 20 years old is about

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): to freedom!

**1998tweety** (10): good anime

**akanewasright** (10): This is basically a bleachers song sung by florence, but like… I really like bleachers’ best work, and this is like those songs

**Awkward\_King** (10): medication SHOULD be free exactly exactly!!

**bogo** (10): i'm feeling the music too and it is freeing

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i cut this last minute from the anime rate only for it to sneak into another rate oh its so bad for me

**flava** (10): life causes anxiety, music can sometimes help with that, other times it just gives you a good beat to tap your feet to, and this song understands that, never finding a stable surface to land on, but sometimes you hear the right sound and it just washes over you, and this song could be that sound

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): i feel like this is me shade

**letsallpoo** (10): i really hope this gets 2nd place

**Lilacly\_Adily** (10): I always get a bit emotional with this song. It’s like emotional catharsis and between this and Choreomania, I’m like a weepy, dancing mess.

**memezaharamole** (10): a cathartic release for sure.

**nick1372** (10): There are lots of songs about anxiety and lots of songs about losing yourself in music to forget the outside world but I don't think anyone has ever combined these sentiments in a song as deftly and precisely as Florence has here. Every line HITS! I think this is the best example of concise and punchy writing in a pop song I've ever heard. I love live music precisely because I can lose myself in it and forget the anxieties of the world and this song perfectly reminds me of why.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): And they say Jack Antonoff can’t make good music anymore

**shhhneak** (10): I respect any direction Florence chooses but THIS sounds like the OG tambourine tavern wench I fell for.

**slimboyfriend** (10): Jack Antonoff strikes again (complimentary)

**cremeebrulee** (9.7): with florence’s rate history, it’s more like: puts me down, puts me down, puts me down, puts me down, puts me down, puts me down, puts me down, puts me d—

**jman457** (9.3): This is where we get moving, a perfect mix of classic Flo with a groovy synth

**homestarguy** (9): Best Bleachers song

**just\_thonking** (9): I wish the whole album was like this

**phonethephoenix** (9): i like this song a lot!! it really does fit the anthemic bill

**Poydoo** (9): ear candy

**ReallyCreative** (9): giving an artist a song that he almost certainly would use for a Bleachers album... i'll allow it

**scythersboots** (9): its like a reprise of Dog Days :)

**seanderlust** (9): okay but like...anti-anxiety medication is great

**alexismateofan** (8): I’d love to be picked up but I’m always put down.

**camerinian** (8): 🎶 theeeeeeeeere is nothing like a Crown 🎶

**Roxieloxie** (8): this is a bleachers song but ill take it

**runaway3212** (8): could not be me

**savemeaseat143** (8): cookie cutter Antonoff synths but a lovely song nonetheless

**welcome2thejam** (8): Wasn't too huge on it at first, but I'm a sucker for a big transcendent bridge

**afs** (7.5): :corn:

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I know what you mean, but that's not what you achieved with this track, at least not for me

## Puts me down

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6.1): you don't need to be medicated or sedated; you're synth line tells me you just need a new lexus 4 door sedan.

**kappyko** (6): Okay fine but if this wins

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): and he picks me up and puts me down and picks me up and puts me down (I am a fork)

**beeozan** (3): kinda good song if i pretend the drum intro leads up to International Dateline by Ladytron

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): really dislike the chorus here, song never comes together for me overall

**TiltControls** (10): Although everyone managed to make it to the final 4, we say goodbye to our first artist today. Though I love this track it was probably the right call. Actually until the end when we got an influx of pro-Mitski ballots she was hovering around leaving at 6th-8th place. By the end though she got the love she wanted and managed to just squeeze into the top 4. I think if there’s any case to be made for synth Mitski it’s this track. She’s still got her standard melancholy without being lost on the incredibly catchy synth line.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Just a straight banger. I’m not surprised this was Mitski’s best performing song and, even though it ended up in fourth, it wasn’t really that far off from winning!  I took off one point because the transition into the chorus sounds a little weird to me (I don’t know if it’s the mixing or something), but otherwise oh she’s taking it…well not the rate win but something for sure.

---

## More! More! More!

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): The desperate yearning set to synths 2022 song that I NEEDED last year. Thank Mitski for delivering because this is an all time great 🫡

**jman457** (11): a perfect blend of her booming synths with cutting lyrics. I really wish I was able to 11 Mitski during the Puberty 2 rate (either Happy or Thursday Girl) but y’all set me up by putting it with my favorite Lana album. But, yeah Mitski holds a special place in my heart and this song shows how much she has grown as an artist.

**1998tweety** (10): mega bop

**alexismateofan** (10): I feel listening to this song exactly how she looks on the album cover, just… wow.

**Awkward\_King** (10): I NEED YOU TO LOVE ME MORE LOVE ME MORE LOVE ME MOOOOOORE. one thing that really sticks with me is from the music video where there's a locked door and she tries to open the door with a piano key, i think that's such a great (and silly) metaphor for mitski processing/trying to fix her problems through her music

**camerinian** (10): this is basically just Only Heartbreaker pt 2 feat. Ice Spice but they actually got the tone right here so

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): i’m a hopeless romantic so!

**homestarguy** (10): Mitski keeps releasing songs like this every few years and I, uh, well, love them more each time.

**JIRACHI** (10): this was one of those tracks that immediately clicked for me oh she's so mother

**kappyko** (10): Best chorus in the rate which counts for something

**nick1372** (10): banger, showcases exactly what Mitski wanted to do with this album and she kills it

**phonethephoenix** (10): excellent piano in this one! excellent chorus

**plastichaxan** (10): No Mitski don’t keep yourself at home it’s not worth it (Source: I’ve been home for like a month and leaving as much as I can but every day I don’t just feels miserable)

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): This one is great!!! The big 80s hi-NRG synthpop vibes are just immaculate. Best cut on the album by far.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): mitski seeing users post their laurel hell averages in #rates

**ReallyCreative** (10): a song that hits a little too close to home

**Roxieloxie** (10): theres something about the 'i could be a new girl, i will be a new girl' line that always gets me. im not even sure how to express my love for this song without writing a paper for it but I really resonate with this one in alot of the same was as TOH, if that one is the eye of the storm of everything this is the aftermath. Pulling back to stay soft the just declaration that you need more love its desperate and its messy but its there

**runaway3212** (10): So so true

**shhhneak** (10): My favourite songs in their discogs are not in the rate for the other three artists but THIS is unquestionably Mitski’s best song.

**Stryxen** (10): I love u so much mitski I'm so sorry for what's about to happen in this rate

**uberpigeon** (10): tove take notes THIS is the attention whore song i wanted

**welcome2thejam** (10): I mean, if she's gonna keep in the synthpop realm, hope more of them hit hard like this

**akanewasright** (9.8): I’ve never loved her enunciation of the word “more”… but aside from that, this is arguably ideal synthpop mitski. The synths are sooo big, and the emotion in her delivery is just as titanic, even if the chorus isn’t her strongest songwriting

**Poydoo** (9.5): I keep getting traumatic flashbacks from Sam Smith's Love Me More

**savemeaseat143** (9.2): I love desparation

**afs** (9): outsold doja

**Frajer** (9): so I need to kiss Doja Cat and SZA more and love Mitski more got it

**Nagisoid** (9): New Girl was a cultural reset she is so right in that

**vayyiqra** (9): that piano break rules

**impla77** (8.8): existence is futile but i dont want to think about that :)

**seanderlust** (8.7): when today is finally done there's another day to come and another day to come and another day to come https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/418/627/0c7.png

**CrimsonROSET** (8): doja cat x mitski

**uiscebeathaoir** (8): not massive on the verses but that chorus is so fucking addictive

**bogo** (7): ngl the more upbeat songs kinda feel like mitski aiming for another "nobody" and none of them really come all that close. that being said this is nice

**IIIHenryIII** (7): a sad synth bop

## Less! Less! Less!

**Lilacly\_Adily** (6.7): so the secret to liking her really is putting her voice over uptempo songs with a beat

**beeozan** (6): more like love me land by zara larsson

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): it’s fine. still chintzy in its production. better than Only Heartbreaker. pianos a nice touch.

TiltControls: # Laurel Hell

---

**Overall Average**: 7.446 **// Average Controversy:** 1.868

---

TiltControls: I do really like this album, but I think the other 3 outshine it a little for me. Though Mitski may’ve lost some people with her synthy switch up I still think this works as an album for me. I do miss some of the rockier stuff that Mitski would have, but beyond that I think she did a great job finding a new evolution for her sound. Results-wise this album was taking quite a beating for a while, but a few late Mitski fans managed to push this back up with the rest of the albums.

BleepBloopMusicFan: I, along with a lot of people, was pretty underwhelmed with this album when it initially dropped. However, I decided to give it another real honest shot about halfway through the year and it clicked a whole lot more!  And not just for the big, poppy songs, but a lot of the slower ones too (except Working for the Knife sorry to its fans).  With Mitski’s music, it is very essential to pay real attention to the lyrics, which she is just so good at crafting. I was guilty of not doing that on my first listen. But I make sure to do it now.

**plastichaxan** (9.591): This album just feels so personal to me. I feel seen, I feel

**Roxieloxie** (9.409): If it wasnt obvious by my average yes be the cowboy is my most played mitski album which means i took this album in with open arms. being a newer mitski fan is so interesting because I got into her via the rate we did eons ago in 2018 and I didnt largely see the opinions of her fans but durring lockdown when tiktok created a resugrence I sorta learned that older mitski fans resent that album/era a bit and when this one looked like it was heading in the direction of that sound and not puberty 2 it felt like I could hear the tomatoes being thrown of those who were not thrilled. But this was one of my most played albums of the year, I really enjoy it its fun, it maktes think, there songs on it that make me feel more like a robot than a girl like its everything i could ever want out of a mitski record!

**akanewasright** (8.800): idk, it’s not my favorite mitski album but I still love her voice (and like it over synthpop).

**alexismateofan** (8.455): I started this rank thinking I’d be biased towards Dance Fever of all albums, but no, I’m absolutely apparently a secret Mitski stan that I wasn’t even prepared to. This album is absolutely what I’d consider perfection on so many levels. The song choices AND order, the lyrics, the music in the back, the variety of genres. Like Mitski is serving on a level that snuck up on me and I think it’s going to catch so many others by complete surprise when they hear this album, especially if their only songs were ‘Strawberry Blonde’ and ‘Nobody’ like me.

**afs** (8.364): l fav album of the rate, mitski's sadgirl vocals go so well with the production (final rating = 8.5/10)

**Poydoo** (8.336): the songs are too short

**uiscebeathaoir** (8.091): I’ve tried hard to get into Be the Cowboy, but just never managed it. But I got this immediately. It’s just a really solid album

**Stryxen** (8.045): SO GOOD. SO OVERLOOKED

**vayyiqra** (7.909): Oddly despite thinking I do not vibe with Mitski and have tried her music a lot of time and not gotten into most of it I liked this album fine (?) It's not amazing or anything but I don't mind it. A lot of it has the "demo track" feel of a lot of Mitski's music but her take on minimal synthpop hit with me somehow.

**just\_thonking** (7.864): Better than I remembered

**jman457** (7.818): An overhated album (like another album that was released last year by a Japanese-decent artist that we rated recently 👀) this is better than Be The cowboy, but not as good as Puberty 2.

**dream\_fighter2018** (7.500): look, this isn’t Mitski’s best but it’s a solid effort! Some of the synths sound a bit cheap, and there’s a fair amount of filler, but where it hits it hits.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.455): The fresh thread for this album makes me laugh so much cause… I like it? I like poppy Mitski! I like her simple lyrics! I like songs over 3 minutes! I definitely vibe with this more than Be The Cowboy, not that that didn't have any good songs. But this definitely suites my personal tastes a lot more

**camerinian** (7.227): weird album. Definitely has strong moments but it kinda feels like Mitski lost a bit of sight of her strengths when it comes to her brevity, namely being leaving a really strong impression in a short amount of time. Not many of these songs actually do enough to stick with  you in order to overcome the lack of typical songcraft which has previously made her unique. I dunno, coming off of Be The Cowboy which was so diverse and had so many ideas that it squeezed together so well, this can’t help but feel like a bit of a wheel spinning

**Nagisoid** (7.000): Damn, I despised Laurel Hell on release. It has grown on me a bunch since then though, but it'd still feel confident calling it the Mitski album I hold less dear to my heart. Be the Cowboy showed a lot of promise but this doesn't really deliver on it by abandoning indie music altogether and making a full blown synthpop/new wave bops. I like it for what it is but that's the peak of my enjoyment for it. Waiting for the Lily Chou Chou covers album that she is about to release at any moment, my future AOTY.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.955): There's only like, four songs on this album I actually enjoy, the rest is just... there.

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6.809): Laurel Hell is fine. not a garbage fire or a misfire, but more an act of artistic "i'm tired" statement hitting all the regular notes and bases. mitski writes essential mitski in a shorter, more refined synthpop style 3.5 years on BTC. it just finds itself in this truly weird space: it is arena/stadium ready, but something in its production stops it from ever seeming like its a real showstopper. One of her lead singles gives the vibe of being bitter and just knowing that "mid is good enough". and in all honesty? that's prolly why im alright with laurel hell more over makeout creek or BTC, but also never want to return to those any of these again for a long time. but if i saw mitski was gonna play a festival i was going to I'd prolly see her because a lot of this material clearly is catered to the one vessel any of mitski's music had been leading to...abstract/inspired/tenacious/purposeful movement. and being trapped in a laurel hell will wrangle out those kinds of movements that at least made her such a fantastic performer across her long history

**JIRACHI** (6.409): this would've been a perfect album if every track had been Love Me More

**shhhneak** (6.336): Doesn’t really reach the dynamic highs of its pre-release singles and often feels short and unrefined… wait are we reviewing SOS or Laurel Hell?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.318): Kinda wanna just submit this ballot and not dwell too much on my Thoughts:tm: with Laurel Hell so I’ll try to be brief. Yes this is a disappointment to me! Mitski was the defining artist for me in my 20s; in 2015 finding a nonwhite indie artist singing so artfully about longing and festering pain cracked open my skull and resonated with me in a way no artist ever had before. Bury Me at Makeout Creek and Puberty 2 are two albums I would (and have) give 10+ averages to. Be the Cowboy good, some great songs on here. Some good songs on Laurel Hell too, but imo some of Mitski’s worst songs too. Plodding tempos, some of her weakest lyrics, cheapest production. Just taking in the music face value and without the “does Mitski even wanna be here” meta-context, the album DOES sound phoned-in to me. I wonder if she’s outgrown her partnership with her longtime producer Patrick Hyland, who seemed good at capturing her more 90s stuff but here imo is flopping with the 80 synthpop sound. My pipe dream is for her to collaborate with Oneohtrix Point Never; it felt like last year’s Soccer Mommy album that he produced was like an audition to produce a 2016 Mitski album. To be blunt, for me Mitski’s art feels stagnant at this point, which is disappointment as she’s an artist whose work means a lot to me. The more I think about it the sadder I get awe and I’ve already typed more than I planned so I’ll end that here.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.000): It’s not bad, but it feels too mature for my taste. Maybe when I’m older I'll appreciate it more. As of now, I’ll be streaming only a couple of songs from it.

**cremeebrulee** (4.945): to be fair to mitski, it took ages for her last 3 albums to grow on me, so maybe this one will too

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Aaaaaand no matter what happens now, we will be getting a first-time rate winner. What I Want had the highest number of 11’s in the rate, with 10. However, (slight spoiler here) it’s also the only song in the top 4 with a 0. And not just one but two. What a lot of people wanted was for this song to win, but they were overridden by a few people who REALLY REALLY didn’t want it.

**TiltControls** (6): Don’t get me wrong, I 100% get why people love this track. Lyrically it’s incredibly relatable and the production is fully reminiscent of a club you might hear this playing in. I just actually don’t really like it all that much sonically. Anytime I listen to it I just think ‘yeah I can see why this is fantastic, but can I listen to something else now?’. It actually reminds me of Number One Fan in a way like that where I get the love for it, but something sonically just never clicks for me. Though this was another frontrunner for a while, the dual 0’s blocked it from ever really having a proper reign at the top.

## That's what I fucking want!

**flava** (11): the chaos, the anxiety, the draw to push yourself into the most reckless of benders because you can finally just be yourself. Not in peace, there is nothing peaceful about this newfound freedom, it’s defensive, and might kill for it now that freedom has been found, and that’s what makes it spectacular, especially coming right after Silk Chiffon with how firm but generally non-threatening it is.

**just\_thonking** (11): Hell yeah lesbians

**oscarbrierley1** (11): yass gay af bop

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): God I love this one so MUCH!!! I wanna dance in the middle of a gay bar too! Let me at it!

**shesdoingyoga** (11): I desperately want Florence to win this rate but I just have to give this my 11 because this song just speaks to me in a way that very few other songs can. After spending most of my life hiding from other people and also myself, I just want what I want and I’m gonna make up for it all at once. Plus they put crack in the production.

**1998tweety** (10): gay anthem

**akanewasright** (10): I have some very rude thoughts for people who dislike it but I will keep them to myself and say “if you get it you get it if you don’t then do better”

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is so fucking cunty. club, bar, another club, no break. snorting coke and dancing on the tables at a wetherspoons. this is for the GIRLS

**camerinian** (10): daaaaaamn close to an 11, if only because, in terms of fulfilling the goal of being “anthemic”, this track really smashes the brief. This is the closest to a mantra the rate has, and it has all of the communal power and energy to really convey it. This is the sort of track that will soundtrack a lot of people’s self-discovery journeys, and if that doesn’t define an anthem I don’t know what does.

**cremeebrulee** (10): it honestly stings a little bit when i find out people don’t like this song… as someone who realized they were queer later in life, the idea of “making up for it all it once” hits very close to home pensivegrin pensivegrin

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this makes me feel like a 25-year-old wlw who just came out and is being taken to her first gay bar

**IIIHenryIII** (10): oh, paying attention to the pre-chorus made me appreciate this song even more. I already loved it, but now I truly love it

**impla77** (10): this makes me want to be an extrovert

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): shoutout to Song Exploder

**JIRACHI** (10): dicks

**musical\_pyn** (10): either this or want want will be my eleven and that will be a last minute decision

**nick1372** (10): Muna already made the defining song about finding refuge in a queer community with "I Know a Place" and What I Want is the followup about feeling safe enough in that space to truly express yourself and experiment with what you want for yourself. It's so special to me and would be an 11 in any other rate

**phonethephoenix** (10): 100% anthemic! aspirational tbh? truly great refrain and i love the bridge

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i can't believe how controversial gay rights are on R/POPHEADS!?

**ReallyCreative** (10): hearing this live is gay ascension idk you just have to be there

**Roxieloxie** (10): this past year or so i think i've been having a time as a queer/sapphic person trying to figure out what a want. i think its all sorta culminated with this year for this pride month and just feeling just extremely isolated and alone. Im not out but i've known what i am for almost 10 years now and i think its just easy to feel drowned out in all of these expectations of how to be a good queer and that combined with my lack of experience combined with covid absolutely decimating me coming out of my shell. I've never felt more isolated and undeserved to fit into the community and like they're right im gonna make up for it. I want the full effects! I want to dance in the middle of a gay bar. I want that girl right over there to want to date me!

**runaway3212** (10): They did not have to end this badly

**seanderlust** (10): We Stan a queer adolescence bop!!

**TragicKingdom1** (10): tbh after their second album i was skeptical that they could ever make a song as good as I Know A Place but this surpasses it greatly...if i didn't successfully tkayola maggie into the rate this would be the easy 11

**uberpigeon** (10): i think muna should go full synthpop more often because this and number one fan are their best songs

**memezaharamole** (9.5): i love this bridge

**Poydoo** (9.1): I'm not lesbian but this song is very relatable anyway

**CrimsonROSET** (9): if you want want what I want want then you want want me

**ignitethephoenix** (9): man, this is such an anthem for those who have been in the closeted and are finally out and can fully be free.

**scythersboots** (9): the song exploder ep on this song is so good

**jman457** (8.7): immaculately produced.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): Maybe it needed to grow on me idk

**bigbigbee** (8): guinea pigs :)

**homestarguy** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSLMLHNY4QQ

**shhhneak** (8): It’s easy to say you want to dance in the middle of a gay bar until Pride weekend hits and you’re waiting in line for an hour smoking with Svetlana the Russian model and finally have a panic attack from the crowd crush in the street.

**vayyiqra** (8): While I don't quite love this song I'd say it's the most memorable on the album (and also as if I am going to tank this during pride month but thankfully I don't have to worry about that I like it fine)

**welcome2thejam** (8): Put youtube link to Homer Simpson lesbian bar scene here

**kappyko** (7.5): Tbh im gonna be a lil petty and say that "ooh ooh ooooh" in the chorus is really bad

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (7.2): lol they automatically get much better when they just make "totally perfect 5/7" synthpop nothingburgers that are basically just a girl group vibing making big beats for bookclub dance night with the white girls.

**afs** (7): what i want want want is to see how many want want comments are there

**alexismateofan** (7): 🏳️‍🌈?????

**Nagisoid** (7): YOU AIN'T GOT IT

**savemeaseat143** (7): never understood the hype

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): give it to me baby like boom boom boom

**uiscebeathaoir** (7): I know everyone loves this song but for ages i just couldn’t get into it. It was only listening to it for this rate that it grew on me at all

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): OK Dirt Femme

## I used up all my 'Want' jokes

**Quiet-Tone13** (6.5): the verses are catchy, but the chorus doesn't end up being as big or euphoric as it needs to be for this song to work. The vocals and production in the chorus hold it back.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I heard this song play in the DSW in Boystown last summer

**bogo** (5): i don't have anything interesting to say about these songs they didn't give me anything to work with

**dream\_fighter2018** (0): lazy hook, this does not inspire me to party but rather to wish for the Vengabus to take me away to somewhere more interesting.

**Stryxen** (0): EW.!!!!! awful hook! Actually almost every melody is terrible and unfinished to my ears… can't stand this!!

**Overall Average**: 7.528 **// Average Controversy:** 1.983

TiltControls: Though there are a few misses on the album for me, I really loved this album overall. It’s probably the most ‘anthemic’ of the 4 to me and despite a rocky start, it’s good to see that it still did so well overall (even if I still think Shooting Star was incredibly robbed).

BleepBloopMusicFan: Not quite the greatest band in the world. But oh my god they do fucking rule.

**Frajer** (9.273): it's been such a joy seeing them blow up, just an incredible pop band with killer hooks and harmonies

**shhhneak** (9.236): While this was my favourite rate we’ve ever done on popheads there was no reality where MUNA lost my ballot. This was my AOTY in 2022, I’ve seen them play this album live multiple times, and they’re only getting better. I’m so proud of the greatest band in the world.

**alexismateofan** (8.818): So I only just heard of this band, as mentioned in my Silk Chiffon review, from Silk Chiffon being on my Cottagecore Mix on Spotify. I was hooked but generally speaking, I will get hooked to one song and just not care about the rest of their playlist until something else hits and it all just tumbles down. This album is where something else hit for me, and I just downloaded most of it to my brain.

**nick1372** (8.591): MUNA's self-titled is a clear upgrade from their previous work--everything here is slickly produced and sooo catchy. Love to see them thriving on Phoebe's label!

**impla77** (8.582): I really like the hooks on the whole, very bombastic album. Took me a few listens, but this album really grew on me in a big way

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.455): This album is probably the best one out of the bunch. Practically non-stop pure fun from beginning to end! Great album!!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.273): Going into this rate I just knew Silk Chiffon and Anything But Me and I had verrryyy low expectations for MUNA, I did NOT see the hype with them. Well, this has been one of my most pleasant surprises in a rate! They exceeded my expectation making very warm, detailed pop rock with a lot of heart! And some really thrilling synth-pop bangers. Finally see what all the fuss was on MUNA, even if I still hate those two songs. Perhaps I finally check out their older albums!

**flava** (8.136): banger album with good summery vibes

**xxipil0ts** (8.027): - 'the loneliest time' for people with mullets

**uiscebeathaoir** (8.000): I first listened to this album when it came out and I did not like it. The latter half really blended together, and because of that I never revisited it. I still have no idea (hehe get it) what was up with me that day, cause this a really good pop album front to back

**bigbigbee** (7.682): I actually like Saves The World better but it’s grown on me, especially after seeing it live, and I’m really glad that they’ve gotten such success from this one!

**just\_thonking** (7.591): Good job lesbians

**cremeebrulee** (7.500): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fkm_0kgVQAAsBqj?format=jpg&name=medium

**Poydoo** (7.400): maybe the

**camerinian** (7.318): gah this was frustrating, the album starts off so strong with two of the best queer pop songs to come out in years (not a sparse market), but it almost immediately dips off into being just merely a good synthpop album with not tons distinct about it. Some decent later highs to be sure, but I really wish it pulled through on the promise that it started with

**afs** (7.136): not really a step forward but has its moments ESPECIALLY the closer, hope they go in that direction (final rating 7/10)

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.100): boygenius if they weren’t depressed

**Roxieloxie** (6.891): I really really respect muna and who they are and their commitment to writting music centering queer relationships. They've been like that since they started and have never once comprimised it! However I think I only like them when they step out of their usual stuff and write an absolute dance banger ala I know a place/Number one Fan/What I want. The other stuff just is a little too indie for my personal taste.

**JIRACHI** (6.682): LESBIANS ❤️❤️❤️

**jman457** (6.645): the first two tracks were so promising and then it just got boring. I wish they soared a bit higher.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (6.545): I really thought I remembered liking this album more than I actually did.

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6.491): sometimes the smartest thing a label can do is give an artist an imprint so at least even if they sign to interscope or some shit, they have an fingerprint and guiding force for their fans/a new commercial avenue of music income for the label to milk. Sorta seems like thats the real potential of MUNA. you have 3 women who are strong at fitting into any styles and doing blank pastiche that might grab you either for a stray track or run of 3. i was surprised. Not by that it sounds like 80s sound, or that the other half has "I think this is made for a movie adaptation of Circe or some Colleen Hoover shit" but by the fact that this is diverse enough to have an accidental industrial pop undercurrent that services. what the fuck? why am i being catered to alongside shit like silk chiffon or the middling back half of sleepers? I came in having a grasp of what I was getting and leave wondering why MUNA don't commit to really honing in on niche impulses or full out club hedonism? i want that, not to feel preached or sold a product or feeling to.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.318): boygenius is actually kinda good. I listened to this before, but only liked 3 tracks, but now I like 4.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.273): I just assumed they were a K-Pop group until last year… Anyways clearly they know how to make pop songs but so much of it just feels so… lacking in personality? Like what can I find here that I can’t get somewhere else?

**Nagisoid** (5.909): First album I listen by them and it was fine, however it was my least favorite in the rate. They try to balance their synthpop and pop rock leanings here yet don't find balance most of the time and that creates some duds. The lyrics are okay but partially forgettable. Probably will return to some cuts in the future.

**beeozan** (5.727): why do more than half of these songs just become meh when the first verse starts? the intros just feel infinitely more interesting and then they vanish

**plastichaxan** (5.409): I feel slightly homophobic (in a bad way) tanking them a bit because I like them but their music feels a bit bland to me, and I would like to know why considering they have everything to be a poppyhead favorite

**dream\_fighter2018** (5.182): yes, this average is low and this might not be long enough to justify why I’m tanking this album so badly. I just think it’s rather bland, none of the hooks grab me, and the vocals are hit or miss. Silk Chiffon has none of these issues, but somehow it comes off as lightning in a bottle that the rest of the album cannot capture. The rest of the album is something that just misses any form of spark or oomph.

**vayyiqra** (5.000): I like MUNA's first album a lot. I like their second album a fair bit. I do not really like this one I fear. Sad!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Holy moly! I know I’ve been pretty fortunate with 11 wins so far this year but I never imagined I would get so close to getting another one with this! I was hoping for, at best, a cute 8th place or so. However, after some time in the lower half of the top 10, it rose back into the top 3 and never left. Even on ballots that weren’t very positive on Maggie overall, this song kept getting 8’s, 9’s, and 10’s. Not wanting to get too hopeful, I never even really entertained the possibility of it winning, especially as it fell a bit more behind about 10 ballots from the end. But then…some of our last few extension ballots helped it gain some BIG ground on My Love! When we closed, it was a mere 1.5 points behind. So so so so so close, but, for now, Maggie stays out of the winners club. 

But about the actual song…again, holy moly. When I started my ballot, I was not set on an 11 at all and was considering a bunch of songs. But when I listened to this again…there was no other answer. A lot of songs in the rate make we want to shout-sing along to them in the car, but Shatter makes me want to scream-cry-shake-my-hands-wildly-check-the-mirror-to-make-sure-I’m-not-swerving-at-all-sing along to it. If the bridge and final chorus to Anywhere with You made me scream cry throw up etc (and they do), the bridge and final chorus to Shatter, well, they simply make me disintegrate completely. I can’t help it. When I finish the song I just have to listen AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN-

**TiltControls** (10): BleepBloop can attest that I was so hoping this would manage to pull off the win in the end. Almost no one predicted it, but there was just so much love shown for the track that it managed to hang out near the top (and sometimes at the top!) for almost the entire rate. Maggie just goes all in here. Though I get that it’s not the strongest vocally I think it works well with the song! She’s really going all out with this and it would’ve really encapsulated the relatable anthemic part of the rate. As in the part where I sing along to all of these songs despite not having the proper vocal ability to do so.

## Groundbreaking

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (11): this rips, rocking dialed up chorus, awesome bridge, distorted guitar that sounds like farts, this song has it all

**JIRACHI** (11): god this is just next level. it makes me feel all the emotions in 3 minutes i have to give this my 11

**welcome2thejam** (11): If this wins, does Florence also get a win? It would feel like if you got traded off a team halfway through the season and then that team wins the championship, and you get sent a ring. Like yeah, you contributed so you deserve some acknowledgement, but doesn't it feel the slightest bit hollow around your finger? Of course, one ring is better than none. Anyway, huge cathartic power anthem, love it

**Awkward\_King** (10): hair in the breeze, grinning like a child, man titties out, this is joy

**beeozan** (10): shatter more like slaytter. wait

**bogo** (10): AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN AGAAAAAAIIIIIIIIN!

**camerinian** (10): oh my fucking GOD the JOY on this is so infectious, like this is the sort of liberated, overwhelming **feeling** that this rate should be all about, like god Maggie is having so much fun on this track and I’m so glad that the pretentious that this sort of music can come with are cut away to just celebrate how fucking good being with someone you love can feel. This is so invigorating, so life-affirming, so stunningly happy

**cremeebrulee** (10): FLORENCE IS ON THIS? okayyy rate cohesion

**CrimsonROSET** (10): wait im shaking ass what the fuck

**Frajer** (10): love that this and Since U Been Gone have the same bridge

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): IDONTREALLYCAREIFITNEARLYKILLSMEIDGIVEYOUTHEWORLDIFYOUASKMETOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**homestarguy** (10): O.A.R could never

**IIIHenryIII** (10): sorry, but the other girls in the rate can’t quite rock like that. This is perfection in music form.

**impla77** (10): the yass song we were all waiting for

**musical\_pyn** (10): this was my favorite when the album initially released and even though that's not the case anymore I still love it

**Nagisoid** (10): Shatter sounds like such a beautiful word now

**plastichaxan** (10): I see this mentioned so little and it’s incredible hello???

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Really digging this one, got some aggressive punk-y vibes going on here. Probably my fave on the album.

**ReallyCreative** (10): excellence

**shesdoingyoga** (10): we love any chance for Florence to win

**shhhneak** (10): All rise for the Florence feature!! She’s on background vocals with her signature yodels and the tambourine. You may not notice it at first, but when you get clued in it’s impossible to not notice. The backstory here is a highlight of the Surrender creation. Both Maggie and Florence were recording their albums at Electric Lady in New York during the summer of 2021. They were both hanging out at the studio one day, and Maggie asked if she’d like to contribute anything to Shatter, playing the demo for her. Florence came back minus later and performed her backing rendition. Mother takes care of her own.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): too bad she shattered her glass because she definitely needed some water after this vocal take

**phonethephoenix** (9.8): really like the momentum of the song!

**1998tweety** (9.5): this is so close to being a 10 but the way she chorus ends feels off to me

**nick1372** (9.5): I am overwhelmed by the sudden urge to destroy all my kitchenware

**Poydoo** (9.3): my ears like the buzzy

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (9.1): this is basically a florence and the machine song but aggie rogers makes it an aggie rogers ditty by saying "all right". like the CA DMV bot, i've decided to ACCEPT this

**seanderlust** (8.5): That bridge is so real tbh

**jman457** (8.3): I could see this hitting live

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): the only thing holding this song back for me is Maggie's voice honestly

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the production is so boppy but her voice doesn’t always fit in here. I think a different vocalist would make this 10/10

**runaway3212** (8): I love the energy on this one

**uiscebeathaoir** (8): After this and Be Cool I realised that she just really loves singing the letter ‘o’

**savemeaseat143** (7.8): intense song

**xxipil0ts** (7.8): - okay let her cook

**afs** (7.5): vocals? shattered. glass? shattered. wig? shattered.

## *Glass breaking*

**alexismateofan** (7): There’s something in the verses in the back that I feel is actively trying to kill me. If this is my final rate, you know that it got me.

**Stryxen** (7): ouch

**bigbigbee** (6.5): sounds like a song that my dance teacher used to make us do abdomen isolations to

**scythersboots** (6): idk i think i would have liked this better as a Flo song

TiltControls: # Surrender

---

**Overall Average**: 7.458 **// Average Controversy:** 1.824

---

TiltControls: Though I can see why people wouldn’t love some of the album cuts as much, Surrender is probably my favourite album in this rate front-to-back. It starts off with an incredible run of songs and then keeps the vibe going throughout the rest of the album. So many songs that I’ll just sing along to without a care and I’m glad she didn’t get steamrolled here against bigger competition. Now we just need Maggie to make Shatter a single.

BleepBloopMusicFan: Oh wow I just rechecked my album averages and I didn’t realize that this ended up being my highest! You know what, deserved! The six song stretch from tracks 2-7 in particular…just incredible. Before I was asked to co-host this rate I didn’t know much about Maggie Rogers at all. Now…safe to say I’m a fan.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.625): I don’t know what much to say about this album except it’s like the perfect “2020s pop rock album I wanna hear”. And I still haven’t heard Maggie’s first album cuz I don’t think I’ll like it lmao. I first heard That’s Where I Am and was hooked. I really enjoyed it the day it dropped (put it on right after Renaissance lol) and was somewhat sad to see the mixed-to-disappointed reviews this got. It’s hard for me to pinpoint the sound it’s evoking here, it definitely has a 2000s feel to it in a way that makes it feel very comfy and familiar to me while still sounding fresh and cathartic. Michelle Branch? Sheryl Crow? Feist? Matchbox Twenty?! lmfao whatever it may be, the fact that I fuck heavy with this album cuz of its updated 2000s VH1-core vibes prolly just makes i’m washed but that’s ok! It’s definitely an album I wanna put on during a road trip.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.583): One of my favorite albums of last year. It barely missed my top 10, but ever since I feel like it climbed to the second half of it. Maggie sounds so raw and vulnerable in these tracks that it kinda makes me feel uncomfortable sometimes, like I should not be listening to them. Chef’s kiss!

**shhhneak** (8.642): I wrote about this project for the popheads 2022 AOTY series so I’ll go ahead and promo that! It’s wild to me that she basically wrote and scrapped an entire album before this because it was too bitter. She’s a better person than me, I trauma dump in reddit music rate.

**cremeebrulee** (8.300): i kinda wished my Heard it in a Past Life scores were better, so i’m pretty glad i got to make it up to maggie this time around xx

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (8.192): not sure what da fuck aggie rogers had to do to get pharrell's attention at NYU, but she is a taurus and her album is bizarrely fucking competent so i support the endeavor. she seems better than most of the pomo anonymous pop girlies

**plastichaxan** (8.175): She really continued the trend of that one song of hers that makes me feel like a main character in an indie movie and said you know what let me make it an album

**camerinian** (8.042): god what a pleasant surprise, this was the only album which i didn’t even have passing knowledge of given I didn’t really care for Maggie’s earlier material, but holy shit there’s so much to love here. Like, the writing is much more simplistic than all three other albums, but in terms of driving the anthems which this rate is centred around, Maggie simply hits much more consistently and with more highs, plus a vocal presence that’s way more dynamic than I ever would have given her credit. The pop rock styling fits her like a glove and I think it’d be a real disappointment if this was just a one time thing

**Poydoo** (7.958): maybe the

**jman457** (7.875): This album surprised me in the best way, as I never saw the hype around her with her last album, but this was great. It sucks she released it the same day as renaissance though :/

**Stryxen** (7.708): Let's get maggied

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.517): This album wasn't too bad. There's a few pretty good cuts on this one, especially "Shatter".

**afs** (7.083): slay indie rock that sometimes goes hard and sometimes is a bit cursive (final rating: 7)

**just\_thonking** (7.000): Surrender? I hardly know her!

**alexismateofan** (7.000): Unfortunately, I was obsessed with Heard It In A Past Life, where I would have probably given that album a perfect 10. So I had really high expectations going into Surrender. I did give it an original listen and vibed but not like I do for rates when I go everything with a fine toothed comb. And it suffered when doing that. Still a good album but definitely not as high as I thought I’d rank the songs on it.

**scythersboots** (6.958): I really did NOT love this album when it first came out. I think I listened to it one time and just felt like…Maggie was stuck in a store that sold Crystals and would remain there forever, doomed to never repeat the success of her first album.

**JIRACHI** (6.958): quite a few fillers ngl but the ones that hit damn do they hit hard

**Nagisoid** (6.917): Prefer the more alt moments on here to the acoustic ones but still neat. Interesting vocal delivery and instrumentation do a lot to propel this record forward and add variety. Not sure what she's saying in some of these songs but it's puzzling at worst.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (6.767): I still prefer Heard It In A Past Life but this was an overall good pivot. It starts strings and only near the end does it get a little too mediocre and bland for me.

**impla77** (6.317): couldn’t really connect to the vocals here, everything just seemed a bit transparent idk. wasn’t for me

**akanewasright** (6.292): this isn’t bad but it’s a big old “not for me”

**vayyiqra** (6.250): I like Maggie fine I guess she's alright and good at what she does but not really my thing. I don't have much to say about this album but I liked it fine. A lot of inspo from 90s alt-rock I think (?!) big decade for singer-songwriters.

**flava** (6.083): on release day I had this queued after my first listen to Renaissance and forgot about it, so when Overdrive started I thought it was a weird choice for Beyoncé to feature Lana on her new album

**dream\_fighter2018** (5.917): pleasant surprise! I had no idea who Maggie Rogers was before this and I’m impressed now.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.833): Idk who Maggie Rogers is but someone needs to tell her that she doesn't have to break her voice every time she sings a chorus

**nick1372** (5.375): I hated this album at first (because the first two singles were awful) but I've come around on it. Its short runtime keeps it from wearing out its welcome, and a few incredibly solid hooks anchor a lot of these songs to reality.

**Roxieloxie** (5.300): this is the second maggie rodgers song i've listened to for a rate and I regret to inform the listeners that I Still Dont Get it. She's probably gonna win this because I dont think she has any haters which is deserved I dont think there was anything I hated with this album and I can see exactly why i've been seeing people really enjoy it all year but its not my thing. there was a 3 song stretch at the start that I really liked but once I got over that It wore off. This album almost sounded like i was kinda listening to the part 2 of the muna album sonically which may have added to me overal kinda being like meh

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): My 11 just lost a rate by 1.5 points. I should be upset. But…I’m just not! Florence is such a pop icon and it’s about damn time she won a rate here. This wouldn’t be my first choice for a Florence winner (that would be Free), but it’s more than worthy in my opinion. Just an absolutely perfect dance banger.

**TiltControls** (7): This is a fine song. That’s what my comment was going to be when I expected this to leave at #23 or something, but somehow this managed to hold on to the top for nearly the entire rate! I’m not mad, it’s definitely solid - I just never knew there was that much love for this track. Though I can see why - it definitely has vibes of older Florence dance tracks on her earlier albums. I definitely would’ve preferred a good amount of other tracks in the top 10 over this to win tbh, but the people have spoken and it seems like they’ll be quite happy with this win! Plus Florence finally breaks her painful rate loss streak (sorry Charli, maybe next rate).

---

## I love it!

**alexismateofan** (11): I went back and forth on this and Dream Girl Evil as my 11, but relistening to this absolutely nailed it for me. She goes so hard on this song, it’s so perfect. It sounds like it could be on Ceremonials, which is one of my all time favorite Florence albums, but I don’t think she could have done it like this back then. Florence has nowhere to go but up from this and I am LIVING.

**CrimsonROSET** (11): like i have such visual reactions to this album its a tango scene and they keep dropping each other with smirks but at the end one of them is dead and there’s a quick montage about how they’ve actually been having a fight but it was disguised as a dance? like its perfect no notes

**ignitethephoenix** (11): one of my favorites from last year

**ReallyCreative** (11): this track has Donna Summer MacArthur Park levels of melodrama

**uberpigeon** (11): HA!!!

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**akanewasright** (10): if Florence ever releases an album with this sound I will be 1000% back on the Flo train. I like the band’s art-poppy stuff too, but dance music fits her voice like a goddamn glove. She has the bulldozer power and emotion in her voice to be a proper dance diva, and this is only a fraction of her true power

**Awkward\_King** (10): my takes on this album are so basic like.. i enjoy the ass shakers

**beeozan** (10): my love & my slay

**bogo** (10): justin timberlake has been real quiet ever since this dropped

**camerinian** (10): can this one please start charting instead of the public just reheating dog days for the 100th time

**JIRACHI** (10): kinda need a disco album from her now this is saur good

**jman457** (10): One of the best Florence songs since her HBHBHB days

**Nagisoid** (10): Victorian dance floors haven't burnt this one out yet

**Poydoo** (10): This song is good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i am so obssessed with this music video

**savemeaseat143** (10): banger of a song

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Her disco era

**shhhneak** (10): I wrote a blurb for this song for the Top 100 Write-ups (that never happened?) so here it is instead: Florence Welch is no stranger to purgatory. She has openly shared her battles against depression, abuse, alcoholism, and eating disorders throughout her discography. ‘No Choir’ literally opens with “it’s hard to write about being happy.” But what happens when that personal hell is a force majeure? 'My Love' is about that struggle. This brings us to March 2020, two words that simply indicate a cosmic shift. Florence took a hiatus from music after release 2018’s 'High as Hope,' a scaled-back but sophisticated album that perhaps indicated she was done with music. She entered a bohemian poet phase, releasing a book of poetry akin to a medieval manuscript. But the pandemic lockdowns stealing the stage away from her made her realize she missed it and that it may never return. What began as acoustic poem writings through bouts of creative block turned into a bombastic return to form worthy of a ‘Dance Fever’ title. The music video is adorned with Art Deco cabaret embellishments and Florence herself looks like she just stepped off the set of a 'Lungs' photoshoot. It’s classic Alice in Wonderland fantasy tinged with witchy elements as the audience is possessed by this spell. Florence, praying away the decrepit winter, sings “My arms emptied, the skies emptied / The billboards emptied / My arms emptied, the skies emptied / The buildings emptied” to a room that had been raptured. Florence once said her two greatest loves are music and alcohol. She’s eight years sober, so when all is taken from you where do you put that love?

**Stryxen** (10): finding out this was produced by the glass animals guy was almost as bad as finding out about big gods production… but Jamie xx remains my mortal enemy so comparatively I forgive and give this a 10

**flava** (9.5): just a bop, nothing more or less to say

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9.5): The Glass Animals and Meduza remixes of this are super dope.

**cremeebrulee** (9.3): this is strangeness & charm part 2 and we love that

**afs** (9): INDEED

**scythersboots** (9): another gem from this album that i feel so relieved to get to..but the intro is so very long.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): “The billboard’s empty” - ARMY 2 weeks after a mass-buying campaign

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): The beat to this reminds me of that one Calvin Harris track Florence is on and the line about "writing my way out" reminds me of Lin Manuel Miranda, and yet! somhow! this song is pretty good

**nick1372** (8): I respect this song more than I actually like it. The dance beat is elegantly crafted from organic instrumentation & Florence's gasps in a way that is super cool and novel but the resulting song is unfortunately boringly perfect. Which is soooo disappointing because a song with the hook "Tell me where to put my love" should strike me right through the heart but it doesn't :/ I think it DESPERATELY needs a bridge because it's just going at 100% speed the entire time and it doesn't give you any breathing room.

**phonethephoenix** (8): i want either a little more or something else from this song but still think it's really strong???

**runaway3212** (8): vibey

**vayyiqra** (8): one of those classic "tambourine in the shower" type cuts

**welcome2thejam** (8): A good dance track in the Florence sound

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (7.3): oh THIS is dance fever! i like the "hA-hiYA" noises that make me feel like im at the gym and flor

## Emptied

**IIIHenryIII** (7): JT outsold

**uiscebeathaoir** (6): always found this too pop, sorry

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): dislike the melody here, and that florence kinda sounds behind the beat. as like the only random person on the subreddit who stanned Emeli Sande in 2011, this kinda sounds like an “Our Version of Events” song and kinda wish she was singing it instead

TiltControls: # Dance Fever

---

**Overall Average**: 7.467 **// Average Controversy:** 1.873

---

TiltControls: This album is funny for me as I think I actually liked Florence’s softer songs here compared to the big, fast bops. Both were anthemic in a sense, but the quieter songs had this sense of intimacy with them that reminded me of one of my other favourite albums, Punisher. It doesn’t always have to go all out to be an anthem, sometimes it’s enough to just have a soft sound and fantastic lyrics.

BleepBloopMusicFan: Florence ended up with my lowest album average, but it feels really misleading to me because that’s fully, entirely because of three songs. Everything else I either really liked or even loved. I’m glad that it produced a rate winner, though I gotta say it’s very funny to me that we specifically and very deliberately chose the single without the Jack-man on it.

**shhhneak** (9.147): Good Evening, a Florence + The Machine album produced by Jack Antonoff was a 13 month sociological study conducted by Harvard University. We are now complete with our study. (No seriously, how did it turn out as good as it did?)

**Frajer** (8.900): this album truly blew me away when it came out, it's so personal and raw and Jack and Davey work so well with Florence's voice , I know that's not totally reflected in my average because it's definitely long and interlude heavy

**Lilacly\_Adily** (8.760): I’ve learned with Florence‘s single’s I have to avoid until the full album is available because otherwise I’m underwhelmed and I don’t get the full picture. This album though is fantastic all the way through. It has musical nods to her past albums but really feels like a new, great entry into her discography.

**Stryxen** (8.647): florence is one of my most played artists ever, I was obsessed with her at the start of uni and now im finishing and I'm realising this album is great after dismissing it a bit. So I fear the obsessions is restarting

**nick1372** (8.567): A Florence and the Machine + Jack Antonoff team-up makes so much sense I'm surprised it hadn't happened before this. They help reign in each other's weaknesses (Jack's tendency for stripping back folksy ballads too much and Florence's tendency to drown herself out in the instrumentals) and both excel the most when embracing their tendencies for messy melodrama (lol). I'm a little less into the Dave Bayley contributions here but he succeeds in mixing it up in the second half when this sound would begin to get boring. This is Florence's most lyrically & thematically cohesive album ever and while I don't think it is as consistent in sound and overall quality as her best (HBHBHB), it reaches peaks that that album barely scratches at.

**uiscebeathaoir** (8.533): The Machine did a really good job here, don’t get me wrong. But this is Florence’s album through and through. Her presence really elevates every single song and her vocals are by far the best in the rate

**flava** (8.267): I'm very glad this album is being rated because it takes away an album that could feasibly be rated alongside Preacher’s Daughter and I will die before I see that album get a rate. I’m also glad because the album is great. Going over the madness inspired by lockdown while challenging gender roles, but now as more of an established legacy act and sort of institution, artists starting now are inspired by her.

**bogo** (8.267): yeah i like pop rock, baroque pop, progressive pop, alternative rock, gothic pop, folk, indie pop, disco, electronic, psychedelic, industrial, spoken word, glam rock, easy listening, dance-pop, sunshine pop, EDM, folk rock, gospel, synth-pop, experimental, post-punk, jangle, and electropop

**Poydoo** (8.007): maybe the

**jman457** (7.847): I’ve always wanted Florence to do more Dance/pop music since she slayed on Sweet Nothing, and I’m glad she gave a witchy good time here, with nice religious undertones as well.

**impla77** (7.827): I really like this album, upsettingly honest lyrically and with a lot of bops. idk, this shit just appeals to me

**plastichaxan** (7.807): Kinda glad this grew on me and now I see the vision and it looks like a greek banquet vibes type of scenery for girls gays and theys with wine to drink and sexual liberation with a side of that medieval fair scene in the love witch yup yup

**afs** (7.600): bit too long but florence is still mother (final rating = 8/10 without rating interludes and mermaids)

**alexismateofan** (7.600): I really feel like Florence + The Machine could have had something really great with this album as I felt it was hitting the right notes and felt a lot like my favorite album by her, Ceremonials. However, the interludes really shot this in the foot for me. That said, it has some of my all time favorite tracks on it. I just hope it makes it further than I expect it to.

**Nagisoid** (7.533): I used to listen to Florence a lot, therefore it's not surprising at all that she has my favorite project in the rate. Insert the "Dance Fever is a [lists like 20 different genres] album" wikipedia meme but I'm starting to believe they spilled a bit. It's an eclectic record for sure and it has my favorite lyrics by far, I scream the ones in Free and My Love daily. Anthemic for a reason! Weird and idiosyncratic when it needs to be too, just think some tracks could be removed.

**camerinian** (7.233): everyone’s gonna bring up antonoff discourse yet again for this one, yet we’re all gonna somehow ignore the fact that half of this album was also co-written by the glass animals geek

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.233): For an album called "Dance Fever" (that's supposedly themed around a deadly dancing disease), there's not really a whole lot of songs to dance to (except "My Love" I guess?)

**JIRACHI** (7.133): the concept and the aesthetics of this album>>> she's so mother for this

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.000): Oh Florence… I always think I like your music and then I listen to it and it just isn't my type. But at least your album has some bangers

**akanewasright** (6.920): I haven’t had much interest in Florence for a while - I was obsessed in middle school and then kind of left her music behind. I still like those first three records, but her later stuff just doesn’t do it for me that much, at least not as a whole. There are flashes of exciting stuff in the album, some stuff that would’ve thrilled 13 year old akane, and then some stuff that I don’t think I’d ever care for that much

**just\_thonking** (6.700): Tones and I voice dance fever dance fever dance fever oh oh oh

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6.340): why does this album give such "white woman learns to live laugh dance for the first time" vibes? how is it that you can listen to this and think "mother" but not "tory-ass daytime tv nonsense"? florence teams up with jack antonoff to do a "well off lady tries to invoke a Bildungsroman" type beat that has been an (under-acknowledged) sub theme/feature in a few of antonoff's latest floppers. & wow! the result is an exceptional yeah whatever album that more or less just filled 50 minutes between 4:20-5:10 one day. i fell asleep to a couple of these cuts even. its not really an impressive album and i dont really feel like im interested in learning about what this white lady is up to anymore :/

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.533): I started being an avid watcher of the Popheads Weekly Charts like 18 months ago, and sometime around then Florence’s album was there weekly. I didn’t care for the singles then and I think it was a foreboding sign that I would not like this album. And I do not! I’ve mainly enjoyed Florence’s earliest singles (the ones we all know) and never dove in and had an era with her. Not too keen on this album, something here often feels very plodding and heavy-handed art pop. This reminds me of other artists’ work and I prefer those albums. Would not be an album I return to I fear.

**IIIHenryIII** (5.500): well, I can dance to this, but it’s not the kind of dance that comes naturally.

**beeozan** (5.467): does this band have a real drummer or is it florence + the drum machine

**dream\_fighter2018** (5.167): maybe I was tired, but the mixing on this feels very loud, and some parts of it sound a bit muddled. I thought it was otherwise fine.

**vayyiqra** (5.133): The phenomenon of mass psychogenic behaviours is extremely interesting to me and has been for a long time. Sadly this album is not nearly as interesting to me despite liking the first three Florence albums a lot. A big letdown because the concepts of medievalism and religiosity could've been very interesting but I did not vibe with this at all.

**Roxieloxie** (3.947): I put off doing this rate for a long time, for a lot of reason but a large part of it was that I didnt want to listen to this album and well. Florence and the Machine is just not for me, I have only enjoyed florence when she was on sweet nothing and thats my flaw as a human being. She sounds very nice and she was doing alot of interesting things on the album just none of them were things I liked, except when she did the bleachers cosplay i fucked with that, but unfortunately it was very Not Me. I was very not into the atmosphere and vibe of the album personally

Memezaharamole: How are positivity/negativity scores calculated? What do they mean?  
Also, how do users rate the whole album with their average scores? The submission form just has the songs, is the album comment only during the reveal?
[/r/popheads/comments/14crgru/2022_anthemic_indie_pop_reveal_day_3_it_all_works/jonwg5a/]

=====

Awkward_King: i dont know how they are calculated, but the positivity/negativity scores essentially just show where you veered most from the general opinion, like a song that placed comparatively low to the positive score you gave it, and a song that placed high compared to the low score you gave it

and the album score is just an average of all the users' scores from their ballot. after the album title you can put a colon after the album title and write something and that will be your comment, like:

> Album: Dance Fever**: yass and slay music**
[/r/popheads/comments/14crgru/2022_anthemic_indie_pop_reveal_day_3_it_all_works/jooyhel/]

=====

TiltControls: If I remember correctly positivity and negativity are calculated by taking the difference of your scores from the song's final average (higher score than average for positivity and lower for negativity) and then adding those together for every song. The highest value is the one you had the largest difference in opinion in from everyone else.

Also for the album comments there's a spot at the top of each section of songs that'll say

> Album: Dance Fever

Or something similar

You can add a comment to that spot and it'll show up with your final average calculated by the machine. Like

> Album: Dance Fever: Some album comment

TiltControls: First off I want to thank u/BleepBloopMusicFan for being an absolutely amazing cohost and killing it with the OC, queup running, and ballot collection!! Very excited to see your hosting career flourish from here!

Now for the stats...
