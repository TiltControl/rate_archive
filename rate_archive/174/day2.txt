**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): What a cool song. Those HORNS. It doesn’t really fit too well onto the Dance Fever tracklist, but that’s okay because it’s a deluxe track! This song was Day 2 for basically the entire rate. It did drop into Day 1 towards the end of the submission period but was saved by our very last ballot, which swapped it with its fellow Britney-mentioning song.

**TiltControls** (7.5): Just think, if not for the last minute Florence addition we could’ve had another Maggie song escape day 1

---

## Under the sea

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this song is about killing people

**jman457** (10): A great inclusion to the album. Florence fits into dark wave so well

**phonethephoenix** (10): a banger. love the build up from the verse to the chorus

**runaway3212** (10): This is an ender

**seanderlust** (10): how many girls in London are currently using "you haven't seen nothing until you've seen an English girl drink" as their Insta bio

**uberpigeon** (10): flo proving again that her bonus tracks are her best

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): Seeing this live will change me, i already know

**savemeaseat143** (9.2): horn nation rise

**1998tweety** (9): we needed this on the little mermaid soundtrack

**JIRACHI** (9): https://www.allure.com/story/top-10-britney-spears-perfumes

**ReallyCreative** (9): we LOVE low brass yes absolutely

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Something about it feels a tad bit unfinished but other than that it slaps

**shhhneak** (9): [menacing trombone music]

**bogo** (8.5): sorry halle but why watch the little mermaid remake when i can just listen to this approximately 30 times instead

**Frajer** (8.5): I don't know what Britney Spears and coconuts smells like but I trust you bestie

**Stryxen** (8.5): pretty great I love you florence

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (8.2): this white lady was really trying to convince me that she could make a cut that would be better than MUNA for the circe movie that im brainstorming in my mind. kinda hate to admit...but yeah she really sort of almost stumbled into real big brain hours

**afs** (8): do you guys think she means coke not coconuts

**alexismateofan** (8): Cottagewhore Aesthetic boards WHEN.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this doesn’t sound it should be on the album but that’s okay cause it was a deluxe cut! Cause it’s neat otherwise

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): not the mouseketeers winner name drop

**akanewasright** (7.5): oh this is nice

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): "You haven't seen nothing 'til you've seen an English girl drink" has got to be one of the best lyrics on this album ever

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): what is this blackpink instrumental

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): sea showtune serving cunt (buzzwords for the sake of buzzwords)

**flava** (7): deluxe tracks that are placed somewhere in between the songs of standard tracklist of an album deserve nothing but the worst

## Landlubbers

**Quiet-Tone13** (6.5): I love parts of this song (the brass that comes in, the verses), but it doesn't come together into a whole that works well. It feels like it's building to a moment that never comes.

**impla77** (6): yeah i can see why this was cut initially, strong idea but doesn’t quite come together

**scythersboots** (6): i have exceeded exhaustion at this point in the album.

**slimboyfriend** (6): who knew there’d be two Britney references in an anthemic indie pop rate

**welcome2thejam** (6): Sounds big, but never really hooked me

**Awkward\_King** (5): girl u not halle bailey

**homestarguy** (5): Very topical song given what’s in the damn theaters right now!!

**Roxieloxie** (5): i actually rated half of this album while making a mermaidsona on dolldivine

**Nagisoid** (4): Halle outsold

**kappyko** (3): blood on the leaves

**beeozan** (2): did she actually say cottage hoe? narrator voice: she actually said cottage whore ok we hate potential double entendre

**camerinian** (2): no those farty horns what, why

**IIIHenryIII** (2): this song is just making me think of oblivion by grimes and I can’t help but wish to be listening to that instead of this

**Poydoo** (0): and shitty lyrics too

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This isn’t nearly as big and flashy as some of the better performing songs on Maggie’s album, so I kinda get why it’s here. But…it sounds so good! And it makes me feel warm and fuzzy! The production is just full and dynamic enough to keep the song interesting while maintaining the soothing, relaxed atmosphere. Take a breath…take a breath…

**TiltControls** (8.5): Another Maggie track that took a little bit to grow on me, but now I really love the production on it. I feel like it could’ve gone a bit further with the ending, but Maggie sounds great and the track brings out a great vibe to her voice.

---

## Classicalheads

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is the album cut that immediately captured me, the last moments when it slows down are soooooo good

**Poydoo** (10): "dee dee dee dee dee"

**RandomHypnotica** (10): god dammit anxiety bops are my kryptonite

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): butterflies in your stomach who?

**savemeaseat143** (9.2): what a lovely song

**alexismateofan** (9): We stan people going to therapy.

**beeozan** (9): nice symphony of synths there

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): prettiest song ever

**homestarguy** (9): You’re telling me there wasn’t a Dessner on this track????

**ReallyCreative** (9): this song doesn't feel super cohesive to the rest of the album, but it's one of the more interesting sonically

**1998tweety** (8.5): ended that fad zara

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): my favorite part is the second verse!

**nick1372** (8): The vocal melodies and whatever that instrumentation is in the chorus are so sticky they just scratch my brain in the right way

**scythersboots** (8): i feel like this song has an unfair placement on this album, buried so deep but its imo one of the more interesting ones/what i’d expect from Maggie, musically

**camerinian** (7.5): i actually really dig how the electronics are integrated back into the rock edge here, like they’re not overbearing and there’s a surprising tonal match that slides it straight into the sonic palette. It’s small things like that which keep the album fresh

**jman457** (7.2): nice little dreamy vibes

**afs** (7): I LOVE LUSH LIFE

**Nagisoid** (7): Zara Fadsson & Mid Bandit WHO?

## You stan Zara Larsson!

**Lilacly\_Adily** (6.2): another filler song. If I didn’t know any better I’d think was the album closer because of the extended outro

**CrimsonROSET** (6): im sorry the last minute you lost me

**Stryxen** (6): its nice but doesnt stick out

**uiscebeathaoir** (6): Enjoyable if I don’t focus on the buzzing production that much

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6): her backing track is basically a seefeel cut but it also turns into a sleepy cut

**impla77** (5.8): Just kinda forgettable

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): I was starting to feel like this one was overstaying its welcome only to realize there were 2 whole minutes left

**runaway3212** (5): okay fun part's over

**Awkward\_King** (4): okayyyyy

**shesdoingyoga** (4): I think I’ve fallen asleep to this before

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Yeah this is my least favorite song on MUNA and, IMO, should definitely not have beaten some of their Day 1 songs. To me, it’s just a little too messy. But I do respect the horniness of it all and so did the raters, at least enough to get it into Day 2.

**TiltControls** (5): This song is a little too all over the place for me. Like the had no idea how to pace it properly. There are nice moments during the song - I particularly like the backing guitar, but I find some of the sounds are a bit too harsh to work with the track.

---

## Inspired

**1998tweety** (10): the amount of cunt that was served here...

**alexismateofan** (10): Finally a pussy popping song in the indie rate.

**cremeebrulee** (10): ofc mitski wrote the horniest song on this album

**CrimsonROSET** (10): me when someone asks why i was on tumblr in 2016 and i say voltron and they go ‘oh cool!’

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): -me making shit up- this is industrial

**Frajer** (10): this is the diary of Muna

**phonethephoenix** (10): i like the way it sounds!

**seanderlust** (10): this is the thirstiest track i've ever heard and it is fantastic

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Horny anthem

**Shay\_Min** (9.4): BUT THAT BEAT???

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): i know they have a desparate need to touch some boobies

**Poydoo** (9): that synth is great

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): That descending bassline in the chorus goes hard

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (8.5): this is the "we fuck" cut. huge W for MUNA's credit as a band that doesn't just make big sound anthemic pop, but as real clubbers who love living life!

**nick1372** (8): autotune slay i guess

**runaway3212** (8): This album does everything saves the world lite but it really works on this song

**jman457** (7.7): Cure synthy song

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): 🚫👁️🦌

**scythersboots** (7.4): i really like parts of this song and totally think they nailed capturing the 90s boy band sound

**beeozan** (7): alexa play toy soldier by britney spears

## Unsure

**afs** (6.5): me giving scores

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): oh, I think I do

**Lilacly\_Adily** (6.5): this song makes me think of the backstreet boys

**dream\_fighter2018** (6): the last thirty seconds are fun, but the rest of it is a bit of a yawn.

**Nagisoid** (6): Finding out Mitski co-wrote this is so surreal like it reads nothing like her but ok

**vayyiqra** (6): What is "virgin in the Biblical sense" is that like the infamous translation of Mary being a virgin when the word was more like "young woman"

**welcome2thejam** (6): Yeah, I can definitely hear the 90s boy band influence

**flava** (5.5): this and Solid being right next to each other is tragic because both just blend into each other

**Awkward\_King** (5): at random moments the song like really brings me in then it loses me again and i dont know what the common theme of those moments is

**camerinian** (4): girl what the hell happens to the production in this chunk of the album

**homestarguy** (4): Decent groove but questionable and obnoxious choices were made here otherwise lol

**TiltControls** (8.5): Though I sometimes forget this song exists, I really enjoy it whenever it comes on. I guess it’s just outshined by the rest of the album but given how much I enjoy Surrender that’s not necessarily a bad thing here.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Ngl I’ve forgotten that this song existed when listening to the album multiple times. But it’s always a pleasant surprise when I get to it! This placement feels pretty correct to me.

## Buzz Buzz

**Awkward\_King** (10): perched for the 7 minute mariah interlude we will be wooting

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this is what popheads believe Miley achieved with Plastic Hearts

**runaway3212** (10): Where was this energy for like the entire album

**savemeaseat143** (9.4): she's so real for this song

**homestarguy** (9): Well I’m glad this song wasn’t called “Vinegar”

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): bey won the honey off that day but this is still pretty great

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (8.4): yo where da fuck does that hook-laden melody pre-chrous come from!?! like shit that gripped me right until we fell off a cliff into silence. true honey shit

**jman457** (8.2): Fun little alt rock track

**1998tweety** (8): she ate

**alexismateofan** (8): Feels the most like it could have been on her previous album.

**bogo** (8): did you know it's scientifically impossible for a song called honey to be bad, it's true i have yet to come across one that disproves this

**CrimsonROSET** (8): !r1

**Nagisoid** (8): There's a Good Reason These Tables are Numbered, You Just Haven't Thought of It Yet

**phonethephoenix** (8): pretty good!!

**Stryxen** (8): something about a song called honey

**afs** (7.5): never forget ROByn

**bigbigbee** (7): magic bullet title for a song, tbh, I don’t think any song called Honey has ever been bad

**RandomHypnotica** (7): we need to ban people from using Honey and Stranger as song titles

**scythersboots** (7): relatable as an older sibling/perma mom friend

**shesdoingyoga** (7): I like to listen to albums all the way through when I’m not listening to a random playlist and this is the point where Maggie starts to lose me, I struggle to focus on the last 3 songs on the album when they’re on. That being said, Honey has definitely grown on me since the album dropped

## Not the bees!

**camerinian** (6.5): there’s good stuff here but oooh boy the millennial whoops are still a thing huh

**JIRACHI** (6): Mariah outsold

**welcome2thejam** (6): Sounds big but not fully clicking with me as much as I'd expect

**Lilacly\_Adily** (5): a bit of a filler song

**Poydoo** (5): boringe

**seanderlust** (0): i don't know what it is about the "honey if i knew i would have told you" line that makes me hate it so much but there's something there

**TiltControls** (7): I feel like I enjoy this cover the more I try to forget that it’s supposed to be a cover. There are great covers out there that can do a full vibe swap, but I don’t know if it fully worked out here. Florence sounds good though.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Yeaaaah this is probably my least favorite Florence song in the rate, behind Restraint even. I respect that she took the song in a really different direction, but, IMO, it just REALLY doesn’t work and robs the original of what it made it so enjoyable and infectious.

---

## No doubt this is a good cover

1998tweety (10): ate

bogo (10): fantano was so wrong for shitting on this cover

phonethephoenix (10): listen i think this is an excellent cover and does something interesting with an already great song i promise this isn't just yellowjackets brain. the mood works and i love the overall momentum of the song

savemeaseat143 (9.4): Florence was made for this song

Frajer (9): one of my favorite singers singing one of my favorite songs

PrimaryCrusaders (9): This is such a dope cover my god. The original still remains supreme but this cover is definitely up there.

Awkward\_King (8.5): gay people keep telling me to watch yellowjackets

RandomHypnotica (8.2): why did the first half of this have to sound like that...

alexismateofan (8): This might be the hardest song to rank for me. And it’s a bonus song, I hate this planet. I’m giving it what it gets as I mentally go back and forth between it and the original for weeks.

jman457 (7.6): I really need to watch yellowjackets

afs (7.5): unexpected

cremeebrulee (7): oh the beginning is kinda rough

Nagisoid (7): As a Talk Talk stan, it's time someone made a cover of a No Doubt song I can say is better as retribution

shhhneak (7): Being a Florence Stan means being able to admit that sometimes she just be covering anything.

## Misogyny

IIIHenryIII (5): this tv show is on my watchlist. I wish I had more time…

scythersboots (5): extremely movie trailer fodder

seanderlust (5): Eh, this works less than I was expecting it to tbh

welcome2thejam (4): Good news! I have finally read the rate post and now know the bonus rate theme is partially covers! Bad news! I still physically recoiled at the start!

WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine (2.5): getting real joker vibes here (also im not endorsing covering gwen stefani for fucking yellowjackets. no)

darjeelingdarkroast (1): No Doubt was my favorite band in middle school. Fuck Gwen Stefani, but this cover is overblown and hollow garbaj. And it’s like the fifth best song off Tragic Kingdom, if they had covered Sunday Morning I’d be on the set of Yellowjackets protesting lol

InSearchOfGoodPun (1): terrible cover of a cool song

**TiltControls** (10): Probably my favourite track on the album honestly. As a midnight cereal enjoyer it just speaks to me.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Another placement I’m pretty okay with.  I do really like this song and appreciate the sentiment of it, but sonically it’s not one of my absolute favorites. Cereal tho? Cereal gets an easy 10 at ANY time of day.

---

## Euphoria

**Quiet-Tone13** (11): The rage and despair built into this song are what make me love it. The lyrics are so vulnerable and relatable.

**alexismateofan** (10): This song is more Final Fantasy coded than the Stand By Me cover

**CrimsonROSET** (10): what did you choose florence

**ReallyCreative** (10): the feminine urge to kill God

**savemeaseat143** (10): this song makes me want to cry

**shhhneak** (10): OH GOD YOU’RE GONNA GET IT

**Stryxen** (10): and its good to be alive crying into cereal at midnight.

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): as a fellow midnight cereal enjoyer, I feel seen

**Lilacly\_Adily** (9.5): I really like this song but I hate the line about Tom Vek. It’s so clunky to me so I always try to skip it. I also love the ending golden voice

**nick1372** (9.5): That opening line. Mass carnage, 35 dead 233 injured.

**flava** (9): leading your entire gender into a war against god because of a pandemic is a big mood actually

**impla77** (9): I’m gonna pretend the outro isn’t part of this :)

**runaway3212** (9): top 10 anime battles

**Poydoo** (8.9): when she cried in the cereal, i felt that fr

**afs** (8.5): this is pagan poetry

**Frajer** (8.5): I hope the music from 2006 that makes her kind of sick isn't Fergalicious and Promiscuous

**plastichaxan** (8.5): Religious trauma making great art yup

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Crying into cereal at breakfast is better

**1998tweety** (8): the girls are girling

**jman457** (7.8): Builds really well nice twang

**phonethephoenix** (7.7): i like it!

**bogo** (7.5): hell yeah let's get blasphemous

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): this sounds like a club at McKinley High

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): this is not dramatic enough for a florence track

**IIIHenryIII** (7): girl, what ya listening from 2006 that makes you sick? cause I honestly have a blast streaming The Black Parade; Taking The Long Way; B'Day; Sinners Like Me; Loose; FutureSex/LoveSounds; Taylor Swift; Begin To Hope; Stand Still, Look Pretty; The Avalanche; I'm Not Dead…

**jackisboredtoday** (7): good song but doesn’t live up to the serve the title promises

**Nagisoid** (7): I'd join her but I'm not a girl

**slimboyfriend** (7): obsessed with being “another screaming speck of dust”

## Dust in the wind

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6.9): big music

**akanewasright** (6.5): This is fine but like… almost feels like a waste of a title that cool

**beeozan** (6): oh oh i think im hearing smtn

**welcome2thejam** (6): Commit heresy, queen

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): i like the sound of this but i dislike the lyrics, too on-the-nose

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): are her vocals at the back of the mix or am I losing it

**JIRACHI** (4): okay???

**vayyiqra** (4): edgy

**Awkward\_King** (2): for a title this cunty im really not GAGged

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): My other poor meow meow in this rate. Like Loose Garment, this song gives me major feels and was one of the leading contenders for my 11. One of the major complaints about this song, and really a lot of the album, was Maggie’s rough and unwieldy vocals. But that’s what makes this song so excellent to me! She knows how to make a song you can scream-sing along to in the car. If your voice starts going a little rogue on you, well, then that just makes it fit better! Oh raters, why couldn’t you just….GIVE IIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNN??

**TiltControls** (9): Maggie’s having a rough go today huh. Though it was a single I’m not too surprised this didn’t make it further. I feel it gets forgotten in those discussions a lot. Although it’s a gorgeous sounding track, it doesn’t really have as much going for it as the preceding tracks on the album.

---

## Jockeys

**camerinian** (11): why did this song, which I had never heard before this rate and didn’t seem to have much in the way of fan hype, hit me so hard? The encapsulation of a yearning for freedom obviously isn’t a new topic, but the idea of wanting freedom but fearing doing it alone is a dichotomy that, when Maggie sells it with so much pain and passion and fragility, hits me like a freight train. Maggie’s vocal delivery on this is so peerless as well, like I’m not huge on oversinging, but every extended note and half-yell is done in the service of conveying a desperation that is just so perfectly pitched. I have no idea if people see anything in this song or if it’s just gonna be a standard day two ballad, but I adore this track and it’s one of my favourite rating surprises in recent memory.

**IIIHenryIII** (11): this is one of the best songs ever made, and I know I say this for a lot of songs, but this time I swear it is not hyperbole. She delivered such a raw performance with her vocals that I feel like this is the first time I have felt sincere, emotional pain in someone else’s voice. This is such an amazing track. I feel like crying listening to it, but at the same time it brings me so much joy. Maggie could murder a baby, and I still would be thankful for her crafting such a brilliant song.

**1998tweety** (10): i dont know what she means but im living

**Awkward\_King** (10): july 29th was so rough for maggie omg same night as bey and bey had the more relevant horse...

**CrimsonROSET** (10): sad yeehaw

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this comment section is about to be a horsegirl convention

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): second best song in the rate

**JIRACHI** (10): that is a lot of emotions for horses

**nick1372** (10): My friend thinks this song sounds like Christian girl music ("Would you come with me? To find God?" were her exact words) so now this song is about God eating Maggie out I don't make the rules

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Horse Girl Anthem

**shhhneak** (10): Horse girl representation is so important in this day and age.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): https://media.tenor.co/videos/ae8c9d4aa0d83994b120ad24511fc2b6/mp4

**welcome2thejam** (10): It's horse time

**phonethephoenix** (9.5): evocative! great vocal performance!

**alexismateofan** (9): There is a girl holding the vinyl of this album, playing this song, and crying on her bed. That girl? Me.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (9): tbh this song is on a driving playlist but I also skip it around mixed company bc of the line about giving head

**scythersboots** (9): incredible that she did the vocals in one take. It definitely gives “my voice is my instrument”

**savemeaseat143** (8.8): horsegirl era

**Frajer** (8.5): Maggie being a horse girl is the least surprising reveal

**seanderlust** (8.5): https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/034/854/man.jpg

**Stryxen** (8.5): GIVE IIIIIINNNNNNnnnnNnnnnn

**beeozan** (8): a horse. a horse. my kingdom for a horse

**ReallyCreative** (8): ketamine joke!

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): Honestly I hate horses, but I do like this song

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): so much fell into place realizing maggie was a horse girl tbh

**Poydoo** (7.5): horese

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (7.4): this is not a ditty i would listen to while trying to break horses in red dead redemption tbh

**jman457** (7): alright little torch song

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): WHAT are you imagining girl?

## Equinophobia

**afs** (6.5): i KNEW it shes a horsegirl (compliment)!

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I always knew she was a horse girl. Her fans give big reformed horse girl energy

**bigbigbee** (6): There was like a period of 10 years there where songs just didn’t mention horses, after a period where a LOT of songs did. I’m glad that Maggie is bringing it back.

**impla77** (6): I can HEAR the emotion but i can’t FEEL the emotion :(

**RandomHypnotica** (5.2): i'm sorry but as an australian i have a civil duty to not support songs called horses not by Daryl Braithwaite

**Nagisoid** (5): Stream Horses by Patti Smith instead (we robbed Gloria so hard last time, it's tragic)

**runaway3212** (5): why are all these tracks so long

**plastichaxan** (4.5): The effect of certain songs feeling extremely long should be studied I was tired of this one and then I went to check and I wasn’t even 3 full minutes in but then it got like really good 4 minutes in what’s up with that

**vayyiqra** (4): yeehaw

**flava** (2.5): I’m really frustrated with this song, there is a part of me that just wants to love it, but she sounds so strained in the mix, and not in a good way, in the way that makes me feel this yearning that Horses desperately wants to have just falls flat. And the way her vocals are mixed don’t help her, like if they just hid her shortcomings in the mix, and maybe placed more emphasis on the atmosphere then this could’ve been great because there is a really good melody here

**kappyko** (2): Mudkip — 07/14/2022 12:41 PM she just screams about horses for what felt like 5 mins

**letsallpoo** (2): does she know what she sounds like

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Look who finally decided to show up again!  This is definitely one of my favorites on Laurel Hell, with its simultaneously very beautiful but very dark instrumental and vivid, haunting lyrics (no surprise from Mitski - she almost always delivers on the lyrics). I’m happy that this was able to do significantly better than the slow Mitski songs that were eliminated yesterday. Also shoutout to her for promoting a fellow rate album in this song!

**TiltControls** (10): Though I liked the synthy direction that Mitski took more for this album, I was really hoping they’d be more of this darker vibe. Mitski’s fantastic at painting a story with her delivery here, despite any big bombastic moments it’s just as (if not more) captivating as many of the other tracks on the album.

---

## Thunderous applause

**1998tweety** (10): idk what this genre of song is but it makes me ascend

**Awkward\_King** (10): i remember when this first came out and u/buddhacharm (hi bestie) described it as a song "perfect for a summer storm" and that really stuck with me cause like.. yeah! it is

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): album highlight, what I’d love for an album full of Working for the Knifes and Heat Lightning (to the sub’s chagrin sob) Very menacing and cinematic.

**just\_thonking** (10): I love the velvet underground

**Stryxen** (10): this changed me when it came out I remember listening on loop alongside the new beach house singles when it was stormy and dark so early in the evening and it was a very strong feeling of … something…

**akanewasright** (9.5): it’s so pretty I’m gonna die

**phonethephoenix** (9.5): not much i can say but that this song is great!

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): unlike 80% of people who saw mitski live in 2022 I personally had a great time?? i was vibing i found a gaggle of lesbians and we chilled out the entire night. This one live really made it click for me I love the desperation tinged hope that the chorus seems laced with and how its drawn out. Its just wonderful

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): I love semi-obscure weather references

**alexismateofan** (9): I’m getting actual goosebumps.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): god whats that one mario kart/wii song that uses those background synths that i keep thinking this is gonna turn into

**nick1372** (9): This is so gorgeously hypnotizing

**savemeaseat143** (9): gorgeous song

**Poydoo** (8.5): those synth beats are super cool

**Nagisoid** (8): Sounds extremely close to Venus in Furs (especially in the intro), everybody stream The Velvet Underground & Nico's debut album, it created all your faves 🤭

**scythersboots** (8): this song does actually feel anthemic.

**uberpigeon** (8): this is like the one good slow song on the album

**afs** (7.5): lightning is 30k degrees celsius btw

## Absolutely shocked

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6.9): like its stronger than the showtune cowboy ditty on the last album (gives western vibes) but also its more funny than good that mitski times part of this for a dance break bridge.

**runaway3212** (6.5): this is fine as they say

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): she’s about to say yeehaw

**homestarguy** (6): Who are “Two teams who won’t be winning a championship this month?”

**IIIHenryIII** (6): “I surrender”, oh, that won’t work on me, Miss. I see you using Maggie in an attempt to brainwash me into liking your music better.

**welcome2thejam** (6): The keys coming in was gorgeous

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): way too short and incomplete

**jman457** (5.3): probs the least fav of the pre-release singles

**beeozan** (5): its not crash lightning at least

**bogo** (5): just call this "lightning" cause she brought no heat here

**shesdoingyoga** (5): suffers from its position in the track list for me, I just don’t want to hear this after suffering through Everyone

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.5): I dunno, I'm not feeling this one.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Ugh this song being Day 3 and often top 10 for the first third of the submissions…we were about to kill balladphobia for good, but then we lost it!

**TiltControls** (9.5): This was day 3 (and even top 10!) for a bit of time so I was a little hopeful it could stay there. Unfortunately it just wasn’t meant to be and instead we’ve got it leaving mid-day 2. This track really grew on me throughout the rate. Florence nails these softer tracks on the album and it’s a fantastic song lyrically too.

---

## :yassgrenade:

**seanderlust** (11): devastating. also okay don't at me for bringing her into this conversation but i get big Sweet Nothing vibes (the midnights track) from this. but lyrically i like this a lot better

**alexismateofan** (10): Would you level an entire city for a girl?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this was nice thank u

**impla77** (10): This reminds me I have to watch Dr Strangelove

**musical\_pyn** (10): I know this will probably go day 1 but this might be my favorite song on this album; it's just so pure and simple and devastating as only florence can be

**phonethephoenix** (10): sweet musically and i love the lyrics

**RandomHypnotica** (10): stripped back florence absolutely devastates me

**ReallyCreative** (10): this was what inspired Oppenheimer

**runaway3212** (10): me

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I find this one to be super underrated, it’s so pretty and sad

**shhhneak** (10): Halsey after Pitchfork rated this album a 7.1.

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): me when I'm Dr. Strangelove and someone asks me what I have learned to love

**Stryxen** (9.7): my friend melody would love this song

**savemeaseat143** (9.5): ouch!

**bogo** (9): love that drum hit when she sings "bodies hit the floor", we love it when the music matches the lyrics

**Frajer** (9): the carnivorous flower is Audrey II

**Poydoo** (9): This song is pretty good. In fact, you might even say it's "very good"

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): Has some of my favourite lyrics on the album. It’s not Mitski level or anything, but it really gets to me

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Ok Jewrence! Uh… Flor… wel? You know what never mind

**welcome2thejam** (9): Beautiful instrumentals

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**camerinian** (8): hope you play Bucketheads for the Queup interlude, and if not, please play Bucketheads for the Queup interlude

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i can love both why not

**flava** (8): :wane:

**Nagisoid** (8): Gays describing Bionic by Christina Aguilera:

**uberpigeon** (8): oppenheimer be like

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): okayyyy self sabotage anthem

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): the pin is evidently still on the yass grenade but she's cute

**nick1372** (7.5): Lowest common denominator Florence & Jack collab. Mistki has done this "abusive relationship song but it's actually about my relationship with music" like a dozen times and it's usually more interesting than this. I still can't help but like it though.

**afs** (7): boom clap sound of my heart

**kappyko** (7): Vine boom

**scythersboots** (7): like, painfully intimate

## Cut the wire

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): bombed and panned

**jman457** (6.5): nice restrained moment on the album but wished it built to something more explosive…?

**homestarguy** (6): Oh yeah Jewel is back baby

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6): yup. that's a real one

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.5): Oh it's gonna bomb alright

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): I’m the bomb.com 😎

**beeozan** (4): its not da bomb

**IIIHenryIII** (3): I usually love ballads, but this time I’m rooting for balladphobia

**TiltControls** (7.5): Honestly if this didn’t say cover in the song title I probably wouldn’t have noticed a thing. The song itself feels like classic Mitski in terms of vibe and delivery and was a pretty good choice to cover. I don’t care for the song itself much besides that, but it’s solid.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): My two lowest bonus scores going out in a row. This is nice enough I guess but to me it’s just a significantly worse sounding version of the original, which is really lovely.

---

## Soaring, Flying

Nagisoid (10): Lily Chou-Chou deserves the world. Please listen to their only album if you have the time, it's straight up one of the best and most accessible dream pop projects of all time and I love it so much. The Lily Chou-Chou movie is great too if you're interested in that. I prefer the original but honestly Mitski still kills it.

scythersboots (9): why is this better than most of the album lol

phonethephoenix (8.2): pretty!!

afs (8): i juuuust gliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide

Awkward\_King (8): colin farrell the man that you are

jman457 (7.7): a cool cover that feels more shoegaze

shhhneak (7.6): The Letterboxd girlies already knew.

TiltControls (7.5): Honestly if this didn’t say cover in the song title I probably wouldn’t have noticed a thing. The song itself feels like classic Mitski in terms of vibe and delivery and was a pretty good choice to cover. I don’t care for the song itself much besides that, but it’s solid.

WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine (7.5): mitski wow what a great voice thank you for lending it to this cover

## Grounded

alexismateofan (7): It’s still a good song, I just had hoped Mitski would put more of a twist on it from the original. They sound different but like… not different enough?

vayyiqra (7): i have tried to get into that lily chou-chou album, partly because it was supposedly inspired by faye wong (who i love, but the music sounds nothing like hers) and it's not my thing ... however this is pretty alright i guess. interesting song for her to cover

IIIHenryIII (5): not my cup of tea

**TiltControls** (10): It does feel very opener-y, but it does a fantastic job at setting the tone for the album. This stellar opening stretch of songs was probably my favourite in 2022.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Even though it’s not my favorite song on the album, Overdrive works extremely well as an opener to Surrender, setting the mood perfectly while being a really good song in its own right. I almost appreciate that it’s not a 10. With what’s coming in the next several tracks, it’s good to warm up before the slay really kicks into…well you know.

---

## Driven to joy

**savemeaseat143** (10): Car metaphor !!

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): me when I procrastinate

**plastichaxan** (9.5): Hate listening to a song and it making me think of someone with the lyrics we know it’s bad for me girl

**shhhneak** (9.5): Driver’s License girl has been real quiet since this dropped.

**beeozan** (9): hua hua hua

**phonethephoenix** (9): yess love the buildup with the guitar

**shesdoingyoga** (9): A solid opener, definitely lets you know it won’t sound exactly like her last album

**flava** (8.5): at least she put her best foot forward

**impla77** (8.2): I feel like this almost reaches something, but not quite??

**1998tweety** (8): cute opener

**bigbigbee** (8): a much worse alternate universe where everything is exactly the same but Maggie sings “uwu” in this song instead of “uwa”

**homestarguy** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOHG392OH54

**Nagisoid** (8): Car-centric bop

**Poydoo** (8): "uwa uwa uwa"

**Stryxen** (8): so good

**uiscebeathaoir** (8): The vocalisations get annoying but she serves when she’s singing actual words

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (7.8): she sorta rushes in that chorus to a big sound that i wish she's just keep the energy on simmer. im not kidding! it just sounds better to me than the big sweeping line. but also, i was sorta drawn in to whatever aggie rogers was going on about wrt overdrive. real wine mom moment here

**jman457** (7.6): solid opening

**afs** (7.5): i hate driving too

**camerinian** (7.5): not quite maximum overdrive but definitely not regretting passing on the turbo

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.5): i think it’s a cute intro, nothing too special but you can’t just put your magnum opus at the start of the album like..

**scythersboots** (7.5): its giving cell phone commercial / knockoff U2

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): why is a song called overdrive so flat

**alexismateofan** (7): The way this felt like 30 mph. But like in a good way.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this opening track means idk how to score it

**runaway3212** (7): a good opener

## Driven away

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): i mean its fine but conan gray kinda outsold

**akanewasright** (6): ooh wah ig

**Awkward\_King** (6): a nice album opener that i dont really come to on its own but its really good so i should change that

**uberpigeon** (6): this song wants to be bros by wolf alice so bad

**welcome2thejam** (5): Did like the guitar coming in to help bolster the bridge, couldn't save it though

**JIRACHI** (4): gia gunn i was so bored

**nick1372** (4): the concept of being in overdrive is so cliche'd and lame to me. It has no depth to it, and is absolutely not worth basing a song around. Maggie has to wail all around it to make it mean anything and it still does not work.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Of course, I very much appreciate all of our participants who took the time to submit a ballot. Love you all for that so much. But also…booooo! Boo this placement! The first verse...what else can I say except the girls that get it get it!

**TiltControls** (9): There’s not really much to this song other than it just being a ton of fun. Some of the lines are a little clunky, and the production is a little basic - but that doesn’t make it any less fun.

---

## Perfectly sized

**Awkward\_King** (10): so many fucking horses in this damn rate. horse girl central.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it's ok Katie, u/cremeebrulee thinks everything regular sized is high

**ReallyCreative** (10): just iconic

**scythersboots** (10): I thought this one was going to be my 11 but…i have a feeling it doesn’t need my 11 to thr11ve in this rate

**shesdoingyoga** (10): The opening lines have been rent free in my head for months

**shhhneak** (10): this was my top song on Spotify in 2022 because I replayed the first verse 79 times on the day it dropped. Not even slightly exaggerating. The high horse to carousel ride word play journey is camp perfection.

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): regular sized horse owners are my favorite people

**phonethephoenix** (9.8): they're so right for this one. and it's catchy too!

**Poydoo** (9.5): -0.5 points for that shitty fade out

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): basically the mood with my extremely recent ex I kinda want to stay friends with

**savemeaseat143** (9.1): we love being unbothered

**alexismateofan** (9): More break up songs like this!!!!

**Frajer** (9): I bet you think you're John Wayne showing up and shooting down everybody

**Nagisoid** (9): I thought they were going to cover High Horse by Kacey Musgraves for a second but this is slay too

**nick1372** (9): When they pulled out the fucking inflatable ponies on tour I almost passed out laughing

**slimboyfriend** (9): I guess they’re not fans of Kacey Musgraves…

**impla77** (8.6): ended kacey musgroves

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**cremeebrulee** (8): “i think my horse is regular sized” feels like midnights-brand lyricism

**homestarguy** (8): I’m so ready to be done with the 80s sound palette for awhile, but what can I say, I’m a sucker for a nice 12/8 groove

**IIIHenryIII** (8): that pony line is so cringe, and I love cringe

**Stryxen** (8): she's mid but i like her

**welcome2thejam** (8): Just solid good-mood anthemic indie pop (Woah! That's the name of this rate!)

**just\_thonking** (7.5): high horse line is goated idc idc

**afs** (7): welllll

**camerinian** (7): i also often need to reassure people that i think mine it’s regular sized (post-edit: jesus christ what am i doing)

## Anything but this

**CrimsonROSET** (7): bless their heart kinda song

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6.3): boom stomp synthclap ass cut

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): it’s a little generic i fear

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This whole album is just girlboss anthem after girlboss anthem

**akanewasright** (5): This being their follow up to silk chiffon has always confused me, especially after more singles and the full album came out

**kappyko** (4): IIRC MUNA hyped up the first verse so much only for it to have the worst lyrics of all time

**vayyiqra** (4): That opening verse is awful and really tested my "songs with shuffle beats are always bangers" hypothesis

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): the other song off this album that made me think “MUNA are ridiculously overhyped what are y’all doing” turns out I like MUNA! Not this song tho!! it’s such a nothingburger why was this chosen as a single lkdslksd

**uiscebeathaoir** (3): my least favourite single in the rate. I personally try to avoid skipping songs at all when listening to albums no matter my feelings, but this is a skip

**runaway3212** (1): This horrible song with the worst intro line of any song in 2022

**jman457** (0): I found this kind of corny tbh

**lexiaredery** (0): Most of the song isn't that bad but I can't get through the first verse

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): We love a song that starts in Day 2 and just never leaves. The platonic ideal of a rate performance.

**TiltControls** (8): It’s giving great ‘dancing in a field at midnight’ vibes to it, whatever that might mean.

---

## Flower power

**1998tweety** (10): idk what a daffodil has to do with this but im living

**cremeebrulee** (10): daffodil

**nick1372** (10): It's so funny that Florence was like "I can't make a song where the chorus is just me saying Daffodil over and over again" and her collaborators had to tell her that she is Florence and the Machine and she can do whatever she wants

**shesdoingyoga** (10): The way this song builds makes me levitate

**shhhneak** (9.4): This song feels like if you were in an explosive car crash driving off a cliff on Mars.

**phonethephoenix** (9.1): she's so right!!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): movie trailer music but its a sapphic spy movie with flowers as a motif and maaaybe it takes place in spain? i see the vision someone hire me

**Frajer** (9): in her witch era

**impla77** (9): TIL that daffodils are narcissi!

**JIRACHI** (9): fun fact daffodils are my favorite flowers just putting it out there

**camerinian** (8.5): i wasn’t sold on this until that drummer started going fucking feral at the end, then it all clicked into place

**plastichaxan** (8.5): I wish this had maintained the energy from the beginning of the song

**Stryxen** (8.5): so disney villain coded and then the outro is extremely movie trailer core. Both of those things are good

**alexismateofan** (8): Love a song with a cute title that’s actually completely fucked up.

**bogo** (8): gonna tell a nine inch nails fan i like industrial music and then show them this song

**Nagisoid** (8): Huh I thought that was the name of a prescription drug or something

**RandomHypnotica** (8): movie-trailer core

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's good but it just doesn't compare to Cassandra and I feel like both songs are trying to do the same thing

**Poydoo** (7.8): cool 👍

**afs** (7.5): oh shit its going to get bad for daffy

**scythersboots** (7.5): very good-middling, kind of what i’d expect from this album

**kappyko** (7): outro is the best thing on this album so +1 point

**runaway3212** (7): this is kinda boring as well but the ending slays

**welcome2thejam** (7): This used to be a lower score but I got to the hype ass ending with them hammering on the drums

## Weeding

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6.9): need a samba remix. this is close to being a fairy tale banger

**jman457** (6.6): I felt like I should have liked it more but its just not clicking

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): welsh pride (im not welsh)

**vayyiqra** (6): idk anymore okay I am not enjoying this album nor its lyrics much at all but since daffodil=narcissus stream kimbra the golden echo (title also a reference to the same myth)

**IIIHenryIII** (5): ok, witc-, I mean, wizard

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): the production on this is really annoying, and I find it otherwise disjointed and just… not good.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is definitely my favorite deepcut on MUNA (maybe even my favorite song outright?) I love those loud ass synths, give me ALL the loud ass synths! Before the rate opened I was really hoping that this would sneak into Day 3. It turns out this song is not as beloved as I thought because uh…it was actually never Day 3 at any point. Dang.

**TiltControls** (7): I get the vibe it’s going for, but I don’t love the odd drops it took to get there. Solid song, but compared to others in the rate I don’t really care for it a ton.

---

## Speedsters

**static\_int\_husp** (11): quick question, when this album came out I was in a (seemingly) healthy relationship and yet this song resonated with me most on the album. That's good, right?

**uiscebeathaoir** (11): Listening to this song for the first time was a revelation. It may have shrunk on me a bit, but that just shows how much I used to worship this song

**beeozan** (10): stream runners high by the pillows (or larc en ciel). omg hyperpop!?

**cremeebrulee** (10): so real the state of zen u enter while running is like nothing else

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is kinda the song that made me go “damn MUNA are great, huh”. BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM

**impla77** (10): Hardest synths ever???

**runaway3212** (10): I HATE RUNNING BUT I LOVE THIS SONG

**seanderlust** (10): "So you can run to it. We won't but we hope people do" fjdndldk she's so funny

**Stryxen** (10): the GORGEOUS hooks and GORGEOUS synths and GORGEOUS drums more of this please. Their best song!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Damn, what a track. Releases the tension outstandingly, I imagine this would kill live

**1998tweety** (9.5): the production on this is immaculate

**phonethephoenix** (9.5): love the vibe and the pace of the song! also great vocals

**akanewasright** (9): They just love some killer synths

**Awkward\_King** (9): resisting the urge to call this DNB ..

**ReallyCreative** (9): a song that I only truly appreciated after hearing live tbh

**scythersboots** (9): rly appreciate the minimalism and galloping beat in this song, + the street sounds at the beginning. Really capture that sense of like, glowing up and just moving on with your life after leaving/changing relationships.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This is what I experience when I see shirtless men run by

**vayyiqra** (9): Is this "the serve" on the album? Yeah I see the vision ... it's not as catchy as What I Want but it's pretty good I'm into it.

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (8): the end with those big hits is cool

**nick1372** (8): Ironically a terrible song to run to

**plastichaxan** (8): Why is this kinda good I want to be negative in peace

**walkeddowntheblock** (8): I listen to this just for the outro.

**xxipil0ts** (8): - ironically gives u runner's high

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (7.9): this is what it sounds like to crest up rollercoaster hill

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): i run a 9 minute half mile i have never felt a runner's high

**afs** (7.5): omg munapop

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): shocked by how EDM the production on this is

**jman457** (7.3): Its good, but wished it built to something more

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.2): these random sophie drops im crying

**camerinian** (7): mandatory school cross-country induced PTSD aside yeah this is pretty good

**CrimsonROSET** (7): she turned into a rina slayama track

**ignitethephoenix** (7): weird song

**Poydoo** (7): bops a bit

## Couch potatoes

**homestarguy** (6.5): My Runner’s, my Runner’s, my High

**alexismateofan** (6): The vocals are soothing but why the fuck is the music track trying to FNAF me.

**Nagisoid** (6): Alex G when he's up on a platform idk

**uberpigeon** (6): i thought this would have a big climax and then it just didnt

**Lilacly\_Adily** (5): its an alright background song to play at parties but it’s kinda boring to listen otherwise

**IIIHenryIII** (3): maybe if I was high I could appreciate this, but I’m completely sober and this shit didn’t go anywhere

**TheQueenofVultures** (2): kids who walked the mile in gym class unite

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): It’s just great sounding bleeps and bloops. They really Knocks-ed it out of the park with this one! ….I’m sorry.

**TiltControls** (8.5): Another one of those tracks that’s just trying to be fun and not focusing on much else. MUNA does really great work with these upbeat type tracks. Just fun to let your body go and just bounce around to it.

## -ody-ody-ody

1998tweety (10): production ate

phonethephoenix (10): love this song love the vibes let's gooo

RandomHypnotica (10): ok ethel cain

ReallyCreative (10): this song coming out during COVID and not when clubs were open... absolute catastrophe

seanderlust (10): i love the use of the hook - how it sounds so similar but is almost always different wording

shhhneak (10): Such a worthy song of the summer but so linked to 2020 that it makes me depressed upon impact.

Frajer (9): hopefully the bodies are in the basement because Kesha is throwing a slumber party

nick1372 (9): What is it with the Knocks and their collabs with white indie pop girlies

savemeaseat143 (9): I'm not a huge EDM fan but this song is so euphoric

scythersboots (9): This is the song that got me into Muna.

PrimaryCrusaders (8.5): The chorus feels kinda underwhelming but The Knocks' production and the dope-ass drops make up for it

jman457 (8.4): a standard edm bop with a classic drop but it works well with Muna

memezaharamole (8): the Tycho remix is an eleven

TheQueenofVultures (8): the Tycho remix eats though

alexismateofan (7): The most Just Fine song Muna has in this rate.

welcome2thejam (7): Desperately need a count of how many Bodies songs we've rated in the past twelve months

## Let the bodies hit the floor

afs (6): this is somehow more generic than the album :sob:

IIIHenryIII (5): odies-odies-odies-odies-odies-odies-odies Odies-odies-odies-odies-odies-odies-odies

WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine (4): this is just them saying "yeah we like to rollerskate"

flava (2.5): oh sweet jesus this bonus rate has song

Awkward\_King (2): you'll never be will toledo

Nagisoid (2): What in the Marshmello just happened

plastichaxan (1): This sounds like one of those annoying mid 2010s chainsmokers-youtuber background music type of song I’m so sorry

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I know there were a few raters that were close to giving this their 11 but ended up going in a different direction. I’m a little sad about that because, man, this song deserves at least one 11. What an absolutely perfect, gorgeous closer. However, looking at the lowest scores section, it appears that the King actually didn’t understand.

**TiltControls** (10): Absolute perfect closer. This is the ethereal Florence vibes that I love. She’s really putting her all into the track as well. Once the final chorus hits it’s like a chorus of angels.

---

## Early birds

**bogo** (10): i always thought she was saying "i'll show you what it's like to be sad," which is kinda funny but is much worse than what she is actually saying in that line

**flava** (10): there is something incredibly beautiful with Florence finding a different way of becoming a rock icon, one that isn’t going to die before her time due to abusing drugs and alcohol. She’ll never be Elvis, she’ll never end up like that King, even if she has a deep respect for his music, and respectfully never mentions the details surrounding his death. But she broke that mould, and part of me thinks she is also looking on further into the future, at newer artists who see her, sober and clean and know that maybe they won’t only have the history of stars who burned bright and died young to look up to, they’ll also have her. Cause she made it to the stage to be saved, and she is King

**Frajer** (10): I wonder if Paul Simon ever made it to Graceland since Florence didn't

**impla77** (10): The story behind this is so moving. We’re glad you’re still with us King <3

**jackisboredtoday** (10): idk exactly when but at some point this one just really clicked for me

**nick1372** (10): Whenever Florence strips it back and tells a story it always blows my mind. Also this instrumental is just Solar Power with Florence vocalizations over it but somehow it is the best thing I've ever heard.

**phonethephoenix** (10): gorgeous! also the pull/calling/urge to be an artist 🥺

**Poydoo** (10): I can totally understand all the emotions she's going through in this song. I'd feel this way too if I had to do a concert in Memphis

**ReallyCreative** (10): incredible closer to an incredible albummm

**runaway3212** (10): even bigger ender

**seanderlust** (10): these lyrics are honestly heartbreaking

**shhhneak** (10): What a fucking closer. Please never stop making music, Florence. Seeing this live was a full circle moment. Thank you for sparing us <3.

**Stryxen** (10): perfect lyrics, almost every line cuts me more than the last. a perfect goodbye. Definitely an honorary 11

**savemeaseat143** (9.8): exactly

**CrimsonROSET** (9): well elvis is dead so- oooooooooooh

**1998tweety** (8.5): cute closer

**afs** (8): Lvis

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): yeehaw

**Nagisoid** (8): The instrumental would not be out of place in a SpongeBob episode (that's not a bad thing)

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This is another one that took several listens to click for me

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): is Graceland really that life changing though? I thought it was like a museum...

**jman457** (7.7): a nice beautiful ending to the album

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (7.7): when she lets her britishness comes thru and says "eye neva gaut 2 see elhvisss"...she was way more fucking real than any moment on this smarmy ass tory ass mid ass album. yeah i guess king charles should exonerate her? i forgor what this song was about.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): it’s a cute outro

## Night owls

**alexismateofan** (6): Florence usually picks a great song to end the album off on, so uhhhhh… nice to change things up occasionally but let’s not keep it going like this.

**homestarguy** (6): Florence has left the building

**uberpigeon** (5): i hate elvis

**vayyiqra** (4): no more songs about this topic please

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): i like the way florence sings and enunciates and the lyrics for this are cute but i kinda just feel nothing towards it :/ its not like bad but i dont like it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): It’s a nice, bouncy closer that ties Laurel Hell together really well. However, I gotta be honest I really don’t think it deserved to beat the other closing track we just eliminated.

**TiltControls** (7): Why do I like the name of this song so much. There’s just something so ‘matter of fact’ about it. The song itself is fine, I don’t care too much for it - but that name is an absolute 10/10 in the names rate.

---

## moth_irl

**Poydoo** (11): My ears are orgasming

**Roxieloxie** (11): I've been obsessed with this song since the first moment I heard it. I danced to this song, i've cried my eyes out to it its absolutely one of my favorite mitski songs despite how unique it is to her discography. I've described this song before as a full city wide musical number dedicated to the misery and failings of a relationship. Im imagining the 'thats how he knows' scene from enchanted but this is playing over it and the main character is upset but no one else is. I can just see the slow pan out from the apartment showing the lamp in the windowsill of the apartment just grappling with the feeling of if you should go back or not and accept the not fully fufiled sense of love knowing that you need more or just give it all. i love this song I love this song I love this song! music!

**akanewasright** (10): idk if Roxie is doing the rate, so I’ll steal their thoughts about this song, that it sounds like you’re having depression and then a parade is outside the window. It’s sooooo good at evoking that feeling. THIS is ideal pop mitski

**Awkward\_King** (10): mitski singing gleefully about no longer being loved back in a relationship gotta be one of my favourite genders

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I’ll give you a camp 10 Mitski we did it. It’s funny she’s typically ended her albums on the slower, minimalist songs that eviscerate your heart and this time around she gave us showtunes lmao. Rock on! this is me at the end of this lil ol’ album https://tenor.com/view/winona-ryder-heathers-messyhair-smoke-gif-14031109

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): i heard this playing in an H&M once

**musical\_pyn** (10): Mitski not playing this on tour is my villain origin story

**Stryxen** (10): this is an honorary 11 I adore it

**uberpigeon** (10): standing floor lamps are so expensive and for what? its a pole with a bulb on. what is causing them to be so much more expensive than just like a desk lamp? its insane. i have a lamp in my room that cost like 70 quid and its really nice but i better be enjoying that lamp for the rest of my life for that price

**phonethephoenix** (9.6): her lyrics are sooo good. and her voice and the instrumentation! wonderful album closer

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): comrade mitski

**Frajer** (9): me when a Pixar movie is starting

**homestarguy** (9): Dedicated to David Byrne’s dance partner from “This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)”

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): I love lamp.

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): communist moths be like

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): quirk queen

**1998tweety** (8.5): camp

**afs** (8.5): :dancer:

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): a Mitski stan tried to make me think I was wrong for liking this. However, have you considered,,,, this is camp

**beeozan** (8): me listening to lamp

**CrimsonROSET** (8): my favorite genre of song is when you can predict when the claps are gonna start

**jman457** (8): A fun little way to end the album

**nick1372** (8): I like to imagine Mitski's neighbors watching her dramatically staring into her own window like this bitch is out here again at 1:30am...

**savemeaseat143** (8): funky

**shhhneak** (8): AHT AHT! Come back and finish your meal Mitski.

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (7.9): it's like a (ford) fiesta type beat

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oc7rc/have_you_ever_felt_a_deep_personal_connection_to/c3g4ot3/

**alexismateofan** (7): It’s weirdly just fine, but in a good way. Like I can bop to this and if it comes up, I won’t skip, but it’s also not what I’m picking as my first track on a listen.

**bigbigbee** (7): This song has very “now what did we learn today kids” energy

**Nagisoid** (7): Good Shibuya-kei band!

**scythersboots** (7): i like this, but it feels a bit like a Japanese Breakfast discard

**welcome2thejam** (7): The happy music coming in on "you just don't love me" is peak comedy

## Too bright

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): If there's one issue I have with this album, it's that the music sounds so bright and poppy but Mitski still sings everything like she's reading a eulogy

**IIIHenryIII** (5): nice outro

**flava** (4.5): this song sounds off, and not just in the ways that are trying to be relevant to the themes of this song, of those complicated feelings that still linger, no the way everything clashes together just doesn't sound good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Even though I love this song, I was pretty surprised to see it in Day 3 for a good portion of the rate, with it being fairly slow and pretty repetitive. However, Florence was right. It indeed could not hold and the song dipped back into Day 2 with the last few ballots.

**TiltControls** (7.5): The vibe is cool, but the chorus gets a little repetitive after so many times around. She sounds great on the other parts of the track though.

---

## Dreaming of you

**scythersboots** (11): When Sam Irby posted an ig story about repeatedly listening to this song, I had to stan

**1998tweety** (10): the girls are girling [2]

**alexismateofan** (10): Literal fucking perfection in terms of music. The dance in dance fever is just for this song.

**cremeebrulee** (10): nothing could prepare me for this randomly needle dropping in love island season 8

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh she absolutely chose a golden voice this would go #4 in billboard if woodland chanting was counted on the algorithm

**flava** (10): She came into this song with a mission, to kill the idea of her being a “perfect woman” and she’s going to kill it in the most thunderous and gothic way possible. Dragging it by chains on a horse, pushed only by the power of Florence’s voice, persuasive percussion and killer guitars that could tear anyone in her way in half, and the song just keeps on building up as the chants join her into one hell of a climax that does not hold back, this is one of the greats of last year

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song is just an absolute anthem I love Florence

**seanderlust** (10): arguably my favorite lyrics on the album, second to maybe the last three tracks

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I really tried to come up with a constructive comment for this one but every time I try I just end up saying Mother

**shhhneak** (10): She said am I too late for the MOMMY? Sorry. Mommy? meme?

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): I already knew I loved this song, but I’d never realised just how kickass the drums here were. First time Florence herself wasn’t my favourite part of a song on the album

**welcome2thejam** (10): Oh noooo the magic pixie dream girl I created in my head just became a fully fleshed out person - flaws, quirks, and all - nooooo

**phonethephoenix** (9.3): love the driving beat!!

**savemeaseat143** (9.3): so true

**beeozan** (9): florence + inverted colors

**Frajer** (9): I like that she calls herself daddy and mommy in the same album

**akanewasright** (8.5): oh hey, this is like “seven devils” or “howl” style florence

**jman457** (8.5): The way this isnt dominating tik tok/twitter with the female rage edits

**Nagisoid** (8): Isn't that just Miss Anthropocene

**Stryxen** (8): the chorus is an entire 10. Incredible arrangement and the chords and instruments YUM but the verse are notably weaker (still good tho)

**impla77** (7.7): This is a bit corny but I still enjoy

**afs** (7.5): :sad:

**camerinian** (7): there are two wolves inside of me, one knows that this song would absolutely rip live with a full choral backing, and the other one knows this song is gonna be used in edgy movie trailers for a lifetime and is steeling itself to get really sick of it

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): I could say something profound about how some people idealise their crushes and partners in a way that no person could match up to… BUT THE WAY SHE SAYS MOMMY??? HELLO???

## Sleeping in

**Poydoo** (7): eh not one of the better songs on this album

**runaway3212** (7): This is kinda boring but like I'm not not living

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Florence… horny?

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): she really does not want to be mother

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I don't vibe with this one a lot

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (5.5): i feel like this would play on a christian sirius xm channel. i feel like florence should head down to the international society of Florences & workshop these lyrics with florence shaw, or at least get her on for a feature. that would fix this fella up i reckon

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): why does the melody sound kinda similar to Measure of a Man lmfao. anyway i like this one better, nice bluesy soulful sound. docked points for spoken part that i don’t care for

**vayyiqra** (4): edgy [2]

**Awkward\_King** (3): im not a fan of the plodding western-esque instrumental and so the song never really clicked with me, it is different i'll give it that but its not for me!

**kappyko** (0): i loathe this faux rootsy stuff sorry

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Ugh this was Day 3 for so much of the rate, but it just couldn’t hang on against the last few ballots.  I wish it had. Chereomania and the song that precede it (Free) combine to create such an incredibly beautiful, cathartic seven and a half minutes of music. It just makes we want to run outside and “dance” by waving my arms around frantically like the white girl I am.  SOMETHING’S! COMIN’! SOMETHING’S! COMIN’!

**TiltControls** (8.5): And so we have our last track of the day! For the longest time Florence actually had both this and Dream Girl Evil in day 3, but with some late ballots they ended up getting pushed out in favour of [redacted]. This track really encapsulates the vibe of ‘Dance Fever’ I feel Florence was going for (being a description of the phenomenon would probably tell you that).

---

## Dancing all night

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**bogo** (10): oh yes

**CrimsonROSET** (10): wait but that start is actually so real, like i dont think anything really BAD has ever happened to me and it makes me have a crisis over my own feelings? Like well yeah its BAD but its not THAT bad, suck it up schmuck, and it genuinely keeps me up sometimes if im overreacting about stuff

**JIRACHI** (10): this gives me all the energy i need for the day

**Lilacly\_Adily** (10): oh yes Florence I am also committed to the feeling

**memezaharamole** (10): this was such a grower on me, the story behind Choreomania and the theory of dance fever as an unbridled release after lockdowns is a really beautiful idea imo. The idea how lockdowns can relate to the pandemic but also emotional or mental lockdowns, self-imposed or otherwise. oh yeeeeeeeeeesssssss!

**phonethephoenix** (10): a satisfying florence tune. the little "ha"s! i like the rhythm of "and i danced myself to death"

**Poydoo** (10): Maybe I am an evangelical because I'm also saying "oh yes" to this song

**ReallyCreative** (10): we LOVE a build

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I can’t believe I didn’t like this song on first listen

**shhhneak** (10): Please have a montage of Serbian Dancing Women over the opening to this track when it’s revealed.

**Stryxen** (10): OH YES. OH YES.

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): Her husky vocals in the second verse is an absolute highlight of the album

**xxipil0ts** (10): - try not to tell the story about its context challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)

**nick1372** (9.5): I love Florence so much she's so dramatic. Also the second Jesus line in a row and somehow they both hit so hard. This is the best three-track opening sequence in music in years btw.

**alexismateofan** (9): The choreo she’s talking about is Vegas Week on So You Think You Can Dance

**camerinian** (9): that bridge is fucking sick, the hardest bars in the rate

**homestarguy** (9): Oh yeah Rock is back baby

**jman457** (9): “You say Rock and Roll is dead, because it hasn’t been resurected in your image” is the lyric of the year.

**impla77** (8.5): Okay, this song has a bit of missed potential for me. Dancing plague is a fascinating and not well understood part of medieval history, and the connection Florence makes to her own panic attacks is so interesting and compelling. I can really relate to this, suffering from anxiety and panic attacks, this visceral, uncontrollable mess that feels totally irrational and like you’re blowing things out of proportion.. yeah I get it. But then we get this slight critique of patriarchy in rock music and its just a bit out of left field?? Anyway, I really like this song, just wish it was tighter lyrically.

**savemeaseat143** (8.2): theatrical! Fantastic bridge

**afs** (8): "demon daddy"

**Awkward\_King** (8): "and i am freaking out in the middle of the street with the complete conviction of someone who's never had anything actually really bad happen to them, but i am committed now to the feeling" this is so marina having a panic attack in a supermarket in the verse of obsessions core

**Nagisoid** (8): Florence was listening to 4'33'' here, her mind ❤️

**runaway3212** (8): God her voice is so good

**vayyiqra** (8): see choreo is greek for dance and mania is greek for madness so choreomania is greek for dance fever that's the title of the album

**scythersboots** (7): an interesting and fun idea but kind of a blah song for me; I feel like its placement so early on the album turned me off from listening to the rest in first attempts to listen through

**slimboyfriend** (7): “I’ll be your demon daddy” is a slayyyter lyric

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): If singers are feeling comfortable enough to start calling themselves “demon daddy” in public then I think the pandemic really broke us as a society

**welcome2thejam** (7): Choreomania sounds like the name of some long forgotten DDR ripoff game on the PS2

## Two left feet

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6.4): wait what the fuck is the title? this is classic anthemic flo!! kinda can't hate her for it even though its really just okay in my ears

**akanewasright** (6): Sure

**IIIHenryIII** (6): "like if Jesus came back, but in a beautiful dress" she wants to be LORDE so bad

**kappyko** (5): tonight im gonna dance for all that weve been through but i dont wanna dance if im not dancing with you

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): two of the four horsemen: “profound” spoken word and the loudest mix you’ve ever heard
