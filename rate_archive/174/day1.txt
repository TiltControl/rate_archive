2022 Anthemic Indie Pop Reveal Day 1: Keep Your 11’s Around and Be Cool
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/14b8p7k/2022_anthemic_indie_pop_reveal_day_1_keep_your/

Ladies, gentlemen, and enbies, [please rise and remove your hats](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oHC6PfgQkdM) for Day 1 of the 2022 Anthemic Indie Pop reveal. A little over a month ago, we asked you all to score songs from four very synthy, very emotive albums that, ideally, would make you want to scream-sing along in your car.  We had 77 lovely people submit ballots and, today, we will be seeing who came out on…bottom.

My co-host u/TiltControls and I will be revealing what songs placed **#49 - #33** in our main rate and **#8 and #7** in our bonus rate.  We will start eliminating songs at **6:30 PM EST** or about an hour after this post goes up. We’d love it if you would join us in the [Queup Room](https://www.queup.net/join/the-anthem-by-good-charlotte) where we will listen to songs as they are eliminated (and maybe watch some other silly stuff along with it).

Rate Statistics:

* [77](https://pastebin.com/uRjgnPHT) Lesbians, Horse Girls, Witches, and/or Texas Residents did this rate
* The overall average was **7.474**
* The average controversy was **1.884** (any song with a score higher than this should be considered controversial)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): Midway through the submission period Tilt and I messaged each other joking about how Restraint was somehow beating an actual song even though it seemed like such an obvious first out. I assumed that, despite Everyone being slow, long and overall very not-popheads-core, it would eventually rise above a one minute long interlude that’s just Florence doing her croak voice. ………. Anyway this song is good and it deserved better!

**TiltControls** (7): It’s not my favourite Mitski song for sure, but I’m surprised at just how much people disliked this one. Enough to have it lose to a bunch of Florence interludes! It’s got a nice vibe to it, but I guess not really having anything else beyond that was enough to tank it in the rankings.

—

## Come in! Come in!

**plastichaxan** (10): I said I would save you Mitski I will avenge the crimes of the 0s sorry cohostie

**Roxieloxie** (10): my poor little meow meow, no one gets you like how i do .... I love the environment of this song and the space that it creates. Its very repetitive and robotic and feels like mitski's almost trying to figure out the words to it as she's going along with it. Idk when i listen to this I want to write a book about a robot in a service position slowly becoming sentient but not wanting to make anyone aware of it but also wanting to explore what that means for them and their wants and needs and being afraid to try and debating if the fear of the unknown is worse than the fear of being caught

**afs** (8): everyone...... rock your one......

**alexismateofan** (8): oh god mitski don’t go that way oh god she has headphones on she can’t hear us!!!!

**Awkward\_King** (8): god im so obsessed with how long it takes her to get her lines and words out in this song i think its so hypnotising

**runaway3212** (8): This is super great

**phonethephoenix** (7.9): her voice is soooo good

## (Mostly) everyone disliked that…

**1998tweety** (7): this is just kiinda there

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Evil Mitski be like…… oh wait

**savemeaseat143** (6.7): boring

**Poydoo** (6.5): meh

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6.5): i think mitski rlly helped normalize drum machines and getting that sound into ditties for a new generation. anyways, got a pleasant drone haze and voice part but this is a sleepy song on a short album!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): how many jokes about nobody are gonna be made here

**vayyiqra** (6): this is funny how repetitive it is but I don't mind it

**camerinian** (5.5): great narrative, I just wish it didn't take until the last 20 seconds to not be musically stagnant

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): too long and too droning for me

**IIIHenryIII** (5): this feels like the kind of music my grandma would enjoy

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): Just feels like background music to me. Nothing major going on here.

**ReallyCreative** (5): the way this is the polar opposite of Nobody (famously good song) omg

**scythersboots** (5): incredibly tedious song.

**Stryxen** (5): unfortunately a not very much burger

**jman457** (4.7): this didnt go anywhere

**homestarguy** (4.5): Hmm.

**nick1372** (4): I want to like this but it just goes nowhere.

**welcome2thejam** (4): Wish the song was more interesting, because there's a lot of potential in Mitski ruminating on her rise to fame

**impla77** (3): This is just the type of track I don’t like, monotonous beat and v monotone melodically as well

**Nagisoid** (3): The amount of people that fell asleep listening to this:

**RandomHypnotica** (2): everyone agreeing this is bad

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): kinda some of her worst lyrics, as someone who’s held her lyrics in high regard for like a decade now. kinda giving moody dr. seuss, girl. kinda a shoddy attempt at some Young Marble Giants ting, not feeling this cut. i kinda like the piano at the end but i could just be listening to Under the Pink….

**uberpigeon** (1): this song is attracting every one

**beeozan** (0): i think its around this song that i forget this album is still playing in my earbuds. i honestly cant remember what it sounds like but i blame this song for this entire album being boring idc

**bogo** (0): this is so goddamn slow and plodding

**cremeebrulee** (0): evil nobody so it gets the opposite of its score

**ignitethephoenix** (0): this is giving university music project song, although not on a Maggie Rogers caliber but like at a community college

**JIRACHI** (0): this is so boring i couldn't even finish the song while trying to rate this

**oscarbrierley1** (0): creepy drone

**shesdoingyoga** (0): This song is less than 4 minutes but feels more like 8 minutes, which isn’t itself an issue for me since I enjoy other artists who put out longer music but for this specifically it just feels like a slog to get through. Mitski is already an artist that is very hit or miss for me and this is quite the miss.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): I’m really amazed that not only did this not end up in last place, it wasn’t in last place AT ALL after we got our 25th ballot. Listen, I respect the artistic decision here and I do often like it when Florence does her rough croaky voice, but this is just not pleasant to listen to at all and even if it was it’s only a minute long!

**TiltControls** (2): lmao and here I thought we were setting Florence up to fail

---

## Vocal fry enthusiasts

**shhhneak** (10): Oh that’s not-

**nick1372** (9): One of the best interludes I've ever heard, Florence is such an evocative vocalist

**Stryxen** (9): very very cool

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (8.1): no come back and do a FULL SONG of vocal fry "could have been in johnny depp's animated feature rango"! that was so good!

**1998tweety** (7): i mean

**phonethephoenix** (7): it's a good concept! also i love the vocal work

**Poydoo** (7): interlude

**runaway3212** (7): cute

**seanderlust** (7): it's good but it's an interlude

## Restrain it more, please!

**jman457** (6.7): this was so urethral 😍

**afs** (6): aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

**camerinian** (6): yeah yeah we all saw Us and tried the voice join the club

**IIIHenryIII** (6): this could be such a banger if it were an actual song

**musical\_pyn** (6): gay gasp

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): This is gonna be out by Day One for sure.

**shesdoingyoga** (6): Love a good vocal fry during pride month

**cremeebrulee** (5): her lets eat grandma-ass needs to STOP with these 1 min interludes i’m being so serious

**CrimsonROSET** (5): using this as my opportunity to lower my album average to normal levels (it wont work)

**Nagisoid** (5): Speak (growl?) on it Florence... period

**scythersboots** (5): interesting to see interludes in genres besides hip hop

**uiscebeathaoir** (5): at least Prayer Factory had the decency to be interesting

**welcome2thejam** (5): Incredible guest verse by a clicker from The Last of Us

**DaHumanTorch** (4): whatever that was

**impla77** (4): in her vocal fry era

**vayyiqra** (4): kind of pretty but also why

**beeozan** (3): stop with the interludes cmon

**Awkward\_King** (2): ok queen!

**JIRACHI** (2): girl why does she sound like that

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): Now she REALLY sounds like a demon daddy

**alexismateofan** (1): If Florence doesn’t win this rate, it’s because of this.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): oh lord if i did not have a come to jesus satan??? moment with that one Mitski song this would be my 0 tbh, dislike the vocal choices made here

**RandomHypnotica** (0): why the hell are we scoring this

## Yeah y’all are going in a shitpost

**ReallyCreative** (9): I'm just going to have to pretend this song immediately leaving doesn't upset me in any way

**plastichaxan** (8): This would’ve been such an easy 0 kill but I can’t lie just to get one

**homestarguy** (3): First song out bait

**kappyko** (1): if this is higher than a real song i swear to fucking god

**akanewasright** (0): queen of giving us an easy first out I guess

**TiltControls** (7.5): I actually really enjoyed this song when the album dropped… until listening to it properly a second time and getting to the Pattinson line. Maggie that lyric didn’t really need to be here in a song about how much you appreciate your friends.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Yeah this being bottom three and Maggie’s lowest song is the least surprising thing ever. It’s easily the least musically exciting song on Surrender and don’t even get me started on the lyr-wait why is this kinda hitting right now as I’m typing this comment?

## Friend-havers

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (11): saintly 11 dispatched to the most epic i love my friend ditty! i heard this and my ears perked up and went "fuck this is so cornball i love it". like this is a ditty lady bird would sing to her pal prolly aggie rogers rlly went there and wrote a lyric about she's got a friend who doesn't just go through it all, but also gets off to a poster of totally snubbed academy award for best actor candidate robby p. the lil' ambient field recording piano is cute. i wanna write a ditty like dis for all my fwends!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): hi im claire from the bon appetit test kitchen

**Frajer** (10): it's nice to have a friend

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): 👯‍♀️

**lexiaredery** (9): Shoutout to Claire

**runaway3212** (9): me too :)

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): this song is so sweet!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): ok gurl lol

**flava** (8): please introduce your friend to better country than Dolly Parton

**homestarguy** (8): Honking is a gateway drug that leads to Tonking

**IIIHenryIII** (8): her friends are doing better than Ed’s at least

**jman457** (8): I really like the storytelling on this

**kappyko** (8): The members of Shelley (of "Steeeam" fame and fortune) appearing on this is kinda like when the members of boygenius did back up vocals for Hayley Williams except appealing to a more specific breed of gay man. Like a subgroup that is specifically me

**musical\_pyn** (8): I really vibe with this, just so cheesy and lovely in the best way

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's a little corny but it's cute

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): now why would that be the FIRST thing u mention about clairo

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): imagine confiding in your friend that you used to masturbate to a poster of rob pattinson on your wall and then she puts it in a song

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): I hope it’s that photo of rob awkwardly standing in that brown tracksuit she masturbates too

**camerinian** (7): ok no need to brag

**shesdoingyoga** (7): This honestly feels too personal, like it almost makes me uncomfortable to listen to but it’s still good

**Stryxen** (7): florence tankers cant relate

**seanderlust** (6.5): Imagine Maggie said to you "hey I made a song about all my friends and you're in it! :)" and the only mention you got was the story you told her privately about whacking off to robert Pattinson

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this could've stayed in iMessage bestie!

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): i’m sure this friend masturbated to like.. either twilight era or tenet era pattinson (or high life if they’re a freak) but i think it would be way funnier if it were his salvador dali look from little ashes

**1998tweety** (6): what is going on with that piano

**Awkward\_King** (6): masturbating?? to rpat????? am i the friend?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): I love the random piano noodling at the end. “That’s the vibe” indeed.

**scythersboots** (6): idk why really but this song annoys me but its cute.

**shhhneak** (6): They need to start locking the doors at Electric Lady Studios. Clairo does not need to be in this room…

**welcome2thejam** (6): Proof I should never tell songwriter friends any of my embarrassing secrets ever

**afs** (5.5): ive got a tiktok video for these kind of songs

**vayyiqra** (5): lol

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): I just find this cheesy, but I don’t think I’m very into “this is a song dedicated to one specific person” type songs unless they’re romantic.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): her friend has really awful taste in men

**slimboyfriend** (4): I think we ALL have friends

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): All I'm saying is if I had a friend tell everyone who I jack off to I don't think I'd have a friend anymore

**JIRACHI** (3): looked up who Rob Pattinson is and almost gave this a 0 i'm so serious

**Nagisoid** (3): Pure chaos; the masturbating line, sudden jazz piano stabs, studio chatter and Clairo jumpscare, this song has it all (derogatory)

**TheQueenofVultures** (2): this reminds me of those three girls from Wet Hot American Summer who sing the song about friendship and everyone just politely claps incredibly bored

**alexismateofan** (0): Unfortunately, there’s way too much back talking here, and also I’m deducting so many points for bringing up masturbating to Rob Patterson I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE FROM THE COMMENTS. I KEEP GETTING GOT.

**impla77** (0): but did you have to snake them out like that

**Lilacly\_Adily** (0): there’s better songs about loving your friends that are less irritating

**nick1372** (0): narrator voice: immediately after releasing this song, Maggie no longer had a friend.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): ok I was an apologist for this when it came out but honestly I can't really vibe with this

**uberpigeon** (0): that is quite enough of that

**uiscebeathaoir** (0): That piano is place so jarringly in the mix I physically cringe every time I have to listen to it

**TiltControls** (5): A slightly better nothing song than restraint, but still a pretty nothing song. Florence sounds nice, but doesn’t really have time to do anything with that

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Well she needed that factory to be a little more productive for this song to ever not be in the bottom five!

---

## On the assembly line

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): -me making shit up- okaaay this song is so Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds vibes omgggg or ummmm uh Tom Waits Real Gone vibes?!~?!?! i’ll see myself out (ok now that the song is over I’m mad as hell this was an album highlight for me and it’s just a minute long? HELLO?! i finally understand the pain people felt with Tinashe - Shy Guy kdslklskdlksdkl)

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): interludephobia is going to eat her up...

**savemeaseat143** (8.6): very good but basically an interlude

**phonethephoenix** (8): it's short but has a great vibe! kind of mysterious and almost creepy? abrupt it works

**Poydoo** (8): cool interlude

**akanewasright** (7.5): This was rad, over way too soon

**nick1372** (7.5): Interludephobia will get this one but I really like it, it's a nice bit of exposition for the album. I love the multiple references to hotels throughout the album, it makes the whole record really feels like a tale of transitioning and traveling to different, but not always better, places in life.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): Ends way too soon. The chord progression is giving James Bond.

**1998tweety** (7): i mean shes cute but shes also a minute long

**beeozan** (7): this 1 minute thing having more atmosphere than tracks 1-4 kinda insane

**CrimsonROSET** (7): videogame cutscene music (compliment)

**Stryxen** (7): the little sections of guitar slay me

## Pray harder!

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): how hard does the interlude phobia hit her here

**afs** (6): interludephobia

**camerinian** (6): oh that’s all we get uh ok uhhhhhh

**flava** (6): this song title is giving small town in Canada vibes, not florence + the machine song vibes

**Nagisoid** (6): So Salt Lake City

**shhhneak** (6): If Mitski applied for a job here she wouldn’t be working for the knife.

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6): florence, on behalf of the machine, has been lobiyng for the removal of child labor practices that would allow for the estbalishment of non demonominational prayer factories.

**welcome2thejam** (6): I see why this is so short, but also, bruh

**jman457** (5.6): Even with a bit of interludephobia I wish it gave more

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): interlude (neutral)

**Roxieloxie** (5): i thought my spotify broke

**scythersboots** (5): its fine, a little exhausting, but i understand its place in the album narrative!!

**vayyiqra** (5): vayyiqra — Today at 3:49 AM i don't get it... this album i think just throws random religious stuff into the lyrics to add to the pseudo-medieval vibe

**JIRACHI** (4): interludephobia won

**alexismateofan** (3): Interludes are like my least favorite thing, especially singing interludes. Like this could have been a full song but it’s NOT and I’m SAD.

**Awkward\_King** (1): my least fav of the mini tracks on the album!! flop ginger bitch (affectionate)

**IIIHenryIII** (1): I woke up and chose interludephobia

**runaway3212** (0): interludephobia and boringcorephobia combining their powers

**TiltControls** (9): Okay, unlike Everyone I actually really like this one and am pretty sad to see it all the way at the bottom here. Again, another vibey Mitski track, but she sounds so good here and the production (though pretty barebones) perfectly matches the vibe of Mitski’s softer voice here.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Yeah this placement is pretty understandable. It’s pretty but it’s kinda boring, and really I think the main reason it did better than Everyone is because it’s not as long. Also, as you’ll see in the comments below, it really sets itself up with this title.

---

## You guessed correctly!

**kappyko** (10): https://mildcovidsurvivor.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/cropped-thumb_guess-ll-die-imagenes-de-guess-ill-just-die-meme-50213648-2.png

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i guess this will flop

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): lowkey the best song off the album. It has that old Mitski complicated, heart wrenching melancholy (apparently dates back to pre-Be The Cowboy).

**phonethephoenix** (9): of the quieter songs in this rate this is my favorite

**Frajer** (8.5): starting the second to last song with the line I guess this is the end purely to drive me insane

**savemeaseat143** (8.2): haunting

**1998tweety** (8): i feel sick

**alexismateofan** (8): Just… haunting and filling my mind in ways I wasn’t prepared for.

**Roxieloxie** (8): i also dont have many thoughts on this one other than thinking its sweet

**Poydoo** (7.9): vibey

## You guessed wrong!

**afs** (7): keep guessing

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Perfect music for just zoning out to. It's whatever.

**seanderlust** (7): mitski when it's the end: https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/365/753/94c.jpg

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): me when I rate a song a 7

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (7): she sounds like GLADOS here.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): my reaction to the song is the title

**CrimsonROSET** (6): aww you’re welcome

**Nagisoid** (6): This is not actually the end Mitski it's the penultimate song hope that helps

**nick1372** (6): "I guess this is the end" no ?? we still have one more song left mitski. wake up mitski you have to sing the last song mitski I want to go home

**uberpigeon** (6): well guess again

**jman457** (5.1): idk it didn’t move me that much

**bogo** (5): my reaction to this entire album

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): me rating this album clearly https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1099131040615907358/1112523103491346442/94c.png

**homestarguy** (5): I Guess…this is fine.

**ReallyCreative** (5): love a song whose title matches my feelings about it

**scythersboots** (5): feels like filler, tbh

**uiscebeathaoir** (5): most basic song on the album

**camerinian** (4.5): god so much of this album just feels totally directionless, and maybe that's the point but it sure as fuck isn't Mitski playing to her strengths

**shesdoingyoga** (4.5): me picking my score for this song

**Stryxen** (4.5): 🛌

**beeozan** (4): me ending my messages on discord

**runaway3212** (4): boringcore redux

**welcome2thejam** (4): ... I guess

**cremeebrulee** (2.3): don't make me say it...

**IIIHenryIII** (2): …that she was telling the truth when she said there was nothing left for me a couple tracks ago

**shhhneak** (2): I mean, she said it…

**Awkward\_King** (0): this is so bleh to me, everything i dont care for in a mitski song and it feels so void of all her usual personality. mitski girl im so sorry i cant help u here

**TiltControls** (8): These first few songs are just going to be me being sad about songs I liked going out with low averages lol. I guess the raters weren’t vibing as much with some of these slower, minimal production tracks as much as I was when scoring.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): After such a high energy (dare I say anthemic?) opening three tracks, Back in Town is just SUCH a come down track. But not coming down smoothly. There’s no parachute here; we just fell straight out of the plane.

---

## The boys

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): okay this feels like a song that’s really working with Florence’s voice. This is great!

**savemeaseat143** (9.5): yeah... :')

**1998tweety** (9): me coming back home from the florence concert at 1 am

**alexismateofan** (9): An absolutely haunting song. Really back to form from some stuff on Lungs.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): :flushed:

**krusso1105** (9): I have no memory of this song from the first 2 times I listened to this album but I'm liking it now

**jman457** (8.7): Balladphobia is gonna destroy this unfortunately. Its beautifully atmospheric.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (8.5): sways

**homestarguy** (8): NEW YORK GREATEST CITY IN DA WORLD BABY

**scythersboots** (8): love the specific mood this song captures so well

**phonethephoenix** (7.9): simple but effective!

**akanewasright** (7.5): she sounds really pretty here my god

**afs** (7): spit on me daddy OUT, big city baptise me king IN

**Poydoo** (7): cute but not amazing

**uiscebeathaoir** (7): always enjoy it because of her vocals, but have never sought it out by itself

## Pop punkers

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6.8): i feel like i am drinking a cold one at an irish tavern that does a 4-6 pm early bird senior dinner special. its pleasant! but sleepy! and where are my $5 fish and chips?!?!?!

**jackisboredtoday** (6): I like florence but the boys kinda have the superior “back in town” song

**Nagisoid** (6): New York I Love You, But You're Bringing Me Down

**runaway3212** (6): less of a slayer but still great

**impla77** (5.7): I like the lyrics, musically its not that interesting

**plastichaxan** (5): Her lyrics serve incredibly but we need the music to do it too girl

**welcome2thejam** (5): At least it's only about the second most songwritten about U.S. place

**nick1372** (4.5): Ok I get why y'all are tired of Jack Antonoff now.

**IIIHenryIII** (2): how am I supposed to dance to this? Waving my hands like I was in a gospel concert?

**Stryxen** (2): The opening 3 tracks being a 10 average and this coming in to tank it she knew she had to contain the slay levels

**Awkward\_King** (1): this is the section of the album thats a little nothing burger to me.

**beeozan** (1): is this what new age haters hear when they listen to new age

**vayyiqra** (0): this made me viscerally uncomfortable for reasons it is too late at night (03:53 EDT) for me to interrogate sorry

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I quite like this song and it fits perfectly with the movie, but I can understand why it didn’t do super well here. It’s pretty slow, not very poppy, and has men on it.

1998tweety (10): wait this ate

Awkward\_King (10): such a fucking beautiful song, for such a fucking beautiful film!! the EEAAO circle jerk and stans are annoying but it is still one of my favourite films ever and i think is just so incredibly, expertly made! like the people on twitter who put down every other film to praise it are morons and wrong, but i still adore the film! and this is such a great companion to it :)

FreeCuddlesAnyone (10): EEAAO best movie ever btw

RandomHypnotica (10): EEAAO SWEEP!!!

ReallyCreative (8.5): me waking up every morning

savemeaseat143 (8.5): I remember watching this film and going "Mitski???" when the credits rolled lol

jman457 (8): yeah that was Natu Natu’s to lose but it would be so cool if mitski won an Oscar

nick1372 (8): hypnotizing... I want an everything bagel now.

afs (7.5): shoot me but this is the first time ive ever liked david byrne's vocals

alexismateofan (7): Just a very beautiful song that I unfortunately could not connect with. It’s undeniable it’s good. I think if I had seen the movie, I might feel differently.

bogo (7): i love bagel googly eye movie! i don't love this song. it's still good though

phonethephoenix (7): their vocals are soo good and the song production is generally good but also. this song is boring i'm sorry!

welcome2thejam (7): Who would have guessed David Byrne would show up twice in this rate

cremeebrulee (6): oh fuck i still have not seen this movie i need to get on that

Nagisoid (6): Wonder if movie bias will affect this one

IIIHenryIII (5): again, not my cup of tea

InSearchOfGoodPun (5): I'm still traumatized by that terrible Oscars performance. Great movie though.

shhhneak (5): I won a Purple Heart on the Oscars 2023 frontlines for this movie but it was the weakest part of EEAAO.

WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine (4.2): *me staring directly at da giant everything bagel* yeah okay there was no need for this

scythersboots (4): this is…a lot.

**TiltControls** (8.5): Our first MUNA song to go and it’s again following the slower, more stripped back production as our previous few eliminations. Again, it’s basic, but the way the vocals and production match really captivates me I guess.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): And all of our artists have officially entered the reveal! Even though this isn’t my lowest MUNA score, I totally get why it was their worst performing song and pretty much was the whole time. It’s pretty enough, but it’s definitely the most forgettable song on the album.

## Brand new bicycles

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): kinda dido vibes we love that

**alexismateofan** (9): It’s actually kind of sexy without feeling like it’s trying to convince you to have sex, so it’s definitely made for me.

**Frajer** (9): I can handle Muna and hang with Robyn got it

**kappyko** (9): Hell Yeah!!!! Lesbian Sex

**phonethephoenix** (8.9): instrumentation and lyrics compliment each other

**savemeaseat143** (8.8): Hands Off's sister!

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (8): they've done like 3 or 4 of these sorta slow "look at our studio mastery!" cuts and i guess this one is gonna get an 8 even tho it could easily get a 6. kinda feels like a cut that circe would listen to while weeding her garden on exile

**welcome2thejam** (8): Strong moody tone with some great little flourishes here and there to keep it interesting

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute [2]

**bigbigbee** (7.5): every guinea pig I’ve ever owned to me :(

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): With such a strong opening to the album there had to be a cool down at some point

**Poydoo** (7.4): muna

**seanderlust** (7.3): love that this starts with metaphors about bicycles and being rough around the edges and the outro is just straight up "pull my hair"

**afs** (7): selfish narcissistic boot psycho freaking boot licking nazi creep and

**nick1372** (7): the horny police are on the way!

**runaway3212** (7): She does nothing but she's cute

**scythersboots** (7): interesting that the lyrics are like, sexy and fun, but the music v much feels like…cinematic, riding in a car in the rain after something bad has happened to the main character vibes

**slimboyfriend** (7): she said GRAB this ASS… ALL of it!!

## Hands off!

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): Katie said i am NOT a motomami

**homestarguy** (6.5): Handle Meh

**impla77** (6.5): ngl this song had me thinking MUNA was swedish bc the bicycle lyric is so max martin-esque

**Stryxen** (6.5): the drums are nice I like the busier parts of the instrumental but the sparse parts don't work 4 me

**CrimsonROSET** (6): put me in the bootylicious section

**IIIHenryIII** (5): just like runner’s high this song invokes boredom

**jman457** (5): A bit boring sorry

**Nagisoid** (5): Can you handle that? Can you handle that? Can you handle that?

**vayyiqra** (5): Agreeable enough but this album feels so on autopilot somehow

**camerinian** (4.5): this sort of sweet tender songwriting deserves production that knows what the fuck it’s doing

**JIRACHI** (3): i'm not gagging

**Awkward\_King** (1): im sorry this really does very little for me at all, i find the melody annoying and the lyrics aren't good enough to redeem it. this album is like so hit or miss the songs are either bangers or completely forgettable

**TiltControls** (8.5): I really liked this as a closer to Maggie’s album, but definitely agree with the other comments that mentioned she was trying to do too much with a sub-3 minute track here. Still, the first half is absolutely gorgeous and enough for me to still cheer this closer on.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I get it, I get it. It does kinda feel like a rushed, a bit sloppy attempt at a Happier Than Ever effect. However…I just think it’s neat!

---

## Ridin’ all together

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): im such a sucker for a big climax of instruments at the end of the final song on an album. its pussy!!!!

**alexismateofan** (9): Great song to close the album out on.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this is gonna get chosen familyd hope ur okd isnt it

**IIIHenryIII** (9): not like the other girls, but make it pretty and relatable

**Poydoo** (9): holy shit my ears are in heaven at that guitar

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**phonethephoenix** (8): it's a nice song! good album closer

**plastichaxan** (8): Between Want Want/What I Want and Kind Of Girl/this MUNA you’re bones I’m sorry

**savemeaseat143** (8): sometimes closing tracks feel more like conclusions to essays where the author tries to make a greater statement about the world than a good song

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (8): its a nice goodbye

**afs** (7): knees are aching palms are sweaty

**musical\_pyn** (7): the song is kinda eh but that end is great

**shhhneak** (7): My favourite anecdote about Surrender is that somebody named Isadora Blue Lovett is credited on this song for “utero kick.” That is none other than Maggie’s goddaughter! She sampled the sound of a kick in her mom’s uterus and weaved it in creatively. Isadora Blue main pop girl in 2042?

**Stryxen** (7): me starting a new minecraft save when I don't immediately spawn in a village

## Looks the same to me…

**ReallyCreative** (7): not my favorite closer

**cremeebrulee** (6.3): neat subversion of using a ballad as your closing track, though i don’t think the switchup fully works

**camerinian** (6): just once I’d love for one of these indie types to chime up and say “actually i’m pretty normal I think”

**impla77** (6): The outro is cool, everything else is meh

**Nagisoid** (6): Mad respect for trying to be Happier than Ever in under than 3 minutes but I'm heartbroken to announce it did not go as planned

**scythersboots** (6): i don’t find this song memorable or interesting, sadly!

**jman457** (5.6): I love when the tempo unexpectedly shifts midway through, but idk the two parts didn’t work that well together here

**welcome2thejam** (5): Not that I don't love a good soft to loud switch-up, just wish the soft part was better

**memezaharamole** (4.5): this album was unfortunately my biggest disappointment of 2022 due to the second half, but I appreciate the work, talent and ideas that went into it, just not my cup of tea.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (3): I wish the last song had really been the outro.

**runaway3212** (3): different kind of nothing

**beeozan** (2): whole new world outsold. exaggerated buildup to end the album. oh im not gonna be nice to phoebe bridgers in the next couple of months

**nick1372** (2): This song has no justification to exist and it was realized in the most boring, basic way possible.

**uberpigeon** (2): i hate when artists end the album with a flop

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): I don't need to explain why this is awful do I? In the year 2022 I have no patience for songs that talk about how bad the world is in the most basic, centrist, naively hopeful way possible. "I'm so shaky and sweaty thinking about the world this song is for peace uwu" I expect better from a so-called alt-rocker. "This is dedicated to people with a different point of view heehee" They want us dead, Maggie. If Taylor Swift wrote this it would be the least surprising thing ever

**TiltControls** (7.5): Apparently single bias does not trump short song tanking! Again, I think this track would’ve worked better if only it were a bit longer and had time to build to somewhere.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I like this fine, but there’s only so high I can go with my score for a glorified interlude that doesn’t really go anywhere. Also…WHY DID THIS GET A VIDEO AND NOT CHOREOMANIA OR CASSANDRA??

---

## Stomping and clapping

**CrimsonROSET** (10): what the fuck is this

**musical\_pyn** (10): I know this is an interlude but GOD is it pretty close to perfect

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this interlude kinda eats. ok stomp stomp clap clap cunty hunty

**nick1372** (8.5): Fiona Apple-core (complimentary)

**savemeaseat143** (8.2): I feel like I'm at a gathering

**flava** (8): this song is barely a song, but it’s better than most of Mitski’s and Maggie’s albums

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): The production on this is giving me a bit of Bjork in a way.

**seanderlust** (8): evil Cryalot:

**shesdoingyoga** (8): The best Florence songs are the ones that make me want to dance around a fire barefoot in the middle of the woods somewhere. Unfortunate that this is basically an interlude

**phonethephoenix** (7.8): yesss love the end.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): why the hell did she drop this as a single what was she doing

**afs** (7.5): still not as good as marina rhyming witches with bitches twice

**Poydoo** (7.4): Maybe I am a fish because I'm also floundering

**jman457** (7): a better interlude, it ended cool

## I don’t want it!

**1998tweety** (7): this song works in the album but its meh on its own

**bogo** (7): i don't understand why this was a promo single but go off

**Nagisoid** (7): It's about time we rated bardcore!!!

**shhhneak** (7): Clean the house now NOW NOW people Heaven is COMING. Get rid of the couches we can’t let people know we SIT.

**Stryxen** (7): needs an ice spice feature

**homestarguy** (6.5): Preferred Sarah Bonito’s take on this

**akanewasright** (6): oh right, i remember this, it was a pre release thing… She’s so quirky love her

**ReallyCreative** (6): this was an interesting choice of "non-single somewhat interlude promo track"

**uiscebeathaoir** (6): what a weird choice for a single

**camerinian** (5.5): wait this was a single

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): girls grab your scarves we are going medieval caravaning tonight!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): this feels like i’m overhearing some posh British girls’ boarding school hazing ritual

**IIIHenryIII** (5): here where? I already know it's a place on Earth, but where?

**JIRACHI** (5): interludephobia strikes again

**scythersboots** (5): This feels like a rejected fiona apple song, sorry

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): interlude (negative)

**runaway3212** (4): this does nothing

**cremeebrulee** (3.3): camp rock step scene vibes

**vayyiqra** (2): why are Florence's lyrics about religion on this album so bad vayyiqra — Today at 4:01 AM florence i have heard "st jude" and "various storms and saints" i know you can write songs about religion that are good

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (1.1): so there was this moment while i originally got to this part in the album and i was sleepy and sorta just dreamed through it over 2 minutes. kinda thought a score in my head but then I went and watched the video and now that I understand clearly what the fuck "dance fever" means for Florence + the Machine...well one song on 3 of these albums needs to take a massive ego bashing point chopping. the dance sucks ass and the boom stomp boot clap part nearly made me hurl from the smell of the boots. how is that possible? yeah there's something resonant here and fascinating I'll give it that .1 boost, but florence is just not the vessel for a capella vocal zany number like this. i don't buy it.

**alexismateofan** (1): My least favorite Florence song, and I say that with knowledge that I don’t even have Seven Devils on my Spotify.

**TiltControls** (7.5): It’s the inferior Texas Mitski track for sure, but it’s still a great listen. Once the production kicks up a notch it’s easy to get lost in the dreamy sounds that Mitski’s bringing out.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): In my comment for “Texas Reznikoff” in the Introspective Indie Pop rate on r/indieheads a few months ago, I did a cheeky little promo for this rate. I am only just now seeing that I called it “Anthem Indie Pop.” Ugh we would have gotten 200 participants if I knew how to type…

---

## One of Valentine’s 106 residents

**Roxieloxie** (9): This song is kinda nothing but I absolutely adore it as an opener. the slow build to 1:06 where it feels like the song breaks the surface of water and everything is fuller and clearer. It makes me want to float through the sky like a leaf while writing about fantasy worlds

**Stryxen** (9): I looooove it it sounds so dark and ominous it's a perfect scene setter. The chord progression is on another level

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): Pure poetry

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**camerinian** (8.5): really hope this trend of Mitski starting albums off with a jump scare continues

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Texas Reznikoff (a 10) but 30 years old and now just depressed

**afs** (8): does this place exist tho

**CrimsonROSET** (8): :snailfail:

**IIIHenryIII** (8): this is the first Mitski song I’m ever hearing and although it’s not a favorite, I’m very excited to what she has in store

**phonethephoenix** (8): lush instrumentation! (no pun intended)

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (7.8): i mean it sounds like it could be on an episode of off the air, and mitski was on an episode of off the air in 2016. its not a great great track, but it does a sort of big fairytale leap that st. vincent trafficked in between 2009-2011. I'm rambling a bit, but this feels like a stronger version of

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): I really hate the pacing at the start of this, Mitski has done slow and somber before without sounding so leaden. But it picks up I must admit.

**Poydoo** (7.5): idk what's happening in this song but i think she got murdered

**homestarguy** (7): Found this interesting about the county this town resides in: (from Wikipedia) “Jeff Davis County is recognizable for its unique shape; it is a pentagon that has no north-south nor east–west boundaries, save for a six-mile line serving as its southern boundary. It is the only county in the United States that touches a foreign country (Mexico) at a single point.”

**impla77** (7): what is the point of a town with like 100 people asdf

**nick1372** (7): Classic Mitski opener, really proves the point that her sound can be merged with 80s new wave.

**shhhneak** (7): Here she goes singing about Texas again.

## Anthemic Indie Pop is NOT a land-locked rate

**jman457** (6.7): kind of weak opening tbh

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): do we think mistki has been to prada marfa

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.3): texas is a landlocked state

**Awkward\_King** (6): mitski album openers have a habit of either being wildly overrated to me or being the best songs in her discography (will leave others to decipher which ones are which)

**bogo** (6): unfortunately a certain similarly named song by a certain artist who will go unnamed is much better

**shesdoingyoga** (6): There’s something about her vocals on the whole album that I don’t like, but not her performance just the way they’re processed

**vayyiqra** (6): somehow the intro to this song has more authentic religious vibes than Florence's whole album full of shoehorned religious lyrics

**flava** (5): does Mitski still think Texas is a land-locked state?

**RandomHypnotica** (5): it's no snail mail

**scythersboots** (5): i just don’t find this a compelling opener.

**welcome2thejam** (5): Texas Reznikoff outsold

**alexismateofan** (4): This song’s vibe is my current thoughts on visiting Texas.

**beeozan** (4): snail mail outsold. wow

**ignitethephoenix** (4): I hate how she barely sings and the production does not work with this song here

**Nagisoid** (4): Thinking about both her Texas songs have a random increase in loudness somewhere... what is she trying to say?

**runaway3212** (4): boring sorry

**JIRACHI** (2.5): yawns...

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Okay here’s where I REALLY break with the pack on tanking the slow Mitski deep cuts. What a beautiful song. Like the part where the instrumental swells a minute and a half in and then suddenly mutes with the “and then it passed” - I had CHILLS. But apparently most of y’all did not. The raters could not touch fire. They could not fly.

**TiltControls** (5): There’s nothing left for me in the this track to enjoy more like lol. The problem with Mitski vibe tracks is if they don’t hit there’s not really anything drawing me toward them. As is the case for this one.

—

## This nothing sure is something!

**akanewasright** (10): the bridge and “and then it passed” is maybe my favorite moment in the entire rate

**alexismateofan** (10): I feel like something is eating me alive when listening to this in the absolute best way possible.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): we’re finally back lol. this is probably day 1, it’s more amorphous than the synthpop cuts. -me being an annoying fan giving Mitski unsolicited advice, i’m just being silly pay me no mind- hey Mitski have u heard the Durutti Column?!? i bet you’d like it :3

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this song is about hosting rates and you can't convince me otherwise

**runaway3212** (10): This is a poor man's God Turn Me Into A Flower however God Turn Me Into A Flower is perhaps the best song ever

**savemeaseat143** (10): Mitski is a genius

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): really love the build on the bridge

**phonethephoenix** (8.8): quiet yet epic and sweeping

**Poydoo** (8.8): ah yes

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes cute

**plastichaxan** (8.5): The other girlies to Mitski when it gets to top 5 of the rate: Oh God I hope not I would cry scream throw up

**jman457** (8.4): a very underrated track here it’s so unexpectedly bombastic that first the mood of the song so well

**Stryxen** (8): slayed that

**afs** (7.5): LowKey

**camerinian** (7): this performance is giving "made for the grammys telecast"

**CrimsonROSET** (7): send my love to your new lover… treat her better… better than he can… wait

**homestarguy** (7): Me to my roommate a couple days after I buy Goldfish crackers at the store

**Nagisoid** (7): Stream Heartbeats by The Knife

**welcome2thejam** (7): Lovely pulsing beat that comes to life at just the right time

**uberpigeon** (7): sure!

## Go girl, give us nothing!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Audibly lol'd at the sudden jumpcut back to nothingness halfway through the song. Right as when the song was about to reach its peak too.

**Roxieloxie** (7): Yeah im sorry i dont have any emotion on this one

**shhhneak** (6.6): When Jeff Probst snuffs someone’s torch:

**nick1372** (6.5): Very cool instrumental but unfortunately Mitski has a tendency to be lyrically vague, I think that bites her on some of her ballads like this one

**shesdoingyoga** (6.5): I do like how the production really helps with the story here

**ReallyCreative** (6): feels a little too much like a cut from BTG I fear...

**scythersboots** (6): this song reflects the unevenness of the album for me, tbh; when it shines, its great but its low points are…painful misses.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Forgot this song was on the album and now I remember why

**beeozan** (3): there truly was nothing. cue commenters that like the song and call my boring comment out you're all very pretty

**Awkward\_King** (2): i hate everything in this song except for the random dramatic build in the middle so that is saving this song from my 0 severely

**cremeebrulee** (2): i was so bored

**IIIHenryIII** (2): are these spoilers? Because there’s like 3 more tracks and I was kinda hopeful.

**TiltControls** (10): And another single down! This song grew on me a ton since they first released it so I’m sad to see it leaving this early. It reminds me of some cheesy country half-ballad that would get too much radio play in the 2000’s. Ah I miss that genre…

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Oh we’re really never getting that country rate are we?

---

## Kind Girls

**alexismateofan** (10): See this is what I thought MUNA did so imagine my shock when I heard the whole album.

**avg-vag** (10): this could also be a premium country song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): these lyrics are hittin a bit too close to home, guess i’ll die

**Frajer** (10): yeehaw rights

**musical\_pyn** (10): muna goes cunt-ry

**nick1372** (10): This song is like a warm, comforting hug. I AM trying to take care of myself and that matters, thank you MUNA.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Yee Haw

**homestarguy** (9.5): Kind Of Nice

**savemeaseat143** (9.2): ever since I wrote about this song for uni it's found a new life in my mind

**IIIHenryIII** (9): country-esque songs are on a different level; I love when artists from other genres do them, because they usually get it right, but I can’t help but wonder if they could pull off a real country album?

**phonethephoenix** (9): this is a good song

**shhhneak** (9): This song has always been a crowd pleaser at MUNA’s concerts in a way that might not succeed here. It’s heartwarming to experience it with people singing at the top of their lungs, finding resonance in the lyrics. I also just really like tender, self-reflective songs.

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): I remain convinced the lyrics should be “i’m the kind of girl who thinks she can” and nothing will change my mind

**flava** (8.5): country music

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): yeehaw (sad)

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): they dedicated this song to the trans and non-binary people in the audience at the last show of theirs I went to and now I just kinda tear up (positively) a little hearing it

**CrimsonROSET** (8): kind of girl who is brave and slays

**scythersboots** (8): appreciate the folksy instrumentation, i like the chorus, but the versus are kind of lackluster for me

**slimboyfriend** (8): is that a mandolin I hear… y’all?

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (7.8): it's an anti-im not like the other girl anthem!

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): hold the girl core

**akanewasright** (7): This is nice but the fact that the was a single when, say, runner’s high wasn’t is a mystery that eludes me

**bigbigbee** (7): power is the kind of girl to not flush the toilet

**Stryxen** (7): this works for me, but it's not particularly… interesting

## Not So Kind Girls

**afs** (7): that's so derivative

**jman457** (6.9): standard acoustic ballad

**cremeebrulee** (6.7): this barbie thinks she can change her attachment style

**impla77** (6.3): disney channel original movie type song (derogatory?)

**Nagisoid** (6): Western Typa Girl by BLACKPINK

**Poydoo** (6): more country than morgan wallen

**welcome2thejam** (6): Thought she sang "not some kind of minor trope who's never gonna change that soap" which honestly took too much mind space to really listen to this song

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.5): it’s a song off MUNA

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): a forgettable guitar ballad that would’ve been right at home in LADN

**beeozan** (4): did i just tune into disney channel

**uberpigeon** (4): this is too earnest for my hating ass

**vayyiqra** (4): this is going for emotional but not connecting with it idk

**Awkward\_King** (2): r u the kind of girl who makes annoying songs too? im coming across as such a hater im sorry this isnt who i am i was hacked

**runaway3212** (2): alas

**plastichaxan** (1): Real women vote for Trump kind of tune (I hope they don’t read this they would absolutely hate me for it)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Why did my dumb ass think this had a chance of winning…

**TiltControls** (9): Misandryheads? Anticountryheads? You decide! Though it’s probably the biggest vibe difference from the rest of the rate, Zach Bryan absolutely nails it here. Maggie isn’t as integral to the track as the other collab bonus tracks, but she still does a great job.

---

alexismateofan (10): Most of the points are for Zach Bryan here, congratulations on the free 10.

BleepBloopMusicFan (10): Why did my dumb ass think this had a chance of winning…

bogo (10): i put down a 10 but just know that this is an 11 in spirit

flava (10): the greatest song of all time i could hardly believe it

IIIHenryIII (10): there’s so much great country music out there, y’all. Don’t shit on the genre if you don’t get out of your comfort zone to give new things a try. Zach is just one of the many great modern country artists, and I’m glad he’s getting the recognition he deserves.

jman457 (10): my unpopular opinion is that Zach Bryan is just lest yassified Ethel Cain

musical\_pyn (10): popheads country rate.....please......

phonethephoenix (10): wait i love this. love the instrumentation and the vocals

TragicKingdom1 (10): he shadowdropped this on youtube for a few hours last christmas which makes sense because this feels like a gift for me personally

uiscebeathaoir (10): just popping into the bonus rate real quick to say this is a serious SOTY contender so far

welcome2thejam (10): Future main pop boy Zach Bryan coming for ya with eleventy-million songs available to rate

Awkward\_King (9.5): did tk make thisf ucking rate

TiltControls (9): Misandryheads? Anticountryheads? You decide! Though it’s probably the biggest vibe difference from the rest of the rate, Zach Bryan absolutely nails it here. Maggie isn’t as integral to the track as the other collab bonus tracks, but she still does a great job.

RandomHypnotica (8.9): who did TK pay to make this happen

savemeaseat143 (8.8): the last minute elevates it

Nagisoid (8): Countryheads rights

ReallyCreative (8): trans ally Zach Bryan!!

slimboyfriend (8): omg his voice sounds like it’s gonna hurl a slur at me any second but he defended trans people on country music twitter so I guess I’ll tell the truth and say this song is actually really good

jackisboredtoday (7.1): this takes its time but the payoff 3 minute in is worth it

seanderlust (7): this is the midpoint between ethel cain and bro country and i'm not sure how to feel about it

afs (6): im sorry

PrimaryCrusaders (5.5): Kinda sounds like they're singing "Gimme my thongs back" in the chorus (I mean the Australian thongs you weirdos)

WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine (4.4): the video for this has some truly bleak shots. pause around 1:08...wow didn't realize i was in east county! how many fucking baeball caps do y'all people have to wear anyways cuts got those smarm strings but aggie rogers really rocks out in the duet. its not bad cut but this is conservative coded

scythersboots (4): is this a high school musical theater production

nick1372 (3): I want to get Zach Bryan sooo bad but I just can't. This song is building so hard to zero payoff and he has no vocal chemistry with Maggie.

plastichaxan (2.5): Maggie sounds so good but this man made me feel so scared 😭

Lilacly\_Adily (1): I almost forgot Maggie was on this song. I had gotten so bored and then she just came out nowhere

shhhneak (1): Introducing a man at this point in the rate is so JUMP SCARE.

**TiltControls** (8): I didn’t care for this as much when the album first dropped, but it’s definitely grown on me in the past year. It’s good background music (complimentary)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): If we broke each album in this rate up into halves and then rated each of the 8 halbums, the front half of Surrender would definitely be my favorite. This song is the point where Surrender dips a bit for me and I think a lot of people. It’s very pretty, but it doesn’t really stick in my brain at all, and I don’t think I’ve ever sought it out to listen to outside of the album.

---

## The thirsty ones

**savemeaseat143** (11): This song is so otherworldly to me, I love it.

**Stryxen** (10): gagging for rain yea

**homestarguy** (9): My midwestern ass as soon as the end of May hits

**IIIHenryIII** (9): me, in an alternate timeline where I grow my own food or believe in gods

**phonethephoenix** (8.6): oh love the end of this. great fade-out

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh i can tell you guys looked closely at the comments of this one

**Poydoo** (8): buzzy 😇

**shesdoingyoga** (8): pretty

**welcome2thejam** (8): Good melody and she sells it, but the intro and outro were easily the most interesting parts, wish those had more of a presence throughout

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.6): me when I want to propose to my Stardew Valley spouse

**1998tweety** (7.5): selena gomez in that one song

**bogo** (7.5): me every day (i love rain)

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (7.5): if we squint hard enough we can bullshit ourselves into thinking that strutty lil' drum beat is trip hop

**cremeebrulee** (7.4): california:

## Hydrophobic

**afs** (6.5): see this is why you dont shatter vocals

**plastichaxan** (6.5): Couldn’t be me but I respect it

**jman457** (6.3): kind of eh, cool outro though

**nick1372** (6): me when it's late October in LA and it's been 87 degrees and sunny for six months straight

**runaway3212** (6): she's cute

**alexismateofan** (4): Go on girl, give us nothing!

**Nagisoid** (4): John Cage in Ratrick teas

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): On one hand, I do get it. This is one of the more derivative 80’s inspired songs on the album and the lyrics are kinda goofy. But on the other hand, I’m boppin!

**TiltControls** (8): This song is so cheesy lmao. But it kind of works? I mean I guess not really if it’s leaving this early, but I like the vibe they’re bringing here.

---

## Fully loaded and pressurized

**Awkward\_King** (10): this song is so sugary i love it!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): i appreciate while dabbling in an 80s pastiche this feels very specific. very early 80s power pop that would be slotted in the early days of MTV. fun vibe

**Frajer** (10): I would hope their partner isn't a liquid or gas

**phonethephoenix** (10): my 11 runner up!! this was my most-listened song on spotify last year. I feel like it's partly because of the short skirt long jacket reference in the bridge scratches my brain?

**ReallyCreative** (10): that chorus is one of the most addictive substances on the planet

**CrimsonROSET** (9): good thing she’s not gas i guess

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Honestly I have no idea what this song means but I love it

**savemeaseat143** (8.5): fun song!

**jman457** (8.2): Fun 80’s throw back

**1998tweety** (8): im getting a little country vibe here and im kinda living for it

**alexismateofan** (8): A song about my least favorite state of matter.

**camerinian** (8): giving this a one point boost to escape the section of comments between 5 and 7 that just say “solid”

**scythersboots** (8): borderline corny but fun

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): is her baby made of osmium

**impla77** (7.5): a solid song

**Poydoo** (7.4): She's so sususususus

**seanderlust** (7.3): the bridge gives me cake's short skirt, long jacket

**Nagisoid** (7): Water in the freezer:

**slimboyfriend** (7): This sounds like a cover of some three hit wonder from the 80s

## Liquid and gas outsold

**uberpigeon** (7): i dont know if im really living for the word solid in this context

**afs** (6.5): we're mostly liquid actually

**bigbigbee** (6.5): guinea pigs are quite solid when you hold them. That’s a rodent with some MEAT on it

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.5): of course she’s solid she cannot be a liquid!!

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): actually humans are mostly liquid if we’re talking about the science of it all

**Roxieloxie** (6.5): the opening of this song started off so cool and i thought this was gonna be a song about like baby gay repression and 'do i want to be her or do i want to date her' and then it didnt and im a little disappointed I cant lie but i see this song in a dcom montage or something which is really cheesy but i respected it

**nick1372** (6): is this feminism or more horny I can't tell

**runaway3212** (6): a solid 6

**uiscebeathaoir** (6): Muna have a distinct style of songwriting that can get incredibly irritating if it doesn’t hit right for me

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6): this one is very preachy

**welcome2thejam** (6): This is gonna go great with my self-insert Solid Snake fic

**JIRACHI** (5): well i don't think she could be liquid or gas so yeah she has to be solid...?

**Stryxen** (5): the background vocals are really generic like.. that's the best you could think of. a nice hook but nothing else to it

**flava** (4): i didn't realise it was possible to date someone in a non-solid state of matter but i guess lesbians are just built different

**IIIHenryIII** (3): so so so boring

**vayyiqra** (3): I wish this album were solid but instead it's more like solidly boring

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): I’m sorry this song is so ugly?? Like it sounds like a robot choir performance. And these lyrics? “She is of material substance”? “She’s pulling the levers”? “She’s checking the levels”? What kind of complements are those?? This might be one of the most embarrassing love/empowerment songs I’ve heard in a while

**homestarguy** (2): I couldn’t rate this 1.975 so I rounded up

**plastichaxan** (2): She’s the opposite of the album omfg

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): My poor meow meow. This is actually one of my favorite songs in the rate and was on my 11 shortlist, but yeah I kinda figured it wouldn’t do too well here. However, she is very gorgeous to me! The strings, the saxophone, the beautifully constructed metaphor about accepting and living with sadness and loss…I love everything about it.

**TiltControls** (8.5): I like that this track doesn’t blow up or go much further than where it started, but I imagine others probably did not. The higher vocals sound fantastic here and are a good choice for the focus of the track, the production is oddly hypnotic too.

---

## Letting it flow

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): -me making shit up- gussy this up a bit and it could be on A Moon Shaped Pool

**phonethephoenix** (10): this song is evocation i love it

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): Some of the album’s best production. Muna with strings is not a combination I was expecting but it delivers so well

**camerinian** (9.5): god what an incredible statement to start wrapping the album with. That central idea of holding onto your pain as an indelible part of yourself but also being past it enough to not let it suffocate you is so inspired and so beautifully put in the clothing metaphor, and the production stays out of its own way to keep a really clear focus. What a nice late album highlight

**alexismateofan** (9): Let Loose I Said LET LOOSE.

**scythersboots** (9): dismissed this one originally bc it does feel v much like… trying to be Imogen Heap but…the lyrics are just so beautiful and poignant and probably so relevant to the whole world at this moment when we’re no longer dealing w covid but (i believe) v much dealing w the fallout.

**walkeddowntheblock** (9): The strings are so lovely

**shhhneak** (8.7): Sad August breakup songs have the tea.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): idk i just wear hoodies does that count

**nick1372** (8): what an evocative chorus

**TiltControls** (10): Okay I’ve had some high scores leave so far, but this one I’m actually sad about. The lyrics hit perfectly and the build-up is sooooo good (even if a bit cheesy). Works perfectly as a closer to the album for me.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This song did really well with the host ballots! From there…well…the star shot in the wrong direction.

---

## Wishmakers

**alexismateofan** (10): That ending. That’s all I have to say. That ending is magnificent. It builds up and then just goes away and it’s so iconic.

**bigbigbee** (10): this is gonna die to balladphobia but it’s one of my faves

**ReallyCreative** (10): very cathartic closer

**seanderlust** (10): I love this metaphor so much. This was an immediate stand-out to me

**phonethephoenix** (9): i really like this bridge sorry!

**scythersboots** (9): v cute

**shhhneak** (9): Somehow they made a Star Light Star Bright sample not corny. Take notes GAYLE.

**savemeaseat143** (8.6): cute closer

**afs** (8.5): omg i love boygenius

**homestarguy** (8.5): This one’s for you, Celeste the Owl

**1998tweety** (8): XG ended

**CrimsonROSET** (8): how common are shooting stars you might be waiting a while

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): carly outsold

**runaway3212** (7): she died like she lived... getting hit by comets

## Staying out of this song’s path

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I blame Gayle for this

**jman457** (5.7): nice but not spectacular ending to the album

**Poydoo** (5.6): boringe

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (5.6): zzzzz

**IIIHenryIII** (5): the people behind the meme song outsold

**Nagisoid** (5): Unrelated but I remember some girls randomly doing a dance routine in a public event to Shooting Star by XG and it was so hilarious

**vayyiqra** (5): this is ok but I am so underwhelmed by this album I feel bad I like MUNA I wanted to like this but found it so bland

**welcome2thejam** (5): I know they shot for a Coldplay climax and imo missed, but I still appreciate the shot attempt

**cremeebrulee** (3.5): needs more scorpio

**beeozan** (3): this album got really boring sorry

**Stryxen** (3): no carly don't retire on the spot muna didn't mean to end you like that (wrote comment before listening :/ )

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): how are there so fucking many song names in multiple rates this cycle. what happened to originality (unserious)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Ugh this was holding on at the bottom of Day 2 for so long, but eventually it succumbed to the pull of Day 1. You know I kinda wonder if it would have stayed there if she just hadn’t done the at-this-point-overdone Britney Spears shoutout.

**TiltControls** (8.5): Easier said than done Maggie. This was flirting with day 2 pretty often, but in the end some final ballots dropped it to the last song of the day.

---

## Covering this song with love

**jman457** (10): Trippy production, a fav deep cut

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This feels like it should be the song over the opening credits of a mid 2000s rom com starring Anne Hatheway (complimentary)

**camerinian** (9.5): love the pacing of putting this between the two most emotionally evocative tracks on the album, as a deliberate grounding to remind yourself of the people around you who keep you accountable and provide with so much. As a standalone it’s maybe not as distinct but it can’t help but benefit both ways where it is, it makes the feeling of the other tracks so much stronger by its presence

**ReallyCreative** (9.4): please rate runners if you see this please use LuAnn's "don't be all uncool" video omg

**IIIHenryIII** (9): when she gets to the just be, be, be, be part I always feel like she’s going to incorporate “do me, baby” Prince

**Stryxen** (9): awesome drums.. very sunny pop rock retro throwback summer day

**savemeaseat143** (8.9): this song is cool

**alexismateofan** (8): God, I wish I could.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): no i can’t be cool maggie it’s 40 degrees Celsius here

**Nagisoid** (8): That's what I'm begging the weather to do!!!

**phonethephoenix** (8): cool!

**seanderlust** (7.5): Maggie I have been trying!!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): try not to tell everyone how amazing you are because you listen to britney spears in 2022 challenge

**1998tweety** (7): something about this song feels a little clunky but its cute

**beeozan** (7): i wish that i could be like the cool kids

**CrimsonROSET** (7): :coolfish:

**Quiet-Tone13** (7): pretty vocals, but kind of boring

**scythersboots** (7): feels v 90s romcom montage

## Fucking off for a month or two

**WaneLietoc + the 6.9/10 Machine** (6.9): sorta an autopilot feel good pep talk bot.

**Poydoo** (6.8): be berexha

**afs** (6.5): im burning up in mid 30s celsius!!!

**nick1372** (6): Something about Maggie's punchy delivery doesn't work here in a song that is supposed to be about chilling out...

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Unfortunately listening to this song on the first day of June did not make me like it any more

**Lilacly\_Adily** (4): the start of the mediocre half of this album

**runaway3212** (4): okay tbh the shorter tracks aren't necessarily better
