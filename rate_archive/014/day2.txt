Heartless
Love Lockdown

vapourlomo: I'd swap Heartless (I love Kanye, but that song's overplayed as hell) with Paranoid then you've got it
[/r/popheads/comments/66y0mc/rate_reveal_the_moody_rb_rate_reveal_day_2_say/dgm4olq/]

=====

deleted: I was actually just thinking CFMF won't make it to top 5 because it was overplayed so much. IDK about Paranoid...I've seen more people talking about Street Lights. 
[/r/popheads/comments/66y0mc/rate_reveal_the_moody_rb_rate_reveal_day_2_say/dgm4v53/]

=====

ignitethephoenix: Yeah I think CFMF is a great song (it's my 11 actually) but the fact it was overplayed may affect the score.
Paranoid is a great song, but heartless is iconic so it may edge it out. Street Lights I didn't really like at all tbh, but maybe it will do okay, I don't think top 5 though. 
[/r/popheads/comments/66y0mc/rate_reveal_the_moody_rb_rate_reveal_day_2_say/dgm541a/]

=====

vapourlomo: They're both overplayed, but there's a huge difference between the two: CFMF is 80x better. Again, I love Kanye way more than the Weeknd, but Heartless is possibly Yeezy's most overrated song, and CFMF absolutely deserved the massive success it got. You can never go wrong with a MJ pastiche!

4 - The Hills 

5 - Marvin's Room

[/r/popheads/comments/66y0mc/rate_reveal_the_moody_rb_rate_reveal_day_2_say/dgm55mg/]

=====

vapourlomo: God I'd love to see Marvin's Room make the top 5 but I'm a pessimist, especially considering this is a pop sub and not an R&B one

=====

ThatParanoidPenguin: **Fun Fact**: the way this is formatted made me assume that the songs taken out were the songs at the end of the album and the first parts of each album were intact, which isn't true.

**HOWEVER.**

All of Drake's album is in order up until Under Ground Kings. Track 9, We'll Be Fine went out yesterday. Make Me Proud and Lord Knows are 10 and 11 on the album.

BBTM is in order from Real Life to Shameless besides Losers which is track number 2 which went out yesterday. The other two tracks, In the Night and Prisoner, are 10 and 13 respectively.

**Truly shows how front-ended both these albums are.** Kanye also lost one song but it was the last song which makes that numbers correlate to tracklist. I don't know why I did this but enjoy.

#**Proud Of You:**
**awhile2**: "name a more iconic duo" {Literally **any other duo**}  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I know this track gets a lot of flack, especially for Nicki's verse, but damn I like it a lot. Drake goes off, as is usual for this album. The pre-chorus is awesome. That transition from Drake to Nicki is dope. It's also nice to have a song with two substantial verses and only two choruses, because Drake's later stuff gets a little too chorus-based for me (Started From the Bottom, looking at you)."  
**ignitethephoenix**: "Drake goes hard on this. I wish I he did more rap like this these days. Nicki is great in this too! I can't believe I've never heard this song before."  
**butistillwork**: "Nicki’s verse is great."  
**thefighter987**: "nicki kills it"  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "Once again Nicki steals the show on a track she's featured on. I ain't complaining though"  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Dricki is a fantastic combination. Always worth a 10 in my book."  
**gannade**: "nicki really did peak in 2010-2011 smh, and only when she's featured on someone else's track"

#**Ashamed Of ~~You~~ Nicki:**
**MrSwearword**: "As if I couldn’t hate Nicki verses more…"  
**Do_This_Often**: "tbh this got the zero because I didn't know what else to give it to and Nicki pisses me off"  
**Armados**: "I can't stand the Nicki Minaj trademark voice"  
**superr_rad**: "i dont think their verses flow well together"  
**ffourthofjuly**: "kinda bad lol"  
**wearingsox**: "This song speaks to me, I always think of myself and all the things I’ve been through and feel motivated! Nicki’s verse could be better tho"  
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I like Drake on this but really wish Nicki’s verse was cut, she really doesn’t fit with the vibe of the song or the album at all and drags the song down, the part where she’s singing is pretty good but then she goes right back to corny lines and silly voices that kill the mood"

#**And This Comment Which I Have No Words For:**
**SkyBlade79**: "why he talkin to her like he’s her dad. That’s not hot."

#**Lord Knows Their Praise:**
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I'm not a big Ross fan, but damn if he doesn't kill this. Drake kills this. Blaze fucking murders this beat."   
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Gotta love that classic Just Blaze production, it's glorious. And that beat switchup too for Rick Ross's verse too, hot damn. And Drake and Rick Ross both go in on this track; I love how Drake ups himself and defends his emotional self-expression and says he's still just as manly and better than all the other rappers who talk shit about him, even if he shows emotion."   
**leviOHsa**: "This song feels big, and tbh put Rick Ross on any song and I'll probably love it."    
**TonyRealm**: "“I’m hearing all of the jokes, I know that they trying to push me / I know that showing emotion don’t ever mean I’m a pussy / Know that I don’t make music for niggas who don’t get pussy / So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me” DAMN. Beat is also fire, wish Ross had a few more lines though."   
**vapourlomo**: "Exhibit A that Drizzy really needs to work with some non-OVO producers more often. Just Blaze KILLED it here"  

#**Lord Knows Their Sins:**
**MrSwearword**: "“even a couple porn stars I’m ashamed to mention” motherfucker, THEY’RE ashamed of YOU."     
**superr_rad**: "i really appreciate the church choir they used but drakes verses are really uninteresting to me"

#**Almost Ever Damn Comment Here Is About Lana:**
**therokinrolla**: "Lana."  
**MrSwearword**: "SLAYbel and Lana Del SLAY"  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I love Lana as much as you guys do, but this collab is super boring. You know it is."
**thefighter987**: "I love lana, but no."  
**butistillwork**: "Lana del Rey was not who I would've expected to appear on this album. Their voices match pretty well though. This is a pretty good song."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "Weeknd and Lana have absolutely amazing chemistry and it shows here. Their styles mesh together very well. I can see why they like working with each other."  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Lana and Weeknd are such a perfect combo. I hope they do more collabs besides this and Stargirl Interlude."  
**pickupthephonebaby**: "Abel x Lana OTP"  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Lana and Abel. I'm surprised this song isn't worse"  
**ignitethephoenix**: "the Weeknd and Lana Del Ray are perfect for each together, they are ying and yang, and it works really well together in this song."  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Lana is far and away the best part of this track."  
**ExtraEater**: ""this song features londa delaware" popheads: ??DADDY??"

#**And This Wildly Descriptive Comment:** 
**eribertknows**: "The hook of this song is addicting (do you see the several things I did there?); they both sound great, and the beat is very nice. I would also like to take this moment to say that I find it literally impossible that these two did not bang before, during, and after the recording of this song, because I know that if I were in a room with either of them, that's all I'd be thinking about, and I'm not even a shallow person, nor am I bisexual.

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Not the biggest fan of Wayne's verse on here either. The beat is great but I feel like this would be more fitted for the first half. However, I will say it definitely deserves to be on here. Kanye's verse is damn strong, and I just dig the delivery he gives us."

**TonyRealm**: "A more restrained track, although Jeezy definitely goes hard (and I love the ad-libs)."  
**vapourlomo**: "It's solid. Shouldn't have been a single, but still solid. We need a Jeezy comeback soon"  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "That drum beat is AMAZING (I'm so sorry I know there are gonna be like 50 of these comments). Young Jeezy's verse is really cool too; lyrically it's nothing insane but it works for the song and the flow and delivery is on point."  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "It's impressive Kanye can still rap how great he is despite how emotional and dark this album is."  
**superr_rad**: "Kanye so fuckin GOAT he named the song as an adjective to describe the song wow"   
**wearingsox**: "The lyrics really encapsulate how narcissistic depression is. All Kanye can think about is himself, how he’s a monster, how he’ll never change. Yet he has this omnipresence in culture. It’s a great contrast."  
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "A little out of place on this album since it’s subject matter is more triumphant but Kanye makes it work, even as he’s talking about how great his career’s been it still sounds like he’s trying to convince himself while he’s telling us, Young Jeezy’s verse is so quotable too"  

#**Amazingly Shit:**

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I know a lot of people love this song and I'mma get flak for this but man this is the worst on the album for me.

#**Taking The Shots:**
**skargardin**: "I’d totally shot for this one."  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I almost forgot how good this song was. A sort of continuation from Over My Dead Body, Shot For Me has some of the best Drake-bear-riding on the album, his flow is nonchalant and harsh yet it's so smooth. And that chorus is just 40 doing magic."    
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "I love the structure of this song, with the first verse being really sweetly sung melodies and then the drums coming in on the hook and then some really incredibly heartfelt rap lyrics in the second verse."  
**ignitethephoenix**: "Drake sounds great on here. Reminds me of Find Your Love, the way he sounds on here."  
**eribertknows**: "Again. Killer. Fucking. Hook. But also everything else. The tone change from the first verse to the second is legendary, and name dropping his exes? Bold. Also this screams The Weeknd, which is usually a good thing."  
**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "I think this is a perfect example of how Drake blends rap and R&B so well. In the first half he is singing, and I for one really like his singing, and then he has a verse that fits in really well. As well as the amazing production that really makes the song."  

#**Ignoring The Shots:**
**Armados**: "If Abel sang the hook and the first verse, this would be ten"  
**leviOHsa**: "Falls a bit flat for me, it kind of feels like the song has no meaning at all."  
**TonyRealm**: "This is one of those songs that flirts between pretentious and sentimental (or is that Drake in a nutshell?). I’m confused about why the “Headlines” beat fades out at the end, why not let it transition seamlessly to the next track?"  
**vapourlomo**: "That "angels" line is so, so bad."  
**wearingsox**: "Something about Drake telling a woman her entire existence revolves around his influence is NOT romantic lol"  
**therokinrolla**: "In this song drake uses something practically unknown in Views: INFLECTION IN HIS VOICE. But the chorus is a let down"  
**strawberryswing1**: "This song and Marvins Room are the root of all "Drake the type of guy that…" jokes."

#**This Is Real Life:**  
**eribertknows**: "Very interesting self-reflective, almost self-deprecating opener. I absolutely love how hard the beat goes at the very beginning and the intensity of the song. A pretty good preview of what's to come."  
**leviOHsa**: "I think the klaxon sounds at the sound, are a great start to the album, and the full song is good."  
**thefighter987**: "solid storytelling, love the synth work"  
**butistillwork**: "Starts out very strong and sounds pretty unusual, liking it. Also like the lyrics, it feels really introspective."  
**ffourthofjuly**: "stunningly underrated track from the weeknd, and takes the grand sounds that he'll implement in the whole album to the next level. it combines atmospheric sounds with large scale production. it's just amazing"  
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "That opening guitar riff is iconic, the instrumentation with the strings is done really well, just a solid opener all around"  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "This fucking amazing fantastic perfect intro? I'm shooketh"

#**This Is Fantasy:**
**Do_This_Often**: "I still do not forgive Abel for this opener after all his others, come the fuck on this should have been Lonely Star/Starboy tier"  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Why are you so dramatic, calm down"  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I feel like this song wanted to be a strong track on the album but it leads to nowhere with its production."  
**imnoteventhatfunny**: "weird song. it's really good for like a minute then just loses all steam. opens feeling like it's building to some big chorus, and the build is fantastic but then the chorus comes and it just kind of whimpers away instead."  
**therokinrolla**: "this song kinda feels like he is kicking down the door and saying “I’M HERE BITCHES” during the verses but he didn’t pull off the slow chorus very well."   
**strawberryswing1**: "I wish he didn’t slow down the tempo during the chorus"  
**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "I don’t like the hook and it’s a bit too long but not that bad."

**Lowest Scores:** (3 x1) SkyBlade79

#**Good News:**
**therokinrolla**: "Oh shit this bop? You don’t like it????? Well **I HAVE SOME REAL BAD NEWSSS** *punches you* "  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Love the autotune in this one. It's not one of the tracks I think about when talking about 808s, but it's pretty heartbreaking."  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "this is a funky fresh beat"  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Really nice song, fits the vibe of the album really well, and the strings are beautiful, but I would say it isn't a standout on the album."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "Fucking brilliant song. Love the instrumentation and arrangement. When the strings come in it's a thing of beauty. Another work of art. I don't know if you can tell yet but I absolutely adore this album."  
**butistillwork**: "The drums and strings are fucking me up. I love the production on this album so much. The lyrics get his feelings across very succinctly."  
**superr_rad**: "when THAT instrumental hits, you know the one, I DIEEEEEE"  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "Easily the most heartbreaking track on an album about heartbreak. I hope this sub doesn't do it dirty." {WELP}  

#**Bad News:**
**TonyRealm**: "I prefer the instrumental outro part with the strings than Kanye’s crooning, which neither interests nor moves me."  
**vapourlomo**: "Not bad, but probably the album's weak link. A little forgettable."  
**ignitethephoenix**: "Once again this song should have been shorter and trimmed down to around 2:30-3min. The violins addition after the lyrics was good, but the last 40s was pointless."  
**skargardin**: "Could’ve been a little shorter with that outro."  
**SkyBlade79**: "boring and I just don’t get it"

#**And This Name Dropping Comment:**
**eribertknows**: "Thank you, Alexis Phifer, for being a HEARTLESS bitch who caused Kanye's HEARTBREAK by telling him the BAD NEWS and making him so PARANOID that he just had to write this AMAZING album to tell you you ain't shit, you bitch. Also the drums in this thing are out of this world."

#**Free To Go:**
**femaleghostbuster**: "this has been stuck in my head for 7 years. and I'm not even mad"  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Robocop is a great movie, and a great song. I'm not the biggest fan of the lyrics here, they're a bit more cheesy than the rest, but they are fun. What I do love is how the beat takes so many different directions. Pop song > strings > this crazy electronic drop thing? And I also loved Stephen King at the time (still do tho) so those references were pretty funny. And that outro kinda drags but in a good way?"  
**superr_rad**: "This song was close to being my 11 cause I KNOW people wont appreciate it as much as it deserves"  
**eribertknows**: "There's so much happening in this song both instrumentally and lyrically and it all works really great. Top bop."  
**wearingsox**: "the way the drums kick in omg, Kanye is frustrated, yet it’s this kinda whimsical song that makes you feel nostalgic. Lessons learned, there’s humor in it, Kanye isn’t angry. Also funny in retrospect as Kim is the epitome of spoiled LA girl lol (I love Kimye don’t get me wrong)."  
**TonyRealm**: "In my opinion, one of Kanye’s most unique songs. Unlike much of 808s, the production here feels bright, almost radiant with those heavy strings, backing vocals, and glockenspiel notes. Along with Kanye’s extra-processed vocals, the robotic sound effects are thematic and spice up the track nicely (I’ve heard some say it’s excessive or just plain weird, but if I have a musical bias it’s in favour varied production, sorry not sorry). Interestingly, during the outro the autotune gets dropped, and I think that’s a refreshing choice."

#**Under Arrest:** 
**MrSwearword**: "gurl no"  
**Armados**: "I know a lot of people like this song, but it's too corny for me."  
**vapourlomo**: "The production on this...hasn't aged well. Still a great melody."  
**ffourthofjuly**: "slightly better than paranoid but still bad"  
**skargardin**: "I wouldn’t want no Robocop either.”  
**therokinrolla**: "Yikes. YIKES. This is awful. The dreamlike horns don’t fit the song at all, the hook is awful, and this song makes my ass not want to boogie but instead inverse. ugh"  
**strawberryswing1**: "Kanye ily but what are you doing"  
**leafsnash61**: "Filler, admittedly."

#**And Doc Spilling That Truth Tea:**
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This movie has more references on Misery than RoboCop tbh."

**imnoteventhatfunny**: "fantastic Kanye production and Abel is smooth af here."  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "How is it that Kanye is the best part of Abel's album too?"  
**dirdbub**: "shoutout to the distorted bridge, which [Genius](https://genius.com/The-weeknd-tell-your-friends-lyrics) tells me is Kanye West lmao"  
**pickupthephonebaby**: "a strong 11 candidate for me"  
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This song makes me want a million more Kanye/Weeknd songs, the beat is amazing for as simple as it is, and Abel goes off with his sing/rap style that I love when he goes into, I also love the double meaning of the whole ‘tell your friends about me’ theme"

#**NOT Telling Their Friends:**
**MrSwearword**: "funky, but this is this Abel Levine? BYE"  
**eribertknows**: "The lyrics are just too much honestly. I feel like it was a strange decision to put this song in the album: this was the ultimate pop crossover album, but yet most people listening to him for the first time would have no idea what he's talking about. That being said, Kanye obviously kills the production, and the song is still fun to listen to."  
**TonyRealm**: "A very understated and borderline boring track. Abel’s vocals rides the beat well and the lyrics are standard Weeknd fare. That distorted Kanye part is probably the biggest eyebrow-raiser, and although it doesn’t really add anything, it does break up the monotony. Guitar solo is fire."  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Why does this beat sound like it's on the wrong song?"

#**Acquainted With This Track:**
**SkyBlade79**: "One of my favorite Abel songs. It took me a while to learn to enjoy it, but now the epic beat, amazing delivery, and sweet and flirty lyrics sound amazing. There were a lot of candidates for my 11, but this beat them out by a very very small margin."  
**eribertknows**: "Legit still waiting on a video and a proper release for this song. This had potential to be a massive hit - it was hanging on the Hot 100 for a long time - but he never made a video for it and it eventually died down. My favorite BBTM song along with The Hills - also need to have sex while listening to this one. I just love this song beyond words."  
**ignitethephoenix**: "I feel this is one of the most underrated songs on the album. The drums, beat and the change of style throughout the song all works so well in this song, went it could have gone wrong."  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Solid track, I like the way the vibe hard-switches for the outro."  
**Jelboo**: "THOSE DRUMS BEFORE THE INTRO DROPS"  
**ffourthofjuly**: "it's pretty much another version of often but i'm not complaining"

#**Distancing Theirselves:**
**Do_This_Often**: "girls born in the 90's is so much better than this, that outro tease ugh"  
**TonyRealm**: "The outro > everything else"  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "You have me touching zero part of my body."  
**FishM8**: "girls born in the 90s wouldve made it harder to choose an 11"  
**imnoteventhatfunny**: "great song but it was better when it was Girls Born In The 90s."  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "I mean it's alright nothing groundbreaking here. I kinda got bored halfway through. Redeemed by the last minute though"  
**skargardin**: "The outro wasn’t really necessary imo, it would’ve been better without it."  
**gannade**: "outro is so unnecessary"

#**Not Over It:**
**Nfranklin50**: "This is probably one of my top 5 songs of all time. to me everything about this song is perfect. This is the best version of Drake we will ever get. In my opinion he's at his best when he is slowed down and chill and just being 100% honest with us like he is in this song. He's still being very braggadocious but it's in so much more of a believable and relateable way. And even then he's still ragging on himself. There's something so real and genius about the way he builds himself up and tears himself down and then finds an even medium in this song. It's a perfect song to just sit and relax to and reflect where you've come from. I've found whether I've come off a time in my life where I felt like I was on top of the world or I was just trying to put myself back together this is the song that helps me find peace because I can relate to every word."  
**pickupthephonebaby**: "iconic intro"  
**leafsnash61**: "Yay!"  
**femaleghostbuster**: "hot damn what an opener!"  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is an essential Drake opener. The instrumental has some dope layered piano, and it was this moment that I knew the album was the real deal, and it wasn't just the singles that were good. Chantal Kreviazuk kills her part as well."  
**therokinrolla**: "damn. This song wrecked me. So much better than anything from Views and gave me a much better outlook on the rest of the album. The instrumentals are beautiful and Drake’s voice has EMOTION"  
**eribertknows**: "Honestly Drake could have dropped his worst ever verse on this and it would still be a very high score just because of that fantastic hook. But no, his verses are pretty nice and this song sets the mood perfectly for what's to come."  
**awhile2**: "“jealousy is just love and hate at the same time” goat instagram caption"

#**Over It:**
**leviOHsa**: "Dropped some points purely for the line "Don't make me break your Kevin Hart""  
**TonyRealm**: "Some of the lines are facepalm worthy (“Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some”, “Don’t make me break your Kevin Hart, boy”, and of course “I killed everybody in the game last year” no you didn’t drake and I don’t hear any conviction in your voice lol). But I could legitimately listen to this a thousand times and still not get sick of it. Everything just fits seamlessly, the hook is beautiful, and that melodic beat is really well made (gj 40)."  
**whatsapilot**: "The beginning sounds like the setup for something amazing but Drake's delivery soon turns out to be pretty bad. I know many people love this song, and I can see why. The production is just flawless. But Drake almost ruins this song for me. It's still good, though."  
**dirdbub**: "what is it with Drake and Asian girls"  
**skargardin**: "Intro is nice but the rest is just Drake as usual, solid album opener but not that memorable."  
**SkyBlade79**: "“shout out to asian girls let the lights dim some” lol wtf"

When Kendrick Lamar has the best song on a Drake album...

---
#**Every Comment Is About Kendrick:**
**MrSwearword**: "cute for Kendrick."  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Kendrick Stan reporting in. This was a big move for the rapper, and the result is a compelling interlude that honestly feels like its own song. He kills the small part he has, and might've been one of the best verses of the year."  
**maadbutterfly**: "Funny that the best song on this album is a song Drake isn't even on ;)"  
**eribertknows**: "Obviously Kendrick fucking murders this but I'm not entirely sure why there's a Kendrick song (not feature) on a Drake album (tho he mentions Drizzy a couple times). But it's a good song."  
**thefighter987**: "I love kendrick but I don't really know what he's doing here"  
**TonyRealm**: "Oh hey Kendrick. The thing that stood out to me was the flow; he essentially ignores the beat and stamps his own cadence over it in such captivating fashion. One could argue this is the most impressive verse on the album."  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "DRAKE AND KENDRICK NEED TO COLLAB MORE"  
**vapourlomo**: "When I first heard this album, King Kendrick was out of my radar, so I thought Drake just put some weird vocal filter on it. Kendrick's done better, but it's still nice"  
**ignitethephoenix**: "Kendrick's flow is fire on here. I guess it's pretty decent for an interlude."  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Kendrick bein Kendrick is always A+"  
**ffourthofjuly**: "this is one of kendrick's best features, and everything on this song is impeccable. it's a highlight on drake's album and continues the More Life trend of drake's best songs on his album not even featuring him :meghan:"  
**4Roux**: "wherein Kendrick is the highlight of a Drake album"  
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "One of the best interludes ever, Kendrick’s verse on here is seriously underrated among his best verses"  
**pickupthephonebaby**: "Kendrick fans like to hate on Drake a lot but at least Drake brought Kendrick to the mainstream. Would have happened eventually but whatever. Dude gave Kendrick a whole song on his album and it's amazing."  
**SkyBlade79**: "Kendrick sounds amazing. I love this one, and Drake is not even a factor in it.Wow. What a waste."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "Can't say enough great things about this track. Absolute masterpiece, from the eerie beat to Kendrick's prophetic verse. Blew me away when I first heard it and it still does 6 years later."  
**ExtraEater**: ""kendrick"... !!!!!!"  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I expected a lot more from the GOAT Kendrick but he's still fire on this."

#**They Will:**
**ffourthofjuly**: "this is one of the best album openers i have ever heard in the context of the sounds of the record. every time i hear this song i am just overcome with a wave of sadness and isolation, as kanye immerses you in his emotions. it's one of my favorite kanye songs and nothing will come close to my feelings whenever i hear it."  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is honestly a legendary intro at this point. It's barren, minimalistic, and cold, and possibly the saddest song on the album. And those beeps and drums are iconic."  
**eribertknows**: "Alright so this isn't even the best album opener Kanye has put out, but holy shit, what a fucking song. The "hey hey hey hey" is fucking brilliant and amazing and just there's not enough words to describe it. Autotune should be really called Kanyetune because let's be real, Kanye invented it. I guess the only criticism is the really long outro but it's amazing so I'm not even mad tbh."  
**TonyRealm**: "Immediately sets the tone: if you didn’t get the memo, this is no ordinary Kanye album. Like most of the other songs, “Say You Will” is musically quite minimal, with a sparse drum beat + heartbeat-like beeping, constant backing vocals, occasional piano, and auto-tuned vocals lamenting about an ex. It feels like Kanye is going for a “less is more” approach here, which can be effective but requires the listener to buy in. In a sense, it serves as a sort of litmus test; if you don’t like this, you probably won’t like the rest, especially the deeper cuts. Personally, I wished the lyrics had more to them, that the production varied a bit, and that it ended about a minute earlier, but I still like the song. [The remastered version with Caroline Shaw is also worth a listen; I like how the production fades in and out & diversifies throughout, although some of the backing vocals are a bit overpowering. Although it doesn’t really fit with the album, I think it’s a better standalone track than the original.]"  
**vapourlomo**: "This song is Kanye's favorite Kanye song. I wouldn't go that far (Runaway exists), but he does have pretty great taste. That final verse gets me every time."  
**butistillwork**: "To me, this is the Runaway of 808s. At a whopping 6:20, there's no way the simple drawn out beat and choir should work, but they do. It also gives you a good taste of what the rest of the album is gonna be like."  
**superr_rad**: "ummmmm i might be rating this whole album 10s, but we'll see. this is such a perfect intro, kanye gives so much emotion in his delivery and his words, its really touching. i adore this album and i have the cd in my car, so the opening of this song puts my heart in a happy place"  
**letsallpoo**: "the ending gives me "background noise at the penultimate dungeon in a jrpg" teas"  
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "The perfect intro to this album, it’s depressing and beautiful and both empty and epic, it sets you up perfect for what you’re about to experience and that ending loop with no Kanye vocals really helps get you into the mood"  
**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "A perfect opener to an incredible album. In this song Kanye kicks off the themes of being heartbroken, with so much emotion, or more like lack of emotion through the autotune he uses. His singing is really good here, surprisingly, as well as the incredible synthpop production. He also begins working with strange song structure, with 3 MINUTES of the instrumental going after he stops singing, which is insane, but works so well as the choir continues in the background. The three minutes also just puts you in a somber mood only Kanye can create with his production."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "The intro to one of the most influential and important albums in recent decades. Absolutely beautiful song. From the choir to the heart monitor in the background, everything about is is cold, eerie and heartbreaking. The extra 3 minutes with just the instrumental only add to that feeling. A work of art"

#**They Won’t:**
**MrSwearword**: "chop three minutes off & it’d be better"  
**Do_This_Often**: "Caroline Shaw version is better imo"  
**thefighter987**: "heartfelt and well produced, but too slow and monotonous for my taste."  
**awhile2**: "not really the best idea to put a song that sounds like a closer as the intro IMO"  
**ignitethephoenix**: "would be better if it was shorter at the end. Love the production of this song, really has a great sadness and tension to it"  
**therokinrolla**: "a too slow too boring introduction to an otherwise excellent album. A nice intro to this albums great production tho"  
**SkyBlade79**: "Outro wayyy too long and boring. The vocals are pretty nice tho."  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This song didn't need to be 6 minutes tbh."  
**gannade**: "there is no reason for this song to be 7 min long and i would be fine with the length if the song didnt just repeat the same chorus and beat for 5 min of it. cool beat but honestly this song just pisses me off the longer it goes on"

#**Lovin’ The Crew:**
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "One of my early favorites, and as a big Weeknd fan at the time, I was super excited to hear this. And man did it not disappoint. That beat is fierce, and just destroys speakers. There's so much contrast, and The Weeknd just murders this track. Drake's verse just finishes the thing, and that beat switch is one of the best 40's ever done."  
**eribertknows**: "I mean this is basically a The Weeknd song, let's be real here. Great Drake feature too. But seriously this song is straight fire, and I'm kinda glad it's not on House of Balloons but in here instead, even though it would have perfectly fit there too. I hope by the time the rate reveal comes we're gonna have some more OVOXO to believe in."  
**thefighter987**: "This is more of a weeknd song than drake tbh. He steals the show and has the best 60 seconds on the album."  
**vapourlomo**: "Aubrey+Abel 4eva"  
**TonyRealm**: "This is really Abel’s song, but the way the drums switch up on Drake’s verse is my favourite part.”  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "The "They lovin' the crew" hook is a little repetitive, but everything else about this track is perfect; the production is fantastic, the song is a great "We made it to the top" anthem, and I love the squad pride, it feels really sincere and loving and works really well with the "We're better than everyone else" vibe of the song."  
**superr_rad**: "This might be rated higher cause of Abel..but yall will never know"  
**strawberryswing1**: "Drake and The Weeknd together?? Instant 10/10. Production here is great too."  
**pickupthephonebaby**: "OVOXOTWOD"  
**PossumAloysuis**: "The second best OVOXO track. Absolutely excellent from the intstrumental to the hook. Everything about this song is great. Shit became a mantra back in high school. Takes me back"

#**Hatin’ The Crew:**
**femaleghostbuster**: "This song makes my head hurt"  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "The Weeknd ruins this. Much like 6 inch. But still a bop nonetheless"  
**ignitethephoenix**: "pretty disappointing for a song with the Weeknd in it. I was hoping to like this more (since I love the Weeknd) but I just didn't. The Zone is way better. The beat at the beginning has so much hype but then it doesn't fit well with the rest of the song"  
**therokinrolla**: "The quick section of instrumentals really make my booty go but the rest of the song let’s it down. I also don’t like the Weeknd so."

#**They Know:**
**strawberryswing1**: "I fucking LOVE this song. It was one of the first rap songs I ever listened to and when it first came out it I listened to it on repeat for like a week. 6 years later and it's still a banger. There are a handful of songs that deserve an 11 in this rate but this song is getting mine because of sentimental reasons."  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "If you look in the dictionary for banger you'll find "Headlines" as the definition"  
**Armados**: "I wish I had another eleven"  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I listened to this song so goddamn much in high school oh man. This was my introduction to Drake, and when this song blew up I had to check it out. It kinda blew me away, because no one else was really doing stuff like this, and I was happy to run off to the nearest store and pick up an iTunes card. I can probably still recite the verse, and that chorus is just awesome. And the beat... ah my god so perfect."  
**leviOHsa**: "It's a classic Drake track, there's not much wrong with it."   
**thefighter987**: "a pretty good combination of his hip hop and r&b styles."  
**TonyRealm**: "Solid throughout."  
**therokinrolla**: "I jokingly quote this song so much. Its also a dope AF track with exciting production. God this is all so much better than Views"  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I forgot how much this song I loved this son holy shit"  
**eribertknows**: "The subtle change from the mood of the first two tracks is just a bit too abrupt, but the song in itself is fucking great and I really hope Drake goes back to this sort of stuff soon."

#**They Don’t Know:**
**MrSwearword**: "sort of cute beat with Drake half-assing as usual."  
**Do_This_Often**: "anthem rap icon but I cannot take this seriously anymore"  
**PossumAloysuis**: "I got sick of this real quick cause this was way overplayed on radio and at my school. Brought my enjoyment down a bit but still a quality song. Good single"

**leafsnash61**: "This is my all-time favourite Drake song. Everyone can relate to this if they've ever been hopelessly in love or out of a break up or what have you. There is something here for everyone."  
**vapourlomo**: "Hands down, the best song Drake will ever write, and if I'm sad enough, you might catch me calling it the best R&B song of the 21st century"  
**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "This is my favorite Drake song."  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "This is Drake at his Drakeiest and he makes an irrefutable case for why the rap game needs him. If that "We threw a party, yeah we threw a party" verse doesn't get you at least a little bit then congratulations, you might be the first person I've ever met who's more dead inside than me."  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I wasn't super on board with this at first, but then it started to click. It's easily Drake's saddest song, and it earns that near-6 minute length. The instrumental would've been make or break, and it's a major make. It's subtle in all the right ways, and there's a ton of nuance to such a quiet song."  
**eribertknows**: "THIS IS A FUCKING CLASSIC AND THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO PUT IT. I think it would have been much more commercially successful if it was released around now though. Also TIL that the girl on the phone is actually an ex of Drake and she sued him for using her voice. Come on girl, I'm just saying you could do better."  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Moody king. Invented Calling your exes. twice When will your fave?"  
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Drake’s masterpiece, I know now he’s pretty much a brand but holy shit this song is some of the rawest, barest emotional stuff I’ve heard from a big artist, it’s incredibly produced by 40 and Drake’s singing on this fits the mood perfect, easily my favorite Drake song"

#**Stop:**
**Do_This_Often**: "this doesn't deserve an 11 if it gets one sorry overrated" {It got four}  
**Nfranklin50**: "The clean version is better just because of The Weeknd in the chorus. Dear God it gives me chills"  
**TonyRealm**: "I recall this song being really polarizing amongst friends of mine. Some thought it was whiny and unappealing, others liked the vibe. To me, it’s all about empathizing with the feelings of missing and/or drunk dialing an ex; if you feel like Drake communicates that well and you can relate or appreciate, you might like it. Otherwise, give it a pass. (As an aside, do people like the piano outro? I normally love Gonzales’ work this feels way too long.)"  
**butistillwork**: "Is this a nice guy song?"  
**wearingsox**: "tbh this is about when I’m over listening to Drake"  
**SkyBlade79**: "The little “are you drunk right now” parts are so extremely annoying. The whole theme of this song is so dumb and pathetic… I hate this one so much. He acts so self righteous and stuck up."
