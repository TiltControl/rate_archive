**Kanye West** is many things: **rapper, songwriter, record producer, fashion designer, entrepreneur**, and that’s just what I stole from his Wikipedia page! To the general public, however, he is often seen as one thing and one this only: an egotistical douchebag. While this there is certainly truth to this claim, West’s 2008 release ***808s and Heartbreak*** is one that can silence haters and make them see that this is a man with **many dimensions**.  

This is Yeezy’s fourth album, a followup to the education trilogy that included 2004’s ***The College Dropout***, 2005’s ***Late Registration***, and 2007’s ***Graduation***. While those hugely successful albums were very uniquely Kanye, 808s veered even **further from what was expected from a hip-hop artist** at the time, leaning towards **electropop more so than rap**. This was a big risk that **paid off** in spades. While it was somewhat divisive at the time of its release, it is now acknowledged as one of the **most influential albums** in the history of pop music, inspiring many of today’s biggest artists, including **Drake**. It is also a hugely personal record, released following a recent breakup with West’s longtime girlfriend and the loss of his mother. 

With this album, Kanye lays bare a more **sensitive side** to his personality that is rarely acknowledged by most, but his biggest fans know and love him for. **808s and Heartbreak** was a hit in 2008, debuting at **number one on the Billboard 200**. It produced two of West’s best known singles, ***“Love Lockdown”*** (**which debuted at number ~~one~~ three on the Billboard 100**) and ***“Heartless”*** (**which reached number two**).

 ^Write-Up ^by ^/u/DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy   
***Beauty Behind The Madness*** is the second studio album (fifth music project if we are counting his mixtapes) from Canadian singer Abel Tesfayte aka **The Weeknd**.    

After the success of his debut studio album ***Kiss Land***, Abel attempted to push himself into the mainstream by contributing to **The Hunger Games: Catching Fire** soundtrack in which he is a featured artist in Sia’s ***‘Elastic Heart’*** with Diplo as well as contributing a song of his own called ***‘Devil May Cry’***. He also had a duet with fellow Republic Records labelmate ~~and Queen of Donuts and Hating America~~ **Ariana Grande** titled ***‘Love Me Harder’*** from Grande’s second studio album ***‘My Everything’***. The song was released as the fourth single of Grande’s album and went on to be a huge commercial success, with the song peaking at **#7 in the Billboard Hot 100**. 

Abel also contributed to the **soundtrack of Fifty Shades of Grey** with a song titled ***‘Earned It’*** which was released as the lead single for the soundtrack. The single peaked at **#3 in the Billboard Hot 100**, pushing Abel further to the mainstream. With these successes, all eyes are on him on what he will do next. 

He released ***Beauty Behind the Madness*** on August 28, 2015, in which contained songs produced by many high-profile producers that included the likes of **Kanye West** and the King of Bops **Max Martin** and contains collaborations with **Labrinth**, **Ed Sheeran** and **Lana Del Rey**. The album peaked at #1 in the Billboard 200 and made Abel aka The Weeknd a household name.

**//Rules//**  
---
___
* **Listen To Every Song**, this should be obvious. I cannot accept your ballot if a score is missing because it will crash the program that I am using to help me calculate the scores, I will have more on this later.    
* Rate each song between **1 and 10**. Decimals are allowed but please use only one decimal space (**8.2** for example), anything with two spaces will be a a pain. So please nothing like 8.25400266565665 for a song okay.   
* You are allowed **one 0 and one 11**. Use the wisely. This is one score total, not per album. So please don't rate multiple songs 0 or 11 as for you only have one of each **for the WHOLE RATE**.   
* **You CAN change your scores at anytime until I close submissions**. If your scores do change, PLEASE PM me the new scores.   
* **I WILL NOT be taking in scores that have an average of less than 4.0 on an album.**   
* I will be using a pre-prepared link for you to submit you score. **Please follow the format that is given below the rules**. You can copy and paste it into a word document or notepad, but please follow the format when submitting.  
* Your scores **SHOULD NOT** be considered confidential. *(Because if you give The Hills a 0 the world will know it.)*  
* Comment writing is encouraged **HEAVILY**. Feel free to not leave comments on songs but it is encouraged that you do.

This will help me tremendously if you follow the following format for your scores.  

This is correct:

> The Hills: 6.9 This was better when it was called *'Mood Music'*!

These are INCORRECT:

> The Hills: 6.9: This was better when it was called *'Mood Music'*!

> The Hills:This was better when it was called *'Mood Music'*! 6.9 

> The Hills: I'm giving this a 6.9 cause jokes ha ha. 

> The Hills: 6.9-This was better when it was called *'Mood Music'*!

> The Hills: 6.9 (This was better when it was called *'Mood Music'*!)

> The Hills: 6.9 - This was better when it was called *'Mood Music'*!
