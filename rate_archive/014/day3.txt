#**Keeps Em Coming:**
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This song should’ve been so much bigger than it was. I think this is a direct contribution of the Wanderlust remix, and this is probably the most outrun-y song I’ve heard on the radio. The album should’ve probably ended with this."  
**Armados**: "This song is poppishly amazing"  
**ignitethephoenix**: "Another dark song with MJ elements and is a total bop. I love it, and I'm glad this was a single."  
**eribertknows**: "I had almost forgotten how great this song is! His voice sound gorgeous here, and this song is basically the part 2 of Belong to the World from Kiss Land. I think the lyrics are also probably the deepest and the best thought-out in the album. Disappointed it didn't reach the popularity of Can't Feel My Face."  
**thefighter987**: "as good as most michael jackson classics."  
**leafsnash61**: "The Weeknd needs to do more MJ-influenced songs. They p -- wait, I said this already. Point stands!"  
**PossumAloysuis**: "Another underrated track. Pure pop perfection but keeps the dark Weeknd ethos alive. BBTM is when he finally got the hang of that balance."  
**dirdbub**: "lmao this album rebounds so hard from *Earned It* it's not even funny"  
**SkyBlade79**: "Awesome storytelling piece. Reminds me of Billie Jean a little bit melody-wise; one of the best shows of the similarity between MJ and Abel."  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I feel like the chorus is a bit too rough and needed more work but this is a bop and the obvious MJ influences are there in this song."  
**imnoteventhatfunny**: "Abel shows off those MJ vibes that will come into play on Starboy more, but this track alongside I Feel It Coming and D.D. are his best examples of this sound."  
**whatsapilot**: "Probably my favorite Max Martin-produced song ever"

#**Still Sane:**
**4Roux**: "The closest we'll get to upbeat & playful on 808s. It also has my favorite silly Kanye wordplay (Kanyeism?) "I can make you come/I can make you go""  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "DUDES! This song gave me one half of my username! I used to run to this song like on a daily basis, and that synthy instrumental was one of the most mind-blowing things I've ever heard. It's also how I ended up listening to Justice because I was looking for more stuff with that sound and someone recommended that band. And Mr Hudson is like icing on the cake here."  
**eribertknows**: "Listening to this now just reminds me of so many tracks that came out shortly after this album and how so many of them tried to sound like this. Also yes Cudi kill that hook boii."  
**femaleghostbuster**: "this song doesn't get the love it deserves"  
**MrSwearword**: "underappreciated and that’s sad."  
**TonyRealm**: "First, the new mix (and the video version) are much better than the one on the album, which lacks some punch due to the more muffled synths (also I don’t like the intro conversation). The new mix is more electro-influenced and sounds much more lively, more suited to the quick pace in which Kanye delivers his lines. The hooks are a bit lacklustre compared to those verses, but it’s is a killer tune regardless."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "Immaculately produced and arranged. Kanye and No I.D. absolutely knocked it out of the park with this album. Mr. Husdon killed the hook, perfect fit. Exemplary song. Love the break at the end."  
**ExtraEater**: "when i first heard this i thought, "hmm, i can just feel that this was innovative in some way." but i might be wrong"  
**butistillwork**: "While I don't think it's his best song, in the context of the whole album it just works for me, because it shows how multifaceted one's feelings after a breakup are. Probably the most upbeat song on the album."  
**superr_rad**: "i cant even type WORDS to describe how great this song is, from the laughs to the chorus and synths im DYING"  
**awhile2**: "GOAT music video, they hyped the hell out of it on MTV when i went through my brief MTV phase. Also this is much better than the trash Ye x Mr Hudson collab that is Supernova"

#**Might Be Paranoid:**
**Do_This_Often**: "underrated but the outro is wayyy too long"  
**ffourthofjuly**: "this is my least favorite kanye song, it doesn't fit in the soundscape of the album, it deserves highkey to flop because it is overrated the melody sucks its just Bad"  
**strawberryswing1**: "Wow everything about this song is annoying"

If y’all wanna fucking come at me for this, first off wtf is a cold winter, blame my Florida life, second off that noise will drive me insane, you know exactly which one.

#**Warm At Heart:**
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This song is just insane. That rough instrumental is a preview of what Yeezus would give us. It's a closer that harnesses the sheer power of strong percussion, and those synths fit in flawlessly. It's also the perfect length, which is a daring choice for a Kanye closer, which usually ends up being kinda long."  
**leviOHsa**: "I adore this song."  
**thefighter987**: "Amazing drums and keys."  
**TonyRealm**: "I don’t mind how both versions start (video = “memories made in…” fade in, album = sudden static into 1st verse), and in fact that’s how I’d sum up the whole thing: I don’t mind it."  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Literally the only reason I love this song so much is because of Pentatonix. Deadass."  
**butistillwork**: ""It's 4 a.m. and I can't sleep." Saaaaaame. This is so oddly hopeful and at the same time totally desperate."  
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Great outro for the album even if its not really the last song, Kanye sounds so empty after getting everything out on the album and its just so sad"  
**SkyBlade79**: "#sadbois :("  
**Itsafudgingstick**: ""it's 4 am and I can't sleep" same ye"  
**leafsnash61**: "I can only listen to this in the winter (much like the whole album) - it doesn't feel right elsewhere. Great song."  
**ExtraEater**: "tangentially related history facts; during the trail of tears it was like one of the coldest recorded winters ever damn"  

#**Tears For Fears Comments:**
**PossumAloysuis**: "Excellent outro. Love the Tears For Fears interpolation. Sums up the album incredibly. An amazing eulogy for both his mom and his engagement. Perfect end to a perfect album"  
**Jelboo**: "Brilliant! That Tears For Fears 'sample', the instrumentals..."  
**femaleghostbuster**: "[love it. did you know this song was based on a Tears For Fears song? I sure didn't!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtHjY3K5g1E)"

#**All These Comments Are About Kid Cudi:**
**eribertknows**: "KING OF PUTTING THE ACTUAL INTRO TO THE ALBUM AS THE SECOND TRACK! Also yes Cudders moan on these hoes."  
**Do_This_Often**: "top tier cudi moans"  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is one of the Kid Cudi Kanye collabs ever made. It would serve as a great intro as well, and there's not much to hate. There's just something about it that doesn't make it as bombastic or shocking as some of the other tracks - that's not a bad thing by any means but the production on some of the other tracks are just bonkers in comparison."  
**vapourlomo**: "Teaming up with Cudi was super-duper obvious, but it's the best kind of obvious. Perfect thesis statement."  
**chris_ou_poitrine**: "Cudi and Ye can do no wrong together"  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "You already know that Cudi sounds freaking phenomenal here, and the melodic driving piano/cello hip-hop beat is incredible. And Kanye's lyrics give such a good counterpoint to the hook's lyrics; Kanye's introspective verses are full of short and choppy lines, almost like his thoughts are so disjointed that he can't ground himself and his train of thought is cutting itself off, and then the hook comes in and you get this full picture of someone who knows everything they're doing wrong but still can't stop doing everything wrong and falling apart, like some kind of inevitable train wreck. This is such a good song."  
**superr_rad**: "KANYE AND CUDI REALLY CAN'T GO WRONG LIKE,,,I GOTTA GET WITH IT!!!"  

#**And The Other Comments:**
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "One of my favorite Kanye songs ever. The song is about how even though Kanye is rich and famous, he’s alone and unhappy and depressed, and it becomes a really relatable and vunerable moment on the album while also working as a song. Kid Cudi’s hook is one of his best ever and the beat is great, almost lo-fi. I really just love how Kanye can paint these pictures on this song, you can really see how the end of his engagement and his mom’s death affected him, and even though his star was really rising it wasn’t making him happy. Kanye is such a larger then life figure that it makes his real raw moments like this more impactful."  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: ""My god-sister getting married by the lake / But I couldn't figure out who I'd wanna take / Bad enough that I showed up late / I had to leave before they even cut the cake" Holy fuck this verse is fucking sad."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "I used to hate this album when I was younger, but this song right here completely blew me away from the beginning. From the exquisite string intro to the chill-inducing drums. This song is emptiness at it's worse. It almost feels like a robot singing about his troubles and emotions. The way the instrumental builds only to collapse again is nothing but a thing of beauty. The melody, the depressing lyrics, the cold synths. I could keep going on and on. Kanye and Cudi are impeccable together and this song is the shining example of that. An absolute masterpiece"   
**whatyourheartdesires**: "Great intro to the whole story"  
**TonyRealm**: "“My friend showed me pictures of his kids / And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs” are some dope lines haha. The synth melody is neat and fits well with Kid Cudi’s hook, and the strings are a nice touch."  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Why am I crying."   
**butistillwork**: "This song cuts fucking deep, life must've felt really empty to him at the time. The very specific examples, especially the mentioned wedding, make that very clear. It makes me all the more happy for him that he has a family now. I adore the deep (cello?) strings here too."  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "Sombering, moody but still a bop. My 3 favourite things"  
**ffourthofjuly**: "one of my favorite kanye songs. the production is impeccable and the kid cudi feature is one of his best. it's definitely one of kanye's more soundscape-esque productions."  
**wearingsox**: "I am a sucker for strings, the beat rolls on so smoothly, Kid Cudi’s part is flawless. The pressure’s on and it’s only the beginning"

#**And These Two Comments I Grouped Together Because Yeah:**
**leafsnash61**: "Find me someone who doesn't like this song and I'll find you a liar."

#**The Essays:**
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This song literally saved my life. Middle and high school were rough. I played this song every time I wanted to run away, and every time I wanted to die. I still play this song every time I drive in the nighttime, because it's just transcendent. There's so much I could talk about with the lyrics and the beautiful strings, but I won't because I've done it so much time before. I just want to say I purchased this album on vinyl and had to contain myself from crying over my turntable. This is one of Kanye's greatest accomplishments, the most triumphant marriage between pop and hip hop he's ever done. It's perfect."  
**JunkyGS**: "One of the most under rated songs in Kanye’s discography. “The first two verses are about 'ye questioning himself and second-guessing his own feelings. To him, he feels like all these wonderful moments in his life came and went before he even had time to appreciate them. Dude is questioning whether it's normal to be this nostalgic, to think back on those moments, and whether he'll ever just live in the present and not think back on those moments that occurred over years or decades, but you only have a quick memory of them. Dude's emotional, and he wants to just escape. He has all these emotional problems, and he just wants to be somewhere else, but as he sees these lights pass him by, he thinks of all these moments that escaped him before he had the chance to appreciate them. His "destination" is a truly happy life, but there are all these memories haunting him reminding him. He paid his fare he struggled and underwent a lot of pain, that was his payment. But he still has to deal with the pain of his past before he can be truly happy to arrive at his destination. Child-like, he ends with "life's just not fair." This is self-explanatory, and you've all cried and felt this at one point.”"  
**eribertknows**: "No artist in history can repeat a theme like Kanye does with lights. Flashing Lights, Street Lights, All of the Lights, Ultralight Beam, Highlights, all masterpieces, all 10s (or 11s if you're doing a rate). This song is just so good at attempting to make sense of depression and failing, which I feel is a lot of what depression consists of. FUCK KANYE WHY YOU SO GOOD AT THINGS"  
**butistillwork**: "The lyrics are really repetitive, but that's kind of their point, the song is about how fleeting moments are, and somehow that really gets that feeling across. The imagery of street lights does a lot of the lifting in that respect as well. I also think that the "I know my destination but I'm just not there" might refer to what Welcome To Heartbreak is about, having a family, which just adds another layer of depth and cohesiveness to the album. The last line, "life's just not fair," sounds incredibly depressing."  
**TonyRealm**: "Commonly cited as an album highlight, this song takes the “street lights as life moments” metaphor and cruises with it. Everyone can relate to that feeling of life passing them by, perhaps being stuck in some kind of rut, with long-term aspirations seeming impossibly out of reach. The track is compositionally quite bare; a lumbering drum beat, some synths, and a bit of piano accompaniment, but with such a raw song like this it’s important that it isn’t cluttered, and I feel if they added anything more than those backing vocals during the second verse, the emotion and power may not have come through as clearly. While 808s is generally moody all the way through, this is perhaps the most poignant moment of the album."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "Absolute beauty of a song. This isn't something I can listen to anytime, reminds me too much of the past. Life is just a long street and the street lights are fleeting moments that just become memories, with their dull glow never failing to hit you sometimes when you least expect it. The choir and instrumental are exquisite. This is longing and yearning for the past in song form. Life's just not fair."  
**ExtraEater**: "for some reason every time this song plays a really weird animation plays in my head that's just a really above-average early internet drawn gif that's just kanye resting on the car seat headrest of a taxi driver and it's driving down a street with streetlights with a purple sky and it just loops over and over and it's really weird"

#**The Short Comments:**
**femaleghostbuster**: "lush, gorgeous. any Kanye song with the word "light" in it is gonna be good"  
**MrSwearword**: "invented Frank Ocean"  
**Do_This_Often**: "ok tears"  
**Armados**: "I can't remember the last Kanye track that made me cry"  
**leviOHsa**: "I enjoy how atmospheric this song feels, it belongs in a movie soundtrack."  
**thefighter987**: "best song of his career. Atmospheric, relaxing, well written, surprisingly well sung."  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This is fantastic production"  
**vapourlomo**: "Very cinematic and pretty"  
**superr_rad**: "THIS IS THE GOAT EXISTENTIAL CRISIS SONG I DONT WANNA HEAR ANY OTHER OPINIONS BC THEY ARE FALSE"  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "When this track gets going it goes the fuck OFF. Loved the buildup to the chorus"  
**ffourthofjuly**: "slightly overrated but over time i've been appreciating it more and more. i think it definitely hits harder if you're going through some change yourself."  
**4Roux**: "Depression anthem"  
**wearingsox**: "Meditative. Kanye feels eternally disappointed. He’ll never get “there”, he’s stuck in a cycle. Life isn’t fair Yeezy. I feel it."  
**strawberryswing1**: "I like the background chorus"  
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "The song that basically invented Drake, definitely the rawest and most emotional song on 808s to me, its really powerful as everything builds around you, and that last ‘life’s just not fair’ never doesn’t almost make me cry"

#**Can’t Feel Their Face, But They Love It:**
**femaleghostbuster**: "Max Martin, you genius. this is the kind of song Justin Timberlake should be making now"  
**MrSwearword**: "his GOAT song probably"  
**Armados**: "People hate on this song way too much"  
**eribertknows**: "King of winning awards for a kids show talking bout a face coming off a bag of blow. But actually though, how can people not realize this song isn't a cute love song but instead a cute cocaine song?" {Goddamn bitch I am not a teen choice…}  
**leviOHsa**: "This almost got my 11. Absolute bop, I overkilled it when it first came out but now I'm back with nothing but love for it."  
**TonyRealm**: "I remember hating this song when it first came out, and proceeding to actively avoid it, but listening to it for this rate…I may have made a mistake. I still don’t love the tune, but it’s way better than I remember. The bass line is superbly addictive, and Abel pulls off a timeless vocal performance. It is a style shift from his old stuff towards disco/funk-influenced pop, which I recall discouraged many fans (and probably contributed towards me disliking the song), but the Weeknd’s voice is more than good enough to transcend being trapped in a genre box, and the production is undeniably groovy."  
**imnoteventhatfunny**: "maybe the defining song of summer 2015 for me. yes it's obviously a big departure from the Trilogy sound but he does pop so well anyway so who cares?"  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Definitely one of the best and most interesting pop tracks of the past few years, Max Martin killed this track."  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "Easy 10 right here. I love hearing about Abels face coming off a bag of blow"  
**dirdbub**: "I love soccer moms dancing in their car to a song about cocaine!"  
**skargardin**: "It's no wonder that this song launched him into the mainstream, it bangs."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "The moment Weeknd completely crossed over and became a pop star. The moment I heard this I was like this man is about to really take shit over. Great bassline and instrumental, Max Martin is great for a reason."  
**ExtraEater**: "this deserved all the praise it got. also this reminds me of the game Little Alchemy because it was on loop the first time i played that game. ah, memories..."  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Before this song was released as a single, I never had an opinion on The Weeknd. When I heard this song on the radio on that fateful day, I thought "Wow, this dude is amazing. Maybe I should give his new album [BBTM] a listen!" I didn't for some reason but I did listen to his next album Starboy a year later, which is my second favorite album released in 2016 despite the criticisms it recieved. So in someway, listening and bopping to this song was my start of me low-key stanning The Weeknd and it's why this song is getting my 11 for this rate. This helps that this song is produced by the King of Bops himself, Max Martin. It's such an odd combo yet the songs they produce are gold."  
#**Every MJ Comment:**
**vapourlomo**: "comment referencing Michael Jackson"  
**superr_rad**: "I must admit one of the reasons I like the Weeknd so much is because he reminds me of Michael. If he were alive, he definitely would have released this! This is a bop, I never got tired of it."  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I knew this was gonna be a smash hit when it dropped, and frankly, I love it. It’s a totally new direction, and it’s very MJ, and it’s very good. The lyrics are strong af, and Max Martin actually does some nice work on here. This made the man a star, and rightfully so."  
**ignitethephoenix**: "Everything about this song is perfection. The fact that the song is about doing cocaine, but it's covered up by a catchy beat and rhythm is the Weeknd at his best (I just won a new award for a kids show Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow!) The MJ influences of this song are great too, and this song is why everyone thinks of MJ when they hear the Weeknd"  
 **ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I know this is basically where he sold out but I don’t care because at least this one is a huge fucking bop, Michael Jackson who?"  
**ffourthofjuly**: "michael jackson who? prince who? r&b who?"  
**leafsnash61**: "The Weeknd needs to do more MJ-influenced songs. They pay off."

#**RiRi Comments:**
**femaleghostbuster**: "possibly Rihanna's best (pre-Anti) vocal performance"  
**Armados**: "Rihanna overshadows Drake in this track"  
**leviOHsa**: "Absolute banger, Drake & Rihanna's collabs are always great. Good for singing along on long car journeys, or so I've heard."  
**whatsapilot**: "This song is just wonderful. Drake + Rihanna = instant banger, and this is by far their best collab."  
**ignitethephoenix**: "I forgot how much I love this song. Drake + Rihanna are an iconic duo, and it's is probably their best song together"  
**SkyBlade79**: "Rihanna sounds great. Lyrics are good during her part. The steel drums are cheesy. “It’s my birthday, I’ll get high if I want to” made it lose a point."  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "One of Drake and Rihanna's classic collaborations, this track contains an incredible hook performed by RiRi, is chock-full of fantastic and clever and heartfelt lines from Drake (such as "My only wish is I die real/'Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal" and "You hate the fact that you bought the dream when they sold you one"), and a wild breakdown by Jamie XX. It's just a fantastic track all around."  
**superr_rad**: "I mean, i can't not give this a 10, it would be a sin. Rihanna is perfect, drake is nice, that beat is infectious, "its my birthday ill get high if i want to""  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "Put Drake and RiRi in the same room and you're gonna get magic"  
**skiddos**: "Rihanna sounds amazing in this."

#**Not RiRi Comments:**
**eribertknows**: "Probably my favorite Drake verses ever. Both of them really. Rihanna kills it as always. Also if you're having a good day, just remember that this peaked at #7 in the Billboard 100, with All About That Bass, Can't Stop the Feeling and Harlem Shake hitting #1."  
**thefighter987**: "Beautiful, passionate delivery on both sides. The closest thing drake ever came to a perfect song. Would be my 11 if not for the weird chanting on the bridge"  
**TonyRealm**: "By far the most intriguing song production-wise. I mean, a Jamie xx remix of a Gil Scott-Heron track, what album are we listening to again? Even now, I still can’t quite get over how un-Drake-like this song sounds. That being said, even though it doesn’t mesmerize me like I want it to, I think the composition itself is spectacular."  
**vapourlomo**: "Jamie xx is a genius. It would've been so hard to mess this up."  
**chris_ou_poitrine**: "Jamie xx iz gr8"  
**butistillwork**: "Hooked from the first note. VERY GOOD TRACK WITH GREAT PRODUCTION. (Last bridge is kinda bad though)."  
**ffourthofjuly**: "this is one of my favorite pop songs of the past couple of years. every element comes together for a truly iconic and anthemic pop hit"  
**therokinrolla**: "As much as I don’t want this song to win( Love Lockdown you got this), this song is one of the best songs 2012. The drums fuck me up, the piano drags emotion from me, and Rihanna and Drake with always artfully compliment each other."  
**pickupthephonebaby**: "this song was one of the first i ever illegally downloaded when i learned how to in middle school. memories"  
**PossumAloysuis**: "I knew Jamie xx was a genius even before I knew who he was because of this song. Amazing minimalist beat and Gil-Scot Heron sample. Drake and Rihanna are great together"

#**Love:**
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Oh my god, I listened to this so much back in middle school (I think my last year of middle school, I'm not that young) it's insane. Absolutely insane. There's so much to love about this, and in some ways, I think it's better than Heartless. There's something tribal yet clubby about the instrumental, and yet it also sounds minimalistic and moody too? And then the craziness that happens near the end? One of the best moments on the album."  
**plsnosto**: "this was the only album I considerd giving an eleven"  
**eribertknows**: "I have a lot to say about this. 1) The drums in the hook invented all of the music that came after this. 2) This song is amazing. 3) This video is amazing. 4) Kanye West is the greatest artist of all times. 5) You can listen to this song when you're sad, when you're happy, when you're having the sexy time, when you just broke up with someone, when you don't feel like doing anything, when you feel like taking on the world; literally the ultimate song that exists and everyone should appreciate this masterpiece. 6) GOAT outro."  
**TonyRealm**: "I remember hearing this song when it first came out and thinking “wow this is weird”. The very sparse production and autotuned singing vocals shocked me and I imagine most fans. All these years later, I still think the production is a bit thin for my taste, but the song admittedly does a good job utilizing the little there is. And I love the SYSTEM OVERLOAD part."  
**whatsapilot**: "Strong contender for best song of the '00s"  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "The 808 intro is iconic, the distortion on "system overload" and the octaves doubling effect on the beginning of the third verse are so cool, the melody is catchy as heck, the pounding tribal percussion is perfect, and the dark sparse vibe is so goooood."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "This song grew on me extremely. From how it starts with the subdued drums to how everything it built till the explosion in the hook. Just groundbreaking. I'm literally running out of adjectives to describe just how incredible this album is. The screams in the background only add to the sense of dread. You lose"  
**ExtraEater**: "this accumulated like fourteen plays ever since i subscribed to google play music, so it was obviously worth its #3 chart position"  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I can see why this song was very divisive that time but this is too good tbh."  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "Simple and honestly I think Ye kinda overdid it with the auto tune here but I still love it"  
**wearingsox**: "I love the drums and the autotune works You’re down into the “jungle” of Kanye’s mind, feeling betrayed and in need of someone"  
**skargardin**: "Quite possibly my favorite Kanye song ever. I will never get tired of this!"  
**therokinrolla**: "this song turns me into a creamery"  
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Another one of Kanye’s best pop songs, I really love the melody of the verses leading into that amazing hook with those drums coming in YEEZUS TAKE ME"  
**pickupthephonebaby**: "a perfect sadboy pop song"  
**leafsnash61**: "This is how minimalism can be done correctly (read: not boring!)"  
**SkyBlade79**: "The bassline, the lyrics, the perfect usage of autotune… wow."  
**chris_ou_poitrine**: "tribal percussion is my jam"  
**ignitethephoenix**: "If you don't get down to the chorus when the drums come in, you have no soul and need to leave this planet."  
**Jelboo**: "Those drums are perfection!"  
**butistillwork**: "The first note/jingle always makes me kinda jump and think that my computer just had some sort of error. This probably my favorite song on the album to listen to, I love the drums on it."  
**superr_rad**: "SYSTEM OVERLOAD/1!!!! NONONONONONO!!!"

One of my favorite songs of all time, everything about it is perfect.

#**The Lovers:**
**eribertknows**: "Okay, so the beat dropping with the car catching fire is one of the best moments in music video history. The beat itself tbh is fucking iconic and just makes this song what it is. I'll always consider this (not Can't Feel My Face, not Often, not Earned It, and definitely not Love Me Harder) as THE song to make The Weeknd the household name he has become. I remember when this song came out (I loved it) and I had no idea about how big this fucker was gonna get. I'm gonna sound like one of those YouTube commenters but no lie I was probably one of the first people to watch the music video and now it has over 1 BILLION views. Fuck yes Abel please make another hit like this one."  
**femaleghostbuster**: "probably the weirdest hit song we've had in a while. brooding fuckboy anthem"  
**whatyourheartdesires**: "Out of this world"  
**Nfranklin50**: "This song is some great escapism. While I'm listening to this I'm not honor roll teenage boy driving through suburban neighborhood #592 no. I'm a drug dealer going to pick up my side chick so we can do a pound of crack/cocaine off my main chicks ass. What a time to be alive"  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is a top 5 Weeknd song. I cannot believe this shit hit #1 and stayed there for so long, and even cockblocked his father Drake. It just goes to show that this song would not be stopped. Absolute summer anthem, the screams, the bass, the lyrics… Modern classic."  
**Do_This_Often**: "only radio hit I've heard that is still amazing"  
**thefighter987**: "dark, brooding, honest. Very well executed."  
**TonyRealm**: "“I only love it when you touch me, not feel me” made me contemplate my life for a few seconds."  
**vapourlomo**: "Best sex jam ever named after a horror movie, hands down"  
**imnoteventhatfunny**: "almost got my 11. one of the best singles Abel has ever released, and it's fucking WILD seeing him perform it live."  
**whatsapilot**: "Best song on the album, I still can't believe this was a massive hit"  
**ignitethephoenix**: "Easily one of the Weeknd's best songs. When the beat/bass drops in the chorus, shit gets real. The tension and build up in the verses is great as well."  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "This is the Abel I like. The bass in the chorus is monstrous."  
**superr_rad**: "The drop is just so fuckin g good"  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "Fucking perfection right here"  
**ffourthofjuly**: "another example of the weeknd engineering a perfect pop song. honestly, this is one of my favorite songs of all time. it's amazing, catchy, and has a drop for the AGES"  
**dirdbub**: "easiest fucking 11 of my life lmao. this song will never, ever, EVER get old for me and you can @ me about that" { /u/dirdbub }  
**strawberryswing1**: "This was one of my contenders for 11. Of this whole album I think this song best captures the mood vibe he had with his first album."  
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Such an epic scummy song, it’s insane that it went #1, so quotable and with an ENORMOUS hook, I fucking love that scream"  
**pickupthephonebaby**: "tfw this song is about Ariana"  
**leafsnash61**: "One of the coolest songs to ever go #1."  
**SkyBlade79**: "A modern day epic. Everything about this is so big in scale, and though it’s certainly not a radio song, it’s definitely an album highlight. I would probably give it a 10 without that bridge tho"  
**PossumAloysuis**: "I loved this when I first heard it, gave me some Kiss Land vibes. Didn't expect this to completely blow and take over shit like it did cause of the dark sound but hey it was a pleasant surprise. Great single"  
**ExtraEater**: "[throwback] the weeknd - the hills ((it's a reference to an early post on the subreddit))"  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "It's impressive for such a song that has a very agressive production, this was #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The GP has some taste for once."

#**The Haters:**
**MrSwearword**: "alright shut up about fuckin’ bitches and get to the well-done chorus."  
**plsnosto**: "IM SORRYIM SORRY IMSORRY"  
**leviOHsa**: "That chorus is just too much."  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Man, I forgot how awful this song is. That drowning bass, the tired lyrics, and his excruciating vocals. I don't understand why y'all keep sucking this dude's dick tbh. Y'all let this shit hit number-one instead of Hotline Bling. Sad."

#**Fuck It, Have All The Comments:**
**femaleghostbuster**: "influential, authentic, iconic.... your faves could never."  
**whatyourheartdesires**: "I was obsessed with this song when it came out"  
**MrSwearword**: "ONE OF THE GOAT SONGS EVER MADE."   
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Honestly, this was one of the songs that put me onto Kanye. I was never really a rap fan back then, and the only songs I really liked from the genre were Gold Digger and Stronger. Kanye took over the radio with this song, and it was like nothing I have ever heard. Was it pop? Rap? R&B? No damn clue. It's legit one of the best choruses he has ever done, and that piano is just the most perfect 2008 thing ever. And there's a lot of little details, especially near the end of the song that really keep it fresh. It's a masterclass in pop production, and influenced a ton of today's rappers, and that's undeniable."  
**plsnosto**: "almost gave this my eleven"  
**Armados**: "This song never fails to pump me up, especially with that hook"   
**eribertknows**: "Tbh I'm fighting whoever gives this a low score and then taking them to a doctor to get their ears checked and potentially replaced. Invented your fave's best song."  
**leviOHsa**: "One of my favourite Kanye songs. I remember this is what turned me from a casual fan, and I started to appreciate Kanye's approach to music to a point where I'm just a delusional stan now."  
**thefighter987**: "well written and personal especially for a radio song. Deservedly one of his biggest hits."
**TonyRealm**: "This song was huge, and deservedly so. I love the “heys” in the second verse, and the whole song is just damn catchy."  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "His best song. Don't @ me."  
**vapourlomo**: "I adore Kanye, but out of all his hits, I think this one's aged the worst. It's still solid! Just overplayed and not as good as the rest of the album."  
**ignitethephoenix**: "iconic song"  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "In addition to being incredibly catchy and having an iconic hook, this song's autotune and lyrics really paint this image of someone who's distant and cold and sees how everything is gonna play out before it ever happens. I don't know if there's ever been a song that more effectively paints a toxic and failing relationship between two people who are nothing but bad for each other and conveys the coldness in that relationship."  
**butistillwork**: "Fairly upbeat and somehow still kinda depressing, like he's blaming himself. On the other hand he's also pissed at his ex, and it's interesting to see how he got that across without using any slurs."  
**superr_rad**: "THIS SONG IS A CLASSIC, IT WILL BE STORED IN A TIME CAPSULE WHEN THE HUMAN RACE DIES OUT FOR THE ALIENS TO ENJOY, LITERALLY CLASSIC"  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "Can we just crown Kanye as one of the best producers ever because it was top notch here."  
**dirdbub**: "the definitive song of this album. this will never age"  
**wearingsox**: "Kanye is rapping again, phew. But it’s unlike anything else anybody has done, there’s a slower, very accessible pace to it. Everything is doom and gloom. Exactly how it is when you’re depressed"  
**skargardin**: "Kanye at his most vulnerable. I love it!"  
**therokinrolla**: "Overplay definitely killed it a itty bit. Not a bad song by any means, but I’m kinda bored of it at this point"  
**letsallpoo**: "-insert joke about christine and the queens-"  
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "One of Kanye’s greatest pop songs and one of his best hooks ever, the beat is so instantly memorable too, 2008 wasn’t even that great a year for me but like this makes me wanna go back to that time, I love it"  
**pickupthephonebaby**: "how could you be so dr. evil”  
**leafsnash61**: "A very, very well-crafted pop song."  
**SkyBlade79**: "Truly Iconic."

snidelaughter: it's probably the worst song on 808's

808's is one of my favorite albums of all time and I'm glad it technically won, but this is some asshole genie shit 

ngl if I did the rate I probably would've given this and Amazing a 7 and every other song at least a 9, if not 10 or 11

cloudbustingmp3: i thought she MIGHT get dethroned with the 80s rate, but tbh now  think she might just stay up there until we do another rate with a universally loved song like CGYOOMH

amumumyspiritanimal: Imo if we did a second rate with RAWM in it and people wouldn't give it worse scores just to sabotage it, it could beat CGYOOMH, but in the last rate, she didn't peaked with her popularity here, and there were less participants.
