=====

dropthehammer11: I just fuckin love the production on it, Jamie xx did a superb job. Rihanna's feature is lit and Drake's vocal melodies are on point.

It was between that or Crew Love, Take Care edged it out tho

I forgot what my highest on 808s was. I *think* I picked Heartless but if I re-did it now I'd put Love Lockdown higher
[/r/popheads/comments/66ro1i/rate_reveal_the_moody_rb_rate_reveal_day_1_look/dgksfc2/]

=====

PossumAloysuis: Jamie is the highlight of the song agreed there. The whole song is very well-crafted and pleasing. I don't remember what my highest from Take Care was, either Lord Knows or Cameras if I remember correctly

Look_A_Fangirl: # #44: Dark Times
---
**Average:** 6.123 **// Total Points:** 355.2 **// Controversy:** 2.332 **// [Listen here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NKUpo_xKyQ)**

---
**Highest scores:** (10 x1) eribertknows (9.5 x1) TragicKingdom1 (9 x1) Reifiui (8.9 x1) Armados (8.8 x1) FishM8 (8.8 x1) ffourthofjuly (8.1 x1) ignitethephoenix 

**Lowest Scores:** (0 x2) plsnosto, leviOHsa (1 x1) chris_ou_poitrine (2 x4) whatsapilot, awhile2, leafsnash61, matthewsalinsky2 
___
Ed Sheeran + The Weeknd, that can only mean one thing, Dark Times. And as the title suggests, this song talks about the dark times. But it was also a dark times for our users who found it pretty bland and weak making it our first song out tonight.
___ 
#**The Weakness:**
**MrSwearword**: "kind of forgettable."  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I don’t mind Ed on this. The beat is kinda good, but as a whole, this track does nothing for me. I like the guitar though."  
**leviOHsa**: "TBH I don't think he needed any collabs on this album, but this just makes no sense to me, and the song is weak too."  
**Do_This_Often**: "that high note on three.fifteen gets this the extra .six"  
**Armados**: "Abel and Ed have some good chemistry in this track"  
**Nfranklin50**: "Who knew acoustic Drake and R&B Drake would be so good together? Hallelujah!"  
**whatsapilot**: "I promise you I'm not in the Ed Sheeran hatejerk but this song is just boring"  
**leafsnash61**: "Filler."

#**The Collaboration:**
**eribertknows**: "Two of the Top 5 male voices in the industry combine for a song that surprisingly doesn't feel too out of element for either of them. The theme here is pretty familiar: they're fucked up and women shouldn't really be looking for love in either of them. Their voices work together so well though, the instrumental is very nice, and all I can say is that I'd love to see them work together again."  
**TonyRealm**: "A strange collab on paper that surprisingly works as they basically pass the mic back and forth. Ed gives one of the strongest vocal performances I’ve heard from him and ends up outshining Abel, but it also feels more like an Ed-style song anyway."  
**ignitethephoenix**: "idc if y'all hate Ed Sheeran, this is a good song and when else are you going to get a duet between 2 of the biggest male singers out there?"  
**vapourlomo**: "This was not a good collaboration idea."  
**chris_ou_poitrine**: "Ed sheeran? why?"  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "TIL R&B pop + Folk pop = Blues pop? I dig the vibe but it's not a standout on the album or anything."  
**ffourthofjuly**: "the double male duet is stunningly underrated, and this song is very good with both ed and abel singing. it definitely catches an atmosphere, especially with the minimalist production"  
#**And The Memers:**
**ExtraEater**: ""this song features ed shoshoen" popheads: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "HEY GIRL HEY GIRL WE CAN MAKE IT EASY IF WE LIFT EACH OTHER"

[/r/popheads/comments/66ro1i/rate_reveal_the_moody_rb_rate_reveal_day_1_look/dgksqyl/]

=====

TheKneesOfOurBees: this song can be described by a combination of two other ed songs.

Don't Sing.
[/r/popheads/comments/66ro1i/rate_reveal_the_moody_rb_rate_reveal_day_1_look/dgkst3g/]

=====

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: I thought the Ed Sheeran hate has affected the results but look at the average.

>Average: 6.123

This is a pretty good average for a song that came out first despite the circlejerk.

ignitethephoenix: Same, but the general hate towards him on here definitely brought it down. I rated it higher too as well because of Ed.

Remember when Drake made an overly long interlude and popped it in the middle of an already long album? Yeah, I do. A double song with two parts one named *Cameras*, other one named *Good Ones Go*. While some enjoyed it, I’ll let /u/dirdbub do the talking for the others, “oh, it's an interlude, it should be short!" \*sees it's 7 minutes long\* "welp better strap in for this shit"".
___
#**The Lovers:**
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Kinda a long song, but it's great. It's one that falls by the wayside when I think about Take Care, but upon revisiting, I like it a lot."  
**maadbutterfly**: "Both halves are perfect."  
**eribertknows**: "The guy who sings the sample on Cameras sounds exactly like dvsn which is pretty interesting. Good Ones Go makes the song a lot better though imo, I love Drake's singing and Abel's vocals."  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Cameras has that peak 40 beat, and Drake just has flow for days. And then that Good Ones Go hook with Drake and The Weeknd is like butter, it's so good."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "Probably the most underrated song on TC and a strong favorite of mine. The Jon B sample is well placed and wonderful. The interlude is more simp Drake but also flames. When Weeknd comes in with those background harmonies, straight euphoria"  
#**The Haters:**
**MrSwearword**: "cute beat but this is terrible"  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "this really should've been split into two songs"  
**vapourlomo**: "I'd give Cameras an 8, and Good Ones Go a 6, so a 7 seems fair"  
**whatsapilot**: "It's 0 for Cameras, 7.5 for Good Ones Go"   
**therokinrolla**: "Camera reminds me of Views. Lifeless, bland, borning, repetitive. The way he says Camera annoys me. Goods Ones Go is okay. I don’t understand why the hell he made a medley out of a 4 minutes song and a 3 minute song but whatever. This gets my 0. next"  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Boring."

___
A song in which Drake pays homage to a classic Cash Money song and it can be seen as him talking about either a lover or a stripper, just the usual for Drake. Practice makes perfect, but was this song that perfect for the users? 
___
#**Nah:**
**MrSwearword**: "you made Juvenile suck. Go to hell, Aubrey."  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Kinda a boring track on the album. It doesn't quite go anywhere, and the lyrics aren't very strong to boot. Really forgettable."  
**leviOHsa**: "Dull. Boring. Meh."  
**TonyRealm**: "There are certain situations where you want to hear this song. Procrastinating from work by doing a /r/popheads rate is not one of them."  
**vapourlomo**: "Why is this here? Come on Drizzy, it's almost at the 80 minute mark time to wrap it up"  
**butistillwork**: "Embarrassing song 2.0"  
**therokinrolla**: "idk why but hearing drake repeatedly say “back that ass up” kinda makes me uncomfortable; okay otherwise"  
**SkyBlade79**: "Wow, I despise this song. From the part where he says to call him daddy, to his lazy tone, to his condescending voice. “can’t money shit”, lazy beat, and just… ew. He makes the “cash yeah” trope sound even worse than Iggy… he should have scrapped this."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "There was absolutely no need to turn Back That Azz Up into a stripper ballad. None. Zero"  

#**Yeah:**
**eribertknows**: "Another iconic hook, thanks to the one and only Abel. I don't really care much about the rest of the song. But that hook tho."  
**Nfranklin50**: "This is a song that got played a lot at parties because my area code is so close to 504 that it became a thing to sing our area code"  
**thefighter987**: "lowkey banger"  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Once again I'm an HTown boy so that southern shit always gets me going; that Juvenile hook interpolation is pure magic. And the rest of the track is great too (especially the production which is some real A+ shit)."  
**leafsnash61**: "Back that ass upppppppp."  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "As a sub, this song low-key turns me on."

The first single out and WOW. This cut from Abel comes off the 50 Shades of Grey soundtrack and was Oscar nominated. But that wasn’t enough to save this in the rate. I guess you could say that when it comes to spots in the bottom, this song **Earned It**
___
#**Deserved It:**
**MrSwearword**: "#SaveOurEggplants #SaveOurCucumbers"  
**femaleghostbuster**: "it's pretty, but I'm baffled this was the Oscar-nominated song from the surprisingly good Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack. Ellie Goulding should've gotten the nod"  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "While I was writing this, I fell asle"  
**vapourlomo**: "Boring. Unsexy. Like a certain movie"  
**superr_rad**: "i never liked this song, it bothers me. maybe its the connection to fifty shades? either way, shouldve been a bonus track"

#**Cared For It:**
**Do_This_Often**: "can babel do just a couple more orchestral slow jams"  
**Armados**: "Surprisingly enough, this was a grower for me"  
**eribertknows**: "THIS SONG INVENTED SEX, but I don't think he really needed to put it in the album. Side note: as shallow as the lyrics might seem, "you're my favorite kind of night" is an amazing line imo."  
**thefighter987**: "the best thing to come out of the 50 shades franchise"  
**TonyRealm**: "An orchestral slow jam, piano notes sprinkled throughout, Abel’s smooth vocals wooing the girl, I can see why this was made for 50 Shades."  
**imnoteventhatfunny**: "i feel like this song gets more hate than it deserves with it being Abel's first foray into straight up pop music, but it's just so damn smooth."  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "I really like this song because it has one of the best melodies on the album and it's really effective at its slow burn classic soul/R&B style."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "I didn't really like this when it came out but it grew on me heavily. The melody is great. Need more Weeknd over orchestral arrangements. The buildup at the end is exquisite."  
**gannade**: "robbed of the oscar, if only i had another 11"

Look another song about strippers and Drake, why am I even writing these descriptions anymore. 
___
#**Yay:**
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Stellar lineup here, and it's a track that picks up the album after two tracks that are a little worse than the others (not that they're bad or anything). Andre 3000 alone brings this up a point."  
**eribertknows**: ""You musta done this before, this can't be your first time" is a line that will never die. Also you can always count on 3k to deliver a game-changing verse and elevate your song from good to great."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Man I love this song. Great hook by Drake and really solid verses by Wayne and Andre 3000."  

#**Nay:**
**MrSwearword**: "filler"  
**Do_This_Often**: "Wayne why are you here"  
**leviOHsa**: "Pretty boring song, should have been cut with a few others."  
**butistillwork**: "Oh God this song is embarrassing."  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "I feel like this is the part of any Drake album where you think, "Why tf did he not just leave the track off the album?"" {TBH, I’m like that with the whole album, but same}  
**therokinrolla**: "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"

**PossumAloysuis**: "Wonderful song, tailor made for those 2-3am strip club nights. Love the Houstatlantavegas reference in the hook. Wayne's verse wasn't needed and brings the song down a bit but 3 Stacks comes in and saves this shit. Best verse on the album"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "I'm a sucker for the "dark 80s" vibe, and there's just lots of beautiful melodies and moments in here, like the big Phil Collins snare drum in the chorus and like that gorgeous outro."  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "Yas Abel serenade me all night"  
**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Super underrated song."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "A second half standout for me. Love the instrumental and melody. Well crafted from beginning to end."

#**Taking Their Time On Their Ride:**
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Good closer. Instrumental is very good. Drake's verses are very very good. The Weeknd is super good."  
**Do_This_Often**: "ooh lord this harmonizing"  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A Great album closer"  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "Abel sounds amazing as always, and Drake spits some fantastic bars and drops some real wisdom. The amount of perspective he shows is awesome."  
**skargardin**: "Really good album closer, the Weeknd’s falsettos are haunting but fits the production all the same."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "Amazing conclusion. Instrumental is great, love how Weeknd's vocals are embedded into it. Almost euphoric. Drake succinctly sums up all of the themes and strands of the album and goes out on top. Wonderful finale"  

#**Wanting To Get The Fuck Off:**
**leafsnash61**: "No comment."  
**MrSwearword**: "filler to close. Fucking bye."  
**eribertknows**: "First of all, I'm pretty angry The Motto isn't here. I feel like that song would have had a record-breaking controversy score. As for this song, Drake goes off in the verses, which is nice to see. I must say though, it's my least favorite collab between Abel and Aubrey, probably because the repetition gets old after a couple minutes."  
**TonyRealm**: "I actually really dislike this. The lyrics are decent, but that’s it; the beat is extraordinarily dull and repetitive, and I don’t like the Weeknd at all on here - that hook becomes annoying fast."  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "Practice or HYFR would've been a more solid exit track. This is just repetitive and dull"

#**Drake Is Doing It Wrong:**
**MrSwearword**: "he’s self-aware for once."  
**therokinrolla**: "The wrong song to put after the travesty that is Cameras. Definitely didn’t get my ass to the shakin it was doing pre-cameras. This put me to sleep. Sorry, bye, thanks for playing"  
**Jelboo**: "Can this album end now?"  
**SkyBlade79**: "literally dying of boredom"  
**gannade**: "asleep"

#**Drake Is Doing It Right:**
**4Roux**: "Sixteen year old me used to listen to this song a lot when she snuck out at night and wandered around the village alone. It’s a good song for when you feel like you’re the only one in the world who’s still awake. It also has my favorite Drake lyrics ("Cry if you need to/But I can’t stay to watch you/That’s the wrong thing to do")"  
**TonyRealm**: "Do you like soft, slow ballads? Well this one’s for you, topped off with a few surprisingly meaningful lines and a harmonica solo (which is a bit cheesy but ehh why the fuck not)."  
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "these tears are real"  
**thefighter987**: "Well sung and sincere."  
**eribertknows**: "I'd always take singing Drake over rapping Drake and this is a perfect reason why. This shit hella smooth and that harmonica is iconic."  
**leviOHsa**: "This song is just kind of.. wet.”  
**vapourlomo**: "I usually hate R&B ballads but this is so sad and pretty and I can't deny the magic of a Stevie harmonica solo"  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "This song is so heartfelt and real, and then the Stevie Wonder harmonica solo just takes it to the next level"  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Slow but Drake's emotion is very raw in this one"

Try to take your mind back to the frosty fall of 2011. The leaves have fallen, it's getting chilly, Obama is still president, Adele rules the charts. Drake is still an up-and-comer with something to prove. Take Care is released, and it warms the heart of every sadsack: even superstars get sad sometimes.

Now, Drake is bloated and boring. Knock Views/More Life down a peg if you must. But Take Care doesn't deserve this.

**Lowest Scores:** (2 x1) macronichees (2.6 x1) Do_This_Often (3 x1) awhile2

A track were Kanye pours his heart out to the audience but they just keep screaming and not listening. As summed up by /u/ffourthofjuly "much like say you will, the closer takes all the atmospheric things of the album and brings them together. i can't listen to this song without getting emotional, and the whole irony of it all puts it into perspective. kanye's singing about how much he hates people treating him differently because he's famous, and the whole crowd isn't listening, but just screaming at him. it's insanely ironic and definitely calls to attention the comments on fame."

---
#**The Short Comments:** 
**Armados**: "I like it, but come on... instead of a studio version, it's a live version with freaking babies crying"  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Did Kanye download a fan-recorded video of his concert and put it on his album? Wow, when will your fave?"  
**Nfranklin50**: "This sounds like someone in the crowd recorded this"  
**leviOHsa**: "I don't know why this is part of the album, it doesn't really make much sense to me."  
**vapourlomo**: "I'm sorry, I always skip this one. The audio quality is so, so bad"  
**ExtraEater**: "eyy a freestyle"  
**TragicKingdom1**: "Really don't like live versions of songs on otherwise studio albums."  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "When Kanye does a freestyle it tends to be hit or miss. This wasn't a hit. This was a goddamn headshot."  
**dirdbub**: "holy fuck he just goes in"  
**skargardin**: "Really good and it still gives me chills."  
**letsallpoo**: ""it's funny...pinocchio...LIED" kanye sis"  

#**The Long Comments:**
**eribertknows**: "I thought this was going to be the song to lower my album average and make it more acceptable, but fuck me this is so much better than I remember? You can fucking feel what he's feeling, and it's just so genuine and so painful and so beautiful and I'm not crying you're crying please send help. I'm so glad he fucking exists smh. Like please, even if you don't like Kanye, you still gotta thank him for your fave's existence. Frank, Drake, Abel, Lorde, Chance, Coldplay, Danny Brown, Gaga, Rihanna, idk fucking Glass Animals wouldn't be the same without Kanye and I just appreciate him more than he knows."  
**TonyRealm**: "Apparently Bey is the reason this is on the album? Idk if that’s true or alt-true but thanks queen for the unending chills I get when listening to this. What’s special about this track is not just that it’s live, but that the sounds from the crowd are as much a part of the song as the keyboards or even Kanye himself; the audience acts as another instrument, or even a second vocalist. The cheers and screams reinforce Kanye’s disconnect with “real life” and the struggles of fame in an incredibly organic way, and is a haunting way to close out the album."  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "This is so beautiful and heartfelt, it almost doesn't feel like a song, it's just a man spilling his emotions on stage. And I love that it's a live recording, it really adds a lot to the song to hear how alone he sounds even with all these people around him."  
**butistillwork**: "This really reminds me of his Hey Mama performance at the 2008 Grammys. It's insane that he managed to throw this out as a freestyle. I've seen people complain about the crowd screams, but for me they're a huge part of what makes this song so great, because it really contrasts amazingly with his message about the struggles of fame and not being seen as a real person. And they're not just added in post, they're actually there. This was and still is his life, unfiltered. What fucks me up the most about this song though is this line: "And there is no Gepetto to guide me. No one right beside me. The only one was behind me, I can't find her no more, I can't follow no more, I can't..." You can literally hear the pain. I mean, you can hear it through the entire song, or hell, the entire album, but it's so so clear here. He sounds like he's on the verge of tears. Fuck, man... You know, most of the time when I listen to music it's in the background, but I can't bring myself to not actively listen to this song.   
As a matter of fact, I first listened to 808s when I was going for a walk, and I'd slowly been getting lost in my own thoughts and not really paying full attention to the album anymore, but when this came on I listened again. I really, actually listened. This song was also my gateway into really looking into Kanye, not just the artist and celebrity, but the person. It made me dig deeper in his biography and discography, and what I've found has just made his entire body of work so much more amazing to me, and despite his certainly numerous flaws, even though I've never met him, I've come to truly and deeply respect this person. And while I don't expect everyone will feel as strongly, I do hope that it can do something similar for some other raters here who may not know him all that well yet beyond his more popular songs and public scandals.   
At first I was going to give my 11 to Welcome To Heartbreak, simply because (unsurprisingly) it has better production and is more re-listenable, but as I caught myself writing so much about this song specifically instead of any other, I don't think I'd be being honest with myself not giving it to this one. So here's my precious 11."  
**superr_rad**: "I JUST WISH THE SOUND QUALITY WAS BETTER!!!! but this is one of kanye's saddest and most self-aware song, everyone should listen to the lyrics. i dont see how people can think kanye is a total asshole if they listen to this, hes a real person. In conclusion, kanye is the greatest of all time, i rated this album perfectly and i regret NOTHIGBN"  
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This goes on a bit too long but I love how much it fits the themes of the album, Kanye is just going off about his insecurities and issues and everyone is just yelling ‘I love you Kanye!’ and cheering, it’s such a powerful moment on an album full of them"

**TheAllRightGatsby**: "The best part of this song is the post-chorus when the actual drums kick in, and the ending with the horns. The rest of the song is a'ight."  
**ignitethephoenix**: "Love the jazzy influences in the song"  
**Armados**: "Even within /r/TheWeeknd, this is viewed as a bad track. Guilty pleasure, I guess."  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "This song was an insta fave the first time I ever listened to BBTM and it's still a fave"  
**TonyRealm**: "Whew there’s a lot going on here. A piano-based riff into a snazzy beat drop, a nice feature from Labrinth of all people, and the almost choir-like bridge, not to mention throwing in some horns for good measure. Probably the most sonically complex track on the album, it does a good job not getting too messy."  
**therokinrolla**: "a better drop than anything the chainsmoker’s have ever done lbr"  
**SkyBlade79**: "Wow… I love this. The lyrics aren’t amazing but the delivery by both of these men are so great. The beat is also so great and theatric."  

#**Losers:**
**eribertknows**: ""Only losers go to school" is a pretty alienating line and it doesn't even feel like they're saying it in some kind of ironic way. Maybe they are, but from context it doesn't sound like it. I like the song but I have a hard time getting over how unrelatable it is. The outro sounds very nice."  
**MrSwearword**: "“only losers go to school” …boy bye with your bullshit."  
**awhile2**: "my prayers go out to all of our british popheads who have to live in a nation where labyrinth is an incredibly successful musician"  
**imnoteventhatfunny**: "easily the worst song Abel has released. just none of the instrumentation works together, a total mess of a song and was Labrinth really the best Abel could get?"

Like sure I can say it doesn’t captivate me, but it isn’t meant for me, it’s for the important people in Drake’s life. He did put it on his album so obviously he wants people to hear it, but in a weird way I feel kind of privileged to glimpse some of these personal memories."  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "This is such a beautiful track, and really taps into one of the things I love about Drake, which is his sense of community and his willingness to wear his heart on his sleeve and talk about how much he loves the people around him. This is like Drake's "Family Business" which is a huge compliment."  
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is a really beautiful song. Just, everything about it. It's so fucking real, and it makes me really sad and happy, and that instrumental is a work of art. Just listen to those lyrics, dudes. Damn. And that beat switch wasn't needed by any means but elevates the song to an even higher level."  
**PossumAloysuis**: "Another excellent song. Great tribute to his mom and uncle. Very poignant and personal. Well written from the hook to the verses. Love the voicemail from his grandmother at the end, nice touch."  
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Awww Drake is so sweet for making this song."  

#**The Starboy Comments:**
**eribertknows**: "Ah, ah, ah, I'm a motherfucking Starboy (sorry I had to). But actually this song is very very touching, and if you look into the lyrics you'll notice how deeply personal it is. Perfect example of Drake showing off while not being afraid of being vulnerable and not having to be fake. Love it."  
**superr_rad**: "IMA MUHHFUCKIN STARBOY"

[/r/popheads/comments/66ro1i/rate_reveal_the_moody_rb_rate_reveal_day_1_look/dgl12rp/]

=====

PossumAloysuis: It's filler to me because it's pretty generic and derivative. Also I'm pretty sure Take Care and The Motto were more successful than it.

I still enjoy it but it's one of the more lacking points on the album 
[/r/popheads/comments/66ro1i/rate_reveal_the_moody_rb_rate_reveal_day_1_look/dgl17cs/]

=====

deleted: Take Care was more successful than it which is why I said second. 

I can see where you're coming from, it's a pop leaning song on an otherwise moody album.

=====

PossumAloysuis: I thought you were talking about Headlines tbh. I'm pretty sure all 3 of those were more successful but I could be wrong. 

Songs can be good and filler at the same time I think, this is one of those

**Lowest Scores:** (1 x1) JoshuaReddit

#**Angels:**
**Armados**: "Lol, this is soooo corny. Still enjoyable"  
**eribertknows**: "The lyrics are lacking a bit in this one, but there's so much emotion that I can't help but love it. Some of the best singing in the album, and I love the constant voice going on in the background. Such a great outro."  
**thefighter987**: "a bit long, still solid."  
**TonyRealm**: "I could break this down and talk about how the power ballad structure works really well here, or how I wonder if a short instrumental interlude would spice things up, or that I’d prefer if Maty (the female vocalist) sung more lines with Abel and left her individual “I hope you find somebody” line until the very end. But I think this is one of those tracks that invites you to just kick back and let the music and emotions wash over you. I’m guilty of trying to analyze everything and constantly point out flaws, so this song is a reminder to me that’s okay to just relax and take it in; the song may not be perfect, but it’s powerful, and isn’t that more important?"  
**skiddos**: "This song is grand. What a great way to close the album."  
**ffourthofjuly**: "BRINGING 80'S POWER BALLAD JOURNEY ESQUE REALNESS"  
**superr_rad**: "interesting how this song sounds so sonically different than the rest on the album"  
**Itsafudgingstick**: "Of the 3 albums here Angel is BY FAR the best closing track. That call and response portion? Magic"  
**leafsnash61**: "A wonderful, almost anthemic closing track. It's a shame the 3 songs preceding this one completely derail the momentum of the album had."  

#**Devils:**
**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I’m ready to turn it off at this point, honestly. This song is cool but it’s not needed, and again, it’s too long. I like the Maty Noyes feature, but that’s about it."  
**imnoteventhatfunny**: "a third boring track in a row rounds out a very underwhelming trio of songs to close the album with. this just coasts by and leaves me with total indifference until the transcendent burst of guest vocals from Maty Noyes in the bridge, which gives the song enough energy to finish with a solid final chorus. it's still not great but it is the best of these last three tracks, though nothing about it feels like a Weeknd song to me."  
**TheAllRightGatsby**: "This had the potential to be good but it just drags and feels melodramatic. Maty Noyes's little additions and the outro are solid though."  
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Not sure why Abel needed to make an 80s power ballad but I guess it works, the song's about 2 minutes too long though"
