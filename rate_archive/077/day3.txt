2012 Ultimate Rate Reveal, Day 3: Diamonds in the Rough
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/dkn5vj/2012_ultimate_rate_reveal_day_3_diamonds_in_the/

Good afternoon/evening/whenever, and welcome to the final day of the 2012 Ultimate Rate Reveal! Today we'll be counting down from **#14 to #1**, and thus crowning the winner! Kesha had the best showing on day 1 and didn't lose a song until #37, Nicki has the most songs left in the game with a whopping half of the remaining songs being hers, while Rihanna suffered during the last two days but has the benefit of having a couple good and slightly less dated sounding singles to her name still in the rate. Follow along in the thread or join the live reveal in the [popheads plug.dj room](https://plug.dj/popheads), where I'll be showing off my terrible video editing skills in some homemade shitposts! We'll start at 3PM EST, or about an hour after this post goes up. Before we begin, some stats: 

* **62** of you participated!
* The average score across all songs was **7.034**
* The average controversy score was **2.043**, and anything above that should be considered controversial

The production on this is absolutely insane in my opinion, and the breakdown near the end is one of the highest points of Warrior for me. Its sound definitely isn't for everyone, especially those less interested in the dated EDM side of things, but even ignoring that the song has wonderfully catchy melodies and subject matter involving Kesha fucking a ghost. What's not to love? This was in the top 10 for a decent amount of time, and I'd certainly have it there myself, but I'm happy to see it make day 3 in the first place.

---

**jordannimz** (11): ok, this was my favourite song of all time for quite a while. This was one of the only songs I ever bought on iTunes back when I was on a 13-year-old iTunes gift card budget. Just the whole song, verses, chorus, breakdown… I am still completely obsessed with this song. And the last chorus (both the stripped-down one and the one with the crazy bass) is absolute perfection.

**EuroBish** (10): bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the production on this album is surprisingly incredible???

**JunkyGS** (10): banger

**lady\_sable** (10): miss ke$hier your MIND!!!

**lilguavachan** (10): kesha literally astral projected into my room, ripped the soul out of my body, took my soul to a higher plane of existence, and then stuffed my face with with this song while saying, "eat this good food you dumb fat f*g,". and you know what? i'd let her do it again, she's earned the right.

**skargardin** (10): Oh, here's the real tea, this is early 2010s EDM personified in one song, basically every thing I love about this era of music.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): honestly one of the best EDM pop songs from this era imo, there is an excess of hooks here

**1998tweety** (9.5): Slip my hand from your hand, leave you dancing with a ghost

**radiofan15** (9.2): So... she fucked a ghost?

**lilacsweetener** (9): Could've been an amazing single. This rate is making me miss gigantic choruses.

**waluigiest** (9): this is fucking strange. And it’s tasty. Idk if it works but I’m so starved for kesha to lean into abrasive production and interesting writing

**nooodisaster** (8.5): kesha LITERALLY fucked a ghost y'all.

**gateway2glimmer** (8): This track sounds like a leftover from Warrior + Cannibal, and I mean that in the best way.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): another weird drop

**ditacarlita** (7): another song with a great bridge and chorus absolutely ruined by the overly club bangeresque harshness of the versus

**fxsparrow** (7): The production on this one is a choice but overall a good track

**LiberalMusicLover** (7): I would've given this song a higher score because the chorus and production is amazing, but the verses are honestly trash.

**vhqv1997** (7): Isn't that the same drop in Where Have You Been by Rihanna?

**rickikardashian** (6.8): according to Genius, this is about fucking a ghost…… I might just fuck around and give this my 11 because of that

**selegend** (6): gosh that chorus is AMAZING but everything else about this song sucks ass ugh!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): The writing is decent but the production on this one is a real stinker. The Deconstructed Mix sounds way better.

Another iconic... bop? from Nicki. This was THE go-to song for people to talk about why mainstream pop is The Absolute Worst and how nobody cares about good lyricism anymore. Those people don't deserve rights as we all know but among popheads, Stupid Hoe is a controversial beast, having quite a high controversy score. It still managed to nab a fairly good position, making it to the third day. I've grown to appreciate the song for the iconic mess that it is and I'm happy with how it fared overall in this rate.

---

**1998tweety** (11): I'm glad that I can say that I was always an intellectual who stanned this song from the start. The chorus can be seen as meh but wow those verses snap.

**anothertown** (11): i wish i wish i wish i wish i wish a bitch wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooould.

**awhile2** (11): literally one of the best songs in existince. this shit gets me so hype like on another level stg im bout to go off on a btich man wtf this absinthe is really htiing rn

**waluigiest** (11): No sarcasm at all, this is Nicki at her best. Incredible flow, creative lyrics, biting humor. This song is rightfully legendary.

**williamdowley123** (11): and she didnt even hit that note

**agentofscranton** (10): i realised i was a true pophead when a kid in my media studies lesson used this song in a presentation to talk about how 'awful modern pop music was' in the most /r/lewronggeneration thing i've ever witnessed and i was just sitting there thinking this song fucking goes off

**EuroBish** (10): A guilty pleasure

**gateway2glimmer** (10): Everyone was so bothered by how ridiculous and vulgar Nicki was with this song and MV! Truly a #moment in pop culture. I regularly come back to this for a good ass shaking.

**jexan13** (10): This is my #1 guilty pleasure. The song I would never admit in public that I love. And here I am, exposing myself. I don't care, it's just so messy that I can't help but rap along

**passionfruits2** (10): underrated

**radiofan15** (10): The disorientating beat, the bizarre pop cultures references (including equating Lil Kim with Michael Jackson's pet monkey Bubbles) in the verses and the repetitive chorus... this song should have failed from the start but it all somehow works, and amazingly... also, the "i'm the female Weezy" never fails to give me the chills

**rickikardashian** (10): I'm not even giving this a 10 ironically, this song is hilarious and it actually gets clever at times. Seeing the entire internet rallying up against it was underserved but also hilarious

**rosecoloreds** (10): i will come at anyone who gives this a low score

**Saucymac** (10): iconic lyrics iconic song

**selegend** (10): fifth best song of all time

**Sliemy** (10): T10 rap diss track of ALL TIME!!

**TCHALLA1966** (10): 1 2 3 DO THE NICKI MINAJ BLINK

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Okay but if Lil Kim was so stupid how come she’s the highest selling musician on PayPal Music?

**lady\_sable** (9): kim found dead in a ditch

**lilacsweetener** (9): She had people MAD with this one. I can't decide if it's pure crazy or super ambitious. Both? Who else could pull this off, honestly I'm going to go ahead and say this is when she at least began to ascend to icon status.

**skargardin** (9): me at all my peers in uni courses

**slimboyfriend** (9): I didn’t want to suffer through 6 God-awful songs for this one, but I’m glad she’s here.

**DrunkHurricane** (8.5): this is so bad it's good

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): damn this song was ahead of its time but rip for brangelina

**nooodisaster** (8): Okay, the production is legit awful and I'll admit it. BUT the raps and disses here are some of the best and funniest of Nicki's entire career. There's soooo many petty and hilarious lines ("We ship platinum, these bitches shippin' wood"; "Look Bubbles, go back to your habitat"; etc etc.). I mean, LOOK AT THE MATERIAL.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ok this is objetively awful, but it woke me up.

**jordannimz** (7): this song seems to be totally panned by a lot of people, but it's actually pretty decent. "YOU'RE A STUPID HOE, YOU'RE A STUPID HOE, YOU'RE A STUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPID HOE!"

**ditacarlita** (6): totally belongs on a Nicki album

**rotating3Dtext** (5.5): sounds like a nervous breakdown

**gannade** (5): i honestly dont know what to rate this so ill just split it down the middle

**imasalesman** (5): I couldn't decide on 10 or 0 so

**jackisboredtoday** (5): i can’t tell whether i like the weirdness or hate it so im going right down the middle

**ignitethephoenix** (1): This song is so annoying on like 10 different levels

**LiberalMusicLover** (0): The video was... something? The song... it's nothing.

This SLAPS. RedOne also worked on this song along with the two singles preceding it and he really snapped here. Nicki's rapid delivery really fits the bombastic electronic production and this is probably my second favourite song on the album. Y'all seem to agree that it slaps, because it did quite well for being an abrasive sounding non-single. For the longest time this song had an average over 8.0 and was solidly in the top 10, but unfortunately the last few scores pushed it out of those two categories, which is real unfortunate. Still, a solid performance for what it is!

---

**EuroBish** (11): Iconic legendary yes

**JunkyGS** (10): banger bop

**letsallpoo** (10): pop nicki's peak

**LiberalMusicLover** (10): Nicki's greatest song. Would've been her only #1 hit had she released it over Pound the Alarm.

**radiofan15** (10): Even in her most generic Miss Petty-Maraj snaps so hard!

**selegend** (10): second best song of all time

**skargardin** (10): No words if yall rob this bop

**TCHALLA1966** (10): lowkey want my first time doing anything with a whip to be to this song.

**waluigiest** (10): the forgotten sister to Starships and Pound the Alarm. Slaps so hard with some good rap verses too

**1998tweety** (9): This is incredibly dated but I fuck with it hard, it really does transport me back to that time huh.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): getting the strap for anyone that doesn’t like this song

**vhqv1997** (9): Remember when Nicki held a poll to see which song among Pound The Alarm, Va Va Vooom, and Whip It should be the next single and fans kept arguing in favor of Pound The Alarm or Va Va Voom? And then when the polls revealed Va Va Voom to be the winner, Nicki went with Pound The Alarm anyway because she personally liked it better? All I'm saying is that Whip It is like the Bulbasaur of starter Pokemon choices. Constantly underrated, but actually the superior choice.

**williamdowley123** (9): saiditaminuteagoididitaminuteagoidropitipickitupslowiwantitikickinthedoorcausetheyknowthativegotthat GOOD SHIT

**jexan13** (8.9): The damn hook of this song. It's really good but the dated production really hurts it.

**jordannimz** (8): definitely a bop, and I love that dubstep drop. Her vocals are not as strong here, and are more audibly autotuned. Still good though.

**gateway2glimmer** (7): Fun and sexy.

**nooodisaster** (7): The chorus here is pretty meh, but I can't help but laugh whenever she raps about her SAT scores, that gets bonus points.

**passionfruits2** (7): it could be the title to a Chorli sexysex song, I Got It, Unlock It, Whip It, Drop It, Pop It, etc.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I may be losing my mind, but this song is so blatantly trashy that it reminds me of some kind of proto-PC music banger, especially the vocals before the drop

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): the verses are a SERVE here but the hook doesn’t live up to it

**gannade** (5.5): pop nicki is NOT GOOD

**anothertown** (5): lmao

This song is kind of wild to me because it's so ahead of its time! This sounds exactly like something Rihanna could release today and it would fit right in with the current pop landscape, with the trap influence. I feel like a lot of the trap-influenced pop we see pop girls put out nowadays feels a bit watered down, but this doesn't at all. In both its production and how immaculately Rihanna carries herself on the track it's an absolute bad bitch anthem, and I'm glad to see it make it to day 3.

---

**EuroBish** (10): yasss a real bad bish

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Can’t wait until the song gets unfairly robbed because all of you don’t know a good hoe song when you hear it

**jordannimz** (10): THE strip club anthem that shaped my outlook on life. Maybe that's taking it a bit far, but I have no option but to act sexy and pretend I'm in the music video every time I hear this song.

**passionfruits2** (10): h0e anthem

**selegend** (10): classic! kinda feels like bbhmm is its prequel

**Sliemy** (10): When Rih ascended into being #THAT bitch, this was everybody's bad bitch anthem in 2012.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): is this one of the greatest slut anthems of all time? yes

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): bad bitch song

**radiofan15** (9.1): Suddenly I wanna go to a strip club and pour all of my hard-earned money on the buttcrack of a Magic Mike...

**ditacarlita** (9): god i had this on repeat for months/years, a fucking anthem, makes me feel sexy, powerful and cashed up even though i'm dancing around in my dressing gown

**fxsparrow** (9): hoes' anthem

**gateway2glimmer** (9): A great track in general, and a perfect BAMF track for Rihanna. She's so effortlessly cool.

**lilacsweetener** (9): it's soulless and empty but it just works so well for those crazy drunken moments

**skargardin** (9): I could do without the OOOOOH screeching, otherwise, this song brings out my inner stripper alter ego, love it for that

**waluigiest** (9): this is glamor. simple enough

**nooodisaster** (8): Riri really predicted the era of less than 3 minute songs, her mind.

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is filler but good filler.

**anothertown** (7.5): love when they put the underwater-sounding filter on the track

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): My dad who hates all modern rap/R&B once told me he liked this song because it felt “brash and honest…” still trying to analyze that

**jexan13** (7.1): sobs while I check my wallet and see that the only thing I can pour up are my tears

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is like the first album cuts, but if people actually put thought into them, also I can't wait for this to make day 3 on singles bias alone

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): what was the point?

All I have to say about this is that it SLAPS. It's a magnificent blend of electronic production and Kesha's rockier side, fitting perfectly in between the two places Warrior as an album wants to go. It's one of the best relationship kiss-off songs I've heard, and I'm ecstatic that it managed to worm its way into the top 10!

---

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): this is the best song on the album btw

**lilacsweetener** (10): Between calling a guy "slut", Rihanna at strip clubs and Nicki getting every dude rapper to feature on her album, I am all about the three albums in this rate showcasing women invading typically male dominated spaces.

**lilguavachan** (10): y'all really paid kesha dust in this era when she was giving you all these amazing songs.... i will never forgive the general public

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): this song better make it to the third day ITS SO GOOD

**\_wailordfan** (9.5): her deep cuts here are the strongest suit for the album.

**jexan13** (9.3): The "thinking of youuuHuHu" in the chorus is my favorite vocals moment of the album

**jordannimz** (9): the ultimate kiss-off to an ex. Also the talk box in the bridge gets me going every time.

**skargardin** (9): the way these first six tracks are just absolute bangers.. let me breathe

**vhqv1997** (9): That bridge sounds like an Owl City bridge, and I love Owl City, so I love this song

**1998tweety** (8.5): I think someone made a post that this is about Zac Efron? That's all I can think of now

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This is the “You’re So Vain” of our time. [I can’t trust any of you to link the iconic thread so here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/9q6yre/is_keshas_song_thinking_of_you_released_in_2012/)

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Kesha really is such a savage with a bad attitude and I will FOREVER STAN!

**radiofan15** (8.5): The Daft Punk portion of this song really saved the whole ordeal

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): feminist queen, flipping the word 'slut' against her ex-bf

**slimboyfriend** (8): The rock star break up anthem Kesha always needed to make

**waluigiest** (8): for me, this is a song that is ALMOST excellent. With more dramatic production, the chorus could have been super impactful. The way it is now, it’s fun but too constrained. That being said, the parallel writing on the chorus is so tasty

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the cheating on me slut part gives me life

**ditacarlita** (6.5): give em hell girl!!

**fxsparrow** (6): wondering why I've never heard this song on the Radio

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this one doesn't work as well as the other songs. idk

**anothertown** (4): "suck m'dick"

BITCHES AIN'T SHIT AND THEY AIN'T SAY NOTHIN. A HUNDRED MOTHAFUCKAS CAN'T TELL ME NOTHIN. Truly an iconic opening line, but I'm surprised overall that this song did so well in the rate! Nicki's strategy during the album rollout of Roman Reloaded was to try to cater to both the fun EDM-pop fanbase that she gained with Super Bass, but also keep some of her hip-hop cred by releasing a song like this as a single. The beat is minimalistic and the focus is all on her bars, and the point she tried to make by releasing this as a single definitely goes through. I thought that popheads might not be so hot on the track because it's definitely far more hip-hop leaning, but y'all proved me wrong by getting this into the top 10!

---

**gannade** (11): still the single best song of nickis career

**letsallpoo** (11): there are some points she has made

**passionfruits2** (11): a bop, now officially recognized by Pitchfork

**gateway2glimmer** (10): Iconic.

**jordannimz** (10): definitely the best song on the rap section of this album — the minimal production 100% stands the test of time and still feels current; her flow is fantastic, especially her second verse at the end. Makes you want to dance a little freaky 😂

**radiofan15** (10): She made some points AND was ahead of the game here, literally inventing trap and all of dis bitches' careers... i love it.

**selegend** (10): third best song of all time

**slimboyfriend** (10): ...Bees?

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): fucking slaps

**TCHALLA1966** (10): This song really is everything from the beat to the ft.

**ditacarlita** (9): I taught my brother and sister this song so they could yell it out our car window when we were doing mainies in the car. They weren't even 10 years old yet LOL

**jexan13** (9): I got a love/hate relationship with this song, but I cannot deny how good it is. Great hooks and good flow. It can get a bit long, but it's truly a standout of the album.

**JunkyGS** (9): one of the catchiest openings, I swear this song ruined me because whenever I hear the word bees or trap I instantly sing to myself "bitchiest aint shit, and they aint say nothin, a 100 motha fuckas cant tell me nothing"

**lilacsweetener** (9): COLD.

**zaminizjammin** (9): - One of the best 2 chainz verses of all time, and dat bridge wowwww

**1998tweety** (8.5): I actually really didn't like this before, but it has grown on me quite a bit.

**lady\_sable** (8): can we get an f in this chat for meme queen nicki

**waluigiest** (8): This song feels like I’m levitating and vibrating. I think it was ahead of its time. I love the verse where she just name drops the whole US lol

**williamdowley123** (8): minecraft bee is trans

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Nicki has a decent performance in this, better than I remembered. 2 Chainz's verse is whacker than I remember though.

**fxsparrow** (7): This is good.. 2 Chainz fits perfectly

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): It’s good but it makes its point and then keep going. I feel like this could have been an interlude.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): put it in your kidney wtf

**skargardin** (7): bop but 2 chainz wasn't necessary

**TragicKingdom1** (7): the production on this is absurdly icy

**anothertown** (6): this really popped in college but now there is no "there" there i guess

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I really like the weird production on this song but I’m not sure if I love the rest. It’s too slowly paced. Also does 2 Chainz sound weird on here or is it just me?

**vhqv1997** (6): When I was younger, I thought she said "I pees in the truck"

**rickikardashian** (5.7): It was fun, but then a minute passed and this just started reminding me of Bubble Butt and I just couldn't enjoy this song as much

**nooodisaster** (5): A fucking mess I had no idea if I was going to give a 1 or a 10 to. IF I WEREN'T PIMPING I'D BE GETTING IT- PERIOD!

**jackisboredtoday** (4.8): nicki nicki nicki put it in your kidney

**agentofscranton** (4): i couldn't finish this song because it genuinely started to hurt my ears

I think that, despite the placements of the other two, all three album openers in this rate are quite interesting. Warrior, a bombastic EDM anthem, is my favourite song in the rate and got my 11. Phresh Out The Runway is a bad bitch banger and is a fitting opening for Unapologetic. But really, neither can even remotely compare to the iconicness that is Roman Holiday, one of 2019's best meme songs but also legitimately an enjoyable song to listen to. It's very theatrical and is peak early-2010s Nicki when a large part of her image was her alter-ego and how she integrated that into her rapping. I initially thought this song would not do very well in the rate but I was instantly proven wrong, as it stayed in the top 10 with an 8.0+ average for the entire rating period. Truly iconic!

---

**CarlieScion** (11): [insert comment saying [insert comment about the stan twitter meme here] here]

**DinastyOrDieNasty** (11): Can you say legendary ?

**radiofan15** (11): Yeah, I know it's a meme and everything, I know it's over-the-top and extravagant, but hear me out: back when it premiered, it did so with the now iconic Grammy performance, the one that was done at the request of the Grammy telecast committee and the one that apparently killed any chance of Nicki to win a Grammy in the immediate future and the one that got a bunch of Catholics butthurt, and it was a glorious moment... she literally served vocals, choreo, acting, props, costumes and a storyline; this was, of course, the icing of the cake of an already flawless era full of bops and iconic moments, before she got lazy with stuff like Megatron and half of Queen, and before she became a toxic and nasty person with her continuous support of pedophiles, criminals and petty bottoms on Twitter... for me, Roman Holiday is already a fantastic song, with a complex and overloaded production theatrical quality to it that makes it the closest we have gotten to something like Bohemian Rhapsody in hip-hop, and that's the only thing it needed for me to stand out, being something that will pump me up and made me feel proud of stanning (at the time) someone like Miss Petty-Maraj. Even with the iconic performance and the memes, this is a discography highlight for Nicki and, honestly, I don't think she can top this...

**slimboyfriend** (11): With all of the Lady Gaga comparisons that were flying around in 2012, you have to admit that even Lady Gaga never approached the audacity of releasing anything as musically whacko as THIS. This song is everything I loved about Nicki Minaj in 2012 but turned up to 666.

**1998tweety** (10): It was camp

**\_wailordfan** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcoy3_w1yVE

**awhile2** (10): burh i remember watching the vma awards with my parents when nicki perfromed this song and they thought i was crazy for fucking with it but this shit is harddd

**imasalesman** (10): this was a JOURNEY

**jexan13** (10): What else can be said about this? Catchy AF chorus, amazing beat, great flow, campy in a great way. Almost got my 11; I don't care about the memes, this song is amazing. Too bad that the rest of the album doesn't really sound too much like this.

**jordannimz** (10): I loved this song when it first came out, had a period of time when I was bored of it, but I love it again! It's just so delightfully weird!

**JunkyGS** (10): I actually loved this song before it became a meme, but after it became a meme I fell in love with it again. It is so bizarre and hype at the same time. One of the most memorable album openers ever haha

**lady\_sable** (10): god i miss how theatrical she used to be

**letsallpoo** (10): i have over 100 scrobbles from this from 2012 y'all were fucking LATE to this masterpiece

**lilguavachan** (10): it's an interesting, fun song that makes for an amazing opening track. is it good? no, but it's theatrical and provocative

**mayolizard** (10): this right here might make a bitch cry

**passionfruits2** (10): she's dangerossss

**rosecoloreds** (10): an absolute CLASSIC

**skargardin** (10): I hate that this had to become a meme to make people see its greatness. It's such a fucking good time, pure insanity.

**Sliemy** (10): A pop masterpiece and remains the best ever Grammy performance in history.

**TCHALLA1966** (10): A LEGENDARY BOP MEME OR NO MEME STILL SNAPPS

**vhqv1997** (10): This song is fucking weird and choatic, I'm not sure if it was her intention or just pure coincidence but the sound and the delivery very much sounds like an anxiety attack, which I suppose everybody has known that already since it's become a huge meme. I don't even know what exactly Nicki intended this song to be and what sonic choice she made intentionally, but this song just sounds so fresh and creative, there is simply nothing like it, and while it could really put people off, I really believe music needs songs like this to push the boundaries of not just the genre but also the listeners.

**waluigiest** (10): I don’t actually like the hook that much. The rest of the song, however, is perfect. Her rap opening of the album being “You done? You tight? You suck at life?” is truly an iconic way of announcing that she is here to stay after breaking out. This song got memed to death and it deserves it honestly! The dark, percussive beat with Nicki literally panting over it was such a serve. And the BRIDGE??? Where she fucking breaks out a HYMN??????? We weren’t ready for this in 2012.

**williamdowley123** (10): panic attack: the song

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Memes aside this is a cool song, it’s not often a mainstream artist is willing to go this weird. Is it good? Not always, but it’s memorable and holds my attention like a vice grip.

**selegend** (9): iconic opener

**anothertown** (8.5): i forgot this was literally track one on this album like oh the highly anticipated followup to pink friday what do we have here.. oh.. world war six? also the part where she sings come all ye faithful.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Where do I start with this song? I have listened to this a few times I can’t decide if this is a masterpiece or actually a bad song. I’m leading towards a masterpiece that is good in small doses. Nicki really does 3 different songs on here (with a lovely rendition of the Christmas hymn Oh Come All Ye Faithful at the middle/end) and its a beautiful mess. This song is the rollercoaster we never asked for, but it’s the one we needed.

**agentofscranton** (8): the meme is the only good thing Nicki's been part of post-Pinkprint

**ditacarlita** (8): quirky but worthy

**megm26** (7.8): i've seen so many memes of this song that i've pretty much memorized the second verse

**gateway2glimmer** (7): I am such a sucker for theatrical songs. It's not a spectacular song, but it does the job. HUMMMMM, BITCH! HUMMMMM, TWITCH! HUMMMM, BITCH, MOTHERFUCKING RIGHT, THIS IS WORLD WAR SIX!

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this come all ye faithful part is awful

**rickikardashian** (7): This is a quite solid song, but forreal, this song is just a meme now, there's no way to not picture high-speed running when I hear it

**static\_int\_husp** (7): I honestly hate the choruses on this but the verses are fun.

**nooodisaster** (6): if i was rating the meme, of course it would get a 10. But as a song, it's really messy, filled with some pretty good lines, and a nonsensical yet fun chorus.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.2): insert sped-up roman holiday meme here

**lilacsweetener** (5): damn ma is it that serious

**TragicKingdom1** (5): i actually kinda love the production but everything else ........

**fxsparrow** (4): I don't think holiday is what she need..

**EuroBish** (3.5): This is what people made viral all the time? Jesus

This feels like Starships' less iconic little sister, and so its placement here makes a lot of sense. It's still an absolute banger, but it very much resembles the song preceding it and feels just a bit inferior. Not inferior enough for me to not give this a 10 though, because it SLAPS. The buildup to the drop is amazing, and the alarm-like sound of the drop makes me go absolutely feral. Definitely deserving of a top 10 position and good average! Let's see where her older sister makes it to!

---

**sailormunelune** (11): what an absolute bop

**1998tweety** (10): I've always liked this song, but wow the drag race lipsync really converted me to a stan huh.

**EuroBish** (10): A BOP

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is honestly one of Nicki’s best song. It’s a perfect blend of pop and rap and it’s a major bop.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Monet fucking snapped

**jordannimz** (10): another throwback jam, the pre-chorus/drop go hard. Her vocals are great in this song imo. Also 3 10/10 songs in a row!

**mayolizard** (10): OH OH OH

**passionfruits2** (10): monét and dusty found in a ditch

**radiofan15** (10): Another EDM dancefloor anthem as many of the same era... however, that doesn't mean this is a lesser track or something, as sometimes you just need to have some fun

**selegend** (10): fourth best song of all time

**skargardin** (10): tfw you get nostalgic for Pound The Alarm and Starships...

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): that 1-2 punch of starships and pound the alarm really just hits right

**TCHALLA1966** (10): POUND MY ALARM !

**JunkyGS** (9): banger

**rotating3Dtext** (9): THIS IS TRASH. FUN TRASH.

**waluigiest** (9): bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle. The sounds in this song are somehow so dated but also eternal.

**\_wailordfan** (8.5): another poppy bop, but Starships little sister for sure.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Sometimes being loud and being good are the same thing.

**megm26** (7.6): I've never heard this song before but it still gives me 2012 nostalgia

**fxsparrow** (7.5): Everytime I see a carnival this song plays in my heard

**lady\_sable** (7.5): this is peak 2012

**lilguavachan** (7.5): it's fun but songs like this at the time were a dime a dozen so like who cares

**ditacarlita** (7): again could have been better but I hate these weird breakdowns

**slimboyfriend** (7): Sexy AND Hotter

**vhqv1997** (7): This song and Starships are just demos of each other. They have almost the same structure, the same delivery, practically the same kind of drop. You could do a mash-up of these two songs and it would sound like what the tracks originally were

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): HOTTER AND HOTTER SEXY AND HOTTER

**anothertown** (2): i would give this at least 2 more points if it werent for the "music........makes me.............high......"

**gannade** (1): this is AWFUL and should be considered cultural appropriation

This song goes off. It feels less in the vein of Starships and Pound The Alarm in their abrasiveness and more like the basic electropop singles from the rest of the pop half of the album, except it's actually really good and has some soul to it. It definitely deserved better on the charts, AND it most definitely deserved an actual spot on the album as opposed to just the deluxe version, because it's unfortunately a little bit forgotten. Even so, it did very well in this rate and I'm very happy about that.

---

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): Va Va Voom is an incredible pop-rap song. The bridge is terrific, the lyrics are clever and fun, and the chorus is super catchy!

**agentofscranton** (10): genuinely the best song she's ever released in her entire career

**gannade** (10): this is pop nicki at her best, and also the only good pop nicki song oop

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Underrated bop

**imasalesman** (10): i forgot this existed until now but a BOP

**lilacsweetener** (10): The best pop song she ever did. Just flawless, the verses are so smooth and the chorus just explodes.

**radiofan15** (10): This should have been her 2012 Super Bass... we failed her

**selegend** (10): sixth best song of all time

**skargardin** (10): pop perfection ladies and gents

**1998tweety** (9): This is kind of meh but for Nicki standards it slaps hard.

**jordannimz** (9): finally another song that is undeniably good. I was student council co-president in grade 8, and I put this song on the playlist for one of the school dances, and my gay ass was the only person in the gym who actually cared about it. Such a jam.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): this is just so much fun to rap

**waluigiest** (9): paved the way for anaconda tbh

**jackisboredtoday** (8): I have no clue what the fuck va va voom means but I’m a sucker for early 10s EDM and alliteration so i don’t need to know

**nooodisaster** (8): Nicki REALLY wanted this to be Super Bass 2.0 even going so far as putting it as a deluxe track yet releasing it as a single. Production wise, it's prob one of the best. Yet you need better lyrics gurl.

**slimboyfriend** (8): God doesn’t exist because if he did he wouldn’t have let Nicki Minaj release the standard edition of this album with tracks 13-18 and NOT this song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): It’s like, “Pound The Alarm” or “Starships” but not as iconic. Still good though.

**LiberalMusicLover** (7): A retread of Super Bass, just not as good, but still decent.

**vhqv1997** (7): Walmart Super Bass is a nice song to bop to but it's not anything special

**jexan13** (6.5): I think I would have loved it if I first heard it in 2012.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): its ok but at least its upbeat

I'm a little surprised that this is going before Stay because Diamonds seems like it has more potential to be universally appreciated, but at the same time I have to say that, although it is quite good and I gave it a 9, Rihanna has much better lead singles in her discography. This leans a little too hard on the Sia impersonation side of things, which I don't mind at all really because the production and her vocals are still very pretty, but as you can see in the comments that does get to some people and they're not as big on the song as others are. Still, deserving of top 5 most definitely! Can she pull off the win with Stay?

---

**ditacarlita** (11): her voice carries so much emotion, an absolute classic!

**gateway2glimmer** (11): Iconic, legendary. This song is going down in history, it absolutely went on to be one of the tracks that defined the music of this pop culture era.

**JunkyGS** (11): I really forgot how beautiful this song was until I re-listened for the rate. It has aged very well imo and is inspiring / touching, without being cheesy.

**Saucymac** (11): this is such a beautiful and iconic song, I couldn't not give it an 11

**sweetnsoursauce1** (11): damn i can't believe i've loved this song for 7 years now. The vocals are A+, Rihanna emotes (is that right??) beautifully and it's a timeless song for me

**1998tweety** (10): We love Sia

**agentofscranton** (10): this is a reference only the brit popheads will get, but I can't listen to this song without thinking of lucy beale from eastenders - and how the episode where it was revealed that her little brother bobby killed her started with her dead body rising from the ground and going back in time to the night she was killed whilst this song played. wild.

**gannade** (10): this was a really basic single but i kinda like it. it aged pretty well

**lady\_sable** (10): its very apparent that this was written by sia lol

**LiberalMusicLover** (10): Rihanna did Sia better than Sia could do Sia.

**passionfruits2** (10): i need a Sia version in Spotify NOW.

**radiofan15** (10): Sia snapped here...

**Sliemy** (10): This will definitely take a hit from the "overrated" crowd, but this song was truly her classic, before I got into stan culture this was the song I most knew Rihanna for and the song that I legit heard everywhere, from everybody. Still holds up massively today, a very gorgeous and meaningful song.

**waluigiest** (10): everything about this is gorgeous. Sia and Rihanna killed it. Hoping this song inspires Nintendo to release Sinnoh remakes.

**jexan13** (9.9): Loved it when it was everywhere, love it still.

**anothertown** (9): she really was a big drama bitch that year, you love to see it.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): basically a sia song sung by Rihanna. Still good though, but I don’t think it’s one of her best.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Sia snapped

**jordannimz** (9): what is the sequencing though??? They go from a crazy synth voguing jam to THE power ballad of 2012? Anyway, her vocals are incredible here (although some live performances top this), and Sia's songwriting is amazing, as per usual.

**nooodisaster** (9): A rate winner, we stan.

**rickikardashian** (9): I like this song, but since I saw people pointing out how Riri tries to emulate the way Sia sings I can't help but to hear her sing in cursive and it makes me enjoy this a tad less

**vhqv1997** (8.5): No offence to Rihanna but Sia sang this song better

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): classic

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): My dad loves this song.

**awhile2** (6): most annoying ass rihanna hook

**selegend** (6): cute

**skargardin** (5.5): midtier Sia, I was originally going to give this a six but i was tempted to skip it so the score dropped accordingly

**lilguavachan** (1): listen i liked this song when it first came out and people doing these overdramatic sia impressions were new and exciting. it's very grating now.

And so Rihanna is the first to drop out of the rate... not entirely unexpected. A common sentiment I've seen is that prior to Anti her strength was mainly in her singles, which I can agree with, and shows in these rate results. However, I feel like the two big ones from Unapologetic are a bit more polarizing because they're both ballads, which contrasts heavily with the bops and bangers that popheads usually prefers. Stay's instrumentation is simple - it's just piano - which is VERY different from the maximalist, bombastic production seen in other songs (including the top 3). While it is a contrast, it helps it in a way, being a breath of fresh air especially if you aren't as inclined to enjoy the dated production seen in a lot of the other songs. Interestingly enough though, this as well as Diamonds weren't top 5 for a decent chunk of the rate - in fact, both were outside of the top 10 and Rihanna was dead by #12. Her fans eventually showed up, but hey, it could have been much worse for her!

---

**\_wailordfan** (11): The ballad curse definitely exists, but DAMN does Rihanna body this.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): Not only my fav Rihanna song, but also one of my top 10 for all my music. Just fantastic and beautifully done

**fxsparrow** (11): This is so heartbreaking

**rosecoloreds** (11): i was weirdly attracted to rihanna in mv for this and then later in life realized i was gay and just for that reason it deserves my 11

**1998tweety** (10): We love her ballad era

**anothertown** (10): the defining pop ballad of the 2010s!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A great ballad that will probably be robbed because it’s a ballad

**lilacsweetener** (10): The SNL performance is one of her all time best.

**lilguavachan** (10): i'm a sucker for a ballad, what can i say

**rickikardashian** (10): Rihanna for me has never been an artist is looked up to because of her voice, it was always her attitude and insane amount of confidence that attracted me to her, but Stay is one of the exceptions to this. Here she drops the "badass bitch give a fuck bouta man" facade and shows a huge vulnerable part of her, singing in such a honest, painful way you can't help but to feel for her. Rihanna has few songs that open up to her in such a fragile, truthful way, and that's fine, because it makes songs like this be so much more special and beautiful

**Sliemy** (10): Potentially her best slow ballad ever, the minimalist production allows for her to shine on one of her most vocally impressive performances to date. I always forget that this isn't a solo song, because she just really completely steals the show, and it won in the long run ending up with the biggest stats from the Unapologetic era.

**TCHALLA1966** (10): Queen of making mikky ekko a star!

**waluigiest** (10): gorgeous ballad. I fell in love with this in high school from the first “if you dare come a little closer”

**zaminizjammin** (10): - A timeless classic, where did Mikky Ekko go?

**vhqv1997** (9.5): I like this but did anybody listen to the version with only Mikky? I feel like he suits this song way more than her and his solo version is a bit more resonant than this, but their harmony together really creates a compelling rendition anyway, and it especially suits the tone and lyrics of the song.

**ditacarlita** (9): one of rihanna's best ballads

**gannade** (9): rihs vocals are pretty

**ImADudeDuh** (9): iconic.........................

**nooodisaster** (9): i cri evrytim (but actually what an emotional poignant and understated song, i used to put this to ALL my ships back in the day)

**jordannimz** (8): I really like this song, and their harmonies are perfect. The production seems a little sloppy to me though; there's a lot of white noise that cuts in and out and while it's subtle, it takes away from the song for me.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): This was tailor made for middle school slow dances with the “round and around” hook, but luckily I was in middle school when this was big and slow danced to it

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I don’t know, maybe I’ve just heard one too many contemporary musical theatre songs that sound like this but this track doesn’t do all that much for me. It’s very well written but I think it hasn’t aged that well; it’s not dated but it feels like so much has happened since then that this isn’t as impressive as it once was.

**skargardin** (7): I used to love this song but i don't know.. it almost put me to sleep. Still a good song, don't get me wrong but there are better songs on the album.

**williamdowley123** (7): bo burnham be like

**lady\_sable** (6.5): honestly i could never really get into this one, idk why. it's pretty but. eh

**radiofan15** (6.5): Sappy ballad whose only reason of existence is because Someone Like You was a hit... it's not terrible but the lesser of the similar piano ballads of the era EX. Say Somethin, When I Was Your Man, etc.

**EuroBish** (5.5): Grew off me greatly

**slimboyfriend** (5): Rihanna pls don’t go back to soft adult contemporary sadboi songs ever again--it’s not a good look for u

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4.5): eh

 This is probably my least favourite album in the rate, as it definitely feel quite filler-y in my opinion. However, I do appreciate some of the bops on here so it's definitely not all bad! It has its fans and they nearly got Rihanna to the win, but unfortunately the balladry of its singles just isn't for everyone and as such they fell short.

**jexan13** (8.187): I really thought this was going to be the worst album of the rate, considering Miss Fenty (un)fame as a singles artist. Turns out it was surprisingly good and from the three, it is the only one I can see myself longing to come back to. It's sonically varied and, except a few songs, it aged well. I would have never expected that my 11 was going to be for a Rihanna album deep-cut, but she really did that.

**jordannimz** (8.000): Thoughts before listening: This is actually my least favourite Rihanna album, but let's see what I think this listen-through.

**waluigiest** (7.067): I think Rihanna was tired. Some real wonderful content here, but she desperately needed a musical break after so many albums back-to-back.

**skargardin** (6.700): Okay so confession time: I think I've been too hard on this album, it's really not as bad as people make it out to be, there are some actual bops on it.

**radiofan15** (6.473): Listening to a Rihanna album from her pre-ANTI era it's like listening to a bag of Lays chips, only 30% is actual food, the rest is filler air... and oh boy, there's A LOT OF FILLER IN HERE. [Score: C]

**nooodisaster** (6.400): This is probably my least favorite Rihanna album (haven't listened to MotS). You can tell this was really the breaking point for the one album a year schedule Rihanna's team had forced, as by now they could barely put two hits on the record and the rest is half-finished or generic ideas.

**TragicKingdom1** (4.933): Wow, I didn't remember this being this bad! It combines the worst parts of both past and present pop: the crowded, noisy production of the early '10s plus the lifeless dreariness of a lot of modern pop. Rihanna herself is really the saving grace here, because by this point in her career she's firmly established her swagger, but a large chunk of this album is barely listenable nowadays. [Grade: C-]

This was the one song that I thought would 100% win going into the rate, which is, well, REALLY boring. As much as I love it, and as absolutely iconic as it is, it would have been the most uninteresting ending to this and I'm glad it didn't end up taking the crown. It ended up tying for #2 with another song, but because this has a higher controversy scores it's getting cut "first". Now all that remains to be seen is what this song tied with - did Kesha tie with herself, or will Starships be sharing the #2 spot?

---

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Honestly, a classic. One of my all time favourite Kesha songs.

**lady\_sable** (11): truly deserved better, an absolutely legendary bop

**rickikardashian** (11): This song honestly captures the "Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young" so perfectly it's kinda nostalgic and all. It's pure energy and fun, it sounds so pure of life, as if it was using all it had for the 3:32 it exists, just like the lyrics suggest. Apparently Kesha isn't the biggest fan of this song, and if so, she has no taste, because this is just an overall amazing song and easily one of the best ones in her discography

**static\_int\_husp** (11): My favorite ke$ha with the dollar sign. One of the few good electropop hits to come out of the first half of the decade, and fairly feel good. ~~I wonder if this would have gone to #1 is Sandy Hook didn't tragically happen, causing this song to be pulled from radio.~~

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop that was robbed of going #1, too bad those kids had to die....

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The “stripped” version is particularly chilling as well.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Ok, but don't forget that the deconstructed mix of this is a fucking ballop.

**radiofan15** (10): Fuck the Sandy Hook Elementary School kids, this song deserved to reach #1

**skargardin** (10): Pop perfection, point, blank, periodt

**zaminizjammin** (10): - this track just took a DNA test, turns out it's 100% Ke$ha

**megm26** (9.2): this song SLAPS

**anothertown** (9): i LOVE the chorus...... thump thump

**LiberalMusicLover** (9): I love this song and it's still on one of my playlists till this day. I'd say it's probably her second best (after "Your Love Is My Drug" from her debut).

**vhqv1997** (9): I can't stop thinking about this thread on this subreddit: https://i.imgur.com/sd9iEun.png

**waluigiest** (9): anyone else remember the Becky G cover?

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Honestly not my favorite song on the record, but makes sense as the lead single. Deserved better.

**jordannimz** (8): again, I remember the first time I heard this song; I was sitting in the car outside Walmart, waiting for my mom to come back, and I heard this on the radio (I already loved Kesha), and I was so excited when I heard this was the lead single for a new album. Such a fun song. Also, the remix with Becky G, Juicy J, and Wiz Khalifa????? chef’s kiss

**\_wailordfan** (7.5): Kesha has a strange recurring issue of all of her singles sounding like they are trying to match the sound of Animal, but always just comes across as a poor B-Side.

**ditacarlita** (7): cute but it doesn't really go anywhere

**fxsparrow** (7): "2012" was the end of the world

**jexan13** (6.5): A +9 score died prematurely when the EDM drop hit.

**selegend** (4): i dont like the drop for this one anymore

**gannade** (0): This song has no redeeming qualities to me. The main hook is lazy, just a half-hearted stutter of d-d-d-d-die young. The boilerplate synth beat in the background is even lazier. Her faux rapping is monotonous and robotic, and the only sign of a real melody is the prechorus, which is overflowing with autotune because Kesha can't find the key. Overall, the song is anachronistic but also generic for its time.

And so Nicki just barely falls short. But man, what an absolute classic. When you think of 2012, *THIS* is what you think of. Pop Nicki is such a product of its time, and the absolutely nutty drop courtesy of RedOne makes that absolutely clear. This was her best shot at winning, but that drop really did kill her chances. I honestly think I'd say that it felt slightly out of place in 2012 itself - it feels like it goes a bit harder and is more abrasive than other hits of the time (and other songs in this rate) which makes it feel like it aged even worse. I don't see that as a bad thing at all because my music taste stopped developing around 2013 and I'll forever be an absolute slut for overproduced EDM-pop, but unfortunately for Miss Onika it was not enough to win the rate.

---

**mayolizard** (11): bop

**selegend** (11): best song of all time

**TCHALLA1966** (11): YAAAAASASSASSASSAAAAAAAAAAAAAASZZZZZAaaaaaSSSSS my last.fm said I’ve played this 850 times and I’m not even mad.

**worlds-okayest666** (11): Aged like fine wine. The final drop makes me go FERAL

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop, I remember all the blonde skinny white girls getting their life from it in middle school.

**DinastyOrDieNasty** (10): Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wishes

**imasalesman** (10): this sounds terrible but i love it

**jordannimz** (10): ok yeah this is like iconic. The first Nicki song probably everyone heard, I distinctly remember sitting in my mom's car on the way home from theatre practice and hearing this song on the radio, and thinking, "wow this song is so good, I wonder who did this song," and being blown away when THE SAME PERSON was doing both the rapping and singing. Also just a bop. I miss RedOne.

**lady\_sable** (10): amazing that this song still makes me go absolutely ape shitt. also cant listen to it without thinking of the ninki minjaj vine.

**nooodisaster** (10): THIS IS FUCKING ICONIC!!

**passionfruits2** (10): i wish i was at the beach rn

**radiofan15** (10): In the words of her nemesis Mariah Carey "THAT WAS A CLASSIC"

**rickikardashian** (10): Man, we gotta keep it real, if Nicki couldn't get to #1 with Super Bass, Anaconda, and especially this, she probably will never get one. She truly had everyone with this song, it was not only unavoidable, it was also catchy as hell, I truly don't think there's a person on Earth that hasn't heard this song.

**rosecoloreds** (10): let's go to the beach beach ninki minjaj

**Saucymac** (10): the only version better than this is the miranda sings version

**skargardin** (10): Amazing, showstopping... truly an immaculate bop

**Sliemy** (10): Truly surprises me that this song is so decisive amongst pop fans, so much pure fun and energy.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): probably Nicki's most underrated pop sounding song

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): goddamn this song summarises 2012

**waluigiest** (10): If Nicki Minaj didn't say "fuck who you love and fuck who you like" we wouldn't have Old Town Road.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): the guardians of the galaxy are shaking

**JunkyGS** (9.5): this beat is nutty

**fxsparrow** (9): Twinkle Twinkle little star

**gateway2glimmer** (9): Seven years later, I still can't listen to this song without at least dancing in my seat. -1 point because the drop still doesn't sound right, and it never will.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): when will your fucking fave sample twinkle twinkle little star

**sailormunelune** (9): The cast of Glee could never

**lilguavachan** (8.5): god this weird wave of nostalgia is hitting me again on this dumb song... i hate this

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): the drop is SO confusing

**megm26** (8.2): this song hits me with so much nostalgia from when it was popular, and it's also a great banger

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Finally… a pop song. This was clearly written to be pandering to the pop crowd and you know what? It worked, this slaps.

**LiberalMusicLover** (8): The video for this was horrendous, but it's a great pop song of its time, akin to the Lady Gaga and Katy Perry hits of the late 2000s/early 2010s.

**slimboyfriend** (8): When I think 2012, I. THINK. OF. THIS. SONG. It’s both withstood the test of time and sounds tragically dated

**williamdowley123** (8): this song would be legendary if it didnt have that shitty drop

**jexan13** (7.3): I've always hated the EDM drop, even when dated EDM was not yet dated. It ruins the song and it doesn't fit for me.

**ditacarlita** (7): could have been higher but ruined by that awful happy hardcore sounding breakdown ew

**vhqv1997** (7): This song is so 2008, yes I know it's released in 2012, I read the name of this rate, I'm not dumb, it's just that the drop is so overdone for me by this point that I keep thinking of it as more ancient than it is.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): bad bitches like nicki are hard to come by but tracks like this were very easy to come by in 2012

**anothertown** (4): who am i? let's go to the beach beach!..... ninki minjaj

**gannade** (3): the first verse is iconique but everything else is an edm MESS. idk why you twinks keep trying to say this era of overproduced edm mess was the best era of pop because it ISNT

hikkaru: # Pink Friday Roman Reloaded

---

**Overall Average**: 6.907 **// Average Controversy:** 2.022

---

 This album was very much a mixed bag for me, and seemingly all of you too. Many of this very bloated album's songs got cut on the first day, but Nicki also had the most songs remaining going into day 3. There's some real gems but also some less than stellar songs, but unfortunately those gems just weren't enough to pull off the rate win.

---
**radiofan15** (9.857): Am I delusional for giving this album such a high score? Probably... but I can't deny this is one of my favorite albums of the decade so far, easily Top 5. Nicki was SO HUNGRY here, she actually put 100% effort on her craft, and definitely knew how to move seamlessly between genres and styles... I really miss this Nicki, and I will return to stan if she ever decided to take her career seriously again instead of complaining 24/7 and being messy as usual [Score. A+]

**jordannimz** (7.952): Thoughts before listening: I love this album; it's got some major bops (but the Re-Up is even better).

**waluigiest** (7.238): The first album I ever bought was the original Pink Friday. I heard “Bottoms Up” on the radio and IMMEDIATELY felt something stir inside of me. I think it turned me gay and Nicki was the first artist I truly stanned. This album came out several years later and I remember waiting for every new single to drop. With age, it has both some highlights and lowlights of her career.

**skargardin** (7.119): while I do think that Roman Reloaded is a good pop album it clearly needed to be cut short of a few songs. There were some true stinkers on it as well and some absolute classiques. An uneven album but you can't help but love nearly everything about it. This is one of my go-to albums when i just want to have a good time and listen to some admittedly trashy pop.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.086): Wow was it long. It’s almost gluttonously long, I’m glad we didn’t rate the Re-Up because that would have been way too much. I remember listening to this and liking it when I was younger (by which I mean a year ago) but more than the other two albums it’s aged.

**agentofscranton** (7.071): this album has no business being as long as it is, fully considered just not doing the rate about 10 songs in because I was just kinda over it, luckily the poppier back half really saved it for me

**selegend** (7.048): half amazing, half filler but i had a hard time picking an 11 from this album

**jexan13** (6.857): From the 3 albums of this rate, I was entirely convinced this was going to be my favorite. I mean, I loved The Pinkprint and Queen, and this is regarded by some fans as Nicki's peak. Turns out it was the worst of the rate, by far. It's unwieldly long, the productions of many songs is tragically dated and, excluding some gems, everything sounds samey.

**slimboyfriend** (6.714): I know y’all hate rap music, but if you all rate ANY of the songs on the first half of this album below some of the steaming garbage on this album’s last half… y’all seriously need to douche your ears

**gannade** (6.381): its amazing how different the quality is between the first and second half

**TragicKingdom1** (5.786): Firmly falls into the category of "electropop hell" but honestly there's a certain charm to how dated it is. The hooks are generally there and there's some genuinely inventive production. However, that's all held back by Nicki being terrible as both a rapper and a singer. I really wish some of these songs ended up in someone else's hands. [Grade: C+]

And so Kesha wins after all... She dominated day 1, but fell hard on day 2. However, this was the one song that even her haters still seemed to enjoy - it's absolutely euphoric in how it builds and how it just feels like the happiest song I've ever heard. It's classic Kesha in its description of a hookup with lines like "sipping on a warm Budweiser/feeling like a sabretooth tiger", but also sees her embracing something bright and fun and nostalgic in a way. This song was done absolutely DIRTY on the charts, not even making the top 20 and ending Kesha's long streak of top 10 hits, but thankfully you all were here to do it justice in the rate!

---

**ImADudeDuh** (11): God. This song is so. much. fun. She does the party girl role so well and this song is the closest my introverted ass will ever come to being a party icon.

**nooodisaster** (11): The masterpiece of this entire piece, and the GP will be forever fat for paying it dust.

**skargardin** (11): Production, vocals, pure joy.. this song has got it ALL and the way it explodes and climaxes to the final chrous.. scalps me every single time

**vhqv1997** (11): This sounds like a Carly song and the videos look like Carly videos too

**1998tweety** (10): I will not be mad when this wins, it's such a good song.

**anothertown** (10): oh whats this we have here? a banger in a major key, giving hope to the children of this world

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This was one of the first pop songs I really fell in love with and the one that convinced me to give Kesha a chance. The song feels so wrong but so right, it should annoy the annoy the hell out of me but it’s so charming in its stupid earnestness that it just makes me smile. It’s good clean fun, too silly to be truly obnoxious.

**jexan13** (10): I love the delivery, the catchiness, the vocals, the bridge. The dated EDM was not strong enough to drag this song down. I see no flaws.

**lilguavachan** (10): i'm getting emotional of this too what the fuck is wrong with me..... i hate nostalgia

**rickikardashian** (10): Kesha has this charm that makes you fall in love with the messy trashy persona she put on the world. She sang about actions that being 100% real were irresponsible and borderline illegal, but sold it in a way that made them sound as the best things you could do. This song showcases that ability perfectly. The only thing I want to do listening to this song is follow up on the messy adventure she has in store, be it stealing some shit from 7/11, or getting shitfaced drunk in the middle of a random dessert with some dudes you found on a gas station. C'Mon is complete pure dumb fun, and the only reason it's not getting my 11 is because of another song of hers that is slightly more amazing than this.

**selegend** (10): my fav ketchup song

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): i actually like this better than Die Young is that controversial

**TCHALLA1966** (10): wow what a bop, I totally forgot this song existed.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): A carefree, fun bop!

**radiofan15** (9.1): She's serving trashy realness in here... bit I can't deny when a bop is in front of me

**ditacarlita** (9): better than the lead single, a catchy chorus and the bridge/pre chorus with all the rhyming and the sabre tooth tiggggrrrr is way cute!! I DONT WANT TO GO TO SLEEP, I WANNA STAY UP ALL NIGHT! this seems like a natural progression for Kesha, it's cute and silly but feels more mature.

**jordannimz** (9): this song is just so happy and fun. Pure bubblegum pop and I don’t mind. “Feeling like a sabertooth tigrrrrr/Sipping on a warm Budweiser.” I love it.

**waluigiest** (9): kesha invented grindr

**slimboyfriend** (8): Classic pre-Rainbow Kesha exploring the magic of a good hook up

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): I hated this song when it was on the radio & expected to give it a low rating but revisiting it for these rankings that prechorus hits like a rediscovered blast of a type of kesha song i miss.

**fxsparrow** (6): Come onnn!

hikkaru: # Warrior

---

**Overall Average**: 7.386 **// Average Controversy:** 1.951

---

 This is one of my favourite albums ever, and the big reason why I wanted to host this rate in the first place. It's pretty much exactly what I love about Kesha with its blend of electronic bangers and more rock leaning cuts. In my opinion it deservedly has the highest average of the three albums and ended up with the winning song. It definitely has its detractors though, with some of the averages being quite low, so it's definitely not for everyone.

---
**jordannimz** (8.813): Thoughts before listening: Listen I already know I love this album and I feel like this is one of the first albums I ever streamed... Have I really been streaming music since 2012???

**radiofan15** (8.475): TBH I wasn't expecting to like this album as much as I did given its background... but I should have never underestimated Miss Sebert who always delivers [Score: B+]

**skargardin** (8.313): An album full of pure bops, some of these tracks are actual perfection. It's a shame that the surrounding circumstances overshadow this album. And while he-who-shall-not-be-named's involvement in this album is unfortunate you can't deny that this is some top tier pop music.

**nooodisaster** (8.156): Kesha really doesn't mess around with her albums, and this is no exception. A pretty brilliant body of work that was unfortunately paid dust. Also I'll just put it here: Dr. Luke can literally lick the shit off my asshole. With that out of the way, I'm gonna rate this album as objectively as possible.

**rickikardashian** (7.938): This album was a very nice surprise, considering that I only had heard Die Young, C'mon and Crazy Kids, which I liked, but it made me come here expecting a EDM filled banger album, which in part it is, but I didn't expect at all to see some Rock/Folk songs in it, that were even better than the more electronic sounding songs. This album weirdly bridges her Animal/Cannibal era and her Rainbow one. Easily the best album of the rate

**TragicKingdom1** (7.875): This holds up significantly better than the other albums in the rate. It's built on the same EDM/pop foundation but with a much more polished and consistent aesthetic. There really aren't any outright bad songs here, but I do think a consistent problem is that Kesha seems a bit lost here-- the excess of every element diminishes her personality which shined through in her debut era. [Grade: B+]

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.862): My favorite Kesha album, and one of my favorite albums of the 2010s. I don’t think Kesha really got enough credit for how she explored the dark underbelly of 2010s party culture. Everything is so trashy and soaked in booze but there’s this underpinning of fear and explosion of love lurking underneath and she exposed both so beautifully.

**jexan13** (7.813): I always wanted to get into Ke$ha, so I was excited when I saw this rate and her inclusion. From the three, I think it was the most cohesive and had a consistent quality all the way throught. But... Goddamn, 2012 EDM truly aged poorly. Ke$ha vocals and personality really saved many songs.

**waluigiest** (7.438): This album is sort of awkward. At the time she was an artist who was really pigeonholed into shallow, party pop and this is about half of a step away from that. Some of the tracks succeed because they're fun and well-produced like her first album, and some of the tracks succeed because they move away from that. But most of them sit in this limbo where they use less shallow but interesting writing over less interesting beats. She nails this development on a few songs but a lot is just unfortunately clumsy.

**selegend** (4.875): sounds like britney jean mostly
