For me, this is where the album takes a bit of a dip. I love Nicki's bombastic and unique style of rapping when she's alone on a track but when she enlists male rappers to come do a verse for her (or in this case two) it's just kinda tiring and not what I'm looking for in one of her songs. Very mid.

---

**awhile2** (10): suck a big dick god damn

**radiofan15** (10): I can't believe Nicki invented Hit Boy, and that he peaked with this song.. also Rick Ross is so underrated in this song

**1998tweety** (9): The features drag this down a bit but Nicki went oof

**zaminizjammin** (9): - The beat so bouncy I almost fell off.

**jordannimz** (8): she's got a good flow on her verse, and Cam'ron's verse slaps! Also, I have never seen this video before, and it is so good? The bathtub scene is stunning!!

**lady\_sable** (8): she's our leader now ig

**lilguavachan** (8): while i did love nicki's parts, every time it switched to rick ross or cam'ron i just wished we had more nicki

**TCHALLA1966** (8): SUCK A BIG D I C K

**nooodisaster** (7.9): GREAT production, fierce raps, and a perfect short chorus. But we have to deal with.... male rappers. D:

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This slaps for sure

**skargardin** (7.5): cam'ron went off

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): ok good song but i can't stand Rick Ross' voice which ruins it for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.8): Eh, “Come On A Cone” did basically the same thing but better. Also sucking a dick is fun Nicki.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): anyways...

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Cam and Ross are the best parts of this song

**waluigiest** (6): the raps here are fine but nothing exceptional. Nicki and Street Fighter, name a more iconic duo. “Hit up Hot Topic, Nicki Minaj hoodies” came for my 15 year old neck

**anothertown** (5): guest verses are ok

**gateway2glimmer** (5): I actually enjoy it while I'm listening to the album, but I can never get myself to remember its existence otherwise.

**lilacsweetener** (5): It's amazing how her production style has aged already, she embodied the early 2010s sound.

**agentofscranton** (4.5): stream i am yuor leder by necki menij

**ditacarlita** (4): filler

**fxsparrow** (4): Ok..

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): who the fuck is cam'ron

**EuroBish** (3): She could replace stalin with this 1-2-3 punch to the gulag she's doing here

**rickikardashian** (3): these points are only because of Cam'rons verse, and because I did chuckle at "Nicki Denim, Nicki Linen"

**jexan13** (0): It has a boring beat and the hook is seriously horrible.

It's kinda funny that THIS of all songs has not only been rated more than once, but has been rated in BOTH rates that I've hosted. In hindsight there's probably something that could have replaced this in the EDM rate, but tbh it's still a BOP and I will stand by that. Lots might think it's too noisy and obnoxious (especially in the drop) but this is my favourite song on the album honestly. I'm happy to see it make day 2 here, after it was the second boot of the EDM rate. I would have had it higher, but I'll take what I can get.

---

**JunkyGS** (10): BANGER BANGER BANGER

**radiofan15** (10): Rihanna and David have created nothing but gold on their collaborations so far... they should work together more often

**skargardin** (10): What a goddamned banger

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I don’t care if it’s dated it slaps.

**jordannimz** (9): such a bop, but I wish there were more harmonies, other than in the bridge.

**1998tweety** (8): It's a generic David Guetta song and yet it's on the higher end for this album.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): its ok but still a david guetta track, but not bad.

**Sliemy** (8): Far too overhated, it was a cute bop, and honestly outsold Lost In Paradise d@m.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): good song but the drop could be better it just sounds so jarring

**TCHALLA1966** (7.5): shes no who’s that chick but its cute

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): that drop is………….. a choice

**ditacarlita** (7): get me on a dance floor amongst sweaty people, the music breakdown after the chorus is a bit jarring but doesn't completely ruin the song

**waluigiest** (7): this is really fun, but it doesn’t have much character

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): All of the women in this rate have done a “we are young” style song and I think Rihanna’s is the worst, it’s kind of obnoxious. I like the bridge though.

**vhqv1997** (6.5): Finally a song with actual lyrics, too bad it is still mediocre

**rickikardashian** (6.3): very dated but it bangs hard

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): generic EDM jam. always nice to hear but everyone involved has done better

**fxsparrow** (6): chorus is good

**nooodisaster** (6): mild grooves.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): i actually like everything except the drop tbh...but yikes it does NOT work at all

**awhile2** (4): this is like the one weak spot on unapologetic i just want to forget about wtf happend to guetta dude used to ebe good like whos that chick is fire

**mayolizard** (4): meh

**letsallpoo** (3): this is the second time hikkaru has hosted a rate with this song. why?

**selegend** (3): would be amazing without that awful awful drop that just makes the song unlistenable

**gannade** (2): david guetta has questionable amounts of talent

**lilguavachan** (1): listen i know this is when rihanna was making an album every year but she really could've put more effort into this

Coming off of Roman Holiday, Come On A Cone seems to follow suit with the theatrical style of rapping with some absolute choices in terms of lyricism and delivery, but it's hard to deny that Nicki makes an impact in this song - "DICK IN YOUR FACE" is truly a statement, but it comes down to whether or not you like that... I can definitely see how this song is less palatable than the one preceding it. I'm still gagged at the fact that Pitchfork put this in their top 200 songs of the DECADE.

---

**anothertown** (10): highly slept on.. the synths are so good when they layer in the chorus like what the fuck

**awhile2** (10): man wtf is nicki on that makes her come up with such iconic hooks like this. like no one else comes up with shit like this nickis the goat and im doing this rae kind of drunk but i love nicki

**gannade** (10): nicki really did this for the first like 7 songs on her album and then made the entire other half

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Probably my favorite song on the album, I love her lyrics here. It’s got the craziness of “Roman Holiday” but in a contained way where it’s focused but we can still see it bubbling beneath the surface.

**radiofan15** (10): "When I'm sitting with Anna, I'm really sitting with Anna, ain't a metaphor punchline, I'm really sitting with Anna!!" is one of the best lines of Nicki's career and no one can convince me otherwise... also she's serving vocals when singing the "DICK IN YOUR FACE" portion of the song... also also, Lil Kim deserved

**williamdowley123** (10): yeah HYUH

**1998tweety** (9): I feel anxiety while listening to this, the good kind.

**lilacsweetener** (9): This fucking SLAPS (even when rhyming Ellen with winning)

**lilguavachan** (8.5): re-listening to this album makes me so... nostalgic for some reason. i don't know why it's hitting me on this dumb ass song in particular but whatever

**nooodisaster** (8.5): One of the best pure-rap songs on the record. Nice flow, clever lines, decent chorus. And of course, the famous and infamous DICK IN YO FACE break for the history books.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): "put my diiick in your faaace" is the counterpoint to this album's "you're a stuuuUUUUUpid hoEEEEEEEE"

**gateway2glimmer** (8): Cocky, OTT Nicki is the best Nicki.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): ok i SCREAMED at the dick in your face part

**skargardin** (8): the poetry of it all...

**ignitethephoenix** (7): “ohhhhh, Dick in your faceeeee, put my dick in your face” actually iconic

**jordannimz** (7): I̶ ̶l̶i̶k̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶b̶e̶a̶t̶,̶ ̶I̶ ̶d̶o̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶l̶o̶v̶e̶ ̶h̶e̶r̶ ̶f̶l̶o̶w̶ ̶o̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶h̶o̶r̶u̶s̶,̶ ̶b̶u̶t̶ ̶I̶ ̶d̶o̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶h̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶o̶v̶e̶r̶a̶l̶l̶.̶ Actually I listened again and it really grew on me? Still not my favourite, but's pretty good actually 🤷🏼‍♂️

**lady\_sable** (7): "dick in your face" brought this up by a whole two points

**vhqv1997** (7): I want to make a joke about that line but the punchline is already there

**waluigiest** (7): a fun boast track. It’s got some excellent bars (“and I’m not masturbating but I’m feeling myself” YEARS before the iconic Feeling Myself??) and some terrible bars (“when you see me on Ellen just admit that I’m winning). Also the DICK IN YOUR FACE... huge

**fxsparrow** (6): uh..!

**selegend** (6): this feels 10 minutes long but DIIICK IN YOUR FACE is iconique

**static\_int\_husp** (3): I guess I kind of get what she's trying to do here but it does not work at all for me

**DrunkHurricane** (0): when I heard this song I thought there was no way you could defend this, so finding out this is one of the most critically acclaimed songs on the album was… a surprise, to say the least

**EuroBish** (0): disgraceful

**rickikardashian** (0): she rhymed face with face, and the second phrase was "dick in your face". someone please try to justify this

This is probably my least favourite deluxe track from Warrior, but it's still a banger. It covers a lot of the same ground that we've seen elsewhere on the album, namely the EDM production backing somewhat dark lyrics about how everyone is going to die so we should party. I'm actually kinda surprised that this made it do day 2, especially over Wherever You Are, but I'm content with it.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the way kesha's album kinda stomps the other two

**skargardin** (10): imagine not bopping your ass of to this song, immaculate bawp

**1998tweety** (9.5): This is one of the songs on the album that best captures the sound of this era of music.

**jordannimz** (9): yet another nihilistic song, but I’m not complaining… it feels just as relevant In 2019. The production is sooooo good, and yet another amazing breakdown. My only complaint is that the autotune is very apparent in this song, but hey the melody is good.

**nooodisaster** (9): The darkest song on the album, while also somehow being extremely life affirming?? Idk y'all, but this is a MOOD.

**radiofan15** (8.7): Damn, this is like a Britney Jean with cliché lyrics but like actually good

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I remember when I was a kid my sister told me that everybody was partying because the world was ending and that was making it end faster and that scarred me. This song is borderline scary.

**rickikardashian** (6.7): Kesha touches the "dying young" and "living like is your last day" topic so much Im just 100% she probably thought she was just going to end up ODing one day and she was at peace with that

**TCHALLA1966** (6.4): I could see me getting into this back in 2012 but right now eh

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I feel like topic of partying until you die has been played out too much by the point in the album

**slimboyfriend** (5): oh thank God Kesha stopped making generic EDM

**fxsparrow** (4.5): I got out alive!

**selegend** (4): i used to stan this but now i realize it’s shit lol

**waluigiest** (3): dated, unoriginal. When writing, production, and melody are all so meh on a kesha song it just doesn’t work

**gannade** (1): my ears after listening to this song

I actually quite like this song, the harsher electronic backing compliments Nicki really well I feel. Of this stretch of the album, it's my highest score, and it's nice to see it make day 2! Queen of driving, Charli is shook. This and Come On A Cone deserved better!

---

**radiofan15** (9.8): Is this where the whole "bitches is my son" thing came from?

**1998tweety** (9): Nintendo...we love a gamer queen

**gateway2glimmer** (9): A clever, strong diss track.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): its H O V

**nooodisaster** (9): My fav rap song of the album. She spits furious bars on this and sounds like a fucking queen doing it.

**waluigiest** (9): I made my dad play this when we were driving on a road trip and I felt like such a bad bitch

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Of the pure rap songs on this album this is one of my favorites, her lyrics are good and I think she sits really well in the production here.

**jexan13** (8): Why does this remind me of Final Fantasy battle themes?

**jordannimz** (8): catchy chorus, feels a little dated now, but it still slaps though. The 3rd verse/bridge is great!

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): is it possible to listen to this without bopping your head along to it???

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): when Nicki sees Soul Train she FLOORS IT

I'm actually surprised this made it to day 2, it does seem like it could blend in with some of the other songs from this album, but I'm okay with it making it this far because it's pretty good, especially for a deluxe track. But I think that overall, we've really seen enough from Rih and Nicki...

---

**1998tweety** (9): Dude's comment for this made me SCREAM, honestly makes me like the song even more.

**jordannimz** (9): I love this song; it's such a good power ballad, and I think it totally could have been a single. And when she goes up the octave for the chorus???? And riffs??? Amazing!! And the organ 😍

**lilacsweetener** (8): Underrated! Would like to hear more singers address this topic.

**Sliemy** (8): Deserved to be the last song on the standard release, it's actually a really cute closer and works even better when you think of it as set-up for Anti, listening back-to-back.

**vhqv1997** (8): Hmm, why does this sound a bit like Next To Me by Emeli Sandé? That's interesting, the song is good but the melody sounds like... oh, it's written by Emeli Sandé...

**waluigiest** (8): queen of being humble with fame

**skargardin** (7.5): pretty good but i feel like it didn't really pop off the way it could've

**anothertown** (7): i like the part where she goes ooOooh YOU KNOW ME

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I like the idea of this song, especially given Rihanna’s image at the time, but the lyrics leave a little something to be desired.

**nooodisaster** (7): Nice emotional delivery, but I'm so tired of album's closing with a song basically going "you don't know me." Bitch, isn't that what your album is for????

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): not a groundbreaking song but its a nice closer

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): honestly i’ve never cared much for songs that are all about how “i’m famous so you won’t ever truly know me” but at least this one sounds really pretty & Rih sounds good singing it

**ditacarlita** (6): cute but I can see why it's a bonus track

**ignitethephoenix** (6): generic and tries a little to hard

**radiofan15** (5.6): It needs that something to push it out of bland generic filler territory... maybe something like settle at either being a Someone Like You clone or a dubstep ballad

**selegend** (5): half the effort gets half the points

**TragicKingdom1** (4): why does this end so awkwardly

**ImADudeDuh** (3): Is this a deleted song from Hannah Montana where she makes a song about her double life that is very obviously showing she has a double life yet no one bothers trying to figure out who she is.

This song is one of the more controversial Warrior songs, and there's pretty much one reason why: Iggy Pop. His verse is even more trashy than Kesha gets on the entirety of the album, talking about where various people/things have sex including less than tasteful lines about cockroaches and rug merchants. It doesn't ruin the song for me and I still think it's an absolute bop with an AMAZING chorus, but I'd definitely prefer a solo version (the music video version doesn't really count bc it's a demo with horrible mixing). Glad to see it make it to day 2, though.

---

**EuroBish** (10): Incredible, one of very few songs on the album that show an authentic (and better) Kesha

**gateway2glimmer** (10): Rock-dance Kesha is brilliant, and I LOVE that she did more of this on Rainbow. Kesha's voice and energy are perfect for this style of music.

**lady\_sable** (10): oh this SLAPS

**lilguavachan** (10): as much as i love kesha's silly EDM pop songs... i love a good fun kesha rock song

**jordannimz** (9): such a jam. I mean, who would have ever thought of putting Kesha and Iggy Pop on the same track, especially back in 2012, but it totally works. The guitars are so good, the chords in the chorus, and her scream in the intro????? The only part I don’t love is the bridge.

**lilacsweetener** (9): Should've been a single.

**TCHALLA1966** (8.9): serving church choir shouting to the rooftops I JUST WANT YOUR DIRTY LOVE her mind.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): marie kondo i love mess .mp4

**1998tweety** (8): This is a song that I want to dislike, but they work too well together and they sell it so it gets points for that.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): they compliment each other so well

**radiofan15** (7.6): Even with Iggy Pop in here, this song can't break the stigma of sounding like it belongs on a commercial...

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I like this song but idk why Iggy Pop's vocals sound like he's the host of a Nickelodeon after school special in his verse

**ditacarlita** (7): a catchy album track! champagne tastes like piss to me!

**fxsparrow** (7): Iggy pop is uh..! Something

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I have a soft spot for this song even if objectively it’s kind of trash. “Only Wanna Dance With You” does basically the same thing sonically but is cuter.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): There’s definitely flashes of Rainbow Kesha here but overall the song isn’t it for me

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): what even is iggy pop's verse actually

**waluigiest** (7): much to think about here,,

**skargardin** (6): Weak hook and i'm not that big on Iggy's contribution to this track

**jackisboredtoday** (5.2): This works until Iggy Pop’s verse comes in and then it just derails for me

**awhile2** (5): i love iggy pop but he is absolute ass on this song

**anothertown** (4): this instrumental sounds like a tj maxx commercial

**mayolizard** (3): skip!

**gannade** (1): this is so fucking awful, and that afghanistan line?? yikes.

The deluxe tracks from Warrior are all VERY good in my opinion, including this one. Here, Kesha dips into some folk influence while still keeping the electronic production (folktronica) which is a very interesting blend of the two sides of Warrior and a bridge between what was expected of Kesha and where she herself wanted to go. The song is a cute ode to a past relationship that will not work out and should be left in the past, and the sonics of it work perfectly for the vibe. I would have like for it to make top 20, but I'm content that it at least made day 2.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (9): now this is genre bending

**skargardin** (9): Will probably get robbed :sadgery:

**1998tweety** (8.5): Filler but bop filler.

**jordannimz** (8): my favourite part is the gang vocals in the “na na na na na na na na” part, but overall the melody is so well-done.

**ditacarlita** (7): sweet

**waluigiest** (7): A theme that’s been done a million times (I never thought I would stop loving this person) but it still hits

**nooodisaster** (6): i never vibed w this song, srry.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): There’s a good song in here somewhere but it’s being drowned out by production that doesn’t have any of the fun of early kesha or the power of later kesha

**radiofan15** (5.9): Not even deserving of bonus track status

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): “When I was broke/You bought me shoes” :’)

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): i remember thinking this was filler when i was 12... my mind!

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I think the biggest problem with *Warrior* is that after a point it starts to feel repetitive. Like, sonically some of the songs tread very similar ground, this is cute but it sounds like a mashup of the themes/sounds of like four other songs on the album.

**williamdowley123** (4): why is the breathing so loud in this album

**fxsparrow** (3): once the song ended I didn't "remember" it

This is one of the few meh cuts from Warrior for me, but sees Kesha tap into a sonic area that she'd explore more in Rainbow. It's cute, but definitely gets a bit boring for me and leans towards skip territory for me. I would have had this out day 1 probably tbh.

---

**gannade** (10): im honestly so surprised. keshas edm songs on this album are AWFUL but then she is also capable of doing songs like these.

**jexan13** (10): This song brings me so much peace.

**lilguavachan** (9.5): things we don't give kesha props for: good ballads! i guess if i had one critique, i wish it wasn't so... clean and polished? i want a good ole nasty sloppy ballad that i know she can deliver.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Im so comfy

**radiofan15** (8.6): We love introspective ballads

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): the song on this album that gives the clearest preview of the kesha we heard on rainbow, and a song that stands out on the album more nowadays, as its wishes to go back seem even more heartbreaking with context

**megm26** (8.3): songs about not wanting to grow up always make me emo :(

**rickikardashian** (8.3): I honestly had never listened to a full Kesha album before Rainbow, so I'm pleasently surprised that she had already dived a bit into this type of rocky/country-ish music before. It still matched very well with the messy drunk party girl image she kept for a while, but it feels very heartfelt and nostalgic

**1998tweety** (8): This is cute

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I wish she did more songs like this around this era

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.8): This is like “Wherever You Are” with pathos rather than euphoria, it’s such a sweet little tribute to her past. It takes on a decidedly more morbid tone given everything that’s come out about Kesha’s life but just as a song it’s always moved me.

**TCHALLA1966** (7.7): she’s really cute

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): This song sounds like a 2007-soft-rock-girl demo

**skargardin** (6.5): cute but kinda forgettable

**ditacarlita** (6): i've heard better ballads from kesha

**jordannimz** (6): I like the lyrics, but the melody and production aren’t my favourite. Although I do love the organ in the chorus 😊

**waluigiest** (6): she almost had something thoughtful and touching, but it’s so full of air

**vhqv1997** (5): Kesha can do good ballads, we all know she could, since Praying won a rate, and she has been doing good ballads from her very first album, but this was not one of them, this just feels very underbaked, like all the elements are there, but the finished product was clearly not taken care of and polished.

**anothertown** (3): ick

This song is really unique on this album, being an acoustic ballad that really sticks out against the bombast of pretty much the entirety of the rest of the album. It's really good though, and proves Kesha's versatility across various genre/styles of music. I didn't expect it to make it to day 3, but I also didn't really expect it to do as well as it did so I'm glad to see it as a mid-day 2 boot.

---

**agentofscranton** (11): this won't win but this is my favourite song in kesha's entire discography - so effortlessly gorgeous. It's the sound that I wanted from Rainbow and I always revisit it when I'm in a sour mood cause it's just so wholesome and uplifting.

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): This is THE Kesha song for me, I love this song so much. It’s so gentle and sweet, I don’t believe in soulmates or whatever but it’s such a lovely sentiment. Two people falling through time towards each other, shaping history just so they can be together, it’s a beautiful idea. Kesha loves this idea so much she resisted it on “Finding You” on *Rainbow*, another great song.

**jordannimz** (10): a great closer. Kinda giving me Rainbow vibes, just 5 years beforehand. Super sweet lyrics, and I love the production; it feels simple but it’s actually kinda complex. Again, I’m loving the male vocals singing with her. It’s just a beautiful song. And the outro is gorgeous.

**lilguavachan** (10): fuck i love this song

**nooodisaster** (10): So warm and cozy. Ugghh, I love this one so much.

**radiofan15** (9.5): Damn, I can't believe a Kesha song nearly made me cry... but she almost did it

**vhqv1997** (9): I feel like Kesha is the only one who sings about this subject, she also has another song about this if I remember correctly, it's called Finding You, I think. I think, earnestly, she's a true romantic at heart, and despite all the songs about partying and pissing off other people, she really loves a lot and has lot of love to give, and it's not a side that comes out often but makes her so much more interesting.

**waluigiest** (9): okay so here comes Sappho to kill me instantly on the last track. Rude.

**1998tweety** (8.5): A good closer

**ImADudeDuh** (8): we love kesha

**anothertown** (7.5): it's nice but i think it could have done without the strings, makes it sound too sappy!

**skargardin** (7.5): cute but it had the potential to be something more, it feels kinda repetetive

**ditacarlita** (7): a nice ballad from keshush

**ignitethephoenix** (7): if Kesha talks about galaxies one more time...

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): queen of having multiple wives over her numerous lives

**fxsparrow** (6): this is so soothing.Perfect for a closing track

**passionfruits2** (3): as Tove Lo said, "Glad He's Gone", all I have to say about this album

This is a cute song, it's more interesting than the other electropop songs on the album but does not reach the heights of Starships/Pound The Alarm/Whip It/Va Va Voom. As such, it made day 2 and is deserving of that position, but shouldn't really be any higher imo.

---

**radiofan15** (9.8): This song makes me embrace my inner hoe!

**jordannimz** (8): the chorus has a good melody, and I love the production. Feels a little generic, but it's definitely good; I don't mind. The verses are pretty good too.

**1998tweety** (7.5): It's ok, kind of redundant at this point.

**skargardin** (7.5): Bop but something about it feels unfinished, like it needed more refinement

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): this has some of the more forgettable verses that nicki’s ever done, but that chorus!!! you can really tell this was a max martin track

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): What a weird choice of an ending track. God this album was long.

**selegend** (7): oh wow this is good

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): tbh va va voom should've be the closer but anyway

**ditacarlita** (6): thank god that album's over

**LiberalMusicLover** (6): I remember hearing this song in Adidas commercials and it's fun and whimsical. Should've been on the standard version of the album.

**nooodisaster** (6): masc-querade: aka logging onto Grindr

**waluigiest** (6): the phantom of the opera flopped !

**anothertown** (5): it sounds like aly and aj are singing the chorus

This SLAPS. It's my 11, and I know that it is an unorthodox choice, but it's definitely my favourite song on the album and one of my absolute favourite Kesha songs. It's a staple of my running playlist, so maybe it's stockholm syndrome, but I absolutely ADORE the energy it has, both in Kesha's delivery and its production. The breakdown after the second verse is absolutely amazing - as much as a piece of garbage he is, Dr. Puke knew how to do EDM pop. I'm upset that it didn't manage to break into the top 20, but not surprised at all. Kesha DOES have a lot of songs that cover the same ground as this one, which, if you aren't a fan of the song's other aspects, can be quite tiring. But still, I'll forever love this song, an absolute bop.

---

**awhile2** (10): the bass on here fucking slapsss

**ImADudeDuh** (10): she can get very annoying but idk it's kinda endearing to me. It's like the reason why I like Stupid Hoe. Omg this fucking drop shook me, never mind this is a 10.

**lilguavachan** (10): kim petras wishes she could make a song as good as this

**radiofan15** (10): DAMN Kesha the production in here, you and Dr. Luke snapped... you two should be back together to make a new album

**gateway2glimmer** (9): Kesha's energy is the best in the game. What a great way to start an album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Kesha albums always have great anthems as title tracks and this album is no exception. The drop should feel dated but it’s “subdued” enough to still sound good, and Kesha takes no prisoners with her vocals here. I love the “call to arms” feel of the track, it’s easy to write off Kesha’s party girl persona as pandering and empty but it’s clear on songs like this that she always had a strong idea of who she was speaking to with this music and she had a lot of fondness/respect for them.

**lady\_sable** (9): in the good timeline this was a single

**skargardin** (8.5): Don't come for me, I love nearly every part of Warrior except for the bridge, some wig-snatching vocals could've been added in its place

**jordannimz** (8): such a good opener, the bass in the second verse, the positive lyrics, the BREAKDOWN in the bridge, especially those 3 notes of bass guitar???? So good.

**nooodisaster** (8): A great opener. I love her growls and screams and the over the top anthemic lyrics of acceptance.

**waluigiest** (8): this really sounds like it would fit in on her first two projects, it’s a fun wet bop

**1998tweety** (7.5): Feels like it drags a bit, but it still bops a little.

**ditacarlita** (7): this had potential to score higher but I brought the score down because i don't like the verses as much as the bridge and "warrior" chanting

**ignitethephoenix** (7): A little to obnoxious for me

**anothertown** (6): i hate "warrioriorierrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr" but i like the little scream after that. hmm

**TCHALLA1966** (6): a cute opener I think

**vhqv1997** (6): I'm so fucking tired of that distortion edm drop, I'm so glad we're past that period now.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): There are so many better early 2010s self-empowerment anthems, one of which was made by Kesha herself

**fxsparrow** (4): verses- inferior,chorus- savior, nothing is warrior

**selegend** (3): nicki kinda did whatever kesha did much, much better

**gannade** (1): this is definitely a 2012 song. these edm drops are SMELLY

This is one that I'm surprised did as well as it did, making it to the top 20. It's an electropop ballad, something not very unique in this rate, and truthfully I think it's a bit uninteresting at times, as well as being kind of overproduced (which especially sticks out due to it being a ballad). I do love the bridge though, which takes the entire song up a couple points for me. It's a good closer for the standard edition of the album, but the deluxe tracks are all SLAPPERS and Past Lives works even better as a closer imo, so it does lose some of its place on the album in that regard for me. Still, a decent song and deserving of a top 20 position.

---

**lilguavachan** (11): this song always gives me goosebumps. from the drums she sampled from in the air tonight, to the instrumentation, to kesha's layered vocals in the bridge, like everything in this song feels so massive and emotional. like it's so dramatic and i love it...

**gannade** (10): ngl i came into this as a total kesha hater but she really snappt here

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The thesis of *Warrior*, and a really strong one at that. There’s just something so poignant about placing this song at the end of an album devoted to exploring the mindset and motivations of the 21st century youth, it’s like, only now that we really understand her can she impart this important message onto us. It’s like, we as a society really made fun of Kesha during her “Ke$ha” days, but all along there was a human being there who needed our love and support just as much as anyone else. It’s hard for me to put into words because it seems so basic but like, why are we so mean to each other? When did love go out of fashion? There’s so much hate in this world and it feels like a lot of the time even the people who should be friends are fighting each other, and rather than being kind to the people who are different than us we shun them. Anyways, this was a mess but the point is I really like this song, it has beautiful lyrics and gorgeous non-Dr. Luke production,

**jordannimz** (10): again, super positive lyrics that still 100% apply 7 years later. Absolutely beautiful, both in terms of lyrics and production. Also, I love the intro with the drums. The harmonies in the bridge are stunning.

**lilacsweetener** (10): One of her best ever songs. Does it sample In The Air Tonight?

**radiofan15** (10): Kesha really shines in this kind of songs... her vocals soars and the production does a fantastic job complementing her... and she did all of that WITHOUT ANY INPUT OF DR LUKE!

**jexan13** (9.4): The outro is so good

**1998tweety** (9): This is good, she did what she had to do.

**anothertown** (9): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kurstin_production_discography

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): a bit overproduced but i like the bridge a lot

**ImADudeDuh** (8): why is this kinda scary

**nooodisaster** (8): ;_________;

**rickikardashian** (7.9): Okay but THATS A CHORUS AND THATS A BRIDGE. I had not much hope for this song but that chorus elevated it to a whole nother level

**fxsparrow** (7): The song could've been shorter and still be good

**selegend** (7): pretty

**waluigiest** (7): this is trying to do a lot without fully committing, so only some is working

**slimboyfriend** (6): I fall asleep during the verses and suddenly transcend in the chorus

**zaminizjammin** (6): - the second half of this album is flagging for me

**ignitethephoenix** (5): I CAN FEEL IT COMING IN THE AIR T- oh wait wrong song. This is more boring.

**skargardin** (5): hate to say that this song is overproduced

I'm actually REALLY surprised at how this performed in the rate. I thought for sure popheads would dislike it because of its length but it managed to make it to the top 20! It's not my favourite song, but I can definitely see its appeal, especially those that are fans of the balladry on Unapologetic. Good for it!

---

**jexan13** (11): Double songs tend to be hit or miss for me, but this one is just so damn beautiful. The rawness, the sadness and emotion that is transmitted by her voice is so powerful.

**lilacsweetener** (11): Astounding and gargantuan, just keeps escalating to the next level.

**agentofscranton** (10): I fully believe that Mother Mary is the best song Rihanna had ever done

**jackisboredtoday** (10): Rihanna’s most ambitious song at the time of its release, there’s so much to unpack whenever i listen

**jordannimz** (10): I think this has always been my favourite Unapologetic song. I think the two parts really complement each other, and I love the transition between them is perfect. Her vocals are flawless here, and in terms of tracklisting, I feel like it's almost commenting on the previous song with C****, about recognizing that their relationship was toxic even though she still craves it in a way.

**LiberalMusicLover** (10): This song was kind of hard to listen to on first listen... I remember previewing it on iTunes and hearing the rock-esque production and thinking it sounds different from her and when the album dropped, I heard the other half and wow. You can hear the emotion in her voice. She does a great job at making you feel what she's singing, not just listen to it.

**nooodisaster** (10): D:

**Sliemy** (10): Another of the several career highlights for Rihanna on this album, I typically hate if songs are unnecessarily lengthy or songs being combined, but the concept worked flawlessly here, Rih took us to church. One of her most personal songs, it comes across as a reflection of her entire career to this point.

**EuroBish** (9.5): So pretty

**radiofan15** (9.2): We love an ambitious two-parter, they don't make them like this anymore P.S. Hard Feelings/Loveless is cute, but not this cute

**awhile2** (9): this sounds like a police song

**ditacarlita** (9): I have always LOVED this, very moving, rih's voice is incredible

**1998tweety** (8): The predecessor to Hard Feelings / Loveless

**waluigiest** (8): is this beat from the Police??? Beautiful writing but honestly tragic context for her

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This song is immediately striking for the pathos and the unusual structure, but unfortunately a general lack of focus and ending fatigue keep it from delivering on this promise. Still, there’s a lot of good there, and she gets points for trying something different.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Two Marilyn Monroe related songs in the rate...who would have thought

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): both beautiful songs and i want full length versions now

**rickikardashian** (6.7): second song so far that references Marilyn Monroe. Also Genius says this also might be about Chris Brown and I don't think he should ever be compared to James Dean in any way. The interpolation of Part 1 to Part 2 is also quite confusing, I don't really understand why she decided to unite these 2 songs that seem to be very unrelated and don't really compliment each other much, either way, Mother Mary is nice enough to end this on a high note and make me forget the fact that Rihanna really compared human garbage to James Dean

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): She really knows how to construct a narrative, putting this after the song it’s after…

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the transition was iconic but the rest was only ok and overly long

**static\_int\_husp** (6): These two halves don;t really flow together imo

**TragicKingdom1** (6): slightly intriguing but mostly boring

**vhqv1997** (6): This song had a lot of potential, but she absolutely did not make use of it

**anothertown** (5): i hate romanticized marilyn monroe imagery lol

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): this shit 7 minutes long and for what

This song is VERY cute, both in the literal sense but also in that to me, it's one of the slightly lesser tracks on the album. Still very much a bop though, but also a song that feels perfect leaving on day 2. I'd def have a couple other Kesha songs above it though.

---

**gateway2glimmer** (10): I've been listening to this song since this album came out. I will never, ever get tired of it. The lyrics are so sweet and the song itself is full of love and energy.

**nooodisaster** (10): flawless incredible showstopping iconic pop that deserved to be num. 1 for 17 weeks

**waluigiest** (10): FINALLY I really feel like this is what the album needed. The romance inherent in settling down, at least relatively so, is charming. It’s a fun song with good images that call back to her first era (“drinking wine on the cement outside 7/11”) and it’s just excellence on this album

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): I honestly can’t explain why I’ve been OBSESSED with this song for the past 7 years

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I love these dirty love songs kesha does

**lilguavachan** (9): like wonderland, i wish it was a little more messy sounding, but we love a silly love song.

**1998tweety** (8.5): I love the beat on this and the chorus is great.

**jordannimz** (8): honestly my favourite part is the male vocals in the “just wanna dance with you” part. Or the backing vocals in the last chorus. Such a fun song! Makes you want to dance, which is probably the point.

**radiofan15** (8): Monogamy? in a Kesha song from her Dr Luke days? is more likely than you think

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This is a cute little throwback to the pop-rock era, I’m bopping.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): that Strokes sample completely shocked me when it came in but this is a cute lil track

**fxsparrow** (6.5): this is good and the guitar solo is amazing

**ditacarlita** (6): filler and goes no where but it's cute i guess

**skargardin** (6): It's very average

**anothertown** (3): i didnt even want to hear the strokes the first time let alone here

I actually completely forgot this was a single, I guess I never really heard it when it was sent to radios and whatnot. I don't have much feelings about it, but I do appreciate how it manages to take aspects of dubstep/electronic production and mesh it with the power ballad nature of the lyrical delivery. I think that overall it's a fairly mid song though, which is why it is seeing its fall in the middle of day 2.

---

**awhile2** (10): the way rihanna pronounces says mirror turns me on

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): Would easily get my 11 if my favourite Rihanna song was not already in this rate. A severely overlooked classic!

**fxsparrow** (10): Riri with them pipes

**gannade** (10): this is better than right now and thats that on that

**sailormunelune** (10): this is the strongest song on this album

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Mid tempo ballad Rihanna was great on this album

**\_wailordfan** (9): This definitely hit harder when I was a more melodramatic middle schooler.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): oh damn maybe she snapped on the bridge

**skargardin** (9): If this just had a better hook it would be a ten, it is excellent tho

**TCHALLA1966** (9): WHATTTTTNOWWWWW SOMEBODY TELL ME

**waluigiest** (9): HER BELTING OMG

**1998tweety** (8): The bridge on this was pretty good.

**jordannimz** (8): I love the contrast of the piano ballad verses and the hard EDM chorus! Also, at 1:35, there is an error in the vocal, it cuts out for a split-second? I totally forgot about the key-change/guitar solo at the end, but I love it.

**vhqv1997** (7.8): I can't believe it but the only good songs Rihanna has on this album are the ballads. Her vocal power is often underrated and the way it soared here is really awe-inspiring.

**nooodisaster** (7): i..... don't know

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): The verses here are so gorgeous, but that chorus melody throws me off

**slimboyfriend** (6): Ok I know I’ve been trashing the dubstep songs on this album, but I kinda like this chorus

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): mirrawr xD

**gateway2glimmer** (4): I never liked this track very much. It's sounds like it belongs on one of Avril Lavigne's earlier albums.

**TragicKingdom1** (3): one of rihanna's worst singles! the worst part is her hair in the music video though

**radiofan15** (2.6): This... ain't it chief. She just sounds uncomfortable doing this

And so, with day 2 coming to a close, Kesha's first single falls, though I'm not sure if it *really* counts because the album version does not have will.i.am who DEFINITELY ruins the song in every way imaginable. I'm glad that that version was just a remix and, even as a Kesha stan, I'm okay with it flopping. The original song however is MUCH better, and makes me think of a more updated version of Animal era Kesha. It's a bit more trashy and she does more of the white-girl-talk-rap thing. That combined with the music video with her unfortunate choice of hair (the cultural appropriation of it all) isn't the best look at all, but this song still is a bop and I'm glad it did quite well in this rate.

---

**jordannimz** (10): this was my favourite song off this album after my first listen. Not. The Will.i.am version. Besides, the second verse is the best one anyway. Anyway, I love the guitars, whistling, and the bass in the verse. This song made me gay.

**skargardin** (10): the only version that exists

**vhqv1997** (10): The collaboration with will.i.am was probably her worst collaboration yet (aside from the one with, you know, Dr. Luke), but this solo version is amazing, her vocals, her attitude, her lyrics, everything just clicked and blended together so well

**lilguavachan** (9.5): kesha's white woman rapping power is so immense... like literally iggy who?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): will.i.am should pay for his war crimes

**agentofscranton** (9): the version with will.i.am is a 3

**selegend** (9): we stan cultural appropriation!

**radiofan15** (8.7): Does anyone else thinks this song needs some of will.i.am fire verses?

**TCHALLA1966** (8.7): homegirl hating I’m like who she

**fxsparrow** (8.5): Seven years later and this song hasn't lost its spark, not a bit.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Ugh, songwriter of our generation. Taylor Swift who? Lorde what? Kacey Muscy why?

**EuroBish** (8): So refreshing to not hear will.i.am on this one

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This slaps in the club, when it was 2012

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): I actually remember this song playing while all my middle school classmates were seeing each other for the very last time & we were all crying our eyes out together with this in the background

**rickikardashian** (7.5): +0.5 because this version doesn't have Will.I.Am

**1998tweety** (7): Ke$ha please don't say coochie

**ditacarlita** (7): again had potential to score higher but like warrior the verses aren't as good as the chorus.

**lilacsweetener** (7): It's all about the raps.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): the bassline goes so hard

**TragicKingdom1** (7): feels empty without a guest rapper

**waluigiest** (7): Adele was taking notes !

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): A lot of the songs on this album teeter on the edge of being annoying and I think this one verges the furthest into that territory. It just feels kind of rushed and the rapped chorus is too stupid for me to like.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): kesha saying coochie makes me uncomfortable

**jexan13** (6): This song was a 10 until the first chorus ended. I feel the verses really don't fit with the rest of the song.

**letsallpoo** (6): the pitbull remix is the best version

**LiberalMusicLover** (6): A fun song, but the will.i.am remix wasn't needed.

**gannade** (5): this is 100% honestly a totally bop and a guilty pleasure but i have to give it a 5 for the cultural appropriation in the MV. so tacky

**anothertown** (0): this one's going in my cringe compilation

This is a trashy BOP, but in a different way than this era of Kesha usually is. This leans more into country-rock like something you'd find on Rainbow but it still has that 100% early 2010s Kesha feel to it, in that its unabashedly fun, trashy, and emasculating. It feels like this is the kind of area Kesha wanted Warrior to go as a whole, also seen in songs like Dirty Love and Thinking of You, and while I do love what we got it would have been great to see more like this. Very glad that it did quite well here, because I could see this being somewhat polarizing.

---

**TragicKingdom1** (11): this song makes me wanna have sex in my car

**1998tweety** (10): YASS what a BOP. It's dumb but also extremely fun.

**awhile2** (10): this song is simultaneously trash and also the best thing ive ever hears

**Saucymac** (10): lmao this song is trash I love it

**lady\_sable** (9.5): oh she did that

**ditacarlita** (9): this song literally fucking rocks

**jordannimz** (9): this song is so much fun — I mean a country-rock-pop song about a gold car that’s actually about sex — what’s not to love? It’s such a jam!

**lilguavachan** (9): queen of fucking in her car

**rickikardashian** (9): this is so shamelessly trashy that I can't take it seriously. I straight up adore this song. It's the kind of song that you listen to ironically until you actually adore it. Brb going to buy an old van and going to fuck some random dude I pick up the highway

**vhqv1997** (9): Holy goddamn shit this song is hilarious, the imagery is both so disgusting and fun, which is basically Kesha's brand. I know she no longer does shit like this but it's so entertaining to hear and sing along to, oh how I miss this Kesha.

**waluigiest** (9): kesha can step on my throat

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I never wanted a modern Def Leppard/ZZ Top mashup, but Kesha worked it on this song

**skargardin** (8): The boppage of it all, makes me feel like a ho

sweetnsoursauce1: Alright what’s everyone’s predictions for top 5? 


I think Starships and Diamonds are definitely in there, and most likely C’mon. I’d love to see Thinking Of You in there as well but is a non single likely???

sweetnsoursauce1: Diamonds is my 11 so biased but I really hope C’Mon is top three, one of her best imo

yatcho: Va Va Voom should really be in there. No non-single will be in there

rickikardashian: cant wait till Stupid Hoe wins the whole thing because half the scores are ironic 10s, and the other are unironic 10s
