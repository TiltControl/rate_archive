2012 Ultimate Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/cysicn/2012_ultimate_rate/

The year in which the world was supposedly going to end. A year that was perhaps the zenith of female-led electronic pop, where the dominating style was that of bombast and anthemicism. Where Nicki wasn’t a mess, Kesha had a (seemingly) stable career, and Rihanna actually released music. Where all anyone wanted to do was make the most of the night, because they were going to die young. Welcome to 2012!

These three albums represent the year and general musical time period in a nutshell - women making electrifying electropop that dominated the charts and was adored by r/popheads. The singles are iconic staples of the three artists’ discographies, while the deep cuts prove their artistry and see them exploring and experimenting with various sounds. No matter the results, this is bound to be a blast! Onto the albums in question:

[**Nicki Minaj - Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded**](https://imgur.com/a/xz5fMJ4)

Though Nicki rose to fame with her hip-hop mixtapes and acclaim on guest verses, it seemed that a large part of her success was found through her poppier songs - her 2010 debut album *Pink Friday* had its biggest hit in “Super Bass”, a bubbly electronic track fit with a radio-ready sung chorus that was extremely catchy. With features on songs like those by EDM producer David Guetta in 2011, Nicki’s pivot into boppy electropop was well on its way. This was solidified with the release of *Roman Reloaded,* which features anthemic eurodance-influenced singles and heavy electronic production in the latter half of the tracklist. However, the album also saw Nicki stick to her hip-hop roots in parts, mainly in the first half of the album, showing off her versatility as an artist and appealing to multiple sides of her rapidly growing fanbase.

[**Rihanna - Unapologetic**](https://imgur.com/a/Vuvvjel)

If we count the reissue of 2007’s *Good Girl Gone Bad*, Rihanna’s career from her debut in 2005 all the way until 2012 consisted of her putting out an album every single year. *Unapologetic*, of course, is that 2012 album that ended her streak . Despite the output of so much music, Rihanna remained one of pop’s biggest names on the charts and it seemed nobody could ever tire of her. *Unapologetic* features a continuation of the electronic styles seen on Rihanna’s previous albums *Loud* and *Talk That Talk*, but also saw her experiment with other types of music, such as R&amp;amp;B, piano ballads, and even trap - proving herself again to be a pioneer of genres in the mainstream. While she’d end up taking a hiatus after the album’s release, *Unapologetic* saw Rihanna continue to pump out hits and bops while also showing her ability to cover a diverse array of musical styles.

[**Kesha - Warrior**](https://imgur.com/a/Gac1dDM)

Kesha’s career during her first two albums is somewhat tainted by the unfortunate label circumstances she was in, but it’s absolutely undeniable that her output consisted of absolute BOPS. With *Warrior*, the NES bloops that backed *Animal* were put aside in favour of a cleaner EDM sound, seen in the album’s singles. In addition to her trademark electronic bangers, Kesha experiments with other genres such as rock and folk in some of the album’s deeper cuts. Although *Warrior* saw less commercial success than her mammoth *Animal + Cannibal* era, and Kesha herself doesn’t seem to like it much, it remains a favourite among fans and features some of her best songs.

*Note that we are rating the album versions of “Dirty Love” (featuring Iggy Pop, as opposed to the solo music video version) and “Crazy Kids” (featuring nobody, especially not will.i.am)*

I'm really excited for this rate, it's been a long time coming, and hopefully its existence can summon new music from Rihanna and Kesha. If you have any questions, do feel free to ask in the comments, DM me on reddit, or find me in the r/popheads discord server. Scroll down for the due date and reveal dates! I also apologize in advance for making you listen to not one, but two Chris Brown collaborations.
