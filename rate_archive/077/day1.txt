ImADudeDuh: Tbh Rihanna and Kesha’s albums were better than I expected, but I was pretty disappointed with Nicki’s.

Belle-ET-La-Bete: Yeah honestly, Roman Reloaded is a very inconsistent album and has some of her worst songs. And idk if the choice to have the front half be a rap album and the second half be a half baked pop album completely worked.

This song... I don't really know what to say about it. The woozy production is hypnotic, but in the worst way possible in that it actually puts you to sleep. The chorus is overly repetitive and doesn't stand out at all. And then there's Eminem, who comes in with that almost so-bad-it's-good "I'm the butt police" line in his verse. Maybe a hot take but I don't really like any of the Rihanna and Eminem collabs, they're all just so uninteresting to me. A deserving first boot from the rate.

---

**awhile2** (10): ems veres is pretty wack but it samples my favorite ye song and th rest of it is fire

**Sliemy** (9.5): The production on this track is out of this world, the lengthy echoing of Rih's voice on the chorus over the trap beat >>>>>>. Seems to be unpopular, but Em snaps here, and the two of them are 4/4 for iconic collabs.

**TCHALLA1966** (8.2): I really don’t feel eminem on this

**ditacarlita** (8): a fucking fantastic album cut, it's completely hypnotising, I'm the butt police and I'm looking at your REAR REAR REAR!

**jordannimz** (7): I don't really have any strong thoughts about this song, but it's pretty good. Eminem's part is good, but honestly too short.

**JunkyGS** (7): I'm the butt police, and I'm looking at your rear, rear, rear.... sigh

**lilacsweetener** (7): This works if you just picture a nightclub going absolutely insane, ahead of its time tbh.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): This would be so much more highly rated if Eminem hadn’t said he’s the butt police (and somehow thought that it was actually a good line?????)

**mayolizard** (6): mmmmmgmmgmgmmg

**nooodisaster** (6): I...... don't think I've ever listened to this song in full lmaaao.

**radiofan15** (5.6): Rihanna and Eminem have more shitty collabs together than good ones...

**jexan13** (5.5): It's... interesting. Could have been much better if the "I'm going numb" hook was repeated, like, much less. It gets irritating.

**1998tweety** (5): This song is very chill and lowkey, so Em's aggressive rap style really isn't a good fit.

**anothertown** (5): (keke palmer voice) i hate to say it, i hope i don't sound ridiculous, i don't know who this man is. i mean, he could be walking down the street, i wouldn't know a thing. sorry to this man.

**fxsparrow** (5): This is a filler and it's sad to see it placed this high on the album

**lady\_sable** (5): way too repetitive for me tbh, but i do like the production

**BearlyEvenAPun** (4): This isn't the Linkin Park cover I was promised

**skargardin** (4): Can you believe that this song has a whopping nine writers

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): It sounds like something that would play in the background of a club scene on a tv show while someone is having a drug trip. I totally get what she’s going for here with the weird vocals and verse/chorus structures evoking the feeling of numbness she describes, but just because she achieved her goal doesn’t necessarily mean it was the right choice to make. Also Eminem is corny and didn’t need to be here.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): why were no good pop albums released in 2012. Eminem makes me very uncomfortable on this song cause it feels like he's trying to hit on me directly in my ear for the first half.

**waluigiest** (2): nothing is anchoring this song down. It just kind of goes. I also don’t like eminem and I don’t like how his voice is produced to be so close to me

**lilguavachan** (1): i didn't like this song when it came out, i don't like it now, whoever produced it needs to flung into a volcano.

**passionfruits2** (1): burn this song

**ignitethephoenix** (0): it’s too repetitive and Eminem somehow feels underused? I think this is definitely the worse song in the rate. At least Stupid Hoe is entertaining.

**TragicKingdom1** (0): not sure if this is a hot take but rihanna and eminem don't have a single good collab ... do my rate in october

**vhqv1997** (0): Yeah the title perfectly describes this song. Nothing here is resonant for me, everything washed straight off my ears and ultimately all I gained from this song is a sense of loss.

Another slow and boring song on this album, and it kinda just feels like wading through mud trying to escape and get to Starships at this point. Also another song with male features that weren't necessarily asked for, further hammering in this song's uninterestingness. I don't really think it's quite deserving of being the first Nicki boot of this rate because it's mostly just boring and there ARE worse songs from her that I'd prefer to see out first, but I'm not even remotely upset about it.

---

**jordannimz** (10): this has always been one of my favourite Roman Reloaded songs, it's just a major bop.

**radiofan15** (9.4): Nicki was so powerful in this era that even in her most fillery tracks she knocked it out of the park

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is totally not the kind of song I expect from Nicki but it sounds good.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I weirdly like this song? The strings sound like they’re supposed to be elegant and the chorus is so smooth but then like, the chorus is just about having sex in public. The juxtaposition of the crass subject matter and the posh stylings is so funny.

**passionfruits2** (8): actually quite a bop, surprised.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): honestly bobby V does a good chorus, but fuck lil wayne ruins the whole mood of this song

**waluigiest** (7): he packin that muscle I’m addicted to brain

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): anyone remember bobby v?

**lady\_sable** (5): hm.

**lilguavachan** (5): gurl i fell asleep half way through

**selegend** (5): r&b songs like this just crack me up

**ditacarlita** (4): filler

**gateway2glimmer** (4): The song is fine, but it doesn't sound like it's Nicki's track, it's like she's just featured on it. Besides that, I would like it more if Nicki hadn't already done this better years before on Gucci Mane's Sex in Crazy Places.

**vhqv1997** (4): The instrumentals are lit but all the performers on this sounded annoying. This is only 3 and half minutes but I swear to God it felt like dragging on for 5 minutes

**anothertown** (3): 2012 sucks so bad to me right now

**fxsparrow** (3): this feels forced

**skargardin** (3): choices

**LiberalMusicLover** (1): Listening to this song would make someone too tired to have sex.

**nooodisaster** (1): There is nothing less sexy on this earth than Lil Wayne. (Omg without the 1s my average for this album would be soooo high lmfao)

Oof. It's truly tragic that the two Chris Brown songs in this rate are actually among the better songs on their respective albums... I ended up giving them both decent scores because I am garbage but everyone that gave this a low score mostly because of Chr*s very much made points. Let's see where Rihanna's collab ends up...

---

**radiofan15** (10): Even the saccharine poppy R&B songs with Rihanna's Hitter are so good!

**jordannimz** (9): damn why is C* B**** here, anyway, it's a bop nonetheless, and I just try to ignore his part. Nicki's verse is so good, and her HARMONIES I die. The chorus and bridge are just perfection.

**LiberalMusicLover** (9): Honestly, this is among the top tracks of the album and a better song than the Bobby V collaboration. People will rate it low because Chris Brown is featured, but he didn't slack on the songs he did that are included in this rate.

**agentofscranton** (8.5): so conflicted about scoring this well considering him

**gannade** (8): this is a guilty pleasure... chris browns part does suck but i kinda love nickis. the i-i-i-i-i-i she does is so funny

**ignitethephoenix** (8): It’s cute although at the same time fuck Chris brown

**selegend** (8): chris brown sounds good on this uhhhhhhhh

**skargardin** (8): Unfortunately this bops as well

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): potential heresy but i'd give it a 10 if it was ANY OTHER MALE RNB SINGER DAMMIT

**TCHALLA1966** (8): a BOP we just gonna ignore the ft

**1998tweety** (7.5): This duo makes more sense together nowadays huh.

**fxsparrow** (6): My crush sent me this song as a dedication as a friend

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this is like the definition of meh album filler

**rickikardashian** (6): song starts Oh wow this is kinda going off. Chris Browns sings nvm this sucks. But forreal tho, not to beat a dead horse and hate Chris Brown on this sub, but he truly has such a detestable voice I can't stand his autotuned ass parts.

**static\_int\_husp** (6): This is actually pretty good. Too bad Chris Brown is on it.

**rosecoloreds** (5): cause chris brown

**jackisboredtoday** (4.1): a painfully generic ballad and that’s even before considering that it has chrs brwn

**ditacarlita** (4): filler

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): At least Rihanna put Chris Brown on a good song.

**lady\_sable** (3): kill chris brown and this would be at least a 7

**vhqv1997** (3): Me: "Oh this song is a jam, I really like this". Also me 30 seconds after looking up the name of the song and seeing the featured artist: "Fuck this shit"

**JunkyGS** (1): chris trash

**lilguavachan** (1): she's weirdly shouty on this song and if you think i'm gonna rate a song with dollar store usher higher than 1 you're sorely mistaken

**waluigiest** (1): in addition to the unfortunate feature, this song is not good. It’s so poorly produced wtf

**nooodisaster** (0): I always kinda hated this song so I'll happily give it my 0 :)

From Beautiful Sinner through Gun Shot I honestly just sleep. I don't really think any of the four songs in this stretch are bad, and there's decent aspects of all of them, but they're just so boring and lifeless and very clearly Nicki trying to pump out some cute pop songs to pad out her ridiculously long album. They're just not necessary at all and at this point in the album everyone is TIRED. Understandably and deservedly placing very low.

---

**radiofan15** (10): Love the contrast between the upbeat poppy beat and the sexual lyrics... Janet wishes!

**TCHALLA1966** (10): This is everything for me such a bop LOVE Beenie Man! His and Nicki voice work so well together.

**nooodisaster** (9.5): The most random song on this record, and I fucking love it. This radiates happiness and warmth, and Beenie Man is just a wholesome lil potato piling on the energy.

**gateway2glimmer** (8): This is just a great reggae-pop track.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): An ambitious mix of crazy Nicki, emotional Nicki, and dance Nicki. It works surprisingly well!

**1998tweety** (7): Meh

**rickikardashian** (7): I have no fucking clue what she is saying, but this sounds sweet, so I'll just bop my head and hope it isn't about murder. Also, I really hope this was only Nicki, because at the end the dude starts just making bird sounds and it straight up knocked 0.5 off the song's score

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): ok but imagine how much better this album would be if the last three songs weren't in it

**waluigiest** (6): not bad but it feels so long

**ditacarlita** (5): boring

**jordannimz** (5): the chorus is good enough, but it just feels sorta generic. The feature feels unnecessary to me. The second half of the bridge (production-wise) reminds me of Wavin' Flag.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): you'd think a song called gun shot would be more interesting

**skargardin** (4): This track could've been cut from this edition tbh

**lilguavachan** (3): i didn't like this song when this album first came out. i still don't like it.

**fxsparrow** (0): The accent!? couldn't save this song

This song is... difficult to judge. Musically - in terms of production and catchiness and all that - it's actually really good. Maybe the best on the album, even. It's a throwback piano BOP that gives such much needed life to Unapologetic. There's just one, big, disgusting problem... Chris Brown. The man who beat Rihanna is singing on a song with her about how their relationship is nobody's business. Yikes. I reluctantly gave this a pretty high score because it is truly a bop, but I don't like listening to it because of the feature.

---

**LiberalMusicLover** (10): People are gonna hate on this song just because Chris Brown is on it, and it was followed by a song talking about love "striking" in the night. Disregarding their history and just taking into account of the quality of the song, this is a major BOP. They BOTH snapped. Rihanna did Michael Jackson justice yet again, first with "Don't Stop the Music" and now this. Their deliveries were on point. The melodies and harmonies were fire. The production is top notch. If she sang this with Bruno Mars or The Weeknd, it would've been another #1 hit for her.

**radiofan15** (10): God I feel so conflicted with this song... i'm just gonna give this a 10 and look away in shame at what I just did

**Sliemy** (10): The production, the vocals, the chemistry- everything about this song was A+. I hate that this collab/relationship held the album from getting the acclaim it deserved, at the end of the day it's Rih's choice who she works with and people need to stop being angry on her behalf imo. As the theme of the album goes, Unapologetic, this song was one of her biggest statements of living her truth.

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): Yeah, this is a damn mess. But, this won't win, so I'm actually gonna give it the score I think it deserves purely based on music alone

**1998tweety** (9): Rihanna sis what are you doing....it's kind of a big bop though.

**awhile2** (9): fuck c breezy but he kills this song

**EuroBish** (9): Hate that I like This

**skargardin** (9): I fucking hate that this bops, and it bops hard. Sorry, moral compass.

**TCHALLA1966** (8.8): no matter how much you hate chris brown this still bops curse her for making a bop with CB again smh

**jexan13** (8.7): goddamn it

**gannade** (8.5): im so sorry but this .... is good.... -crying emoji-

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This is a pretty good song and of course it has to have Chris Brown smh

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Of *course* Rihanna would serve us a slick Italo-house bop and then let Chris Brown ruin it. Of course. I’m not going to arbitrarily score this one lower because of his involvement, a rate is a rate, but I can say without bias that he underserves the song. His voice is too thin and scratchy, someone with a fuller, richer tone would have made a better match for Rihanna. The part at the end where they’re trading lines back and forth is maybe the worst vocal moment on the album.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): honestly sounds a bit ahead of its time with the disco/funk throwback sound...mixing is kinda shit though. also despite chris brown this is one of the best songs on the album

**williamdowley123** (8): nooo why is the song with chris brown the best song on the album

**ditacarlita** (7): ignoring CB I find this song really catchy and totally enjoy it

**fxsparrow** (7): it's not my business

**slimboyfriend** (7): Twenty seconds in and I was already disappointed that a song with Chrs Brwn is maybe the best song on the album

**CreepyMannequin** (6): I know it’s CB but this does bop

**sailormunelune** (6): well this aged poorly

**worlds-okayest666** (6): Would have been a 10 if Chrs Brwn wasn’t on it

**anothertown** (5): i hate that this sounds so good, the little piano glimmers are so pretty and it could have been a nice little house-lite bop

**DrunkHurricane** (5): this song makes me so conflicted because musically speaking this might be the best song on the entire album, but it's also literally an abuser and his victim singing about how other people shouldn't get involved in their abusive relationship, and when viewed through that lens it's genuinely disturbing

**jordannimz** (5): damn C* B****! Rihanna's parts slap, and the instrumental is disco perfection, but having him on this track ruins it for me, especially considering their past relationship and the song's subject matter. And I don't even love his vocal performance on this song.

**mayolizard** (5): ONCE AGAIN: Chris brown breaks down a good song.

**rickikardashian** (5): I'll do everything to ignore the devil's presence in this, it's just very repetitive and the topic the song talks about it's quite awkward and in insight, im not enjoying listening to Rihanna singing about "it's just my baby's and I business" when the "baby" was a dude that damn near killed her

**rosecoloreds** (3): fuck chris brown

**vhqv1997** (3): Rihanna sweetie why?

**sweetnsoursauce1** (2): honestly there's nothing redeemable about this song - the message when considering the feature is even worse and the melody/tune is just eugh. imagine putting this between stay and love without tragedy

**nooodisaster** (1): barf emojis (since this is the better CB feature, it gets the 1 instead of the 0)

**BearlyEvenAPun** (0): why

**JunkyGS** (0): Retro Bop, but Chris is trash and hard to ignore the lyrics being about their relationship

**lady\_sable** (0): no

**lilacsweetener** (0): vomit

**lilguavachan** (0): the beat? great. the fact that it's an abuse victim singing about her abuser? not great. and the abuser is featured? really not great.

**rotating3Dtext** (0): so….

**Saucymac** (0): I know we should be rating the song and not the artist, but the lyrics and the context behind them is enough for me to rate it a zero.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): at least Nicki's Chr\*s Br\*wn collab is good

**waluigiest** (0): Part of me likes this song. I love the slick, glitzy beat. I think the writing is beautiful when decontextualized. But the world relies on context, and for that reason this song disgusts me.

A song called Fire Burns should probably be more exciting shouldn't it? This is another fine but mostly uninteresting cut from the dragging second half of the album, and it's very easy to see why it's an early boot here.

---

**radiofan15** (9): The worst song on the album is still a 9 for me... the stan definitely jumped out

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): One of the more under appreciated of the pop songs on this album, this kind of more mournful production really suits Nicki. Like I know we all love it when she gets crazy but she really pulls off pathos very well.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): "And so I pray you burn in hell, and you never find the ocean." We-.....

**1998tweety** (7.5): Sean Kingson - Fire Burning outsold, her ballads have gotten much stronger.

**lady\_sable** (7): honestly i havent really had much to say on these last few songs bc there's just...not much to say. they're catchy, they bop but they just kind of run together tbh

**waluigiest** (7): solid but not revolutionary

**rickikardashian** (6.9): ngl, i prefer when singers go with some metaphors to explain how they are feeling, but I truly do appreciate the sincerity of a song that just says "you're a piece of shit and I hope you die"

**ditacarlita** (6): a good album cut, refreshing after so much trash

**skargardin** (6): the synths during the verses are so damned good but the hook is kinda sloppy, it could've been something with a better hook

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): Ganja Burn outsold (and so did Sean Kingston - Fire Burning)

**jordannimz** (5): I like the verses and production, but the chorus is not that great, and her vocals are not the best here. Again, kinda forgettable.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5): this song is just kinda there and tbh is pretty much the definition of filler

**vhqv1997** (5): Water is wet. Fire burns.

**fxsparrow** (4): It burned my ears

**ImADudeDuh** (2): zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

What can I say about this that I can't say about the other milquetoast pop tracks in the back half? Pretty much nothing. Again, very easy to see why this is out here in the early part of day 1.

---

**lilguavachan** (10): i remember being so obsessed with this song and it still goes off

**waluigiest** (10): I forgot how absolutely wet the back half of this album was. Sex

**radiofan15** (9.6): That goddamn beat gave me back the years I lost with that shitty man who was my first boyfriend... and it wasn't even that long of a relationship

**JunkyGS** (9.5): Underrated banger!

**1998tweety** (9): We love evacuate the dance floor.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): At least it’s weird.

**jordannimz** (6): I mean the hook line is catchy, but it just seems weaker than the amazing songs that surround it. Her vocal run at the end of the second verse is good though.

**nooodisaster** (6): The 18 second rap at the beginning is an 11, and then.... it's a 5.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): CAN THIS ALBUM BE INTERESTING AGAIN

**skargardin** (5): Pretty basic, doesn't leave me snatched

**vhqv1997** (5): Nicki trying to be a vocalist is such a hilarious thing to witness

**rickikardashian** (4): in theory there's nothing really wrong with it truly, i just don't like it, it sounds so lifeless and boring, and I don't really understand how the intro correlates to anything else

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): Ew this sounds like some thing off of MDNA

**ditacarlita** (3): i do not remember this album being this bad!

Much like the way "Love" is formatted in the title, this song is longgggggggggggg. And it doesn't do much with its length either, being mostly boring throughout the whole thing. This is the first 11 out and the controversy score is above average so it does have its fans, but it's really not for me and I am more than fine with it leaving this early.

---

**LiberalMusicLover** (11): Probably my fave from this album. Fuck Ciara for not letting this get the single treatment. Would've been a smash.

**Sliemy** (10): A very jarring collaboration that holds up well, the sharp contrasts between both their voices and styles on the song works well, and I've grown to really fall in love with it over time.

**awhile2** (9): this song fukcs

**ditacarlita** (9): two words DREAMY and ROMANTIC

**rotating3Dtext** (9): pleasant r&b

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is surprisingly good but why does future legit sound like a dying animal

**jordannimz** (8): I literally do not remember this song, but it's actually good and Future's part is surprisingly pretty good! I love the electric guitar, and also when does anyone harmonize with Future? I'm living.

**lady\_sable** (8): oh wow this is really pretty

**nooodisaster** (8): VVVVVV tease.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): i usually hate future but his crooning works on this song tbh...plus this has aged better than almost everything else on this album

**waluigiest** (8): Love this. It’s so tender and affectionate and I also feel like I’m drowning

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is filler but good filler. [2]

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): “Loveeeehuehhuehhueh” - Future and Seth Rogen

**JunkyGS** (7.5): LovEeE UGH UGH UGH yeah future ruins this for me

**anothertown** (7): bye @ futures singing, but love everything else

**slimboyfriend** (7): C'mon random guitar solo in a Rihanna/Future collab

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): i feel like this would've charted really well if it was released in 2016???

**fxsparrow** (6.5): it's too loooooooooong

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): why does Future sound like a literal seal, just let Rihanna sing

**lilguavachan** (6): future still sounds like an autotuned seal begging for a fish, the rest is cute

**EuroBish** (5): meh

**jackisboredtoday** (4.6): I can’t go lower because I’m a hardcore rihanna stan but this is maybe my least favorite single of her career. Future has made some good songs but his feature here is just awful here and derails this before it even starts. Rihanna brings it on the verses but I can barely listen to that hook

**skargardin** (4.5): They really thought this title was a good idea

**radiofan15** (3.8): This is boring as fuck, it lacks charisma and anything resembling chemistry between Future (who can choke) and Rihanna... at least the production is decent

**worlds-okayest666** (0): I have so many issues with this song I don’t even know where to start. Why is it so long? Why does Future take up most of it? Why is it so boring? WHY???

Rih has made music in this style before, such as on Man Down, but it falls flat here. It just feels like an inferior version of that bop and it's really easy to see why this was made a bonus track as well as why it's leaving on day 1.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): High-key this was my favorite song on the album. She’s obviously a queen of dance music and I’m fully aware that this sounds crazy but Rihanna has always given me a bit of a country singer vibe. Like a lot of country singers she doesn’t necessarily have the best singing voice but she’s good at creating a mood and telling a story, so story driven songs like this (and “Man Down”) really work for her. Something simple but effective is a good sound for her, I love the unassuming chorus and Rihanna’s voice sounds good without her having to sound nasal or like she’s doing a Sia impression. I’d love to hear more from her like this.

**LiberalMusicLover** (10): The vocal performance on this song is also amazing. Hopefully #R9 and its reggae influences build upon this sound.

**lilguavachan** (10): why does no one talk about this song, this song is the best song on unapologetic don't @ me (or do, idgaf)

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is kind of groovy, I'm digging it.

**anothertown** (7): we love a prominent bassline and the amount of times she says "merderer"

**ditacarlita** (7): wonderful album cut

This song feels too long and overstuffed with guest rappers. It also doesn't help that it's kinda boring, with Nicki trying her best but not being able to elevate the song, and the features are just not great. I guess she wanted a stretch of the album that was a bit more low-key before the bombastic EDM-pop kicks in with Starships? A deserving day 1 cut.

---

**radiofan15** (9.5): The beat, the vibe, the harmonies... ugh this is pure and delicious summery R&B near-perfection

**ignitethephoenix** (8): It’s weird how this is the point she switched from her alter ego but it’s a decent song

**jackisboredtoday** (8): i loved those big star-studded rap posse cuts in middle school and well, here’s one of them

**jordannimz** (8): I mean I don't love the features except Nas', but overall, this song has a great beat, and it's uplifting 😊 and I really like Nicki's parts.

**nooodisaster** (8): Nicki's verse is an 11. But the boys really can't keep up with her, huh? Drake's like a 7, Jezzy is maybe a 5, and Nas is a 9.

**1998tweety** (7.5): Ends a bit abrupt

**LiberalMusicLover** (7): Kind of too long of a song.

**slimboyfriend** (7): This is kinda just a 2012 Drake song

**jexan13** (6.9): The verse of the rapper with the sore throat really brings the score of this song down.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Am I racist if I’m middling on this one? It feels messy. Like, this track is overstuffed. Good sentiment though.

**ditacarlita** (5): filler and boring but palatable compared to the following tracks

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is boring

**selegend** (5): this shit too long

**skargardin** (5): This is just kinda there

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5): just falls flat after the last three songs and damn i never realised how long this drags for

**waluigiest** (4): I like Nicki’s verse but the guests leave a lot to be desired. And they’re most of the track :/

**fxsparrow** (3): With all this talent I expected something better

**passionfruits2** (3): yuck.

Nicki has a lot of ballads in her discography and frankly I don't really care for any of them? At least she didn't release this as a lead single like Pills N Potions but I feel like that's not really what I want to listen to her for at all. She's not really a vocalist at all and is much, MUCH more talented at rapping. Here she wails about Marilyn Monroe for some reason backed by another milquetoast electropop beat. It's not the worst thing ever but it does not invoke much emotion for me - it's just Fine.

---

**jordannimz** (10): I LOVE Nicki's ballads; I mean this is an uptempo synth-pop banger, but still feels like a ballad. Her emotional delivery is so good, and I love the melody, especially in the chorus. Also, there's an acoustic guitar hidden in the second verse, which is so unexpected for a Nicki song, but it totally works.

**lilguavachan** (10): i'm giving this a 10 because i constantly think to myself in times of distress, "is this how marilyn monroe felt felt felt felt"

**radiofan15** (10): We love an introspective ballad

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): it;s not as deep as 17 year old me thought it was but it's still a good tune and nicki's vocals (are they nicki's vocals?????) sound amazing

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): My favorite of Nicki’s non-rapping songs, the melody in the verses here is so memorable, I sang this all the time in middle school

**1998tweety** (8.5): A lot of people will call this type of music thrashy but I like it a lot (it loses points for the bad lyrics tho).

**imasalesman** (8): lowkey these vocals though

**nooodisaster** (8): I remember this song leaked ahead of the album & since I was a hardcore Barb I would listen to it constantly. So while it's probably nothing special, I have lots of nostalgia for this song.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): this sounds like the song the lead character would sing at the climax of a DCO

**skargardin** (7.5): boppy, definitely one of the better tracks on the back half of the album

**jexan13** (7): A different, non-generic production would have helped this a long way.

**LiberalMusicLover** (7): A great ballad for someone like Nicki. The diversity of the music on this album was great, if only she could've scrapped some of the tired dance tracks like the two preceding this track.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): not sure if I like nickis pop ballad-sequel songs as much

**lady\_sable** (6.5): catchy enough that i can almost forgive the lyrics

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): She really made the Facebook meme into a song, huh? Of the two songs in this rate that are about Marilyn Monroe I would say this is the worse one.

**selegend** (6): she probably was racist

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): am i stupid what does marilyn monroe has to do with anything lmao

**vhqv1997** (6): Katy Perry is shook

**rickikardashian** (5.5): just sonically speaking, this sounds like an Original Disney Channel movie song that the protagonist sings when she feels like she doesn't fit in before she turns it all around and sings in front of everyone showing how much she really is worth (Tho idk if any Disney Channel movie would reference Marilyn Monroe)

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): After the last 2 songs, this carries the emotional weight of a Sufjan Stevens song

**ditacarlita** (5): slightly better than the last few songs but still mediocre

**waluigiest** (5): the weak writing and cheesy piano hold back what could be a huge banger

**fxsparrow** (4): Ok

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this shit is so fucking boring oh my god

**gannade** (2): the instrumental is kinda pretty but nicki please hire better ghost writers omfg a middle schooler couldve done better

**passionfruits2** (1): marilyn didn't die for this

**gateway2glimmer** (0): Emotional Nicki is the worst Nicki. Marilyn Monroe doesn't deserve this.

Another meh electropop song from Nicki, nothing new here. This one fared a bit better than some of the other songs from this stretch and I can see it but it's still not nearly the best from this album.

---

**lilguavachan** (10): why am i getting emotional over a nicki pop song... my mental state is so broken istg

**radiofan15** (10): Nicki should do more of these pure pop songs... this one is cuter than a puppy

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I’m always a sucker for this kind of “young love leaves a scar” song.

**1998tweety** (8): Blackpink - Forever Young outsold

**vhqv1997** (8): Oh I like this. Nicki is not a good vocalist, but she managed to deliver some real emotions here and it's very surprisingly resonant.

**jordannimz** (7): I mean it's good; I like the melody in the chorus, but it feels a little forgettable. Good overall, but not a standout track.

**skargardin** (7): It's good but also, what else is there to say abt it?

**waluigiest** (6): pretty nondescript

**ditacarlita** (5): I don't mind the chorus but the song is bland

**nooodisaster** (5): Generic forever.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): im checked out of this album, wake me up when stupid hoe makes this album interesting again

This is... something. I don't think it's absolutely terrible but it's both less interesting than a lot of the other tracks on the album and also just like. not good lyrically - she manages to both brag about being a voice actor in Ice Age and throw in a distasteful line about Columbine and uh... sis...

---

**radiofan15** (9.7): Nicki and Lil Wayne are fire and gasoline together... they're shit bangs, it bang-bangs

**nooodisaster** (8.9): The beat slaps haaard. Prob the most dangerous sounding song on the record and that's a very good thing. Tho the tiny verses + chorus can make it feel repetitive.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): Nicki goes HARD here and if wayne didn’t show up slurring his words & sounding sloppier than Nicki the rating would be even higher

**static\_int\_husp** (8): How do you brag about being in *fucking Ice Age* in the middle of such a hard song?

**1998tweety** (7.5): Roman Holiday and Roman's Revenge both outsold but this slay a bit.

**lady\_sable** (7.5): bang bang

**lilguavachan** (7.5): i forgot about that columbine line lmao whew

**ditacarlita** (5): not worthy of naming the album after

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Um, a Columbine reference? And you’re gonna make fun of Raggedy Ann? Go back to retirement.

**anothertown** (4): im out in la at the ice age taping

**ImADudeDuh** (4): yeah I do not like lil wayne

**jordannimz** (3): I don't like the chorus that much, but the drums go hard. Definitely not my favourite Lil Wayne verse. At all.

**waluigiest** (3): a song that is constructed from gun violence essentially. Also, how tf Nicki let herself get outrapped by Lil Wayne on her own song?

**skargardin** (0): Goodbye, this is really terrible, NONE redeeming qualities

This is actually a slight robbery imo, this song is very much a bop and gives a lot of life to the album. The production may be among the most dated in the rate, but to me that's not really a problem seeing as I love dated early 10s electronic production. If it were up to me I'd have this song make day 2, but the tribe has spoken.

This is where the album starts to take another dip for me, and that's not to say Automatic is bad- it's actually quite good imo - it's just more generic than the three pop songs preceding it. It's a cute bop, but neither Nicki nor the production take it to anywhere past being a basic cute 2012 bop. As such, it's understandably placing fairly low here (though I wish it made day 2). Perhaps Nicki's other RedOne collaborations will fare better here.

---

**radiofan15** (9.2): Another dancefloor EDM anthem... i'm not complaining, but even if this is a BOP and a half, it's the lesser of the similar Roman Reloaded pure pop songs

**1998tweety** (9): This is incredibly dated but I fuck with it hard, it really does transport me back to that time huh. [2]

**jordannimz** (9): the harmonies in the verses are just so good, and the dubstep bass goes hard! It's so happy and dance-y!

**skargardin** (9): RedOne done snappedt

**nooodisaster** (8.5): I actually love the chours here? Lyrics are nothing to write home about tho.

**TCHALLA1966** (8): she cute

**waluigiest** (8): this banger has layers. Dated but WORTH IT

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): not bad just generic

**anothertown** (7): kind of bawps!

**Sliemy** (7): Basically the only good non-single pop album cut before the album takes a serious dive down the deep end.

**lilguavachan** (6): she's cute, but again songs like this were a dime a dozen so like... who cares

**rickikardashian** (5.5): the bridge sounds like an AI wrote a Born This Way song

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I don’t know about this one… Nicki isn’t really a singer and usually she manages to get by on that but something about this dancefloor production just doesn’t work with her thinner vocals.

**jackisboredtoday** (4.6): she sure sounds like she’s on autopilot for this song

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this sounds like background music for a movie scene in a club

**slimboyfriend** (4): Not even Rihanna’s album has a song that's so clearly filler as this one

**ditacarlita** (3): so bad, more DDR machine

**fxsparrow** (2): Manual

**LiberalMusicLover** (2): This is pure filler.

Where has Kesha been? There was a common sentiment that Warrior is the best album of the three and it's easy to see why Miss Sebert hasn't lost a song until now. However, I'm absolutely APPALLED that it's this one that is leaving first. I absolutely love it - it's so cute and an absolute bop and it made me very upset to see the low scores for it roll in and drop it down into the depths of the first day. Honestly I'd have this in day 3 if it were up to me. Sad!

---

**lilguavachan** (10): i'm sick of these songs making me emotional for no reason, i'm quitting this rate my mental stability is too fragile

**skargardin** (9): Im on the verge of crying to how happy and euphoric this song is, points were MADE

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I love the sentiment of this song. One of the things I appreciate about this album is how it captures the spirit of different aspects of being young, in this case the way that people come and go from our lives so quickly but leave big impacts. It’s not a mournful song, it’s celebratory, and as someone who’s really bad at keeping track of friends I like that idea.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): so electropop, so 2012

**radiofan15** (7.3): She's serving vocals in this song... but still this is as dated as a Britney Jean deep cut

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its good

**jordannimz** (7): not the strongest song on the album; I don’t hate it at all but it’s a little forgettable. Although I do love the transition from the bridge to the last chorus.

**1998tweety** (6.5): Filler and not even fun filler.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Y’know, it’s kinda good despite the dubstep

**anothertown** (6): for being different~

**awhile2** (6): this hook is kinda wack ngl

**ignitethephoenix** (5): this is so basic and goes on too long

**jexan13** (5): I feel I have heard this song a thousand times before, with different titles and perfomers.

**nooodisaster** (5): no

**fxsparrow** (4): Ahhh! Katy Perry's last Friday night (EDM version)

**waluigiest** (3): so uninspired. The writing and orchestration honestly offers nothing. It’s not unpleasant it’s just so completely bland

**gannade** (1): the autotune on the offkey "AREEEEEEEEEEEE" belt is hurting me

**passionfruits2** (0): sorry not sorry. this entire album is a mess, and this song is part of the problem.

With a fairly high controversy score, Jump just misses out on making day 2 and while I do like it a decent amount, it's easy to see why. The dubstep chorus is perhaps the most dated part of this rate, and clearly turned a lot of people off!

---

**jackisboredtoday** (11): WHEN YOU FUCK THEM OTHER GIRLS I BET THEY BE WONDERIN WHY YOU ALWAYS CALL MY NAME

**anothertown** (10): This is lesbian culture

**awhile2** (10): any song that smaples pony is n instant 10 tbh

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this just samples the chorus of pony and has a dubstep drop and I feel like it sounds like cry me a river too but why do I fucking love this song nnnn I hate myself

**jexan13** (10): That beat. That delivery. That melody. That hidden feature. This song is perfect... until that f**king drop. It sounds like a man burping. Despite that, it still deserves a 10 because the rest is soo good.

**radiofan15** (10): I love the Pony sample and the dubstep breakdown... it immediately dates the song but I don't care, a bop is a bop

**TCHALLA1966** (10): underrated bop i s2g

**jordannimz** (9): what why do I not recall hearing this song????? It goes hard!

**lady\_sable** (9): damn that beat drop

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): ...w-what, dubstep… right it was 2012

**ditacarlita** (8): go off

**EuroBish** (8): Used to be one of my fave tracks back in 2012.. Didn't survive that well.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This is one of the rare songs where verses are better than the chorus. Verses are a 10, chorus a 6

**1998tweety** (7.5): Wtf is this, this is wild but it kind of works a bit.

**waluigiest** (7): OMF I forgot about the aggressive drop. That alone makes this song antiquated, but a lot of the rest of it works

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): sorry but the Ginuwine version is better

**rickikardashian** (5.5): BOY THIS IS DATED. That dubstep drop brought me back to 6th grade

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): oh. a dubstep song.

**nooodisaster** (5): maybe EDM was a mistake.

**skargardin** (5): I'm terribly sorry this drop made me wanna rip my ears out but it kinda bops in places

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): well it's very 2012

**lilacsweetener** (4): Has always felt like it has everything it needs but sounds so LAZY to me.

**static\_int\_husp** (4): early 2010s EDM has aged liked milk

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): The verses feel like Rihanna just standing around while she waits for the drop to happen. A lot of the songs in this rate feel like products of their era but usually it’s charming; here it’s obnoxious. While I have nostalgia for this era of music songs like this remind me why we left it behind.

**lilguavachan** (3): ginuwine outsold and his pony didn't have a headache inducing breakdown

**TragicKingdom1** (3): ginuwine sweetie i am SO sorry

**gannade** (1): WHAT IS THIS SAMPLE?????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You could say that the title of this song is an apt title for today's reveal.

---

**Sliemy** (11): Her undeniable magnus opus, Brian Kennedy's production is absolutely next level complimented by the weariness and anguish ridden through Rihanna's voice to visualize a multi-layered story of a bad storm that dampens the mood and Rihanna wants to end, of smoking weed, and of wanting to desperately remove yourself from a situation and struggling to remain hope that things will get better one day. 11/10 stellar job.

**lilguavachan** (10): i love rihanna on softer songs, i feel like her voice really shines on them

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I really like this one! It feels like something I’d lie in my bed listening to moodily while staring up at the ceiling.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): okay this is gorgeous and I love the strings so much.

**1998tweety** (8): We love her ballad era [2]

**ditacarlita** (8): the slower songs on this album are really solid

**jordannimz** (8): again I forgot about this song, but it's beautiful! Who is the male vocal?

**waluigiest** (8): this song just sort of engulfs you like a lazy wave and heals

**nooodisaster** (7): VoHiYo chill vibes only VoHiYo

**anothertown** (6): the percussion is triggering some misophonia i didnt know i had

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Me anticipating one last boring ballad or dated edm banger before this album ends

This is the one Kesha song that consistently stayed fairly low, but a fun fact is that for a decent chunk of the rate, Kesha literally had ZERO songs eliminated on day 1. It was just straight Nicki/Rih the entire time. That would have been very amusing but alas that is not the case with all scores counted. This is a cute bop but I've always felt it was one of the weaker tracks on what is one of my favourite albums, so I'm definitely fine with it being a day 1 cut.

---

**jordannimz** (10): never has a song been simultaneously so nihilistic yet optimistic??? I kinda love the lyrics though, and the production is SUCH a jam.

**JunkyGS** (10): bop banger

**nooodisaster** (9): When she goes '-put your motherfucking phones up...................light em up', my panties drop.

**lady\_sable** (8.5): underrated bop

**LiberalMusicLover** (8): Kind of repetitive, but she sounds good here.

**lilguavachan** (8): she's a cute song... but she sandwiched in between two major bops so she tends to be forgotten

**selegend** (8): underrated!

**waluigiest** (8): this grew on me a bit - I really like the flowery language and the bridge

**1998tweety** (7.5): Filler but it bops a lil

**skargardin** (7.5): chorus bops hard

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): i want this kind of fizzy electronica production back in pop music, this song crashes over you like a wave when the chorus hits

**anothertown** (7): wait this kind of goes.. ok Ms Max Martin..

**ImADudeDuh** (7): it sounds very good and that's all i can say

**radiofan15** (6.9): Ah filler... we met each other again!

**fxsparrow** (6.5): What's beautiful life like? I wonder

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Add this song to the list of “songs that are way creepier knowing about the Kesha/Luke situation.” Personally I’ve never been a huge fan of this one, the message and the desperation of the song are powerful but it kind of just sounds like screaming.

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): poor mans die young

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): This sounds like a C-tier dance remix of a B-tier song

**TCHALLA1966** (4.3): I only got into this at the end

**vhqv1997** (4): The bridge is the only good part of this song

The first of the three opening tracks to leave, it's unfortunate that it's gone on the first day because I think it's quite fun. The production is messy but I think that's a big part of its charm. Definitely a good (or at least memorable) start to the album, which is great for it because in my opinion Unapologetic can be quite forgettable at times.

---

**awhile2** (10): underrated ri song this beat fucking slpas

**LiberalMusicLover** (10): My reaction when I first heard this was "David Guetta produced this?!"

**lilguavachan** (10): what an amazing opening track

**radiofan15** (10): If this doesn't pump you up for whatever is coming next I don't know what else might do the job

**lilacsweetener** (9): struts down VS catwalk

**Sliemy** (9): The production on this album was truly Rihanna's peak and this song as the album opener was the perfect display, her iconic runway gif just makes this all the more iconic.

**TCHALLA1966** (8.9): a bop and a half!

**ditacarlita** (8): FIERCE what an intro

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): When this first started I was like “ew what is this trashy mess” but then a minute later I was bopping. This is what every RuPaul song post-*Born Naked* is trying to be.

**jordannimz** (7): actually I like this song way more than I remember, the instrumental goes hard! Very fashion show.

**lady\_sable** (7): i legitimately have No Idea how to feel abt this song ok ive changed my score like three times now

**skargardin** (7): Actually a bop that will most likely go out day 1

**slimboyfriend** (7): This song isn’t as much a song so much as a state of being.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): The Victoria’s Secret Performance of this literally invented fashion shows

**ignitethephoenix** (6): Just hasn’t aged too well and doesn’t bop as hard as other aged songs

**waluigiest** (6): I’m so proud of Rihanna and this is well written, but this sounds so flat

**letsallpoo** (5): thinking about the people who bought this album expecting ballads after hearing "diamonds" and "stay" and instead being greeted with whatever this is

**static\_int\_husp** (5): feels kinda all over the place.

**nooodisaster** (4): Inspired this iconic moment and nothing else of value: https://nooodisaster.tumblr.com/post/138671940148/legalmexican-eliaes-eliaes-we-need-to

**1998tweety** (3): Diva? We don't like it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): i could go with never hearing this again tbh

**passionfruits2** (1): this song sucks. my ear hurts.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): im a im a a diva, im a im a a diva

WeastofEden44: Being real, what songs should have been cut instead? I feel like one of the biggest critiques of both Nicki and Riri is that some of their albums have an absurd amount of tiller, like PF Roman Reloaded is over 20 tracks so...

MrSwearword: Phresh Out the Runway was the Victoria's Secret runway song and y'all really thought fucking Stupid Hoe [and the other Nicki songs] were better than that? Gurl **BYE**

SupremeElect: I’m so glad Get It Over With got the chop. I hate that song with a PH#CKING passion.

letsallpoo: im surprised, the remaining nicki songs are easily the best on the album. well done everyone

Belle-ET-La-Bete: I’d definitely trade Whip it out for one of the few choices I think went too early.

deleted: Hi-jack update, I am at 38 participants, around 8 more until I donate $30 to charity! 

I am going to bed as soon as I sticky this comment, and will accept ballots until 8pm tomorrow when I am done with work, otherwise I will need a request for extension, and even then the 100% hard end is Tuesday, as I will be making all posts on Wednesday/Thursday, and will not edit them after they are done. 

--- 

Thank you to everyone who has done the rate so far, and hope to break 40 by the time I reveal!

Samosaurus1: Warrior is literally my favourite album of all time so I’m really sad to have missed this, but at least it’s doing as well as it should (though my bottom 2 would’ve been some combination of the title track, Supernatural and Out Alive)

=====

deleted: The fact that Dirty Love ft. Iggy was not the first song of Kesha's gone is a crime. COCKROACHES DO IT is worse than any sin committed by All That Matters or Wherever You Are and I will *not* hear otherwise.
