2022 was a crazy year. Will Smith slapped Chris Rock, we all played a single word game every day, The Queen died, the internet exposed themselves as still being Try Guys fans, Pink Sauce allegedly killed people, Harry Styles spit on Chris Pine while wearing ugly outfits, Jack Harlow got a 2.9 from Pitchfork, Lea Michelle still couldn't read, people threw soup at a painting, Rihanna **RELEASED NEW MUSIC??**, Liz Truss lost a race to a head of lettuce, Kim Petras got a #1 hit, Ticketmaster might finally be coming to an end, Britney was freed, being a fan of 'Running Up That Hill' made you a basic bitch, nepo babies got offended at being called nepo babies, we all had to #BeReal, Heidi Klum dressed as a worm, Twitter was ruined by it's new owner, Normani still has the name for her album y'all, and wildest of all: Meghan Trainor somehow made a comeback. 

Oh, and 3 ladies released music we'll be rating.

#[Beyoncé- RENAISSANCE](https://images.genius.com/dc1e2c104eac0b94648b3885677df9d0.1000x1000x1.png)

> I’m that girl  
> It’s just that I’m that girl

A Beyoncé release is always going to feel like an Event, a solo Beyoncé album, the first since 2016’s colossus Lemonade, exponentially more so. Of course this album was massive, especially since streaming was not shackled to Tidal (perhaps the Monkey’s Paw curled, however, as Renaissance also differs greatly from Lemonade in its current quantity of visuals). 

Renaissance is a post-lockdown explosion of expertly crafted dance music, with songs seamlessly flowing all throughout the album, transporting the listener to a club with a fantastic live DJ (even someone like me, who seldom ventures into a club). Taking inspiration from decades of black and queer pioneers, Renaissance is a indulgent celebration of the freeing nature of dance music, filled with apt samples, superstar production and an unrelenting energy throughout. This is not to say Beyoncé herself is lost in this lush mix- far from it- as her presence dominates on every track.

This seems to be a great time to be part of the Beyhive, with this album being only act 1 of a trilogy that will hopefully be prime Ultimate fodder for the foreseeable future. But will Renaissance be sitting ‘COZY’ on top of this rate?

#[Taylor Swift- Midnights (3am edition)](https://images.genius.com/2ed3c69bee25741e8ff223611616173a.1000x1000x1.jpg)

> Best believe I’m still Bejeweled  
> When I walk through the room I can still make the whole place shimmer

In between rerecording her old albums, racking up frequent flier miles, releasing way too many remixes, and perennially neglecting evermore (something popheads rates is also guilty of), Taylor has found time to bless us with another 20 songs of slick production, catchy melodies and enough lyrical content for Swifties to sink their teeth into until Speak Now TV comes out. Turning back from her pandemic albums that comprise significantly of less autobiographical songs, Midnights is a loose concept album focusing on the reasons for Taylor’s sleepless nights. Whether this is reflecting upon past relationships, current relationships or Taylor’s image with the media and fans, Midnights is consistently reflective, pondering topics from a more distant time perspective than usually seen in her previous albums. 

Taylor is inarguably the most talked about artist in popheads at this point. Whatever you think about her, any pophead can’t wait to bring her up, no matter the context (I am very guilty of this). Whether it be seemingly [innocuous threads being locked](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/10eer6c/taylor_swifts_antihero_becomes_her_sole/), [history being made](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/yihqo4/
taylor_swift_makes_history_as_first_artist_with/?), or the [infamous leak thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/y8edk2/taylor_swift_midnights/), Taylor Swift truly remains the it girl (as she remarks in Karma ‘Ask me why so many fade, but I’m still here’). 

The release of her 10th studio album may be a feat that many other artists want to emulate, due to its huge commercial success. Announced in a awards speech around two months before the release date, a conventional single release before the album drop was not needed, as all Taylor needed to do to build unbelievable amounts of hype for was dripfeed song titles and reveal lyrics on billboards around the world. This strategy paid dividends, with Midnights receiving both commercial and critical success. However, the final ‘Question…?’ remains to be asked.. can Midnights pull through a rate win up against other titan albums of 2022?

#[SZA - SOS](https://images.genius.com/af8e1cfd11b63b414e9474303603bf1d.1000x1000x1.png)  
*written by u/ImADudeDuh*

> I don't want none, I just want you  
> If I can't have you, no one should

Solána Imani Rowe is a very interesting musician. First coming to prominence thanks to a feature on Consideration by Rihanna, Solána (more commonly known as SZA) dropped her debut studio album *CTRL* on June 9, 2017. While acclaimed and successful on it’s debut, throughout the next 5 years it’s acclaim and success has only grown. CTRL is currently on it’s 294th week on the Billboard 200 chart, and has been named one of the best albums of the 2010s by acclaimed publications like Billboard, Pitchfork, Stereogum, and non-acclaimed publications like Rolling Stone. Everyone waited with baited breath to listen to her next project, and on June 9, 2022 we finally got to hear it.

[Several deluxe album tracks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQeezCdF4mk)

But in reality, that's not fair to SZA, as she's been vocal about her and her label having disagreements when it comes to releasing her music. Plus, she dropped plenty of loosies and features in that 5 years. Notably tracks like All The Stars, Good Days, I Hate U, and collaborations with artists such as Justin Timberlake, Doja Cat, Doechii, and DJ Khaled multiple times for some reason. And finally, after a very long wait, SZA revealed in a Billboard cover story in November 2022, that the album was completed and would officially be titled ‘*SOS,*’ with release planned for the next month. Fans were ecstatic to get an official album title, and even more ecstatic when SZA confirmed on SNL that the album would be coming December 9, 2022. For real this time! 

SOS was a very big step for SZA. The project showed her songwriting in a different angle than in CTRL and saw her dabbling in genres such as alt rock, hip-hop, and country. SZA leans even deeper into her personal writing, sharing more heartbreak than on her last album and dealing with it in ways that range from mature to fantasies of killing their ex. With so much praise and success this album has already received, it's not hard to imagine this becoming a modern classic much like CTRL. However, will the raters greet this album with 'Open Arms' or will they say 'I Hate U'?

#Rules & Instructions

**PLEASE READ THESE THOROUGHLY TO AVOID HAVING TO DEAL WITH ANY PROBLEMS WITH YOUR BALLOT LATER.**

* You must **listen to and score every song in the main rate**. Ballots with missing scores will not be accepted.
* Your scores must be on a scale from 1 to 10 and can include one decimal place but no more. So 8.2 is fine but 8.25 is not.
* You may give *one song* in the whole main rate a score of 11 and *one other* a score of 0 so, if you want to award these scores, save them for your favorite and least favorite songs in the rate respectively.
* We encourage you to leave comments of your general thoughts or reasoning behind your scores on any songs you wish. If you choose to do so however, they must be in this format, simply leaving one space after your score:

> ALIEN SUPERSTAR: 2 Gonna be UNIQUE and give this a bad score

Any other format such as:

> Anti-Hero: everybody is an ugly adult to me (6)

> Kill Bill: 9 - I don’t condone violence, unless it slays!

will get your ballot rejected.

* If you'd like to leave a comment on any of the albums as a whole they must be formatted like this, *leaving colon then a space after the album title*, for example:

> Album: SOS: -. .. -.-. .

* Your ballot must be formatted exactly like the template in the message link sent to u/ImADudeDuh so make sure you use it or the template in the backup pastebin for your scores to be accepted.
* Your scores will not be confidential and will be revealed, along with any comments, with your username attached.
* **PLEASE DO NOT SABOTAGE the rate** by giving outrageously low/high scores for the sole purpose of skewing the results (example: if you average for one album is a 9.52, and the other two are 3.65) *we reserve the right to exclude any ballot* we suspect of this. However, as we are in a special situation where this rate includes 3 albums of very different genres, we will understand some overall differences. If you're worried your scores could be mistakenly perceived as sabotage, *leaving comments explaining the reasoning behind them will be a big help* in beating the sabotage accusations. (Leaving comments for your 11 and 0 are HIGHLY encouraged!)
* If you want to change any of your scores or comments after you've already submitted your ballot, feel free to message me before the deadline either here on reddit or find me or my cohost u/impla77 in the Popheads Discord.
