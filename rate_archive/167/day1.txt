**ImADudeDuh** (1): lol

**impla77** (0): This is the easy zero of this rate, but with the opening lyric ‘Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man’ do I really need to explain myself further? This was dead last for all of the rate, and I’m sure no one is surprised by that.. a career low.

---

#Makeup Gurus

**FlavaSavaVandal** (10): all it took was 5 years for taylor to make a good reputation song, good for her

**Hulnia** (10): sounds like a parody of itself… and a really funny one at that lol

**Poydoo** (10): Don't kill me please

**runaway3212** (10): me and your girlfriend in your car... we might kiss... you might get arrested for fraud... she might divorce you... i might fuck her in your car... who is to say

**vayyiqra** (10): Lmao. I can kind of see why this song is so hated, but I love when Taylor tries to be edgy (see: Reputation). It's so funny and endearing how bad she is at it, it rules 😌

**jaztinax** (9): honestly would’ve given it a 10 if it hadn’t been for the cat eye line

**Bordersz** (8.5): That sharp eyeliner lyric is so?? no.

**daythreeinmiami** (8.5): I don’t give a shit what y’all say this song is perfect when putting on eyeliner.

**hikk** (8.5): she's living her obnoxious millennial that spent all their time on tumblr and buzzfeed and became a true crime podcaster turned author of corny noir detective novel with a powerful woman lead character and surface level feminist themes fantasy and i'm here for it idk it's a good time

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): Finneas found dead on a ditch

#I hate, hate, HATE! Your hair and makeup today

**intheaftermath** (7.5): ok I know it's a bad song but there's just something about it that prevents me from scoring it lower. It's so 2014 feminist tumblr in a weirdly nostaglic way. It's villain-playlist core. It's camp. Also Taylor writing lines about coke amuses me.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): It’s such 0 bait that I can’t help but like it a bit.

**DraculaWeekend** (7): I wish this was a Billie song

**plastichaxan** (7): Lorde-coded but with her lyrics so it’s only fine

**poppinmmolly** (7): seems incomplete

**Kayaking11116** (6.5): mmm yes I was craving some bass bc everything else before it had none ;-;-; this one makes me feel sad vengeful but not the same sad vengeful as SZA

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6.5): this feels like rep mixed with the storytelling we became accustomed to with her country albums. outside of that first line, it's not too bad

**udontwannaknownoel** (6.5): Oxytocin by Billie Ellish (Walmart Version)

**Lilacly\_Adily** (6.2): https://media.tenor.com/M6vg6biPveoAAAAM/cool-mary-kate.gif

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): objectively bad but i can weirdly enjoy it if i force myself into the right mindset

**Stryxen** (6.1): Ethel cain - Gibson girl

**Frajer** (6): always awkward when Taylor tries to be badass

**joeeswift** (6): the clean version with “vigilante shhhhhh” kinda goes harder

**mimins** (5.5): i liked it at first but i really wish the song developed because it got repetitive real quick

**nt96** (5): it sharted

**Roxieloxie** (5): coke mention omg haylor rights

**heysoupie** (4.8): this song makes me feel uncomfortable; idk I just don’t feel like anything remotely sultry suits Taylor ?

**seanderlust** (4.5): taylor you can't write a bad bitch anthem where the third verse is about you calling the cops on your boyfriend.

**Awkward\_King** (4): i am sorry i simply cannot bring myself to hate this. it is so juvenile and ridiculous hating this feels like hating a child like it is genuinely so terrible i dont hold it responsible for itself.

**Birdseeding** (4): Another slight sketch of a track that goes nowhere

**jonnl2806** (4): It's a bad version of a Billie song and it doesn't work for Taylor at all

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): it's giving Tyler Joseph

**cremeebrulee** (3.5): i dress for the enbies 😍

**modulum83** (3.5): jack antonoff should be forbidden from trying to make bad bitch music

**UselessTacooo** (3.5): Girly has been dressing like a pilgrim since 2020 her ass is not dressing for revenge

**indie\_fan\_** (3): it makes sense that the previous track is titled question cause that's wtf I'm asking here

**jsonphile** (3): r/iamveryedgy

**just\_thonking** (3): She had Billie Eilish style

**jman457** (2.5): Even my huge swiftie roommate can’t stand this song

**aldwin\_is\_here** (2): oh no, I'm a vigilane for reporting someone to the FBI! (and for saying this shit sucks as well, LOL!).

**ExtraEater** (2): "you should see me in a crown" demo tape

**masttup** (2): I know she was smirking writing this which makes it even worse, I’m not gonna let some guy on tik tok tell me the ‘he was doing lines’ bit is lyrical genius I won’t be gaslit by BigTaylor

**rfbeirut** (2): so embarassing you are in your 30s!

**starla\_** (2): 2013 tumblr called, they wanted their one liners back

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): me playing town of salem in 2014 when the person I shot was mafia and not town

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): and then the whole private jet clapped

**welcome2thejam** (2): The dreams of Girlboss Tumblr are alive and well

**aakar528** (1): what is this an attempt at lol

**AHSWeeknd** (1): this is Euphoria’s level of writing.

**amr** (1): burst out laughing when this started I'm sorry. as if it's my fault

**bluehxrizon** (1): draw the cat eyes funniest line of the year

**bogo** (1): taylor what you are describing isn't a vigilante it's just a white woman

**bookthieving** (1): [redacted for spoilers] towards the majority alliance at the merge in australian survivor: heroes v villains

**cocosairdep** (1): she really thought she did something 💀💀

**DaHumanTorch** (1): taylor definitely wrote a line with ghetto in it but jack made her delete it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): I think it’s a weak take on a Billie Eillish song. Lacks the real intrigue and bold production

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): “cat eye sharp enough to kill a man” is an enjoyable line in isolation, but Taylor doesn’t quite have the right charisma that would sell me on it. The rest of it is an awful mess of one liners meant to be used in vague posts being volleyed between two equally toxic friends, backed by lo fi hip hop beats to study to

**horridhendy** (1): It's a no. This is only saved from the 0 by Midnight Rain being worse.

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): it’s impossible for me to take this song seriously

**Mudkip1** (1): Jesus christ

**Nagisoid** (1): Girlie feeding her gaylor fans well by forcing them to listen to the worst song in the album if they want to hear a vague reference to queerness with the "I don't dress for women line" what a girlboss.

**nooodisaster** (1): First out? A girl can hope!

**RandomHypnotica** (1): don't cut yourself on all that edge emo queen

**shhhneak** (1): Fighting for my life to hit skip before she finishes that first lyric.

**shipperondeck** (1): not my 0 because it's thankfully over quickly

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): hey she said it was shit not me

=====

ImADudeDuh: #Yeah, you knew this was gonna need it's own section

**1998tweety** (0): taylor PLEASE stop thinking youre a badass

**akanewasright** (0): I’ve refused to listen to this since the week album dropped, I just hear “draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man” and involuntarily hit skip. I listened to it for this and… man. The fact that this is the one song on the album Taylor wrote alone is embarrassing as hell

**apatel27** (0): who are you trying to fool

**avg-vag** (0): sweet n low cosplay of billie eilish that should have stayed in the vault

**beyzxzhen** (0): yeah it's gonna be a no from me on this one

**bulforster** (0): I mean the title's half right

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): shit is right

**CrimsonROSET** (0): ah. yeah this is just as bad as everyone says, not even the instrumentation can save it (even if I don’t know what the fuck people are smoking calling this Billie)

**DirtyRat583** (0): this is so lazy

**dreamingpastel** (0): Fight or flight when I hear "Draw a cat eye, sharp enough to kill a man"

**fairytalehigh** (0): reputation taylor keeps popping up on each subsequent album like the blackout drunk girl at the party who is always a shitshow and who everyone keeps calling an uber for who instead of going home just keeps running away down the street shoeless and sending weird texts to the groupchat before showing back up at the house AGAIN looking more and more bedraggled and sweaty each time before finally passing out in a chair by the door holding her cigarettes

**frogaranaman** (0): Now what the fuck was this . Respectfully

**ignitethephoenix** (0): This is Billie Eilish for people who are scared of teenagers

**jasannn** (0): her worst song ever and I’m a Reputation defender. The instrumental is boringly sparse and there is no melody there present to cover the terrible edgy lyrics. an immediate skip everytime

**MassiveThief** (0): I heard the leak and thought "no WAY this is real. someone faked this for sure!" but no here we are. I would believe it's a Billie Eilish parody.

**MasterWizardRyan** (0): what was taylor's thought process when she made this?

**moonshxne** (0): very awkward billie cosplay that's not even at least interesting. honestly, not only is this boring, this is awful

**MrMoodle** (0): wow they stretched justin bieber’s bad guy feature into a full song

**musical\_pyn** (0): possibly the easiest 0 I've ever given

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (0): this is the worst Billie Eilish song I’ve ever heard. Yes, even worse than the Bad Guy remix.

**nick1372** (0): I don't need to explain why Taylor trying to make a 2019-era Billie Eilish song is bad right

**nootnoot781** (0): i know the song is about killing people, but did she have to make sound like terrorism too?

**oscarbrierley1** (0): for my sanity im going to presume this is supposed to be ironic. Theres no way this is serious. It throws every white girl millennial stereotype into one song.

**passionfruits2** (0): reputation ass sounding track. i like taylor but reputation is a top10 cringiest albums of all time, rivaling Limp Bizkit's entire catalogue, and Nickelback's Greatest Hits too.

**pastapixal** (0): this song just feels like it's cosplaying as something badass.

**pheromenos** (0): kill me now

**PhoneThePhoenix** (0): this is not Taylor's wheelhouse to me. she pretty much already did the concept and the song is super uninteresting

**poemforsmallthings** (0): :(

**popularsong** (0): full body cringe shudder

**ReallyCreative** (0): this is the worst song of her career. She should have called it Absolute Shit, because then we could say it’s a conceptual song and applaud her accurate and precise execution. I genuinely do not understand how anyone can put this song above any other song in her career. This is like asking AI to generate a song with the keywords “high school aged nepo baby bedroom pop artist scrapped SoundCloud demo” and hitting generate before waiting exactly seven seconds for an output

**samross789** (0): one of the worst songs taylor has ever released it physically makes me cringe

**sebgup** (0): I'm sorry I'm a hardcore fan but we have to admit that this is a career low

**Shelly\_AO29** (0): The worst song on this album by far. Taylor just isn't convincing as a vigilante. The song is also so low energy. If you want to sell yourself as a bad bitch that gets revenge on worthless men, at least make the song have some attitude! Some bite! This is toothless!

**slimboyfriend** (0): billie eilish Z-side

**sweetnsoursauce11** (0): god this is so fucking cringe i can't believe she opened with that line, it was cringe when i was 18 on 2014 tumblr and it's cringe now. this song had no business seeing the light of day in 2022

**thedoctordances1940** (0): I don't want to have to 0 this because it seems like such an obvious 0 and in a way that isn't really all that fun but like... i'm just absolutely baffled by how this managed to get past the cutting room floor, it's so obviously laughably bad. "Vigilante shit" in general is a bad concept for basically artist if it's not in some way tongue-in-cheek, but for taylor it's an especially terrible choice, it's a worse choice than basically anything she did for Reputation even

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): taylor you will never be batman

**TiltControls** (0): This sounds like it could've been plucked right from reputation. I did not like reputation

**vexastrae** (0): question...? and vigilante shit being right next to each other is like being punched in the face while drunk and then immediately being kicked off a 20-foot drop onto a concrete floor

**wasian-invasion** (0): someone needs to remake the ace nicki moodboard for taylor with the i dont dress for women i dont dress for men line and bad photoshops of her hair dyed like the asexual pride flag  anyways i feel like we as a society have moved past using the word cringe but this is cringe

**xqra** (0): we are going to pretend we didn't hear that!

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I gave this a 7/10 but I can not defend it.

**impla77** (2): This song just confuses me, I can’t really comprehend this situation because it just seems bizarre. Just too specific to paint a picture for me, which leaves me unengaged, along with the plodding verses and uninspired production. Giving a point for the use of dickhead, an insult underutilised in the music medium, hope it starts a trend.

#Why? (is this so good)

**IIIHenryIII** (10): for the culture (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault) (with Lana Del Rey)

**letsallpoo** (10): this is the best song on the midnights standard edition and i will not be silenced any longer!!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I think the only reason I like this song is from hearing a 5 second snippet every week for like 12 weeks in the ph chart videos but it worked

**runaway3212** (10): More artists should sample their own songs it's such a power move

**shhhneak** (10): THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM GET BEHIND ME!!

**vayyiqra** (10): Did you ever have someone kiss you in a Crowded room, baby it's just me and you, yeah, baby it's just me and you, baby it's just me and you, just us two, even in a crowded room, baby it's just me and you, yeah 😌

**fairytalehigh** (9.1): the chorus is cheesy in a glorious cinematic kind of way, like jack and rose kissing at the grand staircase at the end of titanic

**wasian-invasion** (9): there was this guy at my college that would always go up to people walking to class saying "scuse me boss can i ask you a question" then try to get you to donate to his fake charity. anyways now i kinda miss him

**rfbeirut** (8): still dont really understand whats going on in the chorus but the end of the second verse is more perfect bratty taylor vocals

**FlavaSavaVandal** (7.5): I once saw someone in the daily discussion have a “crisis” over this song existing because the writing is just that bad. I thought it was kinda funny to be that much over a song that’s like fine.

**udontwannaknownoel** (7.2): I have no idea what she's saying during that bridge, but isn't it fun? Aside from the bridge the production is kinda blah

**jasannn** (7): where’s the bass boosted version??

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): Better, but Taylor Swift swearing just doesn't sound right to me. It's like a child that just picked up a swear word and keeps using it to seem mature.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.9): the most notable thing about this song is when she got nervous during release week when this wasn't going top 10 and panic dropped like 5 purchases for this

#Why? (is this so bad)

**1998tweety** (6): and then everyone clapped

**avg-vag** (6): this doesn’t seem like one of those times taylor is laughing at herself but i absolutely laughed - the crowd cheering is worth a whole extra point

**CrimsonROSET** (6): I don’t know Taylor can you

**ignitethephoenix** (6): “and they all clapped” the song

**intheaftermath** (6): i don't know what to make of this one. Sometimes I love the chorus. Other times, I find it annoying and repetitive and shut it off like 40 seconds in. It's wildly inconsistent.

**jsonphile** (6): to answer your question Taylor, definitely no

**Kayaking11116** (6): this one is ok, when the instrumentals pick up it sounds nice

**Lilacly\_Adily** (6): every time I hear this song I think of ‘I Wish You Would’ which is a superior song

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): I think she sampled “Out of the Woods” on this, that song is so good.

**nooodisaster** (6): Taylor has a bad habit of bluntly singing like one note. See: Goregeous. And this.

**nt96** (6): it asked, but I did not answer

**poemforsmallthings** (6): and then everyone clapped.mp3

**Roxieloxie** (6): this is just twitter

**slimboyfriend** (6): subtracting 5 points for these filler lyrics but adding a point for the stupid little ad-libs

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): this song clicked with me a little bit yesterday so i'm upping it to a 6 bc the melody in the chorus is actually quite nice

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.7): yes Taylor, that happened to me once. I didn’t pay it any mind.

**Bordersz** (5.5): This song is so cheesy like written by a 15 year old girl.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.5): Lana Del Rey in May 21, 2020:

**jman457** (5.5): This middle part of the album is such a SLOG

**starla\_** (5.5): this is like if an AI wrote a Taylor Swift song

**babadork** (5.4): I dislike the lyrics of this song the way that most people dislike the lyrics to “Anti-Hero.”

**PhoneThePhoenix** (5.4): ultimately this is forgettable to me but I like situations/circumstances/miscommunications line.

**bogo** (5): that chorus is like one of those "and then everyone clapped" tumblr posts

**DevilsOfLoudun** (5): I don't get what this song is about beyond some kind of vague "thinking about my ex" situation

**dreamingpastel** (5): Enemies to Stockholm Syndrome arc, but it's this song showing up on my Spotify Wrapped at number 27.

**heysoupie** (5): nothing interesting to see here

**jaztinax** (5): the gaylors ruined this song for me

**modulum83** (5): she googled 1989 Taylor Swift Type Free Instrumental Royalty Free on youtube and recorded on top of it

**passionfruits2** (5): this album has so many corny song titles

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I don’t care Becky

**TheQueenofVultures** (4.5): this is a testament to taylor's ability to ruin a song with a few terrible lyrics she thinks are really clever

**thedoctordances1940** (4.4): I mean, at least it's not a question for the culture

**daythreeinmiami** (4): I want to know what kind of friends make fun of you then 15 seconds later clap as you’re kissing lel Taylor I’m asking you this question.

**masttup** (4): and then everyone in the Starbucks clapped

**mimins** (4): again, boring and dislike her singing voice

**MrMoodle** (4): weird chorus and awkward drum kits on the back end

**oscarbrierley1** (4): hate the instrumental, it gives bargain bin carly rae jepsen. The autotune part is atrocious.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): she curses like a six year old imitating things they heard their parents watching on tv

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (4): running theme of this album is the clunky, word salad lyrics and this song is the poster child for that. it's decently catchy, which is its only saving grace

**aakar528** (3): why tf am i listening to these lyrics?

**frogaranaman** (3): Taylor’s friends should make fun of her more often

**horridhendy** (3): Question: is this a good song? Not really.

**moonshxne** (3): the question in question makes no sense but is kinda funny tho. also, not them actually including cheers 💀 if the song actually sounded good this mightve been iconic

**plastichaxan** (3): This should’ve been the Lana feature

**shipperondeck** (3): everyone said this is particularly weak but it seems fine in comparison to everything else here

**Stryxen** (3): she sounds so bored I'm crying. She does NOT like this song

**TiltControls** (3): If you ignore all the lyrics this isn't actually half bad

**DaHumanTorch** (2.5): this chorus was so overstuffed with syllables it literally had 2 bpm (breaths per minute)

**MoonlightByWindow** (2.5): meh

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Oh lord she really pulled out the “and then everybody clapped” on this one.

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): those like... crescendo moments are so annoying actually, same w the sound effects in the last chorus like in general this song is just unpleasant

**Hulnia** (2): why listen to this when out of the woods is right there

**jonnl2806** (2): I don't get this song at all, it literally makes no sense

**Nagisoid** (2): The best part of this song is the 1 second sample of the "I remember" from Out of the Woods, let that sink in.

**ReallyCreative** (1.5): I have several, first of all, how dare you?

ImADudeDuh: #Just fucking why?

**AHSWeeknd** (1): the production here only makes the pettiness of the lyrics worse

**akanewasright** (1): GOD this is painfully overwritten

**aldwin\_is\_here** (1): can I have a question? why is this 1989-reject here when it could've been scrapped off the tracklist.

**Awkward\_King** (1): the most fucking stupid ridiculous lyrics ive ever heard in my life like...? the worst and then everybody clapped story ever.

**cremeebrulee** (1): can i asked you a question... what the fuck is this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): the kind of run-on thinking song structure happening here (while I get what she’s going for) makes this song sound like a demo and pretty slapdash, unfinished.

**MassiveThief** (1): i mean come on, these lyrics are genuinely awful. the song is an absolute nothing, made infinitely worse by this "and then everyone clapped!!!!!" chorus.

**MasterWizardRyan** (1): oh my gosh, this song just irritates me. The boring ass production, the weak-ass hook, the lyrics, her singing, the cheering at the last chorus... Choices.

**nick1372** (1): Bad concept for a song in the first place, but what puts it over the top is that it would be SO much better if the lyrics on the chorus slightly changed every time, to fit the narrative going on. That's a CLASSIC taylor technique, yet she just doesn't here? Why not?

**popularsong** (1): man listening to this is just making me realize im sick of jack antonoffs style im so bored

**vexastrae** (1): the question being "why do they call it oven when you of in the cold food of out hot eat the food"

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (0): Terminally arrhythmic tumblr fakepost-core garbage

**joeeswift** (0): Just meh…I don’t know what else to say about this song :-(

**just\_thonking** (0): And that person.... was Albert Einstein

**lexiaredery** (0): I can't stand the bridge

**seanderlust** (0): can i ask you a question? have you ever been walking down the sidewalk, talking about something meaningless - You think it had to do with a movie - Then this bus screeches up, stops next to you, and a bunch of people with “Down with Cis” shirts climb out and started beating him up? Were you punched and kicked a bit too, but you managed to avoid brutalization by going for their faces? After figuring out what’s happening, Did you start attacking them back, getting them off of him? Was he quite injured but you called 911 and he made a full recovery at the hospital? Were you fine, with only a cut on your arm that they patched up? Then what did you do? It's just a question.

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): d-list young adult drama on netflix awkward kid leaving the party getting on the bus looking out the window as flashbacks happen type song

**Uberpigeon** (0): girl i have a fucking question. how the fuck did no one stop her from writing the worst lyrics to a song i have ever heard. that's my question

**UselessTacooo** (0): the royalty free cheering effects 😭😭😭

**impla77** (7): Yeah, I rated this one too highly, I was trying to give Taylor the benefit of the doubt. Seems almost rushed?

**ImADudeDuh** (3): This sounds like it would be a creepy cover of a pop song used for a horror movie soundtrack. It's unsettling but I don't know how much of it is intentionally unsettling and how much is just shit production.

---

#Glitchpop? More like Glitch = BOP

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Jack Antonoff gave her a regular brownie, but told her there was pot in it, then she recorded this.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): false god who?

**passionfruits2** (10): I DONT KNOW BUT THIS SONG JUST TICKLES MY BRAIN IT'S SO GOOD. out of nowhere this worthless deluxe is all worth it.

**TiltControls** (10): I fully expect this to flop - and I get it - the production really sounds like a mess here and that one 'Glitch' might have more of an issue with 'pitch', but the trailing of the chorus just does something to my brain

**starla\_** (9): I think there's been a glitch in my brain cos this isn't even that good of a song but I love it so much

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): this had high replay value for me

**1998tweety** (8.5): this had to grow on me but its good now, although a bit short

**avg-vag** (8.5): this doesn’t go far enough but enjoying this direction

**emayzee** (8.4): this is the most interesting song on this album

**Frajer** (8): Vanellope rights

**modulum83** (8): this is the exact kind of sound i want from her but points taken off for using “situationship,” the most evil word we have recently coined into the english language

**rfbeirut** (8): a song that actually sounds like 3am

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): maybe one of her most experimental tracks production-wise and it works pretty well!

**fairytalehigh** (7.8): mid song with overwritten verses ("glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground," oof) salvaged somewhat by one of the weirder productions in her catalogue

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): this is boring, like cool, you had sex, I'm a virgin, stop talking about your so-go-you-lagged-out climax because I'm so jealous.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): like the production here

**daythreeinmiami** (7): The fact she used the TikTok glitch from her ‘Wildest Dreams’ video. But also the fact this *isn’t* on the main album? Ugh, I think there has been a glitch.

**jonnl2806** (7): There's something missing in this song to make it great I just don't know that is

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): taylor when she hears [this tiktok audio](https://www.tiktok.com/@hermione.editzzz/video/7206119072159862058?lang=en)

#Softlocked my taste

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): me after booting up some shovelware i impulse bought months ago

**udontwannaknownoel** (6.6): It's a glitch that it made the album cut instead of Hits Different

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is nice but it’s no experimental post-industrial masterpiece like Closure was.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): COME AMD GO!

**masttup** (6): me when I walk into the kitchen and forget why I was there

**Nagisoid** (6): She's hustling hard for that Ubisoft promo

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): I kinda like the lofi drums here

**PhoneThePhoenix** (5.9): glitch sounds like a fun song title but then it's this! I mean, there's nothing wrong with this. really it's fine!!

**akanewasright** (5.5): idk what to make of this so I’m not giving it a real score

**intheaftermath** (5): it's just boring. say what you want about folklovermore but they at least weren't boring

**jsonphile** (5): this song feels like a glitch on an otherwise pretty solid set of bonus tracks

**Kayaking11116** (5): some parts I don't like as much, but the chorus is ok (the part that goes "And I'm not even sorry, Nights are so starry, blood moonlit" is carrying like Atlas carrying the heavens in Greek mythology)

**moonshxne** (5): why does this sound kinda farty lol

**Mudkip1** (5): this felt like it was 5 mins long

**nick1372** (5): missed opportunity for a Taylor Swift hyperpop song tbh. Wouldn't even be out of place on this album.

**Poydoo** (5): I was hoping this would be an actual glitch-pop song but nope it's just another Taylor song

**seanderlust** (5): what if taylor had made a song called glitch and gone full [laura les](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=879ysA4h9r4) or [alice longyu gao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UE7su35p8o) production with it

**Shelly\_AO29** (5): It's alright, something different. But why do I feel like the lyrics are so clumsy? Like she's spitting them out.

**shipperondeck** (5): this would be good if someone else sung it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): she wants to be charli xcx so bad

**thedoctordances1940** (5): this is hauntology

**vexastrae** (5): kinda cute

**wasian-invasion** (5): maybe its just deluxe-version-phobia but these just dont feel necessary

**frogaranaman** (4): she had every opportunity to go hyperpop with this song. sad

**just\_thonking** (4): With this name I was expecting a hyperpop masterpiece tbh

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): I’m not feeling her

**nooodisaster** (4): Omg this song felt like 3 hours

**poppinmmolly** (4): garbage

**ReallyCreative** (4): imagine if she did a proper glitch pop song… it probably wouldn’t be very good but I’d respect it

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): If you dare to name your song “Glitch” and then not put chiptunes into it then don’t talk to me

**jman457** (3.6): I really hate this, my least favorite of the 3am tracks

**plastichaxan** (3.5): She should literally be the last person to call a song Glitch I’m kinda offended

**cremeebrulee** (3): it's been 2190 days since this album started

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): that 3-second intro made me think we were actually getting something exciting

**nt96** (3): it's giving blue screen of death

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): no need to rate 2022 glitch pop after this, take that yeule fans

**Birdseeding** (2): Now the harmonies are breaking down too, the entire album is unraveling

**mimins** (2): running out of ways to say that this album is a snoozefest

**aakar528** (1): what is going on

**Awkward\_King** (1): these rhymes are absolutely killing me im sorry like even she is better than this!!!

**Hulnia** (1): hyperpop masterpiece!!

**MassiveThief** (1): horribly put together. jack, you're a genius but sometimes i wonder what goes on in your mind.

**Uberpigeon** (1): what are you talking about

**throwaway-7650** (0): hosts? there's a mistake in the ballot, I don't see this in the tracklist?

#ngl I don't know who this is

**vayyiqra** (8): It's not as good as Kwon Eun-bi but then again, what is 😌 Loving the meta concept here! get it the song is called Glitch and it is glitchy

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): eunbi outsold outserved outwigged

**runaway3212** (6): Eunbi outsold

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): stream 2022 kpop rate winner glitch by kwon eun bi

**Stryxen** (5): give kwon eunbi your 11s in 2022 kpop

**bulforster** (4.1): she wants to be eunbi so bad but she just can't compete

**bogo** (1): girl you aren't kwon eun-bi get out of here

**popularsong** (1): stream glitch by eunbi instead

**ImADudeDuh** (6): You know it’s bad when The Chainsmokers’ song of the same title has better lyrics

**impla77** (2.5): Most egregious rhyme on the album: Paris with somewhere else. I also think this song suffers from the same thing ‘Question…?’ does where Taylor is just writing about a boring conversation.. like I get its supposed to be boring and vapid but it also seems to imply she would be into this conversation if she wasn’t annoyingly obsessed with her boyfriend (another can of worms). Also the shade lines?? Can you retire that word pls Taylor, you always use it terribly. Anyway, writing this I have come to the conclusion that I need to lower my score

---

#Oui Oui Baguette

**AHSWeeknd** (10): she listens to this and said “hmmm, what a fun song! it doesn’t deserve to be on the standard version, unlike Vigilante Shit” then went on with her day like “La-Di-Da!!1!”

**PSSST12** (10): "I wanna brainwash you into loving me forever" Is the realest shit she ever said. Like shes so me coded

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i thought this song would be more popular on popheads bc it gives me 1989 vibes

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): one of her best pop tracks in ages it's true it's true!

**vayyiqra** (10): It's cool how the synths on a lot of the bonus tracks are almost ambient but then this has this upbeat drum pattern 😌

**shhhneak** (9.9): Did this get reuploaded as an actual good song since the last time I listened? I remember hating this at first. A fun first verse, for once.

**1998tweety** (9): we love a 1989 outtake

**dreamingpastel** (9): It's a cute song BUT, for more than one reason, I need Taylor to unlearn the phrase "throwing shade"

**nootnoot781** (9): much like the city of paris, midnights™️ i something you really want to check out and then when you get there you find it's really underwhelming... her easter eggs are truly unmatched.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The bop of the whole 3am edition is... this song, yes, nothing else, pack it up kids!

**modulum83** (8.4): this song is the audio manifestation of that one image of taylor swift wearing that The 1975 shirt

**DaHumanTorch** (8): now why is this random 1989'd bop a bonus track

**fairytalehigh** (8): DAE wanna time travel to paris in the 1940s??????

**Nagisoid** (8): The brainwash part is teasing A Clockwork Orange (Taylor's Version) mark my words.

**poppinmmolly** (8): Your ex friend's SISTER met someone at a club and he KISSED HER??!?

**Shelly\_AO29** (8): Really like this one. It actually does make me feel like I'm in Paris.

**Frajer** (7.5): she has a lot of nerve saying 2003 unbearable

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.5): something something you could have walked to paris

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7.5): it’s fine

**jman457** (7.1): I didn’t like this at first but it grew on me

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): ew, a sudden french reference.

**avg-vag** (7): cute in 2014

**horridhendy** (7): Fun but nothing special

**seanderlust** (7): here's a sentence i never get to say: the chainsmokers outsold

**slimboyfriend** (7): like we were in Detroit <3

#Enemies of the French

**udontwannaknownoel** (6.9): Should've been more horny

**emayzee** (6.8): "2003 unbearable" call it what it is: tisdalecore

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): she literally just admitted she wants to brainwash us hello

**Poydoo** (6.5): We did it, we finally found out who was in Paris

**heysoupie** (6.3): algorithmic pop

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): it's cute but missing a lil something

**masttup** (6): if u get bored of Paris catch a train to the next town over: somewheris

**PhoneThePhoenix** (6): nothing special but far from the worst song named paris!

**rfbeirut** (6): chorus is fun good 2003 ref but not my fav

**starla\_** (6): we were staying in Paris to get away from your parents

**hikk** (5.5): the shade line sends so bad like what was she thinking... too bad the chorus is so nothing

**daythreeinmiami** (5): I’ve never been to Paris so I can’t relate. I’m Australian, so I’ll pretend it’s like, Sydney.

**Stryxen** (5): oh how I'd love to go Paris- Paris again and again and again and again

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): the ex-friend's sister? Karin Dreijer.

**CrimsonROSET** (4): very Emily in Paris

**jasannn** (4): BAMDUMDUMDUM CHEAP WINE

**Kayaking11116** (4): not my vibe

**mimins** (4): annoying but at least i felt something

**moonshxne** (4): taylor must think she's so qUiRky

**passionfruits2** (4): (to the beat of this song) you should be embarassed! going from folklore and evermore to this is a fall from grace for sure.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Girl just get on your private jet and fly there

**vexastrae** (4): girl i hate to say it but that slant rhyme in the chorus does not work

**bulforster** (3.8): that shade line... this is todrick hall's fault I just know it

**xqra** (3.7): Chorus was giving Maroon for me and I hated that one, so this gets knocked down a lot for that, also not a fan lyrically

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): i have to appreciate this on some level of camp! i do think it is bad but it would be a fun 1989 track in the same way welcome to new york is!

**lexiaredery** (3.5): The underwear tree is my fave

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): Paris syndrome (French: syndrome de Paris; Japanese: パリ症候群, romanized: Pari shōkōgun) is a sense of extreme disappointment exhibited by some individuals when visiting Paris, who feel that the city was not what they had expected. The condition is commonly viewed as a severe form of culture shock. The syndrome is characterized by a number of psychiatric symptoms such as acute delusional states, hallucinations, feelings of persecution (perceptions of being a victim of prejudice, aggression, hostility from others), derealization, depersonalization, anxiety, as well as psychosomatic manifestations such as dizziness, tachycardia, sweating most notably, but also others, such as vomiting.

**Birdseeding** (3): This album, quite the opposite of Renaissance, just keeps getting weaker and weaker. This is like a shitty throwaway Disney TV song

**Hulnia** (3): first verse is funny but this kinda drags on lol

**wasian-invasion** (3): rhyming paris with somewhere else is a war crime (also ha she said underwear)

**aakar528** (2.5): okay so?

**bookthieving** (2): petition for taylor swift to stop talking about shade

**dream\_fighter2018** (2): I am stuck in a reader insert fanfic written by Taylor Swift and cannot get out

**just\_thonking** (2): Somehow worse than Welcome to New York

**nt96** (2): it choked on a moldy baguette

**shipperondeck** (2): i feel like she's made this song before

**Uberpigeon** (2): girl i wish u were somewhere else

**ReallyCreative** (1.7): this is just corny and bad and chaotic

**akanewasright** (1): Wow, this is everything I hate about some of the standard edition songs in one place - with the added bonus of “in Paris” and “somewhere else” being the core rhyme of the song

**amr** (1): sure yeah

**apatel27** (1): The worst offender on the album of squeezing lyrics into a space they don't fit

**cremeebrulee** (1): the 1975 outsold

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): woops okay we’re back to songs I don’t care for. I don’t like the lyrics here or the beat.

**nick1372** (1): Songs like this are so easy to fuck up. This is basically the same as "I Think He Knows" except everything about that song is incredible and everything about this song is absolutely awful . The only real differences are worse melodies and worse lyrics--what the fuck is that line about shade but not the kind that's thrown?

**popularsong** (1): man i really hope the next 5 songs stop making me miserable with the spaced out production w some reverb or ill have to cry. i feel like im hearing the same song 10 times. my adhd is tormenting me w the understimulation rn

**runaway3212** (0): this is about worse than ME!

#Yeah... about that...

**welcome2thejam** (10): She said no "Chainsmokers outsold" comments tonight

#Taylor Swift want to be The Chainsmokers so bad

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I’m afraid to say it but The Chainsmokers outsold

**TiltControls** (8): paging The Chainsmokers for their thoughts

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): this being the same way of using paris as an escapist metaphor than the chainsmokers used kinda sends

**ignitethephoenix** (7): chainsmokers did it better

**intheaftermath** (6.5): better than the Chainsmokers at the very least

**jsonphile** (6.5): …chainsmokers outsold….?

**bogo** (4): the chainsmokers outsold

**thedoctordances1940** (3.4): genuinely outsold by the chainsmokers (although based on my opinion of the chainsmokers that's actually not as much of a damning statement as it really should be)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): The Chainsmokers outsold VASTLY.

**DraculaWeekend** (3): And I thought the Chainsmokers' Paris was bad

**frogaranaman** (1): legit embarrassing when The Chainsmokers outsell

**impla77** (2.6): Not a good album closer, unless its a asmr album and you want to send people to sleep by the last song

**ImADudeDuh** (2): This, huh? This is what you choose to end the album on, Taylor? This slow ass song who's only highlight is the fact that it might reference Legally Blonde of all things?

#Studious

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “No I don’t think I’ll put this one on the album, it’s too layered and deep for an album that’s meant to explore those late-night thoughts. Bejeweled will work perfectly fine instead.”

**DaHumanTorch** (10): SOOO underrated and top 3 on the album for me

**dreamingpastel** (10): Fantastic closer! The best one across all the different Midnights editions.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (10): I’m a big fan of Taylor getting drunk and telling her fanbase to go fuck themselves, they really deserve it

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this song is a goldmine for swifties who are in tattoos

**Poydoo** (10): Probably the best 3am song

**runaway3212** (10): I have to save this from last place it's not that bad

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): im giving this a 10 mostly because id feel a little bit bad if i didnt give at least one song on here a 10, but also i just genuinely love when songs break the fourth wall and talk to the audience like this

**vayyiqra** (10): now this is ambient pop 😌

**UselessTacooo** (9.6): 💗

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): that soft synth noise in the verses reminds me of donna lewis' "i love you always forever" and it almost gets a 10 for that alone

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.3): begrudgingly admitting bend when you can and snap when you have to is clever. I like how straightforward this is.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): this is a better closing track than Mastermind and thank god it exists, also, you can't convince people to not stop listening to you when you made stans exist.

**poemforsmallthings** (9): one of her best tracks lyrically, very underrated

**modulum83** (8.5): congratulations to this song for finally making me able to sympathize with taylor “private jet” swift

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): god 21 songs is so tiring but i actually really like this one

**sebgup** (8.2): I'm sorry but this particular bridge needs more recognition

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): you are NOT charli xcx do not use autotune like that

**udontwannaknownoel** (7.8): The harmonies alone outsold Glitch and V*gilante Shit

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): she got confused which medium she was using

**TiltControls** (7.5): It's cute enough - wish there was a little more to it, but it's nice

**1998tweety** (7): everyone else about this song is literally a 10 but the "dear reader" line sounds so clunky and the fact she repeats it so much just makes me not wanna listen to this song

**Birdseeding** (7): Finally picks up a bit with a good R&B-esque backing track, pitch shift madness and more Richard X-style arpeggios.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): well who’s gonna tell her

**heysoupie** (7): lyrically interesting, musically kind of dull

**jasannn** (7): if taylor made track 10

**passionfruits2** (7): wraps it up nicely

**Stryxen** (7): good but forgot it entirely as soon as it ended - i love the vocal effects but my only complaint is quite a few of the melodies are just dull and hold it back from being great

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): i kinda like this better as a closing track than Mastermind - a stronger song of self-reflection IMO

**vexastrae** (6.5): okay this one is actually kinda decent

#[These people](https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2014/11/glee-lea-michele1.jpg)

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6.5): yawn

**jman457** (6.4): Its cute just wish there was more here

**ignitethephoenix** (6): snooze

**jonnl2806** (6): I rewatched Legally Blonde last night and I'm pretty sure Taylor did too before writing this song

**nooodisaster** (6): Generic yet appropriate ending to an album

**avg-vag** (5.5): what an absolute slog. taylor is telling her fans she’s an unreliable narrator but in a boring track so they won’t actually get the message.

**horridhendy** (5.5): Meh

**Bordersz** (5): Meh. Bad closer to the album, she should have stopped at would've could've should've.

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): please help, Taylor has me in her basement and she didn’t leave me any water

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): average fanfic writer

**jaztinax** (5): ngl this sounds like the average of every track on this album

**MrMoodle** (5): aaaaaaaaand back to our regularly scheduled washed out snooze pop

**rfbeirut** (5): stfu

**Shelly\_AO29** (5): I've heard her do this song better before *cough*Dress*cough*

**starla\_** (5): this has potential to be good but is boring

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): honestly this could have ended with would've could've should've and gone out with a bang but no we had to tag this onto the end

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4.8): snooze (not the sza kind)

**daythreeinmiami** (4.7): It’s fine but to me the production has always sounded like Midnight Rain. Maybe that’s on purpose, who knows.

**thedoctordances1940** (4.6): this is egregiously boring

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): very... outro-y and could've been like half as long

**mimins** (4): barely remember how this one sounds

**plastichaxan** (4): I don’t know how to read

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Dear Taylor, No ❤️ Love, u/Verboten_Prince

**xqra** (4): Had to listen like 5 times because it wouldn't register in my brain. I’m thrown off by the autotune in some parts when her voice is lower, I wish her voice was left alone more and not so overproduced

**nick1372** (3.5): what does this even mean

**shhhneak** (3.3): The very last lyric in this album is “you should find another” and if that doesn’t summarize this album I don’t know what does. Maybe I WILL take advice from someone who’s falling apart/falling in love.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): I appreciate the self-awareness but this is BORING.

**frogaranaman** (3): https://twitter.com/caucasianjames/status/1630423808606875650 what I ended up reading from this song

**intheaftermath** (3): someone known for their lyricism should know that 47 "dear readers" is too many

**masttup** (3): Matt Rogers and Bowen yang pen a letter to the kayteighs

**oscarbrierley1** (3): sounds like half the other songs on the album. Feels really unnecessary at this point.

**Uberpigeon** (3): shes talking to me because ive been reading her

**amr** (2.5): finishing off strong for sure

**Kayaking11116** (2.5): mehhhboninaffjewoa not a good way to end the album ;-;-;

**aakar528** (2): don't have to listen to this again

**MassiveThief** (2): that autotune... you'll never be 100 gecs taylor

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): meh

**Nagisoid** (2): Dear reader, please don't fall asleep to this snooze

**nt96** (2): I'm Lea Michelle

**Awkward\_King** (1): i think a lot of my hate for this album does come from swift over-exposure which i would not usually hold against the artist themself but in her case it is entirely her fault and the least you can do when you're so overexposed is still put out good music for it to be critically re-evaluated years on!! but this is just bad!!

**cremeebrulee** (1): who asked for this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): why does this sound like it was recorded with taylor singing in a cellar. then the pre-chorus has vocal processing i think flattens it

**popularsong** (1): aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa okay its fine im FREEEEEE

**ImADudeDuh** (6): This song grew on me a bit throughout hosting this. I mean, it grew to a 6/10 but that's still growth. I just find the phrase of "oh no, I'm falling in love again" very charming. Oh nevermind I heard the elevator line again, defense called off.

**impla77** (5.5): hmm.. I may have caught slow song phobia from being on popheads for too long but I just find this dull.

---

#The Minotaur

**IIIHenryIII** (11): am I just wasting my 11? Yes, sure, but at least I got taste

**FlavaSavaVandal** (10): every time I listen to this album, this hits like a ton of bricks, where every recent insecurity and anxiety just bubbles to the surface and the rest of the world stops existing, idk when this song snuck up on me and became that but it did. I dont exactly know when this became my second favourite song on the album but I fell for this song hard

**modulum83** (10): don’t let your balladphobia prevent you from realizing this is the Midnights song with the most unique identity, interesting songwriting choices, and distinctive sense of risk-taking. stay woke.

**runaway3212** (10): the beat to this just fully moaning and nobody acknowledging it like

**Stryxen** (10): idk why I love this song but I do

**TiltControls** (10): It took a while to grow on me, but this is the other main tracklist song I'll go to bat for defending

**vayyiqra** (10): So pretty 😌

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): ooh the bells and ascending bloops im here for it

**jonnl2806** (9): Love Jack's little production choices all over the song and of course the distorted vocals

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is cute

**shhhneak** (8.5): She thinks she’s Cocteau Twins 😂 unless? 😳

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): i just googled it and apparently elevator anxiety can be treated via exposure therapy so theres still hope taylor

**jman457** (8.2): underrated gem

**Birdseeding** (8): more pitch shift goodness, this has some real sharpness and some individual moments of great poignancy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I can’t decide for sure whether or not this is boring…I’m giving her the benefit of uncertainty cause god knows she’ll need it.

**heysoupie** (8): really, really cool production minus the weird Justin Bieber “Sorry” sounds

**nooodisaster** (8): WAIT I FORGOT HOW FUCKING STUPID THE ELEVATOR LINE WAS SJNFSKHFSKFJSK

**RandomHypnotica** (8): I'm not surprised you thought the plane was going down Taylor, with how much you fly in that thing you're tempting fate

**rfbeirut** (8): love the synths

**sufjancaesar** (8): the bridge is kinda beautiful tbh

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): an under-the-radar favorite of mine. production is great, but some less repetitive lyrics would take it to the next level

**udontwannaknownoel** (8): Very vulnerable and genuine. Love the weird touches to the production

**moonshxne** (7.9): the sudden pitch-shifted jumpscare detracts, but this is by and far the best cut of the standard edition

**avg-vag** (7.5): this would hit so much harder with some depth in the production

**jasannn** (7.5): Kinda funny that uh oh, oh no and oh are some her best lyrics on this project

**seanderlust** (7.5): i really love when taylor's lyrics show their experience in love and she sounds a little jaded yet surprised she is still capable of falling in love.

**DaHumanTorch** (7.3): the question...? in question is who was moaning at the beginning of this and throughout the song in the background

**fairytalehigh** (7.2): SLAP THAT BABY SET HIM FREEEEEEEEEEEE

#More like a maze on a kid's menu

**Poydoo** (7): Easily the best of the boring forgettable filler in the second half of the album

**ReallyCreative** (7): a nice break from one of the most mediocre stretches in Taylor’s career

**slimboyfriend** (7): I’ve never met an elevator I liked

**PhoneThePhoenix** (6.4): it's fine! can kind of stare of into space about it

**Awkward\_King** (6): my take on midnights is that these are genuinely the songs that didnt make it onto their original albums and also aren't good enough to be vault tracks, and she's then managed to brand this as some concept album of stories when in reality people are eating up her bottom of the barrel of the material. having said that, this is clearly a folklore cut and it is nice!!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): am I going crazy or is that the midnight city synth

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): this is fine, somewhat drab production and then the one loud synth trill is fine but random

**Nagisoid** (6): I remember back when Midnights leaked people said that the weird voice in the intro was Jack Antonoff moaning

**poppinmmolly** (6): growing on me but I hate thr production

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): i can never look at this song the same after someone said it sounds like jack antonoff is getting his ass clapped in the beginning

**thedoctordances1940** (6): sure it's pretty enough

**UselessTacooo** (6): me when im an elephant

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): some of these vocals … oof

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): boring

**starla\_** (5.5): I love David Bowie

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): it's fine. would have scored a 6 or 7 if the whole song was as good as the last 60 seconds

**frogaranaman** (5): this song is absolute nothingness so I wanna know what do y’all think about Pan’s Labyrinth? I thought the hand eye shit was freaky but I’m into it

**MassiveThief** (5): in one ear out the other

**masttup** (5): I hear this song and its fine but it immediately leaves my brain like water coming out of my ears after the beach

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): yawn

**nick1372** (5): Too much falsetto, Taylor, it's kind of distracting.

**nt96** (5): it used MapQuest and got lost. Now do Androgynous Rate and give the star of Labyrinth, David Bowie your 11s!

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): You ever hear a song that isn't *officially* an interlude, but still gives off interlude energy?

**Kayaking11116** (4.5): it's, once again, kinda boring guys

**bluehxrizon** (4): the second half of this album is such a slog

**daythreeinmiami** (4): uh oh, I’m zoning in and out again

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): the production on this is awful… Jack Antonoff you will PAY.

**horridhendy** (4): Meh. Skip

**mimins** (4): not a fan of the instrumental or vocals but i appreciate how it progressed a bit at the end

**Shelly\_AO29** (4): ANOTHER boring mid-tempo song. I don't mind slower songs if they're interesting or the production/lyrics/melody stands out which is just not happening with this track.

**intheaftermath** (3.5): perhaps the most forgettable song in Taylor's discography. There's nothing here.

**plastichaxan** (3.5): The points here are mostly for the instrumentals cause her voice is not it for me, especially when she tries to hit those high notes it always come off like hand gestures that

**akanewasright** (3): I remember this being some people’s favorite on release and like… I can understand seeing this as the least stupid, least unpleasant song on the album. But I don’t get much out of this at all. For one, I hate some of the production flourishes, but also like… I don’t think Taylor sounds good here 😭 she’s sounded nice in her falsetto-y head voice before, it just sounds grating now.

**passionfruits2** (3): painfully unmemorable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): move!!! do something!!!! anything!!!!

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): my left earbud fell while I was listening to this and that was the most exciting thing about it

**aakar528** (2.5): just can't vibe

**amr** (2): whatever man

**Uberpigeon** (2): u will never be david bowie

**AHSWeeknd** (1): “I thought the plane was going down, how’d your turn it right around” is what Mark Whalberg hears in his dreams.

**joeeswift** (1): the elephant feature is the only redeeming part

**MasterWizardRyan** (1): this song is so bad that Dumbo's vocals couldn't save it

**popularsong** (1): i see what theyre going for but its too empty especially for a 4 minute song

**aldwin\_is\_here** (0): oh wow, this is like, worryingly boring, even for this album's standard.

**bogo** (0): yeah maybe this isn't the most obviously bad song on the album but everything about it is just incredibly annoying to me. why is someone getting their ass clapped in the intro. whats with the loud synth blips that come out of nowhere. why is taylor doing that with her voice. why is taylor scared of elevators. just... what the fuck are we doing here, what is it we're trying to achieve cause i don't see the vision, i don't see why any of this shit is necessary. it's a mess

**impla77** (4.6): On first hearing this, it reminded me of ‘It’s nice to have a friend’, possibly the worst non single track off Lover. I like this more than that track but still.. it doesn’t do much for me. A bit twee, very saccharine, a lot of what we’ve previously heard.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): six song later and she’s like, here’s something good

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Nothing creative here to say I just fucking love this song. Is that so wrong? (stream ‘I’m So Hot’ by Chrissy Chlapecka)

**nooodisaster** (10): When this goes out day 1 bc all the bitter single ppl tanked it and I get to cuddle with my bf and watch anime then what?

**seanderlust** (9.7): comfy

**xqra** (9.7): This didn't click at first listen but it's for sure a highlight for me now! Super cute and the slight buildup before fading back away is nice. Makes me think of how much a Taylor/Sufjan collab would eat… hmm

**horridhendy** (9.5): This is just so pretty.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): And just like that she ended Florence and Calvin

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): imagine writing a song about how much you love your partner while also naming it the same thing as one of your exes hits

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Go girl give us sweet nothing!

**MasterWizardRyan** (9): this deserves a good rank but since popheads can't shake their ass on this one, it's going out on day 1

**nick1372** (9): A deserved winner of Mic the Snare's 2022 "The 'You're Doing WHAT To An Ant' Award for Best Sax-Overdubbed Outros Produced by Jack Antonoff"

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): really wanted to just say "calvin and flo outsold" but this is a lovely song, truly

**modulum83** (8.7): love when she gets on her bon iver 22 a million shit

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): such a sweet song. love the horns that come in as it builds. perfectly captures the comfort of a loving relationship

**heysoupie** (8.2): charming in a way that I didn’t think T Swift could manage before her quarantine releases

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.2): Very sweet and simple. Love the specific lyrics and storytelling.

**1998tweety** (8): this is definitely the most filler song on the album but its cute

**bogo** (8): finally some good fucking food

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): ooh the pedal steel guitar sounding thing

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I think this is my pick for most underrated song

**lipe18090** (8): I love the Piano Version way more tho

**masttup** (8): me outside pushing and shoving 🤬😡😠

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): actually very good

**rfbeirut** (8): very sweet song that man def didnt write

**Stryxen** (8): this is unfortunately very much the kind of song that appeals to me like if sufjan or Phoebe made this I would be GAGGING

**TiltControls** (8): It's a cute nothing song, but sometimes that works enough

**vayyiqra** (8): Such a cute little ditty 😌

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): I have to give this song a good score because my boyfriend told me this song reminds him of me 💀 I’ll take it though as there are songs on this album that would warrant a breakup

#Nothing

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): this is just New Year's Day, but more boring.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): this is pleasant-sounding but I kinda wish it was just an interlude

**runaway3212** (7): I love simplicity but this is indeed very simple

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): shoutout 2012 florence welch

**wasian-invasion** (7): this is just new years day + invisible string but worse

**bulforster** (6.6): accurate title, a cute non-event

**amr** (6.5): quite cute I smiled

**avg-vag** (6.5): the end of william bowery’s perfect streak. kind of cute bit too empty and repetitive. ‘push n shoving’ is faux relatable filler.

**Frajer** (6.5): she knows she's in her 30s right

**jman457** (6.4): This doesn’t do much for me

**thedoctordances1940** (6.2): i think i'd kinda like and appreciate this if it came at the end of a good album, it's a song that really feels like it relies on what came before and what came before is not particularly good

**PhoneThePhoenix** (6.1): kind of nice, kind of meh! like the trumpet.

**jackisboredtoday** (6): florence & calvin kinda mopped her

**mimins** (6): i dislike the oohs but i'm happy this song had less of the vibey stuff and felt like an actual song

**popularsong** (6): rly enjoy its simplicity w the piano and more instruments creeping in as the song progresses. feels so cozy which is a fun contrast w the lyrics

**Shelly\_AO29** (6): I like the section with the horns.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Boring but I guess it doesn't sound bad

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): sweet! (go girl give us) nothing!

**dreamingpastel** (5): Nothing comes to mind when I think of this song

**Hulnia** (5): she wasn’t lying lol it really is giving nothing

**indie\_fan\_** (5): [input "song title checks out" comment here]

**passionfruits2** (5): at this point on the album im already checking out

**jonnl2806** (4.5): I normally love a Taylor ballad but this is literally giving me nothing. Also the whole I spy shit is overdone

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): My boyfriend misremembered the opening lyric as “I spy with my little brown eye” so now every time I hear this song I think of a dirty butthole :)

**Birdseeding** (4): Home-Poem is the most stupid rhyme this generation

**cremeebrulee** (4): i'm ngl i would hate to be the subject of this sleepy ass song.... ik she said love isn't supposed to be burning red, but it isn't supposed to be dreary grey either

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): the title accurately describes what happens in the song

**ignitethephoenix** (4): I’m single so this is boring and meaningless

**intheaftermath** (4): i spy! you spy! let's all play i spy! I spy a cow, a fast yellow duck, fun dominoes, and a happy red truck! I spy a star, a bright blue kazoo, four silly knights, and I spy me and you!

**jasannn** (4): curse you william bowery

**moonshxne** (4): like the title

**shhhneak** (4): invisible strings of Midnights (derogatory)

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): ours id this typ of song 500x better

**TragicKingdom1** (4): this album amirite? i'll be here all night folks

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): this is clearly the evermore cut of the album, in that i dont remember it and its bland but fine i guess!

**starla\_** (3.5): the talk singing is annoying, go girl give us nothing

**Nagisoid** (3): This is disney-ballad coded and I don't like it

**nootnoot781** (3): i love how she described what the song sounds like! not sure why the sweet is there though.

**nt96** (3): It took away my time, giving nothing in return :(

**plastichaxan** (3): The second word in the title omg it’s what she’s giving

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): Well the title doesn’t lie, it’s sweet and a whole lotta nothing. Calvin & Florence outsold.

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): deserved balladphobia

**akanewasright** (2): this song is too much for me and idk why. It just feels sickly sweet, and like. The intro makes me feel ill for no reason.

**oscarbrierley1** (2): this song doesn't have enough going on for me to ignore the terrible lyrics. Eye spy??? On the way home I wrote a poem??? What is this? Baby's first rhyming class?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): yup this sure is nothing

**aakar528** (1): sweet nothing

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): again not a fan of the melodies that taylor picks, they’re not for me i don’t enjoy them

**frogaranaman** (1): nursery rhymes are getting weird

**Kayaking11116** (1): The piano saves this from being a 0 tbh

**shipperondeck** (1): ive never heard of this song

**Uberpigeon** (1): idk if its sweet but it sure is nothing

**ImADudeDuh** (5): I should honestly dislike this song more. The ugly production, the distorted vocals, the painful chorus rhymes, yeesh. And I don't *like* it but I don't dislike it. I just kinda don't think about this one in general.

**impla77** (4.8): For me, this is the start of the low point of this album. I dislike the vocal effects, it completely ruins the first chorus (thankfully not all the choruses are marred by this). The lyrics seem a little underbaked, but at least Taylor reminds us that these songs were inspired by events she thought about at midnights!!

---

#They wanted it comfortable

**Bordersz** (10): She was in her bag. Flow, the pitched down vocals, the vibe-y production!!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this is basically the thesis statement of the album

**jaztinax** (10): idc i love everything about this song

**jonnl2806** (10): I know some hate the vocal distortion but not me. Inject that shit straight into my veins. This song has been my favorite from the album since I first heard it and it has stayed that way. I just wish it was longer tbh.

**katycat162534** (10): This perfectly encapsulates the theme Taylor was going for with the promo

**nooodisaster** (10): You know I simply loved this song from first listens and never stopped to wonder... what the fuck does "changed like midnight rain" mean??

**passionfruits2** (10): my 11 for this album if i hadnt given it out already, honestly.

**PSSST12** (10): 11 Contender. Best song on the album. An accoustic piano version would end lives.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): me as a kid singing into the box fan

**UselessTacooo** (10): ok jack maybe you can stay

**avg-vag** (9): reputation never clicked for me but this does in a way i assume the swifties feast on that album

**modulum83** (9): absolutely juicy synths

**rfbeirut** (9): sucker for voice manipulation

**vayyiqra** (9): The pitched-down vocals at the beginning annoy me a bit but after that it's pretty good 😌

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): the chorus is 90s celine dion levels of camp (complimentary)

**cremeebrulee** (8.7): the edit of this without the vocoder that was going around was so RUDE to me personally, because there's actually some interesting stuff in this production for once and ofc no one else likes it 😭😭

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.6): That last chorus hits harder than a truck

**TiltControls** (8.5): Though I didn't like a lot of similar production elements on some of the other tracks, I think they work better here. Maybe cause they feel a bit more integrated rather than thrown in

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): taylor into masochism confirmed

**xqra** (8.5): I actually love the distorted vocals.. like it's camp

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): the vocal effects are weird at first, but it gets better the more you listen.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): ok this slays

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): I actually really enjoy the vocal melody, wish the song was interesting on its own

**runaway3212** (8): Yeah the voice sounds terrible but hear me out: it's an 8

**akanewasright** (7.5): The pitched vocals are fine, even a cool addition to the song! I think it’s a little undercooked, but overall pretty decent

**1998tweety** (7): cute filler, the piano version def outsold

**Birdseeding** (7): blinking, if timidly, towards hyperpop pitch-shifted genderfuck, but still, a thrilling turn

**hikk** (7): all i can think about with this song is when i was talking about midnights with someone that i previously was rejected by bc they wanted to ~focus on themselves and the future~ or whatever, they told me this song's lyrics hit them so hard... the spit take i did like...

**moonshxne** (7): 🌧️

**MrMoodle** (7): i appreciate this song for being pretty unique in an album filled with snoozers but it doesn’t really end up going anywhere

#Didn't want that pain, but got it anyway

**poppinmmolly** (7): seems incomplete

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): a solid song but something about the 'it came like a postcard: picture perfect, shiny family, holiday peppermint candy' line gives me the ick

**PhoneThePhoenix** (6.8): like it's nice and fine but I do wish there was either more or less to it, if that makes sense?

**bogo** (6.5): sure

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): not her giving james charles more lines than lana

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): something different but not memorable

**daythreeinmiami** (6): So someone pitch shifted the chorus back to the actual pitch of her vocal and it sounds better lmfao I’m not sorry.

**heysoupie** (6): the synths on this song are so grating but i do really like the lyrics

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I hate that pitched vocodor voice, ruins a decent song

**MasterWizardRyan** (6): surprised this somehow became one of the songs that stuck around

**pastapixal** (6): love how she had james charles sing the intro💖

**seanderlust** (6): we have a.g. cook at home

**Kayaking11116** (5.5): atmospheric but boring

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): i think the kind of spacey dream pop production is nice here and the verses are nice. I hate the warped vocals in the chorus, takes the whole song down for me.

**jsonphile** (5): Mr Antonoff just because you can do a distorted vocal doesn’t mean you should

**Nagisoid** (5): Pageant queens and big pretenders is the swiftie version of testosterone boys and harlequin girls, I will not elaborate any further

**Poydoo** (5): This song sounds like shit unless you're wearing headphones

**shhhneak** (5): I guess the bridge didn’t survive the rainfall? American infrastructure isn’t the same as it used to be.

**Stryxen** (5): I feel like King Princess would love this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): why does she think she’s an indie pop artist

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I HAAAATE these vocal effects it sounds so ugly

**jman457** (4.8): This is just a worse version of Call it What it you want (which I also found mid)

**DevilsOfLoudun** (4): I hate the Jack Anotnoff parts. Writing is clunky too.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): the vocoder is a bit much

**frogaranaman** (4): consistently impressed by her ability to make a full 20 song album of the same exact tune throughout this. queen!

**popularsong** (4): i actually dig the interjects with the male voice? tuned vocals? but oh my god the rest of the song is just. "i was red he was blue" type cringe

**Shelly\_AO29** (4): Another boring mid-tempo song. Damn, this album is a bit of a slog to get through.

**slimboyfriend** (4): Can’t stop thinking that the vocal effect and background claps makes her sound like James Charles slapping cheeks in the chorus

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i HATE the vocal distortion like truly can't listen to the song bc of it. the rest of it is fine

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): im glad jack at least remembered where he put the bleachers voice effects

**starla\_** (3.5): the pitched-down vocal is really annoying and the track feels like they ran out of ideas

**aakar528** (3): can't vibe

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): I’m not usually a Jack Antonoff-anti but songs like this…they test me.

**DirtyRat583** (3): is this jack antonoff's attempt at hyperpop ..? never again

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (3): What an experimental performance. Let's hope it never repeats again

**MassiveThief** (3): that vocal thing is brutally annoying, and not just because it sounds like James Charles

**mimins** (3): its boring and the robotish voice is annoying. the past 3 songs have all sounded the same.

**nick1372** (3): God that whistle in the background or whatever makes me want to remove my brain from my skull and feed it through a paper shredder

**oscarbrierley1** (3): something about the pitched down vocals makes me feel so uncomfortable.

**ReallyCreative** (3): not that jumpscare at the beginning being the most interesting part of the song

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): there's a sound in this that makes me feel like the song is trying to rewind itself and I don't like it

**thedoctordances1940** (2.3): the little vocoder bits or whatever it is are so laughably bad, you're not death's dynamic shroud you cannot pull that off. It's also just really fucking boring

**AHSWeeknd** (2): I don’t understand the hype?? It’s just Sober by Lorde but the less interesting other perspective of the song

**intheaftermath** (2): DNF (40%) 1/5 stars. Vocal filter is practically unlistenable. I can't handle it.

**masttup** (2): me at age 15 on Snapchat when I realised you could warp your voice

**nootnoot781** (2): MIDnight rain... her easter eggs are so insane

**plastichaxan** (2): The beginning of this made me finally understand why people hate Dorian Electra’s music

ImADudeDuh: #gagged a bit that a song this boring needs two comments posted

**amr** (1): intro genuinely makes me nauseous I may have blacked out for the rest of the song

**nt96** (1): it agitated

**RandomHypnotica** (1): that vocal hook is fucking insufferable

**shipperondeck** (1): you know why im giving this a 1.

**welcome2thejam** (1): Two seconds in and I can already tell nothing in this song can salvage the bad mood this intro puts me in

**horridhendy** (0): On the one hand, it feels a little harsh giving this a 0 but on the other hand, this song is horrible - it's my least favourite song in this rate by far. I will scramble for my phone to skip this if it comes on shuffle. The cherry on top of this shit sundae is the use of the vocoder, it's awful.

**Hulnia** (0): who the fuck approved that vocoder? 😭

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Kinda surprised this one received such a negative reaction. I thought it was alright. Yeah it's tiktok bait, but it knows it's tiktok bait. Taylor doesn't leave some heartbreaking lyrics throughout this song. She just wants to be a girlboss a bit, and I'd much rather have her girlbossery sound like this compared to Vigilante Sh!t

**impla77** (6.4): I like the shimmery synths and the start of the chorus but that line (you know the one) completely disrupts the flow of the song, and it isn’t even good on its own. It annoys me everytime. Don’t know how to feel about the ‘Nice!’ but I’m leaning towards liking it (I wish since it is there that it would be more deliberate). This song is close to something, but seems like it could’ve used a few revisions.

=====

ImADudeDuh: #Nice!

**cremeebrulee** (10): i unfortunately like this song too much to commit to the (6.9): nice! bit

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I’m not lying when I say I can see sparkles when I listen to this song

**katycat162534** (10): NICEEEE!! Fun to sing along

**PSSST12** (10): Only pretty people get this song I fear.

**runaway3212** (10): what can I say... a diamonds gotta shine

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this song deserved more love it's SO FUN

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): when someone asks me what my mom's favorite early 2000s flash game was

**vayyiqra** (10): ‼️ NICE ‼️

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): good song

**Poydoo** (9): Nice!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): a clear highlight on this album. would be a 10 if she re-worked that 'penthouse of my heart' line to be less clunky

**wasian-invasion** (9): this is such an annoying song. i love it

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): this is so dumb (affectionate)

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): I love facebook

**fairytalehigh** (8.3): it wants to give the best moments of 1989 but mostly it's just giving "gorgeous" (derogatory)

**jonnl2806** (8.2): NICE! I probably like this more than most people and I have reason why

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.1): Synths, Synths, Synths. A fun, cute dance pop bop.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I may well be letting my standards get too low, but they’re my standards I can do what I want with them!

**daythreeinmiami** (8): Mkay here is my theory. She releases Anti-Hero the night Midnights is released, quickly releasing Bejeweled MV to release easter eggs hinting at Speak Now TV and Reputation TV (and blondie I ate it up), thinking Midnights wouldn’t be the juggernaut it was. Then she had to completely rework the TV release of Speak Now because Midnights and Anti Hero was incredibly successful, and it was pushed back to MARCH 31ST 2023. (IF IT ISN’T I’LL EAT THE VINYL BOOKLET I JUST SPILT PROSECCO ON help I’m a mess)

**jaztinax** (8): didn’t care for this song until i went to a taylor swift club night and now this song reminds me of that night bc it was such good vibes

**MassiveThief** (8): i like the sparkly sounds lol. like it's corny but works.

**modulum83** (8): yeah i’m not above this lol

**nootnoot781** (8): that one tiktoker added about 5 to this score

**rfbeirut** (8): great late 2000s indie pop song would have killed on MTVs awkward.

**heysoupie** (7.6): “I can still make the whole place shimmer” is SO…her!! In the best way.

**Frajer** (7.5): I don't want a white woman from Pennsylvania to reclaim the land

**intheaftermath** (7.5): the way Taylor says "i think it's time to teach some lessons"... step on me or something idk

**jman457** (7.4): This cute actually

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): the "nice!" tiktok sound in isolation sounds like a clip from Wii Sports Bowling

**akanewasright** (7): this would be a 2 or something if it weren’t for the video. The song has re-grown off me, but for all the failings of the video (and of Taylor Swift as a director), when she does that walk with that makeup look I’m like “damn she does polish up real nice”

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): that wordy chorus is iconic for clunky reasons, but the MV is shittier.

**horridhendy** (7): Fun bop. Didn't like it at first but it grew on me. It does feel a little generic.

**jasannn** (7): it was top 5 until the mv came out

**pastapixal** (7): it's nice!

**PhoneThePhoenix** (7): I think some parts of this song are kind of. well. annoying. but also I get it stuck in my head all the time lol. and like. it's... nice!

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): she's going to sing about Candy Crush a couple years later

#All the bejeweled rip-offs that came out after it was released

**MasterWizardRyan** (6.9): i'm whelmed

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): NICE!

**1998tweety** (6): girl what do you mean by "reclaim the land" 💀

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): some of the vocal phrasing is... interesting but the production makes up for it

**CrimsonROSET** (6): aren’t you happily dating someone at this point if someone asked if you have a man isn’t the simple answer ‘yes’

**frogaranaman** (6): the “by the way, I’m going out tonight~” line is so clunky but I just knooooowwwww she felt so cunty recording it

**jsonphile** (6): some of these lyrics feel like they have too many syllables

**Nagisoid** (6): "Don't put me in the basement of your heart" Sia trying to convince Bey to let her out:

**Roxieloxie** (6): nice !

**slimboyfriend** (6): girly girl airhead walking music

**Uberpigeon** (6): im sure she *thinks* she can make the whole room shimmer. personally i don't think she can. but it bops.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Yes this does indeed sound like the background music for a free-to-play phone game

**thedoctordances1940** (5.8): it would be fine if it weren't trying to sound like the game bejeweled

**moonshxne** (5.5): the production is still too lifeless and same-y to truly work, but i think you could at least make a *nice!* video game sample pack out of this

**Birdseeding** (5): I've always loved appregiators but this is so mid-tempo and dull

**Kayaking11116** (5): it's sparkly ig

**masttup** (5): don’t put me in the nuclear bunker when I want the helicopter pad of ur heart!!

**nt96** (5): it glimmered in dollar store plastic diamond fashion

**oscarbrierley1** (5): the whole instrumental is kind of annoying to me. I thought the "nice" part was a tik tok edit, but apparently not.

**popularsong** (5): kinda cute

**Shelly\_AO29** (5): The Anime-like 'Nice!' is...a choice (it matches the vibe of the song though). Nearly halfway through this album and all I'm thinking is how much I'd rather be listening to Folklore.

**Stryxen** (5): bad and I hate it and I hate that it's growing on me and I need to send this ballot before I randomly break and give this a 10

**throwaway-7650** (5): not sure I've ever heard such a 10/0 simultaneously, so... 5 it is!

**welcome2thejam** (5): Taylor getting HAIM & Laura Dern in her music video was a coordinated effort to specifically get the attention of my brother

**bulforster** (4.6): vaguely boppy but more annoying

**amr** (4.5): closest thing so far to sounding like an actual song that wasn't made up for laughs

**aakar528** (4): decent tune but too damn wordy

**cocosairdep** (4): lots of weird choices but one of the better produced ones

**nooodisaster** (4): "Baby love I think I've been a little too kind" Me giving this a 4

**TiltControls** (4): Taylor really pinpointed the songs I didn't like from the album to choose as singles huh

**apatel27** (3.5): stealing that nice sound straight out of Rhythm Heaven Fever

**ignitethephoenix** (3.5): “reclaim the land” imperialist queen 😍

**bogo** (3): "i can reclaim the land" ma'am you are a rich woman what stolen land are you reclaiming

**FlavaSavaVandal** (3): Jenny Tolman did a song like this in 2022, but it sounded like she would actually leave if she wasn’t being treated like a queen and didn’t have that awful synthline during the chorus, anyways stream i know some cowboys by Jenny Tolman

**Hulnia** (3): this probably would’ve been good if the production wasn’t so bad

**mimins** (3): starting to think i'm not going to like a single song on this album

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): eh

**ReallyCreative** (3): my mom loved this game omg

**shhhneak** (3): Laura Dern innocent.

**emayzee** (2): this sounds like it was engineered in a lab to soundtrack tiktok videos of white women strutting in mediocre outfits

**nick1372** (2): I personally find the concept of dressing up and going out to spite your partner very immature and kind of repulsive, but I see why it's appealing to many and it's not a bad concept for a song. I hate the way she says "Nice!" in the chorus though it's so grating.

**vexastrae** (2): now whose land are you reclaiming?

**AHSWeeknd** (1): the way that “familiarity” line is just entirely different from the other lyrics, it’s so out of place

**Awkward\_King** (1): horrible for how my best friend had it stuck in her head for so long and so i had to hear it through osmosis and i never liked it in the first place!!!

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): the “nice!” in the chorus justifies this score, I believe.

**dreamingpastel** (1): It sounds like a reject from Lover that, honestly, should've just stayed in the vault.

**passionfruits2** (1): this song lives in the same universe as ME! and for that reason it sucks

**plastichaxan** (1): I listened to a 30 second clip of I Got It Bad by Addison Rae I got on twitter on top of this and when it was over this just sounded worse

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): I hate this chorus so much, it encapsulates Taylor’s phrasing that’s so offputting to my ears. The jumpy, scooping choices where she jumps like a 3rd or 4th from the prior note. And the “nice!” adlibs I find very unpleasant to listen to. My least favorite chorus in the whole rate and the verses don’t save it.

**shipperondeck** (0): mess

**starla\_** (0): incredibly annoying and the music video makes me irrationally angry

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): ironic how she keeps having to put “nice!” adlibs throughout this whole song as if shes trying to convince herself this isnt the most annoying and clunkiest song she has written in her entire career

**impla77** (6.3): Someone mentioned that the intro sounds like the theme they use in Eurovision to announce a country, and now I can’t unhear that (the resemblance is uncanny). I don’t want to get too deep into Taylor women features discourse but I think categorising Lana as a feature here is slightly misleading. Feels like it could of been an Easter Egg for fans to pick up on if it wasn’t mentioned rather than straining to hear Lana in the mix. Apart from those notable oddities, this is a fine, if slightly unexciting, dreamy song about the first mutual blossomings of love.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): **THIS IS SO OFFENSIVELY BORING!** I'm sorry but I can't believe Taylor would put the first song with a negative bpm on her album, and of course she would make it a lana del rey collaboration.\* This song has some of the worst lyrical moments on the song: "weird but fucking beautiful," "flight was awful thanks for asking," and the out of NOWHERE All For You reference? This song really does not earn mentioning Janet Jackson anywhere, let alone one of her best pop hits. Fuck this song. 

 \*Citation needed on if Lana Del Rey is actually on this song or not.

#Fucking Beautiful

**1998tweety** (10): This song has the perfect amount of Lana

**AHSWeeknd** (10): you know that one meme of DW (Arthur’s sister) embracing the rainfall? That’s what this song feels like

**FlavaSavaVandal** (10): this could be a christmas song, the way those bells, the faint backing vocals of Lana. It just immerses you in this melancholic christmassy vibe. And you know I love to say it, but Jack just perfectly captures that with how well balanced this music is. And I know we like to meme on taylor using other women as backing vocals. But i think it’s the right choice. She'd probably overpower the song’s delicate balance if she was more prominent. Instead she plays the role of a ghost haunting her nights, her dreams. And yeah snow on the beach might not exactly be a weird thing, but she sure as hell sells it as the most surreal experience you could have. But really sitting with this song, on overthinking over the melancholy of getting just what she wanted

**RandomHypnotica** (10): It's unfortunate that one of the few songs I like on here also happens to be the one with Lana credit

**runaway3212** (10): lana the funniest bitch ever like imagine writing songs as terrible as white dressand then giving her best song ever to Taylor and not even sing a verse despite being explicitly asked to

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): okay but y'all should have been here in california when it actually snowed on the beach last month! can confirm weird but fucking beautiful!

**vayyiqra** (10): Snow on a beach is not weird where I live sadly but I get what she's going for here ☝️ and yes Lana's voice on this is so hard to detect it's homeopathic but whatever 😌

**hikk** (9.5): i've tried so hard to understand what lana means when she talks about her feature on this song in interviews and it gives me a stroke every time

**avg-vag** (9): the perfect amount of LDR imo

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): There needs to be a word for “features” like this. Like “kindafeaturing,” “tagging along,” or “female friend of Taylor Swift-ing.” Anyway nice song.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): lana ate.

**shipperondeck** (8.9): thought this would sound darker.. shame. well at least lana's here. kinda. the eyes like saucers line kinda inexcusable though

**jman457** (8.6): Idk maybe this could sleep itself into Lana’s first rate win

**emayzee** (8.3): not an all for you janet reference coming from the girl who said she'd never heard of 3LW

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.3): phoebe bridgers does christmas music

**aakar528** (8): serene

**bogo** (8): insert the "i will never forgive you taylor swift" post here

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): see now this is dreamy done well. lana is about as present as my will to live atm

**horridhendy** (8): Despite the fact that I do like this song, it's still probably my biggest disappointment of 2022. As a Lana stan, I have complicated feelings about this one. Especially since Lana recently revealed that she worked on the production but somehow doesn't get any credit - maybe she didn't want credit, who knows - whatever. Also, the fact this is Lana’s highest charting song despite her barely whispering a few words on it is a crime and it makes me die a little inside. Anyway, it's a good song, it just doesn't live up to expectations.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): “the flight was awful thanks for asking” … you literally fly private??? We need to stick her on economy!!

**jsonphile** (8): the title of this sounds like it should be on The Beach Boys’ Christmas album

**rfbeirut** (8): sure

**Shelly\_AO29** (8): Decent song, Taylor and Lana's voices blend beautifully together, and the production is stellar.

**jasannn** (7.8): this feels more like a dawn track than a midnights track

**udontwannaknownoel** (7.6): Could've been Pretty When You Cry x Style levels of cunty, but it's very pretty sounding and I love the Janet Jackson reference and Lana's harmonies.

**Stryxen** (7.5): Taylor has never heard a janet song in her life

**akanewasright** (7.3): This is just a few sleigh bells and slight lyric changes away from being a Christmas song with Lana backing vocals

**fairytalehigh** (7.2): i regularly wonder how much LDR was paid for this

ImADudeDuh: #Ruined a good day at the beach

**musical\_pyn** (7): this is a beautiful melody/production but the lyrics are very ??? and not even in a good ??? that lana sometimes brings

**nt96** (7): it snowflaked

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Lana really made a deal with the devil (Taylor) to get into the top 10 huh

**wasian-invasion** (7): https://twitter.com/flanneIcure/status/1583339038584766464?s=20

**modulum83** (6.5): don’t lie to me this is just background music from a tiktok compilation

**thedoctordances1940** (6.4): i think i remember evermore sounding pretty much just like this which is why after a month of listening to it a ton I basically forgot about it. Like it's not bad but it's pretty forgettable and the jack production brings it down a lot, it just sounds so sterile

**DaHumanTorch** (6.3): taylor you do not listen to janet jackson bffr

**Birdseeding** (6): Competent!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): vs cake by the ocean vs high by the beach

**DraculaWeekend** (6): I would have preferred if this was just an LDR song

**jonnl2806** (6): Feels like a Lana song but worse

**masttup** (6): me looking my green Thai curry that is shrek green… weird but fucking beautiful

**seanderlust** (6): idk the line "it's like snow on the beach, weird but fucking beautiful" feels like a copout - like, she could have explored the metaphor a bit more? LOVE the all for you shoutout - that's one of my favorite janet songs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): id say i deserve financial compensation for having to listen to a lana del rey song in 2023 but i dont think shes actually on this song so your wallets are safe for now i guess

**Uberpigeon** (6): snow on the beach isnt weird and its also not very beautiful like the sand gets all mucked in with the snow and makes it gross.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): complaining about her flight as if anyone but herself is to blame for her private jet being subpar

**PhoneThePhoenix** (5.5): her voice is nice here. also lol Lana feature

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): honestly swifties and lana stans got what they deserved

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (5.5): a heavy-handed attempt to make a Lana song. catchy hook but also the 'weird but fucking beautiful' is such a clunky line

**moonshxne** (5.4): sorry but taylor's voice is just too plain and honestly vanilla (and too reverb-soaked here) to effectively do atmospheric cuts. even barely including lana here makes it painfully obvious would could've been with a superior vocalist

**amr** (5): cute twinkly sounds I like those, would be more listenable with different singers

**DirtyRat583** (5): its cute but i am a balladphobe and also im a lanaphobe so oops (yes she is in like the background of 3 seconds of the song but her name IS on the song)

**Nagisoid** (5): Flying saucers from another planet? is Taylor hiding classified information about flying saucers from Earth?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i can't help but feel this would have been better as just a lana solo song lmao  did she even contribute

**TheQueenofVultures** (5): anything PRO taylor is inherently ANTI lana

**welcome2thejam** (5): Kinda want a fuller folksier sound on this

**bulforster** (4.8): SOS track 8

**xqra** (4.5): Some parts are cute but weirdly I don't like the chorus or the bridge?

**intheaftermath** (4): the worst "fucking" Taylor's ever dropped

**just\_thonking** (4): This is Cake By The Ocean for people whose Camp Rock 2 is Cats (2019)

**MrMoodle** (4): “snow on the beach, weird but fuckin’ beautiful” is so clunky to me i don’t get it at all. also i’m watching this on youtube and all the text effects are hilariously tacky it looks like a 5th grader made it in imovie lol

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): a song, allegedly

**mimins** (3): i dislike the way it was sung and i thought it was going to have an explosive final chorus but it kinda fell flat so it was just boring.

**popularsong** (3): the rest of the song is fine except for the flying saucers bit but omg her voice going up at the end of the first verse lines is so grating. also smth abt "weird but fuckin' beautiful" is so cringe hsdhf

**TiltControls** (3): I rated this higher when I first heard it, but the more I listen the more I realize this song is basically nothing

**nick1372** (2.5): Okay first of all a proper Taylor / Lana collab would be terrible because Taylor has been adopting many of Lana's vocal mannerisms for years. Their voices are too similar to make it interesting, so that's why Lana has to be relegated to the background. If you have issues with that, it's more likely because Taylor marketed this as a collab when it really isn't. My real problem with this song is that they couldn't think of anything better to do with the metaphor of snow on a beach than "weird but fucking beautiful"???????? Really?????????

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (2): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ea94Be_WsAAYwzh.jpg

**MasterWizardRyan** (2): it takes a tremendous amount of talent for two of the most insufferable woman on pop to make the most boring song ever

**thisusernameisntlong** (2): wish this had more songiness on it so that I could better ignore the lyrics

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): the scooped up vocal lines make me physically flinch. the reverby production is very bland.

**cocosairdep** (0): Lana sweetie I’m so sorry

**cremeebrulee** (0): this hook is so, so on the nose and BAD!!! they both deserve jailtime for releasing this

**shhhneak** (0): Some of the clunkiest lyrics in any modern Taylor song to the extent where I brace myself for them like jump scares in a horror movie.

#It's coming down, no sound (from Lana)

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Lana is more present in this track than she would’ve been had she sang in it. I said what I said.

**PSSST12** (10): We May not hear Lana but we FEEL her prescence. Like some of yall need to stop lying that serve on the beach wasnt that BITCH.

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): I only wish Lana got to do more with this song

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): so good it left LDR speechless like, Colbie, The Chicks, and that other girl from Fearless (TV).

**starla\_** (8): sounds like something from folkmore repurposed. The upward inflections are annoying but it's otherwise good. I wish Lana was more present.

**Frajer** (7.5): Lana doing background vocals is what we deserve

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): a few whispery background vocals does not make a feature ms swift. The all for you Janet Jackson reference is so left field because it doesnt sound like a reference either of them would make.

**passionfruits2** (7.5): Lana where you at.

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): Lana is trapped under the snow omg help her taylor

**daythreeinmiami** (7): I think we can Victoria Justice All Agree this needed more Lana Del Rey vocal and more Dylan O’Brien drums.

**jaztinax** (7): really thought she was going to break the curse of not giving women a real verse after the phoebe bridgers feature but here we are

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): you cannot convince me that Lana Del Rey is actually on this song

**pastapixal** (6): deducted a point because where is Lana💀

**frogaranaman** (3): it’s so funny knowing that Lana Del Rey didn’t realize she was the only feature on the album and just did backing vocals instead. like what a fucking blessing in disguise

**MassiveThief** (3): this song's biggest sin is just being boring. and why even say ft. Lana.

**vexastrae** (3): lana is literally non-existent in this song, lets hope pusha t actually has a verse when his remix of snow on the beach drops!

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): i unfortunately do like lana's music which is why it surprises me there's absolutely nothing redeeming about it to me. the melody is annoying, lana adds nothing which is insane when she really could add so much, i hate the titular metaphor.

**Kayaking11116** (1.5): I loved it when Lana said "    ". (and the line "it's weird but fuckin beautiful" made me feel icky ;-;-;)

**Hulnia** (1): this is the only time i’ve ever wanted more lana on a song

**nooodisaster** (0): I WAS WAITING FOR THIS ONE. It's featuring LDR the same way LDR at that one meetup was wearing a mask. Beyond that, god such a snoozefest.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): "featuring Lana Del Rey* okay, yeah I'm sure

**Treecoh** (0): i refuse to believe lana had anything to do with this

#dancing around, dancing around

**1998tweety** (10): we love an Evermore outtake

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Somehow this is a feminist anthem.

**nick1372** (10): I wasn't too high on illicit affairs, this was everything I wanted from that song and more

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): first she was the queen of breakup songs, then she became the queen of lovey-dovey songs, but now she’s the queen of cheating songs

**modulum83** (9): this is just a the national song

**musical\_pyn** (9): what is it about taylor swift writing about infidelity that brings out the best of her songwriting ability (cf. illicit affairs)

**seanderlust** (9): "do you really want to know where i was april twen-" no. do you want to know that the bulging eyes of most frogs allow them to see in front, to the sides, and partially behind them?

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): i really don't care about taylor's past relationship drama (like, at all) but the beat goes off!

**starla\_** (8.5): good but I think would be better if it were slightly slowed down

**DevilsOfLoudun** (8): lyrically this is a step above everything else on this album.

**intheaftermath** (8): really has that "not produced by Jack Antonoff" feel that I missed

**Nagisoid** (8): Caroline Polachek's career ended after Taylor took over her yodeling pop monopoly

**Stryxen** (8): the bleep bloops are SO good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): if an art pop girlie sang this i know it would slay

**vayyiqra** (8): no comment on the lyrics to this song not falling for that trap 😌

**passionfruits2** (6): fine.

**rfbeirut** (6): very much not my fav

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): getting a bit sick of writing "it's fine" as my comment for the midnights songs lmao

**wasian-invasion** (6): according to wikipedia april 29th 2013 was a deadly plane crash in afghanistan and an office building explosion in prague hmm time to check her private jet logs

**FlavaSavaVandal** (5.5): April 29th, wasnt that the date you dropped Me! No thank you

**jaztinax** (5.5): the way i think this is the super mario tune every single time this starts playing

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): what slur did he say taylor? The song is really boring apart from that line

**Poydoo** (5.5): boring

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): i don't really care for this but it's clear she's at least trying. Like does she just try harder when Aaron is in the studio and just phone it in when jack is there with her? Does Jack just distract her and then they get nothing good done? Honestly, with how many otherwise good artists are releasing their most uninteresting and bland music the moment they make something with Jack, there has to be something to it beyond his production just being ridiculously dreary

**CrimsonROSET** (5): where was she

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): there’s many ways that you can tank a song in this rate

**nooodisaster** (5): Actually rating 3am might've been a mistake bc I feel like you were either in the mood for more folklore tracks or you weren't.

**popularsong** (5): i dont see myself coming back to this but its v enjoyable. the instruments get some room to breathe let me see who made this Oh its not jack antonoff! yippee!

**Shelly\_AO29** (5): Okay, but pretty generic and uninspiring.

**shhhneak** (5): “We have Coney Island at home.” The Coney Island at home:

**vexastrae** (5): JUMPSCARE!

**apatel27** (4): you aren't a victim or a girlboss if you cheat

**Birdseeding** (4): Swift is a really weak lyricist, I've come to realise. None of these songs hold up when you read the lyrics, and the worst thing is that I think she believes herself a genius.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): “Slur spoken” I know what she means but there HAD to have been a better way to say it.

**runaway3212** (4): Honestly this is also bad lyrically it makes no sense

**shipperondeck** (3.8): well the beep beeps are fun

**plastichaxan** (3.5): Her lyrics are what people praise the most and this is the closest I’ve been to getting it but like… I need her voice to sound good too

**amr** (3): wasn't actively upsetting sure

**dreamingpastel** (3): No, I don't want to know where you were on any day of the year.

**Kayaking11116** (3): it's so boring ;-;-; like I have nothing else to say

**nt96** (3): it nibbled

**aakar528** (2): i don't care (production points)

**Awkward\_King** (2): 🚬

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): boring

**mimins** (1): hate hate hate the way she sings this one plus it ends out of nowhere

#Insurrection? More like in-SERVE-ection!

**bogo** (10): wish i could give this a january 6 but unfortunately it's way too good for that

**indie\_fan\_** (10): Do you really wanna know where I was [January 6th]? You know there's many different ways that you can kill [a congressman]

**jman457** (9): do you really want to know where I was January 6th

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): “Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?” No, but I really wanna know where you were January 6th

**ReallyCreative** (7): January 6th

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): the january 6 part is catches me so off guard like it's a bop until that part and isnt even bad after I just have a hard time taking it seriously

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): do you really wanna know where I was January 6th? You know there's a million different ways you can kill a cōňğrę§smån

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): I keep thinking about January 6th meme

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): haha insurrection meme

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): everyone is focused on where she was january 6th but i just wanna know what slur was spoken

**bluehxrizon** (6): Do you really wanna know where i was January 6th? You know there's many different ways that you can kill a congressman

**bulforster** (6): idk if I should be embarrassed to admit I believed jan 6th was the actual lyric until the listening party

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Do you really wanna know where I was January 6th

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): the "do you really wanna know where i was jan 6" is the funniest thing that came out of stan twt in a long time

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): where were you january 6th blondie let's start with that

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): the insurrection meme cut kind of outsells

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I really like this song. Taylor admitting that she obsesses over wanting someone to love her back to the point that she goes a little crazy to perfect everything to make it work. And she doesn't frame it as a "haha I did this easily" like so many weird people did on tiktok, she's admitting it in a way that feels like she wanted to lift a weight off her shoulders. And let's be real, Taylor admitting that she plans out her life so much in order to make someone think something is not new news to us. That's just called the Reputation era. However, I know she's not the only one who wanted to plan stuff out in hopes of landing a crush. She's successful but still can make herself seem pitiful, despite being Taylor Swift. Fuck, this song really hits deep. Also, shoutout to her for putting "Machiavellian" in a song and making it work.

**impla77** (8.3): Do I think all the metaphors work here? No, but I don’t know, I think this works better for me as a ‘self-aware’ track than Antihero, just feels tongue in cheek and I like how it ramps up to the chorus. I love it when Taylor drops in an obscure word to gag the girlies (shout out Machiavellian) but lord knows some Swifties are going to act like she invented the dictionary. Maybe I’m just on the wrong side of Tiktok (oh no.. i’ve gone off on a tangent)

ImADudeDuh: #She has the mind of masterm- mind of a mast- what's that? I don't know but I'm so creative

**1998tweety** (10): https://youtu.be/f_Maspo1z34

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I enjoy it when Jack Antonoff’s production doesn’t distract from her writing.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): FINALLY now this is taylor and jack firing on all cylinders

**FlavaSavaVandal** (10): as lonely as Midnights is as an album, it ends on two very sweet notes, and Mastermind is almost joyous in how it swirls up and captures a love that’s messy but very real. Idk this song just rules, the way Taylor paints herself as some kind mastermind only to find herself being a drunken fool as she realises he knew all along. I think there’s something genuinely sweet that she found someone to love her

**jonnl2806** (10): I mean tell us something we didn't know Tay

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is my favorite song off the album; please don't ask me why i don't think I could actually answer

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): literally the opposite message to Invisible String but I love both nonetheless.

**rfbeirut** (10): so good shes crazy for this one

**runaway3212** (10): yes its tiktok bait but some tiktok songs are very good

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): i'm not surprised no one wanted to play with taylor

**vayyiqra** (10): See I love when she says "Checkmate, I couldn't lose" because I like to loop this album while I'm playing chess which I do for a couple of hours every night, that rules 😌

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): A man can be a predator, a woman can only be a mastermind… happy women’s history month I guess

**Poydoo** (9.5): Those weird humming strings in the background are honestly the best instrument in the whole rate

**bulforster** (9.4): this song has a much better case for actually being about being an anti hero and is also much better in general

**jman457** (9.3): It “ends” strongly, but this feels much more like a climax rather than an ending

**brendjac** (9): A Taylor Swift Thesis Statement

**nick1372** (9): It's just lovely

**nooodisaster** (9): Production is a 10, slightly creepy lyrics are something slightly less that makes this a 9. You thought I'd do math?

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.3): Lovely production and ok Miss Swift way to write a twist at the end.

**UselessTacooo** (8.2): Mastermanipulator

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): on the standard edition, somehow my favorite songs are the first and last ones lol. the skittering synths are simple but stirring. Taylor’s vocal choices here are straightforward with a few choices that do suite the song well.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): this feels like a Lover track, but actually in a good way.

**wasian-invasion** (8): wait this doesnt sample supercut right its just jack antonoff being himself?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.8): when someone asks me what my favorite codebreaking boardgame is

**fairytalehigh** (7.6): the lyrics are pretty meh, her vocals are good, i LOVE the production

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i really like the build on this im surprised i have no memory of it i guess i was skipping through songs by this stage of my initial listen sjdjs. lyrics corny as always but its a nice listen!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): anthem for horse girls who had trouble landing a boyfriend cause they were a die hard swiftie, until they stalked the perfect man and forced them into a relationship

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): First of all, I wouldn't believe you. Second, I do like this as a closer for the main album, it's easily the least flawed song of the album but it's still nothing particularly special

**heysoupie** (7.3): appreciate the self-awareness here but it also feels like a personal attack in some ways haha (:

**Frajer** (7): we all know you're not a mastermind

**jsonphile** (7): five bucks says the reveal for this is going to be that woman saying she has the mind of a master

**masttup** (7): me when I accidentally found my crush’s dad registered political party (republican ☹️) on public records

**Nagisoid** (7): UGH her mind

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): The buildup throughout the song is quite good.

**welcome2thejam** (7): Just go full Bleachers next time Taylor. Just go all-out heartland rock

#Specialist Subject: how to make garbage music

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): see i actually think this is a pretty solid track and i like the production on here a lot but i get such *bad* vibes from this and everything feels slightly off in a way i cant place

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): easily the weakest closer to a standard edition of her album, thank god, the three-am edition exists.

**bluehxrizon** (6): the number of psychotic tiktoks this song inspired

**modulum83** (6): I HATE SONGS ABOUT TAYLOR SWIFT’S META-PERSONA I HATE SONGS ABOUT TAYLOR SWIFT’S META-PERSONA

**ReallyCreative** (6): it’s very okay but goes nowhere, honestly kind of a blessing?

**TiltControls** (6): Taylor is the type of person that will try to make you guess 6 in codenames with the most arbitrary clue

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6): a solid end to the standard. the verses are really solid but the chorus has much to be desired

**PhoneThePhoenix** (5.9): I do not love the concept of this song and I kind of like the twinkly production.

**DraculaWeekend** (5.5): Sounds like Lorde

**MassiveThief** (5.5): writing is fine but... again... cringe ass lyrics

**starla\_** (5.5): is this supposed to be romantic?

**Birdseeding** (5): Another slight song that gets a +1 for the arpeggiator

**CrimsonROSET** (5): put me under the mind of a mastermind segment

**frogaranaman** (5): [REDACTED]

**jasannn** (5): me as an anxious person

**Kayaking11116** (5): it had so much potential to go harder and, therefore, be better. like I could feel how it could've been louder and more emotional but it was held back so much

**seanderlust** (5): girl...this is a lot of planning just ask to fuck him

**Stryxen** (5): she wastes this delectable arpeggiator instrumental with the most nothing songwriting ugh the disrespect to beach house

**intheaftermath** (4.5): I don't know what's worse, this song or the TikTok toxic ex trends it made

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4.5): i guess the topic is interesting but that doesn't save the song from feeling boring and uninspired

**akanewasright** (4): this song doesn’t do much for me either way, but it does bring back flashbacks to those TikToks of women admitting the (way worse) manipulations they did to get their men

**bookthieving** (4): only connect >

**mimins** (4): the entire 1st minute was buildup and i was hype for the payoff thinking i might enjoy a song at the very end but then i realized that there was no payoff and the chorus already passed...kinda sounds like supercuts by lorde tho

**nt96** (4): it foiled

**passionfruits2** (4): you're not a mastermind taylor you're just rich, they didnt want to play with you as a kid because you were probably not as rich as today. extra points for using the word Machiavellian.

**shipperondeck** (4): this was interesting until she said outright "im a mastermind" not even asking anymore.. being gloaty about it is so cheap and boring

**aakar528** (3): decent production

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): The cascading dominoes in question just being every track on Midnights getting eliminated.

**daythreeinmiami** (3): Babes, and Jack, it sounds like Labyrinth.

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Oh my god has Taylor ever been THIS obnoxious before? Like no girl you are not a "mastermind" I'm pretty sure you just made up all these scenarios in the shower like the rest of us, but at least the rest of us have the self-awareness to NOT write a song about it in a vain attempt to look more badass

**vexastrae** (3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Maspo1z34 you will never be wendy's eating show!

**shhhneak** (2.8): when i tell you the fbi the cia the cdc the dea the sec the doj the bbq could tie my hands and dangle me above alcatraz shark infested water… and they still wouldn’t get this outta me

**apatel27** (2): thought process of uni students going out on the pull

**bogo** (2): god i remember listening to this for the first time, reeling from everything i just heard, and then the "nobody wanted to play with me as a little kid" line came along and just killed me. like that's it, that's the worst line taylor has written in her entire career. give me the sweet release of death right now i'm done here

**cocosairdep** (2): someone lied to her several times…

**cremeebrulee** (2): admitting this at your big age.....

**just\_thonking** (2): "I laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork the dominoes cascaded in a line" I forgot how much this lady abuses similes and metaphors geez. Here's a simile: She sounds like a middle schooler writing their first short story.

**popularsong** (2): i actually really like that fast soundbite it opens with but the rest of the production is just .ah .      jack antonoff

**Uberpigeon** (2): shes trying to serve female manipulator but its giving multi-level marketing. im not buying your lularoe tights taylor

**amr** (1): I'd also make music like this if I knew lena dunham personally so I won't hold it against her

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): jesus this is boring

**RandomHypnotica** (1): holy fuck taylor stop huffing your own farts you are not a genius

**impla77** (7.4): This is a clear callback to Red, with a relationship being defined in terms of different shades of red (she jampacks them into the chorus in a way that teeters on clumsiness). One of my favourite metaphors in the album is one here, ‘the rust that grew between telephones’, it really gives you a sense of the once spirited relationship slowly decaying and becoming estranged. I like the slice of life verses (though I don’t know if I buy the cheap rosé ). The bridge is a weak point for me, this is the first (of quite a few) unneeded fucks on the album. However, I think the lead in to the last chorus works quite nicely, and the moody, atmospheric tone is consistent throughout.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): Taylor Swift has now **officially lost the standard track length of Midnights in a row at the bottom of this rate!** Congratulations to Taylor for getting such an achievement in being panned but the raters! And I'm glad I could talk about this here on this song cause I have nothing else to say about Maroon.

=====

ImADudeDuh: #Loving this was Red (Re-e-e-ed)

**1998tweety** (10): chorus devoured

**AHSWeeknd** (10): she fought for her life trying to avoid saying “red”

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is great as well, but it sounds like a Lover reject.

**fairytalehigh** (10): no sarcasm here, just a beautiful and solid song.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (10): The most prominent complaint I’ve seen against this song is the line “so scarlet it was maroon” for being bad. And I think that’s the first hint that most people don’t or possibly refuse to get Midnights. Because fuck in the context of the album and Taylor’s larger discography, where nearly all the glamour and love has rotted into a cold, empty husks. desperately clinging onto something long passed, onto things that are long over, but you struggle to get over, remembering those memories and keeping them alive for so long they rust and do nothing but weigh you down. But I guess it’s easier to hyperfix on one specific line (which this is most mind-boggling thing about this song’s hatred, actually works) and just dismiss it than to not

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this song has bass, electric guitar, piano, synthesizer, percussion, clarinet, flute, saxophone and organ, and people still say that Jack’s production is underwhelming, fuck that. He’s a genius.

**jman457** (10): An instant fav from the album, love the background synths

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): taylor needs to lean into this type of production more, she sounds great here

**nick1372** (10): the chorus is incredible, the cheap ass-screw top rose is incredible. It's just Taylor and Jack going wild in the best way

**vayyiqra** (10): I love how the lyrics in the opening verse are so specific and tell a little story 😌 that rules

**starla\_** (9.5): my favourite track on the album. It feels like something from Lover era, in a good way. Do Americans pronounce the colour maroon like ma-ROON usually? I pronounce it ma-RONE.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): I love songs that use 250 different words for colors ok?

**nooodisaster** (9): All these wine references... But seriously, there's like a 50% chance there's a tell-all docu in 10 years that reveals Taylor was a raging alcoholic

**shhhneak** (9): Love the slowed + reverbness but I’m going to need this woman to stop singing about colours at her big age.

**TiltControls** (9): I think this is more of what I would've wanted the album to be

**UselessTacooo** (9): she is so girlypop aestheticcore

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Ah… so she still has some of that songwriting magic

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): if you ignore that she trying to make it sound like all reds are the same shade, it’s a great song

**jsonphile** (8.5): holy fuck holy fucking fuck that chorus of yours is absurd

**Poydoo** (8.5): The hook here is fantastic

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.4): Is it kind of a word salad? yes. Am I devouring that word salad and getting seconds? also yes

**jasannn** (8): does it want to be red or does it want to be reputation? make a decision!!

**masttup** (8): good song but tay doesn’t have colours down but that’s ok!

**rfbeirut** (8): thats a real fucking legacy!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): as a reputation fan i had to like this song

**Bordersz** (7.8): This song reminds me of Usher's Climax.

**aakar528** (7.5): chill

**daythreeinmiami** (7.5): Honestly, there is nothing wrong with a screw top as I currently have to finish my full bottle of Prosecco due to me not being able to get the cork back in and flat Prosecco is not the way. I mean I’m not complaining at my situation. Girlies, get on the Prosecco (only if you drink or are at drinking age pls do what you are comfortable with!)!

**jonnl2806** (7.5): Good but somewhat forgettable chorus and production

**Kayaking11116** (7.5): the production is really good

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): i feel like she spends weeks deliberating exactly where to add each fuck in her lyrics

**akanewasright** (7): some of these lyrics are dumb as hell, but idk it’s pretty at least

**avg-vag** (7): yes this is grown up red but it’s kind of mediocre and somehow makes red less impressive

**intheaftermath** (7): Red but worse

**jackisboredtoday** (7): do we think this song is gonna have multiple people giving it a 5 in order to make the “Maroon: 5” joke?

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): really like this but gets docked a few points for being a little too similar to Dress and the clunky color metaphors

#Modern day Maroon 5

**modulum83** (6.5): “so scarlet it was maroon” girl what the hell are you talking about. i can appreciate the ambient contemplative staring-out-your-hotel-window-at-the-city vibe this is going for but SO many other songs did this better

**seanderlust** (6.5): this is nitpicking but "it was so scarlet it was maroon" bestie those are two different colors.

**DraculaWeekend** (6): Zzzzz

**heysoupie** (6): rose gives me heartburn; hearing Taylor Swift use the word “fucking” feels like seeing your teacher outside of school

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): this feels like a Lover track, but I’m a bad way.

**runaway3212** (6): this song is taylor going "remember Red? I made so much money off that and you're probably nostalgic for that era... bye"

**Shelly\_AO29** (6): Pretty boring but I like the chorus.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.8): it's just one of the more filler-y 1989 or Lover tracks

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): I keep waiting for something to happen but she kinda just awkwardly drops the f bomb and leaves

**PhoneThePhoenix** (5.2): it's fine just kind of boring! I do kind of like the lyrics but musically it's so bland 😴

**bookthieving** (5): if i had a nickel for every time someone in this rate got a red stain on their shirt

**CrimsonROSET** (5): one thing about a design major is I’m gonna be annoying about colors picture the blood orange gif that’s me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): really dislike the way Taylor sings "Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how”. The jumpy part reminds me of my piano lessons as a kid and learning to play 3rds on the keys, sob. otherwise this song is a bit too washed out and reverby for me.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): taylor learns color theory

**mimins** (5): I like the instrumental but the way it was sung was very strange and didn't really match it? It feels like the lyrics should be flowing through the song but instead it's like a hard stop after every line

**nt96** (5): it nipped

**passionfruits2** (5): i feel like i've heard this song from Taylor 10 times before with different titles, and it's good, but it's also the 10th time i've heard it.

**slimboyfriend** (5): Un-yassified King of My Heart

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): Songs About Taylor

**welcome2thejam** (5): You better put those shoes back on lest you get eight whole new paragraphs on WikiFeet

**DaHumanTorch** (4.5): "so scarlet it was maroon" is the dumbest lyric ever when you think about it for more than 3 seconds

**apatel27** (4): That swear was getting in no matter how much it fucks up the melody

**frogaranaman** (4): this is my favorite color. I wear a hoodie in this color all the time. Which Speaking of I made a Tiktok back in 2020 wearing that hoodie and someone commented “I know you’re Mexican because you wear that red hoodie all the animated Mexican kids do in movies” and that Gagged me. they were fucking right. Look up Coco. Miguel Rivera.

**Birdseeding** (3): You understand that lines of text and lines of melody are meant to scan, vaguely, right? ...right? Or at least not run over on the next line in an almost comically inept doggerel way?

**bogo** (3): taylor, put the thesaurus away

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): the constant droning and the contrived lyrics make this such a slog

**cremeebrulee** (3): this hook was so bad it was photosynthesis

**moonshxne** (3): why is this sooooooooooo repetitive? also, *so scarlet, it was maroon*, really? taylor i thought your thing was writing dynamic bridges why is this one so flat

**popularsong** (3): its fine but .  so boring

**Uberpigeon** (3): maroom temperature

**vexastrae** (3): she missed the opportunity to use maroon as a verb in the sense of being stranded on an island, rip

**bulforster** (2.9): dumb lyrics comment #26385

**plastichaxan** (2.5): This is just what she has been doing for like 10 years can you come up with something else

**amr** (2): I'm ngl I burst out laughing at "so scarlet it was maroon" cos I didn't expect her to sing it so convincingly for some reason. aural sludge

**MassiveThief** (2): The writing is not good enough to support this slow paced of a song. Sounds like a terrible 1989 B side with a bit of Lover. Equally boring and tacky.

**Nagisoid** (2): You were red, and you liked me because I was blue. But you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky. Then you decided purple just wasn't for you

**shipperondeck** (2): in new york of course

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): 5

**xqra** (2): Zzz

**RandomHypnotica** (1): THAT’S NOT HOW COLOUR WORKS THAT NOT HOW ANY OF THIS WORKS AGGGGHHHHH

**Awkward\_King** (0): THIS IS SO NOTHING!!!!! everything feels hollow i dont know how to explain it, the production has no flare there is nothing interesting about it its just meandering and never goes anywhere. ai generated ass taylor swift song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Going from a great intro track straight into this absolute snooze fest …oh things started going downhill immediately.

**hikk** (0): why did she think it was a good idea to put this boring ass song as the 2nd in the tracklst..... all the momentum from lavender slayze completely gone... truly baffled as to why this is a fan fave girl if you don't stop just naming shades of red..

**Stryxen** (0): This feels like choking at dinner and people are slapping you on the back while you try to play it off

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Oh right, there's people other than Taylor Swift in this rate. And this being the lowest non-taylor song makes sense. This song *really* doesn't stick out in the 23 songs that make up SOS. Plus, it occurs very late in the tracklist where many people are starting to check out (especially if they're rushing to get their ballot done the day its due). I think some proof of how people don't care about this song is how short this comment was.

**impla77** (5): Finally we catch a glimpse of some other artists in this rate, welcome.. SZA!! There’s quite a few tracks that fall into the ‘could’ve been cut’ category for me, and this is one of them! Also quite iconic that this is the first SZA track to go with that intro

---

#So Far, So Great!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I need the distance in kilometres tho

**Kayaking11116** (10): the instrumental goes a lil crazy

**popularsong** (10): worlds best intro?

**sufjancaesar** (10): shame this doesn’t get more love bc i really fuck with her flow on the verses here and the songwriting feels like an intimate journal! overall a very cozy track for me

**UselessTacooo** (10): she does such good ocean sounds like me too girl I also woooosshshshshsgssj

**TiltControls** (9.5): I hope this goes... deep into day 3 of the results

**bluehxrizon** (9): the guy in the intro honestly spilled but why does he sound like Kyle Richards husband

**MasterWizardRyan** (9): i can unironically study to this song's beat, her lofi hip hop study beats entry

**Bordersz** (8.5): Vocals for days on this.

**jasannn** (8.5): I haven't lost myself in a relationship but this song feels exactly how I lost myself for a year after graduating.

**starla\_** (8.5): she sounds beautiful here

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): this is great as well.

**jsonphile** (8): I keep thinking she’s saying State Farm

**PhoneThePhoenix** (7.9): so far so good

**modulum83** (7.6): who the fuck is sadhguru. you couldn’t get eckhart tolle like kendrick did so you settled for this guy

**ReallyCreative** (7.6): we’re getting to the part of the album where the more formulaic traits of SOS’ hooks and melodies are becoming a detriment, this is a fine song but there are other tracks that are accomplishing this sound and vibe a lot better. Like Gone Girl sounds very similar but is just straight up better

**fairytalehigh** (7.5): suffers the unfortunate fate of being so buried in the album i don't have much to say, positive or negative

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7.5): it’s fine

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): not her fault that sza's last in the playlist but at this point thank you ratecom for keeping this a 3 album rate

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): I could easily see this one growing on me even more after the rate ends and I keep hearing it, but I have to be honest about where I’m at with it now

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): lying on the beach with your lover core

**udontwannaknownoel** (7.2): Can't remember the difference between this one and Too Late

**frogaranaman** (7): this Up sequel is cool

**Nagisoid** (7): Regina Spektor was gagged a bit

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): SZA's voice is the highlight. Decent chill bop.

**vayyiqra** (7): why did I have to listen to almost 20 tracks to get to the ones I liked most 😔

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Something about SZA’s melodic phrases just tickles my brain

#Please only play this song far, far away from me

**jman457** (6.7): this is pretty

**jonnl2806** (6): The other meh track, it just doesn't connect as much as the other tracks on the album

**masttup** (6): sounds kinda like fart every so often

**nooodisaster** (6): she's so FAR, I wish she was... Closer (JPN Bonus Track edition)

**rfbeirut** (6): another mid tempo song w a spacey beat that blends in to the others for me

**Stryxen** (6): I FART CUZ I CANT TRUST NOBODY

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i wont touch her with a 39 and a half foot pole

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): it's not a bad song but it's between two of my favourites on the album so...

**CrimsonROSET** (5): is this my least fave? maybe

**intheaftermath** (5): the middle section of the album is so far but we tread back into monotony at the end.

**oscarbrierley1** (5): I have listened to this song so many times and I still have no memory of it.

**passionfruits2** (5): "how do i deal with rejection?" maybe drop a few songs from this tracklist bc 23 tracks is not it bestie.

**Poydoo** (5): boring

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): I cannot stand this song because it sounds like she’s saying “fart”

**Awkward\_King** (4): t

**IIIHenryIII** (4): sounds like something I’m tired of hearing

**mimins** (4): boring

**aakar528** (3): not very memorable

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): three minutes going on thirty this draaaaags

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (3): this song is such a snoozefest to me

**ImADudeDuh** (7): If Taylor really meant for this song to be about dealing with a miscarriage, that is a genuinely beautiful thing.

**impla77** (4.6): Sending love to whoever needs it

---

#My love for this is bigger than the sky

**AHSWeeknd** (10): smh pro-life propaganda

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): as the eldest son of a mother who suffered miscarriage, the pain it brought on my mom's eyes when she listened to this made me cry as well, but also, a friend of mine died during the pandemic era and it really affected so much, and this song made it more heartbreaking.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Being serious here for a second, hearing about how people who have experienced miscarriages were connecting to this song was really moving. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/taylor-swift-miscarriage-bigger-than-the-whole-sky_l_6352b558e4b08e0e608e23b0 Taylor did a good job with this one.

**brendjac** (10): immediately and unalterably wrecked

**fairytalehigh** (10): assuming this is about a miscarriage, it's heart-crushing on a level like few songs in her discography. probably the best song of the era.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): if Ronan didn’t exist, this could easily be her saddest song ever

**intheaftermath** (10): maybe my hot take for the album but I think this song is beautiful. It's so wonderfully soft and full of melancholy.

**joeeswift** (10): the greys anatomy edits with this song are next level emotional

**jsonphile** (10): whatever or whoever this song may or may not be about, it’s a beautiful heartbreaking tragic song, showcasing Taylor’s writing at her finest. It’s a shame this Taylor was missing for most of the album

**runaway3212** (10): I love the sadness in this song

**TiltControls** (10): This slow ballad is the type of Taylor song I'm a sucker for. Sometimes she falls into the trap of doing too much so it's nice when she can show a bit of restraint every now and again

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): a gut punch of a song. adore the atmosphere Jack built with the production on this one

**vayyiqra** (10): So pretty with the synth and slide guitar together 😌

**jman457** (9.5): The productions and lyrics hit on this

**horridhendy** (9): This song is so pretty. One of my faves from the 3am edition.

**jaztinax** (9): honestly i had barely listened to this before the rate but it grew on me so freaking fast. as a come in with the rain/afterglow/last kiss girl i should’ve known better than to underestimate this one

**jonnl2806** (9): As a cis male I got emotional about a miscarriage I have never had

**oscarbrierley1** (9): the production is LUSH. It works really well with her voice.

**poemforsmallthings** (9): <3

**poppinmmolly** (9): y'all are gonna tank this for being slow but it makes me CRY 😭😭

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.8): So heartbreaking and I'm deeply sorry to anyone who relates to these lyrics

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): her atmospheric slay

**1998tweety** (8.5): me @ my friend Panda

**akanewasright** (8.3): I’m not big on the chorus, but JESUS these verses are devastating

**shipperondeck** (8.1): kinda sounds like a christian worship song but it works for her

**modulum83** (8): nostalgia for the golden age of jack antonoff

**Stryxen** (8): girl bye girl bye girl bye

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): shout out to the person who theorized this was about taylor having an abortion funeral

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): not her calling this person fat wtf

**starla\_** (7.5): I don't listen to this much cos it's too sad but I do enjoy it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): sure!

**daythreeinmiami** (7): I respect Taylor for causing me and my friends to have a drunken discussion at the bar on whether or not this was her experience or if she wrote in the perspective of a friend (I was in the camp of she wrote it from a friends experience).

**Nagisoid** (7): "Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears" Taylor after seeing her rate results:

**nick1372** (7): This is better than half of the main album

**rfbeirut** (7): sad

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): much better lyricism, this actually feels like she put effort into it

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): she said the thing! wait I'm not that far into the bonus tracks

**PhoneThePhoenix** (6.8): does have kind of an expansive vibe!

#goodbye goodbye goodbye

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6.5): is this album just b-sides and rejects from her last 4 albums?

**pastapixal** (6.5): it's pretty but it's a bit boring production wise

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.4): me thinking about the rabb.it app

**thedoctordances1940** (6.2): there are some really nice bits here but most of it isn't very interesting is it

**CrimsonROSET** (6): wait this isn’t would’ve could’ve should’ve? but

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Cool I guess Taylor

**vexastrae** (6): that one tweet of steven yeun captioned with the chorus is genuinely so funny to me bc op was reacting to l\*n manuel miranda being cast as hermes in the percy jackson disney+ show and they wanted steven yeun to be cast but people didnt know the context so everybody thought steven yeun died ... top 10 moments in pjotwt history

**emayzee** (5.7): this is what solar power antis hear listening to that album

**Shelly\_AO29** (5): Damn, I'm just not feeling the more mid-tempo songs on this album.

**frogaranaman** (4): your mom joke. idk. I’m running out of content with this boring ass album

**nt96** (3): it accumulated frequent flier miles

**plastichaxan** (3): I remember liking Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve and I thought it was this when I heard it I was scared for my average I was so bored

**aakar528** (2): i don't know what to think of this

**amr** (2): genuinely thought one of my friends wrote a lyric in this song cos she always tweets it when minorly inconvenienced and I'd never heard the song until now

**Awkward\_King** (2): thats so big

**Kayaking11116** (2): I'm not a slow song hater, but goddamn I feel like snoozing

**passionfruits2** (2): literally feels like i've listened to this song on this very album already

**Uberpigeon** (2): you will never be kate bush

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Feel bad about my score because I looked up "Don Toliver Controversy" after some comments were very mad at him and ohh I understand why now. I do maintain that his presence on the song is a positive one. It's good to have another person bring something new on this album... but maybe choose someone else next time pls

**impla77** (6.8): Great hook, but overall just okay

---

#I could get used to this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Gotta say…Don kinda outsells SZA on this song.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): noitssad

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): The first half of this album is so jam-packed with amazing songs! Love the production on this, really reminds me of Ctrl. Wasn't feeling Don Toliver's feature at first but it's grown on me.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): nothing to say but it's a bop

**moonshxne** (9.7): !!!

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.6): great instrumentation great feature

**Poydoo** (9.5): I almost gave this a 6.7 but I actually really do like this song

**AHSWeeknd** (9): they killed it as expected.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): the feature fits.

**frogaranaman** (9): me when asked what my ex made me feel

**Kayaking11116** (9): yes ma'am

**welcome2thejam** (9): Might have been an 11 contender with a stronger ending after the Don Toliver verse

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): the bridge is SOOOO good but it’s so short, I need more!

**shipperondeck** (8.8): me when im anakin skywalker's master (bitch im obi-wan)

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.8): My sanity is also at a 6.7. I don't know what that means, but I agree

**fairytalehigh** (8.6): BITCH I'M OBI WAN

**akanewasright** (8.5): I am pretending I don’t know anything about Don Tolliver

**Awkward\_King** (8): my headphones when they break every 2 months

**intheaftermath** (8): I haven't really decided where I stand on this album. It's a good album, like it's all very enjoyable, but nothing's really standing out in the way that Renaissance did.

**jonnl2806** (8): Sometimes I missed being used as a hole...

**MassiveThief** (8): don ate

**masttup** (8): poinsettia reference 🔥 🔥

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): pretty good

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I actually really don tolivers part, or else this song would blend in more with everything else around it

**mimins** (7.5): really like the beat on this one

**vexastrae** (7.5): the raters who will give this 6.7 are veryyyyy funny

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): 16 more songs to go, i dont know how many more snarky comments i have left in my arsenal

**modulum83** (7.4): every don toliver hook sounds exactly the same but it’s a good ass hook

**Birdseeding** (7): Her melody crafting is fascinating

**jasannn** (7): My mind can’t comprehend how used sounded differently in the two ways during the opening line

**nooodisaster** (7): Don brings a great change of pace. Lyrically good. Yeah!

#How could losed if I'm already used? Like...

**popularsong** (7): i actually like the feature but his voice is kinda grating lmao. "i feel like its oooover, something calling to get cloooser" is a great catchy hook though

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): this is cute but it ends just before I would be starting to really care

**nick1372** (6.5): First song on the album that's at all skippable, mostly because Don Toliver is so much less engaging of a presence than SZA

**aakar528** (6): too short, good beat

**CrimsonROSET** (6): sza out here using the force

**DaHumanTorch** (6): we hate you don toliver

**oscarbrierley1** (6): who is Don tolliver and why is he on every r&b girlie album.

**passionfruits2** (6): don toliver lowkey ate her up here his part is so much better than hers

**TiltControls** (6): on one hand misandry is a common issue in rate results. on the other hand i pretty much always forget this song exists and would not be sad to see it go

**vayyiqra** (6): Feel like I've seen this guy's name so many times but barely heard his music ... anyway this is fine 😔

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Eh

**xqra** (6): SZA's parts are really good but I wish she made a solo version of this instead of Open Arms :( I really don't vibe with Don Toliver here

**Bordersz** (5.5): Sound is promising but then Don Toliver takes up too much time/space on this ringtone song.

**1998tweety** (5): minus one point for Don Toliver but the rest is alright

**jman457** (5): Idk mid

**runaway3212** (5): used rhymes with snoozed which is what I would do to this song

**starla\_** (5): would be better without the feature, Don Toliver is boring

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): is this supposed to be an interlude, because honestly this doesnt feel like a full song to me

**heysoupie** (4.6): really forgettable.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (4): one of these days I will like a song with a man on it

**MarioDesigns** (3): Love Don on the song, but SZA on this song just doesn't do it for me.

**UselessTacooo** (3): why did she call the next song snooze and not this one

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): can the basement that is known as d*n toliver just collapse already

**Nagisoid** (2): The way this was going so well until Don Toliver came in. Someone ban him from doing no energy features on every R&B and hip-hop album under the sun, I beg you...

**Stryxen** (1): hate his vocals here

**IIIHenryIII** (0): I can’t get used to this one

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Fuck you, this is such a fun song. It has terrible lyrics but guess what? It fucking slays. This is like Taylor's Version of PURE/HONEY and its 10000x more embarassing but sometimes to have fun, you need to be a little embarassing. Also, this is the second most controversial song in the rate.

**impla77** (10): Incredibly robbed idc idc. This isn’t a guilty pleasure, its a straight up justified pleasure. I don’t think every song has to have deep lyrics (especially if it is a bop) , and this is a megabop!

#Karma Karma Karma Karma Karma Chameleon

**akanewasright** (10): [this is the best video on the internet](https://youtu.be/V3LsomyHviU)

**amr** (10): what can I say I love cats

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Very stupid! Very dumb! I like it a lot!

**brendjac** (10): It’s so cringy but…….. so catchy

**cremeebrulee** (10): the best song of all time i couldn't believe it

**daythreeinmiami** (10): ‘Karma is a cat purring on my lap cause it loves me’ is a fucking iconic lyric yas Taylor represent us crazy cat ladies.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (10): this broke my campdar (complimentary)

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): KARMA IS MY BOYFRIEND KARMA IS A GOD!!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): my brain turns off and my ears turn on when I hear this. Suddenly Taylor has been forgiven for the past 4 songs

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Sounwave X Taylor album when???????

**jaztinax** (10): so if karma is her boyfriend and a god, does that mean that god is her bf? also, if karma also is a cat purring on her lap, is her boyfriend god in the form of a cat? is she dating a cat? i knew she was a cat lover but idk about this

**jman457** (10): Imagine if Karma was the second single instead of Bejeweled

**katycat162534** (10): Love the idea of finding comfort in karma, as opposed to how it is usually portrayed.

**lipe18090** (10): My favorite song of the album, would be my 11 if I could do one for each album

**mysario** (10): the

**PSSST12** (10): Now this is The definition of CAMP. I don't want yall ugly hoes disrespecting the lyrics because thats the things that gives this song ✨Personality✨

**seanderlust** (10): yes the lyrics are dumb but i was singing along to the chorus in the middle of the work day so

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): FINALLY. A SONG I ENJOY. The chorus is so fun to sing along to.

**Stryxen** (10): silly satirical smash I DONT CARE this makes me dance and smile and rejoice jovially

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): now this is how you be cunty yes i'm looking at you vig\*l\*nte sh\*t

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): this song makes absolutely no sense and i just know she wrote it solely because of the Karma fan theories, but it's so catchy and fun and irresistible

**Uberpigeon** (10): kermit is my boyfriend, kermit is a frog, kermit is a little green amphibian, kermits living in the swamp, kermits in space hes an astronaut, sweet like honey kermit with a hat, kermits drinking tea cause he loves tea, flexing like a goddamn acrobat, me and kermit vibe like that

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.5): this one is satisfying!

**modulum83** (9.3): an overwhelming sea of flickering neon lights in a vast nighttime city

**jasannn** (9.2): its so unserious i love it

**babadork** (9): This should be annoying, but it somehow works for me.

**bookthieving** (9): if this makes day 3 i will vote for the last day 2 song for songeniality as an apology

**Bordersz** (9): Love the chorus.

**intheaftermath** (9): i made my younger siblings listen to this album when it first dropped and it was their favorite track. One of them sings it as "Connor is my boyfriend" as in Connor Murphy from Dear Evan Hansen which might be a bit worrying but hey it's fine

**Poydoo** (9): Whenever I hear this song it always bugs me because she says "me and karma vibe like that" when the correct grammar would be "karma and I vibe like that". -1 point for bad grammar

**poemforsmallthings** (8.9): i remember reading the lyrics when the album leaked and feeling like i was being pranked... imagine how i felt when this ended up being one of my favorite songs

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.9): Catchy and campy as fuck. When the Doja Cat remix of this song hits #1 this summer, then what?

**1998tweety** (8.5): i always hear "my panties make your crown"

**avg-vag** (8.5): it doesn’t make sense but it’s a bonafide bop

**horridhendy** (8.5): Despite some questionable lyrics, I actually really like this one. It's super catchy and fun.

**runaway3212** (8.5): this is actually hitting less recently

**starla\_** (8.5): I hate myself for enjoying this as much as I do. It's so stupid but such a bop. I'm only human

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): is this song dumb? yes. it is still fun? also yes.

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): I do not care that this reads like a kindergarteners first poem it ate

**bulforster** (8.3): yah okay the camp defenders got me, this bops

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): would be a 10 with better lyrics tbh the production and melody are gorj

**CrimsonROSET** (8): PONCHO EN FIESTA FOR YOU ITS NOT

**Frajer** (8): if karma is both a cat and her boyfriend by the transitive property her boyfriend is a cat who is a relaxing thot

**QuaxlyDuck** (8): i could think its silly and petty but it's too fun to sing about karma being a cat

**rfbeirut** (8): more great bratty vocals

**Roxieloxie** (8): Boy, this karma talk English, Spanish and French (hello) Boy, this karma talk Euros, Dollars and Yens (oww) Boy, this karma talk Bentleys, Rovers and Benz Boy, this karma fly private to islands, to M's Sweet like honey, pussy is a cat Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me Flexing like a goddamn acrobat Me and pussy vibe like that

ImADudeDuh: #Bad Karma (ft. Joan Jett)

**MrMoodle** (7): this one obviously has some clunkers (“me and karma vibe like that” ew) but i do like “karma’s a relaxing thought, aren’t you envious that for you it’s not”, i like very shimmery but deeply spiteful pop songs

**nooodisaster** (7): HATED this song until I heard a review of someone who described this as a song was for the girlies who pay their taxes, separate their recycling, return their books on time. Ohhh! It's not a cringey bad bitch anthem. It's Ben Wyatt's theme song.

**nt96** (7): Got Karma Police on speed dial, arrest this girl.

**passionfruits2** (7): reputation vibes are present somewhat but the chorus is very good so i ignore it for a bit

**pastapixal** (7): the lyrics are a bit silly but i still love this song

**Treecoh** (7): now why does miss jet fuel pollution think she has good karma? polluting our airwaves with her music

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): i'm just constantly shocked by how bad her lyrics are on this album, like this was never anywhere near as much of an issue for her, bad lyrics seemed to be one-offs, often contrasted by songs with fantastic lyrics, and not a consistent threat throughout her albums but they just drag down so many songs here. I'm generally able to overlook lyrics but if they're just so plainly bad they can really pull down otherwise good songs

**Kayaking11116** (6.5): this one is fun

**MasterWizardRyan** (6.5): the urge to tank is strong with this one but i can't deny this song is very catchy

**jsonphile** (6): Karma is a chameleon we learned this in 1982 from Culture Club

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): good bridge

**nootnoot781** (6): as long as i don't consider the fact that that taylor is 32 years old, this song is mildly enjoyable.

**oscarbrierley1** (6): the lyrics are kind of cringy, but the instrumental has enough energy to keep me entertained.

**cocosairdep** (5): the production is kinda fun but some of these lyrics istg

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): this is terrible (affectionate)

**dreamingpastel** (5): Slick production but (Miley Cyrus voice) what does it mean?

**Nagisoid** (5): Me and this song don't vibe at all

**moonshxne** (4.5): at least it's catchy

**DaHumanTorch** (4): poncho en fiesta por you it's not

**Hulnia** (4): cringe

**popularsong** (4): the chorus melody is very catchy and cute but "flexing like an acrobat me and karma vibe like that" yall really listen to this thats crazy

**aakar528** (3): good production but what are these lyrics lmfao

**heysoupie** (3): this song is straight up embarrassing to listen to. How was no one like actually karma is none of this things, ma’am.

**mimins** (3): this one's just plain annoying

**slimboyfriend** (3): “spider boy king of thieves weave your little web of opacity”… she needs someone to tell her no

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): karma is a lego block underneath your toe

**nick1372** (2.5): You can do better than this bestie

**Awkward\_King** (2): me and my boyfriend both have two syllable names and so we use the melody of it to sing "___ is my boyfriend" however this is actually a BAD thing as we both do not like taylor swift

**DevilsOfLoudun** (2): This is a children's song, worse than ME!

**just\_thonking** (2): Karma is my neck, karma is my back, karma is my pussy and my crack

**apatel27** (1): I know this is about a random relationship but Taylor set a horde on a random actor playing a bratty 15 year old on screen over a joke that is meant to paint the character in a bad light. How can you do that yet unironically sing "I keep my side of the street clean"

**bogo** (1): i'm having a stroke

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): the jumpy synths are annoying. I don’t like the chorus either

**frogaranaman** (1): I’m sorry but I just can’t imagine myself being this much of a vindictive loser when I’m at her grown age

**jonnl2806** (1): Karma is me having to listen to song

**plastichaxan** (1): Karma will get to her for making a song this bad about it

**ReallyCreative** (1): this song is so lucky Vigilante Shit exists

**shhhneak** (1): You cannot convince me this is camp.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i cant believe im listening to a song this bad and its not getting my 0

**TiltControls** (1): given how she does in rates I don't think karma actually likes her that much

**vexastrae** (1): theres an alternate universe where charli xcx finally drops the long awaited highly rumored unreleased song taxi but its an embarrassingly bad song that i never want to hear again. this is that song

**AHSWeeknd** (0): this is something Taylor Swift would enjoy

**DraculaWeekend** (0): Karma is a 0

**jackisboredtoday** (0): I truly despise this one, it’s Taylor at her most smug and proudly embracing the petty feuds that I was so excited to hear her maturing past on long story short… between the regression when it comes to themes, the 1989 wannabe production, and some of the worst lyrics she’s used in years, this song is almost an exact match for the thing i wanted least from her

**masttup** (0): (sue Sylvester voice) I’m sorry I just can’t even… excuse me

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): I considered making a joke-y "there's a lot of assays here so I won't say anything" but I really think I have to as this is one of the most controversial songs in this rate, and possibly on r/popheads? 

 Is Anti-Hero good? I think yes. Are there bad lyrics in the song? Yes, but not the ones most people would think. I don't really like the chorus of "It's me, hi, I'm the problem" because it's so clearly tiktok bait. It feels like Taylor wanted to make a personal song for herself, but she adds a chorus to make it a hit, which uhh why the fuck would she want to do that. I really like the "congressman" line and the "vices/devices/crisis" line. And the sexy baby line does come out of nowhere, but come on. Think about it for more than 6 seconds and you'll understand what she means. This song is not perfect but I feel like it's greater than the sum of its parts. 

 Also, this song was pretty solidly in day 2 for most of the rate, but the last 2 weeks of the rate, it just got a bunch of 0s (it had none before then) and it fell to being a day 1 tragedy. It must be exhausting rooting for a song with some bad lyrics.

**impla77** (7.5): I still can’t really believe this is her longest running billboard no1, I feel like it isn’t as ubiquitous as some 1989 era singles were. Anyway, I think with this, we can officially declare that we are ‘Out of the Woods’ where Taylor picks the worst songs from her album for the first two singles. I don’t think this is a great song, I feel the verses are a bit disjointed, but the chorus is catchy. I was not expecting this to be so divisive.. but here we are.

ImADudeDuh: #These people must be exhausted

**bogo** (11): listen leave me be i relate to this song way too much and it just hits

**FlavaSavaVandal** (11): i think this song broke me a decent bit. I mean it’s quite cringe but it’s honest in a way I don’t think even Taylor really realised. I mean Taylor spent an entire decade dealing with people calling her the problem in relationships for a lot of bullshit reasons. It’s just an open admission that she is too much, and as someone who is also just too much I related. I put it on repeat, I mouthed along to it. And it brought up a lot of deep-seated feelings of self-hatred of all the flaws you’ve tried to change but haven’t figured out how to yet, and the nightmares you feel like will happen sooner or later if you can’t figure it out. With the big realisation that you’re doing it all to yourself and you’re just an exhausting person. And while I am not taylor swift and a lot of our problems aren’t the same, it’s that emotional core that really translates for me, it might just be my favourite song by her

**katycat162534** (11): The ultimate bop!! The lyrics, the production and the music video, everything about it is perfect!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): why is it so hard for her to release a lead pop single that doesn’t have an annoying bridge??

**babadork** (10): I think Taylor and I read the same Jezebel article 15 years ago, because the sexy baby line seems reasonable to me.

**bluehxrizon** (10): literally the first time she's chosen the correct lead single for a pop album

**CrimsonROSET** (10): FINE she can have one

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Story time, I cried driving to work listening to this song a few months ago because I was so proud of u/numptea and this song. That’s it that’s my story. Yes I know it’s me hi, I’m the problem it’s me.

**dreamingpastel** (10): What Todd in the Shadows said.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Todd was right, this is the best hit song of the last year

**intheaftermath** (10): my music professor made us analyze this song in class and tbh I've enjoyed it a lot more since. Like there are literally spooky "ooooo" sounds in the instrumental when Taylor says "ghosted". That's so cute! Really looking into this song totally elevated it for me.

**joeeswift** (10): I feel like this is the most polarising song in this entire rate? I love it though

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): I like this song better than most people server do but Taylor Swift is the most boring person to be labeled an "anti-hero"

**musical\_pyn** (10): I don't think I have ever had a song grow on me the way this has. If we rated the album when midnights came out this would have gotten like a 3 from me but something clicked and now I think it's one of taylor's best songs

**nick1372** (10): Okay, I get the instinct to dismiss this as a cynical ploy for sympathy, to make herself seem relatable in order to engineer a viral tiktok sound. And I'm not saying Anti-Hero isn't that, but viewing your pop music through that kind of cynical lens just seems frustrating and depressing. If you take Anti-Hero at face value, it's a portrait of a deeply flawed woman who is aware of her own flaws but can only truly understand them through unhealthy self-deprecation or irony. This character that Taylor is speaking through -- whether or not it is fully accurate to her own true mindset -- is still incredibly compelling if only because we rarely get to see songs about someone trying to figure all this mental health stuff out and only halfway succeeding. I'm tired of consuming media where it seems like everyone has gone to therapy for years and sorted their feelings into easy-to-consume boxes. I love that Anti-Hero is messy and immediate; it's a breath of fresh air in the same way that thank u, next was. (P.S. the sexy baby line is great y'all suck. I do think it would be better switched around with the monster on the hill line so that the context is provided before the weird metaphor. Taylor please hire me as your editor please please please).

**nooodisaster** (10): I hate when really popular songs are actually really good too.

**Poydoo** (10): Todd was right

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): i know it's cool to pretend like Taylor's lead singles are always bad but imo this song is too fun to dislike. At first I thought she was doing her self-referential Blank Space thing, but as Todd pointed out, Blank Space creates a caricature from media sensationalism. Anti-Hero actually acknowledges her flaws (or, just creates a caricature from twitter/tiktok discourse).

**runaway3212** (10): Taylor writing a song with arguably her weirdest lyrics ever and turning it into one of the best songs of her career like who's doing it like her

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i can't wait for the follow up singles Synecdoche and Oxymoron

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): a career highlight. maybe an unpopular opinion but this feels Blank Space-esque in addressing the criticisms of her head-on with excellent songwriting

**UselessTacooo** (10): sometimes I DO feel like everyone’s a sexy baby and I’m a monster on the hill

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes it is not great rooting for this album! 😌

**akanewasright** (9.9): I’m not defending this score

**jonnl2806** (9.7): Relatable tbh

**horridhendy** (9.5): Love this. I had it fully on repeat when it came out. I am docking a half-point for the sexy baby line though.

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.5): she wrote this after watching swifties defend her in teatime threads after the private plane situation

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): yes yes sexy baby yes yes self deprecation specifically calculated to be relatable but goddamn i cant get that chorus out of my head

**Roxieloxie** (9.4): She was like what if i dropped mirrorball two years later and made it 80s and a tiktok hit and locked antoff in the studio and he came out with this and ill take it!

**udontwannaknownoel** (9.4): I think we're ALL sexy babies. Outlasted Shake It Off at #1 for a reason

**jasannn** (9.2): hey kids, rhyming is fun!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): the hit single about intrusive thoughts bookwormed itself inside of my head like LSD, but better because it's actually a great lead single.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Yes there’s a few horrifically cringey lyrics here…but I don’t really care it’s catchy and sounds good and I’ll take that.

**fairytalehigh** (9): would've been a 10 but she gets a full point docked for that excruciating narcissism/altruism/congressman rhyme. we get it girlie you own a thesaurus

**jsonphile** (9): honestly you can thank Mr. Todd in the Shadows for giving me more appreciation for this song. Both in his top ten list and also on his podcast when he connected this song to Shiv Roy from Succession

**just\_thonking** (9): Still hilarious that people were getting upset about the sexy baby line. Like of all the things to dislike about this song/album you chose the silliest one

**heysoupie** (8.9): I really love the little breaks in the vocals here; I love that this feels like a REAL song, like a song that reveals some self-awareness, but also retains a lot of the classic (I think?) TSwift songwriting quirks.

**modulum83** (8.9): this is so good if you go to youtube and search Anti-Hero Official Instrumental and listen to that instead

**lipe18090** (8.5): I liked it more but it's been overplayed

**seanderlust** (8.5): i can't explain why i like this so much. yes i am sick of hearing it on the radio, yes i hear the sexy baby line, yes the part of the verse with "vices and thrices and mices" or whatever isn't actually very good, idk i just like hearing this!! i may not buy her portrayal of this emotion but it's an emotion i've felt so i can at least connect it to personal memories.

**starla\_** (8.5): this grew on me and now I can appreciate the sexy baby line

**xqra** (8.3): Stupidly catchy and fun

**Birdseeding** (8): This does feel like the hit it totally deserved to become. Minus one for more scanning issues - why is it so difficult to match lyrics and melody?

**MassiveThief** (8): has grown on me the more I hear it. I do have to make myself black out for a second when she says \*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* or else it's a 0.

**MrMoodle** (8): this chorus has wormed itself into my brain like a parasite, every time someone says it’s me i think of her it’s terrible i’ve been pavlov dogged by taylor swift

**Nagisoid** (8): Congressmen are actually swifties so she was right

**passionfruits2** (8): i hate that i like this song

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Besides that one line that's supposed to be a 30 Rock reference but just comes out sounding very sus, this song is pretty good. The Illenium remix slaps.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Whoever said that Taylor wrote this album so every line could be an Instagram quote… I've never forgotten that

**welcome2thejam** (8): You crazy for this one Todd

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): the only part of this album I heard before the release was “I stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror/it must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero” and I was so convinced that this album was going to be a lyrical masterpiece….. lol

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): was planning on hating this on another relisten, but the melody is one of her best (although a bit annoying). Still cannot stand the woe is me energy the song gives off even though I understand it is her being aware of who she is and how she struggles with her image. But for someone as rich as her and with the ability to live the life she lives and hide what she wants, I can’t sympathize with this fully

**pastapixal** (7.7): one of the best songs Taylor's released in a long time

**Frajer** (7.5): singing about a theoretical daughter in law when you don't even have kids yet is so unhinged

=====

ImADudeDuh: #Anti-Hero Antis

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): Still baffled by why she tried so hard to ruin this track with the lyrics. The chorus on this song is one of the few high points of the album and is genuinely great, but the lyrics outside of the chorus so plainly suck that I can't go any higher than this

**jman457** (7.3): For as big as this was, Taylor has had better songs

**moonshxne** (7.1): I'll actually defend the "sexy baby" line -- I think it's a bold and incisive way to clearly express how out-of-place she feels. Generally, she actually has some cutting lyrics here; but, the MV's cringe funeral scene definitely just detracts from the bridge.

**1998tweety** (7): when this song first came out I saw so many of yall gag that Taylor mentioned us so I meticulously looked over the lyrics to see any mention of the word "popheads" but then I learned it was just about the teatime line.

**masttup** (7): ppl trying to save this talking about 30 Rock as if Taylor’s millennial ass doesn’t just watch friends and be like ross and Rachel 🥺

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): people who call this one of Taylor’s best singles, are we listening to different songs? This is so unremarkable as a lead I’m sorry.

**oscarbrierley1** (7): without the sexy baby line it would be an eight or nine, because it's a pretty good vocal performance for her and the production is pretty, but that line really takes me out of it.

**rfbeirut** (7): sure

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i would love this song if not for the bridge part where she slows down alot and starts breathing heavy, i really hate that part

**jaztinax** (6.5): what IS a sexy baby???

**bulforster** (6.4): does she need to breathe in the paper bag?

**TiltControls** (6): I was originally going to give this a 1, but after hearing the song more and seeing the MV I think I get the song. I don't know if I actually like it - the note choices on the verses feel off to me and some of the lyrics could've definitely been better written - but I get what she was going for.

**shhhneak** (5.6): This is about as camp as you can get singing about your eating disorder.

**Awkward\_King** (5): for every good thing about this song there's another, terrible thing about it. but it does bop a little to me unfortunately.

**PhoneThePhoenix** (4.9): I think the first part of the refrain is not great (for some reason the "teatime" rhyme annoys me), but it comes around by the end. I think the bridge is the best part! I do the it's a cool concept to deal with lyrically.

**aakar528** (4.5): good production, generic lyrics (very overrated)

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): that sexy baby line is like a forbidden arcane riddle that unleashes an ancient curse upon humanity. It’s a statement that alludes to some absolutely unhinged truth about a person like “I’m not able to make emotional space for this friendship any longer.” or “This jockstrap is my probation officer’s favorite”

**DraculaWeekend** (4): The sexy baby line ruins this but at least it's memorable

**Kayaking11116** (4): this one is very mid, like the lyrics are kinda cringe but also it's just not really my type of song

**Shelly\_AO29** (4): The 'sexy baby' lyric killed this song for me. I know it's not meant to be taken literally or whatever but I just can't stand it.

**Stryxen** (4): itz me O.O hai ^_^ I'm the pwoblem ;~; itz meee xD

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): im so tired

**apatel27** (3): It's just a nothing burger

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): i'm a swiftie too I love Gulliver's Travels

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (2): If I wanted to hear languid, toothless electropop sold like it's a banger, I'd pop an early Bleachers album

**shipperondeck** (2): why does she say anti-hero like that

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): this is one of those songs where the production is cute and the melody catchy but it's very meghan trainor-coded in that the lyrics are complete ass and that's extra disappointing from taylor

**cocosairdep** (1): this is so cringy sorry

**cremeebrulee** (1): taylor has no idea to how to write any sort of self-awareness, which makes this song not only poorly written but just straight up irritating, the "woe is me" chorus especially. genuinely one of the worst hits recently and a huge blight in her discography

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): a lot of the lyrics here are clunky and bad. This is not my zero because the lyrics "I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror” I do think are clever. Everything surrounding it though I strongly dislike. Production sounds like I’m overhearing a Lisa Loeb album muffled from the apartment next door to me.

**frogaranaman** (1): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/912870063411970118/1070779089008476200/image.png

**Hulnia** (1): this gets more annoying every time i hear it

**mimins** (1): I know she did not just say that she feels like everybody is a sexy baby...also this sounds like the type of song they start playing in a dead silent church right before the priest drops the biggest verse of their career and everyone starts swaying their hands in prayer

**popularsong** (1): im sure there will be enough comments decimating the sexy baby line

**Treecoh** (1): the congressman line alone

**Uberpigeon** (1): this has the same vibes of something my emo girl friends in year 7 would have posted on facebook

**vexastrae** (1): girl you call the fbi you are NOT an anti-hero

**amr** (0): I don't like this song at all but I'll admit part of this score is cos a few hours earlier I was watching the final 5 episodes of you and they played this in the finale and I was just really mad they'd made me listen to a song from this album for the first time against my will. but it doesn't help that this sounds like the kind of music that plays in my head when looking at stock photos of cityscapes (negative)

**DaHumanTorch** (0): this is seriously one of the worst written hit songs of the decade so far

**dream\_fighter2018** (0): this is the smarmiest song of 2022. Something about it just enrages me. Maybe it’s that damn chorus, which sounds like something a 14 year old would write in their diary when their friends go to the mall without them. Maybe it’s how cynical Taylor makes me feel - this feels like an elaborate marketing exercise dedicated to creating a character rather than being in any way listenable or enjoyable. Maybe it’s the “sexy baby” metaphor, which doesn’t work on any level, especially since she tried to combine two different metaphors that conjure up two different images and neither quite work with the other. It’s zero fun, and feels lazy, haphazard and substanceless. If there was one thing that could convince me that poptimism was a mistake, it’s this song.

**nt96** (0): A woman of color makes a music video involving her personal issues and an unseasoned girl slithers in and steals the idea. Fuck Taylor and this boring song.

**plastichaxan** (0): Maybe you’re the problem

**RandomHypnotica** (0): The fact that Taylor has called this her favourite song she has ever written is genuinely baffling, for so many reasons. The idea of writing this song about the struggles of living as one of the most successful people in the world, and the unseen tolls it takes isn't awful, and done with tact, it could even work. But there is no tact here, these lyrics are some of the most embarassingly cheap and cliche things Taylor has ever sung,  the bridge is absolutely awful (wtf is that weirdly slowing rhythm it's so offputting and the forced vocal fry is just uncomfortable) and the fact that it's her most successful song tied with Blank Space hurts my brain.

**sufjancaesar** (0): still salty this charted so strongly and the 1 million remixes only make it worse

**TragicKingdom1** (0): i didnt hate this as much as the other taylor leads initially but every radio play dragged it down further and further

**impla77** (6.5): Travis really does nothing for me here, and its another song which is pretty but forgettable

**ImADudeDuh** (3): I feel kinda bad for not liking this because this is a song where SZA sounds genuinely happy. Unlike Low, Travis Scott does not work on this song for me. Travis' verse kinda comes out of nowhere and does not fit the production and vibe of the song, which I'm already not a big fan of. The slow guitar driven background is fine but the rest of the song is just, eh. It really peaks when we get to hear SZA's grandmother at the beginning.

---

#Grand opening

**jasannn** (10): this is one of those songs I can't sing outloud with tearing up. I feels like a big warm hug.

**pastapixal** (10): i hate that i love Trav's verse, but it really is a great song

**xqra** (10): An absolutely beautiful song, it didn't stick out on my first listen but one day it just hit me and had me crying like a baby lol. The voice memo from SZA's grandma is perfect and her voice shines here

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): sza and unneccesary travis features name a more iconic duo

**seanderlust** (9.5): SZA's grandma's voice at the top of this track honestly relaxes me so much.

**akanewasright** (9): I get teary at SZA’s Granny’s voice message every time

**modulum83** (9): gonna need that travis scott indie folk album expeditiously

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): would be a 10 if it was just solo but still great

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): I zone out on the Travis Scott verse every time, but sza is serving the emotion. The solo version is a ten.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): beautiful song and beautiful vocals and travis actually delivers

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): this song just makes me feel warm

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): travis why are you here ❤️

**jman457** (8.1): This is nice and pretty

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this is gonna go too soon because of a feat isn’t it

**frogaranaman** (8): don’t make these comments weird y’all

**rfbeirut** (8): think this is very smart for travis's first (?) major crossover feature post astroworld, a very gentle loving song

**Shelly\_AO29** (8): SZA's grandma makes an appearance (RIP). Love the guitar in the background. A really nice, chill song.

**TiltControls** (8): technically this travis feature is really good, but sza was slaying her part so hard that I kind of wish she did this solo

**Uberpigeon** (8): i thought back shots was like. drinking a shot from someones back. i guess i got it confused with body shots

**welcome2thejam** (8): WTF a lighter just materialized in my hand and now I'm waving it

**udontwannaknownoel** (7.6): Now why was Travis Scott there?

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): feels like a grower

**jsonphile** (7.5): fun fact this actually uses a chord progression quite similar to open arms by Journey

**PhoneThePhoenix** (7.5): not a standout for me but it's pretty good!

**shipperondeck** (7.5): wail emoji

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Ctrl deep cut

**MToms** (7.3): The last part should be a different song altogether.

**aakar528** (7): calm

**amr** (7): cute ^_^

**dreamingpastel** (7): The background vocals are really nice

**Hulnia** (7): hate how travis released astroworld and then decided to stop being good :(

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Travis’ softest verse (in a good way?)

**Kayaking11116** (7): was also cute

**ReallyCreative** (7): it’s crazy how unnecessary Travis Scott is on this track, like I think this track would be perfect as a 2-minute closer that ends right before his verse

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s very reassuring to know that even SZA’s filler-sounding tracks are still kinda chill and pretty… now let’s talk about your collab choices ma’am

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): let me [LOVE] inside ya let me plant that [AFFECTION] inside ya

#Don't touch me

**jonnl2806** (6.5): Travis does nothing for me on this

**nooodisaster** (6.5): fuck im such a slut for SZA ballads even the horrible ones i love

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): Not really sure if Travis was needed on this track but eh, if it works it works.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): well at least its better than love galore

**1998tweety** (6): this would be a 9 if it was the solo version, I'm not even saying that just cause its Travis Scott, the solo version just sounds better

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Travis couldn’t keep up on her level

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): I think this is a filler, IMO, still good regardless.

**Birdseeding** (6): folk-pop-Spotify-playlist acoustic guitar just doesn't feel right. Travis Scott slots in surprisingly well though!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): And thus concludes the satanic stretch of the album as far as my scores go.

**mimins** (6): cute, not feeling the feature much tho

**popularsong** (6): the chorus is mindblowingly beautiful but i dont care for the rest of the song as much esp travis verse

**Poydoo** (6): boring

**runaway3212** (6): we love to hear it

**starla\_** (5.5): lacks energy

**heysoupie** (5): travis scott sucks

**vayyiqra** (5): this isn't Creed 😔 wait that part at the end was unexpected

**Bordersz** (4.5): It is so good and then we get to Travis...like why is he on an acoustic song. His robotic sound ruined the vibe.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): a man? in my all women's album rate?

**horridhendy** (3.5): This just isn't doing much for me. I hate the vocal modulation in the feature.

**Nagisoid** (3): Can we stop these mediocre m*n from ruining SZA's songs? please and thank you

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): mine are closed

**fairytalehigh** (1): we as a society have moved past the need for travis scott

**passionfruits2** (1): fuck Travis Scott

**babadork** (0): I can’t listen to Travis Scott without thinking about Astroworld.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): First off, I didn't like Hit Different. I found it pretty boring and a bit of a nothing song. I was kinda surprised to see a bunch of people upset that the song didn't make it to the tracklist. And this song is alright, but this is the point of the album where some songs start to blending together unless they were memorable. It's still a good song but I couldn't tell you any parts of it.

**impla77** (6.2): This is the point in the rate with SZA songs that I’m struggling to say anything about.. why is this album 23 songs??

---

#Farmer Solana??

**jasannn** (8.5): chickens???

**dreamingpastel** (8): The audacity to sing "the difference between me and chickens" and then follow it up with the most gorgeous outro

**wasian-invasion** (7): wait what is the difference between her and chickens? i mean i can think of a few but not sure which one shes referring to

**welcome2thejam** (7): Don't be scared, raise your hand if you paused to search the difference between SZA and chickens

**daythreeinmiami** (6.8): “Call me when you know the difference between me and chickens”

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): you know the difference between me and chickens???? um???

#Emphasis on LOVE Language

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is so great as well!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): okay the contrast in the sultry production and the lyrics works well

**fairytalehigh** (9.2): this song is breathtaking and then that string outro, my god.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): she’s really out here saying it for all of us

**CrimsonROSET** (9): just a really nice honest song idk it’s the essence

**passionfruits2** (9): this is one that everyone loves and there's a reason for it...

**popularsong** (9): stunning. i feel like it loses a bit of steam in the second verse but the outro picks it back up beautifully

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.9): Took a dip in Mother Lake

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): this one grew a little, I’m actually still not set on this score, but it’s worth a closer listen

**runaway3212** (8.5): my love language is getting discord nitro gifted to me

**nick1372** (8): "Love language" is one of those song concepts that's impossible to fuck up

**nooodisaster** (8): Pop girl make a bad song called Love Language challenge

**nt96** (8): It's got Aaliyah in it, so that's always a plus in my book! Vote 90s R&B Princesses next season!

**shipperondeck** (8): so true but also pain

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): yeah me too

**amr** (7.8): love the strings mine is leo btw

**moonshxne** (7.8): the *outros* specifically on this record are just 🤌 (and i think that's the key to the album's enhanced sense of sonic cohesion)

**PhoneThePhoenix** (7.7): a jam, but not among the best on the album

**TiltControls** (7.5): the computer when you open VS Code

**Birdseeding** (7): Love the last bit with the pitch-shifted voice and strings

**IIIHenryIII** (7): lately, snap tracks have been a hit or miss for me, this is a miss. fuck, those strings changed my mind

**Kayaking11116** (7): this one is fun, but you gotta be in a specific mood for this song

**masttup** (7): she didn’t ask but my love language is when I reverse out of scary driveways for the ppl I love

**mimins** (7): very relaxing

**seanderlust** (7): sza my love language is gifts so here's my cashapp

#Sorry, I'm monolingual

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): I wish we were rating the Ariana Grande song from Positions instead

**1998tweety** (6): ari ended her I fear

**frogaranaman** (6): mine is touch

**intheaftermath** (6): just never really caught my attention compared to the stronger tracks here

**Nagisoid** (6): Ari kinda over


**vayyiqra** (6): I'm convinced love languages are not a useful tool but my ex made me take a test on them in 2016 ... I forget my results but she seemed okay with them ... this comment is kind of filler sorry! 😔

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Background music but pretty background music

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Most of the songs on this album that didn’t grab me on my first listen grew on me really quickly. I’m afraid this one stayed boring.

**horridhendy** (5): Gets a bit lost in the shuffle but it's not bad.

**modulum83** (5): love languages aren’t real

**starla\_** (5): not the most interesting track

**Uberpigeon** (5): my love language is French. Bonjour!

**jman457** (4.8): low key just waiting for it to be over its boring

**aakar528** (4): not memorable

**Bordersz** (4): Filler track.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this is so empty

**joeeswift** (3): the strings at the end are beautiful but other than that I didn’t really connect with this song

**Poydoo** (3): Super boring, nothing remotely catchy or even resembling a hook at all, this would be one of the first of several songs I'd cut from this album (God knows it needs it)

**xqra** (3): I only like the Hit Different sample whoops…

**Mudkip1** (0): boring

#Oh my! Sampling's a lie!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): WHY IS HIT DIFFERENT NOT ON THE ALBUM SOLANA???

**RandomHypnotica** (9): how fucking dare you put a sample of hit different here but not THE ACTUAL SONG ON THE ALBUM

**Shelly\_AO29** (8): Her voice! Very chill bop. The strings section in the outro is heavenly. The Hit Different sample just makes me sad it isn't on the album, one of my favourite SZA songs.

**akanewasright** (7.9): she could’ve put hit different on the album but she chose to spare Taylor the humiliation of showing her up again, on a song with the same title

**jonnl2806** (7.8): When the little Hit Different sample comes in... Perfection

**rfbeirut** (7): ariana outsold but the hits different part is fun

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): solid track, love SZA sampling herself with the Hit Different sampe

**vexastrae** (7): this isnt hit different .......

**UselessTacooo** (6): the hit different tease☠️

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): she's fucking EVIL for the hit different sample and keeping it off the tracklist. EVIL!!!!!!!!!

**xqra** (3): I only like the Hit Different sample whoops…

Bordersz: People don't like Midnight Rain 🧍‍♀️ I'm shocked that's out so early along w/Karma. It's been a week and I think I underrated Far and surprised it's out too lmao.
