katycat162534: Anti Hero was done wrong. 

I'm hoping for Virgo's Groove or Heated for the win. But I guess it is probably going to be Alien Superstar (although I feel it was more popular a few months ago). I can also see Kill Bill or Good Days winning though, due to Renaissance having multiple fan favorites. I predict Would've Could've Should've would be brought down by the overall Midnights rating into the #5 to #10 range. Had the rest of the album been rated better, it would have ended in the top 5.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this was my favorite song for the first week of renaissance, but it's shrunk as much as a song can shrink yet still be a 10/10. It's just a song about having a fat ass and that's all songs need to be about to be incredible. The part in the middle where is just hits it‚Äôs climax, MWAH!

**impla77** (8.8): The way Beyonc√© says ‚Äúshe better not lose that ass tho!‚Äù scratches an itch I didn‚Äôt know existed

---

#Thicc

**1998tweety** (10): same

**AHSWeeknd** (10): she really was out here just saying stuff because how do the words ‚Äúcoochie‚Äù ‚ÄúFiji‚Äù and ‚Äúculinary‚Äù fit into the same song

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): for a few minutes i pretend to not have a flat ass and lose my MIND! that BRIDGE!!!!! the outro into the next track!!!!

**daythreeinmiami** (10): me as I eat this chocolate mousse ‚Äòaaaasssss gettin‚Äô THIQUEr‚Äô

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I DON'T DO THIS USUALLY

**FlavaSavaVandal** (10): I‚Äôm not an ass shaker by any means, but my ass seems to drop low in a slutty way when this comes on

**IIIHenryIII** (10): let‚Äôs be honest, popheads would eat any other artist alive had they rhymed a word with the same word not only once, but twice

**MrMoodle** (10): I barely even remembered this one but it‚Äôs kind of amazing

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): need the Megan Thee Stallion remix STAT

**popularsong** (10): anyone ranking this lower than 8 doesnt have that THIQUE

**PSSST12** (10): Special mention to this one because this is the song that made me give this album a second chance after being dissapointed on first listen. The switch up on the second verse, like, mozart was gagged.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): anyone putting this at the bottom of a RENAISSANCE ranking is just jealous

**Stryxen** (10): TINASHE?? TINASHE??? TINASHAYY????

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): we love a slut anthem

**vayyiqra** (10): üò≥

**vexastrae** (10): girl help my ass started shaking uncontrollably!

**fairytalehigh** (9.7): this really speaks to the debauched slut in me

**ReallyCreative** (9.7): you just know she plays this word in Scrabble and Jay Z knows better than to say anything

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): if beyonc√© told me to go harder, i would simply become a 10 on the mohs hardness scale idk bout yall

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): the little horn bit that happens every now and then is so cute. The outro is transcendent. Taylor take notes on how to make pitched down vocals work.

**sufjancaesar** (9.5): try not to levitate during ‚Äúthat‚Äôs that summer that‚Äôs them hummers that‚Äôs that girl give me your number‚Äù challenge!!!

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): just such an insane banger

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.4): cannot state enough how good the transitions are on this album

**shipperondeck** (9.2): somehow makes aaaasssssssss sound cool

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): yass, thicc like those lyrical papers from your overworked songwriters, still great tho

**bogo** (9): yeah it's good

**nick1372** (9): just so great

**passionfruits2** (9): this song feels like it was written by Pitbull in the best way possible

**poemforsmallthings** (9): I love the tinashe feature

**runaway3212** (9): SHE WAS SO IN HER CISHET MALE LOVING CARS BUT IN A POSITIVE WAY ERA

**UselessTacooo** (9): Someone pointed out that she is basically just saying gibberish and I‚Äôve been forever altered

**welcome2thejam** (9): Got my confidence levels peaking

**slimboyfriend** (8.6): so is it pronounced ‚Äúthick‚Äù or ‚Äúthick-uh‚Äù because she says both

**akanewasright** (8.5): THAT‚ÄôS THAT JORDY THAT‚ÄôS THAT SCHOLAR THAT I JUST GOT OUT OF COLLEGE

**Bordersz** (8.5): Melodies go crazy on this one.

**Frajer** (8.5): it's cute that she still calls it her jelly, I don't think I'm ready

**MasterWizardRyan** (8.5): this is what getting a bbl sounds like

**mimins** (8.5): that one tweet that said that the pussy part was the part where she turns into tinashe..yeah

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): this that jinsoul

**seanderlust** (8.5): can't relate, ass looks like a slice of deli turkey stapled to a wall

**jonnl2806** (8.2): If I ever became a stripper this and 6 inch would be my regular routines

**Awkward\_King** (8): I DONT DO THIS USUALLY I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU DO TO ME

**frogaranaman** (8): gay bears used this song as their Tinder anthem almost exclusively for two months

**Nagisoid** (8): Anthony Fantano's thighs:

**nooodisaster** (8): reminder NOT to buy Fiji agua (or any bottled water! #zerowaste)

**rfbeirut** (8): love when she turns into Tinashe

**Roxieloxie** (8): dont kill me but this can be her second song out, after im that girl.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): the long aaaassssssss takes me out but still some of the beats so good

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I love her pronunciation

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): It‚Äôs still good but it‚Äôs held up mostly by the chorus / pitched up part, and it‚Äôs just too inconsistent. The production is also probably the weakest on this song out of all songs here

**Kayaking11116** (7.5): this song makes me feel saur sexy

**shhhneak** (7.5): She‚Äôs dropping names like a government witness.

**starla\_** (7.5): a bit one note but still fun

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass

#Ben Shapiros

**Birdseeding** (7): Trapyonc√© is not that convincing, but I can't help love it, the production is amazing

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): And we‚Äôve reached the worst section of the Renaissance tracklist (it‚Äôs me giving two songs in a row a 7).

**Poydoo** (7): I agree, it sure is that thick

**TiltControls** (7): I can't tell if I love or hate the production, but at least its memorable

**udontwannaknownoel** (6.9): If the whole song was like the 2nd verse and bridge it would be above an 8

**jman457** (6.7): this has nice elements (like the ending) but as a whole wish there was more

**modulum83** (6.7): the transition into all up in your mind is like 10x more hype than the song itself

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): Intro is kinda weak for Bey standards, but thankfully it gets better after the beat switch.

**jsonphile** (6): I don‚Äôt get it

**xqra** (6): Has never really stuck with me but I think I like it more after listening to it a few more times for this rate

**intheaftermath** (5): I'm sorry I am not loving the vocal fry on this one. Beyonce has such gorgeous vocals and I'm not sure why she went with this performance for this track

**QuaxlyDuck** (5): really dislike the first half but the second half is alright

**Shelly\_AO29** (5): The most meh song on this album for me.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): sorry i think this one is really boring djdhkashfk the most interesting thing about it is the segue to all up in your mind

**aakar528** (4): uhmm?

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (4): maybe because it comes right after the masterpiece that is Heated, but i always get the urge to skip this song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Taylor is now **OUT** of this rate permanently. She makes the lowest highest song for an album in a 3 album rate by 4 songs. And this song was very close to being lost on day 2 at several points in the rate. But wow, what a song to go out on. 

 Taylor makes another song that's just pure anger, and who else deserves her anger more than John Mayer? Scooter Braun and Scott whatever if you ask certain people, but most agree John Mayer. Some of Taylor's best songs are her anger at a past lover and this is no difference. This song is full of energy much more than any song on this album and she uses every ounce she has. Fuck John Mayer.

**impla77** (8.6): This is the standout track for many on this album, the final boss of Midnights‚Ä¶ and Taylor breaks the record! I like it but think its perhaps slightly overrated

=====

ImADudeDuh: #Would've, Could've, Should've gone further

**aldwin\_is\_here** (11): I've been groomed twice and yeah, I wish he was fucking dead for doing that to me.

**joeeswift** (11): this is one of her career defining songs. Wow.

**1998tweety** (10): I'm gonna gatekeep: if you dont like this song youre not a Swiftie.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): she wrote this but decided to keep ‚ÄúkArMa iS A ReLaXiNg ThOt‚Äù on the standard version of the album

**akanewasright** (10): I was gonna give this a slightly petty 9.9 because I think she‚Äôs written about this better in the past‚Ä¶ but FUCK this is the best song on this project and it‚Äôs not funny.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Hype deserved.

**bluehxrizon** (10): would've, could've, should've been on the standard version xd

**bogo** (10): taylor get away from jack antonoff right now and work with aaron dessner more jack is only holding you back look at all the awesome stuff you've done with aaron he's so much better than jack

**brendjac** (10): john mayer better hope she used up all her resentment on this before starting on the speak now tv vault

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this is great but it‚Äôs not Dear John great

**jonnl2806** (10): This really should have been track 5 and I still don't get why it's not

**jsonphile** (10): it seems most everyone agrees this is the best song on midnights, and I agree. Excellent production from Dessner, Taylor showcasing some of her best songwriting and vocals, everything you could want in a Taylor Swift song

**Mudkip1** (10): what the album should've been

**Nagisoid** (10): "I regret you all the time" Me to my scores seeing how I contributed to the beysweep and taylosing:

**nick1372** (10): One of the best bridges of her career how is she still doing this?

**passionfruits2** (10): another great one in the middle of the deluxe. could have been the track 5 of the album too, very strong.

**poppinmmolly** (10): I hope John Mayer sleeps with one eye open

**PSSST12** (10): BAM. Casually Dropping one of her best opus amidst Anotnoffs drabby soundscape. When I CATCH HER.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): yeah this one is good, mostly because it's absolutely an evermore track

**ReallyCreative** (10): Would you? Would I! Would you? Would I! Would you? Would I!

**rfbeirut** (10): in her alt rock bag here in an amazing way

**runaway3212** (10): NOW GO CHOP HIS DICK OFF

**seanderlust** (10): get his ass taylor!

**Stryxen** (10): great and I'm feeling kind

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): great song, great lyrics, drag him

**TiltControls** (10): Me on October 21st, 2022 at 1am (GMT-4) - man I'm glad this album doesn't have any Taylor songs for me to obsessively loop! Time to go to bed where nothing will change before I wake up again

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): incredible songwriting, incredible bridge, incredible delivery, incredible song

**udontwannaknownoel** (10): I love songs about wanting to murder John Mayer

**vayyiqra** (10): Unironically this song's genre is "Big Music", I will not be elaborating üòå This song reminds me of Wildest Dreams too which I love so that rocks

**welcome2thejam** (10): This only strengthens my desire to hear Taylor do her version of some pre-Sleep Well Beast The National type shit

**modulum83** (9.7): this is the one time on the album that you feel a song is actually about something and it‚Äôs a fucking breath of fresh air

**FlavaSavaVandal** (9.5): my biggest takeaway from the love this song has on popheads is that popheads just wants taylor to release folklore/evermore endlessly

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): love a good fuck John Mayer song

**starla\_** (9.5): this is almost too good for this album? It doesn't sound anything like the rest of the songs. I wish there was more production like this throughout the album.

**heysoupie** (9.3): I really love the lyrics of this song and really FEEL them/like the emotion in the song‚Ä¶I feel like this is what people who love Taylor hear in ALL of her (serious) songs. Unfortch, I feel like the v muted rock production makes this sound like a Duane Reade song (you know, like, generic, meant to be tuned out while you‚Äôre buying chapstick or whatever.) I also don‚Äôt love *this* version of Taylor singing near the top of her range (?) it still kind of incongruous with the emotions expressed (its like she‚Äôs still holding back a bit? Imo?? But idk maybe that‚Äôs the point. I can relate to ruminating on the same bad memories in a way that kind of let‚Äôs you gloss over the corners so they‚Äôre not as painful to recall.) It‚Äôs a very Aaron Dessner song in its depth of melancholy.

**jman457** (9.2): She really stuck all these great tracks on the 3am and for what

**Awkward\_King** (9): tbh yeah......... yeah....

**horridhendy** (9): One of the best songs - don't get why this wasn't put on the standard edition tbh.

**MToms** (9): Imagine a Persephone inspired music video for this...

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): took her 19 tracks to make the first genuinely great song on the album.

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): The pre-chorus is amazing. Very cathartic final chorus.

**slimboyfriend** (9): maybe I was starved for a decent Taylor song after 18 tracks of mediocrity

**MrMoodle** (8.8): oh my god SOMETHING. comparing this to my renaissance and SOS scores i‚Äôm probably wildly overrating it but after like half an hour of entirely homogenous mellowed out synthy bloops this feels euphoric

**fairytalehigh** (8.6): this would slot nicely on folklore, really love the uplifting reverb-y sound

**jaztinax** (8.5): every day it gets harder to be a fan of john mayer‚Äôs music while simultaneously listening to taylor‚Äôs

**CrimsonROSET** (8): actually this builds pretty fun

**daythreeinmiami** (8): The way my jaw dropped at they lyric ‚Äògive me back my girlhood it was mine first‚Äô when Swizzle hit us with the 3am. It also sounds like Mad Woman which I also love. I just love this. Also screw you John Myer.

**intheaftermath** (8): it's a good song but people only like it so much because most of this album is so mediocre

**lipe18090** (8): Overrated song

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): okay this is great

**shhhneak** (8): The way I‚Äôm dissociating to imagine this is about the folklore characters so I remotely enjoy it.

**shipperondeck** (8): wow this is actually good, probably bc the music is louder than 50 decibels

**amr** (7.7): first time I smiled listening to this album and it wasn't in absolute disbelief at the sounds I was being made to hear

**plastichaxan** (7.5): They got me gal

**emayzee** (7.4): dear john outsold with ease this is so early to mid 2010s teen dystopian film soundtrack

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): ["give me back my girlhood it was mine first" AHHHHHHHHHHHH](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1037525072950341732/1077693857954791624/unknown.png)

**PhoneThePhoenix** (7): I do think it's surprising this isn't on the full album. I don't maybe it doesn't fit the exact same vibe but ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**popularsong** (7): ohhh this is good. right from the opening its just so beautiful

#get over him

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This would have been better as a straight up rock song‚Ä¶ like these drums are TOO SOFT!

**pastapixal** (6.7): the best 3am track wbk

**thedoctordances1940** (6.7): for all the love i've seen for this i have basically nothing to say about this other than saying i have nothing to say about it

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.5): this like... wants to build into something great and then just... doesnt

**Kayaking11116** (6.5): a miniscule slay but a slay nonetheless

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): i feel like people stockholmed themselves into liking this song so that they could say midnights has at least one good song on it bc this really isnt much better than the rest of the album

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): i honestly dont understand why everyone likes this one, are people really that desperate for dirt on john mayer

**DraculaWeekend** (6): This reminds me of "I Know Places" so I guess it's not that bad

**nooodisaster** (6): Didn't hit on first listen, didn't realize this was supposed to be the hidden gem, didn't grow on me when I finally did learn.

**oscarbrierley1** (6): b side wildest dreams. The drums sound like they should be more intense to me.

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): don't get the hype for this one I guess I'm too international

**xqra** (6): I hadn‚Äôt listened to this before and heard it was a highlight but I don‚Äôt see it? It‚Äôs fine, well-written but nothing special sonically I feel

**mimins** (5.5): didn't like the beginning, pretty okay with how the song progressed and actually got interesting

**just\_thonking** (5): She's used this bridge 100 times at this point

**nt96** (5): but it didn't

**Uberpigeon** (5): Wouldn't've Couldn't've, Shouldn't've

**aakar528** (4): okay i guess

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): heard a lot of hype for this one, but I don‚Äôt really connect with it. It sounds generic to me, I also don‚Äôt like the backing vocals

**DevilsOfLoudun** (2): it's so overrated and only has one good line in the entire song. Sounds like a demo. Taylor needs to let John Mayer go already. and btw, 19 year old is NOT a child and Taylor needs to stop pretending it is for sympathy votes.

**frogaranaman** (1): this song is emblematic of everything I‚Äôve not understood about the Taylor hype the past few years

ImADudeDuh: # Midnights (3am edition)

---

**Overall Average**: 6.394 **// Average Controversy:** 2.428

---

ImADudeDuh: Does this album deserve to be the 6th LOWEST ALBUM AVERAGE OF ALL TIME? No. Is it a good album? Uhhh, it's got great songs on it but the gaps in quality in the songs are very wide. It has some classic tracks that deserve to go into her pantheon of greatness (WCS, You're On Your Own Kid, Anti-Hero, and Karma) but also has some of her most boring and bad songs to date (Vigilante Shit, Glitch, etc). I truly did not expect the gap to be as wide as it turned out to be in this rate, but what can you do? This rate was more of a set-up than I realized.

impla77: The now ubiquitous epithet ‚Äòmid‚Äô is extremely convenient and I would say justified to describe Midnights. Which is not to say this album is bad, but to me, its a regression from Taylor‚Äôs pandemic albums, and her worst album since 2017s reputation (though I will admit to being a biased Lover stan). Many of the songs share a sonic similarity to Taylor‚Äôs pre pandemic albums (Midnight Rain, Vigilante Shit giving reputation vibes, Karma fitting on Lover etc.) which could result from Taylor reflecting on past eras during the rerecording process, but I feel we are treading over already covered ground, and this contributes to that. We have covered these topics before, and though this is more reflective, I don‚Äôt think this brings enough new content to justify the massive critical acclaim that it received. Comparing this with folklore and evermore, I would say that I am much more interested in Taylor writing from a perspective that is not directly her own (though forming comparisons like in tlgad is a good compromise in making songs more personal). Slight rant incoming, but it also irritates me that Taylor has referred to this as a concept album. Flimsy concept albums seem justified at the conception of the concept album (looking at you Sgt. Pepper) but its been over 50 years, and concept albums have evolved massively. If this is a concept album (songs about things that have kept me up), I can almost believe hopeless fountain kingdom is too.

#WARNING: Essays ahead (I literally needed to make this four comments)
[/r/popheads/comments/11vsbwr/2022_ultimate_rate_reveal_day_3_it_should_cost_an/jcuwbyd/]

=====

ImADudeDuh: 

**IIIHenryIII** (9.762): I heard a reviewer say that people who don‚Äòt like this album probably only like their idea of her music, and this hit the nail on the head for those swifties who shitted on it. This is Taylor and Jack at their best. It‚Äôs also my favorite album of last year and has grown to be my third favorite album by her.

**vayyiqra** (9.524): Such an overhated album. I'm not going to bother trying to defend it and change anyone's mind. I like it and that's all that matters. üòå

**throwaway-7650** (8.538): don't be misguided by the album average, this is an incredibly disappointing follow-up to folkmore. after reaching a new critical peak and successfully launching the (taylor's version) era, she had a chance to release something truly groundbreaking with TS10 but instead we got... this. overall midnights isn't a bad collection of songs (aside from 1) but it left much to be desired and feels too much like a direct natural progression from lover rather than a culmination of her career up until this point. **7/10**

**1998tweety** (8.238): People love to act like this is Taylor's worst album but I'd slot it around 7th place. It has a lot of her best songs but also a lot of awful cuts.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8.138): seeing this album in this lineup was like seeing a car crash about to happen

**FlavaSavaVandal** (8.000): so yeah I really love this album (the standard edition that is, although I understand why the 3am tracks are included since it seems to be more well liked on popheads), it‚Äôs been really nice listening to it in this winter as I get in my introspective late nights mood and just think about myself, all my shortcomings and how I‚Äôm just repeating the same mistakes over and over again, and I don‚Äôt really have anyone other than myself to blame (yeah I‚Äôm the problem, it‚Äôs me indeed). That at the end of the day I‚Äôm just too much or not enough, that I never feel like I truly fit in with anyone. I guess that‚Äôs where the difference between me and Taylor really is, she can fit in, almost too well. And the emotional tolls it takes on her are explored here on tracks like You‚Äôre On Your Own, Kid, Midnight Rain and Anti-Hero. And I think when you really sit with this album, give it your patience, really dig into what is being said. I think Midnights works really effectively. Especially with how the synths really accentuate the loneliness of it all, every connection craved but deflected away, maybe it‚Äôs because of her reputation or maybe it‚Äôs because she pushes others away before they can get close enough to cause real hurt, but something something the folklore/evermore bandwagonners just want her to make that again (yeah i get the hypocrisy of saying this since i got on the Midnights bandwagon). I think there is something special here, messy sure, but a messiness that is embraced with sincerity rather than deflected with camp. And I can respect that. This really hit my neurodivergent ass in a lot of unexpected ways and it‚Äôs been an introspective vibe listening to this while I look out the bus window most mornings thinking about missed connections, friends I ghosted, and just how desperately I miss those connections in life.

**fairytalehigh** (7.900): on paper, this should be my favorite TS album: the introspective lyricism of the folkmore era + the tasteful synth arrangements of the 1989/lover deep cuts. in reality, it took a while for this album to click. antonoff gets so much hate but he's the saving grace on a lot of these.

**MToms** (7.871): Look, someone has to defend Our Lord and Savior Taylor Swift from the Popheads Pagans.

**modulum83** (7.714): the existence of this album is fascinating to me - it feels like what you'd get if you threw reputation and lover and melodrama and the 1975 and grimes and a hundred more pop albums all churned through a maximum-strength nostalgia machine until the result is spotify-ready vapor. it's nocturnal, glamorous, full of buildups with no drops, ethereal almost as to discredit its own existence. i know exactly what she's going for, and yet it exists in an era where it's what literally nobody wanted from her. it is blatant late 2010s nostalgia during the period in which late 2010s nostalgia is deeply uncool. so while the production can be gorgeous, and the melancholy vibes a mood, it just feels...empty. the 3am tracks are a vast improvement though - they feel like a lost album of actually deeply personal and uncomfortable subjects that i really would like to see more of.

**Frajer** (7.643): As much as I love Taylor it does feel like maybe her music is getting too intimate like I shouldn't be listening to this sometimes, also not a Jack hater but he is making a lot of choices I just have questions about

**avg-vag** (7.548): 7.547619048 too many creative decisions made purely on gimmick and sales that distracted from the great moments. if the tracklist had been edited to a stronger set of 13 songs on the standard version it could sit among taylor‚Äôs top albums.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7.524): easily the worse album off this rate, but I like songs here more than the others

**jaztinax** (7.495): as someone who fell out of love with taylor after lover and has realized in hindsight that 1989 wasn‚Äôt as good as she remembered it being, this album feels just alright to me. i‚Äôm just here for the reputation-esque tunes

**AHSWeeknd** (7.190): Jack Antonoff brought back Fun.‚Äòs sound but in 2020 aesthetic.

**wasian-invasion** (7.024): Not to overuse the joke too much but i think this sits solidly in the MIDdle of her discography. Pretty consistent standard edition and some fun highlights but it doesnt have the same emotional weight as some others. Also even though she actually put out a few music videos unlike *some* people in this rate, the only visuals i can picture when listening to this album is this: https://www.tiktok.com/@maaadddzzzzz/video/7156978622329408810?lang=en

**jman457** (7.010): The 3am scores probably save this a bit‚Ä¶ Like the MIDdle part of MID nights really be‚Ä¶ MID

**jsonphile** (6.881): yeah this is one of Taylor‚Äôs weaker albums. It has some highlights, but overall most of the songs just seem meh. Not great, not bad, just kinda there. And some questionable lyrics as well. I also don‚Äôt know why the 3am tracks are, on average, significantly better than the main tracks. Is Dessner just a much better producer than Antonoff? I know Jack Antonoff can produce good music, but it just doesn‚Äôt show here

**TiltControls** (6.857): My question is why the 3am tracks were the bonus and not the main. My average might've been hovering in the 5's if not for them.

**jasannn** (6.733): I love nocturnal sounding songs. I even created an ongoing playlist called Midnight long before she announced this album. To my disappointment, almost none of the songs here (sans Maroon and Midnight Rain) can fit onto that playlist. She really set herself for high expectations when she said the album would be 13 sleepless nights as I don‚Äôt see that reflected pretty much at all, lyric or atmospheric wise. While I didn‚Äôt like evermore that much, I could see objectively it was a good album. These lyrics and melodies are just okay and leave me wanting more. I‚Äôll still see y‚Äôall at the Eras tour though. XOXO

**horridhendy** (6.714): I do really like this album but it's a bit of a mixed bag - some high highs, some low lows. I do think that I immediately liked this album a lot more than I do now as I got bored with it fairly quickly, whereas I'm still playing Renaissance on repeat months later. I think the album really suffers with some bad/mediocre songs in the middle but starts and finishes strongly. Overall, it's a good album but I have my problems with it.

**dreamingpastel** (6.667): It's complicated.

**MasterWizardRyan** (6.590): i know my averages look bad when my sos and renaissance average is compared with this but it's all taylor's fault for creating the most overhyped and underwhelming album last year

**starla\_** (6.571): MIDnights but for real, this album is really up and down in quality. The songs are mostly well-written but the production is really boring for the most part.

**nooodisaster** (6.452): not the wouldve coudlve shouldve payola... (jk i know its bc she needed the extra tracks to balance out) ALSO I will be forgetting my hatred of swifties for the next 1 hr 9 mins :D

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6.452): I wanted to like this album so badly, but it‚Äôs honestly pretty mediocre. It feels like a mix of Lover & Reputation but without any of the elements that make either album good or interesting.

**PhoneThePhoenix** (6.314): wish i liked this album more but i just don't really care about most it!!

**welcome2thejam** (6.190): Terrible middle stretch really sinks this, tbh it's mostly solid otherwise

=====

ImADudeDuh: **DirtyRat583** (6.190): TAYLOR IN HER FLOP ERA?? Washed up popstar-turned-private-jet-tourist tries and fails miserably to replicate her sound of long ago?!?! (im acting like the tabloids to scare her into making a good album again) Is her career doomed?

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.167): man im realizing my biggest issue with taylor now is her lyricism has taken a nosedive. she can still shine when she drops the girlboss facade but boy does she love to keep it up these days

**hikk** (6.167): i don't even care for this album much at all, to me it's probably her worst since fearless & it's my lowest average of the three here, but ppl truly have been doing the absolute most to this... it's like they're trying their hardest to stick it to crazy swifties that, realistically, don't really exist in the rating community... really just comes off as corny & unnecessary imo

**RandomHypnotica** (6.057): Swifties have always had a tendency to go "omg this song sounds just like it's from X album" with every taylor release, but the fact that the comparisons were both so immediate and universal for every song on this album speaks volumes. Combine this with the fact that the tour for this album is the "eras" tour, I am asbolutely conviced this is a collection of vault tracks that Taylor threw together with a vague loose theme, and that would explain the wild incosistincy in sound, theme and quality. Also the 3AM tracks are literally just woodvale.

**Nagisoid** (5.952): Oh Taylor, Taylor Taylor... what do I say. My score would be so much worse without the 3AM version, this album is literally mostly filler in its standard release. Jack Antonoff's alt-pop production is too oversaturated by now - and that is not even the biggest issue - the problem is this easily sounds worse than other alt-pop albums he has produced, like Melodrama, which this album reads like a shitty bootleg of ignoring the soft breakup concept album elements. Most of the songs sound dated already or unfinished with a few exceptions like Lavender Haze, and that's mostly because it tries to be something else than Antonoffcore. The 3AM ver. improves on these faults a lot; there's a lot more sonic variation in The Great War, WCS, and High Infidelity, for example. These actually sound like Taylor songs and not scraps he could have recorded for any of his other girlies, which helps. There's only one really perfect song on here, being WCS, which is essentially just a sequel to Dear John and works so well because of it. Nonetheless, this really feels like a regression for Tay after what she was going for in the cottagecore albums. Her songwriting has worsened a lot, just look at Vigilante Shit and Maroon, and her bridges are the weakest they've been in a long time, which is honestly surprising. My least favorite album in this rate by far, sorry for contributing to your downfall in this rate, but maybe you could've (and should've) released a better collection of songs.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.905): She literally pulled a Katy. As in, she built up this album to be something interesting and meaningful, and then we all got to listen to it and, guess what! She fucking lied! It's just plain ass pop songs! There's nothing fundamentally bad about plain pop songs, but I think my initial aversion to this album stemmed from that sense of disappointment. That and, if you think about it, this was the first Taylor Swift album to not really have, like, a *point*? She's not trying to prove her songwriting chops, she's not trying out the "popstar" look for the first time, she's not responding to controversy, she's not dedicating an album to her true love, she's not stripping back her music and making something more personal‚Ä¶ This is the first work by Taylor Swift that feels‚Ä¶ unnecessary. It shows.

**akanewasright** (5.900): I was PISSED the night this dropped. I‚Äôve been a Taylor fan since I was like 12, and while my fandom has been‚Ä¶ tempered a bit over the years, I‚Äôve still liked pretty much album she put out. I did not enjoy this one at *all* - it felt out of touch and completely lacking in the lyrical quality I expected from her. Everything felt overwritten and undercooked. While I‚Äôve softened on parts of it since, I was still very disappointed by this album and would not call myself a fan of it

**slimboyfriend** (5.857): Reputation if it was even worse

**nick1372** (5.857): I should know by now not to get my hopes up for a Taylor Swift album. Still I was disappointed. There's a decent amount to like here, but there's also some truly awful songs that Taylor should know better than to release to the public. I don't understand the criticism that this album is boring, though. Much of it is uncompelling, yes, and lyrically basic. But most of what's on the main album is either amazing or terrible.

**Mudkip1** (5.810): I can't believe I wasted my money on the vinyl just cause the jade green version matched the aesthetic of my basement

**bogo** (5.667): alright time for some real comments i guess. so first let me talk about evermore. amazing album, might honestly be my favorite album of all time at this point with how much i've listened to it. naturally because of this i think any album taylor released after this would've been a slight disappointment due to how high my expectations were, but i still could've learned to love it for what it was if it was still a great album. this is not a great album. taylor seems to take several steps back as a writer on this album and for some reason she is adamant on bringing jack antonoff along for the ride, who is dead set on showing everyone how incompetent of a producer he is with some of the thinnest production i've heard. i've warmed up to some of the better songs on the record but i will still never forget listening to this the very moment it came out and being completely crushed at how half-baked and amateurish it all sounded. it honestly soured me on taylor a lot tbh

**shhhneak** (5.633): I think this is Taylor‚Äôs worst pop album and it‚Äôs not even close. At least Reputation and Lover had songs I would die on a hill for. I‚Äôm just so ambivalent on this record. And the fact that it‚Äôs her best selling? It‚Äôs over for us folklorians.

**bulforster** (5.576): this definitely has the lowest highs of any taylor album I've heard so the lazy joke on the title a bunch of people have probably made for me is basically just accurate.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.500): It's not the worst album released by a popheads favourite in the last few years! It's just one of many, many albums by popheads faves last year that was just kinda there (see: sub favs rate and my scores if I even end up doing it). It's not really bad, although it definitely has its bad moments but basically every Taylor album except folklore has those, it just doesn't have the same highs most of her other albums do and even the good bits are generally pulled down by some bad bits and it just ends up being not a very good album. I don't think it helped that it came out at a time where I had just reached a level of having heard too much Taylor and gone through a general cultural overexposure to her (which is largely my own fault for listening to her so much over the past few years) but it's just a very unremarkable album for the most part, even the laughably bad bits just end up being kinda forgettable.

**lexiaredery** (5.476): Thought it was kinda boring when it came out and was always confused why it got so big. Now that I've listened to this album many more times than I ever thought I would, my opinion really hasn't changed. It's not outright bad, a few songs are good, but not much I'm going to come back to.

ImADudeDuh: **moonshxne** (5.471): Mostly as ~~lifeless~~ sleepy, melody- and production-wise, as I remember. My opinions are the same: Aaron Dessner ate, Jack Antonoff needs to be stopped, etc., etc....oh, and yeah, sorry Taylor, but I'm kind of a vocal snob so she's just not gonna do it for me. üòï Beyond technical ability or whatever, I actually also find her vocal tone quite dry and plain and vanilla. (Like, in the hands of a more capable vocalist, I think WCS might have a chance for a 10.)

**Around-Town** (5.429): There's nothing wrong with this album, but it's not a cohesive work like the other two, so I has to stand on the merit of each individual song, which varies.

**oscarbrierley1** (5.381): it all blends together to me. A lot of the songs are too similar. It's in desperate need of an upbeat bop.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (5.143): Ugh this is so agressively mediocre I can't. I was into it when it first came out, but it wore itself out very quickly for me.

**Birdseeding** (4.905): 4 This is the opposite of Renaissance, an album that I had some hope for but which just comes across as half-baked, unfinished and messy. Taylor Swift, for all her professionalism, writes lyrics that desperately need an editor's thick red pencil, with songs that don't scan, forced rhymes and cringy imagery. But that's not the only thing that needed several more rounds of work in this sketch-like album with no clear direction or purpose.

**just\_thonking** (4.762): Pretty sure this is my lowest album average ever. I'm usually a Taylor fan but this feels so phoned in and corny and bland and lazy. It sounds even worse after listening to Renaissance because while Renaissance as a complete project sounds even better than the sum of its parts (because of the high energy and variety and transitions), Midnights in contrast works so poorly as a complete project. After the first few songs everything sounds the same and blends together, and the worst part is, if you take the time to pay close attention to the songs, you are not rewarded at all --- in fact you're punished by horribly cheesy lyrics and recycled melodies. She's just sing-talking over the same three synths and usually she has nothing interesting to say. Blegh.

**beyzxzhen** (4.524): honestly i thought this album was kind of mid to begin with, but that's really magnified against these two stunning bodies of work imo

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.476): the best thing about this rate is that i cant be accused of sabotaging taylor because this wont even be in the bottom 25% of averages for this album

**MassiveThief** (4.429): very much a disappointment. I listened to this when it came out, am listening to it now for this rate, and probably won't ever again

**apatel27** (4.310): First thought was that this was mediocre but listening again her delivery is so bad. It's so awkward in so many places and the constant switching between 'girlboss' & 'perpetual victim' really works against the album, even if it makes sense.

**nt96** (4.214): Taylor makes music for girls who say they experienced trauma; that trauma being that one time they cried because their Dad yelled at them.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4.000): Over the years, Taylor has been not for me. I like a handful of songs from her over the years. Here, her songwriting and vocal tendencies, mixed with Antonoff‚Äôs production tendencies, foment into something I either find drab or actively irritating. Jumbled lyrics, vocal scoops and seesaw vocal phrasing, and Jack‚Äôs muffled and muddled production led to   this album being a slog for me. Some bright spots most notably the bookends and some 3am cuts. An album I prefer/would recommend that I know Taylor cites as an influence is Azure Ray‚Äôs self-titled album: https://open.spotify.com/album/473NAu1vpY4l1ANnx7lmJZ?si=QJq78ug6RbOEVewG3gyLZA

**mimins** (3.810): I wanted to give up on this album BADLY. It tried way too hard to keep every song in a certain vibe to the point that it was monotonous and boring as shit. I can listen to most of these songs over and over again and i wouldn't be able to tell you which one is which.

**vexastrae** (3.690): um....... listen. taylor swift is the definition of hit or miss; she can make both pretty great hits and low-grade stinkers, and that extends to her albums too as reputation and lover are all over the place in terms of quality. when the folklore and evermore albums came out, i was pleasantly surprised to see her being consistently good! as such, i was rooting for her following the releases of folkmore and the TV albums (we love to see an artist taking ownership of her work), so you can imagine the disappointment i had when i heard midnights for the first time. to me, this feels like a regression of her sound and songwriting, as the instrumentals can be uninspired and her lyrics can deeply lack self-awareness. her execution of the themes here is unpolished in a way that is less raw and unfiltered, and more unedited and sloppy. all i can say is lets hope next album she becomes more adventurous, by being more experimental with the sounds she uses and more diverse with the topics she chooses to tackle.

**dream\_fighter2018** (3.690): oh this album, where do I even start? This era has rubbed me the wrong way ever since the whole Midnight clock thing, I‚Äôve been faced with the sense that this whole era feels completely inauthentic. Sure, it‚Äôs a retreading of Reputation but at least Reputation tried something, and as haphazard as Reputation was at least she tried to branch out. Midnights is both boring and cringy, with the production feeling far too clean and lacking in any sort of character, while the lyrics, for lack of a better word, sound immature. There‚Äôs an energy contained within these lyrics that, to put on my critical analysis goggles, seem to be themed around Taylor Swift as the maligned and enigmatic artist. I will acknowledge two truths: Taylor Swift is super talented, and that sometimes people are unjustifiably rude about Taylor Swift. However, these lyrics never quite prove their intent of positioning Taylor Swift as an artistic tour-de-force, and the fact that she still has all this good will does feel incredibly privileged in itself. But, on the ‚Äúmaligned‚Äù part, no matter what Taylor Swift does she will attract criticism, some more justified than the rest. But, Midnights songwriting is too immature and shallow to effectively achieve what she has set out to portray. Taylor has written better at 16 than she does with this album. Some say that you become stuck at the age you became famous, if Folklore and Evermore didn‚Äôt exist and prove that Taylor Swift can write a mature and witty album then I might be inclined to agree with them. But, Midnights bobs at the surface, with one liners that elicit a groan and attempts to sell Taylor Swift as an anti-hero that make her sound more like a villain incapable of self-reflection and who doesn‚Äôt take responsibility for her own actions. One might say that‚Äôs a lot to infer, but if we were to analyse Midnights Taylor Swift as a character then we‚Äôd probably say she‚Äôs incredibly one dimensional and an unreliable narrator. It‚Äôs personally very off putting, and the cynical part of me just thinks that this is an attempt to fortify the fan base and sell them clocks made out of vinyl sleeves with an album that is all about selling Taylor first, and making music second. Also, now I think I get the Jack Antonoff hate. The production on the standard edition is almost universally bland, and the 3am tracks show glimmers of what could‚Äôve been. If every track was as good as the 3am tracks, this could have been a 6+ average album easily. Unfortunately, Jack had to Antonoff all over this album and the result, along with the aforementioned lyrics, is this simultaneously boring and annoying mess of an album.

**plastichaxan** (3.619): Her music is just not for me, I truly do not see what people see in her songwriting and I think here the things I find decent in other albums of hers were lacking a bit here, still the two songs I gave 7+ I enjoyed so that‚Äôs something. Also, I guess this being paired with one of my favorite albums ever did not help its case for me, I made the effort, it‚Äôs just not my thing.

**shipperondeck** (3.571): what a vacuum of charisma and emotion

**frogaranaman** (3.190): The first time I listened to Midnights I had my Airpods Pros in and I thought they were broken because it was clipping so much. I legit went to the Apple store and got them checked because of it. They were completely fine, the album is just fucking poorly mixed.

**amr** (3.024): already explained myself in the comments but I lost steam after a bit so to put it succinctly I already knew what this album would sound like just reading the lyrics and seeing stills from the music videos but I was still hoping I'd be wrong cos it's completely antithetical to everything I like about music and...I have to listen to it! I mentioned to someone how the song titles sting the most cos U can tell she put a lot of thought into each of them yet the actual music never quite matches up? it's like those tumblr posts that are like "imagine a novel about a bisexual bullfighter" and they think that's enough to make a good story like no character arcs no worldbuilding just a quirky quip thrown at a wall hoping it'll stick and I try to avoid that sort of art in every medium I'm interested in but I didn't have a choice w this rate lmao. when shows can't afford to license out good pop music they choose ai generated sounding nonsense instead and it's a bit crazy to realize that's what almost every single song on this sounds like, but it's coming from arguably the biggest musician of our times. there's so little to like about this album but I tried to find the tiniest silver linings so I wasn't throwing out straight 1s, even if it was just a tiny instrumental quirk

**impla77** (8.1): Is this how I realise I don‚Äôt know what hyperpop means? This is a bit of a different vibe from the rest of the album, I think its a nice shakeup and we love the SZA shoutout (jk)

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): I can't remember this song for the life of me. Apparently it is technically a hyperpop so that may explain why I try to block it out.

---

#This song is stuck in my head!

**rfbeirut** (11): people hate this song too much its beyonce doing hyperpop with AG Cook. she made it for me, not you!

**starla\_** (11): I just had to follow my heart and give my 11 to this masterpiece. The creeping ominous vibe of both the production and the vocal gives me goosebumps. It's like nothing else on the album.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): yes i like hyperpop, how could you tell?

**1998tweety** (10): lowkey the most underrated song on the album

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the most underrated song on the album. She analyzed the evolution of house music and gave it a spot on the album whilst also making a callback to MJ.

**akanewasright** (10): I put this on speaker and heard the guy next door start screaming slurs, which‚Ä¶ Honestly that‚Äôs a sign

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): she did hyper-pop lite and I got to admit, she need to do more songs like this, it fits.

**bogo** (10): yeah it's good

**bulforster** (10): The AG prod credit is the Caroline Polachek No Angel cowrite of this album except I really like this one

**CrimsonROSET** (10): :kirbyshouting:

**DirtyRat583** (10): she watered down hyperpop a million percent and it was STILL good how does she do it

**horridhendy** (10): At one point, this was my 11.

**Hulnia** (10): a.g. cook you will always be famous

**IIIHenryIII** (10): hyperpop album when?

**lipe18090** (10): My second favorite on the album, it's a masterpiece and I'd give it an 11 if I could

**Nagisoid** (10): It's all in my head, yeah

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Again, I got this one the first time some of y‚Äôall can‚Äôt say that

**passionfruits2** (10): idk why, but i hated this song on release day... maybe i was covid positive bc that clearly was a huge lack of taste.

**ReallyCreative** (10): microplastics teas

**Roxieloxie** (10): I dont know what happened that lead to this song shooting its way up to being my favorite on the album, I cant explain it

**runaway3212** (10): THIS IS SO INSANE LIKE SHES THOSE LITTLE MUSHROOMS FROM THE LAST OF US AND I DONT EVEN BLAME HER

**Treecoh** (10): i think this is gonna be the first RENAISSANCE song to get elemonaded and i see why, but it's good! be careful what you wish for cause i just might comply!

**UselessTacooo** (10): me at the ate store

**shipperondeck** (9.6): this song is like putting a knife to ur partner's throat (please do not actually do this) and going youre OBSESSED! youre OBSESSED! youre FUCKING OBSESSED!!!! and it is so cool

**aakar528** (9.5): smooth flow (very underrated)

**Kayaking11116** (9.5): ok but can we focus on the transition between Thique and this??? like oh my god. and this song is amazing btw

**pastapixal** (9.5): A.G. Cook really snapped with this one

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.5): this one took me a minute to really appreciate but it's hypnotic in such a great way

**Bordersz** (9): Love the sound on this.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): her hyperpop serve. the girls who get it get it

**nooodisaster** (9): There are DOZENS of us stans!

**vexastrae** (9): ag cook i hope god gives you the best strain of weed in the whole wide world

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): just like 100 gecs, "friday," skrillex, SOPHIE, heidi montag, charli xcx, "running up that hill," reputation, CRJ, sweetener, all pop music from 1980 to now, and crazy frog, this TOO is hyperpop!!!

**moonshxne** (8.9): Beyonc√©'s brash energy is very much its own, distinctive thing that makes this all the more fascinating to hear.

**slimboyfriend** (8.8): wow she really has a song for everyone‚Ä¶ Alien Superstar for the gays, Cozy for the trans girls, and now a little hyperpop ditty for the green mullet enbys

**daythreeinmiami** (8.5): ngl those visuals are all up in my mind

**Frajer** (8.5): every pop girl will go hyperpop accept your fate

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): ended Charli xcx

**just\_thonking** (8.5): I'm sorry but she will never not sound to me like the MUNA lady here

**Poydoo** (8.5): Industrial queen?

**TiltControls** (8.5): rates

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): Bey XCX cmon now

**jonnl2806** (8.4): I mean Beyonce doing hyper pop what more could I ask for tbh

**jman457** (8.2): This goes hard

**katycat162534** (8): The buildup in the last chorus!

**MassiveThief** (8): ag cook slayed, as expected, I just REALLY wish this song went somewhere. It's just a cool idea over and over... but not expanded on. Like it's still really good, but could have been AMAZING

**mimins** (8): i think its catchy and gets stuck in my head all the time so

**popularsong** (8): i thought it was too monotone on first listen but it really grew on me

**shhhneak** (8): This is TikTok length and eligible for interludephobia but manages to be an actual song with substance and identity. See when you do excellence?

**udontwannaknownoel** (8): REAL hyper pop, outsold Unholy

**vayyiqra** (8): Never thought much about this one but the glitchy and distorted production with the filtered vocals as well is cool üò≥

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Why is she singing like a pop punk boy

**emayzee** (7.5): this is unholy if it slayed harder

#Brainworms

**modulum83** (7.5): this is an idea. a really good idea, but it‚Äôs barely a song

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): almost amazing, but doesn't really go anywhere.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): who would've imagined the AG Cook song would be the most forgettable on the record

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I like this one but tbh I don‚Äôt ever really seek it out. I know for some people it‚Äôs THE Renaissance song tho and I love that for them.

**heysoupie** (7): like, fine, but it doesn‚Äôt feel essential to this album.

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): I like the dancier songs on the album more. The production is really good, though.

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): i wish i liked hyperpop beyonce more than i actually do here but i respect it still!!

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): idk for a beyonce + ag cook song its kinda disappointing

**frogaranaman** (6): my mental illness be like

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): great beat but there's better songs

**xqra** (4.7): Not a bad song at all just isn't for me, also I think I judge it more harshly since it's my only skip from an otherwise amazing album

**cremeebrulee** (2.3): i'm not really sure what others hear in this, it just kinda exists

#Good news!

**MrMoodle** (10): i‚Äôm going to cry when this gets beaten out by 9 tracks on midnights

**impla77** (10): God, Ts Madison is such an icon

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): This song is very fun. Even for being a non-10 for me on this album, it has so many memorable lines. "Might I suggest you don't fuck with my sis," "bitch, I'm black," and the whole pride verse. It's a real nice addition that Beyonce added a verse dedicated to saying the colors of the pride flag, I hope she doesn't perform in a place that has a history of problematic feelings and laws on homosexuality. But my 1.5 off of 10 isn't from pettiness, I just feel like the song needs a beat switchup or some kind of change at some point earlier in the song.

**1998tweety** (10): we stan her listing out the colours of the pride flag

**AHSWeeknd** (10): paint the world pcp üíÖ

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): One of my favourites. The beat, the lyrics (the rainbow flag shoutout!), just an amazing song.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): songs in this album have a tendency to lose me during their runtime idk why, they‚Äôll start out 10s but by it ends I‚Äôm not feeling it anymore

**moonshxne** (6.8): Wish this had a less atonal melody so that it would feel, uh, *cozier* for me. I actually quite like the production flourishes, but, meh...

**heysoupie** (6.6): Weirdly forgettable? The message is cool and it sounds fun. But most of the other tracks I‚Äôve gotten stuck in my head or have wanted to listen to alone, unlike this one.

**mimins** (5): not the biggest fan of the beat/instrumental

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is the best song that Phoebe Bridgers has ever been involved in making. Whoever figured out that Phoebe and SZA could make a song together and it actually work needs their ass ATE! Both give a haunting performance as SZA asks for someone to help take her mind off of greater problems in the music industry or with touring or on reliance og social media, all of which can make someone feel like a hollow figure in a grand machine that doesn't really care about them.

**impla77** (8.7): The Phoebe Bridgers feature is a bit leftfield but its cute. Idk, I really wished this worked for me more (I still gave it a high score mind you!) but I just cannot relate to celebrities problems, which is kinda the point of the song ..?

ImADudeDuh: #Spooky Scary Ghosts

**Awkward\_King** (11): instead of picking between any of the incredible renaissance tracks, sza and phoebe gave me a get out of jail free card. the sad girl in me unfortunately won out over the bad girl

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not wrong, you‚Äôre an asshole‚Äù - me seeing thirteen people 0 So Am I in All Stars 6.

**jasannn** (11): The perfect collab. It perfectly melds both of their sounds, styles and lyrics.

**jsonphile** (11): what a strange but fantastic collaboration. Would not have expected this to work but it just does.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): omg another movie title, what‚Äôs her letterboxed?

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): I could've given this eleven not just because the PB feature is soooo soothing at what I really feel right now over somebody and everything, but Taylor Swift is my favorite popstar.

**bluehxrizon** (10): this is phoebe's best song. Why?

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): phoebe you will always be famous

**cremeebrulee** (10): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1037525072950341732/1080936324619587664/Screen_Shot_2023-03-02_at_11.34.56_AM.png

**CrimsonROSET** (10): sad girls make some noise!

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): the second best song with Phoebe Bridgers doing vocals ever

**Frajer** (10): when she said I need humanity y'all lack humanity I felt that

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this is when the stretch of perfect songs starts for me

**masttup** (10): Phoebe is 21 savage for people who stink

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): strange collab but it works‚Ä¶we need the indie folk album from sza

**Mudkip1** (10): by far the best song on this album

**Nagisoid** (10): The way I predicted this song would mention a hotel lobby after SZA asks for a password in the listening party

**nick1372** (10): such a good pair of collaborators it's so natural

**pastapixal** (10): phoebe was so unexpected but this collab is so so good

**PhoneThePhoenix** (10): lyrically gutting!! great performances from both.

**popularsong** (10): probably the most poignant song to me, really encapsulates that feeling of being alienated in the modern world. i need humanity... also just an ideal collab tbh, not a collab for the sake of collabing, but smth that actually adds to the song

**Poydoo** (10): Those drums and the twinkly pianos during the humanity part are fantastic ‚ù§‚ù§

**RandomHypnotica** (10): sza before release: I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to sound how people think it‚Äôs going to sound 

 *proceeds to sound exactly as soul crushing as we think it would sound*

**ReallyCreative** (10): An unexpected but perfect collaboration, no notes!

**runaway3212** (10): slay

**seanderlust** (10): really love phoebe's feature here. i didn't initially think their voices would work well together but i stand corrected!

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): One of my favourites. It stood out to me immediately on my first listen to the album. What she's tackling in the lyrics is super interesting, being a famous musician seems lonely. Phoebe is such a standout. Love the production as well.

**shhhneak** (10): I'm in my boygenius AOTY phase of course this is getting a ten.

**shipperondeck** (10): genetically operated to make the sad girls cry (im sad girls)

**Stryxen** (10): gagging....... in the Machine

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): phoebe's friends on her payroll real worried right now

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): really solid introspective track that compliments both SZA's and Phoebe's styles perfectly

**Uberpigeon** (10): pheobe briger

**UselessTacooo** (10): this and the next 2 tracks are the holy trinity of this album hot take

**vexastrae** (10): SZA and phoebe bridgers are the ryle and descartes of our time

**welcome2thejam** (10): She knew Taylor was bringing Lana to ult and loaded her own pophead alt girl fave bullet in the chamber

**moonshxne** (9.6): ~~Would Bing Chat find solace in this?~~

**akanewasright** (9.5): we love a collab that‚Äôs exactly the right intersection between the two artists' sounds

**jonnl2806** (9.5): I would have never in a million years thought Phoebe Bridgers and SZA would work but oh god it is probably the best feature on the album?

**sebgup** (9.5): This is it girls, this is how you make a songggg

**1998tweety** (9): Miss Bridgers kinda ate

**dreamingpastel** (9): Even when I anticipate Phoebe's verse, it's still a jumpscare.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): they are so good together, sad girls hours here

**jaztinax** (9): CAN YOU TOUCH ON ME AND NOT CALL ME AFTER

**just\_thonking** (9): The AI line still kills me every time

**katycat162534** (9): Phoebe elevates the song for me

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): the white girl kinda ruined the song a little sorry no disrespect

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Excellent collaboration, SZA and Phoebe go so well together. Love the dark moody vibes here. Probably one of my fave cuts here.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): absolute banger, who would've thought sza and phoebe bridges would create such a great crossover

**TiltControls** (9): Not the first feature I would've guessed, but they really made the track work

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): that chorus is fucking bulletproof, then phoebe? cherry on top

**jman457** (8.7): equally works as a phoebe bridgers and Sza track

**xqra** (8.7): Phoebe's feature DEVOURS like putting these two was so genius!! Only complaint is I'm not a huge fan of the post-chorus but the song bangs otherwise

**intheaftermath** (8.5): Phoebe really elevates this one

**mimins** (8.5): i love the vocals and instrumental plus the bridge is super satisfying

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Phoebe passing on the guitar girl mantle to SZA

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.4): She spilled, everything is disgusting!

**modulum83** (8.3): there needs to be more indie folk/r&b collabs. i need to see sufjan stevens link up with tinashe. actually yeah that could possibly create the gay singularity

**Birdseeding** (8): Now we're talking, this is so melodically fascinating

**Kayaking11116** (8): they ate up

**nooodisaster** (8): What is up with all these book/film titles... SZA's cinefile era.

**passionfruits2** (8): OKAAAYYYYY

**poemforsmallthings** (8): this would be better without Phoebe I'm sorry. I like I know the end

**rfbeirut** (8): surprised by how much i like the human mashed potatoes that is feebee bridgers here

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): NO PHOEBE STAY AWAY FROM HER ^wait ^this ^is ^kinda ^good

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.8): i don‚Äôt like indie music sorry :/

**thedoctordances1940** (7.7): i don't know how but before getting to this I kinda forgot phoebe was on the album somehow

**plastichaxan** (7.5): Phoebe Bridgers I am blaming you for the drop of this score

**starla\_** (7.5): the Phoebe feature works really well

#Cindy, this is bones

**frogaranaman** (7): I always forget that Phoebe is on this song because she sounds like one of those classical instruments on this song until the very end of her verse

**Treecoh** (7): this song is actually so good and it loses all momentum once it gets to phoebes verse lmao. you got me this time sza, tricking me into listening phoebe bridgers. but you cant trick me into liking her!

**emayzee** (6.8): and silk chiffon still remains the only phoebe bridgers song i've ever heard and liked

**MassiveThief** (6.5): honestly disappointing. phoebe make another solo album pls

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): I know you guys love pheobe, but this song is just ok to me.

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): this coming out at the same time as chatgpt yes we are talking about ai

**aakar528** (6): calm

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): "so fucking boring" well

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): inner universe was robbed of anime rate so true sza

**vayyiqra** (6): I don't vibe with Phoebe so was worried this didn't seem like my thing ... it's alright I guess, but the bass sounds muddy to me (might be my headphones) so that's not great üòî

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): literally why is phoebe here. does she even know shes on a sza song i feel like she got plucked off the street and just sang this without knowing what she was involved in

**impla77** (8.7): This is good! It made top 10! But I‚Äôm kinda glad its not any higher because it feels more like an introduction to the album than the whole hog

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): So here it is. The first #1 Beyonce solo single since Single Ladies. And... it's alright. 

 There is SO MUCH to like with this song: the energy, the fun, big freedia. And yet, it just doesn't speak to me as much as it did when it first came out (which was still like an 8.5). Call it overplay, call it disappointment, call it ‚Äúthe rest of the album was a lot better‚Äù but this shrunk on me overtime. I still recognize that this is good, but when this gets #8 on future "Best Songs of the 2020s" lists, I'm gonna be a little :/ seeing this song there.

ImADudeDuh: #Unbreakable souls

**emayzee** (11): this is now the gold standard for lead singles after a long studio album hiatus. for someone who has been music as long as i've been alive she somehow still manages to keep topping herself and making classics. that robin s sample is pure euphoric dance heaven

**horridhendy** (11): I know it's an obvious choice but I can't help it, it‚Äôs such a serve - my fave on the rate.

**martian\_pet** (11): I'm all about that house beat

**AHSWeeknd** (10): this song HITS THE SOUL

**akanewasright** (10): never been more validated in my life than when people heard this in the album and decided they suddenly liked it

**babadork** (10): It still feels wrong to not be giving my 11 to the big diva moment on the album.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I almost feel like this is gonna have reverse-single bias for some people, where they don‚Äôt like it as much because they heard it before/outside the context of the album first. But like‚Ä¶it‚Äôs soooooo good. It‚Äôs got like 40 hooks.

**bluehxrizon** (10): [the 9-5 in question](https://fortune.com/2023/01/24/photos-beyonce-concert-atlantis-royal-dubai-hotel/)

**bogo** (10): yeah it's good

**bulforster** (10): Big Freedia deserved a feature credit, her part elevates the song and especially the transition from ENERGY so much.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): bop!

**daythreeinmiami** (10): I AM ON THE DANCEFLOOR BEFORE BIG FREEDA CAN FINISH HER INTRO THIS SONG IS MY GOD DAMN ANTHEM. (I can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt like this song when it came out. I cancel myself over this)

**dreamingpastel** (10): I'M BOUT TO EXPLODE, TAKE OFF THIS LOAD

**frogaranaman** (10): Beyonc√© gets a pass for cosplaying as working class here since it was cunt in the end

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the way this fits into the album makes this song so much better

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the way Big Freedia elevates this song is incomprehensible

**intheaftermath** (10): giving this anything less than a 10 would be criminal. Oh it is SO over for Midnights

**joeeswift** (10): Why am I nostalgic for Summer 2022?? A bop!

**just\_thonking** (10): Godly transition

**milkywayinradius** (10): RELEASE YA JOB

**modulum83** (10): that transition instantly converted me

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I got it the first time idk y‚Äôall

**nick1372** (10): RELEASE YOUR WIGGLE!!!!!! TBH Big Freedia does not get enough credit for this song. As a sample she even outshines Beyonce.

**passionfruits2** (10): haters were saying the queen fell off, but i noticed when the album dropped, y'all SWITCHED TF UP. it was always a bop, but in the context of the album it's surely better.

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): While I like the Big Freedia song being sampled, I prefer its more sparing use in this diva house song. A strong return to form for Beyonc√©.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): as clich√© as it would be, this is still the RENAISSANCE 11 to me. Every time I hear it, it just sounds better than the last, it's just deliciously infectious.

**Roxieloxie** (10): no because its actually so insane how she *improved* the song in the album. I always liked it from the jump but the transition from energy into this is a 10 ten moment in music

**runaway3212** (10): FUCK CAPITALISM!!!!

**seanderlust** (10): BIG FREEDIA I LOVE YOU SO FUCKING MUCH AAAAA

**Stryxen** (10): she was in her common people bag

**Treecoh** (10): It wasn't originally a 10 but the energy -> break my soul combo is too good

**vayyiqra** (10): You kind of can't fuck up a Bey song with a sample as good as this and I can't believe I didn't really like this when it came out üòØ

**welcome2thejam** (10): Forgot til now, but the Big Freedia yaka-yaka-yakas were one of the best song moments of last year. I remember watching the lyric video and rewinding back to the closing Release the Wiggle again and again and having an out of body moment (or maybe that was the flashing lights trying to give me a seizure? Either way, incredible)

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.9): these samples are sooo good. love the verses!!! an anthem!

**jonnl2806** (9.8): My favorite memory of this song is hearing this in a gay club during my first ever pride and singing along to it with all the other gays who obviously had memorized the lyrics in the week since it had come out and it works so much better in the album context

**Kayaking11116** (9.5): slay pussy girl boss anthem of the century

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9.5): Another one to add to the banger collection that‚Äôs for sure!

**shipperondeck** (9.5): RELEASE YA JOB / RELEASE THE MV

**starla\_** (9.5): I love Black Box and Big Freedia so this is a no-brainer. The production is immaculate, the breakdown in the outro gives it that 12" club single vibe.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): why did i keep saying this is one of the weaker songs on the album. im going to kill one month ago me

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): flashbacks to when this leaked and I was praying it was a demo I hated it that much

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): omg this was an easter egg that she would in fact break her sole and need to get foot surgery before the dubai concert

**cremeebrulee** (9.3): listening to this song during work and trying not to quit rn challenge [IMPOSSIBLE]

**Poydoo** (9.3): I forget about this song sometimes but each time I listen to it, I'm like "yeah, this is pretty good"

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): I was a little worried for how this song would age, especially when the rest of the album is just heavy hitter after heavy hitter but honestly? I think it holds up just fine

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): first time I listened I was really enjoying it but then felt like it went on a bit too long but I quickly realised it earns every single minute of the track

**heysoupie** (9.1): I love this song. I love Big Freedia. Something about the key change around 3:15 irritates me a TINY bit but no other real critiques that I‚Äôd feel comfortable leveling (ope.)

**aakar528** (9): banger

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): unfortunately, Beyonce can't convince this twerking teenage student from quiting a job he'll never have out of sheer disorder/dysfunction.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): listen this came out at a time when i was working two jobs and finishing grad school and i just NEEDED this energy and determination in my life

**jsonphile** (9): this is a 6 or 7 on its own if I‚Äôm being honest, but a 9 in the album. The transition into this song is genuinely one of the best moments in music of this year

**masttup** (9): listened to this so much I really did quit my job, working on falling in love

**poemforsmallthings** (9): I'm the unemployed friend singing this a tuesday at 2 pm

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): middle of the pack in terms of my ranking of this album, but gets a bonus point for being my anthem any time i have a shitty day at work (which is often)

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Beyonc√© I have a job *so* I can afford to go to the club

**vexastrae** (9): people who say this is mid are contrarians i fear

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.6): my wiggle? released

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): pls no nine to five discourse for this one

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): way better in the context of the album, i can't deny this grew on me alot

**TiltControls** (8.5): Fantastic way to show off the album, but I think there's a few other tracks I like more

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute, def better in the context of the album but it does still drag a little

**FlavaSavaVandal** (8): why do I enjoy this so much in the album than on it‚Äôs own

**Frajer** (8): sorry my soul is broken

**katycat162534** (8): I flip flop on this song but the outro always gets me moving

**MassiveThief** (8): shoutout Big Freedia. I WILL release my wiggle.

**mimins** (8): very very good in the context of the album but as a single its slightly less

**Nagisoid** (8): Me when playing as the Lost in Binding of Isaac:

**nt96** (8): people died

**oscarbrierley1** (8): works so much more with the transition from energy than it did on its own.

**Shelly\_AO29** (8): This song is seriously elevated when listening within the context of the album.

**jman457** (7.8): if it was the Queens remix with vogue it would be fighting for my 11

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i overplayed this before the album came out so rarely come back to it but like... god its still so good

**fairytalehigh** (7.3): unpopular opinion, this song is seriously overrated and one of the weakest from the album, sorry (i ain't sorry)

**moonshxne** (7.3): the production just *hits the spot* right after ENERGY...but having sat with this, I think this song's main issue is that the melody is kinda awkwardly constructed around the "break my soul" hook...feel like they had other, better options (I say as i still give this a pretty high score)

#Break the speakers if this ever plays

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): bad choice for a single but it works really well in the album honestly

**nooodisaster** (7): If this is even in the top 10 I s2g I will hold each and everyone accountable to the release thread. (/s but the critical turnaround this song got's crazy)

**popularsong** (7): smth about it is a little grating and i do think "release your job" is a bit corny coming from her. the transition from energy is crazy good tho

**rfbeirut** (7): says a lot that this is the worst song on the album and

**shhhneak** (7): The worst song on the album so I‚Äôll take this one opportunity to drag it a bit. The essence of this song being release yourself from the chains of capitalism while she‚Äôs doing million dollar shows in Dubai is gross. Beyonce is not an ally of the working people and I have my tour ticket receipt to prove it.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): its hard to dispute this as a single choice cuz it went to #1 but i definitely saw its quick burn coming by like listen 3

**Birdseeding** (5): Another mystery single. Unlike with "Cuff It" I like the references to old Chicago house, but people, we've moved on.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): THIS FUCKING INTRO? Holy shit. I can't count all the times I've played this song and then gone back to the beginning just so I can listen to the intro again. Everyone went into this expecting to hear a song that was gonna talk about something bad, but no! It actually turned out to be one of the most fun songs on the album. It might be *the* most quotable song in the album for me. There's the NO! which I would say is more iconic to me than the UNIQUE! but it's a very close race.

**impla77** (9.4): I‚Äôm obsessed with this track (aka don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt give this a 10). Kinda live for how when Beyonc√© says ‚ÄòNo‚Äô it sounds like she‚Äôs telling off a child

---

#PATRIOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**amr** (11): ronald reagan

**MrMoodle** (11): tony fantano with them racks shoutout to the melon

**oscarbrierley1** (11): a song called America has a problem sampling a song called cocaine??? Her mind. Beyond a bop. The video of haim dancing with this playing on top is forever burned into my mind.

**passionfruits2** (11): the instrumental. 204080 out the trap, hit it with the rap, put it on the map, then we right back... BEYONCE WE DONT DESERVE MOTHER.... best song of 2022 argue with the wall.

**sufjancaesar** (11): i remember hating this so much on first listen bc i found it discordant and had pre-conceptions about the lyrics‚Ä¶ but oh man months later and this goes CRAZY - it all clicked and now makes for one of the most unique, gritty and layered songs of 2022‚Ä¶ just a hard asf retro-futuristic bop

**thatplatypus99** (11): HER MF BEST SONG

**1998tweety** (10): NO. I feel vindicated cause this was one of my favs on release and people are finally waking up to it.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Beyonc√©: ‚ÄúAmerica has a drug problem üòî. But I‚Äôm the drug üòè.‚Äù

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this might have been an eleven but unfortunately, I'm a stubborn Swiftie, also, yass, America kinda hates seeing their POCs being successful.

**avg-vag** (10): could have been a smash single

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Idk idk this might have been my 11 if I‚Äôd given it to a Renaissance song. The world may never know, and they can blame SZA.

**emayzee** (10): me watching the grammys as soon as i saw trevor noah hand an 80 year old harry styles stan the envelope to reveal that he won AOTY

**katycat162534** (10): Makes me want to scream out the lyrics every time

**Kayaking11116** (10): America has 99 problems but this is NOT one of them

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): this is going to be me when i see the songs i like leave on the first day

**modulum83** (10): you know that one time jimmy carter accidentally told people in poland that he wanted their people carnally and had left the US never to return? that‚Äôs the energy this song has

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): America does have a problem, indeed.

**nt96** (10): she ate the nation

**pastapixal** (10): i'm so glad it's going viral, so deserved

**plastichaxan** (10): America's problem being that she‚Äôs perfect it‚Äôs true

**popularsong** (10): she put said drugs in this one omfg

**PSSST12** (10): A BOP. The production and baseline incite a primal reaction from me. She's so unserious about the topic of this song though LMAOOOOO

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): this song sounds like it could have been on her self-titled 2013 album alongside songs like Flawless, but I still love it.

**ReallyCreative** (10): part of me wonders if this being so reminiscent of fighting game music is a nod to how black the FGC is, (Keke Palmer streamed Tekken mere weeks ago!) and the history of urban arcades but that‚Äôs possibly a reach. What isn‚Äôt a reach is the unspeakable things I‚Äôd let SF6 Zangief do to me

**rfbeirut** (10): grown on me so much she absolutely glides over the beat

**runaway3212** (10): I DIDNT REALISE THIS SONG STARTED AND THE LAST ONE ENDED IVE BEEN RENAISSANCED

**seanderlust** (10): beyonce saying "no" like i do when my cat starts eating something unidentifiable off the floor...she's just like me

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): Seeing this song blow up makes me feel vindicated as I am absolutely OBSESSED with it. Listening to it makes me feel like I'm in a club in the 80s. 20 40 80 out the trap!

**shhhneak** (10): But is America a sexy baby?

**shipperondeck** (10): mad underrated methinks

**Stryxen** (10): this mortal kombat round 1 intro

**UselessTacooo** (10): something something The Duality Of Man something

**vayyiqra** (10): The orchestra hits over the frenetic drums coupled with the dark and ominous melodies make this awesome üòØ

**vexastrae** (10): WE NEED THIS AS THE THIRD SINGLE NOWWWWWW

**bulforster** (9.7): Iconic that the big political statement of this album is that her pussy is too good.

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): wait so if shes supposed to be cocaine who's the other drugs? my vote's for slayyyter = fentanyl and lorde = gabapentin

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): and that problem is access to Beyonc√© tickets

**bogo** (9): yeah it's good

**daythreeinmiami** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bHDEtvkV24

**frogaranaman** (9): Beyonc√© comparing herself to crack cocaine is so

**masttup** (9): the beyhive on twitter when ppl critiqued bey for taking Dubai money

**mimins** (9): the harmonies...she's crazy

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9): video game vibes to me (good)

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): The intro to this reminds me of the In Living Colour theme song for some reason. Other than that, nothing else to add. It's a banger.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Love the word "goons" more people should use it in songs

**jman457** (8.7): this might be the biggest grower of the album

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): you think it's gonna be a protest song then she immediately starts singing about how her pussy is crack

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): never got the hype for this one, it has cool moments (the end production and chorus) but I find it forgettable as a whole (edit: nevermind it‚Äôs a grower)

**intheaftermath** (8.5): really funky, I do think the front half of the album is better though

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): ok the genius of this track is like‚Ä¶ yes and she doesn‚Äôt even have to SAY what it is‚Ä¶ like‚Ä¶ you already know

**starla\_** (8.5): this reminds me of Baby Got Back for some reason. It's very good.

**TiltControls** (8.5): for some reason i keep that bunch of notes in the background is going to transition into the mortal kombat theme or something

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): the all-time swerve from seeing this on the tracklist to actually hearing what it sounds like

**aakar528** (8): great flow

**Awkward\_King** (8): she said this ass is coke baby SNIFF IT

**jonnl2806** (8): When I first saw this on the tracklist I was expecting something along the lines of Freedom from Lemonade but this works too

**nooodisaster** (7.5): D.A.R.E. (Don't Rate AmericaHasAProblem Eleven)

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): reminds me of a tony hawk video game soundtrack in the best way

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I just got clickbaited and I ain‚Äôt mad

**jasannn** (7): she‚Äôs lucky this song associated with m3gan

**Nagisoid** (7): Her cliquebait era with this title

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): only one?

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): How American of her to say ‚ÄúAmerica has a problem‚Äù and then not specify what the problem is

#Stormed the capitol

**heysoupie** (6.8): I‚Äôm not arguing that America does not have problems, lmao. This has some Gaga-esque + ‚ÄúMy Boo‚Äù (Ghost Town DJs) vibes but like, in a v stressful  way

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): not bad but i just always forget about it for some reason

**Poydoo** (6): This is the same thing as the rest of the album, just not as memorable

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): yeah, America does have a lot of problems

#Just say no

**akanewasright** (10): [NO!!!! NO!!!](https://twitter.com/lexiebreona/status/1554097381725163521?s=46&t=UeAv0KRJsb_oKl5ESUba1Q)

**cremeebrulee** (10): beyonce: NO. me: excuse me?, mommy? sorry. mommy? sorry. mommy? sor‚Äî

**just\_thonking** (10): NO.

**poemforsmallthings** (10): NO

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): NO. NO. NO.

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): NO!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): NO

**impla77** (9): This is just so solid I couldn‚Äôt justify giving this a lower score. Its so telling that this isn‚Äôt a highlight of the album but its still so gooood

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I like this song, but it's definitely no where near the top of this album for me. I just feel like each element of this song is kinda just a worse version of an element from somewhere else in the album. However... the last minute where she goes EAT IT! EAT IT EAT IT EAT IT! Jesus christ that gets me fucking hyped as fuck.

ImADudeDuh: #Eating it up

**Bordersz** (11): The outro is a 10. Vibes on this are immaculate. Her runs are so dreamy.

**cremeebrulee** (11): i sometimes think that my taste is soooo nebolous & hard to pin down and then i'll claim [a drake co-write] as my favorite track (https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1037525072950341732/1038141754584600607/Screen_Shot_2022-11-04_at_10.24.09_AM.png) and be instantly humbled

**daythreeinmiami** (11): the biggest achievement I made in 2022 was learning the outro to this song.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (11): elevens across the board!

**Mudkip1** (11): I'd do unspeakable things to hear this in a club

**musical\_pyn** (11): This is the song--more than Alien Superstar, more than Cuff It, Break My Soul, or Virgo's Groove--that just absolutely embodies everything Renaissance is about

**plastichaxan** (11): This to me is the thesis of everything I like about this album‚Ä¶ Just incredible

**Stryxen** (11): you can tell drake wrote this but also that he used all his girlypop for the decade on it. And we thank him

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): this is one of the best outro's OF ALL TIME the way it subtly builds up during the whole song and then goes BAM ugh her mind

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (11): the outro. enough said.

**Treecoh** (11): how can a single song possibly serve this much cunt

**wasian-invasion** (11): the fucking back half of this song has infiltrated every aspect of my life  every time i see someone with food im legally required to scream "eat it eat it mmm yummy yummy yummy make a bummy heated"  i'll be walking gayly down the street when im suddenly enveloped by the vocal runs as she goes "face face face face ya"  i listened to this in bed high once and the way the snippets of lines repeat in the background and the whole song just slowly builds and crescendoes completely destroyed my sense of self as i was subsumed into the mother lake by uncle johnny himself

**1998tweety** (10): the last verse goes HARD

**AHSWeeknd** (10): people are like omg she‚Äôs so lucrative and sophisticated, then she pulls this out of the bag. Love her.

**akanewasright** (10): that ending part is like a full on career highlight

**Awkward\_King** (10): beyonce sat down, tucked a napkin into her collar, gracefully picked up her knife and fork and began to eat my pussy when she recorded this

**babadork** (10): I love the rap so much.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The structuring of this song is so good‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt start out at a 10 for this but yeah a few more listens and it got there.

**bogo** (10): yeah it's good

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): https://twitter.com/juan_tbqh/status/1562632362462027777?s=20

**CrimsonROSET** (10): me when I see a fancam reuse the raccoon clip

**DaHumanTorch** (10): *deep inhale* TIP TIP TIP ON HARDWOOD FLOORS

**DirtyRat583** (10): yeah i hear the drake girlypop on it

**frogaranaman** (10): ‚Äúonly the radio could play me‚Äù is the most Drake lyric not uttered by Drake himself ever

**horridhendy** (10): The last part of this song absolutely goes off. It's SO good. Anyone who gives this a low score is a flip-flop, flippy, flip-floppin'-ass bitch. If I had a second 11 then this would get it.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Not sure if I want my comment to be in the ‚ÄúTEN TEN TENS ACROSS THE BOARD LIKE MY SCORE‚Äù section or ‚ÄúBest thing Drake was a part of last year‚Äù section so I will comment both things.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): this song is so good that i can kinda see why drake would help make it and then immediately try to rush out a worse version of its sound thinking it would slay

**jonnl2806** (10): So this was second in line for my 11. It's a stand out track on album full of bangers. The outro just sends me into another dimension every single time. Sadly my sad bitch side won over my bad bitch side.

**jsonphile** (10): this would‚Äôve been like an 8 but ‚Äúflip flop flippy flip floppin ass bitch‚Äù is a god tier lyric

**katycat162534** (10): The outrooooo, it is set up so well.

**Kayaking11116** (10): EAT IT. EAT IT. EAT IT EAT IT EAT IT. MMM YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY MAKE A BUMMY HEATED (a fuckin poet)

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): whenever i hear beyonce say "eat it, eat it, mmmm yummy..." i picture beyonce yelling at blue ivy while she forcefully feeds her a spoonful of quaker oats

**masttup** (10): doing terrible dancing to this in my room daily

**mimins** (10): the ending is just straight nonsense and i will yell it with all my heart every time!

**MrMoodle** (10): You can totally hear Drake‚Äôs influence in that chorus, I figured he was involved before even reading the songwriter list. But then the ending just totally robs the song of all of its mainstream potential which I think is hilarious. Like, this could‚Äôve been the biggest hit on the album and then they decided to throw that in, it‚Äôs really good.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): the way she weaves the ending chant throughout the song as a warm-up scratches all the right itches in her mind

**nick1372** (10): the way all of the musical elements weave in and out throughout the song is so... chefs kiss

**nootnoot781** (10): best outro i have ever heard

**passionfruits2** (10): when she say WE CAN GET INVOLVED.... shivering.

**popularsong** (10): the outro verse that starts from tip-tip-tip is so fucking fun i hate to see drake win but its just so fun

**PSSST12** (10): 11 Candidate. One thing Ms. knowles knows how to do is END a song. that outro makes me feral everytime mygawd

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song made me understand Drake‚Äôs appeal more and I‚Äôll never forgive her for that

**rfbeirut** (10): drake's coming out <3

**Roxieloxie** (10): This is at a 9 and then that last minute hits and what do you want me to do

**runaway3212** (10): SHE CALLED OUT ALL OF POPHEADS WITH THIS

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): I can't believe Drake co-wrote this. The production details you hear when listening with headphones are just the cherry on top of an already great song. The outro is one of the best moments in her discography, if you don't scream it at the top of your lungs what are you doing with your life?

**shipperondeck** (10): amazing but the outro makes it a 10

**vayyiqra** (10): One case where repetition works really well on this album üòØ hot hot hot ‚ÄºÔ∏è

**vexastrae** (10): she slayed she slant she sloaned! 

 the realization that beyonce was the one chanting at the end AND it was being sampled the entire time like... we love a foreshadowing queen!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Once we hit "yummy yummy yummy make a bummy heated" you know it's about to go off the rails in the best way

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): TIP TIP TIP

**jman457** (9.3): Drake wishes he could make a song this good

**udontwannaknownoel** (9.3): Monday overrated Tuesday on my dick deserves a Pulitzer

**fairytalehigh** (9.2): the way i get ASMR from the way she says "MESS"

**pastapixal** (9.2): the outro alone is amazing

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.2): evocative yet simple and just a bop

**avg-vag** (9): drake‚Äôs greatest contribution to music

**bluehxrizon** (9): Uncle Johnny... your spandex creation did not get us in formation. I'm sorry my dear but you're up for elimination

**Nagisoid** (9): Me when the A/C stops working

**nooodisaster** (9): Grew SO much, I blame those damn fancams. Whoever wrote this snapped, every line is such sass, so petty, overloaded with cunt, yet 100% unbothered. Now that I think about it, this is what every Drag Race song in the last 7 years wanted to be.

**oscarbrierley1** (9): this proved to me that I'd like honestly nevermind by drake if someone else did the singing

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): got me swinging my upper body while I‚Äôm sitting on my chair doing nerd things

**TiltControls** (9): she's on fire with this track

**UselessTacooo** (9): I still think this is one of the ‚Äúworse‚Äù songs but that outro is just chefs kiss

**shhhneak** (8.8): The juxtaposition of both her and Taylor having lyrics about Kittys and how polar opposite they are is embarrassing for one of them.

**xqra** (8.7): https://twitter.com/juan_tbqh/status/1562632362462027777

**starla\_** (8.5): Uncle Johnny

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): I can't believe Beyonc√© got Drake to give her his best track

**emayzee** (8.2): the last minute and a half really elevates this

**IIIHenryIII** (8): this sure sounds like something Drake would release, maybe the most if not the only generic song on the album

**modulum83** (8): god DAMN she was feeling herself

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i wish the whole song had the same amount of energy as the last minute

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): Can‚Äôt rate it any higher because of the Drake stench on this one :/

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): IMO, this sounds like a really polished reject from Drake's recent album, controversially.

**Birdseeding** (7): It's really picking up now

#Like a dog in Allie X's car

**intheaftermath** (7): just not as exciting or memorable as other offerings here

**Poydoo** (7): Those backing vocals are fire but the actual song itself is just ok

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): TIP TIP TIP ON HARDWOOD FLOORS and all that

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): BOM BOM KAH KAH

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): the outro made this drop i fear

**aakar528** (5.5): good flow but outro ruined it for me

**impla77** (8.5): I love this new meta of songs just blowing up and then labels scrambling to make it a single. I had to listen to this one a few times to get it, I GET IT NOW. Also I think ‚Äòat the farmer‚Äôs market with your perfect peach‚Äô is an very underrated lyric. Just wish it was longer!!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I'm not gonna lie, I was disappointed when this became the big hit after the album dropped. I didn't really care about the song and found it a little underwhelming. However, now after it got bigger and bigger, it really grew on me. I think what helps is that I finally realized that this song isn't meant to be taken so seriously. SZA's going "oops, just killed my ex cause I'm angry and miss him lol" and it works. It works surprisingly well with the actual saddness she feels after seeing the ex has moved on without her. I am happy that this is a solo smash hit for her but fuck can this hit #1 already oml.

#Check on their exes

**jaztinax** (11): i have listened to this song every day since its release. EVERY DAY. i don‚Äôt even skip the tiktoks using this song. i‚Äôm so obsessed i WISH i could relate to it. it‚Äôs that bad

**QuaxlyDuck** (11): the true anthem for an Anti-Hero

**Uberpigeon** (11): me when im trying to hook up with my ex but hes scheduling it for before noon as if im gonna be awake before then

ImADudeDuh: #We support you queen

**1998tweety** (10): kill = onika, bill = burgers

**AHSWeeknd** (10): kino queen

**akanewasright** (10): I deeply love how, in the song, she‚Äôs killing this man for no other reason than not loving her back. There are so many songs about killing your ex because of some rational reason, I‚Äôm glad this is just killing a man for daring to move on

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): yass this is great and naur, it should've went number one but her RCA Label is a fucking bitch for wasting the opportunity.

**avg-vag** (10): very few voices can handle the delivery of this chorus - SZA is telling the truth but you aren‚Äôt concerned she‚Äôs a sociopath

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): SZA naming a song after the genre of rate shitposts? Ugh make her a mod.

**bluehxrizon** (10): murder fantasies are fun and cute when girls sing them

**cremeebrulee** (10): so many of the artists i enjoy have these grandiose songs about their exes and mine are so boring i fear

**CrimsonROSET** (10): please don‚Äôt kill people

**DaHumanTorch** (10): songs about women murdering men is the best genre

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): for 2 minutes and 34 seconds i AM cherry emoji twitter

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): i might kill my peeta...

**frogaranaman** (10): sorry to anyone named Bill after this song came out. I know you felt absolutely zero peace

**horridhendy** (10): Iconic

**ignitethephoenix** (10): she makes killing men seems so lovely

**intheaftermath** (10): It took me a few listens to love this one but once it clicked it CLICKED. I find it hard to resonate with SZA because I think her lack of vocal clarity makes her music less emotive and I prefer my music to be ridiculous and campy. I still find that to be the case on this song, but here it just works SO well - she sounds almost psychopathic and careless which in turn prevents this song from venturing into "deranged theatre kid" territory

**jasannn** (10): u can kill bill but u can‚Äôt kill these vibes

**jonnl2806** (10): It's crazy how this album just transports me to a place I was in two years like I am still in it. Probably should talk to my therapist about it...

**jsonphile** (10): you know I‚Äôm just glad we haven‚Äôt had any discourse on whether this song like, promotes domestic abuse and homicide or something and everyone just agrees this is a fun song

**katycat162534** (10): Insanely catchy!

**MassiveThief** (10): it's the big single for a reason

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): this is what Taylor thought she was doing with "no body, no crime"

**masttup** (10): me after blocking someone back after seeing they blocked me - I‚Äôm so mature, I‚Äôm so mature!!!!!!

**MrMoodle** (10): if eminem wrote kim for the girlies and the gays

**musical\_pyn** (10): this not being a rate winner because it's going up against maybe the best album of the 2020s will never sit well with me

**Nagisoid** (10): Everyone, stand up for Shakira's anthem!!!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I agree, kill that man

**nt96** (10): There's always Tony the Tiger

**oscarbrierley1** (10): with so many tracks on the album I expected to not remember any of the early songs after my first listen, but this always stood out to me.

**passionfruits2** (10): yasss hunty kill him yassss

**pastapixal** (10): when will song hit no1 my god.

**plastichaxan** (10): Need another 11 fr

**popularsong** (10): made some already annoying people even worse but its so good i cant even be mad about it

**Poydoo** (10): Already a classic, even though it's only been a couple months since it came out

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Yeah this one is ace. The chorus is so god damn catchy dude.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): miley you're next

**rfbeirut** (10): love when tiktok blows up a genuinely great song the look on my face the first time i heard the chorus was so fun

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): One of my favourite songs on the album! So happy to see how much success it's getting. SZA makes murder seem so appealing, makes me wish I had an ex I wanted to kill (jk...kinda).

**shipperondeck** (10): instantly iconic

**Stryxen** (10): incredible

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): hey guys since uma thurman didnt win 3mo you guys should let this song win a rate instead. i think thats good enough vengeance for that robbery of a placement

**thedoctordances1940** (10): deserves the hype

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): been there

**UselessTacooo** (10): Me when the bill is kill

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): and this is how you take inspiration from a movie, gone girl

**just\_thonking** (9.5): Something something Quentin Tarantino feet

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): ... --- -. --. ... / ..-. .-. --- -- / -... .-.. .- -.-. -.- / .-- --- -- . -. / .-- .... . .-. . / - .... . -.-- / ... .. -. --. / .- -... --- ..- - / -.- .. .-.. .-.. .. -. --. / .--. . --- .--. .-.. . / --. --- - - .- / -... . / --- -. . / --- ..-. / -- -.-- / ..-. .- ...- --- .-. .. - . / --. . -. -.. . .-. ...

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9.5): so catchy, just wish it was longer

**DraculaWeekend** (9): I don't condone violence but this is catchy

**dreamingpastel** (9): I have never seen a Quentin Tarantino movie.

**heysoupie** (9): so catchy, so interesting, such a rare expression of feminine anger

**mimins** (9): God i love crazy bitches we need more crazy bitches in music always

**nooodisaster** (9): We love a winner?

**starla\_** (9): I don't condone killing your ex or his new girlfriend, but if it's part of her creative process who am I to argue

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): going through Blinding Lights syndrome of "this has to be a sample from somewhere"

**Treecoh** (9): I don't want it to win but it is a slay

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This is for the yanderes

**wasian-invasion** (9): for some reason the "not the best idea" is so funny  just so casual while contemplating murder

**welcome2thejam** (9): The power to come back after five long years and just immediately jump to double homicide

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): we love a little psychopathy, as a treat

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.8): The 2nd best song in this rate about killing your ex

**modulum83** (8.7): i might‚Ä¶i might kill my petah not the best idea joe and quagmire‚Äôs next how‚Äôd i get hereee

**poemforsmallthings** (8.7): i really can't listen to this song without thinking about that person on twitter that said straight men shouldn't cover it because what if they really mean it

**aakar528** (8.5): i don't condone violence, unless it slays!

**Bordersz** (8.5): Madison Beer was in SZA's basement when she made this song. Lyrics hold it back from being a 10. Toxic and cringey as fuck.

**Frajer** (8.5): misandry wins again

**PhoneThePhoenix** (8.4): i also make bad choices sober

**emayzee** (8.2): sza at her most twenty one pilots

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): this sounds nice but I don‚Äôt like to think about murder

**jman457** (8): Its a good song, perhaps even a great one. I just find it overplayed by now

**Kayaking11116** (8): I'll condone violence ONLY if it's slayful violence

**moonshxne** (8): low-key and melodramatic af lullaby

**nick1372** (8): When SZA sings, "I just killed my eggs", she reveals that she is single-handedly responsible for the American egg shortage. When will this woman be stopped?

**vexastrae** (8): this song + boys a liar pt 2 + flowers on the billboard charts ouuuuu the exes are trembling in fear!

**fairytalehigh** (7.9): not a bad song i'm just sort of annoyed THIS was the song from the album that blew up so hard

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): SZA is such a verse and pre-chorus wizard on this but I HATE the chorus here because it seems so obvious‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI just killed my ex/not the best idea ://‚Äù is the ‚Äúit‚Äôs me/hi/I‚Äôm the problem it‚Äôs me :// that takes a 9 song to a 7.5 song

**Awkward\_King** (7): im very happy this has done as well as it has, the video is sick and honestly its a really decent track but it;s far from my fave on the album!

**daythreeinmiami** (7): Okay so my observations as a first-time listener as this song is that musically has the same chill vibe as Flowers by Miley, but better. I find it so much more interesting than Flowers. Soz Miley.

**TiltControls** (7): if this wins Fall Out Boy gets an honourary win too

#Reddit Cares message received

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): my beef w this song is that it feels like it still has something to build up to? like its incomplete

**Mudkip1** (6): I predict this will win and I won't be happy about it

**runaway3212** (6): yeah the chorus is good but these verses are so

**Birdseeding** (5): *THIS* is the biggest hit single? Another baffling choice, such a slight song. I've listened to it four times and I'm not sure I'd recognise it if I heard it on the radio

**shhhneak** (5): Desperately needs a Volume 2.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): the song is a bop but the topic gives me such an ick coming from a country with high domestic violence rates so 5 seems appropriate.

**vayyiqra** (0): Yes I'm 0ing a song everyone knows will be a frontrunner. Let me explain: it's not because it's popular (I've never heard it on the radio or anything). It's because I have this strong dislike of the concept being "violent revenge murder fantasy", which is a trope I am sick of and really don't like. It's highly distasteful to me. Yes I know it's all ironic and not serious (the "I'm so mature" line alone makes that clear) but it's still an offputting thing to write a song about. It's also coming to mind that Taylor talks about killing a man in Vigilante Shit, so that might seem hypocritical, but in that song she's literally quoting a meme so I let that go. Anyway, hope this explains why I don't like this and aggressively don't vibe with it! Sorry gang. (Oh but I do like the movie Kill Bill, which is pretty violent and I'm fine with it ... that's a movie though not a song so it's as not relevant here) Oh no I'm rambling üòî

**impla77** (11): Maybe this is because of how much my shuffle brought this up but this had to be my 11. The sample is pretty obvious, but I think this album and song earns it. And I‚Äôm obsessed with the LAYERING. Just a perfect capstone to this album

**ImADudeDuh** (10): You don't get a comment from me about this song because this is [scored higher than the original I Feel Love.](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/j0ujj4/classic_disco_singles_rate_reveal_day_3_my_11/g6vgdwm/)

ImADudeDuh: #oooooooooooooooooooooo it's so good it's so good it's so good it's so good it's so gooood

**apatel27** (11): It's just so damn good. The beat switchs, the delivery, the production all of it is just üëå

**fairytalehigh** (11): the showstopping full circle moment of not just the album, but also beyonce's forays into disco ("naughty girl" through dreamgirls, "blow," and then finally here). it's a remix, it's a cover, it's an interpolation, it's an homage (to summer, to "i feel love," to dance music culture at large), and it's a killer song in its own right. it's perfect. what else is there to say?

**Nagisoid** (11): Giving this a 11 to correct the historical mistakes of I Feel Love barely making top 10 in Disco Singles, so robbed. This surpasses Donna Summer at times, the sample is so well executed and Bey adds enough to make this her own song. The part where the track suddenly stops and then the instrumentation kicks in with an even better variation is easily the peak of this album.

**runaway3212** (11): DONNA SUMMER WILL BE REDEEMED!!!

**aakar528** (10): banger (flow is hard af)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer on a track with Beyonce is everything I ever needed, idc if it‚Äôs a sample. THIS IS IT.

**akanewasright** (10): I used to have this on my shower playlist, and I now just associate it with throwing ass while washing out shampoo‚Ä¶

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this Could've Would've Should've been my eleven but it's almost close.

**Awkward\_King** (10): she can perform in as many homophobic countries as she likes

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): One of the slayest interpolations of all time??

**bogo** (10): yeah it's so good it's so good it's so good it's so good it's so good

**bulforster** (10): I audibly gasped when I heard the I Feel Love sample come on the first time, that's history right there (and a robbery in the disco rate we can make up for here!!)

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): verSAce boTTEga prada balenciAga... vuitton dior giVENchy... collect your coins beYON-see...

**CrimsonROSET** (10): APPLAUSE! ROUND OF APPLAUSE!

**daythreeinmiami** (10): the perfect ending to an album. Ever.

**emayzee** (10): god this is just perfect

**Frajer** (10): I Feel Love is the greatest song of all time

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the Donna Summer sample is perfection

**IIIHenryIII** (10): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in my bag‚Äù is one of the deepest lyrics I‚Äôve ever heard and this is not a joke

**intheaftermath** (10): hell of an ending to a hell of an album. Can't believe this lost to Harry's House. Criminal and homophobic (i don't like it and I'm gay).

**jaztinax** (10): the amount of times i‚Äôve strutted through the city while listening to this

**jman457** (10): perfect end of a perfect album

**jonnl2806** (10): A Diana Ross sample and Beyonce at her best

**just\_thonking** (10): This three song run is legendary

**MassiveThief** (10): just straight up one of the best inerpolations ever. the way it's worked in is flawless.

**masttup** (10): listening to this and then I feel love back to back is self care

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Telfars: IN Birkins: OUT Happy Black History Month!

**nooodisaster** (10): Beautiful ending that hit on the first listen and has never faded.

**oscarbrierley1** (10): she heard the pop girlies were doing obvious samples and said lemme show you how it's done.

**pastapixal** (10): love how she's giving the QUEEN of Disco her flowers.

**popularsong** (10): why cant i give like five 11s to this album this is so hard!!!!!! also i need the visuals beyonce the tiffany promo video thing was so gorgeous

**ReallyCreative** (10): a damn near perfect closer holy shit

**seanderlust** (10): cannot describe how i lost my gd MIND hearing this interpolation at first

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): A perfect closer. The sample just showcases what this album is about; celebrating dance music of the past and its origins, and reimagining it for the present.

**Stryxen** (10): APPLAUSE. A ROUND OF APPLAUSE.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): modern history was watching legend Taylor Hale stream this for the first time live https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1570794465987825668

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): if its about summer why aren't there any lyrics about going to the beach

**TiltControls** (10): My initial fave on the album. The Donna Summer sample is played pretty straightforward, but why change perfection?

**UselessTacooo** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**vayyiqra** (10): This is dumb but every time I hear "applause, a round of applause," I think of the "delete, please delete" copypasta and it's the funniest shit ever to me but also a very good closing track ‚ÄºÔ∏è and this album does deserve a round of applause too üòØ

**vexastrae** (10): the third verse is literally the audio equivalent of injecting liquid gold straight into your veins

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.7): it is that good!!!!

**babadork** (9): I guess this is my last favorite song on the album. Something about it seems a bit restrained. I want an entire choir of BeyonceÃÅ‚Äôs singing Donna Summer.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (9): the sample use is a tiny bit too obvious but the song slaps

**frogaranaman** (9): you know what? she did the sample justice!

**horridhendy** (9): I think this is the best use of a sample. To take something as iconic as I Feel Love and successfully put your own spin on it‚Ä¶her mind.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): great closer

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Great way to end the album, another one for the banger collection.

**Roxieloxie** (9): if you dont know what a \* \* \* \* \*   \* \* \*  is they should ban you from having an opinion on this album

**starla\_** (9): I ascended the first time I heard this. Yes, the Donna Summer homage is kind of on the nose, but I respect her so much for just going there. Incredible finish to the album.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): this song only clicked with me about 3 weeks ago and now i'm obsessed

**udontwannaknownoel** (9): Collect your coins Beyoncee

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): SLAY BEE YON CEE!

**wasian-invasion** (9): yes beyonce i am a sexy motherfucker

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): Feels like a little bit of an underwhelming use of the donna interpolation/sample honsetly, the rest of the song is *so good* though

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): I do really like this song but it's not one of my favourites on the album

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes a good outro but I don't find myself listening to this a whole ton on its own

**katycat162534** (8.5): ‚Äúit‚Äôs soo good, so good so good‚Äù perfectly describes the album

**shipperondeck** (8.5): cant wait for summer to come back to dance to the donna summer celebration

**heysoupie** (8.2): starts to feel a little disjointed for me in the last minute

**Birdseeding** (8): I FEEEL LOOOOOVE

**mimins** (8): the harmonies are soooooo goooooood

**nick1372** (8): This is excellent in such a straightforward way that it almost seems lesser in the context of the whole album. But that's more because of the incredible quality of this album than anything this song does wrong.

**passionfruits2** (8): love you beyonc√© you slay mutha boots mutha God.

**QuaxlyDuck** (8): I like Giorgio Moroder, but other songs more than this. It works as an album closer though

**rfbeirut** (8): sure!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): why didnt she sample more of i feel love that was the best part of the song

**MrMoodle** (7.5): the fact that this doesn‚Äôt include the i feel looooooooooooove part is the blue ball of 2022 like come ON it was so obvious to end the album on a big synthy explosion like that

**modulum83** (7.3): music for shopping for bags at the gayest outlet mall in history

#which had more cultural significance? The Summer Renaissance or Single Ladies?

**jsonphile** (7): should‚Äôve sampled hot stuff instead it‚Äôs the better Donna Summer song don‚Äôt @ me

**Kayaking11116** (7): I'd like to think that I, too, could be a sexy mothafucker

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): i mean it‚Äôs beyonce singing over a donna summer sample so it‚Äôs not like it's gonna be bad... but it's honestly just not my favorite

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (3): this feels too much like karaoke to me. it just ends up making me want to listen to the original Donna Summer song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): **BEYONCE HAS OFFICIALLY SWEPT THE TOP 4 POSITIONS OF THIS RATE!** But if there was any song that deserved to challenge that position, I am very happy it was Good Days. 

Good Days is an ethereal song. It sounds produced by a higher being, which makes me upset learning that it was actually J\*c\*b C\*ll\*\*r that did it. The idea of wanting to be optimistic when you can't help but focus on the bad side of your past. It's the kind of mindset that we all aspire to be but sometimes can't muster the inner strength to think like that. If this song can hit you in the right mood, it will be the the best thing that will happen to you that day. It's absolutely beautiful, so it's no surprise that the only songs that can beat it are slut dropping sexy girl anthems. And I do mean that as a positive, my 11 still hasn't shown up yet!

**impla77** (10): a beautiful, sad but hopeful song.. doesn‚Äôt get old, which is a relief because it came out ages ago. Was sitting at #3 for a while.. but other songs overtook it. So this is the end of SZA, and a Beyonc√© top 4!

---

#Amazing days!

**bluehxrizon** (11): this song is like witnessing the stillborn birth of a child while simultaneously having the opportunity to see her play in the afterlife on Imax

**ExtraEater** (11): Instrumental alone is one of the best in any pop song since 2020, to say nothing of SZA's fantastic contribution. Miles ahead of all other songs in this rate, kinda like "Praying" in 'Rainbow vs. Reputation vs. Witness'

**Hulnia** (11): absolutely beautiful song, especially the outro. also the only good thing jacob collier has ever been involved in.

**jonnl2806** (11): I probably had like 5 songs I seriously considered giving my 11 to in this rate but at the end of the day the is the one that deserved it for me. I have been obsessed with it since I heard the snippet of it at the end of the Hit Different video and two years later it still gives me the same feeling I had when I first heard it. Jacob really did work some magic with the production on this and it really should have been the closer to the album because it's the perfect ending song.

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): literally the best song ever

**moonshxne** (11): Now *this* is what a career highlight sounds like! The glimmering guitars and dreamy synths are grounded by SZA's stunnnigly introspective and genuinely hopeful delivery. It all melds together into such a lush atmosphere that feels simultaneously fantastical and so *real*.

**nootnoot781** (11): i love the delusional girl (gender neutral) anthem

**nt96** (11): Easily one of the best songs that came out this decade, I said what I said. That outro is one of the best I‚Äôve heard in a while, we need more songs with outros instead of quick endings.

**pastapixal** (11): this song is what heaven sounds like

**Poydoo** (11): This song is absolutely gorgeous, holy shit

**RandomHypnotica** (11): there is so much good on this album, but Good Days is just pure poetry. Every line is jaw droppingly gorgeous, and Jacob Collier's flowery production really suits SZA's incredibly smooth vocals.

**throwaway-7650** (11): if jacob collier has a million fans i am one of them . if jacob collier has 100 fans i am one of them. if jacob has 10 fans i am one of them. if jacob have only 1 fan that is me . if jacob has no fans, that means i am no longer of this earth . if world against is jacob, then i am against the world.

**UselessTacooo** (11): This song got me through some shit. I know how pretentious and overdone that statement is, but it‚Äôs true. SZA genuinely made the perfect song here and while I almost sent my 11 elsewhere, my emotional connection to this song prevailed.

**wailord\_fan** (11): the instrumental reminds me of this computer game that I played as a kid that taught you how to type, and that's not a read, it is nostalgic as fuck and damn this song slaps

ImADudeDuh: #Great Days

**1998tweety** (10): thank LORDE she put this on the album cause its kinda the best song here

**aakar528** (10): love it

**AHSWeeknd** (10): this beat and production is next level

**akanewasright** (10): this winning a 2022 rate is a bit‚Ä¶ wrong, but the song is absolutely gorgeous and has gotten me through a lot over the years, so I can‚Äôt really object

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): so good, like really good.

**amr** (10): songs I gotta psyche myself up for before listening to cos of how powerful they are

**avg-vag** (10): deserving of an eleven

**Awkward\_King** (10): truly a magnup opus. her lyricism is beautiful as always but the real star of this is the angelic production on both the track and her voice, its so lush and calming and nostalgic, i hope this wins, whether its this rate or all stars 7

**bulforster** (10): would not be mad at this winning at all

**DaHumanTorch** (10): it's the classic

**DirtyRat583** (10): life #changed

**emayzee** (10): ethereal perfection

**fairytalehigh** (10): best song on the album. the combo of her vocals, her lyricism, and that gorgeous production, it's like floating away on a cloud. flawless

**frogaranaman** (10): maladaptive day dream fever baby manic pixie dream girl buzzword song

**ignitethephoenix** (10): why do I feel like the masterpiece was tacked onto the album and SZA probably didn‚Äôt want it on here

**jasannn** (10): atmospheric queen

**jman457** (10): Yeah this sounds like a really lazy summer day

**lipe18090** (10): I'd give it an 11 if I hadn't given it to SR

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): duhh

**masttup** (10): never gets old

**modulum83** (10): the lgbt community has FORGIVEN jacob collier

**Nagisoid** (10): No thoughts, empty mind, perfect song in every way. One of the few things Jacob Collier has been involved in worth paying attention to.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): this is her best song easily.

**nick1372** (10): this song is... too perfect. It should be my 11 by a long shot because of its lush production, SZA's voice, and the message of the song, but it's too perfectly crafted, I feel like I have to hold it at arm's length.

**nooodisaster** (10): So close to my 11, if this song wasn't originally released 80 years ago it'd have gotten it. Beautiful song that just radiates light from its core. Positive & life affirming, but not in a fake Katy Perry way. Prob my favorite SZA song.

**poemforsmallthings** (10): such a gorgeous song in every sense of the word

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): The production on this is so smoooooooth and dreamy my God. The instrumental section at the end is so blissful. The Jacob Collier background vocals are a nice touch too.

**PSSST12** (10): The whole album should have sounded like this smh. Like THIS is the shit I am down. Ethereal spring realness. üò´

**ReallyCreative** (10): something shifted (complimentary)

**seanderlust** (10): that outro...floating. if beyonce weren't here this would be an obvious 11.

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): This song feels like a warm, tight hug. Just reassuring me that everything will be alright. One of my favourite SZA songs, ever.

**shhhneak** (10): An album of F2Fs and Good Days... a lot of popheads faves would be scared.

**shipperondeck** (10): this song is like the warmest biggest most refreshing hug

**starla\_** (10): okay maybe this and Shirt are both my favourites. The soundscape here is gorgeous. I never get sick of this song.

**Stryxen** (10): perhaps the song ever? No. Definitely.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): great song, great production. such a transcendental song

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the only good jacob collier has brought into this world

**wasian-invasion** (10): this came out when trump was still president

**welcome2thejam** (10): Goddamn that's lush. Also between this, Kehlani, and Lizzy McAlpine, maybe Jacob Collier should just quit his own stuff and be a collab guy the rest of his life, cause that's now three 2022 albums where he showed up, did work on my favorite track, and bounced

**xqra** (10): This song makes me feel things that are hard to describe or replicate. If I could give another 11 this would be it

**vexastrae** (9.9): removing 0.1 points for jacob collier

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): the way a song from 1867 is gonna win an ultimate rate in 2023 omfg

**udontwannaknownoel** (9.2): Feels like winter transitioning into spring and leaving behind a rough patch in your life a better person

**intheaftermath** (9): ily Jacob Collier i don't care what anyone else says

**jsonphile** (9): the definition of ‚Äúvibe‚Äù

**just\_thonking** (9): Another song that didn't fully click until recently

**MassiveThief** (9): i want to tank this for making me think of 2020 but it's just too good. oh but let's not give jacob collier a rate win pls

**rfbeirut** (9): loved it 20 years ago when it first came out but this one didn't get old

**slimboyfriend** (9): shocked that something amazing came out of a jacob collier collab

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Sounds very spacey and atmospheric, maybe the Grammy‚Äôs had a point dumping all those awards on Jacob Collier

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Part of me definitely wants a SZA upset win for the gag but also I know it would be with this song which‚Ä¶while it‚Äôs really good, also isn‚Äôt one of my favorites.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): okay i finally see the light with this

**IIIHenryIII** (8): what a marvelous outro

**Kayaking11116** (8): also icon

**passionfruits2** (8): anyone remember the day one version of this song... it was horrible, glad  they fixed it.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): the best way to describe this song is smooth and comforting

**TiltControls** (8): it's a good song, but i never really got the hype for the track as a 10/10 smash

**vayyiqra** (8): Though I haven't been huge on this album so far this is a good song üòå

**PhoneThePhoenix** (7.4): chill beats to reconsider your life to

**Birdseeding** (7): A return to a bit of the old trippy SZA that works really well

#i've had bad days recently

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): yes, it sounds very pretty and i appreciate the effort the went into it, but it also doesnt really do anything for me personally? i listen to this and think ‚Äúyeah, that was a nice song‚Äù and thats about it

**MrMoodle** (6.5): i get why people love this one but all the reverb on those guitars is just a little sickly sweet idk i think it went overboard trying to capture that heavenly vibe

**horridhendy** (6): I don't really get the hype around this song - it's fine.

**mimins** (6): forgettable but i like the vocals

**popularsong** (6): i think i dont get it like most ppl on the sub do, the instrumental is so beautiful and makes me feel floaty, but i dont care for the song itself :( like her vocals detract from it for me somehow...?

**runaway3212** (6): this grew on me so much just to grow off me just as much

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): mid days

**Roxieloxie** (4.8): - .... . / .--. .-. --- -.. ..- -.-. - .. --- -. / --- -. / - .... .. ... / .. ... / ... --- / .--. .-. . - - -.-- / -... ..- - / - .... .. ... / - .-. .- -.-. -.- / ... ..- ..-. ..-. . .-. ... / - .... . / -- --- ... - / ..-. .-. --- -- / -- . / -. --- - / -.- -. --- .-- .. -. --. / .-- .... .- - / - .... . / ..-. ..- -.-. -.- / ... --.. .- / .. ... / ... .- -.-- .. -. --. / --- -. / - .... .. ... / --- -. . .-.-.- / .. / .- .-.. ... --- / .-- .. ... .... / .. - / .-- .- ... -. - / ... --- / .-.. --- -. --. / -... . -.-. .- ..- ... . / .. / ..-. . . .-.. / .-.. .. -.- . / .- - / .- / -.-. . .-. - .- .. -. / .--. --- .. -. - / .. / .--- ..- ... - / -.- .. -. -.. .- / - .- .--. / --- ..- - / ..-. .-. --- -- / .. - --..-- / .-- .... .. -.-. .... / .. ... / .-- .... -.-- / .. .----. ...- . / -. . ...- . .-. / .-. . .- .-.. .-.. -.-- / ...- .. -... . -.. / .-- .. - .... / .. -

ImADudeDuh: # SOS

---

**Overall Average**: 7.661 **// Average Controversy:** 1.760

---

ImADudeDuh: I am so glad SZA finally got out an album after 5 years since CTRL. I wish it was tightened up a bit with like 5 songs removed. I also didn't connect with it the same way as I did with CTRL, but I believe that can be explained with how SOS is more focused on romance and breakups and that is just not as relatable for me. Still a great album with many songs I still keep on rotation nowadays.

impla77: This album didn‚Äôt hit for me in the same way that it did for many other popheads. There‚Äôs a few too many tracks on here, if some were removed and other tracks were lengthened to flesh them out a bit more, I think that would be beneficial. I like a lot of the tracks, but I don‚Äôt necessarily think they all fit together on the album so this is solidly middle of the pack for me in this rate!

=====

ImADudeDuh: **Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9.457): an excellent follow up to CTRL. This has grown on me immensely and it‚Äôs honestly gonna keep growing.

**AHSWeeknd** (9.391): is it pronounced ‚Äúsauce‚Äù or ‚Äúess oh ess‚Äù?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.165): I prefer this to CTRL, a truly great level-up for such a talented artist. Great variety of sound, SZA‚Äôs lyrics and melodic choices are wonderful.

**MasterWizardRyan** (9.139): it's amazing how this had 23 songs and it never got stale, that's a real fucking legacy

**avg-vag** (9.130): 9.13 This is a great album - sza hits the sweet spot when she's exploring new ranges

**throwaway-7650** (8.813): wonder if I'd have a 9+ average for the deluxe if it actually exists

**jsonphile** (8.739): This is easily my favorite of these three albums. And I‚Äôm hoping this gets a AOTY nomination and maybe even a win next Grammys (assuming nothing better comes out). It may be a bit longer than it needs to be, a few songs that I would skip, but overall just a great record. Maybe I‚Äôm just in love with SZA‚Äôs voice. And she has a way of singing lyrics that would sound bizarre coming from anyone else, but sounds perfect coming from her

**PhoneThePhoenix** (8.709): a good album!!

**shipperondeck** (8.678): fell to my knees many times when this dropped

**akanewasright** (8.665): I think

**welcome2thejam** (8.522): Consistently great album. I mean, the only sub-7 score got it because it was too short and I wanted more

**nick1372** (8.500): This album is just soo good in such a straightforward way! SZA is one of the most expressive vocalists out there today and the sonic universe she's created for this album is so lush and inviting but also so refreshing and emotionally meaningful. It's just incredible.

**Frajer** (8.478): Easily the funniest punchline to her taking 5 years to releasing a sophomore album was for it to be a smash hit

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8.391): this is great, like it's great, but some tracks are filler.

**jasannn** (8.348): I would have never thought that I would like a 23 track album from start to finish but she really did that. It‚Äôs not cohesive as Ctrl but what is? It still feels like a complete project tied together by her amazing vocals and lyrics. This was a worthy successor and one of my favorite albums of last year. I am manifesting to have gotten SZA tickets and seen her by the time rate results are revealed.

**frogaranaman** (8.261): she wore a Blues jersey on the album cover then skipped St. Louis in the SOS tour I fucking hate her so much

**moonshxne** (8.170): SZA's smooth vocals are a truly beguiling mix of icy and stunningly emotive. For me, they can occasionally come off as harsh and piercing against the mix, but they're far more often captivating. I won't deny the hefty tracklist is kind of (purposefully) all over the place and could use a cut or two, but I really loved the overall throughline of exploring solitude and its general theme of drawing out contradictions from all sorts of sentiments. Honestly, the sometimes whiplash-inducing tracklisting is also what makes this feel particularly free and grounded and genuine.

**fairytalehigh** (8.165): could've benefitted from a stronger editor. it's so goddamn long for my ADD ass that the songs run still run together after like 6 listens and rating this has taken the longest. that said, it's still a worthy follow-up to CTRL and has some fantastic moments on it.

**wasian-invasion** (8.065): there are many perks to being a marine biologist like having boats easily available for your album art. This is by far the best 2022 album for a nice quiet night in on the couch with my cats which is a genre ive appreciated a lot. also sos made me go back and listen to ctrl, which im ashamed to admit i had never really gotten into as a full album before

**jaztinax** (8.061): sza serving AOTY at the very end of 2022? love that for her

**nt96** (8.057): A pretty solid album although it‚Äôs no CTRL. The length is questionable, given how slightly filler-ish the middle section is. A few tracks removed here and there would have easily made album near perfect.

**beyzxzhen** (8.000): this album feels so full and complete. it's so cohesive sonically, lyrically, thematically‚Ä¶while also being beautifully varied. just masterful

**DevilsOfLoudun** (8.000): I couldn't get into Ctrl at all but this album was such a pleasant surprise. I don't know how to rate it because all the songs are consistently good, probably gonna give everything an 8 or something.

**modulum83** (7.978): extremely long, yet surprisingly consistent, if lacking true all-time firing-on-all-cylinders energy - basically, to use a taylor swift metaphor, this feels like her Red. it's great to get lost in, and the one-note hitting of "I JUST BROKE UP WITH SOMEONE AND I AM AN ABSOLUTE WRECK" over and over is funny but i'm in a place where i'm inclined to find it endearing. it's honest, very catchy, and low-stakes. not the album from SZA we wanted, but the one we deserved.

**plastichaxan** (7.965): I really like this album but why does it have to be so long? If she had trimmed a couple of songs this would be *chef‚Äôs kiss*

**vexastrae** (7.952): the buzzer beater of 2022 pop albums! admittedly, i thought that this was bloated on first listen, but upon relistening to this as a whole its actually pretty consistent! at times it presents itself more as a playlist than it is a holistic album experience, but given how long the wait between CTRL and SOS was, and how much SZA wants to explore other sonic avenues complimenting her rnb and neo-soul roots, i can respect the artistic decision to have the album as big as it is. theres something for everybody here, and im glad that SZA has delivered yet again! now we just need kill bill to reach number one on the billboard charts ...

**DirtyRat583** (7.926): does sza not think of us raters when she makes a 23 song, generally ok album? shame

**bulforster** (7.904): I don't have much to say about this album except that the songs are mostly just very good, especially for there being 23 of them.

**starla\_** (7.870): I still think this album is too long. For a too-long album, though, it does have a high proportion of bops and bangers. SZA has explored a variety of sounds and really shown her strengths, especially in how her voice just hovers effortlessly over any beat.

**apatel27** (7.870): There's a great album inside this good deluxe release

**amr** (7.857): just needed to be trimmed a bit cos there's lots of gems but I understand she probably put this many songs on it so ppl would see it as generosity and her baseline quality is high enough that only one song on here is outright unforgivable

**TiltControls** (7.826): can feel a little fillery at times, but at its worse it's never bad. Plus the number of songs on the album really let SZA branch out and have some variety too

**dreamingpastel** (7.826): The first half of the album is a bit of a rocky slow burn for me, but the second half is near perfect.

**oscarbrierley1** (7.739): I need someone to do an in depth interview with sza for her to explain this track ordering because it's so random, especially in the second half

**thedoctordances1940** (7.670): Yeah I don't really have much to say about this album, for the most part it's just really solid. Doesn't really have anything bad although there are a few tracks I feel like could've been cut, especially with how long the album is as a whole and it doesn't have all that many standouts but the few standouts do tend to be very good

**jman457** (7.583): Def a killer album in here, even if there is more than a fare share of filler.

**1998tweety** (7.478): Bloated album but the hits hit

**ktajlili** (7.435): it‚Äôs good

**sufjancaesar** (7.391): Obviously could‚Äôve been cut down but SOS gave SZA the freedom to vibe, explore different genres and give us a deeper look into her multitalented musical (and sometimes pathologically lying) brain. Most of this is great, and even when it‚Äôs not, I‚Äôm still content that I got to hear more of SZA‚Äôs artistry!

**dream\_fighter2018** (7.348): yeah this is good, but I think even the best hour plus albums have some filler. My average might have raised substantially if this was about 5 tracks shorter, because quite a few of these tracks are super good but the others feel just packed in to stuff the track list.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.304): not better than ctrl but not many albums are

**shhhneak** (7.304): Overall this album is cute but for a project that‚Äôs been in the works for a long time coming it lacks a certain polish and direction. It‚Äôs like she accidentally included her demos. Girl, this ain‚Äôt a Big Thief LP!

**just\_thonking** (7.261): Not amazing (Renaissance) or bad (Midnights) but some other third thing

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.261): The Main Pop Girl-ization of SZA has been amazing to witness, and I say this as someone who‚Äôs not really a fan. I didn‚Äôt really have high expectations for SOS cause I wasn‚Äôt that familiar with her work before, but WOW I may like her lyricism even more than supposed ultimate songwriter Taytay. She gets at those relatable feelings and sentiments but she describes them so artistically, and she‚Äôs the special kind of writer that knows how to craft a musical phrase to perfectly show off the strengths of her voice, mainly her tone. I love that she sounds beautiful even without having to reach high notes. Admittedly this album wasn‚Äôt good enough to turn me into a modern RnB fan, but there are some pretty great tracks on here nonetheless.

**lexiaredery** (7.252): There's a lot that works on this album, and some that I'm not crazy about, but isn't bad. Very good overall.

**nooodisaster** (7.130): Can't and can never handle a 23 album STANDARD album. So this is by far my least listened to of the 3. But that cover art... oh you won EASILY.

=====

ImADudeDuh: **MToms** (7.126): One song is chill, more is overkill. Most of these songs seemed to blend in with each other sonically. Some of her lyrics do stand out though.

**slimboyfriend** (7.100): sure it would be a 9/10 like Ctrl but it‚Äôs too damn long

**IIIHenryIII** (7.000): I basically forced myself into liking this album lol I liked it when I first listened to it, but most of the tracks were skips for me. Now I can listen to it almost fully.

**Nagisoid** (6.957): This is her White Album. Jokes aside, I don't have much to write about this album because while it is definitely weaker than CTRL, it is not really a clear regression like Midnights for Taylor. In some ways I'd argue she is developing more as an artist by trying new styles even if she doesn't succeed at first. Most songs here are very nice and vibey and while that makes most of them very inoffensive that also means they can become unremarkable. The highlights here however soar really high; I'm thinking of Good Days, Kill Bill, Ghost in the Machine, etc. I don't have much thoughts on the pop rock and adult contemporary cuts other than I'm not really interested in her doing these styles, but she does them decently enough. CTRL is more consistent but this is more of an artistic statement. I'm excited for what she makes next more than any other artists in this rate, as she shows tons of potential, but I'm personally rooting for a folk-oriented project from her. TLDR: I enjoyed this in good amount.

**horridhendy** (6.935): 23 songs on the standard release?! Ugh. I guess it's personal preference but I don't like albums with too many songs (I'm fine with long albums but having loads of songs just becomes unwieldy). It just makes it hard to digest and it means a lot of songs are getting lost in the shuffle. It has taken a while for me to get a full grasp on this album and work out what I really think of it. I think there are some standout songs and it has grown and grown on me. The thing is, the whole album just listening to it, it‚Äôs good but cut eight songs off this and it's an incredible album.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.783): listen, i dont care how much of an a-lister you are or how long its been since you released your last album, but NOBODY should be releasing an album thats 23 songs long, especially one with as much filler as this. this could‚Äôve been such a instant classic if sza trimmed about 6-7 songs worth of fat, but as it stands its just too bloated for me to fully enjoy

**MassiveThief** (6.565): after a few months, I feel confident in saying this album is pretty mid. outside of the singles there is not much, and it's waaaaaaay too long

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.509): we wanted Big Boys

**FlavaSavaVandal** (6.370): when people say less is more, they are talking about this album

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.200): my biggest issue w sza has always been her voice like i just dont like her tone at all which makes her music a slog for me most of the time. tried to set that aside here but shes just not pleasant to listen to for me

**vayyiqra** (6.174): I was kind of dreading listening to this album and putting it off. Why? This album seems widely liked on Popheads, and I had a feeling I wouldn't like it at all. Last thing I want is to give a bad score to a popular album and lose social currency! Nah that's a joke. The reason is that I just have never been able to get into SZA. I tried Ctrl before, a few times, and didn't get it. I like R&B but I'm not a big fan of her voice and don't know why ... I like her music fine while it's playing, but it doesn't leave any impression on me. That coupled with this album being super long meant it was hard to get motivated to listen to the whole thing. However, it turned out to be pretty alright! The short songs are also something I don't care for, but then this album has 23 tracks so something had to give. Maybe not something I'll be listening to a whole lot, but I see the vision ... just wish I could connect to her music more. üòî

**Mudkip1** (6.043): I really wish I understood the hype surrounding her

**Birdseeding** (6.043): 7 SZA is a genius performer and lyricist but she doesn't cut it as a pop songwriter. So many of these songs are just meandering and hookless, and I find myself barely remembering them immediately after a listen. It's a shame because she really is an amazing musician in every other way than being able to write memorable pop.

**mimins** (5.848): a lot better than midnights but noticeably worse than renaissance. i liked the earlier tracks more than the later half

**Around-Town** (4.739): Man, this album was dull. I know other people love it but truly I don't see the appeal of any of these songs. None of them are bad, mostly just boring.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): As ballroom culture started growing more and more in mainstream culture thanks to RuPaul's Drag Race, POSE, and Legendary, it was only natural that some mainstream star would evenutally make a vogue song. Beyonce being that artist is such a good choice. This song is just pure cunt (complimentary). AND THEN WE GET TO THE SECOND PART OF THE SONG!!! We get Beyonce back in her sex mode, and it just puts a smile on my fave whenever I get to that part.

**impla77** (10): The first half of this sounds like a rugirl song but with good production.. and the second half is so different but it all works so well.. I mean who is doing it like her?

---

#Pure Bliss

**DaHumanTorch** (11): i'm hunty get real cunty if i come for you it will not be funty

**nick1372** (11): so much of this song doesn't even make sense but it just tickles my brain so good

**popularsong** (11): both parts are just perfect separately and together. blew my mind first time i heard it. reading abt how the miss honey sample was added on in a spur of inspiration by the producers made me oddly so happy, it really feels like fate was moving this song to truly click

**Roxieloxie** (11): Black Queer Essence at its finest

**TiltControls** (11): It was a tough competition for the 11 this year, but the lines in this track are too memorable and iconic not to give it the top score

**vexastrae** (11): she knew she was cooking when she made that intro ... we love to see kevin aviance appreciation in this household

**1998tweety** (10): CUNT/MOTHER. This is literally gay culture

**AHSWeeknd** (10): She might as well have spelled out M O T H E R

**akanewasright** (10): every time I see a straight person praising this I‚Äôm surprised‚Ä¶ like serve, they‚Äôre objectively correct, but

**bogo** (10): yeah it's cunt

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): surprising myself by not throwing my 11 behind my actual favorite on the album, but i explained it more in that song's comment. this is sooooo fun and the Miss Honey sample at the end gagged me so hard the first time i heard it. pretty boys make some noise!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): bad bitches make some noise!!! (am broke after looking at bey tix)

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Don‚Äôt ask me WHY I think about Miss Honey from Matilda dancing to this song, I just do.

**MassiveThief** (10): bad bitch national anthem, stand up thotties

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): my queer powers activate when i hear this song

**nt96** (10): bees can never produce what this song had to offer

**PhoneThePhoenix** (10): love that this song has a couple different bits but it still works so well together. every part is so good

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): I like how many songs on this album seemingly change halfway through into an almost different song, or at least a different groove, and this song best exemplifies this.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): [bisou!](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Cap0BOzizbw)

**ReallyCreative** (10): bad bitches (and Rexhars and true Bebe Rexha fans ONLY) to the left

**Treecoh** (10): i don't ~quite~ see how this is the fan favorite but i do kinda see it

**vayyiqra** (10): üò≥

**wasian-invasion** (10): Pure for men fiber supplements really missing out on a slam dunk ad concept here

**seanderlust** (9.5): miss honey....miss HONAAY....miss hooonnaaayy.....

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This is a slay my only complaint is I wish we got a bit more of the second part of the song.

**Bordersz** (9): I'm dancing in the middle. The outro holds it back from a 10.

**frogaranaman** (9): Pooh Bear to their jar:

**hikk** (9): i'm hunty i get real cunty if i come for you it will not be funty

**horridhendy** (9): Pure would have been a 10, Honey is an 8 so it all equals out to a solid 9.

**nooodisaster** (9): This is no Hard Feelings/Loveless, both sides are actually good here!

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): A Voguing anthem! Love the transition to HONEY.

**starla\_** (9): the second half beats the first for me, but the whole track is a banger.

**UselessTacooo** (9): cuntcuntcuntcunt

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.9): She went scuba diving in Mother Lake

**shipperondeck** (8.3): i like the first half more but still an overall slay

**passionfruits2** (8): no comments, i like this one, just not as much as the rest.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): I would love to have an extended version of the "PURE" section just so I could get my vogue on even harder. The "HONEY" bit is fine I guess.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): bad bitches = everything you own in a box

**Uberpigeon** (8): cunty cunty cunty cunty cunty cunty cunty cunty

**welcome2thejam** (8): Killer switch-up

**modulum83** (7.7): somewhere in the middle of the album we switched from sweaty nightclub music to runway modeling music

**aakar528** (7): issa vibe

**Birdseeding** (7): The album gets better and better as it goes along, for once the retro stylings work well and push the energy forward

**intheaftermath** (7): Matildacore

#Trying to catch flies with vinegar instead of Honey

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**heysoupie** (6.5): I‚Äôm sorry but the c*nty feature just doesn‚Äôt sit well with me at all, and the rest feels too cheesy in the same way that ALIEN SUPERSTAR does.

**jsonphile** (6): I‚Äôm not sure what ‚Äúmoney money cunty hunty‚Äù is supposed to mean I think I‚Äôm too straight for this song

**bluehxrizon** (5): uhh definitely i thought it was fun, i liked the beat

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (4): way too repetitive lyrically for me

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I think this song's placement will be the most shocking placement of day 3 in the reveal. I was surprised by how well the song did the entire rate. After a while it was never out of the top 6. Also, it somehow got the **MOST 11's** in the rate? I did not expect that.

 This song feels like what happens when you make PLASTIC OFF THE SOFA just a little more interesting. I would say it‚Äôs an underrated song, but judging by it‚Äôs placement, it‚Äôs perfectly rated! ~~maybe even overrated? ou~~ I just wish it ended like a minute sooner

**impla77** (8.3): I‚Äôm sure a lot of raters will be pleasantly surprised at the placement of this song being so high, it gave off like.. #8 energy to me. So I‚Äôm sad and slightly ashamed to say.. I think this song is great, but not even in my top half of this album! Hopefully if I listen to it more I will start to feel the whole fantasy.

ImADudeDuh: #Virgos with Pisces Moon and Scorpio Rising

**aakar528** (11): THE.BEST.TRACK. (still on loop)

**akanewasright** (11): well and truly I got to this song on my first listen through and was STUNNED. Like yes, this is Beyonc√©, probably the best pop star and vocalist we have right now, but I was still floored at how groovy and smooth this is. It‚Äôs suuuuch a masterpiece. And the runs at the end‚Ä¶ my god. Literally no one is doing it like her

**Around-Town** (11): Favorite song of the rate, outside the rate I'd give it an eight; it's great.

**avg-vag** (11): the yonceÃÅ groove, bowing down

**babadork** (11): I changed my 11 so many times while working on this, but this was always one of the top candidates. I love a long disco song.

**beyzxzhen** (11): i don‚Äôt even know what else to say about this, my 2022 soty, it's fucking magical.

**bulforster** (11): Love it when the longest song on the album is also the best song ever

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): honestly this song could be seen as like... a thesis statement for her entire career. pays homage to her predecessors with it's throwback sound while still remaining distinctly fresh and new, and the range she displays here is immense. never have i ever been so proud to be a Virgo

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (11): Elevate me to new stratospheric erotic silky heights Queen B

**heysoupie** (11): when they said Bey made a dance album, THIS is what I was expecting.

**MassiveThief** (11): it's hard for me to grasp this song being 6 minutes, because as soon as it starts I enter a trance like state and lose any concept of time

**poemforsmallthings** (11): She was a protozoan in the mother genome & underwent the motherly process of motherlution (mother evolution) thru millions of years & surviving the motherlocalypse that took out the dinosaurs and survived the crusades to finally give us this exact moment.

**PSSST12** (11): The Best Song of all time I fear. NGL this song wasn't even on my radar in the first few months of release but then I LISTENED to it. Changed my life. Those ending riffs and runs are top 10 musical moments in pop music this decade like go argue with the wall

**redgold51** (11): Resisted the feminine urge to give 11s to every song on this album

**seanderlust** (11): one of the best songs of all time and i'm not even being hyperbolic here. those harmonies? that GROOVE? undeniable.

**Shelly\_AO29** (11): This song makes me ASCEND every single time I listen to it, definitely one of the best songs in her entire discography. It makes me want to dance and cry at the same time. This is what I imagine being in love sounds like. 6 minutes have never felt shorter.

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): because cancer‚Äôs groove just doesn‚Äôt roll off the tongue as well

**udontwannaknownoel** (11): I died and ascended to heaven when I heard that bridge

**xqra** (11): My favorite song from this album, rate, her discography, and maybe ever? It's like a six minute sonic ascension to heaven, and Beyonc√© is the angel guiding you

**1998tweety** (10): I'm a Virgo, I claim this song üòå

**AHSWeeknd** (10): this could singlehandedly revive disco.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): could've, would've, should've but alas, I'm a Swiftie.

**Awkward\_King** (10): magnum condom magnum ice cream magnum OPUS

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This appears to be the nerds‚Äô overall song of choice for Renaissance. I don‚Äôt always support nerds, but I do here.

**bluehxrizon** (10): People died. God was scared. And the world was starving. Then came ~~Addison Rae~~ Bey with this piece of pop perfection. Suddenly, everything and everyone was shining as bright as the sun.

**bogo** (10): yeah it's good

**cremeebrulee** (10): what did jay-z do to be loved like this

**CrimsonROSET** (10): she‚Äôs just showing off at this point

**DraculaWeekend** (10): So smooth

**ExtraEater** (10): The best style of House she covered for this album

**FlavaSavaVandal** (10): yes I do love disco music, how could you tell

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): the way this song is 6 minutes and i'm still enraptured by every second...

**frogaranaman** (10): +2 since I‚Äôm a Virgo myself

**ignitethephoenix** (10): seven minutes of excellence

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I refuse to believe any other performer could pull this off

**jonnl2806** (10): I don't know what to say but other than this is just disco perfection

**just\_thonking** (10): This wasn't a standout for me originally but when I started working on the rate suddenly it clicked and I coudn't stop playing it. It's so sublime....

**katycat162534** (10): Such a well crafted song that keeps building up!

**Kayaking11116** (10): I've never been happier to be a Virgo oh my God

**masttup** (10): not the Virgo‚Äôs I know but go off!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): SLAY.

**MrMoodle** (10): yeah holy shit

**Mudkip1** (10): gets better with every listen

**Nagisoid** (10): All these emotions??? She knows about popheads queen Carly Rae Jepsen!!!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): this is just sonic perfection

**passionfruits2** (10): IT'S ONLY GONNA GET YOU HIGH (this moment is an album highlight sorry sorry)

**pastapixal** (10): that intro is magical

**PhoneThePhoenix** (10): a perfect song!! love her vocals and the instrumentals. my first fav on the album.

**plastichaxan** (10): This song made me start being proud of my Virgo rising placement finally thank you Bey

**popularsong** (10): ack another 11 candidate... just a magical experience throughout

**Poydoo** (10): Idk what yall are saying, this is easily the best song on the album

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Hello, I'm a Virgo and I am indeed grooving

**RandomHypnotica** (10): imaging the alternate world where we could put this against 333 and Caprisongs in an astrolgy rate where it would not just sweep

**ReallyCreative** (10): justice for the Zodiac rate

**Roxieloxie** (10): muisc!

**runaway3212** (10): LIKE IMAGINE NOT BEING A VIRGO I BET YOU FEEL SO STUPID

**shipperondeck** (10): as a virgo myself this yearning got me dancin and feeling emotional

**slimboyfriend** (10): ok somebody get me some E. NOW

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): the 'i can be the one that takes you there....on this magic ride, woo! yeah yeah yeah' is so infectious

**UselessTacooo** (10): https://youtu.be/IqGt-CwiMmM

**vexastrae** (10): can i claim this song if im a leo virgo cusp

**wasian-invasion** (10): now i want to learn how to rollerskate for some reason

**modulum83** (9.7): RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW ICED UP BITW DOWN BABY LOCK INR IGHT NOW

**daythreeinmiami** (9.5): Another shock of the Grammys this year was this being snubbed. It‚Äôs time to retire the old men on the Grammys voting thing, p&ty.

**intheaftermath** (9.5): something something "I'm a Leo" "I'm a Percy"

**fairytalehigh** (9.2): this song makes me want to top

**mimins** (9): her vocals are literally insane here

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): so unfair that virgos get this absolute banger of a song meanwhile us geminis have to settle for that horrible madison beer song

**TiltControls** (9): a journey from start to finish

**vayyiqra** (9): Didn't get the hype for this one but it's good for sure üòØ and a longer song is authentic to what dance-pop was like in the era that inspired this album so that's a nice touch too üòØ

**thedoctordances1940** (8.7): this is how you do disco, take notes @ beyonc√©-writing-cuff-it

**Bordersz** (8.5): Unbelievable she is singing like THIS about Jay-Z lmao.

**starla\_** (8.5): Immaculate production, just gorgeous.

**dreamingpastel** (8): Everytime I think the song is almost over, I check Spotify and it's not even halfway over.

**Frajer** (8): the synth sounds like it's about to summon Yoshi

**nick1372** (8): This is placed wrong on the tracklist imo

**jman457** (7.5): my unpopular opinion is that this drags a bit and is kind of overrated

**rfbeirut** (7): controversially im not the biggest fan of the production but the vocals are really giving their all

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): this is so smooth and groovy but is around a minute too long for me

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Funky but not as *unique*-sounding as other tracks

#Bitch its just stars

**nooodisaster** (6): "You're the love of my life" Me deluding myself into liking this song before my Renissance World Tour date.

**Stryxen** (6): good objectively but it doesn‚Äôt really do anything for me and i never choose to listen to it

**Birdseeding** (3): More flitting through the decades. And then it goes massive chipmunk cringe at the end, aaaaaah

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Aaaand just coming up short of the top of the podium we have Cuff It! 

 Cuff It seemed to be a big fan favorite right when it was released. It had the most 70s influence of all the songs on the album (it had NILE RODGERS in writing credits) but it did the 70s perfectly. Beyonce has so much fun on this song and really lets loose on this song. She's not a goddess or anything, she just wants to get some and have good fun. Just when it seemed like this song would go the way of other fan favorite album tracks, Tiktok came in to make one of the easiest dances on the app to this song so that everyone can enjoy it, even the rhythmically challenged. There's no other song in this rate that screams "all stars winner" as much as this one.

**impla77** (10): This song was sitting pretty at the top for much of the rate.. until the last week ballots attacked. Still finishing in a respectable 2nd place, this is probably the epitome of pop disco throwback hits (the hit part being true whether Beyonc√© wants it or not). The other girlies can stop trying (sorry Lizzo) Beyonc√©‚Äôs performance is so electric and dynamic here that I can‚Äôt help getting swept up in ‚Äòfucking up the night‚Äô (disclaimer: I have never fucked up the night, I need to be in bed by 12). Disco pop perfection.

#I WANT IT TO GO HIGHER

**CrimsonROSET** (11): your fave buys a dress when she wants to imply sex, my fave says you‚Äôll see cum in the black lights, we are NOT the same

**DraculaWeekend** (11): Instant classic

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): [me when I hear this song](https://imgur.com/a/XiorP8q)

**hikk** (11): if you think about it the people that are like "this is the most basic song on the album :/ it's not that good" are now the basic people... woah....

**ignitethephoenix** (11): everything about this is so good, her vocals, the energy, the way it transitions into energy‚Ä¶ chefs kiss

**just\_thonking** (11): Can I sit on top of you uwu

**Kayaking11116** (11): I mean come ON ARE YOU HEARING THIS? Genuinely one of my favorite songs of all time

**MasterWizardRyan** (11): she detached her pussy and made it into a usb to upload this song into the world

**masttup** (11): a perfect song. I am in the mood to fuck something up.

**nygiants\_10** (11): I still can't believe how many hooks she fit seamlessly into this song. The "Can I sit on top of you?" line is funny, but also fits so perfectly. I'm so glad this went viral on TikTok, because it's easily my favorite on the album.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): What a banger!!! A very well-deserved 11 here.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): just joyful and perfect

**shhhneak** (11): XO has been dethroned as my favourite Beyonce song. This is she at her very best!! I can‚Äôt find a single flaw with this, it‚Äôs so fun and perfect.

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): better than the whole Harry album

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): Among this album of absolute bangers this is the one that speaks to me the most. Sorry Alien Superstar stans for potentially ruining the results of this rate‚Ä¶

**welcome2thejam** (11): Deserves to be a dance floor classic and the soundtrack to the best nights of your life for years to come

ImADudeDuh: #trying to sit on top of you

**1998tweety** (10): mega bop, the way this would've gone #1 if the era was better planned.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THE NILE: a) Rodgers guitar is brilliant here. b) by Beyonc√© feat. Kendrick Lamar. c) is a river in Egypt.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this should've been her next number one but somehow, the visuals never came, only a rich-paid concert from homophobic Middle East excluding this album did.

**Awkward\_King** (10): god i love cock

**babadork** (10): Along with the country and rock albums, we need an entire funk album.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Subjectively, this is the objective winner of the rate.

**bluehxrizon** (10): songs like this are the reason why popheads exists

**daythreeinmiami** (10): me to my husband when I need to reach the top shelf in the kitchen, ‚Äòcan I sit on top of you? üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è‚Äô

**dreamingpastel** (10): Tiktok was right about latching onto this. It is a whole bop.

**frogaranaman** (10): I love how much of this album boils down to ‚Äúfuck me pls‚Äù

**IIIHenryIII** (10): maybe I just never payed attention to this up until this point but I swear this is the first time I‚Äôve seen an artist do the backing vocals after each line right from the very beginning of the song

**intheaftermath** (10): this is my first full listen to Renaissance (I had limited internet this summer) and wow oh my god??? woah??? no way??? this is insane???

**jackisboredtoday** (10): thinking back to some of the worst days I was having last year and how I nearly burst into tears when this came on because I wished I could hear it in a club. I‚Äôm still convinced hearing it in a club on the right night could singlehandedly fix every problem in my life

**jaztinax** (10): when beyonce says fuck up the night WE‚ÄôRE FUCKING THE FUCK UP OUT OF THAT NIGHT !

**jman457** (10): A career defining hit for Beyonce, despite her doing no promo at all. But seriously, wedding/bar mitzvah dj‚Äôs are gonna be playing this for decades

**jonnl2806** (10): The grove in this is so good it just makes me want to get up and start dancing with a drink in my hand because I don't have a man...

**jsonphile** (10): if Beyonc√© wants to sit on top of me she may

**mimins** (10): does she know that this is a hit? i don't think she knows this is a hit. mrs. knowles???

**modulum83** (10): pure euphoria. if there is justice in this world this song will be culturally immortalized forever 10 years from now in a Shooting Stars-style internet meme

**Nagisoid** (10): Ezra Miller getting arrested every month:

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): if I could give this an 11 alongside Alien Superstar I would

**nick1372** (10): bop!!

**oscarbrierley1** (10): a masterpiece. I've listened to it so many times and it's only gotten better. The obvious hit single from the album.

**passionfruits2** (10): top10 guaranteed for this bop. tiktok usually viralizes the most annoying songs, but they chose the correct one from RENAISSANCE.

**PhoneThePhoenix** (10): another perfect song!!! catchy excellent vocals and instrumentation. euphoric!

**plastichaxan** (10): This song makes me so happy

**popularsong** (10): just such a groovy bop, no wonder its doing so well even without promo

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Blow walked so CUFF IT could run

**ReallyCreative** (10): her music is triggering a lot of people into spiritual awakenings right now. Her music is infiltrating in a HUGE way and she is helping shift timelines

**rfbeirut** (10): already a timeless wedding party song

**runaway3212** (10): LIKE WHY ARE THE OTHER GIRLS EVEN TRYING AT THIS POINT

**seanderlust** (10): i'm such a sucker for this disco groovy production and this is such an excellent deployment of it. this month's rates, the nile rogers stans are eating

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): There's a reason this song blew up the way it did. It's infectious, catchy, and funky. A perfect pop song!

**shipperondeck** (10): NILE RODGERS SLAY!!!

**sufjancaesar** (10): from my first listen this was my fav and i just felt like it was special‚Ä¶ i couldn‚Äôt be happier to see it‚Äôs cultural relevance now!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): would be my 11 if Heated didn't have the best outro of all time

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ok yall no more disco throwback tracks, beyonce just released the best one of all time no one better even try to top it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): BEYONCE! *gunshot* where is the fucking video

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): ok Beyonce you got me

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): vintage Bey at her best. it's a hit for a reason!

**udontwannaknownoel** (10): could've been #1 for 1320 weeks if Bey actually promoted this

**vayyiqra** (10): The guitar is so Nile Rodgers, I love it üòØ

**vexastrae** (10): its funny that beyonce wanted church girl to be the second single bc this song is giving so much second single vibes. ps if this was the wetter remix this would be my 11 (VOTE FOR OOPS! ALL REMIXES NEXT RATE CYCLE)

**slimboyfriend** (9.9): it‚Äôs Cameo it‚Äôs Earth Wind and Fire it‚Äôs Prince it‚Äôs Chic

**Bordersz** (9.5): BUSS IT FOR YOU BAYBEEE

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): this is just soooo exuberantly joyous like how can you not feel great and fun and maybe a bit horny listening to this

**emayzee** (9.5): the perfect successor to the 4 era

**Frajer** (9.5): Sheila E and Nile Rodgers you will always be famous

**MrMoodle** (9.5): The buildup of this song is so so good. The third verse followed by the cuff it section is a career highlight imo. But then suddenly it just flickers out? It‚Äôs fine on the album because of the transition into energy but considered individually it‚Äôs kind of underhwhelming. It forces you to listen to energy and break my soul for it to sound complete. Come to think of it maybe that was the point.

**Poydoo** (9.5): Would've been a 10 if it wasn't for "you Mister Nasty, I'll clean it up"

**TiltControls** (9.5): really grew on me the past couple months. I have no idea how I missed how great this track is

**fairytalehigh** (9.3): she's sexy, she's camp, she's fun, she's everything.

**akanewasright** (9): this is highkey the most basic song on the album, but it‚Äôs still really special and wonderfully and deserves everything it gets (aside from a win over alien superstar)

**horridhendy** (9): This is the beginning of my fave three song transition.

**katycat162534** (9): A perfect song!

**PSSST12** (9): Still don't get the hype of the original but the wetter remix OUTSOLD. Its giving crazy in love fifty shades remix.

**QuaxlyDuck** (9): it's nice but sounds like the most accessible/ordinary disco throwback track on the album, which is probably why it's doing so well on tiktok

**starla\_** (9): if you don't love this, I don't know what to say to you. It's infectious, sexy, and free.

**wasian-invasion** (9): despite beyonce‚Äôs best efforts she finally got a stable hit

**aakar528** (8.5): catchy with a good flow

**Roxieloxie** (8.4): [yeah](https://twitter.com/afrikandondada/status/1625807041024458752?s=46&t=NX_U-qYYFdQWI-9v2m-Zdw)

**bogo** (8): yeah it's good

**moonshxne** (8): straight bop ü™©

#Don't arrest me

**heysoupie** (7.8): i‚Äôm so tired of this song. So. tired. If every (White) person who used this song as a background for videos paid $5 to a Black person‚Äôs GoFundMe or something‚Ä¶we would have some significant wealth redistribution. I do love the bass groove and the brass section tho.

**UselessTacooo** (7): hot take: I don‚Äôt get the hype. Obviously it‚Äôs a good song but something about the chorus feels like a cop out? Idk it just throws me off

**cremeebrulee** (6.7): feels safe for an album that has so much more interesting stuff going on... the horns are good tho

**nooodisaster** (6): Idk how this went viral and at this point I'm afraid to ask

**thedoctordances1940** (4.7): Part of the weakness of this song for me is maybe its position on the album coming after the opening run of incredible slightly darker tracks but also I just really do not care for the sound and I really don't get why this is the track that stood out for so many people. Feel somewhat bad tanking a Beyonc√© frontrunner but at the end of the day I don't think it'll lead to a song I absolutely don't want to win winning unless swifties turn up in an absolutely insane number for this rate

**Stryxen** (3.5): this seems a standout first but now i‚Äôm so familiar with the album entirely this is easily the least interesting song and the first half is incohesive and relies on generic and flat nu-disco-ness. It picks up in the second half which makes it a worthy addition but I don't like this song because of the lethargic slog of the first half

**Birdseeding** (3): God this Jamiroqai-sounding acid jazz retro fluff is aggravating. Complete mystery why this was the second single.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): OUR WINNER! WE ALL CHEERED! 

 And by "we," I mean a lot of people including me. Believe me, this was not an easy journey for this song. Even though it was a fan favorite, it was not a single and it had a controversial sample that some people felt ruined the song a bit. It didn't even get the most 11s in the rate, and it took a while for it to surpass Cuff It's amount of 11s. However, taste always comes through in the end! 

 Everyone knows how I-CON-IC the *UNIQUE!* adlib has become. It's one of the most fun things to yell out in your room/car/$2000+ concert seat. One of my favorite parts of the song is actually the intro sample of [Moonraker - Foremost Poets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb4-oOKIZQ8) which gets you the perfect amount of hype for the song and really kicks off Renaissance in earnest. I'm Too Sexy is one of the most camp dance songs of all time, and using it to sound like a goddess is a crazy idea yet used to absolute perfection here. She sounds like she starts levitating when it starts. I couldn't be happier to have one of my favorite songs of 2022 win the 2022 Ultimate Rate.

**impla77** (10): This was a strong 11 contender for me (so its surprising I was actually rooting for Cuff It to win!). Before listening to this album, I‚Äôd only heard the part of the song interpolating ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Too Sexy‚Äô and I wasn‚Äôt sure about it.. but in the context of the whole song everything works. A transcendent song.

#Superstars of the rate

**1998tweety** (11): I mean come on now. Pure undiluted pussy CUNT. Mother mothered here the way she had to. I'm one of one, I'm number one, I'm the only one was cunt.

**AHSWeeknd** (11): 2 of the 3 artists on this rate have sampled the same song‚Ä¶ idk why I find that interesting. Like, how many other rates has that happened in?

**mimins** (11): pure OPULENCE

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (11): UNIQUE

**nooodisaster** (11): Be stingy, girl! Step on their necks, on their THROATS.

**PhoneThePhoenix** (11): this song is sooo good. just perfect! was super hard to decide what song to give the 11 to but i think this super catchy and great lyrically and good musically and well, unique!

**ReallyCreative** (11): thinking about that one tweet where she put her clit directly on the mic

**shipperondeck** (11): drip intravenous????? GOD

**slimboyfriend** (11): this is like a gay man‚Äôs idea of a diva through the lens of a drag queen personified by an actual pop star who decided to gift everyone with a banger

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): your second reminder that her spelling out U-N-I-Q-U-E and "you and me together, we can make it better" from lemonade mouth - determinate sounds the same

**thedoctordances1940** (11): Absolutely incredible beat during the verses and then an absolutely transcendent hook, yeah, this is one of her best songs

**vayyiqra** (11): Never noticed before how the ending of the song before it transitions into this one üòØ anyway it rules and would be a good winner, I think it sums up the album better than any other track

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this UNIQUE! song made me speechless, but I wish it has an Ariana Grande feature in it.

**avg-vag** (10): if beyonceÃÅ were truly overrated this would sound like a ru paul b-side

**babadork** (10): This is probably my favorite song on the album lyrically.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This would be a pretty boring winner‚Ä¶but not a bad one.

**bogo** (10): yeah it's good

**Bordersz** (10): IM ONE OF ONE

**DaHumanTorch** (10): obligatory UNIQUE!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I'M 1 OF 1

**emayzee** (10): im too much of a spotify girl to use AM but i just KNOW this hits in dolby atmos. THOSE STRINGS

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): put me in the UNIQUE! section pleek.

**frogaranaman** (10): (hands slowly going up from my thighs to above my head, accentuating both my ass and my non-existent breasts) category: sexy bitch, I‚Äôm the bar

**hikk** (10): UNICORNISTHEUNIFORMYOUPUTONWHENYOUPERFORMEYESONYOUWHENYOUPERFORM

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I still remember how before the album dropped some article leaked that executives from her label thought this song was insane, and they were right!!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the way she ended all pop girlies with this song‚Ä¶ (on a side note, she totally sampled I‚Äôm Too Sexy in the chorus melody and no one can say otherwise)

**intheaftermath** (10): the fact that I went through a stereotypical "white person who thinks Beyonce is overrated" phase is criminal. What the hell was I on.

**jasannn** (10): all i can think about when i listen to this song is that fancam of Jean Jacket from NOPE

**jman457** (10): Aquarius‚Äô grove tbh, but also a career highlight

**jonnl2806** (10): UNIQUE (Can't wait to be among the 20 others with the same comment)

**jsonphile** (10): okay I‚Äôd like this song more if it was actually about a literal alien who enters into American idol and ends up being the fan favorite but only gets second and learns that there‚Äôs more to life than winning because she now has people who love and support her and helped her find her true self

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): cunt cunt cunt

**masttup** (10): this would have been my 11 if not for the use of the word unicorn

**Nagisoid** (10): Cue the Princess Diana fancams

**passionfruits2** (10): ALL MEMES ASIDE. BEYONC√â IS TRANSCENDENTAL. BEYONC√â OVERCOMES ALL. FROM DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE TO THE GIFT, BEYONC√â PUTS SOUL INTO IT. POP? R&B? HIP-HOP? DANCE? no. BEYONC√â.

**pastapixal** (10): this song really is perfect

**plastichaxan** (10): This has too many layers for me to comment on just one I‚Äôll just wait to see the Unique edits

**poemforsmallthings** (10): herstory

**popularsong** (10): ack it was hard not to give this 11. UNIQUE! THATS WHAT YOU ARE

**Poydoo** (10): "Unique" doesn't even sound like a word anymore lol

**PSSST12** (10): AN INSTANT CLASSIC HOT DAMN.  Would be my first candidate for 11 if My third eye didn't open with Virgo's Groove

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): this is what ARTPOP wishes it was. Bring on pop music's space age Bey!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I will never forgive rona for that fucking rotten to the core mashup

**Roxieloxie** (10): I took a break from this song cause i was overplaying it a bit but no its still the best song ever kinda!

**runaway3212** (10): UNIQUE

**seanderlust** (10): THE BALLROOM SHOUTOUTS beyonce knows her references. i really love this album because it pays homage to iconic LGBTQ cultural elements while maintaining the pro-black affirmations of bey's prior albums

**shhhneak** (10): I‚Äôm betting this is going to be the highest rated song with a man in this rate.

**Stryxen** (10): [unique comment] and also this can win

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this took a while to grow on me but when it finally did DAMN

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): this song is about Samara from Mass Effect 2

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): one of her best songs. the outro gives me chills every time

**UselessTacooo** (10): If she doesn‚Äôt open the tour with this song I will cry

**wasian-invasion** (10): everyday i find new 2 syllable words to replace the Unique! to sing to my cats (i.e. Kitty! That‚Äôs what you are!)

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): the fact that the "i'm too sexy" sample is not just sexier than any contemporary "i'm too sexy" sample but also "i'm too sexy" itself

**TiltControls** (9.5): I was confused why Too Sexy keeps being used in samples, as if there's some unseen cosmic force guiding major celebrities to continue its presence in mainstream music, but those worries faded the second hearing this song

**udontwannaknownoel** (9.4): Beyonc√© actually invented uniqueness with this song everyone used to be the exact same

**bluehxrizon** (9): i never would've predicted I'm Too Sexy having multiple pop culture moments post 2010

**horridhendy** (9): Please do not be alarmed. Remain Calm. Do not attempt to give this song a low score

**Kayaking11116** (9): this song lowkey makes me ascend

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): UNIQUE! Iconic banger right there.

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): Didn't like it at first (blasphemy!), but it's grown on me immensely. Her voice in the bridge is just perfection.

**vexastrae** (9): shoutout to the moonraker sample. UNIQUE!

**katycat162534** (8.6): UNIQUE!

**moonshxne** (8.3): I know it's part of what makes this iconique, but I feel like it's the interpolation that's preventing this from claiming a 10 from me

**aakar528** (8): bop (banger intro btw)

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): the real alien superstar is the last Timelord, the Doctor

**nick1372** (8): A great song, layered with meaning while still being a bop. Should never have been a single, though. IDK what her team was thinking, it's not easily digestible enough for radio play.

**rfbeirut** (8): gives Elektra Evangelista but the backing vocals give Glee

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): look im sorry i tried to get used to it but that im too sexy interpolation in the chorus kinda ruins this for me. like the rest of the song is so amazing but then here comes in that stupid melody that never sounds good no matter who‚Äôs singing it im sorry beyonce you can not pull it off

**Uberpigeon** (8): beyonce u will never be juno birch

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Sorry I‚Äôm not a complete ‚ÄúYOO-NIQUE‚Äù simp like the rest of y‚Äôall

**welcome2thejam** (8): If this doesn't get you floating up in a beam of light you're listening to it wrong

**modulum83** (7.6): WE NEED A TOTAL AND COMPLETE SHUTDOWN ON POP STARS SAMPLING I‚ÄôM TOO SEXY UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON

**MrMoodle** (7.5): WHY are mainstream artists so obsessed with I‚Äôm too sexy. What the fuck are these people seeing in this song that I don‚Äôt.

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): I know people love this, but for me it's just good not great.

**heysoupie** (7.4): I feel like I‚Äôd like this better if it wasn‚Äôt infused with like‚Ä¶male gaze-ness? It‚Äôs fine tho. I wish I could unhear the Right Said Fred interpolation; I think it's unforgivably corny.

**Awkward\_King** (7): https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a2/5a/eb/a25aeb8cfede9d78529f71ea0f95be65.jpg

#Gonna be UNIQUE and give this a bad score

**starla\_** (6.5): I don't really get the hype for this track. It's okay but the third song in a row that's like "I'm amazing and incredible" which is fine but I think maybe would work better later in the tracklist? I like the outro a lot, though.

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): always dreamed of Paper Planes but the reality was The Halloween Puppet Show

**FlavaSavaVandal** (3): thank you for giving me the courage to score this song so low hosts

ImADudeDuh: # RENAISSANCE

---

**Overall Average**: 8.641 **// Average Controversy:** 1.455

---

ImADudeDuh: Is this album good enough to be rated the SIXTH BEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME? Honestly, it kinda is. This album is, for me, para mi, the culmination of so many different elements of pop music that I absolutely adore. Dance music, Disco, Beyonce, being a gay ass bitch. I can't help but adore this front to back (ok maybe 2nd song to back).

impla77: The first time I listened to this was in a dingy station, having just missed the train due to overpacking my bag, but from the first song I was transported to a completely different place, a place where I‚Äôm that girl (but Beyonc√© is cooler than me, obvs). This album is a complete listening experience- not only are the individual tracks amazing on their own, but listening to the whole album gives me the same feeling of satisfaction as when a jigsaw puzzle finally comes together, everything is so seamless yet dynamic. No one in their right mind could excuse this of getting stale. What impresses me most is though the lush instrumentation and layers, Beyonc√©‚Äôs vocals and presence are consistently standouts. She‚Äôs right- she is UNIQUE. Bring on act ii!

=====

ImADudeDuh: **amr** (10.063): no comments cos this album was my favorite thing last year and I can't really put into words how much I love each song but I'll attempt to, w tears in my eyes, sum it up poorly now and say that is this is exactly what any artist should strive for when wanting to be political, especially for someone like beyonc√© who gets a lot of shit for preaching from that high. a beautiful tribute crafted w the utmost care and attention to detail I honestly couldn't believe my ears after my very first listen (and I waited too!) with enough of herself in it that it doesn't veer into cosplay territory. a real testament to how far reaching and all encompassing black lgbt influence is on the culture

**AHSWeeknd** (10.063): it‚Äôs so amazing that Beyonc√© decided to make an album that doesn‚Äôt have any videos. So innovative!

**plastichaxan** (10.063): This is THE album of 2022 for me. Anthems through and through, every track just gives me that buzz, Beyonc√© has never really missed for me but between this and Lemonade she has only been excelling like‚Ä¶ That woman is perfect

**DirtyRat583** (10.063): notice how renaissance is the oldest of all the albums? its because she invented music everyone say gracias mami

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10.063): My justification for giving this album a perfect score was my long AF essay on Renaissance for popheads lmao, I said everything I wanted to say there :)

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9.969): This might be Beyonc√©‚Äôs best album. There is not a single weak track on here, it‚Äôs so catchy, endlessly quotable. It is the entire package and should be definitive proof that Beyonc√© is one of the greatest artists ever.

**throwaway-7650** (9.813): the way this album doesn't even have my 11... insane

**babadork** (9.813): I lost track of how many songs I considered giving my 11 to while working on this rate. I kept resenting having to even listen to the other albums.

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.719): absolutely one of the best albums of the year!

**akanewasright** (9.688): I mean‚Ä¶ What do you want me to say? It‚Äôs the perfect to dance music and its black and queer origins

**beyzxzhen** (9.688): this album is a beautiful fucking masterpiece. truly not a song on here that I don't love im sorry. it's just perfect

**avg-vag** (9.563): 9.53125 this is such a beautiful piece of art it's humbling

**vayyiqra** (9.500): Having tried to get into Bey before and not finding much success, this album really blew me away. One of the best albums of the year, best dance-pop albums of the 2010s as well, and a great throwback to the era of early 90s house music that we were too young to be around for (yes, even me) but which gave us a lot of great music. Oceans of ink have already been spilled about this album so I'll leave it there, but it was quite an ambitious project and she nailed everything it was going for here. üòØ

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.463): never did i ever think Bey could top my emotional connection to 4 but she finally did it

**shipperondeck** (9.344): this album helped me clean out my entire closet in a night thank u beyonce

**bogo** (9.313): yeah it's good

**1998tweety** (9.281): my aoty for 2022, Beyonc√© did what needed to be done.

**fairytalehigh** (9.231): my wet dream vision of a beyonce album.

**just\_thonking** (9.188): Hey queen! Girl you have done it again. Constantly raising the bar for us all and doing it flawlessly. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm surprised but I know who you are. I‚Äôve seen it up close and personal. Girl you make me so proud.

**apatel27** (9.188): Outside how good every song is, the transitions just take the whole album to the next level. It's an album in the best way and yet every single song still stands out by itself

**vexastrae** (9.156): i have been replaying this album nonstop since it first came out, its literally so addictive that you cant just play one song and leave it at that, the seamlessly produced transitions between a lot of the songs in this motivate you to listen to the other tracks, all of which are amazing in their own way! its a beautiful ode and homage to queer music such as house and ballroom, incorporating multiple flavors of dance music in a way that keeps you guessing and leaving you wanting more; this is MY album of the year and the grammys committee should retire NOW

**MasterWizardRyan** (9.144): my 2022 aoty, i really tried to not give every song a 9+ but she pressed the slay button on every song aggressively

**musical\_pyn** (9.031): maybe not my *favorite* album of 2022 but probably the objectively *best* album released last year

**slimboyfriend** (9.031): I know my album average for this won‚Äôt come out above a 9.0, but this is like 9-10/10 material

**IIIHenryIII** (9.000): the way the transitions on this album work is out of this world. I tried playing some of these songs by themselves and some of them don‚Äôt work at all for me, but in the context of the album I feel like they‚Äôre flawless. This sure is an album with capital A. One of my favorites from last year.

**shhhneak** (8.988): This is the Elden Ring of music in 2022. Nothing was going to beat her, and although it wasn‚Äôt my personal AOTY (2nd, I‚Äôm not a monster) it is absolutely deserved. If it loses this rate I‚Äôll be shocked. And when she gives us the visuals in honour of winning a reddit rate? >>>>>

**bulforster** (8.969): instant classic, what else is there to say

**pastapixal** (8.956): 10s across the board!!!

**wasian-invasion** (8.938): UNIQUE! That's what she is. Most impressive album of the year, i feel like ive been a little harsh on some of these songs just because there's so many highlights its a bit hard for the others to stand out. i am so ready to spend way more than i should to see her live

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8.938): easily my favorite album off this ultimate rate, but with no visuals, it's disappointing.

**nt96** (8.938): an album chock full of bops and a carefully crafted homage to the black artists that paved the way before her. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been my pre-college years since she‚Äôs put out an album, but the wait was worth it.

**frogaranaman** (8.938): visuals. music video. Dubai https://reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/10iwrt0/_/j5igoyw/?context=1

**Frajer** (8.906): I love how Bey just does whatever the fuck she wants at her own pace

**sufjancaesar** (8.844): To keep it short, RENAISSANCE is pulsating with fun, energy, freedom, maximalism, joy and LIFE. It forcefully flows through you and carries an invigorating and infectious spirit that‚Äôs hard to deny. It‚Äôs united so many black and queer people across the world through shared passion for dance, release and, most importantly, liberated life.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.844): From front to back (with one exception) this album is fantastic and it might be my favourite of hers so far. In a year where I was disappointed by so many popheads faves, mainstream or more sub-fave level, Beyonc√© more than delivered and I'm so glad she did

**Mudkip1** (8.813): absolute classic period pooh

**lexiaredery** (8.750): BeyonceÃÅ gets so much love, I always feel a little skeptical that it isn't warranted, but this album totally delivered. Easily album of the year. The energy and production throughout is incredible. It's so much fun to listen to, with the seamless transitions and amazing quality of every track.

**jman457** (8.688): Like this may be my personal favorite Beyonce album, even if I think Lemonade is her Magnum opus. Its just bops on bops on bops

**oscarbrierley1** (8.688): try not to say Mother challenge (impossible). I'm trying to not be biased towards this album, but I can't. It's slays too hard.

**starla\_** (8.656): One thing I respect so much about Beyonce is that she never half-arses anything. If she does something she DOES IT. This house music, ballroom, queer homage is so well executed, while still being very Beyonce.

**horridhendy** (8.625): This album is a masterpiece. I'll admit that it took me a few listens, dance/house music isn't my usual genre but when it clicked, I was obsessed. The transitions really make it next level. It's experimental, it's daring and it feels like a real passion project. It's one of those albums that you put on start to finish because the whole thing is an experience. If you gave me three 11s then this album would‚Äôve got them all. The best album in the rate by far and my second favourite album of 2022 (Preacher's Daughter was number one if you're curious)

**modulum83** (8.475): look - sure, this is the music equivalent of oscar bait. but sometimes a big budget and a great cast and a bunch of loving homages can go a long, long way. absurd amounts of stimulation in this album, packed with Music. i remain skeptical about beyonce's *cred* with being a Gay Icon and a lot of what this album does feels like pandering, but when there is this much going on it's hard to not get distracted from those philosophical questions. why would you care? renaissance exists only to do one thing: entertain.

**dreamingpastel** (8.469): What an album! What a vibe!

**MassiveThief** (8.438): she literally served cunt and died (i wrote this before the tour announcement and am too stubborn to delete)

**nick1372** (8.438): dude it's Renaissance by Beyonce what else can I say

**TiltControls** (8.375): Poor Maggie Rogers never stood a chance that day

**jasannn** (8.350): As my first Beyonc√© album listening from front to back (tragic, I know), this sets the bar super high. The production and transitions are super clean and the album is incredibly tight-knit. You can tell how much time and effort was put into this album, and it pays off.

ImADudeDuh: 

**welcome2thejam** (8.313): A great dance album by a true standout presence. Probably hits better on a night out and not a random Thursday, but we roll the dice we're given

**Bordersz** (8.281): In my mind this won AOTY.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.250): I listened to this once the whole way through when it came out and was like ‚Äúcool!‚Äù So now that I get to analyze this more in depth I think I finally realize why everyone loves it, why some think this is one of the best tracks of her career. No, it‚Äôll never be Lemonade, for the sole reason that Lemonade had a *point*. Of course Lemonade will always be her critical peak since it had an overarching moral and political message. But sometimes albums that exist for the sole reason of having fun can be amazing too! This one certainly is! And it goes above and beyond in executing its own message: getting this mothafucka litty!

**jsonphile** (8.219): I like this album, but it‚Äôs one that I respect a lot more than I personally enjoy. Not that it‚Äôs not good, it obviously is, but I‚Äôm just not as into some of these dance/house sounds. Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, I still was 100% hoping this would win AOTY at the Grammys because duh what else would you give it to?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8.175): ended picasso or whoever idk

**moonshxne** (8.163): The sound design on this is just stunning, and now I've just confirmed once and for all that there are no duds on here for me, and yet I still feel like I don't quite "get it"? Like, it's entirely possible that my overall average here is higher than mine for *SOS*, but in my heart I prefer that album considerably more; I just don't quite **love** any of the songs on here. That said, it is consistently at least very, very solid -- I have a strong feeling this is going to be one of the most highly-rated albums on the sub, and I've certainly contributed to that. üòÑ

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.125): simply a great album

**mimins** (8.094): such a fun album sure wish we had some visuals to go with it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.094): girl what do you want me to say. its a beyonce album of course its good.

**Nagisoid** (8.063): This is a really good house and pop album, there was a lot of hype but most of it was warranted. I do believe there are some few low points in the album like the opener and ENERGY, but that's chalked up mostly to the second half being much more solid than the first half, at least to me. Some people may have soured on the album's message of queer empowerment and celebration due to her performing in Dubai, but honestly, was anyone surprised? Bey's a billionaire after all and she holds that mindset, it was to be expected. As a person who doesn't care much about visuals I don't have much to complain about other than the production feeling a little uneven at times and the features aside from Grace Jones not adding much. I enjoyed this album the most out of every other album in this rate, it has no straight up bad song other than I'M THAT GIRL unlike the other albums which have lots of filler.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.063): a nerd on rym voted Plunderphonics on this as a genre lmao i cant

**jaztinax** (7.988): not my favorite beyonce album, but god i respect the hell out of the concept of this album and the way it‚Äôs put together

**nooodisaster** (7.906): Grew and grew and grew... Bey might have actually been a genius for scrapping those visuals, the music spoke for itself.

**MToms** (7.638): This is an undeniably great album. Very experimental, at times it works and at times it's jarring. Overall, I prefer the melodic parts over the talk-rap parts and that lowers some of her scores for me. However, I get the feeling most of these songs are growers and you get to love each quirky bit.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (7.469): You ever think about Silk Chiffon by Muna featuring Phoebe Bridgers, and how Phoebe does not fit on the song at all because it‚Äôs Phoebe Bridgers on a Muna song, but she so desperately wants to. That‚Äôs kinda how I feel with RENAISSANCE, it‚Äôs a party I was invited to and went to, everyone else feels like they are having the time of their lives and I‚Äôm just not outside of a few moments. It isn‚Äôt because I hate the party or the host or feel the host is doing anything wrong, I‚Äôm just not all that impressed by opulent extravagance. and I just don‚Äôt have that much fun listening to RENAISSANCE outside of Church Girl, Virgo‚Äôs Groove, THIQUE, Pure/Honey and Summer Renaissance. And there are a few reasons here and there. The lack of an emotional throughline in RENAISSANCE makes it hard for me to come back as an album, I think all artists who present themselves as these ultra powerful, unstoppable icons aren‚Äôt interesting. And I‚Äôm missing the stakes and risks that Lemonade took, and the humanity Beyonc√© gave those songs.. I mean sure it has bangers, and I do love some classic disco, and Beyonc√© is definitely a strong performer and presence but where is the emotional sticking point? And I do wish I liked this a lot more, like how Phoebe wants to fit in and kiss girls on a night out on Silk Chiffon as easily as Muna, but I just don‚Äôt fit. Sorry

**dream\_fighter2018** (7.156): originally nothing from this album really stuck with me, but I‚Äôve come around on it. Solid album, especially the run from Cuff It to Church Girl. I‚Äôm personally very interested to see how this one ages

**Lilacly\_Adily** (6.556): I rated this album quite low overall but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs actually fantastic to dance to at a club night when played all the way through. I just found some songs had me more like [this at times](https://64.media.tumblr.com/70a3d7406da0a799d6efd712b0683af3/d3e8c828acda30ef-cb/s500x750/25ec095c64bf453a2b15320b161e4f4c6c021dfe.gif) rather than fully [bopping](https://i.gifer.com/origin/6e/6eb2755b8e07a276eae9df60ef5a36fa_w200.gif) away

**Around-Town** (6.375): I really loved this album. I came in only having listened to Cuff It, and didn't think the album would be that good, but damn it's fire. One of those albums that are greater than the sum of its parts.

**Birdseeding** (5.938): 8 This truly surprised me, and grew to become my favourite of this bunch. Interesting choices and deep references throughout, and a cohesive, almost conceptual album that bears repeated listens.

**Song Stats**

* With 25 11's **VIRGO'S GROOVE** becomes the 16th most 11'd song on Popheads. It ties Jessie Ware - Spotlight and Talking Heads - Once in a Lifetime in this stat
* **Vigilante Shit** becomes the 19th lowest rated song of all time on the sub. It places right below LMFAO's Sexy and I Know It and right above Bad Blood by some random flop I assume.
* **Vigilante Shit** also takes 2nd place for song with the most 0's with 47
 * It is only passed by Dua Lipa's Boys Will Be Boys at 58
* **Vigilante Shit** also gets on the leaderboard for 0 magnets by picking up 27.01% of the 0's in the rate. This puts it in 8th overall for this stat
* In some rare good news for Taylor, **Karma** winning songeniality gives her a 6th songeniality win. Halsey is the only artist even somewhat close to her with 4 wins.
 * Her previous songenialities are for All Too Well, Better Than Revenge, Death By A Thousand Cuts, King Of My Heart, and Out of the Woods (and a half point for Style).

**Other Artist Stats**

* With her 6th rate win (5th) solo, **Beyonc√©** still holds atop the 'most rate wins' stat for the sub. Now if 2nd place wants to even tie her they would need two more rate wins (this applies to Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Kanye West, and The Weeknd who are all tied with 4)
* **Phoebe Bridgers** rises enough to enter the top 10 with her feature on SZA's Ghost in the Machine. She knocks down Curtis Mayfield (now 10th) and Stevie Wonder (11th)
* **Beyonc√©** is now the artist with the 2nd most amount of songs rated on the sub with 109 (previously 7th). She passes Carly, Ariana, Gaga, Britney, and Lana.
 * **Taylor** would still be in 1st for this stat even if she wasn't in this rate, and despite what day 3 might make you believe, she was. Her lead in first grows with us now rating 166 songs from her.
* **Beyonc√©** also ties Ariana Grande for most rate appearances, with each appearing in 22 rates.
 * **Taylor** isn't far behind, showing up in 21 different rates (which ties her with Charli XCX, Nicki Minaj, and The Weeknd)
* **Taylor** gets her 4th rate loss, putting her in a tie for 2nd with Selena Gomez, Panic! At The Disco, and Halsey. In first is still Madonna sitting at 5 losses.
* By picking up 110 11's in this rate, **Beyonc√©** moves up the 'most 11's list' from 8th into 3rd place.
 * She sits only behind Taylor (1st) and Carly (2nd)
* **Taylor** passes the 400 mark for 0's and sits easily in first (though that was already true before this rate). For context the no other artist has passed 150 0's yet.
 * **Lana Del Rey** also moves up in this stat and is now tied in 9th with Selena Gomez at 93, putting her on the leaderboard and knocking Panic! At the Disco off.

**Stats for albums titles in all caps**

* RENAISSANCE becomes the 2nd album to completely sweep the top 4 of a rate, after Paramore's Brand New Eyes in Emo Rate 1.5
* RENAISSANCE becomes the 6th highest rated album on the sub! It sits just out of reach of the top 5 by a 0.007 average difference
* By getting 63.2% of the rate's 11's, RENAISSANCE becomes the album with the 3rd highest 11 dominance in a rate!
 * It is only beaten by Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (64.3%) and One Direction's FOUR (65.8%)
* RENAISSANCE becomes one of the few albums to completely avoid day 1 elimination.
 * Previous albums that have done this include Lil Nas X - MONTERO, Janet Jackson - Rhythm Nation 1814 (and some others I'm definitely forgetting)
* RENAISSANCE had the longest streak of eliminations for both (1) not losing a song and (2) not losing her first song. I'M THAT GIRL survived 33 eliminations before it became the first song cut on RENAISSANCE
 * The first stat was previously held by The Neighbourhood who went 30 eliminations between their 2nd highest song (Afraid - 35th) and the highest song (Sweater Weather - 4th)
 * The second stat was previously held by Dua Lipa's self titled album, which survived 20 eliminations before she lost her first song (Garden - 31st)

**Stats for albums that start with 'Mid' and end with 'nights'**

Let's talk about Midnights

* Midnights becomes the 6th lowest rated album of all time (this is only the main + 3 am tracks, so no Hit Different. Though if it were included it'd still be in the same spot, just with a slightly higher average)
 * Surprisingly enough, it's not the lowest rated album we've had from Taylor as 1989 got a lower average the very first time we rated it (and anything for that matter)
 * The other albums lower than it include Meet The Vamps, Bangerz, Luv Is Rage 2, and Teenage Dream [1st rate].
* With Would've, Could've, Should've leaving in 14th place, Midnights takes the record for earliest exit in a 3 album rate.
 * Previously the record was jointly held by Kylie Minogue and D'Angelo who had their highest placing songs go out in 10th (Magic and The Charade respectively)
 * In general the record for earliest exit is still set by Drake's Views, which had its highest song leave in 25th (Hotline Bling)
* Midnights becomes the 2nd most controversial album rated on the sub with an average 2.447 controversy across its songs
 * Only Panic! At The Disco's Death of Bachelor has a higher average controversy
 * Taylor becomes the only artist with 3 albums in the most controversial albums top 10 with Reputation (4th) and Red (9th) also sitting on the list
* By getting 56.9% of the 0's in the rate, Midnights takes first for highest 0 split in a rate! It becomes the first album to get more than 50% of the 0's in a rate.
  * The previous record holder was Rihanna's Talk That Talk at 47.6%
 * She also becomes the only artist with 3 albums on this list with Reputation (5th) and 1989 - Rerate (9th)
* With 4.831 separating the top rated song (Would've Could've Should've) with the bottom (Vigilante Shit), Midnights takes a spot on the leaderboard for biggest album score gap! 
* Midnights takes the record for 'longest starting elimination run' with her losing 13 songs before SZA lost her 1st
 * Previously the record was held by Kylie Minogue - DISCO and Linkin Park - Hybrid Theory who both lost 8 before someone else lost their first track.

TragicKingdom1: I checked the stats on previous ultimate rates and the next highest average for a main pop girl in one of them is Future Nostalgia with a 7.726 üíÄ Renaissance was as much of an outlier as Midnights huh
