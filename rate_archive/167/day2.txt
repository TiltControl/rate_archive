COCKHAMPTON_: We lie awake in love and in fear, in turmoil and in tears. We stare at walls and drink until they speak back. We twist in our self-made cages and pray that we aren't — right this minute — about to make some fateful life-altering mistake.



This is a collection of music written in the middle of the night, a journey through terrors and sweet dreams. The floors we pace and the demons we face. For all of us who have tossed and turned and decided to keep the lanterns lit and go searching — hoping that just maybe, when the clock strikes twelve... we'll meet ourselves.



Midnights, the story of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life, will be out on Day 2.

**impla77** (9): This song just sneaks into Day 2! I must admit I love the melodrama. Also I kept getting recommended Hunger Games amvs for this song and that made me feel the fantasy lol.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Oooo not Taylor being the first song out on Day 2 as well, she can't take a break ever huh? 

Well, this is a nice placement for the song since my score couldn't be closer to the average. This song has some nice parts, especially the "somewhere in the haze" part, but outside of them? It's just fine. I thought we taught Taylor to stop talking about wars when she did Hoax.

---

#Profiteers

**AHSWeeknd** (10): if you get it, you get it. period.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): it could've replaced Rioting Turd off the album and it's automatically decent at least.

**jman457** (10): This is so good, idk Im mid on both the National and Taylor, but when they come together; magic happens.

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): that one twitter user who keeps on retweeting how this song is excellent is real

**runaway3212** (10): I like knowing that taylor too can sometimes be mean as fuck without any cause

**seanderlust** (10): (cut to that one clip from Severance of adam scott explaining that they used to call wwi the great war because there hadn't been a world war two yet)

**vayyiqra** (10): 😌 Love the tone of the synth on this, it sounds like one I heard somewhere in my childhood but can't remember where 😌

**1998tweety** (9): the weird "uh-huh" in the chorus takes me out 😭

**avg-vag** (9): this track is probably overrated but it’s such sweet relief after the standard runtime

**IIIHenryIII** (9): as great as the drums sound on this track they got nothing on ME!

**Kayaking11116** (9): the best song on the album fr, the rest of the songs wish they were her

**modulum83** (9): i have to admire when an artist gets an incredibly tortured metaphor in their head and completely commits to it to the very end

**Nagisoid** (9): Mentioning Crimson and Clover guarantees a collapse; see this song and Venice Bitch

**nick1372** (9): Taylor why didn't you just give us Evermore part 2

**udontwannaknownoel** (9): Ended world peace

**starla\_** (8.5): oh thank god Aaron Dessner is here

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): thank you aaron dessner this production is so much brighter and good!

**FlavaSavaVandal** (8): yeah I might not survive the great war popheads has declared on Midnights

**horridhendy** (8): I like this song, it's catchy but the war metaphors are a little heavy handed at times.

**jsonphile** (8): wow it’s incredible how much better the album gets once we get to the bonus tracks

**masttup** (8): the Great War is referring to the time I lost my wallet and when I went to the DMV they played me! and then you need to calm down back to back, I’m a veteran

**ReallyCreative** (8): she really has no idea which songs to put on an album huh

**Shelly\_AO29** (8): Great song. Love the production, the chorus is a highlight.

**TiltControls** (8): Oh look it's the part of the album where things pick up - the songs that weren't on it initially!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): nothing *too* special about this song but it has a catchy hook and a timeless feel to it

**Treecoh** (8): its kinda boring but the bridge is a 10

**thedoctordances1940** (7.7): omg it's the first song without jack and it's already just better than anything that came before it

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): this would be top 2 on the standard

**nt96** (7.5): it won the battle at least

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Hearing some Dessner is refreshing but yeah this isn’t the best production he’s done for Taylor by a longshot.

**daythreeinmiami** (7): What it’s like to get tickets to a ticket to the US leg of the Era’s tour. (hoping it’s not like that for the Australian leg lel pls don’t let it be).

#What is it good for? Absolutely nothing.

**fairytalehigh** (7): a death cab homage that would've sounded better coming from death cab

**intheaftermath** (7): definitely an improvement from the main album but I would not say it's Taylor's best

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): it’s fine.

**Poydoo** (7): I just realized this song sounds almost exactly the same as YOYOK

**rfbeirut** (7): i like the tiktok part

**Stryxen** (7): = being a beach house stan in indieheads ultimate

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): RIP Franz Ferdinand, you will always be famous </3

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): this is literally just a song about Pearl

**akanewasright** (6.5): I’m so mad, this is reminding me of another song and I can’t place what

**dream\_fighter2018** (6.5): this is nice but it does drag along. The bridge is good, Taylor knows how to do a good bridge.

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): remember when kendrick compared arguing over backup dancers to the iraq war on the bad blood remix

**PhoneThePhoenix** (6.4): it's nice!

**mimins** (6): don't care for the chorus but i like the bridge plus verses

**oscarbrierley1** (6): very lana lyrically, but sonically I'm bored

**shhhneak** (6): Don’t mind this but I’m going to completely forget it before I finish typing this sentence.

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): I can see future undergrads in sociology studying about General Swift's Cybersiege of Ticketmaster

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I feel like Taylor's already made like 3 songs that sound exactly like this

**xqra** (5.7): Well-written and a good vocal performance for sure, I just don't like the melody all that much

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): again, its fine. which kind of describes the whole album

**aakar528** (5): decent

**CrimsonROSET** (5): TAYLOR SWIFT WAR CRIMINAL! Feels so good to say that.

**popularsong** (5): loooove how it builds up around 2 min mark. thought the chorus was underwhelming at first but as the song progresses, it really lodges itself in your head

**QuaxlyDuck** (5): can these 3AM tracks please be a bonus rate, Swifties? You really didn't have to make us listen to the deluxe version for just the Taylor album

**heysoupie** (4.6): i feel like veterans would not approve of this song somehow

**bogo** (4): yeah this one's just boring

**DevilsOfLoudun** (4): This is so cringe I'm shocked people love it

**frogaranaman** (4): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War

**MassiveThief** (4): kinda sounds like a million other songs on this album

**shipperondeck** (4): not the uh huhs

**jonnl2806** (3): I know it's a bonus track but this is bad

**passionfruits2** (3): the single good part for me is when she says "Great War" bc the entonation tickles me brain

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): somehow i highly doubt taylor swift personally lived through world war i

**amr** (2): just don't know why U'd name a song this and then serve squabble at best she really is the gdt of pop music

**nooodisaster** (2): I always just panic skip this. Yeah, I remember why.

**Uberpigeon** (2): i think its disgusting to make light of what our brave soldiers of world war 1 went through.

**cremeebrulee** (1): there's no way being fwb with a d-list actor was this dramatic

**ImADudeDuh** (6): This intro is a very nice addition to SOS, but it's the most intro-y intro in the rate (note, I did not call it the worst intro). It's a nice song and has some fun parts, but overall I don't really see a reason to listen to this unless I'm listening to the album front-to-back. "I'm horny like suck these" is a damn mood tho.

**impla77** (5.7): This is definitely an intro track, but it has some cute lines in it

---

#Titanic at the Box Office

**AHSWeeknd** (10): watch flopheads treat this as an interlude and make it a day 1 out

**amr** (10): we need kirk franklin on this joint

**Awkward\_King** (10): those opening bleeps and shots then jumping into sza brag-rapping more confidently than we've ever heard on a track before, such a stark change from supermodel opening ctrl.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): starts off strong! great sample, and SZA serving

**horridhendy** (10): Such a great way to kick off the album.

**lipe18090** (10): I have no idea why I love this song as much as I do

**RandomHypnotica** (10): [coming back snatched like Bandit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il7flEwl-XY)

**ReallyCreative** (10): DAMN RIGHT I’M THE ONE

**rfbeirut** (10): the best opener of the 3 albums

**throwaway-7650** (10): :

**shipperondeck** (9.6): so daring like TOUCH ME

**starla\_** (9.5): this has no business being so good, it's literally an intro

**fairytalehigh** (9.2): "i'm horny like suck these" relatable queen!!!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Ugh it may be bullshit but it sure does sound good over an instrumental.

**cremeebrulee** (9): "i talk bullshit a lot" wbk

**jaztinax** (9): it’s the admitting that she has a bbl for me

**masttup** (9): the start of this songs always makes me think something is wrong with my car

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): SZA has BARS don’t play with my girl!

**oscarbrierley1** (9): yasss listen sample.

**emayzee** (8.7): i love me a choir

**jonnl2806** (8.5): "So classic, that ass so fat, it look natural, it's not"

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): honestly all the album openers on this rate slap

**jman457** (8.3): idk im a slut for a child’s chorus

**bluehxrizon** (8): "that ass look so fat it look natural, its not" shes mother

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): the distorted sample is a great foundation

**CrimsonROSET** (8): she’s been thinking about making a comeback…

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): there’s a skill behind a good intro

**jasannn** (8): SUCK THESE

**jsonphile** (8): “I’m horny like suck these” me too SZA me too

**modulum83** (8): it was fire when drake sampled it it’s still fire now

**nick1372** (8): A intro song has to be unique to stand out, and SOS does that soo well

**passionfruits2** (8): she's mutha!

**PhoneThePhoenix** (8): so good lyrically

**plastichaxan** (8): She ate that

**Shelly\_AO29** (8): Great intro to the album. LOVE the transition to Kill Bill.

**UselessTacooo** (8): how can an album opener be so yass???

**vexastrae** (8): shes serving on this verse idc idc!

**udontwannaknownoel** (7.9): Outsampled our favorite lesbian

**heysoupie** (7.8): really sets the mood for the album’s chaos, doesn’t it?

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): Brady and KD comparisons back to back??? is this her iconic villain era

**seanderlust** (7.5): "i talk bullshit a lot" me making rate comments

**moonshxne** (7.2): I know this isn't the album in the rate with the transitions, but can I just say I really like how some of the sound effects (especially the gunshot at the beginning, mirrored with cocking the gun near the end) foreshadows and seamlessly transitions us into "Kill Bill"? Otherwise, it's mostly a cute sampler of what's to come.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): an okay opening track, IMO.

**daythreeinmiami** (7): I have not actually heard this album yet thanks to life, so I’m so excited to listen to this album finally as I love SZA. This intro is criminally short and if this is just a snippet then I’m so darn excited.

**frogaranaman** (7): love how with this album begins with the SOS morse code then she just says “need someone to fuck me hard”

**intheaftermath** (7): probably the strongest opening track of any of the albums here

**runaway3212** (7): this is cute

#Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean

**thedoctordances1940** (7): I mean it's an intro track so I was never gonna give it a 10 but it's still very good for what it is

**Kayaking11116** (6.5): it's cute it's fun, not much to say

**nooodisaster** (6.5): and i tried and tried to say what's on my mind- you should have known oh! Now I'm done believing you!! You dont know what I'm feeling. I'm more than what-

**1998tweety** (6): shes an alright opener

**Nagisoid** (6): SOS is kinda like the cunty counterpart to the Weeknd's XO

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): tbh i think the weakest opener of the three

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): of all the album intros, this is definitely one of them

**TiltControls** (6): based on the averages i've seen this is a fitting title for people after sitting through midnights

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): …well then

**Bordersz** (5): I like the production but the lyrics seem so fake hard lmao.

**popularsong** (5): sets the mood well for the album, but i dont come back to it individually

**vayyiqra** (5): Kind of like the backing vocals but then it doesn't go anywhere and it ends 😔

**Birdseeding** (4): I will freely admit to last listening to SZA seriously a decade ago, when she was a leading performer in the trippy-glitchy avant-R&B genre. So this sanded-down retro-neo-soul stuff is taking some getting used to. In any case, this has no hook at all, so gets a low grade just for that

**DaHumanTorch** (4): good lord this mixing is atrocious

**IIIHenryIII** (4): Rihanna and The Jonas Brothers outsold

**shhhneak** (4): At least someone remembers they have a song called SOS @Rihanna

**Treecoh** (4): SZA arguably made the most popular album of 2022 but she really chose this as the intro to it. like i get how this serves as an intro but cant you do that and also make it sound good?

**aakar528** (3): can't vibe

**mimins** (2): not a fan of the way she sings this one

**MarioDesigns** (0): Mixing / vocals sounds weird, just makes it really hard to listen to.

**Poydoo** (0): I get that this album needs an opener, but this one has no melody or anything and it's kinda grating. 2 minutes of this is too long

**ImADudeDuh** (4): Is this anyone’s favorite song from this album? Like I feel bad because this is one of the more confident songs from SZA in the rate, but it just doesn't feel real? Idk I can not judge her, so instead I'll just this terrible production that sounds preloaded in. Wow, this production sucks ass.

**impla77** (4): Ngl, I tanked this song bc it was boring, but now people have pointed out the production so now I would tank it for another reason. (Is that growth?)

**ImADudeDuh** (5.5): Oh right, it's the song that made everyone go "why the fuck is this the closer?" I agree that this song would probably work better as an interlude. It just ends the album on a much different note than Good Days would've. Plus, I didn't think that I would ever hear a Bjork and an Ol' Dirty Bastard sample on the same song, and this song explains why.

**impla77** (3): Mad at this song for being after the perfect end!!

---

#I could never stay mad at you <3

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a growth anthem

**akanewasright** (10): The Björk sample, the ODB verses, and SZA’s delivery shouldn’t mix as well as they do

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Omg BJONK ALERT

**CrimsonROSET** (10): slay album end

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): bjonk

**intheaftermath** (10): I liked this album but I did not love it. I did love this track though.

**jman457** (10): this is excellently produced

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): kind of anticlimactic for an ending but still a great song.

**nt96** (10): ODB and Bjork, the duality of Catalyst

**Stryxen** (10): not everyone is gonna get this but it's the best song ever

**welcome2thejam** (10): I wasn't here to save Fantasy ft. ODB, so this will have to do

**cocosairdep** (9.5): sampling hidden place is cheating though

**DirtyRat583** (9.5): bjourk

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): boosting this one because i know it's gonna get lost day 1 and hearing ODB mention "disco duck" is all i ever wanted from this world

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): this is a great closing track, not gonna lie!

**cremeebrulee** (9): she's a miracle worker because how did she make me like a bjork song

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this is going straight to my Halloween playlist

**popularsong** (9): the sample is divisive but i love it lmao. again wish it was longer

**Poydoo** (9): Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo

**rfbeirut** (9): love the samples

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): ol dirty bastard you will ALWAYS be famous

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): woah björk

**vayyiqra** (9): Sampling one of my favourite songs ever is kind of cheating but the fact she made that work (and even wilder, with verses from Ol' Dirty Bastard) is impressive in a way 😌 The lyrics are a bit confusing to me at times (why is she talking about rosaries idk I'm Catholic and still don't get it) but I am tired and need to send this ballot so will stop here! 😌

**PhoneThePhoenix** (8.8): like this a lot as the closing song!

**babadork** (8.7): I tanked the Travis Scott songs, but ODB’s estate deserves this.

**poemforsmallthings** (8.6): Gitchōr Lïchbach

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): it’s not going to do well but I like this, maybe not as a closer though

**starla\_** (8.5): I was not expecting to see ODB on a SZA song (not least cos he passed 19 years ago...) but the "feature" works so well here and SZA goes hard. What a great finish to the album.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): kind of a strange ending after good days, but it's still good

**Bordersz** (8): Love this sound. She sounds great on hip-hop beats.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): not everybody is gonna get this the first time

**frogaranaman** (8): me to the Swifties this rate

**moonshxne** (8): I'm so incredibly conflicted as to whether I want *SOS* to end with "Good Days" instead -- and simultaneously, if I secretly wish this was the opener in some capacity? Since this samples the opener of one of my all-time favorite albums, I guess I subconsciously associate the beats with "album opener"? But there's more to that: yes, I'm aware of the realistically cyclical, self-aware message the current tracklisting, whiplash-inducing tone shifts and all, is all in service of, but "Good Days" was just such a stunning and damn-near perfect moment of closure. (I think ultimately, the track "SOS" works (better?) as an opener just because it's been 5 years, but I think there's a case to be made for this!)

**Nagisoid** (8): The bottle after being found by Christina Aguilera: I'm genie, three wishes

**runaway3212** (8): we love ODB

**bogo** (7): vote for ee er next cycle vote for ee er next cycle vote for ee er next cycle vote for ee er next cycle vote for ee er next cycle vote for ee er next cycle vote for ee er next cycle vote for ee er next cycle vote for ee er next cycle

**Kayaking11116** (7): cute cute

**mimins** (7): its cool

**modulum83** (7): Yo Pierre, you wanna come out here?!

**nick1372** (7): it's fine but why not end this album on Good Days...

**slimboyfriend** (7): now…….. Why did she end with this

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): solid closer, i'm glad she picked the pace back up to close the album out

**vexastrae** (7): bjork and ol dirty bastard sampled on the same song ... thats iconic!

#I can never forgive you

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6.5): the Bjork sample saves this. otherwise, its incredibly forgettable to me

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): god this is such a jumpscare after good days

**Birdseeding** (6): A slight finale for a good album

**bluehxrizon** (5): I expected more from the bjork sample

**nooodisaster** (5): Yes, Bjork was a writer on this.

**TiltControls** (5): I was intrested for this, but it feels a little like a glorified outro

**1998tweety** (3): idk who this man is but he was not needed here

**Awkward\_King** (3): bjonk

**dreamingpastel** (2): This immediately following Good Days is like getting woken up at 3 am on a Sunday for no reason.

**MassiveThief** (2): why was this included

**aakar528** (1): boring (wtf is that outro)

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): waste of a Hidden Place sample i fear

#Why is everyone complaining that this isn't The Chainsmokers - Closer?

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.4): Now why was this the closing track? Good Days was right next door

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): good song but a bizarre closer

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): who let her close the album with this ☠️☠️☠️☠️

**jonnl2806** (7): I rated it lower because of how out of place it feels as a closing track, though I'm not sure where else on the album this could have gone. Perhaps SZA should have saved this for the deluxe.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): Good Days should've been the closer but this is alright too I guess. ODB's verse was apparently sampled from some old documentary footage Darkchild had lying around and judging from the sound quality, you can definitely tell. The beat with the Bjork sample is kinda dope tho.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It’s fine but as a closer pretty lackluster

**thedoctordances1940** (5.8): i don't like that i don't like this but i do just wish good days was the closer instead

**Shelly\_AO29** (2): This is getting a low score purely because the album should have ended with Good Days. What an atrocious decision to tack this on at the end.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (1.5): im so pissed that sza (or more likely Top Dawg) decided to end the album on this instead of the most obvious closer in the rate

**passionfruits2** (1): this doesnt feel like a closer so i hate it fuck this song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I'm not gonna lie, I did not have this song in the rate originally, but my co-hostie wanted it on it so I figured sure. I hadn't listened to it before. What the absolute fuck. Why isn't this on streaming??? This is so much fun while still having a few melancholic lyrics on here. This sounds like the one of the better songs on 1989 and I'm just in awe of why this isn't on the album nor that the rest of the album doesn't sound like this.

**impla77** (10): Aww, I was hoping this would do a little better (though it did climb from day 1 thankfully). I think some of you underrated this bc of having to find it (unfortunately there was a youtube crackdown). This is the most catchy song on Midnights, with a euphoric chorus and a really solid bridge. brb, just going to listen to this to get some dopamine.

ImADudeDuh: #Worth searching for

**poppinmmolly** (11): She put this as an exclusive Target track for a reason. She knew none of the other songs would get any plays if this existed on the same album.

**1998tweety** (10): why tf is this not on streaming, we dont want another Anti-Hero or Lavender Haze remix just give us this

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is great, I wish it was at the standard edition of the album.

**dreamingpastel** (10): Hair twirling, feet kicking kind of song

**Hulnia** (10): i need an entire album from her like this… or at least an actual release of the lmao

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the way the fan made lyric video for this song looks a thousand times better than most of her official music lyric videos is sending me

**intheaftermath** (10): Would love to know who told Taylor making THIS the exclusive track was a good idea. My god I think this being on the album would've instantly stopped about 50% of MIDnights Jokes

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): she ALWAYS leaves the best songs as exclusives, this is what i thought midnights would be

**modulum83** (10): feel like shit need the old taylor back

**musical\_pyn** (10): the fact this isn't on streaming is an absolute crime

**RandomHypnotica** (10): thank god this is not on streaming otherwise it would be cruel summer 2.0 on the ph charts

**runaway3212** (10): manifesting this on streaming soon

**starla\_** (10): I haven't heard this before cos I'm not that dedicated. WTF this is like 10 times better than anything on the album

**UselessTacooo** (10): OH MY LOVE IS A LIE SHIT MY FRIENDS SAY TO GET ME BY

**shhhneak** (9.4): This is so classically good, no wonder it’s banished from Midnights.

**slimboyfriend** (9.2): our capitalist queen teamed up with a corporation to make sure nobody gets to hear the best song she’s put out since folklore

**fairytalehigh** (9.1): really solidifies my feeling that pretty much all the bonus tracks of this era are better than the album itself

**bogo** (9): so this isn't good enough for the main album but vigilant shit is. okay

**emayzee** (9): wait I thought I was gonna roll my eyes bc of the title bc it's cute and reminds me of her early stuff

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): ctfu this is the best song on the album, why is this a target exclusive track

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): surely one of the more boring tracks could have been bumped out for this???

**udontwannaknownoel** (9): so relatable I also throw up on streets and cry over hats

**xqra** (9): Should've been a main track!

**jman457** (8.7): This just feels like a breezy 90’s alt song. Reminds me a lot of Maggie Rogger’s last album in a good way

**aakar528** (8.5): why is this not on the album ffs

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i did not want to like this!!! im sorry sza! its your fault for not putting it on the album

**jsonphile** (8.5): okay I don’t know the Swiftian lore behind this song but why is it better than most of Midnights?

**MassiveThief** (8.5): absolutely a standout and it's not even on streaming

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): Wow this is actually really good. I had to go through hell to find it but I'm glad I did. How the hell did this get relegated to a Target bonus track though?

**jaztinax** (8): no this song being on a quiz at the taylor swift club night i went to when it came out either the same day or the day before is so sick to me, swifties are another breed

**Mudkip1** (8): cute

**Nagisoid** (8): Taylor really said "If you're looking for a dream girl then I'll never be your dream girl"

**nooodisaster** (8): Oh, it's kinda good!

**ReallyCreative** (8): this song, like most on Midnights, is messy. But this basically being a Bleachers song at its core really works for Taylor and the fact that it’s not on the standard album is just criminal

**rfbeirut** (8): fun sunshine target commercial song

**Stryxen** (8): does this sound like f2f or am I going crazy

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): god why was this song so hard to find thankgod for soundcloud lol. this should not have been a target exclusive it's better than 80% of the songs that made it

**TiltControls** (8): honestly wouldn't be too out of place on one of her earlier albums

**vayyiqra** (8): Never heard this before and lol @ the photo of her making the duckface anyway good song! 😌

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Can’t tell if this is actually good or just good compared to the rest of this album…

**welcome2thejam** (8): Piracy hits different when you're trying to finish the 2022 Popheads Ultimate rate

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I only heard this song once before it was removed from the internet but it was fine?

**heysoupie** (7.7): ok um i hate that she’s using this phrase bc like, isn’t it culturally appropriative? But the song itself is so nostalgic and listening to it felt like listening to Sixpence None the Richer for the first time

**DirtyRat583** (7.5): my first dbree download of this was a carly song 💀

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): I washed my hands until they're no longer hands they're just soap

**babadork** (7): I have given up on listening to this song and have given it a score close to my average for the album.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I’m not crazy about this but yeah it’s better than SEVERAL songs on the album.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): kinda target-playlist-core but still cute

**CrimsonROSET** (7): huh!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): this is a cute sixpence none the richer vibe

**daythreeinmiami** (7): I don’t understand blondie sometimes. Someone tell me why this isn’t on Midnights with a hook like that? Sure, it wouldn’t be the strongest on the album but it sure would be a solid track on the main album Taylor!

**DraculaWeekend** (7): Why doesn't the whole album sound like this?

**just\_thonking** (7): This one's cute. It's giving like Colbie Caillat almost

**nick1372** (7): Okay yeah I was skeptical about a Taylor song with this title but this is great.

**wasian-invasion** (7): this could've been another LQgate cause the version i found on youtube sounded really rough but lets be honest its no taxi

**Bordersz** (6.5): Solid song, surprised she left it off the album main version.

#\#KeepItOffOfStreaming

**DevilsOfLoudun** (6): She's used the "main character got killed" line so many times now in different songs I hate it

**jonnl2806** (6): It's fine, I can see why this was a target exclusive but I don't get why everyone is waiting for it to be released on streaming, its not that great

**Kayaking11116** (6): this sound matches her better imo, going back to her roots

**nt96** (6): it slightly missed

**oscarbrierley1** (6): I mean it's fine I guess, but we're really going out of our way to rate a song not on streaming and it's just this???

**pastapixal** (6): Taylor please put this on streaming

**shipperondeck** (6): yay we have volume

**vexastrae** (6): this isnt SZA .......

**thedoctordances1940** (5.8): almost ended up on soulseek to download a taylor song i did not want to really listen to until somebody directed me to the file which i downloaded, listened to once, then deleted (i actually deleted it before the song was entirely finished not realising that that would stop the song from playing but it was too late so if something amazing happens in the final 20 seconds i guess i'll never know)

**akanewasright** (5.6): romance movie trailer ass song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): this sounds like a song a european indie-pop girl would release in 2013 that got covered on glee and became a billboard hit and she never had any chart success afterwards but nonetheless has a substantial stanbase on popheads who swears that her 2018 album is the greatest album of the year

**AHSWeeknd** (5): The ending to a coming of age movie from 2009

**Birdseeding** (5): Thank god this is over

**masttup** (5): I’ve only heard this song on tiktok

**mimins** (5): this song was strangely hard to find

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): you are not SZA please stop

**PhoneThePhoenix** (5): too repetitive!

**Uberpigeon** (5): actually this hits the exact same

**indie\_fan\_** (4): disney ass song

**passionfruits2** (4): SZA wronged us with hers, Taylor did too.

**popularsong** (3): the guitar is cute but this really wasnt worth the effort i had to go to find it

**Shelly\_AO29** (3): Sounds like a 1989 reject.

**frogaranaman** (2): why is the SZA song in the Taylor section

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): this is boring me out of my mind

**apatel27** (1): No Thank You

**ImADudeDuh** (9): "I don't wanna be your girlfriend/I'm just tryna be your person" is one of the hardest hitting lyrics in the damn rate. It's such a toxic mindset but what else can you do? She just needs some kind of acknowledgement that he even cares a bit about her. It's extremely vulnerable and relatable at the same time.

**impla77** (7.8): This hits too close to home sometimes.. if SZA feels like this what hope is there for the rest of us girlies?

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): SENPAIIIIIIIIIIIII

**PhoneThePhoenix** (8.1): tell him!

**bluehxrizon** (8): i honestly can’t relate to sza’s music cause i’m not an insecure loser ass bitch with self esteem issues but i see why y’all would like it i guess

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): “who needs self-esteem anyway?” girl…stand up please.

**Shelly\_AO29** (8): Love the chorus and production.

**heysoupie** (7.7): too relatable

**jman457** (7.6): This is a bit groovy

**CrimsonROSET** (7): sza breaks gender omg

**frogaranaman** (7): man she sounds desperate here……. Mood

**jaztinax** (7): an ariana feature would hit so hard on this one

**QuaxlyDuck** (7): is it just me or do I get slight Wii music vibes from this?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this is a cursed statement but the beginning of this song sounds so much like cookie by newjeans

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): senpai

**TiltControls** (7): ironically this was one of the harder songs to find something to say about

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This is her Hotline Bling

**Nagisoid** (6): Senpai!

**IIIHenryIII** (5): the call in Morse code was the best part

**oscarbrierley1** (5): has a few cute moments but is pretty unremarkable for the most part.

**passionfruits2** (5): boring

**popularsong** (5): somehow i dont return to this much, feel like it doesnt do anything other songs on this dont already do better

**Poydoo** (5): boring

**Stryxen** (5): lasts a little long, the first sign of the album starting to draaaag

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I'd say it ends to fast but the "you can trust in me" played throughout the song gets on my nerves quick. Yes, that one line is amazing, but this song is more than just that line. Not much more than that, but it is more.

**impla77** (5): I’m sorry guys, I just don’t get the point of this

---

#Them bop accusations true

**AHSWeeknd** (10): how does her voice do that??? Science, explain.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is potentially about Drake? he got ethered so badly he got finger waves and a vague jheri curl

**Hulnia** (10): the first 30 seconds are peak music tbh

**jackisboredtoday** (10): ok maybe short songs have a point bc this is perfection???

**masttup** (10): who is blocked sza!! Release the names

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): The R&B girls can RAP don’t play with them!

**nick1372** (10): One one hand, the short length is perfect for the intensity SZA is bringing, but I want so much more of this...

**Poydoo** (10): This was actually my second choice for my 11; everything about this song is perfect

**RandomHypnotica** (10): idgaf if it's short this still slays

**ReallyCreative** (10): I can see the length being criticized but I love that this song does what it needs to do quickly, plus that high pitched vocaloid part would get VERY old if it lasted any longer. It works really well as an interlude tbh

**rfbeirut** (10): this song is so me (said delusionally)

**seanderlust** (10): "them ho accusations weak, them bitch accusations true" top 10 lyrical moments of 2022 argue with the wall

**Roxieloxie** (9.6): -.- .. -. -.. .- / ... .- -.. / - .... .- - / .-- .- ... / ... --- / ... .... --- .-. - --..-- / .. - .----. ... / -- -.-- / ..-. .- ...- --- .-. .. - . / ... --- -. --. / --- -. / - .... . / .- .-.. -... ..- -- / ... --- / ..-. .- .-.

**intheaftermath** (9.5): Maybe it's entirely due to the sample but this one is just so fun! It really stands out!

**jsonphile** (9.5): the hoe accusations weak. the bitch accusations true. iconic

**starla\_** (9.5): I fucking love this!! Interludephilia

**jonnl2806** (9.1): SZA needs to do more diss tracks cuz this is amazing

**akanewasright** (9): why are these bars harder than either of her (living) features’ verses?

**Bordersz** (9): Why is it so short. Damn.

**dreamingpastel** (9): Really good interlude!

**MasterWizardRyan** (9): she decided to spit and it was tasty

**Stryxen** (9): underrated as hell

**PhoneThePhoenix** (8.9): so good so cutting

**Frajer** (8.5): it's unfair how SZA and Bey can rap and sing

**jaztinax** (8.5): this song is the only reason i know what kendrick is saying in the beginning of his verse in “family ties”

**TiltControls** (8.5): not always a big fan of the high pitched background vocals, but they work really well here

**CrimsonROSET** (8): sza smoking is bad for you

**DraculaWeekend** (8): This should have been longer

**runaway3212** (8): this song presses the slay button for the album

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): full version asap pls

**wasian-invasion** (8): them ho accusations true them bitch accusations weak cause im a slut but too self conscious to be mean :(

**modulum83** (7.8): (kendrick lamar voice) smokin on my ex pack tonight toniiiiight

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): WE HATE DRAKE!!!!

**moonshxne** (7.5): Just wish it wasn't stuffed **in between** "Gone Girl" and "Ghost in the Machine." (One of the album's few faults is that track-listing gets wonky past the mid-point.)

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): Sheeeeeesh this is fire! Wish it was a little but longer tho.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): one of my favorite, just wish it was fleshed out moore

**udontwannaknownoel** (7.5): “Are you ready for your rap lessons?” / *Nicki Minaj gulps* / *Cardi B breathes heavily* / *Doja Cat nods nervously* / *Megan thee Stallion sighs* / "Yes, SZA” they say in unison

**fairytalehigh** (7.3): i hate that this is an interlude, i feel like it would be so solid as a full song

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): I would definitely love to see her do a more hip hop type of project but also this is too short

**jman457** (7.3): short but cute, felt like the right length

**Awkward\_King** (7): them hoe accusations weak them bitch accusations true thats my MOTHER right there

**frogaranaman** (7): this possibly being about Drake is surreal

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): Track is too short to form a proper opinion, but her flow is amazing, as usual.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): artists be like yeah this is the best song ive ever made. make it 90 seconds long

**UselessTacooo** (7): hey siri what is an ex pack

**vexastrae** (7): we need a SZA rap album NOW

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.5): chipmunks yay

#Them bop accusations weak

**MrMoodle** (6): idk why i used to love these chipmunked soul samples but now they just sound annoying to me i blame kanye

**passionfruits2** (6): forgettable i fear

**popularsong** (6): wish it was longer!! need more rap sza

**welcome2thejam** (6): Fun, wish it was longer

**lexiaredery** (5.5): it's just too short

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): oh no, another filler

**Birdseeding** (5): SZA is not much of a rapper

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I have nothing funny to say and I kinda feel indifferent to this song so I’ll just leave this here, the day stan twitter was ended: https://i.redd.it/5bxyyjoi2jga1.jpg

**Kayaking11116** (5): meh, but also it's not really a full song so whatevs

**Nagisoid** (5): This is way too short and the chipmunk soul sample feels really out of place.

**oscarbrierley1** (5): feel like if this was part of a bigger song it could be cute, but as it is there's just not much to it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): …well then x2

**vayyiqra** (4): The whiplash between this track and the last one was really jarring, which maybe was the point, but it threw off the whole vibe ... not expecting chipmunk vocals here! It's also too short, not even a song 😔

**mimins** (3): was not giving

**shhhneak** (2): Interludephobia but this didn’t need to make the cut. At least lie about not watching TV or something.

**aakar528** (1): boring

**ImADudeDuh** (10): There’s something wild about SZA released this song that’s saying “I used to be special” and then 2 months later she releases a remix of a song with the chorus “In case nobody told you today, you’re special.” This song is self-pity incarnate. SZA falls back into a sad place (where she was in CTRL) for this song, talking about her yearning to feel like a unique individual, something her ex used to tell her a lot. The slow tempo for this really helps the words just hang in the air long enough to feel the loneliness.

**impla77** (9): only SZA can make me feel like crying with four consecutive lines that contain the word fuck

---

#In case nobody told you today, you're special

**akanewasright** (10): If you have suffered an injury (50+ plays of this song) as a result of another party's reckless and negligent actions (SZA releasing this song), you may be entitled to financial compensation.

**Awkward\_King** (10): :sobsing:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I called this song boring when the album first dropped. Boo past me!

**Bordersz** (10): I wish this had a MV to it. It's such a pretty ballad.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/984536582864404480.webp?size=240&quality=lossless

**jonnl2806** (10): Conceited coming right before Special is the most accurate representation of my mental state on a daily basis. I really should schedule more therapy sessions...

**nick1372** (10): This is just such a poignant, sad song... ugh SZA can I give you a hug

**nooodisaster** (10): The saddest song ever with the lyrics "Heard pilates is in"

**RandomHypnotica** (10): so… I looped this about 150 times within a couple of days of SOS's release, it just *really* hit me in the same way that 20 something from CTRL did, it's so vulnerable and relatable and soul crushingly divine.

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): felt this one too much on release week

**vexastrae** (10): this ones for the touch/affection deprived body dysmorphic/dysphoric girlies!

**sebgup** (9.6): The lyrics for this one came for my neck

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): she really just goes for the emotional jugular here omg

**fairytalehigh** (9.2): oof this one hurts

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): this makes me cry.

**avg-vag** (9): she nailed this and it’s only brought down by the double use of loser in the chorus

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): not to 180 from my Nobody Gets Me comment but i actually like this one being stripped back musically because it lets the lyrics shine (also she's not straining). i feel like she's very overrated as a songwriter but this is one of the few instances where i get the hype

**IIIHenryIII** (9): ok, I need a folk pop album from you, miss

**MasterWizardRyan** (9): she's trying to kill me with these lyrics

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): SZA you are absolutely not a loser I promise you.

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9): great little song

**Poydoo** (9): Much better than the other Special that SZA did

**xqra** (9): Aww this song breaks my heart!! :( A welcome addition to my crying playlist

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.8): Super relatable and makes me very sad :)

**Frajer** (8.5): damn even SZA has body image issues

**AHSWeeknd** (8): oof why and how does SZA turn these basic overdone concepts into actual good songs

**amr** (8): almost wrote smt really out of pocket here but let's just say she won't wanna be special anymore after she crosses paths w me

**shipperondeck** (8): :(

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): teeters on the edge of being *too* Alessia Cara-esque but i generally like it

**Uberpigeon** (8): i got dry skin too she just like me fr

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): i wish the ending was longer, could've been a nice :poohascend: moment

**rfbeirut** (7): sweet but im not sad in this particular way

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): The outro saves this song for me, it's super lush.

**shhhneak** (7): Loser Like Me ass song.

**vayyiqra** (7): sad 😔

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Cute but sad :(

#In case nobody told you today, fuck you

**heysoupie** (6.9): another one where I knew I would have loved this as a younger person!

**MToms** (6.5): These lyrics are giving Tate McCrae/Olivia Rodrigo

**Roxieloxie** (6.3): --. --- .. -. --. / -... .- -.-. -.- / .. -. / - .. -- . / - --- / -- .- -.- . / ... --.. .- / -.. .-. --- .--. / - .... .. ... / .- .-.. -... ..- -- / ...-- / .-- . . -.- ... / .-.. .- - . .-. / - .... .- -. / ... .... . / -.. .. -.. / ... --- / .-.. .. --.. --.. --- / -.-. --- ..- .-.. -.. .----. ...- . / -... . -. . / .. -. / ..- .-.. - / .. -. ... - . .- -..

**jasannn** (6): Cute lyrics but I could do without this track

**oscarbrierley1** (6): it's fine, but it's one of those lyric driven songs that does nothing for me.

**popularsong** (6): kinda boring sorry

**seanderlust** (6): my (maybe? we shall see) unpopular SOS take is that the album would be a no-skip without some tracks that just feel like filler tracks. this is one of them.

**bulforster** (5.5): too corny [2]

**jman457** (5.5): why is this part of the album sounding like a Jax song, like the acoustic of this though

**DaHumanTorch** (5): another song with fantastic lyrics but just absolutely nothing interesting going on sonically

**Kayaking11116** (5): this song is nothing special, no pun intended

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i think i would have connected to this better when i was younger but now i'm 27 and sza ur in ur 30s girl some of these lyrics read really young

**intheaftermath** (3): I am so sorry but this reminds me too much of Sit Still Look Pretty which is one of my least favorite songs of all time and I cannot shake that

**mimins** (3): sza my good sister PLEASE stand up

**aakar528** (2): eh/boring

**slimboyfriend** (1): WHERE are the pimples? WHERE is her dry skin? Am I to believe SZA doesn't owns couture? And is average looking?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Jesus. This song is an emotional gut punch that I didn't know Taylor could still deliver. The bridge alone is one of the top 3 verses Taylor has made since the pandemic (which doesn't sound like a lot but she's released >70 songs since then). Also the Lionel Messi edits were funny.

**impla77** (8): This was the first song that grabbed my attention when first listening to the album. I love the buildup to the chorus and the almost anticlimatic moment when the chorus finally happens, just for it to be essentially just Taylor saying the title. The cohesion works for me here, and I LOVE the bridge (even if it does get a little motivational poster at the end) leading into the more optimistic last chorus.

#We're all in this together

**pheromenos** (11): how can this exist on the same album as vigilante shit like...?

**therokinrolla** (11): This song could've easily peddled the self-victimizing languishing of fame that precludes a majority of this album from being actually great. Songs like Lavender Haze and Vigilante Shit deal too much with public perspective without twirling that inward to make for actually introspective narratives. I mean, it alludes to many real-life circumstances for Taylor: winning Grammy's after being patronized repeatedly on the red carpet, wanting to be a singer, eating disorders, and you'd kinda want to think it would be a little to self-serving. But no, narrative the structure of the song is genius and lends itself perfectly to these actual events in Taylor's history. There's three parts here: 1. Super young Taylor simply having a crush on a boy. It's doesn't work out, and she's feeling lonely. You're on your own, kid. 2. She wants to be a singer, and she's on her way, she sees the competition, and she's anxious and still alone. You're on your own, kid. 3. A massive cascade of confessions and damage, from her own ED experience to the previously referred Grammy's ceremony and she's biting now. "I gave my blood sweat and tears for this/ I hosted parties and starved my body like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss," is one of the most intense and sharpest lines she's ever written down. And it works because these self-confessions, well, they're really universal aren't they? Doe-eyed crushes? High ambitions? The inherent and infallible loneliness necessarily tied to the human condition? Gaining a massive multitude of friends and throwing lavish parties in the hopes that an avalanche of affection can overcome the dissatisfaction with one's own body, achievements, and mind, while acquiring terrible habits along the way to hopefully make people like you more? Maybe I feel too personally called out by Taylor, but this is the most engaging confessional she's written since, like, All Too Well. It feels like Taylor (and, when I'm listening, me) are about to break. But Taylor isn't just lamenting in this song for the sake of suffering, there's a point here, and it's in the title. "You're on your own, kid. You always have been. I mean, you’re here, aren’t you? Ever since day one you have been on your own. You have your friends, family, and acquaintances, but they don’t make your decisions. They don’t deal with your pain. They don’t make it through the same hardship you go through. Ever since the beginning of your own consciousness, it’s been you in the world trying to make it with yourself. And you’ve done it. Again and again and again. Through the tears and heartbreak, the starvation and the loneliness, the attempt for and failure to obtain perfection, it’s been you. It hurts now. But you’ve got no reason to be afraid. You’re on your own kid, but you always have been."

**1998tweety** (10): that bridge? i mean come on now. One of her bests EVER.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): honestly this is pretty sweet, but I can’t not imagine that one video of the swifties taking the bridge so seriously.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): I don't want to be a musician if this is what may happen to me, I'll probably won't last longer than a year.

**Awkward\_King** (10): i have to give it to her on this one unfortunately

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Not me listening to this song intoxicated after I’ve moved 3000km away from my home city and friends. Don’t look at me, I’m ugly crying.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (10): I wasn’t gonna write an extended comment on why I think this song rules and just say “the way this song progresses just hits my brain in such a way that my brain is happy”

**IIIHenryIII** (10): if the twist in her upcoming movie is as good as the one in this song, I might melt into tears, not kidding

**jonnl2806** (10): Love the way it ramps up as the song goes. I remember listening to an explanation of the song somewhere where the host talks about how the song basically chronicles Taylor's entire life and career and it made me love the song even more.

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): this is one of the only MIDnights songs that's actually up there among the best in her discography

**modulum83** (10): actually phenomenal stuff. it’s like her take on “Ribs” but with a dash of…post-rock and M83 influence? that climax is some real, cathartic payoff. you can face this! fuck yeah! belongs in a movie soundtrack

**passionfruits2** (10): okay bitch ig i'm on my own what about it. i cried listening to this because my tamagotchi died the other day....

**rfbeirut** (10): really sweet and poignant and im truly on my own damn

**runaway3212** (10): Honestly the theme of this song resonates with me a ton, like even if nobody else got me, I know I got me and while being depressed that's really scary but when you're somewhat mentally stable that's a really comforting thought

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is the best song on the album and i won't take any questions

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): tina belcher coded

**TiltControls** (10): It's a bit cheesy, but Taylor's soft voice sounds great here and unlike a lot of the other songs on the album it actually does a great job building up to a section that isn't disappointing

**UselessTacooo** (10): the bridge is highkey her best ever maybe??????

**welcome2thejam** (10): You've worked with Jack for years, what part of Don't Take the Money do you not understand!?

**avg-vag** (9.5): if the verses had a better melody this would be a ten - one of her best bridges ever.

**nick1372** (9): Have you seen those Lionel Messi edits they're so fucking funny

**poemforsmallthings** (9): nothing could ever explain how this bridge makes me feel

**ReallyCreative** (9): she did some damage here

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i didnt want to like this but then that bridge came on…ugh you win this one blondie

**udontwannaknownoel** (9): She got a PHD in Engineering for that BRIDGE

**vayyiqra** (9): One of the easiest tracks to overlook but the muted-sounding guitar and drums let her voice stand out and that's a nice touch 😌

**fairytalehigh** (8.6): yes i am a melodramatic loner bottom who loves parties! we exist!!!!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): this was a grower. the outro is incredibly cathartic

**bulforster** (8.2): the first verses are honestly very annoying but the bridge/outro buildup is so good I don't care

**bluehxrizon** (8): first two minutes are a 6 and last minute is a 10

**bogo** (8): "the jokes weren't funny" omg taylor's singing about phcj

**DevilsOfLoudun** (8): Great song but her vocals are far too weak

**intheaftermath** (8): the bridge is by far the highlight of this track

**Nagisoid** (8): My parents after I came out:

**nooodisaster** (8): The bridge and it's fancams snapped hard, very hard.

**Stryxen** (8): coming of age Oscar bait film climax core

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): taylor when lana asked to sing on the last track

**akanewasright** (7.8): I feel like this’ll fully click for me at some point, but for now it’s just a nice piece of coming of age soundtrack music

**babadork** (7.6): This might be my favorite version of this kind of Taylor song.

**pastapixal** (7.6): could've been a cut from Fearless imo

**Bordersz** (7.5): Starts off slow, but really picks up. A great cheesy coming-of-age song that would play in a movie like Perks of Being a Wallflower.

**PhoneThePhoenix** (7.5): reminds me of old taylor swift! it's nice! i like the production on this one

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): i have no idea what this song is about tbh

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.3): oh i love the lil distortion moments

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): another track 5 that is just okay to me

=====

ImADudeDuh: #She's on her own cause she has 2 songs left XDDDD

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): taylor stop trying to appeal to only children we all know you have a brother

**CrimsonROSET** (7): we’re not in Kansas anymore energy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): taylor’s lurching vocal phrasing works here pretty well, it’s done much tighter with the driving beat and groove of the chorus. I like the little production wobble after the end of the first chorus. the bridge kind of falters it for me where it’s a bit too muddled for me.

**Frajer** (7): we have It's Nice To Have A Friend at home

**masttup** (7): Christian lifetime movie version of a track 5

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): it’s fine.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): it's giving Tyler Joseph

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Cute I guess

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): I don’t know, some of those jokes have been pretty funny tbh

**seanderlust** (6.5): i do love the ending where she flips being on your own into something that's freeing

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): could it be better? Definitely, but I’ll take these scraps

**shhhneak** (6.4): Me entering my Animal Crossing island after 14 months

**Birdseeding** (6): A bit sketch-like but really picks up steam with the lyrics

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): It’s fine. I like the build up but the payoff isn’t super great.

**heysoupie** (6): hearing “kid” in this context feels painfully millennial like calling dogs “doggos” but also, on a way deeper level (& maybe this is too hard of a read but yolo) I feel like this song embodies Taylor’s girlbossing yt feminist energy - we’re ALL on our own in some ways, yes, but it also doesn’t have to be that way? Indeed, it shouldn’t be?

**Roxieloxie** (6): 'so i was always on my own' 'always was'

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): so low energy

**starla\_** (5.5): I want to like this but find it boring. I think it needs more oomph - maybe more percussion or something? It's a well-written song but doesn't really do it for me.

**DaHumanTorch** (5): this is the most nothing song i've ever heard

**mimins** (5): i think i just dislike the way taylor swifts sings. liked the way the instrumental climaxed though

**Uberpigeon** (5): hypno with his 11s:

**vexastrae** (5): i saw this one tweet that said denji from chainsaw man listens to this no he does not. he listens to yeat

**frogaranaman** (4): me to the man who just dropped their weed pen on the WTC bound PATH train and it rolled away from them out of reach:

**nt96** (4): nothing personnel

**popularsong** (4): really like the chorus. p emotional

**Shelly\_AO29** (4): Not really feeling this one.

**jman457** (3.7): Its gets better as at it goes, but my god I hate the beginning

**just\_thonking** (3): This sounds like she took a bunch of leftover shavings from other songs she wrote and tried to combine them into one song. Like a sausage of music

**Kayaking11116** (3): it's just so boring

**moonshxne** (3): i hear the the swells that are telling me to *feel something!* or whatever but i'm just bored and annoyed

**aakar528** (2): boring

**amr** (2): I hate when a song sounds fake like U can't convince me someone of her celebrity stature stepped into a studio with full intent to record this and yet.

**apatel27** (2): She's 15+ years into her career, how has she regressed on fitting lyrics to the beat

**Hulnia** (1): boring

**impla77** (6.8): This is catchy enough but slightly generic

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Seems like most people agree that around here is when the tracks on here really start to blend, and yeah this is not memorable, but the melody on the chorus is deceptively catchy. I wouldn't be surprised if this got to be a single in a few months.

---

#It's never too late to listen to this bop!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): who would say no to SZA tho

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this needs to be a hit right now.

**Awkward\_King** (10): a track for ppl who regularly miss the bus

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I sometimes forget this song exists but like it’s such a slay. It’s one of those “pleasant surprise every time I listen to the album” type songs.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): 11 contender tbh, stunning vibe

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): speed this up a tad and add some breakbeat/dnb drum skitters in the back, and this would be a top-tier Pinkpantheress track.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): arguably my favourite on the album

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): dude when people try to send in extension ballots

**welcome2thejam** (10): Idk I'm just a sucker for how they use the acoustic guitar here, and love how she sounds

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): she's just like me *I* want more too

**modulum83** (9.3): popping my pussy, tears in my eyes,

**ReallyCreative** (9): me to Sky Ferreira when she tells me Don’t Forget

**rfbeirut** (9): reminds me of Lies by Felix Snow ft SZA

**nt96** (8.5): the time of night when I finally decide to sleep

**TiltControls** (8.5): Saturday, March 11th, 2023

**fairytalehigh** (8.1): okay does she have a big ass or not she's sending mixed signals

**1998tweety** (8): ImADudeDuh when I submit my scores 2 days late like I usually do

**aakar528** (8): good tune (kinda underrated)

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this feels like good days evil sister but I can’t explain why

**jasannn** (8): Gets a little lost in the back half of the album but I bop to it every time I listen

**Kayaking11116** (8): I need more of this song pleek

**Nagisoid** (8): The hosts when SZA announced her deluxe after the rate was announced:

**oscarbrierley1** (8): this got lost in the long tracklist at first, but it's really grown on me.

**PhoneThePhoenix** (8): like the refrain

**popularsong** (8): love the instrumental in this and paired w her vocals... ascending. wish it was longer tho

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): idk why but i get such strong lil nas x vibes from this, this would not sound out of place at all on montero

**vayyiqra** (8): Really liked this one, a hidden gem as they say on Reddit 😔

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): me asking for the deluxe: is it bad i want more?

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): nobody asked but let me rename it 2L8

**Poydoo** (7.5): The chorus is way better than the verses, like *way* better; if she cut out some of the verses and sang the chorus a few more times, this would be a 10

**udontwannaknownoel** (7.2): Can't remember the difference between this and Far

**Birdseeding** (7): I like this in a sort of Latin Freestyle throwback way

**frogaranaman** (7): me when I entered the Ticketmaster queue for the SOS tour at 9:30:02AM local  instead of 9:30:01AM local

**nooodisaster** (7): if you're my mom, like 10pm

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): A cute little thing

**wasian-invasion** (7): every time i hear the intro i get excited that it's good days but then i realize i still have 5 more songs

#So 3000-late

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I think this takes the cake for most AI generated SZA song

**jman457** (6.3): alright

**jonnl2806** (6): One of the few the tracks on the album that are meh

**mimins** (6): it's pretty aight but the melody in the chorus bothers me

**Shelly\_AO29** (6): Okay song. This album starts so strong but unfortunately the back half is not as great with the exception being the singles.

**Stryxen** (6): minor slay

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): /u/1998tweety and me doing rates like

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): i dont remember it after it ends but i dont disike it? it's certainly there

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Yes, yes, come on. Get out all of your jokes already. Now can we talk about how this is a good song? This song paints the scene of a love that turns rocky on the bridge. She's fine doing dirty work for him and with him, as long as he's still thinking about her. The chorus is beautiful. It makes me feel like I'm in bed with slow motion feathers falling on me. The love shows cracks near the end of the song because SZA can't ever be happy on this album, but I'll choose look at this song more optimistically.

**impla77** (7.5): Love that we all know and accept that low effort comments are slay. Anyone who wrote an [insert song title] comment.. Bestie behaviour.

#I can't lose

**AHSWeeknd** (10): how does SZA manage to sound good through that awful vocoder production technique??

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this song is soooooo great!

**amr** (10): teared up a little

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh hell yes we all need to use the word “snooze” more. Fuck “sleep” we all know it’s not as good.

**Bordersz** (10): Fantastic track. The melodies, the production, the backing vocals, the altered vocals. It is a great vibe-y song that makes you feel drowsy without being boring.

**frogaranaman** (10): she saw the 🥲 emoji and nailed the emotion to a T

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): this song is laced with crack

**passionfruits2** (10): me when i am literally tired like...

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I set all sorts of alarms for different times because my sleep schedule is awful but I also never delete my alarms so I have literally over 300 alarms on my phone all set to off and I just scroll to whatever one I need and turn it on

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): This album is just serve after serve so far, my goodness! This is such a beautiful love song, makes me want my own special someone (and also makes me feel lonely but anyway...)

**shipperondeck** (9.2): perfect for relaxing inside by the ocean

**akanewasright** (9): I keep thinking about her tweeting like “I’m not just sad girl music, did you hear snooze” bc she’s right… like this is one of the only SZA songs where I wouldn’t check in on a friend for looping it

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): ooh dreamy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): cute and dreamy

**jonnl2806** (9): SZA just sounds so good through that

**modulum83** (8.9): L + cozy + comfortable + sleepypilled

**heysoupie** (8.7): really sweet, really accurate capturing of the frustrations of relationships + anxiety

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.6): she's in loveeee

**1998tweety** (8.5): me every morning at 6:30 am

**MrMoodle** (8.5): wow sza made a song about midnights

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): this mustve been really good live but going to all 3 tours this year wouldve made me=marina

**cremeebrulee** (8.3): the negative comments on this are gonna have a field day

**Birdseeding** (8): Finally a hook worth the wait

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I am absolutely in ‘seven alarms so I wake up’ team snooze is dangerous yeah OK yeah I like it I like you want yeah

**Nagisoid** (8): She's in her letterboxd era with that Scarface reference

**oscarbrierley1** (8): what's your name b.o.b so they calling you bob (I feel like either everyone is going to comment this or no one is going to notice the bitch with the bob line)

**PhoneThePhoenix** (8): super super nice, could maybe use a tad for me more but overall a great listen

**rfbeirut** (8): wonderful chorus

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): referencing scarface during your emotional love ballad is…a choice

**UselessTacooo** (8): yawn (affectionate)

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This song puts me in a zen mood

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): hate it when track titles lie

**moonshxne** (7.7): generally enjoy how the features and pitched vocals give the songs further sonic variety/lyrical perspectives, but maybe I'd prefer if SZA sang that part? just wish it wasn't expressed via pitch-shifted vocals here.

**fairytalehigh** (7.6): what i hit on all 15 of my morning alarms

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i like this song enough but its so funny how this lowkey kinda is a snooze of a song sjdfnje

**TiltControls** (7.5): if you think about it popheads rates are like the movie speed except instead of mph its bpm and instead of a bus exploding they just get robbed from a rate

**aakar528** (7): calm

**dreamingpastel** (7): Not so much of a snooze tbh

**Kayaking11116** (7): her voice is Heaven fr

**popularsong** (7): the "how can i snooze and miss the moment, youre just too important" part is so addictive

**Roxieloxie** (7): .... --- .-- / -.-. .- -. / .. / ... -. --- --- --.. . / .-- .... . -. / .. -- / -.-. .... --- --- ... . / .-.. .. -.- .

**Stryxen** (7): HOW CAN I SNOOZE IF IM ALREADY CHOSE? Like...

**TragicKingdom1** (7): i mean its pleasant but why is this sticking around so high on the charts

**vayyiqra** (7): Really good late-night vibe music (it is 3 in the morning, and a little ironically not listening to Midnights 3am edition but this album because it's last) 😔

#https://media.tenor.com/D_Wj_IKLElIAAAAC/oprah-winfrey-shrug.gif

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): I think I just missed the moment; I snoozed through the whole song

**starla\_** (6.5): good but repetitive

**jasannn** (6): she’s not saying “Joe Biden”??

**mimins** (6): don't like the chorus much but i like her vocals here

**nooodisaster** (6): I'll hit the button once

**Poydoo** (6): The title is very descriptive

**jman457** (5.9): Its alright, but yeah I guess you could say its a bit of a Snooze…

**impla77** (6.7): Our 2nd place Taylor song midway through day 2.. can Taylor hang on? Colour (see what I did there?) me and Dude surprised that this was so beloved (well.. compared to the rest of Midnights).  This song is perfectly fine to me. I kinda hate the start (the meet me at midnight part), just seems like a lazy way to tie the ‘Midnights’ concept into this song. (Also Jack Antonoff loves that Phil Collins sample!) Musically, it doesn’t draw me in as an opener, and I think the bridge is weak and kills the momentum of the song in the leadup to the last chorus.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): This song sounds like a rejected Reputation era love song. Those were sometimes good but most of the time, they were bad. This goes with the probability and ends up in the bad section. I just hate how this song sounds. I hate the "dark" production, I hate Taylor's breathy vocals in an attempt to sound sexy, I hate the "go viral/love spiral" rhyme (I don't think anyone has used "viral" in a song and it sound good in about a decade.) Imagine my shock that THIS was one of the highest songs on Midnights, and I like some parts of Midnights! Who knows, maybe I'm just under a different haze that makes this song sound bad to me.

---

#You get me high

**1998tweety** (10): from the album concept I was expecting most songs to have this sound/vibe

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “all this shit is new to me” is it though?

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): a great song to start your album and I wish it all just sounded like this, dark, moody and complex.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Well…this album does have my favorite opening track in the rate! It at least has that!

**DaHumanTorch** (10): "that 1950's shit they want from me" we actually wanted 70's since that's the aesthetic you advertised it being but

**daythreeinmiami** (10): I know y’all are gonna be brutal to this album, but I hope you at least give it the Day 2 justice it deserves (because Day 3 the Renaissance Listening Party but like I wouldn’t be mad if this made it to Day 3 either).

**dreamingpastel** (10): A good moody album opener

**horridhendy** (10): Favourite song on this album, it's such a vibe. I really like the music video too

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this album set such a high standard and I so wish the rest of it sounded like this song. My favorite by far

**IIIHenryIII** (10): https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/fm4773/don_in_the_lavender_haze_the_love_and_lightness/

**joeeswift** (10): I love the last “GET IT OFF MY DEEEESK”, I wish the album had some more interesting vocal moments like that

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): she kinda did that, one of her best openers, if only the album matched the standard this song set

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): it's so slinky and cool

**rfbeirut** (10): the little ad libs in the final chorus are the best taylors ever sounded to me i need her bratty era

**seanderlust** (10): i agree with taylor on this one - lavender haze is a lovely phrase and this floaty song really does it justice

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): Love the moody vibe of this song. Her voice sounds incredible in this, the chorus is also super catchy.

**UselessTacooo** (10): r/stonedswifties

**vayyiqra** (10): And why she ourple 😂

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.8): just hair short of perfect for me but it's great! nice vibe, definitely my favorite song on the album

**emayzee** (9.7): this album really peaked with track 1

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): naming the one uncontroversially good song on this album after my favorite color, so true bestie

**jasannn** (9.2): The younger sister to I Think He Knows and their mother is Carly Rae Jepsen.

**bogo** (9): idc that taylor says she got the title from mad men it sounds like a special strand of weed

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): oh this is propulsive yet chill, very night drive vibes which sets a good tone for the album

**DraculaWeekend** (9): Not terrible

**Frajer** (9): Gaylors putting on clown makeup once again

**Nagisoid** (9): Me when I enter Lavender Town in Pokemon Fire Red

**nooodisaster** (9): She served with this opener. Like y'all forget but knowing "folkmore" Taylor for 2 years and then going into Midnights for the first time with THIS synthy dance mess... Oh it was a moment

**passionfruits2** (9): strong Melodrama vibe, but then again i say that about a lot of Jackoff's production credits

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): we love i think he knows part 2

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): really solid introduction to the world of 'Midnights'

**wasian-invasion** (9): her thing of going high on the last syllable of each line really grated on me in folklore but it kinda works here

**welcome2thejam** (9): The drums heading into the chorus sound pretty tight

**akanewasright** (8.5): this isn’t exactly one of Taylor’s best songs (and sonically feels like a watered down “I Think He Knows,” a song I very much prefer), but it is very pretty and it communicates its sweet message pretty well

**jonnl2806** (8.5): A good opener (Possibly one of Taylor's best) but the thing that lets it down is the chorus. The verses are perfect.

**katycat162534** (8.5): A very solid start to the album!

**starla\_** (8.5): this production style is really unusual for Taylor, and like the rest of the album it's very "spacious", but I think it works well here.

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.5): Those bridge harmonies! I can't believe y'all let that music video flop

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): on my first listen of Midnights, I finished this song and thought "ok so at worst it will be a diet melodrama". Oh how wrong I was…

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): wish the whole album sounded like this, it’s driving but subtle. really like the chorus

**jaztinax** (8): i’m almost convinced this is just a lover vault track

**Kayaking11116** (8): ok yes this one? this one's good

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): “Lavender Haze” is the name of her favorite strain of weed.

**oscarbrierley1** (8): the closest this album has to a dance banger. Sounds like an sg lewis song on ambien. "Talk your talk and go viral" makes me cringe so bad, can we have a rap feature remix so I don't have to hear that part.

**Poydoo** (8): I heard a censored version of this song at the Walmart a couple days ago and they just cut out the whole line where she says the word "damn" so now there's just a big empty spot in the middle of the chorus. +1 point because I feel sorry for her

**ReallyCreative** (8): honestly I resent this song a little because of how interesting I thought this album was going to be when I first heard it

**Roxieloxie** (8): thank u miss swift for creating bisexual people that was really nice of you

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Taylor Swift and putting the word "Midnight" at random parts of her songs so she can say her album is "cohesive," name a more iconic duo

**aakar528** (7.5): cool first track

**MassiveThief** (7.5): I do like the chorus a lot. Could do without the high pitched vocal thing happening.

**nick1372** (7.5): When I first heard this my thought was "this is fine but Taylor should be making more interesting music than this." That may have been a little unfair but I do think she could've done more with this. The "yeah oh yeah"s are kind of bad and should've been replaced with a more interesting musical element.

**runaway3212** (7.5): Fine it's really catchy but I can't help but feel she wrote this song specifically to get a hit

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): taylor swift stop writing about how the media talks about you for one song challenge [IMPOSSIBLE]

**Treecoh** (7.5): this is such generic jack antonoff production but im eating it up ngl. taylor's high notes are just a lil too nasally for me.

**heysoupie** (7.3): I really like that the vocals and instrumentation seem to truly fit the lyrics/overall vibe

=====

ImADudeDuh: #Lavender is a natural relaxant, which may explain why this is so boring

**bluehxrizon** (7): this song captures a lot of the problems i have with Midnights, the songwriting is nice but the production is so sparse and half-baked. we've seen that Jack can make the subdued synth sound layered and interesting (Melodrama) so in comparison this, and much of this album, sound unfinished

**CrimsonROSET** (7): whoever said they wished there were more women in shoegaze I hope a monkey’s paw chokes you out

**frogaranaman** (7): great opening track because this is the song I was in a honeymoon phase with for the album before I took a gander at the rest

**masttup** (7): I guess the 1950’s shit is the other stuff and not the James dean daydream look in Harry’s eye

**popularsong** (7): the song i like most off it, the chorus is pretty and i really like it when songs sonically Feel like the subject material theyre about

**TiltControls** (7): I like most of the production, but I still can't get over that weird baby noise during the verses

**Uberpigeon** (7): essential oils type beat

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): this feels SO close to clicking way more for me, but alas its merely solid

**moonshxne** (6.5): For all my gripes with this album, at least I think it has a decently solid opener. However, the throbbing production does get very very repetitive and a bit annoying starting from the 2-minute mark.

**Birdseeding** (6): I will freely admit this is the first time I've ever listened to a Taylor Swift album, but this is pleasant enough. Nice transition from the Beyonce retro journey

**intheaftermath** (6): I didn't care for this one before but it hurts more following Summer Renaissance

**jsonphile** (6): I liked this more before it became a single I haven’t even heard it that many times on the radio and I already feel tired of it

**mimins** (6): i like the verses and the instrumental/production but the breathy way she sings the chorus makes me flinch

**shhhneak** (6): This can be enjoyable but then sometimes I dissociate and hear the elephant noise and I get the ick.

**Stryxen** (6): AI generated I think he knows

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): mid = the, night = altar, mm@ta promo so true

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): the lyrics… I can believe she wrote them but I can’t believe she let anyone hear them

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): very boring opener i am bored

**fairytalehigh** (5.1): that fucking KAZOO NOISE completely takes me out, I HATE IT SO MUCH

**nt96** (5): it pooted

**xqra** (5): Decent as an opener but some of the production choices throw me off (like the recurring oh-oh-oh is sooo annoying)

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): buckle in, because it only goes downhill from here

**plastichaxan** (4): Those little ooohs are so annoying this song could’ve been decent

**vexastrae** (4): that one guy who can guess jack antonoff's production style because of the bland drums ... well

**amr** (3): that little repeat vocalization in the background is so fucking annoying

**Awkward\_King** (3): this has a cute kinda muffled beat to it but everything about the song feels like a lover cut and a song has to be BAD to be cut from fucking lover

**nootnoot781** (3): i literally cannot get past that sexy goose moan honk sound at the beginning it’s vile.

**TragicKingdom1** (3): "they're bringing up my history" girl im pretty sure its you doing that

**shipperondeck** (1): this is gonna be a long ride

**jman457** (0): sorry this sounds like bland retail music

**modulum83** (0): there is something deeply evil about the vibes of this song. this fucking rap cadence, the clickity-clackity FL studio drums, the weird goddamn horny voice she’s doing. i feel like drake is threatening to start sliding a verse on this at any given moment. nothing works together the way it should, it’s just ill-fitting for her to do this. one of her most overhyped songs ever

**impla77** (7.8): Is it sacrilegious to say that this song might have benefitted from its earlier place in the tracklist? Looking at this compared to my other scores now, I think I may have gotten tired of similar songs later on that otherwise may have gotten a similar score to this track

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I don't really like SZA going for the higher notes in the beginning verse, and the chorus is kinda underwhelming but overall I like this one. I love the sparse production and the lyrics outside of the chorus are actually well-written.

---

#Seeking out this song

**AHSWeeknd** (10): do we have current ongoing scientific research which seeks to establish a reason why SZA is so talented?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): great beat, SZA’s melodic switch-ups here are great

**Kayaking11116** (10): OO GIRL oh she popped off. ate, slayed, left no crumbs

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): banger

**popularsong** (10): god i fucking love her vocals on this

**RandomHypnotica** (10): "I had to do it to you" me after putting 17 fakeouts in a reveal

**rfbeirut** (10): do it to yaaa i had to do it to yaaaaaaaa

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): Love her voice on this. The 'new dick arrives and I erect it' lyric makes me cackle every time.

**Treecoh** (10): underrated af

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.6): new dick arrives and i erect it is such a great line

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): my original comment was that she was never going to do this live because the vocals are too much, but I guess I was wrong. She either ate it up or was lipsyncing.

**starla\_** (9.5): DO IT TO YOU!

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): the rock version of this on tour goes sooooooooo hard

**jonnl2806** (9.2): SZA just sounds so good on this her voice just floats

**aakar528** (9): great vocals

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): yass, this is great as well, but the Szanese dialect is hard to understand.

**bluehxrizon** (9): sza is really one of the best melody writers out there right now

**Nagisoid** (9): Outsold Metallica massively

**Uberpigeon** (9): sza could have dealt with the chinese spy balloon

**udontwannaknownoel** (9): ate and left no crumbs. Also doesn't it sound kinda like Slide Away?

**welcome2thejam** (9): Your move, Metallica

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): the verses do nothing for me but weirdly the chorus is EVERYTHING

**jasannn** (8): batteship master

**mimins** (8): i love the instrumental/production

**ReallyCreative** (8): Teslas sensing preschoolers within 30 miles

**vayyiqra** (8): Really like the reverb-y sound of this 😔

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): What do you think would be more cost-effective: Paying for a Weeknd feature or paying for a SZA feature and then pitch-shifting her voice down so it sounds like a Weeknd feature?

**heysoupie** (7.5): the sounds of an impulsive decision :|

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): you can do anything to me miss

**vexastrae** (7.5): ok yea this IS a shibari song

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): this doesnt really feel like it has much of its own identity and i blame that on it being the outro of the kill bill video

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): one of the most memorable songs on the album ever since the first time I heard it, but also a chorus I feel like I could get REALLY tired of if I listen to it too much

**Poydoo** (7.2): "Doatuie"

**emayzee** (7.1): [crosses hands while standing in the middle of a sidewalk wearing preppy clothes] you know i had to do it to em

**CrimsonROSET** (7): we love sun tzu!

**frogaranaman** (7): this is spiritually connected to Daft Punk’s “Doin’ It Right”

**passionfruits2** (7): yassss seek and destroy solana yasss destroy his ass

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): we love a chill bop

#Target acquired

**jman457** (6.5): kind of repetitive

**runaway3212** (6.5): sza DESTROYS your house, makes landlords CRY

**TiltControls** (6.5): I'd really worry if I was SZA's ex at this point of the tracklist

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6.5): verses are great but such an underwhelming hook

**daythreeinmiami** (6.3): I am sad to announce for those following the comments I am no longer drunk on Prosecco for the rest of the SZA album. Anywho she was quite she had a nice beat.

**Awkward\_King** (6): doing the writeup for this album rly helped me appreciate all the tracks lyrically bc while this doesn't stand out to me in any way musically i do still like to listen to it for the lyrics

**jaztinax** (6): i like it but i hate the chorus so much, it just irks me

**xqra** (5.5): This would get a better score if I didn’t hate the chorus so much

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): verses are nice but that hook is soooo grating

**intheaftermath** (5): I got bored of this one really quickly. This is a really long album and I feel that this was a song that could've been left off of it.

**MassiveThief** (5): gets annoying pretty quickly

**nooodisaster** (5): Feel nothing

**impla77** (9.3): This is a perfect album opener for this album. Beyoncé proves she’s that girl throughout. I appreciate that at least one pop girl doesn’t have to aim for relatability, we love the brand. I’m surprised this is the Renaissance track out first, maybe its because I’ve listened to this as an album mostly, rather than as single tracks.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): And we have FINALLY gotten to the first Beyoncé to be eliminated in the rate. I'M THAT GIRL is the intro to the album, and that's both a positive and negative. It does a great job at setting scene for what to expect in this masterpiece of an album, but it can't show off all of its move in the first song, so it almost shows off no moves. It takes a while for the song to get going. And the song is over 3 minutes long, so it's meant to be listened to as a real song, not just an intro. At 2:30 is around when time when it goes from an intro to a real song, but before that, is a song that's very static. It sounds good, but it does *not* move that much. It's a good song objectively, but I never come back to it unless I'm checking to see if it's still not good.

#You're that girl!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I’ve been living off the 1:50 minute visual teaser she released for this.

**bluehxrizon** (10): she came on this album mad as hell

**bogo** (10): yeah it's good

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): her best album opener ever actually. the menacing bass, the looped sample, the gradual introduction of elements aaaaah. the Medulla vibes are sooo lush too. this is how you make a STATEMENT

**cremeebrulee** (10): the light is coming for girls with a 401k

**daythreeinmiami** (10): IT’S NOT MY STANS IT’S NOT MY MAN, I’M *THAT* GIRL (THAT WON’T RELEASE VISUALS)

**DirtyRat583** (10): fighting the urge to not give this a 10 (i failed)

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Instant vibes

**Mudkip1** (10): incredible intro

**nooodisaster** (10): PLEASE MOTHERS AIN'T STOPPING ME

**passionfruits2** (10): such an impactful opening to the album. i still remember my first listen when B started just... talking over the beat. the opener is arguably the most important song of every album, it sets the tone. this song SETS the tone. puts the bar very high, but no worries, the following songs continue to push the bar higher.

**plastichaxan** (10): I still remember listening to this at 12:00AM and losing my mind and screaming with my drag sister wow what a moment

**popularsong** (10): i love the repetitive sample so much. her vocals are so beautiful and the shift to the more upbeat second half + pause > "bring that beat in, now i can breathe again" is so satisfying

**seanderlust** (10): LOVE the trippy atmosphere of this one and the nod to still pimpin. excellent intro to the album

**slimboyfriend** (10): yes

**throwaway-7650** (10): that's "charted #1 on AM" ITG to YOU🫵speak nicely to ha.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): “Damn girl you can crack an egg on those tits” should be the next big pick-up line

**babadork** (9.8): That Princess Loko sample is an amazing way to start the album.

**akanewasright** (9.5): this’ll be an early out for Bey, which does kinda suck, because it is a really fucking great opener. Like damn she really is that girl

**jonnl2806** (9.5): I love this track the way it switches up its style completely halfway through is just a musical orgasm.

**runaway3212** (9.5): THIS IS HOW YOU DO A SAMPLE THIS IS HOW YOU DO AN OPENER

**shhhneak** (9.5): The lady said deadass!

**starla\_** (9.5): I feel like this doesn't get the love it deserves. The backing vocal sample speeding up and slowing down is so hype.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.4): what a statement opener

**shipperondeck** (9.1): "you know all these songs sound good" SOOOOO TRUE QUEEN!!!!!! WE LOVE CONFIDENCE AND EFFORT

**Awkward\_King** (9): this may just be an intro track but it sets the stage so incredibly for the rest of the album and she sounds absolutely ethereal

**fairytalehigh** (9): WE STILL HAVE NO FUCKING VISUALS SDSKDKSKSKSKS

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): WHERE ARE THE VISUALS?!?

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9): she really IS that girl. the transitions in this album are immaculate

**ReallyCreative** (9): A great intro track that might not have the same edge and intrigue as the rest of the album, but is so good at introducing the listener to the world of Renaissance

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): what a great intro to a great album. when you get to that midway mark you're like DAMN SHE DIDN'T COME TO PLAY

**Treecoh** (9): the instrumental for this song always sounds like it would transition into "this is for rachel you big fat ugly white...." voicemail

**mimins** (8.5): i love this opening, really sets the mood for the rest of the album

**Poydoo** (8.5): Please motherfuckers ain't

**Stryxen** (8.5): perfect build up from that sexy slow vibe to a fully involved popstar moment. And then a great transition! Love it!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): really excellent intro. the Princess Loko sample throughout the entire song gets stuck in my head so easily

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): i've accepted that the only visuals we're getting are this half video and that fever dream 60 day post on phcj

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute as an intro but on its own the song is alright. I don't find myself listening to it outside of the album.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): she is!

**DevilsOfLoudun** (8): a less successful Haunted but still good

**dreamingpastel** (8): Slow start but the ending is a vibe

**IIIHenryIII** (8): yes, you are

**modulum83** (8): ngl when i pressed play on the album for the first time hearing this song i was so freaked out

**oscarbrierley1** (8): the instrumental is kinda boring, but she carries it

**Shelly\_AO29** (8): Such a great opener. Perfectly sets the tone well for the rest of the album and reminds you that Beyonce is BACK!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): she said "all these songs sound good" and emphasis on SONGS because that's all you're gonna fucking get

**TiltControls** (8): she is

**UselessTacooo** (8): This is how you open an album

**vayyiqra** (8): Has a kind of slow start and might seem like a "just okay" intro to the album but it kind of rules once it grows on you 😯

**welcome2thejam** (8): Backup vocals are angelic

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): a great intro but compared to the rest of the album, it’s a weaker track

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU6Nw-MUw6k

**Kayaking11116** (7.5): her voice is heavenly

**vexastrae** (7.5): the tempo changing keeps you on your toes

ImADudeDuh: #Are you though?

**jman457** (7.3): its a good opener, but i usually start this album with cozy haha

**moonshxne** (7.3): Interesting how this dance record's first track feels very much **NOT** meant for the dancefloor. In fact, I'm getting more "luxuriously drawing open the curtains to let the sunlight stream in" combined with a hip-hop flex cut. I'm indifferent towards/simply pleased with most of this, but then there's those stacked harmonies near the end that make this still worth the listen.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): kinda the weakest thing on the album by a significant margin but the album is good enough that it doesn’t make this not a good song

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): this is the weakest of intros she ever had out of all her albums, but it's still great, which goes to show how great she is.

**Birdseeding** (7): ma'am, you're my age. You have children, plural. You've not been a "girl" for a decade plus. That said, this slaps up until the weird second section!

**frogaranaman** (7): the first time I listened to this album was on the plane ride home from my brother’s bachelor party after him and his friends did two fifths and a friend on the drive home. slay!

**MasterWizardRyan** (7): not my fave but the intense feelings i got when i first pressed play on this album is unmatched

**masttup** (7): yes she is

**rfbeirut** (7): Thought this song was boring for so long. Still is a bit but the dembow breakdown is really cool

**Roxieloxie** (7): Least favorite on the album, its not bad but it feels like track or lke an intro, and it is, it just means i often dont have an urge to listen to it, i just tend to jump into cozy

**udontwannaknownoel** (7): its kinda boring before the 2 minute mark...

**bulforster** (6.7): This is better than I remember considering it's pretty much just an intro. Also on release night my first listen was accidentally the clean version of the album because that was the default version that appeared so I as soon as that finished I went to put on this true version and immediately ctfu at them having to censor the very first sound on the album and the backbone of this opener.

**jaztinax** (6.5): does tweaking mean what i think it means?? bey that’s sus

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): The "Deez muthafuckas ain't stoppin' me" intro sample is iconic but I dunno about this one. It's a fine opener I guess?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): why does this song wait until the last minute to actually get good

**aakar528** (6): solid opener

**quinnpsych** (6): this is the only song on the album i skip. i like the thesis of it, but the tempo switches prevent me from getting into hte song properly

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I’m not really a big fan of this one but it is very hilarious that the only visual for this whole album right now is like 50% of a music video for this.

**heysoupie** (5): I like that this track builds anticipation and suspense, but I don’t really feel like I’d listen to it independently of the album ever (is that the point?)

**horridhendy** (5): Sorry - this is only song on the album I'm not keen on. It's not bad by any means but I do usually skip it. It's a bit of a cacophony. I'll listen to it on vinyl but will otherwise just usually start the album at Cozy.

**intheaftermath** (5): don't think I'm gay enough for this one :(

**nick1372** (5): The only unnecessary song on this album, as it seems designed to be an album opener from start to finish. It only functions as an introduction to the album's themes, as it doesn't really contain any novel musical ideas. The idea that Beyonce needs any introduction is frankly ridiculous.

**PSSST12** (5): Starting the album with a dud. Like. I guess Even the greatest of us can stumble sometimes.

**therokinrolla** (5): worst song on the album, lingers a little too long, though the production is interesting

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): and i’m datboi o shit waddup 🤪

**pastapixal** (4): a lil weak but the only dud on this album

**joeeswift** (2): Some cute vocal moments but it’s a pretty meh opener to an amazing album. Only gets interesting at around 2:20

**Nagisoid** (0): I'm sorry besties, but I don't like this at all. This song feels both unfinished and a weird mish mash of ideas, from the annoying sample to the neoperreo-like beat, and Bey's voice sounds like it's trying too hard to be boastful and sensual here? It feels very incohesive and half-baked, to me atleast. I'd rather listen to any other song on this rate, even Vigilante Shit is so bad it's hilarious.

**impla77** (7.4): If we can call out tiktok bait with Taylor, let me say this is the prime example of that on SOS. The chorus really captures the essence of that petty feeling but the rest of the song is just alright.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Words can not describe how much I hate that little 2 dollar Casio keyboard opening. Something about that noise just hit the spot in my brain that drives me insane. The rest of the song is good though! I love SZA getting her anger out in the most basic way possible: a good ol' FUUUUCK YOU!

#I <3 U

**AHSWeeknd** (10): it’s so simple yet the delivery beyond excellent.

**jonnl2806** (10): The catharsis of belting this out at the top of my lungs with thousands of other people at was worth the kidney I sold to get tickets to her concert

**jsonphile** (10): the most satisfying “fuck you”

**masttup** (10): I DO!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK YOU!!!!!!!!!!! cathartic

**modulum83** (10): why is sza singing “i hate youuuuu” to me the most soothing thing in the world

**musical\_pyn** (10): AND IF YOU WONDERED IF I HATE YOU (FUCK YOU!!!)

**Nagisoid** (10): Hi, Chamber of Reflection by Mac DeMarco!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): the way she says “fuck youuuuu” in the hook is so satisfying.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): sometimes bullying works

**runaway3212** (10): OMFGG she yassed so hard

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is just so cathartic i love it

**UselessTacooo** (10): me to SZA when she delayed this album 20 times

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.8): top-notch refrain!

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i have 150 plays of the song, its truly incredibly cathartic to me and ive looped this on multiple occasions when i was fucked over by men. HOWEVER i dont think its that amazing of a song sjkdfjks like its fine its good but its far from her best its just a great diss track to her ex

**starla\_** (9.5): I thought this wasn't on the album for some reason? But it's Hit Different that isn't on the album. Anyway this is so great and the "I DOOOOO" bit is fun to sing along to

**CrimsonROSET** (9): ratrick anthem

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): Love screaming the "Fuck you!" in the chorus. Even though this song only came out because it blew up on TikTok, I'm glad it did. It's really good.

**TiltControls** (9): one of the first songs to show up in the jukebox and now thats all i associate it with

**moonshxne** (8.8): a 🖕 classic

**Bordersz** (8.5): That "fuck you" always takes me out lol.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): she has a way with words

**jman457** (8.4): smooth

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.2): Catchy, catchy, catchy. And its so fun and funky, time to shake my non-existent ass.

**nooodisaster** (8): This is how you write a "fuck the haters" song

**Treecoh** (8): me to taylor swift in this rate

**fairytalehigh** (7.1): another one where it just unfortunately got buried, like it's pleasant enough but i don't remember it

**1998tweety** (7): shes ok

**akanewasright** (7): This is good but it’s never *really* hit for me. Like this officially came out when I was in that stage of heartbreak where I was mad at the guy, it should’ve clicked for me!

**mimins** (7): the song is fine but the little "fuuuck youuuu" is so silly to me i kept giggling

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Love the way she sings "Fuck youuuu!" so carelessly in the chorus. Beat could've gone a little harder here.

**rfbeirut** (7): loved it 20 years ago when it first came out

**vexastrae** (7): belting out the chorus is like ecstasy to me

#Fr\*ck off

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Proof that beyonce’s vocals are still great even without having intense power behind them. I love the restraint in this song. It relies almost soley on Beyonce and the production is just background noise ~~well I guess all production can be called that but you know what I mean.~~ I can understand people feeling bored by this song but if you can find the right enviroment to get into the headspace of laying in bed in a dark room, this song is incredible.

**impla77** (5.5): This is the song that works for me least on this album. Too stripped back, I don’t think the vocal tone was quite achieved, and I’m not sure whether the I’m cooler than you bit at the end was fierce or not. Just doesn’t work for me, unlike the rest of this album.

#Grandmas (complimentary)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): sis said “I know you had a rough childhood but it’s okay cause I like your trauma”

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Balladphobia get a job! Stay away from her!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Those runs are angelic

**jaztinax** (10): romantic beyonce is top tier

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): proof u can do good ballads

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): she’s a VOCALIST remember that

**passionfruits2** (10): CRAZY. SEXY. COOL. she enchants me with those vocals. you just know she was horny af that day on the studio.

**pastapixal** (10): vocals on point

**plastichaxan** (10): She really has lines like “I think you’re so cool even though I’m cooler than you” like it’s nothing… Queen

**rfbeirut** (10): underrated, perfect insecure on HBO scene transition music

**wasian-invasion** (10): my grandma must have lived life on the edge cause ive never heard of covering a sofa in plastic wtf

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.7): so smooth!

**akanewasright** (9.5): I love how silly this song is… like it’s a gorgeous moment in the middle of the album, but I giggle at “I like it rough”

**1998tweety** (9): this song is great on its own but it kinda suffers from being Virgo's Groove's intro

**aakar528** (9): smooth af

**Bordersz** (9): Her runs are like SILK.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): love that this gives the album a moment to breathe while she reminds us all that she can SING

**CrimsonROSET** (9): god how do we keep letting her get away with those runs

**katycat162534** (9): The vocals in the second half of the song!

**Kayaking11116** (9): this song is too good to be about Jay-Z but I'll let it slide

**masttup** (9): it goes without saying but I’m glad she knows she’s cooler than jay z

**oscarbrierley1** (9): this is so b'day coded.

**Roxieloxie** (9): the top stans of this song being beyonce and my brother.

**runaway3212** (9): OH SHE ENDED HERE

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): THOSE.VOCAL.RUNS! A really smooth, groovy, beautiful love song. You can hear in her voice how happy she is. The transition into VG changed the trajectory of my life when I first heard it, I can't listen to VG without it!

**vexastrae** (9): ive been looking for songs that feel like lullabies to me and this is the closest ive heard so far. cant wait to slow dance in my bedroom with someone i love

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): the closest the album gets to a ballad and it's such a goddamn serve, the vocal runs at the end give me LIFE

**modulum83** (8.9): beyonce pulling that “i can fix you” rizz. respect.

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): this song being ballad-adjacent about the warm touch of a man is a one-way ticket to day 1 I fear

**moonshxne** (8.6): "And I know you had it rough growing up/ But that's okay/ I like it rough 😏"

**starla\_** (8.5): I don't listen to this as much as I should. The vocals are incredible.

**heysoupie** (8.4): tasty bass line, the contrast in vocals vs. something like Break my Soul really shows how versatile she can be, but it feels a little out of place w the other tracks & I have a weird personal vendetta against ultra clean jazz guitar tones like the ones around min. 2 (my childhood dentist played a lot of smooth jazz & it just makes me feel angry and anxious lol)

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.3): The vocals are VOCALING

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): grandmothers found dead

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): good, but the next song is better!

**dreamingpastel** (8): That bassline!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is gorgeous but a ballad in the middle of this album throws things off for me

**intheaftermath** (8): once again, still a great listen but this album sets some REALLY high expectations

**MassiveThief** (8): gets boosted because of the amazing transition, but also tanked bc of the I like it rough line... wtf is that

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): honestly one of the high points on this album

**Nagisoid** (8): I Love It - Charli XCX ft. Icona Pop

**QuaxlyDuck** (8): this is a really good song but not one I return to often, to be honest. I just prefer other songs more.

**seanderlust** (8): it's fine but it's sandwiched between a great song and one of my favorites of 2022. this is also inevitably the first beyonce song to go out because...well, something at some point has to go

**shipperondeck** (8): "i know you had it rough growing up but that's okay / i like it rough" kinda sends

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): ended balladphobia (I hope)

**UselessTacooo** (8): wait people actually leave plastic on their sofa? Wouldn’t it crunch when you sat on it? Wouldn’t it be uncomfortable? I’m so confused girl

**vayyiqra** (8): Arguably the only weak point of the album but I still like it fine 😯 it has a nice groove and it's a lot smoother than the track before it 😯 in fact raising my score because the vocals are really quite nice on this 😯

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Her voice is like silk

**jonnl2806** (7.8): Bey sounds heavenly and I love a ballad while I understand she needed to slow things down a bit this isn't my favorite track

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): I do really value this song in the context of the album and definitely wouldn't remove it but it also doesn't stand out all that much for me, it's just good

**jman457** (7.7): sweet song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.5): when grandma dies and you need a couch

**bluehxrizon** (7): kind of sounds like a track from 4

**bogo** (7): yeah it's good

**daythreeinmiami** (7): It’s the rest song I need after dancing so hard.

**popularsong** (7): really pretty vocals

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Bit of a more mellow cut on this one. Still pretty good tho.

**TiltControls** (7): bit of a slow burn compared to the rest of the album, but its still solid

#Grandmas (derogatory)

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Love the lyrics celebrating soft masculinity. But it's... midtempo?! *gagging emoji*

**mimins** (6): its cute but its boring

**Stryxen** (6): fine but that’s it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): sorry this song had no chance coming after church girl

**Poydoo** (5.5): great bassline, but overall pretty boring

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): yeah im letting my slow song-phobia show here probably but i didnt come into this album for slow jams i came for BOPS

**Awkward\_King** (5): the tenderness of this song is really lovely and the production is wonderful but certain lyrics dont really work for me and it does feel generic at times which i think is never a problem elsewhere on the album

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I really don’t like this, it simply ain’t my cup of tea, but I can appreciate her vocals, and man… what are these vocals

**MarioDesigns** (3.5): It's fine, but feels quite boring to me, especially for the lenght of the track.

**nick1372** (3): "I know you had it rough growing up, but that's okay I like it rough" is actually the worst lyric Beyonce has ever written. It's a fucking travesty, ruining what is otherwise a great song. And halfway through the album too, right after a string of nearly perfect songs!

**Treecoh** (3): all of renaissance is at least an 8/10 except for this one. im tempted to give it a 1 because its the ONLY skip in this entire album, but alas it is a kinda pretty vocal. the sandcastles of RENAISSANCE and we do NOT stan

**impla77** (8): This doesn’t seem as tightly constructed as everything else on the album, but it still has enough pizzazz to be engaging.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): I don't know why but this song just doesn't emotionally move me like the other songs on this album do, and on paper it should. It has Grace fucking Jones on the song, basically just there as a presence. I feel like this song doesn't really have a focus.

---

#I like to move it move it

**AHSWeeknd** (10): : GRACE FUCKING JONES???

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Just gonna copy/paste my comment for Too Late here cause I’m lazy: “I sometimes forget this song exists but like it’s such a slay. It’s one of those “pleasant surprise every time I listen to the album” type songs.”

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Don’t get me wrong, Beyonce gave this sass, but Grace Jones polished this in a way that it would be rude not to give it a 10.

**DirtyRat583** (10): if im being real technically this is a 9.9 but i want the perfect average. youre welcome beyonce 😘

**fairytalehigh** (10): between grace jones and "MOVE OUT THE WAY!" there was no way this could get less than a 10

**frogaranaman** (10): this is Afrofuturism in a song

**katycat162534** (10): Hook after hook after hook! A complete bop!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): “Move muhfucka you in di wey!” - Rihanna

**popularsong** (10): im with my girls and we all need space!!

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): very nearly gave this my 11, but I thought my other pick would make a bigger impact. I love the Afrobeat worked on by Tems and Bey and Grace's voices provide a nice contrast that works really well together.

**Stryxen** (10): GRACE JONES. GRACE JONES.

**vayyiqra** (10): ‼️ MOVE ‼️

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.7): starts cool and funky and ends soooo smooth and nice

**babadork** (9.6): All of the songs on this album are packed full of ideas, but this one especially feels like it has enough material for three or four songs.

**bogo** (9): yeah it's good

**CrimsonROSET** (9): darj this month:

**IIIHenryIII** (9): my mind when rating Renaissance: everything you do will be held against you

**MrMoodle** (9): this is really great but i’m mostly just thinking about how good tokyo drift is

**nick1372** (9): Beyonce's backup vocals are so good here, listen closely to how she says "Grace... Grace Jones" during the beginning. perfection!

**nt96** (9): Pull up to the Androgynous Rate and give Grace Jones your 11s!

**passionfruits2** (9): respectfully, this song gives The Gift vibes...

**Roxieloxie** (9): I think i didnt like this one as much at first but i was very wrong for that its so good

**runaway3212** (9): GRACE JONES

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): WHO THIS GIRL IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM? Beyonce saying "Grace Jones..." in the background is one of my favourite parts of the entire album.

**shipperondeck** (9): truly a triple slay

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): SELENA!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): underrated gem on this album. getting mf Grace Jones on this track is insane

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i don't ask for much God but don't let this be the lowest rated song on this album

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): still the best Grace Jones song in the February rates

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): GRACE JONES GET BEHIND ME

**akanewasright** (8.5): I never have thoughts on this song, I just throw ass and then move on

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): missy, diana, GRACE JONES, aretha, anita, GRACE JONES

**intheaftermath** (8.5): wasn't caring for this one until Beyonce's verse... her harmonies on this track are nothing short of beautiful

**Kayaking11116** (8.5): if y'all don't move out of the way for our queen bee Beyonslay rn istfg

**Poydoo** (8.4): (Grace) (Grace Jones) (Grace Jones)

**1998tweety** (8): shes a grower

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): reminds me of that Janet Jackson Damita Jo album, but very vaguely.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): honestly this could use more Grace Jones on it tbh

**jaztinax** (8): there’s something so ‘dangerously in love’-coded about this

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): idk why so many think this is bottom 1 er

**Nagisoid** (8): SALINA MOVE

**rfbeirut** (8): took me forever to figure out where tems was on this one

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): Grace Jones ending up in two rates this month is camp and iconic

**UselessTacooo** (8): idk why but the way she yells “MHHUUUUUUVUH” makes me scream

**vexastrae** (8): beyonce giving grace jones her flowers you love to see it!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): we love 80s Androgynous promo!

**modulum83** (7.8): (will toledo voice) I KNOW WHEN I’M BEING CATERED TO

**jman457** (7.6): This bops a bit but still feels a little lull of the middle album

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Simple, effective, bop.

**seanderlust** (7.5): beyonce saying "Grace Jones..." in the background like she's gagging she is on a track with her...i live.

#MOVE OUT THE WAY!

**starla\_** (7.5): this feels like an interlude even though it's 3 minutes long. Enjoyable but doesn't feel quite...finished

**TiltControls** (7.5): love the cross-rate promo

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): like i can appreciate it objectively but the whole time it plays im just waiting for heated to start

**udontwannaknownoel** (7.4): Beyonce interrupting Grace Jones every time she says anything sends me

**shhhneak** (7.3): For $1 name a woman.

**heysoupie** (7.2): idk I really like Tems but this one feels a little like a repurposed ENERGY

**jonnl2806** (7.2): I love Tems so it breaks my heart to say this my least favorite song on the album

**Birdseeding** (7): fun but messy! Bruk up!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): honestly im kinda disappointed at how little grace jones does in this song she deserves better

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Moo moo moo moo

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): MOVE MOVE MOVE MOVE

**mimins** (6): wish the instrumental was more developed but her vocals are soooo good and its pretty catchy

**aakar528** (5): not very memorable tbh

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.5): She wasted a perfectly good Grace Jones feature here imo. Outro is sick though.

**cremeebrulee** (3.7): beyoncé repeating "grace jones" is so funny for no reason

**ImADudeDuh** (10): SZA dips into her letterbox for a title of one of the best album cuts on this. This song just feels so lonely despite being in a relationship. You can feel her get closer to her breaking point as she is scrutinized and losing her interest in this relationship. Soon, she's gonna leave and he's gonna have to learn how to deal with it. And she uses a sample of [Hall & Oates](https://youtu.be/3Cos7id7HtE?t=116) of all people?? That's legendary.

**impla77** (9): I really love the atmosphere of this song, but surprisingly (as a Rina stan) don’t love the key change in the last verse, it kinda counteracts the more chilled, spacey vibe of the song. Without that, this probably would be a perfect 10 for me! SZA always kills it with the vocals.

---

#Don't leave me 

**AHSWeeknd** (10): much sweeter than the film

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is so fantastic, I'm gonna cry with the lyrics.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I was really torn between this and Ghost in the Machine for my 11. Unfortunately for this song, the random number generator did not smile upon it.

**jman457** (10): this is really catchy

**moonshxne** (10): At the end of the day, I'm just a sad piano ballad girl.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): that key change at the end changed my life

**nootnoot781** (10): amy dunne stans rise up!

**oscarbrierley1** (10): yasss key change slay

**RandomHypnotica** (10): if I had a nickel for every time sza delievered an amazing song that shares a 2 word title with a critically acclaimed movie I would have two nickels which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice

**shhhneak** (10): Anything named Gone Girl remains immaculate.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): something about sza naming her songs after movies always ending up in a slay

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): girlboss

**UselessTacooo** (10): GAWNNNN. GAWNN GURRRLLLLLL GAWNNNNN GUERRRRRRRRL

**welcome2thejam** (10): The power to come back after five years and go "who's up for a song reponse to Hall & Oates"

**shipperondeck** (9.9): me running away with the floppy arms sobbing as this song plays in the background

**udontwannaknownoel** (9.9): The key change??? Oh my godddd

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): she really ate on that bridge (she's=onika's, gone=burgers)

**modulum83** (9.3): between this and kill bill this album lookin like an average filmbro’s letterboxd favorites page

**1998tweety** (9): that key changed devoured

**Awkward\_King** (9): I am so much happier now that I’m dead. Technically missing, soon to be presumed dead. Gone. And my lazy, lying, cheating, oblivious husband will go to prison for my murder. Nick Dunne took my pride and my dignity and my hope and my money. He took and took from me until I no longer existed. That’s murder. Let the punishment fit the crime.

**Nagisoid** (9): You go girl

**passionfruits2** (9): me when i am literally a Gillian Flynn book...

**ReallyCreative** (9): that one movie is SHOOK

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): SZA is taking us to church! Love the gospel background vocals and key change.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): it starts out sounding like it's gonna be not so great but then it just is

**CrimsonROSET** (8): it’s interesting how much this album also takes after horror movies

**fairytalehigh** (8): actually a pretty solid song but amy dunne outsold

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I fucking love this song. SZA is going full "I need some sex NOW" and she does not want to be seen with this guy. She's the one in control of the ~~relationship~~ ~~fwb~~ hookup that she regrets being a part of, but won't stop her going back since she knows what she wants. Plus, the production and Travis' adlibs improve the song and make her sound more powerful. I really wanted this to make day 3.

**impla77** (7.1): I am too much of a loser bitch to get this song, and I accept that

**shhhneak** (10): Y’all better not be rating this song on the lowski.

**sufjancaesar** (10): almost my 11 and one of my favourite SZA tracks tbh… i can’t explain how much of an earworm this chorus is to me - idk what she put in this but it’s been on repeat since release date till today

**Stryxen** (9): she sounds like she's smirking the whole time she's singing. How mischievous and nefarious

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i wonder if travis's publisher has a prewritten contract for if you just want his adlibs on a song. also did he like go into the studio to record new ones or is there just a .zip of .wav files that they circulate around? these are important questions

**vexastrae** (9): my ass is shaking!

**seanderlust** (8.5): travis scott getting the taylor dueting with another female artist treatment help

**fairytalehigh** (7): i can't hear anything other than travis scott here

**IIIHenryIII** (7): poor Travis, he got the reverse Taylor feature

**intheaftermath** (7): maybe I'm just a dramatic theatre kid who doesn't like stuff unless it's broadwaycore. I'm so sorry

**Nagisoid** (7): Stream Low by David Bowie!!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): "I need you to get the fuck out my space" mark zuckerberg in 2004 be like

**TiltControls** (7): She may be the lowest of the lowest, but does she have those apple bottom jeans? Boots with the fur? Was the whole club looking at her?

**vayyiqra** (7): Bass on this is cool 😔

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I am not a fan of trap but SZA has some magic about her

**CrimsonROSET** (6): lowski isn’t a word I particularly love

**modulum83** (6): sometimes a pop album just has a travis scott song on it for no particular reason and we just have to deal with that

**nt96** (6): its ok, but trap sounds have been overdone for years, please move on

**runaway3212** (5): Imagine being a man

**heysoupie** (4.8): travis scott sucks, the word “lowski” is corny

**xqra** (4.5): It’s well produced for sure, but the song itself is a bit boring for me

**Awkward\_King** (3): lowski im sorry sjdknejkfkdmvb

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): so true

**ImADudeDuh** (8): The tiktok trend this song came from was cute. The pre-chorus was the best part of the song, especially when SZA has that quick flow. SZA talks about a lot of things on this song: feeling stuck in the past, being unable to focus on the positives, and the kind of things you do for happiness, no matter how unhealthy they probably are. And while still being aware of all these bad things, she still can't help it. She's blind to them. And then she gets chipmunkified to do some vocal runs at the end of the chorus for some reason.

**impla77** (7.6): Honestly I still don’t really understand ‘my pussy precedes me’ in the context of this song, but it is iconic to be sure.

---

#Can't see, but luckily I can hear this bop!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the person who wrote the AOTY writeup on this album mentioned how SZA perfectly writes the experience of feeling lost/unfulfilled in your 20s. That put into perspective why I couldn’t get over this song. Shoutout to that person!

**akanewasright** (10): mental illness in a song?

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): unfortunately, I don't have a pussy.

**amr** (10): music is real.

**Awkward\_King** (10): my pussy precedes me..... tectonic plates shattered when she wrote that lyric

**cremeebrulee** (10): she's officially lost vision!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Kesha outsold but this doesn't say much

**MrMoodle** (10): woah

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): ohhhh I would love to hear Ariana cover this.

**passionfruits2** (10): me when i can't see i'm blind....

**pastapixal** (10): my pussy precedes me.

**popularsong** (10): man. perfect song. up to the vocal effects on "bliiiiind" post-chorus parts

**RandomHypnotica** (10): for some reason the line "hit my clutch and vroom third day pop out the tomb" I imagine this but sza

**rfbeirut** (10): waited so long for this one

**seanderlust** (10): this entire track is so gorgeous

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): Another favourite track. I'm obsessed with her flow on this, she makes the song so dynamic and interesting despite it just being her voice and a sparse instrumental.

**sufjancaesar** (10): career highlight!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): one of the best introspective tracks on this album and the vocal performance/production is to die for

**ReallyCreative** (9): my pussy precedes me is one of the greatest lines ever penned

**starla\_** (9): my pussy also precedes me, very relatable

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.9): Unrelatable, I have perfect vision

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): i want "my pussy precedes me" put on my tombstone

**jasannn** (8.5): me when I sweat too much on the stairmaster

**FlavaSavaVandal** (8): me when i see the taylor massacre

**Frajer** (8): I ain't no Julia Stiles

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): oh to see without my eyes the first time that you kissed me boundless by the time i cried i built your walls around me white noise what an awful sound fumbling by rogue river feel my feet above the ground hand of god, deliver me oh oh woo-oh it's me the first time that you touched me oh, will wonders ever cease blessed be the mystery of love.

**Nagisoid** (8): Stevie Wonder:

**slimboyfriend** (8): Hellen Keller be like

**TiltControls** (8): steviewonderratewin.mp4

**wasian-invasion** (8): if you walk in a very specific way im sure you could get your pussy to precede you and be the first part of your body that enters a room

**moonshxne** (7.9): love the solitary seaside atmosphere...not so sure about the many pitch-shifted *bliiind*s. Still, would listen to while the coastal wind blows against my face.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): this may not be save the last dance but sza’s got enough grievances that maybe it can be 10 things i hate about you

**lexiaredery** (7.5): vroom vroom

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): hard to comment on a song when it sounds like a poem but you still don't pay attention to the lyrics

#Wish I was deaf instead

**1998tweety** (7): the blind part eats but the rest is meh

**Birdseeding** (7): Poetically fantastic and the delivery is amazing but could have been more production-wise. That's starting to feel like the theme for the whole album btw

**CrimsonROSET** (7): messy

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): me letting my cat enter the house before me: “my pussy proceeds me”

**mimins** (7): i wish it built up more towards the end but i still like it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): the high pitched bliiiiiind carries the song for me ngl

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): i pretend i do not see it the musical

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Pussy over a string arrangement, pure art

**intheaftermath** (6.5): someone get her some glasses

**Kayaking11116** (6.5): it's... ok ig

**Treecoh** (6.5): its ok but the rest of the song doesnt live up to the tiktok chorus

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I don't know what the fuck she's saying, but girl I am living. The trap production and the deep drums really work well together. I remember when this was teased at the end of the Good Days video and it was hyped af and then we didn't hear anything for almost a year. Hate her for that, but at least when the song officially released it was a bop!

**impla77** (7.9): I underrated this a tad, its hella catchy

---

#Them bitches is thirsty (for more songs like this!)

**Frajer** (11): what the fuck is going on with Billie and SZA getting blood all over their shirts

**TragicKingdom1** (11): the way this lived up to the hype and it was paid dust by everyone except for radio anyways

**AHSWeeknd** (10): when she shot her shadow in the video, I felt that. Because I was the shadow.

**akanewasright** (10): the stripper song of the album it’s true

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): I had a great time listening to this.

**amr** (10): bounce that ass like spalding

**bluehxrizon** (10): THIS is how you do a sparse production Ms. Swift

**Bordersz** (10): It has the signature SZA sound on it. I love making up lyrics when I sing along to this.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): yea this was a good first single

**frogaranaman** (10): love show she made her fans beg for this song for a year then did jack shit to promote it. edging queen

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): we were begging, shaking, & crying for this it’s true

**popularsong** (10): another 11 candidate...

**rfbeirut** (10): just so good

**runaway3212** (10): Like she ended so badly with this

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): We waited so freaking long for this song, I remember how starved we were with just that snippet at the end of the Good Days video. The beat is crazy good, the chorus is so catchy, SZA at her best!

**starla\_** (10): I think this is my favourite on the album. I love the bass-heavy production and the chorus goes off

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): loved this from first listen, maybe this is my favourite??

**jasannn** (9.5): I have no idea what this song has to do with a shirt but the beat is amazing.

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.5): yess!!! feeling lost but I like it

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): was in disbelief that the album was coming when this dropped... tbh i'm still in disbelief we have the album now

**shipperondeck** (9.1): this grew on me a lot

**Awkward\_King** (9): the GRIP this snippet had on the sza stan community was insane, and deserved

**moonshxne** (9): love love love the bass here

**Stryxen** (9): awesome production and melodies. One of my favs

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): such a good windows down, late night drive kind of song

**welcome2thejam** (9): Love the bridge

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): that bridge is fantastic

**jonnl2806** (8.5): The music video is fire and so is the song

**nick1372** (8.5): SZA really needs lyric videos on Youtube I have no idea what this girl is saying ever....

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Darkchild??

**TiltControls** (8.5): i mean it's no question? but the lyrics here are probably some of the best in the rate

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.5): I also have a new bitch on my nerves

**CrimsonROSET** (8): no shirt… no shoes… no service

**mimins** (8): oh this kinda eat

**nooodisaster** (8): I think I overplayed this song when it first released, but it is actually good

**passionfruits2** (8): i was high when i heard this album for the first time and i was really trying to understand why this song related to the title "Shit"

**ReallyCreative** (8): I’m not a huge fan of this except for SZA’s absolutely hypnotic flow

**UselessTacooo** (8): TWO YEARS. TWO WHOLE YEARS. GWORL.

**vayyiqra** (8): neat drums 😔

**vexastrae** (8): a bop!

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops

**jman457** (7.2): This was pretty

#Dammit, this was my favorite shirt too

**Kayaking11116** (7): she cute but doesn't really stand out

**Nagisoid** (7): "Tough crowd, I hate it" Charli in Germany playing I Love It

**pastapixal** (7): so many better picks as singles imo!

**RandomHypnotica** (7): never really gravitated towards this song unfortunately

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Cool (I’m sorry I can only come up with so much comments about all these songs)

**wasian-invasion** (7): idk compared to the other singles something's not clicking

**bulforster** (6.5): this is good but just never clicked for me idk

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): is it weird that almost half of her song titles on this album are so short

**heysoupie** (6.2): a v SZA sounding song to the point that it’s less interesting than some of the others?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): There was so much hype for this song…and then it was just like fine.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): there's a good idea here that doesn't quite come to fruition

**intheaftermath** (6): better than Far but it's not Kill Bill

**Poydoo** (6): The drum beat is the only memorable part of this song, but damn, it's a good drum beat

**aakar528** (5.5): decent

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): she couldve left this off the album and nobody wouldve complained

**modulum83** (4): the beat unironically sounds like one of those “worst beat ever” youtube videos

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): SZA goes Punk Rock?!?! \*NOT CLICKBAIT\* I'm so glad SZA tried to go for a different genre, even if I don't think it was 100% successful. The production does feel a little copy paste at some points. However, the angry/desperate yelling of "I FUCK HIM CAUSE I MISS YOU" is once again the mix of sing-along-able and unhealthy af.

**impla77** (7): Honestly bring back the pop rock era. I appreciate SZA going in a completely different direction in this song, just proves she has the voice to tackle anything. Is it completely successful? No, but it is fun

=====

ImADudeDuh: #Rock on!

**brendjac** (11): country punk pop sza ftw

**modulum83** (11): there’s something about the ugly, messy, cry for help that this album is that makes this genre shift fit so well. as someone going through deeply similar experiences at the moment, this gives me the toxic emotional catharsis that a hundred midwest emo and post-hardcore bands have been unable to reach in me. this hits like a stab in the gut.

**1998tweety** (10): we need the Avril remix

**akanewasright** (10): if you don’t get life from this, you don’t know how to have fun

**Awkward\_King** (10): the haters will not see the sunlight this is such a brilliant pop rock track

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): As I give this a 10 part of me does feel like this song may not actually be good…but I do not care.

**cremeebrulee** (10): can't wait to be vindicated when hayley williams hops on a remix of this  🙏

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I don’t care pop punk is back baby!!

**dreamingpastel** (10): "SZA singing a rock song co-written by Lizzo" sounds like something thrown together in Mad Libs, but it works.

**fairytalehigh** (10): this sounds like it belongs to an entirely different album but it's so goddamn good

**frogaranaman** (10): now why is this relatable

**horridhendy** (10): Despite being a bit of a left turn for this album - it's one of my faves. Honestly, I kinda wish there was more of this sound on the album

**IIIHenryIII** (10): she just ended Willow’s career with this one

**jaztinax** (10): it’s giving R-rated disney channel rock in the best way (it’s my niche)

**jman457** (10): Olivia rodrigo wishes…

**jonnl2806** (10): I need more punk rock SZA on the deluxe and as a side note I wish I didn't relate to this song as much as I do

**jsonphile** (10): why does SZA work so well on this song?

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): SZA Lavigne ate MGK with just this song

**masttup** (10): fun to sing with the punk pop YEWWW

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): my jaw dropped when I first heard this she’s honestly kind of sick for this

**nick1372** (10): we need a pop punk album STAT

**nt96** (10): her MySpace rock era we love to see it

**passionfruits2** (10): the girls that get it, get it. the girls that don't, don't. simple.

**popularsong** (10): the girls that get it get it

**PSSST12** (10): My Fave Sza song and her BEST song omg. Literally died when I heard this for the first time.

**ReallyCreative** (10): shes serving your honor

**rfbeirut** (10): crack to me i ran it back so quickly on my first album listen through

**shhhneak** (10): This was so close to getting my 11 let me put a goddamn mark to that.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): god this is such a fucking banger this is probably my favourite on the album

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I FUCK HIM CAUSE I MISS YOU!!!!!!!

**TiltControls** (10): Not what I was really expecting from the album, but sure I'll take an absolute pop-rock banger

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): SZA said we're bringing fun back to the music industry

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): …Why am I so predictable

**wasian-invasion** (10): ooh yes didnt know how much i needed rock sza

**xqra** (9.7): I think she does amazingly here as a departure from her "normal" sound (although she was already pretty sonically diverse I feel). The delayed drop in the second chorus is one of my fav moments

**Frajer** (9.5): get her and Fefe Dobson in a room together

**jasannn** (9.5): only the hot girlies get it

**katycat162534** (9.5): I didn’t expect a song like this on the album!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9.5): Channeling her inner Avril/Fefe here. Sounds like it would fit right in on Under My Skin. Also wtf Lizzo co-wrote this???

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): I love seeing sza experiment, and while I think for the most part this is a success, it feels a little bit

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): seeing lizzo co-wrote this is wild

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): oh the 90s vibes are fantastic

**sebgup** (9.2): Such a banger, the flow on the second verse is pure art

**DirtyRat583** (9): this is what olivia thought she was doing

**intheaftermath** (9): this was out of NOWHERE wow!!! this was so much fun. I wish this album was ordered differently though

**vexastrae** (9): fuck the haters this song is GOOD

**welcome2thejam** (9): Too Furious, but just the right amount of Fast

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.7): Messy bitch that lives for drama

**PhoneThePhoenix** (8.5): guitar!🎸🎸🎸

**seanderlust** (8.5): SZA POP PUNK MOMENT SZA POP PUNK MOMENT SZA POP PUNK SZA AAAAAA

**starla\_** (8.5): this genre smash is so great

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): ovulation also makes me want to make DCOM music about fucking my ex

**MassiveThief** (8): yeah, the novelty kinda wore off, but at least it sounds different. a welcome change when listening in full. and it bangs

**moonshxne** (8): inexplicably, perfect use of pop rock here. maybe i would like the genre (a lot!) more if more of it was about revenge sex

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): my headphones broke while i was listening to this and honestly it made it sound better

**aakar528** (7.5): ayy somethin different

**heysoupie** (7.5): chaotic,fun, real what a TURN

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I’m glad she tried out the pop rock sound! Do I think that this style suits her best? No but it’s fun

**Kayaking11116** (7.5): got whiplash but SZA in her Avril Lavigne era? slay

**AHSWeeknd** (7): SZA is allowed to make annoying 2000s era songs.

**Stryxen** (7): goofy and foolish (pos)

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): vote for whatever pop punk rate hypno is brewing

#"erm that's not REAL music"

**Treecoh** (7): it's a bop but it's also an avril lavigne demo from 2005

**just\_thonking** (6.5): Competent

**thedoctordances1940** (6.1): I do like the writing and the hook is catchy but the production of it sucks

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): don't ask me, but look up the songwriter of this song, that's all.

**Birdseeding** (6): This is great, but in a square, expected way. We know SZA can do more.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): pee 2 pee :rofl:

**MrMoodle** (6): i don’t think sza has the voice to pull this off tbh or at least not the way she sung it here, needed more edge

**Poydoo** (6): I appreciate that she tried something different here, but to be honest, this is a pretty mid pop-punk song. If Avril Lavigne made this, none of yall would even give it a second thought

**poemforsmallthings** (5.2): well.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): look, my whole niche is afropunk to the point where i hosted a rate on it kldsklds and this song doesn’t do it for me, production-wise

**mimins** (5): i'm a certified pop-punk enjoyer but this reminded me too much of disney channel...and not even the good ones.

**runaway3212** (5): this isnt good but I like yelling

**Shelly\_AO29** (5): Not a song I revisit often, but I admire SZA for trying something different.

**pastapixal** (4.5): it's cute but nowhere near SZA's best

**vayyiqra** (4): This is so 90s lol. I don't really like it, but the authenticity was nice 😔

**apatel27** (3): juvenile guitars

**Nagisoid** (3): The verses are fine but after and during the chorus the production gets REALLY rough and it becomes hard to listen to. I support her pop punk era as long as Travis Barker stays far away, though.

**bluehxrizon** (2): need this genre trend to run its course expeditiously

**DaHumanTorch** (2): i love that she tried something new! never do it again though

**amr** (1): we grown.

**DraculaWeekend** (1): Why is this the song she decided to enunciate on

**Around-Town** (0): least favorite because I hate songs about cheating.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (0): SZA has major label support yet this sounds like it was released by a high school band

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I actually don’t like the gospel inspired parts of the song that much, but I understand it's placement in this song. However, the slut dropping parts? Yeah that’s my shit.

**impla77** (7.2): uhh.. I was in my lowering Beyoncé averages to bring some semblance of equality phase, and that was a mistake. Not one of my favourites on the album but is a solid 8 at least. Thank god other popheads made up for my mistakes

#Church aesthetics

**letsallpoo** (11): "must be the cash cause it aint your face" is the best line in the whole rate

**AHSWeeknd** (10): anyone who gives this a score below 7 put thottie-ism before church-ism

**avg-vag** (10): it shouldn’t be possible that this is so heartfelt

**babadork** (10): Usually any song that I don’t recognize by title is not going to be getting a 10, but I didn’t recognize it because in my mind this is called “Drop It Like A Thotty (You Bad).”

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I have reason to believe this will be robbed, but it sure as hell won’t be because of me.

**bogo** (10): yeah it's good

**daythreeinmiami** (10): lmfao the beat alone and the way I shake my ass is enough to send me down below. I won’t be without company tho. Most of the women in my family are there. We will twerk our asses together. Get it Nan.

**DirtyRat583** (10): i absolutely adore this song and then i pop onto the net and see most people dont really like it which ???? its so good. is it because i was raised catholic 😭😭☹️

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): i'd be a good christian if this was played on the gospel radio!

**horridhendy** (10): On first listen through, this was my favourite track. It goes off.

**intheaftermath** (10): tbh I replayed this one as soon as I finished it. Such a fun song and the vocal performance just sounds like she's having the time of her life.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I was 100% not prepared for her to Drop it like a thottie over a Clark Sisters sample she’s insane

**nick1372** (10): most underrated song on this album! drop it like a thottie!!

**passionfruits2** (10): the sample IS INSANE TO ME. twerking to this at a houseparty was a highlight of 2022 to me.

**plastichaxan** (10): Need someone to think of when I hear the line you can be my daddy if you want to fr

**RandomHypnotica** (10): she has a point, church girls are always the ones who are most likely to wear a pearl necklace

**rfbeirut** (10): should be a radio hit

**Roxieloxie** (10): 🎶 Music for a Whoreish Restaurant 🎶

**runaway3212** (10): WE LOVE CHRISTIANITY

**Stryxen** (10): loved it on first listen then grew off me and now it’s grown back ON me !!

**sufjancaesar** (10): greatest twerk anthem… ever

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): THIS IS SO UNDERRATED GIVE THIS SONG ITS FLOWERS should be more popular solely for "must be the cash cause it ain't ur face"

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): a reference to 2011 youtube comedy song tig ol bitties? in MY critically acclaimed house album celebrating the black lgbt+ community? its more likely than you may think

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Oh I just know Pandreo would throw ass to this

**Kayaking11116** (9.9): I'm about to drop it like a thottie with tig old bitties

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.7): brilliant

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): if bey gave this to chloe we'd have gotten the album a year ago

**modulum83** (9.5): the renaissance song of choice for people who actually go to parties

**starla\_** (9.5): this is like a less straightforwardly pop Cuff It. So good

**heysoupie** (9.3): v fun

**shipperondeck** (9.3): i resonate with this song greatly for personal reasons🙏

**akanewasright** (9): DROP IT LIKE A THOTTIE DROP IT LIKE A THOTTIE

**frogaranaman** (9): I think the Virgin Mary was the first one to “drop it like a thottie” after she gave birth to Jesus

**jman457** (9): This song has some much joy and meaning in it

**Lilacly\_Adily** (9): the way I was feeling so ambivalent about this album and then this song immediately claimed the highest score by being an undeniable bop

**MassiveThief** (9): my first favorite from the album. the energy from DROP IT LIKE A THOTTY is just insane.

**Poydoo** (9): Not a whole lot to say, just a really good dance song

**ReallyCreative** (9): Tig Ole Bitties

**slimboyfriend** (8.4): Honestly what I expected when I saw she had a song called Church Girl on the album

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): I love christian contemporary music

**jonnl2806** (8.2): As a traumatized gay who went to catholic school this just hits the right spot of making me want to throw ass in church

**Birdseeding** (8): Okay, suddenly a retro throwback I actually like. I think it's that despite the "Triggerman" sample and the New Orleans bounce references, it actually feels unique and fresh, and treats the source material as beloved inspiration, not a blueprint to copy wholesale

**CrimsonROSET** (8): must be the cash cuz it ain’t your face :kirbyell:

**pastapixal** (8): drop it like a thottie

**seanderlust** (8): https://youtu.be/T-zA-c5r5PU

**udontwannaknownoel** (8): if Beyoncé wrote the lyric it must be the cash cause it ain't your face about me I would cry

**vayyiqra** (8): There isn't a whole lot of melody in some parts but it's still a banger 😯 also the drums are cool (I play drums)

**vexastrae** (8): YOU CAN BE MY DADDY IF YOU WANT TO

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): “it must be the cash cause it ain’t your face” when you murder your husband on your own song

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): Remember when she tried to make this the second single even though 99.9% of her fans wanted it to be “Cuff It” instead? She did swap it out eventually but still, 'twas a bit of an odd decision.

**TiltControls** (7.5): 'she ain't trying to hurt nobody' she says as taylor loses her 8th song in a row day 1

**1998tweety** (7): im not thotty

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I live for church people being mad at this lol

**Nagisoid** (7): Ethel Cain:

#Churchgoers (the homophobic ones)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): this could've never existed and the album is much more tighter and greater.

**jaztinax** (6): this must be the most unserious song i’ve heard from beyonce ever

**oscarbrierley1** (6): sounds like part of a song, but not the whole thing. Idk it just doesn't quite hit for me.

**popularsong** (6): feel like it could be much more fun given the concept... the chorus is more annoying than catchy

**Shelly\_AO29** (6): Hip-Hop Beyonce for me is really hit or miss, and unfortunately for me, this is a miss. Her voice, as always, is the highlight.

**UselessTacooo** (6): genuinely abysmal, atrocious, awful, brutal, damnable, deplorable, detestable, disastrous, dreadful, execrable, horrendous, horrible, pathetic, stinky, sucky, terrible, unspeakable; but also Beyoncé…..

**mimins** (5.5): its fun but not really for me

**nooodisaster** (5): The 3 songs that surround this on the Renissance tracklist are where I skip and if I admit that to beyhive I may be killed

**Bordersz** (4.5): Noisy.

**cremeebrulee** (3.3): i respect all my thotty religious girls don't get me wrong... this is not good tho </3

**aakar528** (3): okay? (what are these lyrics lol)

**Around-Town** (3): There were some high pitched parts that I found grating

**MarioDesigns** (2): Not sure exactly why, but it's just a hard listen for me. Not a fan of the instrumental and the way it interacts with the vocal just feels somewhat harsh.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Stop stop! I'm already depressed! This song has SZA's best vocals in the whole rate, along with a lovely guitar to go over this heartwrenching ballad. Bringing up real arguments and how she tried to block out his memory by fucking other guys, only to think of them as him. I'm sure it's hard to write any song about a failed engagement, especially when you weren't the one that called it off. It feels very melodramatic and actually dramatic at the same time. Heartbreaking stuff.

**impla77** (8): how the balls deep line works here i will never know.. the Catholic Church should put that down as a miracle. Thank you St SZA

---

#I get you

**1998tweety** (10): we need the Avril remix [2]

**AHSWeeknd** (10): now I’m crying smh.

**akanewasright** (10): only sza could fit “you were balls deep, now we beefing” into a tearjerker guitar ballad and make it feel natural. This was my immediate favorite from the album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Kinda funny that Renaissance has my highest average but my top like four 11 contenders are all on this album.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): DRAMA

**frogaranaman** (10): I wanna trauma dump on this comment but I won’t because my therapist told me to stop doing that 🙏

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this is the best song on the album and I wish I had another 11

**jaztinax** (10): honestly nobody gets me either

**jonnl2806** (10): I have cried to this song too many times to count and it wrecks me every time

**jsonphile** (10): okay why does SZA work so well on this song too?

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): SZA Swift ate

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): it’s giving Hold The Girl deep cut and I LOVE IT

**oscarbrierley1** (10): she's in her avril lavigne I'm with you bag and I'm living.

**passionfruits2** (10): THIS SLAYS WHAT IS LEFT OF YOU

**pastapixal** (10): love belting this song omg

**PhoneThePhoenix** (10): now that's a ballad!

**plastichaxan** (10): Me projecting this song into my current crush even though we have barely interacted and I do not even like him that much I’m just infatuated

**popularsong** (10): another fantastic vocal moment

**TiltControls** (10): Maybe not, but SZA does such a great job emoting with this track that it doesn't feel that way

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): such a nostalgic, vulnerable track

**TragicKingdom1** (10): this has the same sense of catharsis as the second half of happier than ever and as such i'm sure it'll dominate the rate in a similar fashion <3

**Treecoh** (10): got me butt naked at the MGMs

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Damn Sizzler making me emotional over lines like "balls deep butt naked at the MGM"

**cremeebrulee** (9.7): she's like that one friend who overshares way too much but you kinda love it because you're nosy as hell

**jasannn** (9.5): might just be the MV, this song makes me want to sing on the rooftops

**heysoupie** (9.3): how earnest, how relatable, i KNOW i would have listened to this song on REPEAT during any of my young love eras if it had been available to me.

**modulum83** (9.2): like how many times can i comment “she just like me fr” until i run out of ways to say it

**CrimsonROSET** (9): crying dancing gif

**fairytalehigh** (9): hearing SZA sing "had me butt-naked at the MGM" over a mazzy star type beat is one of the highest points on this album

**Frajer** (9): toxic horny queen

**horridhendy** (9): Simple but really pretty.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): her voice here, oh wow she ate up the angels

**nooodisaster** (9): me talking to my youtube recommended:

**shhhneak** (9): I held off on rating this song to watch the concert videos from her tour and I’m pleasantly surprised to announce that she can hit those high notes live! I would be gripping my chair in fear of a missed note.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): we love a mature aged hannah montana song!!

**wasian-invasion** (9): aw codependency can be sweet sometimes

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): this is the point where I just get confused by the album pacing and also this kinda sucks but i do love it although I don't think in good conscience i can go above a 9

**udontwannaknownoel** (8.7): Watch out Celine Dion

**shipperondeck** (8.6): "if im real i deserve less" :(

**jman457** (8.5): a strong acoustic ballad, reminds me a bit like Fade into You

**MassiveThief** (8.5): beautiful.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): only sza could sing a ballad with the lyric "hurry now baby stick it in"

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): it’s a good breather after the energy of F2F, but I’m not sure this song accomplishes anything the stretch from Blind to Gone Girl doesn’t

**Roxieloxie** (8.2): -... .- .-.. .-.. ... / -.. . . .--. / .. ... / -.-. .-. .- --.. -.-- / ... --.. .-

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): aww, I wish I had a girlfriend or a boyfriend to sing with.

**masttup** (8): jay z reference in the rate with Renaissance

**rfbeirut** (8): another fun swerve

**runaway3212** (8): wish I had any type of love

**vexastrae** (8): the sequencing of smoking on my ex pack to special shouldnt work but somehow it does, especially with this song immediately transitioning into conceited

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): the best of the next stretch of songs

**starla\_** (7.5): pretty instrumental, very country vibes

**emayzee** (7.4): there's something so distractingly camila cabello about this

**Birdseeding** (7): Another great hook in a questionably engaging production

#Get out of my head already

**Hulnia** (7): disney channel ass song

**intheaftermath** (7): so quirky so true

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): I was always confused why this was chosen as a single when there are better songs on the album. It's perfectly fine as an album track, but it isn't single material.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): taylor after she saw fan reception to lover’s first single

**Kayaking11116** (6): she's doing WHAT WITH JAY-Z? ON THE SAME RATE AS MISS BEYONCE?

**aakar528** (5): eh

**bluehxrizon** (5): [you were balls deep now we beefin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4BHHVEbdTM)

**Nagisoid** (5): Hi, Phantom by Rina Sawayama!

**vayyiqra** (5): Not sure if I'm vibing with the acoustic here 😔

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.9): ooh stripping this down puts her voice at the forefront and i just... do not like it

**bulforster** (4.6): too corny [1]

**Bordersz** (4.5): I don't get this song either.

**DaHumanTorch** (4): amazing lyrics and she sounds great but sonically this is just SO boring with very uninteresting melodies

**mimins** (3): the lyrics have been out of pocket for the whole album but this made me audibly go ???? unfortunately its also incredibly boring

**Stryxen** (2): everything sounds really clunky together, theyre not but her vocals just feel off key? Maybe it's the really weird mixing but they sound like they're recorded in different studios

**Awkward\_King** (1): im sorry but like girl shut UP we get it

**impla77** (6): Guys.. can we agree this is a bit too high? Sure its got great elements, yes the transition is seamless but cmon..

**ImADudeDuh** (5): I saw so many people praise this song a bunch, and I don't hear it. Yes, it transitions into BREAK MY SOUL well and "them karens just turned into terrorists" is one of the best lines in the rate, but what else does this song have? Beam verse has a catchy melody but outside of that, I just get nothing from this song. I don't even get energy!

=====

ImADudeDuh: #Solar Power (the renewable source)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “don’t get out of line” single-handedly reminded like-minded Americans not to deny their right to vote.

**akanewasright** (10): that milkshake sample fucking rules and I’m glad I still have that version downloaded

**Awkward\_King** (10): iednewmfre fso good

**cremeebrulee** (10): 117 seconds of dragging white people

**daythreeinmiami** (10): VOTING OUT 45 DO NOT GET OUT OF LINE AMERICA VOTE 2024.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): she’s just saying words but who cares this beat is sick

**joeeswift** (10): “cuz them Karen’s just turned into terrorists” is LYRIC OF THE YEAR

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): my milkshake brings all the bo- SUED

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This 3-track run os immaculate.

**passionfruits2** (10): simply needs to play right after cuff it. and needs break my soul after it. but that doesn't knock points.

**popularsong** (10): ON STAGE ROCKING IM STIR CRAZY actually my most listened song lmao i think ppl see it more as an intro to break my soul but not me!!

**runaway3212** (10): THE BEST INTERLUDE EVER

**vayyiqra** (10): I'm mostly commenting about the instrumental parts of this album but rest assured I'm noticing Bey's great vocals and the lyrics too 😯 but also I love the off-kilter melodies in this and a bit of Latin influence in the drums 😯 and also "Karens just turned into terrorists" is such a hard line

**PhoneThePhoenix** (9.9): the song fulfills its promise (has great energy)

**babadork** (9.3): I am trying really hard to not rate every song on the album ridiculously highly, but it is hard when even one of my least favorite songs includes amazing lyrics, Big Freedia, and Teena Marie.

**DaHumanTorch** (9.3): rip kelis

**1998tweety** (9): the way this ate up JoBros' lead single

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): that lead up to Big Freedia or someone else named like that screaming is soooo well-intergrated, like holy fuck, I almost became gay.

**frogaranaman** (9): criminal that this heater is less than two minutes long

**Mudkip1** (9): it'd be 10 with kelis still on the production

**nt96** (9): I know there’s some petty DJs playing Milkshake with this 💀

**Poydoo** (9): Beam is the only reason this song is a 9, without him it would be like a 6

**ReallyCreative** (9): it functions more as a bridge/interlude of the album as a whole so it’s going to go day 1 despite being more interesting than the majority of the other albums

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): ended hyperpop

**jonnl2806** (8.8): As one of the few people who actually enjoyed the Lion King soundtrack I'm glad Bey kept some of the influences scattered through the album

**shipperondeck** (8.8): this grew on me bc it's so cool

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): does what it needs to as an interlude but wow when Freedia comes in at the end aaaaaaaaaaaah

**heysoupie** (8.7): i was underwhelmed by this track in early listens, and wouldn’t think of it as substantial enough for a standalone listen… but it’s really grown on me; love the Beam vocals, the fun percussion (the Skrillex credit makes so much sense, and it’s so funny to think that THIS is the universe we ended up in when I think about what Sonny Moore was doing in like 2007.)

**modulum83** (8.7): accurate name

**Frajer** (8.5): got that big big energy

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): What this did for Break My Soul is what I need for my life

**fairytalehigh** (8.3): i just remember kelis freaking out about the "milkshake" sample and then them removing it and me not noticing a difference whatsoever

**moonshxne** (8.2): can i say i actually miss the "milkshake" sample 😶

**bogo** (8): yeah it's good

**just\_thonking** (8): I spent so long agonizing about whether to give this an 8 or an 8.5 and then remembered I am playing a game on the internet with zero stakes

**nooodisaster** (8): "Cause them Karens just turned into terrorists" legit adds 3 points to this song

**rfbeirut** (8): cause them karens just turned into terrorists EXACTLY

**vexastrae** (8): legitimately elevates break my soul, hearing the big freedia sample build up at the end for the first time is like seeing a contestant in a game show make all the right moves at the right time

**wasian-invasion** (8): oh so she credits all 400 of her songwriters but not dumbo and babar on backing instrumentals? the pachydermophobia of it all

**udontwannaknownoel** (7.9): I have no idea what a derringer is

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): taking a point off for the Kelis removal that sample actually made the song so much better

#Solar Power (the album)

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): solid interlude, if it were longer it'd probably be one of my favorite tracks on the album

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): When the worst track on your album is an interlude that's how you know you've made it

**bluehxrizon** (6): Pretty much I would let KELIS know that she is a fat cunt and, um the samples that she gave me were not something that I would particularly buy for myself. They were old maiden type of samples, and she said that those samples were meant to be worn on a beautiful track so

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): not bad but def one of the lower points on the album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): beam is kinda outselling here

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): milkshake is the better song i'm just saying oop

**TiltControls** (6): I GOT ENERGY

**Nagisoid** (5): You got big dick energy

#This song transitioned? Good for them!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Hearing the Cuff It-Energy-Break My Soul stretch for the first time…like I died a few times.

**jman457** (10): Interludephobia will unjustly slander this, but it glides way too smoothly from Cuff it into BMS

**Stryxen** (10): i had a phase of looping this in summer. Addictive chorus and so many iconic lyrics - and then the freedia transition… genuinely the musical moment of the year

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): maybe songs sub 2 minutes can be good!! and that transition wew

**ignitethephoenix** (9.8): this is such a good transition piece

**jasannn** (9): I still think of it more as interlude between the two "singles" but it's a damn good interlude

**mimins** (9): the transition from this song to break my soul fixed my back pain i'm so serious

**Roxieloxie** (9): one of the most insane interludes and set ups for a transitions

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): the best part of this song is the transition, and yet it's still an 8.8, that speaks to just how cunt the transition is

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): ridiculously underrated, it's a fantastic transition track between cuff it and break my soul

**starla\_** (8.5): mild interludephobia but this absolutely slaps. It's a good reset between the massive bangers that are Cuff It and Break My Soul

**intheaftermath** (8): wish this one was longer. As soon as I got into it, it ended. Killer track transition though

**CrimsonROSET** (8): put me in the ‘transition good’ segment

**hikk** (8): transition

**horridhendy** (8): This is the perfect sandwich track between two powerhouse tracks on the album. As a standalone, it doesn't hold up quite as much - but it's still really good.

**Kayaking11116** (8): would probably be lower but that transition into Break My Soul is show stopping

**nick1372** (8): THE TRANSITION TO BMS!!! BEST 20 SECONDS OF THE DECADE!!!!!!!

**MassiveThief** (7.5): I feel bad bc this song exists (in my mind) as the predule to Break My Soul, but I mean... that transition is just EVERYTHING

**musical\_pyn** (7): yes the transition is incredible but the track just doesn't do it for me on its own

**Shelly\_AO29** (6): Not the biggest fan of this particular track. The only reason this isn't lower is the brilliant transition into BMS (also the Karen terrorist lyric).

**xqra** (5.7): It does its job amazingly as a transition between two of the best songs on the album, but it's kind of weird to listen to as a standalone track

**dreamingpastel** (5): Cute transition from Cuff It to Break My Soul

**FlavaSavaVandal** (5): if i was rating the transition to break my soul it’d be a 10

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): I’m just lucky that it’s sandwiched between two better songs on here.

**aakar528** (3): overrated (points just for that transition)
