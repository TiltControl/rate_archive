#**Lana Del Rey - Norman Fucking Rockwell!**
 
Does she even need an introduction? Lizzy Grant, professional known as Lana Del Rey, is an American singer-songwriter whose glamorous and cinematic persona with hidden sarcasm propelled her to stardom back in 2012 with *Born to Die*, her first studio album. Her first four albums tell vivid stories of tragic romance, drugs, and despair, with plenty of apt references to pop culture in the 1950s and 60s. While most of her older music can be classified as art pop and chamber pop, *Ultraviolence* gave us a glimpse of her more rock-oriented and psychedelic side, winning over many fans in the process. Unfortunately, a lot of critics dismissed her due to some [missteps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zrvD-o8cII) in her career early on, and this held her back in a small sense.
 
While critics began to appreciate her sound with the R&B and dream pop-tinged *Lust for Life*, it was *Norman Fucking Rockwell!* that catapulted her to universal acclaim amongst music listeners and critics. Working alongside noted producer Jack Antonoff of fun. and Bleachers fame, she created a sprawling record that fused together elements of soft rock, dream pop, and neo-psychedelia while evoking imagery of 60s Americana in the context of our present day. With Lana finally combining her own personal outlook with her sarcastic persona and this new sound, critics couldn't help but feel that she had finally found the best version of herself as an artist. In a glowing review with a score of 9.4, Pitchfork writer Jenn Pelly stated that Lana had "established herself as one of America's greatest living songwriters". At the end of 2019, Pitchfork declared that *Norman Fucking Rockwell!* was their album of the year and additionally placed it at #19 on their decade-end album list.

#**Weyes Blood - Titanic Rising**
 
Weyes Blood is the stage name of singer-songwriter Natalie Mering, who has been releasing albums professionally for over a decade. She was raised in a strict Christian household, and was influenced by church music as a child and teen. After discarding the toxic belief system that she grew up with and going to college in Oregon, she started releasing music under her stage name, which references the famous Southern Gothic novel by Flannery O'Connor. Her early albums contained elements of psychedelic folk and chamber folk with an ethereal sound. Her semi-breakthrough arrived in 2016 with *Front Row Seat to Earth*, an ethereal and calming folk album that received many accolades from music publications, including Pitchfork, who gave the album its Best New Music tag.
 
Mering's major breakthrough came in 2019, when she released *Titanic Rising*, an epic baroque and art pop record that explores topics of love, existentialism, and the unconscious mind. She was influenced by 70s soft rock, and this shines through in the songwriting, production, and vocals, all of which are reminiscent of renowned acts such as The Carpenters and Joni Mitchell. This album was met with universal acclaim by critics and fans, with Pitchfork giving it an 8.5 and writer Quinn Moreland stating that this album was "a grand, sentimental ode to living and loving in the shadow of doom." *Titanic Rising* placed 9th in their year-end album list for 2019, along with placing 143rd on their decade-end album list.

#**FKA twigs - MAGDALENE**
 
British singer-songwriter and producer Tahliah Barnett, also known as FKA twigs, has been making cutting-edge art pop mixed with alternative R&B and electronic since the earlier part of the 2010s. Her first two EPs, *EP1* and *EP2*, were uniquely atmospheric and ethereal collections of songs that captivated listeners. However, her first studio album, simply titled *LP1*, quickly turned her into a critical darling in 2014, with its futuristic and wonky sound mixed with more sensual tracks such as "Two Weeks". Her third EP, *M3LL155X*, showcased her darker and glitchier side, receiving more praise.
 
After years of releasing little content, FKA twigs came back forcefully with *MAGDALENE*, a harrowing concept album about heartbreak that seamlessly combines the previous sounds she had experimented with, such as glitch pop, alternative r&b, and electronic. Along with the musical component, she made sure to incorporate dance of all forms (notably, pole) into her videos and live performances as well. Critical reactions to this album were nearly unanimous: music publications adored the record. With a score of 9.4, Pitchfork writer
Julianne Escobedo Shepherd exclaimed that this record was "not just on the vanguard of pop, it’s in a breathtaking class of its own." Even though it was released after they came out with their decade-end album list, Pitchfork made sure to sing their praises once more on the year-end album list for 2019, in which this album placed 2nd out of 50 records.

#**Rules**
 
I'm almost done, don't worry... Please pay attention to this, because if you don't follow the rules, your scores will not count unless you PM me and fix them.
 
* You must rate **EVERY** song in this rate, no exceptions.
 
* Each song can receive a score between 1 and 10, and decimal points up to 1 place are allowed (e.g. 5.5, 7.3, 9.9 - NOT 5.55 or 9.99).
 
* You may give a 0 and/or an 11 to only one song each, and ***your 0 must be paired with a comment***; 0s and 11s are not required. If you are missing scores, give me multiple 0s and/or 11s, or give me messy decimals, your scores will not be counted unless you fix those mistakes.
 
* Your scores are not confidential - they will likely be shared when the results are revealed, so be sure to rate accurately! Feel free to campaign for any song that you love, but do not let things get too heated.
 
* Once again, use [this link](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=bbfan132&subject=2019%20Ultimate%20Pitchfork%20Acclaim%20Rate&message=Username%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Norman%20Fucking%20Rockwell%21%0A%0ANorman%20fucking%20Rockwell%3A%0A%0AMariners%20Apartment%20Complex%3A%0A%0AVenice%20Bitch%3A%0A%0AFuck%20it%20I%20love%20you%3A%0A%0ADoin%27%20Time%3A%0A%0ALove%20song%3A%0A%0ACinnamon%20Girl%3A%0A%0AHow%20to%20disappear%3A%0A%0ACalifornia%3A%0A%0AThe%20Next%20Best%20American%20Record%3A%0A%0AThe%20greatest%3A%0A%0ABartender%3A%0A%0AHappiness%20is%20a%20butterfly%3A%0A%0Ahope%20is%20a%20dangerous%20thing%20for%20a%20woman%20like%20me%20to%20have%20-%20but%20I%20have%20it%3A%0A%0ALooking%20For%20America%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Titanic%20Rising%0A%0AA%20Lot%27s%20Gonna%20Change%3A%0A%0AAndromeda%3A%0A%0AEveryday%3A%0A%0ASomething%20to%20Believe%3A%0A%0ATitanic%20Rising%3A%0A%0AMovies%3A%0A%0AMirror%20Forever%3A%0A%0AWild%20Time%3A%0A%0APicture%20Me%20Better%3A%0A%0ANearer%20to%20Thee%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20MAGDALENE%0A%0Athousand%20eyes%3A%0A%0Ahome%20with%20you%3A%0A%0Asad%20day%3A%0A%0Aholy%20terrain%20%28feat.%20Future%29%3A%0A%0Amary%20magdalene%3A%0A%0Afallen%20alien%3A%0A%0Amirrored%20heart%3A%0A%0Adaybed%3A%0A%0Acellophane%3A%0A%0AEND) to submit your scores!
 
* If you wish to edit your scores or add/remove comments at any point, feel free to PM me and I will edit them for you.
 
* If I notice that you are giving certain albums an abnormally low rating without justifying your scores with comments, I have the right to question you and potentially remove your scores altogether if I deem that you are trying to actively sabotage the rate.
 
* You are highly encouraged (not required) to provide comments along with your scores! However, please make sure that you format your comments properly. This is how you properly format a comment:
 
* > hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but i have it: 11 thank you queen lana for giving me hope today
 
* This is how NOT to properly format a comment:
 
* > holy terrain (feat. Future): 0: this terrain is too rugged for me
 
* > Happiness is a butterfly: Happiness is when my 0 ends up making this song place 34th in the rate
 
* > Nearer to Thee: (0) this song makes me nearer to sleep

* You may also write comments for the album as a whole! Just put a colon next to the album title and then write your comment. For example, "Norman Fucking Rockwell!: i love this album!!!!!!!" (but with more effort).
