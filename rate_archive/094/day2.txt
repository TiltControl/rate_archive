This song was almost going to be cut on day 1, but luckily, enough people raised the score up to the point where it is now the first song out on day 2. The trip hop beat and her soft delivery are intoxicating, despite the rather straightforward nature of this song. When I listen to this song, it brings me into an unknown state of mind and I’m drawn in for those 5 minutes. I wish this had a slightly higher placement, but I’m happy that it made it to #17.

---

**CritneySpearz** (11): her (2nd) best song wbk

**1998tweety** (10): Idk as a POC this just hits so much harder. I know my interpretation isn't what Lana intended, but wow it just fits so well.

**bibliosquire** (10): whew this song is IT

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): invented spices spice girls could never

**DaHumanTorch** (10): tied for my favorite on the album. the vocals in the chorus are just breathtaking, I get transported every single time. also lyrically one of the strongest on the album imo

**gannade** (10): Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out... i win

**jlaca123** (10): Yes

**leviswift13** (10): if you hold me without hurting me, you'd be the first that ever did. period.

**Nickl00** (10): the power that this song has is unmatched. And that outro is really something

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the atmosphere projected by this song is simply ethereal

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Lana teased this song so much but the wait paid off. This joins the club of certified Lana bangers along with OTTR, West Coast, Freak and Cherry

**realboxwood** (10): Doing this rate after Lana's entire "women who say yes but men hear no" breakdown makes this hit different in a way that makes it even more poignant

**sarcasticsobs** (10): still in pain

**skargardin** (10): She did that again

**vhqv1997** (10): That outro got me ascending, except for the part before it where the instrumentals kinda sound like farts

**waluigiest** (10): thinking about GloZell in this moment

**wavingwolves** (10): the chorus of this thing really destroys me. it makes me feel instantly miserable... but blissful

**Yatcho** (10): THE LYRICS HIT TOO CLOSE TO HOME

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): this song left me speechless ........ "i win", "if you hold me without hurting me", the outro.... a masterpiece

**cyborglilith** (9.5): im shidding and farding and crying and cumming rn

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): These lyrics are so depressing and I want to give this a 10 but some parts just feel a little repetitive in a way that doesn’t quite work

**koolkatkeeley** (9): that outro is heavenly.

**survivorjdmarina** (9): This is cool but it kinda sounds like a LFL reject

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.7): Dentyne Fire Spicy Cinnamon flavoured gum is by far the best gum flavour, and this song's good too

**fishingfor8** (8): This was the point when first listening that I really liked the album. It's a solid track, that line "If you hold me without hurting me, you'll be the first who ever did" is really good.

**Stryxen** (8): me when my friend asks which spice gets its distinct sweet and woody flavour from the molecule cinnamaldehyde

**vintagebathingsuit** (8): atmospheric, stunning. lyrics aren't maybe as good as they could be though.

**WeastofEden44** (8): The second half of the song is *chef’s kiss”

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): be GAY do DRUGS

**BatesNorman** (7): anyone remember the cinnamon challenge?

**cubascastrodistrict** (7): I appreciate the production change for this song, it helps add some variety to the album. However, I think lyrically and thematically this is probably the most boring song here. Compared to the complicated dynamics of the other songs, this one feels fairly surface level to me.

**skaiansightseer** (7): i get this confused with "California"

**thatgreekguyraul** (7): I like the kerosene imagery.

**twat\_brained** (7): I've not paid attention to the lyrics to this, all I remember is "kerosene", "boy", "you", and "I'm your cinnamon girl", and some vocalizations. And the outro to me is Lana trying to recreate Halsey's "Drive" when she really doesn't need to.

**vayyiqra** (7): I wanna live with a cinnamon girl / I could be happy the rest of my life / With a cinnamon girl /A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night /  You see us together, chasing the moonlight / My cinnamon girl This song is not as good as that song, which I was surprised absolutely no one on Popheads seems to have heard of, but then I am Canadian. It's better than I remember though, especially the last chorus and everything after it.

**fadedblue09** (6.6): It’s...fine? The moaning in the post-chorus annoys me a bit and some of the lyrics confuse me but I wouldn’t say it’s bad.

**freav** (6): Not a fan of the song but I like how it builds.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5.5): A pretty song, just a little too long and repetitive

**chillbumps5** (4): reminds me of old Lana, the lazy trip-hop beat gives me PTSD (yes i do think Born to Die is garbage.)

**bespectacIed** (1): pussy put his ass to sleep now he calling me ~~Nyquil~~ Cinnamon Girl

If I have to be honest… I think this might be my least favorite track on the album. However, when an album is as good as NFR is (in my opinion), this being the worst track is probably a good thing. The vocal melodies can get kind of irritating at points for me and by the end, I’m kind of bored, but the song still works within the context of the album.

---

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Everything about this song is perfection. I could write paragraphs about how much I love this song. The way it transitions from this really dreamy, spacy, lucious sound and ends with this frantic, chaotic outro with lyrics overlapping each other really reminds me of that feeling when you know in your heart what you want to do, and at first, you have such a burning passion for it, but slowly anxiety and doubts star to appear and slowly take over your mind, and you've got so many thoughts racing at once it's hard to figure them out. It really just evokes a mood in me. Also the digital version is much better, idk what was going on with the physical version but it sounds unfinished

**Awkward\_King** (10): if i wasn't so fucked up i think i'd fuck you all the time is god-tier lanacore lyrics for me

**BatesNorman** (10): the vocals ooh yeah

**bibliosquire** (10): the ending of this song!! It’s so cinematic

**bulforster** (10): The driving percussion here gives the song a backbone which complements Lana's airy, carefree vocals really well.

**cremeebrulee** (10): the lil instrumental at the end? chef's kiss

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is such a smash. one of my favorites on the album

**fishingfor8** (10): I listened to this album so much and the fact that this isn't even top 3 for this album

**gannade** (10): dream a little dream of me the actual song outpeaked but this is pretty good too

**plastichaxan** (10): bitch this completes one of the best 3 (or 4)-song run in history

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i worship the way this song is built and layered

**shesdoingyoga** (10): “And if I wasn’t so fucked up I think I’d fuck you all the time” is my favorite line from this but I love everything about the song

**skargardin** (10): It's just one excellent song after the other

**vintagebathingsuit** (9.5): why can't she just say love properly? smh adore the rest of the song though.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): A really lovely euphoric song with an excellent melody, but doesn't quite reach musical catharsis

**bespectacIed** (9): hmm very good

**leviswift13** (9): lana del rey singing "dancing to a pop song" is my permanent aesthetic

**Nickl00** (9): her vocals are amazing and the way the song builds and then comes together is one of the best parts of the album

**rotating3Dtext** (9): imovedtocaliforniabutit’sjustastateofminditturnsouteverywhereyougoyoutakeryourselfthat’snotalie

**skaiansightseer** (9): the different versions of this confuse me-- either way they bang

**vhqv1997** (9): Lana the mumble rapper

**waluigiest** (9): the delivery of the eighth note prechorus melody...... WOW it’s so frantic and anxious so so good

**1998tweety** (8.5): This one took a minute to grow on me, but now it hits.

**jlaca123** (8.5): Great song! I feel like it loses some steam in the chorus, though.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.5): Tough to follow Venice Bitch, but this does a good job in keeping the momentum going

**almdudler26** (8): thought this was gonna be my lowest score on the album but listened to it again and it's acc v good

**koolkatkeeley** (8): I really dooooooooooooo.

**wavingwolves** (8): i always understand "fuck it i like you" instead that what the title says?

**Stryxen** (7.9): I would have given this an 8, but you need a comma in your title, luv x

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): I’m surprised I haven’t come back to this track much. It’s not bad but not my favourite.

**thatgreekguyraul** (7): The production is great but the I despise the way she pronounces the song title. It sounds like her speech is so slurred, perhaps that is something that relates to the song, but it does not work for me.

**twat\_brained** (7): I distinctly hear "I luh you"; the title is misleading

**vayyiqra** (7): That "moved to California" part is so catchy.

**chillbumps5** (6.5): the verses are good but the chorus gee I don’t know

**motherstyx** (6): I can’t stand the way she sings “you”, it doesn’t sound good. Other than that, I like the song

**realboxwood** (6): I know it's kind of Lana's thing but man does she sing this like she just got her wisdom teeth removed

**static\_int\_husp** (6): most is okay but the way she says the title in the chorus is kina grating

**plantp0wer** (5): fuck it i luh u

**untutorable** (4.5): she certainly made some vocal choices on this one.... idk it never clicked with me

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (4): Ugh it really is her delivery that gets to me, I can understand others loving it but it is so not my thing. The "luh you" sounds forced to me and I don't love the melody of this one as much as others on the album.

**fadedblue09** (2): The chorus is super hideous and got irritating real quick.

I really wish this wasn’t only #15, because to me, it sounds like a wonderfully triumphant sunshine pop track that is filled with warmth and sarcasm, along with an excellent music video that plays off of horror tropes/films in a hilarious way. I’m just glad to see it in the top 15...

---

**FKAmeow** (11): best song of the decade imo

**skaiansightseer** (11): the song that got me through 2019

**TragicKingdom1** (11): literally timeless

**wavingwolves** (11): i love when i listen to a song and my brain immediately produces serotonin because of the sound of it! like yes, bitch, make me happy!!!! i also love the beach boys vibe and how the lyrics have that nice balance between heartfelt and playful

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (10): This song is so special. An easy 10.

**bespectacIed** (10): Truly the best song that has ever been created by humankind. If it wasn't for Twigs, I would have given this an 11. I wanna give this an 11. A 10 istoo low. Probs my most played song in the rate. Damn it, I need a love everyday too :(

**Brendon-Urine** (10): Three 10's to open the album hell yeah. No wonder Weyes Blood loves movies so much, this sounds like the soundtrack to a movie. It's so peppy and moving, and the final moments are perfect - "lay down my guy" with those massive strings in the background are just incredible.

**bulforster** (10): The first time I heard this was the two lines of the chorus in the last rate trailer and that was enough to make me want to check out the album and do this rate.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): it’s all about that chaotic outro ladies! she really gave us a pastoral headbanger!

**cubascastrodistrict** (10): this kind of piano chamber pop is just absolute crack to me, and this song hits it so perfectly. The slow build of the chorus is brilliant, not to mention how good the lyricism is here.

**hunnybee12** (10): the campy music video is perfect

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): It's a testament to how good Andromeda is that this is just the second best song on Titanic Rising. Everyday is a jaunty joy, reminiscent of the best songs of the '60s. I love the way it continuously builds and adds layer upon magical layer, culminating in a whirling final minute. I cannot see-eee-ee

**leviswift13** (10): "true love is making a comeback for only half of us, the rest just feel bad" is one of the greatest lines ever written. will shakespeare, pack up your gig girl.

**plantp0wer** (10): Main pop girl

**samf79** (10): like a pirate sea shanty, but distinctly modern. the lyrics are fantastic. One of my favorites on the album.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): yes yes yes yes yes

**jlaca123** (9.7): Really fun, sonically

**fadedblue09** (9.5): One of my favorites here so far. It still sounds vintage, but has some contemporary elements (sonically, lyrically) that makes it stand out .

**InternetDude19** (9.2): True love is making a comeback.

**BatesNorman** (9): love is a dangerous message to spread in the age of social distancing

**koolkatkeeley** (9): I love the ease of this song especially the chorus and the building and collapse of the outro. This song is a testament to the power of Weyes blood.

**survivorjdmarina** (9): I really like how snappy this is. It sounds really folksy and chamber poppy.

**thatgreekguyraul** (9): Very upbeat and the lyrics are quite witty.

**WeastofEden44** (9): Indie BAWP

**Yatcho** (9): A jaunty bop with an amazing music video

**twat\_brained** (8.2): now it sounds like Feist's "1234"; are we sure Weyes isn't Canadian?

**Stryxen** (8.1): I can’t wait to walk happily down the street to this also this song makes me feel a perfect balance of anxiety and fun!

**bibliosquire** (8): I know people ride or die for this but it wasn’t as enjoyable for me

**shesdoingyoga** (8): I listened to a lot of The Beatles as a kid because my dad liked them so would have them on often, and this song kind of reminds me of their music

**waluigiest** (8): I get A LOT of Rufus Wainwright energy from this

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is kinda cute, but I feel like it could've done more. The outro is kinda meh too.

**heckwes** (7): boring

**Nickl00** (7): it’s pretty good but coming after andromeda is hard

**realboxwood** (7): Part of the reason it took me so long to get into this album was it's tendency to simplistic or kind of clumsy lyricism, and this song feels like one of the worst offenders on that front

**skargardin** (7): Not quite up to par with the rest of the album but it is good still

**fishingfor8** (5.5): This sounds like an Amy Winehouse song but it doesn't work with her voice at all.

**DaHumanTorch** (4): i feel bad but i really didn’t like this. i hated the instrumentation so much. it just didn’t click

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): Bouncy and cute, melody feels flat though and once again unmemorable

**vayyiqra** (0): Sorry, this is the kind of retro pop I do not care for : / it sounds like the Monkees. I like the coda part though.

Here we are with another Lana song out, and I’m not mad at this. I remember really enjoying the snippets that I had heard back in 2018 or so, but when I listened to the final version, some of my favorite parts seemed to have been altered. Despite this, I still enjoy the song a lot, and I’m happy to see it end up at #14.

---

**wanderingimpromptu3** (11): Exquisite song with haunting melodies (almost) throughout. Some stunning lyrics, "If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst that can happen to a girl that's already hurt" and "[happiness] escapes from my hands into moonlight" especially. The only thing keeping this song from perfection is that the chorus is not on the same level either melodically or lyrically, just much more generic than the rest.

**BatesNorman** (10): flutter flutter flap flap

**bespectacIed** (10): Actually the best song in existence. This is an 11. Lana at her peak, vocally and lyrically. That serial killer line, that chorus...4 1/2 minutes of pure bliss

**cubascastrodistrict** (10): the production here is just perfect. The choice of just doing piano with some electric guitar was brilliant, and gives the whole song this amazing lift.

**cyborglilith** (10): I SAID DON'T BE A JERK DON'T CALL ME A TAXI

**DaHumanTorch** (10): best on the album along with cinnamon girl. this is top 10 lana ever for me. also these lyrics are DAGGERS

**Geography3** (10): if home with you didn’t get the top score this would

**koolkatkeeley** (10): this was the song on the album I was most excited for because of the snippet Lana poster and it surpassed my expectations. It’s simple, but stunning.

**leviswift13** (10): the serial killer lyric is the best thing she has ever written

**Nickl00** (10): god this is an emotional song and I never get tired of it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): who hurt Jack in a taxi?

**shaniquasharkesha** (10): Honestly one of the best Lana songs ever IMO, i cried when she sang the "dont be a jerk..." part, it's super emotive vocally

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Sometimes I wish that this was the real ending of the album because it just feels like the emotional climax the rest of the album is building to

**skargardin** (10): She's really out here making me cry again this late into the album

**Stryxen** (10): an easy 11 contender. what a song

**wavingwolves** (10): when i listen to this i feel like i just had very hot sex with a emotionally unavaiable and mildly manipulating narcissist that called me an uber 10 minutes after finishing inside of me

**jlaca123** (9.5): Beautiful

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): Lana sounds so passionate here and I love it

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.2): I love that two of the best songs are held off until the end of the album. The way this builds and releases tension is great. Tragic and beautiful

**1998tweety** (9): Good Lorde the chorus on this is a shoot, the rest is just kinda okay though.

**bibliosquire** (9): another sweet and beautiful song

**fishingfor8** (9): Not much more to say about this album that I don't say in other comments. It's really strong, It's Lana at her peak and honestly top 3 favorite projects of 2019. It's a shame these other albums are competing against Lana because everything wrong with them is magnified 100x because of how much I love this album.

**heckwes** (9): dont be a jerk

**waluigiest** (9): do you want me or are you gay

**zadooi** (9): The lyrics can be a little cringy at times, but still a bop.

**bulforster** (8.5): I really want to like this one more because I love the lyrics and the swells but it feels like they dissipate before fully peaking and you can hear her trying but Lana's singing doesn't quite match the dynamics of the instrumental for me.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Gets extra points for showing her vocal range.

**skaiansightseer** (8): the serial killer line is incredible

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): The writing's a little weak for me but the lyrics are still awesome. "If he's a serial killer then what's the worst that can happen to a girl that's already hurt"

**WeastofEden44** (7): It’s good, just not a standout imo

**Awkward\_King** (6): if he's a cop then what's the worst that can happen to a girl who's already hurt

**twat\_brained** (6): the allegory is lost on me but I like how pleasant the music is

**freav** (5): Lana could have considered making the album a bit shorter

**thatgreekguyraul** (5): Better than the previous song but still relatively standard.

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (4.5): I don't like so many of the lyrics (which sucks because I love the "don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi" part) and I don't like her articulation.

**kappyko** (4): why is she yelling

**vayyiqra** (4): :pensive: and it's pretty but something about it doesn't hit for me.

**vhqv1997** (3): This song is 4 minutes too long, it's literally just Lana reading a poem

This was another song that moved all over the place throughout the rate, but it ended up placing pretty high. This track is a stunning intro to the album, and sets the tone for the rest of the album in a very fitting way. I’m glad to see it up at #13, even if it missed out on the top 10.

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): oh man, THIS is how you open an album! it’s like exploring a submerged cathedral in the best possible way. I feel such an overwhelming wave of several things every time I listen to it; existential dread, melancholy, grief, but most of all hope. it’s incredibly soothing, and no closing line will ever take my breath like “let me change my words/show me where it hurts.” it’s an entire journey and such a powerful piece of art. it’s also incredibly timely; a lot HAS changed even in just the time since this album came out.

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (10): Such an amazing song to open the album with and really sets the tone. It's beautiful and sweeping in her way.

**BatesNorman** (10): wow so pretty

**bibliosquire** (10): I have no words

**Brendon-Urine** (10): This song is a masterclass is songwriting. The way it builds, reaches a climax, and backs off is masterful.

**freav** (10): Natalie's so good at writing melodies

**leviswift13** (10): holduplemmeputagoddamnmarkTOIT

**mudkip1** (10): her vocals are so emotive and wondrous ugh i love her

**realboxwood** (10): thanks mom

**skaiansightseer** (10): a beautiful intro-- stately without being overdone or staid.

**skargardin** (10): This is how you open an album, yes ma'am! breathtaking

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Fuck this is one of the best opening tracks I’ve heard in a long time

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): The production is very reminiscent of Queen. I love the instrumentation in the outro.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): my soundtrack to many sad car rides

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): wow why can't we give more than one eleven? i don't remember this song being so stunning when i first listened to it but maybe it's because i'm very emotional about everything changing in my life right now.

**wavingwolves** (10): listening to this song is the most successful form of therapy i know

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.7): So beautiful it's hurting my feelings! Best opener, baroque majesty, nostalgic and soaring

**bulforster** (9.5): I know this is not what she meant but "Get off your knees" is not hitting my ears very well in this particular moment, love the song otherwise.

**fishingfor8** (9.5): Best song on the album. It justifies its length, she uses her emotionless voice to her advantage and the musical elements really justifies it.

**jlaca123** (9.5): Absolutely beautiful

**Stryxen** (9.5): this is MY dramatic character moment, I get to choose the music

**1998tweety** (9): Beautiful opener, love the retro vibes.

**Awkward\_King** (9): natalie bernie bro

**bespectacIed** (9): Great opener.

**koolkatkeeley** (9): I think this is the best opener out of all three albums.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): The lyrics of this one have been hitting differently with the events of the last few months

**WeastofEden44** (9): The way this song builds with the strings is BRILLIANT

**plastichaxan** (8.5): i transcend everytime i start to listen to this album

**DaHumanTorch** (8): this felt very cinematic and was a great opener. the lyrics really resonated with me and it was overall a gorgeous song

**Nickl00** (8): the emotion on the chorus is incredible

**waluigiest** (8): this is glamorous and dramatic and a really great introduction

**twat\_brained** (7.3): this album's gonna put me to sleep innit

**fadedblue09** (7): Solid, atmospheric opener but not very stunning or anything.

**CritneySpearz** (4): A lot is gonna change, except for my opinion that most of this album is a snooze fest

**vayyiqra** (4): A weird, slightly dissonant opener. I'm never sure if I like it or not.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): Unmemorable, boring

I first heard this song on YouTube, in a video of her performing it live long before the album came out. I was instantly drawn to the song, but that bridge was something else, especially when she fell to the ground in that performance… While the bridge isn’t quite as strong as it was in that performance, the song is still just as emotionally gripping, and it takes me on a ride whenever I listen to it.

---

**marryem** (11): the best song on this rate and mayhaps the best song ever released methinks...

**zadooi** (11): The way Twigs sings the post-chorus is the most painful thing in music since forever.

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (10): Yet another 10.

**Awkward\_King** (10): its so pretty

**bespectacIed** (10): And the first bitch I'm gonna smack is robert pattinson

**bibliosquire** (10): when I tell you I sobbed for two hours listening solely to this song

**bulforster** (10): I love this twist on a piano ballad, the production manages to be futuristic and interesting while maintaining a focus on supporting the vulnerability of the vocals.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the song exploded episode over this really made me appreciate it so much more

**enofisenough** (10): ... to making me cry

**Geography3** (10): my second fave on the album

**hunnybee12** (10): <3 E>

**laurent1683** (10): : I can't stand being alone any longer, but this gives me the hope i need, even if it is depressing.

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): The back half of the album's stronger than the first half for me, and this is absolutely gorgeous and heartbreaking at the same time. Best mirror song in the rate, and it has continued to grow on me since I first heard it

**leviswift13** (10): so close to my 11 but another song just BARELY edged it out. wow. what a song. the chord progression feels stolen from forever ago but also the future? her voice is so fragile and delicate and sad. these lyrics i mean what the fuck!! "it's all for the gain, it's all for the lovers trying to fuck away the pain" and "but i'm never gonna give, though i'm probably gonna think about you all the time. and for the lovers who found a mirrored heart, they just remind me i'm without you." i'm baby

**realboxwood** (10): Fuck Robert Pattinson, all my homies hate Robert Pattinson

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This one hurts. The lyrics are emotional and sadly relatable, and the way she sings “fuck away the pain” cuts deep

**skaiansightseer** (10): i heard her play this live the night the album came out and it ripped me from my body

**Stryxen** (10): fallen alien – mirrored heart – daybed is a combo that makes me ascend, I’m literally levitating right now

**survivorjdmarina** (10): It’s so slinky and elastic, and an emotional, heart wrencher of a track.

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Beautiful lyrics and I love the harsh bridge. The bridge is so angelic and heart-wrenching.

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): jesus this is so emotional and beautiful.

**waluigiest** (10): beautiful lyrics and the stripped down parts are so stunning. I think the final 3 track run is absolute perfection.

**wavingwolves** (10): i'm sure that throwing a rock at me repeatedly would be less painful than making me listen to this (in a good way!!!!!)

**1998tweety** (9.5): Beautiful, this song is so raw. The vocals and lyrics hit hard.

**rickikardashian** (9.5): i actually love this, but the part that is just an explosion is not my thing

**twat\_brained** (9.2): I'm about to start stanning

**DaHumanTorch** (9): stunning - the lyrics really pierce deep, you can really feel her emotion with every word. it’s near the bottom of my list for this album but i mean every song here is amazing so that’s not saying much

**fishingfor8** (9): I think it’s my favorite song on the album. Unlike the other mirror song in the rate, this has enough happening to justify it can slip on the background. This song is also a little bit less shocking and sticks with me in my day to day. And that’s how I need my music to be.

**samf79** (9): really heartwrenching. Makes you feel all the feelings

**Yatcho** (9): Am I the only one crying? No? good

**jlaca123** (8.7): Starts a bit slow, but gets a lot better -- I really like how it progresses.

**fadedblue09** (8): Doesn’t go hard as the other songs but her vocal range is well-displayed so I really can’t complain.

**koolkatkeeley** (8): this song just came at the perfect time in my life. Thank you twigs.

**Nickl00** (8): a little forgettable, but still pretty amazing

**plantp0wer** (8): sad boi hours

**WeastofEden44** (8): crying emoji

**BatesNorman** (7.5): mirror forever

**vayyiqra** (6): It starts off nice and then near the end it degenerates into some awful moaning over clanging noises. I could do without that part.

**cyborglilith** (4): very forgettable

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3.5): I like the idea and the lyrics but don't find it pleasant to listen to, too much upper register

I must admit that I was kind of surprised to see this end up just outside of the top 10, but when there are as many phenomenal tracks as there are in this rate, a few of those special tracks were bound to miss out. This song admittedly speaks for itself, though producers such as Nicolas Jaar and Skrillex(!) (along with twigs herself) help make this track shine.

---

**InternetDude19** (11): The vocals are incredible emotive, the production is fantastic, and the song has an actually hook. Every time I listen to this song, it still hits just as much as the first time I heard it.

**4Roux** (10): Her and Skrillex work so well together!

**bespectacIed** (10): Twigs giving in to her sadness instead of trying to make sense of it like she does on the rest of her discography ... on a glitchy electronic beat ... orgasm

**bibliosquire** (10): where is the music video

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): it IS a sad day for sure

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i love how dark and cinematic this is. the bridge is one of my favorite moments in the entire album. i loved the drop too, i know drops can tend to be generic but this really kept twigs’ experimental / signature flare and it worked really well

**fadedblue09** (10): Omg I wasn’t expecting a BANGER on this album. That drop sent me into a trance. Probably the closest thing to a “Two Weeks” on this record.

**koolkatkeeley** (10): this was almost my eleven because it’s a tour de force of emotion and being somber. It just whips you around in every direction til you give up and face the fact that it’s a sad day for sure.

**leviswift13** (10): this is IT!!! this feels like the alien witch sister of hard feelings. it IS a sad day for sure.

**Nickl00** (10): it was not a sad day when a hear this song

**rotating3Dtext** (10): i love the melodies here

**skaiansightseer** (10): the switch from eerie atomspherics to trap drums and then back again-- the sheer range of textures on this album!!

**skargardin** (10): END me

**Stryxen** (10): sometimes it just is a sad day for sure :’(

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Love the lyrics, especially the third verse.

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): the melody is so haunting, wow.

**wavingwolves** (10): the first verse weirdly demonstrates the feeling of being quarantined quite well

**1998tweety** (9.5): She's cute, can feel a little empty at some points though but honestly we needed a break after home with you. The vocals and breakdown on this are great though.

**laurent1683** (9): : The only song that isn't perfect on the album. It would've loved a little bit more experimentation on this one for it to mix with the rest of the album

**RandomHypnotica** (9): if this goes out on Day 1 or 2, that'll be a sad day for sure

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This song reminds me of my last (and only) relationship so I tend to skip it unless I’m listening to the album in order

**twat\_brained** (9): I mean… who's doing it like her?

**waluigiest** (9): the production on this sends me to higher limits seriously her voice on the bridge is unreal

**WeastofEden44** (9): This song gets me so uwu

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): Not a song I come back to a lot, but I like how it’s refined and polished, but still contains Twigs’ unique personality.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.3): It's a sad song for sure, but she pulls off the switch to the more energetic bridge seamlessly

**Awkward\_King** (8): depressed teas

**bulforster** (8): This one is almost too pristine for me. It's a cool instrumental but I don't really emotionally connect to it, except for the bridge when everything pretty much drops out and higlights how beautiful her voice is.

**freav** (8): Ethereal but catchy too, good.

**jlaca123** (7.4): My favorite so far on this one

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (7.2): I probably would have given this a significantly higher score if I liked the lyrics more. The sound is worth a higher score to me.

**BatesNorman** (7): maka maka maka maka maka

**chillbumps5** (7): incredible production and then FKA Twigs sings like she’s hyperventilating

**vayyiqra** (7): :pensive:

This almost received my 11, and I wish it placed higher. Throughout the rate, this song’s position was constantly changing, with it ending up as high as #5 at one point and as low as #12 at another point. Thankfully, it ended up barely making it into the top 10. When I heard some of the songs on this album at first, I thought that they were pleasant but nothing too special. With this song, that changed completely. In this track, Weyes Blood sings about wanting her life to be as simple as a movie, which doesn’t sound too interesting at first. However, she turned her ideas into a 6 minute epic, starting with a slow buildup that sounds like it is being sung underwater that leads into a potent climax that turns the introspective lyrics into an anthem that anyone would want to sing along to. This is easily my favorite track on Titanic Rising, and I’m happy to see that a lot of you had similar feelings toward this song.

**Awkward\_King** (11): singing for six minutes about how she wants to be in the mcu

**fadedblue09** (11): Very exquisite musical arrangements (that outro was majestic btw) and a well-executed lyrical metaphor. I can see why it’s a favorite, and it’s getting my 11. This track pretty much captured what I wanted to hear from the album, probably even better than the album itself.

**fluviusfluit** (11): I love the meaning I love the story I love the glory

**minibjork** (11): late in quarantining & movie theaters feel like a distant memory. are we sure natalie just invent this fantasy of "moviegoing" by herself ?

**plantp0wer** (11): I too love the movies and "Movies" by Weyes Blood

**SideBTrack8** (11): I'll never forget the first time I heard this song, it was spiritual

**vhqv1997** (11): Okay but this is such a relatable sentiment that has so rarely been expressed in a song. It just hits me in a way almost no song has before and I think about this almost everyday too.

**1998tweety** (10): Wow. WOW. This is definitely the best song on the album, I really feel like I'm listening to a cinematic piece of art with multiple acts. I love that this is 2 songs stitched together, and they're both good and both work well together.

**4Roux** (10): It’s so beautiful and otherworldly… is it about finding solace in Hollywood fantasies or something else?

**bibliosquire** (10): this will always be her best song I will not be accepting questions on this

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i get chills just THINKING about when the strings come in, and actually listening to that part makes me tear up in wonder every single time

**DaHumanTorch** (10): that switch up shook me to my core...this was stunning. easily the best song on the album. her voice just cut straight through me oh my god her tone was so haunting and powerful every word just hit me hard. play this at my funeral please, thanks

**hunnybee12** (10): I LOVE MOOOOOOVIEEEEEEEES

**InternetDude19** (10): I had a magical experience listening to this, I don't what happened to me but it was transcendent.

**leviswift13** (10): this song is an alien. it is from an underwater otherworld where people speak the language of light and we feel colors. wow. what a song. it perfectly captures, for me, the feeling of art. the feeling of being moved. the feeling of wanting to connect.

**mudkip1** (10): the way this song makes the rest of the album seem like horseshit LMAO

**rickikardashian** (10): i already linked the spongebob levitating meme but i hope y’all know i also feel like that listening to this song

**samf79** (10): Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous. This song is just stunning. "The the meaning of life doesn't seem to shine like that screen" is one of my favorite lyrics of all time. This song is so special. The ending is spectacular. Makes you feelings you've never felt so far.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): same, girl

**sawayamas** (10): easily one of my favorite songs of 2019 and definitely the best song on the album WHEW

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This was probably the only song I really enjoyed on first listen and it is still my favorite, the production and the harmonies make it really stand out from the rest of the album. I wasn’t sure if I liked the outro initially but now I can’t see the song without it

**skargardin** (10): This is what it feels like to ASCEND, this songs is absolutely magical. The way it builds and builds into several climaxes, UGH

**survivorjdmarina** (10): The buzzing intro, the chaotic string section later in the song, this is definitely an album highlight

**ThaCoolness** (10): the first time i heard this i was absolutely gagged for the entire duration. if it wasn't for cellophane this would be my 11

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Great lyrical concept. Love the harsh violins that arrive abruptly before the outro.

**thunderbird\_14** (10): Another 11 contender. The final minute was just bliss in audio format.

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): okay what. wow. this is just as incredible as i remember it being. i was literally transported to another planet while listening to this.

**wavingwolves** (10): i love how she encapsulates so well the need to be assured that life has meaning. this whole song is so magnetic and ethereal, quite the absolute masterpiece

**Stryxen** (9.9): yeah it’s good. definitely not the best on the album. please don’t murder me

**almdudler26** (9.5): i love movies too

**heckwes** (9): like lana but space

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): Why am I suddenly swimming and my soul is cleansed?

**realboxwood** (9): those kids and their screens, am I right

**WeastofEden44** (9): When I first heard the synth, I was so shook I moved my head back and banged it into the wall

**jlaca123** (8.5): I need to listen to this again!

**BatesNorman** (8): Good song but the synth still feels really out of place compared to the rest of the album

**Brendon-Urine** (8): This was originally my favorite song from the album but I don't quite love it as much anymore. Still fantastic, especially the vocal climax.

**Nickl00** (8): the strings make the song kind of distressing but it’s a cool feeling for a song to evoke

**skaiansightseer** (8): the second half of the song, once the loop switches up, is incredible-- but the first half is pretty but a little lifeless

**walkeddowntheblock** (8): Never really understood the hype around this song- I like it but I think there's better on this album

**zadooi** (8): This and Titanic Rising are the only songs that I feel fit the album cover and this one isn't an instrumental.

**chillbumps5** (7.5): wow this sounds awesome but also empty at the same time

**bespectacIed** (7): Not as huge of a fan as everyone. It's still beautiful though

**fishingfor8** (7): Okay yea this would be one of the better songs on the album but the same weaknesses are here, It's way too long.

**vayyiqra** (7): Did anyone else see that movie Titanic (1997) it was pretty good I watched it a bunch of times

**waluigiest** (7): the songwriting is good and the sound washes over me in a grand way but I just feel.... unfulfilled?

**twat\_brained** (6.6): this album is at that point now where the tracks lose distinction for me

**freav** (6.5): 70s pop Weyes Blood is better than Muse Weyes Blood

**koolkatkeeley** (6): I love the production on this track, but it’s a little too long for me.

**bulforster** (5.5): Parts of this really sound like a corny song written for an Oscars opening number or something to me so I struggle to take it seriously.

**sandyfishnets** (4): the production on this track is too extra for me

**cyborglilith** (3): boredom

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): Slow and long and boring, kinda like the lyrics

**CritneySpearz** (0): Honestly all you have to change is everything about it and I'd love it! maybe if I was on some sort of psychedelics I could enjoy this....

**RandomHypnotica** (0): I'm sorry, I just don't get this at ALL. This song is just soooo boooring to me. Eeeeevvvveeeerrrryyyy wooooorrrrddd drrrraaaaagggggssss oooouuuuuutttt soooooooooooo looooooooooooonnnnnnngggg

I totally understand why some people don’t love this track, but there was no way that I couldn’t give this song my 11. Here, Lana takes on a 9 minute journey through nostalgic times with her lover, starting with a reflection of innocent and sweet love that evokes imagery of peaceful and endless summers. After the 3 or 4 minute mark, though, this journey takes an entirely different direction - for the rest of this song, we end up embarking on a psychedelic trip that is filled with noisy guitar riffs, lush synths and strings, and Lana’s almost hypnotic vocals. While some people have said that this song runs for way too long, I think that this song would be nowhere near as great as it is without the second half, and because of that second half, it has earned my highest score.

---

**4Roux** (11): Cutting its length would just alter its fragile magic

**aresthormars** (11): This song is a serve, lyrically and sonically.

**BatesNorman** (11): ppl be like oh the guitar solo isnt that impressive but have you ever thought about the fact that the guitar solo is vibing hard af

**bibliosquire** (11): her best song to date

**chosenusernamess** (11): This song makes me feel like I’m floating on a cloud. It’s so dreamy and it’s makes me feel beautiful. Favorite lyrics: “If you weren’t mine I’d be jealous of your love” I cry listening to this part.

**koolkatkeeley** (11): this is one of my favorite songs of all time. I need to know how Lana makes nine minutes feel like three. She’s truly a witch.

**Nickl00** (11): this is my favorite song ever I love every moment of it

**PointlessBibliophage** (11): I keep looking at the timestamp and every single time I'm surprised how much of the song there still is left, and yet it's never long enough by the end, because this song is an infinite journey of bliss. All of history has been mere preparations leading up to the moment when this particular combination of sounds would be set down, the ultimate apex of human musical endeavor. To exceed it is to exceed the limits of humanity and transcend into a different mode of existence entirely.

**SFbby** (11): Since Lana mentioned this song as a end of summer cruise drive kinda song, I aptly decided to follow her advice and went on a tinder date with a guy who had a car so he could drive and I could sit back and wallow in the music and watch the sun set along the California coast. After a 10 minute reawakening, I can say that this song is the closest I'll ever get to living in her world. It sounds simultaneously like a full refinement of everything she's portrayed and unlike anything she's put out before, with its woozy atmosphere, nostalgic feel, and Lana-esque lyrics.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): As a fan of prog rock (sue me!!!) I really like this type of long meandering song and Lana does one of the best soft indie versions of it

**vayyiqra** (11): I wish this whole album had been as good as this song with Lana and Jack fucking me up. Unfortunately it wasn't, but I appreciate that they made this epic. I never would've expected Lana to do a song like this, but it shows what a genius songwriter she is.

**almdudler26** (10): if i could give a second eleven this would get it!!!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): im such a faux indie gay whore i hate that i love this song so much

**Brendon-Urine** (10): queen shit. her vocals on the outro are just sublime.

**chillbumps5** (10): this rating is almost entirely for Jack Antonoff’s instrumental despite Lana’s best efforts to ruin it with her cliche repetitive “i’m a cute little bitch” schtick.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the centerpiece of the whole album whew

**cyborglilith** (10): crimson and clover honey

**DaHumanTorch** (10): doctor: you have 9:37 minutes left to live......me: plays this song. i really want to drive in a convertible down the roads along the pacific coast to this song

**jlaca123** (10): Same here, perfect through and through. Earns its 9:37 run time.

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Pretty flawless song. When it first came out it was clear this album had the potential to be something really special (and it is). Arty, dreamy, softly psychedelic masterpiece - too many good moments to name

**leviswift13** (10): AHHHH YES TEN MINUTE LONG QUEEN

**mudkip1** (10): i love every single second of this song. it's almost perfect

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Listening to this song really feels like I'm walking along the beach at the Golden Hour with the love of my life (that doesn't exist but let me dream)

**sarcasticsobs** (10): the song that got me to give her another chance, a clear 11 contender

**skaiansightseer** (10): like a bob dylan song that fucks

**skargardin** (10): Damn it if Jack didn't make the length of this song work

**survivorjdmarina** (10): A behemoth of a track! It’s something new for Lana but still oh so her.

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): okay this is stunning. i haven't listened in full since the album came out and i can't believe i didn't know what i was missing.

**Yatcho** (10): Questions for the culture: Did I post "If you weren't mine I'd be, jealous of your love..." on instagram several times? Maybe so. Did Jack Antonoff snap on the guitars? Maybe so. Is this song too long? Hell no

**waluigiest** (9.9): this song is gorgeous and stunning but ngl I skip it frequently mama I do not have the time!!

**-nox-** (9.6): Length is the only factor that makes this not a 10.

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): the perfect song to dissociate to <3

**1998tweety** (9): Imma keep this short and sweet (unlike the song), but while I do appreciate the artistic choices Lana made on the song, and while I do think it's well-made, I also don't like listening to it as much compared to the other songs on the album, so it gets a cute 9.

**fishingfor8** (9): How long this song is either the best or worst thing about this

**rickikardashian** (9): yeah the outro does make it drag a bit, but the vibe is still amazing

**freav** (8.5): the little synthesizer that comes around the 3 mark, that's a vibe

**bulforster** (8): I would actually love how drawn out this was if that synth that sounds like a theremin wasn't frustratingly off beat taking me out of the pleasant trance of the rest.

**hunnybee12** (8): unpopular opinion but it goes a bit long for me. also who let her have a clip cars driving on a highway on loop be 80% of the music video

**shesdoingyoga** (8): It’s good and the long instrumental sections manage to avoid being too boring but it feels like people overrate it just because its nine minutes long

**Stryxen** (8): I don’t know if I’ve ever heard a song that sounds like this. it’s ~unique~

**vhqv1997** (8): This is a great song if you only listen to it every 6 months

**wavingwolves** (8): when it comes to her longer tracks, cruel world is still the best but this is lovely

**WeastofEden44** (8): it’s great but tbh it drags a tiny bit

**fadedblue09** (7.5): This was a solid 10 until it lost me halfway through (did we really need 4 minutes of instrumental solos mixed with barely audible singing?).

**untutorable** (7.5): falls off after about 5 minutes

**twat\_brained** (7.3): I think the maximum length Lana can pull off is 7 minutes, maybe 7:30. Cruel World works to her advantage when she does that. See also: my comment for "hope". The only reason I can think of VB having the runtime it does is so Lana can use the dead space to introduce and thank her onstage band and thank the fans for attending her concert

**wanderingimpromptu3** (7.1): Honestly I tried but I like the traditional song parts of this more than the instrumental interlude. It didn't piss me off which is an achievement for a 10min song, but I did not understand the beepy electronic stuff in the interlude??

**plantp0wer** (6.5): this song never ends tf

**gannade** (6): the beginning is so pretty and then jack ruined it with his zipper ass sophie-esque instrumental. if yall werent jizzing off to this getting BNM and being 10 min long...

**realboxwood** (6): The first third of this song are a 9, the next third is a 3, and the last third is a 6. So here we go

**thatgreekguyraul** (6): The lyrics are quite mediocre but what redeems the track from being subpar is its instrumentation and two guitar solos.

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (5): I know many love this one and I wanted to love it but her delivery strikes me the wrong way. There are some long songs I love but I didn't really "get" the length on this one.

**bespectacIed** (5): The way this never scrobbled on my last.fm because i always skip after the first instrumental lol. It's an ok 4-minute song dragged into a 9-minute one

**Geography3** (5): a bit too long for my tastes sorry

bbfan132: kappyko (3): this goes on too long im serious sorry
InternetDude19 (0): The first 3 minutes are fine, but this song is way too long. There are 6 minutes of mediocre noodling and "oh woah woahing" tacked on the end of this song. I'm not opposed to songs of this length, I grew up on LCD Soundsystem, but this does nothing to justify it's length. If the outro were 3 minutes shorter the song would be so much better. I have no clue why so many people love this song, it's not bad, but it is certainly flawed. I'm giving my 0 on principle.

This was one of the songs in this rate that didn’t quite stick with me at first… However, it quickly grew on me, and I can fully appreciate it now. Here, FKA twigs takes us on an unpredictably energetic adventure, or as she calls it, “a medieval march through the destruction of a relationship.” At certain points in this song, it almost sounds as if this should be the soundtrack to a boss fight in a video game in the best way possible. This song will only continue to grow on me with time.

---

**sarcasticsobs** (11): indieheads and popheads are all like “cElLoPhAnE 11” but NOW YOU HOLD ME CLOSE, SO TEND-ER, IN THE SHA-DOWS HIDING FROM YOUR-SELF

**WeastofEden44** (11): Maybe the best song of last year. It’s like Sondheim teamed up with SOPHIE to create a dystopian, campy, Brechtian musical adaption of Medea

**yelling\_tortoise** (11): the ENERGY and PASSION of this song, it's unparalleled on this album. the anger in the hammering instrumental, the frustration in her screaming vocals, the catharsis of the lyrics. you're strung through a grinder on this song, all of your limbs pulled so far but not quite enough to rip you apart.

**1998tweety** (10): I feel like this is the dark horse of the album, I don't see it praised as much as the other big songs on the album. I love just how chaotic this song is. There's so much energy in it, usually Twigs songs do have a lot of energy but it's more on the solemn side where you just sit there and weep; this song however makes me want to get up and run. It gives off some kind of frenzy energy, perfectly suiting the subject of the song.

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (10): Love the intensity. Such a great song.

**BatesNorman** (10): wish I was an alien so I could relate to this more

**bespectacIed** (10): I wished this had a video, the imagery of this song would have translated well on an MV

**bibliosquire** (10): wacky and I love it

**cubascastrodistrict** (10): this song is so badass. It really makes you feel like that bitch.

**cyborglilith** (10): annoying bop

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this goes the fuck OFFFF...the i feel the lightning blast sample is so well utilized and, as with every song on this album (i sound like a broken record at this point) the production is just on another level. twigs is definitely a fallen alien, sis is not human because no human can make such consistently flawless music like this

**enofisenough** (10): goes from making me wanna punch walls...

**Geography3** (10): my third fave on the album

**leviswift13** (10): ANGER! YES TWIGS YES YES YES YES! this is raw and guttural and personal and wounded. she is such an incredible vocalist because the emotion just swims off of her.

**Nickl00** (10): it’s so chaotic but in a good way

**samf79** (10): such a badass song

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This song is a standout because of its intensity, both in the production and the vocal performance, that lets you feel every emotion that she is feeling

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Love the concept!

**thunderbird\_14** (10): The child choirs were used by Nicholas Jaar in one of his tracks, I forgot which but both tracks slap. Also, this is like the most British-accented I’ve ever heard from a song so plus points to being a 10.5 <3.

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): this is just so awesome. one of twigs' best tracks.

**twat\_brained** (9.8): I believe twigs is an alien because no human could make a song or an album of such quality

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): holy shit this is an absolute bop!! gonna put it on repeat after i finish listening thru this

**bulforster** (9.5): A twigs banger is a rare blessing to be cherished.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.5): at first i thought it was just gonna be an ok song but goddamn it got so good

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): It’s a banger!!! I love how quickly it descends into chaos and absolute craziness, symbolising Twigs’ emotional breakdown.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.3): Powerful delivery, she really lights a fire on this track

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): abduct me queen

**jlaca123** (9.1): Big fan of this one as well -- gorgeous chorus!

**fadedblue09** (9): Kinda like “home with you”, this track sounds chaotic but the chaoticness somehow works in its favor.

**koolkatkeeley** (9): the most wild song on the album. It literally feels like you’re on spaceship that’s crashing to earth. One thing that’s always bothered me though is that it’s called Fallen Alien and not Fallen Angel because angel fits with the Mary Magdalene theme. I’m sure twigs has her genius reasoning so I won’t question, but it’s just odd.

**rickikardashian** (9): this shit loud as hell, i love it

**skaiansightseer** (9): exemplifies twigs' intensity on this album, especially with the overlayed vocals on the second verse

**Stryxen** (9): do I know what this song is about? not really. does it make me scream with delight anyway? yes

**wavingwolves** (9): this is one of those songs that, because of how noisy it is, makes you wonder if someone is calling for you, knocking on your door or trying to open your window from the outside and i respect that it does that

**Yatcho** (9): BANGER ALERT

**wanderingimpromptu3** (8.7): I normally don't like anthemic songs that are more of a chant than a melody, but this song kept growing and growing on me, it's ferocious. "I'LL KICK YOU DOWN" ugh

**CritneySpearz** (8.5): wtf this song goes hard af, production is nuts

**vayyiqra** (8): Banger.

**waluigiest** (8): this song feels like she’s chasing me and is gonna beat me up I love it

**Awkward\_King** (7): i forgot how much this song felt like a panic attack

**freav** (7): This one is a mess but also kind of in a good way

**plantp0wer** (6): it’s a bit unsettling to listen to, that may be the intention but I don’t find it very enjoyable

**heckwes** (4): pitchy

**Brendon-Urine** (3): Yeeaahhh I really didn't like this song. It has some good sections and melodies but at other times it's just hard to listen to.

**fishingfor8** (2): nope not for me

After the disappointing holy terrain was released as the second single, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Luckily, she gave us this behemoth of a progressive pop track as a third single. In this track, FKA twigs goes into a million different directions at once both in terms of sound and lyrics, but it comes together flawlessly. This song restored my faith in the potential of this album, and in the end, I wasn’t disappointed.

---

**Geography3** (11): my favorite FKA twigs song close to Pendulum

**laurent1683** (11): : This song reaching an 11 across these 3 albums is an absolute testament to the brutality of the story. I always tear up at the end of song. It represents the feeling of finding your true home after years of sadness so honestly

**realboxwood** (11): a fun coincidence that my three 11 contenders were all the second tracks of their respective album. I was indecisive while listening to Mariner's Apartment Complex and Andromeda, but the second the first chorus came in I knew I had to pick this.

**sawayamas** (11): kind of the best song of all time I literally love it so much...

**skargardin** (11): this song is absolutely magical, ethereal and somehow manages to be dark and moody as well. It's a wonderful mix and the final high note just gives me EVERYTHING.

**waluigiest** (11): I could have given my 11 to a lot of songs on this album, but this is the song that really got my attention back when the album came out. It mixes these beautiful almost operatic melodies with darker glitchy sounds and it is stunning. The second half of the chorus when the keyboard comes in is show-stopping, and the end of the second chorus with the warbling sorta sounds??? Unmatched.

**1998tweety** (10): Wow, an absolutely incredible song. Everything about this is immaculate. If I wasn't giving my 11 to the song I picked this would've been it. The outro to this with all those instruments is so gorgeous. I'm gonna be so mad if you Charli stans drag this......

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (10): I can't believe how good this song is. I love the mood switches and how cinematic the chorus feels and the production of it. This song can make me cry way too easily. The end of it is amazing.

**bespectacIed** (10): Actually my true 11, but I gotta secure that Cellophane ~~wig~~ win. I love them both equally anyway. The back and forth between the glitchy, staccato verses and the operatic chorus, wow. And that final chorus that sounds like her release from all the pain and scorn she's experienced. A moment most pleasing

**bibliosquire** (10): the production is otherworldly

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the Kate Bush reference... her haunting vocals... the buildup to the climax... yup this might be her best song

**cubascastrodistrict** (10): one of the main contenders for the 11 in this rate. Even the more distorted difficult verses are so catchy and moving, and then the explosion of the chorus is amazing. The final minute or so when all the noise just piles up... she’s genius.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is just...i have no words for this song. it blows me away every time. the raw and emotional lyrics, the (entirely self-produced!) production, just everything is perfect. one of the many 10s on this album

**hunnybee12** (10): ever since fantano called this song horrible I haven’t looked at him the same.

**InternetDude19** (10): I still get goosebumps every time. What a beautiful song.

**leviswift13** (10): fuck. this song never does what you think it is going to do. the operatic loneliness of the chorus. the almost rapped anger and pain of the verses. this feels like teetering on the edge of sanity.

**nootnoot781** (10): straight people get MBDTF is a 6/10. gay people get worst tracks of the week - home with you. a hate crime

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): this is a whole aural experience

**rotating3Dtext** (10): somehow it’s the most epic song in the album for me

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This song definitely took a few listens to click, but now it is probably my favorite song lyrically on the album

**skaiansightseer** (10): twigs' ability to sell an otherwise awkward line like "never seen a hero like me in a sci fi"... legendary. the transition between parts here... also legendary.

**Stryxen** (10): I couldn’t make a home w11th you shitpost work so I gave it to cellophane instead

**survivorjdmarina** (10): All of the ideas in this song are very different, but come together to create an emotional rollercoaster of a song. Something something Fantano is wrong.

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): The switch between the tender and bitter production matches the lyrics so well.

**wavingwolves** (10): i love the "never seen a hero like me in a sci-fi" line so!! much!!

**WeastofEden44** (10): Fun Fact, I’ve played clarinet for 10 years and have the goal of learning the main clarinet part at the end

**Yatcho** (10): MASTERPIECE. This feels a lot like the Two Weeks of the album, the big single that is just a show of pure singing and production talent

**-nox-** (9.5): The stark difference between the verse and chorus is brilliant but lost its novelty for me because I have listened to it way too much.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): she sings songs so like angelically i forget her lyrics are mostly about like normal problems it's cool

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.2): The chorus is particularly beautiful, but great build-up in the verses too. Filled with great lines, like the aching "I didn't know that you were lonely" (which we're all kinda lonely these days)

**bulforster** (9): That chaotic swell at the end is heavenly.

**heckwes** (9): sickk

**koolkatkeeley** (9): I saw this live and oh my fucking god when twigs says it feels like flying with your voice it literally feels like she is flying in this song.

**plastichaxan** (9): this music makes me cryyyy

**twat\_brained** (8.6): I don't know what she's saying all I know is go Tahliah show your ex why he's a douche

**Nickl00** (8): the vocals effects are sick and the chorus is beautiful

**BatesNorman** (7.5): wish I was home with twigs

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): ok i know there's like an incredible backstory to this but the person who introduced this song to me is someone i'm not on good terms with anymore and i'm petty enough to lower the score for that lol

**jlaca123** (7.2): Same here, but more melodic so I like it better.

**fishingfor8** (7): The ending is not as good as it could be but it’s still a good track

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): I like half of this song

**vintagebathingsuit** (6.5): i thought this was so weird when i first heard it. i still don't like the effects on her voice in the verses but the chorus and outro make up for it. and the last line "and i'd have told you i was lonely too" is just the best way to end the song.

**CritneySpearz** (6): i'm sorry but the outro gives me a headache and sounds kind of disjointed...

**vayyiqra** (6): Idk if I like this exactly, but I appreciate how strange and creepy it is.

**fadedblue09** (5): Eh, the chorus was lovely, but the rest of the song has too much going on with it. Would’ve benefited from being cut into two tracks or something.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5): I have such mixed feelings about this one because the lyrics are so beautiful and profound but something about the production / voice in the chorus is grating to the ears, starting to think I really prefer her lower register to her higher register

**gannade** (0): im sorry but this just sounds flat out demonic

**yelling\_tortoise** (0): seriously, the production on this song is so loud and abrasive to the point it's unlistenable. there is no reason to put such horrible, mutating effects on her vocals like this. you can't even hear her lyrics when the effects are on full force. it's like an alien convulsing into your ears.

This was an unexpected runner up for me when it comes to MAGDALENE, but the namesake of this album is a terrific summation of the major themes of this album. Even though it doesn’t stick out for me as much as it does for other people, I can respect this track and the interview with the NY Times where she discusses the making of this song is a must watch.

---

**bulforster** (11): Perfection.

**nootnoot781** (11): yeah this track really puts the art in art pop. absolute perfection

**shaniquasharkesha** (11): the best FKA twigs song period, sue me.

**thunderbird\_14** (11): i hear kate bush i upvote

**twat\_brained** (11): the first time I heard this masterpiece I knew I was in the presence of a higher being

**bespectacIed** (10): My immediate favorite song from the album. My fave lyrics in the album. Comparing the modern woman's struggle, imperfections, and power to the most scorned woman in history was a serve

**bibliosquire** (10): women!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this just builds up to that prolonged release so so so beautifully

**DaHumanTorch** (10): best song on the album. the last minute or so of this song is incredible...absolutely entrancing

**fadedblue09** (10): The thesis statement of the album, therefore it’s a 10. Also the instrumentation and vocals are just so...divine? Definitely an 11 contender.

**jman457** (10): (wish i had a second 11 to give)

**leviswift13** (10): a woman's work. a woman's prerogative CREATURE OF DESIRE FUCK IT UP

**Nickl00** (10): if I had to prove music was art to anyone I’d show them this song

**plastichaxan** (10): this grew so much on me with time wow

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i can't really explain exactly what this song did to me but i feel ascended

**sandyfishnets** (10): if I wasn't a lana stan I would have given this my 11

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This was a strong contender for my 11 because I love absolutely everything about it, this was the song that solidified MAGDALENE in my top 3 albums of 2019

**Stryxen** (10): true as mary magdalene - cuhreecheruf d’zyah

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Great lyrics. Love the Kate Bush reference.

**yelling\_tortoise** (10): it's like a MOVIE how this song goes. I feel like I've lived two lives after hearing this

**willamsextrai** (9.9): Is it just me or do the opening 76 seconds of this track just cry out for everyone to give their 11?

**jlaca123** (9.7): This one is gorgeous! One of my faves from the rate.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Gorgeous, the centerpiece of the album and it delivers hard. The breakdown on this song is amazing.

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): The emotional centre of the album, and a great one at that.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): I like the echoey creepy feeling and the melody is really pretty

**Brendon-Urine** (9): Probably the best song on the album, maybe in contention with cellophane.

**wavingwolves** (9): whew!!! am i transcending?? also i have to say that "i know where you start, where you end, how to please, how to curse" is such a powerful sentiment

**WeastofEden44** (9): Some of my fav lyrics of hers

**BatesNorman** (8.5): shout out the women

**rickikardashian** (8.5): the grainy sound is something my headphones just aren’t able to make sound pleasing

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): FKA Twigs really knows how to push the boundaries of experimentation while still making a catchy tune, and there is so much going on in her lyrics

**skaiansightseer** (8): great atmospheres and textures but the song itself is a bit more lightweight than the best tracks here

**waluigiest** (8): sis the drama!

**fishingfor8** (7): This album I respect more than I like. It’s too experimental for me so for it isn’t on repeat like Lana’s album’s was. This song is a great example of that. It’s never gonna make it on a playlist like fuck it I love you but i still enjoy it fine enough

**koolkatkeeley** (7): this song has so many interesting production choices, but I have to be in a certain mood to listen to it.

**vayyiqra** (7): Mary Magdalene did nothing wrong.

**chillbumps5** (5): i enjoyed the first thirty seconds of this

So here we have it… this is Weyes Blood’s highest placing song in the rate. You wouldn’t normally expect a lush and mellow ballad like this to place so high, but Weyes is a master at creating them, and once you listen to the track, the appeal of the song is clear. While it’s not my favorite track off of the album, I still enjoy it quite a bit and I’m glad to see one of her songs make it into the top 5.

---

**LazyDayLullaby** (11): Once in a while I hear a song that feels like falling in love with music all over again, and this is one of those. I've still never grown tired of it. From the slide guitar to the cosmic harmonies, it's a fantastic song to get lost on, and it just gets better and better as it goes on. I especially love those claps in the background around 2:54 and 2:58

**1998tweety** (10): Wow this is gorgeous, I'm ascending.

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (10): I just love to listen to it. Amazing delivery and lines. When I heard this song the first listen through months ago I realized I was really in for something different with this album.

**bespectacIed** (10): The song that made Titanic Rising click to me

**bibliosquire** (10): space goddess

**Brendon-Urine** (10): The writing and production here are great but the lyrics elevate it so much.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is so atmospheric and beautiful in every way. that buzzing droning sound that kicks it off and hangs under like a bubbling current really sets the intergalactic mood. the bridge is also spectacular and such a relatable mood for me rn.

**heckwes** (10): love the guitars

**InternetDude19** (10): This was the first Weyes Blood song that connected with me. It's so lovely, and expansive, and that chorus just soars.

**jlaca123** (10): Stunning. Words can't express the beauty of this song.

**leviswift13** (10): this song really snuck up on me. i liked it at first listen, but it is the one from this record i keep coming back to. really magnificent song that makes me feel a galactic mermaid princess at the end of the world.

**Nickl00** (10): every time I hear this song I’m amazed. It never gets old

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): if you wanna run away with me i know a galaxy

**realboxwood** (10): I think about the line, "Treat me right, I'm still a good man's daughter" a lot for someone who isn't that

**rotating3Dtext** (10): this was the first song that really caught my attention the first time I listened to the album and I still think is pretty stellar, with the lyrics and details

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This is probably the song that grew on me the most since fist listen from the album, I absolutely love the instrumental in this one

**skaiansightseer** (10): we don't need classic rock anymore we have weyes blood

**skargardin** (10): Magical

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Gorgeous use of steel guitar. I love the lyrics so much.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the first 10 seconds of this where it feels like you're dropped underwater into the soundscape is godly

**vhqv1997** (10): Procrastination the song

**wavingwolves** (10): for me this is one of those songs that is just part of your history because of the times you lived while listening to it. everytime i listen it i think of the days i went to a mental hospital to get medicated bc i was in a middle of a huge breakdown and while returning home i listened to this and looked at the sea. it was one of the few truly peaceful moments i had at that time.

**Yatcho** (10): Major 11 contender, immediately sticks out as the jewel of the album. Just takes you on a ride though its absolutely gorgeous melody and heavenly instrumentals.

**yelling\_tortoise** (10): truly the best song on the album. the way it keeps rising and rising is flawless and beautiful and ethereally enchanting. she keeps it simple without seeming too intimidating with the cinematic mood of other songs like movies and something to believe. you could put this on at any time and feel the energy she's putting out without losing anything.

**BatesNorman** (9.5): I love the Andromeda, one of my top 5 galaxies!

**bulforster** (9.5): Love me a pedal steel (even though I know it's not actually one).

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): It’s so gorgeous!

**vintagebathingsuit** (9.5): wow...those harmonies

**Stryxen** (9): one of my friends who has absolutely no interest in pop music loves this track. it just that good

**waluigiest** (9): I LOVE her voice

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Love the neo-folk vibes on this one.

**minibjork** (8.5): my favorite country dream-pop song

**cubascastrodistrict** (8): I really love the melody here, it’s a great testament to her skills as a songwriter.

**twat\_brained** (8): the slide guitars give me strong orville peck vibes. To me it sounds like Sarah McLachlan covering him

**vayyiqra** (8): Beautiful, and the only song on this album I find myself going back to a lot.

**WeastofEden44** (8): The guitar line is like if sound waves converged with the ocean

**fishingfor8** (7.5): It's fine. The main problem I have with Weyes Blood is her voice. It's really emotionless and doesn't have the nostalgia effect that Lana has.

**DaHumanTorch** (7): i was really enjoying this at first but then it kind of went nowhere and got boring...i still liked it a lot though, maybe it needs to grow on me a bit

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5.5): Lyrics are honestly quite lovely and wistful and the melody is better than usual, but I still can't remember a thing about it after I finish listening

**koolkatkeeley** (5): I know everyone loves this, but it’s never truly stuck with me like the other songs on this album. I appreciate it, but it’s not for me.

bbfan132: # Titanic Rising

---

**Overall Average**: 7.996 **// Average Controversy:** 1.731

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (10.100): I cant say much about this album here that I didn’t already say in my writeup. It’s just immaculately crafted and the best album of the 2010s for me. Tbh it’s right behind Hounds of Love on my all-time list

**thatgreekguyraul** (9.900): Everything about this album is magnificent. The lyrical content is so vivid and Weyes uses interesting images such as galaxies, ships, movies, etc. I an visualise the lyrics she describes so well. One can note how the production blends her own sound with her love for soft rock artists such as Queen and David Bowie. The instrumental tracks allow the listener to unwind from the tension built in the previous songs. In many ways, it reminds me of Kate Bush's 1985 album Hounds of Love. A flawless record.

**wavingwolves** (9.800): this is a perfect album.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.700): The best album I have heard in my entire life, besides all of Amy Winehouse's tbh. Changed my life. Every song is a masterpiece.

**laurent1683** (9.500): I love it, but it doesn't have the huge personality, consistency and realatability of the other two. This is the one that I wouldn't call a masterpiece. It is still breathtaking and gorgeous of course

**-nox-** (9.490): Hopefully we'll be hearing more of this genre-defining sound in the future. Ambient, celestial, neo-psychedelic chamber pop?

**thunderbird\_14** (9.150): Even though soft rock is kinda one of the dominant genres here, it took me a while to digest this album. The second half is stronger than the first half, though upon closer attention so I like the rate for reminding me why this album deserves all the praise it gets.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.090): Certainly one of my favourites from 2019, but this album also feels timeless. The whole thing is amazing, but wow, the first 4 songs are just non-stop delights

**Stryxen** (8.930): I am so glad I did this rate as the album only clicked for me during this and it clicked hard. It has the kind of energy that makes me want to get pretentious about music but everyone adores it no matter how much they like pop (adjacent? idk what genre this is tbh). This is THE progression of music and it all comes together so organically that it feels like it could have just spawned naturally and spontaneously

**survivorjdmarina** (8.900): Although this is the only album I didn’t listen to on release, it’s incredibly lush and harmonious and full. Now it’s one of my favourite albums of 2019.

**samf79** (8.900): I am so, so, so glad I discovered Natalie Mering and this album. She speaks right to the heart in a way that I have never heard before in music, so raw and honest and vulnerable. I play this album pretty much every day. With this album, I finally understand what people mean when they say that music changed their life.

**vhqv1997** (8.800): This album took several tries for me to actually click, but when it did, it felt like such a better experience than the other two, it didn't have as many highs as them, but the overall journey is much more pleasant, and I'm glad I gave it as many attempts as I did

**hunnybee12** (8.700): 8.7 I never listened to the album with my full attention before this, which was a mistake because every nearly every track is stunning. It’s really one of those albums you get more from which each listen

**skaiansightseer** (8.600): a perfect opening run that doesn't lose steam as the album goes on. lush and cinematic while still warm and unpretentious

**leviswift13** (8.500): super strong, cinematic work. this album has built a blue, deep, underwater, apocalyptic world. i feel like i'm deep in the sea the second a lot's gonna change starts. i don't love it as much as the other albums in this rate, but i think the artistry on display here is really rare and special. this album deserves to be celebrated.

**bespectacIed** (8.400): I was late in getting in to the hype of this album, but when it finally clicked, it's like opening a third eye

**mtachi** (8.400): Urgh her mind. I'd been aware of Weyes Blood for a while through her collaboration with Perfume Genius and new some of her songs from her last album (yessss Seven Words we love you), but this was the first full album that I really loved from her.

**shesdoingyoga** (8.300): This album is definitely going to be a bit destroyed compared to the other two, which is sad because it is still a fantastic album in its own right. This is the only album in the rate where I was not already familiar with the rest of the artist’s discography before listening to it, and when I first listened to it in late 2019 I did not really click with the album. I listened to it every so often for several weeks to see if it would finally click, and it didn’t start to click until I listened to it alone on a 5 hour drive in January to visit friends. While it is my least favorite of the three and the least memorable overall, there is still not a bad song on here and it continues to grow on me as I find new things to love about it with each listen

**stardustanddinos** (8.250): This is my first time listening to Weyes Blood anything, this album is gorgeous in every note and every lyric, like the gushing of a stream, the thundering roar of a rapid. Weyes has a way with words, she sculpts them into beautiful monuments to the restlessness of modern love, the profound pain of loss, the angst of being human. The strings throughout the album add a gorgeous ambience to the songs, and elevate the meaning of the songs. However, despite the uncertainty that clouds the album, there is also hope, there is the learning of being human. This is a solid project and I look forward to exploring more of her music.

**WeastofEden44** (8.200): This album is effortlessly gorgeous. It’s like if Poseidon and Samuel Beckett did LSD and created an chamber pop album.

**skargardin** (8.200): This was the album I admittedly was the least familiar with prior to the rate but after having listened to it a couple of times, I definitely get the acclaim. It's just as magical as the other two albums in the rate. I don't feel quite as strongly on it as the other two but it's a great album. Movies is the obvious standout, love love LOVE it.

**Yatcho** (7.970): This was really the definition of a grower for me. My first listen, nothing but Andromeda made any impact- it's just not the kind of album you can digest in one casual sit down listen. Months later, I kept revisiting it again and again until I could finally appreciate the beauty of it. It's an immaculate artpop record

**cremeebrulee** (7.910): i already know i didn't rate this album fairly compared to the other two because this is the first/second time I'm listening to it :/ on an initial listen it's alright but i don't particularly like any of the songs other than wild time. maybe my mind will change on a revisit idk

**willamsextrai** (7.820): An incredible album in its own right but it doesn't hold a candle to the other two (and it looks like P4k agrees with me so I have to be objectively right?).

**cubascastrodistrict** (7.800): this was the biggest surprise of 2019 for me for sure. I had never heard of Weyes Blood before, but I saw the thread on popheads and decided to give it a try. Turns out it’s exactly the kind of music I love. The front half is definitely stronger than the second half though. I think it’s a pretty great testament to how good the album is that the initial popheads thread for it was tiny, but by the end of the year you couldn’t go five minutes without seeing someone praise it.

=====

bbfan132: **freav** (7.800): My favorite of these 3, Natalie is a really good songwriter.

**DaHumanTorch** (7.750): this had high high and boring lows, but was overall a good album. easily the weakest one here though

**gannade** (7.750): this kinda sounded the same the whole way thru... so straight 7s it is

**fadedblue09** (7.650): Tbh, I wanted to like this album more, since I’m a sucker for traditional singer-songwriter types. My main issue is that some of the themes used to describe this album, such as climate change and the subconscious mind, felt more like backdrops rather than central themes. As for her musical style, I appreciate her Carpenters emulations and 70’s sound, though it gets stale after a while (particularly in the second half) and it needed a more contemporary spin on her part. The tracks I liked the most (Everyday, Movies) did a job of balancing her throwback sound with fresher vibes. That being said, I was able to get some solid cuts and I’m willing to hear more from her.

**InternetDude19** (7.600): I've tried to get into this album a few times, and there are a few songs here that I love. But overall, I don't get why it is so acclaimed. The cover is wonderful though, it makes me want to buy a vinyl copy.

**zadooi** (7.500): I wish this album had more songs that fit the album cover. Maybe that's why I don't really love this album.

**CopyCatJ** (7.300): I associate this album with a very yikes moment, its good but yikes for personal reasons

**chillbumps5** (6.750): The problems I have with this album are the same problems I have with Golden Hour; her voice does next to nothing emotionally for me and the production is almost too clean. But as with both albums, i moderately enjoy them and there’s no song i can say “this isn’t good.” It’s solid but unspectacular. You can go ahead and revoke my indieheads card. Popheads is going to destroy this album and I’m not going to be there to save it.

**cyborglilith** (5.310): great production on every track

**RandomHypnotica** (5.100): This is the 3rd time I've listened to this album now, and it just never clicked for me. Most of the songs are fine, but I just found myself getting distracted easily and not really engaging with them.

**vayyiqra** (5.000): I must confess, I swear I'm not trying to be edgy but I've tried so hard to get the hype about this album. I was expecting lush orchestral pop and instead it's 1970s soft pop that reminds me of the Carpenters. It's not awful, but it doesn't hold my interest aside from a few standout tracks like "Andromeda". I've heard it at least five times trying to see why everyone loves it and it's just not memorable.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3.590): On paper Titanic Rising is something I'd like, orchestral, ~celestial, but I just can't get into it at all. Everything about the melodies and even her voice is so completely unmemorable and beige?

Before this single was released, I thought that Lana was a decent artist who I had previously loved back in 2015, but I didn’t think that she was on another level. With this song, that completely changed. Who would’ve known that Jack Antonoff would’ve helped Lana create this dreamy and atmospheric art pop/soft rock track with tinges of psychedelia throughout, that was completely unlike most of her discography? I definitely didn’t expect this, but I’m glad that we all have it now.

---

**chillbumps5** (11): her best song by far.

**fishingfor8** (11): This song was the first sign of my eventual turn around on Lana. I had always liked her but this blew me away. I remember this debuted the same week Slow Dancing In the Dark by Joji and Pretty Little Fears by 6lack did in fall 2018 and those 3 songs were THE songs of my fall. This song will always hold a special place with me. As a big sports and baseball fan specifically, the name "Mariners Apartment Complex" really helps seal the deal even if it's not really a reference to the baseball team.

**jlaca123** (11): Absolutely flawless

**jman457** (11): (lyrics + production=trance)

**letsallpoo** (11): maybe jack antonoff is redeemable

**rotating3Dtext** (11): this might be the best song she’s ever released. it’s not terribly complex but it’s really really pretty.

**1998tweety** (10): Perfection, a great lead single.

**bibliosquire** (10): beautiful

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): marina’s apartment complex

**DaHumanTorch** (10): “think about it the darkness the deepness, all the things that make me who i am” ugh this is a masterpiece

**hunnybee12** (10): her true magnum opus

**InternetDude19** (10): Stong contender for my 11, what a well-written song.

**Nickl00** (10): I was never bored of Lana, but this song was really refreshing to me when it came out and is one of her best written tracks

**realboxwood** (10): Snapped with the mixing changes between the single and album version tbh, it went from kind of meh to an 11 contender for me waits to find out there were no mixing changes and I just mandela effect-ed myself into thinking there was a difference

**SFbby** (10): She's daddy now

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This is my favorite of Lana’s lead singles

**skaiansightseer** (10): tfw u take my sadness out of context

**skargardin** (10): Excellent in all its simplicity

**survivorjdmarina** (10): A soft and soothing ballad that’s classic Lana at her best

**twat\_brained** (10): blissful

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): this is so unappreciated. laid in bed in the dark and listened through headphones and it took me to another dimension.

**wavingwolves** (10): i know everyone loves the first lines of nfr but the first lines of this song are the ones that i desperately love

**Yatcho** (10): Another collapse. The piano is sublime and "Im your man" is perfect. UGH I love this album

**bulforster** (9.5): Not sure it's intentional but I love that the distortion on the guitar in the outro makes it sound like a ship's horn.

**BatesNorman** (9): mawinews apawtment compwex

**cremeebrulee** (9): this single brought me to tears the first time i heard it. the growth. she's daddy now

**leviswift13** (9): stunned me the second it was realized. i think it gets eclipsed by others on the album, but lana whispering "i'm your man" is horny in a good way

**RandomHypnotica** (9): When this came out as the lead single I wasn't too sure where the album was gonna go, and whilst it's still not my favourite, it definitely grew on me a lot

**Stryxen** (9): go on ms del rey reclaim that feminine power (I wrote this before the ig post)

**waluigiest** (9): the opening couplet is unmatched

**WeastofEden44** (9): the little xylophone accents in the background make me ascend

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.5): One of the many songs that references other songs on the album, and some of the best lyrics. No albatrosses here!

**koolkatkeeley** (8): when this came out it became my favorite Lana song and then Venice bitch arrived.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (7.9): Some of the lyrics in the verses are stunning but the melody isn't quite strong enough for me to keep this on repeat

**fadedblue09** (7.7): Some of the sing-talking in the verses irritate me a bit but otherwise it’s okay. The song gets points mostly for the lyrics.

**thatgreekguyraul** (7): A solid song with some decent lyrics, but it feels too long and runs monotone by the end.

**vayyiqra** (7): You seem so out of context / In this gaudy apartment complex / A stranger with your door key / Explaining that I'm just visiting / And I am finally seeing / Why I was the one worth leaving That's what this song always reminds me of, and it's not quite as good as that song, but it is one of the best songs on this album. Side note: I really like the genderbending lyric "I'm your man".

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): i love this song it's such such a high tier album it's near the bottom for me

**vhqv1997** (6): Well it's no Love or West Coast

I wasn’t expecting to see this song reach the top 3, but this surprise is a very pleasant one in my eyes. From the second I heard that piano intro, I knew I was in for a treat here. When I heard her say “you fucked me so good that I almost said I love you,” I was transfixed. In this song, Lana talks about a love interest who is insufferable and pretentious, and as pop music fans, I think a lot of us can relate to that topic… Lines like “your poetry’s bad and you blame the news” really drive in the point of the song in a uniquely fitting way that I instantly appreciated. If all of that wasn’t good enough, the song closes out with a subdued yet alluring outro that ties this song together in the best way possible.

---

**-nox-** (11): Surprisingly not a hard choice even with all of the 10s in this rate.

**cyborglilith** (11): h

**gannade** (11): so peaceful & so powerful

**willamsextrai** (11): This is the one. I hate to recycle every stale opinion that everyone has ever spouted about this song but it has to be said I struggle to find a song that holds as much weight as an album opener for me. Everything in it's right place by Radiohead comes close. An album's opener is a statement piece for me when it's done right; a statement of intent. A kind of 'listen here you little bitch I'm about to take you on a journey'. The aforementioned Radiohead track does it well. The difference between their prior work and this one track grips you. They've taken on a new direction and make it clear that this is a new Radiohead for a new millennium. What Lana does better here is done through subtlety. She doesn't shake you out of your seat like Radiohead. She hasn't too dramatically changed her production like Radiohead. Her lyrics still discuss whatever it is that she's been ranting about on Insta these past few weeks and she's still making weird 50's allusions in the name. But when she says 'Goddamn man child' it's just a little nod to her not reinventing herself but still not being able to bring Lust for Life to the phone because that album is dead. As someone who did not enjoy her last offering at all but has always been such a fervent fan of her music, this was such a return to form that she hadn't given me in years that it holds such a dear place in all of music for me frankly. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

**1998tweety** (10): God damn what a good opening line. The rest of the song is beautiful too, especially the outro.

**Awkward\_King** (10): YOU FUCKED ME SO GOOD THAT I ALMOST SAID I LOVE YOU

**bibliosquire** (10): what an opening song omg

**Brendon-Urine** (10): you know you're in for something with the opening lyrics

**CarlieScion** (10): goddamn,,,, man child

**cremeebrulee** (10): i remember staying up to listen to NFR the album at midnight, worried about how it was gonna sound because of the shitty rollout and as soon as I was a couple of seconds into this song I knew this album was gonna be amazing. killer opening

**DaHumanTorch** (10): obligatory “opening line most iconic thing ever” comment

**fadedblue09** (10): DIdn’t expect this to be the best opening track but wow she slayed here. Also the production is gorgeous.

**fishingfor8** (10): Godamn, man child you fucked me so good I almost said i love you. That’s the best opening line of 2019 I swear.

**freav** (10): This song is so good it's kinda ridiculous

**leviswift13** (10): this is for man-child you big fat white nasty smelling fat bitch why you fuck me so good that i almost said i love you

**mudkip1** (10): she snapped on this opener holy shit

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): when we rated the main pop girls i kinda said billie's invisalign thing was the only valid album opener, but what i really should've said was that it was one of two valid album openers.

**SFbby** (10): Iconic opening line

**shesdoingyoga** (10): “Why wait for the best when I could have you?” - Lana deciding on the title of her next album

**skargardin** (10): THIS is how you start an album, pure magic

**Stryxen** (10): men ominous music

**survivorjdmarina** (10): One of her most iconic album openers. "Goddamn, man child" gets me every time ugh

**TiltControls** (10): While it didn't get my 11 (very close though!), this is a great start to the album!

**vhqv1997** (10): Who are Norman and Rockwell?

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): this song gives me life. the lyrics are just so well written and the piano part is beautiful. the best way to open an album.

**waluigiest** (10): what a PERFECT introduction. This song projects the persona she’s built over the last decade and immediately topples it. When she hits “why wait for the best when I could have you?” it’s completely over

**WeastofEden44** (10): literally so fucking stunning

**Yatcho** (10): Grew from an "ok" on first listen to one of my top 3 on the album now. The opening strings are an instant collapse now and the opening line is iconic. This is her best title track and I won't hear any arguments against it

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.8): Great start to the album, whenever I play this I want to keep listening to the rest of the album. "Your poetry's bad and you blame the news"

**bulforster** (9.5): "That's the tea sis" - Anthony Fantano

**Nickl00** (9.5): one of her best choruses and some of her best vocals

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (9): Scathing lyrics, amazing instrumental.

**BatesNorman** (9): notice how father john misty has not released a song since this was released

**bespectacIed** (9): This sounds gorgeous, can't deny. The piano is very Shadowboxer but i guess that's why I like it. Goddamn woman-child why did you have to be racist

**chillbumps5** (9): this album would be so incel if you switched the genders, it’s honestly baffling but stans aren’t ready for that conversation.

**heckwes** (9): bluueueueueueue

**jlaca123** (9): Excellent opener

**koolkatkeeley** (9): what a gorgeous and lush opener.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): "Your poetry's bad and you blame the news" is an all time best lyric for Lana

**rotating3Dtext** (9): idc, opening the album with those lines is kinda iconic

**sarcasticsobs** (9): what an opening line. don’t care if it was ever confirmed its about father john misty

**shaniquasharkesha** (9): One of the best song opening lines

**wavingwolves** (9): "your poetry is bad and you blame the news" is such a good burn. drag him, yes!

**zadooi** (9): This song makes me feel bad about myself

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): it’s all about that opening stanza

**samf79** (8): Gorgeous opening

**skaiansightseer** (8): great moodsetter

**almdudler26** (7.5): (sorry!)

**twat\_brained** (7): You call your lover a manchild yet behave like a womanchild on instagram foh

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5.5): "why wait for the best when I can have you" is a great line. It's a good thesis statement for the album, just doesn't do it for me melodically

**thatgreekguyraul** (5): The lyrics are a bit boring.

**vayyiqra** (5): First of all: that opening line isn't as clever as everyone thought it was. Yeah, I said it. Secondly, I might be biased towards this song because I am 6'2". However, I just don't like it that much. The piano-heavy instrumental is setting the tone for what is to come on this album, and it's an underwhelming opening track when all her other albums have very strong openers.

I knew that this was probably going to be the highest rated Lana song from the first day - it was in second place from the beginning and never switched positions at all. This song is a perfect 70s soft rock ballad, complete with a guitar solo that is reminiscent of the 70s rock bands that everyone has heard on the radio and Lana’s soft yet uniquely powerful vocal delivery. Lyrically, this song discusses nostalgia, especially in relation to music, past relationships, and the world at large. While the song is strong throughout, my favorite part is the outro, which references the false nuclear bomb alert in Hawaii and Kanye’s devolution over the past few years. I’m normally not a big fan of long/drawn-out Antonoff outros, but it works perfectly here as a mellow closer to the song. This song isn’t my personal favorite off of the album, but it’s an excellent top track for Lana in this rate.

---

**1998tweety** (11): Dare I say this is one of the most important songs in Lana's career? I'm sure most of you know that Lana has talked about American in a very idealistic and glamorized way throughout her entire career. This song is basically the realization that none of those things are true and that the country Lana once loved doesn't exist anymore (if it ever did). Couple that with Lana finally getting the long-overdue praise she deserved, this song really feels like the capstone of this era of Lana's career. Context aside, the chorus on this is incredible, I can't understand what she's saying half the way time but wow it feels like I'm soaring. The instrumental break is great too. The one thing I could do without is the 1-minute long outro, could've easily been half the length. The song spends nearly the last 2 minutes winding down, I really would've liked one last push with an explosive bridge, but that aside the song is still amazing and gets my 11.

**cubascastrodistrict** (11): wow this song is amazing. I’ve never heard a song articulate this kind of generational hopelessness before. The lyrics are probably Lana’s most subtle, describing a feeling without ever explicitly saying what that feeling is, and it makes the song hit so hard. And god the production is perfect. The guitar solo in the middle, the quite piano and guitar strums that close out the song. This is a legitimately perfect song.

**heckwes** (11): the song that got me into lana...reminds me of taking buses around india

**motherstyx** (11): sounds like a classic

**rickikardashian** (11): not many songs have been able to capture the feeling of nostalgia as well as this. this is a punch straight to my gut

**therokinrolla** (11): I'd lie if I said this song didn't hit the same after Lana's latest... Events. When this came out it was kinda immediately my favorite album ever. I remember my first moments listening to it which??? I cannot say the same for any other album lowkey. This song exemplifies the depth of decay Lana sings about so deftly across the album. It's an all encompassing viewing of the rot of the things Lana used to idolize. Damn, how meta at this point. I used to adore Lana. Absolutely adore her. Now I roll my eyes and whatever she says. Is she long and gone as she described Kanye in this song? Idk. This song feels like one of the grandest statements of last decade in pop still and it somehow still fits in the stupid character arc Lana has foolishly decided to carve out for herself. She's not the greatest loss of them all, but she is one that hits me hard.

**Yatcho** (11): This is one of her best songs ever. A long, lush, dramatic piece in the vein of Ride and Heroin, it really stands above the rest of this excellent album "Don't leave I just need a wakeup call!" crushes me every time

**altiondsols** (10): would have been my 11 if the outro were shorter. this is just the perfect soundtrack to nostalgia itself

**Awkward\_King** (10): its weird that this isnt the closer but hope is such a good closer too

**bibliosquire** (10): jack antonoff really shines on the production here

**CopyCatJ** (10): Thank You Kanye, Very Cool!

**DaHumanTorch** (10): ended kanye. also i have noticed that for every song I want to comment “one of my favorites”…its just that good

**enofisenough** (10): would be my 11 if it weren't for Cellophane :/

**fishingfor8** (10): I technically like NFR and MAC better than this song but they are all so good it doesn't even matter.

**hunnybee12** (10): nostalgic soft rock always hits

**InternetDude19** (10): What a chorus.

**jlaca123** (10): Another flawless one

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): It's too much. LDR's perfected the sad but beautiful California nostalgia, and this is a song I could get lost in. The reference to Dennis Wilson is really somber, and I love the idea of "Life on Mars?" being more than a song now (not to mention the other references at the end of the song). The greatest

**leviswift13** (10): so close to my 11 it hurts. i have been thinking about these lyrics so much as the world around me has changed and morphed into something very different. i guess that i AM burnt out after all.

**Nickl00** (10): lives up to the title

**plastichaxan** (10): so many tens in here wow

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I've gotta say I never expected Lana to do a self-titled track

**skargardin** (10): This song captures the feel that the world is ending, which it is.

**Stryxen** (10): this was the song that made me listen to the album, so it was an 11 contender. anyway… ugh her mind the way she predicted her future

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Legendary, iconic, a song for a generation, we want this Lana back

**vhqv1997** (10): Let's discuss: why is it okay to say "lit" in songs, but not "tweet"?

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): this was nearly my eleven. wow this is so flawless. one of lana's best melodies, her best lyrics, a gorgeous instrumental. definitely a highlight from nfr.

**waluigiest** (10): the writing and delivery here shine

**wavingwolves** (10): cathartic

**almdudler26** (9.5): lana what the fuck is up with the capitalisation on this album

**BatesNorman** (9): This song is both great but also overrated within the album cause there's like 5 or 6 better songs than it

**koolkatkeeley** (9): Appropriate title for this song because it is truly one of the greatest songs Lana Del Rey has ever made.

**realboxwood** (9): It's great but it also absolutely sounds like the kind of thing a white woman in her 30s that starts an instagram rant with "Question for the culture:" would write

**skaiansightseer** (9): one of the few tracks that encapsulates late 2010s culture without seeming hackneyed

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (8.6): So close to being obsessed with this one but I don't love the lyrics or the delivery of certain lines. The melody and instrumental is so good though.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): this is beautiful but she loses points for “the culture is lit” and the Kanye line after putting her foot in her mouth lately. more tone deaf than her SNL performance smh

**shesdoingyoga** (8): Something about this one just doesn’t click for me as much as most of the other songs on the album

**thatgreekguyraul** (8): The outro has the best lyrics.

**twat\_brained** (8): very beautiful but AGAIN WITH THE LONG OUTROS SIS

**WeastofEden44** (8): Really good song but tbh, never connected to it the ways others have

**fadedblue09** (7.9): Cute Titanic Rising reject. The guitar solo is a highlight, but that outro was super weird and felt like forced social commentary.

**chillbumps5** (7): This song starts out with a great first line “I miss Long Beach and I miss you” then proceeds to get more and more pretentious and obnoxiously self-important as the lines go by. The “Kanye West is blond and gone” line has the same energy as one of those woke high school theatre shows that SNL parodies sometimes. But kudos for confidence. Edit: after further thought the Kanye line is OK, the problem is that it sounds shoehorned into the song: there’s no lyrical flow to it or rhyme or cleverness.

**freav** (7): My favorite in the second half of this album.

**vayyiqra** (5): This is not the greatest but it's alright.

**mudkip1** (1): I'll get roasted for this but it has never clicked with me and i've given it a LOT of chances

**bespectacIed** (0): I won't be able to explain how much I hate this song w/o being an anti-lana bitch (i'm not, my scores on some of the songs here will prove). This has some of the worst songwriting I've ever heard on a song, especially the outro. Lana should never be allowed to say the word "culture" ever.

**Overall Average**: 8.242 **// Average Controversy:** 1.688

---

**laurent1683** (9.600): This is a 10 factory. It produces those like Canada produces Maple Syrup. Objective : Serve 404 : Error not found Objective completed

**-nox-** (9.540): Who knew Lana Del Rey and Jack Antonoff working together would result in such a masterpiece? Everyone. Everyone knew. And yet this album is still shockingly amazing. Not even joking, I feel so lucky that this music is in my life that it makes me shed real fucking tears. GOAT.

**skargardin** (9.467): This is Lana's magnum opus. Every little intricate detail works perfectly, her voice and lyrical poetry have never been more on point on any of her other albums. I'm perched to see where she can go after this but for now, this is the pinnacle of her output.

**DaHumanTorch** (9.333): one of my favorite albums of all time. too bad looking for america was included in the rate (still confused by that??) cause otherwise this would have gotten a perfect 10 average from me

**CopyCatJ** (9.267): Top 5 album of all time for me

**thunderbird\_14** (9.167): Messy era, good album, messy post-era

**leviswift13** (9.133): this is how you make an album. everything lana has created in her career climaxes in this dreamy, violent, dark, romantic, lush, sun-drench california fantasy. i always have a hard time picking a fav moment. is it the way it gets so quiet at the end of love song or the fact that she opened the album with the line "goddamn man-child, you fucked so good that i almost said, 'i love you'"? is it "kanye west is blonde and gone" or "if he's a serial killer then what's the worst that could happen to a girl who's already hurt"? truly an album for the ages. God bless miss lana del rey.

**therokinrolla** (9.067): I feel like such a clown that this is literally my favorite album ever but what can ya do.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.067): Since I was in the top 1% of Lana Del Rey fans on Spotify in 2016, I think I’m qualified to say that this is her best album. I have a sentimental attachment to Lana’s music because I consider her the artist that really got me into the music I listen to today. I first found her in 2015 after hearing Young and Beautiful, and then from there I found the rest of her music and was obsessed for about a year before I started listening to a wider variety of artists. This album feels like the culmination of the rest of her work with the best parts of every album before it combined into one masterpiece. The lyrics, vocals, production, everything about it is just so good! This is actually probably the album of hers that I’ve listened to the least because it almost feels too good for me to listen to it too often, since that would ruin it for me like I’ve ruined other albums by listening too much.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.033): This album deserves all the acclaim it gets. It feels like the culmination of everything Lana's done in her career and a realisation of how to put it all into one project.

**gannade** (9.000): maybe i am a reycist

**Yatcho** (8.973): It was hard to reconcile at first for BTD stans and Honeymoon truthers like me but yes, this IS her best album

**stardustanddinos** (8.967): This, for me, is still the best record of 2019. More like a greatest hit record than a standalone one, this album highlights Lana’s talents for gorgeous melodies and intimate, cutting songwriting that have come to define her in the past decade. She is at her best, singing of love and heartbreak, but in a manner markedly less toxic than her previous albums. She celebrates the pessimism and resignation that come with love, the bleakness of the world pouring into one’s lives, something that we don’t see addressed often. From the album cover to the lush instrumentation of each track, this is her magnum opus, a best of the decade album, revealing her as auteur of pop culture in her own right.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.913): My favourite album of the year (Titanic Rising was a close second). I've put this on during many long drives and it remains just as exciting and enjoyable

**cyborglilith** (8.880): masterpiece

**survivorjdmarina** (8.867): Lana is my main girl, and obviously I loved this album. Everything has basically already been said about this album, but it’s all true. The lyrical content is the best of Lana’s career, Jack Antonoff did great in producing this, and it just feel... complete. This was not the most critically acclaimed album of 2019 for no reason!

**cubascastrodistrict** (8.733): I wouldn’t really call myself a Lana stan. I she had some good albums and some bad albums. But this one is one of my favorite albums ever. It is so good. Every song here feels so powerful, and she manages to make Jack sound like he’s really producing something different for her, rather than just using his sound.

**cremeebrulee** (8.667): this was my AOTY last year and i was so excited to write my thoughts on it but unfortunately after all the BS lana pulled on IG i don't think i can gush about it as much as i used to. regardless this album is very special to me and i would not mind any of these songs winning even though i didn't give any of them my 11 lol.

**mtachi** (8.667): This was actually my most played album last year - truly fell in love with it so much. It was just a step up for Lana is so many ways.

**Stryxen** (8.660): help I can’t stop listening to this album. I’ve been listening to it while I go to sleep so much that my brain struggles to sleep without it now. it is so cinematic and atmospheric, sad but optimistic (sometimes). She can paint such a picture with music. Also, I LOVE the album cover literally a moment.

**hunnybee12** (8.633): 8.7 one of my favorite albums of all time. it became the soundtrack to a somber time in my life. but considering the past few weeks, I’m not sure I’ll enjoy her future albums the same :/

**Brendon-Urine** (8.600): Really really really love this album, by far by favorite of Lana's. Like all the stringed instrumentation is just so beautiful and her lyrics are amazing.

**willamsextrai** (8.587): I can put this album on and suddenly an hour has passed and I need to listen to it again because I have in fact zoned out. This is like one of those songs where you feel that if you're not paying attention to your favourite bit, you have to restart because you need to give it everything, but its a whole album of that feeling. It is sublime and I struggle to verbalise the way I get so much enjoyment out of it. It isn't a perfect album, a couple of the album's middle tracks (sorry Cinnamon stans) drag on for me but I know that as soon as I hear the strings opening the album that I'm about to switch off and just feel happy for a while. There are maybe 7 tracks I could give my 11 to in this rate and 5 of them are on this album. It isn't a perfect album but its pretty close in my opinion.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (8.487): One of my fav albums of the decade. Definitely her best album.

**waluigiest** (8.327): I need to tell an anecdote about this album. In September 2019, I had two job interviews with one day in between. I was feeling sick, and was fully bed-ridden with flu symptoms on my day off. It was sweltering and I just laid there, all day, sweating and hydrating and listening to this album on loop. Fully catatonic. I was fully incapacitated. I woke up the next day and felt.... fine. I aced my interview and have been employed at this organization for nearly 8 months. I could say something substantive about how much I love this album but I’d rather thank Lana for getting me that coin 🤑🤑🤑

**WeastofEden44** (7.933): Easily Lana’s best imo. I really like the bulk of the album even if I don’t fully “connect” to it, and tbh I’m not sure if I will ever fully resonate with Lana and her art. Beyond her recent statements, I just don’t think that she is fully for me which I think is fine. She clearly has a LOYAL fanbase and that’s really great for her. Truthfully, this is the album that got me on board with her at all. I had enjoyed individual songs and the bulk of BTD, but never really “got” her the way others on this sub have. I’m happy I have this album because it really is great and I’m so happy Lana got the acclaim she’s been working for with this album.

**twat\_brained** (7.840): Easily Lana's best work but Ultraviolence is not far behind for me

**skaiansightseer** (7.733): impeccable first half but after sublime comes in i kind of lose the plot-- it feels like there are a few too many songs here that are just pretty good torch songs

**zadooi** (7.633): I know All Mirrors was praised, but All Mirrors deserves the praise this album got. NFR has too many average songs to be considered a classic imo. A part of me wonders if some of the praise is reparations for how Lana was seen early in her career. I like Lana's music, but I've never seen her as this profound artist of a generation.

=====

bbfan132: **wavingwolves** (7.533): there's nothing about this album that hasn't already been said, so the only thing i'll say is that i love listening to it and i hadn't loved an album from lana since ultraviolence. this came like a breath of fresh air.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.440): even before her dumbass shenanigans this album had kinda worn down on me. it just doesn’t have the same magic the other two do for me

**wanderingimpromptu3** (7.433): She has a talent for gorgeous yet catchy melodies, and somewhat infuriatingly mixes 70% insightful, beautiful lyrics with 30% awkward out of place ones. As a whole, it's an excellent and cohesive album, although it lags a bit in the middle.

**samf79** (7.300): The album that made me really fall in love with LDR. Great lyrics, great instrumentals, and provided the soundtrack to summer 2019.

**InternetDude19** (6.920): I'd never really cared for Lana before this album, NFR made me do a full 180 (crazy) on her and her discography.

**vhqv1997** (6.767): Okay so I know we all unanimously agreed this to be her best album because Pitchfork said so, but I mean this still suffers from the same problems many Lana albums have: long, drawn out sequences with filler tracks. Meanwhile, how is it that we've all forgotten Ultraviolence?

**freav** (6.667): I love the first 2 songs so much, wish the rest clicked too but it's kind of a drag.

**fadedblue09** (6.380): Confession time: this is the first Lana album I’ve heard in full and all I have to say is....I didn’t get it :/ It’s by no means bad but I don’t think I got the hype. I do appreciate her songwriting for the most part, but more often than not I am thrown off by certain lyrical choices such as the random cussing or certain phrases that just sound immature or bizarre (maybe it’s her quirk? idk). Also, for an album with a 9.4 rating, there’s a lot of songs here that I find unremarkable and they’re almost thematically redundant. The impression I got is that this album, as well as Lana herself, is very insular and comes off as alienating for casual listeners. Edit: Just found out Antonoff produced most of this album. Maybe that’s the culprit....

**vayyiqra** (6.067): Doing this rate, I think I finally "get" this album. When it came out, I did not like it at all and found it to be overlong, slow, and boring, and I love Lana's music - I've stanned her since I first listened to Born to Die in 2012. That is still my favourite album by her, and this is my least favourite, but I respect that there is some great songwriting on here. My scores still have some hot takes that not everyone would agree with but I'm glad I can say I now at least enjoy the album on the whole.

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (5.933): Like everyone else I have things I'm very particular about in my music, and delivery of lyrics is one of mine. I think that really affected my opinions of this album. I think many of the melodies and pretty much all the piano is brilliant but there are certain quirks she has in her delivery that aren't for me.

**thatgreekguyraul** (5.200): As I revisit this album, I feel that it lost a lot of the charm it had when I first heard it last year. Maybe it is my preference for simplicity, but Lana's lyricism seems so messy, vague, and overly detailed. Lana starts off a song by painting a story then she sidetracks herself and it just creates an overall confusing narrative. At her sixth album, she proves to not be versatile when it comes to diversifying her production, vocals, and lyrical topics. Furthermore, it truly holds no central theme. It mostly feels like she writes just to write - with no true purpose. The album also suffers from being too bloated. A healthy track list length typically ranges from 9 to 11 tracks for me; at 14 tracks, it feels overwhelming.

It wasn’t even close. From the beginning, this song was #1, and the only thing that changed was how high the score was. At one point, the average was as high as 9.900, but it ultimately settled at 9.686 (which is still an excellent score and easily ends up landing in the top 20 songs overall). After a long period of time without releasing any music, FKA twigs put out this atmospheric ballad that was unlike anything else we had heard from her. In this song, twigs reflects on her role in her relationship, along with the relentless harassment and racist attacks she received from British media outlets. This might be a piano ballad (which we know /r/popheads does not love…) but it is delivered with so much passion and raw emotion that it easily hooks the listener. If the song didn’t do it for you at first, I would urge you to watch the outstanding music video, where FKA twigs showcases the often maligned **art** of pole dancing, followed by her ascending and then descending into an image of herself. When you combine the song with its music video, you can easily see why both this subreddit and /r/indieheads ranked this song at the top. They speak for themselves.

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (11): This was the first song I heard from the album and I couldn't stop listening to it. Then I watched the video and I couldn't stop listening to it while crying. Luckily I've cried myself out to this one (I think) and now I can just listen and appreciate the beauty. I had so many 10s in this rate but there was no doubt in my mind I'd be giving this my 11. It's just stunning.

**bespectacIed** (11): Pendulum is Twigs' best song

**CarlieScion** (11): didnt i ,,,,, do it for you ,,,,,

**CopyCatJ** (11): basic choice for the 11 but it was my most played song of 2019

**cremeebrulee** (11): i was like debating several lana songs to give my 11 to, but in the end i think this song beats out any of those lana contenders. there's something so vulnerable about this that hit so close to home. the video alone took my breath away. so yeah, no contest about this 11 at all.

**DaHumanTorch** (11): this isn’t my favorite song on the album (though certainly a close second) but the music video is what pushes this ahead for my favorite on the album and my 11 in the rate. it might be my favorite music video of all time, it’s just pure art. every single time i watch it, i go into the same trance, it’s just beautiful and stunning and i can’t say enough about it. a masterpiece

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): The voice control on this song is incredible. FKA twigs easily changes her voice throughout the song to display such a complex array of emotions, and that makes every part of this song so good.

**enofisenough** (11): yes ma'am best song of 2019

**freav** (11): This is the song that makes me understand all the hype and praise for her, also kinda makes me wish I liked this album more overall. It's gorgeous, not much to say.

**hunnybee12** (11): a year later and I still can’t listen without crying. there are so many potential 11’s in here for me but this song is just otherworldly

**leviswift13** (11): "didn't i do it for you? why don't i do it for you? why won't you do it for me when all i do is for you?" so simple. so haunting. this song is arresting. it hypnotizes you with shame and pain and defeat. it feels like a moment late at night realizing, on the verge of tears, that it's gone and lost and love doesn't win in the end. it is an all-timer for me. "they're waiting, they're watching, they're watching us, they're hating, they're waiting and hoping i'm not enough."

**mudkip1** (11): my SOTY for 2019 hands down. it's immaculately crafted, poignantly delivered, effortlessly dramatic, and simply jaw dropping. i keep coming back to it and i'm never disappointed. cellophane is flawless! AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE MUSIC VIDEO???!?!?!

**shesdoingyoga** (11): This was the first FKA Twigs song I ever heard, I saw the comments on the release thread for it last year and decided I would give it a shot. Immediately after listening to it, I went back and listened to the rest of her discography because I was blown away by the song and needed to hear everything else that she had released. The lyrics and production can be seen as simple compared to the rest of the album, but their effectiveness comes from the simplicity. Her voice is dripping with emotion throughout the song, and the way she sings once the melody goes up an octave gives me chills every time I hear it. I’ve spent a lot of time with all 3 of the albums in this rate, and this song is hands down the best song from any of them. If this is robbed because of balladphobia in a rate where most of the songs are already slower and less upbeat I will be disappointed but not surprised

**Stryxen** (11): I will never forget the first time I heard this song; it changed me. also after watching the music video I fell down a youtube rabbit hole of pole dance competition videos and I would just lie in bed to watch them for an hour straight instead of doing anything productive

**survivorjdmarina** (11): My favourite song from 2019, possibly one of my favourites ever. The song that made me fall in love with FKA twigs, with its harrowing, clinking pianos, and emotional, powerful vocals. This song is the textbook example of a song being classified as art. I can’t talk about this song enough. I love it so much.

**ThaCoolness** (11): imagine being fka twigs and when you sing this is what you sound like. the sheer emotion in this song is unreal. absolutely flawless masterpiece

**thatgreekguyraul** (11): Simply art. It strings at the heart. You can truly feel the sadness, anger, and frustration in her voice. My favourite song of 2019.

**TheBoySmiles** (11): Theme of cell-f loathing and total cry anthem- absurdly beautiful.

**1998tweety** (10): Saving the (2nd) best for last. What a way to end an album. Knowing the context of this song and the relationship around it really brings this song to a new level. I wish I could give multiple 11s ughhh

**Awkward\_King** (10): robert pattinson cant fuck for shit

**BatesNorman** (10): i gave this song an 8.5 in the pitchfork rate in r/indieheads but it grew on me

**bibliosquire** (10): the best closer to an album. It’s absolutely heartbreaking and it means so much to me personally

**bulforster** (10): Cultural and artistic reset.

**chillbumps5** (10): yeah this is the tits

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): you DID do it for me queen

**cyborglilith** (10): iconic

**fadedblue09** (10): Save the most vulnerable performance for the last! This is just heart-wrenching.

**Geography3** (10): my fourth fave on the album

**InternetDude19** (10): What else is there to say?

**jlaca123** (10): Absolutely perfect

**kappyko** (10): this is gonna win lol

**koolkatkeeley** (10): first time I heard this song I cried. It’s perfection. The music video is also one of the best music videos ever. Twigs is a goddess among us puny mortals.

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Vulnerable and incredibly beautiful. It feels like the whole album builds to this towering, cathartic moment. What an ending: everything about it clicks perfectly into place

**Nickl00** (10): one of the best vocal performances I’ve heard and it’s rawness is incredible

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): this song does do it for me

**RandomHypnotica** (10): as much as I want Lana to get the win, I'm all but certain this is going to take it. And that's fine with me. Cellophane is simply beautiful. Words can't do it justice, it's just so raw, so pretty, so vulnerable and so emotional

**realboxwood** (10): tbh this song kind of feels like it works better as a single than as the album closer but we're giving it a 10 anyways yes

**sarcasticsobs** (10): there is nothing that hasn’t been said tbh

**skaiansightseer** (10): an eleven in my heart-- the most immediate and emotional reaction i've ever had to a piece of music was listening to this the day it came out

**TiltControls** (10): Perfect end to the album. The production here is fantastic! Close contender for my 11.

**twat\_brained** (10): you're not doing "it". You're doing EVERYTHING. You deserve to win this rate and nobody else. I'm certain it'll be either this or Mary Magdalene which wins, but either way I am absolutely HERE for it.

**waluigiest** (10): a perfect closer. It collects the thoughts, insecurities, structures, and soundscapes of the album in such a wonderful way.

**wavingwolves** (10): possibly one of the most achingly heartbreaking songs ever recorded. we love having our insides completely destroyed by a song! yes, make me miserable, queen!!!

**WeastofEden44** (10): This song blows me away every time I hear it, one of the most vulnerable vocal performances I’ve ever heard

**almdudler26** (9.5): not bad

**Yatcho** (9.5): The video is a fucking cultural RESET. Video of the Decade shit

=====

bbfan132: **Brendon-Urine** (9): I mean everyone loves this track right? The piano is beautiful, her singing is beautiful, and it all comes tighter so well. It ends kinda weird (which is sad that it's also the closer of the album) but it's still an incredible song.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): i know this is most likely winning and i’ll have to be all angry again that fka won a rate even tho i have the winning song an 8~~.5~~

**vayyiqra** (7): I feel bad because this is such a heartfelt song and I know it's good but I just don't enjoy it that much. It is pretty though.

**fishingfor8** (6.5): In the end I want Lana to win, NFR was just that good.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (6.3): You can really feel her emotion, I wish there was more of her lower register in this song

**gannade** (3): i know everyone likes this but it doesnt do anything for me. like it sounds the same the entire way through and fka does the weird thing with her voice, which would be interesting if the production varied at all. idk it feels both unnecessarily complicated and overly simplistic at the same time

Apprehensive_Guest: Personally I don't think you were being bothersome in the chat! In terms of it losing, I think having 3 tracks out of the top 5 is doing pretty well and if you mean not winning the number 1 spot, I think it would be hard to tell whether her behavior is the reason why considering she still did so well. 

From what I read in the chat, her behavior influenced peoples' comments in the chat much more than their actual scores for the rate. Naturally people are going to comment on her ignorant actions, but I don't think she would have done this well if it really swayed the scores by a lot.

Awkward_King: i mean i disagree because clearly we were rating her music, she had three songs in the top four clearly her music was rated well, but she was trashed non stop in the plug, but that's how it always is with controversial figures in rates

bbfan132: # MAGDALENE

---

**Overall Average**: 8.458 **// Average Controversy:** 1.567

---

**bespectacIed** (10.111): One of my favorite albums of all time. FKA Twigs is the greatest artist of our generation

**laurent1683** (10.000): My favourite. Every song except holy terrain makes me cry and fall into a deep state of scary loneliness

**thatgreekguyraul** (9.889): There are simply no words that I can use to describe just how beautiful, heartbreaking, and rich this album truly is. The production is so voluminous while also being abrasive and experimental. It stays in touch with Twigs' best strengths. Her vocals are so emotional, and they easily penetrate and bruise the heart. You can genuinely feel the raw and painful feelings she underwent during the writing process for this album so well. A masterpiece and a true testament to her artistic drive.

**DaHumanTorch** (9.778): this album is like a trap banshee howling her heart out while prancing near a lake under the pale moonlight and im here for it

**Stryxen** (9.756): I was obsessed with this the first time I heard it and I just know my score is going to be stupidly high. She takes everything I love about her work, doesn’t hesitate to take risks, and combines it all while telling an interesting story, where every song is consistently linked thematically and sonically while all staying distinct. I can appreciate why some people might not be into this, as it’s a bit of an acquired taste, but I would say this is a must listen for any music fan

**thunderbird\_14** (9.667): Hands down my AOTY last year. It’s different for her yet its so twigs-y.

**CopyCatJ** (9.667): 10/10 record thank you twigs, also i used our mutual love of this album to slide into a goth girl's DMs

**leviswift13** (9.556): holy fuck. what the fuck twigs how you doing this shit. this is not something she just fucking made this some professional like this shit is in different areas! this story is so tragic and powerful and entrancing. the allusion and metaphor of mary magdalene and Jesus feels so nuanced and natural, it's so perfectly intertwined with her own trauma and fear and sadness. this is art. like this is how you make a fucking album.

**-nox-** (9.544): In terms of being a work of art that tells a story, this album is actually unmatched. To me, it feels like walking through quicksand in the middle of a cathedral. The infinite nuances of her soul in a time of sorrow and vulnerability can literally be felt through her music, and we have to appreciate how fucking rare that is.

**skargardin** (9.333): This album is so meticulously crafted i CAN'T. sad day, home with you and daybed are som of my personal favourites. Hell, home with you still scalps me on every listen.

**twat\_brained** (9.300): There is music. Then there is recording art. Then there is high art in the form of music. MAGDALENE towers well above all of that, however, and is my 11th hour pick for Album of the 2010s, narrowly beaten by Melodrama.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.278): This was one of my most anticipated albums of 2019 even though I had only started listening to FKA Twigs earlier in the year, and it did not disappoint. MAGDALENE stands out compared to the other two for it’s more electronic and experimental elements that it utilizes to great success, and the individual songs on the album stand out compared to each other more than the other two albums where some of the songs can sort of blend together. My one complaint is that the album isn’t longer, but it doesn’t really need to be longer because it does everything that it needed to in 9 songs.

**WeastofEden44** (9.222): A masterpiece. One of the most beautiful and haunting works I’ve ever heard. The production is remarkable, Twigs sounds fantastic, and the songwriting is superb. I was initially whelmed by it but have come to adore it upon multiple relistens.

**survivorjdmarina** (9.111): Cellophane was my introduction to FKA twigs, and this album made me an even bigger fan. Its blend of genres like orchestral music, jazz, EDM and hip-hop are all embedded through the weird and eclectic production choices featured on this album. It sounds rich, dense, and deserves all of the acclaim it’s received.

**zadooi** (9.056): I love music with winter/night vibes and songs like Thousand Eyes and Mirrored Heart give me both. The album is short and sweet, never making you check how much of the album is left. It says what it has to say and it leaves a strong impression because of it.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.033): Such a beautiful and cohesive piece of art.

**waluigiest** (9.000): the first time I listened to this album I was walking to a joann fabric hehe. Anyways this album blends the beautiful and the grotesque so well it’s honestly a masterpiece

**willamsextrai** (8.989): Its weird, I have given this album the highest scores on the whole and I recognise that her choices on this record are breath taking. But it just misses something. To even say it misses something is probably an overstatement of the problem I have - my friends have heard more than enough about how I am obsessed with this album and will attest that I have no problems with it. Maybe its her consistency. I expect nothing less than excellence from Twigs because she has only ever delivered excellence. Lana's album somehow stands above this one; not because it is better, its not, but because I didn't expect Lana to be able to compete with a Twigs' record. So in summation, this album is excellent and I should just delete this comment.

**skaiansightseer** (8.889): incredibly high highs, but some shaky/overly experimental tracks that haven't quite clicked for me yet.

**cremeebrulee** (8.822): while i love/listen to lana's album more, this album is so captivating to me. i love how sonically interesting it is but also rich lyrically. this is the perfect background music for when u just wanna lost yourself in a daydream. twigs really snapped on this, hope cellophane grabs the win!

**hunnybee12** (8.667): 8.6 it’s an amazing listening experience that does not have any glaring weak spots. like somebody said on here once, fka twigs is the bjork of this time

**fadedblue09** (8.556): I’ve only heard “Two Weeks” from her prior to this, so I had no idea what to expect. And all I can say is....I’m very impressed. If I had to pick one word to describe the album, it’s divine. The haunting instrumentals, the versatility of her vocals which spans a range of emotions, the imagery of her lyrics...all provide a very solid listening experience that really shows her vulnerable side. Every element really details her experiences and nails the concept she’s going for. Maybe I’m just a sucker for vocalists in general, but I felt like this was the only album here that lived up to the hype. I should definitely check out more of her music.

**vhqv1997** (8.556): No song on this album was Good For You or Pendulum, unfortunately

**BatesNorman** (8.444): pretty crazy how the song titles are all lowercase but then the album title is all caps

**InternetDude19** (8.367): One of my favorite albums of last year. I had never listened to twigs before and I was blown away.

**cubascastrodistrict** (8.000): I like this album a lot, but it’s definitely my least favorite album in the rare. I think often it feels a bit too easy. The melodies are so poppy that they stop feeling interesting to me, even though the lyrics are quite good. The somewhat distorted production helps a lot, but I don’t think this reaches the heights of her “Melissa” EP which is just incredible. I still love the album, but not as much as the others here.

**stardustanddinos** (7.889): this album is one of the most heart-rending depictions of heartbreak I’ve heard in pop music. Twigs is pining, weak and vulnerable. She fights her demons, loneliness and insecurity with impassioned vocals and rich, layered production that accentuates the sadness throughout. Bjork seems to be a major influence on this record. I will admit though – I had trouble connecting to this album on a few songs, I hope more listens will correct that.

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.756): Incredible high points, and as someone who puts a lot of value in closing tracks, this album is an incredible achievement. I love how the songs, especially specific moments, stand on their own, yet everything leads perfectly to Cellophane
[/r/popheads/comments/hdad3o/2019_ultimate_pitchfork_acclaim_rate_day_2_hope/fvklyfh/]

=====

bbfan132: **mtachi** (7.667): A great album but I will never forgive Twigs for that cover art. She had such beautiful singles and then... that. Take it back, take it back!

**RandomHypnotica** (7.333): I was never much of a fan of Twigs previous works, but Magdalene definitely connected with me much more, even if a lot of the lyrics are a little too abstract for me to appreciate

**freav** (7.000): Cellophane is incredible, the rest is not quite there for me yet but I get why somebody would love this kind of thing

**vayyiqra** (6.889): Like Titanic Rising, I didn't quite get the hype for this album, though I enjoyed it more. At first I found it boring and low-energy, but it has a nice ambience to it and I like her use of religious themes in it (being raised Catholic myself, I can say that for all its flaws the religion does have some good music and aesthetics). I still think I prefer FKA twigs' electronic/R&B sounds but this is a very personal and vulnerable album and I can appreciate it for doing something different.

**chillbumps5** (6.444): incredible production and then FKA Twigs sings like she’s hyperventilating: the album

**wanderingimpromptu3** (6.278): It's a really tight and cohesive album conceptually with a few songs that REALLY work for me, but sometimes I appreciate what she's doing intellectually but don't find it super pleasant on the ears (usually on songs that are heavy on her upper register)

**Brendon-Urine** (5.889): I'm super disappointed in how little I like this album. Outside of the best track it's just kinda meh, which is surprising because I thought I would love it.
