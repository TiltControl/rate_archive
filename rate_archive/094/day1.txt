Hello everyone, and welcome to the first day of the **2019 Ultimate Pitchfork Acclaim Rate Reveal**! For the past month and a half, I have been receiving all of your scores and this weekend, I am finally going to reveal the results! These songs have been switching placements left and right since the first day, so the only hint I will provide for people who want to spectate this is to expect the unexpected.  

Today, I will be revealing #34-18. Join me in this thread to discuss the results and follow along. You can also listen along with me and others in the [plug.dj room](http://plug.dj/popheads) (let's pray that it doesn't mess up too much...). The rate reveal will start at **2 PM EST**, so make sure to be there at that time!

Was this surprising at all? I personally love ambient music so I was hoping that this wouldn‚Äôt place last, but it wasn‚Äôt meant to be unfortunately. On a 10 track album, it does kind of feel like a waste to have 2 ‚Äúinterludes,‚Äù but they don‚Äôt hurt the album so I won‚Äôt complain too much. Like some of you mentioned, I wish that she replaced this track with Titanic Risen, which is a 4 minute song (with lyrics/beautiful vocals) that rivals some of the best tracks on this record.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): this interlude sounds like the album looks like

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the fact that this instrumental interlude is better than entire albums... that‚Äôs talent sweaty! it feels like diving into the depths of the ocean

**realboxwood** (10): Wow I can't wait for popheads to give this great interlude the score it deserves and not underscore it just bc there's no lyrics!

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Gorgeous instrumental track. I feel like I am floating in the void of space.

**wavingwolves** (10): a perfect little bridge between something to believe and movies

**almdudler26** (9): this just fits the album so perfectly

**DaHumanTorch** (9): why‚Äôd i like this better than the 4 songs so far i-.....this was so gorgeous and mesmerizing

**sarcasticsobs** (9): I feel like I am in the motion picture Annihilation (2018)

**sawayamas** (9): honestly I know this is just an instrumental interlude but it's absolutely beautiful and a perfect transition into the second half of the album

**WeastofEden44** (9): Going off the title, it really does sound like tragedy reversing

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): Kinda the musical equivalent of swimming when you think about it

**bibliosquire** (8): wacky and fun!

**InternetDude19** (8): I kind of wish that the whole album was stuff like this.

**rickikardashian** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o9uviqORW4

**thunderbird\_14** (7.5): The inferior interlude.

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.3): Instrumental tracks don't last very long in rates so I won't get too attached

**Stryxen** (7.1): I like when artists separate their albums‚Äô distinctly separate parts. But this is still just nothing to talk about. BUT I don‚Äôt want to bring down my album average too much

**1998tweety** (7): I mean it's pretty I guess

**4Roux** (7): A deep inhale to prep you for movies

**donniechubbs** (7): i guess lol idk

**koolkatkeeley** (7): a great ethereal interlude, but it‚Äôs just an interlude so it‚Äôs not as high as the rest.

**leviswift13** (7): some points down just bc it is a cute interlude moment, but it does really nicely prepare us for movies

**ThaCoolness** (7): obviously don't listen on its own typically but very nice interlude to head into movies

**twat\_brained** (7): wait that's it? It's a decent instrumental I just expected lyrics to go along with it

**zadooi** (7): This and Movies are the only songs that I feel fit the album cover.

**BatesNorman** (6.5): it feels wrong for this song to be weighted the same as all the other songs in this rate when it‚Äôs a short interlude that is fine in the context of the album but its gonna tank the average score for the album (1)

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (6.1): It is a beautiful piece but I don't personally feel attached to it or its purpose in the album.

**cremeebrulee** (6): as far as interludes go its pretty forgettable

**heckwes** (6): boring

**jlaca123** (6): Doesn't seem fair to rate this alongside the songs with vocals, but alas.

**minibjork** (6): my consciousness preparing for the ascension Movies is about to put me through

**Nickl00** (6): it‚Äôs nice I guess

**skaiansightseer** (6): it's pretty, but it's an interlude

**skargardin** (6): It's fine as an interlude but I could've done without it to be quite honest.

**vayyiqra** (6): Short, but kind of pretty.

**Yatcho** (6): It's just an interlude. A pretty one, but yeah just an interlude

**shesdoingyoga** (5): It‚Äôs pretty but the other instrumental track is better

**vintagebathingsuit** (5): beautiful but it didn't really...go anywhere?

**fadedblue09** (4.4): I usually love interludes, but this one felt like it could‚Äôve been more engaging, especially considering how significant its placement is.

**RandomHypnotica** (3): It's an interlude shrug

**waluigiest** (3): it‚Äôs not a bad instrumental but... it doesn‚Äôt do anything?

**wanderingimpromptu3** (2): I mean it's fine but an instrumental interlude with nothing interesting in it at all doesn't need to exist? At least the other songs have nice lyrics

**CritneySpearz** (1): ok...

**fishingfor8** (1): is this really needed? it doesn't add anything to the album so i'm just confused. I guess this exists just to put it over the double digits mark for the tracklist so that it actually feels like a real album.

And with this, the interludes/instrumental pieces are officially out. On a 10 track album, it does kind of feel like a waste to have 2 ‚Äúinterludes,‚Äù but they don‚Äôt hurt the album so I won‚Äôt complain too much. This song is a beautiful outro, but there isn‚Äôt that much substance to it apart from the strings. Judging from your comments, I think that my opinion is probably the consensus of the participants.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): stunning

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the melody from A Lot‚Äôs Gonna Change bringing us full circle ugh her mind

**realboxwood** (10): Wow I can't wait for popheads to give this great interlude the score it deserves and not underscore it just bc there's no lyrics!

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Great instrumental closer.

**almdudler26** (9): god this album is so good

**bibliosquire** (9): a great closer

**fadedblue09** (9): Now we have a good interlude! I‚Äôm really just a sucker for strings lol.

**rickikardashian** (9): we should have included titanic risen in this rate

**wavingwolves** (9): mirrors the first track very effectively and it's lovely

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (8.5): Great finish to the album. Love hearing themes from the other songs return, and it's beautiful by its self as well of course.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): i loved the melody and how it calls back to the opening track. we love a cyclical moment

**InternetDude19** (8): It's a weak ending, but it still sounds nice.

**motherstyx** (8): Listen to the Japanese exclusive ending track, it‚Äôs so beautiful and has new lyrics in it- https://youtu.be/JFYuJ5xpw-4

**sarcasticsobs** (8): strings, baybee

**thunderbird\_14** (8): I can‚Äôt be too harsh on an interlude, especially, one with strings <3

**zadooi** (8): An instrumental can work as an album closer, but this one does not feel like a closer. Still really like it as a song tho.

**twat\_brained** (7.8): this gets a high score from me since it's short and there's no more album left so I can finally hear Twiggyüòäüòäüòä

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.5): A lot's gonna change: reprise. I know this will probably be in the bottom 3, but it's a nice way to bookend the album

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): This is an interesting way to close an album, but I actually kinda like it. It's got a really interesting melody

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): A nice outro

**Stryxen** (7.2): I‚Äôm writing this at 2 am and I was going to make a joke about Nearer to Thee being the same title as Closer by The Chainsmokers and be like ‚Äúomg play Nearer ft. Halsey‚Äù but then I realised this is just after Picture Me Better and it could be an inappropriate joke but THEN I remembered the shitposts for Soon You‚Äôll Get Better (jail) and listen before i go and realised it‚Äôs not as bad as them and then FINALLY I realised it also isn‚Äôt funny so I gave up and wrote this instead.

**1998tweety** (7): I mean yeah

**BatesNorman** (7): it feels wrong for this song to be weighted the same as all the other songs in this rate when it‚Äôs a short interlude that is fine in the context of the album but its gonna tank the average score for the album (2)

**cyborglilith** (7): I don't like it as an album closer, but it could work as an interlude.

**Nickl00** (7): love a nice call back

**skaiansightseer** (7): the motifs!!! the motifs are back!!

**skargardin** (7): Cute outro, strings are the way to my heart

**waluigiest** (7): torn about this. It‚Äôs a better instrumental bit than titanic rising, but ending the album with an instrumental outro???? without even using an intro/overture??? a choice. But probably a good one because of how it plays on the little motifs of the album

**WeastofEden44** (7): This is beautiful but feels more like an interlude than an actual album closer

**koolkatkeeley** (6): a nice way to wrap up the album.

**leviswift13** (6): a lil disappointed we don't get to hear a lyrical ending to the album's story. i mean it's obvi gorgeous, it just doesn't satisfy me as a closer in the ways the other closers in this rate do

**shesdoingyoga** (6): The better instrumental track because it connects to the first song

**vayyiqra** (6): I like when albums have bookends like this.

**cubascastrodistrict** (5): I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about this closing track. I get the idea of using a similar melody from the first song on the closing song, but I find the ending of Picture Me Better much more impactful I guess.

**heckwes** (5): what

**Yatcho** (5): Chromatica III teas

**enofisenough** (4): these interludes just don't do it for me Ms. Blood

**TiltControls** (2): it's fine, it's an instrumental track, not much more to say about that

**CritneySpearz** (1): the best part about this song is that it means the album is over...

**DSporachd** (0): Honestly just a pointless little stinger on what is otherwise a perfect album it takes what would have been the perfect closing song and extends the album by a minute just to leave the listener on an unresolved note remove this track and the album ends beautifully

**fishingfor8** (0): another random instrumental to make it last longer.

**vintagebathingsuit** (0): this track kind of feels pointless to me.

I honestly only added this because I wanted the rate to have an even number of tracks, but I enjoy the ambient feel of this track, even if it is pretty short and unmemorable. It didn‚Äôt place last, so I guess it wasn‚Äôt a total waste to add this song?

---

**gannade** (10): LANA. WHY. DID. YOU. NOT. INCLUDE. THIS. ON. THE. ALBUM. BUT. INCLUDED. THE NEXT BEST AMERICAN RECORD. üëèüëèüëèüëè

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): bizarrely this is the first lana track i ever listened to. the production here is just so stunning if you listen to all the tiny details.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.7): I hadn't heard this prior to the rate, but now I love it. It reminds me of Joni Mitchell in the best ways. Striking contrast between the desperately beautiful vocals and the charged lyrics, and Lake Placid's a special place to me

**almdudler26** (9): it's good!!!!!!

**chillbumps5** (9): one of her best vocal performances

**nootnoot781** (9): lana, it's directly below canada and above mexico. can you see it now? also should've been on the album

**rickikardashian** (9): im so excited for lana to finally release the sequel to this song where she addresses racial inequalities and police brutality with the tact and beauty she‚Äôs shown to have about those topics

**twat\_brained** (8.6): Christopher Columbus on his expedition before he'd be remembered as a murderous colonizer whose monuments deserve to be desecrated. Keep protesting and tearing down those statues.

**jlaca123** (8.5): Actually very solid ---- I forgot this existed. Very pretty, and meaningful, if a bit clich√©, lyrics.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): I'm glad this was included in the rate, it really works well with NFR, and the track in general gets underappreciated due to it's release

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): This feels like a sequel to Coachella ‚Äì Woodstock in My Mind

**BatesNorman** (8): This isn't even part of the album smh

**bibliosquire** (8): a great message but I‚Äôm kind of glad it wasn‚Äôt actually on the album

**fishingfor8** (8): I understand why this song wasn't on the album it doesn't fit at all. Still like it though.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): not a big fan of america at the moment tbh, but pretty song!

**skargardin** (8): A cute standalone moment.

**thunderbird\_14** (8): Okay McCarthy. Jest, I‚Äôm a sucker for a good melody and I‚Äôve already listened to a lot of acoustic songs so I‚Äôm a sucker. The Witch‚Äôs a 10 though for Guillermo.

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): Eh... the mixing‚Äôs a bit off for me but the message is great. Lana whyyyyy did you have to ruin your reputation...

**cremeebrulee** (7): this walked so that only the young could walk slower

**leviswift13** (7): this song is so lana i have a hard time believing it wasn't made with one of those bots who make up shit based on past work

**Nickl00** (7): it‚Äôs ok and shows off how good her vocals are

**skaiansightseer** (7): shout out fresno!!

**Stryxen** (7): wow it's so cool of us to do a bonus rate with only one song

**1998tweety** (6): This is alright but like why is it here lol

**InternetDude19** (6): It's pleasant, but i don't feel that it is noteworthy in any way.

**koolkatkeeley** (6): it‚Äôs a good song, but one I don‚Äôt return to very often.

**waluigiest** (6): I‚Äôm honestly torn about this. It‚Äôs simple and sweet, but the ideology is tricky from an artist who built her brand from a very idealized americana

**fadedblue09** (5): Ehh I appreciate the effort but the social commentary feels more of an afterthought.

**realboxwood** (5): yaaas return to norms centrist queen!!!

**vayyiqra** (5): Counting the cars on the New Jersey turnpike, they've all come to look for America nobody on Popheads will know what that song is. Oh well. I've never heard this before and it's okay.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5): Pretty but doesn't feel fully developed as a song

**willamsextrai** (5): There's a reason this didn't make the cut for the album. Hearing it alongside the other tracks, it is so jarring. The production is simple, which can be said occasionally for the album tracks, but it just isn't the same standard and says a lot for Jack Antonoff's imprint on the album, assuming he wasn't involved in this track (or my no knowledge mouth if he was).

**vhqv1997** (3): Judging by the last 3 tracks of the main album and also this, I imagine her next album will just be a spoken album of her poertry

**Awkward\_King** (2): this is ironic in retrospect lana del reycist

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): this song is a Nothing burger and tbh considering this was already the longest album it really didn‚Äôt need to be added

**DaHumanTorch** (0): i'm really annoyed this was in the main rate. it...isn't on the album? so why are we rating it? it ruined my average for nfr im fuming. anyways, lana should never comment on politics again as even before her whole controversy this came across as extremely disingenuous

**thatgreekguyraul** (0): From a lyrical standpoint, this song is good. However, given the recent controversy surrounding Lana - from the Instagram essay comparing her struggles to mostly women of colour, her defensive and passive-aggressive response to the backlash, and her dating the most famous cop in America (yes, I know they broke up, yet they are still friends and she is complicit in giving him a platform) - this song and her actions are an oxymoron. That is why I am rating this song a 0.

**wavingwolves** (0): disingenuous

This is probably the song that grew on me the most out of any track on NFR. Its simplicity threw me off at first, but that‚Äôs precisely what makes it work - it‚Äôs a straightforward piano track with cryptic lyrics, but that combination intrigues me and makes me enjoy the song more than I did at first. I‚Äôm not surprised to see it go out early, but if you didn‚Äôt like this on your first listen, I‚Äôd urge you to listen to it again or at least read the lyrics to gain a deeper understanding of what she was going for here.

---

**BatesNorman** (10): rates always more fun if you're drunk

**DaHumanTorch** (10): one of my favori-t-t-tes on the album

**gannade** (10): everyone hates this but i love the way she said bar-t-t-t-t-t-ender

**minibjork** (10): this song is to blame for my cherry coke dependency

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): ha ha ha ha

**bibliosquire** (9): this song is so fun

**RandomHypnotica** (9): this one took a while to click for me, between some really interesting lyrics (warm like a gun) and bar-t-t-tender, but I ended up really appreciating it's place here.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.6): Bar-t-t-tender

**fishingfor8** (8.5): The chorus feels like you are swinging it's weird

**jlaca123** (8.4): Pretty, but not as good as the others.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): being nitpicky for a second, I can't hear "wine" and "fine" together without thinking of Three Dog Night's "Joy to the World", and the staccato of the word "bartender" works once every chorus. Repeating it one bar after the other is unnecessary and takes away from its novelty. Still far better than like half of Lana's back catalog.

**almdudler26** (8): the "bar-t-t-tender" bit is cute tho

**cubascastrodistrict** (8): I like this song more than most people I think. I find the story of her stealing a truck to see some guy without the paparazzi catching on pretty hilarious, but also meaningful.

**koolkatkeeley** (8): this was a huge grower for me and I love the way Lana says bar-t-t-tender.

**shesdoingyoga** (8): I like the more stripped back instrumental on this one, especially coming after the last few songs

**skargardin** (8): Cute

**Stryxen** (8): bart listening to this song: üò≥

**survivorjdmarina** (8): Not my immediate favourite but it‚Äôs nice

**thunderbird\_14** (8): The song that grew on me the most since there were mainly (if only) a piano accompaniment. The imagery, the desperation, ugh, if only I was half as rich as her.

**waluigiest** (8): the way she says tender and you can hear her tongue is unsettling but I can‚Äôt stop listening to it

**WeastofEden44** (8): Me 5 vodka crans in

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): barTTender

**Yatcho** (7.4): They way she sings BaAartEndr is a little grating but I don't think this song is as bad as people say and not the worst on the album for sure

**Nickl00** (7): one of the only song that doesn‚Äôt really hit, but far from bad

**TragicKingdom1** (7): t-pain and akon outsold

**InternetDude19** (6.5): I like to sing along with this one.

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): the stutter on "bar-t-t-tender" is annoying

**1998tweety** (6): This is the 1 meh song on the album for me, skip it every time.

**Brendon-Urine** (6): The ending of this album is definitely a lil meh at least compared to the first two thirds.

**leviswift13** (6): i'm so sorry this is the one i can't do the way she pronounces the t in bartender gives me actual anxiety i was driving once listening to this album and almost had to pull over and stop because i was this close to having a panic attack sry lana

**wavingwolves** (6): i really like some parts of the chorus, especially the melody when she sings "photo free exits from baby's bedside cause they don't yet know what car i drive" / "baby remember i'm not drinking wine but that cherry coke you serve is fine" but everything else is a little meh

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5.5): Song is cute and v catchy

**fadedblue09** (5): Meh, piano melody is too boring to carry the song. Regina Spektor did it better.

**heckwes** (5): bart T T T T Tender yuck

**skaiansightseer** (5): i dislike the stutter in the hook

**vayyiqra** (5): I like the part when she says "bar-t-t-tender" and I can't quite figure out what it's about other than classic Lana themes like soda, being held, and substance abuse.

**yelling\_tortoise** (4.5): corny lyrics, even if production/singing is nice

**thatgreekguyraul** (4): Nothing interesting about this track. Also, every time I listen to this song, I can't help but think of Homemade Dynamite by Lorde, since both singers stutter when they pronounce the song title.

**bulforster** (3.5): I wish she wouldn't-t-t do that, it's very uncomfort-t-table.

**vhqv1997** (3): This song is 4 minutes too long, it's literally just Lana reading a poem

**vintagebathingsuit** (3): ehh this track has few redeeming qualities to me. the piano is nice. it just feels like a filler track to me.

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (2): I know this is my own hang-up for having misophonia but the "t-t-t-t" drives me crazy. It sucks because I like some other parts of the song, but I still had to give it a low score because of some of the lines and certain parts which I don't like.

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs trying to do asmr and she shouldn‚Äôt

**mudkip1** (0): hate the way she emphasizes certain consonants in the word bartender

I‚Äôve seen a lot of people say that this version is vastly inferior to the original demo, but I personally think that this version is just as good as the demo. This song is pretty lethargic and is easily one of the least memorable tracks on NFR to me, but it‚Äôs serviceable and it works within the context of the album.

---

**-nox-** (10): Most underrated track on this album imo.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): well‚Ä¶.she did write the next best american record so good job self manifesting

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): it literally is

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I feel like there‚Äôs no point in scoring these songs if I‚Äôm going to just give them all good scores but they all deserve them

**Yatcho** (10): Anyone that says that the lyric changes from the leaked original ruined this song has no taste whatsoever! If anything I really appreciate the lyric changes, gives the song a much deeper meaning when you see that her opinion on this person has changed drastically from when she first wrote it. Also the chorus in the original was just not good, "Topanga's hot tonight, I'm taking off my bathing suit" is a serve, and the production is really giving BTD throwback

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): Verses and pre chorus are so haunting and the sparse production really works, the chorus just isn't at the same level which is super frustrating since I love the rest so much

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.1): Nice comedown down from the high of California, I just love the nostalgic vibe here. The lead-up to the chorus is catchy and sweet, and when the chorus hits it's intoxicating. Makes listening to the Eagles seem cool somehow

**CarlieScion** (9): this would have been my 11 if it was the original leaked version. but alas

**heckwes** (9): meta

**jlaca123** (9): Great song. Doesn't pack as much of a punch as the rest until the second half of the song, though.

**plastichaxan** (9): very underrated in here

**skargardin** (9): Im running out of things to say on this album, it's just excellent ok?

**survivorjdmarina** (9): Loved it at first but it‚Äôs waned for me tbh

**twat\_brained** (9): apparently the demo was more cynical and scathing? You can keep that demo. I like this version as it is.

**almdudler26** (8): why did she change the lyrics from the leaked version!!!!

**BatesNorman** (8): fuck america ayy

**fishingfor8** (8): good enough

**leviswift13** (8): tbh i'm always just waiting for it to end so i can get to the greatest

**Stryxen** (8): ugh I hate that she sometimes makes me wish I lived in America

**thunderbird\_14** (8): inb4 leak > real

**1998tweety** (7.5): I really like bits of this: the way Lana sounds so bored and barely opening her mouth on the verses, to the explosion on the chorus. Unfortunately, they don't go together so well and the title is a bit of a mouthful. The demo was so much better.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): ‚ÄúCool as heck‚Äù Lol why is she suddenly giving Kidz Bop lyrics? Either way, it‚Äôs fine, passable filler, just like most of the album (could‚Äôve trimmed a minute or two, I guess).

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.4): eh it‚Äôs nice

**bibliosquire** (7): it‚Äôs kind of boring but it‚Äôs still got that Lana rough

**Nickl00** (7): the original was better, and you can tell it‚Äôs from lust for life and it‚Äôd be a pretty medium song even on that

**willamsextrai** (7): The lowest point of the album imo is probably a little unfairly judged by me. On any other Lana album this would be a solid track but given how divine the opening six songs are, I would have happily taken 11 tracks of her best work over this reworking of a past reject. That said its still so good that I felt guilty enough to give this justification of my rating.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): I like the glass that breaks though

**hunnybee12** (6.5): the original overshadows it completely. without the satirical/bitter lyrics the song is a snooze

**minibjork** (6.5): ok but that chorus makes me go ??? verses r ok

**cubascastrodistrict** (6): this is the song on the album I am most mixed about. It‚Äôs fairly obvious that the production was done in another Lana era without the input of Jack. I think if she had let jack rework it a bit to make it more cohesive with the album and a little less overproduced, it would be much better.

**koolkatkeeley** (6): I‚Äôve been waiting for this since Lust for Life and I was disappointed because I think it drags the album down.

**skaiansightseer** (6): feels like a mediocre warmup for the next song

**vayyiqra** (6): This is not the best American record but it's alright.

**WeastofEden44** (6): Never really connected with this song, weakest on the album

**wavingwolves** (5.5): well this one surely isn't the best american record

**gannade** (5): easily the worst song here

**thatgreekguyraul** (5): It has some good lines; the concept is quite witty. However, the lyrics are a bit repetitive and it tends to follow the same thing Lana does in most of her songs.

**vintagebathingsuit** (5): this song drags and is honestly a chore to get through. worth it for the bridge though.

**bulforster** (4): I forgot how much this album starts to drag after a certain point.

**freav** (4): Why is this song so loooonggggg.

**RandomHypnotica** (4): not only does this version sound worse than the leaked Architecture, it also just feels really out of place on NFR, and feels more like Lana wanting to give fans the song because people liked the leaked one.

**Awkward\_King** (3): well this is ironic

**kappyko** (3): the chorus is a real bummer

**realboxwood** (3): Man I completely forgot about all the weird moments in this song because I never listen to it because it's boring as, in Lana's words, heck

**bespectacIed** (1): she failed

**vhqv1997** (0): This is a nice rough draft, I wonder when she will release the finalized version of it

**waluigiest** (0): ngl this was my 2019 album of the year but she‚Äôs racist so I‚Äôm giving her worst song a zero

Honestly, for me to give this a 7 is pretty generous considering my original opinions of this track‚Ä¶ I initially disliked it, finding it to be quite basic and unlike anything else FKA twigs released in a bad way, but it‚Äôs grown on me. Is it probably her weakest track? I‚Äôd say so, but if another artist released it, I‚Äôm sure it would be appreciated more, so I have to acknowledge that. Some of you didn‚Äôt hold back though...

---

**-nox-** (10): Quite possibly my favorite trap beat of all time.

**Awkward\_King** (10): ok future's verse is like objectively mediocre but this song slaps and i'm giving it a ten because it's going out on day 1 anyway

**BatesNorman** (10): this song slaps you guys are just nerds

**bespectacIed** (10): I never understood the hate. Ritualistic chanting + trap beats = art. Twigs lyrics more than made up for future's meh verse

**CopyCatJ** (10): Future is the best part of this song, nerds

**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): If this song didn't have Future on it it would be my 11. Twigs' part is so exquisite both musically and lyrically, and then there's Future, who seems to have gotten the memo "this is about vulnerability and love" but just can't muster more than a shallow imitation. It's like the Lover Remix, you write a perfect song, why invite some dude on it to ruin it?! But despite that, I couldn't stop listening to it and I've trained myself to ignore most of Future's lyrics

**cremeebrulee** (9): i really like this feature? not sure if that's a popular opinion

**skaiansightseer** (9): possibly controversial but-- future works really well here!! he provides a rhythmic and timbral counterpoint to Twigs while adding lyrics that fit the theme of love and betrayal and forgiveness.

**Stryxen** (8.9): I like future‚Äôs verse :)

**twat\_brained** (8.7): this is one of Future's better features in recent memory

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): this is REALLY overhated. while i didn‚Äôt love future on it, i still think it‚Äôs an amazing track. jackoff / skrillex really snapped with this production, it went off. i love trap twigs

**enofisenough** (8.5): this song gets too much hate

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Invented art-trap. (also sue me, but this isn‚Äôt even my lowest rated song on this album).

**fishingfor8** (8.5): Future really goes off

**minibjork** (8.5): i can't believe i didn't like this on the first listen ... my bad twigs

**ThaCoolness** (8.5): its a bop don't care

**Yatcho** (8.5): Fuck the haters, this is a massive bop made better than most run of the mill trap songs by Twigs' heavenly voice

**bibliosquire** (8): if future wasn‚Äôt on this it would be higher

**hunnybee12** (8): this is gonna get slaughtered, isn‚Äôt it

**InternetDude19** (8): The hate this gets is undeserved.

**jlaca123** (8): Really enjoyed this track! I didn't think the feature added much to it, though.

**leviswift13** (8): another grower for me, but once i got it i really got it. future representing kind of the history of men is super impressive and interesting, and the story between them feels really fleshed out.

**Nickl00** (8): this song gets too much hate. It‚Äôs a banger

**plastichaxan** (8): don't get all the negativity towards this

**realboxwood** (8): it's pretty good

**sarcasticsobs** (8): take out future‚Äôs actual verse but leave in the ad-libs PLEASE

**skargardin** (8): Future's part isn't all that, i'd much rather have this be a solo twigs song

**thatgreekguyraul** (8): While a bit generic in its production, its verses are very descriptive and truly redeem the track from being mediocre.

**thunderbird\_14** (8): Overhated, but I can see why would many people would rate it lower in relative to the other tracks. I will not, however, accept if ya‚Äôll gave it below 7.

**vayyiqra** (8): This isn't a popular take but this is the song from this album that stands out the most to me and that I remember the most.

**waluigiest** (8): she counts to Day 3 so confidently even though racistheads won‚Äôt let this live past Day 1

**wavingwolves** (8): the fact this is a twigs song produced by jack antonoff and skrillex is so weird to me but it still works nicely. it's overhated, for sure, and it doesn't deserve it!

**WeastofEden44** (8): Get‚Äôs too much hate. Yes, it‚Äôs conventional by Twigs standards, but it still SLAPS

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): if this is first out this sub is racist

**yelling\_tortoise** (7.1): even if future's verse and ad-libs are super mediocre, this song is over-hated. the beat is really intricate, reminiscent of some LP1 qualities. her lyrics may seem clunky at first but the way she winds and weaves all these words into a rap-like hook somehow smooths out.

**1998tweety** (7): I'm meh on this one. Don't really feel like Future is needed, but that aside its kind of meh for a Twigs song.

**freav** (7): Does r/popheads also hate this song for whatever reason like r/indieheads does

**koolkatkeeley** (7): I like this song which is apparently an unpopular opinion. It‚Äôs good, but it‚Äôs not great.

**RandomHypnotica** (7): anyone who writes this song off for being a "basic trap song" is missing out (but the Future feature can go)

**shesdoingyoga** (7): On its own I really like this song, especially Twigs‚Äô vocals, but sonically it really does not fit in with the rest of the album so I‚Äôm fully expecting this to be out early on Day 1

**survivorjdmarina** (7): Well... it‚Äôs cute I guess

**vintagebathingsuit** (7): fuck off, future.

**PointlessBibliophage** (6.5): don't really care for the song and also why is future here

**Brendon-Urine** (6): Loved this song when it came out, but definitely not as in love with it. Still an awesome music video and I love the beat.

**nootnoot781** (6): ho(w to ruin a 10/10 album)ly terrain

**vhqv1997** (6): I mean it's not a bad song, it's just something that I expected Ariana to do, not the person who brought us Good For You and Two Weeks. Like, both of those songs are kinda mainstream and accessible, but it's still very her.

**shaniquasharkesha** (5): love twigs' vocals on this but the Future verse and oversimplistic production kinda ruins it for me

**jman457** (4): too many cooks (producers) in the kitchen can spoil the broth.

**chillbumps5** (2): why does Ariana Grande sound like FKA Twigs?

**mudkip1** (1): what an unbelievable disappointment to have this be the follow up single to cellophane

**bulforster** (0): Not an original take but I don't think Future works here and even makes Twigs' lyrics feel overwrought by comparison. The production credits also seem to imply a too many cooks situation.

**LazyDayLullaby** (0): holy terrain't

I get why people don‚Äôt like this track all that much, but I‚Äôve loved it from the start. It has a mysterious and lethargic atmosphere to it that works perfectly with the song‚Äôs theme of depression, and I admire the unique lyrical structure with its odd personification of objects.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): I said earlier in the rate that mary magdalene has my favorite lyrics in the album. I lied, daybed has. Every line in this song resonated with my soul and could be lyrics of the decade. But "Fearless are my cacti / Friendly are the fruit flies" is the ACTUAL lyric of the decade. Like, i'm just whiplashed by that line, idk why. "Possessive is my daybed" would be a great tattoo

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): she really sang "faux my cunnilingus"... iconic

**realboxwood** (10): https://imgur.com/n3W4orc

**Stryxen** (10): if only I could give this a 10.1

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Great lyrics and vivid imagery. Love the structure and rhyme of the entire song, almost feels like a poem.

**vhqv1997** (10): So her dad's name is Jaden? Okay

**waluigiest** (10): the most slept on track of this album. The way this song physically feels like a depression is OUT OF CONTROL!

**bulforster** (9.5): The fact that the lyrics are nonsense but I felt like I understood them from the first listen... her MIND.

**DaHumanTorch** (9.5): this song captures depression so beautifully and poignantly, though i still don‚Äôt get the part about her cacti. also ‚Äúactive are my fingers, faux my cunnilingus‚Äù üíÄ

**fadedblue09** (9.5): We stan unconventional song structures! Her voice slays as always and the instrumentation in the last verse is just holy.

**bibliosquire** (9): I don‚Äôt know what the fuck she‚Äôs saying but I‚Äôm vibing

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): social distancing mood

**leviswift13** (9): girl i've been here

**samf79** (9): grows and grows and builds, and turns into a really special experience

**sarcasticsobs** (9): some lyrics get weird but still really, really dig it

**thunderbird\_14** (9): In these trying times, we need a sad anthem about masturbation.

**WeastofEden44** (9): It‚Äôs like floating in the ocean while the sky starts to crumble and fall around you.

**twat\_brained** (8.6): I'm not sure if she's saying answer or ulcer in the chorus

**1998tweety** (8.5): I like this. Some of the lyrics can be a bit meh though so I'll drag it a bit.

**jlaca123** (8.3): I thought it was a bit boring at the beginning, but it really picks up by the end.

**koolkatkeeley** (8): twigs captures the depression so well. I love it when she sings lonely are my cacti/friendly are my fruit FLIEESSSSS. An understated and delicate masterpiece.

**shesdoingyoga** (8): I appreciate the way Twigs uses the lyrics, production, and song structure to represent her experience with depression, but after three amazing songs and before one more, it just feels a bit lacking in something

**untutorable** (8): but WHAT are her cacti????

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.2): The way it builds slightly toward the end makes the transition to cellophane utterly glorious

**BatesNorman** (7): nightchair

**cyborglilith** (7): iconic

**skaiansightseer** (7): putting a song about being sad and masturbating in between the two most heartwrenching songs ever written is a genius move, actually.

**survivorjdmarina** (7): I don‚Äôt listen to this a lot tbh.

**InternetDude19** (6.5): We stan songs about masturbation and fearless cacti.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): "fearless are my cacti"

**ThaCoolness** (6.5): ehhhh this song goes nowhere

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (6.3): I don't love the lyrics or delivery in this one. Her voice is immaculate as usual but this song isn't one I'd put on if it's not playing through with the rest of the album

**yelling\_tortoise** (6.2): ends up sounding more like it's TRYING to be gigantic instead of actually sounding gigantic. at least, that's the quality that sticks out most. it doesn't give you enough to make waiting for the payoff worth it.

**fishingfor8** (6): The last song I‚Äôm rating so I might as well use it to sum up my thoughts on the rate since this song is incredibly average compared to the tohers. This was a hard rate because the Weyes Blood album was just meh for me and Fka twigs‚Äôs album I respect more than I like. I really love the Lana album so there‚Äôs a pretty clear winner for me

**vayyiqra** (6): It's nice but doesn't really go anywhere.

**zadooi** (6): This is probably gonna be one of the first ones out and as much as I love this album, that's tea.

**Nickl00** (5): I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs he was going for here but her voice is great as always

**wavingwolves** (5): "empty is my sweet thing" get a dildo, girl, i recommend it

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): twigs really said play with my pussy while i sing poetry to you

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): Too repetitive

**Brendon-Urine** (0): The pacing of this song is just not it. So slow, nothing interesting instrumentally, and doesn't go anywhere. Like the instrumentation builds up a bit which is cool but it's definitely not enough to save the track.

I think I can safely say that this song was robbed. This song drew me in from the moment she sang ‚Äúno one knows‚Ä¶ but yooooooouuuuu‚Äù in the deepest register possible for her. The lyrics bring this song up for sure, but it is sonically lush as well. Listen to it again if you gave it a low score!

**vhqv1997** (9): Sidenote: I desparately wanted All Mirrors by Angel Olsen to be rated alongside these albums, but since it isn't: Yall, Stream It.

**wavingwolves** (9): the way this just opens with "no one‚Äôs ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you‚Äôve been through"... like OUCH!!!!! i guess

**Yatcho** (8.7): The verses are a little lackluster but the chorus more than makes up for it and has some of the most beautiful melodies of the album

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.5): The second best mirror song in the rate. Love the chorus

**leviswift13** (8): this where things start to get a lil samey, but situation circumstance always gets me

**Nickl00** (8): everything about this album just feels so clean and makes everything sound even more beautiful

**skaiansightseer** (8): weyes blood ended baby boomer rhetoric with one line!!!

**survivorjdmarina** (8): It‚Äôs sweet

**untutorable** (8): not to pit two very talented art pop ladies against each other but angel olsen kinda outsold

**1998tweety** (7.5): Cute but drags a little

**BatesNorman** (7.5): all mirrors

**koolkatkeeley** (7): a heavy, but lush song.

**plantp0wer** (7): the first line really takes me out: ‚Äúno one‚Äôs ever going to give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you‚Äôve been through, no one knows but you‚Äù

**shesdoingyoga** (7): This song has the misfortune of being stuck between Movies and Wild Time, and it is already the most forgettable song on the album for me so this track placement really hurts it

**skargardin** (7): This is fine but it feels so overly long compared to Movies. Movies does a lot more with its time tho.

**twat\_brained** (7): okay, this album's almost over, looking forward to my girlie Tahliah

**yelling\_tortoise** (6.7): how could you possibly follow up movies? I think this was bound to disappoint, but even so, the song is kinda boring. low energy overall

**bespectacIed** (6): kinda boring but gorgeous instrumentals

**cubascastrodistrict** (6): I don‚Äôt like the production here as much as the other songs.

**heckwes** (6): what...this is too long

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Eh, it‚Äôs mostly fine in every aspect (save for the awkward chorus melody), but I feel like it didn‚Äôt need to be this long. I also felt like the album started to lose its steam at this point.

**vayyiqra** (5): Nice but not captivating or anything.

**waluigiest** (5): I just wanted this to be bigger

**wanderingimpromptu3** (4.3): I like "we love our love" and the orchestral vibes, sounds nice but not memorable

**fishingfor8** (4): really boring

**bulforster** (3): This song is so unpleasantly oppressive compared to how lush the rest of the album is.

**mudkip1** (1): nothing about this FIVE MINUTE LONG song works what was she thinking? sis if you make a song that isn't cohesive or even remotely good you can always just scrap it

This is an unsettling intro to this wild album. It may be one of the less interesting tracks here, but it still works in its own way and sets the stage for what is to come.

---

**-nox-** (10): Perfect opener for this album. I vividly remember the first time I heard this song.

**bespectacIed** (10): Brilliant opener. Set the tone of the album well. It sounds like a medieval funeral dirge, I am living

**bibliosquire** (10): I love this song so much. It‚Äôs so powerful

**bulforster** (10): Bold move to make your intro track the second longest on the album. Good thing this one earns every second.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): stunning intro to this masterpiece of an album. i was totally lost in this song which doesn‚Äôt usually happen to me with music. the vocal and instrumental layers were pure ear candy

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Gorgeous percussion, rich vocals, and captivating production.

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): A very harrowing, unpredictable opener, I love how spacious it is. Nicolas Jaar did well producing this.

**thunderbird\_14** (9.5): In ancient times, there lived a mother and her daughter Pinang in a far remote wonderland. The mother showered her only child with so much affection, one could only wonder if Pinang could knew how spoilt she was. Nevertheless, the mother wanted Pinang to learn about housework, but the latter always reasoned that she already knew what to do. So she was left alone on her own devices. One day, the mother became ill. She couldn't get up and do housework. She ordered Pinang to cook porridge. Pinang intended the porridge but was neglected because she was playing her own game. Thus, the mother proceeded to cook. To the better of her judgment, she left the stove on. Coming back, one could see the burnt rice lining up the ceramic pottery. The mother apologized to herself and her daughter, and proceeded to serve it as burnt rice was better than nothing for her growing child. The mother‚Äôs illness didn‚Äôt waiver in the coming days so Pinang took matters in her own hands to work at home. One day, when she decided to cook, she couldn‚Äôt find the matchbox. She asked her mother where it was. The next day, it was the ladle that was missing. And on and on and on. Her ill mother has to rattle up the headache to tolerate her daughter‚Äôs off-timed inquiries. And it brimmed her with annoyance when everyday, her daughter has to establish a pattern of asking the whereabouts of their possessions without a self-initiative to use one‚Äôs own judgment. She was pushed to the edge by the child's question and said: "Oh my! Pinang, I hope you have lots of eyes so you can see everything and not ask questions.‚Äù Because she knew that her mother was angry, Pinang became silent. She left to look for the missing ladle. Night came, however, Pinang was nowhere to be found. The mother was worried. She calls her daughter but not a single word answered. She forced herself to get up and prepare food for the two. A few days later, the mother recovered from her illness. With a refresh vigour, she resolved to look for Pinang. She asked the neighbors if they saw her daughter. As refreshed her resolve is, the same could be said of the rapid passage of time. And she has to cope as to how her only daughter Pinang faded into nothingness. She never saw her again One day, the mother saw a new plant in her yard. She did not knew what it was but she took good care of it until it bore fruit. Aling Rosa's astonishment can never be fully written in words as she saw the appearance of its fruit. It‚Äôs shapes resembles a human head and is surrounded by eyes. The final words uttered to Pinang boomed in her head, as she finally hear how her daughter should have many eyes to left her in bed sulking. Aling Rosa silently wept, with the pervading silence weighing even further her regrets. She took good care of the plant and called it Pinang. As years pass by, the fruit became popular among the people. The once-named Pinang was endeared Pinya (pineapple).

**almdudler26** (9): more songs should be recorded in cathedrals imo

**wavingwolves** (9): i love how melodically immersive this is, you can feel the threating realization that you're being watched and things are going downhill from here

**Stryxen** (8.9): this is the perfect opening track for the album and it makes me feel a bunch of things‚Ä¶ but it is a BIT too long

**twat\_brained** (8.8): Zeus when he created Argus

**BatesNorman** (8.5): a thousand eyes is a big wide open peripheral vision

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): A haunting start to the album, I first listened to MAGDALENE shortly after I had first listened to Hounds of Love and the chopped vocals on this track reminded me of Kate Bush

**Brendon-Urine** (8): The percussion on this track is really cool. Plays nicely with all the weird vocal harmonies.

**fishingfor8** (8): it sounds like a satanic celtic woman or something like that. It‚Äôs good though and

**leviswift13** (8): don't think she starts off as strong as the other two. i love the medieval witchiness of this, but it is a tad slow and difficult to penetrate. however, really good at what it is doing.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): when it start to get weird about 3 minutes in, that‚Äôs the ticket

**shaniquasharkesha** (8): great as an opener, not very stand-out on its own

**skargardin** (8): this song is so heavy and i love it

**vhqv1997** (8): Adding this to my playlist called "For When You Want To Hex The Patriarchy"

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.8): A thousand eyes would be roughly 500 humans but only 125 spiders

**1998tweety** (7.5): I feel like I would've liked this more if it was half the length. It's fine as an intro but then it drags a bit. The middle bit where she starts shrieking is incredible though.

**InternetDude19** (7.3): An atmospheric opener that sets the tone for the rest of the album.

**fadedblue09** (7): Pretty haunting intro, my only complaint is that it needed more lyrics to make it seem less repetitive.

**koolkatkeeley** (7): I like this song because it‚Äôs a great way to get settled into the album because for a short album it‚Äôs very dense, but it‚Äôs a tad bit repetitive for me and that‚Äôs coming from a Charli XCX stan.

**skaiansightseer** (7): almost mantra-like. almost docked a point because it nearly blew out my car speakers when i tried to play it on cd.

**ThaCoolness** (7): its an ok opener, most of her entire discography is better

**vayyiqra** (7): This is taking me back to the Catholic masses of my youth.

**waluigiest** (7): it‚Äôs gorgeous. It doesn‚Äôt leave much of an impression beyond an introduction, but the chant and the abrasive beats are perfect

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (6.5): It sounds good when I listen to it but it's not personally my taste. I don't skip it in the album but I wouldn't listen to it for fun or on its own or crave listening to it.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): they really just got someone to bang a sheet of metal for that percussion huh

**jlaca123** (6): A little too experimental for my taste, but still pretty.

**Nickl00** (6): love twigs but this is a little too boring for this album

**Yatcho** (6): Never really liked this much as an intro

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5): I like the production and building up and orchestral feelings but wish there was a little more variety to work with lyrically and melodically

**cyborglilith** (4): boring

**vintagebathingsuit** (4): ehhh i've never been able to get into this track. it's a bit too repetitive. wish i could because i love twigs.

**heckwes** (3): bad

**mudkip1** (3): easy skip

This is a good track, but compared to some of the other songs on this album, it doesn‚Äôt stick with me as much. Honestly though, a decent Weyes Blood song is probably just as good as the best tracks of other artists, so...

---

**1998tweety** (10): Beautiful

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): she‚Äôs absolutely right tbh it IS a wild time to be alive

**cremeebrulee** (10): ok finally a song worth saving in my library tbh

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Great lyrics and instrumentation.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): This is another one that really grew on me after multiple listens, largely because I fell asleep during it on my first listen of the album so I didn‚Äôt really pay attention to it. Similarly to A Lot‚Äôs Gonna Change, the lyrics of this one also have been hitting differently in recent months

**Stryxen** (9.5): ‚Äúit‚Äôs a wild time to be alive‚Äù is such a good line let‚Äôs discuss

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): It‚Äôs very pleasing to the ears with its acoustics

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.4): This song really grew on me over the months, and now I think it's absolutely incredible: lush, compelling instrumentation, gorgeous vocals (as usual), and lyrics that suddenly hit even harder. Natalie Mering is brilliant!

**BatesNorman** (9): jennis in my room

**bespectacIed** (9): gorgeous

**hunnybee12** (9): it never stood out to me before but it‚Äôs so pretty and potent today

**jlaca123** (9): Beautiful

**koolkatkeeley** (9): ITS A WILDDDDD NINNNNNNEEEEEE.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): it‚Äôs a wild time to be alive alright

**skaiansightseer** (9): a six minute epic that doesn't even feel long-- filled with musical details and grand song structures but also a joyous energy

**vhqv1997** (9): This song really reminds me of a Mitski track, except Mitski would have stopped the song 2 minutes in lmao

**wavingwolves** (9): "everyone's broken now and no one knows just how we could have all gotten so far from truth" rings even more truthful now

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): the way she warned us about 2020....anyways this was really good, the last minute or so had me transcending

**Yatcho** (8.5): Gorgeous

**bulforster** (8): The lack of a real chorus and the fact it's the longest song on the album means I struggle to have it stick in my mind but I always enjoy it when it's on. Her vocalisations over the instrumental passage are especially nice.

**leviswift13** (8): this feels like a solar system

**plantp0wer** (8): her premonition‚Ä¶ how does this fit perfectly with the pandemic

**waluigiest** (8): the lyrics are excellent I just don‚Äôt feel like the rest of the song is keeping up

**WeastofEden44** (8): This is what I hear as I enter the Secret Garden

**yelling\_tortoise** (7.7): meanders a bit too much but still nice

**ThaCoolness** (7.5): it's not bad but it's my least favorite song on the album. it's a pleasant listen still tho

**Nickl00** (7): not a huge fan of the production, but her voice is still great

**skargardin** (7): The second half of this album, while still good, doesn't really get to the same heights as the first.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): I appreciate the lyrical sentiment, but I find it underwhelming.

**mtachi** (6): I find that this one feels like it goes on forever and although it's pretty I'm just kind of waiting for it to finish.

**twat\_brained** (6): my comments are getting as predictable as this album

**InternetDude19** (5.5): This is the trough of the album in my opinion.

**vayyiqra** (5): I feel next to nothing for this : / I think the second half of this album is all quite mid whereas the first half has highs and lows [REDACTED] Never mind it gets better near the end. I love long multipart songs.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (4.3): Honestly quite pretty, I like the oohs and the instrumentation, once again not memorable

**fishingfor8** (3): it starts with an acoustic guitar and goes into a piano ballad during the chorus and it's 6 minutes long and her voice is so stale sounding. It's the worst combos of everything about her. It has one good melody and that's about it

**CritneySpearz** (1): cured my insomnia!

I like how Weyes Blood decided to end this album on a more stripped down/simple note - I normally find simple acoustic tracks like this sort of lackluster, but this track works. Not surprised to see it out on day 1, though.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Her shortest actual song in the rate, and it slaps.

**bulforster** (10): My favourite on the album and the song that makes me the most emotional in the rate. The album kind of falls off halfway through for me so it's nice to end on such a high note.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): can‚Äôt listen to this and not think about my grandma. i miss you so much...

**hunnybee12** (10): a masterpiece. this fan edit with movie clips is making me tear up like a loser https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtw396V9wgc

**jlaca123** (10): Stunning

**sarcasticsobs** (10): P A I N

**shesdoingyoga** (10): There are very few songs that can make me cry after the first listen, and this is one of them

**Stryxen** (10): I can‚Äôt deal with this I just cannot. This was almost an 11

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): It was going to be my 11. Lyrically, it reminds me of Hard Feelings by Lorde.

**TiltControls** (10): imma just pretend this was the album closer

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): okay i'm a sad hoe i love a guitar ballad

**wavingwolves** (10): absolutely heartbreaking

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.3): This one just breaks my heart...

**bibliosquire** (9): kind of a weird place to put this song but it fits still

**Nickl00** (9): something about her voice feels so warm. Reminds me of lana

**waluigiest** (9): lovely!!! Heartbreaking!!!

**cyborglilith** (8): enchanting

**koolkatkeeley** (8): a great closer to the album.

**leviswift13** (8): weirdly this feels like it could have been on nfr! ??

**skargardin** (8): ugh i love this

**survivorjdmarina** (8): It‚Äôs nice but there‚Äôs nothing really else to say

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): ...i‚Äôm not crying, you are

**BatesNorman** (7): jennis in my room

**skaiansightseer** (7): a bit of a cool down after the high of "Wild Time", but still very well written

**InternetDude19** (6.3): Sometimes it is the simplest of rhymes that have the greatest impact.

**fishingfor8** (6): it's length is a plus but what it gains from being a good length it loses by having the least to say out of all the songs.

**heckwes** (6): forgettable

**fadedblue09** (5.1): The subject matter makes it heartwrenching, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs quite as effective as the other tracks.

**twat\_brained** (5): I'm officially over this album

**bespectacIed** (4): most boring song in the album

**vayyiqra** (4): Sorry I like ballads but this is making me feel listless.

**CritneySpearz** (3): the chorus is beautiful, the rest just didn't click with me..

I must admit that I prefer the piano version that she posted a snippet of before the album was released. However, this version, which features a driving beat that adds a trip hop-esque vibe to the song, still works and I enjoyed this quite a bit.

---

**vintagebathingsuit** (11): this went straight into my top ten favourite songs ever on the first listen. the nostalgic feel, the story in the lyrics, lana's voice...even the production is incredible to me. lana's best song.

**cubascastrodistrict** (10): ugh this song is so amazing. If the greatest didn‚Äôt exist this would get my eleven. The production is nice and pretty, but mostly the lyrics just paint this amazing picture of loss and longing. Every word of it feels so important and moving.

**cyborglilith** (10): epic

**DaHumanTorch** (10): got that christmas time, christmas time sadness

**hunnybee12** (10): somber christmas trap only loners appreciate

**leviswift13** (10): nobody better disrespect her i will cut a bitch if someone comes for miss how to disappear. it's only for bebe rhexars and the bad bitches! no perverts!

**motherstyx** (10): I love the lyrics in this one

**Stryxen** (10): this hits different if you ever just feel like giving up ‚Äì and I have

**1998tweety** (9.5): I love the vocal effects on this song, unfortunately I kinda forget about it next to some of the other songs. Lemme spam it more.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): lana said marry a man and be happy (as long as he's a cop xx)

**yelling\_tortoise** (9.2): underrated song, such a calming arrangement

**chillbumps5** (9): man her voice sounds so much more genuine here than on any of her other albums and the production is amazing, it‚Äôs remarkable.

**fishingfor8** (9): The melodies are surprisingly good and it switches it up enough without straying too far from the album

**jlaca123** (9): :'(

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): Fabulous instrumentation and vocals / lyrics. I love the way it swings, and especially the way she sings "crack another beer" and "things that they hold dear." But How to Disappear Completely?

**Nickl00** (9): the buildup in this song is phenomenal and the lyrics are some of her best

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This was my least favorite song the first time I listened to the album and I have no idea what I was thinking at the time but I was very wrong

**waluigiest** (9): this is waltzy and clean

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): It‚Äôs a bit of a shakeup sound-wise but it‚Äôs got that traditional Lana sound that makes it sound perfect

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (8.4): Love the older feel of this one

**BatesNorman** (8): in the age of late stage capitalism and the trump era in the age of covid you could argue that we have all disappered

**bibliosquire** (8): I feel like this song is like the title, it disappears in the other songs, but it‚Äôs still good!

**koolkatkeeley** (8): this song just makes me want to walk around my neighborhood and cry.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): I'm so sad that the Piano version of this song that she played at the Apple event isn't the one on the album, this instrumental just doesn't do it for me.

**skargardin** (8): Cute moment

**twat\_brained** (7.2): anyone else hear xanny by Billie with some added percussion?

**skaiansightseer** (7): feels like a remastered born to die/ultraviolence track

**wavingwolves** (7): idk i wish this was more about the methods of disappearing since i'm interested in that

**sarcasticsobs** (6.5): eh

**wanderingimpromptu3** (6.3): Lyrics surpass the melody

**fadedblue09** (5.5): I don‚Äôt get how the word ‚Äòdisappear‚Äô fits into the song but werk sis.

**thatgreekguyraul** (4): Nothing interests me and stands out from the lyrics.

**vayyiqra** (4): I'm not here / This isn't happening / I'm not here / I'm not here Not as good as that song, unfortunately. I think at this point, the album begins to waver for me.

**bespectacIed** (1): me 10 seconds into this boring ass song

Along with Bartender, this was one of the biggest growers for me on Lana‚Äôs album. The sparse arrangement complements Lana perfectly, and that chorus is perfect. I also enjoy the soft rock influences in the song, and if you reference Joni Mitchell in your song indirectly or directly, you immediately win me over. This isn‚Äôt a song that would do well in any rate, but I‚Äôm happy that it made it to 22nd.

---

**DSporachd** (11): the song that grows on the most people after a few listens the emotional build is incredible and it's one of the most relatable songs Lana has written

**altiondsols** (10): my third favorite song on the rate has a weirdly similar theme to my second-favorite song on the rate, home with you - both about wishing you could help a friend through a tough time

**bibliosquire** (10): my personal favorite on this album

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this sounds like an ultraviolence track ugh‚Ä¶also i love all the references to earlier songs in these lyrics, such as shades of cool and carmen

**gannade** (10): ended toxic masculinity PERIODT.

**jlaca123** (10): That chorus

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): One of the three towering peaks of NFR!, I absolutely love this and the second verse onward just kills me. When her voice goes down ("I've heard the war was over if you really choose") is one of the best parts of the album. My first time hearing this confirmed NFR! as an AOTY frontrunner, and perhaps the pinnacle (for now?) of an impressive career

**Nickl00** (10): this song just builds and builds and feels like it never stops and it amazing all the way through

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): petition to make this the new state anthem

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This was my favorite song the first time I listened to the album. I don‚Äôt currently have a single favorite but the emotion that she conveys in this one still resonates deeply for me

**survivorjdmarina** (10): A slow burner that sounds magnifique

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): wow this song never fails to give me chills. everything about it is just so emotional and beautiful and completely lana.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): the verses and pre-chorus of this song I adore. But the chorus itself is just doesn't match that. It just feels like this monotone, boring mess that feels weirdly remniscent of a lot of the choruses from L4L that i didn't like

**BatesNorman** (9): why is every song about california where are the idaho bops?

**heckwes** (9): if you come back to californiaiaia

**skargardin** (9): One of my early favorites and it still holds up wonderfully

**ThaCoolness** (9): wow this song is better than i remembered, her vocals are incredible

**1998tweety** (8.5): I wish I liked this a bit more, it's on the cusp of being an incredible song to me but the chorus throws it off. Her vocals are a bit meh too, but besides that, it's another great track.

**bespectacIed** (8): gorgeous

**fishingfor8** (8): The subject matter I think is my favorite part of the song, her whisper singing though is off on this one.

**leviswift13** (8): drags a bit for me, but it's still so great

**vhqv1997** (8): The Blackest Day wants its double chorus back

**waluigiest** (8): I hate that this hits so much

**twat\_brained** (7.6): I'd love to revisit California but I have Trump-voting family there so errr... lemme pass

**cremeebrulee** (7): i know everyone likes this song but it still hasn't grown on me

**koolkatkeeley** (7): I loved this song at first, but it hasn‚Äôt stayed with me.

**skaiansightseer** (7): i get this confused with "cinnamon girl"

**Stryxen** (7): grimes wishes

**vayyiqra** (7): Is there any place on Earth that's more "Lana" than California? Other than Coney Island, I mean. This is a great piece of Americana and the best song on the second half of the album.

**wavingwolves** (7): listening to lana you would think that the only place that exists on earth is california

**Awkward\_King** (6): this used to be my least favourite by a mile and idrk why i think i just got it into my head that it was, but i love the lyrics sm

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5.5): Pretty and sweet

**cloudbustingmp3** (5.3): never thought I‚Äôd be able to say this but Grimes outsold

**chillbumps5** (5): another song that reminds me of her older stuff where her voice gets really shrill and piercing in a bad way and the way she says the ‚ÄúAAAAHH‚Äù or ‚ÄúUHHHH‚Äù vowel sound is awful.

**kappyko** (5): KISS ME HARD BEFORE YOU GO

**fadedblue09** (4.5): She sounds like she‚Äôs groaning the chorus. Also why does this album have so many 5 minute songs??

**bulforster** (4): Lana's delivery over this instrumental really drags for me.

**thatgreekguyraul** (2): Nothing memorable about this track. It feels like filler. The lyrical theme feel very repetitive.

This might be the most surprising placement of any song in the rate for me. I loved this cover from the first time I listened to it and I thought it was a fan favorite, but I guess I must be living in my own world‚Ä¶ I love how Lana seamlessly turned a random Sublime song into an atmospheric trip hop song that could be played endlessly throughout the summer. It‚Äôs a faithful cover so it‚Äôs even more remarkable to see her give this song new life. Also, that video‚Ä¶

---

**bespectacIed** (10): Excellent. For all I care, this is an original lana song

**bibliosquire** (10): better than the original

**DaHumanTorch** (10): sublime who? also love how she left in the original pronouns cough cough @ michael buble

**leviswift13** (10): sublime who?

**skargardin** (10): Somehow while this is an outlier on the album it still weirdly fits between Fuck it i love you and Love Song?

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Lana is absolutely not qualified to represent the LBC but this is a good cover nonetheless

**twat\_brained** (10): laid ease, THIS is how you do a 90s cover. Take NOTES.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): a cute cover

**waluigiest** (9): comparing the creativity and thematic thread of this cover to her previous albums‚Äô covers.... she‚Äôs ascending

**WeastofEden44** (9): I prefer this to the original tbh

**wanderingimpromptu3** (8.7): Infectious to listen to but the lyrics aren't up to par. It doesn't really fit in with the rest of the album

**1998tweety** (8.5): Massive bop, she outsold the original easily lol

**BatesNorman** (8.5): what if lana is the girl who treats her man like shit and the man is the cop she was dating that would make that whole thing kinda cool

**Stryxen** (8.5): I‚Äôve come to tell you it‚Äôs a good song, most definitely

**jlaca123** (8.4): Great cover, but kind of pales in comparison to the rest of the album.

**CarlieScion** (8): for some reason i always think lana sounds like miley on this track

**fadedblue09** (8): I‚Äôm not sure why this is here but I guess it‚Äôs a welcome change of pace for the sound.

**fishingfor8** (8): It's a good cover it just really doesn't fit the mood of the album at all

**Nickl00** (8): her best cover by far and one of her grooviest songs ever

**RandomHypnotica** (8): It's a nice enough cover, but it doesn't really do much for me

**realboxwood** (8): V catchy, but listening to it with a closer ear than I usually do makes it apparent how much it's being carried by the production

**vayyiqra** (8): I liked the Sublime version of this song when I was 14, a long time ago. I did not ever expect Lana to do a cover of it, nor do I think the album needs it, but it's my jam anyway.

**vintagebathingsuit** (8): "on lockdown like a penitentiary" quarantine icon.

**wavingwolves** (8): i love how covers become something completely new when lana does it. she makes the song fully hers and this is no exception

**plastichaxan** (7.5): i couldn't get into it as much as other people did but i really like it

**PointlessBibliophage** (7.5): it's good but why is it on the album though

**koolkatkeeley** (7): this song has grown on me a lot.

**shesdoingyoga** (7): I think I would have preferred if this was just a standalone single, it sounds a little out of place on the album and that detracts from it for me

**survivorjdmarina** (7): Kinda shocked this placed on the BBH100 over any other track, but I‚Äôm also not surprised since this is the most commercial-sounding song on the album lol

**freav** (6.5): A Sublime cover????? Skaheads keep on winning

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (6.2): I do think it's a good cover but I don't think her delivery of the lines is as believable. I can't help but compare it to the original unfortunately.

**InternetDude19** (6): I don't like Sublime.

**sarcasticsobs** (6): actually getting me to push through a sublime song, who woulda thought?

**thatgreekguyraul** (6): Decent cover but that is it.

**chillbumps5** (5.5): the Sublime version is (and i cannot stress this enough) ICONIC and far superior, this one sounds like it‚Äôs made for a make-up commercial and it doesn‚Äôt fit the album.

**LazyDayLullaby** (5): The worst song on the best album of 2019

**skaiansightseer** (5): yeah it's lana del rey covering sublime. definitely is that

This was probably the first non-single that I ended up loving from the album. It‚Äôs a simple track in terms of vocals and arrangements, but it just *works* for some reason. A large part of that probably has to do with her evocative lyrics, although there are a few songs on this album that do that better, in my opinion. In the end, simplicity might be this song‚Äôs greatest strength.

---

**Brendon-Urine** (11): I can't get over the strings that open this song. So delicate and beautiful. The fact that this is on a Lana record is just incredible. Also love the lyrics so much - "the taste the touch the way we love it all comes down to make the sound of our love song" god so good.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (11): This is the perfect love song that is both bittersweet and somehow still extremely passionate and romantic I want to fall in love to this song

**1998tweety** (10): So pretty I'm gonna cry :(

**bulforster** (10): This is really pretty, I can see how this convinced her to work with Jack.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this made me fall hopelessly in love with someone who doesn‚Äôt even exist sob

**jlaca123** (10): Stunning. Gorgeous. :'(

**leviswift13** (10): makes me think of winter nights spent walking around my college campus with my boyfriend. the quiet need and breathy desire is so aching and beautiful i can't

**RandomHypnotica** (10): A sweet, almost innocent love song from Lana was not something I ever expected but it really works. It's just pretty.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): i am in pain

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I feel like people don‚Äôt like this one because it sounds ‚Äúbasic‚Äù or something but it‚Äôs just so gorgeous I can‚Äôt rate it any lower

**skargardin** (10): She really did that

**waluigiest** (10): she‚Äôs essentially writing a parody of herself and it‚Äôs somehow stunning and honest

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): be my once in a lifetime

**wavingwolves** (9.5): feeling resentment towards this song for making me feel like a lonely loser

**bibliosquire** (9): it‚Äôs such a sweet song

**Nickl00** (9): one of the only songs I‚Äôve ever cried too, I can‚Äôt relate but still

**Stryxen** (9): I Love this song

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.6): Delicate and lovely

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): It‚Äôs cute, it‚Äôs sad, but sexy

**koolkatkeeley** (8): more like I love this song.

**skaiansightseer** (8): one of her stronger love ballads

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (7.5): I like the gentleness of this one

**fishingfor8** (7): I think I tend to underrate just because it's after such a long string of some of my favorite songs of last year

**WeastofEden44** (7): very good but not necessarily one of my favs

**Yatcho** (7): This one kinda slows down the album a bit too much for my liking, usually a skip

**BatesNorman** (6.5): <3

**plastichaxan** (6.5): is this related to personal experiences? maybe

**thatgreekguyraul** (6): The lyrics are decent but Lana fails to truly paint a better picture of the story she starts to describe at the beginning.

**twat\_brained** (6): Sara Bareilles remains untouched and outselling.

**vayyiqra** (6): Pretty :uwu:

**vintagebathingsuit** (6): basic but beautiful.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (5): Nice concept, pleasant but not memorable

**realboxwood** (4): It feels like every element of this song is done in a vastly more interesting way somewhere else on the album

**bespectacIed** (1): i'm not even being mean this is just so damn boring

**fadedblue09** (0): Somehow this lyrically trite song managed to be more forgettable than the Weyes Blood interludes. That is...quite the feat, I guess. (I actually thought I skipped this track on both listens).

Part of me wishes that this made it to day 2, but it made it into the top 5 of this album, so I think that is just as good for me. I‚Äôm a huge fan of baroque pop and this song executes that sound very well. It doesn‚Äôt reach the heights that some of the other songs on this album reach, but it is still a gorgeous track that would fit in perfectly on a 70s radio station.

---

**almdudler26** (11): i want something to believe üòî

**samf79** (11): this is the song I relate to completely. It was kind of just random chance I decided to listen to this particular song first but it is the one that has stuck with me for the longest. Every lyric is true, completely raw, unfiltered, and it's like she reads pages out of a journal. I have never heard someone articulate their feelings so clearly and to convey what I feel as well through song. Perfect song. There are too many fantastic lyrics to pick out, but one of my favorites: "Instead of dropping the ball, I seem to carry so many."

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (10): The first 4 songs of this album are perfect listening.

**bibliosquire** (10): it‚Äôs hard for me to put into words how this song makes me feel

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i also lay down and cry

**fadedblue09** (10): I find this a bit relatable, as someone who occasionally gets philosophical at times lol. Also, I love the production a lot, it‚Äôs like some futuristic country song or something.

**freav** (10): What a goegeous song, I feel like it gets less attention than the rest of the first half, but it makes me want to drink a lot of coffee and then cry.

**skaiansightseer** (10): those guitars!!! gorgeous

**skargardin** (10): This song hits and it hits HARD

**Stryxen** (10): this might be the perfect song‚Ä¶ crazy

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Excellent lyrics. Very vivid. My favourite type of songwriting.

**wavingwolves** (10): listening to this song while in the middle of a pandemic and one of the biggest eras of political and economical crisis is really something. it makes me tremble because of how well represented my feelings and my mental state is by it, especially the chorus

**minibjork** (9.5): I JUST LAY DOWN AND CRYYYYYYYY

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.2): I, too, drank a lot of coffee today

**1998tweety** (9): I really like how this song actually builds up to the chorus and it delivers.

**bespectacIed** (9): beautiful

**koolkatkeeley** (9): this song is so full of hope and hopelessness at the same time. Weyes blood more like WOWs Blood.

**survivorjdmarina** (9): It‚Äôs really lush and ethereal

**jlaca123** (8.7): Epic

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Lyrically this is the most relatable song on the album for me

**heckwes** (8): eeee Eeee EEEeee EEEEEEEVEE

**leviswift13** (8): a slight dip for me, but still super strong. the melodic structure of the chorus is sublime.

**Nickl00** (8): this album is so goddamn beautiful

**waluigiest** (8): I‚Äôm living for the way this swells and how her voice is utilized so well

**WeastofEden44** (8): Her voice sounds gorgeous here, so subtly rich and smooth

**twat\_brained** (7.5): I'm starting to remember why I shouldn't take Pitchfork ratings as gospel

**BatesNorman** (7): believing in things is corny

**vintagebathingsuit** (7): wow the way it builds at the end brought this up a point.

**sandyfishnets** (6): there's so much going on in this song. wish it was a lot calmer like the two verses where it's just her voice and the piano, would have made it more effective for me.

**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): another song i tried to like on this album but just ended up snoozing to...i loved it lyrically though

**fishingfor8** (5): It's way too long. I would like this album a lot more but each song averages out at like 4 minutes and 30 seconds and it just doesn't go anywhere a lot of the time. Cut this song down a minute and a half and it's an 8 minimum

**vayyiqra** (5): Extremely mid.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (4.3): Lyrics are pretty but the sound is so limppp

At many points throughout the rate, this was making it to day 2, so it bummed me out to see it ultimately end up as the last track out on day 1. When I saw that she released a piano ballad as a single, I was thrown off, but I instantly fell in love after listening to the first verse. Just the lyric ‚ÄúI was reading Slim Aarons‚Äù is supremely evocative and instantly sends me to a different place in time, but lyrics such as ‚Äú24/7 Sylvia Plath‚Äù also set up perfect images of what Lana is saying in this song. I sometimes roll my eyes when artists decide to make the final track on an album a ballad, but this song is the perfect closer to NFR.

---

**TiltControls** (11): Fantastic way to end the album. Everything about the track works so well. I'm still not 100% sure I understand some of the lyrics but they all work together with the tone of the song.

**bibliosquire** (10): makes me wanna go crazy

**CopyCatJ** (10): Sylvia Plath main pop girl

**DaHumanTorch** (10): whats longer: the song itself or reading the title?

**fadedblue09** (10): Hmm...the bookends of this album are its best songs? I never would‚Äôve guessed that. Anyway, the lyrics on here are top-notch and mostly free of issues imo.

**leviswift13** (10): hope is a dangerous thing for a twink like me to have - but I have it

**skaiansightseer** (10): i listened to this so much winter 2019 while wandering my house in a bathroom it fucking rules

**skargardin** (10): An all around fantastic closer

**ThaCoolness** (10): what a fucking closer. this is one of the best examples of just how good lana's lyricism is throughout this album. melodies are on point too

**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): Beautiful melody, overall beautiful lyrics with just a few off kilter ones

**WeastofEden44** (10): Her best song. Periodt. All I have to say

**BatesNorman** (9.5): i would never have hope

**fishingfor8** (9.5): I'm suprised i stuck to my scores when rating this album cause i ended up finalizing the scores the day that Lana had that big instagram rant that went viral.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): "Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad"

**Stryxen** (9.5): this was an incredible song for a man like me to hear ‚Äì and I heard it

**jlaca123** (9.1): Quite the closer

**heckwes** (9): simple and the best!

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): Excellent closer; "24/7 Sylvia Plath" is such an evocative and memorable line. She makes a really lengthy song name work

**Nickl00** (9): it‚Äôs incredibly sad and I really like that about it

**realboxwood** (9): Recent events have really changed the implications of that title line huh

**Yatcho** (8.7): I really appreciate the raw emotion of this song, but its just not one I can listen to very often

**twat\_brained** (8.6): what impresses me is how long it is yet it feels like an incredibly fulfilling use of runtime

**1998tweety** (8.5): A good closer to the album. I like that it kinda ends on a positive note. Some of the lines are a bit choppy though so I can't score this any higher, even though the long outro is amazing.

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): Not my favourite when it was released, but it resonates with me a lot now

**koolkatkeeley** (8): some of Lana‚Äôs finest songwriting, but god that title.

**shesdoingyoga** (8): As much as I wish that Happiness is a butterfly was the last song, this one does work as a sort of soft resolution to the rest of the album

**waluigiest** (8): some questionable choices here (iPad? Sylvia Plath????) but it‚Äôs comes together as a very compelling end to a very compelling album

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): the lyrics are uh, interesting, but ‚Äúhello, it‚Äôs the most famous woman you know on the iPad‚Äù is HILARIOUS

**Brendon-Urine** (7): I love this song when I first heard it but it's worn on me just a little bit. still a great song and fitting for the closer.

**CarlieScion** (6): what an obnoxious title i say as i stream i like it when you sleep for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it

**thatgreekguyraul** (6): This song has some great lyrics but the iPad line ruins it for me.

**motherstyx** (5): I love the memes but not the song

**vhqv1997** (5): This big-ass sentence is a stupid title for a song to have - but it has it

**wavingwolves** (5): hope? in this economy? no ma'am! not here

**vayyiqra** (4): It's weird. I don't really like this song, it's too slow and makes me feel sleepy, but the album wouldn't feel right without it at the end.

**chillbumps5** (3): i had this at a seven when i first listened to it, then went back and listened again and came to my senses: there‚Äôs just nothing here. It‚Äôs a nothing song about nothing that‚Äôs sung pretty and happens to have a stupidly long title but is ultimately just bad poetry (ironic) over piano.

**plantp0wer** (3): much like the title, the song is too long

**bespectacIed** (2): "black narcissist" another beyonc√© diss smh (jk). This is so boring though :(

**sawayamas** (0): a snooze sorry
