[RATE] The Frenchpop Rate: Chaleur Humaine vs Complètement Fou vs Racine Carrée
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5rfro6/rate_the_frenchpop_rate_chaleur_humaine_vs/

Welcome to one of our two February rates: the  ***Frenchpop Rate***! Yes, yes, it's one of the more niche rates that this sub has hosted, but I hope that the language barrier doesn't put you off: these artists have seen *international* success off of the strength of their pop songs. The three albums that we'll be rating are:

* **Christine and the Queens -** ***Chaleur Humaine*** (2014)
* **Yelle -** ***Complètement Fou*** (2014)
* **Stromae -** ***Racine Carrée*** (2013)

For this rate, you are encouraged to read translations of lyrics if possible. It's obviously not required at all, but all three albums have great lyricism that's worth taking into account.

#Christine and the Queens - *Chaleur Humaine*

*Chaleur Humaine* was released in 2014 to stellar reviews. The debut of Héloïse Letissier was glorious self-written synthpop, influenced equal parts by the indie acts of today and the legends of old: Michael Jackson, Madonna. Her stage name, Christine and the Queens, comes from her history in London. Despite being a native of Nantes, France, she quickly found respite in the drag queen scene of London, the eponymous 'Queens'. She's earned a reputation as a mainstream star both in her native France, in Belgium, and in the UK (the album peaking at #3, #1 and #2 on their respective country charts), on account of her offbeat but irresistible stage presence, and on the strength of songs such as the wildly successful 'Christine'. Her lyrics deal with awkwardness, on non-conformity, on identity and anxiety. Her lyrics are simultaneously an exaggerated caricature (that of her Christine persona), and deeply autobiographical. Héloïse Letissier frequently muses on herself as a modern queer woman.

In 2016, *Chaleur Humaine* was re-released as the self-titled *Christine and the Queens*. For the most part, the same as the original 2014 edition, but with some of the pre-existing songs re-recorded with English instead of French, and a few additional English songs added geared towards her newfound international fanbase. For this rate, to put it on even footing with the other two fully French albums, we'll be rating the original 2014 edition (although, feel free to listen to the English version if it's more convenient as the songs are fundamentally the same).

#Yelle - Complètement Fou

Electropop band Yelle (a trio, although now a duo) function on bold, bright electropop. Initially riding the MySpace wave back in the mid 00s, and then exploding with hits such as 'Je Veux Te Voir', a buzzing slice of aplomb (think The Ting Tings but with more saw synths), at some point, Yelle opened for Katy Perry on her 2011 California Dreams Tour. The band have undeniable popularity abroad too: they're one of the very few French acts to have played Coachella three times already.

As thanks perhaps for Katy Perry noticing them, Yelle remixed Perry's 'Hot 'n' Cold'. This caught the attention of Dr. Luke (talented producer but overall sleazebag), who became a collaborator for their 2014 album, *Complètement Fou*. Don't let Dr. Luke put you off the album, please, even if he is a dodgy piece of work. Dr. Luke lends his shimmering pop gleam to the band's electro leanings. His touch never really overwhelms the quirky personality of the band however: "It still sounds like Yelle," says frontwoman Julie Budet. And indeed, *Complètement Fou* is a good album to listen to for those who want to know what the band is about. Their music is dancey and fun, and their lyrics witty and provocative.

#Stromae - Racine Carrée

Belgian pop star, Stromae, has gone from humble beginnings to truly being one of Europe's most impressive exports, grabbing the attention of the likes of will.i.am. and Lorde (the latter of whom invited him to contribute to her star-studded soundtrack that she curated for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1). It's not hard to see why, of course - his brand of worldly rhythms (informed by his half-Rwandan background), hip-hop and pop blend into the perfect mix of both melancholy and deeply catchy tunecrafting. 

*Racine Carrée*, or 'Square root', is united by its unending dark but whimsical energy, and covers a huge variety of lyrical subjects, from cancer (on phonetic pun 'quand c'est?') or the issues of fatherhood (on hugely successful 'Papaoutai'). It's dramatic stuff, but it's natural, a product of French romanticism, theatre and melodrama, where the classics of times past like Édith Piaf understood the power of a musical vision beyond the mundane of everyday life. Stromae bites with humour and wit that you get the gist of even if you can't understand French.

##**RULES**

**Reading these is *vital*. These include instructions for how to submit your scores correctly.**

(If you participated in the January rate that /u/letsallpoo hosted, these rules are quoted ad verbatim.)

* Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine, but **please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two demical spots**: giving a 7.2 is okay, but giving a 7.25 will give me a headache. This is because I'm using a computer program to parse the votes and print everything out (more on that later).
* Yes, you have to listen to every song. I will not accept your ballot if you have a score missing. That's because it will crash the program (more on that later).
* Your scores should NOT be considered confidential.
* You may give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. This is ONE song total, **NOT ONE SONG PER ALBUM**. Please reserve these for your least favourite and most favourite tracks; excessive sabotage ruins rate results.
* You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again afterwards.
* I am using a computer program that I designed in order to parse these votes! You can see it [here](https://github.com/jnlu/popheads/blob/master/popheads.py). While this will make things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on my part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. **The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to use the pre-prepared link at the bottom of this post. PLEASE USE THAT.** You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores.
* If you don't follow the format, I'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions.
* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!


This is correct:

> Perfect Illusion: 1 Qu'est ce que c'est que cette bêtise?

These are INCORRECT:

> Perfect Illusion: 1: Qu'est ce que c'est que cette bêtise?

> Perfect Illusion: Qu'est ce que c'est que cette bêtise? 1

> Perfect Illusion: Nul points!

> Perfect Illusion: 1-Qu'est ce que c'est que cette bêtise?

> Perfect Illusion: 1 (Qu'est ce que c'est que cette bêtise?)

> Perfect Illusion: 1 - Qu'est ce que c'est que cette bêtise?
