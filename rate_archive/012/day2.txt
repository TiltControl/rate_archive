The Frenchpop Rate, Day 2: The winner is...
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5xp2r4/the_frenchpop_rate_day_2_the_winner_is/

Hello my friends. The second and final day of the rate is here. I am not letsallpoo and I *certainly* did not steal this OP from him. Some notes:


* Follow along in the plug.dj! The link is [here](https://plug.dj/popheads/) if you've never been there. I'll be revealing songs there shortly before I post them here.

* I will start revealing songs at around 17:00 EST. I'm going from #20-#1 today.

* I've included nearly everyone's comments. I apologise for the relative lack of writeups, but I accidentally got a job between agreeing to host the rate and actually doing the rate.

* Controversy is a measure of how much voters disagreed. Think of it as an average of the differences between all of the scores. The average controversy was a 2.2, so anything above a 2.4 should be considered controversial.

* The average overall score was 7.6.

* I'll also be revealing the total points each song got. This is just a sum of everyone's scores (so it's equal to the average multiplied by the number of participants). I think this will be a good way of seeing how close some of these songs were.

* I'll also be revealing everyone's scores for every song, so none of you are safe from being exposed hihi.

That's it. Good luck to all of you.

**Hoplitejoeisdumb**: "Very Justice sounding"

**Reifiui**: "I didn't know the beat to Meltdown was sampled from this, it's also kinda sad that I give my 11 to an instrumental track in an album that's so strong lyrically but it's just too good"

**seferre2**: "i enjoy the experimentation but.... not a banger"

**eribertknows**: "This is apparently the instrumental of a Lorde, Pusha T, Haim and Q-Tip song, but that‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre rating. I feel like it‚Äôs kind of a bad decision to follow up the masterpiece that is Sommeil with an instrumental, but maybe there‚Äôs a purpose for that. Good instrumental though."

**therokinrolla**: "Yea the beats are good but the lack of vocals really puts me off"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "You could easily say I gave this song a 10 for the memes. But honestly, the entire instrumentation is god-tier."

**femaleghostbuster**: "Intense! I love it. I also love the remix he did for the Hunger Games soundtrack. (Lorde‚Äôs on it!)"

**Kaphox**: "king of instrumentals"

**therokinrolla**: "this song is so strange and interesting wtf is he saying tho??"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Oh yess Stromae, go off!"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "the intro always reminds me of that Car Wash song but this is such a powerful song lyrically. king of being a global citizen and rejecting categorization!"

**Banananaise**: "'feminist or the farm' me too"

**dirdbub**: "I'd just like to point out one of the lines is 'Sois t'es macho, soit homo [Either you're macho or homo] // Mais t'es phobe ou sexuel [But you're -phobe or -sexual]' and honestly I think that's really great"

**MrSwearword**: "this is deep as fuck. As the kids would say, Stromae did THAT."

**therokinrolla**: "a pretty decent finale if you ask me"

**Kaphox**: "super underrated! beautiful song"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "i loooove that start-stop vibe in the production so so much, and 'ce n'est pas la batterie que j'entends c'est mon pouls' is such a good line. also tbh this song has one of my favorite lyric videos ever"

**bluehxrizon**: "production is great and its so groovy, im bopping"

**ffourthofjuly**: "the only reason im giving this song such a high score is because doc stans for it so hard"

**seferre2**: "nice production but it can get a little too much towards the end and it sounds a little silly even in french and a lot like a kidz bop song. i expected a climax orgasm after that long buildup but ended up dissapointed"

**eribertknows**: "Okay so I don‚Äôt like her voice very much which will probably be a problem."

**therokinrolla**: "YESS YELLE SNATCH MY WIGGGG such a bop. A bop is a bop no matter the language and this song is a BOP"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Whatever opinion you have on Dr. Luke, it's totally crazy he can deliver a total bop even though it's not in English. It's too bad Dr. Luke is a piece of shit."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "invented fun and music tbh! sets the perfect tone for the album and probably my favorite Yelle chorus ever! it's just one of those songs that never fails to lift my spirits and put me in a good mood! also what an amazing video!!! the corn drill is legendary"

**Banananaise**: "EN-VIE DE SAU-TER DANS TES MAINS (sung while riding giant plastic corn cob)"

**dirdbub**: "iconic in every sense"

**MrSwearword**: "One of the best album openers ever."

VioletChutzkee: A perfect pop song, but Papaoutai really is on another level. Also I used to think that she was saying "ah-oooo" (as in howling like a wolf) in the chorus but then I found out that she's actually saying "avou", I was mildly disappointed.

**ExtraEater**: "the message behind the lyrics, i ofc have to give a shoutout"

**ffourthofjuly**: "this track makes me cry, you can hear the pain and desire in stromae's voice. there's that part where you can hear him virtually spitting in your eyes"

**seferre2**: "i love the passion in his voice this is a great song"

**eribertknows**: "Talk about depressing songs with an upbeat sound. This is straight up a masterpiece and it makes me mad emotional even though I can‚Äôt personally relate."

**therokinrolla**: "Gosh how fierce"

**letsallpoo**: "I COULD WRITE SO MUCH DISCOURSE ABOUT THE GENIUS BEHIND THIS SONG (THE BACKSTORY, THE WAY THE VERSES TURN FROM CONFUSED TO ANGRY, THE AMAZING MUSIC VIDEO, THE PUN IN THE TITLE) BUT NONE OF THAT EVEN MATTERS BECAUSE THIS IS ALSO A HUGE FUCKING BOP OOH TAY PAH PAH OOH TAY OOH TAY PAH PAH OOH TAY OOH TAY PAH PAH OOH TAY OOH TAY OOH TAY OOH PAH PAH OOH TAY"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Looking up the translation of this song which is about his relationship with his father really hits home for me. My father didn't die in some genocide like Stromae's but I think this song perfectly emulates my relationship with my dad. We are just too different and I felt so distant from him."

**femaleghostbuster**: "I‚Äôm a sucker for catchy songs with depressing lyrics, and this is one of the best. This was the first Stromae song I ever heard, so maybe I‚Äôm biased, but my god it‚Äôs perfect. This is what pop music is supposed to be."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "sad bop! my favorite kind!"

**dirdbub**: "holy SHIT, this song. even before looking up the translation of this song, I knew this song would stay with me for a long time. but after looking it up, it really hits me to the core and puts it on level of Hey Ya for me. for those who don't know, the song is, quite literally, translated to 'Dad, Where Are You?' as it a malapropism of Papa o√π t'es, which is of the same meaning. Stromae (AKA Paul Van Haver) reveals through the song that he doesn't have a relationship with his father, which also shown through the music video as the kid who plays a younger version of him doesn't have an active father like the other families but rather a mannequin-like father figure. after releasing the song, he also revealed that his father was missing due to him being a victim of the Rwandan Genocide in 1994. this song has a really fucking sad meaning behind it, but reading the English translation of lines really fucks you up even more. and it becomes even more interesting and saddening when you realize while reading the lyrics that it is being told from both the perspective of the child and the father. lines like 'Ah sacr√© papa [Oh damn dad] // Dis-moi o√π es-tu cach√©? [Tell me where you're hiding?] // √áa doit, faire au moins mille fois que j'ai [I must've counted my fingers] // Compt√© mes doigts [At least a thousand times]' reveal the child's struggle with having an absentee figure in his life, but lines like 'Tout le monde sait comment on fait les b√©b√©s [Everyone knows how to make babies] // Mais personne sait comment on fait des papas [But no one knows how to make dads]' reveal the father's internal struggle with not being ready to be a parent and learning how to do so as time comes along, making him a not-so-decent father figure. reading this really puts the song on the level of Hey Ya for me as it is such a great pop song that doesn't sound sad at all when you first listen to it but later, when you dig deeper into it, reveals a sad truth that we are far from willing to discuss otherwise. banger song"

**MrSwearword**: "The translated lyrics fucked me up. This on top of the video just makes this one of the most twisted songs to ever get a catchy beat. I love it."
