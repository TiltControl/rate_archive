2017 EP Rate 2.0 A.K.A. I'm a flop
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/8gitdq/2017_ep_rate_20_aka_im_a_flop/

[Hello gay people](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/logosrupaulsdragrace/images/c/c5/YuhuaS10.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180223052431)! It's me, your friendly pophead with *that* Sia flair. This month's rate, hosted by yours truly, is going to be an iconic clash of our favorite C level musicians, whose amazing EP's kept us on our toes in the previous year. From amazing nostalgic hits and songs about psychopaths to futuristic R&B pop and re-appearing pop stars, you'll find everything in this rate. Although some of these artists appeared in some rates(and got robbed), this is their first time as standalone artists with bodies of work going head to head against each other. Who will snatch the #1 trophy? Is it going to be gastroenteritis? Or Cyber Stockholm Syndrome? Will Maggie Rogers surprise everyone and actually survive to day 2? Will Julia Michaels have 5 or 6 songs out before the top 30? It's all up to you, people. Send in your scores at [this pre-prepared link](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=amumumyspiritanimal&subject=The%202017%20EP%20rate&message=Username%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Ten%20Years%0A%0ATake%20Me%3A%0A%0AI%20Know%3A%0A%0APromises%3A%0A%0AThe%20Distance%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20don%27t%20smile%20at%20me%0A%0ACOPYCAT%3A%0A%0Aidontwannabeyouanymore%3A%0A%0Amy%20boy%3A%0A%0Awatch%3A%0A%0Aparty%20favor%3A%0A%0Abellyache%3A%0A%0Aocean%20eyes%3A%0A%0Ahostage%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Nervous%20System%0A%0AIssues%3A%0A%0AUh%20Huh%3A%0A%0AWorst%20In%20Me%3A%0A%0AMake%20It%20Up%20To%20You%3A%0A%0AJust%20Do%20It%3A%0A%0APink%3A%0A%0ADon%27t%20Wanna%20Think%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Now%20The%20Light%20Is%20Fading%0A%0AColor%20Song%3A%0A%0AAlaska%3A%0A%0AOn%20+%20Off%3A%0A%0ADog%20Years%3A%0A%0ABetter%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20When%20I%20Was%20Young%0A%0ARoots%3A%0A%0AWhen%20I%20Was%20Young%3A%0A%0ATurn%20My%20Heart%20To%20Stone%3A%0A%0ALinking%20With%20You%3A%0A%0ABb%3A%0A%0ARun%20Away%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20RE/BL%0A%0AHeart%20Full%20Of%20Scars%3A%0A%0AFoolish%3A%0A%0AWasted%20Youth%3A%0A%0ASatellite%3A%0A%0AThe%20Great%20Divide%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20RINA%0A%0AOrdinary%20Superstar%3A%0A%0ATake%20Me%20As%20I%20Am%3A%0A%0A10-20-40%3A%0A%0ATunnel%20Vision%3A%0A%0ATime%20Out%3A%0A%0AAlterlife%3A%0A%0AThrough%20The%20Wire%3A%0A%0ACyber%20Stockholm%20Syndrome%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Don%27t%20Kill%20My%20Vibe%0A%0ADon%27t%20Kill%20My%20Vibe%3A%0A%0APlot%20Twist%3A%0A%0AFake%20Friends%3A%0A%0ADynamite%3A%0A%0AEND) to decide their fate. Now, let's meet our contestants:

#[Aly & AJ - Ten Years](https://i.imgur.com/coG7Lo7.jpg)

After 4 years of hiatus(don't try to pretend Hothouse didn't exist at all it deserves better), Aly & AJ, our favorite sister band after HAIM, has returned, serving nothing but bops! I mean, at least I think so. The band consists of sisters [Aly Michalka](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dY11E-R4qbI/hqdefault.jpg) and [AJ Michalka](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/c/c3/Stevonnie_with_Sword_and_Shield_by_Lenhi.png/revision/latest?cb=20160803234314). You might know the duo from when they exploded into the mainstream for a brief second with their top 20 hit song, [Potential Breakup Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5QAqx1ORx4), released back in 2007. Since then, a lot has changed, and they switched up their aggressive, energetic pop-rock style to a more laid back, pleasant synthpop sound. The EP, with it's 4 songs, haven't made a splash in the pop fandom, but it earned generally good reviews from critics, and a warm reception from their fandom. Also, they did a [Q&A](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/817u3o/we_are_aly_and_aj_back_after_ten_years_ask_us/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=popheads) on our little subreddit not so long ago, check it out if you want some reasoning to give their EP a high score.

#[billie eilish - don't smile at me](https://imgur.com/a/PpxcOJz)

the queen of lowercase herself, the newest edgy queen on the block, [billie eilish pirate baird o'connell](https://i.imgur.com/onVUowQ.jpg) made a name for herself when she ~~attacked the queen's ships and stole the spices~~ released her debut single, [ocean eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQgxhJPEkyI), which quickly went viral and took over the younglings of tumblr. working with her brother, who you might know from glee and modern family (but you probably don't), she soon released a 9 track ep in august 2017, with barely any reviews, but people liked it anyways as it peaked at #126 on billboard. with her making near lorde-level bops at the age of 14, we must wonder, what Billie's, i mean, billie's, future holds for her. even though some people really like &burn, it won't be included in the rate, considering it's a remix.

#[Julia Michaels - Nervous System](https://i.imgur.com/dGLl2iK.jpg)

Now onto our next one hit wonder, who you could thank for amazing songs, like Justin Bieber's Sorry, the rate winner Slumber Party, or Janelle Monae's Make Me Feel. Although she's been making huge coins with her songwriting talent since 2013, she only appeared in the mainstream when her hit single, [Issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNinUliPDqU) in 2017, almost catapulted into the Billboard top 10, peaking at #11. Half a year later, she released her 3rd EP, Nervous System, which was met generally favorable reviews. She's well known for her refreshing style of soft-moaning inspired pop, that many predict as the new big style of pop, which we hope isn't. With a top 50 peak on the Billboard 200, her EP is the most successful of this rate, but we all know how that works out.

1. [Issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ke4480MicU)

#[Maggie Rogers - Now That the Light Is Fading](https://learn.getgrav.org/user/pages/11.troubleshooting/01.page-not-found/error-404.png)

Next up, it's Maggie Rogers. You might ask who she is, and honestly, no idea, but she makes bangers, that's for sure. The Queen of the Adult Alternative Song Chart, Maggie Rogers released her first major label EP in 2017 after two independently released albums in 2012 and 2014. Although it didn't stirred much water, but the EP is full of amazing songs, including her almost-entered-the-top-100 song, [Alaska](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90izyTNM7hE), and the just as successful [On + Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWt5ywbLhO8). But honestly, who needs chart placements, when you have talent? P.s. you people really need to give this EP a chance so I recommend everyone to not write it down as some filler appearing in the rate.

1. [Color Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebt86W0EJnM)

#[MØ - When I Was Young](https://i.imgur.com/ldeYjuc.jpg)

The fifth contender, who also coincidentally [had a recent AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/8ecj0k/hi_everyone_this_is_mø_cant_wait_for_your_ama_qs/), the queen of curly fries and LoL, MØ blessed us with this EP in last year's October. Although she is an already established artist, with hits like [Lean On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os2eBLcuJpE) under her name, her EP still debuted to lukewarm reception, despite the positive reviews of the critics and the fans. MØ emerged from the Danish waters with her feature on Iggy Azaela's hit song, [Beg For It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j5vmAH9VeE), in 2014, and then reached her fame status with another feature on Major Lazer's aforementioned certified bop, Lean On, in 2015. Later on, in 2016, her third big feature, on anohter Major Lazer song, brought her her #2 peak on the U.S. charts with [Cold Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHrh_XFiXLI), in collaboration with Justin Bieber. Ever since then, while she only released this EP, she's been very active, releasing international hit songs, and featuring on not one, but two Charli XCX mixtapes.

#[Rebecca Black - RE / BL](https://i.imgur.com/POtPvrA.jpg)

Oh boy... I don't think I have to talk about Rebecca Black's [past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0) to anyone. Even if I should, I don't want to because it's still too painful. After her...debut? to the mainstream, she had to retreat to anonymity for a few years, to stop all the hate she was receiving for releasing the albeit one of the worst songs ever created, but overall innocent song. The queen of Black Fridays, who literally invented [fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XAa0NWhEyg), partying, and [excitement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBuLBmdn_dc), returned last September with the surprisingly decent EP, RE/BL, that made her an actually considerable pop artist.

#[Rina Sawayama - RINA](https://i.imgur.com/xWeKjbw.jpg)

Rina Sawayama is *THAT* girl. After releasing a few singles without much buzz, she burst into the alter scene with her very well received debut EP, RINA. Despite still being mainly unknown to the general public, she is already considered a fashion icon, having appeared in Vogue Magazine and Nylon Japan, and is also considered a "digital age pop pioneer" by many. Her music is mainly R&B influenced pop or straight up R&B, with heavy undertones and criticisms of modern technology, basically the music version of Black Mirror S2.

#[Sigrid - Don't Kill My Vibe](https://i.imgur.com/W6DcpfZ.jpg)
 
Sigrid, the next Carly Rae Jepsen in line but without the one successful single, first appeared on the pop map when she released her first single, [Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvvsw21PgIk), that became medium successful in her country, Norway. Ever since then, she keeps releasing one snyth-pop bop after the other, with increasingly growing success, going as far as a UK top 10 hit with [Strangers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3hjpNuvapQ). You might also know her from the Justice League soundtrack, from The Sims 4, or from [watching Planet Earth on a plane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t91sXNOOXQc). Also, don't forget, her next EP is coming out on May 11th!

Well, that's it about the albums, now onto the part everybody clicked on this thread for(even though I had to learn Paint to edit the shitposts in the previous segment):

#THE RULES


**I. DO NOT MISS OUT ON ANY SONG**

Not only will it fuck up the program if you don't rate every song and makes your submission unqualified but you will also miss out on sooo many bops. Dynamite snatched my wigs, Alaska cured my acne, and Tunnel Vision resurrected my will to live.

**II. SONG SCORES ARE FROM 1 TO 10**

But, you will each have the usual **ONE** 0 and **ONE** 11 to give out for the best and the worst, though, you are not obligated to give out these scores, if you don't feel any song deserved a 0 or an 11, just don't give it to anyone. Decimals are accepted until **ONE DIGIT**, like 6.8, more digits make the program u/AutoMod-levels of problematic. Don't do us like that.

**III. MOST IMPORTANT RULE**

**NO SABOTAGE.** If any of y'all hoes dare to sabotage any album, that will ruin the fun for everyone, and make the whole experience bad. It's just a bunch of Reddit nerds rating some flopped albums, don't try to "2016/11/09;Moscow, Russia" this bitch. Nobody is pleased if they fave lose, but that's part of the game. Was I pleased when Los Ageless robbed Lorde at gunpoint brutally? NO. But I still dealt with it, because not only in the end Lorde won with album avg which is a fact but also because the real winners are us because we got to listen to those amazing songs. Just in case, I will go through everyone's post history, have a quick chat with their parents and teachers and siblings, and collab with the Thought Police from 1984 to figure out their actual thoughts and feelings about the songs(jk, Kimora). Fr tho, **DO NOT SABOTAGE**. It's not a cute look. Oh, and I reserve the right to not accept score averages for albums under 3, because not only there are no bad albums in this rate, but also because that counts as sabotage. If that still happens, I will PM the guilty person to change their scores nicely, if they fail to comply, their scores will be disqualified and they gay cards will be suspended for 2 to 5 workdays.

**IV. STANNING RULES**

Stanning artists can be cool. But please, if you give out perfect averages(meaning that an artist received a minimum 10 average), give me some explanation in comments. It's not necessary, and giving out perfect scores is fine, I did it plenty too, but explanation is always good and comments are welcome. Also, stan wars are fine **AS LONG AS IT'S JUST BANTER**. Blind hate comments, doxxing, shittalking others in an aggressive manner and not as regular reading for fun, and other malicious acts, **ARE A HEAVY NO-NO AND DOXXING WILL RESULT IN BANS**. Take that shit to Stan Twitter. Being messy can fun, being a bad person just makes you the U.S. President. Also, hate crimes like giving your 0 to Dynamite will result in a public execution, just saying.

**V. COMMENTS**

Comments are encouraged and welcome. We all love a hilarious read or an essay-like praise. I reserve the right to highlight the best comments though, if you make art like [this](https://i.imgur.com/6iLEhWA.png) it deserves to be known. Although, try to keep it level-headed and don't write awful hate comments. Hate the song, not the artist. I will post every comment, but if it's problematic, I will ask you to either change it or it will be left out. I'm not trying to be a tyrant but popheads is a fun place even if a Slumber Party 3.0 happens. Keep it that way

**VI. FORMATTING**

As I already said, [here's a pre-prepared link to send your scores in](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=amumumyspiritanimal&subject=The%202017%20EP%20rate&message=Username%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Ten%20Years%0A%0ATake%20Me%3A%0A%0AI%20Know%3A%0A%0APromises%3A%0A%0AThe%20Distance%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20don%27t%20smile%20at%20me%0A%0ACOPYCAT%3A%0A%0Aidontwannabeyouanymore%3A%0A%0Amy%20boy%3A%0A%0Awatch%3A%0A%0Aparty%20favor%3A%0A%0Abellyache%3A%0A%0Aocean%20eyes%3A%0A%0Ahostage%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Nervous%20System%0A%0AIssues%3A%0A%0AUh%20Huh%3A%0A%0AWorst%20In%20Me%3A%0A%0AMake%20It%20Up%20To%20You%3A%0A%0AJust%20Do%20It%3A%0A%0APink%3A%0A%0ADon%27t%20Wanna%20Think%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Now%20The%20Light%20Is%20Fading%0A%0AColor%20Song%3A%0A%0AAlaska%3A%0A%0AOn%20+%20Off%3A%0A%0ADog%20Years%3A%0A%0ABetter%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20When%20I%20Was%20Young%0A%0ARoots%3A%0A%0AWhen%20I%20Was%20Young%3A%0A%0ATurn%20My%20Heart%20To%20Stone%3A%0A%0ALinking%20With%20You%3A%0A%0ABb%3A%0A%0ARun%20Away%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20RE/BL%0A%0AHeart%20Full%20Of%20Scars%3A%0A%0AFoolish%3A%0A%0AWasted%20Youth%3A%0A%0ASatellite%3A%0A%0AThe%20Great%20Divide%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20RINA%0A%0AOrdinary%20Superstar%3A%0A%0ATake%20Me%20As%20I%20Am%3A%0A%0A10-20-40%3A%0A%0ATunnel%20Vision%3A%0A%0ATime%20Out%3A%0A%0AAlterlife%3A%0A%0AThrough%20The%20Wire%3A%0A%0ACyber%20Stockholm%20Syndrome%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Don%27t%20Kill%20My%20Vibe%0A%0ADon%27t%20Kill%20My%20Vibe%3A%0A%0APlot%20Twist%3A%0A%0AFake%20Friends%3A%0A%0ADynamite%3A%0A%0AEND). This should save you a lot of trouble. I mean, if you want to fuck with me, you can send in your scores with a different format so I can spend a lot of time messing around and trying to get my life together, but that might come with the expense of me rigging your 11's(jk kimora, again). But no, for real, please use the pre-prepared link. Badly formatted messages are a pain in the ass, I've been told.

The scoring of the songs should go in this format in the message:

> SONG: SCORE COMMENT

An example of the correct format:

> Roots: 3 This song sounds like what an Infinity War spoiler feels like

Incorrect formats, that will still be accepted but I will publicly shame you in a callout post and your scores for the Good Place will go down by 400:

> bellyache; 10 cured my IBS, my E. Colis are shaking

> bellyache... 10; cured my IBS, my E. Colis are shaking

> bellyache: 10cured my IBS, my E. Colis are shaking

> idk the name of this song but its good 9 witty comment

> bellyache 10 - ɐuɐᴉɹ∀ ǝʞᴉl lǝǝɟ I

> every other stupid thing you might think of, just please don't, I trust y'all

Album comments are also appreciated, but they have a different format:

> Album: ALBUM NAME: COMMENT

Don't ask me why, but you **need the colon after the album name**, or at least it's been done like that in the past.

**IMPORTANT: DON'T USE DECIMAL COMMAS, USE DECIMAL POINTS, I USED COMMAS IN THE PAST AND IT MIGHT RUIN THE SONG PLACEMENT FOR A SONG YOU'D LIKE TO PLACE HIGHER**


####A quick PSA: You can change your score any time up until the reveal, just PM me on Reddit or Discord.
