Personally I thought this is a pretty decent song, but looks like popheads thought otherwise :sadgery:

###Hearts Full Of Scars:

**InfernalSolstice** (11): honestly such an unexpectedly big bop i was thoroughly shook my first listen that REBECCA BLACK could put out such an amazing song but she fucking did it

**cyborglilith** (10): LIFE‚ÄôS A BITCH BUT I‚ÄôLL MAKE IT MINE

**lexarqade** (10): Come the fuck through Rebecca.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): ok wig

**Shipsinker22** (10): Um. ? ! UM. ? ! UMMMM why the fuck is this the best song ive heard in this rate so far??? if sigrid didnt exist.... oh boy,,, this mightve gotten my 11

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): wow did she have to snap like this?

**chipsi1** (9): boop

**Mysario** (9): girl why you swearing

**kappyko** (8): Okay, Rebecca, I give in! This song is cute throwaway pop that I can't help but like

**Me-Luigi** (8): a bop

**ryanyu10** (7.7): I mean, it‚Äôs generic, but generic can be good and well-executed.

**twat\_brained** (7.4): This has to be one of THE most 2017 songs I've ever heard; the trop pop beat, the vocal splicing littered throughout the song, definitely one of the more generic songs in this rate. I can already tell Rebecca will be this rate's Hailee.

**CarlieScion** (7): cliched but i love the "lifes a bitch but ill make it mine"-line

**gannade** (7): a tad generic but im loving the lyrics

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Is this a generic inspiration song? Perhaps it is, but sometimes you just need a good, generic bop to get you motivated, and this one is a pretty serviceable example of the archetype. Sure, it's no Who Says or Survivor, but it's actually believable-yeah, Rebecca may have never had it bad as some other people, but being bullied at 13 because of a stupid song is bound to be emotionally taxing on a young teenager. So, even if this isn't the best song in this rate by a huge stretch, I'll give it a good score. And, hey, Rebecca swearing has me shook!

**static\_int\_husp** (7): I'm not sure what I was expecting with this album... It was not this

**TragicKingdom1** (7): is this the Zara Larsson - Joyride beat

**bbfan132** (6.8): The overall message is stereotypical but I do like what she's trying to say. The production sounds pretty basic and common, and her vocals were mixed oddly, but it's definitely an improvement from her old music.

**johnazoidberg-** (6.5): When I was in college my friends asked me to stop listening to Friday because they hated it and knew I was only listening to it ironically. I had headphones in, and it still annoyed them. Oh how far our lil Becca has come to actually sing well. This songwriting sucks noodles though

**SkyBlade79** (6.5): Kind of edgy but not too bad overall.

###Hearts Fully Intact:

**CanadianSkeleton** (6): Good until the EDM ending

**cucumberanti** (6): cute but generic

**JohnnyToby** (6): sounds like it belongs in 2017 and 2009 at the same time.

**shineflyer** (5.5): it's generic trop-pop. accept the truth

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): Very middle of the road and generic. Nothing really wrong with it, but it also sounds like an Abercrombie commercial

**onceberry** (4.5): Generic but damn Rebecca congrats on the voice

**Yatcho** (4.5): Rachael Platten called this generic

**thatgreekguyraul** (4): Weak lyrics. It is the typical ‚Äúself-empowerment‚Äù song.

**whatareblackhole** (4): This song is soooo cheesy. She has a pretty voice, but it also borders musical theatre.

**karenthecockpitpilot** (3): i can't find anything good about this song besides the (somewhat shallow) message

**Kaylaboe** (3): she doesn‚Äôt have the range to pull off this song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): I know we‚Äôre all shocked Rebecca isn‚Äôt writing Friday-level tragedies, but that doesn‚Äôt make this music automatically good. Her vocals are robotic here, and the lyrics are laughably bad, reading more like a motivational poster than a song. I do enjoy the instrumental a little, although it is really generic, and doesn‚Äôt do much to save this track.

**awhile2** (2): i was really hoping this project would be good

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): this the friday girl and this song sounds like friday ahahahahahah

###They Called Back:

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this sounds like melanie martinez covering twenty one pilots and i feel like tumblr just came by me saying that

**Leixander** (10): that intro is everything

**twat\_brained** (9.7): Songs like these make me believe Billie really was only 15 when this came out, but the glockenspiel definitely makes this sound very cute and childlike. So much so that I almost forget she's swearing in this. A grower for damn sure.

**shineflyer** (9.5): am i biased towards ukulele? maybe. but I really like the contrast between happy music and sad lyrics, it's always a fun thing to hear. it's like if the kickstarter music was an actual song, and then talked about a breakup.

**Dracyoshi** (9): This song is so cute, omg. And I love her voice. Are the lyrics a bit immature? yeah. But as with the rest of the EP, they make this song really endearing and a fun listen.

**kappyko** (9): Cute and twee, although it may be a bit too saccharine for most! Akin to Ingrid Michaelson or something, which is always a plus to me.

**SkyBlade79** (9): "party favor" sounds like it should just be a sweet little ukelele ballad. Billie's voice sounds very smooth and youthful. It does start very awkwardly, with a recording voice message that gradually fades into a full quality song, but it definitely hurts the whole song from a listener's perspective. The first part just has bad sound quality, and you can't get around it. Once the song gets going, it's very charming, at least if you ignore the lyrics. It's actually a song about a sudden breakup, as is evidenced by very memorable chorus of "I hate to do this to you on your birthday / happy birthday, by the way." She also swears on this track which was rather unexpected, but I like it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Possibly the most Billie Eilish track ever, it‚Äôs a complete fuck you in the best  way possible. Part lo-fi TV commercial music, part self-aware callout, I love the constant references to a birthday party, and the ‚Äúphone call‚Äù in question works quite well for this track.

**Raykel** (8.7): "If you don't stop I'll call your dad." Ugh I know it's supposed to be childish but the fact that she's 15 here makes this a little too real. Other than that, I love this concept.

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): a cute little song

**Mysario** (8.5): ummmmm voicemails can't last this long! lyrically though, this is my favourite off the album even though I'm not a big fan of the song itself

**henry413** (8.3): reminds me of meghan's work (which is a good thing, pls don't kill me)

**CanadianSkeleton** (7.5): Sweet

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): Tinashe and Young Thug did it better

**bbfan132** (7): it's cute, and i like the idea of the song being a voicemail that turns into a normal song, but... it sounds too normal, i guess. i feel like i could hear this at a high school talent show.

**ryanyu10** (7): One of the weaker songs here, but still good ‚Äì sounds like one of those Youtube indie pop channels.

**karenthecockpitpilot** (6.5): bad lyrics bad melody but still has her charm :)

###They Deleted The Message:

**Bendariaku89** (6): it‚Äôs nice. not amazing, but i would never call it bad.

**cucumberanti** (6): cute but forgettable

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Most of this song is an ok little acoustic ditty. But the first minutewith the voicemail effect muddying the voice is something I cannot stand. I want to listen to music at a decent quality. I don't care that its supposed to be artistic.

**Yatcho** (5.5): Way too simple for me, not worth listening to again

**CarlieScion** (5): the fake "low-fi" intro with the ukulele feels so contrived

**johnazoidberg-** (5): This sounds like it plays at the end of a movie where suburban teenagers fall in love

**lexarqade** (5): It's not for me.

**Shipsinker22** (5): not my favorite but I don't regret listening to it I guess

**thatgreekguyraul** (5): The embedded call at the beginning was perfect but the instrumentation is incredibly weak. Sounds like a song one would play at a high school prom or dance.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): this sounds like it should accompany a Downy commercial

**patronsaintofaspies** (4.5): Oh, God, this is one of the only times where Billie's edginess doesn't help strengthen the EP and ends up sinking it down. The taunting tone in her voice here makes me convinced that if Billie was ever in my class at school, we would be archenemies. The trop pop flavour also makes me cringe. The only saving grace here is that the chorus is actually kind of catchy, though I'm not sure if it's a good kind of catchy or a bad one.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.4): it's no Party Favors by Tinashe

**EpicFreakingLlama9** (4): Is this meant to sound like YouTube royalty free music

**awhile2** (3): ukulele jams are qwhite overrated imo

**gannade** (3): this entire EP but especially this song sounds like melanie martinez which is not a good thing. it's nothing lana or halsey hasnt done better

**JohnnyToby** (3): who hurt this little girl

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): basically if telephone part 2 was made with that tingly royalty-free ukelele music from youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYbUzpHxCfk

**whatareblackhole** (2): Ukulele should have died in 2008.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (0): ew what the fuck was that indie ukulele avacadies and banaynays shot

###Roots:

**CarlieScion** (10): omg i love MO

**cyborglilith** (10): cinematic

**Kaylaboe** (10): i got no roots for my home, was never on the ground

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Lowkey terrified of the slightly haunted tone of this song, but I love the strings!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): God, this is the MO I know and love. Her string of nearly flawless singles before this EP went wholly unnoticed, and instead of doubling down on poppy attempts to be the next star, she dropped this EP of tracks that felt much like the music fans fell in love with in the first place. Roots has a really weird and ominous atmosphere and a glorious instrumental that fits the almost holy ambience.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): There are plenty of great songs that open up an EP or an album, even if actually making them is easier said than done, but I've never heard a first track as unique as this one that still manages to capture its purpose fully. It mixes the liturgical vibes of Now That The Light is Fading and the dark atmosphere of Copycat, and it ends up being better than those two songs in the process.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): when I first listened to it I was surprised, but it grew on me

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): goddamn this is an opener

**ryanyu10** (8.8): The end really redeemed the start.

**kappyko** (8): Serving Nico and medieval music! Alice Merton and her should fight

**Me-Luigi** (8): her 'Ferrari', transition from NMTF to a new, poppier sound

**SkyBlade79** (8): Not pop enough for popheads but still a great song, very NMTF styled

**twat\_brained** (7.7): Loving the major Badlands vibes from this!

**Mysario** (7.5): this feels like more of a closer song instead of an intro track, so it's hard to appreciate. plus, I got no roots

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): It was cool, but I feel like I spent the whole song waiting for the song to start

**Banananaise** (7): okay this makes me want to play a kinda sino-gothic horror game

**cucumberanti** (7): a bit monotonous but i dig the vibe

**gannade** (7): the first minute was absolutely awful but managed to come back very nicely

**TragicKingdom1** (7): a lot of wasted buildup

**whatareblackhole** (7): I think this is a weird opener. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the horns.

**Yatcho** (6.8): Really good menacing atmosphere built up but it doesn't really pay off

**bbfan132** (6.6): This is a poor imitation of a Bj√∂rk or a Nico song. Their songs are actually *interesting*, and this is... not.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): it's like a florence song if florence wasn't interesting

###Branches:

**shineflyer** (6): why does this feel like middle ages pop

**strawberryswing1** (6): this felt like it lasted 6 minutes

**thatgreekguyraul** (6): Pretty standard track. Nothing outstanding about it.

**johnazoidberg-** (3): This is the musical equivalent of an establishing shot

**Bendariaku89** (2): okay. this entire ep has been AMAZING, but roots is a song I can‚Äôt get into. it reminds of me if Lana Del Ray made a war march.

**RandomHypnotica** (2): this song is about 2 minutes too long

**Shipsinker22** (1): I absolutely hate this song. The beginning production sounds like it sampled Super Mario Bros 2, Bowsers castle theme. this gives me nightmares and i cannot believe i was forced to listen to it again.

###Bb's:

**Bendariaku89** (11): after listening to this track a few more times, I like it more than my original eleven. it‚Äôs a pretty amazing track and I didn‚Äôt realize that until now. the production is great and the vocals match it.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i love the title hehe

**ryanyu10** (9.9): Clearly the best song of this EP.

**Me-Luigi** (9.5): I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Its really good but this is probably the worst her voice is in her music.

**SkyBlade79** (9): This is such a bop. It‚Äôs really sad but the way that the production swings to match her intonation is very masterful and just makes the song so pleasing to listen to.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): break up song but cute?

**Mysario** (8.5): the name of this song bothers me because I keep reading it as "b flat"

**twat\_brained** (8.3): Someone needs to make a fanmade version of this changing the lyrics to say they will always love BB8 from Star Wars. I say this as someone who has never seen a Star Wars film.

**rickikardashian** (7.5): the shitpost netter be I'll always love you by Whitney/Dolly

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Not going to lie, I always hate it when 'baby' is pronounced with an accent. Especially when the '-by' is pronounced harshly. Even so, I actually ended up liking this song a decent amount, even if it's probably the weakest one on the album. It does contain interesting themes of love lingering on after a relationship ends, though.

**Shipsinker22** (7): okay yeah a fine bop but her vocals are... not sounding good

**bbfan132** (6.8): This could be a decent summer song, but it got boring for me pretty quickly. Also, shouting "RIOT GAL" doesn't make this song better.

###Aa's:

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): this is mean but this wouldve been better without vocals

**shineflyer** (6.5): i keep reading the title of this as "b flat"

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Kinda forgettable and a bit underwhelming with how nice that beat is

**whatareblackhole** (6): This bitch loves an outro. This song was fine. Not my favorite, but still okay.

**JohnnyToby** (5): so she's just a discount Charli XCX

**thatgreekguyraul** (5): One of the weaker songs on the EP. The production was constant and was boring, unfortunately.

**cyborglilith** (2): sounds like a bad remix

---

###Julia Made It Up To Them:

**kappyko** (10): The lyrics are problematic, sure, but this is literally one of the best songs in the rate.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a bop

**mudkip1owo** (10): such a fun bop

**Bendariaku89** (9): with a chorus like that, you‚Äôd think it‚Äôd get annoying more and more. it doesn‚Äôt quite go there, which is nice. Even the vocal beat works really great. the best song in the album by a far margin.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.8): almost makes up for how underwhelming the first part of this EP is

**chipsi1** (8.5): omg this bops wh

**cucumberanti** (8): love that they recorded her breathing and looped it to use as a backing track. the way her vocals overlap each other is so good

**Shipsinker22** (8): I've never made it all the way through this until now but it's actually quite good? I'm surprised. the beginning of the song is atrocious but it gets good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I really like the beat in this one, it‚Äôs really dancey, and the way Julia uses her background vocals is pretty fascinating to me.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): I could get on board with more songs like this where Julia doesn't pretend to be this vocal powerhouse and just has some pleasant instrumentals in the background,

**JohnnyToby** (7): this EP shoulda been called voicenotes with all the vocal chopping

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Bit of a toned-down, lowkey song, which prevents it from being a show-stopper, but it's one of the most accessible tracks on the EP. Julia doesn't try to outdo her vocal range here, and she achieves that by coming up with an easy to sing but absurdly catchy hook. This is probably going to be one of her less controversial songs in this rate.

**ryanyu10** (6.9): That‚Äôs a lot of lyrics for a comparatively small amount of actual substance. Music makes it up for me a bit though.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): It takes way too long for the song to get going, I feel like the second chorus should've been replaced by the final one.

**Yatcho** (6.5): The girl can write a hook but that's not enough for this song

###Arrest That Bitch:

**shineflyer** (6): the intro's great, but i don't really love where it goes from there.

**SkyBlade79** (6): is the first lyric really about his dick size? screaming

**static\_int\_husp** (6): The beat is boring and uninspired, and the lyrics are repetitive. The definition of a mediocre song

**bbfan132** (5.5): Yay! Bringing feminism back 50 years and having strange production that doesn't work at all in one song? Wonderful... /s

**thatgreekguyraul** (5): The song would actually be better if she did not repeat the same lyric four times during the chorus.

**whatareblackhole** (5): Once again, kind of bland. And the lyrics scream, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like other girls.‚Äù

**awhile2** (2): i wish i could be the tennis table girl that you want

**EpicFreakingLlama9** (2): So repetitive that Fifth Harmony asked for tips

amumumyspiritanimal: # Nervous System

# #myfirstout

---

**Overall average**: 6.211

---

**TragicKingdom1**: Julia goes for a sparse singer-songwriter mood here and she achieves it but that's not really an accomplishment. A lot of this bland and/or annoying, especially the last 3 songs. I feel like she would've been better off going for an EP of leftovers along the lines of Sia's This Is Acting. [Grade: D+]

**Bendariaku89**: it wasn‚Äôt great. six songs were just there and kind of boring, even her single Issues felt really off because of her vocals. the only song I genuinely liked and actually would listen is Make It Up To You (gave it a 9), but one out of seven isn‚Äôt a great percentage. anyway, that song was really nice so I‚Äôm sad the others weren‚Äôt as great. and Pink is atrocious I‚Äôm sorry.

**Krugo1**: I only knew the lead single prior to this, which I admittedly didn‚Äôt hate. The EP struggled to find a cohesive sound and got remarkably weaker as every song passed, leaving me genuinely stunned at its lackluster closer.

**shineflyer**: It's overall good, even if there's songs that are much weaker than the rest.

**Banananaise**: wow! tight

**RandomHypnotica**: It's easy to see why Julia is such a successful songwriter, but I found a lot of tracks on this album to just slightly miss the mark.

**thatgreekguyraul**: I struggled going through this album. Julia, please stick to writing for other artists. Vocals are terrible, just terrible. She desperately needs a vocal producer. I know Selena (who Julia writes for) gets flack for not being able to sing, but at least she has the production to make some decent, sometimes well-above average songs. Julia has nothing. She makes terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible songs. Not to mention the opening song (and her biggest hit) of her EP is about wanting to stay with someone who she knows is toxic.

**mudkip1owo**: i used to have this ep on repeat lol

**Mysario**: i think the best songs on this EP are the saddest, which i don't know if that says something about me or her

**chipsi1**: Nervous Selena Gomez Writer

**cyborglilith**: She chose the perfect title for the album.

**Yatcho**: Julia clearly couldn't afford to keep the bops for herself

**letsallpoo**: people who hate on julia are probably obese. she gave us bop after bop and people dare disrespect her

**patronsaintofaspies**: The first time I listened to this EP, my immediate reaction was 'God, what is this trash?'. Later on, though, I managed excused the flaws it has-weak vocals in several spots, and a few songs that should have gone to other artists-in order to appreciate Julia's strong songwriting and undeniable creativity. I'm not sure if she should go though with the whole solo career thing, but I'll definitely give her a few chances if she does. I'd give her a vocal coach, too.

**theburningundead**: I can't help but feel that she has a lot more potential than is shown in the end product here. Even though there are several decent tracks many of them feel a bit underdeveloped and underwhelming with a fairly predictable structure and no great payoff at the end

**Elitefourbrad**: Honestly, this EP would be better if she didn‚Äôt sing so much in it.

**cloudbustingmp3**: sometimes it's just best to write for other people

**henry413**: Gurl your voice is grating. Also, stop sending your best materials to others.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: why does she sound like she's singing with a mouth full of cotton balls

**Me-Luigi**: whisperqueen snapped

**rickikardashian**: I understand the criticism that some songs in the album romanticize toxic relationships, but I kind of feel like it‚Äôs unfair. For me it‚Äôs kind of refreshing seeing someone admit to their faults and mistakes in relationships, considering there‚Äôs a lot of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good and the other is bad‚Äù, and I appreciate how especific Julia can be about her problems

**whatareblackhole**: Oh, Julia. What did we do to deserve this? I‚Äôm confident that Ms. Michaels is an incredible songwriter, but I‚Äôm disappointed that these are the songs she‚Äôs chosen to write for herself. These songs paint her to be an insufferable character, one that is in no way relatable but in every way unlikable. I want Julia to do well in front of the mic, but I think more time behind it will get her to where she needs to be.

###Divided:

**cyborglilith** (10): IM CRYING RIGHT NOW

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i wish the Remix was rated, too, bc I wanna comment how the drop sounds like a cat begging for more food

**Mysario** (10): tbh this is better than the remix, sorry hamemr

**Shipsinker22** (10): VOCALS VOCALS VOCALS

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): reminds me of Disney, and with her amazing vocals, just raises this song very high.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): my wig was left on the other side with her

**ryanyu10** (9.4): MMMMMM I love some talent, and it's here.

**lexarqade** (9): These VOCALS

**shineflyer** (8.5): serving these vocals. i'm really glad i get to say that.

**twat\_brained** (8.2): Doesn't necessarily suit her voice but big ups to Bex for putting in the effort.

**10footnotes** (8): I like this more than the Crash Cove remix. It's nice to have dynamics sometimes, and this EP already has enough electropop drops. Rebecca's voice is good here as well.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): This *almost* sounds like something from Kesha. Almost.

**bbfan132** (7.8): Wow, this is much better than every other song on the EP. I like the powerful production that fits well with the motivational lyrics about moving on from a person who wasn't good for you, and her vocals actually sound normal and are mixed properly in this song.

**awhile2** (7): this is the best song on the ep solely because it makes me nostalgic for some late 2000‚Äôs radio disney bops (that would definitely sound a lot better than this)

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its fine

**SkyBlade79** (7): I actually really like the bridge on this, I wish the remix didn‚Äôt take that off.

**strawberryswing1** (7): the remix outsold

**Yatcho** (7): Still generic, but her voice sounds great here at least

###Multiplied:

**gannade** (6): rebecca doesnt have the vocal talent to pull off this song, kinda sounds like kesha doing a ballad that isnt praying

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I love this song about Pangaea! Okay, okay, I've heard the remix version of this is great and it does sound formidable at first listen, though the flaw is in the production-the production actually covers up Rebecca's vocal missteps, but it makes the song sound more manufactured in the process. Even if it's a decent song, it's not as much of a show-stopping ballad as one would hope it to be, unfortunately.

**Kaylaboe** (5.5): sounds like a bland eurovision ballad

**CarlieScion** (5): the production hides a lot of her vocal flaws in this

**kappyko** (5): Okay?

**thatgreekguyraul** (5): This song is not so divine.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I do quite enjoy the infamous Crash Cove remix to this but as it stands, this is a diet ballad that may have her strongest vocals on the EP, but is as bland as a box of triscuits.

**tf2manu994** (4.5): i literally just looked back and saw that i can use decimalification so uh

**JohnnyToby** (4): I won't love u unconditionally ms rebecca

**RandomHypnotica** (4): This sounds like the song you'd hear about 2/3 of the way through a Disney Channel Original Movie when the main character realises that they have made mistakes, and they should try and fix the situation.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): she sounds like the lady from grouplove also didn‚Äôt we rate this already

**whatareblackhole** (4): I feel bad because Rebecca is giving some excellent vocals, but the songs suuuuck.

**Raykel** (3.5): It sounds like she's saying "Christ, the great divine." She ended athiesm with this. Hillsong could never.

###They Linked With Her:

**Bendariaku89** (10): this song is just amazing. sometimes a song just amazes you out of the blue and it‚Äôs great.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this sounds very Diplo

**Me-Luigi** (9.2): A BOP

**kappyko** (8.5): its a bop but the drop is painfully generic, no?

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): After the relatively boring chorus on the last song, this track makes up for it with great, energetic production that manifests itself in the drop after the chorus. One of the most accessible songs on the EP, though it comes with a price-despite the fact that the chorus works very well, I can't help but feel like I've heard choruses like it in mainstream pop songs before.

**Banananaise** (7.5): i feel like i've heard this a hundred times which either means it was on triple j (radio station) heavy rotation or it was in some annoying ad

**karenthecockpitpilot** (7.5): kinda cliche but still sounds beautiful

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): queen of the digital information age

**Yatcho** (7.5): Really good production wasted on a kind of nothing song

**ryanyu10** (7): I relate to the song but I don‚Äôt like it much musically.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Here‚Äôs where the EP gets a bit stale and less interesting. The drop is pretty standard, and MO does much to help this track, but it still falls a bit by the wayside compared to the earlier tracks.

**bbfan132** (6.7): All of her songs sound similar, and I'm not a big fan of the sound. This sounds like cheap electropop. With the lyrics and message this song has, it could've been made into something much better than *this*.


###They Didn't:

**SkyBlade79** (6): nice enough but the drop is kind of annoying

**thatgreekguyraul** (6): An average song. The tropical house rhythm beams throughout.

**whatareblackhole** (6): This one‚Äôs kind of bland and the phrase ‚Äúlinking with you‚Äù is awkward.

**twat\_brained** (5.8): The verses are so good but I refuse to believe this wasn‚Äôt produced by The Chainsmokers. That‚Äôs not a good thing.

**shineflyer** (5.5): linking? like, electronically?

**Raykel** (5): I don't mind dated, I mind it when it's generic

**Shipsinker22** (4): basic song by an overhyped artist. This is who yall stan?

###Blown away:

**shineflyer** (10): it's so sweet and has such emotion to it. please be kind to the ballad for once

**whatareblackhole** (10): This song floored me the first time I heard it. The vocal performance, the subtlety of the piano‚Ä¶it also melds so beautifully together. A wonderfully written song.

**bbfan132** (9.5): I love how she's almost predicting her eventual fame throughout the song. You can tell that she's pouring her heart out and telling her true story, even if it's a bit too "simple" or noticeable for some people. A beautiful ballad.

**ryanyu10** (9.5): Best song of this EP, and I think quieter, acoustic songs are where her strengths lie.

**twat\_brained** (8.6): Anybody else think she sounds like Adele here? No joke that's what I hear

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): A quiet, emotional ballad. Not quite as great as the more energetic songs on the EP, but still a good closer.

**10footnotes** (8): Sigrid excels at making massive bops, but she has a great ear for ballads too. Her distinctive singing style conveys emotion very well, and her voice and lyrics are gorgeous here.

**kappyko** (8): Fuck it i like this

**Kaylaboe** (8): can i get a non-acoustic version? can i please get a non-acoustic version? this is super sweet though

**Shipsinker22** (8): I feel like i would rate it higher if it wasnt such a low energy song after 3 super high energy songs. But separately, i might rate it a 10 (because i love the lyrics and her voice) but the track order really screwed it.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7.8): u/--dynamite-- outsold

**CanadianSkeleton** (7.5): Kaboom bidi bom bye mountain

**cucumberanti** (7): this is nice but the audience wants the non acoustic ver

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Yay, an acoustic version of a song that doesn't involve a guitar! I have no idea what just happened but I'm in heaven. The song itself is cute, if nothing special,  but it does have a pretty unique metaphor with the whole dynamite thing. Sigrid's voice loses its snarling qualities in this track, and I'm not sure if it helps or hinders it. But it is serviceable, and so is the song.

**chipsi1** (6.5): why isn't this an acoustic cover of dynamite by taio cruize

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): i throw my hands up in the air sometime

###Blown up:

**JohnnyToby** (6): girlie thinks she can take down a mountain. Bless her heart.

**karenthecockpitpilot** (6): adele who?

**Raykel** (6): Just a taaad corny

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): A nice, if somewhat standard piano ballad.

**thatgreekguyraul** (5): I was yawning throughout the song.

**ryanyu10** (10): Best song of the EP.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I wasn‚Äôt sold on this track on a first listen, but I‚Äôve grown to love it, the duo work so incredibly well together, and when I saw Rina she brought out Shamir ?????? and [I got this picture of the two of them together.](https://i.imgur.com/s9LyBxR.jpg) This song is a bit slower than the others but the production snaps and it feels like an indie-addled slow dance bop.

**bbfan132** (9.4): I can connect closely with the lyrics of this song, and I love how modern this song is. Shamir was a great feature, and Rina is amazing as always. Also, I love how the song is slower and almost... soulful at times? Someone who isn't paying attention to the lyrics would think that this song is about a normal relationship, which makes it sooo much better.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): chill but gorgeous

**JohnnyToby** (9): Beautiful.

**Yatcho** (8.7): Shamir is a treasure, protect him

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): 'I didn't even leave my house last week, but I know what you did last night' oh shit

**chipsi1** (8): emofish

**cucumberanti** (8): the bridge of the song when rina and shamir are singing at the same time is the closest we‚Äôll ever come to touching God

**lexarqade** (8): Shamir really went off here. This song is super relatable

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): wow i feel attacked bc I do lose track of time constantly scrolling on Reddit

**thatgreekguyraul** (8): The R&B feel of this track is great. Love the featured artist. Great chemistry between both of them.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): A slightly slower song after the first three tracks, but it's by no means worse than them. Some of Rina's most unique vocal takes are present on this song, and even if I find critically examining modern-day technology to be kind of cliche most of the time (I'd be much more worried about how advanced technology will be used in the future) I can ignore my dislike of the topic once I ignore the merits this song has.

**shineflyer** (6.5): there's that one part with the same melody as Cyber Stockholm Syndrome and it keeps throwing me off

**twat\_brained** (6.3): You could've told me this was an FKA Twigs song and I'd believe you. I also believe Rina is slightly out of her depth on this one, and Shamir isn't doing much to help. If I had to cut one song from this EP this'd be my frontrunner.

**CarlieScion** (6): this is too billie for me

**10footnotes** (4): I don't love this. I get that a slower song gives some balance to the EP, but Rina is capable of tackling difficult/personal subjects in uptempo songs (10-20-40, Alterlife), and this song just isn't very exciting.

**Shipsinker22** (4): i am extremely bored by this track and the other voice on it is annoying

**whatareblackhole** (4): Groan, I literally hate any song that‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúSocial media is evil, bleh!‚Äù Also, ‚ÄúGoing down the drain‚Äù has the same melody as ‚ÄúCyber Stockholm Syndrome.‚Äù

**mudkip1owo** (0): shamir is awful on this song jeepers

###Internet Prodigies:

**JohnnyToby** (11): Cold and raw

**CanadianSkeleton** (10): I know it‚Äôs just an interlude but LISTEN. The vocals, the melodies, the synths, and the end where she repeats the title, they‚Äôre all reasons I love this thing.

**gannade** (10): ugh should be a full song

**Leixander** (10): how to make a great interlude pt.2

**Bendariaku89** (9): like the other interlude, it‚Äôs too short. and if extended would be an amazing song.

**twat\_brained** (9): What is it with artists claiming songs with the same title as Kanye? First Britney, then Charli now RINA??? Man needs to give it up now

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): Clearly the superior phone call song in this rate

**Yatcho** (8.3): Really interesting take on a ballad. Can this even really be considered an interlude?

**bbfan132** (8): The way she connects the Internet with normal relationships and love is perfect.

**Kaylaboe** (8): this would work really well as an opener tbh

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): Kanye shaking

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Kanye West could never

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): its an interlude ‚Äî\\\_(?)\_/‚Äî

###People With Taste:

**CarlieScion** (6): can they stop calling 2 minute songs interludes

**johnazoidberg-** (6): And you're sure this isn't just an unreleasd song by the Cardigans? Because she sounds EXACTLY like Nina Persson on My Favourite Game

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I have trouble remembering much from this interlude. I do remember that Rina had lovely vocals here and that it was alright, if kind of slow, but not much else. I don't think ballads would fit very well into this EP. At least not if they didn't have energetic instrumentals in the background. This sure didn't, and I'm not sure it counts as a ballad, but there's that.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): hm

**Shipsinker22** (5): i dont like the voice but good production so 50/50

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): hello hello baby you called i cant hear a thing

**shineflyer** (4): i don't know that an EP needs two interludes, but you do you

**10footnotes** (3.5): Now, if this had been fleshed out into a full-length track, I might have liked that slow song more than Tunnel Vision.

**kappyko** (3.5): ehhhh

**tf2manu994** (3): nvm this interlude is trash

**whatareblackhole** (3): This dragged on for toooooo long.

**ryanyu10** (1.9): Who puts a second interlude in a EP? And this one is just bad.

###Better:

**whatareblackhole** (10): I really like how many of the songs on this EP are tied to place. She knows how to convey imagery really well. This one was a nice little bop.

**kappyko** (9.5): extra .5 for the beautiful synth in the bridge

**Yatcho** (8.7): Did Charli xcx write this chorus?

**ryanyu10** (8.2): One of the weaker songs on this EP? But it‚Äôs still great? What?

**CarlieScion** (8): wow a halfway upbeat track as a closer :wig:

**JohnnyToby** (7.7): Banks' wig is not bothered.

**twat\_brained** (7.7): it is a BIG MOOD listening to this at half past midnight

**bbfan132** (7.5): It's a nice closer, but I wish it was better (ha-ha). Maggie is very promising as a producer, songwriter, and vocalist, so I know that she'll only get better as time goes on.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Honestly, I'm only giving this a seven because the chorus was really easy to remember. Her delivery here is kind of boring and this song doesn't mesh well with the downtempo vibes she's aiming for in this album's production. It's not a bad song, but it's not what I'm looking for.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Not gonna lie, it was really hard to top 3 literally perfect singles, and while I like Better, it doesn‚Äôt add much to the table. The hook is repetitive, and the production isn‚Äôt nearly as special or visceral as her other tracks, but it‚Äôs solid.

###Worse:

**shineflyer** (6): it could be better, couldn't it?

**thatgreekguyraul** (6): It has a hint of atmosphere with electronica. Not bad but not stellar.

**Raykel** (5.5): I just hate how many times she says better. It's not even a catchy repetition.

**Shipsinker22** (4): okay srry maggie i fell asleep.

###People Without Taste:

**Leixander** (10): how to make a great interlude 101 - ms.sawayama is your teacher

**mudkip1owo** (10): i love this even though it's just a dumb interlude lol it's so fun

**theburningundead** (10): not to exaggerate or anything but this is possibly the greatest interlude on any album ever

**EpicFreakingLlama9** (9.5): Possibly my favourite interlude of all time

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): why isn't this a full song :despair:

**Bendariaku89** (9): too short. it‚Äôs amazing even if it is only a minute.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): this feels unnecessary, but i‚Äôm giving it a high score anyway!

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I wasn't expecting a interlude on an EP, of all things, and I wondered if this was just going to be Rina whispering something akin to Janet Jackson, but this somehow ended up being a cute, cartoony bop. If this doesn't Intro, I'm going to fly away from this sub.

**bbfan132** (8.5): The production makes you feel like you are freeing yourself from your burdens, which is exactly what the song is about. It's only an interlude, but it's a perfect one.

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): a legendary interlude

**rickikardashian** (8.5): I HATE WHEN INTERLUDES ARE BETTER THAN SOME SONGS IN THE ALBUMS AAAA. The transition from this to Afterlife is fucking dope tho

**CanadianSkeleton** (8): This makes me want to listen to more J-Pop

**cucumberanti** (8): why isn‚Äôt this a full song

**JohnnyToby** (8): cute

**RandomHypnotica** (8): Rina's LOVELESS, I would've loved to see this fleshed out into a full song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Short but sweet interlude

**Yatcho** (8): Where's the full version Rina??

**johnazoidberg-** (7): We love a song that sounds like our phone is ringing and makes us pull it out of our pocket eery 5 seconds. We stan

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): transitioned well

**tevinterimperium** (7): Wasn't this on the anti cigarette commercials or am i trippin

**twat\_brained** (7): I see potential in this interlude but I'm not exactly "starving" for more.

**Me-Luigi** (6.7): sis should have made this a full song???

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Insert clever comment complaining about rating interludes here

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6.5): The production is cool, I just wish it lasted a bit longer

###People Who Got A Time Out:

**kappyko** (5.5): oh its cute i guess but its not a song

**tf2manu994** (5): when the interlude is higher than the average of the rest of the album

**thatgreekguyraul** (5): Too short. I could not appreciate it.

**whatareblackhole** (5): It‚Äôs so hard to rate interludes, and this one is no exception. This is fine‚Ä¶but it only lasts a minute, so not much happens.

**ryanyu10** (4.9): Who puts an interlude in a EP? Especially one like this?

**shineflyer** (3): charli, is that you?

###I Promise:

**awhile2** (10): ok this is a fucking bop. The intro sounds kind of like a sample of Siouxise and the Banshees Cities in Dust which i love

**chipsi1** (10): TAME IMPALA!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): they really did not come to play

**tevinterimperium** (10): We love a melancholy bop we can pop our pussies to!

**Bendariaku89** (9.2): this vibes a lot

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): im getting a little tired of your broken promitheth promitheth

**EpicFreakingLlama9** (9): My favourite on this EP

**Leixander** (9): love the vibe of this song

**rotating3Dtext** (9): a mood

**twat\_brained** (9): This feels like a downtempo ‚ÄúHigher‚Äù, something you gheys will love

**bbfan132** (8.7): I like how they are taking a different approach to the topic of this song. Instead of writing an aggressive attack toward the guy who is cheating on them, they've decided to move on and turn it into an almost relaxing and relatable story. The production makes you feel like you actually are driving back from the cheater's house at night, which I enjoy a lot.

**ryanyu10** (8.2): Simple, but there‚Äôs a charming quality to this.

amumumyspiritanimal: **cucumberanti** (8): dreamy and atmospheric

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): The vocals here remind me very much of HAIM's music, and so does the song as a whole, if I'm being honest. It reminds me of walking by a bay facing the seaside during a lonely, frustrating night. If it weren't for the sheer energy behind Take Me, this would be the best song on Ten Years.

**thatgreekguyraul** (8): The weaker song on the EP. By no means bad but its counterparts take themselves to higher levels.

**whatareblackhole** (8): It‚Äôs vibey! I love it!

###I Lied:

**JohnnyToby** (6): goes dull the last minute

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): this is smooth af but her enunciation is freaky

**ImADudeDuh** (11): I love this song so much. The chorus of "I don't really wanna talk about it" is sooooooo good and this honestly is one of my fave songs of 2017. Bless MO

**chipsi1** (10): YAS

**SkyBlade79** (10): this has been my alarm tone forever. Just amazing, top tier production with some great lyrics. They really exemplify the apathy that everyone wants at some point. Just an amazing song in every way, I can recognize it instantly from the start. There‚Äôs nothing quite like it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I cannot get enough of this smoky intro to this song, and the verses that follow do nothing but justice to the wonderful instrumental we get here. It‚Äôs totally weird but utterly fantastic.

**whatareblackhole** (9): This one was cool! I like the beat and the muffled horn a lot.

**twat\_brained** (8.6): I hear the intro and my mind immediately darts to ‚ÄúHaunting‚Äù by Halsey. +2 for that! I just wish Mo would stay out of her head voice, that‚Äôd make it at least a 9 for me.

**bbfan132** (8.1): It's a bit repetitive at times, but that lends itself to catchiness, which I like. I also like the chill vibe of the prechorus/chorus, and the production actually works in this song.

**shineflyer** (8): now THAT's one NICE sax. and i don't think i've ever heard MO's head voice, it's really pleasant

**thatgreekguyraul** (8): Production is quite nice. Very reminiscent of Nicki Minaj‚Äôs ‚ÄúChun-Li‚Äù.

**10footnotes** (7.5): The beginning riff in this song sounds JUST LIKE the intro to Can't Bring This Down by Bridgit Mendler. Please, I need someone else to acknowledge this.

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): modusa

**Raykel** (7.5): I only like this for the sax

**cucumberanti** (7): the way her vocals are overlapping in the chorus is so satisfying

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I think the main flaw this song has is that the chorus (hook? drop? I dunno) that plays after the title drop is pretty...disappointing. It's not unlistenable, but MO saying 'let it go' over the sounds of glorified finger snapping is not what a song like this deserves. That brings the score down a notch.

**Yatcho** (6.8): I always think this song is Atlantis when it starts. I wish it was Atlantis

**kappyko** (6.5): it builds up to a nice bop but not too good

**JohnnyToby** (6): ok what sound is this girl trying to go with. I'm too picky tbh

**Shipsinker22** (6): oof no

**ryanyu10** (5.6): I‚Äôm not particularly impressed.

**CanadianSkeleton** (5): Didn‚Äôt snatch my wig but did give me a mullet

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): i have no clue of a single word she said

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): there's like a dying elephant noise in the background what is that

**bbfan132** (8.6): Another great song with a message that involves moving on from the end of a relationship or a friendship. The little vocal quirks in the prechorus are wonderful.

**ryanyu10** (8.6): This is a banger, and I like how it‚Äôs written, especially compared to the first two songs.

**thatgreekguyraul** (8): Love the anthemic feel to this.

**whatareblackhole** (8): This is a fun little bop! Sigrid needs to be the next main pop girl. She‚Äôs an excellent songwriter.

**cucumberanti** (7): when she sings ‚Äúit‚Äôs better to walk away than to run with fake friends‚Äù

**Raykel** (7): I can relate. Whew!

**shineflyer** (7): might as well shut down? sometimes it feels like that

**twat\_brained** (7): This just feels like an alternate draft of PT

**kappyko** (6.5): This is literally just the same song as the previous two lol

###Camilas:

**awhile2** (6): how many of us

**CanadianSkeleton** (6): Kinda disappointing, once you‚Äôve listened to DKMV you have high expectations for Sigrid

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): not bad but i also forgot what it sounded like immediately after it ended

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): SIGRID. Why did you do this again?! Another Don't Kill My Vibe clone?! At least this has a unique drop after the chorus, so it's a little different compared to the previous two songs, but the drop is...not that...good.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): energy is there but her voice is annoying :/

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This song kinda feels like a clone of a Sigrid song, it‚Äôs technically solid but not terribly interesting, and the chorus is kinda forgettable.

**mudkip1owo** (4): this song never clicked with me unfortunately

###Close People:

**thatgreekguyraul** (11): If perfection was a song, this would be it. Simply said.

**Bendariaku89** (10): totally reminds me of both Carly Rae Jepsen and Taylor Swift, both the production and the lyrics just screams both of them. the verses more Carly and chorus more Taylor.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I really don‚Äôt have a comment for this song but I just want to put something here in hopes that I see this comment featured because I‚Äôm a lonely hoe

**rickikardashian** (10): this song is so good it made me consider take off a point from every song, just because I truly believe they aren‚Äôt as good as this one. The lyrics and production capture the essence of the song perfectly, and I‚Äôm a whore for any song that has this good of a guitar riff.

**twat\_brained** (9.7): I feel like there‚Äôs another song that reminds me of this but I can‚Äôt quite figure it out. What I CAN figure out is how GOOD this song is!

**CarlieScion** (9): The production on this is mesmerising

**EpicFreakingLlama9** (9): Nevermind I lied this one is my favourite

**chipsi1** (8.5): yas

**bbfan132** (8.3): The chugging guitar line makes it feel like you are actually moving away and can "feel" the distance, in a way? That is super cool.

**ryanyu10** (8.3): Best lyricism of the EP (and nice production to boot), but that‚Äôs not really a challenge when compared to the other songs, ESPECIALLY the singles.

**cucumberanti** (8): the bass gets me so hyped I love it

**SkyBlade79** (7.5): great production, interesting lyrical themes, and their best vocals on this EP

**whatareblackhole** (7.5): A little weaker, but still strong and atmospheric. I‚Äôm proud of the girls!

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Unlike I Know, this sounded a little subpar to me during my first listen at night, but it sounded catchier after I slept well. The biggest flaw here is definitely the lack of attention-catching production. The synths need to be more interesting, especially during the chorus. Not bad, but it needs more oomph.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Like the reverb on this track, it‚Äôs a bit bland but the instrumental is nice.

###People Far Away:

**JohnnyToby** (5): bass is cute but it lacks any character

###It's Friday For You:

**Elitefourbrad** (11): This is just pure pop perfection and you really should not underrate her. The first time I heard this, I was shocked at how good of a song Rebecca could make.

**gannade** (11): Honestly I really did not enjoy 98% of the songs in this rate. I don't think the type of indiepop music that most of these EPs go for is really for me... so when this straightforward, extremely wellmade electropop song came on, it was like a breath of fresh air. thank you rebecca

**Banananaise** (10): i was so close to giving this my "onze points"

**Bendariaku89** (10): this songs just forces you to dance and not in a bad way.

**letsallpoo** (10): yaeji WISHES

**lexarqade** (10): Okay where are these bops coming from? I didn't expect to be handing out 10s to Rebecca Black of all people.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): she keeps on slaying oh my gosh

**mudkip1owo** (10): quite the bop i don't understand why some people don't like this one

**SkyBlade79** (10): This is what retro/throwback disco type of songs would sound like if they had great audio quality. The production is certainly a high point, as those synth riffs and varied claps provide a constant wave of The melody on this is just SO pleasing‚Ä¶ like, wow. The way that her voice bounces between high and low on ‚Äúfalling into you, foolish‚Äù in particular just stands out to me as great songwriting. I really do get a lot of Tove Lo vibes with the lyrics and the pre-chorus especially, which probably lends a lot to my enjoyment of this song. I think that her voice is definitely strong enough; it‚Äôs definitely not a powerhouse (though she is capable of really strong live vocals, as seen on her streams), but it does the job very well, and it sounds sweet as well. regardless, teh autotune on the bridge is a bit much, though I do think that's for artistic purposes.

**ryanyu10** (9.2): I‚Äôm surprised ‚Äì this is pretty good!

**shineflyer** (9): selena who? we only stan TRUE legends

**strawberryswing1** (9): wow when did rebecca become a pop queen

**twat\_brained** (8.6): I think Ashanti's crown is safe on this one. I've come to the conclusion that Rebecca's music isn't necessarily bad, but rather somewhat uninteresting

**10footnotes** (8.5): This is my favorite song on the EP: it's mature, catchy, and has a fun chorus that doesn't rely on a generic electropop drop (like Heart Full of Scars and Wasted Youth).

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): i'm sure surprised by how enjoyable her songs turned out to be

**cyborglilith** (8): BASIC BOP

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): By far the standout from this EP in terms of quality. It does sound like something that would be played in a store, but it's a good perfume shop track, gosh darn it! Probably the best song Rebecca's ever released that's not a remix, and certainly the song you should be sending to neighsayers who deny she has potential.

**Shipsinker22** (8): holy shit i am actually floored by the quality of her songs so far

**thatgreekguyraul** (8): This is great. Very sexy and catchy. I love it.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): ashanti is shook

**whatareblackhole** (8): This is a fun little bop! You go, Rebecca!

**cucumberanti** (7.5): a fun summer bop

**bbfan132** (7.4): I like how this song doesn't take itself too seriously. Her vocals and the electropop production of the songs on her EP aren't the best fit, but this is pretty nice.

**Dracyoshi** (7): Did I just walk into a perfume shop?

**Yatcho** (7): Serviceable trop pop

**chipsi1** (6.5): eh

###Fools:

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): A little better than the first song but it still sounds like background music from an Ulta or something

**CarlieScion** (5): why does these ep girls love their head voices so much

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): A bit better here, the beat is funky, and while this song would be massively improved by featuring any single other singer other than Rebecca, she does her best to not be so boring here.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): this sounds familiar....

**kappyko** (3): I prefer her voice on Friday. The production sounds cheap on here and really tinny, it's irritating.

Although Rebecca's EP might not have been that good, she still showed the biggest growth from her previous material and showe that you don't have to be Billie Eilish as a 15 year old to make good music as an adult. You go, girl.

---

**Overall average**: 6.585

---

**TragicKingdom1**: Rebecca shows a surprisingly decent amount of songwriting skill here. The songs are cohesive with a fair bit of momentum. However, they are held back by her awful vocals and the amateurish production. I don't think any song here stands out as very good or bad in the grand scope of the rate, so this EP is merely okay. [Grade: B-]

**Bendariaku89**: holy crap. I didn‚Äôt expect this from Rebecca Black. I knew she had a single Friday and Saturday but I came here with those songs in mind and this EP just blew any expectations out of the water for me. like Maggie‚Äôs EP, I don‚Äôt hate a single song. highlights were definitely Foolish and Satellite. the rest were just as good though. she‚Äôs definitely proven she‚Äôs matured and learned from her previous attempt and is willing to be a serious artist.

**selegend**: this was garbage and i had to bump up my scores to meet the minimum average

**Krugo1**: Another reason I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm doing this rating ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù, I can guarantee I would never have listened to anything Rebecca Black ever release otherwise (and it introduced me to some other solid songs). I actually liked the EP quite a bit, though I was a bit concerned about how many effects were layered on her vocals (because I fear they really strengthened the sound rather than her actually improving as an artist).

**shineflyer**: I'm really glad Rebecca's making a name for herself. What a redemption arc...

**Banananaise**: Rebecca Black is a modern tragic hero - she has been crippled by her early genius

**RandomHypnotica**: Honestly, the whole time I was listening to this album I just kept thinking it sounds like someone desperately trying to be creative and fun but lacking any real creativity/passion for making music.

**thatgreekguyraul**: First of all, for a meme-turned-YouTube personality, I have to hand it to her. Usually those in the YouTube world make just God-awful music but Rebecca‚Äôs is actually not bad. I did find some tracks to be lackluster but there is room for improvement.

**Mysario**: rebecca black once retweeted me many years ago, and while that's where i peaked, this EP shows that she is only going to get better as time goes on

**cyborglilith**: BY THE TIME YOU FINISH THIS ALBUM YOU SHOULD REALIZE REBECCA OUTTALENTS ALL YOUR FAVES

**Leixander**: a great effort from Rebecca! sadly there is not a standout track.

**letsallpoo**: Thinking of this song as a ‚Äúsingle‚Äù is a mistake. It‚Äôs an event, sure, whatever. It‚Äôs a ritual at this point ‚Äî just as some might sing ‚ÄúHappy Birthday,‚Äù in a variety of languages, on their birthdays, others sing ‚ÄúFriday‚Äù on their Fridays. Gotta get down on Viernes, Vendredi, Veneris. If the song‚Äôs infectiousness (not meme, virus) seems unfair,  it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre thinking of it as a single by any other name. But it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs for campfires, for drunken stumbles down the road, for humming in bed, for silently acknowledging when you look at a calendar, for doing as an impromptu acapella at lunch, for playing on the piano at parties so anyone can sing along. And just about everyone reading this can play it ‚Äî it‚Äôs just ‚ÄúHeart and Soul‚Äù with an extra ‚Äúbum-ba dum-ba‚Äù per note. This is a song we seem to have always known, and now will always know. The only other recent songs that have had this effect on me ‚Äî that are inked into the fabric of my everyday experiences so that I am helpless to defer to them on Pavlovian cue, like the Manchurian candidate‚Äôs Queen of Hearts ‚Äî are Lil‚Äô Mama‚Äôs ‚ÄúLip Gloss‚Äù and Das Racist‚Äôs ‚ÄúCombination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell,‚Äù which I sing compulsively when I see pass a MAC store or a‚Ä¶well, you know what it is. And isn‚Äôt it nice to have a song like that, with that power, divorced from such topical and fleeting referents, to have a song that‚Äôs as relevant to me now as it will be fifty years from now, and would have been fifty years ago. It‚Äôs not about the verses; supply whatever words you want. It‚Äôs about Friday, Friday. Yesterday was Thursday. Tomorrow is Saturday and Sunday comes afterward. So it goes.

**karenthecockpitpilot**: 2012 youtube cover singing is killing me,

**patronsaintofaspies**: Ugh, I feel guilty for saying that this isn't much of a good EP in the long run. I do genuinely think being bullied for a meme at the age of 13 wasn't fair to poor Rebecca, so even if the songs here are pretty generic overall, I am proud of her for making a record that's legitimately worth checking out. If she works with better people and improves her singing just a little bit, I think Rebecca may just be able to set up a niche for herself, even in the face of her past reputation.

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: üëè she üëè did üëè not üëè come üëè to üëè play üëè

**Elitefourbrad**: A great effort from the Friday singer.

**ImADudeDuh**: This is the most whelmed I have ever been listening to an album ever.

**rickikardashian**: I must have been like 12 when the Friday thing was happening. It was really fun to make fun of her and Justin Bieber's Baby, although I didn't really hate both of them. To be honest, it's ridiculous how much hate she got only for having a bad song. After that she  tried having other singles, that tbh kind of were just other "rich kid whose parents paid for a music video", and then she released Saturday years later, that even though it was good, it was still tied directly with Friday. This EP I feel was the right step on her career. I won't lie, it's not groundbreaking or outstandingly unique, but it's the first time I see her as Rebecca Black and not "the Friday girl. She has some really great catchy songs, and she finally sounds like a real artist, not just a meme making music. I think it's going to be hard for her to get to the mainstream, and I don't know if she'll be the biggest star out of this rate ^(spoiler: she probs won't be), but Im at peace she's not only over her past, but also making good music.

**twat\_brained**: I already knew Rebecca was more than "Friday" but this EP just isn't doing much for me. Also Rebecca can feel comfortable knowing she's not the worst singer in this rate.

**whatareblackhole**: I‚Äôm proud of Rebecca Black even though I didn‚Äôt like her EP very much. I think Rebecca definitely had the cards stacked against her, but she still delivered an EP that caters to her own imagination and sound past the vanity release of ‚ÄúFriday‚Äù from what feels like eons ago. None of these songs really appeal to my personal palette, but I respect what Rebecca was going for on this one.

###Who are my sons:

**awhile2** (10): having to choose between this and bellyahce for my 11 would be a really hard decision for me if RINA wasnt included in this rate

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): my song for my [@ManuRios](http://instagram.com/manurios)

**ryanyu10** (10): Okay that transition between the first verse and chorus had me SHOOK ‚Äì very close to being an 11, but the production was just a bit lacking here.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): wtf why is this a bop

**tevinterimperium** (10): I'm obsessed with "alright dude, go trip over a knife"

**cyborglilith** (9.5): sounds like a Crybaby song

**kappyko** (9.5): Transition between verses and choruses is jarring yet works effectively. Flourishes of organ in the verses and some keys kind of mislead the listener into thinking this is a continuation of idontwannabeyouanymore, then switches instantly into a fun electropop chorus.

**Mysario** (9.5): usually I'd hate the dumb random words being spoken in a song that sounds out of place, but it works for this song

**SkyBlade79** (9.5): "my boy" is another angrier track, about the immaturity of her boyfriend. There's another completely unexpected beat switch before the chorus, changing the song from a ballad to a certified banger. The pounding production and the vocal manipulation throughout the track complement Billie's voice well, and the lyrics are just as scathing as always: "my boy, my boy / he ain't a man and he sure as hell ain't honest". The biggest issue with this song is the rather weird voice clips included, probably from movies or something. It kind of ruins the flow of the song at many points. Regardless, the song is a bop!

**twat\_brained** (9.4): NGL the tempo change threw me off, but I've definitely grown to really love this one over the last few months. And you HAVEN'T lived until you've heard a room of people screaming "ALRIGHT DUDE GO TRIP OVER A KNIFE".

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Its got a really nice beat and its angsty lyrics are actually good

**karenthecockpitpilot** (8.2): trying to ignore some cringy ass lyrics parts

**chipsi1** (8): this is about her maplestory character

**lexarqade** (8): Come through tempo shift. This production is slick as hell.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I don't know whether people like this song or not, but even if they do, this is kind of a guilty pleasure. I like the focus on rhythm that's present here and the way Billie repeats the chorus is strangely endearing. Not sure whether there's a teenager on the planet that doesn't know how to say curse words, though.

**shineflyer** (8): hearing "he cuts em off" and then the beat switch was so good

**bbfan132** (7.9): i never thought that billie was going to end up having a song with jazzy/soulful vibes... but i like it! the production is nice, and i kind of love her soft yet emotive voice. the lyrics got a bit boring by the end, but the overall song is still nice.

**CanadianSkeleton** (7.5): Weird in a fun way, although I hate the papadas at the beginning just as much as in idontwannabeyouanymore. Great lyrics though, love that line about the split ends

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This chorus is everything, it really just is. The rest of the track is a little middling, but I can‚Äôt get enough of the chorus.

**cucumberanti** (6.5): the ‚Äúgo trip over a knife‚Äù line screams fake edgy i cringed

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): https://i.imgur.com/N4rZhDc.png

###These Bitches:

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): that little switch up at the beginning is nice, but it's hard to be excited about a song when the singer sounds bored af

**EpicFreakingLlama9** (6): Only good part of this song is the production

**thatgreekguyraul** (6): The lyrics are what prevent this song from excelling. It definitely takes its own route as I was stunned at some of the surprises the song had up its sleeve.

**whatareblackhole** (5): This song is fine, but some of her lyrics make me cringe, like the ‚Äútrip over a knife‚Äù part.

**CarlieScion** (4): god her voice annoys me, but the production saves this from being a 0

**JohnnyToby** (4): the more i listen to this chick the more i dislike her like shes 16 how is she singing about these things. Also  she's like Khalids female counterpart.

**TragicKingdom1** (3.5): not a fan of how she plays with the tempo a little bit

###I Know It:

**cucumberanti** (10): the production is so so so good. near the end when the instrumental clears for a couple of seconds before the bass kicks back in gets me every time

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): my reply when someone says I have microscopic nipples

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): 80s-style dream pop nostalgia wrapped up in a bow.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the talent really jumped out here... like it jumped out everywhere but ESPECIALLY here you know?

**twat\_brained** (10): The kind of song perfect for a late night drive going 120 on the highway

**whatareblackhole** (10): I fucking LOVE this bop. So so so so good.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): i dont know SHIT but this slaps

**bbfan132** (9.5): The layered and altered production/vocals are super soothing/relaxing, which goes along perfectly with the theme of empathy/feeling good that is established in the lyrics.

**Yatcho** (8.7): They're really into the synth-bops on this album. This is a very good take on these well worn genre

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Best song on this EP. It sounds a little out of the EP's comfort zone compared to the rest of the songs on it, which pays off.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): More of a slower synthy ballad as opposed to an upbeat bop, but I really like it. The breath-y vocals work over the moody production, which I really love. "You haven't left your bed in days" mood

**Bendariaku89** (8): it‚Äôs very floaty, so didn‚Äôt really catch me at the first listen. After a few more listens, it‚Äôs a lot better that I thought.

**JohnnyToby** (8): cutee

**KittyKate10778** (8): chill bop

**shineflyer** (8): is this EMOTION side B?

**kappyko** (7): Competent synthpop! Dreamy, a bit on the bland side of things, but the Phil Collins ripping and xylophone (?) bits are cute!

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I'm...not sure what to give this. The fact that it's about a friend with cancer definitely makes it sadder-there's more detail in this song's lyrics than the usual vague descriptions used whenever pop music talks about illness or pain-and I liked it very much when I listened to it the night before I typed out this post, since the production elements reminded me of walking through a house full of mirrors. Upon further reflection, though, I do think that it ends up being a bit dull. The vocals here are decent, but not passionate enough to get the point across for my taste. I can't deny the sincerity behind the song, but that sincerity could have ended up being much more palatable.

**ryanyu10** (7): This grows on you after a bit.

**SkyBlade79** (7): very chill but kind of lacking in substance

###These people don't:

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): i think the production is nice but it needs more energy

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This song sounds like Urban Outfitters and Forever 21 had a child

**tf2manu994** (4): less meh

###They Watched My Car Burn:

**Leixander** (10): i sit and watch your car buuuuuuuurnnnn with the fire that you star-ted-in-mee

**rotating3Dtext** (10): i love the sound of the match being incorporated into the song

**SkyBlade79** (10): Billie's vocals are strong throughout, and the outro, in particular, is great. As usual, the lyrics to this song are way more mature than you would expect from a fifteen year old; "watch" is about an unfulfilling relationship that doesn't, and can't, go anywhere. This appears to be a fan favorite. The high synths sound very unique, making the song easy to remember.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): One of her best tracks. The production is just incredible, with struck matches adding a seriously intimate touch, and the hook is the only one strong enough to rival bellyache. I love Vince Staples, but I much prefer this version, and the way Billie carries herself throughout the track is remarkable.

**kappyko** (9.5): Used to be a lowlight of the record, and is now one of my favorites. Really nicely set campfire atmosphere.

**twat\_brained** (9.2): The piano is this>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Billie just sounds so sweet here, how can anyone not love this??

**whatareblackhole** (9): I remember watching the video for this and hating it, but this song is great and leagues better than &burn, don‚Äôt @ me.

**bbfan132** (8.8): the harmonies of billie's own voice are heavenly. consider me a billie stan now.

**ryanyu10** (8.7): I‚Äôm living for this song ‚Äì like the match sound especially.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Appropriate lyrics for a nice little torch song

**cucumberanti** (8): loving the striking a match sound effect that keeps on looping in the background

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I actually didn't notice that I had finished my boy when this came up the first time, LOL. That being said, this is one of the better slow songs on the EP-actually, it's one of the best songs on it, period. There's some very promising elements of indie pop here that Billie can touch upon successfully once her career starts maturing.

**CarlieScion** (7): her voice is tolerable on this, i guess

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.5): this is almost exciting

###They Watched My Rate Burn:

**karenthecockpitpilot** (6.5): better but boring lyrics, not catchy song :/ sad :/

**CanadianSkeleton** (6): Good but a little generic for a Billie song

**thatgreekguyraul** (6): Pop ballads are difficult to pull off. It was not horrible by any means but it can feel mundane at times.

**shineflyer** (5.5): has good things. but it overall doesn't have much to catch my attention.

**JohnnyToby** (5): also all the songs feel and sound the same....

**Bendariaku89** (2.5): I don‚Äôt really like the song‚Äôs production and the whole thing doesn‚Äôt feel right.

###People With A Great Taste:

**10footnotes** (10): I saw someone on popheads comment that this song has a chorus that makes you want to scream along, and it's true. It's almost impossible to resist pumping your fists and yelling DO YOU NEED ME, TO SPELL IT OUT LOUD as soon as the chorus comes on.

**chipsi1** (10): plot twist: the second ep i am going to release won't be close to the level of this one!

**Leixander** (10): SHOTS FIYAAAD

**Me-Luigi** (10): SHOTS FIRED

**mudkip1owo** (10): another bop

**rickikardashian** (10): Everytime I listen to this I imagine it in a huge festival jumping and having fun. Then I get sad because im miserable and poor.

**Shipsinker22** (10): This was the very first song from Sigrid i listened to. It was such a summer banger(z) and i am so grateful for introducing me to one of my favorite artists. also it fuckin bumps

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this punched me in the fucking face with its boppage when i first heard it. her best song arrived don't @ me strangers stans

**whatareblackhole** (10): This fucking song‚Ä¶I screamed the first time I heard this shit. This is SO GOOD and so weird and nothing belongs in the song but everything does and the single art has a scarf moment!!! I‚Äôm obsessed with this song.

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): SHOTS FIRED

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9.5): I can never not yell SHOTS FIRED along to this song

**bbfan132** (9.2): Random, but I love how she calls the guy "bro" and uses other "modern" terms to describe her breakup and her no-good boyfriend. The bridge is a bit odd, but everything else is glorious.

**cucumberanti** (9): the buildup in the production after the bridge oh my god

**twat\_brained** (8): The vocal splices take away from the song for me but it's still a fun and cathartic song to scream the lyrics to.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): Plot Twist, this song goes out earlier than anyone expects

**CanadianSkeleton** (7): I‚Äôm searching for a joke to make about 'the real plot twist'

**kappyko** (7): Her saying "wannabeh" and "wannaBEEEEEEeeEEEEEEeEEEE" turned me off but this is fun generic boppery

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Yeah, this is a little too similar to Don't Kill My Vibe...not necessarily melodically, just in the structure and tone. It's Sigrid snarling into the microphone over an energetic production style yet again. I actually like the way she basically teases the person the song's addressed to on the chorus, but it's an inferior version of the title track in all measures.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): I do like this song. Except for the shrill "shots fired". That really brings down this song. If it wasn't for that, this song could easily compete with Don't Kill My Vibe to be the best song in the rate.

**thatgreekguyraul** (7): This reminds of Zara Larsson‚Äôs ‚ÄúTG4M‚Äù, which I like a lot as well.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This song has a really great chorus, but it‚Äôs almost *too* busy, to a point where it‚Äôs just really hard to hear what‚Äôs going on, and it works well in bursts on this song but can get a bit exhausting at the end.

###HYPEBROS:

**shineflyer** (6.5): like a wannabeh

**gannade** (3): it manages to be both generic and overproduced, overall a mess

**awhile2** (2): who the fuck still says shots fired

**Bendariaku89** (2): I don‚Äôt like the song. it‚Äôs production is fine, but the whole song in general just feels bland at least for me anyway.

**SkyBlade79** (1): WHY IS SHE YELLING AT ME also any song that says ‚Äúhype, bro‚Äù is pretty horrible

**ryanyu10** (0): I was so ready to like this song, but that pre-chorus made me cringe so hard, and then the rest of the song devolved into some petty hatred that just left a bad taste in my mouth. It‚Äôs somewhere between Bad Blood and Swish Swish (MV version) in quality and tone, and I honestly expected better. Only song in this whole rate that I outright disliked.

**strawberryswing1** (0): i'm sorry u/berober04
