###People Who Don't Wanna Think:

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i can tell this is the song Julia was talking about when she casually mentioned she was still working on the EP even at the last minute. It feels different, but the lyrics are so fucking personal and at some points, especially the ‚Äúwaking up with texts to your lover but you make up an excuse that it was meant for someone else‚Äù is so me. Tbh I‚Äôd probably feel the same way if I broke up with [someone this cute]( https://instagram.com/p/BaP2wmRh4c7/)

**Me-Luigi** (9): queen of producing, writing and singing this one, grimes shook

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Fortunately, even if Pink happened to be a misstep, Julia saved the best for last. Worst In Me gets more attention than this closing track, for some reason, but this combines the best lyricism on the album (in this digital age, the last few lines are relatable and heart-wrenching) with a somber melody. Strangely enough, despite the fact that this song has a relatively high range, Julia still pulls it off well. It would have been fan favourite if she gave it to some other singer, but she didn't, and I'm honestly thankful for that decision.

**kappyko** (8.5): dont wanna think about how good this ep is

**Leixander** (7.5): all piano ballads gets a bonus point from me

**bbfan132** (6.8): It's not bad, but it's not *that* good. I know that Julia could've written a better ballad than this, but it's not like the song is awful.

**twat\_brained** (6.7): I propose a new rule in music: do NOT write music in the key of F major chord on a piano unless your name is Harold Edward Styles.

**cucumberanti** (6.5): the way she sings like she‚Äôs about to burst into tears any second = relatable

**shineflyer** (6.5): a fine ballad. not incredible, but perfectly respectable.

###People Who Wanna Think:

**ryanyu10** (6.3): So this just bores me. Filler 2?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): A bit boring for a closer imo

**CanadianSkeleton** (5.5): If you don‚Äôt stop it right now with this I‚Äôm-fucked-up narrative I quit

**RandomHypnotica** (5): "now I'm not really one for drinking songs" yup, it shows honey.

**Shipsinker22** (5): it's a fine ballad but I mean I didn't feel anything from it

**karenthecockpitpilot** (4.5): hate the fake crying ew gross

**JohnnyToby** (4): The first chord got me ready for that one harry styles "song"

**thatgreekguyraul** (4): Her vocals are so bad. I could not get through this without shrugging so much.

**Bendariaku89** (3): It‚Äôs boring, but not extremely boring.

**chipsi1** (3): baby i thought you were cool :3 but you played me :O

**CarlieScion** (2): the de-facto closer cuz its slow

**cyborglilith** (2): her voice sounds horrible

**ImADudeDuh** (0): this is the most fucking melodramatic song I have ever heard. The second verse is fucking terrible. "Now I'm not really one for drinking songs/But, fuck it here it comes, uh/Heartbreak is annoying/And I feel it in the morning" I dont want anyone to complain about halsey's edginess and melodrama ever again when this is a fucking verse in a song from someone some people are calling one of the best songwriters in pop right now.

###Nike Fans:


**kappyko** (10): What the fuck this bops way more than I remembered

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a chill bop

**henry413** (8): The chorus is a surprise!

**Raykel** (7.5): Why do imagine this in the background of a Kohl's underwear commercial and where do I audition?

**bbfan132** (7): The prechorus and chorus save this song. The verses were... not that good.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): A decent song, and, again, Julia's vocals aren't nearly as painful in here as they could be early on in the EP. The dissonance between the lyrics and the relatively upbeat chorus is also quite interesting. Still, it's not as sonically captivating as the rest of the EP, even if it is better than some other songs on it.

**Yatcho** (6.5): Indistinguishable from the last song in my memory

###Adidas Fans:

**thatgreekguyraul** (6): Perhaps the most tolerable song on the EP.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): A bit boring until the chorus hits, but it‚Äôs nice. Some of Julia‚Äôs vocals on here are awkward, but as a whole it‚Äôs pretty nice.

**twat\_brained** (6): https://bit.ly/2MotuoT

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.5): where were you when julia michaels invented Nike

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5.5): nike nike treat employees just like slaaaaves

**JohnnyToby** (5): makes me mad bc it reminds of Regina Spektor and Regina doesn't deserve this

**shineflyer** (4.5): she had an idea, and decided to just keep trying that idea multiple times in one song

**ryanyu10** (3.3): This song legitimately just disappoints me. Filler?

**Kaylaboe** (2): i‚Äôd jump off a cliff because of this song

**SkyBlade79** (2): this is the most white bread thing I‚Äôve heard all night and I‚Äôm a countryhead (jk don‚Äôt ban me)

###WIG IN ORBIT:

**cyborglilith** (10): I KNOW THIS WILL GO OUT EARLY BECAUSE IT‚ÄôS A BALLAD, BUT IT‚ÄôS ACTUALLY THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): floaty, but the good kind. makes me wanna cry in my sleep and feel all of it in my bones and mind. it‚Äôs in otherworldly.

**chipsi1** (9): i enjoyed this a lot

**shineflyer** (8): did rebecca just outdo lana

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): can you believe Rebecca Black just did a billie eyelash song better than billie eyelash

**bbfan132** (6.8): The soft vocals and the understated production work well with the lyrics of the song, but it's overly repetitive.

**ryanyu10** (6.8): Her lyrics could have some improvement, but I like the feel of this song.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6.5): Probably the best song on here, if not just for being the most sonically interesting. It feels like something that would be on a movie soundtrack with the slow and kinda cinematic production and moody lyrics.

**Yatcho** (6.5): The least generic song on here but still a bore

###WIG INTACT:

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): this was the only forgettable song on this EP

**Shipsinker22** (6): okay a bit bored but rebecca still going strong

**thatgreekguyraul** (6): Meh.

**twat\_brained** (5.8): But I never want to cry-y-y-yyyy. Maybe I will if I listen to this too many times

**kappyko** (5): It's pleasant?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Inoffensive but not terribly interesting at all. Nothing much else to say.

**CarlieScion** (2): rebecca doesnt have the voice to carry an emotional ballad

**johnazoidberg-** (2): THis is more boring than listening tio your dad explain Downton Abbey

**awhile2** (0): i hate to waste my zero on a song thats just offensively bland rather than something thats actively bad but jesus this song is such a snooze fest. I know fuck all about sound mixing but i swear to god this song is mixed horribly, i think theres some obvious clipping on some of the pre-chorus ‚Äúoohs‚Äù that just sound like complete trash, you think ya girl could use some of that friday moeny to pay some producers who know what the fuck theyre doing but apparently not. Also what this whole satellite/seeing someones dark side metaphor is trash af rebecca stop.

**patronsaintofaspies** (0): For a ballad, this is very lowkey about everything. The production, the melody, Rebecca's singing-it does resemble a satellite, actually. Too far away for its own good. It's also very hard to remember anything else about it other than 'I wanna see you cryyy'

**RandomHypnotica** (0): uggggghhhh this song is so painfully generic, listening to it was the longest 3 and a half minutes of my life.

---

###Ran Away:


**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): bitch I thought this was Lana at first

**rotating3Dtext** (10): love this mood. also, can relate, being from a small city

**ryanyu10** (8.6): Solid song here as well. Add a ‚Äúwith me‚Äù to the end to make this an 11.

**twat\_brained** (8.4): Is this a Banks cut? Definitely sounds like it.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Some regular instrumentals after the rest of the album is a little weird, even if the similar production is still here, but M√ò manages to pull the concept off well and prevent the song from sounding like a typical closing ballad at the end. The outro is also very touching-I actually feel like it has a magical vibe of sorts to it.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): Kind of a sweet little guitar ballad to finish the EP. A pretty good change of pace from the poppier stuff.

**bbfan132** (7.3): I like the western sound and the theme of running away, which fit well together. The overall song is boring, but that connection makes it better than the other songs on the EP.

**Me-Luigi** (7): she has better ballads, new years eve outsold

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A slow but endearing closer

###Lazy People:

**Bendariaku89** (6): compared to the four songs before it in the album, it just gets a seven.

**JohnnyToby** (5): I didn't realize this was gonna be an indieheads rate lmao

**shineflyer** (5): ...pelican?

**SkyBlade79** (5): whatta totally forgettable bop

**thatgreekguyraul** (5): Ballads don‚Äôt really work with M√ò. Her vocals really excel with electronic pulsations.

**CanadianSkeleton** (4): Alright danish cowgirl calm down

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3.5): kinda what i want to do

**johnazoidberg-** (2): I'm 12 years old and what is this

**Shipsinker22** (2): i guess i just dislike her dark schtick?

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): carly's wig is firmly in place

###Wasted:

**rickikardashian** (11): Uh Huh but better. I know the line ‚ÄúIf I could have it all back, I'd waste it again‚Äù has been done before on different ways, but I like how it contrasts with the verses and chorus of the song, since they make the song seem about regret. Also I know this will get to day 2 with enough luck, and yes, i truly am wasting my 11 in Rebecca Black

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): damn those guitars

**Shipsinker22** (9): i guess.... I stan?

**Bendariaku89** (8.7): love the chorus and guitar. the vocals should feel wrong, but it works for the song.

**cyborglilith** (8.5): THE AUTOTUNE SOUNDS HORRIBLE BUT I STILL LIKE THE SONG

**lexarqade** (8): Didn't we already hear this song in the rate? Oh wait, that's Uh-Huh.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): can you believe Rebecca Black just did a Julia Michaels song better than Julia Michaels

**Banananaise** (7): i stg if you dingbats let rebecca fucking BLACK (queen of 2013) flop in this rate... this is a cute song do not rate it low

**bbfan132** (6.8): The production is a bit too loud, and Rebecca doesn't really sound like she's feeling the lyrics, but it's certainly not bad.

**twat\_brained** (6.6): This one feels uninspired and makes me feel like I'm listening to the earsore that was Uh Huh.

**shineflyer** (6.5): it's like Uh Huh if it had more power to it and less of... that

**SkyBlade79** (6.5): Kind of a mood. The way that her vocals keep squeaking adds personality but could get annoying really fast. The drum beats really serve to add some much needed impact, actually giving one of her songs some oomph to it, something that she doesn‚Äôt use much. The lyrics definitely work to serve their purpose, though they‚Äôre nothing amazing. Can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôve heard this exact song somewhere else in the rate‚Ä¶

###Sober:

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): this sounds so familiar wtf someone tell me what the guitar is from HOLY SHIT I JUST REALIZED THIS A KNOCK OFF VERSION OF UH HUH. WE ARE RATING THAT

**thatgreekguyraul** (6): Is it just me or does the melody to this song sound a bit similar to Julia Michaels‚Äô ‚ÄúUh Huh‚Äù?

**gannade** (5.5): the beginning was really good but that chorus is heavily overproduced. omg this bass

**cucumberanti** (5): i like it but the chorus drop‚Ä¶. no

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): A quick Google search of this reveals to me that this has similarities to another song in the rate, Uh Huh, and, yeah, I can see what people are talking about when I compare the production style of both songs, but it doesn't seem like anything passes the boundaries of inspiration to me. Even if this is nowhere as unpleasant as Uh Huh, it is kind of boring, though.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.2): this is forever 21 background music

**CarlieScion** (4): the guitar - a 10, her voice - a 2

**JohnnyToby** (4): this is an original song...uh huh

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): Not really liking anything here at all, still not digging her vocals and this beat feels so off-kilt and unfitting.

**awhile2** (3): wait what the fuck isnt this just uh huh but considerably worse?

**BiPolarBear17** (2.5): To no-one's surprise, a cheap knock-off of an already very flawed song provides nothing of value, but pop off I guess Becky.

**ryanyu10** (2.1): There‚Äôs good generic pop, and then there‚Äôs this.

**Kaylaboe** (2): we love a inferior copycat

**PuggleMaster** (1): highkey trash for making a worse version of uh huh

**kappyko** (0): Why

###Rainbow-colored:

**ryanyu10** (11): hOLY CRAP I‚Äôve never heard of this person before but I already LOVE this song. Perfectly quaint, captures the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù feel that it‚Äôs trying to go for, and a lot of substance packed into only a few lyrics.

**kappyko** (10): giving this a generous score because all of you are horrible

**mudkip1owo** (10): i know this is gonna go out early but i legit love this song lol

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): aw this is a cute little opener

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): bon iver who

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): I love the ambient feel of this track. It's almost acapella other than the sounds of nature, and Maggie's vocals give it a nice, calming feeling.

**Bendariaku89** (8): reminds me of a campfire song. all it needs is a fire crackling in the background.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This was actually the song I was the most attracted to when I first listened to this EP, because of the liturgical vibes of the melody and the poetic, meditative lyrics. If I didn't know it better I'd think Maggie was adapting a centuries-old poem to modern-day folk music. Not a very exciting opening, but it's pretty.

**Shipsinker22** (8): i liked it as a mood setter, it probably helps that i like music like this though

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Cute but short opening track, it does a really good job of setting the atmosphere though.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): Cute little campfire bop

**CanadianSkeleton** (7.5): Halsey found in a hotel bathroom shaking her head at shampoo bottles

**Raykel** (7): This is a whole ass experience at 5am while everyone else is sleeping

**thatgreekguyraul** (7): The chirping crickets give this track a nice camp feel. It feels so raw.

**Banananaise** (6.5): i can't help but associate these slow sad campfire songs with blair witch style forest monsters

###Colorless:

**bbfan132** (6.3): Snore. I get the message, and it's a peaceful song, but she could've made something better than *this*.

**CarlieScion** (6): her voice is beautiful but i hate tracks that use diegetic sounds

**cucumberanti** (6): a good intro but nothing much is going on

**RandomHypnotica** (6): Pretty much nothing but a long interlude, but I think it sets the mood really nicely for the album

**rickikardashian** (5.8): This could work as like, a 20 second interlude, or the intro for a music video, not a whole 2 minutes song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.5): i know this is supposed to be artistic and beautiful or whatever but im like falling asleep gdfpjihd

**shineflyer** (4): it's fine, for an intro.

**JohnnyToby** (2): That was...pointless tbh. If you told me Sigrid or billie sang this I would believe you.

**SkyBlade79** (2): her voice is nowhere near good enough for this type of song

**gannade** (1): um okay i know some people like this kinda stuff but i need a little something to go along with this. i like these type of songs in movie because theres visuals but as a solely audio experience... its lacking

**johnazoidberg-** (0): Children singing a nursery rhyme off key in the trailer for a horror movie, but then make it indie

**LiteraturePenguin** (0): The crickets give me flashbacks to a traumatic camping experience

**onceberry** (0): Like I guess her voice is nice but this is so basic and boring that I'm getting angry at it

###Insides:

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): that's pussy babe!

**cyborglilith** (10): DADDY

**henry413** (10): Still thinks she's singing "Daddy loves the color pink"

**kappyko** (10): this is the gentrified "Doves in the Wind"

**letsallpoo** (10): i literally wrote \[an essay](https://redd.it/6yzqvz) about how smart this song is and im not here for the inevitable julia disrespect

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this song is pure genius. Glad it generally got appreciated when this EP was released.

**rickikardashian** (10): *i think there was some innuendo*

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): i have no comment

**Shipsinker22** (10): fuck me up Julia! a contender for my 11 (screw you infernal)

**johnazoidberg-** (9): Got dayum this song is sexy. I could listen to Julia whisper in my ear all damn day. It doesn't even have to be sexual. Have her whisper in my ear about my dad's kidney or who my brother is picking as his best man over me, it'll still turn me the hell on

**shineflyer** (9): this song has that same fun as Uh Huh, but figured out how not to also make it annoying. whisper parts are always great

**karenthecockpitpilot** (8.8): bridge 10/10

**Banananaise** (8.5): what a fucking SCANDAL

**ryanyu10** (8.5): I have a weird thing for anti-choruses.

**bbfan132** (8.3): I can see why other people hate this, but I find it super cute, and love the innuendoes (or lack of...). Also, read letsallpoo's post on this song!

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Daddy pink wig!

**JohnnyToby** (8): kinda cheeky

**RandomHypnotica** (8): Janelle who?

**strawberryswing1** (8): kinda hot

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This should‚Äôve been wayyyyy bigger, everything from the wild whispering to the heavy bass just makes this feel like one of the coolest tracks in this rate.

**Yatcho** (8): Girl... What?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.5): janelle and grimes kinda shook? maybe? probably not but maybe?

**theburningundead** (7.5): the whispering in this song activates my fight or flight response

**lexarqade** (7): Janelle Monae remains unbothered.

**Mysario** (7): the whispering makes me uncomfortable, especially when I'm alone in my room listening to this at 11 pm

**CanadianSkeleton** (6.5): ASMR Darling who?

###Outsides:

**cucumberanti** (6): selena‚Äôs asmr career dead in a ditch

**Leixander** (6): keep an eye out for selener

**Raykel** (6): adfhskidihjdhdjd her "awh" lmaofsbsjjd is that how she sounds when cumgsydudhdudi im ded :/

**rotating3Dtext** (5.5): vagina?

**SkyBlade79** (5.5): ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no innuendos‚Äù proceeds to make an entire song totally filled with innuendos

**hikkaru** (5): when people called Julia a ‚Äúwhisper queen‚Äù, I didn‚Äôt think it was quite so literal‚Ä¶

**tf2manu994** (5): fourth wall lets go

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Oh, dear. This is one of the only songs on the EP that I can't find a reason to like. There's interesting production scattered around this track, but none of it is gripping enough for me to be generous with my scoring. And if you thought Lorde's whispering in Homemade Dynamite was annoying, the way Julia delivers the spoken chorus here is downright unpleasant! I'm not even sure what the lyrics are supposed to be implying. Is Julia's boyfriend secretly gay? Is he feminine but straight? Is he just trying to impress her. I don't know. This is a failed attempt at creating an experimental dance track, and I wouldn't be surprised if this one's controversy score ends up being the highest. Ugh.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): Is this supposed to be sexy?

**thatgreekguyraul** (3): Her vocals are incredibly weak in this song. Lyrics are not that great either. Whisperlia.

**Kaylaboe** (2): if i wanted to listen to asmr, i‚Äôd burn my ears

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (2): The whispering gives me whatever the opposite of asmr is

**twat\_brained** (2): I know Julia has written lots of Selena songs but I don't think this is what everyone has in mind when they talk about "whisper singing". Also this is tragic lol

**Bendariaku89** (0): I thought of giving this a one, but then I look at the chorus.

**BiPolarBear17** (0): I'd take listening to the entirety of Beautiful Trauma over anymore listens of this. We stan a superior (by default) P!nk!

**static\_int\_husp** (0): Whispering the chorus is not how to sell me on a song. Also, the *entire* song is innuendo, don't say there isn't any!

**TragicKingdom1** (0): just...confusing? i get that it's trying to be quirky but it's not funny, just odd

###The Azaelia Banks':

**JohnnyToby** (10): finAlly a good song wow the production is amazing. There is never a boring moment.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i didn‚Äôt get the hype for this initially and thought it was some basic-ass love song. I was sooo wrong

**Mysario** (10): this had every right to hit the charts, it's such a well-produced tune

**rickikardashian** (10): real hot take: this deserved SOTY. That's all. I'll ban myself from the sub.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): it‚Äôs good

**shineflyer** (9): i love pizzicato strings, i love the backup harmonies towards the end, and i like this song k? there's a lot of subtle things idk

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I really didn‚Äôt like Julia Michaels until I had a chance to see her live - this song felt really bland when I heard it on the radio, but it‚Äôs obvious now the way the track weaves around Michaels‚Äô singing quirks works quite well, and the chorus is a complete grower. I got issues, and one of them is how much I like this song.

**ryanyu10** (8.9): It grew on me, but the bridge is still a no for me.

**bbfan132** (8.5): This is cute. She needs to work on enunciation though, because I thought she was saying that she "would touch you too" at first...

**Me-Luigi** (8.3): this had radio shook

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): One of the weirder hit songs in recent times, and it's hard to appreciate it for what it is upon your first few listens due to the somewhat questionable vocals. Even with these issues in mind, however, I do like the way Julia blends what would be a regular pop song otherwise with playful, enticing production choices. At the end, I ended up liking this a lot, but I can see why people would have the opposite opinion.

**Raykel** (7.8): I know her voice cracks but fun fact about me: I listen to yodel unironically so I'm in love with voice cracks.

**chipsi1** (7.5): hm

**kappyko** (7): My niece sings along to this song she's like 2 years old and I can't disagree with my niece

**Shipsinker22** (7): gosh I hated this song the first time I heard it. it grew on me a little since it's not gonna be a one but I mean I'm still not the biggest fan

**TragicKingdom1** (7): used to like this one a lot more. i like its slight quirkiness but i wish it went off more

**10footnotes** (6.5): I'm lowkey going to plug the [Pentatonix cover of this song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iwaMbsjw8bg) (that's right, come at me). The original song is good, and it can be hard to eclipse an original when you cover it. However, I do like how the PTX cover sounds... crisper? cleaner? compared to the original (especially in the last chorus), and also how the cover has more soft/loud dynamics. Plus, Kirstie sounds great in the cover. Her voice is beautiful, and she's great at expressing emotion.

###The Sias:

**rotating3Dtext** (6.2): sorry but I was like 'wtf is this' the first time I heard this on the radio. the avocado voice is strong here.

**cucumberanti** (6): i like it but it‚Äôs missing something

**gannade** (6): bananies and avocadies

**Leixander** (6): never understood how this became a hit

**RandomHypnotica** (6): I got issues with the bass levels in this song

**SkyBlade79** (4): this has SO much potential but it just sounds like a buildup to absolutely nothing

**CanadianSkeleton** (3): I‚ÄôM SO FUCKED UP BUT I LOVE YOU

**hikkaru** (2): So this is really what's propelled one of our new pop girls up to relevance as a solo artist? Sorry, this isn't Sober II, the strings and booming trap production here are just awful together.

**Bendariaku89** (1): the vocals feel really off, it takes the song really down for me.

**thatgreekguyraul** (0): No. Just no. This song attempts to justify harmful relationships.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (0): I didn't like this song when it was a hit, and it hasn't grown on me. I think it's mostly the irritating melody. The whole 'I'll give my issues to you' feels straight off Hot Topic merch from 2012.

**twat\_brained** (0): Yeah, I got issues. And one of them is how damaging Julia's vocals are to my eardrums.

###Kidnapped people:

**Bendariaku89** (10): amazing. it‚Äôs not the big slutbop but more of the song that makes you drift into a different place. that won‚Äôt fit with everybody, but this is the kind of song I‚Äôd repeat a lot.

**SkyBlade79** (9.5): like the previous song, Finneas supplies backup vocals. However, this time, he sings on almost every line, making this song almost sound like a duet. It's a very slow-burning, downtempo track. That familiar bass kicks in later, but unlike the other songs, it simply supplements the sparse acoustic production, instead of working as it's own entity. The production is vivid and mature, with lines like this: "Let me crawl, inside your veins / I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain". This song is great to just close your eyes and listen to at the end of the night; it's so atmospheric, but I can't see myself just wanting to listen to it whenever, like a lot of Billie's other works.

**ryanyu10** (9.1): It‚Äôs almost hypnotic.

**shineflyer** (9): i enjoy songs that sound like a ghost town

**CanadianSkeleton** (8.5): The lyrics are great and it‚Äòs the perfect song for when you‚Äôre obsessed with someone

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): yas brother eilish on the backing vocals

**Shipsinker22** (8.5): s i s

**twat\_brained** (8.1): Who knew acoustic music could sound so dark? I'm impressed.

**bbfan132** (8): another dreamy song about love, and i'm not mad at all. for a 15 (now 16) year old, her lyrics are very mature and intelligent, and i love it.

**thatgreekguyraul** (8): Excellent production. The slow throbbing synths make this song feel much more interesting. The acoustic guitar is a nice touch. There is just something that I wish was more present.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A fitting and downer closer, Billie muses over uncontrollable love with a scary but understandable metaphor. A solid track.

###People with awful opinions yes /u/kappyko wtf why would you you gave better scores to Julia

**kappyko** (6.5): idgaf abt this one sorry

**CarlieScion** (6): an okay closer i guess

**cucumberanti** (6): impressed by how she managed to make the same song 3 times

**lexarqade** (6): Kind of boring for my taste.

**JohnnyToby** (5): forgettable like most of this eP

**karenthecockpitpilot** (4.5): hm?

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): For a song with a title like hostage, it's very unexciting and non-suspenseful. There are some lyrics here that are actually kind of adorable, but, eh, I don't think there's anything to lose by leaving this off the EP. It's somewhat boring, and the last thing a musician like Billie wants to be is boring.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): dull

**gannade** (1): dreadful

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): release me please

###Uh:


**johnazoidberg-** (11): This was my song of 2017. There are no words to describe how much I love these three minutes of perfection, other than wishing they could last for more.

**awhile2** (10): where is my mind

**CarlieScion** (10): UH HUH UH HUH

**chipsi1** (10): screeching into a microphone is charli's shtick, also if you wanted to copy something from charli you could've picked to copy the ability to produce more than 2 good songs per project

**cyborglilith** (10): I think I‚Äôm movin‚Äô in too CLOSE

**kappyko** (10): This is great and everybody that dislikes it is trash. It brings back memories of Ingrid Michaelson c. "Girls Chase Boys", memories of Lily Allen, memories of MIKA, memories of a lot of quirky songwriter pop that was popular in the 2000s. It's a song in touch with its influences.

**Kaylaboe** (10): ha goat

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I don‚Äôt understand that there are people who dislike this. r u deaf

**ryanyu10** (10): Like c‚Äômon, this is a perfect pop song. The chorus is unconventional and that‚Äôs what makes it so catchy. Almost an 11.

**selegend** (10): this is an artistic masterpiece not meant to be understood by everyone

**karenthecockpitpilot** (9.7): i feel like the ending could be a bit better -0.3 very unique take on trendy pop tropes

**Shipsinker22** (9.5): this is such a fucking jam but there's SOMETHING holding it back from a ten, and I think it's the lyrics

**henry413** (9): The piano at the bridge is cute af.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): a little cringy but it‚Äôs good

**bbfan132** (8.8): I love the chorus! No wonder why this is one of her most popular songs; it sounds made for the radio.

**10footnotes** (8.5): Julia's said that she wrote this (and Issues) in about 30 minutes. It really is impressive how good a sense she has for the rhythm/melody/flow of a song.  This is such a smooth, easy bop that even fits the squeakier parts of her voice well.

**JohnnyToby** (7.5): tbh wtf are those piano notes in the second verse....

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): This is the perfect of example of Julia's voice getting in the way of her songwriting skills. Everything in the chrous sounds so strained and miserable and awful, but it's still catchy so it's ok.

**SkyBlade79** (6.5): Kind of a mood. The way that her vocals keep squeaking adds personality but could get annoying really fast. The drum beats really serve to add some much needed impact, actually giving one of her songs some oomph to it, something that she doesn‚Äôt use much. The lyrics definitely work to serve their purpose, though they‚Äôre nothing amazing. Can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôve heard this exact song somewhere else in the rate‚Ä¶

###Huh:

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Very conflicted on what to give this. The way the song is structured is really fun and if you'd give it to a good punk singer, the results would be pretty great. Therefore, I honestly think that Julia claiming this for herself is a real damn shame. I wouldn't skip it, but it does cross a line between being attractively edgy and being abrasive.

**shineflyer** (6): this song is hilarious. it's like she made an entire chorus out of the last line of the pre-chorus in Kill V. Maim. NOT a song you want to hear too much. but it's really fun, like, once a month

**static\_int\_husp** (5.5): What is it with this rate and ok songs having annoying choruses song. While this song also has the stilted instrumentals of the rest of this EP, the voice used for the chorus is sooooo anoying.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5.5): The verses on here are fine, but I just do not like the hook at all. The 'uh huh's feel lifted out of another song entirely.

**Bendariaku89** (4): oof, this song‚Äôs chorus and hook feel weird and artificial. the verses are really nice though.

**CanadianSkeleton** (4): The cringe is real

**Leixander** (4): annoying sadly

**lexarqade** (4): Something about this song is just so grating on my ears and makes it almost unlistenable.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): This has serious potential to be a bop but the chorus sounds like a styrofoam orgy

**twat\_brained** (4): The music is pretty good but I want to shoot whoever thought Julia Michaels should have a singing career.

**Yatcho** (4): Why is she singing like that? Exblain, Julia Michaels exblain!!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): nuh-uh

**ImADudeDuh** (1): this is one of the most irritating songs of 2017 and I was 100% ready to give this my 0 until i heard the rest of the EP

**thatgreekguyraul** (1): When I first heard this, I thought it was a parody song. I still think it is. Her enunciation of Uh-Huh was so intentionally sexual and I hate her for doing that. Awful production.

**Elitefourbrad** (0): The way she sings this makes me not want to have ears anymore.

**EpicFreakingLlama9** (0): God why is this so fucking awful

**hikkaru** (0): This instrumentation is really obnoxious. Somehow the hook is even more obnoxious.

**InfernalSolstice** (0): this song makes me incredibly uncomfortable and honestly the first time i heard this is probably the most uncomfortable a song has ever made me feel, and repeat listens did not improve this

**KittyKate10778** (0): can't stand the chorus kills the song

###The worst:

**shineflyer** (10): i don't really know how to explain why i like this one. it's really good piano chords, i guess is what it comes down to. and i like the lyrics a lot.

**Shipsinker22** (10): I'm a fan

**kappyko** (9): nice balladry

**lexarqade** (9): Now this is a bop.

**Leixander** (8.5): easily the best in this EP

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8.5): ok this kinda ruined the flow that ‚ÄúUh Huh‚Äù started. Not necessarily a bad song, though.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I didn't expect the most loved song from this EP to lean a little on the ballad side, but this definitely ends up working quite well. It's the first song on this record that gives you an idea of Julia's above average lyrical technique and it's not nearly as off-putting as the previous tracks upon first listen.

**rickikardashian** (8): ‚ÄúIssues‚Äù, but more specific and not as good

**ryanyu10** (7.7): Sounds a bit generic, but it‚Äôs still really solid.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A safe but cute bop

**TragicKingdom1** (7): i feel like a Kygo remix of this would work really well but it's pretty empty as-is. still the best on the EP tho!

**twat\_brained** (7): This one is a definite improvement compared to the previous songs

**bbfan132** (6.5): The title is fitting.... I didn't know that Julia was a 16 year old girl in her first relationship.

###The best:

**CanadianSkeleton** (5): I‚ÄôM STILL FUCKED UP AND STILL LOVE YOU

**chipsi1** (5): baby i'm crazy xD but i love you <3

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): mean opinion but her vocals are bad here

**SkyBlade79** (5): Like many julia michaels songs, this just doesn‚Äôt really reach any sort of peak

**Bendariaku89** (4.5): it‚Äôs not bad, but nothing special really pops up in the song. it‚Äôs just there.

**JohnnyToby** (4): Meh

**thatgreekguyraul** (3): The title speaks for itself.
