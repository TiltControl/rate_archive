amumumyspiritanimal: # #15: ocean eyes
---

shameless robbery is a perfect way to start off the rate's final day

---

**Highlighted comment by u/twat\_brained :** If I were asked to describe ethereality in a song, I'd just play them "Ocean Eyes" by Billie. It never fails to make me feel like I'm blissfully floating on a cloud that's coating a small town with rain. I hope this isn't Billie's greatest song ever since she was only 14 when it came out but she definitely has a case for it to be considered as such.

---

###Ocean eyes:

**cyborglilith** (11): This song is so good that it managed to overcome my Rebecca bias.

**chipsi1** (10): :genericsad:

**kappyko** (10): Really beautifully atmospheric and a lot more subtle, but it's not the 11 contender I once thought it was.

**Kaylaboe** (10): i remember listening to this for the first time a year ago and finding out that she was barely 15yo. i didn’t know they let people that young be pirates

**Raykel** (10): Her voice... I can hear god

**SkyBlade79** (10): Billie’s first big single. It was released in 2015, when Billie was only 13, but you can't tell that at all. Her voice is wonderfully mature, smooth and versatile throughout this song. The chorus is euphoric, and the imagery is some of the most vivid that I've ever heard. I've loved this song for over a year now, and it was what made me start following Billie's music in the first place. Production-wise, "ocean eyes" is very chill, but that is changed with the more popular Astronomyy Remix, which I actually prefer, and I barely ever prefer remixes. I also really love how this song has Finneas on background vocals; his voice is actually quite nice, and they work well together.

**whatareblackhole** (10): This song is really pretty! I love the contrast between this and “watch,” especially in the elements that are discussed in the lyrics.

**bbfan132** (9): the lyrics fit perfectly with the dreamy vibe of the song. also, obligatory "billie's voice is beautiful" comment.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Definitely one of the best songs possible for Billie's surge in popularity to emerge from, and it's sure to be a nostalgic Tumblr track for former teenagers in six or seven years' time. The best thing about this song is that it does remind you of the ocean, even if you've never been to the ocean because you're terrified of octopuses grabbing your leg and dragging you down to a secret mermaid kingdom.

**shineflyer** (9): the right production can do a LOT for a song.

**thatgreekguyraul** (9): This is what I would call a modern smooth R&B ballad. Its’ tones feel so warm and soothing. The faint screeching sounds are just perfect. I love the metaphor of ocean eyes that symbolize tears.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): this is the least tryhard track and coincidentally the best

**Mysario** (8.5): you would not believe your eyes if 54 million Ocean Eyes lit up Spotify as you fell asleep

**Shipsinker22** (8.5): I like the production and it's little quirks but it sounds like a sequel to bellyache almost which I didn't like

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This is a fan favorite but it’s never been one of my favorites on the EP. However, it’s a gorgeous track, and it just feels really watery.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Love the long notes she hits on this track. It has this really pretty effect.

**henry413** (7.7): an organic viral hit (according to genius)

**ryanyu10** (7.7): It’s a good song, but I’m not getting into it as some of the other ones.

**cucumberanti** (7): who hurt you billie

**Yatcho** (7): This is very cute

**JohnnyToby** (6.7): ok but the plant girl can sing.

###Turn around, bright eyes:

**karenthecockpitpilot** (6.5): i think her music is boring if she's not being her cringy edgy personality, hope she finds a balance. still better than a lot of other songwriting out there, impressive at her age :)

**Bendariaku89** (6): it sounds like a dream, but like a dream all I remember is ocean eyes. it sounds better after a few more listens though.

**CarlieScion** (5): STOP SINGING IN HEAD VOICE DAMMIT

**mudkip1owo** (4): idk why i don't like this one so much. it's incredibly jarring listening to it in the context of the ep imo which is probably the worst part

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): she has a nice voice but idk about this

**TragicKingdom1** (4): feels like an unnecessary outro

**cloudbustingmp3** (3.7): this is just dragging on and on at this point

amumumyspiritanimal: # #14: On + Off
---

Kappy gurl omg I can't be perfect obviously it was too late to edit in the + after half the people submitted it smh

---

**Highlighted comment by u/ThatParanoidPenguin:** I wasn’t as much of a fan of this track when it released but I quickly realized that I was just a goddamn idiot. The production here is flawless, a droning soundscape that reinforces the hellish repetition of being “on and off again.” The chorus is just magic, a cathartic release that crashes and rebuilds itself again before it gives itself time to breathe. The bridge is just the pinnacle of building up to an explosive final chorus, and it just feels like falling headfirst into a freshwater lake.

###Talented, incredible, brilliant, showstopping:

**kappyko** (11): Where the fuck did the + go?

**Bendariaku89** (10): best song in the album in my opinion

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): wig on/wig off

**Mysario** (10): i haven't heard this song before this rate but the second this song came on, i instantly fell in love

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): This is the best song on the EP, no doubt about it. It's the most upbeat track Maggie has to offer here and it really pays off. Not only does it have all the good makings of a great indie pop song, but also a memorable chorus that should bring the listener to new heights. The snow from the previous track melts to give us a vision of Maggie sprawling off to the top of a cliff on a warm, summer day.

**ryanyu10** (8.9): I STAN THIS GIRL SO HARD.

**twat\_brained** (8.8): Okay I am living for this song if Maggie can do more music like this I’d listen to her stuff.

**bbfan132** (8.5): She *always* evokes nature in some way in every song (even if this song is about a relationship), which can get annoying, but the song has a very peaceful and calm vibe to it, which makes it bearable. I also like how the production and her lyrics present the message of the song in a subtle yet effective way.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Pretty nice. The small use of guitar helps improve it, too.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): the synths in this serve leaving your car door open

**cucumberanti** (8): i love this song but there’s too much production going on

**whatareblackhole** (8): This song is really cool! I think the lyrics are a little flimsy, but I like the feel of the song.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.5): serving lightswitch realness

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): dang

###I'm Roxxxy Andrews and I'm here to make it clear:

**Shipsinker22** (6): eh not my favorite

**thatgreekguyraul** (6): Not really digging the production on this track.

**CarlieScion** (5): the sounds during the verses makes this hard to listen to

**shineflyer** (5): it's fine, but it's following up Alaska...

**SkyBlade79** (3): somehow doesn’t fit her perceived image at all

amumumyspiritanimal: # #13: Dog Years
---

Talent should've won but whatever Ordinary Superstar is d e f i n i t e l y better than this /s

---
**Highlighted comments by u/whatareblackhole:** I cried at work over this one. This is such a wonderful song. And I just want to include what Maggie said about it on Genius, because it really hit home for me and solidified it as my choice for 11: “Dog Years is about a day I skipped class to stay in bed and make frozen pizza with a boy I loved. Dog Years is about dance parties in the kitchen. Dog Years is about chocolate milk and the Tompkins Square dog park. Dog Years is about a thank you note. Dog Years is about change, about loving and leaving and still loving, about trusting yourself, about trusting the universe, about being a good friend and never having enough time.”

**and u/ThatParanoidPenguin:** This is actually my third most played song on Spotify, and I just kept replaying this track after waiting months for new Maggie Rogers. It’s a garden of sounds, sounding quite a bit like Alaska while never feeling derivative. The chorus is like a gust of wind carrying a flurry of flowers, and the pause after she claims “we will be alright - in the afterlife” feels like a conscious and final release. It’s amazing that playing this song in a pitch-black dingy apartment makes me feel like I’m in wondrous plains, skipping around in a dress (even though I’m a guy). And that bridge, god that outro. The song takes a trip down a beaten path, stopping to glance at resting deer and flowering trees as Maggie layers vocals after vocals, counting in dog years. Truly a masterpiece.

###People:

**cyborglilith** (10): we will be alright in the afterliiiiiiife

**Kaylaboe** (10): 13/10 would listen to again

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): ok wig

**mudkip1owo** (10): this one was sUCH a grower like omg. i was so disappointed when this came out at first because i didn't think it was near as good as Alaska but then i listened to it again like a month later and was instantly obsessed. [my last.fm for this song](https://www.last.fm/user/Mudkip12/library/music/Maggie+Rogers/_/Dog+Years?page=2) is fun to look at cause you can see the exact date where it all clicked for me

**shineflyer** (10): maggie really likes using birdcalls in her music, doesn't she?

**Tedyonce** (10): A beautifully sung song that makes me feel like I'm sitting by a lake.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): The production on this track is gorgeous. It's synthy and moody and a bit ambient, building throughout the song and perfectly underscoring Maggie's fantastic vocal performance. She does a great job at setting a mood.

**kappyko** (9.5): extra .5 for the beautiful bird sampling

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): a nice finding

**ryanyu10** (9.4): The lyricism of this girl.

**bbfan132** (9): I was sick of the nature theme, but I love how she incorporates different parts of nature in the production. Also, I think that her voice has natural healing properties, because I was getting my life from the vocals in this song.

**Leixander** (9): dog days are over, let the dog years begin

**Shipsinker22** (9): my god this was a gd BOP

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): I wish this song wasn't as good so I could give it a 7 just because of its title.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): This just sounds really nice. This whole EP does, honestly.

**CanadianSkeleton** (8): woof woof

**CarlieScion** (8): too long to be a perfect 10 to me

**cucumberanti** (8): her voice is absolutely gorgeous and the production compliments it perfectly

**twat\_brained** (7.8): I’ve listened to this twice now and I’m afraid I don’t remember it too well but it sounds pretty nice and I bet is gonna be really close to the overall rate average.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): rina - afterlife is shaking

###Dogs:

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I kind of feel bad giving this an average score because when I listen to it, I feels quite nice. Unlike the previous song, however, I can't find any particular standout moments, and everything just blends into each other, despite the fact that I can separate the chorus from the rest of the song. I know it's well-composed, but I still have a hard time remembering how it goes.

**thatgreekguyraul** (5): Standard.

**SkyBlade79** (4): this is beyond boring

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): this sounds like the last song

Yes people even though we are gay we all know it equals -50, just like the scores this song should've got etc. etc.

###Math geniuses:

**chipsi1** (10): 10, 20 and 40 are the scores this song deserves

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): queen of counting the count from sesame street is shook

**cucumberanti** (10): an adrenaline rush in song form

**lexarqade** (10): She really snapped on this one.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I just love this song, it's so rare to find someone talking about how anti-depressants aren't just a magic cure-all for mental health, and they can seriously affect the positives in your life as well.

**Yatcho** (10): This song is fucking bonkers in all the best ways. That wild flute thing into the bridge, the creepy vocals in the background of the 10-20-40 hook, the electric guitar it's a song full of highlights

**CanadianSkeleton** (9): Rina basically invented numbers

**rotating3Dtext** (9): the instrumental sounds like a jungle level in a video game?

**whatareblackhole** (9): This song kind of just ends, but it’s supa dupa vibey and good

**JohnnyToby** (8.5): damn she really knows what she wanted to do with this EP.

**kappyko** (8.5): Cute kitschy novelty '80s throwback!

**ryanyu10** (8.2): It’s a good song but I really can’t get into it for some reason?

**thatgreekguyraul** (8): Love the 80s production.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This EP is just a rapid fire display of super catchy tracks, god bless Clarence Clarity.

**twat\_brained** (8): One of the best "driving" songs this side of Vroom Vroom if you ask me.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): = -50

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): One of the harder songs to recall from this EP at first, but now I remember it well. I'm still not sure what the significance of the numbers happens to be, but the track manages to successfully create an enticing and atmospheric song, even if it does screw up with the momentum a little.

**shineflyer** (6): too many numbers

**tf2manu994** (4.1): 02040

amumumyspiritanimal: # #11: Ordinary Superstar
---

I mean...it's a song, I understand that, but one that almost got into the top 10? Nothankyou

---

**Highlighted comment by u/patronsaintofaspies:** What a perfect way to order the album! It captures the EP's sonical and thematical aesthetics almost perfectly, and it's definitely one of the catchiest songs on the record, as well as a great introduction to Rina's voice and artistry in general. This is the first song from her that most people will ever hear, and it definitely lives up to the task of creating hype for her career.

###Ordinaries:

**awhile2** (10): i want to be rina sawayama so bad it hurts

**bbfan132** (10): This is absolutely perfect. The 2000 Max Martin-esque production, her attack on superficial pop stars and internet personalities, and her angelic voice. EVERYTHING is amazing <3

**Mysario** (9.5): the theme song to Lifesize 2 with Tyra Banks

**rickikardashian** (9.2): sis is using the term Superstar quite loosely

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): omg she’s just like ME. This track is a 90s fever dream parody that just goes OFF live my GOD. If you ever have a chance to see her do it immediately, she is a cultural icon.

**10footnotes** (8.5): This is my least favorite of the uptempo songs on RINA. It's a bop, but it's the most generic bop out of the five. Take Me As I Am has sassy lyrics and musical variation between verse, prechorus, and chorus. 10-20-40 is the darker song about mental health. Alterlife has the guitars and key change. CSS has the great buildup from verse to chorus and another key change. In comparison, Ordinary Superstar seems flatter, more generic, and a little less personal. However, it's still a good song, and the last chorus goes hard. Rina just sets a high bar!

**JohnnyToby** (8.5): I feel like this will be the only EP that won't bore me.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): A great combination of Sky Ferreira and Janet Jackson's "Escapade."

**whatareblackhole** (8.5): Rina from the get-go throws you into her retro sound and it’s great. A strong opener.

**Yatcho** (8.5): Doesn't bop as hard as the rest of the album but it's really cute and a pretty cheeky send up of #relatable celebrities

**twat\_brained** (8.4): If by "ordinary" you mean hanging out with you at those bougie ass events on your Instagram stories then FUCK YEAH LET'S BE ORDINARY

**Banananaise** (8): i can just imagine Rina as a huge 90s britney-type pop star opening a concert to this song!

**CarlieScion** (8): boppy

**cucumberanti** (8): the chorus is literally the best thing i’ve ever heard

**mudkip1owo** (8): i don't care too much for how she sings 'ordinary superstar' lol but the song's a bop for sure

**Shipsinker22** (8): i got a little bored but its real good

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): Cute pop rock track, kinda reminds me of something a Disney Channel artist would have dropped in 2010 tbh

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): ordinary song for Rina's standards tbh

**johnazoidberg-** (7): This sounds like an early 2000's pop singer fucked the 80's

**shineflyer** (7): feels like a high-tier early disney channel intro

**thatgreekguyraul** (7): Pretty ordinary.

###Superstars:

**ryanyu10** (6.1): Honest assessment of this song is “ordinary.” Generic, and not particularly impressive.

**Bendariaku89** (5): eh, wasn’t that catching.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): this is.... ordinary hahahahhhahahahhaa

Just barely getting into the top 10, MO still got her best song into the top 10. Although WIWY EP might not be the best in the rate, it's still a very decent one.

**Leixander** (11): one of the best songs of 2017, i love the video

**CarlieScion** (10): omg the production on this is an 11

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Wow this is literally so good. I love this so much, the drop is fucking amazing.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this sounds like it was straight up pulled from a 70’s hit musical or something

**Mysario** (10): when a song build-ups, it usually leads to an explosive chorus. in this case, it comes after the chorus and hits HARD

**twat\_brained** (9.3): Does anyone else think the instrumental on the chorus sounds like a soundtrack for a Donkey Kong game? Is it just me?

**Bendariaku89** (9.2): jazzy and classy, nice.

**Me-Luigi** (9): THAT JAZZ DROP

**rickikardashian** (9): the song is good but for some reason it sounds like it was released like 4 years ago. Back when every song sounded like Im an albatraoz

**Shipsinker22** (9): thissa boppie! for some reason the visual in my head is the carnival season from american horror story.

**SkyBlade79** (9): TBH this has some of the best percussion and production in a long time, but the chorus is weak

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This is super weird but also a bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): A banger that almost feels like a Diplo x MO production. The chorus is as perfect as anything else she’s done, and the drop is a bit left field but definitely welcome.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): The excellent opening track is followed by the very deserving title song, with a swift, fleeting chorus that works despite the fact that the song's production isn't as clean as it should be. One of the most sonically innovative songs about youth I've ever heard.

**whatareblackhole** (8.5): This goes off! I like the lyrics, too. I can’t understand her sometimes, though.

**ryanyu10** (8.3): One of the better songs on the EP – surprised this wasn’t a hit, but the post-chorus part might be why.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): almost a little too carnival-y

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Was that a kazoo? I don't care tbh this song bops, it's lively and fun

**Yatcho** (8): Giving me Focus teas with a great song being let down by a complete non-chorus

**chipsi1** (7.5): kimbryell

**tf2manu994** (7): i was waiting til another good one, also "When I was sean" is what I first heard

**thatgreekguyraul** (7): This is quite unique. It bangs though. The use of what appears to be off-key horns compliments the track well.

**bbfan132** (6.3): I hate the "drop" or whatever the instrumental break between the chorus and the verses is. When she is singing, it's okay, but nothing special.

**JohnnyToby** (6): I wanna like it because it's actually like a song but like I don't like it.

**shineflyer** (5): I really don't feel the hype on this. I feel like there's some things that could be fixed to make it a bit... better.

**awhile2** (3): the only thing whiter than ukulele jams is new jack swing drops

amumumyspiritanimal: # When I Was Young
---

Well R.I.P. to this amazing EP, y'all are backstabbers for doing this to MO/ after her AMA smh

---

**Overall average**: 6.938

---

**TragicKingdom1**: This is a charming slice of electropop. I won't say it's perfectly crafted, because there are points where it drags, but the high points are pretty high. I don't think any pop fan would find this boring at all. [Grade: A-]

**Bendariaku89**: the first song had really put me down, because I hated the sound. even now, I can’t like it’s sound and vocals. the next four songs truly changed my opinion of the EP especially Linking With You and BB. TMHTS and WIWS led into these two beautiful songs that really shook me. Almost gave my 11 to Linking With You (and hostage) but ultimately gave it to Bb. Run Away isn’t a good, but that quadruplet of songs is so good.

**Krugo1**: Aside from her features on Major Lazer’s hits “Lean On” and “Cold Water”, I was unfamiliar with her work. I was blown away by the title track but then unfortunately underwhelmed by a majority of the other tracks

**shineflyer**: i really don't feel this one as much as the others in the rate.

**RandomHypnotica**: I think MO's better at making bops and dance-able songs, and she should stick to it.

**thatgreekguyraul**: I was hoping MO would impress with this EP, given how much I loved “Final Song”. Unfortunately, it underwhelmed me but it did have some decent tracks. Hopefully her full-length record is much better. I know she is a critic’s darling.

**Mysario**: this EP feels all over the place, which isn't necessarily a bad thing as I enjoyed it, but it does hurt it a bit

**cyborglilith**: Unique sound.

**Leixander**: a nice surprise from MO, i love this EP as a whole but individually the songs are not in the same quality

**Yatcho**: No Mythologies and her loose singles since were bop after bop after bop, after all that I can't believe she churned out such a boring project as this

**karenthecockpitpilot**: beauuutiifuuulll production but too cool for me! Gets a bit repetitive though tbh thus the score drops

**patronsaintofaspies**: I expected this to be one of the more experimental EPs here, and I was right. This does sound abrasive, but not abrasive enough for the songs to sound terrible to most listeners-in fact, the harshness of the production and MO's vocal delivery comes off as more attractive than not. I can see why it'd be a tiny bit divisive, but I don't know if anybody could call it bad.

**Elitefourbrad**: This was really weak except for the titled track.

**twat\_brained**: MO is never gonna touch Adele but let’s see how well her attempt is at trying

**whatareblackhole**: MO’s features on Charli’s mixtapes made me excited to hear her solo material, but I’m kind of disappointed. Her features made her seem much more interesting and adventurous in her sound. Unfortunately, a lot of this EP sounds really similar and doesn’t really move past some pretty generic ideas. This EP was fine; it wasn’t Julia-level bad, but it never reached the upper echelon of Maggie/Sigrid for me.

amumumyspiritanimal: # #9: COPYCAT
---
Our first song in the 8+ averages, COPYCAT is the perfect album opener for a slightly edgy but still perfect EP. Ugh, her mind

---

**Highlighted comment by u/patronsaintofaspies:** This is the better version of Castle. I'm sorry, Halsey fans, but it's true. Castle was already a kind of decent song, to be fair, and I don't know why teenage edginess ended up making a more enjoyable clone of it, but it did and there's nothing I can do about it. The music itself is dark and atmospheric and reminiscent of a Tim Burton movie, and even though some of the lyrics are cringey, for some reason they end up giving the song more flavour. It's a paradox that I can't wrap my finger around.

###Not everyone who is angry and young and female is Melanie Martinez, y'all, also poo wtf:

**SendMeYourSATScores** (11): who the fuck is billie eilish and why is this good

**cyborglilith** (10): a more effective slutdrop anthem than partition

**lexarqade** (10): I just got new speakers with an amazing bass system and they are SHOOK at this song.

**mudkip1owo** (10): SUCH A SONG those lyrics hnng fuck me up

**Raykel** (10): Off topic but kinda relatedish; I had a childhood friend who couldn't grasp the phrase "I was just kidding" and instead would always say "I was just sikeing" and now that's all I ever think about when anyone says sike. I really like this song.

**SkyBlade79** (10): COPYCAT is a beautiful hybrid, though I'm not quite sure of what; my mind says trap and alternative pop, but that doesn't quite work. It sounds like anger incarnate; the bass shakes the room, it has one of the most satisfying melodies I've ever heard, and Billie's words are full of poison; every line is quotable. Billie's vocals on this track range all over the place; from the accusing, deeper tone throughout most of the song, to that lilting and high register on the bridge. The bridge is completely awesome; it slows the whole song down, as Billie sarcastically sings "I'm sorry, now you know... sorry, sorry, I'm sorry/ psych!". It's just wholly unexpected and I replayed it about ten times the first time I heard the song. "COPYCAT" proves everything it sets out to prove; that Billie is mature and a great vocalist, and that Finneas is able to create one of the best instrumentals of last year. It’s my most played song on last.fm for a reason.

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): it’s very interesting and the intelligent lyrics and great production keep me listening. also really really reminds me of Halsey.

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): you’re italic, i’m in bold

**Mysario** (9.5): the chorus makes me feel unsteady like I'm on a rocking boat ready to capsize, but thank g I live for danger!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): God, just GOD. This song may not have a lot of luster on its studio version, but this song is a complete banger live, to the point that I would compare the audience’s energy to that of a crazy rap concert. And the drop is crazy, when I saw her she had us all crouch and then jump when she dropped the iconic “SIKE!” It’s a perfect blend of her soft singing and brash alt pop.

**henry413** (8.7): ...Sike.

**kappyko** (8.5): Lyrics are corny, but I used to be obsessed with the wonderfully noisy synths. I was addicted to this for a lot of last year!

**ryanyu10** (8.5): She does Melanie Martinez better than Melanie Martinez does Melanie Martinez. Bridge seems somewhat contrived.

**Yatcho** (8.5): M*l*nie M*rtin*z's sound mopped and done better, crybaby found dead in a ditch

**CanadianSkeleton** (8): Everything about this song is so good. The bass in the chorus is amazing

**chipsi1** (8): when you make a song about being copied when at the time you released it there were about 3 people who knew you including your family

**cucumberanti** (8): this is literally halsey’s control but i like it

**shineflyer** (8): so much for exclusively lowercase

**tevinterimperium** (8): I love the production for this, but the lyrics are so... childish. I guess I should suspect that from a child though

**whatareblackhole** (8): I like this song, especially the heavy beat, but it comes off sooooo Melanie to me. I also hate the bold and italic line, sorryyyyyy.

**karenthecockpitpilot** (7.7): the bridge brings it down -.5 , so cringy :/

**twat\_brained** (7.6): "SIKE BITCH" >>>>>your fave's existence. In all honesty I love how cathartic this is and just how scathing Billie can be. Definitely not someone you'd want to cross. Not a fan of the studio version of this but goddamn if this isn't a hell of a closer live.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): "you've been uninvited" - story of my life

**bbfan132** (7.3): i like the menacing vibe during the prechorus, but the song was kind of repetitive and... sort of childish?

**JohnnyToby** (7.2): love her quirkiness

**Leixander** (7): i always start the album from watch but i still like the first three songs

**hikkaru** (6): the screams are cute but it’s tooooo edgy

**thatgreekguyraul** (5): I am conflicted with this song. It appears to have a mix of different elements that do not necessarily mesh well.

**CarlieScion** (4): i mean, miss billie, ur aesthetic isnt that original

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): this is gonna be some melanie martinez bullshit huh

**cloudbustingmp3** (3.4): the instrumental goes off a tad, but these lyrics... maybe i'm just too old now even at 23

amumumyspiritanimal: # #8: idontwannabeyouanymore
---

A beautiful and super relatable song, idontwannabeyouanymore deserved much more, but considering popheads' attitude towards ballads, I'm still pleasantly surprised it got into the top 10. God bless Billie and her putting every second teenager's thoughts into songs.

---

**Highlighted comment by u/SkyBlade79:** This is one of my top 5 favorite songs ever. It’s the first song I’m learning on piano. "idontwannabeyouanymore" is, despite the appearance of the name, a very smooth ballad. The lyrics in this song are completely and totally perfect. It's a plea to Billie's insecurities; it's totally heartbreaking and I can relate to it all so much. It's one of the few songs that I've cried to. Just the end of the chorus is tearjerking : "Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before / I don't wanna be you, anymore." Every word is spaced out and filled with infection and what sounds like genuine pain. With the exception of the lyrics, the song could totally fit into a fancy ball; the swinging, complex, percussion and the elegant piano work together so well. I know that y’all are going to rob this because of some stupid reason like the title or something stupid tho

###People with self-esteem issues:

**tf2manu994** (11): voice goals

**kappyko** (10): A fantastically written ballad, goes into an effective pop soul that is absurdly unexpected but works so beautifully.

**Kaylaboe** (10): i love the way she sings whore

**rotating3Dtext** (10): can relate

**ryanyu10** (10): Wow. Really digging her jazz sensibilities here with regards to the music, as well as the lyricism.

**twat\_brained** (10): I once saw someone from my graduation year of high school share on Facebook Billie's lyrical breakdown of this song on Genius, and it made the message come through so much clearer than the other times I'd heard it. I really don't wanna be myself anymore because I don't like what I've become, and so I really connect with Billie on that leve.

**whatareblackhole** (10): I ADORE this song. It’s so mature, especially for her being 15. She should be very proud of this one.

**chipsi1** (9): omfg

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Billie Eilish is a goddamn talented lyricist for her age, and this track is a perfect example of why. It’s soft but cutting, and the way each line flows into each other just feels so seamless, and it might be the first song that nails the “bottles/models” rhyme.

**bbfan132** (8.3): i wasn't expecting this to be a ballad with a nice message, but here we are! i like the message and what i perceive to be the double meaning of the title - people don't want to be a certain way, but once they realize that they are unique and special in their own way, they will end up shedding their former image of themselves.

**KittyKate10778** (7.5): too slow but its good quality

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): typinginalllowercaseandnospacesisntasedgyasyouthinkitis

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): edgy title

**shineflyer** (7.5): it vibes.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Some pretty good vocals from a then-fifteen year old here that show that Billie's voice isn't always as delightfully annoying as it can be in some of her more upbeat songs. It's not that fun to listen to outside of the EP, but it's a nice introduction to her more downtempo work.

**thatgreekguyraul** (7): Quite decent.

###People who apparently are perfect:

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6.6): the edgiest song title i've seen since 444+222

**CanadianSkeleton** (6.5): Sad and shit but those pa-dadada-da at the beginning are 100% unnecessary. Good rythm in the pre-chorus tho

**karenthecockpitpilot** (6.5): lyrics bring down -1

**CarlieScion** (6): i'd like this song better if it was sung by someone else :emofish:

**Shipsinker22** (6): eh

**JohnnyToby** (5): zayn teas

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): idontwannalistentothisEPanymore

amumumyspiritanimal: # #7: Take Me
---

Take Me is an amazing comeback single, and although it didn't get the buzz the girls might've needed, it definitely put them on the map as super competent synthpop artists.

---

**Highlighted comment by u/10footnotes:** I first heard this song when I was doing the charity rate, and I was blown away. Every single element of it comes together perfectly. The partly bored, partly frustrated vocal delivery that matches the lyrics. Aly and AJ's voices, which sound clear and strong. The amazing production, understated in the verses and explosive in the chorus. The way the song crescendoes in the final chorus by weaving in the lyrics of the bridge. This is a perfect pop song, and I appreciate it more every single time I hear it.

###They took them out:

**Raykel** (11): The gag of the rate is that this won't win, but it would've if it was a Carly song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): okay listen here you little fucks. you robbed them in disney, you robbed them in all-stars, and you robbed them in the charity rate. these girls did not drop their decade long hiatus, deliver pop perfection, and acknowledge our broke ass sub for this inadequate and unforgivable treatment. THIS IS THE LAST STAND AND I AM MAKING IT COUNT

**CarlieScion** (10): What a bop, this redeemed them from PBS which nearly killed my ears

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): gorgeous and fun

**gannade** (10): kinda euphoric

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Major 80's bop.

**lexarqade** (10): What a fucking BOP. Enough said.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): u/Uncereal (RIP) nominated this for the Charity Rat and it got as far as #11. I hope it gets as high as that or even higher.

**Mysario** (10): is this song inspired by iZombie?

**Shipsinker22** (10): an obvious ten, everybody below me is STRAIGHT

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Aly & AJ channel alternative pop to divine results. Every second feels so sleek. The Phil Collins-style drums.

**twat\_brained** (10): A GOOD comeback single!

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): verses lack something but the chorus melody is amazing.

**bbfan132** (9.2): I love the 80s-yet-current vibe of this song; it kind of sounds like a lost track from Emotion. It's not *perfect*, but it's very pleasant and the production/vocals are great.

**chipsi1** (9): cannibalism is an interesting song topic

**johnazoidberg-** (9): After this song I will happily take both of them out and my two new girlfriends and I are very happy together please respect our privacy

**kappyko** (9): Why should I pretend I don't like this? I love the catchiness and faux-'80s stylistics even if it's a bit uninspired.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I was very pleasantly surprised when I heard this during the charity rate, and it's only gotten better for me several months later. While it's hard to deny that their Disney channel days were full of bops, one only needs to compare the structure of Potential Breakup Song to more recent tracks like these to appreciate how much the sisters have grown as musicians. Definitely one of the most underrated songs of last year.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): an immaculate bop, wish it was longer tho!

**whatareblackhole** (8.5): I think this song is realllly good, and it was a strong comeback single, but it lacks a little bit of a punch for me.

**CanadianSkeleton** (8): didn’t know Aly & AJ before doing this rate and I’m digging this

**cucumberanti** (8): there is nothing more euphoric than aly singing “when you gonna take me out?????”

**KittyKate10778** (8): I want the verses to be longer

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): i like this even though i think it sounds a little too... edgy idk

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Some solid, if unfeeling synthpop. I know this sub adores these two, but I’ve always felt this EP has paled in comparison to Tegan & Sara and CHVRCHES and other modern synthpop acts. This song has a nice chorus though.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Honestly kind of reminds me of something Carly would do in the Emotion era both in vocal delivery and production style. It's very upbeat and summery.

**Yatcho** (8): Synthy and anthemy, Run Away With Me watered down. Kind of derivative

**Me-Luigi** (7.8): a good bop

**JohnnyToby** (7.5): nothing special but it's chill

**Leixander** (7.5): this was kinda underwhelming for me, i like it but it is not that special sadly

**shineflyer** (7): the rhythm of if - i - could - sink - my - teeth - in - to - you has been stuck in the back of my mind

###They *actually* took them out :sadgery: :

**SkyBlade79** (6): Kind of immature lyrical themes, and I don’t like the screaming, but the production is top notch.

**ryanyu10** (5.9): The intro and bridge are lackluster, and it gets repetitive, but other than that, decent (but only decent) pop. Production is the only part you can call “strong.”

**awhile2** (5): this sounds like a worse version of haim and i dont even like haim

**tf2manu994** (3): meh

Although the girls held out for the longest without losing a single song, they couldn't make further than #7. At least they are still skinny legends.

---

**Overall average**: 7.653

---

**TragicKingdom1**: This is basically the 80s synthpop sound with ambience turned up a notch. I enjoy this to an extent but it gets repetitive by the last song. I wish there was more of a climax at like...any point after Take Me. I don't think there's anything here detrimental, but it should've had more added on top. [Grade: B]

**Bendariaku89**: I loved the EP. absolute favorite has to be The Distance. I didn’t like I Know at first but it grew a little. it’s not as good as the other three songs however. no matter, this EP is great.

**Krugo1**: Starting from the top of the list, Aly & AJ, who I haven’t heard since “Potential Breakup Song” back in 2007 during their Disney days. Needless to say, I had no idea what to expect. I was extremely underwhelmed by the first two tracks which seemed like an unsure foray into synthpop while trying to stay true to their pop rock roots; the latter two tracks seemed a bit more cohesive and blended the synth vibe better with a quasi-indie pop sound.

**shineflyer**: It's not bad.

**RandomHypnotica**: It sounds exactly like what you'd expect from a couple of barely-famous celebrities. Vanilla: The Album. I was waiting for some personality and punch and it never came.

**thatgreekguyraul**: My favorite EP in this rate. Near damn perfect. Everything feels so cohesive, well thought out and the production is breathtaking. “I Know” solidified my love for them but it was “The Distance” that really made me realize that these girls have immense talent under their wings. Even though I grew up watching their their shows and movies, it still shocks me that they are former Disney actresses. Their music is so much more mature and simply great. “Potential Breakup Song” still bops to this day.

**Mysario**: I don't know what I expected after 10 years of being AJ and Aly-less, but the 80's synthpop sound of this album is really amazing and fills a void I didn't know I needed filling! ??

**chipsi1**: yes

**cyborglilith**: A boring and forgettable album.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Very nice way to start this rate, and a very nice comeback for some of the most talented former Disney stars of this era. I've never listened to anything else by them, but I can see why older pop music fans adore them-the sisterly dynamic is very present, the music they make is unexpectedly catchy, and both of them seem like great people. It's not a 10, but it'll do.

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: I’m hoenestly so glad these girls got back to music and decided to release this perfection of an EP. A little sad to hear that there are people who dismiss them due to their teen-pop history, though.

**Elitefourbrad**: Aly & AJ do it again with Take Me being the highlight!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: i'm assuming this album is out before #1 so let me just say y'all fucked up, someone link the cancel popheads petition

**rickikardashian**: Where were these girls hiding? All 4 songs are just amazing. I didn't think they'd be able to make songs as good as Take me, I was kind of expecting the EP to be 1 great song and a whole lot of filler, but they really brought it

**twat\_brained**: How long it feels waiting for One Direction to reunite amirite folks lol i’m dying inside pls reunite @zayn @louis @harry @niall @liam

**whatareblackhole**: I was really excited for Aly & AJ to finally make a comeback and this did not disappoint. This is mature, 80s-tinged pop for any listener, an exciting move for what is to come for the sister duo. I’m still waiting for an explicit remake of “Potential Breakup Song,” but “I Know” will do for now.

The most underrated queen in the race, Maggie Rogers went in with people doubting she would even live to day 2, but you can't stop talent(at least not before the top 5). She fought and clawed her way into the top 10 with her amazing bops, and in the end, she did got here! Congrats Maggie, thank you for being the Carly Rae Jepsen of the indie pop scene.

---

**Highlighted comment by u/BiPolarBear17:** The face Pharrell pulled when he listened to this for the first time is the face I pull EVERYtime I listen to it. It's so indescribably magical, and it makes me feel as if all my problems simply float away. With it's intimate, melancholy atmosphere laden with all sorts of 'nature' noises and twinkling chimes, it managed to whisk away my 11.

###Alaska deserved to win AS2:

**chipsi1** (11): i lost my wig while walking through icy streams that took my breath away

**Kaylaboe** (11): ugh, this song. it’s such a lush and chill tune and it still sounds as fresh as when pharell first heard it

**mudkip1owo** (11): this deserves all the 11s. it's the kinda song that reminds me why i love music so damn much

**shineflyer** (11): birdcalls, patting on jeans, and more. this song's just so well written. the chorus is fucking heavenly. i can only dream to have a head voice like that

**Tedyonce** (11): One of the most phenomenal songs of the past eight years.

**cyborglilith** (10): LOVE IT

**johnazoidberg-** (10): One of my favorite videos that ever got deleted from Youtube was Maggie playing this song for PHarrell, but the song was replaced with I'LL SUCK YOUR DICK FOR A CUP OF COFFEE. Good times

**kappyko** (10): Pharrell literally cried when he heard this song

**letsallpoo** (10): wig flew

**lexarqade** (10): This is such a mellow bop, I love it

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i feel like I’m underwater

**ryanyu10** (10): You can see why Pharrell teared up at this song.

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): This track is holy amazing. I love how nostalgic it makes me feel. I might be a bit biased since Alaska is a beautiful state.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This song is EVERYTHING. E V E R Y T H I N G. Maggie Rogers delivers a poppy Sylvan Esso here that just blew me away the first time I listened. It’s bouncy, foresty, fresh, lush, and just absolutely gorgeous. It just sounds like walking towards something unknown but exciting. I haven’t heard pop this evocative in years, and she does it a few more times in this EP.

**theburningundead** (10): I really love this song even though I can't understand a single word she is saying

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Such a chill bop. The instrumentation is low-key, but warm and popping and very fitting to Maggie's voice. I can see why Pharrell loved this.

**whatareblackhole** (10): I really love the mix of sounds and genres in this one. And her voice lilts so perfectly over the production. I am Pharrell when listening to this song.

**Yatcho** (10): It's incredible she was able to make this song as a student

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): this is funky

**CanadianSkeleton** (9): So good I wanna go freeze my ass off in Juneau

**CarlieScion** (9): kinda a jam

**RandomHypnotica** (9): This song is just such a beautiful, pretty and delicate experience, I don't really have much else to say about it, it's just a wonderful experience.

**Shipsinker22** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7qVnjwaBTs

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): damn this sucky buy also badass what is this

**twat\_brained** (8.5): Looking for Alaska? Look no further! Nothing I’d particularly seek out but a pleasant change of pace from the pop I’ve accustomed myself to.

**bbfan132** (8.3): The production is clean, the vocals are sublime, and the overall song is very peaceful and warm. I like how she's talking to both her former self and the actual place as well.

**cucumberanti** (8): her falsettos

**rickikardashian** (8): #Justice4Katya

**SkyBlade79** (8): definitely her best song thus far. Her high register is really good and should be used much more… Really good imagery too.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I wasn't very interested by this song overall, but Maggie's voice in the chorus is sweet, and even if following up the chanting song with another slow track was kind of a mistake, there's no denying that this is well written. In fact, i could say that it actually fits the imagery of Alaska very well. It's a better testimony to that state than Sarah Palin!

###She tried to bribe Detox so she should've been banned:

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): i saw y'all hyping this like it was god's gift to earth and it's just... okay :help:

**onceberry** (4): I swear that I really wanted to like it with the way y'all were hyping it :(

The underrated queen dying just right before the top 5, sad... At least we got to know Maggie, so that's a pro!

---

**Overall average**: 7.470

---

**TragicKingdom1**: I think the sound of this EP could be described as Florence + The Machine meets Alessia Cara. This concept works excellent on paper but the execution needs some work imo. There's a lot of potential in Maggie's aesthetic but I didn't find the production created enough of an atmosphere to live up to that. That being said, I do think there's some great songwriting and hooks that I definitely can get into. This is good, but not as good as it could be. [Grade: B]

**Bendariaku89**: I’ve never heard of her, but her music is amazing. not a single song I hate, even Color Song (though I’m not sure anyone hates it). On + Off was amazing and the rest were great ranging from 9.8 to 8. overall, an excellent EP.

**Krugo1**: Another artist unknown to me. Decidedly indie with a hefty dash of folk that blended seamlessly as the EP progressed into synthpop territory. I liked it more than I expected to, but it certainly didn’t blow me away.

**shineflyer**: very creative, even if i onlu truly love two of the five songs.

**RandomHypnotica**: What a truly beautiful, peaceful and serene experience this album was.

**thatgreekguyraul**: I got a very “campy” feeling when listening to this. It is by no means perfect, but it was different and quite decent. A lot of the production used cricket sounds and it made you feel like you were outside at night in the forest. I am actually excited to see what else she releases.

**mudkip1owo**: THIS EP IS SO FUCKING GOOD

**Mysario**: DON'T SLEEP ON THIS EP

**chipsi1**: Now That Chipsi Is Stanning

**cyborglilith**: I love the aesthetic.

**strawberryswing1**: this is nice background music

**SkyBlade79**: this EP is basically just Alaska and that’s all that matters in it

**CreepyMannequin**: Lots of potential, but pretty boring

**Leixander**: a really beautiful, enchanting EP

**Yatcho**: New indie-folk queen. So impressed she was able to follow up Alaska with quality pop tracks

**karenthecockpitpilot**: I adore her ear for instrumentation, it's very natural. But besides that, I don't see anything particularly unique about her, a bit boring to me.

**patronsaintofaspies**: One of the slower EPs in this rate so far, which makes me a little less enthusiastic about it. I'm not opposed to slow pop done right, but after hearing pretty synths, edgy production, and quirky alternative songwriting, the folky vibes of this record don't manage to be interesting enough for me to be fully sold on Maggie. But, hey, it did get a 10. And it's not bad at all.

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: this noname trash was introduced to me by my lovely friend u/fax5jrj and I’m glad she did bc “Dog Years” is that chill bop

**10footnotes**: I can't believe I'm saying this about a pop artist, but the choruses are my least favorite parts of these songs. Maggie relies a bit too much on "oohs" as lyrics as well. However, I like both Split Stones and Fallingwater more than the songs here, so I'm interested in seeing how she continues to develop/evolve her sound.

**Elitefourbrad**: Bop wigi!

**henry413**: Not really my type, I do appreciate her effort to integrate nature voice in the tracks tho. It's a really relaxing album.

**rickikardashian**: we need to redifine what bops are, because i was promised bops for this and all i got was midtempo songs

**twat\_brained**: Maggie was the only artist I hadn't heard of prior to this rate but after hearing this EP I'm willing to give more of her work a listen.

**whatareblackhole**: Wow, this EP really hit me! I didn’t expect to receive this one very well, but I’m pleasantly surprised at Maggie’s talent. The imagery and sense of place in all of these songs is amazing and moved me deeply. By giving “Dog Years” my 11, I think I’ve given this EP a technically perfect score and, honestly, it deserves it. I’m upset because I know Popheads is probably going to pay Maggie dust, but I hope this EP affected others as much as it affected me.

The most controversial song in the top 5, DKMV proved itself to be a worthy opponent and showed us that Sigrid has a lot to offer. Although people pointed out that the EP sounds a bit same-y but this song was the perfect prequel to her best song so far, Strangers. Good job Sigrid, you got into the top 5.

**Hightlighted comment by u/bbfan132:** I ADORE the message of standing strong and firm against people who try to control you in this song. The slow verses that build up to the powerful and upbeat chorus, along with the clapping in the bridge, help to make this song feel like the ultimate motivational/uplifting pop anthem.

###This is a good song and these people know it:

**CarlieScion** (11): This is the perfect pop song, like Cut to the Feeling-levels good

**Shipsinker22** (11): this is one of my most scrobbled tracks ever, its in almost every one of my 100+ playlists. i never have or will get sick of this song. Rebecca black and Fake Friends ALMOST took the 11, but it came home :D

**static\_int\_husp** (11): I *love* this song. It's pure pop and really shows what Sigrid can do. Quite possibly my favorite song of hers.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (11): A great, moody banger. Even if I didn't love the verses, this song would be an 11 contender just from the fantastic pre-chorus and hook. It's bombastic and a bit chaotic but big and anthemic. I love every second. Kendrick x Sigrid when

**CanadianSkeleton** (10): One of the best bangers I’ve ever listened to. I never get tired of it.

**chipsi1** (10): kendrick's vibe was killed

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Sigrid is so bopworthy!

**JohnnyToby** (10): Deserves an 11. Remember hating this the first time I heard it ugh but it bops so hard

**kappyko** (10): HEr only good song bye

**Kaylaboe** (10): wig snatched. armpit shaved. pubic hair waxed. follicles gone. kendrick dead

**Leixander** (10): I TRIED TO PLAY IT NICE BUT OOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHH OH DON'T KILL MY VIBE

**Me-Luigi** (10): - what a debut, instant classic

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i don’t trust anyone who gives this lower than a 10 don’t /u/me

**mudkip1owo** (10): what a bop

**rickikardashian** (10): \*clapping intensifies*

**selegend** (10): one of the best debut singles of 2017. “say i’m young, i don’t care, i won’t quit” gives me LIFE

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): One of the best “fuck off” anthems I have heard in a while. Sigrid has such a piercing personality and runs away with this song. I love her confidence.

**Mysario** (9.5): not as good as the Simlish version but that should go without saying

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): kendrick lamar is shaking

**twat\_brained** (9): Great and fun tune and I find it adorable that I can hear her accent in the song.

**whatareblackhole** (9): Yas bitch! Vibe intact!

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Well, this is definitely the most energetic, vibrant opening song in this bunch of EPs. Sigrid is borderline shouting in the microphone at some points, not that I dislike that. There are also elements in the production like the handclaps that further the notion. It can be a little too much for me at some times, but this does prove that her vibe isn't going away anytime soon.

**cucumberanti** (8): the perfect hype song

**tf2manu994** (8): i was losing hope

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): i expected more

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I know Sigrid is a sacred icon on this sub, but compared to this star-studded cast of EPs, hers pales in comparison to some of the more bombastic and emotional EPs here. This track is good, but it feels like it’s missing something, idk why.

###:BANHAMMER:

**shineflyer** (6): the distorted "think you're so important to me don't you" is a cool touch

**cloudbustingmp3** (5.5): the bridge is nice but the rest is... kinda just there

**ryanyu10** (4.9): I mean, it’s alright production-wise. I can’t get over this impression of childish pettiness I get from this song though, and it’s really turning me off to it.

**SkyBlade79** (3): this is just a buildup to nothing and her voice is so bad

**Bendariaku89** (2.5): I don’t hate the song so much as it didn’t catch in anyway

**awhile2** (2): this is the most obnoxious hook ive heard since that twiddling my thumb song

amumumyspiritanimal: # Don't Kill My Vibe
---

@my baby girl getting that top 5 placement by any means necessary

---

**Overall average**: 7.600

---

**TragicKingdom1**: This is a strong debut effort for Sigrid. The quality tying each of the four songs together is how anthemic they are, and Sigrid adds to this by sounding like she's putting in maximum effort to each performance. In fact, despite not being a technically great vocalist, I feel like Sigrid's vocals are the highlight here-- there's just something so charming about her accent that makes each song special. [Grade: A-]

**Bendariaku89**: I don’t know why, this EP was bad. I genuinely don’t like any song. I liked Strangers, but all of these were pretty bland with maybe the exception of Dynamite. perhaps it’s just the type of songs I like to listen to, but none of the songs caught my attention and I just wanted to end them. Dynamite isn’t as bad as the others but even then it wasn’t anything special.

**Krugo1**: The last of this rating, thoroughly glad I participated, and I hope to do more in the future. I hadn’t heard of Sigrid prior and admittedly thought “Don’t Kill My Vibe” was the Kendrick song haha. It didn’t really connect with me so my ratings are probably low

**shineflyer**: i remember it being better than it is tbh

**Banananaise**: Sigrid is an adorable child with attitude and i want to protect her. anyway it's a shame her best song (strangers) isn't on the EP

**thatgreekguyraul**: Loved the title track and Lorde (our saviour) recently raved about her on Twitter, before she killed all her tweets. I think she oozes an extremely confident personality. I love her. She really needs to make it big here in the States. We need an artist like her. Zara Larsson came and went. I think Sigrid could very well fill that empty niche.

**Mysario**: a generically good ep where it's p good and worth the rotation, but I'm sure I'll forget I listened to this in a month

**cyborglilith**: queen of failing to sing the most basic empowerment anthems in the world

**strawberryswing1**: Not a fan of this EP: she builds entire songs around tired, unoriginal cliches, screeches too much with her terrible, hoarse voice, and I hate the dichotomy she uses with relativly quiet verses and then huge, loud drops. This all comes together especially in "Plot Twist". Sigrid is just not for me I guess, though she seems like a sweetie and I wish her success.

**Leixander**: I am sad that she probably wouldn't be able to outpeak DKMYV and Plot Twist in terms of bopping quality

**tf2manu994**: i was disappointed i wouldn't find anything cool from my first rate but then i found this, thanks

**Yatcho**: She's got spunk, you can really feel her emotion through her singing. Really impressive debut for someone so young

**patronsaintofaspies**: This will end up getting a high average, which only proves to me that statistics can end up going so far. It's not that this album wasn't serviceable, but even if there was nothing *wrong* with the songs per se, I still ended up feeling really ambivalent on it. The songs are too similar and it doesn't make for a good enough EP overall.

**theburningundead**: I really wanted to like this a lot more than I did but more often than not the lyrics are just a bit of a let down

**Elitefourbrad**: Norwegian pop princess.

**henry413**: Carly remained unbothered.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: if this is out im sorry 4 ur loss /u/berober04

**rickikardashian**: I really hope Sigrid truly is the next big thing. Don't Kill My Vibe and Plot Twist are in my favorite songs from the last year and she just oozes positivity. She makes me want to live again.

**whatareblackhole**: I think Sigrid’s debut EP was a really smart and small taste of what we can expect from her in the future, especially by starting with the demand for us to not kill her vibe. I think Sigrid’s vibe is something more people should know of and adhere to, especially after her big Sound of BBC win earlier this year. Sigrid’s EP is effervescent and relatable, an exciting shortlist of fun and familiar moods that get us into Sigrid’s vibe.

**Highligthed comment by u/BiPolarBear17:** I can't screech eNOUGh about how much I love this song :despair: Alterlife encapsulates the feel of the EP so perfectly, with it's video game-esque guitar riff from the heavens, a key change to end all key changes, and a hook so catchy even my corpse will still be screeching along to it. Also the video? Dewiggifying. I was struggling to choose between this and Alaska for my 11, but I felt that maggie needs the help just a 'lil bit more ;)

##People who are WRONG:

**lexarqade** (11): This fucking song. If this isn't at least top 3 popheads is officially cancelled. This makes me do things. There were a lot of 11-worthy songs on RINA but this definitely takes the cake.

**Mysario** (11): ??????

**theburningundead** (11): I only heard this song for the first time early this year but I fell in love with it immediately and I have had it on repeat constantly since then. Without a doubt one of my favourite songs of 2017, the way it builds to that key change in the final chorus is just incredible and makes this an easy 11

**awhile2** (10): invented guitar riffs wow

**bbfan132** (10): Absolute perfection. I can feel myself diverting from our society already just by listening to this song. The soaring, uplifting production and vocals complement the theme of being yourself and rising above and away from everyone else flawlessly.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): greedy found dead

**henry413** (10): Reminds me of Ayumi Hamasaki's early work, and I LOVE it!

**Kaylaboe** (10): ugh the guitar riff. ha hands

**Leixander** (10): this deserved a way better video RINA smh

**Raykel** (10): It's like an early 2000s live-action disney channel film starring a girl with 2 large blonde stripes in her hair wearing camoflauge pants. I live for the imagery.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): a e s t h e t i c

**shineflyer** (10): that guitar tone pierces through my heart.

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Holy hell. Now this is quality. Pure quality. Those electric guitars are amazing. Wow.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Reminds me a lot of Sky Ferreira, especially Nobody Asked Me (If I Was Okay), but that’s a good thing. Clarence Clarity continues his streak of stellar production (buy No Now on iTunes), and Rina delivers on vocals, with another pretty much flawless track. It’s just infectious and all the little quirks in the instrumental work so well.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): extremely high tension, which i love...plus the key change is amazing

**twat\_brained** (10): If the song didn't already leave me floored then goddamn did that key change snatch and burn every weave I ever owned.

**Yatcho** (10): This song proves Rina is THAT BITCH. Clarence continues to slay the bridges in these songs

**ryanyu10** (9.6): This is some really nice production.

**JohnnyToby** (9.5): ugh her mind

**cucumberanti** (9): where were you when rina sawayama invented jrock on september 21st 2017

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): neat

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Oh, man, after we get an awesome interlude we get a stupefying guitar performance from-wait, who's performing the guitar here? Is it Rina or someone else? Maybe it's a sample. Either way, I still want to kiss them. This is an excellent example of pop rock, and it's actually the first pop rock song I've heard in quite a while.

**rickikardashian** (7.8): that guitar is fucking badass YES

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.5): the intro is kind of annoying as shit and is really kind of unfortunate but whew the rest saves it

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): Has a cool, very 90s grungy feel to it.

**Bendariaku89** (7): it goes on a tad too long in my opinion.

**CarlieScion** (7): i love the guitar in this

**kappyko** (7): Kinda good but not the strongest on the EP, probably my least favorite, honestly?

###People who are C O R R E C T:

**whatareblackhole** (6): I literally don’t understand what this song is about.

**SkyBlade79** (3): rina just seems so generally unoriginal smh

###LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE:

**awhile2** (11): this song makes me nostalgic for a time period i don't even remember

**TragicKingdom1** (11): Strongly reminiscient of Britney's early work, and I actually think it outdoes all of those songs. This captures a manic energy that gives it depth beyond its perfect boppiness.

**Bendariaku89** (10): KIM POSSIBLE. It’s as if she decided to come to real life and sing a song about how she’s kicking ass. also Britney Spears joined in. ALSO THAT FUCKING KEY CHANGE.

**CarlieScion** (10): wig flew

**chipsi1** (10): YES

**cyborglilith** (10): mega bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this feels like an early 2000's girl group song but with some modern and a lot more interesting production.

**lexarqade** (10): Everything about this song is just absolutely perfect. The early 2000's vibe, the production, the fake-out into the second verse, I just can't. So fucking good.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): that key change tho. Wig flew

**Raykel** (10): Why do I imagine this as Kim Possible if she became a popstar?

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): nice

**whatareblackhole** (10): This song pops OFF! I love love love this one.

**Yatcho** (10): "Baby One More Time" Britney singing a Backstreet Boys song with modern production ability. I NEED a choreographed dance to memorize for this

**bbfan132** (9.6): Rina Sawayama, queen of defeating the conformists and haters <3

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): honestly the new millennium sound is everything

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): Rina giving me the early 2000's pop throwback I didn't know I wanted.

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): early 2000s Britney vibes

**twat\_brained** (9.4): This reminds me a lot of "Can't Make You Love Me". "Can't Make You Love Me" is one of Britney Spears' best deep cuts. This girl knows how to honor her pop predecessors.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): take my wig as it is

**cucumberanti** (9): between this and lady bird i’m so happy 2000s revival is a thing

**ryanyu10** (9): Nothing much to say other than that it’s a good song.

**shineflyer** (9): I thought the Y2K rate was last month?

**thatgreekguyraul** (9): Not going to lie, vocals and production ooze Britney vibes and I love it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): When this song drops so does my ass

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): This continues the pure 00s pop style present in Ordinary Superstar and brings it up to a new level-I could definitely see this fit into albums like Oops! I Did It Again if it was less experimental. Putting two songs with great hooks at the start of an EP is a great way for listeners to prepare for the more alternative stuff on this album, that's for certain.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): This reminds me of Britney for some reason. It works, too.

**johnazoidberg-** (8): Rina is absolutely crushing this rough draft of Tearin Up My Heart

**Shipsinker22** (8): girl u aint britney! although a bop

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Someone in the youtube comments said this sounds like the kim possible theme and I can't get that out of my head now

**JohnnyToby** (7.9): wow ok britney teas

**rickikardashian** (6.8): is this an early 2000’s Briney Spears reject?

amumumyspiritanimal: # #2: bellyache
---

What an incredible work of art, and at such a young age! The spiritual successor to Lorde as she moved on to more adult themes, Billie really proved herself with this track, charting on the popheads chart back last year out of nowhere, and winning over my heart in an instant. Although it didn't snatch the crown, since Miss Rina did *that*, bellyache still proved to be a really strong song, and currently the pinnacle of our favorite Pirate's discography in all of it's lowercase glory.

---

**Highlighted comments by u/SkyBlade79:** This is such an amazing piece of art, with two very distinct meanings. On one hand, it can be interpreted as a song about self-doubt and insecurity, with lines like "I lost my mind, I don't mind." But then, on the other hand, is the much more likely, crazier, meaning. It could literally be about a murderer who is on the verge of committing suicide, and there's tons of evidence for this. "My friends aren't far/ in the back of my car/ lay their bodies", "Maybe it's in the gutter / where I left my lover", "Everything I do / the way I wear my noose/ like a necklace," and the video further evidences this interpretation. The fact that a 15 year old came up with all this... As far as the song itself, it's just a genuine pleasure to listen to. The background vocals, that guitar instrumentation, and the deep, pulsating bass in the chorus all work together to make a tapestry of sound. This and Copycat are Finneas's best work, in my opinion. 

**and u/ThatParanoidPenguin:** Her best song, and what got me into her in the first place. When she released this, she wasn’t quite popheads’ indie darling yet, and I actually [featured this track as one of the most slept on songs in February.](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5x6kxn/discussion_ive_been_curating_a_list_with_a/?utm_term=a15979a1-4155-4549-a742-ea28e5b597a8&utm_medium=search&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=popheads&utm_content=6) However, I never would’ve guessed she would soar to be pop’s most exciting new act, but I guess it’s not that surprising with this strong of a body of work out already. Bellyache is a track that feels so effortless as Billie drops into a scheming rant, taking the part of a murderous psychopath reeling in their actions. The lyrics are short but incredible, and this feels more like the work of a visionary than a song by a teenager.

###sociopaths:

**LiteraturePenguin** (11): great if you like songs about murder

**twat\_brained** (11): I can hardly put into words the love I have for this song or for Billie. I tried to do her justice when I performed this live but I don't even think that's possible. Especially not after I heard HER perform it live and how LIT that was. What IS possible, however, is for this to win the rate. It'll never happen bc this is popheads but it deserves at least top 10.

**CanadianSkeleton** (10): Holy shit I love this song. If DKMV and RINA weren’t there I would’ve given my 11 to this one. The harmonies, the strumming pattern, the beat and the story that’s told, they’re all amazing

**chipsi1** (10): i agree

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Holy shit this motherfucking drop i love this song a lot.

**kappyko** (10): well duhhhh

**karenthecockpitpilot** (10): iconic. beautiful and eerie sounding chorus esp the production. The way the synth echos her wail gets me erry time

**Kaylaboe** (10): literally slaying

**Leixander** (10): one of the best choruses from 2017

**mudkip1owo** (10): another SONG wow a bop

**shineflyer** (10): an acoustic vs. electronic battle

**tevinterimperium** (10): The lyrics are bad but I can't deny the boptitude

**thatgreekguyraul** (10): Stellar song from Billie. Her vocals shine really well in this. Not to mention how impeccable the production is. The effects and change in the chorus from the constant guitar strums in the verses felt experimental.

**bbfan132** (9.7): i love how she's portraying herself as a psychopath, but sings as if she is a small child. if people weren't paying attention to the lyrics, they would have no idea that the song is about murder, and that makes it so much better (not that it already wasn't really good).

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9.5): good but the marian hill remix is better

**Yatcho** (9.3): Whew that CHORUS! My body lost control of itself

**cucumberanti** (9): ok this is actually really good

**henry413** (9): how is this still not used in any movies

**JohnnyToby** (9): Wow the video somehow made the song worse. Theres at least some character in this song.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i feel like every individual sound of this EP (spacey, moody, and rebellious) is mashed together and somehow works really well

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): the chorus is an absolute slut-dropping BOP but it doesn't last LONG ENOUGH. I WANT MORE

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): This song represents pretty much everything I feel about this album. It combines a few different sounds, and very well. The lyrics, however, are kind of mediorce and / or edgy though, and that brings it all down slightly.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Best song she's dropped to date. The beat goes hard and Billie actually is able to have some real swagger on it.

**ryanyu10** (8.2): Highkey crazy, and I like it for that except for the chorus – that just seems a tad bit trite.

**whatareblackhole** (8): Oh my god, I’ve been avoiding this song because it has the word “belly” in it which is high key a gross word, but this goes OFF

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): This is like a bad snuff fan-fiction you end up writing in your teenage years so you can kill off your least favourite character in a young adult fiction series and piss off everyone. Then, once you start the road to recovery, you come across the fanfiction and almost die from embarrassment. At the same time, though? Your work manages to be strangely entertaining.

####even crazier people:

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.7): i thought since she's like 15 she was saying "where's my mom" until like just now... like she got abandoned in a grocery store ldfhgfdlfdghj

**Shipsinker22** (4): God I hate the production on the chorus and everything else is basic

amumumyspiritanimal: # don't smile at me
---

One of the best EP's I've ever heard, don't smile at me really snatched my wig and turned me into a Billie stan. I'm so gad she got to this far, and that she almost won! Congrats girl, you are only 16 yet, yet you still made so many amazing bops. Also the fact that I was the only one with a perfect avg for this is homophobic but w/e

---

**Overall average**: 7.623

---

**TragicKingdom1**: Billie shows songwriting potential here but it's plodded down by a dreary atmosphere that I don't really like. Nothing quite feels like filler but I also don't really enjoy most of it. She should've reached for a bigger emotional range. [Grade: B-]

**tevinterimperium**: The production is easily this album's most valuable asset. Billie's singing is fine. They lyrics on songs like COPYCAT, bellyache, party favor, my boy, and hostage are childish and borderline cringey at some points; however, the songs are still extremely enjoyable despite the flaws. I am sure her music will only get better as she matures.

**Bendariaku89**: this EP definitely has some amazing songs and bops (hostage, bellyache, my boy, idontwannabeyouanymore and COPYCAT). the other three songs weren’t as great and watch was in my opinion the worst but this EP is definitely worth listening with those five songs I loved.

**Krugo1**: An artist who I hadn’t heard prior to this listen. Considering she was only fifteen when most of these songs were produced, it was much more solid than I expected (and certainly better than anything I could’ve done at that age). I was more impressed with the upbeat tracks, as the slower tracks waded into moody indie pop that clashed directly with the strong opener.

**shineflyer**: people kept tellin me this was a good album. why didn't i listen? they were right. it's especially impressive for her age, too.

**RandomHypnotica**: Billie's age definitely shows in the EP, both lyrically and musically, and whilst it's not my favourite album, I feel like there's definitely potential for her to make something spectacular in the future.

**thatgreekguyraul**: While there were a mixed bag of songs on here, I thought the EP had some great tracks and Billie herself shows tremendous potential for her forthcoming full-length studio album. Her style is left of center and deserves recognition for how unique it all feels.

**Mysario**: if spooky pop was a genre, that's where this would land

**chipsi1**: and what if i will ur like 6

**cyborglilith**: she sounds uncannily similar to Melanie Martinez

**PuggleMaster**: Industry plant acting like she's some under aged prodigy when she's really 18!!!!!

**tf2manu994**: just add 100 to all my scores of this tbh

**Yatcho**: a lot of the songs are tumblr as fuck but as a whole surprisingly bogged down by some slow, quiet tracks

**patronsaintofaspies**: This EP is definitely a paradox. The teenage edginess we're all familiar with is very present here and very, very tangible in a way that would give Pure Heroine era Lorde a run for her money, but at the same time, it ends up giving the work colour and substance that wouldn't have been present otherwise. If anything, it makes me excited to see how Billie will improve on her natural talent as she grows up. It makes me wonder how she'll think of it in the future, too. Will she be embarrassed by it? Or will she find it cute? Time can only tell.

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: damn this kid and ha brother is goed

**Elitefourbrad**: A good effort for someone younger than me.

**ImADudeDuh**: I am so happy I did this rate cause I never would've heard this EP if I hadn't done this rate!

**cloudbustingmp3**: i think i understand how some people felt about Pure Heroine in the original tumblrcore rate when they said it was too teen angst-y because whew... i just can't get into this lyrically at all, and it's just unfortunate because the production is nice if a bit derivative of a few other artists

**henry413**: a creepy surprise

**rickikardashian**: Back in 2013, my gay ass would always get drawn to tumblr-esque artists that would appeal to *alternative* teens  ^(~~although I was also a whore for mainstream pop~~). There was a certain appeal about them, because as much as I loved my girly girl music, there was a connection with artists whose public was more 'underground' to say it like that. Melanie Martinez right now isn't in a good place with me, considering that a best she's a creepy confusing person, and at worst a rapist, but at the moment, she was one of the few artists that I was totally captivated with, not only with her music, but her looks, persona and career too. After that, most of those artists evolved and I just wasn't so into similar artists, until Billie. She somehow reminds me of those Tumblr artists that were very visual and had a very specific character/personality. She has the same ^(kind of forced) coolness and quirkyness, and just embodies teen angst and attitude. Her music is also very good and chill, and with this EP you get a perfect piece of who she is right now. Maybe in a few years ill get second hand embarrassment thinking on her attitude, but as of now I truly believe she's an artists that needed to exist again

**twat\_brained**: I'll be honest, when I first heard Billie's music it reminded me a lot of Melanie Martinez. Minus the rape allegations, of course. But yeah, it's definitely refreshing to hear "kiddie music" by a musician who is still a kid herself in many ways.

**whatareblackhole**: I’d been skirting around Billie’s EP for a while, but after a full listen, it has some really great songs. I think Billie is in kind of a tough position – she’s really young, and the last time we had a young savant, it was the-overly-mature-for-her-age queen Lorde. Billie sometimes shows her age so much that it contrasts with the mood of her music, but I’m trying my best to let the songs speak for themselves. I really, really enjoyed this EP.

amumumyspiritanimal: # #1: Cyber Stockholm Syndrome
---

I mean if any song off of RINA should win, it's definitely CSS. As much as I tried to dislike this song, the chill vibes, her vocals, and the choreo and looks of the MV won me over. Although I didn't liked her EP, this song and Valentine inspired me to wait for her new material.

---

**Highlighted comment by u/cloudbustingmp3:** this is one of those songs i can have on repeat for an hour without realizing it because it's exhilarating in every way. absolutely magnificent piece of pop that manages to both sound like a throwback but futuristic at the same time, and the idea that technology can be a distraction but also a safe haven is one i can really connect with. it's smartly written and immaculately produced, and a perfect way to end an incredible work

###I won't make a Stockholm Syndrome joke because it's not funny:

**Banananaise** (11): me screaming alone from the empty mosh pit: RELATABLE

**CanadianSkeleton** (11): The low piano chords at the beginning got me. Then the pre-chorus hit me with its lyrics and melodies and then the OUT OF THIS WORLD CHORUS with that drop at its very beginning. Finally there was the progression into the J-Pop ending. Amazing from beginning to end

**cucumberanti** (11): she fucking snapped

**henry413** (11): Still got goosebumps when the bridge hits.

**PuggleMaster** (11): The final chorus WIIIIIIIIGGGGGG

**RandomHypnotica** (11): This is THE defining Rina track, it combines everything I love about her EP into one song, vivid lyrics, great layered production, cute little details and nods, and there's even the final fantasy reference at the end to finish off everything. Absolute PERFECTION.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): i love what this song says, and its sound, its style, everything

**selegend** (11): yeah this is one of the best songs in existence

**Yatcho** (11): The buildup in this song from verses to chorus is incredible, and then that bridge launches my wig into the galaxy

**10footnotes** (10): The buildup in this song is amazingly well-done. That last chorus is heaven!

**bbfan132** (10): I never thought that I'd find songs that I could relate to so closely, but here we are. Everything about this song just warms my heart.

**Bendariaku89** (10): it feels like a spaceship travelling through space.

**BiPolarBear17** (10): Find me a song title more iconic.

**chipsi1** (10): WHY IS NOBODY BUYING IT WHY IS NOBODY STREAMING IT WHY

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Asian excellency!

**gannade** (10): there is so much going on in this song and it kinda works?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is what I expect is gonna win.

**JohnnyToby** (10): Fuck this is hot. Glad she ended witha banger.

**kappyko** (10): ok yea fuck it i love this lol

**karenthecockpitpilot** (10): that ending goddamn

**Leixander** (10): NOW YOU SEE LEIX's WIG FLYIIIING HIGH SPEED ACROSS THE DISTANT GAAALAAAAXYYYYYYY

**lexarqade** (10): An absolute journey of a song. It's all a big mood.

**mudkip1owo** (10): such a bop

**rickikardashian** (10): The whole change the song goes through during the bridge is fucking magical. She truly took me to a cyber world. Love it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This was SO close, SO close to my 11, but Maggie slightly edged over in the end (also bc she needs the support bc she WILL be robbed). Cyber Stockholm Syndrome is not merely a song, it is a way of life. It provides the best and catchiest metaphor for technological addiction I’ve ever heard, and it’s backed by the best beat drop in this rate, it’s magical and massive and goes off so incredibly hard live. Everything about this track is just alt pop excellence.

**twat\_brained** (10): People are gonna look back on Rina's career and wonder why this wasn't bigger. I will be one of those people. I first heard this on the Popheads 100 Best of 2017 and haven't looked back since. And I won't have to seeing as how this is the end of the EP??

**Raykel** (9.7): An amazing closing track. The bridge to the final chorus reminds me of those explosive endings in movies.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): incredible climax and lyrics. of the actual contenders for winning the rate i hope this pulls through!

**Mysario** (9): musically it's pretty okay, but the lyrics in this really hit home

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Okay, I think this was much more relatable than Tunnel Vision, and, boy, is it amazing. I love songs with a dramatic beat, rhythm and/or melody and this fits the criteria. You can perfectly envision the situation Rina is describing in the chorus, even if it's happening online. This kind of reminds me of an abusive relationship I had on the Internet, though, which makes me cringe...

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): i had to force myself to appreciate this but it’s good

**Shipsinker22** (9): okay yeah a bop.

**thatgreekguyraul** (8): I love this. Reminds me of 2000s R&B songs.

**whatareblackhole** (8): The final chorus of this song is insanely good. But I don’t get it? Kappy’s yelled at me before for this, but to me, the lyrics are not in favor of social media/internet happenings; however, allegedly, to Rina, this song is about embracing having a positive online presence? I just don’t think she accomplished what she thinks she did. But it’s a bop.

**shineflyer** (7.5): this destiny's child harpsichord

**ryanyu10** (7.3): It’s nice, but doesn’t really stand out that much.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): this is a lot to take in

###No, I still won't:

**CarlieScion** (6): idk how to feel about htis

**SkyBlade79** (4.5): idk… I didn’t like this song at first then I loved it, now I’m back to indifference. Just lost it’s charm concerningly fast

amumumyspiritanimal: # RINA
---

Although it might have not been my taste, Rina served opulence with this EP. Cyber Stockholm Syndrome really deserved this win. Congrats, queen!

---

**Overall average**: 7.939

---

**TragicKingdom1**: This is the best EP in the rate imo. The bops have crazy good production and great hooks, and even the slower-songs fit the mood and don't drag whatsoever. I could not recommend this EP enough to anyone who appreciates pure pop music on steroids. [Grade: A]

**Bendariaku89**: this was great. the Kim Possible/Britney song was definitely the best song in this bunch. CSS and the two interludes were the next in line. Other than Ordinary Superstar and Afterlife, I loved every song in this EP and those interludes were TOO SHORT. TOO SHORT I SAY, they deserved a full song length!

**selegend**: rina is EVERYTHING we need from a pop star right now

**Krugo1**: I saw this on theneedledrop a while back in Fantano’s Top EPs of 2017, but I just got around to checking it out. It had a decidedly “classic” pop sound (the opener “Ordinary Superstar” gave me distinct ‘90s vibes). The mini-album as a whole featured stellar vocals, great nostalgic instrumentation, and also dealt with the interesting dichotomy between anxiety and similar disconnections from other people in a digital age (though also praising them for allowing people with anxiety to avoid the awkwardness of real interactions). The interludes were weaker than the rest of the songs for me, but I liked all of the full tracks quite a bit

**shineflyer**: this is so early 00s. did she time travel here

**Banananaise**: Rina is a strong and shiny pop diva and i want to be her slave. anyway this is a good EP

**RandomHypnotica**: Easily the best album in this rate, Rina is miles above the competition here, a true pop-star in the making, and exploring what feels like exciting new territory.

**thatgreekguyraul**: I came in not knowing one damn thing about this artist and I left adding several of her songs on my playlist, which I rarely do. I honestly do not understand why Rina does not have more recognition, her songs are catchy and they would do well in top 40 radio. But seeing how much rap is dominating the game right now, I can see why she is still relatively obscure. I really hope she earns more stardom, this record was well-above average.

**Mysario**: if you told me this came out around the time the first NOW cd came out, I would believe you. the 90's R&B style in this is adoring

**cyborglilith**: The individual songs sound great, but the album is uncohesive and unremarkable.

**Leixander**: best EP of 2017, no questions

**PuggleMaster**: SHE DID THAT!!!!!

**tf2manu994**: If I wanted this style of music I'd listen to kpop. no  im not racist its just this style of music, not even the lyrics, just the vocal tone, and also the instruments or something im trying to dig myself out of a hole i can see myself being in because i said that i should delete that but im invested now soo

**Yatcho**: The most incredibly refreshing pop album of the entirety of 2017. Clarence Clarity is an absolute genius and Rina is the perfect outlet for his quirky production. The rest of these EPs seem so basic in comparison

**karenthecockpitpilot**: I'M SHOOK HOW HAVE I IGNORED HER

**patronsaintofaspies**: I had a hard time getting used to this EP, just like Julia's, but after I got used to Rina's style of music I ended up loving it. This is such a refreshing combination of British and Japanese pop music tied in with pure bubblegum pop melodies from the early 00s, and it pays off big time. There are a few duds that mess with the momentum, but it's definitely one of the best EPs in this rate, if not the best.

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: wow ok she really nailed the 2000’s Max Martin pop sound

**theburningundead**: I really think Rina is in a league above the others in this rate, this was without a doubt one of my favourite releases of 2017 and it's honestly hard to fault. She perfectly combines a nostalgic throwback to the early 2000s with the sentiment of the internet age and manages to sounds fresh and innovative while doing it

**Elitefourbrad**: An excellent debut from and upcoming pop girl.

**henry413**: AOTY. Please be the girl that fulfilled the pop girl prophecy.

**twat\_brained**: Definitely one to watch in the next few years

**whatareblackhole**: This EP is a little overrated, in my opinion, but I can see how it garners its praise. RINA does a spectacular job of weaving retro sounds and modern moods together, bringing your favorite aesthetic blogs to life through its songs. Where I think my disconnect is is in those modern moods, those technologically tense bouts of anxiety throughout her lyricism. I think it’s difficult to pull off writing about technology and social media as it is always changing, and Rina addresses this paradox in a way that’s familiar and frustrating. This is a great EP.
