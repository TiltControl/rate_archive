**followingfreeways** (8): its so much julia michaels it hurts but i dont hate it

**nooodisaster** (2): Perhaps the most generic song I've ever listened to that's pretending to be "personal". Like somehow there are so many words yet they say nothing besides that Selena is on meds. Julia Michaels you know you did her dirty charging for this.

---

#fun people

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): An unexpected favorite! Selena sounds so fun and flirty and that “you look like… fun” part is so, well, fun!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is so FUN PUN INTENDED i don't understand the hate

**ReallyCreative** (9): the way this song is exactly like the title... Kinda Crazy Kinda Couldn't!

**vayyiqra** (9): This song is fun! *(Refuses to elaborate; leaves)*

**welcome2thejam** (9): The pick me up the back half of this album needs

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): a grower

**flava** (8): it’s a little fun

**slimboyfriend** (8): Hands to Myself for the mentally ill girlies

**daythreeinmiami** (7.5): This song is fun.

**impla77** (7.2): This is catchy and disposable, just like the relationship!



**bespectacIed** (7): lived up to its name!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is the natural next step of being sick of that same old love.


#boring 

**fadedblue09** (7): the chorus sounds so awkward…feels too bright compared to the rest of the song

**Frelock\_** (7): Not super fun, but light and upbeat

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): i forgot how this album kinda dragged at the end

**goodbyesindisguise** (6): depending on my mood I either love it or hate it

**hikk** (6): Julia Michaels

**IIIHenryIII** (6): that was fun


**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): this feels like a Sweetener Pharrell song without the free-flowing energy. Just because “fun” is on the label doesn’t make it so!

**1998tweety** (5.5): do we hate fun? maybe.

**jasparghhh** (5.5): this song does not live up to its name unfortunately

**RandomHypnotica** (5.3): nowhere to be found in this album

**sydschoon** (5.2): meh

**anothertown** (5): corporate

**horridhendy** (5): It's fine but this sound is getting repetitive at this point in the album

**ImADudeDuh** (5): “kinda crazy” & “fun”? Oh she’s taunting the listener at this point

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (5): ngl it does feel like some of these tracks were stuck on the end as filler, this is just so boring

**sage** (5): inaccurate title haha

**TiltControls** (5): if only

**AHSWeeknd** (4): sometimes ghost writers are okay.

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): this song is zero fun, unless you really like shopping malls

**Bordersz** (3.5): Sounds like a teenager wrote this in Algebra II class while bored. It's bad. Waste of great production.

**bluetriangles04** (3): I remember hearing this the first time and fucking HATING IT! Now, it's still not good or anything but I'll spare it of the 0 I had in my back pocket.

**pig-serpent** (3): This song is very fun if you like sleeping and have insomnia.

**runaway3212** (3): this song is neither fun nor good

**aldwin\_is\_here** (2): there's a funnier activity after listening to this and it involves removing this song from the tracklist after the deluxe edition dropped and pretending it never existed.

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): It's funny how she sounds like she's having zero fun at all

**bogo** (1): girl do you know what fun is cause it isn't this

**cremeebrulee** (0): it's comical how bored she sounds on this

**DaHumanTorch** (0): i did not in fact have fun

**Stryxen** (0): this chorus is horrid help. I HATE fun

#tonight... we are young

**CrimsonROSET** (8): me looking at jack antanoff and recognizing him from the early 2010s indie band with hits such as we are young and some nights:


**throwaway-7650** (7.5): and jack antonoff?

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): jack antonoff joke idk

#so good so good so fucking real

**oscarbrierley1** (6): de-yassified janelle monae song

**akanewasright** (7): this is solid but I keep thinking like… this melody is well tailored to Selena’s voice, but I think someone with more of a belt would’ve eaten this instrumental up. Like I’m comparing this to make me feel by Janelle, whispering over the funky shit can work as a tease if you bring the heat later in the song

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Sometimes it feels like Selena thinks she's smarter than she is.

**followingfreeways** (6): sadly very forgettable

---

#[ i do know her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IbqD_WBRfc) 

**vayyiqra** (10): Very weird to hear this after "A Sweeter Place" which really should be the closing track but anyway I like this song a lot! despite my irrational dislike of the word "people" which she repeats way too many times but otherwise I like it a lot!

**TiltControls** (9): a wish the drops hit a bit harder, but definitely the standout track in the back half of the album for me

**1998tweety** (8.5): i know the lyrics are kinda basic but the beat eats

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): the wordplay here is cute, wish the instrumental was a little more exciting

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): pipo u no, pipo u kno (5×)

**pig-serpent** (7): That part where the song explodes (with the la las) is pretty cool, maybe my favorite moment on the album.  I wish the rest of the song lived up to that moment.

**bluetriangles04** (6.5): that repetitive chorus STRIKES AGAIN! I don't absolutely find it appalling though this time, I feel like the verses are pretty solid and make up for it, also that drop in the chorus does work, at least for me.

**emayzee** (6.3): this stretch of the album is becoming a chore

**impla77** (6.3): I’m getting acclimatised to the blandness

**bespectacIed** (6): H&M fitting room EDM trash but sue me, I kinda like it

#[idk her](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c1df62089fb286bfb12910d30eae0e6d4478d88/0_29_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a6c35cec59ffca8b5e70ca296ade36e0)

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Love the lyrics but the production doesn’t really seem to match the vibe, like I wish it had more of a somber mood. Feels like this is just something Selena churned out for the *13 Reasons Why* soundtrack.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): when she repeats the chorus that’s when it really hits, which is a shame

**LesApfels** (6): I was going to rate this higher because of the production but she repeats that line into oblivion and it isn't even a particularly good one

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (6): bit boring, not a fan of the repetitive chorus

**runaway3212** (5.5): this is the most nothing song ever

**CrimsonROSET** (5): you worked and disney and are just now realizing this

**fadedblue09** (5): feels like they run out of lyrics to write after a minute

**seanderlust** (5): finally! we have an answer to the question scientists have been asking for decades: what if bad blood by taylor swift was boring instead of annoying

**slimboyfriend** (5): do you think that she thinks that people you know can go from people you know to people you don’t

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Wait what was that Selena? Can you repeat that one more time?

**cremeebrulee** (4.6): the strangers-friends-lovers-strangers gif format that had tumblr in a chokehold-core

**ignitethephoenix** (4.5): I like the theme but the execution is kind of poor

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): this is like equal parts a Katy Perry and MARINA song and not in the good way

**jackisboredtoday** (4.2): this has one singular good line and a total of zero other interesting things in its favor, i can squint and see this being turned into something passable but

**AHSWeeknd** (4): now what on earth was this??

**akanewasright** (4): There’s just nothing here

**bogo** (4): pee pole can go from pee pole you know to pee pole you don't

**Bordersz** (4): A bit forgettable.

**DaHumanTorch** (4): "people can go from people you know to people you don't" is something i'd write in my 2nd grade english class and my parents would hang it up on the fridge with a magnet

**dreamingpastel** (4): "From people you know to people you don't" is just not a good line

**goodbyesindisguise** (4): I used to dig it but the repetition is honestly too much

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): this is pure filler

**jasparghhh** (3): it's like they related to Katy Perry's Small Talk and said "what if we made it super repetitive and objectively worse"

**welcome2thejam** (3): She found one fine line and drilled that mf into the ground

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): yeah let's run this one back to the writing camps babes

**sydschoon** (2.2): sorry I hate the chorus

**Stryxen** (2): I'm so tuned out this is mind numbing. Someone had to point out to me how terrible the chorus lyrics are and they really ARE

**Awkward\_King** (1): me when i get amnesia

**frogaranaman** (1): ?????? yea no shit girl

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): This song describes me going from a really strong stretch of songs to this mega-snoozer.

**jasannn** (0): she sounds like a teen having a revelation on twitter

**oscarbrierley1** (0): sounds like a chainsmokers song (derogatory).

Here it is! My very own 0<3 Honestly I don't think I have much to say about why I dislike it, I think it's just soooo slow and boring, and on top of that Demi is just grating here. I'm not sure if it's their fault, yes, they do have a tendency to oversing, but honestly I just think that in this specific case the melody is just obnoxious and the production is so bland and boring and Lil Wayne brings literally nothing to this table. Getting through this song just feels like homework and I can only imagine this is what R&B sounds like for people that claim to hate the genre.
 
---

**nooodisaster** (7.5): This song had the biggest chokehold on me in 2017.

---

#popular and has many friends

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): [We as a society did NOT talk enough about that one concert where Demi kissed/straddled Kehlani while performing this…](https://youtu.be/FeDBi87zXRo?t=143) anyways this is my favorite song on the album. Not really the kind of song that people associate with Demi but she owns it, the way they just GROWL out the *lonely* is incredible, and if it were just them it would be a ten but then the Lil Wayne verse kicks in and the song just transcends.

**bogo** (10): it's no "the price is wrong" but i'll take it

**Nerfeveryone** (7): for the clean version, which is much better

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I don't even like this song, I'm just giving this a good score cause I'm floored by the fact that I thought there was a SZA feature on the second verse

#loner

**AHSWeeknd** (6): the trap beat throws me off

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I’m a little bored but I’m also whelmed.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): you want me to believe lil wayne listens to toni braxton

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): my least favorite song, just meanders and Lil Wayne isn’t a good mesh for this song. Sadly by the 2010s he had a spotty track record with features. He’s much better on Solange - Mad

**daythreeinmiami** (6): Lil Wayne confirmed a nature stan.

**Frelock\_** (6): Got distracted while listening to it

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): you know what this needs…. A sensual doja feature instead of that man


**PretentiousPegasus** (5): if I had a nickel for every time a former child star managed by scooter braun released an annoying yodel song called Lonely, I would have 2 nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice.

**akanewasright** (4): truly wild how one of the worst songs on the (standard) album is one of the only ones Demi didn’t write


**IIIHenryIII** (3): enough with the ballads, give us the bops


**MassiveThief** (3): this feels exactly as mid as the ariana/lil wayne song from DW, which is funny because that album also has "Leave Me Lonely". they're in together on some weird mid-off conspiracy

**Stryxen** (3): how kind of her to put me to sleep for the duration of this song so I wouldn't feel lonely too ❤️

**goodbyesindisguise** (2): that producer tag threw me off so much and then the song went nowhere

**horridhendy** (2): It's a hard no.


**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): boring would be a more appropriate adjective

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): this song just feels entirely devoid of personality


**pig-serpent** (0): This song is just nothing for 5 minutes.

# wait this has a feature?

**seanderlust** (10): great verse from lil wayne, somewhat forgettable verse from demi. also if the rumors are true that the last two songs were about nick jonas then demi shoehorning in a song about their ex like "oh yeah, you're there too :)" i'm hollering

**Treecoh** (10): I just know popheads is gonna drag Lil Wayne on this but he's so goooooooood on this type of track. and I love the "I never see the forest for the trees" lyric callback to Nightingale.

**Darkknuckles** (9): Love how slow and vulnerable this song is. It gets the lonely vibe so well and lil waynes verse is so good.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (8): I almost lowered my rating bc of the lacklustre Lil Wayne feature

**ReallyCreative** (8): Lil Wayne's verse is so funny I'm sorry

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): I was really enjoying this song but Lil Wayne verse is really bad and I’m not even a hater (I love Let Me Love You on Dangerous Women so)

**flava** (7.5): lil wayne showed up on two ex act’s albums in consecutive years like the generous king he is

**Frajer** (7.5): did they wake Weezy F Baby up from a nap and drag him into the studio

**cremeebrulee** (7.1): no feature credits on this so lil wayne was a jumpscare adhgshjdg

**bluetriangles04** (7): lil wayne features always worry me ever since that "she grindin on this Grande" line but this wasn't particularly bad and the rest of the song was pretty good!

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): this 7 is for Lil Wayne and Lil Wayne alone

**welcome2thejam** (7): Solid but honestly all I can think about is them chopping up the Mustard on the beat tag at the start. Wtf Lil Wayne is here???

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): enjoyable enough but there's no reason for the lil wayne feature it's not 2009

**sydschoon** (6.2): I like the soft beat mixed with demi's vocals and storytelling on this track, but I think it would be better without the Wayne feature

**1998tweety** (6): shes cute but the lil wayne feature feels so weird

**jackisboredtoday** (6): you will NEVER be let me love you… especially not with wayne phoning in his verse like this

**NotWith10000Men** (6): weezy actually improved this song

**runaway3212** (6): lil wayne saved this

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): lil wayne really knows how to deflate collabs with these pop girls

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (5): Lil Wayne makes no sense on this song, but it was pretty boring before his bit so this might actually be an improvement tbh

**Hulnia** (4): lil wayne verse is hilarious fsr

**impla77** (4): from the little I understood from Lil Waynes verse.. is the ass connected to the heart in some way I don’t know?

**jasannn** (3): lil wayne made this go from boring and generic to bad

**jsonphile** (3): I feel this is going to get clobbered because of Lil Wayne, and yeah this is a pretty weak verse from him but also the song is just…unpleasant. I guess that’s to match the lyrics but like…you can have a depressing sound to your music and still sound good this just sounds bad

**ImADudeDuh** (2): they chose lil wayne as a feature here huh

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): this wasn’t even good before Lil Wayne jumped on it

**nt96** (0): Lil Wayne sounds like he’s fighting tears as he’s held against his will

...yeah, sure. I personally think there's some other Demi songs that should be in this spot rather than this, but I do think this song suffers a lot from being Hitchhiker's ugly twin, who clearly was liked more by people as seen by the fact that it hasn't been eliminated yet. Multiple people also pointed out at that slave line, [and despite Demi's ancestry](https://hips.hearstapps.com/seventeen/assets/17/09/1488207372-untitled-1-6.jpg) I just don't think people were too comfortable to the usage of the word.

Anyway, I personally think having sex to Viva La Vida would be a blast, idk about yall.

---

**nooodisaster** (6): Not a good enough song to try what it's pulling.

#focus on me

**ReallyCreative** (10): The orange juice in my fridge

**runaway3212** (10): finally a bop

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): why is this section so slay all of a sudden

**indie\_fan\_** (9.7): for the longest time i thought Demi said "lock me up like dominatrix" and I'd be like "OHHHHHH SHIIIIT DEMI GETTING KINKY ALL OF A SUDDEN?!?!?!?" then i read the lyrics and realized she says "lock me up like I'm your slave". which is disappointing and not nearly as exciting

**jasparghhh** (9.5): great song but the last minute could have gone a lot harder than it did

**fadedblue09** (8.5): "make music till your moaning / from night until the morning" is a top moment of the album  for me

**dreamingpastel** (8): OK, Stockholm Syndrome by One Direction.

**Frajer** (8): horniest bop since Side To Side

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I too can relate to getting turned on by guys moaning

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): the final stretch of the standard album is Frank Ocean-ish but not as interesting as his work I fear

**daythreeinmiami** (7.5): Honestly having the rate due date drop so suddenly has me trying so hard to concentrate.

**bespectacIed** (7): seggs

**Frelock\_** (7): It had these really bombastic moments that I wanted more of

**plastichaxan** (7): The kid named concentr: Purr I know I did

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): this sounds very good i’m just trying to ignore that “lock me down like i’m your slave” lyric

#adhd

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): the vocoder here feels so out of place and distracting? just a lot of clashing happening... you could say it makes it hard to *concentrate*

**AHSWeeknd** (6): some of these lyrics 🥴

**goodbyesindisguise** (6): make music when you’re moaning okay okay wish it had a bit more somethin somethin to it though

**impla77** (6): serviceable if unexciting

**Stryxen** (6): I seriously have no idea how to rate this. Its boring , but fun. Its bad , but good

**akanewasright** (5.7): this is… pleasant but still one of the few boring moments on the album for me

**bogo** (5): oh fuck an acoustic guitar

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (5): some of the attempts to be like, sexy (??) are a bit off putting tbh...

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): pretty forgettable

**pig-serpent** (4): The flickering guitar line during the verses is cool, I just wish I liked the chorus.

**cremeebrulee** (3.9): something i have not been doing once during this song's duration

**sydschoon** (3.2): I think this track is a little too sexual lyrically for my taste

**bluetriangles04** (3): meh... really this gives me nothing

**horridhendy** (3): I really don't like the weird vocoder or whatever that effect is. Not for me.

**NotWith10000Men** (3): bonk

**sage** (2.6): um

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): me trying to sit down to do a rate

# as long as you're the driver im the hitchhiker

**1998tweety** (6): concentrate and hitchhiker sound way too similar and theyre back to back but im gonna drag this song instead cause of the slave line

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this and hitchhiker are the same song

**IIIHenryIII** (5): this is just deyassified Hitchhiker

**oscarbrierley1** (4): this and hitchhiker are the same song, but the verses on this feel really off.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): I feel like this and “Hitchhiker” fill exactly the same niche and I prefer “Hitchhiker”


# who else has fucked to coldplay??!

**throwaway-7650** (8): "coldplay on the radio" #THANKYOUBTS #BTSPAVEDTHEWAY

**emayzee** (7.2): no bc what coldplay song could've possibly been playing that made them so horny

**TiltControls** (7): so true demi - we need another coldplay rate

**welcome2thejam** (7): No go ahead, tell me what Coldplay song makes the sex jam playlist

**babadork** (6.2): Coldplay?

**anothertown** (6): you CANNOT write what your sex music is in a public forum. especially if it's coldplay

**nt96** (6): bet she was listening to Viva La Vida

**flava** (1): imagine body say without any tension and a reference to a coldplay song playing on the radio

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): the way i had to stop and google the lyrics "LOCK ME DOWN LIKE I'M YOUR SLAVE????" 😭 COLDPLAY ON THE RADIO???? DURING SEX???? 😭😭 this is hell

**vayyiqra** (10): I was going to do a "bit" where I pretended to be offended she said "crazy" and "insane" and claim it discriminates against the mentally ill (that's me), with the ironic subtext that Selena would not really do such a thing, but then felt this was unfunny. But anyway this song's good!

**Frelock\_** (5): I'm not crazy about this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I like the use of horns but the lyrics make me a little bit uncomfortable for some reason.

throwaway-7650: oh, rates are a subreddit activity we do every month! here's the link to the [rates wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-threads) for more info but tl;dr rates are, well, pretty self-explanatory in that we usually rate 3-4 albums with some common theme against each other. this is the [ex-acts most personal album yet rate](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/102hs06/exacts_most_personal_album_yet_rate_ariana_grande/), which features ex-acts of disney/nick (ari/demi/selena) and their "most personal album yet" + some loose singles for selena. this is a reveal thread, where the final results are revealed over the course of 3 days. the 11 refers to the fact that you have a single 11 (and 0!) to use on your most (and least) favorite song in the rate. otherwise, you can only score songs between 1-10 up to 1 decimal place.

generally, album rates will be comprised of only 3 albums because including any more would make the rate's length on the longer side (most rates have a deadline of around a month), but there are some rates with 4+ albums. there's also grabbags, which are rates where the songlist is more like a playlist with an overarching theme. obviously, this is a 3-album rate, but the rate that's due tomorrow ([all stars 6](https://redd.it/101lyu3)) is an example of a grabbag! you can check the aforementioned rate wiki for a list of all previous and upcoming rates.

Are you ready for this?! [ZIMZALABIM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz9ce85qFis). 암거나-거나-거나 쫓다 지치지 마 (yeah), 늘 바라-바라-바라봤자 꿈이 아냐 (haha)...

There's not really much to say about this. It was able to be the least controversial song in the rate, probably because the lowest scores it got were a 2.8, but given that it only got a few high scores, we can just take this song as a middle of the pack song, with not much to hate but even less to hate.

**nooodisaster** (8): It's good, like what can we say? NEXT.

#ready...

**1998tweety** (10): this song being on the target deluxe edition is criminal [2]

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Honestly a good way end to the album, I didn’t expect a solid closer

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Top tier biking song

**bluetriangles04** (8): honestly wasn't expecting to enjoy this one as much as I did! It's pretty solid, and a good closer for the album overall!

**Frelock\_** (8): I was ready for this to kick it up to 11, but it just didn't get there

**Lilacly\_Adily** (8): after a string of mid songs, I’m glad this album goes out on a positive note

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): for a second i thought i'd started listening to Rare

**IIIHenryIII** (7): the previous track fits better as a closer

**impla77** (6.7): sounds like a lovebomb to me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): this is pretty good but nothing super noteworthy

**sydschoon** (6.5): I like this but I can see why it’s a bonus track

#...or not

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Well these three deluxe tracks have been overall the epitome of mid…could have been worse!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): idk i dont think this song is there to be joked about but its also boring so i cant even comment on it much i’m just :man_standing:

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Cool story I guess

**akanewasright** (5): yeah this was a bonus track for a reason

**anothertown** (5): this song is friends with nice to meet ya and hey ya

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): this sounds painfully 2018 I fear in a way I’m not feeling

**goodbyesindisguise** (5): still deciding if it’s a nice or random way to end the album

**runaway3212** (5): we're simply not ready for it

**Stryxen** (5): It's giving a little but I'm still mad at smoke and mirrors for being a snooze that this tanks too... like a splash zone

**throwaway-7650** (5): literally only couldn't remember how this one goes so 5 it is

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): after a string of bad tracks this is pleasantly listenable!! why do i sound like such a pop hating indiehead in this rate im so sorry darj

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): that chorus is so bad, the way they say “I wasn’t ready for ya, then you come in like I adore ya” is just enunciated in a way that feels wrong? Like it feels uncomfortable in a way I can’t describe it

**pig-serpent** (3): This isn't terrible, especially compared to a lot of other Demi songs here, but I really don't know why it needed to exist.

**ROBBED!! STOLEN!! RIGGED!! IDGAF YOU CAN QUOTE ME ON THIS, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SONGS IN THIS RATE**

I'm not going to pretend like I don't understand where people that don't like this song come from, but I certainly won't agree with them. Are the lyrics perfect? No, though I personally feel like talking about weird lyricism in a rate with Ariana, Demi and Selena is misguided. I really think the production is pretty cool, not everyone likes it but the chopped up humming is pretty cool. Honestly it would have been a slay if someone with more dancing abilitieshad gotten it and done a nice breakdown to it, but by literally nothing in this world I would trade having the iconic AMA performance and Ajayll's reaction to it.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I’m about to misuse the word avant garde so bad rn…

**cremeebrulee** (10): its bad and i don't think there's a single, coherent thought in the lyrics, but the mm mm mms hit the right groove in my brain idk

**hikk** (10): omg i loved this when it came out it's a bop idgaf. i don't listen to it much anymore but i'm giving it a 10 cuz she needs it i just know.....

**ignitethephoenix** (10): beautiful gorgeous girlies are giving this song a 9 or higher.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this was the blueprint to something, i don’t know what, but it was

**plastichaxan** (10): I don’t care this is so fun I love her mm mmm mmm shit

**runaway3212** (10): i've said this so many times. the intention behind selena gomez is not to make good songs it is to critique and subvert what it means for music to be "good". it's not "bad", it's post-good...

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes. Yes I really like this song this much. Yes including the cut-up vocal part. *Especially* that part, even. Yes I know she cannot sing it live. So? Can you?

**fadedblue09** (9): better

**akanewasright** (8.3): thinking about how the producer of the song willingly revealed that Selena couldn’t do the “mm-mmm-mmm” part in the studio and they had to splice together some clips to make it work (around the [25 minute mark](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/switched-on-pop/id934552872?i=1000465258250))… that’s the moment I realized that Selena actually can’t sing and that none of the drags were at all hyperbolic

**jasannn** (8.3): She’s slaying yet giving absolutely nothing simultaneously. Idk how she does it.

**1998tweety** (8): she bops

**bluetriangles04** (8): you wouldn't have found me defending this when it released but honestly listening to it now I really like it, specifically the last minute or so of it.

**daythreeinmiami** (8): Justice for this song. I don’t understand the hate for it.

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (7.5): actually like this a lot more than I remember! The mm-mm chorus is much less annoying than I remember

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): should probably file this under "songs that are kinda bad but i like anyway"

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): wow..

**seanderlust** (6.5): look at her now... [watch her go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OzdZVWaB6w)

#[i am looking away](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ERmrXR3WkAAOTzg.jpg:large)
**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): watch her go, nuh-uh-uh-naur-hah-hah-no-nevermind.

**slimboyfriend** (6): diet choreo queen

**jackisboredtoday** (5.2): still a massive lol at the second verse to this being maybe the only moment on the album you could even imagine being about the weeknd relationship after he did a whole EP about it

**AHSWeeknd** (5): This was never good tbh

**CrimsonROSET** (4): i want to root for her but she also makes the most anoying song ever like what am i meant to do

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): I know they shot the music video on an iPhone but it kinda sounds like they recorded the song on one too.

**ReallyCreative** (3): something shifted with that bridge... but the samples of her eating at The Cheesecake Factory shifted it right back

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): that breakdown??? That’s not even goofy, it’s just AWFUL. I don’t know if I’m just anti-third person in songs, but the lyrics in this one feel so cliche and lazy - meant for people to be able to project their own feelings onto the song while also investing in Selena Gomez as a person but it falls flat because it struggles to make you care about either side.

**Hulnia** (1): that chorus is quite possibly the worst i’ve ever heard lol

**flava** (0): the worst chorus in the history of choruses

**goodbyesindisguise** (0): no.

**impla77** (0): I was already annoyed by Selena referring to herself in third person before that nonevent of a chorus(?) happened

**MassiveThief** (0): might be one of the worst choruses I've ever heard.

**NotWith10000Men** (0): the duality of woman

**RandomHypnotica** (0): that chorus registers in the same part of my brain as chewing noises

# mm mm mm mm im fearless

**bogo** (11): mmm mmm mmm

**throwaway-7650** (9.1): WATCHA LOOKING AT MM-MM-MM-MM I'M FEARLESS

**Frajer** (8): when she said mmm mmm mmm I felt that

**sydschoon** (7.2): mmmm mmmm mmmm

**Awkward\_King** (7): she saying mmm mmm mmm mmm so much like girl i know the food you made on that cooking show is not that good

**Stryxen** (7): m m m m m m m m

**jsonphile** (6): mmmmm mmmm mmmm mmmmm mmmm mmmm

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): m m m m m m m m

**welcome2thejam** (5): The mmm-mmm-mmm part is pretty brain numbing, but the background vocals popping in the second chorus might be the best single moment in the rate

**pig-serpent** (3.5): "Do You like this song?"  "Nnn nn nn Nnn nn nn nope"

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): it starts off cool but the mm-mm-mms…overall song is too machine-like for me and not in a slay way

**TiltControls** (2.5): the mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm part simultaneously dropped this to a low score for being bad but also raised it above 1 for being camp

**PretentiousPegasus** (0): was tossing up between this and TLIC for the zero, but the obnoxious “wow mmmm mmm mmm” pushed LAHN over the edge

**static\_int\_husp** (0): yass girl give us nothing. The monotone quiet singing, the robotic "mm mm"s, all of it.

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): who decided "mmmm mmmm mmmm" was a chorus?

#SALINA!!!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): mandatory SALINA move..... Even I am shocked at my score for this, but I think I stand by it. Initially I thought this was too bizarre and messy, but eventually I've grown to realize how experimental and deliberately disjointed this is? I'm obsessed, it's like controlled chaos. What an interesting song for sure. The final chorus is goddamn sublime!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): SALINA MOVE

**jasparghhh** (10): I didn't want to like this song but I ended up learning the choreo from the video so. SALINA MOVE.

If you Ctrl+F the word "Age", half of the comments are going to be highlighted, and rightfully so, Ariana and Pete were probably the two people on earth that couldn't see their likely demise coming, so when it was announced that she would be naming this song after him... it was just a matter of not too much time until we could all scoff at it whenever we looked at the sweetener tracklist.

This song is fine, I am sure that it would have likely done better had it been named... literally anything else, but is anyone going to war to defend this minute-long dedication to a man currently in the worst of graces of almost everyone? If anything this simply saved [redacted] of being the lowest rated sweetener song. 

---

**followingfreeways** (8): ok this is honestly a cute little interlude if she just changed the title to "happy" or something it would have been so much better..

**nooodisaster** (5): If this was called "Intro" I'd give it my 11.

#big dick energy

**AHSWeeknd** (10): it’s honestly a great song

**Awkward\_King** (10): he did nothing wrong

**bespectacIed** (10): I think this is my first ever 10 interlude, this is unfortunately so fucking good. "I thought you into my life, look at my mind (yuh)" is a perfect line, such a quintessential sweetener lyric

**cremeebrulee** (10): everyone giving this a low score because it “aged” badly or whatever, y’all are so stupid fr. the problem is that you took this song seriously from the get-go when really it’s just as much as a metaphor as the album title “sweetener” is. sure ariana says this is a love song, just like how she said sweetener is an album about finding happiness after hardship, but why should we trust her when she honestly has the worst taste in her own music? sweetener is all about the artificiality of the happiness she was experiencing at the moment, the facade that came undone when thank u, next rolled out. along those lines “pete davidson” is less about the guy and more about *convincing* herself that she has moved on and is completely satisfied in her relationship. just listen to that outro, does that sound completely genuine? she honestly sounds like she's repeating the phrase to herself until she starts to believe it. and she’s not even saying “i’m happy", she’s saying "i'm gonna be happy" like!!! she doesn't even have the happiness she claims she does rn, she’s trying to manifest it!!! anyway!!! this song only gets the hate it does because of its title, which is also really annoying cause it doesn’t even mention pete by name or any identifying characteristics, it's just a little snapshot of her feelings at the moment. idk there’s like genuine reasons to dislike this song, it’s short, it’s generic, whatever, i’m not even gonna die for it when it goes out day 1 but the aging argument just kinda makes me roll my eyes

**jasparghhh** (10): this is the perfect love song, I considered deducting a point for the title but you know what, Pete deserves it after dealing with all the backlash from his relationships the past few years

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): song title aged like milk but the song itself is still execellent

**runaway3212** (10): honestly im just really happy she was happy here

**soul-glitch** (10): Idc what anybody says about the lyrics, I like em

**Stryxen** (10): if you get it you GET it... It completely elevates the fake smile popstar meta concept of Sweetener her mind....

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): iconic song that now always gets heaps of upvotes in every AskReddit "what song didn't age well" posts

**akanewasright** (9): naming this song the way she did is the equivalent of tattooing a bf’s name on you… but the song itself is still really sweet and nice on the ears

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This should have just been called “Happy” or something because it’s actually a really cute interlude but it’ll never get the appreciation it deserves because it’s forever branded by whatshisface.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): the Jennifer Lopez “Dear Ben” of this generation, I stan the directness

**Bordersz** (8.5): Could be a 10 if it was longer. Big clown energy listening about being happy w/Pete lmao.

**jasannn** (8.5): when will someone make me this happy?

**bluetriangles04** (8): the worst thing about this song is that it's titled Pete Davidson

**CrimsonROSET** (8): yes this title aged badly but like holy shit this song

**dreamingpastel** (8): Its biggest flaw is actually the fact that it's so short.

**goodbyesindisguise** (8): you can’t make it not bop!!! I always come back for seconds

**vayyiqra** (8): Yes we know it "aged like milk" whatever. It's cute and she was happy! But too short. yuh

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): me when I get an extra chicken nugget in my meal

**impla77** (7.5): Sounds like a fairytale, I bet they lived happily ever after

**indie\_fan\_** (7.4): personal things aside, this is still cute

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (7): it's actually kind of sad how badly this aged

**nt96** (7): Pete rising to the top via dating women rich enough to own him is a remarkable storyline in the Popheads Cinematic Universe

**seanderlust** (7): well

**welcome2thejam** (7): Lovely, hope those two kids are doing alright together, I have not read celebrity news or been on twitter since August 17, 2018

#look at you, boy i invented you

**NotWith10000Men** (6.8): the "imma be happy happy" part is heartbreaking

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): how much higher would this average be had the titled it literally anything else

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): It’s cute! Even the title aging really badly is kind of endearing!

**bluehxrizon** (6): hopefully his future fiancees can bop to this

**bogo** (6): the milk has aged so much it can legally drink now

**Frelock\_** (6): Decent filler

**hikk** (6): when she announced the tracklist and literally everyone was like ... ari girl this title isn't gonna age well

**jsonphile** (6): uhhh

**oscarbrierley1** (6): unfortunate name, but its cute. i suppose naming a song after a boyfriend is like getting a tattoo of their name. just don't do it.

**throwaway-7650** (6): will the man or the song age more badly? only time will tell!

**TiltControls** (6): track naming aside, this is fine enough

**sydschoon** (5.9): beautiful dreamy interlude but she loses points for the title sorry it aged like milk

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): well

**ReallyCreative** (5): it's just not a fully fleshed idea, nor is it a particularly good interlude

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): interludephobia

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): She sounds like a literal child this is kinda gross

**RandomHypnotica** (4): it's fine, it's pleasant, but shorter than a pinkpantheress song, and the name really just eliminated any goodwill this song would've had

**anothertown** (3): this the type of shit to make me think "2018 Was Such A Simple Time Like if You Agree"

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): poor her

**pig-serpent** (3): I refuse to believe that "Pete Davidson" was a real person before 2022.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): lol

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): lmao

**fadedblue09** (2): lol

**static\_int\_husp** (2): lol. Lmao. Sorry girl

**aldwin\_is\_here** (1): this is so tragic that I'll forever skip this big dicked basic-but-kinda-sour-tasting milky patch off the box without a smile.

**daythreeinmiami** (1): We knew where this relationship was going the second it started don’t lie.

**frogaranaman** (1): this was a set up

**ImADudeDuh** (1): you’re not allowed to make fun of this track because his dad died in 9/11

**letsallpoo** (1): lol

**1998tweety** (0): this aged well

**IIIHenryIII** (0): who’s gonna tell her? Too late

What did Selena do to y'all? I really like this song. It is the type of chill song that can just blend into background, but once you pay attention to it, it really sticks with you. I hadn't replayed this song much but after a few listens I was left singing  "you-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo off my head now...". Also this has some very good lines; maybe I'm just an embarrassing alcoholic that loves to air out my dirty laundry the second I have a sip of alcohol, but the lyric "And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk..." felt not only very relatable but it gave Selena some character and gave us some context as to what's happening in the song. Idk,,, maybe it gotta grow on y'all.

---

**followingfreeways** (8.5): honestly underrated!!

**nooodisaster** (6): The entire standard version of this album is midtempo breakup songs, how do we bear this?!

---

**anothertown** (10): the bennie and the jets riff is foolproof END OF!

**bespectacIed** (10): This is so fucking good, I'm obsessed???? I didn't know she had this up her sleeve? Come on, Soulena Gomez

**fadedblue09** (10): very slick instrumental, also love the sassiness on this

**goodbyesindisguise** (10): it was my top played song of 2020 sooo yeah ! Love the beat, love the carefree energy.

**soul-glitch** (10): Official haircut soundtrack

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Did not expect this more r&b/soul leaning track from Selena but she kinda owns it? Color me surprised.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): selena could rule the charts with vibey songs

**sydschoon** (8.9): my personal fav from the record

**Bordersz** (8): Love the chorus esp the you oo oo part

**runaway3212** (8): so true *\blocks people who blocked me on discord while still pressing show message every time they say something*

**vayyiqra** (8): Used to think this was boring but it also is kind of droll. "I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk" lmao! Very funny stuff.

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): me looking at my hair on a bad day

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I feel like this had so much more potential

**TiltControls** (7.5): it's cut(e)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): this is okay.

**throwaway-7650** (7): why's this the only song she curses on... royalty-free ass beat

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Oh oh oooh!! This one is okay

**sage** (6.9): its cute

**1998tweety** (6): shes ok

**bogo** (6): me if i was a bad driver

**CrimsonROSET** (6): but she’s looking at yo o o o o o u

**Frelock\_** (6): heavy lyrics, but they're bogged down by a "meh" track

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): the consistent balance this album struck between good and unimpressive is baffling

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): added half a point for the guitar solo because it meant I didn’t have to hear her struggle through singing another song

**ImADudeDuh** (5): a large tv to my big toe in 5th grade

**seanderlust** (5): i feel like i don't have a lot of comments for this album's tracks because for a lot of them i'm just listening like ":) uh huh". it's nice enough! but in terms of eliciting any sort of reaction in me? nothing.

**AHSWeeknd** (4): Bad Liar’s cheap copy

**Awkward\_King** (4): ow

**ReallyCreative** (4): they really need each other to have a career huh

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): damn it i hate when songs have great verses and a subpar chorus. also how is this a 3 minute song feeling like 5 mins lol

**welcome2thejam** (4): The Pharrell Sweetener songs' non-union equivalent

**plastichaxan** (3.5): She should’ve cut this song off the album

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): not these “yo-hoo-hoos” in the same harmonic universe at Taylor’s “me-hee-hees”,,,this song deflates the album a bit for me, not into the chorus.

**oscarbrierley1** (3): i need the small soft voice pop girlies to stop tryig to these faux old school r&b songs, i'm looking at you to billie eilish. she just doesn't have a dynamic enough voice to make this kind of song sound interesting. it just sounds so drab.

**pig-serpent** (3): This is "Never Be the Same" if it was actually bad like all the Youtube critics claimed it was.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (0): the Wish version of Hair by Little Mix

**nooodisaster** (0): Oh my god this song. This has gotta be satan's ringtone. Effortlessly annoying, pointless, and shallow while also being loud, obnoxious, and dumb. The only reason this wasn't in H&M ads everywhere is because it wasn't a single.

---

#if you like it put a ring on it

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Another W for her sing-talk ability

**NotWith10000Men** (10): more pop songs need to do fun things with their line delivery like this

**1998tweety** (9): this was cunty [2]

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): You know acting cocky kind of works for Selena because she doesn’t have enough personality for it to be annoying.

**Darkknuckles** (9): The it girl of this album.

**frogaranaman** (9): this sounds like the rest of this album but somehow better ???

**goodbyesindisguise** (9): so fun !!

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (8.5): bop bop bop

**fadedblue09** (8): short but sweet

**horridhendy** (8): Damn catchy

**impla77** (8): This doesn’t sound like a Selena song, which I guess is maybe a good thing?

**sydschoon** (7.4): catchy

**Frelock\_** (7): Would make a fun ringtone

**oscarbrierley1** (7): her voice sounds interesting on this, not a bad thing. it sounds like she's actually trying to do something with her voice for once.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Ok I'm surprised I kinda don't mind this

**jasannn** (6.3): The puppets on a string rhyme brings this down a notch


#divorced

**bogo** (6): this is possibly the most vocal slayage selena has ever served on a track, but that does not mean a damn thing because it's selena gomez

**vayyiqra** (6): Despite my Selenator cringe, this song's kind of mid. The trumpets are an okay touch ... it's just that the chorus is bland and it's got filler energy.

**daythreeinmiami** (5.3): Look it’s a confusing vocal delivery but she owns it in the chorus.

**anothertown** (5): this sounds like what someone who hates musicals thinks musicals sound like

**IIIHenryIII** (5): still not sure about this one

**jasparghhh** (5): the discourse about Selena being manipulative because of this song was so wild to see

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): this album is just a misheard lyrics mine for me I guess

**Awkward\_King** (4): she thinks she did something here huh

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): she sounds good but the song is boring

**aldwin\_is\_here** (3): wow, this is horrible!

**bluetriangles04** (3): this song is SOOOO annoying to me im sorry... that guitar is nice at least but like... that chorus is just vomit.

**flava** (3): this one just sounds wrong and awkward

**ImADudeDuh** (3): how did she feel after recording this? Did she think she ate? Was she like “oh that’s definitely an album cut”? Did she feel proud of herself? How did you feel Selena?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): i don't hate this as much as i used to but still dislike it

**RandomHypnotica** (2): oh wow this is awful

**runaway3212** (1): imagine getting outsold by amber emberassing

#you know what this song reminds me of?...

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): why is this kind of sonically giving Cell Block Tango lmao

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): A few cringe lines here and there but damn if this doesn’t make me do a gay power strut. Normani kinda missed out by passing on this one.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (8): Sounds a bit like a copycat Havana but still it's nice

**cremeebrulee** (7.4): she was kinda in her cardi bag with this one

**emayzee** (6.2): this sounds like it would be in a commercial for a department store semi-annual sale in the year 2008 i can't explain it

**akanewasright** (6): thinking about how normani might have had this song at some point…

**pig-serpent** (6): Selena Gomez is a passable vocalist, but this sultry "Havana" knock off isn't in her wheelhouse, even if I think the song has potential without her.

**PretentiousPegasus** (6): this feels more like a Camila cabello song than a Selena Gomez song

**throwaway-7650** (5.9): this is just budget RAYE - the thrill is gone. with far less vocal ability

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Duffy with laryngitis

**welcome2thejam** (5): Selena Gomez is the Michael Jordan of not being able to pull off comparing herself to Michael Jordan

**indie\_fan\_** (4.5): Shakespeare was scared soon as he heard "I'm breaking hearts like a heart attack"


**bespectacIed** (2): An unfortunate casualty of the late 2010s Havanavirus

**TiltControls** (0): this sounds more like a meghan trainor song tbh (derogatory)

As a single gay man, out there in the dating market, I have been unable to find any guy that doesn't play League Of Legends anymore, so honestly I feel very seen by this track. Where are real men that go out and hunt and provide for their family? All boys do nowadays is charge they phone, eat hot chip, be bisexual, say questionable things on a videogames calls and lie.

---

**nooodisaster** (5): "I date... MEN" Definitely one of the lyrics of all time. A song that just reminds you, especially this late in the tracklist, Demi sometimes only has money for B-list songs.

**fadedblue09** (10): love the playful melody of this…sounds like a game indeed

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Demi gets it in a way very few artists do

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): outsold grimes

**bluetriangles04** (9): im sure if I played this in my car the speakers would cave in from the amount of bass and that's fine

**Frelock\_** (9): Loved the beat

**Treecoh** (9): its so basic but it bops

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): this is the most kehlani song ever and its not even a kehlani song.

**sage** (8.4): ate i fear

**bespectacIed** (8): BOP woah. I can hear Ariana singing this too

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): this production feels like it’s trying to have a Ginuwine - Pony sound. Not as good as that all-timer but still slay

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): a bit of a bizarre transition, and kinda generic bleh EDM production, but Demi's vocal delivery really shines

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This stands out awkwardly on the album and I usually skip it but at the same time I have a certain fondness for it because I used it as a transition song in a play I directed back in college.

**sydschoon** (7.5): nice beat, vocals banging

**AHSWeeknd** (7): 2017 and it’s damn trap beats on pop songs

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): On one hand this kind of sounds like ass. One the other hand for some reason I’m yassing.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): what the fuck was that voice at the start

**jasparghhh** (7): this song unfortunately has only become more relatable to me as I get played by more and more guys

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (7): I think this is one of the more praised deep cuts on the album from what I've seen online? I can definitely see why, I enjoyed this!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): its a bop

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): my friends when they find out i still play toontown and wizard101 in my 20s

**akanewasright** (5): this is the one song I’d really say is out of place, like I don’t think this belongs on the album

**bogo** (5): is it just me or is the production on this song just off

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Future R&B but make it loud and unpleasant

# 😛🚬

**Bordersz** (11): Singing like bills were due.

**1998tweety** (10): this song being on the target deluxe edition is criminal

**AHSWeeknd** (10): when Demi gets sad in songs it’s SAD-sad

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is a bop!

**Frelock\_** (10): Tugs at my heartstrings, and really imparts its emotions to me. I cry every time

**jasparghhh** (10): quick story I got the target deluxe so that I could have this song on my iPod, but like 2 months later I accidentally dropped my iPod in the snow and it got demolished by a snow blower so I didn't listen to this song again until it got put on streaming

**throwaway-7650** (10): this couldn't've gone between concentrate/hitchhiker?

**flava** (9): why is this better than any song on the standard edition, like demi, bestie, just put the good songs on your album in the first place, it’s not that hard

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This song is so terrifying, like emerging from a relationship and then realizing that maybe none of it, not even your feelings, was real… that’s such a nightmare. The melodies are lovely and I appreciate the sparse instrumentation, it gives the song a very contemplative vibe. Only thing I would remove is that section towards the end with all the belting and the harmonies, it doesn’t gel with the rest of it.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Love the minimal production

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): she's really at her best when she's a bit more subtle like this

**TiltControls** (8.5): it's good, but it's no imagine dragons

**Darkknuckles** (8): So beautiful.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Ooh, now that's smoky

**akanewasright** (7): I hadn’t heard this song much at all, I’m surprised I like it as much as I do.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): the chorus is gorgeous

**oscarbrierley1** (7): i go back and forth between liking the minimal production and wishing for more.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I think Demi's voice sounds best when they're not trying too hard to belt

**impla77** (6.2): this is fine but not standout

**CrimsonROSET** (6): Smoke + Mirrors is the second studio album by American pop rock band Imagine Dragons. The album was recorded duri

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): I’ve barely recalled the Target Exclusive bonus songs lkdskllsk. this is too low-energy for me, tho Demi sounds nice here

**runaway3212** (6): still better than imagine dragons

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): slight balladphobia

**sydschoon** (5.1): nice ballad but nothing groundbreaking

**anothertown** (5): i hate the soft little vine booms that producers use for percussion in songs like this. "oh its dramatic it sounds like heartbeats" no it sounds like a movie trailer

**bespectacIed** (5): ballad

**frogaranaman** (5): Imagine Dragons??

**goodbyesindisguise** (5): It feels like a song I could be really in to if the production was different - it’s just a bit too stripped back for me especially when Demi’s vocals are so strong

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Unfortunately Demi is not enough to save this comatosely boring instrumental.

**jsonphile** (4): I don’t have balladphobia but this song might give it to me

**letsallpoo** (4): why does this sound like need you now

**RandomHypnotica** (4): considering how good the rest of the more emotional cuts from the album were, it's easy to see why this was shafted to a deluxe

**slimboyfriend** (4): I know it’s supposed to be an emotional ballad but I need more than a piano and generic lyrics

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): again, forgettable

**bluetriangles04** (3): kind of boring. I think it also just mainly suffers from tracklist placement because this after instruction is such a shift... and not in a good way

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): okay so this just does nothing for three minutes… nice to know

**Stryxen** (3): I was so bored I forgot to rate this

**Hulnia** (2): it’s giving fingers crossed

**pig-serpent** (1): Instruction convinced me that the Demi bonus songs were going to shift gear and all be insanely good, and this song broke my heart.

**followingfreeways** (10): selena is not known for her voice but i LOVE how her tone is in this song. and i think its very cute.

**nooodisaster** (5): This does emulate the feeling of there be only 2 people, because the production is so barren.

---

#extrovert that loves parties

**bespectacIed** (10): My 11 contender. Her best song, and I'm fucking serious. I love how Save Your Tears' opening line references this if we're being delusional lol. Great 6lack verse too. Need Selena to do a full RnB album, if this is the material. I AM OBSESSED WITH THIS my god

**vayyiqra** (10): This song's beautiful. Yes including the rap. Deal with it, Popheads.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): there can be 100 people in a room

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): There’s something about this one that just feels so… intimate? Like it sounds like Selena is really close to the microphone, singing directly to me. Some of my favorite production on the album too, it’s almost like a jazz lounge song.

**Bordersz** (8.5): 6lack really added to the song.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): I was feeling it was too sparse but I’m a sucker for a nice harpsicord-sounding moment which happens in the second chorus. 6lack sounds great as usual. The song is a nice vibe. Love the punchier drums in the back-half

**Darkknuckles** (8): so sultry

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i do love a subdued bop and selena is great at them

**throwaway-7650** (8): there can be 100 people in a crowded room and 99 of them leave but all it takes is 5 of them to come back for it to go back to 6(lack) [on a related tangent: omg I love that amy winehouse song!]

**welcome2thejam** (8): Would've liked a stronger ending, but overall a nice, warm track

**1998tweety** (7.5): served

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): sounds very similar to a couple of songs I’ve heard by her

**indie\_fan\_** (7.5): Selena does fine enough, but 6lack steals the show

**sydschoon** (7.5): chill vibes, I think the feature works well

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): this is like, boring, but in a good way.

**Frelock\_** (7): Nice. Nice. Not thrilling, but nice.

**flava** (6.5): 6lack and Selena have a very similar energy and i kinda want to hear more collaborations between them

#social anxiety

**AHSWeeknd** (6): 6LACK carried tbh

**bogo** (6): there can be 100 people in a room and 99 don't believe in you but all it takes is one

**CrimsonROSET** (6): 6lack matches selena's vibe, i still do not know if that is a compliment

**ignitethephoenix** (6): don’t love her higher register and this is kind of boring

**runaway3212** (6): haha like the artist

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): the feature kinda reminded me how much this album blends

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): If there’s a Lady Gaga quote section put me in it pls.

**bluetriangles04** (5): somehow this song simultaneously went on for both too long and not enough, It's just in a weird in-between for me of it being either a good song and just... there I guess.

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): there could be a hundred people in a room…

**Hulnia** (5): don’t really care about most of the song but i liked the feature

**TiltControls** (5): this is the opposite to the previous track where selena actually sounds great here, but is let down by a pretty barebones production on the track

**fadedblue09** (4): repetitive filler

**ReallyCreative** (4): this is just a boneless version of Me + U by Cassie

**goodbyesindisguise** (3): the clapping beat is way too much

**oscarbrierley1** (3): yawn

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): I hate how repetitive ALL of these songs on this album are

**MassiveThief** (2): horrifically boring

**Stryxen** (2): this is so boring omfg nothing at all happens. Not offensively bad at least

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): the whole time this was playing i genuinely forgot to score and i think that sums up its blandness perfectly!!

**pig-serpent** (1.5): Why does the beat disappear when 6lack comes on?  Minimalism is a disease.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): maybe if Bebe Rexha kept her good songs for herself, she wouldn’t have to recycle 90s dance hits to chart


**akanewasright** (6): Bebe Rexha wrote this song and… it’s truly remarkable how mid this song is while still being distinctly better than almost all of her recent output

**slimboyfriend** (5): didn’t like it then saw Bebe Rexha wrote it and I was like “oh that checks out”

**nooodisaster** (9): Initially I think I liked this song just because it signaled the end of the standard album (I swear I'm not biased :D). But now this just genuinely snaps for me. Kid Cudi sounds uh, bad, but beyond that. Genuinely snaps.

**followingfreeways** (7): part of me loves the little melody of this song and another slightly smaller part of me every fiber of this song and its very intense.

# the ~~good~~ sweet place

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is suchhhh a good figure and almost my eleven

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): this is her best album track to date. ethereal, joyful, and really heartwarming considering her battles with her health

**vayyiqra** (10): :hanawinsSad:

**daythreeinmiami** (9.5): I remember when this album first dropped, so many really disliked this song. I hope attitudes towards this song have shifted as I’ve always loved it and I feel like it’s underappreciated.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Sweetener place. Is that something?

**Frajer** (9): Kid Cudi you will always be famous

**Frelock\_** (9): I really appreciate the hopefulness of this song

**runaway3212** (9): this is a bop but im still mad this isnt the last song on the album it's such a good closer

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): this album's strength is really in the production. the cudi feature is very unnecessary

**sydschoon** (8.5): beat goes hard, Cudi feat goes hard

**1998tweety** (8): this lowkey ate

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): I like how dark it "sounds", even though the feature is darker.

**bespectacIed** (8): REAL music. Cudi verse so bad though lol he sounds grating

**bogo** (8): trying to come up with a funny joke and all i can think of right now is "a sweetener place"

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Always a sucker for songs with references to sweetness, I think appealing to taste is an underrated lyrical tool.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): so sweet

**MassiveThief** (8): not a crossover I ever expected to see

**impla77** (7.6): This is sweet enough, even though Kid Cudi really phoned it in

**flava** (7.5): that moaning production noise is doing a lot, and I mean A LOT of heavy lifting

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): she's trying to piggyback off sweetener's goodwill here huh

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): this just sounds a kid cudi scrap nobody else wanted

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): this should’ve been the lead single over LYTLM/LAHN

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This one bops a bit

**welcome2thejam** (7): Lmao a few seconds in and yeah this definitely sounds like a song that's about to feature Kid Cudi alright

#the ~~bad~~ sour place

**bluetriangles04** (6.5): it's decent enough, the chorus is memorable for me at least and Cudi's feature didn't really feel out of place. at the same time, it's a little more boring. I can see myself enjoying it while not paying too much attention to what I'm listening to.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (6.5): I’d given it a 7 but Kid Cudi’s part ruined it

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Love the production but hate the vocals.  Pretty emblematic of this album.

**throwaway-7650** (6.1): most of selena's songs staring at day 3:

**CrimsonROSET** (6): ‘kid cudi saves a song about the rapture’ is not a sentence i thought i’d write coming into this album

**jasannn** (6): I wish the album ended here with bad liar and fetish included somewhere in between.

**slimboyfriend** (6): this is basically just a kid cudi song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): have you considered the place is called Sweetener

**AHSWeeknd** (4): what, who made the decision to butcher the production here

**goodbyesindisguise** (4): its not terrible it’s just so forgettable?

**Stryxen** (4): there's some cool ideas. Selena sounds so bored and I can't say it doesn't rub off on me too

**horridhendy** (3.5): Struggling to explain why but I really just wanted to turn this off.

**plastichaxan** (3): Men ruin everything even when they’re not singing like she was not trying

**ReallyCreative** (3): Selena what the hell are you letting them do to your voice... this is not flattering. Kid Cudi saves this from 0 territory

**Awkward\_King** (2): im sorry i have to do this kid cudi

**Darkknuckles** (2): no not this

**Hulnia** (2): what exactly is it that people like about kid cudi? he’s one of the most boring rappers out there fr

**oscarbrierley1** (2): the chorus gives kids bop and it drags on forever.

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): nope

**jasparghhh** (0): idk why this song just really grates on me

**followingfreeways** (8): when it bangs it bangs

**nooodisaster** (5): Take all the joy out of Pharrel's production, leave the weird or ugly sounds, and put in a Missy who only had 30 minutes to write her verse, and you get Borderline.

---

#in the borderline

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I don’t know how people don’t vibe with this, it’s amazing.

**Bordersz** (10): I love the throwback vibes to it. Peak 2000s rnb-pop.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Ranking this one based off of how much I enjoy it rather than how good I think it is… ^fresh ^grapes

**sage** (10): top 10 ari song

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): I can't in good conscience give this a 10 so

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): its nearly perfect. the chorus is catchy, the beat is fun and interesting, it has the fun cowbells. the missy verse is a little short, that's my only issue.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): I remember when this was released and popheads lost their minds on how bad this sounds and that Pharrell was a bad producer and now everyone’s going for that 2000s sound bwahahaha

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): I didn’t get this one the first time ngl. BUT I GET IT NOW

**emayzee** (8.7): her saying "im the wifey type" and then ending her engagment like a month later

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This song is a little bit of a mess but it’s fun!

**dreamingpastel** (8): I'm docking points for the ice cream line.

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (8): some of the lyrics are questionable (wifey type??) but I can and will ignore them because this is such a bop

**seanderlust** (8): i wanted this to slap so badly. it's good! but that's about all i feel for it. it sort of feels like each artist, producer included, phoned it in which it's like WHY! you are three legends!!! (pokes with a stick) do something!!!

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): I remember not like this one when it came out but I'm into it now

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): Missy spilled! fresh grapes are SO good

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): this is where the production gets a little tired but missy's verse more than makes up for it

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): "wish you'd chew on me like fresh grapes" kinda never leaving my mind now

**Frelock\_** (7): Borderline good

**bigbigbee** (6.5): the missy feature is honestly a flex, not everyone can get the queen

#out of the borderline >!i struggled to come up with a joke sorry!<

**1998tweety** (6): shes cute filler

**goodbyesindisguise** (6): it’s my best friends fave on the album so I have to respect it

**cremeebrulee** (5): peaks with pharrell's 4 count if we're being honest

**runaway3212** (5): not every song can be the clit of the album

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): is Pharrell stuck in 2011???

**indie\_fan\_** (4): i get clothing shop music vibes from this

**jsonphile** (4): this production here makes me, to quote the better borderline song “feel like I’m going to lose my mind”

**TiltControls** (4): feels more like an interlude than a full song to me for some reason

**sydschoon** (3.8): Pharrel did it again…and not in a good way

**impla77** (3): well at least one ariana song will go out day 1

**MassiveThief** (3): kind of a mess

**pig-serpent** (3): In middle school a girl took my phone and put her number in it as "My Wifey :)"  Do you all think she was into me?  This was 14 years ago, do I still have a chance?

#wait this has a feature?

**Stryxen** (10): Missy understood the assignment idc this all works so well together .. the song feels like it's constantly about to climax which is a fitting vibe for these lyrics

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): missy's feature is literally blink and you'll miss it (also i thought until rn it was "jason you know I won't stop trying"

**akanewasright** (8): Missy turning in one of her lowest energy verses for this song kinda kills me…

**nt96** (8): the way Missy is on here for like….2 seconds??? Hilarious

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): This should be so much better for the star power of this collab

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): why this song wasting Missy Ex's precious time?

**CrimsonROSET** (7): missy always makes everything better even if she only gets like three syllables

**jasparghhh** (7): an Ariana and Missy collab should have been and deserved to be much better

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's good but WHY is Missy only here for like five seconds... what a waste of her talent, in another universe this is the easiest 11 ever

**bespectacIed** (6): It's fun, it's nothing serious, but neither Ari or Missy were doing their best here

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): it's not bad it just doesn't do anything and missy's verse is wasted

**vayyiqra** (6): "Objectively" this is pretty underwhelming and repetitive and yes it has a mediocre verse that was a waste of Missy's feature (what feature? I blinked and missed it) but I kind of like it anyway for reasons beyond my understanding. Petition to stop naming pop songs "Borderline" though we have more than enough! yuh

**hikk** (5): the only major flop on the album, what a waste of a missy  feat

**Lilacly\_Adily** (5): I needed more Missy

**flava** (5.5): Missy Elliott really came out of retirement for like 20 seconds

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Why does Missy sounds British

**IIIHenryIII** (4.5): why do people keep featuring Missy in such shitty tracks? sorry, Pharrel, but this time you failed

**NotWith10000Men** (4): missy sounds like she doesn't wanna be there and neither do I

**PretentiousPegasus** (4): filler, missys verse was bad

**Darkknuckles** (3): Girl, why. Ari's hair is longer than missy elliot's verse.

**daythreeinmiami** (3): I was so disappointed by that Missy verse. That was waaayyy too little Missy.

**welcome2thejam** (3): Oh hell no, major points deducted for poor use of Missy

**fadedblue09** (1.5): Missy having collabs  with both Ariana and Demi….and both of them also suck ugh her mind

#saw the light

**flava** (11): i think i speak for everyone who gave this an 11/10 that we don’t know why this works, it just does

**hikk** (11): this is going to flop but i need to live my truth

**horridhendy** (11): I will go to my grave not understanding why other people don't like this song.

**Hulnia** (11): best sample of all time

**oscarbrierley1** (11): So bouncy and fun, it still sounds fresh today. The h8rs just don't get it. Is the Nicki verse just Chun Li leftovers? Yes. Its still great and full of quotable lines.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): it's impossible for me to state just how great this song is. Nicki's verse opening is great, the "you wouldn't let anybody speak" sample is honestly really catchy, idc what anybody says, and the pre-chorus is absolute crack. The production feels just so perfect, and it's just so loopable. THIS is cunt music.

**Stryxen** (11): more than iconic... INFAMOUS

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): this got stuck in my head too much not to 11.

**akanewasright** (10): I still think about people mishearing that one line in Nicki’s verse as “yo Ariana callin me gay, you a high five”

**bespectacIed** (10): I UNDERSTOOD THE VISION. She's living in 2118 while yall are stuck in 2018. It's camp, it's forward-thinking, it's a taste test and if you hated it, you failed, sorry :/

**cremeebrulee** (10): can ari shut the fuck up DAMN!!! i'm tryna hear that guy

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i need like five different comments to express all my thoughts on this song

**DaHumanTorch** (10): you wouldn't let anybody speak and inSTEAD

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Controversial take but this is Ariana’s best music video, I love the lost in the spooky YouTube ARG forest vibe

**nt96** (10): this was such an unexpected bop for Ari and I’m glad she did it

**runaway3212** (10): they hate art cause they dont understand it

**sage** (10): 2nd best song in this rate

**throwaway-7650** (10): "like... if you get it you get it if you don’t you don’t iykyk... and if you don’t know like I honestly feel bad for you like... I lit- I cannot explain it, like, I don’t have the vocabulary to sit here and explain like, either you get the vibe or you don't get the vibe... like?" - ice spice

**babadork** (9.7): This would be a ten if Nicki’s lyrics were even a little related to the rest of the song. As a Pennsylvanian, I’m here for the sample.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): overhated!!!! This is more interesting than anything else Taylor Swift has done (sorry to invoke her but she was on my mind for some reason)

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): i know y'all hate the sample but it disappears into the background for me and the rest is just so interesting to listen to

**AHSWeeknd** (9): verses went off but the chorus is a crime

**Awkward\_King** (9): im so tired of hating. no more hating. this eats.

**bluetriangles04** (9): my initial reaction when I first heard it years ago was pretty lukewarm, since then I've grown to really enjoy the sampling, Nicki's part, the verses and the production in general.

**MassiveThief** (9): I was obssessed with this when it came out. Over time I've gotten tired of it, but I WILL be a defender for the purposes of this rate.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): there’s only two types of people in the world, those who like this song and those who can’t see the light coming

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): wait wait wait why does this sound good? I hated this when it was released and haven’t thought about this song in 3 years but its kinda good now? Im bopping? What the

**TiltControls** (8.5): it would be a 10 without the weird vocal backing the track

**slimboyfriend** (8): the sample is still notoriously lazy and almost comically repetitive…. But idk i kinda like it :)))

**vayyiqra** (8): Lol sample bad Nicki bad yes we know good song though! Amusingly stupid line about Chun-Li who is not a "bad guy" in any way shape or form. The chorus is weirdly catchy (emphasis on "weird"). Neat ditty! yuh

**welcome2thejam** (8): The Sacramento Kings this season:

**impla77** (7.7): At the very real risk of overusing the word camp, the sample is camp

**emayzee** (7.2): i have spent the last 5 years trying to determine if this song is bad, good, or so bad it's good

**bogo** (7): the way ariana completely dropped nicki after this collab

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): look, I don’t hate this. It’s just a lil bit goofy, that’s all

**Frelock\_** (7): Fun song, strong start, but the background sample (you won't let anybody!) was kinda annoying by the end

**LesApfels** (7): This would've been incredible if it wasn't for that damn sample

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): This song works better as an interlude with just the Nicki verse and the first chorus

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): this is a good bad song, a great awful song even

**pig-serpent** (7): Ari's faster vocals are such a slay here, and I like the beat, probably against my better judgement, but the part where she sings the title is awful and dragging this score down a lot.

ExActsRate: #living in darkness

**Frajer** (6.5): Whatever voice she is using in this song please do not do that again thank god we will always have Side To Side and Bang Bang

**seanderlust** (6.5): why did pharell have to make a townhall on obamacare very yass and slay not once but TWICE.

**frogaranaman** (6): who is making the light cum

**soul-glitch** (6): It was ahead of its time

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): if we rated this in 2018/19 it would've been an easy 0 but it's kinda grown on me. like it's fun and super different for ariana. nicki's verse is also really good. if there wasn't that sample it would be an amazing song.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): this is shit, but decent, yet it's still shit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I still don’t know what to think. I’m just gonna give it a 5 and move on.

**bluehxrizon** (5): animal crossing ass beat

**jasannn** (5): thanks for the warning

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (5): when this song started I actually thought "oh the sample isn't as bad as I remember!" and I was preparing to defend this. But then it kept going again and again and again and by like a minute in it was unbearable 😭

**anothertown** (4): what the fuck was pharrell thinking making a song as good as lemon and then putting this shit together using all the castoffs?!

**jasparghhh** (4): I only rated it this high because "the light is coming to bring back everything the darkness stole" could be a line in Kingdom Hearts

**1998tweety** (3): nicki DEVOURED but the rest of the song is so horrid

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): I was gonna 0 this for a while but honestly the actual song itself is cool. The infamous sample is just annoying and ruins my enjoyment. I think a more out-there singer like Charli XCX would mesh better with the off-kilter sound than Ariana.

**jsonphile** (3): man we are off to a rough start with this album

**daythreeinmiami** (2): What they used for the high hat and with the blips and bops all together is so irritating lol. This is annoying and repetitive and shes aged production wise. Also either I’m high, or this song fades out then back in areas of the song. I don’t like these mind games.

**pastapixal** (2): a botched experiment.

**ReallyCreative** (2): I have changed my score for this song like 8 times while listening to it... there's a level of camp here that is downright frightening

**dreamingpastel** (1): CBAT, is that you?

**fadedblue09** (1): I'm not a Pharrell hater I swear! His production is actually good, Ariana is just bad at pulling these quirky stuff. Maybe if Kelis or Gwen Stefani sang this I would like it idk

**goodbyesindisguise** (1): it’s just not for me. the only song I deleted from the album

**PretentiousPegasus** (1): this song is horrible I have nothing else to say about it

**sydschoon** (1): I love ari but we all know this song is wack

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): the loop is fucking stupid and none of you can convince me otherwise

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): "you wouldn't let anybody speak and instead" me talking to lorde

**Darkknuckles** (0): YOU WOULDNT LET ANYBODY SPEAK BUT INSTEAD. Why the fuck is this man screaming in my ear for 3 minutes and 48 seconds. Fuck that cuz I love a lot of the rest of the song.

**indie\_fan\_** (0): i was so confused when this first came out. I was never crazy on their past collabs, but this just felt like one big question mark

**plastichaxan** (0): I switched like a f-- on this song fr but I blame that one guy speaking repeating in the background

**Treecoh** (0): really bad just really bad

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): God I HATED this when it came out. That sample bothered me so so so much, like I could NOT listen to this song properly without getting constantly distracted by it, it was a literal challenge. Now? I can kinda filter it out a little… but it's still there, and it still annoys me. I shouldn't have to fight so hard through something so unpleasant just to listen to a song properly.

**nooodisaster** (7): If you relate to this song, therapy is needed. I mean, it's a good song but still seek therapy.

#forever and always

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This album really was peak Demi

**akanewasright** (10): man… this song just aches in the right ways

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I’m a sucker for songs about being pathetic.

**bluehxrizon** (10): this is a rare Demi song where she actually uses the range of her voice in a way that builds up from start to finish. the climax is transcendent and her power-belting meshes beautifully with washes of synth pad and vocal harmonies. she devoured.

**Bordersz** (10): Love love love the sound. The bridge is soooo good that high note is everything.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): my favorite album cut probably, the simmering DRAMA in this one is chef’s kiss

**Darkknuckles** (10): What a bop. Still stuck in my head all these years later. I looked at the song and im like yaaaaaas her high note at the end is chefs kiss.

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): oh this one is r&b excellence!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the crunchy distorted piano chords at the start and end are kinda obnoxious, but the rest is really nice

**seanderlust** (10): oooh this reminds me a bit of touch it by ariana in the sense of being a sweeping beautiful song that i think most people don't know about

**1998tweety** (9): demi was so hush this song but knew 2 minutes and 30 seconds in it was time to start YELLING

**throwaway-7650** (9): CATCH IT @JAEHYUN

**fadedblue09** (8.5): a grower for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): For a long time I thought that this should have been an interlude but after seeing some other people voice how much they liked it I revisited it and I feel like I get it now… like you can hear the yearning in their voice and in the way the music just kinda drifts off into infinity. They try to spin it in so many directions but it’s ultimately a song about hopeless desperation and I really appreciate the willingness to seem *weak*.

**anothertown** (8): i think this was one of the b-roll parts of this particular documentary where they were like leaning sexily on a kitchen island or in an artfully lit shower or something

**oscarbrierley1** (8): she pops off from the bridge onward

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): this one is pretty chill and enjoyable!

**Frelock\_** (7): Has a lot of emotions going for it

**horridhendy** (7): The beginning made me think there was something wrong with my headphones. Otherwise, it's good

**Stryxen** (7): okayyy atmospheric slay... an atmosphere with a hole in the ozone layer

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): Only Forgettable

**cremeebrulee** (6): when did this album get so moody wtf i kinda miss sorry not sorry now

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i’ve decided to be indecisive

**emayzee** (6): "i've been thinking about the future and i've been thinking about the now" is actually a subtle reference to demi and nick jonas's "honda civic tour: future now" tour #confirmed

**goodbyesindisguise** (6): I’m not hooked by anything particular but i was swaying by the ending

# never

**hikk** (6): well the album takes a bit of a nosedive here ngl

**IIIHenryIII** (6): damn, that’s tough

**nt96** (6): my Bluetooth headphones are already messed up so hearing the weird piano noises made me think it was messing up. Demi I hate u so much 😭

**daythreeinmiami** (5.5): Also about Nick Jonas. But the Tennis Court percussion really takes me out of the moment.

**bogo** (5): the title is how long this song seems to last

**impla77** (5): talk about mixed messages

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): only forever only forever only forever only f

**sydschoon** (4.5): something about a repetitive 2-word chorus throws me off

**NotWith10000Men** (4): boring

**runaway3212** (3): forever is the time this song went on

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): god this is a snooze fest how can a ballad be so boring when she has such strong vocals

**pig-serpent** (1): It's cool how every hit of the keyboard dissolves into the ether, but the rest of this song feels completely braindead and like it doesn't know what it wants to do.  "Only Forever, Only Forever, Only Forever, Only Forever," man this is such a great hook, it only feels like it lasts forever.

**joeeswift** (0): just painfully….boring

nooodisaster: Thanks so much for joining us for day 1!

Come back tomorrow at 3PM EST for Day 2.

Will raindrops keep outlasting actual songs? Will the Selena bleed stop? Will Demi get over Nick Jonas? Thanks so much to Ricki for making the posts in this thread, there's more Easter eggs in them than your average Taylor Swift Instagram post.
