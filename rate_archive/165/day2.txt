They really hate to see a hot latina winning... It's a song for hot people, so if you don't get it... 

This one is extremely fun, Selena needs to release more upbeat dance tracks because they always bring the mood up. This remind me a lot of Revival's Me And My Girls, just pure fake-it-till-you-make it confidence is music form, and those of you too weirded out by the AWOOOO are definitely the weakest link, get your furry on for 3 minutes like...!

---
**followingfreeways** (7): also one of the songs on my gym playlist

**nooodisaster** (6.5): This is like the 5th song about Selena's mental health struggles. The first 4 times it was inspirational. Just get a therapist girl.

---

#got it

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I will never not stan this song. It‚Äôs crack.

**bluetriangles04** (10): This one is so good. Definitely my favorite on this album, and super fun in general. I feel like sometimes Selena suffers from her delivery on other songs in the album, whether it comes from the sometimes overly cheesy lyrics or something else entirely. For this song in particular though, I feel like it just fits her and the production is just *chef's kiss*

**Frelock\_** (10): The near frantic beat is great symbolism for unceasing fight against inner negativity

**throwaway-7650** (10): oh she hit the slay button here

**oscarbrierley1** (9): the beat is really fun. off kilter dark club banger.

**pig-serpent** (9): The bassline on this song is crazy, and I think instrumentally it's a strong highlight for the album.  That said, every time there's a good instrumental on this album, it just calls attention to how weak of a vocalist Selena Gomez is.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): was so ready to give this bop a 10 but that ‚Äúauuuh‚Äù throws me off üò≠

**sage** (8.7): twerkulator

**MassiveThief** (8.5): banger.

**1998tweety** (8): bops

**horridhendy** (8): It's a bop

**Stryxen** (8): omfg this single handedly undid the Making me want to quit rating that the mid section of Rare put upon me

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a weird song that's trying to be vaguely "Western" (?) with the guitar which is a lateral move for this album but I'm not against it. "Dancefloor therapy" lmao! Good line. We already have songs on here about how dancing is freeing and stuff but whatever. It's Selena saying "something mental health" I'm already sold on it.

**pastapixal** (6.9): the "down" sound effect sounds like a sad dog but other than that it's a bop

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): the ahoooo‚Äôs are more annoying then the mmms on look at me now

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): all my comments are "bit of a bop" but this one genuinely is

#got them down

**sydschoon** (6.4): catchy hook but doesn‚Äôt do much for me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): I was feeling the song but then I really dislike the ‚Äúow-woos‚Äù like why are we howling like a werewolf rn :(

**goodbyesindisguise** (6): funky and fun to dance to. I still have no idea what it‚Äôs about though

**ReallyCreative** (6): there's a good song here but the delivery is like Ambien

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): filler galore!

**CrimsonROSET** (5): pandreo fire emblem:

**runaway3212** (5): This is such a "im not doing bad I'll fix myself" bop

**IIIHenryIII** (4): add the word ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù to the beginning and you get a banger

**fadedblue09** (3.5): extremely dated, feels like one of those Revival bonus tracks

**akanewasright** (3): this song is fine the album is just really wearing on me rn

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): These songs are catchy in the worst way

**bespectacIed** (2): skip

**Treecoh** (2): dont like the dog sounds awoooooo

#why are yall taking about colors?

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): P!nk voice I‚Äôm a hazard to myself! don‚Äôt let me get meeeee, I‚Äôm my own worst enemy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Oh this title makes me nostalgic for when P!nk made music that didn‚Äôt sound like a Democratic campaign ad.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): p!nk on opposite day be like

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): P!nk kinda mops this

**anothertown** (6): but pink said

**TiltControls** (6): the anti-p!nk


**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Evil P!nk be like

#feminists

**AHSWeeknd** (10): BEYOND UNDERRATED

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): I love prominent basslines Selena is pandering to ME

**Frelock\_** (9): Fun opener, and the rest of the song keeps up that feeling

**jasparghhh** (9): all the deluxe tracks are 10x better than the standard lmao

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (9): once again I am asking why selena's team kept all of the best songs for the deluxe version?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): sequel to lucky by britney spears

**vayyiqra** (9): Shoutout to whoever is playing bass on this album, whoever that is (likely more than one person) rocks. Underrated song!

**1998tweety** (8.5): we love a sexual bop

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): a little more pizzazz would put it over the top

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): ya talking about urself?

**cremeebrulee** (8): it's frustrating that the best tracks on the album are kept on the deluxe, like how did this miss the cut when kinda crazy & fun didn't

**Darkknuckles** (8): still a bop

**goodbyesindisguise** (8): I really like the sound

**akanewasright** (7.9): I‚Äôve only heard this song twice, and yet this chorus stuck with me more than most of the standard tracks üò≠

**ignitethephoenix** (7.9): this could have easily replaced multiple main album cuts

**anothertown** (7): i can't decide if this is a minor serve or if it sounds like CW show

**bespectacIed** (7): cute

**IIIHenryIII** (7): Outsold her best friend‚Äôs ex

**sydschoon** (6.9): has a nice hook, not anything iconic or groundbreaking

#mysogynists
 
**Frajer** (6.5): Rock a Bye Baby Anne Marie vibes

**pig-serpent** (6.5): The normal version of this album was long enough, we didn't need bonus songs that sound exactly like the rest of the album (even if they're better than most of the album?)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): it‚Äôs just Look At Her Now without the camp

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): So much of this album falls under the ‚Äúpleasant while it‚Äôs on‚Äù umbrella.

**ReallyCreative** (6): pronoun queen

**TiltControls** (6): the production is fun, but it feels a little let down by selena's performance - sounds a little bored during parts

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): /they

**bogo** (5): she's a bit of a flop

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I appreciate that Selena has a story to tell but hearing this in a rate with Demi and Arian (who have released similar songs that hit much harder) it just falls flat. The treatment of the subject is just too glib, like the lyrics are so emotional but she‚Äôs treating it like it‚Äôs a throwaway dance cut.

**runaway3212** (5): not everybody can be a main slayer

**welcome2thejam** (5): Turn this groove into like an actual clear bassline with some life in it and maybe you'll have something

**bluetriangles04** (4): I think that bassline is nice (if that's what it is?) but honestly wasn't really feeling this in general, the rhyme scheme was really repetitive and in general the song wasn't really interesting for me

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Oh my god‚Ä¶ She cannot sing‚Ä¶ This girl cannot sing‚Ä¶ And it's not just that she can't sing, there are many not-vocally-gifted singers who can still make amazing music, it's that the music she's doing is making her sounds soooo much worse, this kind of sparse production is for singers that know how to hold their voice even when singing quietly, and she's just SO shaky and we can hear every single mistake she makes. She's happy with this??

**impla77** (3): This managed to be a standout nothing song in an album comprised of many nothing songs

**dream\_fighter2018** (2): more proof that I‚Äôm potentially anti-third person in songs.


**OliviaGodrigo** (2): nothing interesting about this one but cute message

#ahüëÖ

**CrimsonROSET** (8): is there gonna be a her section of comments can i be in there

**throwaway-7650** (10): HER HER HER HER HER HER HER HER / SHE SHE SHE SHE SHE SHE-

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): she's she she she she her her her her

**frogaranaman** (7): her

**ImADudeDuh** (6): me when asked how to turn a Megan Thee Stallion hit song from subjective to objective form

This was such a moment in time to witness. Probably the biggest moment for Selena as a singer, that for her entire career always feel like her spot in the A-list continued to be propelled by her Disney career, tabloid drama and goodwill from simply being a gorgeous, likeable girl.

The song is... fine, it's probably less effective in pulling the heartstrings of the listeners as the people that worked on it wished, but it sent a clear and strong message; "EAT SHIT JUSTIN BIEBER". The Rare rollout was messy and underwhelming, but no one will ever take away how she dominated public discussion with this release. And let's not forget the most important part this song, the one thing that has helped this song forever be remembered in the mind of stans who will call en era a flop if it doesn't have 5 #1 singles and sells 1 million copies first week, [the iconic AMA performance] that probably killed whatever promotion plans she had prepared but gave us one of [Youtube's brightest moments.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZW_ycajpMI)

**nooodisaster** (10): Love love love this simple, heartfelt ballad. Julia Michaels at her absolute best. An example of how in pop, you can use every trope in the book (self-affirmation anthems, repeating bridge, chanting choir) and your song will only be stronger for it.

**followingfreeways** (7): i love this for her bc i feel like it was cathartic for her, its not my fav but it seems pretty authentic which i appreciate

---

#lost you to love them<3

**1998tweety** (10): this kinda hits

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The way Popheads doubted this and Flowers will always be funny

**Frelock\_** (10): I'm a sucker for a big choir

**IIIHenryIII** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBfbcmuajtw

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is like... the only Julia Michaels song that‚Äôs above passable

**jsonphile** (10): balladphobia is probably going to hurt this, but I don‚Äôt know, I really love this song

**MassiveThief** (10): such a genuinely beautiful song, I'm still amazed it came from Selena.

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): excellent ballad tbh it‚Äôs one of those songs of hers where her limited range makes the song feel more emotional but maybe i‚Äôm just high

**runaway3212** (10): julia michaels was out for blood with that first verse

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): the verses are kinda clunky but the chorus' and especially the last one are just so damn good

**TiltControls** (10): Selena often misses for me but when she hits, she hits

**jasparghhh** (9.5): I took off half a point because I can sometimes hear Julia Michaels instead of Selena which annoys me lol

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): In my mind and my mind only, this is inextricably linked to Bad Friend by Rina Sawayama, because I don‚Äôt have any romantic breakups, but I can sure as hell relate this to how much it hurts to let go of a friend who‚Äôs bringing you down. Yeah, the vocals don‚Äôt really give - Selena isn‚Äôt as emotive as other singers known for quieter vocals like Billie, but I feel like she means every word she‚Äôs singing and I connect with it.

**sydschoon** (9.5): beautiful ballad, massive impact, iconic

**emayzee** (9.2): probably objectively her best song but im still partial to round and round by selena gomez and the scene

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I get why some people really don‚Äôt like this and it was kind of a plague on pop radio but also‚Ä¶it pretty.

**bluetriangles04** (9): its pretty difficult for me to really enjoy a ballad, and what it all comes down to is how I find the lyrics and the delivery to be. I'm not going to lie and say the production isn't a big part of it either, but all three are really well done here.

**Frajer** (9): I love how you strongly you can hear Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter on this

**pastapixal** (9): crazy she got a no1 before Demi, let alone with a ballad. That said it's very well deserved, love this song!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): this song talks about a boring cis-hetero m4n (eww!) but that performance will always be the reason why I'll rate it this way, it's hilariously iconic in fucked-up ways.

**musical\_pyn** (8): stream hacks!

**NotWith10000Men** (8): the line is funny but the song is still good

**akanewasright** (7.5): listen, the song grew off me hard‚Ä¶ but the release? That was a moment. Realizing that Selena was going to get a #1 hit as a kid who grew up loving her was sooo cool

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The really tried to gaslight us with that edited performance video huh

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): what a strange choice for a second track off an album

**frogaranaman** (6): excited for this comment section

**pig-serpent** (6): I change my score every time I listen to this song.  Sometimes I feel like it could be more effective, but other times I'm in love with the gentle orchestration.

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): this song is so inconsistent, I'll like it and then 5 seconds later I'll hate it, I just don't know

#sang offkey in my chorus

**welcome2thejam** (6): Eh, a pretty decent if unspectacular ballad

**anothertown** (5): there is something very royalty free about this

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): I was gonna say ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt this have a big chorus‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think Selena could handle that.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I don‚Äôt think this is necessarily a bad song but I could listen to basically the same song by someone with a better voice.

**goodbyesindisguise** (4): I respect it but it wasn‚Äôt a save for me

**soul-glitch** (4): So bland and you can tell the producers were fighting for their lives trying to salvage the vocals

**cremeebrulee** (3.3): disney child stars are obsessed with releasing mediocre self-love-post-breakup tracks about years-old relationships, but i'll admit that "set fire to my purpose" ate up every line on flowers

**seanderlust** (3): eh this song has always felt a bit overrated to me. it reminds me of fight song by rachel platten in the sense that it's supposed to be this big cathartic release, but the end product just has me like :man_standing: okay. and if you're going to shoot for big and cathartic you have to meet that goal otherwise it falls VERY flat. shoutout to the hacks scene that uses this though

**Treecoh** (3): snooze

**sage** (2.1): snores

**daythreeinmiami** (2): It‚Äôs not Selena, I just really do not like ballads.

**dreamingpastel** (2): Literally nothing is clicking in this song

**oscarbrierley1** (2): she does not have the voice to pull of a big chorus ballad like this.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): this songs sounds so empty and hollow, the reverb is so much. I dislike the chorus as well. The ballad doesn‚Äôt work for me, it feels so plodding. Sorry never liked this song since it came out.

**hikk** (0): i'm anti-ballad in general and this is about as generic a ballad you can get...

**ReallyCreative** (0): I think it would do wonders for their artistry if Selena and Justin were banned from making songs about each other under penalty of being dropped in the middle of the Hudson river by helicopter

**vayyiqra** (0): Might seem weird I'm going hard to defend Rare here, yet 0ing this. The reason is because this song is really, really boring.


#**bespectacIed** (2): Emojis you can hear üéÄüë©üèøüéÄ

**RandomHypnotica** (6): SALINA!!! >:(

**Stryxen** (5): SALINA MOOOOVE

**throwaway-7650** (10): this is good idc (WE LOVE AND MISS YOU AJAYII!)

**indie\_fan\_** (7): AjayII's reaction vid to the AMA performance of this will forever remain a classic


# **bogo** (8): julia michaels you are not seeing heaven for "sang off key in my chorus"


**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (7.5): whoever wrote that "off key on my chorus" line set her up baaaad üíÄüíÄüíÄ

**CrimsonROSET** (7): +1 for just how much ‚Äòsang off key to my chorus‚Äô has contributed to pop culture

**impla77** (6): This is fine but dull.. rides off being about you know who

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): *insert line about ‚Äúsinging off-key in my chorus‚Äù here*

**DaHumanTorch** (5): i'll never be able to decide if her singing sang offkey in my chorus is camp or embarrassing

**LesApfels** (4): sAnG OfF kEy In mY ChOrUs

**PretentiousPegasus** (2): sorry I can‚Äôt take Selena seriously when she‚Äôs singing ballads. the off key in my chorus line was ironic


**Awkward\_King** (0): its actually insane like no one has ever set themselves up as much as she did here its so fucking funny

#im a predictable man


**ignitethephoenix** (8): the way I know the off key version will be played during the reveal

The fan favorite unreleased song that made it out of the vault! Who doesn't love a good success story?! Well,,, success in making it to streaming services, but not in the rate. I'm not the biggest fan of this specific, tho I do think it's one of Selena's most intimate songs. I agree with the sentiment that a good "do you think about me!?" song can really hit when done well, I'm not sure if this is the best example. I personally would recommend[ Carly' Talking To Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u2PPXhEelo).

---

**followingfreeways** (10): truly LOVE this song. i cant believe it took her so long to release it. shes so cruel in this for real

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Well, I'm glad after all this at least she's over her toxic ex... Oh wait.

#feeling myself

**AHSWeeknd** (10): idk why but I became obsessed with this

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is a great closing song off the album and I feel like this is underrated.

**throwaway-7650** (10): ice spice on opposite day:

**Treecoh** (10): if i had another 11 it would be this

**akanewasright** (9): idk why this feels like such a breath of fresh air to me‚Ä¶ like on paper it‚Äôs not different from other Rare tracks and yet I can viscerally tell it was written for Revival

**bluetriangles04** (9): honestly I love the "pissed off ex-lover being semi-petty and hoping they're in their ex's mind rent free" genre or whatever it is. It's a familiar feeling even for my inexperienced ass. On top of that, the production is just gorgeous in general.

**goodbyesindisguise** (9): love this kind of sexy revenge sentiment. such a danceable fun bop

**vayyiqra** (9): Tropical house Selena was Good In Fact.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): OKAAYYY.jpeg

**1998tweety** (8): basic but it does bop

**bespectacIed** (8): Damn this is rlly good food??? I'm legit skerrd how much I enjoyed this album, I hate being proven wrong

**impla77** (8): God I‚Äôm so ready to rate Talk11ng to yourself.. but this is good too!

**PretentiousPegasus** (8): the highlight of this album

**TiltControls** (8): didn't love this one at first, but it's grown on me quite a bit

**Bordersz** (7.5): Production on this is great. It reminds me of 2015 in the best way possible.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): i love love love this chorus

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): this is a revival leftover and i like that album more than this one so its one of the better tracks on here

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Kidz Bop ‚ÄúYou Oughta Know‚Äù but it works

**IIIHenryIII** (7): a bop

Left foot two stomps!!

This grew on me during this rate, because i used to really dislike this. I found it obnoxious and mind-numbing and honestly I'm not sure I don't believe that still, but by god this song is fun as hell when you don't take it seriously at all. Demi probably could get replaced by any D-lister albanian pop star, but I'm very glad they're the one here, because I really like her low tone autotuned, it gives the song a little flavor. 

I would probably cry about this being robbed or something, but realistically this is probably the highest it could get with the amount of ballots we got.

---

**followingfreeways** (9): i only listen to this on my workout playlist and maybe i should listen to it more than that. it slaps

**nooodisaster** (8): This seems like a song engineered to become a "Macarena"/"Electric Slide" dancefloor song. But... did anyone ever do that? Like, did even a single person put this on and go "Hey guys, let's do the 'Instruction' dance!!"

---

**pastapixal** (11): one of Demi's best and it's so overlooked!! She don't need no introductionüòé

**akanewasright** (10): my first time hearing this was when a friend of mine choreographing a little dance to it during rehearsal for a school play, so I just think of that every time I hear the song

**bluetriangles04** (10): THIS SLAY???? ill never forget you CHUNGHA! BITCH I DON'T NEED INTRODUCTION!

**LesApfels** (10): LatAm radio played this CONSTANTLY back in the day

**throwaway-7650** (10): this might be the campiest song in the entire rate, shockingly

**CrimsonROSET** (9): idc i‚Äôm shaking ass

**Darkknuckles** (9): This song makes me dance.

**dreamingpastel** (9): I want this to be the next Cotton Eyed Joe or Macarena.

**seanderlust** (9): why do i feel like this would kill in a zumba class for middle-aged white ladies

**AHSWeeknd** (8): ‚Äúif you‚Äôre the supreme then I‚Äôm Diana Ross‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs genius.

**goodbyesindisguise** (8): after a stretch of low tempo and at times boring songs this woke me tf up also hello Stefflon I love u. this has to be the most bizarre track order decision though.

**horridhendy** (8): I'm torn, it's such a fun bop but I hate the feature. It's still a solid 8 for me though.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): this ain‚Äôt a bop but it kinda is?

**MassiveThief** (8): a fun cute lil banger.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Just got war flashbacks to 2017 oh my god

**oscarbrierley1** (8): tacking a moderate hit dj collab to give the deluxe a boost in streams is so r&b girlie coded of demi.

**pig-serpent** (8): Demi doing the 90s dance throwbacks 5 years ahead of the curve.

**Stryxen** (8): michelle Obama Purse so heavy gettin Oprah dollars

**TragicKingdom1** (8): the little stutter in the chorus is such a good detail that i did not expect from a jax jones song

**flava** (1): these english edm producers / Dj‚Äôs are a plague on this earth

**rotating3Dtext** (0): now why did they put this in the album

**slimboyfriend** (0): honestly I can‚Äôt blame them for putting a song like this on their most personal album because if I was a singer and released my most personal album yet, it would definitely need to have a song this messy to reflect my mental state

#[do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9HIaGcBocc)

**akanewasright** (10): I always think this opening is gonna turn into Ariana Grande‚Äôs ‚Äúimagine‚Äù lol

**Bordersz** (10): The play on word with "lie" is top tier. Vocals on point.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is so poignant as it deals with Demi‚Äôs struggles with addiction, only for us to now learn she was struggling during this whole era. Great dramatic number where Demi sounds amazing

**dreamingpastel** (10): the build up in this song is SO GOOD

**fadedblue09** (10): god their vocal runs here are just immaculate

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): SING DEMI!!

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): yknow what maybe these are actually the ex-acts most personal albums omg there‚Äôs some real tearjerkers on this rate

**sydschoon** (10): this song hits hard‚Ä¶right in the heart. Shit hurts just to listen to, and I think that‚Äôs what makes it so great. Vocals are fucking INSANE

**1998tweety** (9): she devoured this

**NotWith10000Men** (9): a duet with her and chris stapleton would break the speakers in my laptop

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): they popped off

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Demi has said that this song is about their struggles with substance abuse, and I really like the plodding, methodical feeling of it. It sounds like *work* to sing, but that reflects the work that Demi had to put in to get clean. A lot of Demi‚Äôs music has been about confronting their issues, sometimes almost uncomfortably so, but I think this song strikes just the right balance.

**goodbyesindisguise** (8): YES. This type of pacing and beat always gets me. Reminds me of a Kelly track

**impla77** (8): Demi‚Äôs really showing off their vocal chops on this!

**nt96** (8): the way I yassed harder for every note she reached

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): robert pattinson be like

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Did not expect to like a Demi ballad so much but I think it shows off their vocal skills really well

**welcome2thejam** (8): Good for her

**throwaway-7650** (7.7): ANOHNI?

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): demi‚Äôs kinda on their oversinging schtick again a little huh (but complimentary this time this vocal is so good)

**bespectacIed** (7): Put on her adele wig

**Darkknuckles** (7): The vocals hittttt in the chorus. Miss Demi doing the damn thing.

**daythreeinmiami** (7): I have not heard this song in a hot minute. I forgot how GOOD Demi sounded on this album.

**Frelock\_** (7): It's got some power behind it, but it just doesn't do it for me.

**seanderlust** (7): this feels like it would hit hard if i had a person i associate with it but i don't so it just kind of falls flat.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): I love how this album is alternating between bops to shake your ass to and ballads that make your eyes watery

#[dont do it](https://twitter.com/ChloeBailey/status/1626266062881796096?)

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Me to Demi‚Äôs music after I graduated High School

**anothertown** (6): me driving past chipotle and chuckling lightly

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Great singing, beautiful singing.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): american idol performance bait

**oscarbrierley1** (6): why is she shouting at me.

**Stryxen** (6): Twigs copied their homework

**TiltControls** (6): some great vocal moments, but the song is lacking a little otherwise

**bluetriangles04** (5): feels like it could be on the soundtrack of like idk, fifty shades of grey with the instrumental?

**CrimsonROSET** (5): +3 for realizing the lyrics are about herself and not about a relationship, -3 for how the song actually sounds

**flava** (5): it‚Äôs certainly a ballad

**frogaranaman** (5): sounds like an attempt at a jazz standard that doesn‚Äôt exist

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): it's fine, idk whats up with her vocals in this album but they're not my favourite

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): everyone to demi after they attacked that frozen yogurt shop

**runaway3212** (4.5): we get it you can yell

**PretentiousPegasus** (4): the vocals are great but the song is boring and the ‚Äúyououououou don‚Äôt dououououou‚Äù is annoying

**sage** (3.8): this doesnt either.. the string hits YAWNNNN

**horridhendy** (3.5): Sorry but I find this kinda boring. Also, I think she's kinda over-singing this. Skip.

**LesApfels** (3): Yawn

**MassiveThief** (3): she can sure sing. that's about all I can say, this is boring.

**plastichaxan** (3): Me to most of their music

**pig-serpent** (2): It's not balladphobia if the ballad is actually just bad, right?

**cremeebrulee** (1.5): ok i apologize because i know this is about their past addiction, but this song sounds so bad

**Awkward\_King** (1): what is this album pacing its like they were bubblegum candy in sexy dirty love and now this ballad abt falling out of love like sjdsj

**Lilacly\_Adily** (1): Lyrically, I can acknowledge that it‚Äôs a well written and deeply personal song for them but production-wise and vocally, I‚Äôve never felt so instantly bored by a song before.

---


#friends with benefit


**1998tweety** (11): this is lowkey the best song on the album but I know y'all will pay it dust.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This and Body Say are the types of songs Demi nails

**bespectacIed** (10): I'm obsessed with this like woaah, the vibe? the subject matter, the attitude, the horns, the production? BTW this is how False God would sound if taylor had an ounce of sexiness in her

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): me not evening being a gen Z disney gyal but still gasping in 2018 when I learned the bridge was a nod to wanting to hook up with Nick Jonas‚Ä¶.just that dramatic tbh

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Nick Jonas. It was about Nick Jonas.

**hikk** (10): ME AND WHO

**throwaway-7650** (10): jennifer of tiktok or whatever her name is could never

**welcome2thejam** (10): Surprised this doesn't soundtrack like sixty-five fandom ship vids on youtube

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): this is kinda 1975 robbers/somebody else core

**akanewasright** (9): Demi really was right at home in this kind of groovy R&B zone

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Not sure this is the type of song that really suits Demi‚Äôs voice but I‚Äôm enjoying it!

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): and then he ended up with priyanka chopra

**ReallyCreative** (8.3): not her Lana impression at the beginning omg

**Frelock\_** (8): Doesn't ruin anything!

**jasparghhh** (8): when I first read what 'no I can't keep denying every minute I think of you' meant my whole world changed

**PretentiousPegasus** (8): nice to have a song where she‚Äôs not shouting at us

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Pretty much most of my crushes in my life were on my friends so‚Ä¶ relatable

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): priyanka chopra was SWEATING

**TiltControls** (7.5): a fun groovy ditty

**anothertown** (7): i really hope that she looks back on how hung up she was on the jonas brothers and does nothing but laugh

**bogo** (7): girl no, value your frienships

**Bordersz** (7): Negatively biased towards this song bc a creepy friend sent this to me 6 years into the friendship. Hated it.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): but has he shown interest in ruining this friendship because if not it might get awkward

**IIIHenryIII** (7): Nick Jonas be like üëÄ

**impla77** (7): ngl, as soon as they mentioned cigars I could only picture Fidel Castro as Demi‚Äôs lover

**runaway3212** (7): me about to take my 5th shot telling my friend "your brother looks so hot tonight"

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): I would call the bridge an Easter egg that Swifties would freak out about if Taylor did it, but it‚Äôs not even subtle. I admire the brazenness but you cannot make me care about Nick Jonas that much

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): oh wow they learned how to use their inside voice

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): the 2nd most impactful thing to come from the Future Now tour after all the jokes about the poster looking like it came out of the hunger games


#married priyanka 

**Darkknuckles** (6): Not the most memorable esp compared to the 2 next to it.

**pig-serpent** (6): A little low key for my tastes, but everything sounds nice and organic, and the instruments don't sound shredded like they do on other songs, so it's a nice break, and it's decently catchy to boot.

**sydschoon** (5.7): I like the slow r&b feel to this track

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): The sonics on this one are great, I love the brass, but the lyrics kinda skeeve me out. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ the least sexy way to phrase this request?

**NotWith10000Men** (5): the idea for the song is fine but ruin the friendship is a terrible line

**nt96** (5): the result of tanking a song my rate besties love

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): why is this giving me knock off ariana vibes

**bluetriangles04** (4): not a fan of that trumpet or whatever instrument it is...

**goodbyesindisguise** (4): it sounds nice but it‚Äôs not overly remarkable

**seanderlust** (4): demi listen...a lot of us want to fuck nick jonas. you don't need to be in your complain-about-the-friendzone era over it

**cremeebrulee** (3.6): i would do this but the last time i admitted feelings for a friend, he actually got offended skjhfdjkfshd

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): if you told me this was a Demi Lovato song I wouldn‚Äôt believe it, maybe Pig-Serpent was right

**sage** (2.2): the chorus horns are so bad omg i gagged

**MassiveThief** (1): there's something unbearably clunky about the "lets ruin the friendship" lyric. I hate it.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This and ‚Äújust like magic‚Äù are on the same level of fun-bop. ‚Äúmake up‚Äù is not on that level

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is a much better song about bragging than 7 Rings.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is video game music in the way that it makes me accomplish stuff on sims-fast forward mode when i put it on

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): the VGI-ass instrumental lol but the lyrics here are so breezy and confident. Love the generosity feeling!

**pastapixal** (9.5): a criminally underrated bop

**akanewasright** (9): imagine if this was the song that blew up instead of 7 rings‚Ä¶ college kids partying to the mii theme ass production

**bluetriangles04** (9): this one is so much fun, honestly that bridge is great too! maybe my favorite Pharrell produced one on the album

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): this is so fun and sassy i love it

**vayyiqra** (9): Slightly obnoxious but also very funny song! Will assume it's meant to be ironic and "camp" and so on. Also true she is very successful, that is just a fact. yuh

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): damn ariana and frankie grande are the original gay son or thot daughter...

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): i hate it when it first came out, but i really like it now. its fun and silly and dare i say camp. the wii music vibe kind of adds to it.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): this is a less problematic 7 rings

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Instrumental to this kinda sounds like the royalty free music that would be used in a corporate training video (complimentary somehow)

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): this is the kind of song where some days it‚Äôs almost a 10 and some days it‚Äôs a 5 that annoys me quite a bit so i‚Äôm letting it split the difference

**jasparghhh** (7.5): just like magic from positions is a much better "I'm a boss" song

**impla77** (7.3): This is a mess, but its a fun mess

**Frelock\_** (7): Competently executed, but not really catchy.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): a.k.a. PG-13 7 rings

**slimboyfriend** (7): her most profound lyricism

**Stryxen** (7): and she's already bragging about her rate sweep

**welcome2thejam** (7): Strange, I don't see K.K. Slider's name in the production credits

**emayzee** (6.6): well i can relate to the young part

#[marina](https://twitter.com/MarinaDiamandis/status/943471050347696128) 

**daythreeinmiami** (6): Lol I‚Äôm aging and poor.

**dreamingpastel** (6): Why does the instrumental sound like it's from Animal Crossing?

**jsonphile** (6): yeah I wouldn‚Äôt know but thanks

**1998tweety** (5.5): not her bragging

**flava** (5.5): Ariana really was lying making this right after the Dangerous Woman era underperformed

**sydschoon** (5.5): way too much going on with the production

**bespectacIed** (5): I was and will always be pro-pharrell but I do get that some of his tracks could've been be cut to reduce the Phatigue. This now reminds me of the worst beat ever youtube vid

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): this is certainly a ‚Äúone line wonder‚Äù song

**TiltControls** (5): hopefully not enough to make it past day 1

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I'm pretty sure you could remake this whole song with nothing but gyroids and it would sound exactly the same

**bluehxrizon** (4): what were they thinking with this beat asdlkfja

**ReallyCreative** (4): the synths and production are really solid and fun here but again, Ariana is just too sleepy and not enunicating well enough to really give this song the bounce it's asking for. That said, she really knocks the bridge out of the park, and THAT'S the song I'm looking for here, it's one of the highlights of the entire album.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): me when i get a candy bar from the vending machine and two fall

**musical\_pyn** (3): animal crossing outsold

**pig-serpent** (3): Was Ari dared to write a song using the worst midi presets on a keyboard at a party, or?

**TragicKingdom1** (3): this wouldve been sooo annoying on tiktok if it were released a few years later

**OliviaGodrigo** (2): this was the initiator of her streak of instagram caption music

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): who the fuck is breathing all over this in the background üò≠ like that shit isn't for another 2 tracks

**aldwin\_is\_here** (1): to be fair, this succeeded on being the sole shit stain off this great album.

**Treecoh** (1): I had the same reaction as ajayll

**nooodisaster** (10): Beautiful song (and we will forget it's associated with any piece of film or television :D).

---

#hannah baker... she's the protagonist so this would be a good thing, right? idk i didnt watch 13rw

**bigbigbee** (11): my god. I listened to this so much in 2018, I close my eyes and I‚Äôm mid-commute again

**pheromenos** (11): this was my entire 2018 damn

**1998tweety** (10): this is basic but it does in fact bop

**CrimsonROSET** (10): idc this slays

**Frelock\_** (10): It's got energy, emotions, beautiful vocals, great production values; what's not to like?

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): When this dropped I remember a lot of people complaining about it being basic or whatever but I think it‚Äôs very well executed for what it is.

**jasparghhh** (10): I'm glad this song got an identity outside of 13 Reasons Why because it's a really great song

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): this is her best song outside The Scene

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): what did this even have to do with 13 reasons why

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): This is one of those songs that I've always been sort of embarrassed about liking, whether that's fair or not. Lyrically it's just The Heart Wants What it Wants 2.0, and sonically, that drop is so 2018 it hurts. Plus, it has the unfortunate associating of being on the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack (fuck that show). And yet... it just hits.

**cremeebrulee** (9.4): honestly an underrated selena loosie

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I really like this song. I don‚Äôt like having to look at the 13 Reasons Why album cover.

**bluetriangles04** (9): the worst thing this song has going for it is that it's from the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack. Other than that, when I heard it on the radio back then honestly I found it enjoyable and even more so now that I listened to it of my own accord.

**Bordersz** (9): This was a soundtrack song to that TV show? Never knew that and I watched the show lol. I hear it on the radio all the time.

**horridhendy** (9): - The three singles at the end of this album are the best part of it by a long shot.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): 13RW caused more damage to society than [disaster that won‚Äôt get me canceled if I joke about it]

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): only reason i'm not giving it a 10 is i don't believe this should be in the main rate sorry not sorry it's a big bop tho

**vayyiqra** (9): Don't make me having 13RW discourse in the year of our Lord 2023, do not put that evil upon me. Oh, nobody is making me do that. Good! I will keep my takes to myself then. Pretty nice song!

**emayzee** (8.7): not me enjoying a 13 reasons why soundtrack cut more than almost the entirety of the album

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this is better than I remember

**NotWith10000Men** (8.4): can 2018 be a throwback? bc it feels like it. either that or the song is dated lmfao

**flava** (8): it‚Äôs a lie that Justin Bieber has the best voice for EDM songs because his vocals are so bland they are malleable, Selena Gomez is the best, and she doesn‚Äôt have to sound like plain water to do so

**IIIHenryIII** (8): one of the most lackluster beat drops I‚Äôve ever heard but the verses and the pre-chorus make up for it

**impla77** (8): I know I‚Äôm overrating this, but this reminds me of car rides with my dad so I remember it fondly. Love you dad <3

**TiltControls** (8): I forgot just how anti-climatic the drop was here

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Funnily enough I always go back to this song‚Ä¶ it's definitely better than it should be

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): the first lyric to this song is so good that every time I listen I trick myself into thinking I‚Äôm about to love the whole song and every time by the end I have to come to the realization that it‚Äôs merely fine

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): why the fuck was this on the 13 reasons why soundtrack (other than ms gomez exec producing)

**bogo** (7): this deserves to not be connected to 13 reasons why

**goodbyesindisguise** (7): the chorus is undeniably catchy. i think the replay value hasn‚Äôt been as high because I think of it as a soundtrack song

**LesApfels** (7): Why did she decide to slay harder in this soundtrack song than on half of her own album

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's a little too "ho *clap* hey *clap*" music for me but it's a refreshing direction for Selena, and with some cleaning up I think she could do well in this genre

#the 13th reason

**AHSWeeknd** (6): this was not

**akanewasright** (6): how does this silly little radio filler song end up in a show about >!teen suicide!<?

**hikk** (6): i kinda forgot that selena was involved in this fucking mess of a show... i'm pretty sure this song played in the s2 finale which also contains some of the worst shit i've ever seen in a tv show iykyk

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): this sounded better back when we had to beg selena to release music

**pig-serpent** (6): Certainly a lot more colorful than anything on the main album, but I don't like the drop and I think it's holding the song back.

**runaway3212** (6): I hate 13 reasons why

**soul-glitch** (6): This is so generic

**welcome2thejam** (6): This is certainly an EDM song featuring vocals from Selena Gomez

**TragicKingdom1** (4): if this was released by the chainsmokers as originally planned then it would be universally panned

**anothertown** (3): omg this drop SUCKS also it's still weirdo behavior that Selena worked for so many years on getting the teen girl suicide show made.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): this acoustic meets EDM vibe of the 2010s I do NOT miss right now, this song is generic and blah to me I fear

**Stryxen** (2): skull emoji

**Awkward\_King** (1): be fr

**bespectacIed** (1): hate tanking Rare's average, but fuck 13RW

**Hulnia** (1): naur the way i thought this was going to be good until the ncs ass drop come on üò≠

**aldwin\_is\_here** (0): There's thirteen reasons why I'd rather kill myself than to listen to this shitty lead-single for a suicide-glorifyng cunt-twisting series of disappointments.

**sage** (0): literally worst song ever the chorus instrumental is so fucking bad

**throwaway-7650** (0): I'm sorry bbb and others but wow this chorus is truly horrible

**nooodisaster** (10): Utterly love this song. This song feels at peace, a type of lowkey that promises safety and simplicity. Demi's at their best, vocally soaring at times then vulnerable the next. Excellent closer to the standard.

**followingfreeways** (6.5): just hard bc u know they can do so much better than this .

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Always a little disorienting to do a rate with deluxe tracks where you listen to the obvious closing track‚Ä¶and then there‚Äôs just a bit more.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): where‚Äôs Miley to *Drive*?

**bespectacIed** (9): This is so good, wtf

**goodbyesindisguise** (9): okay I seriously love this chilled out Demi. if this was the kind of music they were making in the present day I‚Äôd be there. Definitely my fave on the album

**ReallyCreative** (9): wait this is Demi's GIG

**TiltControls** (9): one of the more straightforward tracks on the album and it's done beautifully

**anothertown** (8): this is the same song again. except this one is better because it doesn't talk about moaning, Demi!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): it‚Äôs sweet but yeah the end of this album somewhat fizzles out. I get that this is going for chill yet defiant but it definitely makes the album a bit lopsided. This sounding so negative when I‚Äôm still giving it an 8 lol Demi sounds great and it‚Äôs a nice cut!

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): this one is cool!!! We like a good closer.

**Frelock\_** (8): A driving beat with a good melody hitchhiking along

**runaway3212** (8): she's riding the car to slaytown but she's in the backseat

**throwaway-7650** (8): pamtheyrethesamepicture.png

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): did anyone else watch that episode of The Twilight Zone in school where a lady is driving cross country but she keeps seeing a hitchhiker who keeps getting ahead of her? That one snapped

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): this chorus is so taylor swift

**impla77** (7.2): this song gets the award for most camp rock adjacent on this album

**AHSWeeknd** (7): the further the album progresses the more the filler tracks pop in

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is unremarkable but it really works when you choose to think of it as the ‚Äúend credits‚Äù song for the album.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the more falsetto part is really pretty

**pig-serpent** (7): I don't love the direction of the last 2 songs here, but it's certainly better than the direction of the rest of the album.

**cremeebrulee** (6.6): ethel cain on thoroughfare:

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): feels like filler

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Definitely one of the weirder metaphors for love I've heard

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): are hitchikers even a thing anymore? I feel like there's too much stranger danger going around for anybody to really think of it

**LesApfels** (4.5): This is literally the same song as Concrete just slightly yassified

**bogo** (4): genuinely did not notice a new song had started at first, that's how much this song blends into the background

**sydschoon** (3.5): meh

**bluetriangles04** (3): the lyrics are super fucking sweet but I'm kinda anti-everything else the song offered sadly.

#i cant even concentrate

**jasparghhh** (10): I always see people complain that the transition between this and Concentrate is off putting but I actually really dig it?? also a great closer to the standard album imo

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): concentrate but with a little more yass

**1998tweety** (8.5): this >> concentrate

**dreamingpastel** (8.1): This is just Concentrate, but with no vocoder and slightly better lyrics.

**akanewasright** (7): This song feels so similar to ‚ÄúConcentrate‚Äù‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd just cut that song and keep this one. It‚Äôs an solid song and decent closer, but it just feels so *redundant*

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this is definitely the lesser version of Concentrate lol

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this and concentrate are the same song

**fadedblue09** (6): weakest track on the standard edition. Doesn't help that it's basically an inferior clone of Concentrate

**jasannn** (6): is this a different song that concentrate? its better though

**oscarbrierley1** (6): this has better verses than concentrate, but other than that they are the same song.


**daythreeinmiami** (5.2): It sounds so like Concentrate. Like it could be the interlude.


**horridhendy** (4): I thought I'd accidentally hit repeat on Concentrate when this first comes on.

**nooodisaster** (6): Ari wrote this song first for Sweetener. And was like "yes, this is what I shall base my next album's sound around."

**followingfreeways** (3): im SORRY i just can not listen to this willingly

---

#hit it hit it hit it hit it mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it

**amr** (11): OH MY GODDDDD....IS THIS WHO WE ARE? IS THIS WHAT WE REPRESENT?

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Years Later and this still slaps

**anothertown** (10): sweetener title track is for people who are hot and intelligent

**Awkward\_King** (10): its just FUN like i dont get BOP IT GIRL

**bespectacIed** (10): If you get it, you get it. You hit it flip it twist it mix it, kiss it. Acquired taste, but it's just so silly and superficial and fun, it fits well with the forcing things to be sweet theme of the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I‚Äôm sorry, if you don‚Äôt like this then you don‚Äôt like fun! This is one of the most joyful things Ariana has released since her debut album, it makes me feel like I‚Äôm skipping through candy land.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): cheese! cheese!

**throwaway-7650** (10): [MOTHA!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd1CRcFwGrA)

**akanewasright** (9): I think about [Solange and Kelela](https://twitter.com/fransquishco/status/1110025997221617665?s=46&t=2wctsk0un8zkCepS1kxhkw) throwing ass to this song at least weekly

**Darkknuckles** (9): my initial fav off the album

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): high camp

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): HIT IT TWIST IT MIX IT ICONIC

**TiltControls** (9): the backing sounds sound a little like someone pressing random keys on a soundboard, but Ariana's vocal is amazing enough to still make this a great track

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): you're not gonna get the song the first time you hear it. after the second and third time, you're gonna be like woah what is this? it sounds nothing like anything that's in the rate right now

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): fuck... i do like the samples in this album don't i

**Stryxen** (8.5): idk why I love this song so much. Its just.. so fun honestly

**emayzee** (8.1): it's cute idk what to tell you!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): not bad for a title track, but this is easily her weakest one so far...

**runaway3212** (8): I like the way you lick my hole

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I hated this at first but it grew on me in a camp way

**goodbyesindisguise** (7.5): its goofy but it slays

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): that pre-chorus doesn‚Äôt deserve that chorus

**jsonphile** (6.5): thanks Ariana, I‚Äôve really tried to work on my bowl licking skills nice to get some appreciation

**1998tweety** (6): the prechorus slays ill give it that

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Ariana has the best album in the rate, and the worst title track. It would probably be significantly better if Pharrell wasn‚Äôt breathing in my ears the whole time.

**nt96** (6): I‚Äôm sorry but lyrics mentioning ‚Äúlick the bowl‚Äù is too hilarious to me

**PretentiousPegasus** (6): this song is the epitome of sweetener the album, fantastic parts (pre chorus) mixed with terrible parts (chorus). fitting for the title track

**slimboyfriend** (6): yuh

#make me say... oh:/

**sydschoon** (5.3): beat is heat, lyrics could be better

**bigbigbee** (5): one of the worst tummy times of my life was when I ate an entire bag of zero sugar hersheys chocolate bars in 24 hours

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Her baking instructor era

**indie\_fan\_** (4.5): this chorus is the preparation for pancakes

**daythreeinmiami** (4): I don‚Äôt think I like it. I‚Äôm not going to lie I‚Äôm really finding the production on this album to have aged considerably.

**soul-glitch** (4): I don't even mind the lyrics it's just that the instrumental sounds it was sampled from Sesame Street

**vayyiqra** (4): Deeply annoying and the whiplash between the pretty verses and obnoxious choruses (gidditgidditgiddit! sheesh!) is too much. Haha what if someone made a joke like "this song is like pouring too much sweetener into something" I bet I am the only one to make this joke just watch. yuh

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): I just don't think Pharrell's percussive production style works with Ariana here. There's a certain playfulness that Ariana is lacking in her vocal delivery to really sell this song's absolutely bouncing-off-the-walls production. As a result, everything (including her vocals) comes across as annoying and irritating.

**bluehxrizon** (3): Maybe it was too ahead of it's time for certain people

**seanderlust** (2.5): we have reached the "camp or bad?" portion of the evening

**dream\_fighter2018** (2): the ‚Äúget it get it get it‚Äù hook made me burst out laughing. The rest of the song is just a bit silly, but that hook is just bad.

**pig-serpent** (2): Finally, everyone's favorite Gravity Falls character, Tyler Cutebiker, has his own rap song.

**welcome2thejam** (2): I WANT to say this is the kind of weird that works well, but ehhh. That noise in the background of the second and final chorus is just annoying enough to work though

**dreamingpastel** (0): Oh, a ballad! The background vocals are kinda out of place, but I'm not gonna judge too harshly just yet. I mean, how can it can't possibly get-OH IT GOT WORSE OH NO AND IT KEEPS GETTING WORSE WHAT THE ABSOLUTE HELL

**Frelock\_** (0): This was the title track?

**Nerfeveryone** (0): one of the worst songs I've ever heard but it's so audacious I kinda love it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (0): where's the video of ajay realizing this album sucks during this song when you need it

 

#**MassiveThief** (5): dont make a bop it joke dont make a bop it joke dont make a bop it joke dont ma-


**hikk** (10): haha bop it

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): my girl was play bop-it in the studio and I live for it every time

**bogo** (8): ariana i don't think that's how you're supposed to play bop-it

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Yass girl! work that Bop It!

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): why they didn't make a limited edition ariana grande bop it i will never know

**Frajer** (7.5): bop it twist it pull it

**LesApfels** (7.5): Bop-It! queen

**CrimsonROSET** (7): bop it (sheesh!)

**jasparghhh** (7): -insert bop it joke here-

**bluetriangles04** (6.5): really can't get over the hit it! get it! twist it! bop it! joke soooo here's me saying it again because I'm not funny


**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (6): used to think the bop-it chorus was the worse part of this song but it's actually Pharrell's extremely annoying ad libs

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): the song itself is cool until the cringey Bop-It ass chorus that has aged terribly I‚Äôm so sorry

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Bop It!

**impla77** (3.6): Bop it ultimate edition

**NotWith10000Men** (9): god this bitch is so talented

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): sure!

**pig-serpent** (9): One of the best album openers I've heard in a long time, and there's a dramatic tension that isn't present on the rest of the album and sadly doesn't really flow into the next song.  It deserved better utilization.

**seanderlust** (9): idc yes it's just an intro but it's pretty!

**jasannn** (8.5): best intro ever?

**Around-town** (8): such a beautiful little song, I found myself wishing that every song after this was this song

**bespectacIed** (8): DID I LIE? DID I LIE? DID I FUCKING L‚ú®IIIIIIEEEEE‚ú®

**CrimsonROSET** (8): she just hit a ariana grande note

**goodbyesindisguise** (8): I mean it‚Äôs a short intro track but I think it‚Äôs effective and beautiful and I love that her gpa wrote it

**jsonphile** (8): wow what a nice pretty intro that highlights Ariana‚Äôs skills I‚Äôm sure the rest of the album will sound equally as pleasant

**RandomHypnotica** (8): it's fine, it's cute, it's pleasant but i literally never think about it

**ReallyCreative** (8): is it my favorite album intro? no, but how do you argue with these vocals exactly

**akanewasright** (7): can‚Äôt wait to see what actual songs this is gonna beat

**Awkward\_King** (7): it happens!

**bluetriangles04** (7): this sad ass intro into shaking ass blazed OH SHE'S SICK.

**Frelock\_** (7): Short, simple, but sweet.

**frogaranaman** (7): the way this 30s intro is getting a higher score from me than most of Rare

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (7): I don't feel like I can give this a higher score since it's really just an introduction and not even a full song, but it is beautiful

**MassiveThief** (7): it's pretty, does its job as an intro

**nt96** (7): Ebony Jenkins outsold

**runaway3212** (7): tears of boredom

**Stryxen** (7): last fm Twinks around the world threw parties knowing they could inflate their scrobbles legitimately looping this

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): this being in the rate is so funny how many actual songs is it going to outlive

**impla77** (6.5): I mean its like 20s..

**cremeebrulee** (6.2): Cyberpop Day 3 (many angels cried)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is pretty and all but kind of a strange opener for the album.

**rotating3Dtext** (6): ok we see you

**soul-glitch** (6): Kinda boring

**vayyiqra** (6): Too short and not memorable but pretty. yuh

**welcome2thejam** (6): Scary potential to beat a song or two with that voice

**anothertown** (5): what is the concept of this being a sad song sung joyously to open a chill happy vibes album? that missed me a bit

**bogo** (5): this would work better if it was either longer or transitioned into a different song, this and blazed are two completely different moods

**Bordersz** (5): I've never been a big fan of Ari's opening tracks.

**TheQueenofVultures** (5): i feel introduced

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Are we rating this day one release or with the patch?

**1998tweety** (4): i mean its an intro, but the bar for ari intros is so high so im gonna drag this a bit

**daythreeinmiami** (4): She was there. She opened. She did a the thing.

**TiltControls** (4): shoutout to the person who made this chuu's top ariana track

**ImADudeDuh** (3): every time an angel cries, a twink gets a new twitter account

**oscarbrierley1** (3): the vocals are impressive, but she does impressive vocals elsewhere as part of an actual song. I'm just not that interested in acapella moments.

**sydschoon** (2.5): only because I have to rate this higher than blazed and tlic

**IIIHenryIII** (2): I mean, it sounds gorgeous but this ain‚Äôt a song

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): me when vocal intros: get that out of my face. me when instrumental intros: 10!!!

**Treecoh** (1): not nearly as good as my everything's Intro. and she sounds pitchy. "an anjuuulll CUHRYYYYYYYYYYYIIYIYIYIEEDDDD"

**followingfreeways** (7): its not as bad as some of yall say it is but i definitely dont seek this out,

**nooodisaster** (7): I'm not the biggest fan of Pharrell's songs okay?! But you know, this stands as one I totally get. Ari's voice, for as acrobatic and powerful as it is, always seems at home being as laid back as she is. The song has hooks on hooks, and Pharrel's voice adds even more variety.

---

#shawty you can get BLAZED!!

**LesApfels** (11): Pharrel snapped I don't care what anyone says

**akanewasright** (10): it still kinda confuses me why this is so controversial? Like pitchfork got it right for once by giving this Best New Track I‚Äôm sorry

**anothertown** (10): busts open the saloon doors The blazed enjoyer has logged on.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): overhated!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this song is just so damn cool

**fadedblue09** (10): best of the Pharrell tracks IMO. Ari showacasing her lower range is refreshing for once

**hikk** (10): this song is so overhated/underrated... top tier on the album why lie

**pig-serpent** (10): That overly synthetic, stilted dance beat is kinda serving here, as well as the "You can get... BLAZED."  I kinda love this.

**throwaway-7650** (10): best collab in the rate sorry TLIC truthers

**goodbyesindisguise** (9.5): such an underrated song it‚Äôs so fun !!

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Pharrel is such a genius

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): over/under how many 4.2(0) scores this will have

**AHSWeeknd** (9): ohhhh, they mean getting high!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Not my favorite track on the album, but definitely one of the most fun!

**joeeswift** (9): least streamed on the album and it‚Äôll go out day 1. Blazed I‚Äôm so sorry sweetie

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): that whiplash from going ariana vocalizing to pharrell singing in the start of the song is really funny

**vayyiqra** (9): Passes the test of "can a song still be good even if Pharrell sings on it" and the bassline rules so it's doing a lot of heavy lifting here. Good ditty! yuh

**emayzee** (8.8): only on track 2 and have not listened to this album since it came out but can i just say that the pharrell hate on this album is unwarranted? (let's see if my mind changes as the album goes on)

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (8.5): groovy

**MassiveThief** (8.5): pharrell ate. i'm sorry.

**runaway3212** (8.5): nobody will ever convince me ariana does drugs

**bespectacIed** (8): it's fun and groovy, y'all are haters

**bluetriangles04** (8): this is so fucking fun I literally don't care!

**bogo** (8): pharrell get behind me

**Frelock\_** (8): She said she will never let us go. The start was rough, but once she had me with that chorus, she didn't. Solid.

**impla77** (8): This is a jam

**cremeebrulee** (7.9): pharrell's name being misspelled ctfu yall really said fuck his production fr

**ignitethephoenix** (7.9): this was one of my fave tracks first listen buts it‚Äôs shrunken over time for me mostly cause of Pharrell‚Äôs vocals. Still good though

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): this is okay, unfortunately

**bluehxrizon** (7): she made choices on this album and not all were good but i'm glad she tried

**CrimsonROSET** (7): oh pharrel we‚Äôre really in it now

**Frajer** (7): the beat is so aggressive I am going to cry

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): ariana‚Äôs vocal performance on this song is kinda outstanding

**soul-glitch** (7): Club Penguin coffee shop music

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): this was one of my favourites on release but i go over it quickly. i feel like it's not second track worthy

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): *shakes fists* PHARRELL!!!!!

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): pharrell producing this album for ari was the best creative decision she's ever made im sorry

#say no to drugs

**jasannn** (6.5): I love the harmonies but the melody is pretty lackluster and pharrell‚Äôs parts get tiring fast

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): i'm afraid that a few songs on this album that I have saved, i'm gonna end up unsaving them bc they didn't age the way I hoped

**jasparghhh** (6): this being right after raindrops is top 10 biggest jump scares in pop music

**oscarbrierley1** (6): t Its cute, but kind of weird as an album opener.

**ReallyCreative** (6): it's just not a very interesting song to me, the little background "BLAZED" parts are fun though, very Pharrell

**welcome2thejam** (6): Typing the words "dream blunt rotation" as if I've smoked weed ever in my life

**daythreeinmiami** (5.5): I guess it‚Äôs a classic Pharrel production with a classic Ariana vocal performance. I was hoping for more, but she just faded out. Which is ironic cause the song is called blazed heh.

**1998tweety** (5): i still dont know about this one

**Darkknuckles** (5): okay this was gonna be a zero at first then i heard it again and im like okay its just mid but not the worst thing ever.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): why does the album go from an angel cried immediately to this dddd

**jsonphile** (5): Pharrell I know you‚Äôre better than this I‚Äôve heard your 2000s output I‚Äôm not mad just disappointed

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): "we are going to pretend.. we didn't hear that"

**PretentiousPegasus** (3): This song isn‚Äôt actually as terrible as I remember it being? But very forgettable

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): This having like half the streams of most of the other songs on the album is so funny but also feels deserved. The song just lacks any sort of hook, it‚Äôs like listening to fog.

**sydschoon** (2): it‚Äôs Pharrel who taints this track

#baby

**Darkknuckles** (11): This song just hits different when you just wanna scream cry. I always come back to it and it still gives me goosebumps.

**indie\_fan\_** (11): probably my favorite demi song to date

**1998tweety** (10): ended that fad melanie

**AHSWeeknd** (10): oof, the emotion in this, I love it

**akanewasright** (10): ‚Äúcry baby/cry lately‚Äù is kind of a weak rhyme, but that fucking vocal performance‚Ä¶ it knocks the wind out of me

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This was battling it out for my 11, I love this song so much. I‚Äôve spent so many nights (and days if we‚Äôre being honest) screaming along with Demi on this track.

**Hulnia** (10): this is basically just dove cameron - boyfriend

**runaway3212** (10): melanie martinez your days are numbered

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): her lyrical genius omg‚Ä¶

**throwaway-7650** (10): and melanie martinez? banished to the shadow realm (DaBaby)

**bespectacIed** (9): Damn. This is a vocalist, baby. I love pop girls who say fuck it and show the girls how's it done

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Ugh‚Ä¶cry baby‚Ä¶cry lately‚Ä¶their mind is so powerful.

**oscarbrierley1** (9): the production really suits her voice, but some of the vocals towards the end sound a bit forced.

**ReallyCreative** (9): is this album turning me into a Lovatic? a Demin? a Lil' Pooter?

**welcome2thejam** (9): Was a little scared this wouldn't get past bland video game trailer commercial core, but it has some neat touches - like that stab of sound heading into the second chorus - and it builds well enough to escape that zone

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): this one was always a trifle too much for me but still a smasha

**Frajer** (8.5): this style suits their voice so well

**seanderlust** (8.5): over/under for dangerous woman references in the comment? i'm gonna say 5

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): love the wordplay and chorus!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): dove cameron-print

**PretentiousPegasus** (8): reminds me of Lauren Jauregui‚Äôs Expectations.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): whitney 4 seconds after you beat her miltank

**TiltControls** (7.5): with the lyrics weren't so clunky, cause with the vocals and guitar this track actually sounds really great

**bogo** (7): wow this is really dramatic

**goodbyesindisguise** (7): okay Demi sounds beautiful on this one. again this has that type of beat that always gets me.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): you‚Äôre goddamn right, that‚Äôs the one and only Melanie Martinez

**MassiveThief** (7): good song, but deducting points because of the tremendous L of "im no cry baby but you make me cry baby"

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the cry baby/cry lately rhyme goes on too long

**sydschoon** (7): as I go through this album it really feels like I‚Äôm here watching Demi‚Äôs breakup happen right in front of me

**RandomHypnotica** (6.3): in an alternate universe madison beer would've released this

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Pop girl meme videos have messed me up so much, I hear "Congratulaaaations!" and all I can picture is Demi telling Nicki Minaj she has a terminal stomach disease

#cry

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): good verses but that post-chorus‚Ä¶

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): ROBBE- oh wait this isnt main rap girls

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): the wordplay in this one is kinda clumsy, it‚Äôs distracting from what‚Äôs an otherwise alright song

**flava** (5): Demi oversinging like someone told them this was gonna be the next Bond theme

**Frelock\_** (5): I didn't cry, or laugh, but it was ok

**anothertown** (4): i understand what they were trying to achieve with the blues type guitar but this just sounds dumb.

**impla77** (4): Too simple for the shit lyrics

**redgold51** (4): starting here, the second half of the album just doesn‚Äôt do it for me anymore.

**cremeebrulee** (3): meg & dababy washed idc idc

**ImADudeDuh** (3): *hand motions from one level to a level lower*

**pig-serpent** (2): "I'm no cry baby, but you make me cry baby."  Truly a once in a generation lyrical genius.

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): I get that they can sing, but that doesn't mean their songs are good

**nooodisaster** (10): Story of this album: All the deluxe tracks are a different tier of quality than any on the standard. Case in point: this lively, fun lead single of the re-issue. I'll also never get over the fact that the marketing for this single was "Fuck, COVID happened, um, nevermind I don't want a boyfriend I want world peace!"

---

#you're looking for a boyfriend i see that

**AHSWeeknd** (10): People we‚Äôre like she needs to return to the Bad Liar/Fetish sound, and she did. PERIOD.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Selena is not a very technically good singer but she‚Äôs a solid actress and that sells this song, I love how pouty and put out she sounds about not having a boyfriend. It feels like she‚Äôs singing through the haze of a fever, in a good way.

**seanderlust** (10): i was gonna clown this but i'm not gonna act like i didn't download [redacted "dating" app] like four separate times in my early 20s with this same sentiment in mind.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): a whole bop love this sound for selena

**throwaway-7650** (10): selena has never been more relatable outside of being over JB

**bluetriangles04** (9.5): loved this beat from the get-go, and the subject matter is a bit relatable, "there's a difference between a want and a need"

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): well‚Ä¶ she outsold her ex

**Awkward\_King** (9): giving this a good score because this is really fun the first time you hear it but the next 19 less so

**bespectacIed** (9): This song's production is sooo excellent

**bluehxrizon** (9): selena and julia michaels always maxmize their joint slay

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): this song is just so hot lol

**Lilacly\_Adily** (9): I remember hating this song when it was first released but it slowly grew on me. I still can‚Äôt totally believe I gave it such a high score.

**Stryxen** (9): "She was in the studio mad as hell" and its just selena mumbling on boyfriend

**welcome2thejam** (9): I mean, if I'm not gonna listen to Kanye then I will absolutely take songs that kinda sound like Fade

**Around-town** (8): I listened to this on repeat when if came out and it still holds up

**fadedblue09** (8): this was better than I remembered? Love the dark electropop vibes

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): I heard the lyrics as ‚Äúthere is a difference between a 1 and a me‚Äù and I was gonna be like ‚Äúis there now‚Äù but yes there is

**vayyiqra** (8): Kind of underwhelming as an opener but it does slap so !

**akanewasright** (7.7): between this video and that one Weeknd video‚Ä¶ what the hell was going on in 2019-20 with turning men into frogs ?

**anothertown** (7.5): try to take a shortcut üòõ but i get cut ü´¢

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): its close to great, it just lacks a bit of energy and feels a bit sterile.

**goodbyesindisguise** (7): I love how crisp it is but i also think it‚Äôs kind of clumsily put together

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): people will drag this song for how it sounds (which is fair) but like she spilled here and I bet some of the lowest scores can relate

**emayzee** (6.7): the boyfriend in question: the guy from the chainsmokers

**daythreeinmiami** (6.5): Those claps are as dry as my dads elbows.

**sydschoon** (6.5): I loved this track when it came out but it got old for me fast sorry

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i swear to god every song titled ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù is alright to meh with the one exception of Tegan and Sara.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): She sounds like she's pouting this is so funny

**CrimsonROSET** (5): gasp, this one night stand doesn‚Äôt want a relationship


#im so looooonely

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): it‚Äôs an ok song but i feel her

**plastichaxan** (5): This sounds like one of those songs posted to the subreddit with 5 upvotes

**impla77** (4.7): This seems familiar to me, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve heard it before or if its too reminiscent of many other songs

**ReallyCreative** (4): I want you to get a boyfriend too bc you're one of those annoying single people aren't you babe

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): the most boring guy I ever dated was really into this song, take that for what you will

**apatel27** (3): NCS beat

**dreamingpastel** (1): HORRIBLE hook.

**Hulnia** (1): hyperpop queen!!

**pig-serpent** (1): This feels like Selena's regular producer and DJ mustard circa 2014 fighting over control of the beat, and the result is a mess of exaggerated hand clap sound and terrible anti drops.  I can't believe they thought this should replace the title track as the album opener.


# **hikk** (8): anticipating the comment section of "me too" "she's just like me fr" "don't we all" etc etc and well ... put me there too pls

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): as a geeky but mentally deranged queer, I relate!

**soul-glitch** (10): She's just like me fr

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (9): relatable bop

#daddy's little girl


**pig-serpent** (11): This is just a Zara Larsson song (complimentary.)  Also this has good production but the same producers who did all the bad production on this album?  It seems like they're better going full dance pop instead of trying master real instruments, or those other songs were made under a horrible time crunch/had a lot of executive meddling.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): somehow the twinkiest option for an 11 in a rate with ariana grande

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now, this production SNAPPED

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Can‚Äôt deny that this is a bop that‚Äôll exit the rate at day 2

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Listen this is the kind of song where cringe lyrics are a feature, not a bug.

**bogo** (10): me in indieheads charity

**Bordersz** (10): Vulnerable, the beat bangs, and vocals are top tier. Love this song, it always catch people off guard with how real the lyrics are lol.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): they took several swims in the parent pond for this one

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): The camp self-effacing humor in this one‚Ä¶this walked so Carly - Beach House could run

**Darkknuckles** (10): Theres a few songs on this album i still go back to and this is one of them because stop calling me out while also making me dance Demi.

**fadedblue09** (10): one of my instant faves, the chorus hits like a truck

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is an especially funny listen in the context of the rest of Demi‚Äôs discography, which does have several songs devoted to father, but I think it‚Äôs great that she was able to channel this part of her history into something self-aware and relatable. I‚Äôm obsessed with the simple boldness of the lyrics (‚ÄúI might want your kid‚Äù Demi PLEASE) and it‚Äôs relentlessly catchy, I was surprised it never got pushed as a single but I‚Äôm fairly certain it‚Äôs a fan favorite.

**hikk** (10): YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

**jasparghhh** (10): demi subverting her genre of songs about her dad being the biggest bop on the album was the highlight of 2017

**letsallpoo** (10): they came on this mad as hell

**musical\_pyn** (10): demi said you're not toxic if you know you're toxic <3

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): this will place high because a lot of Popheads users can relate with this title

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): easily the highlight of the album

**throwaway-7650** (10): just adding to the controversy score (but this is good tho fr)

**akanewasright** (9): is this hyperpop?

**Awkward\_King** (9): banger tbh

**bespectacIed** (9): girls will really make a catchy synthpop banger out of something no one should admit at gunpoint before going to therapy smh

**Frelock\_** (9): Can't relate, but fun!

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): Demi Rae Jepsen

**ReallyCreative** (9): imagine her scream-belting "I'VE GOT ALL THESE DADDY ISSUES" on a date at like, Olive Garden

**runaway3212** (9): you know what... i might not relate but good for you queen

**Stryxen** (9): does every Demi tracklist go smash -> fine -> smash -> fine -> smash like this

**TiltControls** (9): it's an odd song, but no doubt catchy

**flava** (8.5): seeing all the hate for this song and it‚Äôs my favourite song on the standard edition of the album is certainly a vibe

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): oh wait till the gays hear about this one

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): I had to check that I wasn't listening to a censored version, teasing the f drop is so unneccesary here

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): I got one, don't worry

**daythreeinmiami** (8): THE SYNTH HITS SO HARD

**IIIHenryIII** (8): lucky for you I got all these daddy issues too, Demi (I‚Äôm lying)

**MassiveThief** (8): very well written banger, just the hook weren't I GOT AAALLL THESE DADDY ISSUES

**mylps9** (8): same tho.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I've seen Daddy Issues get clowned on a lot around here, but I've never actually heard it until now. I uh‚Ä¶ didn't expect it to be synthpop? Also didn't expect it to bop so much??

**welcome2thejam** (8): I know they're going for the whole "downbeat lyrics with upbeat sound" thing, but as much as I liked it, it's a bit too chipper to really blend right and get the double digits

**bigbigbee** (7.5): they sound a little like Taylor Swift at the start of this song. (And then they don‚Äôt, obviously)

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (7.5): "you're the man of my dreams, cause you know how to leave" crying screaming throwing up

**Frajer** (7): the production and lyrics feel like different songs

**ignitethephoenix** (7): don‚Äôt get why this is the hyped song from the fans, her voice sounds extra strained here and the production is weird

#fatherless behavior 

**LesApfels** (6.5): I wish the chorus lasted longer

**oscarbrierley1** (6): why is it censored? it always makes me do a double take when there's just a gap.

**sydschoon** (6): unique track but the production is a little to much for me

**sage** (5.6): the prod is just so underwhelming but its not bad

**plastichaxan** (5): I have them too and I‚Äôd make a better song about it I think

**jackisboredtoday** (4.8): yeah i wanna defend this one but i just don‚Äôt like it‚Ä¶. Demi has actually handled some of these topics pretty decently at other points but the tone of this one just feels so uncomfortable to listen to lyrically

**jsonphile** (4): Demi can be incredibly sexy in her music. Nothing is less sexy than bringing up daddy issues please Demi stop

**nt96** (4): Could‚Äôve sworn I was listening to Midnights for a sec lol

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): look, same but you could‚Äôve written a better song about it

**goodbyesindisguise** (3): the video game sound effect production is not for me

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): cringe inducing

**cremeebrulee** (2.5): the chorus is on this is atrocious

**Lilacly\_Adily** (2): The song‚Äôs already marked explicit, just say the full curse

**NotWith10000Men** (2): the production is ass and subject matter is weird

**apatel27** (0): People with daddy issues are scary

**babadork** (0): Your kink is not my kink or whatever, this is a no. I could more easily sing along with a sexy song from the perspective of the guy from My Strange Addiction that has sex with balloons.

**CrimsonROSET** (0): therapy didn't work *shablam* i have attachment issues *death drop* this relationship isn't healthy for me *voguing*

**frogaranaman** (0): low effort subreddit joke

**ImADudeDuh** (0): the part before the bridge where demi and the beat are fighting each other, this was traumatic

**seanderlust** (0): this is a song that would be a joke song in the show crazy ex-girlfriend

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): this could actually be on Once Twice Melody

#only comment that mattered

**indie\_fan\_** (10): Nothing coulda prepared me for when I saw "Tell Me You Love Me" trend on twitter, making me think that Lovatics got Demi's upcoming 5th anniversary to trend. Only for me to click that portion for me to see that phrase was trending because Cardi reposted a video of Akbar giving Tjay h--d repeatedly saying "Tell Me You Love Me Too" and all she get in response is "man eat that d-ck!" as part of an at-the time feud between Akbar and Cardi.


#i wuv you:3

**SaisonMarguerite** (11): :sobsing: This is not a snapshot of a healthy relationship by any means, but it is an emotional and honest one. I'm blown away every time by the balance of fragility and power in Demi's soulful vocal performance. Yeah, co-dependency shouldn't be romanticized, but sometimes you have to allow yourself to feel those messy emotions to move forward, and this song is perfect for that.

**1998tweety** (10): I remember religiously watching this song bop around the mid 50s on the weekly charts

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This aged so excellently

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): You can say a lot of things about Demi‚Äôs musical output, but you CANNOT say that they can‚Äôt sing.

**bogo** (10): i love you

**Bordersz** (10): Vocals on point.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): what Taylor said when she released that Midnights clock to her fans

**daythreeinmiami** (10): the trumpets with that guitar whammy or bass I don‚Äôt know what, it just all slaps. The emotions in her vocals give me goosebumps. One of her best songs. They had this on the radio rotation at work and sometimes I just had to stop what I was doing to just listen to the song when it came on. It‚Äôs so good.

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): in a perfect world this was a 10 week global #1 hit

**throwaway-7650** (10): [spanglish queen](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Tcc4BHv7LBnanf9yLnWCI?si=be66f676746e4b9e)

**jsonphile** (9.5): probably my favorite Demi Lovato song. Powerful vocals, anthemic production, just an all around great song

**Frajer** (9): fine Demi I love you

**Frelock\_** (9): Love the energy this has

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Demi has always been a vocal beast and I love it when they just let loose on a track with bombastic production, a wall of noise is nice every now and then. Appreciate the vulnerability on this track but the music video really flips the song on its head in a cool way.

**sydschoon** (8.8): I love this track, very powerful and relatable

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): she always eats on a power ballad

**ReallyCreative** (8.1): I don't love the messaging of "you ain't nobody til you got somebody" but getting a boyfriend did change my life pretty significantly... Debbi Louboutin you win this round

**akanewasright** (8): this is (imo) one of the weaker ‚Äúbelting blood for guts‚Äù songs on the album‚Ä¶ but like‚Ä¶ Demi‚Äôs still REALLY in their element with this song

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): this is great as well

**Around-town** (8): this is my new favorite song

**bespectacIed** (8): very anthemic. She's a singer. Cool mv

**Darkknuckles** (8): some days this song hits so hard and somedays its a skip.

**fadedblue09** (8): taking off points for "you ain't nobody till you got somebody"

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I love the verses, can‚Äôt say the same for the rest of the song

**NotWith10000Men** (8): needs just a little more oomph

**TiltControls** (7.5): sorry not sorry, but with a bit more actual feeling behind it

**cremeebrulee** (7.2): you just said you're not sorry üò≠

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.2): hap-peh

**bluehxrizon** (7): it makes me feel bad thinking about how she did a big grammy campaign for this album after Confident got nominated and just got ignored

**CrimsonROSET** (7): ‚Äòyou aint nobody til you got somebody‚Äô no i‚Äôm single and fine that‚Äôs between you and therapy

**goodbyesindisguise** (7): their vocals are really pretty on this one. also I love horns. The ending kinda drags a bit though

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Listen, I can only handle so much Demi screaming at once

#man eat that dick

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): demi‚Äôs kinda on their oversinging schtick again a little huh

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): yeah I could definitely hear this going off in the grocery store

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): this was a weak follow up single to sorry not sorry, totally killed the momentum for the era

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): you literally said you're not sorry in the last song make up your mind

**impla77** (6): slightly dull

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (6): the music and Demi's singing is just so overly dramatic and intense, I know this is kind of Demi's thing and sometimes it works but here it feels like too much to me sorry

**Stryxen** (6): can't say I do

**Awkward\_King** (5): idk why i just didnt believe people when they said demi made gospel music

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this song really said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre single? Fucking loser‚Äù

**jasannn** (5): it frustrates me that this the stadium ready instrumental does not have a stadium ready melody to match its energy

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): shrunk on me tbh the instruments are louder than they need to be

**runaway3212** (5): the video for this song is so bad but it's also the only memorable thing about it

**bluetriangles04** (4): I feel like this really isn't powerful enough/doesn't stand out enough for a title track. interestingly enough though its not like I hate it. It's just kinda there.

**anothertown** (3): this is army commercial music

**flava** (3): it‚Äôs the kind of overclingy and oversung ballad that just repels me

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): didn‚Äôt we rate AB/AP last month what is this

**pig-serpent** (1.5): I thought the horns were coming to save this song, but unfortunately having a few flowers on your porch won't make the inside of your house any cleaner.

Honestly, I'm super shocked this is this low. Yes, it's merely missing out from Day 3, but I swore this would be right up popheads' alley, and perhaps it is, it's lowest score were 4s (which is insane to me, some of our highest rated songs have had multiple lower scores), but I guess as a whole people didn't feel too strongly about it to give it the push of high scores this would need. I blame this flopping on the oversaturation of funky retro songs in the last few years. I truly believe this would have ended higher had we rated this before everyone tried to release their own Future Nostalgia reject.

**nooodisaster** (7): Fun, uptempo bop.

#feels so good

**1998tweety** (10): this was cunty

**AHSWeeknd** (10): She‚Äôs best when she‚Äôs sing-talking

**Awkward\_King** (10): she's so lucky this came out before future nostalgia and after hours like this wasnt unbearably overdone yet

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I gotta say I like the track order on the deluxe much better than the original album.

**bluehxrizon** (10): she deserves to be jailed for not sequencing this after LYTLM

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): idk guys I think Rare is a good album lmao

**hikk** (10): the bass is so nasty i love

**jasannn** (10): What did Selena do to have so many songs with incredible production?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this really has no right to go this hard

**throwaway-7650** (10): a basic potential day 3 cut but when it's right it's right. like...

**vayyiqra** (10): This is a jam. Don't argue with me.

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): it's a bit criminal that the pandemic killed this song's promo, it's one of the better tracks here

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): why wasn't this the second single? its so much more of a bop than look at her flop. it would've been a great first week clubs opened since covid single.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): wow, this is great!

**Frelock\_** (9): Definitely would dance!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Jennifer Lopez ü§ù Selena Gomez - Not being able to sing but still releasing good songs called ‚ÄúDance Again‚Äù

**ignitethephoenix** (9): oh this is much more of a bop than I remember. Although it does feel like a revival cut

**Stryxen** (9): finally gagging again

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): @selena do more songs like this thnx

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): drummers in remission? Honestly idc its bopping

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): this has the same energy as p!nk's never gonna not dance again (flop)

**dreamingpastel** (8): https://youtu.be/nBHkIWAJitg?t=74

**runaway3212** (8): sometimes I think "isn't it hypocritical that selena said 'vulnerable aint easy, believe me, but I go there' while not ever revealing anything that vulnerable on this entire album" but 3 seconds later im bopping again

**welcome2thejam** (8): Once again this is a groove I'd be all over if it didn't sound so sterile or had more of a bite, even a little more oomph and it'd be an easy 11 contender

**emayzee** (7.5): the bass is doing the heavy lifting here

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): she‚Äôs cute

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): it‚Äôs no hands to myself but the at least it‚Äôs one of the few songs on this album with a groove

**anothertown** (7): Bop but make it soulless

**bespectacIed** (7): almost made it thru the cutoff for the pandemic disco renaissance

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): lets get it 2010s JLo

**akanewasright** (6.5): I feel like this is missing something, but I do like that bassline

**bluetriangles04** (6): this one has nice vibes, kinda does make me want to "dance again" hahaha... okay i'll stop.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): I WANNA DANCE! AND LOVE! AND DANCE! AGAIN!

#~~selena gomez~~ two left feet

**NotWith10000Men** (6): too monotonous

**TiltControls** (5.5): people telling me what song they wanted to rerate from vgv

**sydschoon** (5.3): for a song about dancing, it doesn‚Äôt really make me want to dance ya know?

**amr** (5): nice bridge

**goodbyesindisguise** (5): its honestly not as bad as I remember i think because I actually love dancing more now

**jasparghhh** (5): this song definitely did not make me want to dance that's for sure

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I don't wanna dance to this

**bogo** (4.5): dancing where? in the produce section at walmart?

**ReallyCreative** (4): the way she pronounces "dance" makes her seem like she's never danced before actually

throwaway-7650: honestly blazed overperformed, it deserved top 10 but I'm just glad it was able to make the top half at all (I was expecting it to do not that much better than borderline)
