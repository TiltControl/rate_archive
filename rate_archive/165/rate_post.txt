Ex-Acts' "Most Personal Album Yet™️" Rate (Ariana Grande / Demi Lovato / Selena Gomez)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/102hs06/exacts_most_personal_album_yet_rate_ariana_grande/

It was a well known fact in the 2000’s that if you were a starry-eyed child actor with ambitions and dreams greater than those your rich parents could provide by themselves, there were only 2 places you could go to fulfill them; the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. 
These two juggernauts on the entertainment industry that had already launched multiple young talents to stardom had momagers all around the country hustling to get their little angels auditions, because landing a role for any of these networks would open the doors to opportunities that only the utmost elite has access to. Those fortunate enough to hit it big would get to enjoy the A-list child star experience; main billing in advertisement for their future projects, their face plastered in every merch item imaginable, a guaranteed spot in the front page of teen gossip magazines, a lifetime of being able to profit off of the nostalgia experienced from people that grew up watching them… It’s pretty much a golden ticket to the upper echelon of the entertainment industry, but to quote one of the starlets in the rate, [everything is not as it seems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iucp3njdf3Q). The single biggest problem that someone put in this position will have to deal with; if you ignore child labour exploitation, paparazzi invading your personal space, media outlets and the public constantly analyzing and judging your private life, not being allowed to live a normal teenager life, being exposed to substance abuse at a young age, ending vulnerable to people that abuse their power over you; is the fact that now you’ve been branded as a Disney/Nick star, which is fine in the beginning, but once you grow up and wish to be more than “that girl from that one show I used to watch when I was 9” it becomes a very difficult stain to get rid off.

So at that point what do you do? Well, you accept every mature role offered to you, you hit up the hottest producers and work with them to create some bangers in hopes they become actual hits and reach an audience that never even knew you from your child-sitcom days, you take advantage of your good looks and go on stage wearing heavy makeup and a leotard and tell terrified parents in the crowd “LOOK AT ME, I’M NOT A KID ANYMORE!!”. This will be very effective in separating you from the previous conglomerate that had a monopoly on your likeness, but it will come with the caveat of people merely recognizing your name, but not really *knowing you*... Here is when ***Your Most Personal Album Yet™*** enters the conversation.

The ***Most Personal Album Yet™*** is a tool of reinvention used by many artists, even those that didn’t start their careers under the regime of a child star industry. This album must come after a widespread time of turmoil for the subject. It might be a public breakup with another A-lister, a well-documented breaking point after years of dealing with the superstar lifestyle, or just a very intense period where the public can’t get enough of condemning your every move; the most important aspect is a situation where it’s needed for the artist to reclaim the narrative and go on a promo tour introducing the world to ***The Real Me™***. Sonically, there doesn’t need to be all that many changes to what you were doing before; you can continue working with those producers that were able to land you hits; but you will have to use those acting skills to sell that this album truly represents the most real and genuine version of you. A version of you that you’ve always been too scared to display, a version of you that no one has ever gotten to see before and the only way to witness it is once the ***Most Personal Album Yet™*** is out in stores and available on all streaming platforms. 

This time around we’ll be having a look at 3 of our favorite’s ex-acts and the albums that not only opened up to us about the previous difficulties they had to deal with, but also served us with spectacular synth-filled pop bangers that have become staples in their catalog, and jams experimenting with sounds not previously explored by the stars beforehand.

# [Ariana Grande - Sweetener](https://i.imgur.com/ei9VNRl.png) (2018)

^(Written by u/nooodisaster)

Sweetener, Ariana Grande’s 4th studio album, is joy birthed from tragedy.

On May 22nd, 2017 at Ariana’s Dangerous Woman tour, a suicide bomber claimed the lives of 23 people. This evil, infamous act affected untold amounts of people, including Ariana who initially thought she would never perform again. However, she came back to the spotlight with the charity concert One Love Manchester, raising £10 million in charity, and filling the same stadium that just weeks ago had been filled with terror with 55,000 joyous fans. 

In the year that followed, she would go to therapy, and began dating Pete Davidson which… Well that’s a story for [another album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl1aHhXnN1k). As of the release date of Sweetener, they were madly in love, and Ariana would burst into schoolgirl smiles anytime he was mentioned.

The trauma and joy of the past two years of her life synthesizes into the pop, R&B and trap sounds of Sweetener. Ariana worked heavily with Pharrell Williams, creating the first songs with him. That sound would prove controversial on release. She also worked with Max Martin and similar pop titans, who helped produce the lead single “No Tears Left to Cry”, a joyous anthem about moving beyond tragedy. It peaked at #3 on Billboard Top 100. 

Upon release, the album was a commercial and critical success, topping the Billboard 200, garnering Ariana her first Grammy, and appearing as #11 on Pitchfork best albums of 2018. The other singles, God is a Woman, and Breathin peaked at #8 and #12 respectively on the Hot 100. Sweetener’s legacy is mixed, with many praising it as her most complex and unique work, while others fault the Pharrell production for being… [abrasive](https://youtu.be/6tNQAxTvou8).

# [Demi Lovato - Tell Me You Love Me](https://imgur.com/abbjeT8) (2017)

^(Written by u/rickikardashian)

Demi has always occupied a sort of weird spot within the former child actors circle. They’re considerably bigger than the majority of the Disney Channel/Nickelodeon roster, but also notably smaller than her contemporaries. It felt like at any given point in her career she was lost behind the shadow of Miley, Selena or Ariana, only ever reaching the same notoriety when people publicly discussed her mental health struggles. 

Her 2015 album, *Confident*, already brought us a more risque, sexier Demi, with the success of the [controversially bi-curious](https://twitter.com/popcrave/status/878222415414796288) *Cool For The Summer*, but while they had no plans on stepping away from that racy image, they wanted to transition from EDM-Party-diva to a more mature and sultry profile. Inspired by fellow former Disney star Christina Aguilera and her album *Stripped*, Lovato started working on a more soulful, R&B-tinted sound, and so, on October 2017; on the same day that Miley Cyrus’ 6th album would also come out; *Tell Me You Love Me* was released.

It was always a known fact what a powerhouse vocalist Demi is; a staple of their albums are big ballads belted all the way through; but no other project of theirs have showcased the strength of their skill like this one does. Songs like the gospel-inspired title track, or the self-reflection letter disguised as a breakup song, *You Don’t Do It For Me Anymore*, were handcrafted to exhibit the full capabilities of their voice. Thankfully, the project isn’t missing the catchy electropop we’ve come to expect from Demi; with tracks like the vocoder-laced fan favorite *Daddy Issues* or the funky sex jam *Sexy Dirty Love* injecting some energy to the tracklist; but without a doubt the standout song from the album is by far *Sorry Not Sorry*. Regardless of a change in sound and image, the aforementioned party anthem; much similar to previous Lovato hits; would go on to not only become the biggest song of the release, but out of her entire career, peaking at #6 on the Billboard Top 100 and allowing the artist to enjoy the most success they had ever experienced.

# [Selena Gomez - Rare](https://i.imgur.com/WNEGtJg.png) (2020)

^(Written by u/followingfreeways)

It’s October 23rd, 2019. My mom, a pop culture fiend, texts me “OMG. Selena’s new song is about Justin. It’s really good” Whether you too heard it from your mom, the radio, or twitter, there’s no denying that Lose You to Love Me brought Selena back into the music industry spotlight in a way she hasn’t been since Wolves released in October 2017. The single went to #1 on Billboard, followed shortly by her second single Look at Her Now peaking at #27. Everyone was excited when Selena announced Rare would be released January 10th 2020–love her or hate her, Selena is a star born out of nostalgia that almost everyone can’t help but root for. We wanted to see how she was doing, not just since she officially ended one of (arguably) most popular celebrity relationships, but also since we’ve seen her struggle with her mental and physical health.

Rare is considered her most vulnerable album by Selena herself. With writing credits on all 13 tracks (17 on the deluxe edition), Selena explores the heartbreak of relationships, the partying of your 20s, and the journey to self-love and letting go. Rare earned ⅘ stars from Rolling Stone, a 6.8 from Pitchfork, and gave Selena her third consecutive number-one album in the US, as well as several other countries. Popheads likes to root for Selena, but many were disappointed that Rare wasn’t sonically similar to Fetish and Bad Liar. Now that it’s been three years, people might appreciate some of the chill and bright songs where she ~~sings~~ whispers her heart off, like *Cut You Off* or *Vulnerable*, or the fun and sassy confidence boosters, like *Boyfriend* and *Ring*.

# Bonus Rate

If we’re talking ex-acts, it’s essential that Miley Cyrus gets brought up to the conversation. Ever since she became the biggest success any of the children entertainment channels had ever pumped out, Miley spent the rest of her post-Disney career trying to find herself and change the image the general public had of her, claiming each album cycle that this time we were getting to finally know *The Real Miley™* and denouncing some part of her repertoire.

After the extremely polarizing yet culturally relevant rollout of *Bangerz*; and also whatever *[Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7hWBJ6Vg-M)* was; Miley decided to pull her most shocking stunt yet. She let her hair grow again, got back with ex-fiance Liam Hemsworth, and embraced her ~~whiteness~~ country roots by releasing her 6th studio album, [*Younger Now*](https://i.imgur.com/3V64zUc.png). Despite being released around the same time as these albums, fitting the rate’s theme and having many defender (me), there was no clear interest in ever rating this entire project, but this lineup would simply be incomplete without the queen of the *Most Personal Album Yet™*, so in her honor, we’ll have lead single and top 10 hit *Malibu* in the bonus rate.

It’s fully optional to rate it, but c’mon, it’s a single 4 minute… Just know that I’ll judge you slightly if you don’t. **You may NOT give this an 11 or a 0**, only scores ranging from 1 to 10.

# Rules

* You must listen to every single song and assign them a score from 1 to 10, 10 being the most positive score you can give. **Ballots with scores missing won’t be accepted**.

* You may use up to one decimal spot in your scores, meaning that you can give a song a **7.8** or a **6.9**, but not a **8.472** or a **6.66**. If you do use decimals, remember to use a dot ( . ) and not a comma ( , ).

* You have the option to give one song a zero (0) and one song an eleven (11) **across the entire rate**. These should be reserved for your least favorite and favorite track. Songs in the bonus rate can't be given these scores.

* Use the prepared format found [**HERE**](https://tinyurl.com/ExActsRate) to fill in and send your scores. If for some reason, that link isn’t working, [**HERE’S A PASTEBIN WITH THE FORM**](https://pastebin.com/1z1ueRdQ)  and you can send it to /u/ExActsRate.

* Leaving comments for each song is encouraged but not required. To do so, leave a space after your score and write your comment, like this:
 
 > Kinda Crazy: 10 She's so crazzzzzzzzzzy! Love her!!!
 
    That is the only correct format when leaving comments. Anything else is incorrect and won’t be accepted.
 
* If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon ( : ) after the album name and put your comment there.
 
 > Album: Sweetener: where is evermore and pop 2?
 
* If at any point you’d like to change one of your scores or comments, just message u/ExActsRate explaining what changes you’d like to make.
 
* Keep in mind that your ballot isn’t confidential! Every single score and comment will be revealed to the public and attached to your name, so be careful out there…
 
* **Sabotage will not be tolerated**, and we’ll reserve the right to ask you to change scores, write more comments, or straight up reject your ballot if we’re suspicious you’re trying to mess up the results. Don’t be an ass, this is supposed to be fun for everyone.
