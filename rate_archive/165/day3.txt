Damn, she just can't catch a break can she?

This single sort off just went under the radar, despite in my opinion being the strongest out of the ones she had released for the album. It's simple, it's quirky, and it's a pretty good representation of the album's overall sound, but I do fear that perhaps it's lowkey nature is what made some people not care for it.

Also I WILL defend Selena here and claim that as nice as [Charli XCX' demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKkFNQ4qRKw) is, it's NOT better than Selena's version. Her fragile, whispery vocals don't work for all songs, but for this one it does

---
**followingfreeways** (8): queen of putting toast in the toaster. i love doing that

**nooodisaster** (6): Someone gave Selena a rhyme dictionary, she flipped to "R" and felt real clever. But seriously, such a lifeless song. I remember my first time listening to this album, the realization that all that waiting resulted in... this. And later on in the album listening, that this was actually one of the BETTER ones.

---

#UNIQUE

**Lilacly\_Adily** (11): Fetish was *this* close to being my 11 but I love this song just a little bit more.

**Awkward\_King** (10): best song on the album and im making a point not to listen to the charli version bc i just know that'll be better :sob:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): ‚Ä¶Now why wasn‚Äôt this a hit? I wouldn‚Äôt have minded hearing this every time I went to Walmart.

**bluehxrizon** (10): i love the weird percussion she used in this era

**IIIHenryIII** (10): so underrated

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): this is natasha bedingfield-core it makes me want to be a white woman and frollick in a field of flowers with a sundress on

**runaway3212** (10): this song completely flopping but it was a hit on the u/runaway3212 hot 100 so

**soul-glitch** (10): Quirky fun catchy empowering

**throwaway-7650** (10): not rare going from the worst to best title track for me while rating

**CrimsonROSET** (9): in case nobody told you today you‚Äôre special

**NotWith10000Men** (9): i forgot i loved this song omg

**akanewasright** (8.5): this is a honestly a fantastic song for Selena‚Äôs voice, like she kinda nailed it here

**bigbigbee** (8.5): ‚Äúrare‚Äù is such a fucking pain to say out loud, feels like my cheeks committing a coup against my teeth

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): me finding a Suicine or Raikou in Pokemon ha ha put me in the Pokemon joke section (or worse if there‚Äôs no Pokemon section, I really can‚Äôt commit to this bit huh)

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I can hear the Clairoprint all over this. IMO this is still the superior opening track

**TiltControls** (8.5): are we talking feebas rare or shiny rare

**sydschoon** (8.2): catchy chill bop

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): it's rare that she found a Charli XCX demo where she's better than her.

**anothertown** (8): toe to tip that's Taylor Swift

**Frelock\_** (8): Not as rare as it claims, but it's good, none the less. A couple of catchy hooks too!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): thinking about how they put this on Just Dance and expected people to dance to this

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): **im gonna assume rare in this context means undercooked because that is funnier**

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**jasannn** (7.5): you can do the m3gan dance to this song

**cremeebrulee** (7): selena is like an anti-rihanna because she NEEDS to quit music and pursue makeup full time asap... like the rare beauty concealer & blush are quite good....

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): at about 1:20, the sound dove out for a few seconds and I was very confused because I thought it‚Äôd paused and I couldn‚Äôt figure out why. Turns out that‚Äôs a feature, not a bug.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I like the quirkiness but hearing [the Vardaan Arora cover that turns the song into a more traditional synthpop song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0GWbWqbkBg) kinda ruined the original for me.

**horridhendy** (7): Good but a little repetitive

**jasparghhh** (7): knowing that Charli XCX recorded this song before Selena really soured me on this era as a whole because i just couldn't buy the "most personal album" shtick like I could for Ariana and Demi when the album's namesake wasn't even originally for Selena

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): it's cute but i associate it with the pandemic starting lmao

**welcome2thejam** (7): Suppose it was a bit naive to think Selena Gomez would dedicate a whole song to Donkey Kong Country 2 & Goldeneye 64

#common

**pig-serpent** (6): With my low expectations, I thought this song was really good until I listened to it next to the Ari songs I like, and realized it's pretty mid, I just had low expectations.

**impla77** (5.8): Wouldn‚Äôt say this song is shining proof that Selena is rare

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): yawn

**bespectacIed** (5): Wtf is this nursery rhyme songwriting?? Too bad cuz the production is fucking flawless. This is my main complaint about the whole album, she paid a millions to the producers, 3 dollars and pizza party for the writers

**daythreeinmiami** (5): I prefer the beauty brand over the song.

**Stryxen** (5): I guess it's good but not feeling her. Kinda generic actually she should really change the title

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Rare? More like‚Ä¶ I don't care!! Haha I'm so smart (someone help me)

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): the song FINALLY gets interesting towards the last iterations of the chorus but the vocals are just not there girlie


# [burning toast on the toaster](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/selena-gomez-rare-toasters)


**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is what Katy Perry wish she could have done writing quirky lines like ‚Äúburning toast on the toaster‚Äù

**vayyiqra** (10): This is a jam and no I don't care about the toaster line it's cute and funny and relatable! Tell me you've never spaced out and burnt toast before. Jesus even said, "Let he who has never burnt toast type the first 0".

**goodbyesindisguise** (8): burning toast in the toaster </3

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (8): burning toast in the toaster is nowhere near as bad of a lyric as I've seen people make out! It's not lyrical genius but I've heard a lot worse from some of this sub's faves! Anyway this is a bop

**slimboyfriend** (8): she was so real for burning toast in the toaster and thank god she did because this is one of three bops on this album

**MassiveThief** (7.5): ghost? ghost??? GHOST?????         toast!

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Why is she talking about a toaster omg

**bluetriangles04** (6.5): GIRL UNPLUG THAT TOASTER!

**bogo** (6): "saw us getting older, burning toast in the toaster" is selena having a stroke

**hikk** (6): when she went on live right after album drop and completely forgot what "burning toast in the toaster" was from, that's history

**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): burning toast in the toaster!

**flava** (3): **when I heard that toaster line, I was gonna say ‚ÄúJulia Michaels will one day pay for her crimes against music‚Äù but then I looked at the credits and saw she didn‚Äôt have a writing credit**

Very unfortunate that this song clicked for me once it was too late to change scores, because I just realized this is a pretty cool song for Selena. I really like the theory that this is part of whatever Bad Liar/Fetish might have been leading to (even if it might be easily debunked by a google search,,, but there's a reason why I didn't look it up) because it really fits well with those 2 songs. It's very seductive and mysterious, and I love that trumpet(?) sample. It's just a very sweet tune and I'm glad it received the recognition it deserved.

---

**nooodisaster** (10): OKAY THIS SONG IS GREAT BUT LISTEN TO MY CRACK THEORY: 1) Selena and The Weeknd dated. 2) In this song, Selena says "Calling your name", potentially referencing "Call Out My Name", a song The Weeknd wrote about their relationship, implying this song is about The Weekend. 3) The Weeknd has a song called "Take My Breath" a song about a girl obsessed with sexual asphyxiation. 4) Souvenir's chorus is "Take my breath away just like a souvenir". In conclusion, Selena Gomez is into breath play.

**followingfreeways** (9): absolutely had no business being a deluxe track.

---

#take my breath away (gagged them)

**NotWith10000Men** (11): the in your eyes in your eyes egyptian blue part is chef's kiss

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): yass, this is a bop!

**Bordersz** (10): Pop perfection.

**cremeebrulee** (10): of course the best song on rare is about the weeknd

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this song deserves to be in Day 3 I swear to God‚Ä¶. If my locked-in 11 wasn‚Äôt there this could be it tbh‚Ä¶

**ignitethephoenix** (10): sick of the girlies putting good songs on the deluxe!!

**jasparghhh** (10): I imagine that this track was on the original Bad Liar/Fetish album

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (10): the fact that this was only on the deluxe version is a crime

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): she whispered the shit out of this one!

**runaway3212** (10): wow I love women in travel

**soul-glitch** (10): Never heard this one before but it's so sexy I love it

**throwaway-7650** (10): oh this is the the 11 among the 10s that are the 3 deluxe tracks

**1998tweety** (9): this deserved to smash

**jasannn** (8.3): she really walked into that with ‚Äúputting me to sleep‚Äù lyric for a good portion of the album

**impla77** (8.2): This is cute

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I never liked the production, the instrumental and lyrics are really great though

**fadedblue09** (8): Feels like an evolution of her Revival sound

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Storytelling and atmosphere are top notch but Selena sounds particularly wimpy here and it takes it down a peg‚Ä¶ like I think if Ariana had sung this then it would have won the rate.

**goodbyesindisguise** (8): the deluxe tracks really elevated the album in the end imo

**ReallyCreative** (8): waitttt she's finally found something here, hopefully this isn't the only... souvenir from this album

**vayyiqra** (8): All the echoing vocal effects on this album give it the ~~ethereal sound is bait for me and it's working dammit!

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): honestly the production here is really nice, but I think it lacked a bridge to change it up a bit more. in general the chorus is pretty good too

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): it's a subdued bop

**akanewasright** (7): she‚Äôs cute

**IIIHenryIII** (7): that‚Äôs a little souvenir, thanks

**seanderlust** (7): >song is rumored to be about abel >hook is "take my breath away" wait....WAIT.....

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): So-venir?

**anothertown** (6.5): i saw jim parsons in the west village once

**Awkward\_King** (6): bitch i think y,ou have a fever

**CrimsonROSET** (6): selena poliglot on opposite day

**frogaranaman** (6): I love it when people who live in LA write about New York in their songs because it‚Äôs always the most mundane shit lmao. ‚ÄúNew York back in August‚Äù what‚Äôs so interesting about it? the rain?

#take my breath away (choked them)

**bespectacIed** (5): I've always seen selena stans hype this as THAT song in the album but it's not giving what's supposed to give...

**Frelock\_** (5): I'm going to need a souvenir to remember this, because the song is forgettable on its own.

**sydschoon** (4.4): this song doesn‚Äôt do much for me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): You could have kept this one, Selena.

**pig-serpent** (4): The normal version of this album was long enough, we didn't need bonus songs that sound exactly like the rest of the album.

**TiltControls** (3.5): This is where my enjoyment for the album began crashing down

Now y'all can really get fucked for this one. I really love this song, maybe I'm just a simple man that reacts positively to a vocoder and words spoken quickly, but I think I would say with confidence this is my favorite deep-cut from Rare. The production for this is luscious and full, it makes me feel like I'm floating.

With this out, officially has lost all of Rare, as per the Spotify tracklist, with only Fetish and Bad Liar representing her, which is unfair and undeserved in my opinion, but sometimes the cookie just crumbles like this.

---

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The fast paced talk verses are soooo good. This was the only track produced by The Monsters & Strangerz. Aka the dudes that produced Dua's Break My Heart. When I found that out, it kinda made sense.

**daythreeinmiami** (11): One of my favourite songs of all time. The production, her delivery, just beautiful. Chef kiss. I‚Äôll be vulnerable for you Selena.

**vayyiqra** (11): Remember that internet discourse about "radical vulnerability" that your fake-woke friends posted infographics about but never put it into practice because they didn't really care about it? I believe Selena Gomez doesn't pretend to care about mental health for clout, and that's why I like her as a person. Also: this is a jam.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): I swear to God, if she ever makes an album that sounds like this, I'll buy it!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): A good portion of this album is ‚Äúchill‚Äù to the point of being boring but this is one where the vibe REALLY works.

**bogo** (10): ok girl you got me now this is pretty

**Bordersz** (10): The vibes on this are immaculate. Production top tier.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is the best deep cut and one of her best songs, if there is any justice in this world this would be day 3

**runaway3212** (10): no because why did she end

**throwaway-7650** (10): oh this is selena's fave? taste! unlike a certain other in the rate

**fadedblue09** (9.5): this is so lush and enchanting

**jasannn** (9): lo-fi atmospheric edm queen

**welcome2thejam** (9): Easily the best sounding Selena song so far

**cremeebrulee** (8.7): couldn't be me

**anothertown** (8.5): tbh I really like her style of staccato whispering on the track here

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): what is this ‚ÄúStomp! on Broadway‚Äù-ass drum bridge lmao

**flava** (8.5): lowkey and great

**akanewasright** (8): yeah this is nice, she kinda nailed it here

**bespectacIed** (8): She's kinda the queen of nightcore R&B

**Frelock\_** (8): Vulnerable ain't easy, believe me, but I go there

**sydschoon** (8): I love the message

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**CrimsonROSET** (7): fromthebreakingofthedaytothemiddleofnight

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the atmospheric stuff in the background after she says vulnerable is nice

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): that pre chorus is soooo good

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Selena needs to stop being afraid of projecting her voice, she honestly sounds way better than when she whisper-sings

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): the best thing abt this song is when she says vulnerable on the next song

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): my character in Slay the Spire because I never pick any cards that give me the Artifact buff

**Stryxen** (6.5): if you stay vulnerable you ain't gotta get vulnerable okayyyy

#fragile

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): such a great build for such an underwhelming release is criminal

**impla77** (6.2): Half the metaphors are contrived but again, its sweet

**goodbyesindisguise** (6): the pre chorus is very pretty

**bluetriangles04** (5.5): I really like the pre-chorus here but that chorus drop makes the song just dead in the water for me, also that instrumental bridge is more meh than anything. It ends strongly though, I'll give it that!

**AHSWeeknd** (5): this album had some gems, this isn‚Äôt one of them

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Ngl this is a little boring.

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): I can‚Äôt drown my demons, they know how to swim

**pig-serpent** (3.5): The production is nice but I've heard enough songs like this that I don't really need this.

**Hulnia** (2): why do the vocals sound so‚Ä¶ off. also the way vulnerable is stretched out is kinda annoying

Not even gonna lie, this song was fully off my radar for this rate. I had expected Daddy Issues, Hitchhiker, You Don't Do It For Me Anymore and/or Tell Me You Love Me to be alongside Sorry Not Sorry in Day 3, and not once considered this would be in, but I'm very glad to have been proven wrong.

As more and more of the album grew off me as I listened to it, this remained one of the most interesting songs and memorable songs. I love an unapologetically horny song with some retro production, this really could be a Future Nostalgia cut.

With this out, Demi remains with a single song, their biggest single Sorry Not Sorry.

---

**nooodisaster** (5): It's not good. Like it's bad out here. The most generic song on this album, with mind numbing lyrics, age-like-milk production, and Demi yodeling. Now I do enjoy Demi yodeling so it gets points for that.

---

#crazy sexy cool

**akanewasright** (10): when I heard this on the album for the first time I was STUNNED I didn‚Äôt know there would be straight up bops like this on the album

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is so pixie lott late 2000s coded

**bluehxrizon** (10): ate down

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this sounds like a shopping montage scene music that would play in a sitcom produced by Mindy Kaling. But i‚Äôm still slayed idc

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This more traditional dance pop song is a bit out of place on this album but that does nothing to take away from what a stone cold banger it is. It‚Äôs the kind of song that makes me feel like I‚Äôm gonna slammed into a wall, that kind of sexy.

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): this is her Greedy

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): this is pop perfection it should‚Äôve been a single. and now I‚Äôm craving a Demi X Justin Timberlake collab

**ReallyCreative** (10): wait this is INCREDIBLE

**Stryxen** (10): this is so eurovision coded in the best way possible

**throwaway-7650** (10): um this is such an easy 10 why is it getting any hate? idgi

**welcome2thejam** (10): Damn, sexy AND dirty? Tell me more

**fadedblue09** (9.5): banger and probably would've made a better lead single than Sorry Not Sorry

**sage** (9.3): this had no reason being so good

**1998tweety** (9): sexy dirty bop

**anothertown** (9): this is dated to some specific microera that i can't figure out i still love it though

**Frelock\_** (9): I don't have a sex playlist, but if I did...this probably wouldn't be on it because it's just slightly too slow, but still!

**hikk** (9): doing retro before it was cool

**ImADudeDuh** (9): besides the bad production, this ate

**impla77** (8.5): i can excuse the old love is a drug metaphor for a certified bop

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): very fun, kind of dumb. the addiction metaphors strike a bit of a weird note considering what happened not long after the album came out.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): not the most cohesive song on this album but god it bops so hard so i don‚Äôt even care

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is a little bit of a mess but I like it.

**bluetriangles04** (8): loving the production here! also the delivery on the lines is really good. and that vocoder/robot voice in the background is great. the last chorus with the adlibs kills it.

**bogo** (8): oh we were so robbed of this being a single, ROBBED i tell you

**jasannn** (8): kpop b-side slay

**jasparghhh** (8): this song crawled so that half the songs on Holy Fvck could sprint

**runaway3212** (8): honestly this isnt sexy at all but im bopping

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): idk why but i really loved this as a promo single

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): this kinda slaps

**bespectacIed** (7): Groovy

**Darkknuckles** (7): fun to strut to.

**sydschoon** (7): fun track

**CrimsonROSET** (6): oh i can tell the comments on this song particularly are going to be fine and totally not to be deeply looked at

#sad beautiful tragic

**jsonphile** (6): this could be an absolute bop if the production didn‚Äôt sound like ass

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I have like no feelings on this

**daythreeinmiami** (5): It‚Äôs aight. She funky. She never made it to my liked songs tho.

**TiltControls** (5): I think the track's trying to do a bit too much at once. And the phrase 'sexy dirty love' sounds like one of the least passionate ways to describe a relationship I've heard

**pig-serpent** (4): This one is competently written at least, but it has the same horrid production and mixing that the rest of the album has so there's only so good it can be.

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): this is not so main pop girls material

#[word] [word] [word]

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): this has nothing to do with the song but I can‚Äôt remember if this was an interlude to SexyBack or Heavydirtysoul and it‚Äôs annoying me

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): dirty sexy money outsold

**nt96** (6): you will never be CrazySexyCool

**flava** (3): this wants to be this so badly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLerp9KHAe8

#what disney channel where yall watching damn

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): The way the lyrics are pretty adult but sound-wise this feels exactly like something I would hear on Disney Channel. Still pretty good though!


**goodbyesindisguise** (5): I love songs about sex but the chorus tune is giving high school musical :/

I knew I was forgetting about someone! Ariana really decided to dominate this rate, with 7 songs in the top 10, but sadly this one missed the cut. Better Off is a gorgeous and emotional opening to Ariana's personal life and love struggles. The chorus repeats "I'm better off without 'em", in a tone that feels less sure and more like she's trying to convince herself, especially when it's accompanied by verses recalling moments spent with the lover this song focus about.

It also opens up with a line about armpits which is all everyone could talk about

---

**followingfreeways** (11): this is just a great song. i cant explain why i love it so much but i just do

**nooodisaster** (9): Kicked off every ballad Ari's done from this on being incredible, brutally honest, heartwrenching, and limited to like 1 an album.

---

#[better together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRdbmSEqKXI)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): My 11 from the very beginning. Just pure ascending Pooh gif for me.

**soul-glitch** (11): I can't even describe how much I love this song, best track in her entire discography, still sounds as fresh as the first time I played it. Let's put them topics to bed and go fuck on the ROOF

**1998tweety** (10): ascending a bit

**akanewasright** (10): I found proof this isn‚Äôt about Pete and Mac! [The song was written back in 2016](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlcElQ3Hc6g/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=), which makes me feel WAY better about this being one of my very favorites on the album

**bespectacIed** (10): We don't usually go to ariana for hard-hitting songwriting, but this is poetry, idgaf. Some of the most iconic lines of the album

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/984536582864404480.webp?size=240&quality=lossless

**goodbyesindisguise** (10): something about this tune itches my brain in the best way

**hikk** (10): a song that was already sad but with context of what happened not too long after..

**jasannn** (10): I‚Äôm surprised Ariana doesn‚Äôt have any songwriting credits on this. The lyrics and delivery really seem to come from her heart.

**jasparghhh** (10): this song hits harder than when it first released obviously but it only really adds to the song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is easily the most underrated song on the album, this is just such a gorgeously simple, precious floating song that ari excels at bringing to life. Those strings at the end are literally the best moment of music in history.

**runaway3212** (10): me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is such a hauntingly beautiful and sad song

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I'm sure she doesn't love making this vulnerable type of music all the time, but she's so good at it

**throwaway-7650** (10): Satan I mean BlockBerry Creative Entertainment didn't like that.

**flava** (9): when i think about him even once

**Frelock\_** (9): I'm better off with these vocals!

**MassiveThief** (9): one yass with a side of slay please!

**bogo** (8.5): more like better on! \*offensively loud laugh track plays\*

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I kinda gloss over this one because it‚Äôs later in the track list but it‚Äôs really pretty, especially towards the end when the violins come in. Wish there was more of that actually, Ariana sounds great with a string section.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): this is so tragic that I almost I skip this at times

**CrimsonROSET** (8): honestly the fact she just kinda silently got married after this speaks a lot, you ARE better off without him

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): beautiful. it‚Äôs missing something but still rather great

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): kind of low key. the strings at the end are beautiful.

**TiltControls** (7.5): I like the production a lot, but I wish Ariana did a bit more with it

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): it feels unfinished but vocals are great

**vayyiqra** (7): I forgot this song existed but sure it's alright! Some pretty arpeggios. yuh

**emayzee** (6.7): these strings are pretty but im bored otherwise

**NotWith10000Men** (6): it's fine

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): how society would be without this album

**sydschoon** (5.8): weird they had this track follow borderline, I think it throws off the album flow

**anothertown** (5): tragically ariana was still 6 months off from coming out with any good downtempo songs

**Awkward\_King** (4): i always think this is 20 something by sza when it starts

**IIIHenryIII** (3): this track almost made me get to the REM stage R

#armpit fetish


**cremeebrulee** (11): you keep me in your armpit..... pensiveblob pensiveblob

**seanderlust** (11): ~~you keep me in your armpit~~ okay actually i'm gonna be sincere since this is my 11. there were a few 11 contenders (big shoutout to goodnight n go which was my runner up) but this was the one that stuck with me the most during the duration of the rate. like every time i was listening to the playlist while doing chores or something i would just have to sit down and listen because man. big feelings.

**impla77** (9): I‚Äôm gonna keep pretending that the lyric is ‚Äòyou keep me in your armpit‚Äô as a cute piece of slice of life

Well,,, this is unfortunate. I added this song mostly because I though it would be funny to have a single song bonus rate, but also because I was actually curious to see how Malibu would perform, as I suspected had Younger Now been rated alongside with these albums it would have been its highest song.

For a good while, this was getting nothing but very high scores, consistently placing in the top 3 based off its average, but as more ballots came it would start dropping more and more, until the point where it was fully out of the top 10. Obviously not everyone rated it, some people even justified it by talking about how they didn't feel comfortable participating in rating a song from an era where Miley seemed to try her hardest to distance herself from the black culture she had been profiting off years prior, and I can't say that I think it would have done much  better had people been actually forced to rate it, and god knows how low Younger Now as a whole would be.

I still believe Malibu is a gorgeous song, probably one of her best. I was a huge fan of the Bangerz era, but I'm always a sucker for over the top popstars to strip back and open up a little, which is why I'm probably one of the only defenders of Younger Now >!despite the fact that it's been years since I last heard it in full!< and I still believe this is the best in the album. I can side eye and judge a lot of this era given the context, but this always pulls at my heartstrings, because I too would love to admire the blue sky in Malibu with someone I love... maybe one day

---

**followingfreeways** (10): i hated this song at first but now over the years i have become very fond of how this song really feels like love

**nooodisaster** (10): And when this gets a higher average score than any song in the actual rate and therefore technically wins the rate then what?

#the sky's more blue in malibu<3

**1998tweety** (10): ate

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is night changes for people whose tumblr was snapchat

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): I‚Äôm sorry but I actually like this song

**dreamingpastel** (10): Well.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Wow this really takes me back‚Ä¶ I have a really soft spot for this song actually, I was in college when it dropped and I vividly remember stopping what I was doing, going in to a little corner of the library and watching the music video with my headphones on. Something about seeing Miley running around so happy and free just healed my soul that day. I literally took a bunch of screenshots of the video and texted them to my friend lol I don‚Äôt know why I did that but I was just caught up in the emotions.

**impla77** (10): i‚Äôm feeling nice today

**musical\_pyn** (10): i know we'll never rate younger now but this is the album that got me back into miley cyrus so i gotta stan

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this is one of those songs where i remember where i was when i first heard it. i was walking down the blacktop in front of my childhood home and it's a really nice memory <3

**nt96** (10): this is so good and it‚Äôs literally one of the only Miley songs I‚Äôve ever played more than once

**pastapixal** (10): one of Miley's best songs!! I will never forgive her for not staying in this sound more instead of moving into whatever the Elvis costume Younger Now era was.

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): deserved the success flowers is getting

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i love this 100% authentic miley cyrus!!!

**runaway3212** (10): This being hated for no reason

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i love this and it's pretty much the only thing from this era that i do love

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): only because it would be funny if this placed higher than everything

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): bonus rate winner yass

**throwaway-7650** (10): yup that's mother~~('s daughter, another 10 btw)~~

**welcome2thejam** (10): Honestly wishing you made this just a single song artist entry in the main rate cause I've been stuck picking an 11 for an hour instead of just giving it to this

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): the one song she ate in her anti bangerz / Liam simping era

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): in the context of the album, that‚Äôs an easy ten

**sage** (9.1): the prechorus is sooooo good for no reason

**Awkward\_King** (9): this deserved everything flowers got and more

**bluehxrizon** (9): the way younger now isn't worth rating

**Frelock\_** (9): Fun beach song. Plus there's a dog in the music video, so really 13/10

**soul-glitch** (9): Love it but that "boatin" line‚Ä¶

**jasannn** (8.5): this would have made a great hannah montana track

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): this is the only song from her Younger Now album that people from 20 years are going to remember because it's the only one that matters!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Very pretty and pleasant with just a small splash of boring!

**Frajer** (8): in her Colbie Caillat era on this one

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Proper enunciation & a vocal tone that doesn't annoy me makes Miley my favorite singer in this rate

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.3): wish we had just rated the whole album, it's like 40 minutes (not that it would've done well at all)

**AHSWeeknd** (7): good for Miley.

**Darkknuckles** (7): Kim petras' malibu is better imo. Miley has better songs.

**Stryxen** (7): a slight serve

**TiltControls** (7): slide away outsold

# i got a beach house in malibu and im probably gonna hurt your feelings

**TragicKingdom1** (7): this shrunk in hindsight, younger now should've been the hit

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): i'm not really into country. its fine i guess.

**anothertown** (6): it's a no from me. Stream Slide Away

**ReallyCreative** (6): Fully believe that if she performed this song today she would absolutely murder it but these vocals are so sleepy and there's such a lost potential

**Treecoh** (6): miley cant write for shit lol im sorry. and the song sounds like a prototype to Slide Away. still kinda catchy tho

**akanewasright** (5): I have never had any thoughts on this song

**bogo** (4): kinda bad but still better than the sack of shit that is flowers

**flava** (4): I was gonna give this a 10 just to be camp but then she released flowers and giving Miley a camp 10 didn‚Äôt seem as fun anymore

**LesApfels** (4): Younger Now will always be the superior single

**cremeebrulee** (3): ok?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): so low energy

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this is boring as fuck, and I just listened to Sweetener, Tell Me You Love Me, and Rare (Deluxe) back to back.

**vayyiqra** (2): Again we are in a surreal alternate universe, where Popheads tries to convince me that Selena Gomez makes worse music than Miley Cyrus.

**bespectacIed** (1): The road to her well-earned renaissance with Plastic Hearts + Flowers was rough, my gawd. I had no zero in the main rate, but this borefest is it

**frogaranaman** (1): absolutely not lmao

**pig-serpent** (1): There's a certain sound songs can have where the production feels too squeaky clean and soulless, and as a result listening to the song makes me feel like my life-force is violently being sucked out of my body.  As you can probably tell, Malibu is one of those songs.

This song being so high actually shocked me a little, because I never saw too many people praising it, especially compared with how much love and praise other songs get, but it's so deserved. The production is grand and so Ariana, this feels like a grown version of a Yours Truly song >!an album that we have to rate one day, support Yours Truly vs Stars Dance vs DEMI vs Bangerz!<. I really like the approach she took to cope and talk about her hardships, about being positive and trying to think that things will get better, it's a lot more comforting for me than say Breathin. It's probably the cherry on top of the beautiful treat that is sweetener.

---

**nooodisaster** (11): If Sweetener was an experiment, this to me is the crowning success. Sounds like nothing on the charts before or since, yet beautiful and arresting. Layers of heavenly vocals glide and fall over piano and snapping fingers. Hooks come and go, each perfectly crafted yet just a little off from normal pop hits. Ari's words of fighting anxiety are warm and hopeful, like a day in with a close friend you haven't seen in far too long. And then, the song blips to silence, 40 seconds of it, to remember those we've lost.

---

#just know that there's up...

**bespectacIed** (11): Yeah, biggest get well soon stan coming thru. My love for sweetener started and eventually rested on the shoulder of this song. Without get well soon, sweetener is a collection of fun, sweet, well-produced pop-R&B tracks from a superstar at her prime... But with get well soon, sweetener is a character study of a clueless, young woman - self-therapizing, dissociating, and distracting herself from trauma with trivial stuff and easy pleasures ‚Äì SWEETENERS, basically... The way she fucking captured that "shell-shocked but still doing every ridiculous thing I can to cope and heal" feeling after unspeakable tragedy is so powerful, it really hit me hard. Since this album run, Ariana has only gotten bigger and her personal life has been micro-analyzed more than ever, but this song will always be her most authentic, most grounding... and imo, most special. Love this song and Ari to bits!!!!

**sydschoon** (11): this song got me through a lot of shit, will always have a special place in my heart

**AHSWeeknd** (10): insanely sweet.

**akanewasright** (10): truly amazed at how she made ‚Äúunfollow fear and just say you are blocked‚Äù sound good‚Ä¶

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): a great ending song that I always never skip.

**anothertown** (10): such painfully 25 year old rich person lyrics

**Awkward\_King** (10): very possibly her magnum opus like such a beautiful and healing song and the empty space at the end to reach 5/22

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The runner up for my 11. Mr. Williams REALLY snapped with this closer.

**bogo** (10): again this hits hard, ariana's been through too much

**cremeebrulee** (10): the comfiest song about disassociation there ever was

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i hope she‚Äôs doing well

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the moment of silence is so touching. a great and touching song. Love her harmonies

**jasparghhh** (10): this is objectively Ariana's best and most important song and does a great job summing up the thesis of Sweetener while also being a full feel-good bop

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): her very best song. The 500 vocal layers stacked on top of each other with these beautiful lyrics? She makes important music

**nt96** (10): I love the piano progression here.

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): the 40 seconds of silence are the most commendable and beautiful seconds of silence in music

**runaway3212** (10): mental health awareness was never the same

**sage** (10): the chorus on this is literally the best thing ever

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i love how therapeutic this is and it's so underrated. the harmonies are just next level

**throwaway-7650** (10): me sending reddit care messages to ppl who 0 this album

**TiltControls** (9.5): a fantastic closer to the album. it's just a really sweet track to end on

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): i understand the impact of the silence, but ultimately all that happens after the first listen is that I skip the last minute.

**bluetriangles04** (9): the ultimate closer and just an amazing call back to/reflection of everything that had happened at the time.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Ariana PLEASE drop a gospel EP or something.

**soul-glitch** (9): I don't need therapy I have get well soon by Ariana Grande

**Stryxen** (9): ‚ù§Ô∏è i CAN feel it feel it

**jasannn** (8.5): a perfect closer

**impla77** (8.1): Lyrics feel underbaked, but the vocal layering is enough to draw interest away from that

**dreamingpastel** (8): *ding*

**Frajer** (8): Santa Tell Me teas

**Frelock\_** (8): Good closer all-around

**NotWith10000Men** (7.9): i wish this album had some more oomph but it's really good overall and this is a pretty good closer

**hikk** (7.5): me when someone is sick.

**1998tweety** (7): shes a cute closer

**vayyiqra** (7): It's cute, maybe a bit longer than it needs to be but it's a solid closer. I don't really like the song itself that much but I like the wholesomeness of it. "A mental hug" I love that concept! That rules. yuh

**welcome2thejam** (7): Solid album closer, think the "here's one thing you can trust" part is great

**daythreeinmiami** (6): It was cute. A nice little red bow around the album. What I WANT to know is why there is 37 seconds of silence at the end of the song? [host note: well...]

#...and downs and there's drops

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Something about that *ding* bothers me so much

**Bordersz** (5): Did not like the sound.

**oscarbrierley1** (5): it sounds like four songs that don't go together mashed up. i get the sentimental reason for the silence at the end, but its so annoying in practice. could she not have made the silence a separate track on streaming.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): instrumentally, this is gorgeous, I‚Äôll give it that

**TragicKingdom1** (4): pharrell put a single piano riff and some snaps into logic pro and then clocked out for the day

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): feeling petty at this song for some reason. And no it wasn‚Äôt the quiet bit near the end

fuck yall.

I regret not 11ing this because it would have been real funny for all of the hosts' 11s going back to back to back.

**followingfreeways** (10): they are both 10s but i actually prefer this to bad liar which i think is the unpopular opinion. this song is just so damn sultry. has good for you vibes in the best way

**nooodisaster** (8): Still so disappointed in this lyrically. The fetish is for... her LOVE? Not like, rope, or pain, or feet or smthn? UGH. Straight people suck.

# [has tried the grapefruit technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPhAUittpzA)

**1998tweety** (10): i want a whole album full of this, the vibe is IMMACULATE and I know we're just rating the song but the MV was so good.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): never knew a song could have such a massive impact on me but here we are

**akanewasright** (10): I just did a typo and accidentally googled ‚Äúsemena gomez‚Äù and I feel like this is the one appropriate place to talk about that

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is great song, but don't eat glass shards for your gut health's sake!

**Bordersz** (10): I love this sound. I wish she released a full album with this sound. Fire.

**cremeebrulee** (10): the best song ever i couldn't believe it

**DaHumanTorch** (10): one of her best songs this deserved SO much better

**Darkknuckles** (10): almost got my 11 because bayyyybe this song makes me feel sexy as fuck stripping and strutting all sultry like. Selena did that shit.

**frogaranaman** (10): everybody sound off on your fetishes in the comments here

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): She should have made this album.

**hikk** (10): the mv is so good like .. it was her arthouse era

**ignitethephoenix** (10): can‚Äôt believe she made me like a song called this

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): üòÆü´¢she‚Äôs touching her pussy!

**runaway3212** (10): I have a fetish for this song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): The bonus tracks are doing a lot to raise my average here

**Treecoh** (10): this >>>>>> bad liar

**vayyiqra** (10): Yeah okay Popheads fine. I'll go with the basic take. Sure this song's good, but I am not going to agree it's better than everything else on *Revival*, because that album rules.

**bluetriangles04** (9.5): The feature is okay! Maybe I would have enjoyed it a little more without Gucci Mane's verse but it's not like it overstayed it's welcome and aside from that, the production on this is really great and just the build of that chorus is so loveable.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): that ending of the music video hinted at something greater and what did we get?

**NotWith10000Men** (9.2): the whistle in the background is a good touch

**bluehxrizon** (9): soap eating queen

**horridhendy** (9): - Love it. Sounds like it could be an Ariana song tbh. Would score even higher if it wasn't for the feature.

**seanderlust** (9): (jasmine masters voice) just because of that gucci mane feature bitch you're safe as fuck

**Frajer** (8.5): almost as egregious as Ja Rule saying he has a fetish for fucking Ashanti with her skirt on but not quite

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): the production really works well with her voice, it makes her voice one with the music rather than sitting on top of it. the gucci mane verse is a bit weird, like "spreaded" really?

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): what did awkwafina do to deserve a shoutout in this song... awks

**Frelock\_** (8): Might not have a fetish for this song, but it's pretty good

**jasparghhh** (8): the rap verse really ruins the whole vibe of the song lol

**pig-serpent** (8): I feel like I enjoy this Selena Gomez does Halsey more than I should, but idk it's solid until Gucci Mane comes on and kills the momentum.

**ReallyCreative** (8): this missed the album for what? normally I'm not a big fan of the hugely hyped up loose releases that were "robbed" of an album spot but y'all were right about this one

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): this hasn't aged that well for me but it's enjoyable

**CrimsonROSET** (7): slowed-down-for-movie-trailer core

**welcome2thejam** (7): Selena Gomez releasing a song called Fetish doesn't seem real, like on reveal weekend this will never get eliminated, and when I ask about it the hosts will just send me that video of the Fact or Fiction guy telling me it never happened for forty five seconds

**bespectacIed** (6): It sounds so luxurious. Better without the Gucci feature. Trend alert in this rate is features that don't elevate the song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is noise for sure. It‚Äôs pretty decent noise.

#vanilla missionary sex 

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): selena has a fetish for making boring music

**PretentiousPegasus** (6): this could be higher but I really hate the vocals ‚Äútake it or leave it‚Äù

**TiltControls** (6): both of them sound fine here, but neither is great and they don't really fit together all that well

**Awkward\_King** (4): what is she singing abt lemons

**bogo** (4): i also don't get the love for this song, it's boring and also selena calling her bf's attraction to her a "fetish" is just super fucking weird

**goodbyesindisguise** (4): idk it‚Äôs just not for me I wish it went further or harder or something

**flava** (3.5): the same comment for bad liar but somehow worse and better at the same time

**dreamingpastel** (3): Gucci Mane's muffled ad libs at the end make this song unintentionally funny. Like, Selena sounds so serious in the last chorus, while Gucci Mane is barely audible, going "Yeah! Yeah! YEAH! Wow."

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): She sounds so‚Ä¶ *pained* when she sings. Like it's the most uncomfortable thing to do for her.

**pastapixal** (1): Hot take maybe but the melody in the verses just don't work for me at all, i personally find it to be very grating. The rest of the song doesn't give any redeeming factors either.

**Awkward\_King** (11): the most gorgeous song to ever

**nt96** (11): my fave band

**sage** (11): her best song like

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is the most Ariana Grande song ever

**akanewasright** (10): like half of sweetener has been on my anxiety playlist at some point, and this is probably one of the most effective songs there. Like breathin may be about taking breaths to ground yourself, but this is the song that makes me actually slow down and do it.

**babadork** (10): The Mr. Sandman bit is deserving of an 11.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The way this song literally sounds like falling asleep but in the most slay way possible.

**Bordersz** (10): It sounds like a dream. Gorgeous harmonies.

**cremeebrulee** (10): pg sexxx dreams

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the

**impla77** (10): we love the layers

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i think this song really kinda sums up what I love about this album. Iit's such a soothing, dreamy song, and just feels hopeful, warm, safe and calming, like a gentle healing light.

**soul-glitch** (10): EXCUSE ME UM-

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wanna wake up‚Äù me every 7am when I‚Äôve taken melatonin

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (9.5): it's just so dreamy and soft and sweet I love it!

**bluehxrizon** (9): this song is amazing why'd she have to associate it with bad makeup

**CrimsonROSET** (9): yes this does end ariana in about thirty-seven seconds in fact

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Somnophilia anthem

**bluetriangles04** (8.5): a classic!

**anothertown** (8): who starts a conversation like that ü§≠ nobody ü§ó but i do ü§™ü§™

**Darkknuckles** (8): cant help but bounce

**dreamingpastel** (8): Christmas song vibes.

**indie\_fan\_** (8): feels like it drags on for a bit, but still a rather solid track

**jasparghhh** (8): good song but why is her makeup line named after it

**Stryxen** (8): really eats much

**sydschoon** (8): this song is a dream, album should have started here

**vayyiqra** (8): Yes the panting is bad! Cute song though. Good alternative rock band and important stage of deep sleep. yuh

**throwaway-7650** (7.9): um someone's repeatedly gasping into my ears and just won't stop

**jasannn** (7.5): me when I wake up after 4 hours of sleep to go pee

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): this song hasn't so much grown on me as much as it has been reframed with Ariana's subsequent releases. Like it's really surpising we got tu, n following Sweetener when this song absolutely predicted positions.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): this is the song thats grown on me the most over the years. my only complaint is it drags for like 30 seconds at the end.

**bigbigbee** (7): you can make this song an interactive experience by listening to it on a treadmill. Your breaths will match pharrell‚Äôs exactly

**daythreeinmiami** (7): The harmonies. THE HARMONIES.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): that outro is an 11 though

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This album is trying so hard for "chill vibes"‚Ä¶ I think they get it right here though

**welcome2thejam** (7): Please give me main pop girl Michael Stipe

#[i sleep](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/022/310/isleep.JPG)

**goodbyesindisguise** (6.5): I loved it when it came out but it‚Äôs not doing enough for me now - it kind of goes nowhere

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): between this and NASA there must be something about Ariana songs based on acronyms that makes me way less enthused by them than everybody else

**dream\_fighter2018** (6): this is cute, but that‚Äôs about it

**Frelock\_** (6): It's not bad, but it just doesn't seem to go anywhere.

**jsonphile** (6): where is Michael Stipe????

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): it sounds like it's meant to put you to sleep too

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): the drums at the end of verses being straight out of Drop It Like Its Hot lol. the gasping is ew

**runaway3212** (0): naptime

#BEYONCE!!! \*gunshot*

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): yass, I love songs about wet dreams, but she could've done a remix with the Beyonc√© demo!

**bespectacIed** (10): She ate up Bey, I'm sorry. A song called rapid eye movement has to be dreamy and Ari understood the assignment

**seanderlust** (9.5): users campaigning for this rate for three years and us finally rating this immediately after rating the bey version in unreleased rate is camp. anyways the beyonce version outsold but this is still very good and i'm giving it a high score to stick up for it a bit

**1998tweety** (9): one of her bests but I fear Beyonc√© ate her up

**bogo** (8): honestly, better than the beyonce demo. either that or i'm just used to this version

**pig-serpent** (8): I had high hopes for this version after hearing the Beyonce demo, and this didn't live up to my expectations.  The thing that upsets me most is moving the "I love you, who starts a conversation like this nobody but I do," so that it no longer starts the song.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Ariana‚Äôs version is a cute puppy gently licking my face to wake me up and beyonce‚Äôs version is banging pots and pans outside of my door

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): this is fine but because of the unreleased rate I know there's a better version with Beyonce out there

**oscarbrierley1** (6): I can see why Beyonce didn't put it out. Its fine, but kind of unremarkable. When she said does this end i related because i was also ready for it to end.

**TiltControls** (5): Bey did it better tbh

**fadedblue09** (3): even at the peak of my Sweetener stanning, I never liked this. Beyonce totally devoured her idc

**TragicKingdom1** (0): this song is boring and im glad we have proof that even beyonce can't save it

#i go back to you

**emayzee** (11): i only listened to this album once when it came out so i had zero memory of this song when doing the rate. over the last few weeks i've gone from scoring it in the 8s, to the 9s, and now it's my 11

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (11): Just the fade-in intro alone has me floating in auditory bliss with Ariana‚Äôs repeated ‚Äúback to you‚Äù‚Äôs. A classic trap beat sells the verses and the chorus + hook combination is super catchy. A perfect change of gears in the tracklist too.

**goodbyesindisguise** (11): this is my absolute favourite song in her discography!!! the vocal layering is amazing

**musical\_pyn** (11): that's not god girl that's just dick

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A bop

**bespectacIed** (10): R&B perfection. My most listened song on sweetener, possibly my favorite. You could say that I go back to it, back to it... everytime.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Because God is a messy bitch who loves drama. That‚Äôs why.

**bluetriangles04** (10): my one gripe with this song is how short it is, and even then I enjoy it enough to give it a full 10. especially with how she just KILLS IT in the final chorus, the production, etc... also I'm such a fan of that cheesy shakespeare lyric idgaf!

**fadedblue09** (10): this had made me emotional a lot of times

**Frelock\_** (10): God keeps bringing me back to Ariana for songs like this

**hikk** (10): basic but it just gives idk

**ignitethephoenix** (10): best deep cut

**jasannn** (10): the final chorus with all those fantastic ad-libs really make the song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): "i've tried to fight i'm in a jeep"

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): honestly some of her best vocals the ad libs are insane

**throwaway-7650** (10): ...realizing that this is one of my faves on sweetener actually

**welcome2thejam** (10): Loving this video game water level trap beat

**pig-serpent** (9.5): The first verse of this song is honestly really boring, but once the song gets going it becomes pop perfection.

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): shakespair

**impla77** (8.6): I really like this song but I have to go off on a tangent about weird Shakespeare lines. I mean I only have two examples (this and Carly) but like.. it takes me out everytime

**jasparghhh** (8.5): I always think the name of this song is Back to You sorry Selena

**NotWith10000Men** (8.2): i legit forgot all about this one

**cremeebrulee** (8.1): carly's "is it my destiny? i wanna do a bad thing twice" is just ari's "why does god keep bringing me back to you" in a different font

**akanewasright** (8): every now and then there‚Äôs a song on this album where I‚Äôm like ‚Äúuh oh‚Ä¶ what if this is about Mac‚Ä¶‚Äù and then I get really uncomfortable before getting back into the song, despite the album being like 90% finished by the time Ari and Pete got together

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): this could've been a single, wtf happened?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): back to you? no ari that song‚Äôs not in the rate- ari no stop-

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Great vocal performance from Ariana here, you can really hear the conflict and resignation in her voice.

**Stryxen** (8): the most insane chorus . YOU GET HIGH AND CALL ON THE REGULAR

**vayyiqra** (8): This is very Selena Gomez-coded. See she even said "back to you" ahahah (I'm being goofy). Uh this song's good but I never remember it's here. yuh

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Love the production here‚Ä¶ though maybe I just like it cause the other songs on this album sound so much worse by comparison üò¨

**sydschoon** (7.7): the vocals carry this track

**1998tweety** (7.5): this deserved more

**flava** (7.5): the way this song started, i was about to call it blinding lights-core

**TiltControls** (7.5): It's catchy, but something about it still feels off - maybe with a bit more length to build it could've really knocked it out of the park

**ReallyCreative** (7): I liked this more than I remembered

#self destruct show up like an idiot

**anothertown** (6): its alright like

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): I‚Äôve heard this album multiple times over the years and never remember this song is on here lksdllljh

**nt96** (6): it‚Äôs ok but there‚Äôs a filler feeling somewhere in here

**Awkward\_King** (5): im kinda meh on aris actual good songs on this album and i wont apologise for that

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I can‚Äôt stop thinking about *Everyday* whenever this song comes up

**ImADudeDuh** (5): damn this is *filler* filler

**runaway3212** (3): her singing this song about a man she left after like 4 months of dating she's so real

[well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1nd7lse2fw)

That's it for Demi. They really had it very bad this rate; at some point they weren't even in like the top 20, which is very surprising because even though I ended up falling out of love with a lot of songs in the album, I thought its highlights were still very worthy of the top 10.

Regardless, they do have this amazing song, that as *Demi Lovato confidence anthem*-core as it is, it's still a huge banger and it makes sense that it's their biggest hit >!or second biggest, now that Cool For The Summer blew up on Tiktok a while ago!<. It's very representative of its era of pop music and I really hope we can see Demi recreate the success of this... one day.

---

**followingfreeways** (10): somehow feels extremely cringy but also fun and confident at the same time and i love it for that

**nooodisaster** (9): You have to remember, when this released in 2017 "sorry, not sorry" as a phrase had not reached peak overuse. This was ALMOST cool.

---

#unapologetic when we fuck up the night

**Treecoh** (11): it's so sad her career died after this song

**1998tweety** (10): MEGA bop. This being the lead single (and only relevant single) from the album is wild cause while it does bop a lot, it sticks out so much from the rest of the more R&B focused album.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): It‚Äôs not a Demi album without an unnecessary self-love bop

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is my bad bitch anthem after I kept arguing with my classmate over our favorite subject (mine's recess)

**anothertown** (10): iconic lore that their label wanted them to put out a ballad for the first single of this era but they fought to put out sorry not sorry.. that is a certified good instinct

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Oh God my second PItchfork reference in the ballot‚Ä¶but I remember Pitchfork at the time said this song would sound great with a Chance the Rapper remix. Nowadays Chance and Demi have their :grinny: moments but I stand by this being a valid statement and I wish that happened.

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Demi at one of her highest peaks. She FLOORED me when this dropped. Still a song that solidly slaps to this day. And you bet whenever I say sorry not sorry, I obnoxiously break out into this song. Would have been my 11, but unfortunately my ultimate queen is here. Sorry Demi (it‚Äôs Selena).

**fadedblue09** (10): Lowkey wanted to be petty for this outcharting This is Me on the Hot 100 but it's a well-deserved banger

**Frajer** (10): Demi making an anthem that feels personally designed for me to sing along to https://giphy.com/gifs/foxhomeent-reese-witherspoon-legally-blonde-xUA7b17osqXImEFJKM

**Frelock\_** (10): I'm not sorry I love this song

**hikk** (10): this was my songgggg in 2017

**IIIHenryIII** (10): feeling like a‚Ä¶

**ImADudeDuh** (10): is this absolutely shallow? Yes. Is this kinda annoying? A bit. Am I still giving this a 10? yeah

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This is just Demi‚Äôs take on ‚ÄúNo Problem‚Äù by Chance the Rapper and it SLAPS

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this song bangs, slaps, hits, all of the above

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): there‚Äôs so much hate in this world.. we have to RISE ABOVE!

**runaway3212** (10): Literally the last early 2010s party song think about it

**sage** (10): one of the best hits of last decade idgaf that chord progression is so good

**Stryxen** (10): try not to say PARENT challenge

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): feeling like a ten

**akanewasright** (9.5): thinking about how Demi was choosing between this song and ‚ÄúThe Middle‚Äù (the Maren Morris song) as their lead single‚Ä¶ they chose correctly

**sydschoon** (9.5): fucking BOP!!!!

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): she's growing but [see title] if the 0.5 ends up mattering

**bluetriangles04** (9): the first time I heard this song was in the back of my friend's trunk because we couldn't fit all of us in her car and she was going 80 in a 55 because I don't know why and there was a little flappy door connected to the trunk and the backseat so I could hear everyone screaming the lyrics to it... I get it though, it's a banger

**Bordersz** (9): A point off bc of the "you ain't nobody til you got somebody", talk about low self esteem.

**dreamingpastel** (9): Demi came out SWINGING.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): 2017 was the year I started to get into pop and this is one of the first big releases I really followed and it was so much fun watching it climb up the charts, but I‚Äôll always remember just how hard Demi hustled to make this song a hit. They were out there performing at every concert and awards show nonstop for months and if you watch performances from [around the end of this promo cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFaMZUarksA) you can see how visibly worn out she was. The acoustic version from the deluxe editions of the album is a slay too.

**jsonphile** (9): it‚Äôs so incredibly cheesy but it kinda slaps I can‚Äôt lie

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): it's an absolute bop and the only thing stopping it from being a 10 is i don't like the way she sings "not sorry" in the chorus lol

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): bABy i'M sOrRY

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i cant hate like it bops

**goodbyesindisguise** (8): it‚Äôs such a strong intro song with a lot of attitude

**jasannn** (8): if you are BRAVE it's because you can SLAY *bass booms*

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (8): an absolute banger

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Yass and slay

**bigbigbee** (7): bit of screamy Lovato happening here

**cremeebrulee** (7): ok?

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): this just feels unfinished. It‚Äôs got something promising but it‚Äôs just too barebones like this

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): this song is just so Demi Lovato. Not musically, but if someone asked me to describe Demi‚Äôs personality/image I would point them this way. The pre chorus is  kind of abrasive and tries too hard, very Demi coded of her.

**welcome2thejam** (7): It's an uphill battle to make me like a song with this title, so kudos to em for pulling it up from the brink as best they could

**bogo** (6): it's a pretty basic positivity anthem, and i find that usually the only person who can sell those songs for me is lizzo, but demi does a decent job here

**MassiveThief** (6): in retrospect, this is SUCH a Lizzo song. If I were given this song blind without a specific singer, I would 100% tell you Lizzo wrote it.

#sorry:(


**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): there's something about this song that annoys me, but i'm not sure what it is. maybe its too repetitive or the vocals are slightly too shouty, i'm not sure.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): wow this chorus feels *way* more dated than I remember it being

**ReallyCreative** (5): how is this the worst song on this album this is so twisted

**frogaranaman** (4): this Amazon Music ass song

**TiltControls** (3): An absolute powerhouse performance with almost no feeling behind it

**flava** (2.5): wikipedia doesnt list a genre for this song in it‚Äôs description, this is because sorry not sorry is post-genre

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (1): This is a crossbreed between annoyingly self-centered musical number and faceless pop complete with an annoying low pitched voice, as well as an uninteresting take on flipping off the haters. Basically she isn't Piece of Me and will never be.

**pig-serpent** (1): Demi's a great singer (all their pop punk collabs prove it) and it's sad that the best their team could come up with was having them screech over a terribly produced, cacophonous beat.  The production was clearly done by people who know what they're doing, but every sound design decision seems to clash with every other sound design decision, so there's no crispness, just noise.

**emayzee** (0): this is one of my least favorite songs of all time it is absolutely CRIMINAL that it's demi's highest peaking chart hit

ExActsRate: #anyone else watches drag race?

**bespectacIed** (10): Outdated slang and production aside, this song is pop perfection, idc. Buoyed by in my opinion the last great Drag Race LSFYL, this is as synonymous to queer joy as Cool For The Summer, they're sister songs in that regard. Props for demi spilling that her pubes are green... took "most personal album yet" to the next level

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Was gonna give this a 9 but you know what the RPDR lip sync gets it another point idc.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): yvie and brooke lesbian fanfiction

**horridhendy** (10): It's a certified bop. I played this ad nauseum when it came out and yet still enjoy it. It having an iconic lipsync probably helps...

**ignitethephoenix** (10): bop that also gave us one of the best lip syncs on Drag Race

**jasparghhh** (10): it was a 9 but yvie vs brooke made it a 10

**seanderlust** (9): yeah i'm not going to be able to separate the yvie oddly vs brook lynn heights lip sync from this. especially with tony hale also lipsyncing from behind the judging booth.

**musical\_pyn** (8): yvie oddly you will always be famous

**Darkknuckles** (8): Still a bop after all these years but mainly due to the drag race lipsync with this song that elevated it.

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): this has the same energy as when Taylor Swift does her "revenge songs", but at least we got a good lip sync from this


**impla77** (6.2): brb off to watch Yvie vs Brooke again

#goodnight‚ù§ü•∞ü•∫‚ú®

**frogaranaman** (11): god this is unfortunately so relatable

**jasannn** (11): OH WHY‚ÄôD YOU HAVE TO BE SO CUTEE!!!

**joeeswift** (11): I will never tire of this song, ultimate crushing bop

**bluetriangles04** (10): this song just makes me so happy idk how! it's so cute in general and some of the lines just put a huge smile on my face and also the build up to that drop in the chorus is so good! using that silence to emphasize it makes it even better. that bridge/outro is so fucking good too... I could go on but I'll shut up!

**cremeebrulee** (10): me and who like i'm actually tired at this point

**CrimsonROSET** (10): she just sounds so angelic, i haven‚Äôt talked much about the song themselves in these comments but like holy shit

**fadedblue09** (10): easily my favorite song here, it's just so enchanting. Though I'd feel bad if I gave my 11 to a cover

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): A song that puts a smile on my face, a lot of *sweetener* feels like reading a girl‚Äôs diary entries and this is just so cute. The second verse where Ariana is just tracing lines in space with her voice is one of the highest points on the entire album.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): an excellent cover, her voice works so well on it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): speak for yourself rate dear god please

**runaway3212** (10): tell my why I cried to this once

**seanderlust** (10): i was obsessed with the speak for yourself album when i was younger so this collaboration made me very, very happy when it came out.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this song is just so good, i love how she explores her vocals in a different way. one of her best

**throwaway-7650** (10): [[LEG voice]hawt pink](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tAQ4vp23rI) (this is fr the greatest mashup of all time btw I'm so serious)

**sage** (9.6): its bottom 1 sorry but still very very great

**Frelock\_** (9.5): Ariana's voice is angelic, and that drop hit hard!

**sydschoon** (9.5): one of my favorites from the album

**impla77** (9.2): more heavenly vocals

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): a cute cover!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This song is so twinkly and cute! *several different colors of heart emojis*

**1998tweety** (8): i was obsessed with this on release but it kinda shrunk

**hikk** (8): a tad overrated still nice tho i love the prechorus don't rly love the drop

**nt96** (8): stream Speak For Yourself!

**oscarbrierley1** (8): the trap beat kind of undercuts the rest of the song and holds it back from being in my top tier songs. her vocals are very pretty though.

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): kind of overrated? but somewhat deserved

#n go

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I love how the beat drop almost puts you to sleep, her mind ü§©

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Ari I wish I could but there's two songs left

**bluehxrizon** (5): a nice cover but the verse she added and the drop have aged badly

**Bordersz** (5): Hate the instrumental makes it feel outdated on the chorus w/that weird edm sound whining in the back.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): my favorite rest stop off of the I-305

**musical\_pyn** (4): the original is one of my favorite songs of all time, and while there are some parts of this I like in general I just...don't like most of the choices made and have no reason to listen to this over the original

**pig-serpent** (3.5): Parts of this song are almost interesting.

**Treecoh** (1): This sounds like something the no name white british pop girls like rita ora would release

#**AHSWeeknd** (10): don‚Äôt mind me, just being another Imogen Heap comment.


**jasparghhh** (11): it's hard to explain how much this song means to me, ever since I first heard it it's been one of my all-time favorite songs and my absolute favorite Ariana song. there's just something about the juxtaposition between the timidness and romance of Imogen Heap's original lyrics and the mild horniness in the added lyrics that is so uniquely Ariana and confirms to me that she is a fellow Cancer

**TiltControls** (11): the imogen version is 10x better, but that just means it's a 110 instead of an 11. also this is penance for giving it a 7.5 last time we rated it

**akanewasright** (10): I love the original Imogen Heap song, but sometimes I just want an uncomplicatedly sweet love song without any stalking

**bespectacIed** (10): Such a sweet song. Credits to imogen for the amazing songwriting but Ari really made the song her own

**dreamingpastel** (10): All my compliments to Imogen Heap

**kwcty6888** (10): she did mama imogen proud with this one

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): Ariana has suuuch good taste, stream Imogen Heap

**Awkward\_King** (9): the bridge is heavenly but ive not even heard the original imogen version and like i know it is better

**ReallyCreative** (9): the taste to cover an Imogen Heap song CANNOT be exaggerated

**Stryxen** (9): smash the original is the 11 tho

**flava** (8.5): even if I gave this an 11, I‚Äôd still say Imogen outsold, because Speak For Yourself is one of the best albums of all time, maybe we should rate it so i can give it the 10+ average it deserves

**Frajer** (8): we stan an Imogen Heap stan

**redgold51** (8): Come through Miss Imogen

**vayyiqra** (8): By this late in the album I tend to forget everything else in it, but sure this song's good. I want to like it more because I like Imogen Heap and she was a big influence on my music taste, but this is a good score. yuh

Well, it's over.

This put up a good fight, consistently staying in the top of the rate, even through the most vile sweetener sweeps. I really wish things were different and we got whatever album was being built from Bad liar & Fetish, because I feel like it really would change the perception of Selena as an artist. Never was she taken as seriously as she was when this was her latest single, and even as someone that has always loved Selena, I was never as interested in her art direction as this. Obviously, things happened and Selena had to readjust her entire life, and if that weird alternative album ever existed, it must have gotten scratched, but that won't ever stop me from fantasizing about the universe where, even if for a brief moment, she became a critical darling. In that universe I also would expect this to be head to head for the win, but in this reality, this is the best we can get.

---

**followingfreeways** (10): the verses being so ludicrously clunky really adds to the charm of this song. some may say its overrated. i say they are wrong

**nooodisaster** (10): Bizarre, crackpot metaphors that might just be genius. Offkilter, earworm production that feels modern and timeless. Playful, well-executed vocals that make you forget the queen of whispers is singing this. A total masterpiece.

---

#[honest](https://www.youtube.com/@honestboy)

**anothertown** (11): I'm hooting!

**fadedblue09** (11): Ariana and Pharrell better take notes because this is how you do a quirky, left-field but still enjoyable pop song

**Frajer** (11): just like the battle of Troy there's nothing subtle about why this is a 11 perfect use of a sample and this song manages to keep going to unexpected places

**IIIHenryIII** (11): such a great song, that‚Äôs the comment

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (11): the bass line on it's own would be enough to get this a good score tbh, but selena also sounds great on this, the lyrics are so fun and catchy, overall an incredible pop song

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): this belongs in textbooks for music theory

**runaway3212** (11): yeah it's clich√© but it's also too good

**slimboyfriend** (11): this score is my justification for trashing ¬æ of this album because for a brief moment in 2017 I believed in Selena Gomez so much that this became my most played song of the year and she decided to repay me three years later with a boring whisper of an album devoid of her magnum opus aka Bad Liar.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): she had a sampled bassline, esoteric julia michaels lyrics, and a dream

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): Glad she took this sample and used it well before some lazy tik toker took it

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**AHSWeeknd** (10): LESBIAN

**akanewasright** (10): the music video alone is enough reason for this score‚Ä¶ idk that it‚Äôs just like that Halsey video, Selena does it better

**bespectacIed** (10): Pop gem, nothing else to say. This is her slap the casuals and detractors (a.k.a. me) song, her own spiritual Run Away With Me, if you will. Flawless production and delivery. I always ascend when she hits that "and oh baybee let's make, realityyy" and the run to the end is just üëåchefs kiss. This is gonna be the dark horse of this rate, I'm not ruling out a surprise win

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): More like good song omg.

**bluehxrizon** (10): i love the nintendo switch sound

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): her best song idc if i‚Äôm being an indiehead rn it slays!!! what could have been!!!!!!!

**hikk** (10): talking heads have been real quiet since this one

**MassiveThief** (10): ooooh it hurts to not 11 this. this is amazing and still my fav Selener song by a lot. the lyrics and delivery are on POINT.

**pastapixal** (10): this song really shows how Selena knows what her strengths are and what aren't, this song is great and suits her so well

**pig-serpent** (10): I've always liked this so much more than the rest of her discography.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): everything about this song is kind of insane but in a good way

**throwaway-7650** (10): bogo you will be dealt with

**welcome2thejam** (10): What I call the speakers in the McDonalds lobby when I am once again tricked into thinking I'm about to bop along to Psycho Killer

**jasparghhh** (9.5): several of my straight guy friends like this song so you know Selena did something here

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): this song does not get the respect it deserves

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): Her absolute taste sampling the Talking Heads‚Ä¶ Unique-sounding bop with some awkward lyrics. I just know that ‚Äúcall me an amenity‚Äù is Bieber‚Äôs influence, he‚Äôs out here calling his wife an ‚Äúasset‚Äù in romantic songs

**TiltControls** (9.5): the battle of troy is not what I think of when I think of the word 'unsubtle' but you do you cause it seems to be working

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): great song!

**Bordersz** (9): Such a fresh sound and style. Vocals. She sound like her Disney money ran out. Sad she didn't go in this direction. Just a droplet.

**Frelock\_** (9): Has a groove I can get behind

**horridhendy** (9): Super catchy and fun

**jsonphile** (9): okay sample a talking heads song and you‚Äôre gonna get a good score from me Selena figured out the trick

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): I‚Äôm usually a Julia Michaels anti but this is so fun!! Idk what happened to this album but it would‚Äôve been miles better than Rare

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): The part where she says "OH BABY LETS MAAAAKE!!"? She has literally never sounded better. Literally why is she not singing like that more often???

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): I don‚Äôt want this to win because I don‚Äôt want Talking Heads to get another undeserved rate win

**CrimsonROSET** (8): yes

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i didn't like this at all when it was released but it's catchiness grew on me alot

**vayyiqra** (8): Haha it's the Talking Heads they won a rate that ruled. anyway I don't feel this song is really that good but it's hard to screw up that bassline.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.9): fetish outsold

**sydschoon** (7.7): I like this song but I think the lyricism could be better

**impla77** (7.5): liked this more than i remembered

**emayzee** (6.7): i like that it's more experimental than her other stuff but i've never enjoyed this nearly as much as others seem to

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): in my head this song goes off more. then i listen to it and i'm kind of disapointed. the way she pronounces liar makes me laugh.

**seanderlust** (6.5): [me when i make reality a reality](https://uploads.dailydot.com/db4/41/6e8734dfe00c1b1d.jpg?auto=compress&fm=pjpg)

**daythreeinmiami** (6): The music video is iconic though.

**Stryxen** (5): mid liar

**cremeebrulee** (4.3): i actually hate when people group this with fetish </3 like the chorus is alright but everything else is kinda boring

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Never really understood the hype around this one

**apatel27** (2): Mind numbingly boring

**flava** (2): I distinctly the level of acclaim this song got back in 2017 and being bewildered, like Selena just made the most desaturated and colourless alt pop song and literally everyone lined up to give her props for being so daring to make something so bland

**ReallyCreative** (2): lying isn't the only thing she's bad at, apparently

**indie\_fan\_** (1.3): honestly, zach campbell's reaction to this song reflects my thoughts on it as well. the most interesting part of this track is the music video more than the song itself

**amr** (1): first time listening expected an insanely good song but it sounds like everything else off rare w an even more annoying than usual chorus so the alleged acclaim is very confounding

**bogo** (0): i do not get this song at all it sounds blatantly undercooked and bland. i don't mind minimalism in a song but like, you still have to make it sound enjoyable and fun to listen to. this fails at that spectacularly

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (0): The xylophone is so rancid, the chorus is so irritating. I cannot play this song mainly for those two reasons.

You know what? Let me be happy that this lost and didn't surpass GIAW and NTLTC.

I'm not going to pretend this is a bad song, in fact, it's a very good one, but lord was it every overrated. I don't blame people that loved it, especially because I know how especial and important the lyrics were; sometimes you really need a song to remind you to just keep breathing, to keep on going; but this never had that much impact with me.

This had a slower climb to the top 3 than other songs, for a good while the top was stuck with Bad Liar, GIAW and NTLTC, but the second this was able to pass Selena, it rarely would go down from there. It's beloved for a reason, and even though I don't agree with it... I can't hate on this completing another Ariana podium sweep.

---

**nooodisaster** (10): Beautiful song on all fronts. An honest exploration of anxiety that unfortunately feels relatable to all too many of us. The mounting claps building to the drums, only to fall away into Ari's explosive final chorus delivery is breathtaking.

**followingfreeways** (6): i had no idea this was so well liked. i just feel like i would only listen to this if i was in  one of those trampoline places

---

#[kept breathing<3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRB-fKOO1dM)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (11): this is THAT anxiety attack anthem that anchored my hollow soul from being swept away into the abyss of total suicide.

**babadork** (11): I still like this song despite it occasionally popping into my head mid-panic attack, so I must love it.

**CrimsonROSET** (11): person who has been deeply on twitter for the last month: getting some major puss in boots 2 panic attack scene vibes from this

**rotating3Dtext** (11): anxiety, also, her voice here gives me chills

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): Might be the easiest 11 I've ever given‚Ä¶ Unfortunately that's not because I love Breathin a lot but because no other song in this whole rate is this good üíÄ

**welcome2thejam** (11): Yeah sorry to be basic but this just knocks out out of the damn park

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Hannah Lux Davis directed a 2000s perfume commercial and passed it off as a music video.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I think this is the song where the stans begged and pleaded it into becoming a single? Good for them.

**bogo** (10): man... shit just hits

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i cannot put into words the love i have for this song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): best power ballad ever, 80s hair metal could never

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): thinkin of the time my school wrote a parody of this that was about swimming

**dreamingpastel** (10): This is the best showcase of Ariana's vocals on this album.

**Frajer** (10): some days you need to be remembered to breathe thanks Ari

**hikk** (10): i listen to this a lot less than i did when the album dropped but it's still amazing

**ignitethephoenix** (10): when thing song came out, I was going through an injury that gave me terrible anxiety and a couple panic attacks. Of course like every anxious bitch, this song was such a comfort to me when it came out around the same time (also this album).

**jsonphile** (10): this is a fantastic song. Todd in the shadows was absolutely based when he put this as the best song of 2017. If we‚Äôre talking relatability of these artists, this is probably the most relatable song on here. Feeling stressed, overwhelmed, anxious, and needing to stop and just breathe. And paired with fantastic production, a great melody, and Ariana‚Äôs gorgeous vocals, it‚Äôs an all time great

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (10): not sure what it says about my mental stability that this almost made me cry...

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): Invented gospel

**runaway3212** (10): honestly a comfort song

**seanderlust** (10): the way this is legitimately good advice for anxiety disguised as a pop song...what am i paying my therapist for

**soul-glitch** (10): Chills

**Stryxen** (10): these lyrics are too much for me rn pretending I'm NOT listening

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): easy 10

**sydschoon** (10): relatable, ari went off on vocals, this song is so helpful for people with anxiety

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I wish this had more time to grow as a single before thank u next came and sucked all the oxygen out of the room

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this is truly some of the best live advice ever given

**throwaway-7650** (10): :hedgehog_float:

**vayyiqra** (10): Definitely the best song on this album (shoutout Max Martin, dude rocks). I remember being in the lab while this was playing on the radio and my partner was singing along. That dude rocks too. This proves this song rules. yuh

**sage** (9.8): a bit overrated but also its still an amazing song its just not one of her best

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): we all have mental health!!

**TiltControls** (9.5): I don't think it hits as much as some of her other midtempo powerhouse tracks, but it's still stellar

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): One of my favorite Ariana songs ever. A classic in every sense of the word.

**bluetriangles04** (9): kinda didn't understand why this was a single at the time but I get it now! also, my mother genuinely adores this song and made me appreciate it more as someone with you know, anxiety and the whole shabang.

**Frelock\_** (9): If it was just a bit faster, it'd totally be going in my workout playlist

**jasparghhh** (9): it's sad this song as a single was overshadowed by all the drama and moving on to thank u next

**oscarbrierley1** (9): it really builds up, the last chorus is such a burst of energy.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): this is going to be such a boring winner

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is cute but some of y'all act like its one of her best songs

**impla77** (8.5): A touch melodramatic with quite a generic guitar ‚Äòsolo‚Äô but this is just being nitpicky

**anothertown** (8): no one will ever be able to convince me this isn't a rework of love me harder

**bigbigbee** (8): hey, this song never hit for me until literally this rate! Thanks so much hosts!

**jasannn** (8): while i love the theme and its produced well, the execution is a bit vanilla.

**slimboyfriend** (8): does she still have that pig from the music video or do u think she ate it afterward

**akanewasright** (7): yeah this is the weakest single here by far. It‚Äôs a good song, but like I said earlier, this is one of the last sweetener songs I‚Äôd put on when I need to take deep breaths and ground myself. There‚Äôs a decent chance this‚Äôll win by virtue of being the least controversial, most basic song in the rate‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôll get it, because it is an objectively well made pop song, but I won‚Äôt be very happy about it

**Around-town** (7): the only song I really liked on this album

**emayzee** (7): this is kinda diet all the time by zara larsson to me even though this came out first [host note: girl what]

**nt96** (7): Frankie Grande you will never be famous

**flava** (6.5): thank you ariana, i almost forgot to breathe for a second there

#choked

**cremeebrulee** (6.8): i can appreciate the backstory but it just feels a bit underwritten and the guitar in the bridge is kinda corny. it's my least favorite of the sweetener singles, so i hope it does not win x

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): I don‚Äôt hate this one, but she doesn‚Äôt sell it

**goodbyesindisguise** (6): some of her best vocals live I just don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs enough thematically for me

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): pretty but boring

**w1nter\_ac0ustic** (4): i just find this a bit boring

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): never really got the hype for this one, the chorus is kinda weak

**amr** (1): super generic and boring sounding and doesn't have any fun vocal flourishes like giaw that justifies the praise it gets to my brain. only recently learned it was a single too which is quite the choice considering the rest of the album's offerings

**fadedblue09** (0): honestly I never liked this song, it's like her label wanted her to sing an empowerment anthem because everyone was expecting her to do so, but this just feels half assed in every way. The chorus feels so sloppy and lifeless, and the MV was similarly lazy. If Ariana ever called this song boring (just like Touch It), I wouldn't be shocked at all

#:/


**bespectacIed** (10): Ariana making a top anthem (just keep breeding) knowing what her fanbase is composed of, we love representing marginalized peoples! ‚úä


**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Every time I hear this song I can just think of that post that was like ‚Äújust keep breeding and breeding and breeding and breeding‚Äù

I'm not even going to lie, I thought this would win, I was hoping NTLTC would do so, but I was fully expecting this to take it. It's an amazing song and it was beloved everywhere, and the reception to it was so much better than NTLTC at the moment (except for that brief moment when the lyrics were leaked and people were bitchy about the fact that it was a song about sex).

Every big popstar needs a song comparing religion to love/sex, and she really went all out with this one. Straight up mentioning God instead of vaguely referring to religious imagery was brave as hell, and being as outwardly sexual in the music video as she was was just teasing conservative freaks to get her ass, but it had to be done to make one of the most iconic pop songs of the last decade. If someone ever asked me what the best song of the trap-pop era was, I would easily answer with this, and I'd expect them to agree.

---

**nooodisaster** (10): "AND I CAN TELL THAT YOU KNOW I KNOW HOW I WANT IT". The title. The production. The whistle tones. The music video. Everything about this song became an instant classic.

---

#when you call my name is like a little prayer im down on my knees i wanna take you there

**bluetriangles04** (11): good god when this dropped I was completely in my arianator phase and I don't regret it! this is simply just one of my favorite pop songs EVER. does that make me boring? yuh, maybe. but she just killed this song in general. the breakdown/slowdown in the prechorus, the outro, everything about this song is just perfect to me.

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): [yuh](https://imgur.com/a/8MLPvwZ)

**ignitethephoenix** (11): it‚Äôs the smasha, one of my favorite songs by her

**impla77** (11): I remember when the lyrics leaked and popheads was bitching about it being about sex but then it came out and everyone was like.. but this slaps actually.

**1998tweety** (10): sasha colby

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a timeless slayage

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): they're probably non-binary but yass!

**anothertown** (10): this needed a Joseph Kahn music video from 2001 with hoverbikes and ice storms and latex outfits and stuff

**bespectacIed** (10): I love the implication that true spiritual enlightenment could only be achieved through communing with the cooch. It's so esoteric and pagan and mystical, I love it. Ariana is a student of the Divine Feminine, bless her

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Ended several religions.

**bogo** (10): but halsey said that they're not a woman, they're a god so how can god be a woman then? checkmate ariana

**Bordersz** (10): The high note on the bridge is everything.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): and that woman is sasha colby next question

**DaHumanTorch** (10): easily one of the best pop music videos of all time

**Darkknuckles** (10): queen shit.

**hikk** (10): one of the best songs of the trap-pop trend, the way the bass plays thru my headphones rattles my brain

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this makes me feel cunty

**jasannn** (10): one of the best produced songs ever????

**jasparghhh** (10): we all know where we were when we first watched the music video and the gophers screeched

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (10): yes she is

**pig-serpent** (10): The trap beat is very muted instead of the more standard in your face approach, but with the extra room they create they add layers and layers of Weeknd esque synth hits and choirs.  No space in the mix is wasted and everything about this intricate beat works perfectly.

**runaway3212** (10): god I love ariana when she goes full I can Sing

**sage** (10): bottom 3 on here but amazing still

**Stryxen** (10): Lord...

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I'll believe that God is a bop

**throwaway-7650** (10): FTR this is #NOT as good as breathin despite my scores

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): why would i have to believe it when you're done, she already is a woman and her name is Addison Rae

**fadedblue09** (9.5): used to dislike this a lot but I like it now! Still doesn't feel like it belongs on this album though

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): getting flashbacks to the sweetener tour rn... ariana opening with this in an all black outfit... that bass hitting irl... literally shaking from the memory

**Frajer** (9): would have been the darkest timeline if Camila Cabello sang this

**jsonphile** (9): it‚Äôs such a power move to title a song ‚ÄúGod is a woman‚Äù which has several theological implications and is sure to make people angry and then it turns out the song is just Ariana saying she‚Äôs great at sex

**pastapixal** (9): love this song, really glad it went to Ari, can't imagine anyone else singing it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPEU2tHBrqI

**welcome2thejam** (9): Really benefitting from playing this in a dark room at 6am. Oh god that outro was great

**sydschoon** (8.9): iconic

**akanewasright** (8): that gopher in the MV has ruined lives‚Ä¶

**Frelock\_** (8): Loved the ending chorales.

**goodbyesindisguise** (8): its sexy it‚Äôs fun it grew on me so much over the years

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): god this hasn't aged that well for me but i can't deny it is a good song and i did really love it on release. i just never want to listen to it now

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Things changed when she fingered the earth

**MassiveThief** (7.5): those prechorus yuhs kinda haunt me in my nightmares

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): good but overplayed

**Awkward\_King** (7): a very objectively good song but it never did a whole lot for me personally! but i cant deny its star power like this was a moment

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Good for her

**soul-glitch** (7): That title is incredible

#atheist

**flava** (6.5): I mean it‚Äôs good but it isn‚Äôt all that interesting and I see no reason to ever come back to it

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): the chorus is catchy but the beat is really generic.

**vayyiqra** (6): When this album came out my friend messaged me to complain that her roommate kept playing this album and that this song is annoying. Even though I don't hate it, maybe points were made. I go back and forth between thinking this is good and not very good so today it caught me on an off day. yuh

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I can‚Äôt decide whether I like it or don‚Äôt

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): Ariana really had to pull out those whistle tones and harmonizing choirs towards the end because what else was going on here? I know I'm super in the minority here but this is a mess

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): shrunk on me but the video made me nostalgic for the time when pop girls were still extraordinary

**TiltControls** (3): this has a ton of elements to work, but I don't think any of it actually comes together and ends up turning into a bit of a slog to get through

**musical\_pyn** (0): I know a lot of people consider this one of ariana's best but I genuinely don't think anything on this song works other than the outro--I don't think the vocal performance is good, the trap beat clashes with the rest of the instrumental, the ad libs don't really go anywhere or add that much, every time the song switches between the hook/chorus I'm completely taken out of this song, and there's like two good lyrics. The outro is good, like I said, but fifteen seconds is not enough for me to listen to the entire thing again.

# that was a prophet

**slimboyfriend** (6): have u seen that tiktok where this girl says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna say something controversh‚Ä¶.. Dr Pepper is a woman‚Ä¶.. and she‚Äôs a gynecologist‚Äù

Here we have it folks!!!

I'm so so so glad this won. Maybe it seems obvious now that you see the chart and see that this was literally never not winning, but I was a pophead back when this released, and to say that this was controversial would be an understatement. Truly all eyes were on Ariana after what happened in Manchester, and not everyone was satisfied with this being the first thing she released after it; a lot of people were mocking the reports that said that people were in tears after listening to it, [it was the Ariana single to get cut out of the 2018 year end list](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/afd090/the_top_100_tracks_of_2018_according_to_rpopheads/edyf83x/) ([look, here I am back then mad about it!](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/afd090/the_top_100_tracks_of_2018_according_to_rpopheads/edyk39x/)); so I was worried the win would go to either of the two other singles, but you guys pulled through with the taste in here.

This is the only correct winner idc. As much as I would have loved a Selena win, as amazing as God is a woman is, this release was truly a game changer for Ariana. It was the moment where she officially become more than just a famous popstar, but one of the defining talents of our generation. It was the moment where her releases officially became a grand event.

After this released, she would go through more tragedies, as if life was testing if she truly had no tears left to cry, and this entire era would get overshadowed by the media circus built around her personal life, revealing that the fa√ßade the entire era was based on, which only made this song make more sense for me. It's not a true statement about how she feels, it's manifestation about what she wants to be like, it's faking it till you make it, and that just connects with me in a very personal level. Despite all her flaws, despite everything she's been through, she decided to try and picture a world where she isn't phased by any of it to try to make things feel less horrible, and that just moves me. It might not solve anything, but it sure makes things feel better for a little while, which sometimes it's all you need when you are really going through it.

**nooodisaster** (8): See, I'm not biased to Ari! This was never my favorite song by hers, so giving it my 11 would've just been a lie. But it's still a great song that's aged like fine wine. The production is polished yet still cutting edge. Ari sounds unbelievable, all while sprouting non-sense that only she could make sound good (or at least fun to listen to). Every time the chorus hits you're flown into sonic heaven. A sweetener, indeed.

ExActsRate: #we vibin

**AHSWeeknd** (11): she did in fact have tears left to cry

**akanewasright** (11): man‚Ä¶ this is just something special. It‚Äôs probably the wildest out of the big Max/Ariana tracks throughout her entire career. Like there‚Äôs the UK garage elements, the cool ass chords, the amazing choir of Arianas that‚Äôs only used as backup‚Ä¶ genuinely it‚Äôs so fucking sick, and that‚Äôs without getting into how it makes me feel. It just feels like hard won happiness, and the fight for it makes it even sweeter. Like yeah, she was lying to herself a little, but so do I, so I don‚Äôt mind.

**DaHumanTorch** (11): this song is so incredibly important to me i couldn't not give it my 11, even though i'm not sure if it's even my favorite on the album anymore. i still get full body chills and am transported to release night everytime i hear those music video vocal runs at the start. a pop masterpiece and one of the best singles of the entire century thus far

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): this is nerdy and indieheads vibes HOWEVER i remember clearly reading the Pitchfork track review of this song. When it mentioned ‚ÄúBut then, as Grande sings, ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt got no tears left to cry/So I‚Äôm pickin‚Äô it up, pickin‚Äô it up,‚Äù the percussion shuffles into a UK garage-inspired beat, another little nod to Manchester.‚Äù this having a subtle nod really got me emotional; I loved that she had this loving musical touch to the city after the awful attacks that happened at her concert. It really made my heart grow for this song and aside from that it‚Äôs just an amazing and powerful song. I play it like crazy and I think it‚Äôs a perfect pop song. It still fits Ari‚Äôs personality with the vocal runs and lyrics, and everything here just locks into place so beautifully. My favorite song of hers.

**dreamingpastel** (11): I loved this song the moment I first listened to it in 2018, and I still love it now. An easy 11.

**Frelock\_** (11): I want to be here like, all the time! I'm lovin, I'm livin, I'm turning it up!

**ImADudeDuh** (11): she put her entire pussy into this lets be real.

**jsonphile** (11): is choosing this as my 11 predictable? Yes. Am I going to do it anyway? Also yes. This is the first song by Ariana Grande that I absolutely loved on first listen. It‚Äôs just this gorgeous, lush, ethereal sound with some amazing vocals and great lyrics

**MassiveThief** (11): I had this on REPEAT the day it came out and in turn got sick of it, but listening again after almost 5 years (blegh) it's impeccable. BEAUTIFULLY produced, anthemic chorus, and a wonderful performance from ari. we vibin <3

**PretentiousPegasus** (11): when Ariana said ‚Äúthe light is coming to bring back everything the darkness stole‚Äù she meant the light = NTLTC, and the darkness = the state of pop music in 2018

**ReallyCreative** (11): she clearly hadn't watched Everything Everywhere All At Once when she wrote this song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): remember when this song was released and this sub absolutely lost its mind and shat on it bc it wasn't into you 2.0. legit if you have't seen the release thread for this song you truly need to the meltdowns were insane. anyway this is a fucking amazing top song and easily one of ariana's best. it feels very timeless and hasn't dated at all imo. i would consider this one of her signature songs

**throwaway-7650** (11): [cultural reset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxKSjUwKdU) (and add in the heavenly choir intro? yeah this MV is iconic)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): could've been an eleven had Breathin' stopped existing while I'm ugly-crying at my depression.

**Awkward\_King** (10): mothered

**bespectacIed** (10): I sensed a generational SERVE from the first notes

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Obvious winner is VERY obvious. But deserved.

**bluehxrizon** (10): this would've been a perfect opener I can't stand her

**bogo** (10): \*narrator voice\* she did, in fact, have tears left to cry

**cremeebrulee** (10): i was not on popheads when this dropped, so i'm bewildered that people did not like this as a lead single!? i think this release is what pushed me into becoming an actual ariana fan rather than a casual listener

**Darkknuckles** (10): iconic song

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): this changed my life went it came out‚Ä¶ truly converted me to the ‚ÄúAri is the main pop girl we need‚Äù camp

**fadedblue09** (10): this was polarizing upon release? I thought this was the only good single she had this era

**Frajer** (10): still a cute bop if Ari told me to shut my mouth I would never leave the house ever again

**hikk** (10): ok ngl i think this is the weakest single and not one of her absolute best but it's still rly good i have to give it a 10

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this was never my favorite on first listen, but I think this has aged better than a lot of her other songs. Max Martin and team put their whole pussies into this production

**IIIHenryIII** (10): no 11 left to leave üôÅ

**jasannn** (10): this is what I thought poptimism was until about a year and half ago (pop songs about being optimistic)

**jasparghhh** (10): this song deserved to be Ariana's first #1 it was a MOMENT when it dropped and the music video?? when Ariana tweeted on the one year anniversary "turns out I did have more tears to cry" I felt that

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): this is probably ariana‚Äôs song that most deserves a win, and it‚Äôll probably win. truly a triumphant comeback

**oscarbrierley1** (10): a great mid point between the experimentation of the pharrel songs and the pop sensibilities of the max martin songs.

**pastapixal** (10): THIS IS SO FUN TO BELT OMG, that is all

**Stryxen** (10): RHINO IMANNASTADAMANNNN

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this was a moment even for me

**TiltControls** (10): honestly didn't click with me til a few years later, but now it's definitely one of the best in Ariana's discography

**1998tweety** (9.5): ate

**flava** (9.5): I love a rate winner

**horridhendy** (9.5): Great song. Love the video.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): the release thread for this was one of the first major drops I was around on ph to witness, and boy what a fucking mess it was. Crazy to see how much the opinion has shifted on it since.

**sydschoon** (9.2): we love a self-love positivity BOP

**anothertown** (9): sometimes i hate this and sometimes i think it's the best thing max martin produced between since u been gone and after hours

**bluetriangles04** (9): this turned my life upside down at the time and no, that pun actually wasn't intended bye I'm going to stop typing...

**CrimsonROSET** (9): honestly now actually focusing on it the production on the chorus actually sounds so empty? I never noticed it

**vayyiqra** (9): This song is so jarring every time because it begins like it's going to be the most dramatic ballad ever and then the rest is nothing like that! It's catchy though; I like the line "we vibin'"'; sure it's pretty good I guess? I didn't like it at all at first! Weird song but not an awful winner. yuh

**impla77** (8.3): I still think this was a weird first single choice, but I‚Äôve come to appreciate it much more than I did initially

**goodbyesindisguise** (8): this song really got better over time

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Can‚Äôt believe they made Utica and Symone lip sync to this

**pig-serpent** (7): I've always respected this song more than I enjoy listening to it, but I feel like it's the most ambitious song in the rate so I'm compulsed to give it a high score.

**soul-glitch** (7): We vibin

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I think‚Ä¶ this is where everything started to go wrong for Ariana. The weird production, the awkward black slang, the terrible enunciation‚Ä¶ Thankfully this song doesn't suck but it was a harbinger of worse things to come

**welcome2thejam** (7): I'm living I'm laughing I'm loving I'm picking it up

#4 negative comments,,, like, idk guys maybe you are the ones in the wrong idk

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): same as giaw, overplayed

**runaway3212** (6): it's really not all that guys

**musical\_pyn** (5): I like the opening, but the song has never surpassed "okay" for me, i expect the intro to lead somehwere and then it just does‚Ä¶that

**Treecoh** (1): one point for each word she enunciates properly

ExActsRate: 
**Treecoh** (9.000): This is apparently my 4th most played album of all time and I am a boomer so there was some competition. Almost every track on the album just hits. A staple in the workout/running playlist rotation.

**throwaway-7650** (8.620): <- could be even higher with better tracklisting

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.600): This album claimed my life for like 18 months omg,,,,saw them in concert with one of my besties in Brooklyn,,,my Lovatic era fr. Demi in this R&B and alt-R&B sound is just unmatched for me and I think it‚Äôs her best fit with her vocals. Even with the production critiques idk how to divorce my great memories with this album, lowkey some of my happier moments in my life lkskldlks. An album I played to the ground and it‚Äôs fun to revisit.

**AHSWeeknd** (8.533): The whole Grammys thing behind this was rotten

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8.500): This album sounds like it never left 2017 but it‚Äôs still a good time

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.400): T B H this is Demi‚Äôs best album, the r&b/soul sound suits them so well and I hope they revisit it someday. It also feels like Demi‚Äôs... healthiest(?) album in a weird sort of way. Like on some of their other albums it feels like Demi is exposing herself to an unhealthy degree or conversely trying to force themself to be someone that they aren‚Äôt, but here it seems like she just made the album that she wanted. Still personal and vulnerable, but in a balanced and healthy way.

**Bordersz** (8.187): Demi's best album to date.

**fadedblue09** (8.133): My favorite album of the bunch but hilariously enough, I don't think this is a personal album at all. It's very obvious Demi created this album as Grammy bait and while I clowned them for a bit back then, I feel bad about it now. Nonetheless, this is still a very solid effort and provided a glimpse of a different side of Demi's voice, one which we probably won't hear from in a while.

**jasparghhh** (8.133): I've always loved Demi but I feel like her albums never age very well, even though I always eat them up when they're new. TMYLM definitely suffers from this the least, but there are still a good number of songs I don't vibe with the same as I did in 2017. Always rooting for Demi though!!

**OliviaGodrigo** (8.100): this is a perfect pop r&b album if you ignore the deluxe tracks

**dreamingpastel** (8.040): Very surprised at how solid this album is!

**akanewasright** (7.947): man‚Ä¶ this album makes me kinda sad because (in my opinion) Demi got REALLY close to making a great album here. They found a great genre for their voice and wrote some good ass songs‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a little filler here and there, but this was by far their best and most consistent work to this point. I like good chunks of a lot of their other albums, but this is still the only one I‚Äôd recommend listening to as a whole. It‚Äôs kind of depressing that they haven‚Äôt been able to build on that since (in my opinion).

**welcome2thejam** (7.600): Just a generally & consistently solid outing

**Darkknuckles** (7.600): This album is best to hear at 4am walking a street alone.

**bespectacIed** (7.400): Weakest album on the rate for sure but still pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Yes I am a sweetner stan thru and thru, I've never listened to the other two in full, so I am glad I didn't hate both. Demi parented in this

**bogo** (7.267): would you settle for "like a decent amount"

**PretentiousPegasus** (7.267): although I‚Äôm a rockvato stan through and through, TMYLM is criminally underrated. It aged so well. Her voice suits R&B, and in this album she‚Äôs not doing her oversinging Xtina impression as much either which is a bonus.

**oscarbrierley1** (7.267): some of the songs are a bit samey and some of the vocals are a bit too much, but its one of demi's best albums. i didn't realise that it came out on my birthday until i did the rate.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7.200): 7 I'm sorry dear, you'll definitely get crushed by the couple superior albums here

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.067): I had a bit of a negative reaction listening to this for the first time, but as time went on, the more and more I started to get accustomed to Demi and their voice. Is Demi a bit too loud at times? Yeah. But a lot of songs here show off their vocal versatility as well, those dynamic shifts between loud and soft. In the end, I liked this album more than I thought I would, but I still wouldn't say it's for me.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.800): Too many ballads? It‚Äôs ok but doesn‚Äôt have much replay value.

**hikk** (6.633): daddy issues is one of their best songs, and there's a couple other bops, unfortunately i find the back half very boring,

**TiltControls** (6.567): I did prefer Demi's more rockier stuff, but there's some great stuff here too

**Around-town** (6.333): great album

**bookthieving** (6.200): i have parasocial beef with oak felder

**horridhendy** (6.167): Tbh, I'm not crazy about this album. There are definitely some good songs but plenty of duds. I think I tend to prefer her bops over her ballads. Don't hate me but I'm just not really a big fan of Demi's voice, I think she over-sings a bit. But overall the album is fine/good. Sorry, not sorry.

**jasannn** (6.133): I don‚Äôt hate this album but it really did nothing for me. Somehow this my 2nd lowest album I‚Äôve rated (2nd to the vamps‚Ä¶)

**jsonphile** (6.067): I liked both of the singles from this, but beyond that this album is just not that good. No real standouts beyond the first two songs here

**sydschoon** (6.033): never listened to this record all the way through but I LOVE Demi‚Äôs voice so I am READY

**anothertown** (6.000): this shrunk so bad. i remember being so excited at the time that she had finally made a good album but no

**nt96** (5.767): Demi has always been pretty meh for me. She‚Äôs a phenomenal vocalist but her music is never up to par like wtf girl.

**goodbyesindisguise** (5.733): I‚Äôve never listened to this album before. I like the use of horns throughout! The middle was kind of a drag to get through though

**cremeebrulee** (5.340): this was kinda bad sry lmao

**MassiveThief** (5.267): a few good tracks with a lot of mid, i dont think the writing is good enough to justify most of the ballads.

**flava** (5.000): disappointment will always sting more than just being bad

**dream\_fighter2018** (4.933): this album just feels like a whole lot of nothing. I can‚Äôt even tell you what specifically I didn‚Äôt like it because absolutely nothing sticks out about it to me, it‚Äôs that drab and drags on that much.

**vayyiqra** (4.467): Oh no ... I used to like Demi, or at least I liked *Demi* (2013 album), but haven't liked a lot of the music she's put out overall. There's also their "messiness" and being a "zany" person, which can be offputting, but I know she has many problems that explain that, and besides I'm trying not to factor that into my scores. If anything I was being *nicer* because of that. This album was okay but I have nothing to say in the comments. Really I feel little for it. It's kind of (I hate this word but) "dated", radio-friendly pop; some badly written songs and odd production choices (please no more pitched-down vocals ever) but competently made. Not awful but I don't want to listen to it again soon.

**pig-serpent** (3.500): I think this album does just about everything wrong.  It's too ballad heavy, the lyrics are consistently bad enough for me to notice how much they suck (and I don't pay attention to lyrics at all!), and the production was clearly made by competent people because the mixing and panning are on point, but most of the instruments feel like they're not fully there and it leads to many of the arrangements being cacophonous.  To make matters worse, Demi's voice is constantly poorly produced too, meaning that it's just a sharp knife though the mix, straight to my head.  None of the arrangements feel particularly inspired, so the only parts of this album I like are a few of the vocal melodies.  Luckily there are a few more organic songs on the album, which while nothing special, are at least a break from the constant noise of the rest of the album.

ExActsRate: **vayyiqra** (8.650): Wow I love this album! This is sure to be a popular take in this rate! üòÄ Really like the lyrical themes of "growing" and "learning" and "finding yourself" and whatnot. Not a big fan of how the deluxe rearranges the whole tracklist but it's not that long and I know it's because we needed to shoehorn in the singles that Popheads hivemind agrees are "good, unlike every other Selena Gomez song". This is because I am living on another planet where everyone but me thinks Selena Gomez makes abominable dogshit music except for those songs. Science cannot explain this.

**throwaway-7650** (8.175): if I did another listen my average would probably drop by a point

**IIIHenryIII** (7.600): Funny how the less gifted singer has the better album. Sweetener is better from a critical point of view, but this one is a lot more fun and flows so well.

**jsonphile** (7.525): I always think I don‚Äôt like Selena Gomez that much, and then I listen to some songs or an album from her and I realize wait actually I guess I kinda do

**fadedblue09** (7.450): I'm gonna deliver the hot take and say this album is the most sonically intriguing of the three. While some of the criticisms are deserved, it has a lot of ideas but doesn't fully realize most of them. Half of the album continues Revival's dance-pop sound, and another delves into bedroom altpop, and each side has its own gems and duds. Had Selena been more committed with this album, it definitely would have been a better experience.

**AHSWeeknd** (7.400): The deluxe tracks were a lot more in the vein of a Bad Liar/Fetish album

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7.300): 8 this is my favorite Selena Gomez record, but that's like not a monumental thing to say

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.100): Love that the hosts drew the line at including ‚ÄúWolves‚Äù

**horridhendy** (7.050): I liked this album a lot more than I thought I would especially because I'm not overly familiar with Selena's music. There are some really solid tracks here and overall I think I enjoyed it more than TMYLM. Too much vocal modulation/autotune for my tastes. A little too cohesive, a lot of the songs started to blur into one.

**cremeebrulee** (6.985): my go-to example of why scrobbles =/= personal enjoyment because why do i have like 300 scrobbles of this album i don't like it like that

**jasparghhh** (6.950): I just want to take this opportunity to join everyone who gets annoyed by Selena referring to this as SG2 and ignoring her entire first four albums. Give her the same flack you give Miley and Demi for shitting on their past stuff!!!

**akanewasright** (6.920): I miss Revival‚Ä¶ idk if it‚Äôs actually better or if I was just 14 when it came out, but I still like it way more than Rare, there‚Äôs at least a bit more variety in the vocals there

**indie\_fan\_** (6.880): Selena's team really fucked up with the single choice. Lose You To Love Me is fine enough i guess, but the other two coulda been either tossed aside or stayed as deep cuts. Couple other tracks here that I like more and could see performing well enough.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.875): An album that‚Äôs somewhat overhated or overly called mid, etc lol. There are some fun, dynamic and sleek cuts on here. Some songs have such great snappy and just COOL production. My secret wish is for Selena to lean into a more experimental pop sound, since her small voice could be used in cool ways with some good producers (I listened to Rare for the first time near my first Shygirl - Nymph listen so I think working with producers like that could be cool. Or working with Avalon Emerson omg?!?!). I don‚Äôt think this will happen tho lol. But yeah some nice songs in here!

**jasannn** (6.800): This is good no-think album. The production is super clean at times but there‚Äôs ton of forgettable filler.

**hikk** (6.775): idk it's just mid as hell mostly, we love payola with bad liar/fetish to make the rate more interesting bc those are both so good

**welcome2thejam** (6.650): All over the place. There's definitely some good songs, but Selena's lack of carry potential means she can't pull the more uninteresting tracks up

**sydschoon** (6.620): When rare deluxe was released Selena switched up the tracklist and it didn‚Äôt sit well with me so we‚Äôll see how this goes

**nt96** (6.600): It started out ok but it really started to drag out towards the end. This album was NOT interesting enough to go on for this long. There‚Äôs a certain soundscape that Selena was going for but the issue is there are good albums that flow together, whereas albums like these, blend together. Not a good thing.

**bespectacIed** (6.550): I gotta borrow an NBA meme for this: I owed you an apology, selena. I wasn't really familiar with your game. I was like, hold. the. fuck. up? I got lots of head nods and bops and feet stamps with this??? Selenur, I should have kept my eye on you üßê

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6.450): you know, I listened to this album once back in 2020 and it‚Äôs honestly a lot better than I remembered.

**TiltControls** (6.400): while I still don't love the album, there are some tracks that grew on me after a while

**slimboyfriend** (6.375): How many publications did she pay to give this ‚Öò stars

**pastapixal** (6.235): Selena was again proves that you don't need any musical skill to make good music! Shade aside she really puts out bop after bop, loved her since Wizards‚ú®

**PretentiousPegasus** (6.100): Including Selena in with vocalists like Ariana and Demi was just setting her up for failure lmao, Miley would‚Äôve been the more comparable ex act. As far as the album goes it‚Äôs kind of just there for me. It‚Äôs definitely not bad, just not particularly interesting or memorable.

**MassiveThief** (6.075): has the issues I expected it to with filler and inconsistency, but still a good album. definitely her best from what I've heard

**goodbyesindisguise** (6.025): this got me through my final semester of school. It‚Äôs not an incredible album but it got me into Selena and there are some bops!

**oscarbrierley1** (5.750): this suffered from really poor single choices. i feel like there's a good album amongst the tracks. she really does whisper for most of it.

**anothertown** (5.725): well this was recorded and released

**Around-town** (5.650): I think this album would have been better if it wasn't so long. I has a lot of mid-tier songs between each good song

**bogo** (5.550): it's just not very good

**dreamingpastel** (5.550): Once you get past the first few songs (or, you know, ignore them entirely), it's not the worst album in the world.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.450): She gave literally nothing on this album‚Ä¶ Like there was NO point when listening to this where I thought "Yes, this sounds like a girl who wants to be here!" I'm usually kinda reluctant to point out when an artist has a bad voice, but Selena Gomez CANNOT SING! Like oh my god she is so bad at this I am in disbelief. She doesn't have a pleasant tone, her voice is shaky, and most importantly of all, she sings with no urgency. There is zero emotion or personality in her voice. She sounds like she's being forced to be here and she'd rather be doing anything else. And maybe the reason why I feel so comfortable just trashing her like this is because there are moments, few and far between (Vulnerable, Ring, Bad Liar) where she finally sings with effort and she actually sounds perfectly fine?? Like this awful wispy-voice singing is a conscious choice Selena?? SALINA???

**pig-serpent** (5.375): I've been a Selena Gomez anti for a while, but this album was a lot better than I was expecting.  She's still consistently the worst part of her own songs, but her team can write some good tunes that sound nice, even if the overall sound of this album is fairly trite.  It's a shame that she's really holding back the best songs on this album.

**flava** (5.325): i won‚Äôt ever come back to it, but this exceeded expectations

**Stryxen** (5.275): Idk exactly what I'm referring to but, why does this whole album sound like *that* EDIT: I figured it out its julia michaels fault

**dream\_fighter2018** (5.250): Look. I don‚Äôt find Selena Gomez very interesting. I can‚Äôt buy into her ‚Äúmost personal‚Äù era because I am not invested in her at all. She has a few songs that are okay, but they‚Äôre certainly not in this album. Most of these songs are fine instrumentally, but it feels like they need a stronger singer to carry the material. And strong singer, Selena is not. I‚Äôm just not buying it, at all.

**apatel27** (4.200): god this album is boring. The second half drags so much and is filled with boring beats it's incredible.

=====

ExActsRate: **DaHumanTorch** (10.067): my favorite pop album of all time and one of my favorite albums period

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9.733): Ariana‚Äôs all-time best album and my favorite album of all time.

**AHSWeeknd** (9.667): Anyone who says this is a good album but rates the Pharell tracks poorly is a bandwagoner

**throwaway-7650** (9.653): magnum opus (only haven't heard ME in full but like be fr)

**bespectacIed** (9.200): I got it the first time, I didn't have to stockholm myself into liking, didn't need to be convinced by the OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE reception from critics. We sweetener stans are inherently tasteful like that

**akanewasright** (9.067): man this album has gotten me through a lot. This is probably the biggest comfort album in my library, and one of few that I can really rely on to calm me down when I‚Äôm having intense anxiety. It means a lot to me, but it‚Äôs also just a DAMN well made album

**Stryxen** (9.000): aged like fine milk

**hikk** (8.867): kind of rly outclasses the other two i fear, and i would not be surprised at all if the 3 max martin singles make up the top 3, but i'm so happy we finally are rating this cuz it was crazy overdue

**cremeebrulee** (8.847): SWEEPENER!!!!!!

**babadork** (8.747): I knew that I liked this album, but I didn‚Äôt realize it was the kind of like that leads to having one of the highest averages that I‚Äôve ever given.

**jasparghhh** (8.533): Sweetener is Ariana's best album thematically and her most important imo. Seeing how Ariana reacted to the terrorist attack and coming back with Sweetener as a way to put positivity into the world (even if she might have been lying to herself a bit as to how she was better) is what made me a stan and I'll always have a special place for Sweetener. Positions is controversially my favorite Ariana album tho so maybe I don't deserve an opinion

**jasannn** (8.467): Everytime I listen to this album, I go through a roller coaster of thoughts. I doubt if this is really one of my favorite albums ever throughout the first few tracks. Then once God is a woman comes on, I remember why and it‚Äôs smash after smash. Max Martin and Pharell brought their A-game and created incredible produced tracklist of songs while all being anchored by this peachy warmth of Ariana‚Äôs vocals and lyrics.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.200): It deserves the hype, even the songs that aren‚Äôt my thing. Airy, floaty and bittersweet album that strikes a good balance of endearing and heartfelt.

**bogo** (8.133): my favorite indie album ‚ù§Ô∏è

**nt96** (8.067): This album surprised me when I first heard it. At the time, Ariana was always in that ‚Äúbasic pop girl‚Äù department, where there music isn‚Äôt always bad, but there‚Äôs nothing that stands out from the rest of all the other pop fluff aside from the fact that they just happen to be the most popular. Sweetener struck me as a bold album. She really flipped the script and started messing around with different sounds, which easily helped her stand out from the other two girls. While not all of the tracks struck gold, Sweetener was the most interesting of the three and it showed how willing Ariana was to taking the road less travelled; that in itself is always admirable to me.

**Frajer** (8.000): Following up an era as iconic as Dangerous Woman was quite the task but she mainly achieves it aggressive Pharrell production and saying yuh so many times I lost count and had to make this meme https://imgur.com/gallery/xdX95wJ aside

**LesApfels** (7.633): Somehow this has become my go-to comfort album when stressed out. Ariana really gaslit herself so thoroughly it rubs off on the listener!

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.600): honestly other than the light is coming, the production on this album is super strong and one of its biggest assets. Not sure why it is so hated

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7.600): 9 this is easily my favorite album out of this lineup.

**vayyiqra** (7.533): Good album! The discourse about it was awful! But good album! Well, mixed-to-good album. But when it's good sure it's good. "Objectively" this is the frontrunner and even though I'm going full Selenator mode, I'd rather a song from it wins than from Demi's album, so sure do your thing Popheads. yuh

**goodbyesindisguise** (7.533): a top tier pop album to me. forever associated with Australia sun so even when I listen years later I feel pure joy ü•≤

**MassiveThief** (7.500): this is a pretty good album. not great, not bad. of the issues, pharrell is NOT one. shoutout pharrell.

**oscarbrierley1** (7.400): I wish that people had opened their ears more and enjoyed the Pharrel songs, because her albums would be much better if she had continued experimenting more sonically. The rest of the songs are catchy, but the trap sound is a bit played out for me.

**dreamingpastel** (7.367): Well, this was an album with some high highs and low lows.

**horridhendy** (7.333): Some great songs, some good songs and a couple of duds. It doesn't stack up against Ariana's best but it's still definitely the best album in the rate by a decent amount. Justice for The Light is Coming

**jsonphile** (7.167): Ariana Grande is easily my favorite artist of these three. That said, this album has some‚Ä¶inconsistency issues. It‚Äôs got two of Ariana‚Äôs best songs ever, but also a lot of not so great songs thanks to Mr. Despicable Me

**anothertown** (7.100): would the jack antonoff discourse exist without this record (a 5 part series)

**TiltControls** (6.967): Some... questionable production choices on some of the tracks here, but when it works the tracks are some of the catchiest in Ariana's discography

**bookthieving** (6.933): #sweepener

**welcome2thejam** (6.867): Yeah I didn't think the Pharrell tracks were too bad overall, but they're definitely the parts of this album that made me go "?" the most for better or worse

**PretentiousPegasus** (6.800): sweetener sits at an interesting place in Ariana‚Äôs discography. It has some of her highest highs but also some of her lowest lows. ~~Team Edward~~ Team Max Martin I guess

**bigbigbee** (6.700): does anyone remember that phenomenon of people who did makeup to look exactly like Ariana? I think it‚Äôs died off a little bit in recent years, but this was like the beginning of peak era for it. I live for it, I think it‚Äôs amazing

**sydschoon** (6.407): If the first 3 tracks were cut and this album started at track 4, it would have been much better imo. I‚Äôm an Ari stan but because of the duds in the beginning it greatly changes my opinion on the whole record.

**fadedblue09** (6.167): This is my second favorite Ari album and while I commend her for being able to openly express her traumas musically, there's a part of me that resents this album. I'm glad she got praise for her work, but it looks like she took it the wrong way. This album paved the way for the likes of Thank U Next and Positions, which showed that Ariana can literally release any sort of half-assery and everyone would eat it up. I hope I'm wrong though.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.000): Well Ariana has a huge advantage in this rate to me, cause hers is the only voice I actually like, and yet‚Ä¶ well to put it bluntly, this album sounds cheap. I've never heard worse production on an album buy a supposed main pop girl‚Ä¶ There are great songs here, but the fact that they're floating in a sea of sparse, basic Pharrell throwaway tracks just makes the experience that much more unpleasant. I will never understand people that say this is better than Thank U Next like seriously‚Ä¶

**pig-serpent** (5.800): A synthetic light and breezy album.  When it works it has some high quality pop songs that remind you why Ariana Grande has such a huge fanbase.  When it doesn't, it's one of the most boring albums I've heard in a while.

**IIIHenryIII** (5.700): I thought I liked this better. I still think it‚Äôs a great album, but there are some tracks that don't work here. The Pharrel songs are top-notch though.

**Around-town** (5.533): Meh

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.107): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tNQAxTvou8

**Treecoh** (3.067): Easily Ari's worst album in her discography. The upside down aesthetic with the blackfishing combined with this quality of music was certainly an era.

TiltControls: Great job ricki, followingfreeways, and nooodisaster! Sad I had to miss the reveal this weekend but it looks like it was fun (well for Ariana fans anyways)

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) have been updated!

## Songs

Though it may have been predictable, there was no doubt that it was deserved. Congrats to **No Tears Left To Cry** for a dominating rate win against ~~the other Ariana songs~~ the competitors.

* With a 9.196, **No Tears Left To Cry** becomes the **201st** highest rated song across the sub
 * It sits just below My Chemical Romance's Welcome to the Black Parade (200th) and just above Tyler The Creator's I THINK (202nd)

## Artists

All 3 artists have been rated numerous times before, so despite some wild scores fluctuations their averages haven't changed all that much.

* 212th: Hayley Kiyoko / 2NE1 (7.371)
* **214th: Ariana Grande (7.369) [PREV 224th]**
* 215th: Camila Cabello (7.359)

-

* 269th: Raven-Symon√© (7.107)
* **270th: Demi Lovato (7.106) [PREV 257th]**
* 271st: Hailee Steinfeld (7.102)

-

* 308th: Ed Sheeran (6.835)
* **309th: Selena Gomez (6.831) [PREV 296th]**
* 310th: B.o.B. (6.829)


-

**Featured artist changes:**

* **Kid Cudi**: 35th -> 80th
* **Missy Elliott**: 88th -> 104th
* **Pharrell Williams**: 284th -> 284th
* **Nicki Minaj**: 286th -> 286th

**Other Artist Stats**

* **Ariana Grande** takes the undisputed lead for most rate appearances. This is her 22nd rate that she's been in.
 * Her previous ties at 21, Beyonce ([2022 Ultimate](https://redd.it/10rwgnh) - open now!) and The Weeknd (2022 Men's Ultimate) will catch up in the next few months
* With the addition of Sweetener to her rate repertoire, **Ariana** moves up from 9th to have the 3rd most rated songs (not unique) across Popheads rates. With 105 ratings she only sits behind Taylor and Carly on the leaderboards
 * **Demi Lovato** also takes a new space on the leaderboard in 22nd with 59 songs. They tie with Paramore for this stat
 * **Selena Gomez** is not on the list due to the separation of her and her scene, but if they were combined she'd be tied for 15th with Miley at 68 songs
* **Ariana** also now has the 3rd most 11s across her ratings, rising from her previous spot of 6th. Again she sits behind only Taylor and Carly on the board 
* With her 4th rate loss, **Selena Gomez** joins Halsey in a tie to become the artist that has lost the 2nd most amount of rates on the sub (including her work with Selena Gomez & The Scene). 
 * Still holding the record strong is Madonna, who has been in 6 album rates and has somehow managed to be the first song out in 5 of them (only her self-titled debut has escaped this fate).
* Half owing to an... interesting selection of tracks on Rare and also a forgetful rate statistician giving her the credit she was owed for her smash BLACKPINK collab 'ICE CREAM', **Selena Gomez** now has a spot on the 'most 0's leaderboard' in 9th with 93. (Including her songs with the scene would put her in 6th)
* By picking up a single 0 on 'A Sweeter Place', **Kid Cudi** is no longer on the no artist 0's leaderboard
* **Nicki Minaj** takes back her record for 'most rates without a win' at 21 in total. Previously she was tied with Charli XCX (still at 20), who will rejoin Nicki in this stat with All Stars 6 next weekend unless she pulls out a win with any of her 3 tracks there.

## Albums

Due to albums only being recognized with the most common tracklists, some of Selena's extra singles were left off this stat (Fetish, Bad Liar, and Back to You). Deluxe issues can be iffy at times, but usually if we rate the full collection (as we did for TMYLM and Rare), they are fair game for inclusion.

Averages are out of 368 albums rated.

* 179th: Carly Rae Jepsen - EMOTION (7.583) [Original Rate]
* **180th: Ariana Grande - sweetener (7.579)**
* 181st: Paramore - RIOT! / Demi Lovato - Don't Forget (7.578)

-

* 338th: Christina Aguilera - Bionic (6.829)
* **339th: Demi Lovato - Tell Me You Love Me (6.828)**
* 340th: Fifth Harmony - 7/27 (6.822)

-

* 354th: Twenty One Pilots - Blurryface (6.666)
* **355th: Selena Gomez - Rare (6.650)**
* 356th: Selena Gomez & The Scene - Kiss & Tell (6.634)

-

**Other album stats**

* **Rare** becomes the 15th lowest rated album on the sub. With the new addition Ava Max - Heaven and Hell is knocked off the lowest list.
* By picking up 61.4% of the 11's in the rate, **sweetener** becomes the 3rd most dominant album for album 11s in a rate. It is only beaten by the classics: Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (64.3%) and One Direction - FOUR (65.8%)

## Rates

* **Ariana's** performance in this rate becomes the 7th time that an artist has swept the top 3 spots or higher! Ariana also becomes the first artist to accomplish this task twice (she claimed the top 3 of Red vs. My Everything vs. Kiss with Love Me Harder, One Last Time and Break Free
 * Other top 3 sweepers include Lady Gaga (The Fame Monster), Arctic Monkeys (AM), Red Velvet (K-Pop GG Singles), and Tyler, the Creator (IGOR)
 * Paramore (Brand New Eyes) is still the only artist to manage a top 4 sweep
