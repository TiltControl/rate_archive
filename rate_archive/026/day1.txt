#hey y'all, this is a live placement of the songs as they go out, for the people who don't have access to plug rn :)

e: this would be a good time to promo my rate :) so here's my overwatch rate! two days left to submit, and it can be done in like 10 minutes. if you don't play, you can rate based on the full writeups i provided, or just their looks (i have 3 skins for each displayed, or an imgur album of the default skins of all 25 characters) https://www.reddit.com/r/geekheads/comments/6qr0ro/rate_overwatch_characters_rate_reveal_accessible/
