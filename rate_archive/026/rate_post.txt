##\/r/popheads Fantasy Eurovision: Pt. II!

Hopefully you know the drill! I'm back with /u/berober04 to present the second \/r/popheads Fantasy Eurovision of 2017. Hopefully, it'll be bigger and better than ever! For those of you who didn't attend the previous Fantasy Eurovision, I'll be reintroducing it in this handy lil' post.

Everyone who applies will be assigned a country - based upon your top-three preferences - and you will be tasked with finding the song that will represent you in our Fantasy Eurovision. We'll have two plug.dj reveals, too! One for the announcement of the songs (this is when voting will begin, too) - and another reveal for the final results.

###How do I apply?

 * **Country 1:** *The country** *that you want the most.*
 * **Country 2:** *Your second preference.*
 * **Country 3:** *Your third preference.*

**Note:** No preferences? No problem! Don't include them, and we'll assign you a country at random.

\* - you may choose any country that participated in the [Kyiv Eurovision 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2017#Participating_countries).

###What happens next?

On ~August 7th, you will be contacted via Reddit PM with the country that you have been assigned. After that, you will start your search for the song that will represent your nation! Please note that the preferences are just that - preferences. We cannot guarantee that you will get your first pick, or any of them. After we have looked at the applicants' preferences, we decide based on random number generators, in order to make it fair. 

We will post rules and regulations for song choices on the same day as you receive your assigned nation.
