kappyko: AAAAAAAAAAAAA I WON

if anybody needs to know any songs for sweden, hmu! it was definitely awesome to win on my first try, especially against the top two from last eurovision (much love to /u/MashLuke and /u/Jelboo!) the top 10 was full of excellent songs!

a big thanks to /u/Kaphox and /u/berober04 for hosting this again; using the rate format was definitely a cool move, and led to a lot more intense messiness! yall did excellent this time, and the amount of work put into this was fantastic!

a big thanks to Julia Vero, who's a fantastic artist that i can't seem to find anywhere else, unfortunately. hopefully she's still out there making music!

shout out to all the other fantastic countries as well!

next time(?) i'll go for something riskier, like a guy, or a foreign laguage track, or a rock song. maybe i'll still win! :P hahah who knows. much love to yall again <3

MashLuke: I'm not going to lie, this time it was way more intense! First place last time, second place this time, I can't say I'm not satisfied because I absolutely am. Congrats to u/kappyko for his victory and to u/Jelboo for being a threat and choosing a good song once again!
