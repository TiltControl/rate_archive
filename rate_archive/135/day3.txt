Tadevos: Whenever Indieheads does a rate, malevolent forces conspire and the sub comes dangerously close to crowning Guns 'n' Roses' "Paradise City" at the top of every single rate, no matter how inapporpriate it is to the theme or even regardless of whether or not it was even in the running.  (It never is.)  Fortunately the rate hosts get wise to it and manage to post the actual #1 song, but not before mysterious mechanisms post a reveal comment for Paradise City, wherein everyone who participates in the rate is shown, scurrilously, scandalously, to have given a hair-metal song from the 80s their 10s and 11s.  It's all in good fun tho we love our local malevolent forces

**flavasavavandal** (10): If the structure of the first half of this song just continued for an hour, I would not even complain. It is so addictively chill to listen to that I just want it to go on and on. Even if I equally love the switch up to Stevie’s deeper voice in the second half in a moment that feels like Stevie asking people to come together and shame the fuck out of Richard Nixon. But some people didn’t think so and this song barely makes day 3. I guess there were a few Nixon stans sabotaging this track /s

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): Richard Nixon doesn't care about black people

---

## Fuck Nixon

**2dina3dworld** (10): doing pol sci has made me realise that I fucking hate politicians.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Honestly ended white male capitalists with this.

**akanewasright** (10): FUCK Nixon!!!!

**bbfan132** (10): this outro <3 <3 <3

**kappyko** (10): FUCK RICHARD NIXON!!!!!!! Did you know this is the B-side to Sir Duke? That means it hopefully gets a spot at #3 :D

**MadJohnBeard** (10): the chillest vibe and a giant f-you to you-know-who, what's not to love about this

**MorrisFae** (10): My favorite diss tracks are the ones that are calm, relaxed, assured, and absolutely vicious. From Mariah Carey to Pet Shop Boys, there are really strong ones, but this is the one that broke the mold. With vocals reminiscent of Steely Dan over a beautifully tender melody, Wonder mercilessly tears Richard Nixon to shreds. There's a playfulness to the arrangement, but an edge that betrays the intense emotions that went behind these lyrics, perfect piece of music.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Stevie really said I’m about to end this man’s whole career

**soggy\_charge9447** (10): so catchy I hate Nixon now

**TiltControls** (10): Underrated track, but also a really fun way to close the album

**apatel27** (9.5): The second half tho

**seanderlust** (9.2): the dear mr. president of the 70s. imagine how big of a dick (pun intended) you have to be to warrant a diss track from stevie wonder. that said, this has to be the classiest diss track i've ever heard

**freeofblasphemy** (9): Those growls are so good

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Nixon was an Alessia Cara fan? Maybe Watergate was good actually

**jsonphile** (9): dang Stevie wrote a song about that annoying twat on the Polar Express years before that movie came out

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): Really lovely last track

**runaway3212** (9): an amazing closer

**Smuckles** (9): Stevie Wonder 4 President. I am probably half joking.

**vayyiqra** (9): Yeah fuck Nixon. He did some good stuff at first (the EPA for example) and could've been remembered as an alright president, but ruined any chance at that by being a corrupt scumbag who was also pretty racist and he illegally bombed Cambodia which led to the rise of the incredibly evil Khmer Rouge regime. Also, fuck LBJ while we're here; his domestic polices were fairly good for the time but morally he wasn't much better than Nixon, especially when it came to the Vietnam War which he ramped up considerably and he did a lot of other shady stuff like spying on MLK. Both awful human beings.

**waluigiest** (9): yeah I also would have resigned after this

**welcome2thejam** (9): Well if you're gonna write a "Fuck Nixon" song, best if you make it an irresistible bop worth spinning

**jman457** (8.7): A good conclusion that brings the album full circles

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): Elizabeth Holmes tees

**celladonn** (8.5): I think You Haven't Done Nothin' is the better Nixon diss track but this is good too

**CrimsonROSET** (8): jack antanixoff

**ImADudeDuh** (8): wtf how does stevie wonder and kelly clarkson know the same person?

**qazz23** (8): sounds happy and bouncy, like how it picks up at the end

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): well he thinks he knows it all, but he don’t know a thing at all, and it’s something y’all… misstra bring me down, well ya love to bring me down

## Nixon stans

**babadork** (7.5): While there isn’t anything wrong with this song, it is a very tame insult to Richard Nixon. Even other Republican politicians delivered harsher insults. His other anti-Nixon protest song, “You Haven’t Done Nothin,’” which he released the next year, totally overshadows this one.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Great closer! But that switch up in the vocal caught me soo off guard.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.4): we love a nicely sung diss track against Nixon

**Blisterman** (6): It was probably quite a bold stance to explicitly criticise a politician in the 70s. But it’s not really interesting otherwise.

**Tadevos** (6): This is like the longest fade-out I’ve ever heard. I suppose that if you dig the song it’s a neat trick, but it’s not for me.

## They got confused but their heart is in the right place (stream The Turning Wheel for better Spellling) 

**Roxieloxie** (11): FUCK YOU REEGAN . God I cant resist a good 'fuck politicians' song. I dont think this is gonna be a good choice for an 11, but this is so good and Its underrated. That I just have to, Coming into the rate i didnt expect to give my 11 to a song i didnt previously know especially when the songs i do know are so good, but this feels right

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Something about this beat and groove reminds me of DC go-go. Those songs tend to last like 40 minutes so I WISH this was forty minutes!! (Rare Essence if you're reading this, plz cover it thank u. At least Fishbone has already covered it!) Curtis, not even a character in the movie, winds up being the most sympathetic to Freddie. He sees that he's not alone in his suffering; as black people are disproportionately under-served while, again, Curtis references people getting sent up to the moon (still relevant to this day, oof). The lyrics are gorgeous and dark, yet the music kinda just makes me wanna two-step for forty minutes (again, Rare Essence wya)

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): Watching Super Fly (film), it was really funny hearing the instrumental of this song pop up since after Freddie dies nothing really happens to commemorate him, Curtis made an entire song, and then released said song as the lead single, about a character the film didn’t even care about, and then used this song as the theme to the film. Curtis sees Freddie emblematic of a lot of victims of drug abuse and poverty, and tunnels all his frustration, pain and grief into his voice, and it works pretty damn well. Curtis also calls out the fact that America is seen as a land of progress with the moon landing still being fresh in everyone’s memory while so many of its inhabitants can barely survive in the city, fulfilling a dream of the space race while leaving people like Freddie left in reality to fend for themselves

---

## Mourned Freddie’s death more than the movie did

**celladonn** (11): The fantastic lyrics, that funky beat, those gorgeous strings... incredible track

**akanewasright** (10): is it insensitive if I say this makes me want to dance like the woman in the titty gif?

**bbfan132** (10): idk what to say other than “this is a 10”

**bo_g_o** (10): do NOT do drugs

**fadedblue09** (10): Really catchy instrumental, love the contrast between its upbeatness and dark subject matter

**MorrisFae** (10): A beautiful lament turned cautionary tale. Equal parts tragedy and derision, mournfulness and expectation. The song wheels wildly between contemplative and carefree, there's a feeling of "we've mourned our dead, we'll try to pass the lesson on, but what else can we do?"

**Own-Photograph-4642** (10): What's up Smokey?!?!

**qazz23** (10): absolutely infectious, love the strings and flute

**seanderlust** (10): I think why this works so well especially being featured immediately after pusherman is that curtis takes such a sympathetic look at both the dealer and the user. it manages to sympathize with the user without overly victimizing him.

**Tadevos** (10): The best thing about “Freddie’s Dead” is that Freddie, in the movie, kind of sucks. He gets no respect—frankly, watching the movie it makes a lot of sense. He’s absolutely not cut out for this life. He doesn’t even die a good death. It’s a miracle that he gets one of the best, loveliest, lushest, most pathos-rich songs of the nineteenseventies.

**TiltControls** (10): well someone tell that to all the nightmare on elm street sequels (sorry I saw the title and wanted to make a dumb joke [on what happens to be one of the most depressing songs in the rate it seems - hosts if you want to cut it out feel free]). For an actual comment this is a super bleak song (though maybe necessary to get the point across) that really goes all in on the pain. I really don't think there's a track more somber than this in the entire rate and stands out in the best way for it.

**waluigiest** (10): I am OBSESSED. It’s lush and empathetic and tender and relentlessly honest.

**babadork** (9.8): I like that this song uses Freddie as an example of who you do not want to be, but it still is very sympathetic to Freddie and his reasons for dealing drugs. It’s much more sentimental than would be expected from a song with so much wah-wah guitar.

**Roxieloxie** (9.6): Your Shaking your tits, Freddie's dead, and your shaking your tits??

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): ok but what about shaggy? scooby?? daphne?! VELMA?!?!?!

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.3): So good... it hurts?

**austrosinitic** (9): Just falls a little short of being as good as Little Child IMHO but still one of the best movie themes of all time

**BeauMeringue212** (9): the contrast between the lyrics and upbeat instrumental is very jarring but it drives the message home

**FightYaAtThePrody** (9): Fred was a great guy. Hopefully he would have been a Belieber <3

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): oh he passed away? aw. aw. alright-

**jsonphile** (9): George Weasley when people ask where his twin brother is

**kappyko** (9): And then there's chunky

**musical\_pyn** (9): these lyrics and this groove do not match and I love it so much

**welcome2thejam** (9): Shaggy to Scooby when he finds their friend's remains:

**2dina3dworld** (8): from death comes life, I guess. If it works to discourage someone from drugs then I guess it works?

**AHSWeeknd** (8): RIP in peace but that trumpet makes up for the death

**Blisterman** (8): Great song, so I'll forgive it for spoiling the movie. Also Freddie got hit by a car, which is mostly incidental to the fact he’s a junkie.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): d k freddie’s dead

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): this album came out the same year as the last moonwalk in 1972 and I really enjoyed the rockets reference to it, especially while astronomy and the related sciences are different from the social sciences but it is like who gives a shit about space when so many people on earth are so mistreated.

**frogaranaman** (8): why is he dead I don't remember

**Smuckles** (8): It's been over 10 years since I last heard this album in full but all of these groove's are instantly coming back to me.

**vayyiqra** (8): I can't even write a real comment on this. I know too many addicts and it's too upsetting for me. : (

## Ran Fat Freddie over with the car

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): i guess the iCarly reboot took some unexpected turns

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): The Final Nightmare

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I love his voice! This song is so groovy! I already think curtis is my favorite and I'm only three songs in.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): why is this so joyful sounding for a song about someone who died / a junkie

**jman457** (7.3): Kind of weak considering it was a huge hit

**runaway3212** (7): a tad too repetitive

**soggy\_charge9447** (4): just not feelin the instrumental

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Wake up, Rose, time to sing four words repeatedly. Anyway, yes, here we have where Sly ends his 70s Soul Rate journey. For a lot of people, this was a challenging, dense, unwelcoming album. For some, they found a new, groovy gem. I'm in the latter camp, as I've enjoyed Sly's turns of grimness and childlike wonder in simple lyrics and unrelenting groove. I love how TARGO subverts expectations of what a 60's soul singer would do; bold in experimentation and presentation, a big F you to the world. The album has moments of sarcasm, joy, hope and despair, all with some unexpected turns. Well, I'm glad you made it to Day 3 at least, Sly!

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): the big lead single, what is it about? Probably about the divisions of race in America. But it could be about the divisions going on in the band, or it could be about Sly becoming more involved with the Black Panthers. Only one thing was clear, when this song was released to airwaves, the optimism that people knew this band for was dead, something emblematic of the shift from the 60’s to the 70’s

---


## There’s no way Sly is going to get D’Angelo’ed, right?!

**2dina3dworld** (10): I had a comment for this song but then I realized that I was reading lyrics for a different song with the same title

**AHSWeeknd** (10): that iconic drum beat would’ve been replaced with a trap beat if this song was released in 2017-2021

**akanewasright** (10): Please tell me this has at least one 11, it deserves so hard

**bbfan132** (10): that was a classic

**CrimsonROSET** (10): family stuff is very complicated, and the lyricism he uses puts it really well. ‘You can’t leave because your heart is there // but you can’t stay ‘cause you’ve been somewhere else’ is a great way to explain it

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): It's absolutely insane to me that this record had a hit single. But it did! And of course it's great!

**kappyko** (10): really nails a sort of melancholy underneath all of the murky production. thank you Rose Stone

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): The delivery on these lines is incredible

**MadJohnBeard** (10): the song I know the best, there's a vague sense of emptiness despite the family theme

**MorrisFae** (10): To this day, I am utterly baffled that this song hit #1. Not that it isn't a sublime and powerful piece of music, but it's so strange and understated and grimy. There's barely a structure to it, it's led by a strange gurgly and punchy bass riff, Sly sounds like he's barely singing. But I wouldn't change a single thing.

**musical\_pyn** (10): Oh yeah this is really great, just a perfect combination of everything

**qazz23** (10): great vocal performance (11 candidate)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Mary J took notes

**Smuckles** (10): An all-time favourite soul song. That sticky bass sound elevates it.

**waluigiest** (10): this song hits you in waves, and everything is just so cool.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Simply written but well-delivered storytelling

**runaway3212** (9.5): This is what I think succession is like

**TiltControls** (9.5): the most recognizable of the tracks on the album and for good reason. The underlying beat to the song is super infectious and the lyrics are super on point.

**Blisterman** (9): This has 20x as many plays on Spotify as any other track on this album, so I’d imagine quite a few people will only know this one. It is a great song though.

**celladonn** (9): Yass finally an accessible track on this album

**frogaranaman** (9): I'm OD in Paris, I'm OD in France / I thought that I told you I need the advance

**jsonphile** (9): this group knew how to do vocals

**Own-Photograph-4642** (9): An outlier but an important one. The primitive drum machine!

**ReallyCreative** (9): "its a family affair" my weird deadbeat uncle any time something happens at Christmas

**welcome2thejam** (9): Enjoy the vocals, they contrast nicely. There's a real weariness to this one; seeing the backstory, it feels like the bonds are there but they're cracked

**babadork** (8.8): I would have thought this would have been an obvious 10, but I guess not.

**BeauMeringue212** (8.6): Nobody was getting it crunk up on in this dancery anyway

**jman457** (8.1): Cute vocal performance

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): disco

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): I was vibing with it until he did that weird screechy vocal thing again.

**vayyiqra** (8): they actually did it they made bedroom funk into a thing

## Punishment for these people involve listening to There’s a Riot Goin’ On 20 more times

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I’m just going to request Mary J Blige’s song to be played after this

**rickikardashian** (7.8): girly was given 4 words to sing and she made sure to make the most out of them

**freeofblasphemy** (6.5): Not in love with it

**bo_g_o** (6): how many raters are going to mention Mary J Blige in their comments

**Tadevos** (6): This song is almost good enough that I want to sit down and figure out what the fuck it’s supposed to be about.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): Camp

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): The dark horse off of Innervisions? I wasn’t sure how r/popheads were going to react to a latin-infused soul cut that was a minor hit in ‘74. It’s vibrant and infectious. And I assumed Stevie speaking Spanish at the beginning would be considered a little too campy for some users, but it made day 3, it made the top ten, and it managed to beat out the last Sly song. Don’t You Worry ‘Bout A Thing speaks of positivity in the finding someone to stand with against the systemic issues explored on other songs on the albums. And I just love it, such a goofy song that doesn’t overstay its welcome and injects some much life into the album after All In Love Is Fair

---

## Should’ve worried about their 11 more

**CrimsonROSET** (11): this reminds me of going to church and sitting next to my dad playing the drums and i was playing the little egg rattle and living my BEST life

**ignitethephoenix** (11): the fusion with Latin music here is so good, now only if Tori Kelly’s cover did not pop up first when I googled this

**kappyko** (11): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! One of the peaks of popular music of the 1970s imo one of the happiest songs ever written. This rate solely exists for this song. I heard this song because my dad used it in a mix for a family friend's dance at her debut and i've always thought it ripped

**rickikardashian** (11): now which venezuelan was stevie wonder hanging out with

## Not worried 

**2dina3dworld** (10): El Scorcho moment

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The lyrics kinda spilled tbh

**akanewasright** (10): I can’t stop thinking of Ricki hearing this during the listening party, doing a double take, and saying “who taught Stevie Wonder Venezuelan slang?” If this isn’t top 5 we burn the sub

**apatel27** (10): iconic instrumental

**bbfan132** (10): still dancing to this

**cremeebrulee** (10): SMASHA!!!!

**fadedblue09** (10): The instrumentation sounds really festive and uplifting, and the Latin flavors are a nice touch

**ImADudeDuh** (10): stevie didn’t ask to be born latina

**jsonphile** (10): this should be the classic “don’t worry” song, not Bob Marley’s Three Little Birds (which is good but not his best) or Bobby McFerrin’s “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” which I don’t hate but is also not a good showcase of his talents

**MadJohnBeard** (10): AH, AH-AH, AH, AH, AH, AH, AH, AH, AH, OFF YA TRIP

**MorrisFae** (10): the best song that opens with what sounds like a man imitating a squeaky door hinge over a Horace Silver-esque homage to latin piano. Silliness aside, what a beautiful song, I love hearing Stevie harmonize with himself especially on the more carefree "ba ba ba" bits.

**plastichaxan** (10): "they say your style of life is a drag" Me being a drag queen...

**Roxieloxie** (10): This song has one of my favorite intros of all time like genuinely its impossible not to smile listening to this. I love it so much. I really hope this one does well

**vayyiqra** (10): lmao @ the self-deprecating "I speak very very um fluent Spanish" when he had just randomly picked some up from the radio and stuff

**waluigiest** (10): I cannot oversell how happy the chromatic runs make me

**bo_g_o** (9.5): Stevie really said I don't speak spanish but I can if you like

**FightYaAtThePrody** (9): As this is the horniest song on the record I'm giving it a point for each of Stevie's children :)

**frogaranaman** (9): I don't, but I definitely should

**nt96** (9): Chile not the spanish gibberish lol

**qazz23** (9): like the Latin feel and piano

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): I love this song but tbh the Tori Kelly version is better.

**austrosinitic** (8.5): He estado estudiando español desde hace 2019 pero su español es solo un poco más terrible que el mío...sollozo

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): Stevie Wonder tells you it’s gonna be okay and you believe him

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): On my first date (ever) the guy I was with wanted to watch *Hitch* because he said it was one of his favorite movies and I was like “okay” and we watched it, like, on my laptop in my bed… anyways we started making out so I didn’t really get to watch the movie but from what I can gather Will Smith was some sort of pickup artist dating expert and this became relevant later because I ended up dating that guy for a while and he had kinda strange ways of treating me/interacting with me and in retrospect I think it’s probably because of the lessons he learned from that film. This doesn’t really relate to the song I just saw on the writeup that it was in *Hitch* and it made me think of this. The song is cute though.

**jman457** (8.4): I can almost see carrie bradshaw walking down 5th avenue in her Manolo Blahnik’s

**Blisterman** (8): Catchy song, and a free language lesson.

**seanderlust** (8): stevie being corrected on his spanish by the woman in the beginning help. overall this is very fun

**Stryxen** (8): retroactive hispanic art pop rate promo

**welcome2thejam** (8): If nobody got me I know Stevie Wonder got me Can I get an amen?

**babadork** (7.8): It sounds great, but it has to lose some points for introducing adding comedy skits to songs.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): again, didn’t need the skit but this is so smooth

**BeauMeringue212** (7.5): While I like it it's just a little bit Dancing With the Stars

**TiltControls** (7.5): I don't speak Spanish so I'll take Stevie's word for his proficiency

## Worried about Stevie’s spanish skills

**musical\_pyn** (7): second half of this is really strong, before then doesn't really work for me though

**Own-Photograph-4642** (7): Stevie trying to speak Spanish is cringe AF to me but okay song.

**Smuckles** (7): Horny

**Tadevos** (7): This song is bright and colorful and fun and it’d land a point higher if it wasn’t up against both Superfly and What’s Going On. I’m sorry.

**runaway3212** (3): i am worrying I do not enjoy this song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): My baby Syreeta! She randomly came up on my Discover Weekly like 3 years ago, and it's been love at first listen ever since. I implore EVERYONE to listen to the album this is from (self-titled, as Syreeta's girlish vocals here undersell her full, brilliant range. And a lot of the same squelchy, skittering synth patterns all over. Pure bliss!!! Another artist gone too soon, rest in peace <3

**flavasavavandal** (10): Thank you darj for putting Syreeta on my radar

## Loves every little thing about this song

**babadork** (10): People sleeping on Syreeta Wright in the 70s is some sexist bullshit.

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): Her voice is soo good.

**Roxieloxie** (10): I think this might be one of my favorite discoveries from this rate, i want to 11 this its so 🥰

**nt96** (9.5): I don’t.

**freeofblasphemy** (9): Wow can’t believe I’ve never heard this before

**qazz23** (9): sweet vocals and funky rhythms

**welcome2thejam** (9): Definitely one of the more interesting soundscapes of the rate

**CrimsonROSET** (8): could not relate <3

**vayyiqra** (8): Why did this make me think of Ariana Grande's early music

## I Hate Every Little Thing About You

**jman457** (7.9): c’mon vocals!

**AHSWeeknd** (7): the consistent repetition of “I Love” keeps me on edge for some reason.

**Smuckles** (7): Another super cool beat.

**seanderlust** (4.5): I wish I felt stronger about this. it's sweet enough it's just...kind of boring sorry. plus i don't really like the stomach gurgling sound effect in the bg at times

Tadevos: The popheads may be intrigued to know that Indieheads darling and/or whipping boy Will Toledo of Car Seat Headrest took to interpolating "Don't You Worry Bout A Thing" in his live shows around the second *Twin Fantasy,* which mostly meant singing the titular hook on top of the last minute or so of the band's [mashup of their own "Sober To Death" with Neil Young's "Powderfinger."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chBQgv7b1Pc)  Do with this information what you will.

**qazz23** (10): Another disco classic, love the guitar licks and multiple vocals

**welcome2thejam** (10): Love disco & dance songs like this, in this case it does exactly what it says on the tin. Puts me in a trance and I get lost in music

**kappyko** (9): a GOOD album

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): Absolutely the type of music to get blissfully lost, in for a while at least

**jman457** (8.6): DiScO!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Another song dealing with heavy topics (avoiding drugs) that makes me want to two-step. The lyrics are so uplifting, and the phrase "My life's a natural high" is so wholesome and beautiful to me. A lot of commentary from raters do point out this miraculously manages to be uplifting and anti-drug without being corny. You hear the temptations Curtis may deal with of drugs and dealers, but his defiance against that is what makes this song such a joy to me.

**flavasavavandal** (10): the best anti-drug psa song of all time. Glittering keys about the ecstasy and highs of not getting high, of not making profit for a pusherman. It’s just got an infectious vibe and we kinda stan

---

## Scores a natural high

**MadJohnBeard** (11): can't imagine not feeling good to this song, it deserves an 11

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “(Cocaine Song)” should be used a lot more in the industry. The Weeknd’s discography would be packed with it but still.

**babadork** (10): Why is this song not the official soundtrack to all anti-drug Public Service Announcements?

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): This could easily be a cheesy mess of a song but Mayfield really manages to pull it off.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): the intro feels very Will Rogers “never met a man I didn’t like” but also don’t do drugs kids!

**kappyko** (10): Utterly gorgeous for a song about cocaine lmao

**musical\_pyn** (10): I'm sorry I find it so funny that a song called "Cocaine Song" is one of the tracks that raises my mood the most in this rate

**Own-Photograph-4642** (10): The best song about resisting drugs ever.

**plastichaxan** (10): i think this song just encompasses every single detail i enjoyed about the rate

**ReallyCreative** (10): did not expect to so readily give this song a 10 based on its title

**seanderlust** (10): I grew up in the 90s in America during the height of the D.A.R.E. program. it would be very easy for this ~high on life~ message to come across as corny, but surprisingly it doesn't! it actually kind of feels like a good argument for sobriety. idk if it's the anti-authoritarian spin on it or just the fact that it's curtis' silky voice over lush instrumentals, but either way it is working

**skargardin** (10): We LOVE a sax solo!!

**Stryxen** (10): i’m trying to read the lyrics and analysis on genius dot com and this fucking ashnikko interview video won’t stop popping up she’s making this IMPOSSIBLE. Curtis sweetie take a 10 for your trouble

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): iconic

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.6): I love how joyful this one is

**celladonn** (9.5): Really lovely anti-drug song, the instrumental is so good and the hook is so catchy

**Tadevos** (9.5): A touch saccharine, honestly, but the sentiment is spectacular. Like, so much of the album deals in this conflict between whether or not acquiring social cachet by dealing drugs is worthwhile, and the difficulty of trying to get over when the Man is in the room, but this song is just about how good it feels to feel good sometimes. Its exuberance is so much less complicated and it’s sweeter for that.

**austrosinitic** (9): Out of every work of art about drugs specifically intended to put people off them this and Black Cat by Janet Jackson are probably the only ones that aren't completely tacky shit, that hook IS a natural high of its own class

**bbfan132** (9): :listening:

**CrimsonROSET** (9): curtis you already had one drug song this album why do you get two you need to share

**freeofblasphemy** (9): This next song is about drugs

**jman457** (9): A great little message with nice juxtaposition between the chorus and the verse

**MorrisFae** (9): The real hero in this song, to me, is that beautiful piano riff that comes in around 2:40 or so.

**Smuckles** (9): That sax hook is good enough that I'll excuse the intro.

**vayyiqra** (9): Yeah have to agree this song could've been ended up being incredibly corny with its "say no to drugs, I get high on mountains" kind of messaging but also the opening verse is great and the lyrics aren't wrong, cocaine is pretty terrible. (Though I don't like that he referred to drug users as "weaker" but whatever, not everything in a rate of old albums will age perfectly.)

**jsonphile** (8.5): sorry Eric Clapton Curtis beat you for the best 70s cocaine song

**TiltControls** (8.5): The track does a great job providing a hint of optimism compared to the stark reality of some of the other tracks on the album. Still, there's an element of underlying pain to the track that fits in well with the themes of the rest of the album.

**fadedblue09** (8): The instrumentals here really paint a picture of bliss

**runaway3212** (8): cocaine is overrated I prefer alcohol

**welcome2thejam** (8): Even the anti-drug PSAs sound great in this rate!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Why is it called cocaine song? Am I missing something or just dumb...

## “I can quit coke anytime I want”

**Blisterman** (7): There's something moving and bittersweet about how earnestly Mayfield clearly wants to help inspire his people to a better life.

**frogaranaman** (7): my coke song is Good Girls Go Bad

**soggy\_charge9447** (7): taking a fat bong rip and wishing I was Curtis Mayfield

## NICE

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): not gonna lie i thought the title “cocaine song” meant this would be weirder and more exciting instead of just a pleasantly normal soul song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): A perfect ending to this album. Cool, funky recap of the movie. Again, Youngblood is a drug dealer but he's got "a mind of his own", trying to escape his circumstances. Happy that Curtis is in the Top 10!

**flavasavavandal** (10): See Marvin this is how you mix a guiro

---

## Super Fly

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): It’s just a transcendent banger. Even if you don’t know this song, you probably know a song that sampled it and embedded it in your brain. For most people it’s Biggie, but for me it was Tilt Ya Head Back by Nelly feat. Christina Aguilera :daisybop:

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is like a soul satisfying bop. I’m not talking about the genre, I’m talking about real souls.

**bbfan132** (10): classic!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): of course the song after i make a comment about the songs not really going anywhere instrumentally i’m proven wrong! What the fuck! Where was this the rest of the album!

**fadedblue09** (10): It's like I'm watching a movie while I'm listening to this

**frogaranaman** (10): itches a certain part of my brain in a Great way

**ImADudeDuh** (10): classique

**kappyko** (10): It's The Title Track To Curtis Mayfield's Superfly There's Only So Much I Can Say

**MorrisFae** (10): We get a similar cadence to Pusherman here, certainly a call back. What a beautiful and timeless theme song to a landmark film. This song basically boils down everything that makes the album work into one tight package.

**ReallyCreative** (10): an 11 competitor

**Roxieloxie** (10): i have 57 until this rate is due but i just discovered how good this is??? do i make this my 11???

**TiltControls** (10): Great way to end the album. I know there's been a ton of focus on the lyrics for my comments, but this song could be another instrumental and I'd still probably give it a 10 - it's that good. (Luckily it does still have lyrics and they are also an amazing close to the album)

**vayyiqra** (10): :sunglasses: I have nothing to add here but this is such a fun song and great ending to the album's narrative.

**babadork** (9.5): Before I started rating, I thought this would be an obvious 10, but it really doesn’t compare to how great some of the other songs on this album are.

**cremeebrulee** (9.4): how many guiros are in this rate omfg

**akanewasright** (9): TITTY GIF

**freeofblasphemy** (9): This bassline is in fact the coolest thing in existence

**qazz23** (9): I like the chorus and horns

**runaway3212** (9): this is a slay but not really the slay

**Smuckles** (9): What do I even say about Superfly? I'm at a loss.

**Tadevos** (9): I have nothing smart to say about this song. I think it goes off. It’s fresh; it’s funky. I know that drugs are bad but Youngblood Priest can do karate and that’s sick as shit

**welcome2thejam** (9): Oh shit it's this song? Hear it all the time in 70s retrospectives or when they're trying to set a scene with themes similar to the ones from this film. Understandable, an undeniable bop

**Stryxen** (8.5): it’s not really anything special for the finale of the album but it summarises the stories well and it’s just a bit of a bop lets be honest

**jman457** (8.1): Great for the main character syndrome

**Blisterman** (8): It's an interesting choice to save the title track for last. But it ends the album on a high.

**MadJohnBeard** (8): breezy closing track, another great bass line

**waluigiest** (8): the groove is prime

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): that drum again! Pump it into my veins!

## The Only Game You Know Is Die

**musical\_pyn** (7): After other songs in this rate I guess I was expecting something more, but this is still so good

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Not my favorite track, but it's still really good!

bigbigbee: I think this is partially a function of the music being genuinely great, but also partially a function of popheads in general being pretty high raters (compared to indieheads at least). 

Also, this genre isn't super familiar to me (and I would guess the same is true of a fair number of people who did this rate). In rates like these, I find that it doesn't feel right to give songs REALLY low scores, the way I would with a song that I actively don't like in a genre that I know well.

**flavasavavandal** (11): Kinda sad to see it go, was pretty much in contention for top 5 until the last few days when all those extensions came through and seeing my 11 and Darj’s trade places was sad to watch. But like, this song is perfect. The atmosphere is perfect, the drama from those DUH DUH DUH’s ”is exquisite before releasing with the strings. The stories of people who have been bullied and oppressed by poverty and corrupt racist systems to the point where they don’t even want to be loved, getting caught up in cycles of addiction and self-hatred. I just love this song so much. Such a worthy 11. Sad to see I was only one of two who agreed, sad to see it robbed :(

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): A recurring theme of what I like from these songs, and a lot of songs, is DRAMA. And boy, does Curtis deliver at the beginning track! You have the strings punctuating the measures, a saxophone solo, and an enticing organ vamp. You're there on this journey every measure. And Curtis' falsetto opens up the exposition of the movie without you feeling like you're missing out on anything. The child in question is neglected by his own country, and the surrounding story helps you set up the world where Youngblood exists in. Beautiful, mwah!

---

## Hypno I Love You - Flava

**RandomHypnotica** (11): what an exquisite 5 minutes of music

## The rest of you are trash

**2dina3dworld** (10): it always saddens me how kids get caught up in bad situations. I have family who have had their kids taken off of them because they were caught doing meth and running in certain circles - all I can think of when it comes to that is how terrifying and traumatic that all of that must have been to the kids, and how the support systems here are so lacking that they won’t have the chance to heal before they’re pushed out into the adult world and expected to just “be an adult and move on” when really, it’s not that easy. What happens to you as a kid sticks you for life.

**babadork** (10): There is so much going on in this song, but it doesn’t feel as dense as it is. I especially like the use of the harp and strings.

**bbfan132** (10): what an intro

**MorrisFae** (10): Right off the bat you know you're in for a more cinematic experience. There's a grittiness and edge to this album that Innervisions and What's Going On lack (not that they need it). But we come out of the gate with grimy bass, horns higher in the mix, and the drug haze this album commands so perfectly. The strings don't soothe or uplift, they jab and attack, the horns don't blend, they take over, the bass isn't content to hang in the background, it burbles threateningly to the top of the mix; this song is all coherence through combat.

**musical\_pyn** (10): Now this is an opening!! The textures on this track from the percussion to the horns are nothing short of incredible

**plastichaxan** (10): this intro is mindblowing omg

**Roxieloxie** (10): the sax,,,

**runaway3212** (10): this being the whole slay and the cherry on top

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Sweeping, cinematic, full of empathy and pain

**seanderlust** (10): these are possibly my favorite lyrics in the rate. curtis says so much with 32 words per verse or so

**Stryxen** (10): the DRAMA of this wow it sets the scene so well and perfectly opens the album

**austrosinitic** (9.5): God I love that the bitterness of this song is not only made evident in the music here but just turned into a really grand exposition piece thanks to the cinematic accompaniment and arrangement, really the greatest strength of this album as a whole IMO

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Very unique and memorable instrumentation. Feels like an intro to a Western neo-noir film

**TiltControls** (9.5): A great way to set up the album - with this you know it's gonna be a bleak and depressing look into stories of drug abuse. Yay?

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Curtis Mayfield’s voice deserved better mixing but this is still a gem

**Blisterman** (9): Know this one originally from a Ludacris Sample. Just one of the many influences this album has had on Hip-Hop.

**freeofblasphemy** (9): What an opener

**frogaranaman** (9): again the kids are mentioned what is going on this rate

**kappyko** (9): the organ intro is too iconic

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): This one really builds up and blasts off, incredible orchestration

**qazz23** (9): solid opener, love the bass and horns

**vayyiqra** (9): Wondering how many ballots will call this song "cinematic" because it's the introduction to a movie because, well, it is.

**waluigiest** (9): i love the big chorus - I realize it’s not the style of the album but imagine a beltier delivery….. chills

**welcome2thejam** (9): The power of the horns in the chorus are to die for. Instant tone setter for the entire album.

**jman457** (8.6): A great intro to the album

**Tadevos** (8.5): The organ vamp at the start, those huge swoops from the orchestra, the big hits in the chorus? It’s insane how good the arrangements of the album are. The song itself is also good or whatever but

**CrimsonROSET** (8): just where is that child running wildly to you might ask? tune in to find out

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): such a cinematic opener, it feels like I’m about to watch a movie (edit: I have been informed this is a movie soundtrack)

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the instrumental is so good here

**MadJohnBeard** (8): great opening track, my favorite part are the strings

**Smuckles** (8): I wish more movie soundtracks were like this, where it can be enjoyed as a short form album in of itself. Off to a great start.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): The production didn't have to go that hard.

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): i feel like i read somewhere that this was sampled in flashing lights, but now i can't seem to find it. oh well


## Little Child, Shufflin’ Wild

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.5): the intro reminds me of action and especially spy films, I really like his instrumentals (yes I am listening to this on shuffle)

 I love lo-fi hyperbedroom pop funk-country jam bands, I was not fond of this album on first listen, it’s strange, mixed in a way that I hadn’t before. It took a while to get used to and writing about half of the songs did help me overcome my Slyphobia and recognise this album and I have something in common, a deep sense of self-hatred. After that a lot more of the album started clicking for me, the sense of ironic detachment and disillusionment that comes when you realise what you were doing might never have been enough to change a damn thing, the mockery of the increasing segregation of rock music as country-rock bands in the late 60s started to rise, fractures within the band as Sly becomes addicted to cocaine and PCP, and even the realisation that Sly maybe did sell out to make it big, something that haunts him on TARGO. began appreciating the album a lot more. Its haunting mood, voices coming in and out of the mix, its many layers that I feel like I could spend a decade with and still never truly grasp what Sly was going for. Definitely not for every mood, but also definitely a classic.

**FightYaAtThePrody** (9.727): I remember I first heard this record years ago and I had absolutely no idea what was going on. But even though it left me baffled, I still couldn't help feeling intrigued by it. So when this rate gave me an excuse to check the album out again, I was very excited to revisit it again. And it just clicked with me instantly this time around. I have no idea what's changed but now, I'm in complete awe of the record. I can't imagine that there's anything else that really sounds like it. It's amazing that a record that sounds so dark and washed out manages to maintain some sort of groove throughout. The record always seems to be on the verge of being a complete mess but it never quite gets there. Idk, I have many thoughts on the album and most of them are disorganized and scattered. Maybe one day I'll sort them all into an essay or something. For the moment, I'll just say this record is special.

**kappyko** (9.455): 11 i choose to rate the interlude here. In seriousness, this album in conjunction with the others stands out a lot particularly because it's a lot more groove-oriented. Innervisions and What's Going On are much more pop-friendly, and Superfly about as much, but this album is uncompromisingly funk on top of featuring some really out-there production that hasn't really been reproduced much except for, say, Black Messiah? Maybe? Early drum machine programming is >>>> imo

**Own-Photograph-4642** (9.364): Part of me feels bad for loving this album like I do, mainly because it was the start of Sly Stone's downfall into addiction. But if there was ever a record that sss the perfect encapsulation of the end of the Aquarian Age, it's this. Dourness is the main course of the album and despair never lets up; it becomes the air you breathe and all you see. Bell bottom jeans mixed with fallen bricks and strewn paraphernalia in dire streets. The dream turned upside down. Overall 10/10

**soggy\_charge9447** (9.000): Sly’s energy on this album resonates with me unlike any other artist of that time period

**akanewasright** (8.955): all of these albums (superfly aside) have incredibly personal moments, or reflections on sad things going on in the musicians’ lives. TARGO is like… entirely those moments. Sly was very clearly going through it, and like… I mean I hate the argument that negative emotion breeds great art, but I can say I’m eating this shit up. This isn’t my usual taste at all, but it’s very good

**AHSWeeknd** (8.909): I have such an issue with the mixing on most of the tracks. It’s probably done intentionally but I can’t even hear the lyrics. Overall though, it’s a great album, I also wish they would’ve chosen a different cover.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.818): Sly had one of my lowest scores in 60s Soul, but this is a lot more nuanced and compelling take on social issues and personal turmoil. The album is pretty impenetrable at first, but I grew to enjoy the experimentalism. Is it a weird take to say that TARGO is the Throbbing Gristle of 70s Soul? A real Jazz Funk Great!

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.436): I didn't realize this album title was in response to What's Going On, but that just makes this all the more compelling

**TiltControls** (8.409): At first my scores this album were quite a bit lower. Didn't mean I thought it was bad! But when contending with 3 other juggernauts it was hard not to compare between them, and for me I just didn't get the same level of captivation from this album at first. However, this is definitely an album that really relies on context and couple listens to fully enjoy, but when it finally hits it does a fantastic job. I really REALLY recommend watching the Polyphonic video essay cause it really helped provide a ton of context to the album. Though I think it's still (technically) my lowest album average I still would heavily recommend it as it is a great (and important!) listen

**austrosinitic** (8.364): This may not have peaks as high as the other albums (well, except for Africa Talks To You) but it's still very solid; it definitely has some of the most radical politics, as well as some of the most innovative production and genre fusing out of all of them! Makes me really sad to think of how Sly's career ended up with context, but I'm grateful that he was able to create this

**fadedblue09** (8.227): I must say that this is….one of the most unusual albums I have ever heard. Like the others it’s still in the realm of soul and funk, but it also has touches of rock. Lots of wild melodic changes and unusual production choices, but ultimately it all pays off, and somewhat makes up for the occasionally underbaked lyrics.

**MadJohnBeard** (8.182): It's known for having a consistent sense of dread, but that aside it's a still blast to listen through, some variety on the b-side too. Most of the songs are very unique. Great album for record-lovers cause it's a completely individual experience, something I know I'm always looking for

**BeauMeringue212** (8.173): Do not listen to this while drunk otherwise you may experience heavy feelings of impending doom

FlavaSavaVandal: **jsonphile** (8.136): This was definitely the toughest album to get through. Now I knew a little bit about Sly and the Family Stone, through songs like “Dance to the Music” or “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)” that absolutely slap, so I was expecting some bangers here. But this album was just kinda depressing. I see why this title was a response to Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On, because that album is looking at the state of the world but believing there’s still hope for a better future, while this album is just the ramblings of a person beaten down by the cruel world, devoid of hope. It almost hurts to listen to. I don’t see myself coming back to this album much, but I’m glad I listened to it. I’d say it’s an album every music fan should listen to at least once.

**waluigiest** (8.091): I think this is shoegaze.

**Smuckles** (8.000): It's weird calling this the underrated gem of the rate but I guess considering it's opposition it is. This is straight up some of the funkiest stuff going, and it's all carried by that beautiful bass. An album that you can party to or chill to in equal measure.

**2dina3dworld** (7.773): life is a struggle. True, and that’s what There’s a Riot Goin’ On is about. On that front, it hits all the right notes, but compared to the other three albums it flounders a bit as it suffers from filler and some odd musical choices.

**seanderlust** (7.727): okay so this was my lowest score of the four albums and let me explain why. it still got an over-7 score from me because i'm not about to sit here and tell you that it's not a good record - it's a phenomenal record, and arguably the best in the rate if your goal is to put on 70s soul in the background when you don't really want to pay attention to the music - say, with friends. my problem is that i don't think this record is very good for sitting down and dissecting songs and rating them 1-10. it feels like the intention was more to have the hazy vibes of the record wash over you rather than waiting for moments in the music to really grab you. it all sounds very good, but none of it stood out - this record is one long wall of washed-out, drugged-up riffs and for that i'm here for it. compared to the other three records though, this one is kind of the odd man out.

**jman457** (7.700): Production wise this is this best album here, lyrically its much to be desired

**vayyiqra** (7.636): This album is the final boss of this rate, being the last, the longest and also the most experimental album, with the way it's full of more abstract and minimal lyrics and its long and meandering instrumental parts. Which comes with the territory with 70s funk, I know, but still this is a bit more challenging to rate given I'm in a hurry here. Nonetheless! It's fun and I enjoyed it all.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.455): There’s something about the vocals on the album that sounded like a filter that I just couldn’t click with?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.273): my least favorite of the albums in the rate, I get it and I get why it’s here but this is just not my thing

**qazz23** (7.273): a couple of standouts here but drags at times, production is murky

**freeofblasphemy** (7.091): Appreciate its importance but not one I love

**welcome2thejam** (7.091): Least accessible of the four, yes, but there's a really fed-up, uneasy tone to this that makes it stick out even amongst these albums that talk so much about major problems. Benefits really hard from headphones, I've found. A really good album, congrats to Sly and his entire family

**MNREDR** (7.091): My only weakness - experimental music... Again this is one of those albums I wish I had the taste to appreciate. Compared to the Stevie Wonder album I do like the vibes of this one more.

**Blisterman** (6.909): This was actually the first of the albums in this rate I ever bought, but the one I listen to least these days. The energy is all over the place, and there’s too much aimlessness.

**celladonn** (6.818): I'm sure funkheads love this album but it was a little too murky for me to navigate

**bigbigbee** (6.591): This album makes me feel like I ended up hanging around the art students who were way too cool for me.

**CreepyMannequin** (5.455): I’m obsessed with the original “Thank You” but unfortunately this didn’t really grab me.

**bo_g_o** (5.409): I don't know what drugs sly was on when he made this album but don't do them

**Tadevos** (5.136): I’m legit curious why y’all picked this album, because it just doesn’t stand up against the frequently sublime songwriting or production of the others. It sounds small—not in an intimate way, either. It sounds incidental, almost accidental. It’s more interesting than it is good. Like, I’m coming in from r/indieheads, I love lo-fi shit, but that’s because I can look past production to get to the good song underneath. I’m having a lot of trouble making that jump here.

**NotWith10000Men** (4.591): this album is really poorly mixed or something. i feel like i've been turning the volume up for every song and the vocals sound so far away. i hate that this album's score is substantially lower than the other three's but i'm genuinely having a much worse time listening to it :(

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): A bold take on climate change in the early 70s, Marvin was truly ahead of his time. The chorus is so catchy, while Marvin sings with despondency over where all the blue skies are. The lyrics are so vivid and effective.

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): Simultaneously ahead of its time and timeless, and absolutely deserving of a top 6 finish

---

## Cares about Global Warming

**Blisterman** (11): The environmental themes seem almost quaint considering the challenges facing us now. But this is just an amazing song. Gives me goosebumps.

**nt96** (11): Oh goodness, I'm ascending

**2dina3dworld** (10): see, there’s a concept in my culture called “kaitiakitanga” which decrees that every individual has a duty towards the care of the earth. While M x3 focus more on seeing the world around you change, it’s important to note that it didn’t just happen overnight. We are all responsible for the earth and its care, some of us more than others (cough politicians).

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The sax and piano, ugh I love this album.

**akanewasright** (10): I think this is my favorite on the album?

**bbfan132** (10): don’t know what else to say other than “i loved this”… the saxophone in particular is beautiful

**bo_g_o** (10): you know the drill, saxophone solos get 10s

**cremeebrulee** (10): does anyone think global warming is a bad thing? i love marvin gaye. I think he's a really interesting artist.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): stream WALL-E

**jsonphile** (10): huh a song about how mankind is destroying the environment and causing huge damage to our earth nice to know 50 years later it’s still relevant not a damn things changed

**kappyko** (10): my personal fave off this album, the way he delivers "things ain't what they... useeeed to beeee" is [chef's kiss]

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Spectacular. Beautiful. Devestating

**MadJohnBeard** (10): The testament to this album is how it's social messages are basically as relevant as ever - political stuff tends to age easily. Plus, the instrumental outro is maybe the best part of the record!

**MorrisFae** (10): This isn't the longest song or the title track, but this has always been the song that I identified as the center point and thesis to the album. It was so rare for an artist of Gaye's stature to address climate change as explicitly as he is here (at least outside of lip service in an interview or something). And the beautiful yet foreboding angelic voices that fades out? Side A ends absolutely beautifully.

**qazz23** (10): love the sax solo, the ending is soooo good

**ReallyCreative** (10): come on saxophone!!!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): insert proto-Solar Power and/or proto-Plastic Beach joke here

**seanderlust** (10): wow that sounds so bad, so glad none of that is a problem anymore and everything is totally fine ha ha ha ha ha ha (:

**Smuckles** (10): I love the sudden transition from the last track into this. I get this song stuck in my head all the time, an utter earworm.

**Stryxen** (10): this was hanging around the ~7-8 region until i read the lyrics and then the whole song just clicked into place in my head

**Tadevos** (10): Perhaps the greatest rhythm guitar part ever played.

**TiltControls** (10): As someone who has worked (and currently works) with a lot of ocean and environment stuff I can't not give this a 10. Also even if I didn't it'd still be worthy of a 10. In some ways we're doing a lot better compared to the times where concerns about environmentalism were completely thrown away in the name of capitalism (I say as if it's still not happening today in some capacity lol), but we may not be slowing down fast enough. We've got a long way to go and hopefully we can actually get there before we fuck up the Earth beyond recognition

**vayyiqra** (10): Yeah this song speaks for itself. I'm giving it a 10 moreso for the lyrics and how they're depressingly still as relevant today as when they were written. Let's stop! destroying! the planet! that's bad!!

**waluigiest** (10): this is really tough to listen to 50 years later.

**welcome2thejam** (10): That transition! On the topic of environmentalism, gotta say, looking currently at 50-60 degree Midwestern days in December makes that uneasy outro resonate a lot harder than I wish it did

**babadork** (9.5): Despite giving this a very high score, I still feel like I might be underrating this one.

**celladonn** (9): Crazy that 50 years later we're still destroying the planet, hate that for us

**runaway3212** (9): This reminds me of that one erykah badu song

**austrosinitic** (8.5): Props to Marvin; this excellent single was released before (liberal, whitewashed, state-approved) environmentalism became a thing in America and the rest of the world, which makes it blessedly free of the ‘crying Indian commercial’ performative activist junk that’s overtaken most mainstream incarnations of the movement ever since.

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): Yikes! Well things have to better and checks news aw

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): That was so good! Easily my favorite. Something about it is just so good!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): love a good sax

**musical\_pyn** (8): that choir introduced towards the end is one of my favorite parts of the album

**jman457** (7.9): Beautiful outro

## The Agent Orange of raters

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.5): this album is just someone singing slowly to me about how horrible the world is and like thank you I already feel a lot of doomerism. If you’re an American please sign the ACLU’s petition to Save Oak Flat Act to your senators. The brass and chimes are great though.

**FightYaAtThePrody** (6): If I could, I'd give the transition from God Is Love to this a ten.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I love proto-hip hop. Anywho, this is another jam, musically, with lyrics that are some of the most complex storytelling in this whole rate. Curtis took on this Super Fly project not just to narrate the movie, but to add layers of empathy and critique to the drug dealers and addicts seen in the movie. It's best encapsulated with this song, in my opinion. Youngblood seems inviting, alluring and sinister all at once; you see why he runs this neighborhood. But then, Curtis turns it also into a commentary on Youngblood's entrapment in this lifestyle due to systemic oppression; this is who only way to success, as he's a "man of odd circumstance/a victim of ghetto demands." Some incredible lyrics that add to the ambiguity and nuance to this album. I think Curtis was another lesser-known artist in this rate, and I'm really happy that he did quite well at the ending, finishing off within the Top 5.

**flavasavavandal** (9): I mean, I’m mad it beat out my 11. Ok but this song has a groove and momentum that is undeniable and I absolutely get why it placed top 5.

---

## Push(ithigh)erman

**fadedblue09** (11): Really funky and slick, and some topnotch storytelling

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): I don’t think I have anything to add that the writeup the hosts did for this one didn’t already say but I just want to reiterate that Curtis sounds like such a star here

**jackisboredtoday** (11): can’t stop thinking about that Clipse mashup with this song being called Pusha Man… genius

**Stryxen** (11): it’s amazing how curtis portrays so much complexity to a character in one 5 minute song all while making a MASSIVE bop. I’ve never seen this film but i’m rooting for him!

**akanewasright** (10): why are all the songs about the evils of drugs so fun

**apatel27** (10): don't do drugs kids

**babadork** (10): This is the one song on the album that I can’t manage to separate from the movie. It might be because the scene is so memorable. It makes dealing drugs look like a great time but using drugs look goofy and embarrassing. A highlight is the little giggle.

**bbfan132** (10): this is so so good

**bo_g_o** (10): do not do drugs

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): Oh my god they made Pusha-T into a song

**freeofblasphemy** (10): This is how you create a character in a song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Wow this sounds so smooth. Crazy how they make him sound like a villain, victim, and so cool all in one song.

**jman457** (10): Seems to ironically push against the narrative/theme of the film where the drug dealer is actually just a cog in the system rather than against the man

**kappyko** (10): Random Tiktok user: Okay but did anyone else get a little hot when Curtis Mayfield said I'm Your Daddy 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳 (he says "have some coke have some weed" in the smoothest way possible)

**MadJohnBeard** (10): the instrumentation is perfectly hypnotic - based to portray the pusherman as a victim of circumstances as well

**MorrisFae** (10): I want to try to see if I can word what I want to say about the opening stanza correctly. Mayfield is playing a character here and in the vocal performance he manages to give such a 3 dimensional view of this person. We see a man who comes off like he's trying to con you, he comes off like a man projecting a confidence that he doesn't have; however when his vocals descend on "I'm your pusherman" we get a real view of this person. He is confident, he is sinister, he himself is playing a character to lull people into a false sense of safety, he knows if they don't need him now they will. But there's a twist! There's another layer! The sales pitch is made and suddenly we get a break in the armor, we get a view into the pusherman who ultimately regrets his choice but does so to support the people he loves. A defining feature of the album and the film is that it doesn't try to demonize these people, yeah it plays on some stereotypes, but by fleshing them out and giving them depth we see them transform into real people effortlessly.

**qazz23** (10): everything about this is so smooth, great melody and bassline (11 candidate)

**Roxieloxie** (10): i cant give this album all tens i cant give this album all tens i cant give this album all tens i cant give this album all tens i cant gi

**Tadevos** (10): I’ve seen it observed that this is the one song on the record with no strings or horns. There actually *is* a Horns Mix out there somewhere, but it’s actually…worse? The LP version is tight, it’s lean an’ mean, it perfectly hits the ambiguity of Curtis’ subject. “I know I can break it/this life just don’t make it” is heartbreaking.

**TiltControls** (10): the standout on the album for me 100%. The lyrics are amazing, but I also just want to say I absolutely love Curtis's delivery on the track as a whole. There's this surface of breeziness, but also an underlying tone of pain that really pushes (sorry) this song to the next level

**vayyiqra** (10): It's a pretty bold move to make the protagonist of this song a drug dealer but also try to portray him a little sympathetically as someone forced into the drug trade out of a lack of options, while still making it clear it's not a good thing.

**waluigiest** (10): the delivery and the lyrics do an excellent job of painting a picture without any sort of moral judgement on the pusherman

**welcome2thejam** (10): He does such a vivid job painting a picture of someone proud of their success but despondent that this is forced to be their path to it. You could say it captures the duality of Pusherman

**Blisterman** (9): This song is so good, I’ll take whatever he’s offering.

**celladonn** (9): Help I immediately recognized this chorus but I couldn't place where I knew it from, I was convinced it was from a parody of this song on The Simpsons or something? So I spent ages trying to find the Simpsons scene in which it was used (it doesn't exist) only to eventually realize that I actually recognized it from I'm Shady by Eminem. God.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): That falsetto rings true

**ReallyCreative** (9): I think this would be a 10 if it was a little tighter, just don't see the need for this being 5 minutes!

**Smuckles** (9): Ironically I used to smoke weed to this song with some people in uni. Cool dudes!

**soggy\_charge9447** (9): fuckin sick

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): so I’m a very literal person, and genuinely I cannot picture the subject of the song as anything but a HIM-style villain who likes to dress up in various different outfits to force people to take drugs. I know that’s not how the song is meant to be interpreted, and it’s actually supposed to be about how anybody could be a drug dealer but my brain refuses to picture it any other way.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Wait why do I want to twerk to this song 💀

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I am once again wishing this album would’ve been mixed better

**CrimsonROSET** (8): ok THIS one is about drugs I got it right away

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): bopping to a song about a drug dealer

## Is a drug lord

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): guitars are cool

**musical\_pyn** (6): I really like the instrumental here but I don't know if there's enough here for me to like it as much as other songs in this rate

**runaway3212** (6): a tad too repetitive

FlavaSavaVandal: # Curtis Mayfield - Super Fly

---

**Overall Average**: 8.377 **// Average Controversy:** 1.272

---

 Petition to change the name popheads to Curtisheads, Confession time, when TK asked me to host this rate with darj back in October, I had not heard this album yet. So the first thing I did once I received the offer was to stream this album. And from the first note this thing blew my mind. I adored this thing on first listen, the grooves were perfect, Curtis was perfect, the atmosphere was perfect, the drama, the tension, I was hitting myself over never hearing this before. And throughout the past 2 months, this became my favourite of the four, one that I quickly became attached to, one that earned my 11 on the opening track, and one I was worried was going to get so robbed since two heavyweights were here. But Super Fly put up a respectable fight. Putting 4 songs within the top ten is an impressive thing for someone who was rarely discussed on r/popheads but none of those songs were ever in contention for winning. I am glad though that the raters gave Super Fly a chance.

* #5: Pusherman | 9.027 | 640.9
* #7: Little Child Runnin Wild | 8.958 | 636.0
* #8: Superfly | 8.854 | 628.6
* #9: No Thing On Me (Cocaine Song) | 8.707 | 618.2
* #12: Freddie's Dead | 8.585 | 609.5
* #21: Think (Instrumental) | 7.907 | 561.4
* #23: Eddie You Should Know Better | 7.849 | 557.3
* #26: Junkie Chase (Instrumental) | 7.821 | 555.3
* #31: Give Me Your Love (Love Song) | 7.685 | 545.6

**bo_g_o** (9.833): holy shit this album is funky

**kappyko** (9.444): I refuse to spell the album title as Super Fly im sorry. I revisit this album and I always realize the instrumentation is so much more rich than I remember. His debut is full of even more orchestrated stuff (see Miss Black America) but on Superfly he really masters

**AHSWeeknd** (9.444): This album is such a vibe. It works perfectly for the movie (because why wouldn’t it), but on its own it holds up really well.

**FightYaAtThePrody** (9.333): I don't really have anything interesting to say about Superfly. The record just sounds amazing.

**fadedblue09** (9.000): God I enjoyed this album a lot! It may be expected from a soundtrack but this album provides a cinematic experience in a way movie soundtrack albums don’t. Every little detail, from the multi-layered instrumentals to the lyrics, it all really paints a picture of its themes and storylines. Definitely a brilliant execution of the soundtrack album format.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8.944): Although Curtis Mayfield had already put out solo records, this can be seen as a true breakthrough and what a breakthrough! My first exposure to Superfly were through 90s Black Culture, with Freddie's Dead soundtracking a scene from Friday and, of course, the title track being heard in the intro of The Notorious B.I.G's Ready to Die. I didn't hear the full album until years later and I understood its brilliance. I've yet to see the original film however although I am aware of the late 2010s remake (which I will not be seeing). Curtis' finest hour, that is for sure. Overall 9/10

**seanderlust** (8.922): is it controversial to say that this is my favorite record of the rate? i know that the history behind Super Fly and Blaxploitation as a genre is full of The Discourse. as a white person, i don't feel confident speaking to any of that, so i'm just going to let people smarter than myself speak to it and focus on just the music. the music is banger after banger after banger. curtis managed to make music that ties directly to the plot but also makes sense outside of the context of the film (for the most part - eddie's song is a little strange outside of context.) what's going on was probably the most thought-provoking in this rate, but i had a lot of fun listening to this one.

**MNREDR** (8.889): It's always impressive when an artists writes and composes their entire album, especially one of this caliber.

**austrosinitic** (8.778): This ended up becoming my favorite album in the rate!! Some really great funk songs along with the bombtastic boost the production gets for being tied in with a movie really makes for a damn tight record

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.767): Very few soundtracks compare

**Tadevos** (8.611): Funny thing: if you watch the movie, the soundtrack is the only music you hear in the film. There’s almost no incidental music that’s not represented here, even diegetic shit. Curtis Mayfield shows up halfway thru and plays “Cocaine Song” in a nightclub. Once Eddie puts a record on the gramophone and, I think “Pusherman” starts playing. It’s ridiculous. Still, if I had to pick one album to soundtrack my entire life…there are worse choices.

**jman457** (8.478): Baby making music with good lyrics

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.444): This slapped! I didn’t know anything about this album going into it so it was such a pleasant surprise, all of these songs were so good.

**2dina3dworld** (8.444): I read a couple of articles on this album. I see how it’s supposed to represent the cycle of poverty, but part of it lacks a bit of the nuance that is talked about in interviews, as if some of it got lost in translation. The instrumentals themselves are nice. It’s groovy, and funky, and Mayfield’s vocals are like honey.

**TiltControls** (8.444): One of the two albums I was a bit less familiar with coming in, but I really enjoyed it! Average-wise I'm sure the instrumentals will bring it down a bit, but everything on the album is top notch. I do worry a bit that some of the meaning is lost without watching the accompanying film, but maybe it also speaks to how great the album is that it can hold up even without it.

**freeofblasphemy** (8.389): Lags a bit in the middle but still has some incredible songs

**vayyiqra** (8.333): I have to admit I'm pretty new to Curtis' music (though I knew who he is, of course) and blaxploitation is a genre I'm likewise not all that familiar with, but this was a fascinating album with the way it told the story of the movie throughout. Now I'm interested in watching the movie as well.

**celladonn** (8.278): My fave of these albums! I love the storytelling in the lyrics and the cinematic quality of these songs.

**MadJohnBeard** (8.222): Pretty much all the instrumentation on this album is the best of the best - So many different things happening but never overwhelming. I need to find the movie

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8.167): I love his voice and instrumental choices, I think they’re very cool and they’re very much what I associate with the 70s.

**jsonphile** (8.167): So I knew almost nothing about Curtis Mayfield before this rate, but after this? Yeah the dude knows how to make a groove, I might have to check out some of his other work. Don’t have too much to say about this, it’s a solid soundtrack.

**qazz23** (8.000): Starts out amazing, but the second half isn't that compelling aside from the title track

**cremeebrulee** (7.989): candal would be nothing without this OST

**welcome2thejam** (7.889): Haven't watched the film, but a lot of writing in this makes it feel a lot like a musical tbh. Pusherman, Eddie, No Thing on Me... a lot of storytelling, character development, and revealing of feelings directly through the lyrics. Makes it a lot more interesting of a listen for me than I expected.

**Smuckles** (7.778): It had been a long time since I revisited this album and I'm wondering what took me so long! It's a soundtrack so good most people wouldn't know it's a soundtrack, and it's crafted in a way that as an album in it's own right it's incredible too. Absolute classic.

**bigbigbee** (7.667): This album makes me feel like I’m being told a story from the coolest teacher at school. His office is crowded but in a way that feels homey and not chaotic, and he might hand out little trinkets to the people who show interest. He always wears a cool jacket. On anyone else, the jacket would look pretentious at best and unfashionable at worst, but he makes it work.

**Blisterman** (7.111): Some fantastic songs. It struggles a little in being a Soundtrack album as opposed to a standalone album. Great film by the way.

**soggy\_charge9447** (6.222): I understand it’s a soundtrack but it’s just too dramatic for my tastes. Maybe I should watch the movie

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): Do the Legendary 2000s MC's Rate

**flavasavavandal** (8): Ann would not be able to live in Scotland

---

## Supa Dupa (Lipa) Fly

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Ahead of its time tbh

**babadork** (10): If you listen to this song once, you will always remember how Ann Peebles sings the title.

**bbfan132** (10): the rain deserved better in the 90s vh1 rate

**jman457** (10): that guitar is sexy

**nt96** (10): I feel the win. 5, 6, 7. 8, 9, 10.

**qazz23** (10): good horn section and hook

**seanderlust** (10): am i rating this so highly because that's what it deserves or is it getting a missy boost? who knows and frankly who cares, it bops and therefore it's a 10

**Roxieloxie** (9.2): such a banger

**bo_g_o** (9): can't relate, I love rain

**jsonphile** (9): if you think I only know this song from being sampled by Missy Elliot, you’re absolutely correct. But it’s real good on its own

**kappyko** (9): I mean I'm glad it develops beyond it but that first few seconds of like electronic effects and her singing is absolutely enrapturing i just wonder what it would be like with ONLY that idk about anyone else LMAO

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): The way she sings "Rain"

**MorrisFae** (9): The way Ann sings the word "rain" is permanently burned into my brain and I hope it stays that way

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i can’t stand it when he touches me

## I Can’t Stand The Song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I got popheads to rate Betty Davis, my life is complete. Check out her first two albums please! So happy this made 2nd. When I picked this one, I thought Betty's lesser-known status and out-there delivery meant she wouldn't last very long. But overwhelmingly people loved her brash, fearless demeanor, just like I do.

**flavasavavandal** (10): One day I was browsing upon rym, stalking users when I stumbled upon someone who had recently rated Betty Davis’ first album. Now I know Bette Davis and I’m pretty sure she didn’t release an album in the 70’s, and that she was white and had an ‘e’ at the end of her name. So I was kinda intrigued to see who this fake “Bette” was and my god. The raw presence this woman just has behind the mic is just unparalleled. Darj and I were scared how you’d react to something so powerful but for once r/popheads didn’t disappoint and they placed this in a very respectable second place finish even if I was rooting for this to win.

---

## Not like other girls but doesn’t bully other types of girls

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is why Madonna said “Betty Davis, we love you.”

**akanewasright** (10): I- holy fuck

**apatel27** (10): This is an 11

**bbfan132** (10): god this is excellent, love how funky it is

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): Big indiehead energy from Davis here. Just flexing her record collection

**jman457** (10): I can taste the BBQ

**kappyko** (10): four minutes and fifteen seconds of betty davis personally beating the shit out of you with a guitar

**MadJohnBeard** (10): her screams are magnificent - this entire song is just namedropping and I love it

**MorrisFae** (10): Betty's voice is truly something magical. There's so much grit and rage and sensuality in her rasp. There was no compromise to her music and this song is probably the best thesis statement an artist has written.

**qazz23** (10): it's just really funky

**Roxieloxie** (10): I just think black women doing rock

**sarcasticsobs** (10): what the FUCK

**seanderlust** (10): in case you haven't noticed i'm weird. i'm a weirdo. i don't fit in. and i don't want to fit in. have you ever seen me without this stupid hat on? that's weird.

**skargardin** (10): megabop alert!

**Smuckles** (10): This song made me listen to her first 2 albums a hell of a lot (which I'd been meaning to do). Absolute stank. If the first Betty Davis album had made this rate I wouldn't have complained.

**waluigiest** (10): OMG I’m scandalized

**celladonn** (9.5): Love the fierceness in her voice, this is great

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.4): maybe being not like other girls made some points

**CrimsonROSET** (9): bob the drag queen at anything:

**freeofblasphemy** (9): First Betty I’ve heard outside of Nasty Gal. It rules

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.8): This goes so hard

**MC\_Fuzzy** (8): Haven’t heard this before but I dig it more than most of the main rate.

**vayyiqra** (8): My cat's name was Miles Davis true story. He died last year. I miss him.

## I’m not like other girls

**MNREDR** (7.5): Not like the other girls soul artists

**frogaranaman** (7): ah right there's the sample source

**babadork** (6): This makes me want to listen to more Betty Davis, but I don’t think this is the song for me. I’m not sure about referencing Chuck Berry so close to mentioning being sixteen.

## A fan of early British Hard Rock

**bo_g_o** (10): damn this slaps, the riff reminds me of smoke on the water but better

**TiltControls** (8): okay I realize it's nothing similar, but the opening notes remind me of when I took guitar in high school and there was just a room of like 25 kids attempting to (poorly) play the opening of smoke on the water at the same time to practice for one of our tests

**welcome2thejam** (8) We all thought this was Smoke on a Water for a split second, right? Kinda feels like an I'm Not Like Other (x) song, except with a legitimate axe to grind, a sound that actually backs it up, and a shitton of confidence and pride

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I am THRILLED this won the bonus rate! I only listened to the album Come to My Garden about 2 years ago, and was floored by how serene and pastoral it is. And Minnie's voice is tender and transcendent. It's no wonder she's inspired the greats such as Mariah Carey. This song starts off the album, Minnie singing tender questions, only for the song to end of a triumphant crescendo. It's been a huge favorite in the popheads discord, and has a wide gap between itself and second place. Rest in peace, Mille, gone too soon <3

**flavasavavandal** (8): Ok this is hardly my favourite song in the bonus rate, but where the fuck has this voice been in my life.

---

## Les Fleurs Power or Go Listen to Come To My Garden after the reveal

**2dina3dworld** (10): if this was in the main rate, then it’d be an easy 11.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Minnie Riperon’s voice!! They ain’t got vocalists like Minnie anymore.

**bbfan132** (10): i wish i could give this an 11

**celladonn** (10): Um excuse me this is gorgeous, why have I never heard this before now

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh ring the fucking bells bitch

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): Big "greatest song of all time" energy coming from this one

**frogaranaman** (10): it's just a classic is all

**kappyko** (10): Everybody say thank you Charles Stepney! I really like Perfect Angel

**MorrisFae** (10): It's so fun to hear songs like this that had such a deep and intense effect on a completely different genre of music. So many baroque and chamber pop groups owe a debt to Les Fleurs. I hear so much of what made Elephant 6 and its devotees special in this. And if you don't think music peaked with that first angelic choir rise into the chorus? We can't be friends.

**nt96** (10): For those who don't know, this Maya Rudolph's mother. I still process this to this day.

**plastichaxan** (10): the 11 of the rate tbh

**qazz23** (10): (11) this is epic, great voice, great crescendos - best of the bonus tracks

**ReallyCreative** (10): absolutely crushed I can't give this my 11

**TiltControls** (10): this was an 8/10 and then the song just... exploded. I can't give it anything less than a 10 after that

**vayyiqra** (10): Oh this song I know this from somewhere it's gr8

**waluigiest** (10): this goes too hard

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): im balladphobic but this is really pretty

**seanderlust** (9.5): we love hippies

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.1): Epic and hypnotic

**MadJohnBeard** (9): I hear the 60s all over this one!

**BeauMeringue212** (8.7): why does this feel like a Christmas song

**jman457** (8.7): Catchy af

**babadork** (8.5): Minnie Riperton’s voice is unreal.

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): Wish it had a more impactful finish but still great

## Scores 1970 Sly would have given

**ImADudeDuh** (8): we stan mrs. maya rudolph’s mother

**MNREDR** (8): Sometimes I think the whole 'peace love flowers hippies' thing was an exaggeration but this proves it was very real.

**Smuckles** (8): This song makes me do the 'ooo that's lovely' face you make when sipping a nice hot tea. Lovely stuff.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Did not expect that explosion of sound at all! Never would have guessed how epic this song would get, but it's all the better for it

**flavasavavandal** (10): An 11 contender. This song is just a full on bop from start to finish. Kinda surprised it wasn’t more competitive in the rankings because surely y’all love a good bop and Higher Ground is an excellent bop. With its sexy wah wah guitar giving this song some excellent funk, and a positive message of striving to better yourself in a world where it is hard to do so and you’ll always get the chance to try again, as long as you don’t commit true evil. It’s the piece of the album that prevents Innervisions from being a bleak retelling of the world into an album that is ultimately about hope and optimism, that only Stevie and soul could deliver.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.8): What can I say, it's a bop. This song was #1 for a hot minute. Sorry!

---

## Found their highest ground

**1998tweety** (11): bop

**2dina3dworld** (11): look, I’m a slut for alt rock. I know this from RHCP. This is wonderful, and probably benefits from the fact that I knew of a version of it beforehand whereas the rest of the rate I went blind into. But what is an 11 but not to reflect the impact a song has had on you?

**babadork** (11): I so strongly associate this song with a friend that passed away that it was the only option for my 11. He sang it the first day we met, but his energy was also very Stevie Wonder-esque. He was optimistic and made people feel comfortable around him. If this doesn’t make it to the last day, I’m going to pretend this rate never happened.

**bigbigbee** (11): I guess this might be a basic choice, but I can’t even pretend that this was a hard decision. This song enters my whole body when I listen to it, not just my ears or even just my mind.

**qazz23** (11): Everything about this is great, funky and infectious, it's a classic

**runaway3212** (11): I can't believe stevie wonder invented the mount everest

**welcome2thejam** (11): It's the funky banger, baby! Stevie's going for that higher ground, and he's gonna lift you right there with him

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This sort of music influenced Disco, the essence of hope within the beat is such a gem.

**bbfan132** (10): absolute classic [2]

**bo_g_o** (10): Stevie make up your mind, are you too high or do you want to reach a higher ground

**cremeebrulee** (10): bop!

**freeofblasphemy** (10): Love this so much

**frogaranaman** (10): like, the top of a hill?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): me playing doodle jump in 2011

**jsonphile** (10): the other perfect Stevie Wonder song on this list. Also I can’t believe Stevie Wonder wrote a theme song for Obi-Wan Kenobi years before the first Star Wars even came out

**Roxieloxie** (10): OKAY SO I vividly remember the first time I heard this song. I was in 5th grade in this kinda mix of a black history month program/talent show that i had to go to so many rehearsals for despite the fact that I was one of the narrators and I had like 3 lines of dialogue. But there was this kid in my class ( that in hindsight looking back, I pretty sure kinda got bullied cause people thought he was :limpwrist: ) who performed this song with such absolute charisma than what you would expect like a 5'1 11 year old to have. Anyway in the end all of my lines got cut for that performance and i was left with 4 words so oh well

**Smuckles** (10): One of the finest Stevie Wonder bangers, and he's made quite a few.

**TiltControls** (10): The RHCP cover is fun, but nothing will ever beat Stevie's original

**vayyiqra** (10): For a song I've known for years and heard so many times I'm surprised I never noticed the religious themes on it or thought too much about what this song is about. Stevie is literally singing about ascending and I'm for it.

**kappyko** (9.5): honestly this is not my favorite song on the album despite how it might be the most popular but it does rip

**BeauMeringue212** (9): Name another anti war song you can throw ass to... I'll wait

**CrimsonROSET** (9): it’s giving me ‘david bowie releasing blackstar 3 days before dying’

**MorrisFae** (9): weirdly kind of the first straightforward Pop song on here, but still absolutely vital. The layering of the clavinet riffs, the subtle vocal harmonies, we get a song intentionally made to sound loose and fun but played with intense precision! also I like the RHCP version more

**seanderlust** (9): "it's okay that politicians are lying to me because the world is going to end soon :)" is a new take

**waluigiest** (9): funk intensifies

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.5): This goes non-stop

**jman457** (8.3): almost feels like a spiritual for the 1970’s

**fadedblue09** (8): Love the funkiness but I find it lyrically lacking

**MadJohnBeard** (8): i admittedly heard the RHCP version first

**musical\_pyn** (8): this is just really good sonically to listen to, and the lyrics are really motivating without being cheesy

## Gonna have their soul wiped out by god for this

**Tadevos** (7.5): I think this was the first Stevie Wonder song I ever heard, when I was a littl’un. I think I overrate it a little as a result, but also it’s quite good on its own terms, so

**Blisterman** (7): I think I’ve just listened to this one too much to love it as much as I used to.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): The production in this one is so funky!

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): A classic but unfortunately I like, hate blues songs like this. They’re so annoying, it’s an instant turnoff for me.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): What an epic song. Marvin talks of the perils black people face in the city, how he just wants to give up. He speaks to the disenfranchised people suffering while the US Government sends people into space. And at the very end, the piano brings up the title track. I love how cohesive this whole album is, as we're taken through this orchestral journey of issues facing black America as Marvin guides the way.

**flavasavavandal** (10): Where do I even begin with this song. It was an 11 contender. It is the moment in the album where all the frustration on the previous 8 tracks boils over into a subdued anger that makes you realise that Marvin was never asking a question with the title. It’s the point of the album where you can’t just ignore the problems of the world and expect things to be ok because for a lot of people they won’t. It might be the bleakest moment on the album, contrasting with the previous 8 songs and even interpolates the title track at the end giving it a mournful tone that feels like the final holler of an album that was once full of optimism, as the problems of the world just piled too high. Excellent song!

---

## Hollering that this didn’t win

**BeauMeringue212** (11): this is the perfect musical and thematic ending to a really amazing album. The vocals are beautiful

**ImADudeDuh** (11): A song talking about how people are wasting money on flying to space instead of giving money to people who need it here on earth? Also talking about police brutality?? ALSO the economy being bad??? Phew this is far too relevant today

## Beautiful people

**2dina3dworld** (10): fuck capitalism, fuck rising housing prices, and fuck the property hoarding leeches in parliament who refuse to make housing affordable. When the average rent per person is $200 in the capital, and the maximum someone can borrow for student loans is $269, then you know your system is fucked. And it’s not going to get better - Mr. Luxon in the National Party owns seven houses! Do you think he’s going to want to pay capital gains tax on an asset that’s proving to be a massive cashcow? No! Which is why we need to either vote these thieving capitalists out of parliament or take matters into our own hands.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): If anyone ever says “What’s the best album closer” the answer is this masterpiece.

**babadork** (10): Gotta love a political song that goes so specific that it mentions inflation. Overall, this is one of the darkest songs on the album, but individual components are airy and beautiful. Everything about the reworking of “What’s Going On” is brilliant.

**bbfan132** (10): god-tier outro, excellent!!!!

**bo_g_o** (10): go off Marvin

**cremeebrulee** (10): i'm looking at the comments i originally wrote for this song, and i just put marvadelena baye with no other context? uhm ok 2am creme

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh the ending of this song is so simple but it sends me everytime

**frogaranaman** (10): a perfect closer

**jsonphile** (10): can this man please stop making songs that make me feel miserable that very little has changed in the last fifty years

**MadJohnBeard** (10): incredibly visceral song, the percussion/guitar/bass/piano combo is absolutely godly

**MNREDR** (10): Youtube comment time: Who else first heard this on GTA 4?

**MorrisFae** (10): There's so many beautiful touches and flourishes on this song. The triangle tinkles, the string swells that begin around 1:30, the way the entire band can turn the rhythm on a dime without you even noticing. We get another lyric here too addressing rare but important topics: inner city struggles and overpolicing. Too often the white-centric Protest Folk scene of the 60's only went as far as "racism bad" when it came to POC, Gaye goes head on and in depth.

**qazz23** (10): great closer, love the bassline and outro

**ReallyCreative** (10): so close to giving this my 11, it's transcendent

**seanderlust** (10): wow that sounds so bad, so glad none of that is a problem anymore and everything is totally fine ha ha ha ha ha ha (: (yes I just copied this comment from mercy mercy me but ykw it applies)

**skargardin** (10): such an impactful closer, just wow

**Smuckles** (10): The Impression's version of this also is awesome.

**Stryxen** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO is genuinely the best lyric in the rate

**TiltControls** (10): Great start of the album and what an amazing way to end it. It's bleaker than a lot of other songs on the album that have at least a bit of optimism - which I think does a great job of point out how much work needs to be done with the fucked up system both at the time of recording and the (same) one still around to this day.

**vayyiqra** (10): Quite a downer ending for an album with such a positive and idealistic message, but it's like he's acknowledging the harsh reality of the social problems he's been singing about for this whole time and being a little bitter we can't fix them so easily. Pretty understandable.

**welcome2thejam** (10): The previous songs, even at their most distressing, generally have a positive tone under it. All these uplifting songs and messages of unity and change, the sound feels like you you're viewing all these problems at a distance, like you're flying (high in the friendly sky). Inner City Blues drops you right in the middle and forces you to stare at what's really going on.

**austrosinitic** (9.5): Every time this album begins to warm up to me more and more I appreciate how Inner City Blues closes its run. Compared to most of the other tracks its melody and production are definitely the closest to that gritty, realistic, modernist 70s sound that makes me like that decade so much more than the one that preceded it.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): I always have a soft spot for songs dedicated city life

**freeofblasphemy** (9.5): Such a powerful conclusion

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): I’m sorry the way he says crime is increasing made me laugh

**jman457** (9): Really cool how it came back to the opening number

**kappyko** (9): Thinking about the convo about the visualizer that occurred during this very serious song

**waluigiest** (9): that reprise at the end!!!!

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.5): Some of these lines hit hard

**runaway3212** (8.5): im so into vore

## Got eaten by the visualiser

**musical\_pyn** (8): probably my favorite lyrics on the album honestly

**Tadevos** (8): I love this song in theory but it goes on just a little too long. Still, “It makes me wanna holler/the way they do my life” hits hard. And the coda? Come all the way on dude I’m gonna give it another half point

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): That was such a good closer!

**Blisterman** (7): Ends the album on a bit of a bummer. The world is going to shit, and there's nothing you can do about it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): I had a few 11 contenders throughout this process, but I feel very happy with my final pick. It's Stevie's opus of a disenfranchised black family, and one Southern man trying to make it up north in the city. The song is dramatic, bleak and evocative. It also has one of the best chorus melodies I've ever heard plus transcendent synth lines. The skit in the middle adds to the dramatic, direct commentary that Stevie was going for. It's a direct gem of storytelling about how unfair systemic racism is towards black people just wanting a better life, and speaks to the U.S North's systemic oppression. It's bleak and Stevie is powerful throughout. One day Stevie, YOU WILL win a rate!! Next cycle let's just rate Songs in the Key of Life all by itself tbh.

**flavasavavandal** (10): A worthy second place finish for the long song that almost made it. There were points where it was close to beating What’s Going On. But in the end, despite the admirable effort, it never did. One of my favourites off of Innervisions and a contender for my 11. The potency of the song’s tale still rings true into the present, nearly 50 years later (which says more about us, than the power of the song but still). It is heartbreaking tale of the cruelty searching for a “better life” can give you as racism and the justice system will try to break black men at the time. It’s bleak and doesn’t hold any punches, but Stevie always has a way of injecting hope and optimism into his song as he spends the last verse calling for action for the people who get oppressed by poverty and racism. I’m a sucker for story-telling songs and this is one of the best that the rate and maybe the entirety of the 70s has to offer.

---

## LIVIIIIIIIIING FOR THE CIIIIIIIIIITYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!

**akanewasright** (11): There is no Stevie Wonder rate win! Everybody knows that! please prove me wrong popheads

**apatel27** (11): God what a track

**bbfan132** (11): absolute fucking classic

**bo_g_o** (11): not only is this funky as shit but it is also just really lyrically amazing

**jman457** (11): Its a major bop, with a fantastic soundscape, and good political message

**jsonphile** (11): absolutely slaps. And good political commentary too. Just an all around perfect song. Most artists are lucky if they can create one perfect song. Stevie Wonder has like seven and two are in this list alone

**LazyDayLullaby** (11): Absolutely timeless classic. From the incredible vocal performance to the lyrics themselves (and not to mention the music!!) this really has it all

**seanderlust** (11): this is bananas. the switch-up midway through where it becomes more tense than the first half? the critique of systemic racism? stevie's soaring voice over these instrumentals? chef's kiss. if this doesn't end up being my 11, let it be known it was damn close

**static\_int\_husp** (11): both parts of this song are so fun to listen to and are a good contrast to each other. Also enjoy the skit in the middle of it

**vayyiqra** (11): I love songs with good storytelling and the ending of this song shocked me the first time I heard it - I knew it was a song about racism but didn't expect such a brutal twist with the protagonist being unjustly arrested and jailed. That it's lost none of its impact today shows what an amazing song it is.

**waluigiest** (11): masterful. A musical and political epic.

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is citypop. Well, the genre itself does take inspiration from soul, but really, there’s nothing deeply intelligent I can say about this one. It’s a nice song on racism and optimism and the lie of “the grass is greener on the other side”.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): What a masterpiece. Honestly chilling.

**babadork** (10): Part of what makes this song powerful is that it is so unlike Stevie Wonder. While he still hopes that the story in this song will inspire people to try to bring about change, him writing a song that is so pessimistic captures your attention. Also, SNL @ 5:20. I don’t want to talk about how long it took me to find that sketch.

**celladonn** (10): Amazing storytelling, this is so good!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the break really ties the song together IMO

**fadedblue09** (10): Now this is some masterful storytelling. Love how the energy and instrumental complement it well

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): There's a lot going on here. Sturdy legged women. Police brutality. Stevie's voice on the last verse. Skyscrapers and everything. Incredible really

**ImADudeDuh** (10): now why was this song sampled in “Lil Freak by Usher (Ft. Nicki Minaj)”

**kappyko** (10): remarkably ambitious narrative song that pulls off the inclusion of a spoken word interlude without being gimmicky. i might be underselling this because it's easily among the best in the rate. You Could Say It's The Pyramids Of This Rate If You Wanted To. potent and relevant commentary that does not beat around the bush

**MadJohnBeard** (10): vocals absolutely make this one

**MorrisFae** (10): Incredibly powerful vocal floating on top of a reserved but forebodingly quiet groove? The slow explosion as the drums kick in and the lyrics get more and more desperate? And I don't even have to mention that legendary "da da da" synth line! Any song where Stevie breaks into the growls is a special one too. This song is a VERY strong contender for 11, and the break in the middle is powerful.

**musical\_pyn** (10): the vocal delivery on this track is really great and complements the story so well. Seriously, the musical texturing on this thing is perfect

**qazz23** (10): vocal performance on the last verse is incredible (11 candidate)

**ReallyCreative** (10): the way this song is still relevant... hits a little close to home I think!

**Roxieloxie** (10): God this song is so good. Ive only ever heard the shortened version up until doing this rate. Like as someone who loves the intersections of blackness and urban city scapes, this is just everything. I love this song so much

**runaway3212** (10): A song for the gays

**Smuckles** (10): One time I went to a friend's 30th birthday party and the DJ played the full album version of this. He also played the theme from The Exorcist along with Circle of Life from The Lion King. Absolutely bizarre night, but I think i respect what he was trying to do... maybe.

**soggy\_charge9447** (10): standout track that I constantly go back to

**Stryxen** (10): Living for this city pop 😍

**TiltControls** (10): I swear if I see see any 'too long' comments... Anyways this would be my 11 if my actual 11 weren't in the rate. It's does an amazing job painting the story and the instrumentation is top-notch too.

**austrosinitic** (9.5): Come to think of it Black Man off Songs of the Key of Life, while still being great and very well-intentioned, is pretty much a lesser remake of this since it kind of sounds the same and also inexplicably mentions Christopher Columbus in a positive or at least neutral tone (Stevie, why?)

**freeofblasphemy** (9): No one can spin a yarn quite like Stevie

**sarcasticsobs** (9): the choices this makes, i love it

**welcome2thejam** (9): The spoken word section is the biggest of gut punches, holy shit. Not that the initial verses are all that positive but boy does it snatch what little hope you had left for the narrative

**MC\_Fuzzy** (8.5): ?I unfortunately felt the pain of the little brother’s story

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): That was so good! Might be my fav Stevie song so far!

**Blisterman** (8): A socially conscious song that resonates to the current day.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8): The skit towards the end of the song drags it down at the end but really good song.

**plastichaxan** (8): the way these songs make me want to bop but then i pay attention to the lyrics and it feels wrong to

**Tadevos** (8): Uh yeah this song? Pretty damn good. When he puts his back into it Wonder is one hell of a storyteller, and that collage in the middle is damned effective, to say nothing of the insistent strut of that arrangement.

## Dead for the city

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): i had not heard this before the rate but I did know that post-chorus instrumental section from a sample in Usher’s Lil Freak so it feels so much more modern than 70s to me. Very good but I might be a bit skit-phobic

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I appreciate the ambition and it’s not bad but I can’t really see a situation where I’d want to listen to this, I love musical theatre so I’m not a stranger to long tracks with a story but this is just too out there for me.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Like many comments have said, "What else is there to say?" Some might say it's a very predictable winner. It stayed at the top for a long time, only getting dethroned by "Higher Ground" by like half a day. In some cases, Living for the City was often just .1 points away from a tie or being #1. But, Marvin held his ground ever since we got more ballots coming in. Stevie got the most 11s, but so many people gave it 10s it won the whole rate. And it makes sense. It's arguably THE defining song that dovetails the 60s civil rights movement into 70s Black Power and Black Pride. If people only knew one song in this rate, it's this one. It's grand, textured, and Marvin sings in a quiet yet rooted way that compels you to want things to be better too. A deserving winner, congrats two-time champ Marvin!

**flavasavavandal** (10): Here to welcome our rate winner, Marvin wins his second rate in quick succession and his a 100% win rate in soul rates so far. Boasting an impressive 9.568 average this song got to the top pretty early on and rarely let go (I think Inner City Blues dethroned it at one point). And yeah I get it, it wasn’t my personal favourite in the rate but everything that makes the album incredible is in this song. It’s lush orchestration, it’s optimistic tone, the sublime sax, and Marvin just crooning his heart out. It became a classic for a damn good reason. And while I do hate a predictable winner, I can’t be that mad

## Impeccable taste

**AHSWeeknd** (11): An album highlight, a discography highlight, a decade highlight, a genre highlight, a music highlight! Seriously one of the best songs ever.

**cremeebrulee** (11): such a perfect song, sounds as peaceful as the message it’s trying to convey soblove

**frogaranaman** (11): one of those perfect songs that I don't know how anyone can hate

**MNREDR** (11): Love the juxtaposition of serious lyrics against the lighthearted intro and chatter throughout.

**musical\_pyn** (11): Right away I'm blown away by the production on this song, this sounds SO good. Also, the song just gets better and better with every listen. Definitely my favorite discovery of the rate

**ReallyCreative** (11): insert He-Man song here

**skargardin** (11): Honestly so many 11 contenders here, but this has got to be the standout for me

**TiltControls** (11): I feel like it's a basic 11 choice, but at the same time... you cannot deny how amazing of a song this is - both culturally and musically

**2dina3dworld** (10): so true! You’ve got to be able to fight for your rights! Not just to party, but to be free, to live, to ensure a better life for your children and their children.

**akanewasright** (10): Berry Gordy lied, this is incredible

**austrosinitic** (10): I won’t even bother writing that pretentious a comment for this, we can all just agree that it’s just one of the best songs of all time, right?! Right?! Compared to, say, Sly and the Family Stone Marvin’s socially-motivated unrest on this album may seem a little vague (at least without the context of the times. i.e ‘war is not the answer’) but right at the opening of this album you can tell that it won’t hinder its authenticity because of how sincere and emotional this masterpiece was sung, arranged and produced like. I won’t even mind if my 11 loses to this because saying that it would deserve to win ANY rate is just the truth.

**babadork** (10): This is so perfect that it is hard to find words to describe how good it is.

**bbfan132** (10): total classic and perfect opener

**BeauMeringue212** (10): It feels weird for a song about such dark topics to sound so light and optimistic, but it just works

**Blisterman** (10): What can I say that hasn't been said? It's one of the all time best songs.

**celladonn** (10): So true

**fadedblue09** (10): Undeniable classic and staple of the genre

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): Easiest ten of my life tbh.

**freeofblasphemy** (10): Life-affirming

**jsonphile** (10): an absolutely perfect song. There’s a reason why this tops so many best songs list. The sadness and weariness that Marvin Gaye depicts here with just enough hope for a better future, it’s exactly everything I’d want in a protest song.

**kappyko** (10): It's The Title Track To Marvin Gaye's What's Going On There's Only So Much I Can Say

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): What other score could it possibly get??

**MadJohnBeard** (10): basically perfect intro song/lead single

**MorrisFae** (10): There's a certain cruelty to us only being allowed to give one 11 in a rate made up of potentials. This was the first Marvin Gaye I heard, and it changed me instantly. From the buttery smooth vocals, the conga-led groove, the delicate string arrangement, and the intensely political lyrics, Gayes comes right out of the gate on one of the greatest albums ever made with what could be argued as the greatest protest song of all time. Contrary to Stevie's near constant masterful smoothness, there's an edge and a crackle to Gaye's voice, a rasp, a deeply human performance.

**qazz23** (10): one of the smoothest melodies here, plus the strings! (11 candidate)

**Roxieloxie** (10): god this song is amazing

**runaway3212** (10): What is going on is that this song is being robbed (@hosts please remove this comment if this song wins)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): fuck Berry Gordy

**seanderlust** (10): can't believe barry gordy would have given this a 0. barry gordy is banned from rates.

**Tadevos** (10): Man, what do you even want me to say here?

**vayyiqra** (10): What a beautiful song. It might seem corny today the way he paraphrases MLK preaching about ending hate with love and so on but I think we could use more of that energy today in our incredibly cynical times.

**waluigiest** (10): it’s a silky blanket, it’s warm milk, it’s a firm hug, it’s so feel good in a bleak sort of way

**welcome2thejam** (10): Classics are oftentimes classics for a reason, you know.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this song was definitely a slow grower, but I really enjoy it and it’s a great protest song

**bo_g_o** (9): ooh this is nice and soulful

**CreepyMannequin** (9): classic

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I’ll tell you what’s going on a bop

**Smuckles** (9): Just about better than the All Star Tribute, I guess.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): are he-man jokes gonna be overdone

**jman457** (8): Breezy but wish it took a more definitive statement

**Stryxen** (8): me every time i opened the rates channel during a ratemas game

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I'm gonna get brutally attacked for this but I never got the hype around this song. I love the message but other than that...

## What’s Going On with your taste?

**NotWith10000Men** (6): caveat: I like using the whole 0-10 range so this score isn't a 'omg F- this song sucks' score, it's just a right in the middle score, pretty much bc of the instrumentation and stuff. I kept waiting and waiting for like a key change or a crescendo or something but nothing really happened? just felt samey throughout until the ad libbing which I like, but the music under it is still the same and still has the same energy.

FlavaSavaVandal: # Innervisions

---

**Overall Average**: 8.487 **// Average Controversy:** 1.389

---

 Popheads does not deserve Stevie Wonder, Where do I even start with Innervisions, it’s the middle child of 5 albums that make up what is referred to as Stevie’s classic period and is easily the best of the 5 but you didn’t hear that from me. But like this is a classic album through and through. Stevie is such a beacon of optimism that it is hard to resist because Stevie is just such a charismatic presence whether behind the mic or an instrument. You feel that warmth and love come through in the textures, as every instrument feels so organically layered. Coming into the rate this album was my favourite of the four, and while that did change, it’s more because the one that overtook it grew on me more than I expected. I hope everyone who did this rate keeps coming back to this every now and then because it truly is a special album

**bo_g_o** (9.944): Stevie went off here

**kappyko** (9.889): This is the classic Stevie album for people too intimidated by the length of Songs in the Key of Life. Or the classic Stevie album for people who really want a succinct artistic statement! In 21st century terms... it's the channel Orange to SITKOL's Blonde??? ehhh i kinda hate that

**AHSWeeknd** (9.778): Definition of well-executed album. Though I prefer Stevie Wonder’s mid to late 70s work, this album is such a brilliant album.

**waluigiest** (9.556): Stevie Wonder is one of history’s greatest musicians. I’m slowly, slowly getting through his discography. This is close to a perfect album, as much of his work is.

**2dina3dworld** (9.500): this was funky. Funky fresh. Well, really, if we want to get more in depth, it was innovative, fun, and willing to do the mostest. There was so much going on, but it was done in a way that made it funky fresh and enjoyable rather than overwhelming.

**jsonphile** (9.444): Well somehow I haven’t actually listened to this album prior to this rate, only Songs in the Key of Life. I know, I know I’m sorry I need to get into this discography more, Talking Book is next. But to the surprise of no one, Stevie Wonder made an excellent album here. Of course he did he’s Stevie Wonder. It’s just so obviously good there’s not much to say about it. The political commentary is great, the production slaps, Stevie is a fantastic singer, just an all around amazing album.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9.111): Stevie Wonder is such a talent

**austrosinitic** (9.111): I connect to Songs in the Key of Life and Music of My Mind more than this out of Stevie's golden period, but at forty-something minutes it's probably the greatest introduction ever to his music; universally breathtaking without watering down its heritage, creating simple yet flawless poetry in song as well as in lyric. It's insane that it could be the sacred cow of a genre, but that Stevie had another peak up his sleeve.

**vayyiqra** (9.000): Stevie has influenced so many musicians it's surprising I've never heard a full album of his before. I knew he is an incredibly talented musician, and made a bunch of classic albums, but I didn't know he was only in his early to mid 20s (!) when he was at his peak. This album was thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end and now I see why he gets so much acclaim for this era of his career. I have been converted. I am a Stevewiftie.

**freeofblasphemy** (8.944): Not as good as “Songs in the Key of Life” but still great

**TiltControls** (8.889): What an amazing album. The songs that scored the lowest for me are at worst, just alright - but the highs are so good. Some of his best and most iconic work (Living For The City, Higher Ground) is on here and even past that, there's a ton of great other tracks to discover on the album.

**Smuckles** (8.778): My favourite of the 4, my favourite of the 4 artists, and I'll even go as far as to say this is my favourite album I've rated on reddit. SITKOL will always be my favourite of his, i see it as a minor miracle it exists in the first place, but if you're looking for a more digestible album this is where to go.

**seanderlust** (8.711): Stevie is a treasure. stream Signed, Sealed, Delivered for clear skin.

**MadJohnBeard** (8.667): hard to imagine a more accessible album - Stevie is a melodic genius and the dude played most everything himself

**qazz23** (8.667): great album, covers a lot of musical ground and subject matter

**BeauMeringue212** (8.667): I feel like this was the most sensitive gentle album on the rate, but that diminishes none of its serious messaging.

**welcome2thejam** (8.556): God, Stevie's voice is something else, huh? Love the bounciness and him working with and leaping to a few different genres on it. Good to fantastic tracks the whole way through

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.389): Wonderful and visionary

**jman457** (8.311): Im closer and closer to being a Stevie Wonder believer

**fadedblue09** (8.222): The amount of musicianship demonstrated in this album is just....wow. I love the vocals, the songwriting is excellent, the issues and themes are well-presented.. Overall it’s not hard to see why it’s such a classic. While it isn't my favorite of the bunch, I definitely enjoyed this album a lot.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8.167): I've listened to this album twice this year and, as strange as it was to come to this conclusion, it's probably the weakest album of Stevie's imperial period. Maybe it's due to my over familiarity with the album and some of its songs and a portion of it ranges from classic to cringe but it's still an essential listen if you want to delve into Stevie's discography. Overall 8/10

**FightYaAtThePrody** (7.889): I don't think I'd ever listened to a record by Stevie before this. In fact I don't think I hadn't really listened to much at all. I think I wrote him off because he appeared on The X-Factor once so I'd written him off as being uncool. Which was really dumb of me because it turns out I actually really like Stevie. He's great. Don't really care for the slower songs but they're still fine. Hopefully one day I'll get around to checking out "Songs In The Key Of Life."

**Blisterman** (7.889): I go back and forth between this and SITKOL for my favourite Stevie Wonder album. I lean towards the latter, but this is still a fantastic album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.722): I’d never listened to this album before, my main context for it was Snoh Aalegra mentions it in “I Want You Around” and now I’m confused why she was listening to it with her boyfriend because this is kinda heavy girl, I wouldn’t necessarily make a baby to this

**bigbigbee** (7.667): This album makes me feel like I’m walking into a club that’s too cool for me. Smoke is in the air and the music’s already playing; I’m late. No one takes notice, anyway – they’re all glued to Stevie.

**CreepyMannequin** (7.444): I love the synths on this! Will definitely come back to this.

**Tadevos** (6.167): I’ve never sat down with a full Stevie Wonder album, you know? I’m surprised at how much of it I don’t like. “Stevie Wonder is a genius and a polymath” is such a truism in music criticism that I’m almost shocked at how often I was bored here. I mean, not too bored, but bored enough to bother me. The highs are pretty high, but there are a handful of duds and a few surprisingly weak choruses. It’s also somehow the least cohesive album here—it’s not as bound to aesthetic or feel as the Sly and Marvin albums, or to themes like Curtis’s. It’s the most Songs record here, and it lives and dies on that.

**MNREDR** (5.889): I didn't connect with this album as much as I hoped but I choose to blame it on my political ignorance and lack of taste. It is the coolest album title in the rate though!

FlavaSavaVandal: # What's Going On

---

**Overall Average**: 8.237 **// Average Controversy:** 1.337

---

 We finished this rate, praise God., There was a point, about two weeks into this rate where I thought this album would top my album averages. I wasn't, fairly sure this is my lowest average, and while Rolling Stone says this is the greatest album of all time, I like this one the least. Now I still absolutely adore this album. It’s beautifully lush orchestration still feels timeless. It’s content probably feels the most relevant to today. And if I could give a transition an 11, there are about 3 different ones here I would consider.

* #1: What's Going On | 9.568 | 679.3
* #3: Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler) | 9.142 | 649.1
* #6: Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology) | 9.023 | 640.6
* #15: What's Happening Brother | 8.480 | 602.1
* #18: Right On | 8.120 | 576.5
* #27: God Is Love | 7.820 | 555.2
* #30: Flyin' High (In The Friendly Sky) | 7.752 | 550.4
* #36: Wholy Holy | 7.152 | 507.8
* #37: Save The Children | 7.073 | 502.2

**AHSWeeknd** (10.111): The way this album delivers the emotional roller coaster that was the era of the Vietnam war is insane. It’s done so perfectly and stands to be one of the best albums of all time because of it. One of the most interesting aspects of that era was when the veterans would come home and see all the dissonance surrounding the war. Obviously it was a poor decision on the American governments part but then those veterans would show up and listen to all the protesters wondering “was all my effort just a waste?” Not all of them answered with “yes” but evidently it was a difficult thing to admit. I feel so overly opinionated on that era because it was one of the first times where Americans questioned their leadership regarding a crime that didn’t directly impact them. That would then snowball into the sort of justice-seeking movements we have today. That era was a difficult time in history and deserves to be remembered as such. Of course anyone coming back from war would want to appreciate the peace and joy of life, but you can’t ignore the reality. This is what the album does, it conveys an atmosphere of peace through the instruments but has a message that can’t be ignored. Honestly a masterpiece.

**2dina3dworld** (9.556): personally my favourite of all of the albums in this rate, as a cohesive project. There’s not a lot I can say, it’s just very dreamy, yet still political and sticking to its guns. And we love that!

**MNREDR** (9.222): This is one of the first concept albums I've listened to in full, and it's setting the bar high. I lack the eloquence to praise this album as much as it deserves but it's emotionally impactful and sonically cohesive, a standout experience. It gives me insight to a time, place, and life I've never thought about before and my life feels slightly richer for it. Everyone should listen to this.

**TiltControls** (9.222): One of the most well regarded albums of all time for good reason. The 3 song stretch of What's Going On - What's Happening Brother - Flying High is maybe one of the strongest openings I've ever seen and the fact that the album can still keep up speed from there is only a testament to how good it is. I realize that this is a rate of juggernauts, so some scores might pushed down in relation to other songs in the rate - but this is an album where I really hope it ends up as one of our highest rated

**Own-Photograph-4642** (9.167): For over thirty five minutes, this album does not let up and it contains some of the most sublime musical arrangements of the year. One can pinpoint the moment where Marvin MK 2 began and it's within the first few seconds of the album. Thank God the fans took heed of the importance of What's Goin' On and made Barry Gordy realize the mistake he was making in not seeing the song's potential. The fact that this and There's a Riot Goin' On (which was named after this album) are still relevant testaments to the struggles going on today by African-Americans and the world at large are largely due to the potency of the messages displayed on record. Marvelous, just marvelous. Overall 10/10

**waluigiest** (9.000): the entire construction of this album is so incredible. It’s a complete experience.

**cremeebrulee** (8.933): this was utterly gorgeous in every way WOW. i knew RS recently named this the best album of all time and i had super high expectations but it still blew me away. i really appreciate how even when the subject matter is dire, marvin never sounds demoralizing, just hopeful. it really makes the whole project sound serene, lyrically and sonically. one of my favorite rate discoveries ever, i can't wait to revisit this!

**kappyko** (8.889): Honestly, the album I have the least to say about? I DO like it!!!! And I love the suite style. Yet this album has never stuck with me as much as the others

**vayyiqra** (8.889): This album is such a treat to listen to - it flows so incredibly well from beginning to end and feels more like a suite of connected songs than just a bunch of random tracks. It also has some of the strongest sociopolitical themes and most based lyrics in the rate, which is saying a lot.

**jsonphile** (8.833): The only album on here I had listened to prior to this rate. I loved it the first time I listened to it and I loved it now. Marvin Gaye is one of the best singers of all time, and he really shines here through his emotional pleas for peace and unity. And goddamn does it feel bad that so much of what he sings about is stuff we’re still dealing with today. Racism, police brutality, climate change, capitalism. This album almost aged too well, it makes me wanna holler. It almost feels weird to rate the individual songs on here when this whole album really feels like one long song with multiple parts, it just flows so well lyrically and musically. And oh what a great sound it is. Just so lush and beautiful, I could listen to instrumentals of this album all day. It’s no wonder why it tops so many greatest albums lists, it truly is a masterpiece.

**qazz23** (8.778): great vocals and songwriting, everything just flows perfectly

**welcome2thejam** (8.667): Damn, maybe Rolling Stone was on the right track...

**austrosinitic** (8.667): I kind of feel bad listening to this…I’ve grown to really like it over time but it really musically resembles the 60s (one of my least favorite decades in music) more than the 70s (my favorite) more than the other albums in the rate, so while I certainly understand why it’s a hallmark of soul music I just don’t connect to its smoothness and softness as much as the cinematic majesty of Superfly or the psychedelic atmosphere of There’s A Riot Goin ‘On. But even if I haven’t really fallen in love with the record as a whole, I’ve certainly fallen in love with a lot of its best moments; it’s a tender, lovely work made only more tragic by how Marvin’s life was cut short. I really hope that someday it just finally clicks for me, because it deserves it.

**freeofblasphemy** (8.611): Feels so universal yet so personal

**BeauMeringue212** (8.578): Marvin's voice is just beautiful on this album goddamn

**Tadevos** (8.556): I haven’t done that many rates, but I gotta say that it’s vanishingly rare for me to bottom out my scores for an album at a 7. Y’all have made me do that *twice*. Kudos. Anyway, this album flows so well and ties together so tight that it’s simply unfair.

**seanderlust** (8.489): there's a reason this one is in the library of congress. it is an incredibly important and thoughtful record and i'm so glad marvin had the opportunity to write it.

**MadJohnBeard** (8.222): Completely integrated themes/messages into amazing soul production - easy to see classic. (i lowkey still like sexual Marvin the best)

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.211): Timely and timeless

**jman457** (7.811): Is this the best album ever made, no. But its still a really good one

=====

FlavaSavaVandal: **bo_g_o** (7.778): this album is pretty good, but there are definitely parts where it just kinda drags

**FightYaAtThePrody** (7.667): I quite like the record and it's got a couple of moments that are genuinely astonishing. But at the same time I can't help but be a little disappointed. I think the title "Greatest Album Of All Time" is just too heavy for any album to wear comfortably. Coming into it and expecting it to be the GOAT just leads to me having expectations that are way too high for any album. Like it feels like there should be something in this record that separates it from every other album recorded. And then when it doesn't immediately blow me away, I just end up feeling disappointed. The same thing happened when I listened to Sgt Pepper's for the first time as well actually. Maybe I should just not trust what Rolling Stone tells me lol. ("What's Going On" is an infinitely better GOAT choice than "Sgt Pepper's" tho)

**Blisterman** (7.667): No doubt this will win. It’s an amazing album. And one which really resonates to the current day.

**bigbigbee** (7.611): This album makes me feel like I’m walking down the street of a large city (probably New York). I am there, but I am not.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.611): I gave this one kinda middling scores but it’s kinda my favorite actually? I don’t know why that is, I think it just works so much better as a whole than as just individual songs, which is how I rated it.

**fadedblue09** (7.278): I can see why it’s a classic and I liked some of the lyrical themes, but this album stood out to me the least. Compared to the other three it lacks instrumental diversity (and honestly feels lulling at times) and some of the songwriting feel trite, which makes some messages feel cheesy and forced. The highlights are definitely memorable though.

**Smuckles** (6.889): A hugely important album socially and historically, I can't take away from that. It is however my least favourite album here, there's weird quality fluctuations throughout the album, it just so happens to be bookended with 2 of the best soul songs ever. Still should be obligatory listening for anyone interested in music.

**CreepyMannequin** (5.278): Marvin Gaye obviously has a great voice (you don’t need me to tell you that!) but I found a lot of these songs blended together. Love the socially conscious aspect though.

#**Songs**

Congratulations to **What's Going On**!! With it's score it takes the spot for the 35th highest rated songs across all rates! So glad that it managed to win out even against such strong competition

Also congrats to **Les Fleurs** for winning the bonus rate! It becomes the 5th highest rated bonus song we've rated!

For the other 9+ songs:

* **Living For The City**: 65th

* **Inner City Blues**: 199th

* **Higher Ground**: 213th

* **Pusherman**: 277th

* **Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)**: 280th

And for the bonus songs:

* **Les Fleurs**: 5th highest rated bonus song

* **They Say I'm Different**: 9th highest rated bonus song

#**Artists**

**Marvin** becomes a 2 time rate winner with the win for What's Going On! Unfortunately Marvin picks up a couple of 0s so he falls off the 'No 0's list' but it's a small price to pay for another win

Though **Stevie** misses out on the rate win he still gets a couple of accolades. He takes 12th place for highest rated artist across all rates. He also continues his zero-less streak for another rate! He also has an album record listed below

**Curtis** manages to make his way onto the top 10 highest rated artists list in 7th! He also takes a first place record becoming our new leader for **lowest average controversy** across all artists! Lauryn Hill was the previous record holder. In more common (but still notable!) records, Curtis becomes yet another artist to have never been given a 0!

**Sly** unfortunately couldn't keep up with the other 3 and makes his way onto the list for earliest exit in a 4 album rate. He left just before the top 10 at 11th which ties him for 6th with Halsey's performance on Hopeless Fountain Kingdom.

For the placements below keep in mind that the 3 artists except for Curtis all have had previous songs rated that affect their score

* **Curtis:** 7th out of 282 artists with 8.377

 * Below: Tori Amos (6th by 0.023 points)

 * Above: Donna Summer (8th by 0.003 points)

* **Stevie:** 12th out of 282 artists with 8.301 (previously 46th with 7.965)

 * Below: Fiona Apple (11th by 0.015 points)

 * Above: Sufjan Stevens (13th by 0.004 points)

* **Marvin:** 27th out of 282 artists with 8.167 (previously 39th with 8.041)

 * Below: Pusha T (26th by 0.023 points)

 * Above: Kid Cudi (28th by 0.003 points)

* **Sly:** 98th out of 282 artists with 7.699

 * Below: Dua Lipa (97th by 0.004 points)

 * Above: Kelis (99th by 0.007 points)

#**Rate**

The 70's Soul Classics rate becomes the 8th highest average rate of all time! Funny enough it's only 0.004 points beyond #7 which is the 60's Soul Classics rate. It's also the 6th lowest controversy rate across every rate too

#**Albums**

**Innervisions** takes the spot as the 7th best rated album across all rates! Congrats to Stevie!

**Superfly** also does quite well and lands at 16th

And I'm very excited for us to keep rating every Stevie Wonder album until he wins a rate :D

Thank you all SO much for submitting ballots, coming to listening parties, fulfilling extensions and joining us for the reveals! This rate was a doozy and I definitely got sucked into it, lol, but I'm so happy that everyone had enthusiasm with the music.

Here is [Day 3 Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL04Kmp6GfIPf9A4W_yZCtOiQ1MQBkrPOQ)
