Hello Popheads!!! Welcome to the 70s Soul Classics Rate. We're your [hosts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iUJzQ5svaE)\-- [darjeelingdarkroast](https://imgur.com/a/thPoQCX) and[ FlavaSavaVandal](https://imgur.com/a/m0PaxHw)! And we have 4 classic albums for you to listen to from four legends of soul music.

# Introduction

The early 70s were a tense time for the good ol’ U. S. of A. America was stuck in a war that a lot of people no longer want to be a part of, sending young men to risk their lives in South East Asia despite promise from several administrations that involvement in the war was decreasing; racial inequality is still a huge problem for black Americans who are still not afforded the same opportunities as white people; anti-war protests expose the realities of police brutality; and the Watergate Scandal was happening.

There was also a golden age of excellent socially conscious music that came out as a response to these issues. This was especially true in soul music, where many artists of that time were evolving soul into a more album-orientated genre, incorporating gospel, jazz, R&B, pop, psychedelia and progressive elements. This period of music has become influential on future genres such as hip-hop, contemporary R&B and neo-soul and has received much critical acclaim. The four albums featured in this rate led the charge in this evolution of soul and shocked critics who had underestimated their talents. Each album has stood the test of time in terms of critical acclaim, and were all commercially successful in giving the world a decent amount of hit singles, and strong album sales. These albums paved the way for other black artists to be more politically explicit in their music.

# Stevie Wonder - Innervisions

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5jgI8Eminx9MmLBontDWq8?si=Oky90Ik6RQeqzh6uqbbsBg) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/innervisions/1440806790) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8dK0iEzi1M&list=PL-UWPlRIl68r3pgPFEtpMQ3T4aF7xq8Hb)

A child prodigy who had been signed to Motown since he was 11 and had already given the world enduring hits throughout the 1960's, whether they were of his own catalogue or his label mates'. Wonder's contract was soon to expire in the early 70's when he turned 21 and was about to use his star power to sign a new deal with them, which gave him greater control over the music he was making. Shortly afterwards Stevie entered what is widely regarded as his classic period with a greater focus on socially conscious themes, more intricate song structures and the incorporation of synthesisers.

Released in 1973, Innervisions is the third album in Stevie's classic period and usually hailed as one his best works. Innervisions has been included on several decade and all-time best lists, currently 34 on the most recent edition of the Greatest Albums of All Time by Rolling Stones. It was Stevie's first of three consecutive releases to win Album of the Year at the Grammys. It gave Stevie three hit singles including the bop Higher Ground and the politically charged Living for the City, the latter also winning a Grammy for best R&B Song. The only thing that challenges the list of accomplishments of Innervisions is the fact that Stevie Wonder plays nearly all the instruments on 6 tracks from Innervisions. The album itself can be a bleak experience which doesn't shy away from the darkness of the issues Stevie touches upon including drug abuse and systemic racism, but Stevie is able to carry the album through with a hard-earned sense of optimism to find something better for yourself and others. And if you stick around to the end you get to hear a Richard Nixon diss track.

# Marvin Gaye - What's Going On

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2v6ANhWhZBUKkg6pJJBs3B?si=jDsREtK6Q1apUMZI8e0tJg) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/whats-going-on/1538081586) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApthDWoPMFQ&list=PLc60gkdW0bcFbUwumMvBpxVrFbkeRzoPf)

Former rate winner Marvin Gaye is another icon of Motown. He had been with Motown since 1961, and provided them a steady flow of hits throughout the 60's. By 1970 though, Gaye had been deeply depressed following the death of his friend and singing partner Tammi Terrell, a failing marriage and disillusionment with the control Motown had over his music and image. Influenced by a song given to him by Renaldo Benson of The Four Tops, letters from his brother after he returned from Vietnam and anti-war protests, Marvin turned inwards for introspection and towards his faith for comfort and began work on his eleventh studio album, What's Going On in 1970. A shockingly politically conscious album from a label that was not known to release politically conscious music. Marvin would have to fight Berry Gordy for the release of the title track, in which Marvin refused to release anything else until What's Going On (song) was released. A move which soon after gave other Motown artists more agency over their own work.

Released in May of 1971. What's Going On is a concept album from the point of view of a soldier returning from Vietnam seeing the injustice and violence going on around him in America. Each song flows into the next, creating a cyclical experience if you put the album on repeat. It is one of the most rewarding and lush listens of 70’s soul music, as Marvin takes us on an enlightening journey, touching on topics such as racial inequality, the effects of war on a personal level, oppression and poverty. Throughout, the beautifully empathetic voice of Marvin Gaye, suddenly breaks with frustration in the final track, Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler), which makes you realise that Marvin was never asking a question with the album title. It has since become one of the most celebrated albums of all time, topping the most recent edition of the Rolling Stone's Greatest Albums of All Time list, as well as several other decade-end and all-time best lists. The album would also become influential throughout the rest of the decade on soul music, helping transform soul into an album-focused genre and pushing soul into more progressive and directly political directions, and influenced later genres such as neo-soul as well. Later in the same year a response album from Sly and the Family Stone, There's A Riot Goin' On was released. Commercially What's Going On was a huge success for both Motown and Marvin, the title track peaked at number 2 on the Hot 100 and Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology) and Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler) both peaked within the top ten as well, the album became the best selling Marvin Gaye and Motown album at that point, selling around two million copies within twelve months of release.

# Curtis Mayfield – Super Fly

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/295ykF5lEp4sZseuob1qTu?si=8mU6eqJOQ6a4WZaX2iulpA) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/superfly-soundtrack-from-the-motion-picture/1048472205) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJkjVfOcIxs&list=PLrVoteC1udtG9nFvAu8JRmmfoBj37poFy)

Born and raised in Chicago, Curtis Mayfield showed musical talent from an early age. At 14 he joined the group The Impressions, who went on to create several soul hits in the 1960s. The Impressions song in the popheads 60’s Pop/Soul Rate, “People Get Ready”, was chosen by Dr. Martin Luther King for freedom rides! When Curtis left The Impressions in the early 1970s, he continued sharpening his political messages in his early solo work. Then, he was asked to create the soundtrack to the 1972 blaxploitation movie Super Fly. For those new to the genre, blaxploitation films were a subgenre of movies in the 70s full of drama and action, starring strong black leads with an anti-authoritarian streak. Within the confines of white Hollywood, what set these movies apart were that they had black directors at the helm. The term was coined pejoratively by Beverly-Hills NAACP chapter leader Junius Griffin, as some members of these black affinity groups found the movies to be stereotypical. It was a polarizing yet popular subgenre that often marketed towards black audiences with dynamic leads (Richard Roundtree, Pam Grier, etc.) and even more dynamic R&B and soul soundtracks.

This 1972 album, Superfly, marked a new direction for Curtis.  It currently sits as the 76th album on Rolling Stones' 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and was a commercial success, spending four weeks as the number one pop album on the 1972 charts. The album is a bleak political tale of Harlem life and the jaded characters getting by. Funky percussion and Curtis’ falsetto permeate the songs of drug dealers, addicts and lovers in Harlem. The album paints the post-Civil Rights strife of black people coming to terms with the Nixon administration’s “law and order” bigotry. Each song tells the story of a complex character avoiding or succumbing to vices in their daily life. Cuts like “Pusherman” are from the perspective of the neighborhood drug dealer, a dark funky tale buoyed by driving percussion. Other songs like “No Thing On Me” has Curtis sing about the relief of avoiding drugs due to mental strength: “I’m so glad I’ve got my own / So glad that I can see / My life’s a natural high / ‘The man’ can’t put no thing on me.” In Super Fly, black people are rendered in a full spectrum of scenarios, no matter how ugly or heartbreaking the scenarios get--because it was important this full range of emotions were on display. Curtis dealt with the anguish his fellow black people were grappling with in this soundtrack, hoping people would start to care about the political neglect facing those trapped in the system.

# Sly & the Family Stone - There's A Riot Goin' On

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/29f2cOueckYE8Nc1pkJjrU?si=4nJpvSymRiyzgA_q2aqEQg) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/theres-a-riot-goin-on/1501778712) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKayhF4rLOU&list=PLz6cAheObZciAWoqo6ixGlSGiP5dbBNCO)

Sly Stone started off as a DJ that fused psychedelic rock and R&B. Sly & the Family Stone found huge success throughout the 60’s with pop-soul cuts, culminating in the 1969 protest album Stand! Their fifth album, *There’s a Riot Goin’ On* was a watershed moment for progressive and political music. The album was original titled “Africa Talks to You”. When Sly heard Marvin Gaye’s “What’s  Going On”, Sly decided to change the title as a response to his album’s question--that “there’s a riot goin’ on”. One of the more significant tracks on the album, the title track, is zero seconds (4 seconds of silence on compact disks and streaming). In 1997 Sly explained this significance, stating the track doesn’t exist because he believed “there should be no more riots”. And in fact, America had been dealing with several riots across the country, brimming with anti-black police brutality, during the 60’s civil rights era. The violence Sly and countless other African-Americans were witnessing against them exacerbated their pessimism towards America. The bold album paid off with it peaking at number 1 on the pop charts, and is the 84th album on the Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

Due to tensions within the band, Sly became reclusive and recorded most of this album by himself, then sending it to other musicians to re-dub it. It’s an experimental album, dealing with the post-psychedelic soul apathy that pervaded African-American consciousness in the 1970s. *Riot* proved to be a departure from the band's earlier 60’s work, using newfound drum machine tracks to create a gloomy, darker sound. The most well-known track on the album, “Family Affair”, became the first song ever to top the pop charts with a drum machine. The album speaks to Sly’s disillusionment with the “peace and love” of the 60’s counterculture movement and neverending Vietnam War, letting loose a simmering rage. The album is experimental, at times dissonant with moments that feel loose and jarring. Oh and for the popheads-- the bassist for Sly & the Family Stone is overall iconic bassist Larry Graham aka Drake’s uncle, lol. Not to reduce his legacy, he put out lots of seminal funk songs with Sly as well as Graham Central Station, among other things. Anywho, this challenging listen will definitely end up being rewarding; to bear witness to this influential, political opus that has inspired countless musicians afterwards.
