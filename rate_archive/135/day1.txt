**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.4): I have a lot of disconnect for 1960's psychedelic music (more of a 70s music fan), but I'm really here for Sly's 1971s out-there stuff. It's bare-bones lyrics to me feel evocative of Sly's pain and defeat, that he's just like a baby. There is something innocent  yet broken in his repeated warblings throughout the album.

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): Really this is the first song out, is it longsongphobia, or do you just hate children that much

---

## Is baby being rescued by Patrick Swayze from the corner

**soggy\_charge9447** (11): love the crinkly drums, love Sly baby screeches

**MorrisFae** (10): This album is an absolute showcase of musical talent. Like yeah, we could talk forever about Sly and the rest of the family and how endlessly talented and creative they are here. But you know who else we have? Ike Turner, Bobby Womack, Larry Graham, and the legend himself motherfucking BILLY PRESTON. No one person stands out here, but they all dig up the muck in a way no one but the P-Funk all stars themselves could do.

**runaway3212** (10): This is actually perfection wait

**austrosinitic** (9.5): Those psych strings in the chorus go off HARD man probably my favorite song on the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): oh this is nice, I know it’s about pain and all that but it sounds so buttery it just makes me want to melt all over my bed

**kappyko** (9): The subtle organ chords(?) near the end are my fav bit

**bbfan132** (8): sonically nice although it didn’t feel like a standout

**Blisterman** (8): A languid track like this feels like it should come later in the album.

**Smuckles** (8): The way those bass notes are slightly bent? Little things like that get me going.

## Time to put baby in the corner

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Doesn’t do much but it’s got a nice vibe. And Sly’s raspy wail is remarkable

**2dina3dworld** (7): crying is good for you, actually! Don’t be ashamed to cry.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): They really needed to turn the mic up for this one

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): too slow for me

**frogaranaman** (7): every album had a song about kids in the tracklist

**TiltControls** (7): I could talk about how great the instrumentation is for all of Sly's songs. The song as a whole doesn't do a ton for me but that slow groove is amazing

**waluigiest** (7): you don’t listen to this song, it happens to you.

**jman457** (6.9): The original bedroom pop

**ignitethephoenix** (6.3): good vibes here but they really slacked on these lyrics

**Tadevos** (6): Haunted in a way that very nearly works for me.
**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6): That was 5 minutes but it felt like 10... and the weird screechy vocals didn't help either.

**welcome2thejam** (6): Honestly I turned around on it a lot, actively listening to it and it cranks out a hell of a jam

**babadork** (5.7): While this does a great job of setting the mood for the album, it is not something that I would normally seek out. It is a great vocal performance.

**bo_g_o** (4): why is this album so quiet

**CrimsonROSET** (0): i’m sorry i really do not like this, because not only the vocals are the way they are, the instrumental isn’t interesting enough to back up the 3 minutes where there is no singing.

## “I’m baby

**vayyiqra** (7): "I'm baby" - Sly

**seanderlust** (6.7): i'm baby [2]

**ImADudeDuh** (4): just like a baby, my attention span is not powerful enough for this

Soggy_Charge9447: I didn’t expect this to be a top track but I’m really shocked to see it as the worst. I guess I can see how the quiet and shitty mix and the slowness of the jam could make it fall into the background for someone, but it instantly grabs my attention and I get engulfed by the song every time I play it. 
Slys lyrics and performance really resonate with me, you can feel the pain of being just like a baby

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.7): I was genuinely surprised how much this bombed. I think it's a matter of life experience; I grew up on 60s/70s soul music and did musical theater, so spoken word followed by a man dramatically singing "SAAAVE THE BABIEEESS" over dramatic strings does not phase me *at all*. But it clearly phased the majority of the raters here. I love the congo drums and choral backing as well. I think it's divine!

**flavasavavandal** (8): our second song to leave. And I understand completely, the cheese can be too much, and I know this sub isn’t the biggest fan of spoken-word sections. I can’t be that sad to see it go since I gave it a relatively low score but I do wish more people gave it more of a chance and embraced the cheesiness that a lot of the genre can lean into since soul can make cheese work well. Also doesn't make this sub look good since this is the second song in a row that has left with a word for ‘young person’ in the title

---
## Insert Helen Lovejoy clip here

**AHSWeeknd** (10): That entire Vietnam War era was a tragedy. This track perfectly conveyed the burden felt with that era.

**cremeebrulee** (9.1): idgaf about most children but maybe he is making some points

**bbfan132** (9): this production is so so good

**kappyko** (9): pop the corns feed the children idk man are drag race references even en vogue anymore?? This is gorgeous

**qazz23** (9): I love the call-and-response vocals, and nice transitions to the surrounding tracks

**runaway3212** (9): fuck them kids

**waluigiest** (9): the structure and performance are so mesmerizing I almost completely forget about my aversion to most “save the kids” music

**plastichaxan** (8.8): pop the corn and feed the children

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): I long for the day this song’s lyrics aren’t relevant

**jsonphile** (8.5): normally a title like this would make me roll my eyes but it was Marvin Gaye and it was 1971 so it gets a pass

**2dina3dworld** (8): a nice song about intergenerational trauma, however, it is upsetting that I saw “save the children” and thought of a certain conspiracy theory.

**frogaranaman** (8): they really cared about the kids in the '70s huh

**musical\_pyn** (8): the build in this song is really great and ugh that saxophone is incredible

**TiltControls** (8): I love the switch up in beat with the final verse, but unfortunately I think it overshadows my enjoyment of the rest of the track a bit

**vayyiqra** (8): Another song that might seem corny to a listener today, but is he wrong? Nope. Also, I'm not surprised in the least that Janelle likes this song. I can definitely hear this album's influence on her.

## r/antinatalism

**akanewasright** (7.5): the last minute is an album highlight i think

**austrosinitic** (7.5): My opinion of this is similar to my opinion of Flyin’ High; they seam very well together but as individual songs they’re pretty much the weakest on this album. Which is funny, because there’s another very good soul album by a black artist from 1971 that has another song called Save a Children that I LOVE, which makes me sad that one of these songs wasn’t a cover of the other. Stream Pieces of a Man by Gil-Scott Heron, everyone!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I'm not a very big fan of the back and forth between the speaking and singing. But it's good.

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.4): Starts off pretty good, but I really like when it gets rolling after the two minute mark and more brass instruments start coming in

**babadork** (7): Marvin Gaye’s voice is beautiful, but I can’t lie and say that I would not rate any other song that includes someone belting about “saving the babies” much lower than this.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): fuck them kids

**FightYaAtThePrody** (7): Oh no don't save the children Marvin. They're gonna make 100 gecs a thing. Marvin! Please no! Stop! You Know not what you do!!

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the person who wrote the genius description of the song called it the least acclaimed song of the album, so lets see if it goes first

**jackisboredtoday** (7): his voice is still so good that I can’t really dislike this, but its probably the weakest thing on the album

**MorrisFae** (7): I know, I know, I respect the message, but I have a hard time getting over how corny the "save the children" phrasing and spoken word parts are. Shame because I love the choir and horns in this.

**ReallyCreative** (7): no thanks, gonna yassify them instead!

**Tadevos** (7): I gotta dock points for the spoken-sung back-and-forth of the first half of the track, and for “think of the babies” as just a general bit, which falls flat for me in a very “Heal The World” sort of way…but then—and DJDR, I know I said I wouldn’t do this bit, I’m sorry—it breaks jazz in the middle and then the song snaps back together again in that new groove. The last ninety seconds win back like a solid two points.

**jman457** (6.7): Sad that Marvin Gaye fell down the Qanon rabbit hall :pensive:

**Blisterman** (6): More of an interlude than a song. Feels incredibly relevant to climate change today.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I mean he didn’t lie, but like the execution of the song isn’t there

**MadJohnBeard** (6): a bit sappy but the message is real tho -- SAVE THE BABIES

**bo_g_o** (5): this works better as a speech than it does as a song

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): this is weird, I appreciate the message but the spoken word/sung echo format reminds me of those creepy old school cartoons that now give kids nightmares

**celladonn** (4.5): This is so overblown that I can't really take it seriously I'm afraid

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (4): I recognize he has the vocal talent but this was mostly a monologue that made me very upset (bc Fuck This World by Rina Sawayama) and also still managed to bore me.

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Noble message, but the lyrics are so trite and the spoken word thing gets really stale

**seanderlust** (3): sorry but singing lyrics that were just spoken is so corny to me. plus one point for a smooth beat switch though

**Smuckles** (0): Uh oh, 0 time! I'm not big on the spoken word, I find it cheesy. It's the one thing in the rate that I could point to and say 'I actively don't like this'. Sorry kids!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.8): I love a good saxophone

**flavasavavandal** (7): The third song to leave, and one that did grow on me quite a bit during the rate. It is one final breather to cool things down before we get to that exacerbated breath of frustration that is Inner City Blues. The use of space in the song is absolutely perfect and Marvin’s sweet voice guides us in a call for unity against hate and bigotry before telling us where to aim our resistance

---

## Good Jesus loving Christian

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Why am I scared that the inherently Catholic songs are gonna be day one outs 🥴

**bbfan132** (10): these transitions are too fucking good ugh

**freeofblasphemy** (10): Speechless

**runaway3212** (9): aretha did it better

**MorrisFae** (8.5): Again we get overtly religious again, but with a very delicate vocal, in fact one of my favorite Gaye has ever laid down. Showiness and flashiness are always welcome, but there's something to be said for a subtle pianissimo. The strings, the horns, and Gaye all fight for dominance here but temper eachother out wonderfully.

**austrosinitic** (8): It doesn’t theologically strike me as much as God is Love, but even if this song lacks a similarly spiritually subversive note or line it still features a very good, from-the-heart vocal performance; I can’t really criticize it, can I?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): marvin can you take us to church

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): [Marvin when he realized “wholy” and “holy” sound the same](https://dailyasianage.com/library/2018/11/01/1541097997_4.jpg)

**vayyiqra** (8): Unironically I appreciate how much Marvin unapologetically loves Jesus and isn't afraid to say so. I've pretty much lost my faith and broken with the church but I respect his beliefs. Besides, Jesus was pretty based.

**waluigiest** (8): I love that the whole song exists in this calm afterglow of Right On

**babadork** (7.7): I’ve listened to the songs on this album many times before doing this rate, but I somehow never recognized that this was not “Right On Pt. 2.” This song is way better than that.

**jsonphile** (7.5): I feel like I’m in Catholic school again but like, cooler

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): It feels like I should be outside at night looking up at the stars when I listen to this song.

**kappyko** (7): It's good but also I forget this comes between right on and inner city blues almost every time

**LazyDayLullaby** (7): Not one I'd listen to on its own, but it fits nicely in context

**MadJohnBeard** (7): churches should just play this

**Tadevos** (7): I always struggle with songs that attempt to address real social problems via the lens of religion. The Good News ain’t gonna solve redlining, Marvin. I have this problem with “God is Love,” too, but that song is shorter and bouncier, so. This is the worst song on the album but it’s not a full half point below the second-worst song, so I must round up to a 7.

## lap dances for satan

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): Yasss we love a bottom anthem

**TiltControls** (6.5): tbh this is one of the few on the album I don't really care for much. It's nice, but I think I just don't have the same attachment to it compared to the rest of the album. Or maybe I hate human togetherness. One of the two

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (6): It felt like in church listening to someone being very heartfelt about the worlds ills when you really wanted to leave ten minutes ago and you don’t have your faith in prayer anymore but you’re literally in a church so what did you expect to happen. I bumped it to a four though bc I like the saxophone 🎷 the instruments are great. But this also did make me feel better as someone who’s prone to existential dread and death anxiety. Even if I also was like no the Diests are right God does not give a shit.

**fadedblue09** (6): I'm not necessarily anti-religion but I found this one really uninteresting

**Smuckles** (6): It's fine, would be surprised if this was anyone's favourite track though. My ratings on this album form 3 perfect peaks, it's really weird.

**Stryxen** (6): it sounds very very pretty but it takes some of the momentum out of the album

**bo_g_o** (5.5): this just drags

**jman457** (5.4): A little too annoyingly preachy imo

**qazz23** (5): not much special about this, it kinda drags

**Blisterman** (4): This is the one I always skip.

## Saw the visualiser

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I wish some of y'all had TASTE. Sometimes less is more! The way Sly sings "My only weapon is my pen" is all I need really, to feel the power of this song. After two bummers of tracks, I can hear the glimmer of pride and defiance of Sly calling himself a "soul writer". A few people here deemed his declarations pretentious, but oh well; I think in the context of his disenfranchisement as the Nixon era ushered it, it's justified that he's a bit defiant.

**flavasavavandal** (8): I’ve seen quite a few people in the comments make fun of this song for its sparse lyrics while having the line “My only weapon is my pen”. But I feel like a lot of y’all are missing the point, a good poet says what needs to be said and nothing more to leave plenty of room open for interpretation and analysis. And as the banner comment already implies, Sly knows when not to speak and let the words he’s already spoken ring in your head and let you think about them.

---

## Does slam poetry on the side

**bbfan132** (10): love the bassline/rhythm

**fadedblue09** (10): Very unique instrumentation and while it barely has any lyrics, it still sounds powerful

**MorrisFae** (10): One of the most sampled tracks of all time, "and the things I flash on everyday" is a beautiful line.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (10): My only weapon is my pen!!!!

**ReallyCreative** (10): going to use this to shill for a couple of my favorite poets, Gwendolyn Brooks and Elizabeth Bishop!!

**runaway3212** (10): Sly really understands the art of shutting the fuck up sometimes

**Roxieloxie** (9.6): I Dont have many comments on this album unfortunately But i think so much of it is just cause its so groovy and i just simply want to listen and not say anything

**CrimsonROSET** (9): god that’s so pretentious i kinda love it

**kappyko** (9): Bop!

**TiltControls** (8.5): I realize there's not much to talk about here lyrically, but I absolutely love the opening "My only weapon is my pen. And the frame of mind I'm in". It's definitely a shift from his earlier work and this song is great to have early on to understand the bleaker tone to the album

**2dina3dworld** (8): me after doing a poetry class

**austrosinitic** (8): This is a bop put re: the lyric 'My only weapon is my pen' — correction! Comrade Ho Chi Minh says 'A poet must also learn how to lead an attack' ✊🇻🇳🛠️

**MadJohnBeard** (8): the keys drive me crazy on this one, wonder if it's Billy Preston?

**Stryxen** (8): the slayage of that funky guitar kinda carries this album’s opening stretch

**vayyiqra** (8): based

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Great guitar

**jman457** (7.4): A little self-congratulatory, considering it has very little lyrics but ill let it slide

## Has literally never read a poem in their entire life

**AHSWeeknd** (7): A song!

**jackisboredtoday** (7): for a song about being a songwriter there are surprisingly few lyrics here

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I like the guitar! His voice is actually kinda nice too.

**Blisterman** (6): Ironic that this song has almost no lyrics.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Feels bad lowballing this one because he clearly had something to say with the lyrics but also like… why aren’t there more lyrics? The instrumental break in the second half just feels like dead air

**babadork** (5.5): I cannot decide if this song is meant to be tongue-in-cheek and if I would like it more if it is.

**BeauMeringue212** (5): the electronic sound to it feels a bit off ngl

**bo_g_o** (5): that did not go anywhere

**Tadevos** (5): It’s around this point that the album starts becoming hard to talk about, because little of interest is goin’ on. Yeah, uh, it’s cool.

**welcome2thejam** (4): Unlike the last song, just couldn't catch onto the groove for this one

**cremeebrulee** (3): i feel like the sparseness of this hurts it a bit, i don't really enjoy it all

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.2): This is basically the soul version of dream pop, and it was tagged "dream pop" y'all would love it and call it "ethereal" smh. This ballad is way more compelling than that indie genre's output from the last decade

**flavasavavandal** (6.5): I’m pretty sure misandry had a huge part to play in this leaving first in the bonus rate and that’s fine, I’m not attached to this song or either of the artists.

**seanderlust** (8.3): glad i get to hear this because before this i was most familiar with these two from that one FOB song that namechecks them.

**bbfan132** (8): very pretty!!

**kappyko** (8): Bop!

**MorrisFae** (8): Alright listen I know I've dogged on adult contempo tracks before, and I'm not sure exactly what makes this one more special, but I love it. Maybe it's those tripped out drums and the spacey keys.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Balladphobia

**babadork** (7): I’ll admit my balladphobia brought my rating for this song down. It is not as well-known as this song, but I would have given the third single from this album, “Where Is the Love,” a 9.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Donny Hathaway’s This Christmas is an underrated christmas song

## Misandry

**MadJohnBeard** (6): really nice instrumentation, but still a little too much for me

**jsonphile** (5): sorry gonna be a bit balladphobic here. Both excellent singers but this is just a bit too sappy

**jman457** (4.7): kinda corny

**qazz23** (4): don't really care for this, too ballad-y and doesn't have a big hook

**Smuckles** (4): Eyelids failed me a bit here. Pretty drab.

**FightYaAtThePrody** (3): It's kinda nice but it never really moves beyond "kinda nice." By a minute in I'm already checking to see how long is left. Feels like it belongs on the soundtrack for some early 90's romantic drama movie

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I few of my bonus comments will explain some songs I DID NOT PICK, and somewhat regret. A pick I initially wanted from Diana was "My House", but felt that album should be rated (please note I have a very dodgy understanding of the rules of re-rating songs), so I thought a track off a movie would be a nice mirror to Super Fly. This is soft, bordering on easy listening and sappy, so it did not fare too well here.

**flavasavavandal** (5): I guess this is the only song in either rate that I outright dislike. I mean it’s just so boring and flavourless I’d rather listen to gospel

---

## Knows where they are going to

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Love the movie, Love the Diana Ross, Love the 70s. It’s all so iconic.

**kappyko** (10): iconic x2 if this goes out after neither one of us iconic x1 if this goes out first

**plastichaxan** (9.5): this sounds like a song my mom used to listen when i was kid and it’s killing me that i can’t place which

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oh the balladphobia is gonna hit this hard

**Roxieloxie** (9): a little bit of balladphobia i fear, sorry darj, this is still really nice tho

**celladonn** (8.5): This is so pretty

**seanderlust** (8.1): i don't bestie that's why i have google maps x

**bo_g_o** (8): pretty

**freeofblasphemy** (8): Beautiful

**bbfan132** (7.5): i used to imagine myself singing the mariah cover of this and hitting the whistle notes in front of an audience at my local variety show when i was 13... good times

**apatel27** (7): the instrumental is a bit too overpowering

**ImADudeDuh** (7): friendly reminder that Love Hangover is garbaj

**TiltControls** (7): it's cute, though I wish it was a bit more than that

## Knows they are going straight to hell

**jman457** (6.7): Its giving chair

**babadork** (6.5): She sounds great, but I can’t convince myself to like most easy listening.

**jsonphile** (6): Diana I love you but this ain’t exactly your best work

**MorrisFae** (6): I adore Diana, but this song just doesn't do it for me. Yeah it's very well performed and well put together, but the sappy adult contemporary ballads just slide right off my brain.

**Smuckles** (5): I'm old, but I'm not old enough to feel passionate about this. Supreme's rock.

**vayyiqra** (5): I felt nothing sorry

## Doesn’t know where this song is going 

**nt96** (10): I don't know where this is going to but I've done enough rates to know that Popheads has shown me a lot of disappointment.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.1): Another track of Sly's warped humor, as well as paranoia. "You don't know who turned you in", speaks to the paranoia of an era of wiretapping and blackmailing civil rights activists and Black Panthers. As well as the repeated "Brave and strong" suggesting a nod to soldiers losing their lives in the unending Vietnam War. Another dark and weird journey I'm happy to experience.

**flavasavavandal** (8): Ended the empowerment anthems of the late 2000s/early 2010s

---

## Doesn’t need to listen to Firework by Katy Perry because they are already brave & strong

**AHSWeeknd** (10): That bass guitar, ugh so iconic

**MorrisFae** (10): More than anybody, I think of Prince as being a devotee to Sly Stone first and foremost. And this song distills so much of what he would later perfect: that punchy bass in the lead, the thin scratchy guitars, the jabbing bleats, the unhinged vocal flourishes, all while maintaining a tight structure and making sure the groove comes first and foremost.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): two words that have never been used to describe me

**kappyko** (9): I think an underrated aspect of this album is just that it is very very COOL to listen to. Like idk how you can't hear this stuff going on and just be meh on it bc it's too cool

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.7): we need the hosts to play Jill Scott - Watching Me after this

**bbfan132** (8): enjoyed this!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): he really likes cowboys huh

**musical\_pyn** (8): This song has a really strong start and peters only slightly in my opinion

**TiltControls** (8): A very bleak outlook on life, but reading about the mindset of Sly at the time, definitely understand the song a bit more coming from his pov

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): so i can tell i would not survive for i am cowardly and weak

**jman457** (7.7): Really flips american values on its head

**runaway3212** (7.6): the band literally caries every single song omg

**austrosinitic** (7): I think this and Time are my least favorites on this album because idk the subtle, groovy production just doesn't work as well on them but hey that's not to say either of them are bad

**babadork** (7): I think this has the best lyrics, so it is disappointing that I can’t understand most of them. It would be great if it wasn’t so lo-fi.

**Smuckles** (7): Growing up brave and strong... MINMO!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): There's just something that isn't clicking with me and I don't know what it is.

**vayyiqra** (7): I was going to say this was fillerish before seeing what the hosts wrote about it and this is why we read lyrics in rates, kids !

## Cowardly & Weak to engage with the song

**fadedblue09** (6.5): He kinda sounds unintelligible at times but I enjoy the brass

**seanderlust** (6.3): I think I like the concept of this album - a hazy, washed out production reflective of the time sly was spending in bed. that said and in spite of some very interesting and progressive for the time instrumentals, it is just failing to catch me. this song is a very good example of that

**Blisterman** (6): Did we skip a track?

**freeofblasphemy** (6): Wish this had a fuller mix

**Tadevos** (6): This song is just not memorable at all, but the—the chorus—the A section? It’s quite good in a quasi-James Brown kinda way.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): With a lot of the songs in this rate I’m torn on how to score them because I can respect their messages and how raw/personal the artists were willing to get, but on a musical level they don’t connect. I think this is the epitome of that because Sly is clearly going through it here and he brings up some good points but at the same time this just like… doesn’t sound good to me? Like “Sly recorded this lying on a bed with a tape recorder” is a cool backstory but if it doesn’t translate to a song I enjoy listening to (and not just in a “this is a bop!” kind of way) then I have to acknowledge that.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.9): As someone who ragged incessantly on how turgid some Alice in Chains songs can be (in the indieheads grunge rate), I love how formless and turgid this is. Sometimes you just wanna be sad and listen to some funk.

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): One of the best atmospheres on the album is found on Time. Dark and eerie in a way this album spends most of its runtime being but rarely comes this close as the hollow happiness present on other songs is just gone. Maybe to represent the comedown from optimism in the 60’s or to represent an actual comedown.

---

## Time After Time by Cyndi Lauper

**AHSWeeknd** (10): If someone gives this an eleven, I’ll give them a gold award.

**bbfan132** (10): love how passionate this is combined with the lo-fi/mellow sound

**BeauMeringue212** (10): this dark downtempo electronic sound feels way ahead of its time

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): okay the raw sound really works here

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ended fads zimmer

**MorrisFae** (10): I can't get over how well I love the way the vocals were recorded on this one. The way they waver in and out adds a trippy element to this track and the wah guitars only further that.

**runaway3212** (10): AMAZING OMFG EVERYONE DIED

**TiltControls** (9.5): A lot of Sly songs seem not to have a ton of lyrics, but what's there can really hit. There's something about this song that really uses what little it has to say in such an effective manner. It's a bit slower than some of the other tracks so praying against balladphobia (even if its not really a ballad but we'll see if the scores care).

**kappyko** (9): The drum machine pitter patter alongside the building organ tones provides the perfect backdrop for Sly's psychedelic poetry. Used to be my least favorite and now I kind of appreciate it way more

**waluigiest** (9): it’s really cool how they stretch this

**seanderlust** (8.7): "all he needs is a rating" working on it king x

**jsonphile** (8.5): the singer sounds like he’s making up the melody as he goes. That’s a plus though, to be clear

**ReallyCreative** (8.3): vibey, but the vocal ad libs keep you awake

**celladonn** (8): I like the unique and very atmospheric sound of this song, there's something quite spooky about it

**fadedblue09** (8): Kinda intrigued to see the music sheet for this cuz it sounds so wild despite being midtempo

**freeofblasphemy** (8): A vibe

**frogaranaman** (8): what time is it

**MadJohnBeard** (8): really starting to feel like something bad is gonna happen

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8): I always forget this song is sandwiched between Smilin' and Spaced Cowboy, but it's not bad.

**babadork** (7.6): This is my favorite of the more atmospheric songs on this album.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.5): I also don’t believe time is the answer most of the time except sometimes

## time for you to get a watch

**CrimsonROSET** (7): what even is time anyway

**Smuckles** (7): Keyboards!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I don't know what his obsession is with the weird screechy vocal thing, but it needs to stop.

**vayyiqra** (7): I'm running low on material for comments by now ngl sorry but this is nice

**jman457** (6.7): invented singing in cursive

**Blisterman** (6): I’d completely forgotten this song exists.

**qazz23** (4): the organ is decent but kind of a filler track

**Tadevos** (4): Yeah whatever I guess I don’t know these songs aren’t even bad enough for me to give them legit low scores

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.3): I love how people in the comments have picked up on the underlying sadness of this song. It didn't fare too well in the rate, but I love how bizarre it is. Broke: freak folk. Woke: freak funk. So wonderful this album inspired the likes of George Clinton, Prince, D'Angelo and many more.

**flavasavavandal** (7): Yeah Sly’s yodelling, while I can appreciate it, is maybe not the greatest thing on Earth

---

## Yodelling Champ

**2dina3dworld** (10): Seattle Yodel for 70s people

**AHSWeeknd** (10): yodelling on a soul track is why Sly & The Family Stone were and continue be iconic

**babadork** (10): I interpret it as being a commentary on racism in southern rock. The song is better the worse the yodeling is. I feel equally as deserving of scorn for giving sarcastic yodeling a 10 as anyone that gives this their lowest rating.

**cremeebrulee** (10): its ca- [GUNSHOT]

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): Yodeling is very funky, very cool

**ImADudeDuh** (10): why did the second half of this album absolutely stomp the first half

**kappyko** (10): Kind of a great contrast between the absurdity of the yodelling and the deep deep sadness behind every song on this album. That groove at the end mwaah

**MorrisFae** (10): Managing to sound both VERY Family Stone, and yet like a completely different band, here we see Sly weaponizing yodeling of all things. I love the way he laughs out half the lines, it almost gives me Frank-N-Furter vibes.

**Roxieloxie** (10): daisybopin

**bbfan132** (9.5): the yodeling… :listening:

**nt96** (9.4): See ya Spaced Cowboy

**akanewasright** (9): Kacey Musgraves has never yodeled once in her life

**CrimsonROSET** (9): spike spiegel if you're reading this i'm in love with you and please contact me this thursday at 9pm when i am free here is my phone number call me when i am free at this thursday at 9pm when i am free

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): See you Spaced Cowboy

**MadJohnBeard** (9): this is the real shit - so glad this exists, I wanna know where the inspiration came from lol

**musical\_pyn** (9): kacey musgraves sure sounds different here

**Own-Photograph-4642** (9): Drunked yodeling at it's best.

**runaway3212** (9): kacey musgraves could never

**austrosinitic** (8.5): I did not expect to hear yodelling on a psych soul record (well my favorite psych soul record has God killing Prince at the end for being too horny so this is nothing too out of the ordinary) but yeah this is weirdly good I'll take it

**celladonn** (8.5): I kind of stan the yodeling

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): invented Cowboy Bebop omg

**jman457** (8.4): Such a great influence of country/western and funk and soul

**apatel27** (8): Yodelling was unexpected

**BeauMeringue212** (8): he just wants to get Spaced... Cowboy

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (8): insert Kacey joke

**vayyiqra** (8): One of the saddest songs on the album, which I'm here for. See you space cowboy....

**waluigiest** (8): Kacey Musgraves if she tried drugs. Wait no

## Jealous of Sly’s yodelling

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Not amazing but has a cool vibe

**jsonphile** (7.5): well this is the most depressing yodeling I’ve ever heard. But to be fair I haven’t heard much yodeling in my life, not something I seek out usually.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): grove slam work it back

**1998tweety** (7): ended Kacey

**Blisterman** (7): Second best yodelling of the 70s after Hocus Pocus - Focus.

**frogaranaman** (7): is this a Jojo's reference

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is one of those songs that makes you go “were they on drugs when they made this?” but in this case we actually know the answer

**MNREDR** (7): Okay I definitely needed to take some substance before listening to this.

**Smuckles** (7): Is this the best song with yodelling in it? Tough questions being raised here.

**fadedblue09** (6): weakest of the album for me. The yodeling is cute though

**qazz23** (6): Yodelaydeeeee, yodelaydeeeee

**TiltControls** (6): Don't know if this'll be an unpopular opinion, but I'm having trouble getting past the yodeling. There's a solid song here (especially the other lyrics), so maybe I'll turn around on it, but right now it's facing the problem some tracks on the other albums have where everything else is good enough that this kind of gets lost for me. (Though I do appreciate changing it up!)

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6): I'm sorry, but the yodelling is just... no...

**welcome2thejam** (6): Can't say I love the folksy blueness of this, but I super respect the move

**seanderlust** (5.7): was NOT expecting yodeling on this album but here we are

**ignitethephoenix** (5): now why is there yodelling in my soul album rate

**plastichaxan** (4): mmm i heavily considered giving this a 0 but then went and looked at the songs i've 0d before and it's not that bad i guess

**ReallyCreative** (4): this cowboy can have his space

**Tadevos** (4): I understand that the yodeling is, uh, the point, but it simply Does Not Work for me. Especially when it jumps up to double-time in the chorus? Yeah, no, it’s hokey.

**bo_g_o** (0): I don't know what this song needed to make it better but yodeling was not the answer

## Gave Curtis their love

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Invented hi-hats

**bo_g_o** (10): any song with love song in the title is guaranteed to be fantastic

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): yup it's a love song all right

**kappyko** (10): Okay!

**austrosinitic** (9.5): Is this the least thematic song on the album? Yes but God that doesn't change the fact it goes off so hard

**bbfan132** (9.5): the parts with the full band <3

**fadedblue09** (9): The combination of dramatic orchestrals and flavorful funk....just excellent

**runaway3212** (9): lana spilled when she cover this

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): ed sheeran on plus:

**jman457** (8.6): a Groovy track with iconic production

**frogaranaman** (8): BOP, I'm not giving you my love tho ur dead sorry

**musical\_pyn** (8): Another really great isntrumental, though I think the song could have benefitted from more lyrical depth
.
**waluigiest** (8): obsessed with The Lick at 3:13

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is so lush idk what else to say

## Broke Curtis’ heart

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Is this about love?

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): The production is sooo good. Did he produce this himself?

**Blisterman** (7): A classic smooth funk jam.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i thank him for the (love song) in the title, otherwise how was i supposed to guess what this was about

**qazz23** (7): kind of repetitive

**TiltControls** (7): another song (seems to be one on each of the albums) that isn't a bad song per se, but really doesn't standout compared to the rest of the tracks on the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): did he just invent ASMR?

**seanderlust** (6.3): it feels like a pretty standard love song. a phenomenally executed one...but a standard love song nonetheless

**babadork** (6): I keep forgetting that this isn’t an instrumental. There’s some good lyrics, but it doesn’t match the storytelling on the other songs.

**welcome2thejam** (6): This is the sound of every porn soundtrack

**BeauMeringue212** (5): didn't really vibe with this one, felt more like an interlude

## Saw the film but doesn’t talk about the bathtub sex scene

**Tadevos** (8): Something Fun about the movie is that Georgia, Priest’s woman, goes a long way towards grounding him on his way out of The Life, she’s very important to him, Of Course, but he also spends half the movie fuckin’ on some white woman and the movie doesn’t do much to, like, comment on that. The white woman he’s fuckin’ on is, ofcourse, one of the seductive pleasures of the hustlin’ life, so that’s symbolic or whatever, but he still spends half the movie fuckin’ on some white woman. We meet the white woman like half an hour before we meet Georgia. I dunno. Anyway I’ve been often told this song is a touch too busy to actually be sexy and I’ve come to understand, even if that busyness keeps the song fresh to me

## Ain’t no mountain high enough

**MorrisFae** (11): I don't discuss lyrics often in these ratings because so often they're secondary to me (I still love them but I'm less interested in discussing them). I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about how much I love how Flyin' High is written. Even if the song isn't structured like a gospel spiritual, the lyrics are written with quite a few similar phrasings and cadences. The song sounds as if he's singing both to God for help and to the drugs themselves to continue helping him feel right. Then we hit the climactic: "well I know I'm hooked, my friend, to the boy who makes slaves out of men" and the concept ties together phenomenally. This is an utterly sublime and perfect piece of music.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The atmosphere sold through the tone of the music and Marvin Gaye’s vocals…. I’m at a loss for words.

**BeauMeringue212** (10): this might be my favourite "drug" song on the rate. There's such a sense of weariness and escapism to it

**kappyko** (10): YASSSSS

**TiltControls** (10): I could speak about this song, but I'm sorry I can't not highlight this passage that I found written on Genius: "'Flying high' refers to the high effect one gets when consuming drugs, as Marvin doesn’t actually fly."

**waluigiest** (10): the way the bass and drums feel so untethered is excellent. It just creates this visceral emotional experience

**bbfan132** (9.5): that transition…. yes.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): It’s amazing how well this segues from What’s Happening Brother, such a smooth listening experience. This can be said for most of the transitions on the album tbh

**qazz23** (9): nice bassline throughout

**seanderlust** (9): it's not travis scott (feat. toro y moi) but I suppose it's okay /s

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): demi to the extraterrestrials, probably

**freeofblasphemy** (8): I just love how Marvin sings

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): makes me think of that scene from *Last Holiday (2004)* where Queen Latifah is on a plane and “Feeling Good” plays

**jsonphile** (8): Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez at the end of High School Musical

**MadJohnBeard** (8): perfectly high ( or too high ...)

**vayyiqra** (8): I didn't know Marvin had struggled with drug use before this rate but given the time period, it's sadly not unexpected.

**welcome2thejam** (8): The percussion in the background kinda remind me of the taps of military drums. Even if it's not explicit, creates an interesting story by coming after the Vietnam vet's song

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.8): Reaching higher ground

**austrosinitic** (7.5): I admittedly prefer Superfly as an album to What’s Going On, so musically, this hasn’t grown on me as much as that entire record despite dealing with very similar themes. That being said, Marvin does it well, and given the drug addictions he (along with his co-rated artist, Sly) he himself ended up prey to, this only becomes even more darkly, solemnly sublime. Wouldn’t be surprised if it influenced Curtis himself.

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): wait this song is about drugs? could have fooled me

**Tadevos** (7.5): Dude this song sounds like a dream sequence. Just, like, straight vibe. The snare flourishes between verses, the harmonies, that JAMES JAMERSON BASS LINE C’moooon

**Blisterman** (7): It can only suffer from following the two “What's” before it.

**fadedblue09** (7): I get what he's going for but this feels uninteresting. Curtis' Cocaine song did it better

## Is in a valley low enough

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6.5): Very... bland. It just need a little more spice.

**jman457** (6.4): Voice of viagra, lyrics of libido killer

**bo_g_o** (6): okay this key is starting to get a bit old

**runaway3212** (6): this is just a worse what's happening brother

**Smuckles** (6): S'alright! It's one of the middle tracks that don't hit me as much of the others.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (5): this song just reminds me of that clip from a Kanye song saying “it cannot always be Day”

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.7): For whatever reason, I REALLY like how this song starts. ha ha ha ha! It kind of sounds like a children's show theme song. It's also clearly about running away from problems, sadness, etc. Love the mixture of sad lyrics and brighter music.

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): this is just so tongue-n-cheek I kinda have to adore it. Taking the formula of an earlier song of the band to mock those earlier songs as Sly comes to grasp with the fact that while his intentions were good, his songs could never have changed anything, making this a very harrowing listen.

---

## Ha-ha Ha-ha

**akanewasright** (10): I really love the parts of the album where it’s just obvious that Sly is not okay at all, because same

**babadork** (10): This is the best song on the album. While it is one of the songs on the album that reflect on his earlier music, it is also very relatable and could be about drug use or depression. If you know about Sly Stone’s life after recording this album, it becomes even more haunting.

**fadedblue09** (10): One of the album's more relatively conventional moments but still has enough flavor to stand out

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): That's are the same kind of "haha" that I hit my crush with when they make a lame joke but I'm trying to make them feel good about themselves

**kappyko** (10): Proto Twee Pop (my personal favorite on the album!!!!! genuinely beautiful)

**MorrisFae** (10): Again we have a track that sounds like a totally different band but bleeds Stone. I love when Rose gets a good lead vocal and she rides that horn line beautifully.

**qazz23** (10): Love the horn melodies (11 candidate)

**Roxieloxie** (10): just like me

**TiltControls** (10): PH moment: giving the highest score on the album to the one with the female vocalist (but really I love this song's upbeat tone, with its weird, almost mockingly bleak lyricism.)

**bbfan132** (9.5): short but v warm/wonderful to listen to!!!

**jsonphile** (9.5): Gotta love the ha ha ha ha hee hee hee hee

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.5): Just delightful - ha ha, ha ha; hee hee, hee hee - but then the lyrics hit with this tension straining against the upbeat melody

**AHSWeeknd** (9): it’s good but it shouldn’t have been the penultimate track (because of the beat).

**Blisterman** (9): A throwback to the 60s Sly and the Family Stone, but with darker lyrics under the hippy surface.

**Smuckles** (9): Quintessential soul cool.

**welcome2thejam** (9): It's like they're trying to create a classic soul song, but what should be silky smooth sounds awfully grainy, the loving lyrics turn to mocking, and it just ends up a twisted and distorted version of itself

**runaway3212** (8.5): again the band just slays so fucking much I cannot

**MadJohnBeard** (8): sly got me smilin' again

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Saaaaaaax

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Easily one of my favorites from them!

**jman457** (7.3): Maybe the synthpop cover from the 80’s would have done better

## Look at you fooling you

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I sense potential in this one, if it had been polished up a bit more it would have been a 10 because the lyrics and melody are nice so I wish they were emphasized a bit more. Like this is a song that deserves more than the recording it got.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): boppier than the other stuff but I kinda don’t love the vocals

**CrimsonROSET** (6): these lyrics… is it camp

**bo_g_o** (5): so many of these songs just don't go anywhere

**plastichaxan** (5): this was almost yass but then it wasnt

**seanderlust** (5): this is fine save for the laughing lyrics, which for some reason bother me

**Tadevos** (3.5): The little laugh annoys me much more than it ought to, which is a shame, because the instrumental breaks between the verses are pretty dang good.

**2dina3dworld** (0): this sounds like the Laughing Gnome but without the stupid gnome voice that makes the Laughing Gnome campy

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): Once you realise that “Smilin’” refers to Sly taking drugs to cope with the turmoil in his life you will never unhear the bleakness in this song, absolutely spine-chilling

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): Maybe by now, as I write this on December 15th, I would have bumped my score a bit more. But on first listen, the "You caught me smiling" annoyed me greatly. I don't know why this one and not Runnin' Away, go figure. But I loved the other parts of Smilin', like Sly's improvisational wails. But it's warmed on me.

---

## Smiling With No Teeth (great album)

**FightYaAtThePrody** (11): It's like Sly just opens the curtains of his filthy bedroom for a moment to let a little bit of light in.

**akanewasright** (10): Why are all the drug related songs in this rate so good?

**bbfan132** (10): holy shit the vocals… so good

**Smuckles** (10): If I wanted to convince people of Sly's majesty I would start with this song. If you somehow don't enjoy thisthen this entire genre may be lost on you.

**BeauMeringue212** (9): me when my manager sees me clock back from lunch red eyed

**Blisterman** (9): This one just gives me nice summer vibes.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): 😄

**fadedblue09** (9): Every few seconds or so, i hear something new with instrumental, and I'm here for it

**kappyko** (9): The same comment as Brave & Strong

**MorrisFae** (9): This album is such a dark, grimy, and unrelenting piece of music, there's something nice about the unit as it was in its current place, making a song that throws back to the poppier and more fun early Family Stone material. But of course the rough vocal recordings that define the album, and that bass that won't let you look away from it set it apart further.

**musical\_pyn** (9): that first "you caught me smilin" is definitely my favorite moment on the entire album, maybe in this entire rate

**qazz23** (9): funky and playful

**seanderlust** (9): this kind of reminds me of thundercat in some ways

**soggy\_charge9447** (9): want a Tyler the Creator monotone rap verse after this chorus

**austrosinitic** (8.5): Works great as one of the more tender moments on this album

**jman457** (8.3): such a rich production

**2dina3dworld** (8): me after Judith Collins was eliminated by the National Party

**MadJohnBeard** (8): brief ray of sunshine

**vayyiqra** (8): So what I'm learning is a lot of this album is deceptively upbeat funk songs about drugs and being unhappy.

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Kinda meanders but still sweet

**TiltControls** (7.5): Another bleak song (hmm I sense a theme to this album). Don't know if it pulls it off as well as some of the other tracks, but the instrumentation is top-notch

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): That was such a cute song!

**babadork** (7.4): I don’t get how this was a single. It is upbeat, but it also gives me the creeps.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): caught me frownin’ cause of that mixing

## Smile by Katy Perry (mediocre at best)

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Some nice ideas here but it could have used more focus, I think this is where Sly doing most of the songs alone failed the album because this song clearly would have been better if everyone had been in the room jamming and collaborating together.

**runaway3212** (6): you caught me yawning

**Tadevos** (6): This song is, like, almost pretty, but this album can’t commit to prettiness in like Curtis and Marvin do. Like, the prettiness is more sentimental than sonic, if that makes sense.

**Stryxen** (2): this song just sounds so messy i’m not sure i get it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This is one of my favorite songs of all time. Gladys' powerful alto voice is really the bridge between gospel and pop music in the 60s and 70s. This is one of Gladys Knight & the Pips first breakout songs. I could listen to Gladys sing for hours. And here, much like other songs in the rate, I love a maudlin ballad that would later be covered by Barbra Streisand. Man, I love this song. So, my day is ruined and my disappointment is immeasurable.

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): a song for when you get a boyfriend/girlfriend and want to annoy everyone with your attempts at cuteness

## Can’t stand to see this go

**bbfan132** (10): gladys <3 <3 love this song

**BeauMeringue212** (10): me when I ghost a guy who is also gonna ghost me

**CrimsonROSET** (10): darj spilled calling this one of the best songs of all time tbh

**kappyko** (10): iconic x2 if this goes out after theme from mahogany iconic x1 if this goes out first

**MorrisFae** (10): Gladys! If there's one thing I can always get behind it's a mature breakup song like this. It's not a "you fucked up" or a "I found someone better" it's a "we both know it's over, but it's still comfortable". It's an ode to commitment and ease over passion, it's heartbreaking, but it's universal.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): i swear if balladphobia strikes this song down, i’m burning the sub to the ground

**AHSWeeknd** (9): That’s when you need a third person to say it for you.

**qazz23** (9): soulful and haunting, good strings!

**Roxieloxie** (9): [2]

**welcome2thejam** (9): Great vocals. Love them exploring the period right before a relationship ends, where you can see it coming but are still dragging your feet to get there

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): Parenthetical song titles (are the best)

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): ok but stream Imagination the album for clear skin

**TiltControls** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4_SSEdKZ5g

**jsonphile** (7.5): it’s no Midnight Train to Georgia

**vayyiqra** (7): pretty

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): There's no way I could not have a Patti song on this bonus rate. Patti THEE Philly Legend. Her solo singles really flourished in the 80s (hope we can one day rate "New Attitude"), so digging into the 70s I tried to stay away from Labelle cuts like Lady Marmalade (the based pick would have been the Labelle collab album with Laura Nyro--everyone stream "Gonna Take A Miracle"). But this is a grand, simmering soul ballad that only Patti could deliver as she does what has to be done towards the end of it. Queen shit!

**flavasavavandal** (7): Friendship ended with Patti, now Betty is my best friend

**Roxieloxie** (9): me reminding myself when /u/rickikardashian and /u/akanewasright make me listen to taylor albums for rates

**welcome2thejam** (9): Not that it wasn't already good, but this song hits another level when that backup choir shows up and just keeps rising higher and higher

**babadork** (8): It would probably be more accurate to my opinion to rate this lower, but her live performances of this song are too amazing for me to go lower than an 8.

**bbfan132** (8): patti is such a good singer!!!

Smuckles: It's a novelty that I see flairs so, what's up with Sam Prekop?
[/r/popheads/comments/rioe77/70s_soul_classics_rate_reveal_day_1_theres_a_rate/hoz70h2/]

=====

Tadevos: Sam Prekop made two of the most immaculate, well-played, perfectly recorded indie-rock/jazz-pop records of all time around the turn of the last century.  The melodies are sublime and the perfomances are just *frictionless.*  The sensibility and subtlety of his writing and performance is just phenomenal.  It's not, like, swing-for-the-fences type stuff--it's generally very tasteful in a way I guess could turn people off--but if you stick with 'em, *Sam Prekop* and *Who's Your New Professor* are both rich, rewarding albums.  I think everyone, indiehead and pophead alike, should listen to them both.

Smuckles: Jazz pop sounds fun! Tasteful sounds :( It's on the list!

FightYaAtThePrody: Unfortunately, after what you did to Sly and his beautiful family today Tad, I'm going to have to avoid listening to Sam Prekop for the rest of my life. So sorry :(

(btw did you ever see this [interview] (https://crackmagazine.net/article/profiles/black-country-new-road/) with BCNR before? I remembered it the other day when they came on in a playlist and it's got a couple of wild lines in it)

Tadevos: I'd not.  Thank you!  It's so weird to read a dispatch from the LP1 press cycle when we're like two months away from LP2.  Kind of weird to get "read a book'd" by Isaac Particlesofbread.  What odd characters they are and continue to be.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.3): We need to rate a Bruce Springsteen album in 2022 (he wrote this song). The lyrics are ehhh by modern day, but The Pointer Sisters sell it. I also deeply regret having a song in the bonus rate that was covered on Glee.

**flavasavavandal** (8): Ok but have you ever realised that Automatic is the greatest song ever

---
## A burning passion for this song


**bo_g_o** (10): we need to rate Bruce Springsteen

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i think go to a doctor about that

**ImADudeDuh** (10): friendly reminder that Pointer Sisters - Break Out deserves to be rated

**MorrisFae** (10): What a fun groove and build, it's no Pointer Brothers, that riff that leads up to the hook is so much fun. There's so much showtune to this track too, I can't help but love it.

**Roxieloxie** (10): HORNY BOP

**TiltControls** (10): oh shit another 11

**babadork** (9.5): I’ve loved this song for years, but I never listened to the Bruce Springsteen version. I’m trying to be more open-minded about Springsteen, but I’m listening to the version with rerecorded vocals and he is still doing a weird Elvis impression.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.1): this song has me thinking of a specific someone. (chuckles) i'm in danger

**bbfan132** (9): the piano works perfectly here!! happy i discovered this

**celladonn** (9): Quite a bop

**kappyko** (9): fire... i need you to burn

**welcome2thejam** (9): Hold up, this was originally a Springsteen song? Yeah, that checks out. This version's pretty fantastic though, the instrumentation adds a lot and it translates really well into a girl group song. Plus, let's just say changing the lyrics to this perspective is probably the best for all of us and leave the discourse far far away

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.9): not this being Baby It’s Cold Outside (The Pointer Sisters Version)

**jman457** (8.3): rom com realness

**AHSWeeknd** (8): There was a third pointer sister?

## A burning desire to set this song on fire

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): So good when the piano comes in

**jsonphile** (7): okay I’m gonna be honest I only knew the Springsteen version despite the fact that apparently this was a #2 hit. Gonna be misogynist here and say Springsteen’s is better, I prefer his more low-key, intimate way of performing it

**nt96** (7): I only know these girls cuz of GTA Vice City.

**qazz23** (6): Like the harmonies but it's kind of repetitive

**seanderlust** (3.3): some of these lyrics uhhhhhhhhh didn't age well

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.7): Lo-fi beats to pray to (soul version)

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): I mean, I wasn’t expecting the religious songs to last past day 1. And considering it isn’t even 2 minutes and acts more as a prelude to Mercy Mercy Me. I’m shocked it almost got into day 2. But I guess Slyphobia, the upbeatness of it and the fact that this song is kinda catchy helped keep it in for a minute. I ended up preferring the slower version that helped accentuate some of the melancholy on a song about which he views God as his true father

---

## 1 John 4:7-21

**2dina3dworld** (10): this was an 11 contender. I’m not going to go into the philosophy of religion but I know for me, the idea of an all comforting father is something that makes me feel warm and fuzzy. However, the idea of loving all as an individual is something that doesn’t quite resonate with me - not because I’m about to launch into a homophobic rant, but because you’re under no obligation to forgive abusers and those who have hurt you beyond what you can forgive.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is probably a day one out but it deserves better.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): christian camp bop (compliment)

**MNREDR** (10): I'm not even a Christian but this was so inspiring. Why does it cut off at the end like that though :(

**MorrisFae** (10): There's something about Soul and Gospel music that helps me stomach the overtly religious lyrics better than I normally would. And in fact, the weight they add to what's already a perfect groove? Beautiful. Not just an interlude, for sure!

**Tadevos** (9.5): Hahaaaaaa this song is sublime. The vocal melody! The transitions into and out of it! The harmony on “give each other loooove, oh yeah!” Oh yeah!

**austrosinitic** (9): I think the line 'Don't call God my father, because God is my friend' is really interesting because in it Marvin is kind of theologically subverting the patriarchal, hierarchical framing of god that often affects POC, women and queer people (or any intersection of the three)! By rejecting said framing and calling God his 'friend' Marvin is not only responding to his own personal trauma with his father, but also arguably bringing his conception of his faith closer to the radically egalitarian philosophy that CHristianity was at its inception

**bbfan132** (9): suddenly i’m religious

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): gives me warm feelings

**MadJohnBeard** (9): This song is absolutely infectious - Would love it to be longer

**musical\_pyn** (9): as someone who has a mixed relationship with religion, this is such a good example of what I find good and worth pursuing in faith and it sure helps that the music is also incredible here

**welcome2thejam** (9): Well, this became a song with a shitton of baggage, huh?

**jsonphile** (8.5): see I would like church so much more if this was the music they’d play

**TiltControls** (8.5): Some of this is super sad knowing what happens later in his life, but I appreciate the optimism - even if I've never been particularly religious I've always appreciated the "do nice things for people" aspect

**Blisterman** (8): Foreplay for the song to come.

**kappyko** (8): He's right

**qazz23** (8): nice short song, another seamless transition

**runaway3212** (8): Twice's impact

**vayyiqra** (8): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E-zFAjrWQAMs8HK?format=jpg&name=900x900

**jman457** (7.6): And his dad still killed him??

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The superior religion themed song on this album

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this blended so seamlessly to the last song, either that or I am tired

**seanderlust** (7.5): honestly i'm not usually huge on gospel music but this is really great

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I love this one! I think it's my favorite Marvin song so far.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): a song less than two minutes?? Marvin’s pinkpantheress era omg

**plastichaxan** (7.3): unrelatable title but he sounds great

## Satan is love
**babadork** (7): I prefer the longer version that was released with the “What’s Going On” single. This version feels a little rushed.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): we will absolutely drag tf out of your father

**waluigiest** (7): I almost missed this song

**bo_g_o** (6.5): this rate is making me learn that christian music doesn't have to be garbage

**freeofblasphemy** (6.5): Why does this end so abruptly

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): oh no I’m giving all the overtly religious songs bad scores, oh no

**1998tweety** (6): and also a woman

**BeauMeringue212** (5.5): me after conversion therapy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): When you're black but also a former otaku so sometimes this song reminds me of Cowboy Bebop - Tank! (compliment). Also in the movie you get to see Youngblood doing some karate over a fence, iconic.

**flavasavavandal** (9): no not the instrumentalphobia pushing this out on day 1. It’s an energetic instrumental that covers Young Blood chasing a junkie who just robbed him

---

## Instrumentphiles

**2dina3dworld** (10): instruments go brrrrrr

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Giving this a ten because this is probably gonna be a day one out and it deserves better

**bbfan132** (10): i need to listen to this soundtrack again and again after this

**bo_g_o** (10): interludephobia will not be tolerated either

**kappyko** (10): me when i run after a janet stan. Serious Comment: this is AWESOME in the car. I played it with my trumpeter friend guy and he was like those opening notes must be annoying to play

**MorrisFae** (10): goddamn what a track, a funky blaxploitation take on a classic Bond-style instrumental. It also showcases one of this album's strongest points: the attack of the drums. Every drum fill sounds absolutely vicious.

**rickikardashian** (10): interlude solidarity

**runaway3212** (10): This being the biggest slay ever omg, maybe the problem is the singer

**akanewasright** (9): THE DRAMA

**austrosinitic** (9): Sadly, my brain is an ADHD-addled mess and I never recall 99% of instrumentals, but even if I can’t reproduce this one of my head I clearly remember just how chilling to the bone its piano-tinged thrill sounds like. Ergo, it gets a high score.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): https://i.imgur.com/H0JATDi.png

**nootnoot781** (9): now i need to delve further into his discog because so far it’s been immaculate

**ReallyCreative** (9): just say no to instrumentalphobia!!!

**Roxieloxie** (9): i love music

**waluigiest** (9): WOW the brass is tasty

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): I like when a song sounds exactly like what you'd expect from the title

**babadork** (8): I’m generally not someone that listens to film scores, but this song could persuade me to change that. I like that it is obviously written for a chase scene.

**nt96** (8): Suddenly I'm in a chase scene driving down an alley in a blaxploitation film.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Very tense and climactic, really feels like an action-packed chase scene. That last note is hair-raising

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): A nice little dose of excitement

**jman457** (7.5): Let's hope interludephobia doesn't sink this albums avg too much

**Tadevos** (7.5): Not a lot to say about this one other than there’s no reason that string orchestration or piano arrangement should go this hard on this one.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): You know. I really don't like instrumentals that much, but this one bops.

**FightYaAtThePrody** (7): I like the way they feel the need to state that the songs are instrumentals in the title. Like, as if we wouldn't realize and they didn't wanna disappoint anyone who hangs around for the whole song just waiting for that first sweet Mayfield lyric

**LazyDayLullaby** (7): JP Morgan Chase

**welcome2thejam** (7): If more interludes were like this maybe raters wouldn't be so bad with em

## Instrumentalphobes

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): the better instrumental here for sure

**Blisterman** (6): Classic 70s wicka wicka wah chase music.

**MadJohnBeard** (6): quality instrumental, but Think is better

**Smuckles** (6): The first time in the soundtrack you realise you're listening to a soundtrack.

**TiltControls** (6): The dilemma of not wanting to tank instrumental/interludes so their scores aren't way too low, but also not wanting to give them straight 10s and have them Tina Taught Me'd pt. 2. But I will say this has got an incredible rhythm, so while I don't want it to beat out much else I do hope it still scores high

**vayyiqra** (6): tbh I always zone out during this song and do not remember hearing it at all but I think it's okay?

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): [me when an artist includes an interlude on an album not knowing that decades later a group of reddit users will include it in a numbers based game on a pop sub](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/464/965/d83.png)

**Stryxen** (5): help i keep missing it when i’m listening to the album cos i’m busy thinking about how good freddie’s dead is
