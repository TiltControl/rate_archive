**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I know a few people have struggled with this album, but to be honest I like the experimental, murky nature from the jump. This song is no exception. It's repetitive and brings you into Sly's nihilistic, drug-fueled world. And it's fitting with this song, as a drugged-out, despondent Sly is lying in his bed repeatedly going "Feel so good, don't wanna move". So begins his complete disenchantment from the 60's hippie optimism. And the backing vocals help anchor the song, a recurring theme throughout this album.

**flavasavavandal** (9): The opener to There’s a Riot Goin’ On is about the death of idealism, both in America and in Sly. The end of the 60s saw an increase of police brutality and anti-war riots being cracked down upon with force. The Civil Rights Movement's power in changing systems and the Countercultural movements seems to have gone as far as it could have. Republicans who were in power were coming up with ways to push back against these movements. Musically Sly separates the band from these old movements that feel inert at the time by drugging out the mix, murking his vocals while recording them in bed.The result is an end to the optimism that coloured the band’s earlier music and the beginning of something darker and wild

---

## <3 Luv <3

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Those backing vocals give me another reason to live

**bbfan132** (10): great intro!!! love the sound of the production

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): Almost transcendent. The "I-I-I.."s and "Another Place, Another Time" are borderline divine.

**kappyko** (10): idk how you can listen to this opening track and be like Damn Guess This Is Gonna Be The Worst Album! the whole mantra-esque repetition as it slowly builds towards a more frantic ending MWAH

**MorrisFae** (10): As it goes, we immediately set ourselves apart from the other 3 albums. We descend further into the grime and the muck, but we're rewarded with unparalleled grooves and vocal interplay. We've replaced the aggressively professional smoothness of some of the previous albums with a more carefree and experimental approach, and what an opening statement we have to show it off.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (10): Feel so good inside myself, don't wanna move....

**jman457** (9.2): groovy way to start the album

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.2): me doing this rate in bed:

**austrosinitic** (9): Go off Sly I'm all for roasting white hippies! The 60s was an overrated decade both musically and culturally!! This shit is way better!!

**BeauMeringue212** (9): something about this feels so bleak, really sets the mood for the album

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): Relentlessly funky

**MadJohnBeard** (9): Great opener, the tone is set in stone from this point

**qazz23** (9): Solid opener, like the backing vocals

**runaway3212** (9): The women carrying like always

**waluigiest** (9): just the bay area way of life if im being honest

**welcome2thejam** (9): This is big time "I just want to lie in bed forever" goals like... the dude made this. God I wish that were me

**fadedblue09** (8.5): This definitely doesn't sound like it was made in 1971

**TiltControls** (8.5): There's a great funk to the song that elevates it to being a great listen and a great start to the album

**bo_g_o** (8): this isn't yo la tengo

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the opposite of depression

**frogaranaman** (8): popheads in the 70s would have been like "can't artists spell PROPERLY these days?? 🙄 these new song titling practices are making my listening notebook tracking impossible!!" on their handwritten mailed-in ballot for the ultimate soul rate

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): women?????

**jsonphile** (8): someone get these people spellcheck

**Smuckles** (8): Mwah, there's that funk! The breakdown in the middle is so good.

**seanderlust** (7.7): the phrase "feels so good" is said 41 times in these lyrics but also i'm a charli xcx fan so I can't really complain about that

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): is this about yanking it

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): this album is more groove-based and instrumental focused than I expected, which I kinda like less than a couple other albums here just because that’s not my usual way of approaching things, but it does still open with one of the stronger grooves

**Blisterman** (7): A nice loose funk jam to open the album.

**freeofblasphemy** (7): Good groove but feels kind of underwhelming as an opener

**Tadevos** (7): This song is one of the points where the weird raw mix really gels with the energy of the performance. It feels rough and vital here, which I welcome.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): The production is actually so good. It sound kinda modern actually.

## Hippie

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): this song is me when i'm cozy in bed in the middle of winter and my alarm goes off

**babadork** (6): This song being almost all build-up does fit with it being about not wanting to go anywhere, but it is not for me.

**musical\_pyn** (6): there's just something…off about this song and I really want to like it more

**vayyiqra** (6): Kind of cringe fact but I didn't know how to pronounce "Haight" for most of my life ! anyway why is this album so quiet does anyone know

**ImADudeDuh** (5): the worst song about getting high in the rate

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.7): A stirring, admonishing of holy roller's hypocrisy. It's bold, as Stevie grew up in the church to criticize it. Admonishing junkies for their drug addiction is a bit of-its-time, but with the issues gripping America at the time, I think Stevie's intentions were coming for a good place; wanting religiosity to leave places of faith. I love how Stevie sings in a lower register. It's all very low and rumbling, a different vibe from the rest of the album.

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): : Am I surprised this is the first Stevie song going out. Absolutely not. I’m just shocked it made it to day 2 of the reveal because while Stevie does criticise people who abuse the words of Christianity to promote hate and bigotry, this is still ultimately a religious song. And I thought we all agreed that the Christian songs get kicked asap. I guess y’all were too busy bullying poor Sly and his family to remember that this song exists. Oh the song, it’s fine enough, a little formless, lyrics and content do hit hard though.

---

## SINNER GET READY

**2dina3dworld** (10): organised religion is really a double edged sword. It’s nice to have something to believe in, and a community, but also the abuse and pain inflicted that can happen under the lie of “this is what God wants”.

**bo_g_o** (10): I'm not religious but this song definitely makes me feel something

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh this is excellent

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I feel bad that I keep criticizing Marvin for being a little to preachy but this album makes it obvious i wouldn’t care of it was more upbeat and faster lol

**TiltControls** (10): As someone who is not American, a child or Jesus I just can't relate to this /s

**bbfan132** (9.5): after the last 4 songs, it’s not a standout but it’s still great!!

**kappyko** (9.5): The song I have the least to say about but like most Stevie songs it has this badass part at the end that makes you think it's the best thing ever when ur actually listening to it

**jman457** (9.2): A great way to look at the state of spirituality in america, both now and then

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Atheists listening to this bop like 👁👄👁

**akanewasright** (9): This is less of a showstopper than the last few songs for me, but like… it’s still really, really good?

**fadedblue09** (9): Love the themes addressed here, and the production sounds way ahead of the curve

**qazz23** (9): nice comedown after the peak of the album, still has solid melodies and vocals

**Roxieloxie** (9): I feel weird saying a song fucks that mentions like jesus and children but god

**Tadevos** (8.5): Groovy, moody, propulsive, a modulation that makes a heck of a lot of sense…there’s a lot to love here.

**babadork** (8): A song calling out how some Christians are living their lives is very fitting for the album, but I would not mind if he left “junkies” out of it.

**Blisterman** (8): Enjoy the moody atmosphere of this one.

**frogaranaman** (8): that's just Catholic middle school

**ignitethephoenix** (8): he snapped here

**MorrisFae** (8): first thing I can think when this song opens is the vocals are almost reminiscent of Alan Vega/Suicide, the power and emotion constrained to just barely above a whisper. I love listening to the right speaker in this one and just hearing that one key part basically solo for half the song.

**vayyiqra** (8): That title makes me think Sufjan Stevens needs to cover this

**welcome2thejam** (8): The backup singers elevate this song to great

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Not my favorite but still pretty good

## Jimmy Swaggart

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I love the vocals in this one. There's just something that isn't clicking with me.

**seanderlust** (6.7): when he said "tell em jesus" I was really hoping jesus would hop in with a sick guitar solo or something

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): this album starts to drag around here unfortunately

**ImADudeDuh** (6): girl, i don’t know what the fuck he’s saying but, I am re-living my religious trauma

**musical\_pyn** (6): groove on this is pretty good, but the lyrics don't do enough for me to raise it up too much

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): no but I love his work

## Don’t threaten me with a good time

**runaway3212** (8.5): Childeren of america are not childeren of jesus sorry you heard it here but y'all are going straight to hell

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): While cobbling together the bonus rate, I missed a few women I wanted to add. My last minute add was Patrice Rushen; I'm very interested in her virtuosic piano upbringing, jazz acclaim, and then switching to soul then disco. And now she's the first woman Music Director of the Grammy's! What a life. A regret I have is not picking her song "The Hump" (the memes write themselves) plus it's an amazing song. But people seemed to like this deep cut. It's one of the few more sociopolitical tracks on the bonus rate. Patrice can really do anything.

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): Wait people find this boring, with that bass, y’all crazy

---

## Rushen to give this a high score

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The attitude being sold through the vocals is why the 70s were iconic.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): we love life changing as we go! Actually no we don’t!

**kappyko** (10): i only know her for the album with Forget Me Nots but this rips

**MorrisFae** (10): God nothing makes me fall head over heels for a song better than a rushed and intense vocal delivery like this.

**qazz23** (10): nice upbeat disco funk

**ReallyCreative** (10): don't sleep on Haven't You Heard and Forget Me Nots

**babadork** (9.5): This is amazing, and I need to explore her music more beyond her bigger hits.

**TiltControls** (9): it's fun and sometimes that's all you need in a song

**bbfan132** (8): this was nice!! admittedly prefer a few of her other songs to this but it’s still nice

**Smuckles** (8): Wouldn't be out of place on Innervisions!

## Rushen to hate on this song

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Nice

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): if stan twitter existed in the 70s, people would go “this sounds like it belongs in an Old Navy commercial” (but back then it was just called Navy)

**MadJohnBeard** (7): some great synths

---

## Handles rejection like a boss!

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): When I was younger, I used to watch a show called Soccer A.M and every week they'd bring out one female soccer fan who they'd call the "Soccerette." Typically the Soccerette was attractive. They'd then interview the Soccerette and the general vibe of the thing was "So how did a pretty girl like you end up liking soccer love?" After the interview, the host and the Soccerette would do a short catwalk thing together and this song would play while they were doing it. I thought it was funny at the time (I think I was 8) but it's pretty weird looking back on it. Anyway the song is great

**kappyko** (10): i never actually knew this before the rate so thank you!!!! this one's great

**RandomHypnotica** (10): omfg I remember this song from DJ Hero 💀

**Roxieloxie** (10): WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!!!

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.5): The backing vocals!!

**bo_g_o** (9): what's this "big stuff" you're referring to now

**CrimsonROSET** (9): love wins maybe

**MorrisFae** (9): I wish I could hear this without immediately getting Everclear stuck in my head :( It's such a good track but my dumb lizard brain just immediately starts autoplaying Art Alexakis' dumbshit song over that beautiful riff.

**qazz23** (9): good hook and backing vocals

**babadork** (8.5): When I was a kid, I thought this was a Queen Latifah song. My parents had a copy of the soundtrack to The Associate.

**bbfan132** (8.5): short but enjoyed it quite a bit!!

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): This is a lot of fun

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Now I wanna know about Mr. Little Stuff

## Is a Mr. Big Stuff and feels insulted

**jsonphile** (7.5): Mr. Big Stuff and Misstra Know-It-All sound like they’d be good friends

**Smuckles** (7): Fine song, I've heard it in far too may adverts though.

**jman457** (6.7): its less than 3 minutes but feels longer than Living in the city

**seanderlust** (5.3): ....i mean....does this Mr. Big Stuff have a snapchat?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): When Eddie said he didn't like his Teddy/you knew who was a no-good kid/But when he threatened your life with a switch blade knife/What a guy!/Makes you cry!/Und I did! (this is proof theater kids should be silenced, sorry)

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): Eddie did not know better which is why he betrayed his best friend and partner to keep up his lifestyle of being “owned” by a corrupt white police officer. One of the things this song implies that the film doesn’t is that Eddie’s time on this Earth is running short.

---

## Knew Better

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “Think of the tears and fears” my mind instantly went towards Tears For Fears

**bbfan132** (10): yes.

**bo_g_o** (10): come on Eddie do better

**MorrisFae** (10): Lyrically, kind of the antithesis to Freddie's Dead. Here this isn't a "we all saw this coming, he failed and was failed". This is, "we did our best but there's a doom that's marked us from the start".

**runaway3212** (9): let's all laugh at eddie for being a dum dum

**Stryxen** (8.5): see: my pusherman comment. with: less emphasis on the massive bop part

**austrosinitic** (8): Unfortunately this has one of the weakest melodies on the entire album, but its production is just as amazing as the rest of it is. Also, this is the only time I’m going to mention a white musician in this rate but has anybody else noticed that the sound at the beginning that recurs all throughout this sounds weirdly (but not exactly) like One Day by Bjork? Like, maybe I’m just imagining the similarities here, but why?

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): I love this instrumental so much? I like the lyrics a lot.

**jsonphile** (8): me when I see Eddie Redmayne take on a role in Jupiter Ascending

**kappyko** (8): Idk how this isn't as good as the other songs but it's still good

**qazz23** (8): nice buildup to the next song

**TiltControls** (8): I think this of any of the vocal tracks would help knowing the accompanying film. Without it it's a great track, but I feel like the extra context might elevate it that little bit higher

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Ugh, this one hit close to home...

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Pretty good not much else to say

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this ends so abruptly? Idk I was wanting more

**Tadevos** (7.5): Heartbreaking, and that guitar solo…!

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): i wanted to put an Ed Edd & Eddy joke here but i don’t watch that show so oh well

**jman457** (7.2): C’mon eddie

## Eddie’s Dead, That’s What I Said

**babadork** (7): The first lines and the last ones are very good, but there’s some awkward rhymes and phrasing in between.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): is this song about the landlord in rent

**fadedblue09** (7): Love the lyrics but the I find the instrumental meandering

**seanderlust** (7): the reviews of the 2002 film "the adventures of pluto nash" be like

**Blisterman** (6): There’s a weird tone to this you'd never see in a modern song. Feels like a mother scolding her son

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Timberrrr! I love Sly's meandering, funky jam opuses on this album. Granted, my brother is a bassist, so maybe I'm just used to jams that should have ended minutes ago. Here is where Sly's warped sense of humor comes in throughout the despair. Who knows why this man is yelling TIMBERRR rn.

**flavasavavandal** (9): Fun fact this is the longest song in the rate with the word Africa in the title

---

## Nothing funny, just nice to see people appreciating TARGO because a lot of people didn’t 

**2dina3dworld** (10): and you may think “How did we get here?”

**AHSWeeknd** (10): They gotta make more eight minute songs, and not the Justin Timberlake type that changes beat near the end.

**akanewasright** (10): A number of songs I didn’t immediately fall for on this album are this kind of loose, improvisational, and funky, and yet this track captured my attention more than the shorter songs did. I think because it went all out with the funk and length and improvised sound, and because it has the giant “TIMBER” holding it together, it works for me a bit more

**CrimsonROSET** (10): timbuuUUH // this song is great, BOY did it not need 5 minutes of instrumental

**ImADudeDuh** (10): how many people are gonna comment “its going down, im yelling timber”?

**MadJohnBeard** (10): the ultimate jam, there are some noises I hear that my heart tells me I shouldn't

**MorrisFae** (10): The lyrics in this album are so original. They're definitely quite a bit more abstract than the other albums, but the surrealistic way they paint a picture and flavor the grooves is impeccable. "If you are doin' right, why are you cryin'?" In-fucking-deed. Also this bassline deserves a nobel peace prize.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (10): TIMBERRRRRRR!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): it’s going down, I’m yelling timber

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.1): The type of groove you just don't want to stop

**babadork** (9): This song is upsetting, but I still danced every time I relistened to it while doing this rating.

**bbfan132** (9): this could’ve went on for an hour and i’d be ok with that

**kappyko** (9): the outro groove is too good.

**vayyiqra** (9): I would say this song has kind of baffling lyrics but then remembered I was just stanning The Age of Adz in the last rate so I can't complain. Anyway this song is good!

**welcome2thejam** (9): Favorite track on the album; no surprise as the grooves just leap off. Really happy I got a decent pair of headphones for Christmas, it's paying dividends for this one.

**jman457** (8.9): if the grateful dead were good

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): all the long songs in this are some of the best ones

**seanderlust** (8.5): the instrumentals on this album are so interesting

**fadedblue09** (8): The instrumental solos in the end are just heavenly

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I love that the hosts didn’t actually do a writeup for this one because I don’t have anything to say about it either, it’s good though

**ignitethephoenix** (8): glad Kesha and Pitbull were inspired by them

**ReallyCreative** (8): this is a lot louder on Spotify than the rest of the album

**Smuckles** (8): I could really write 11 comments mentioning the bass, couldn't I?

**soggy\_charge9447** (8): gave this song a 5 at first it really grew on me over the month

**TiltControls** (8): I can see PH not being kind to a nearly 9 minute long song that repeats most of the lyrics for the back half. But there's an infectious groove here that if you can get in the right mood for makes it easy to get lost in the music. That being said... maybe could have been cut down a minute or two...

**TragicKingdom1** (8): more like the ass-phalt jungle amirite? i'll be here all week folks

## Yells TIMBERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!

**bo_g_o** (7): decent

**freeofblasphemy** (7): Indulgent but cool sounds

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): That surprisingly didn't feel like 9 minutes... But then again most of it was just them singing the same thing over and over.

**MNREDR** (6): I feel like I should have taken some substance to fully get this song.

**qazz23** (6): a bit long and repetitive

**runaway3212** (6): this is great but a bit too long

**waluigiest** (6): it’s (still) going down, i’m yelling timber

**Blisterman** (4): This one is tedious. Not tight enough to be a jam. Too monotonous to take you on a journey.

**Tadevos** (4): Here’s the thing: a song this long in this style has to either be very lush or very tight or both. This song just. Happens. At considerable length. I can’t dig it.

**flavasavavandal** (10): Think really said “not today” to instrumentalphobia on day 1. Unfortunately that wasn’t enough on day 2 and we are sad to see the *better* instrumental go out but glad to see it last longer than the lesser instrumental that his Junkie Chase.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): This instrumental never did it for me, though I do like it. Maybe it's because I was once overexposed to music that reminds me of; a few years ago I went on a random kick of 60's "easy listening" type of classical such as Paul Mauriat's "Love is Blue". Something about this song also reminds me of that somewhat cheesy easy listening, which clearly I like every now and again but it does stand out in this album. But clearly I'm somewhat alone in this! This beat out the other instrumental, showing that maybe popheads ARE thinking and may have more than one brain cell.

---

## Had thoughts

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I am once again giving a ten to an instrumental track because there’s a possibility it’ll be a day one out.

**celladonn** (10): I've literally had this on repeat, it's so nice. Feels like music that would play in a peaceful town in an rpg

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): real real pretty

**jman457** (10): the better of the two instrumentals, and one of the best songs in this rates. Popheads better not do it dirty!

**runaway3212** (10): okay but why do the instrumentals slay so much

**bbfan132** (9.5): this sax, yum

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.5): Wonderful, whimsical instrumentation - great stuff!

**kappyko** (9): gorgeous!!!

**seanderlust** (8.8): this is honestly lovely. I don't know why it reminds me of a video game instrumental for like a peaceful town (think twilight town in kh) but it does

**akanewasright** (8.5): I’m not crazy for thinking this sounds Beyoncé’s song Resentment right?

**austrosinitic** (8.5): Everybody says this is one of the best instrumentals of all time and it sounds amazing whenever I hear it but I STILL can't remember it sob I hate you ADHD I hate you

**bo_g_o** (8.5): okay this could've been slightly shorter

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): Really nice

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): sometimes songs without words are valid actually

**1998tweety** (8): im surprised i enjoyed the instrumentals/interludes more than most of the album, thats usually not the case

**CrimsonROSET** (8): a lot of my comments in this album have been on the more light-hearted side, so let me put this here: all instrumentals in it are fucking gorgeous, but they don’t ever really go anywhere kinda.

**MadJohnBeard** (8): this is why instrumentals exist

**ReallyCreative** (8): definitely the weaker of the two instrumentals, but still very nice!

**Stryxen** (8): composed so beautifully with so many intricate melodies coming together and actually builds up momentum going into the final track

**Tadevos** (7.5): Yeah, this is just a lovely one.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): this could be a real challenge for some popheads

**frogaranaman** (7): I Think (Instrumental) that this is good

**Smuckles** (7): Do popheads hate instrumentals as much as indieheads do? This is a good one!

**TiltControls** (7): see comment for other instrumental, but like, slightly higher rated

## Don’t Believe In T-H-O-U-G-H-T-S

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): this sounds nice, but it doesn’t really build to enough of a peak without vocals to fully win me over

**babadork** (6): It sounds like a lot of 70s background music. That probably is because of the success of this album, but it ends up sounding a bit generic.

**waluigiest** (6): this will be the first out (but any zeroes received will be undeserved)

**ImADudeDuh** (5): aretha franklin (vocals) outsold

**Blisterman** (4): This one is a bit nothing.

## Look ma, people actually gave an instrumental an 11

**DefaultPophead** (11): Sue me, I love instrumentals.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (11): That was easily the most beautiful instrumental I've ever heard!

## Got told something good

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Chaka Khan’s vocal styling here is perfect.

**babadork** (10): I have a vague memory of Glee doing something horrible with this involving Will Schuester, and I would really like that memory to remain repressed.

**bbfan132** (10): the bass and wah pedal… UGH YES this is perfect

**ImADudeDuh** (10): rufus and chaka khan honestly never go wrong. Stream Rags to Rufus

**seanderlust** (10): the fact that i can't 11 this...pain

**TiltControls** (10): The bonus 11 (if one existed!) also because I need to continue the trend of scarring soul rate hosts with glee comments - one of the first and few episodes i've seen of glee had a cover of this song and I haven't been able to sleep easy knowing it still exists out there in the world

**waluigiest** (10): stone cold classic

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): this bonus rate is too good

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): boom WAH boom WAH boom Wah

**MorrisFae** (9): "I got somethin' that'll sho' 'nuff set your stuff on fire" hell yeah Chaka burn me down.

**qazz23** (9): nice guitar squawks

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): This song is something good

**bo_g_o** (8): you get a good score, that's what's good!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): … … … chaka khan

**jman457** (8): invented techno, sorry Kraftwerk

**kappyko** (8): This song is good hahaa you can tell im on my last limbs with comments

**MadJohnBeard** (8): great jam

**nt96** (8): I cant hear this without thinking of That 70s Show. If you know, you know 😉

**Smuckles** (8): We are firmly on the funk side of this soul rate and I am firmly into it.

**vayyiqra** (8): tru


## Got told something… ugh… not good

**welcome2thejam** (5): One of those unfortunate times I'm more familiar with a song as a commercial jingle than anything else, and that kinda ruins it. And I can't even recall who used it or how many times it's been used, didn't Applebees sell me a slab of ribs to this? Who knows anymore?

---

## Grace Jones Rate 2022 when?

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Grace Jones’ original work was better but she killed it with this album.

**MorrisFae** (10): I refuse to ever give Ms. Jones anything less than a 10 and I'm not about to start now. I love the audacity of "perhaps a man like you" it's like, "yeah I know you want me, I know this is all my choice, I just need to decide if your worth my time"

**nt96** (10): Grace Jones is an often overlooked icon in this generation. Shame on all of you.

**plastichaxan** (10): me too girl

**qazz23** (10): nice disco sound with strings

**radioactive-isotopes** (10): Poppy asked me to do this

**Roxieloxie** (10): little mix in you gotta not:

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Nightclubbing rate when???

**skargardin** (10): The fact that we have never rated a Grace Jones project doesn't sit right with me

**waluigiest** (10): I am obsessed with Grace Jones. Truly exceptional.

**jsonphile** (9.5): if Holding Out For a Hero didn’t exist, then the Fairy Godmother would’ve sung this in Shrek 2 I will not elaborate further

**CrimsonROSET** (9): you don’t need no man

**FightYaAtThePrody** (9): Abba must've been by inspired by this for Voulez Vous

**seanderlust** (8.6): so false alexa play we don't need a man by rachel bloom

**bbfan132** (8.5): this title is a mood

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): Different Grace album but I recently heard “Living My Life” for the first time recently and it’s so so good

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): so true

**BeauMeringue212** (8): Don't we all hun

**kappyko** (8): i personally dont idk abt everyone else

**TiltControls** (7.5): me

## The snobby indieheads

**Smuckles** (6): This is, err, not the Grace Jones I'm used to but it's uptempo enough. Would slay at the discotheque!

**vayyiqra** (6): I wish you luck with that bestie

**babadork** (5): I think Grace Jones was being subversive by picking standards and mostly normal songs for her debut album, but I also don’t really get it.

**MadJohnBeard** (5): I like other stuff by her better

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): It makes sense I would like this song. Of course I like a song covered by Barbra Streisand. What can I say, I'm a former theater kid raised on the yearning and maudlin. I think the way Stevie sings this breakup ballad is impassioned. The one long belt at the end? Ugh, too good. Sadly, it was a bit too saccharine for many raters.

**flavasavavandal** (10): back to ballad territory with this one on a song that is probably about Stevie’s divorce from his wife at the time Syreeta Wright (you may remember her from the bonus rate) for a song that was released as a Brazil only single. A beautifully arrangement that tells the mourning of a relationship as things have fallen apart and no one party is really at fault. It leads Stevie to question the absurdity of a life-long love but still even after a divorce, still comes to the conclusion that it was probably worth it.

---

## Fair to ballads

**nootnoot781** (11): if this gets subject to balladphobia... this is just excellent. this might have the best male vocals i have ever heard, it's gorgeous.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THE VOCALS, please, I’m so floored by this.

**akanewasright** (10): GOD this is stunning

**bbfan132** (10): underrated in some places apparently…. i’ve loved this for years and i hope it does well here!!

**BeauMeringue212** (10): This made me Ajay cry ngl lol

**bo_g_o** (10): balladphobia can fuck off

**ImADudeDuh** (10): omg so true, I am someone who has been many a relationships and he totally spilled yup

**kappyko** (10): My dad likes this song!

**musical\_pyn** (10): the adeleification of stevie wonder

**seanderlust** (10): WHAT a ballot. when he hits those high notes towards the end...transcend

**waluigiest** (10): literal chills. start to finish.

**freeofblasphemy** (9.5): Just devastating

**jsonphile** (9.5): I want to play this on piano on a dark rainy day

**austrosinitic** (9): The only remotely bad thing about Stevie's ballads is that he tricked everybody into thinking they were good at writing them too. That shit clogged up the radio in the 90s but it all pales in comparison to how our king does it

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): oh you and me both Stevie

**skargardin** (9): VOCALS

**welcome2thejam** (9): Able to resist the traditional balladphobia thanks to Stevie's voice killing it on the choruses. Seeing how it connects to his real-life divorce adds an extra layer of heartbreaking to the mix

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): his vocals are so good here

**2dina3dworld** (8): too bad love isn’t fair.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): love (derogatory)

**Roxieloxie** (8): LIsten im trying to think of comments for this but darj is currently explaining the most cursed lore in the rates channel i cant think

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): what about war? let's get George Bush on the phone

**TiltControls** (7.5): I know these are all classics that have stood the test of time on their own, but I 100% blame my lack of love for this classic on hearing it what feels like millions of times on reality singing competitions sung in the most forgettable way possible.

**babadork** (7.4): Even though it is intentionally corny, it is maybe still a bit too corny for me most of the time.

**cremeebrulee** (7.4): stevie said you can have one (1) sad love song as a treat

**MadJohnBeard** (7): stevie's sayin the rules are out the window when it comes to love cause people will do anything for it

**MorrisFae** (7): There's so much that I love about this song, I wish I enjoyed it more. Does that make sense? I can pinpoint individual things about this song that blow me away, the drums are perfect, the crescendo is executed beautifully, and the vocals have such an intense tenderness. It doesn't quite gel as the others do for me, but that's probably a personal problem. I do appreciate how this almost sounds like a showtune at times, especially the repeated hook at the end.

**Smuckles** (7): Probably the weakest song on the album if I had to choose one, it's a standard Stevie ballad, but a standard Stevie ballad is still pretty good.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Beautiful. Such a gorgeous piano.

**vayyiqra** (7): I never got the phrase this song is titled after - huh? Unfair stuff happens in love all the damn time. But if he's talking about his own first marriage and saying it wasn't anyone's fault it didn't work, then yeah sure.

## All in scores are fair to ballads

**jman457** (6.2): a cute little love song but sounds weak on this album

**Blisterman** (6): This is my least favourite type of Stevie. It’s unfair to blame him for the singers who came years later, but it just reminds me of TV talent show singing.

**qazz23** (6): like the soaring vocals, but it's a bit too ballad-y

**fadedblue09** (5): Solid vocals but it sounds like a dreary soap opera theme.

**runaway3212** (4): all in love is boring

**Tadevos** (2): Stevland is very, very good at writing ballads that are absolutely goddamn exhausting.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): It's a great, jaunty start to the album, though I do prefer other tracks. I figured this would be a big favorite, as it got a lot of good scores, but it only fared just under 20. Yet another cautionary tale against drugs not making the Top 10!

**flavasavavandal** (7): If you read my thoughts on Too High in the university syllabus, it won’t be surprising that this is getting a 7. The warm empathy that the rest of the album has isn’t found on Too High and while I did find some new appreciation while writing about it. I just can’t help but feel that Too High could use more heart, more kindness, because the woman in the song is still a victim. But aside from that, colourful instrumentation really prevents me from tanking Too High Too Hard. ~~Even if I can’t ever get over how those doo-doo-doo-do’s remind me of Mario.~~ And yes I think this placement is Too High

---



## Their scores are too high too high 

**Smuckles** (11): Cooler than a polar bear's toenails. This is the song i come back to the most in the rate, I think he zoned into a mood that even he never really managed to replicate again. This, as the kids are fond of saying, is a vibe.

**Blisterman** (10): I love the jazz funk sound of this song. You can hear its DNA it in so much music in the decades to come.

**bo_g_o** (10): can we get much higher

**fadedblue09** (10): Very colorful, textured instrumentals. A solid opening track that sets up the album's worldbuilding very well

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): I'm a sucker for some "doo-doo-doo-da-doo-da-doos"

**jackisboredtoday** (10): I feel like there isn’t a placement this could get in the rate that would be Too High, ha ha ha

**MorrisFae** (10): if you're not a Stevie fan by the time the "doo doo"s hit then we can't be friends. If you're not a Stevie fan by the time you hear that bass and that smoooooooth hook? I'll pray for you. Also my hobby? Just focusing on the cymbal hits throughout the song, when it's just in the right speaker for a bit around 1:30 or so? Yes plz.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): An opener!

**austrosinitic** (9): Even if Stevie's music was getting better and better before Innversions came out this definitely took his songwriting skills to new heights by introducing the audience to a gritty urban reality full of social turmoil that's painted in more depth as the album progresses. Very well done — shows you he's really going for somehow special

**babadork** (9): I hadn’t considered this before listening to this album and Sly Stone’s in the same day, but I wonder now if there isn’t some mocking of psychedelic music that promotes drug use in the second verse.

**bbfan132** (9): the do-do-do parts kind of sound like a commercial jingle in a fun way

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this song really goes “this girl had a life ahead of her but she got caught up in drugs and it eventually cost her her life (doo-doo-doo doo doo-doo, doo-doo doo)”

**jsonphile** (9): me when I go back home to southern California for the holidays and I see the gas prices there

**kappyko** (9): sets an unsettling tone for the album. It is like 50/50 on whether this song is the best song ever or merely alright

**MadJohnBeard** (9): funkiest groove, this song should be used to introduce funk music to aliens when they eventually ask

**qazz23** (9): love the harmonica solo

**TiltControls** (9): Great way to open the album! Suuuper dark lyrically despite the more upbeat sections, but Stevie pulls off the presentation amazingly

**waluigiest** (9): from the very beginning it’s clear a lot of this rate will be a really harrowing look at Black America under Nixon and the war on drugs

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): wait this song is anti-drugs? could have fooled me

**2dina3dworld** (8): Well he’s clearly not high on life

**freeofblasphemy** (8): I like how this suddenly becomes a song about a woman

**frogaranaman** (8): me about every other weekend after drinking too much beforehand

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Don’t do drugs kids

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Intoxicating groove

**musical\_pyn** (8): I LOVE the prechorus/chorus but that part in the middle is a little annoying

**plastichaxan** (8): me too Stevie

**soggy\_charge9447** (8): for years now I hear Stevie say “I’m too high..” when I’m uncomfortably faded and I mildly resent this song for that

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I just know this rate has a lot of drug references and of course they are starting at the first song

**runaway3212** (7.5): Sadly i am not high enough

**jman457** (7.3): A groovy little intro but also feels like elevator music a bit

## stans Lil Dicky’s Too High

**MC\_Fuzzy** (7): I really like Stevie, I’m not big on harmonicas (perhaps it’s because I have no experience being in a band with one)

**seanderlust** (7): This is a song about my friend Becky. She used to be a happy, popular girl until one night she snorted marijuana at a party. She died instantly. Please, don't do marijuana. It's the most dangerous drug out there. Please don't wind up like Becky.

**vayyiqra** (7): Starting this album with this song seemed like kind of a weird move until I thought about the context of this era having rampant drug use. I have to agree with the hosts that this treatment of drug addiction could've been a bit more empathetic, but then maybe the point is that he's singing about it in such a blasé way to show how uncaring we are about addicts. And little has changed 50 years later, sadly.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6.5): This sounds like something that would be in a 70's musical.

**BeauMeringue212** (6): I like the funky instrumentals but the song just doesn't fully connect for some reason

**Tadevos** (6): It feels, weirdly enough, like this song doesn’t quite go anywhere, which is frustrating.

**welcome2thejam** (6): This is D.A.R.E.'s funkiest propaganda yet

**letsallpoo** (5): so this is who's responsible for bill wurtz

**Stryxen** (5): i really don’t enjoy the instrumental it feels too empty to connect with but the lyrics are really high quality

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): If you've seen any of my promo on discord or the daily discussion, you'll know I'm not too keen on this song. When indieheads were doing their 60s classics rate including Pet Sounds and Revolver, there was a lot of discussion about stereo vs mono and hard panning sound production practices of the 60s. I was never too bothered by what I heard from those albums, but MAN the hard panning of the güiro is very distracting for me. The rest of the song is a lovely 10, but I have to subtract how it genuinely bothers me, especially for 7 minutes. Sad!

**flavasavavandal** (6.5): I blame darjeeling for my score being this low, she made me very aware of the guiro being just slightly too loud and now I can’t unhear it. Even when I take off my headphones I still hear, I go to sleep and I can still hear it, that guiro scratch is what Michael and co will use to torture me in the bad place with. Everything else about the song is good though

---

## Listened with the right headphone out

**2dina3dworld** (10): the little drum really scratches an itch

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Beyond the lyrics, this track is the perfect representation for the absolute mastery of instrumental arrangements done for this album.

**bbfan132** (10): sonically, this is beyond relaxing. give me 2 hours of this

**bo_g_o** (10): indeed, right on

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): The flute is soo good

**jman457** (10): If Marvin Gaye were to pull off a second win in 3 months it better be with this song (he unfairly won the first time imo)

**Roxieloxie** (10): I love this song!!!

**Stryxen** (10): this song makes me wag my finger and even tap my foot slightly

**seanderlust** (9.7): these lyrics are great, but get even better when you picture marvin passive aggressively talking about someone specific. "some of us are aware that it's good to care, DEBBIE."

**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): 2nd 7 and a half minute song in the rate, and another banger

**akanewasright** (9): fuck you all, I love a good guiro

**austrosinitic** (9): I just learned what ‘progressive’ means as a genre tag the other day and my reaction was ‘well, that makes no goddamn sense, what the fuck is the difference between progressive rock and pop and art rock and pop then?!’ but if the music critics (™) are going to insist on using it than I guess this deserves to be called progressive soul. And not to say progressive = good and simplistic = bad, because we are on popheads and because this album’s singles are amazing, but it’s a damn good artistic achievement; closer to funk than anything else on the album, this epic cut one of the two tracks’ production that I really love along with Inner City Blues. Fantastic.

**freeofblasphemy** (9): Beautiful

**kappyko** (9): güiro güiro güiro güiro güiro güiro güiro güiro güiro okay i have the instrument name in my head now

**TiltControls** (9): Another 'people better not sleep on this just cause it's longer than 5 minutes and has a man'

**vayyiqra** (9): Listening to Marvin Gaye "Right On", for the first time, it sounds eerily similar to parts of Impossible Soul... :mischief: No but really, this song feels like a great summary of everything this album is about. Also, güiro.

**waluigiest** (9): effortlessly cool and distinct from the rest of the album

**Tadevos** (8.5): Yeah, sing it, Marvin. Lay into that groove. Mmm. Y’know, the guiro ties the room together. The flute? C’mon, Marvin, leave a little for the rest of us

**BeauMeringue212** (8): 5 I'd rate it even higher but for that weird buzzing kazoo sound?

**frogaranaman** (8): the vibraphone in the background can get grating at times but here's the thing, I was in band I fucking KNOW how much fun that dude was having during the recording session I'd be him I can't be mad

**MC\_Fuzzy** (8): A nice step from the initial run of this album. A lot of the first 6 songs here sound similar, but Right On got its own strong identity

**MorrisFae** (8): The guiro is not for the faint of heart. The jazz flute though? That'll save your soul.

**qazz23** (8): it's a little long, but the flutes are nice

**welcome2thejam** (8): Minute one: Oh shit, it's this instrument! Hell yeah, I love this! Minute four: Hell yeah, still fucking with this instrument! Minute six: Switching my sound to mono so I get it on both ears!

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Probably the most instrumentally intriguing track here, but meanders a bit. And I wish the message was more than just "love is all we need"

**rickikardashian** (7.5): who was in the studio with a disposable camera

**Blisterman** (7): The blaxploitation vibes in this one got me excited for Superfly.

**celladonn** (7): That güiro going crazy

**CrimsonROSET** (7): it sounds like he’s reeling in a fishing rod

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): love that this track is randomly the same length as three other tracks on the album combined… the lyrics are good and once again I appreciate the ambition but I think some of the sonic choices could have been better. Specifically that one sound that repeats throughout the entire song, you know the one. That didn’t need to be there.

**MadJohnBeard** (7): A bit long, but a great jam - hypnotic bass lines

**runaway3212** (7): way too long but a slay anyway

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): That surprisingly didn't feel like 7 minutes…

## Listened with the right headphone in

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): I cannot unhear the Guiro in the background on this , it’s too distracting

**babadork** (5): Instead of listening to rain or whale sounds, I occasionally listen to Motown to fall asleep. Rating this album took ages because I could not stay awake. I would have thought that the guiro would have been annoying enough to keep me awake, but this is the point in the album that I would always fall asleep.

**musical\_pyn** (4): ugh I really REALLY want to like this song but the constant guiro is…incredibly annoying and makes me actively not want to listen to the song. The parts that don't have it sound really great though, and I'm sure this would be incredible live, but I just don't see myself ever listening to this song again

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Ahhh the closer to this epic album! Sly wanted to destroy his past, sunnier self into this meandering, stretched out version of his 60s hit single. This is a brilliant artists' middle finger to his own art, the music industry, social issues, so very much. Again I love the rhythmic chanting of it. Sly still sings his heart out with passion and skill, sounding completely free. And the bass is another highlight for me, Larry Graham's killing it, what a surprise. What a time it's been listening to this peculiar and engaging album.

**flavasavavandal** (10): So this is a reworking of the 1969 (nice) single from called Thank You (Falletinme Be Miceelf Agin), and I absolutely adore that song. It hit number 1 in 1970, and this slowed down drugged out version is a huge middle finger to the mainstream music industry, record labels and white audience who never attempted to grasp the bands’ songs. Making what was one of their biggest hits into something that could never have been a hit takes some serious courage on the part of Sly. The celebratory funk got traded out for something darker, and the vocals picked up more weight, giving them a haunting feeling. Even just as a statement I might have to give it a 10, but it’s my favourite song on the album and an 11 contender.

---


## Thank You (For Giving This Song a Good Score)

**2dina3dworld** (10): the sheer suicidalness of this track resonates, it’s very much a stand against the self versus any real tangible enemy. Of course, that’s my own interpretation, but it really does read as a battle between giving up and going on.

**akanewasright** (10): now, I definitely prefer the original single release of this song, but this is a fascinating experiment, trying to make one of your biggest hits into something that would never get big. This is a lot more slow paced and challenging than the single, but it’s still an excellent record that’s well about as executed as it could be.

**FightYaAtThePrody** (10): All I ever wanted to be was mice elf. Irresistible groove.

**kappyko** (10): i didnt realize some songs on this album were genuinely just reworkings of older songs

**MorrisFae** (10): Seriously this album should be given an EGOT alone for its basslines. Holy SHIT dude.

**runaway3212** (10): yasspa

**TiltControls** (10): Takes a bit to build up, which may be offputting to some - but it makes the payoff so, so great.

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): oh the bass is so good here, honestly this kind of outsells the original

**seanderlust** (9.6): the idea of redoing an old hit in this style is such a cool moment

**jsonphile** (9.5): this sounds like a really fun upbeat funky song is trying to get out. Which is exactly what this is, a slowed down, almost depressing version of their big hit song. It’s a really brilliant concept that more artists should steal from

**bbfan132** (9): very good outro, enjoyed the way it closed out

**CrimsonROSET** (9): willam awww you’re welcome dot gif

**ImADudeDuh** (9): damn they made a slowed+reverb version of their own song in 1971??? Ahead of their time legends

**waluigiest** (9): such a cool rework!!!

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): and I thought I was a screamer

**AHSWeeknd** (8): mixing 🥴

**austrosinitic** (8): Shame the 'timber, all falls down!' parts aren't repeated here bc they were the best part of the original but the music is still great so I'm not gonna complain

**fadedblue09** (8): A very cinematic closer

**Smuckles** (8): Thank you for referencing one of your best songs again!

**Stryxen** (8): this is probably one of the only two songs on this album i really enjoy musically oop. It’s just very funky and its length works in its favour thankfully, but it’s quite an unsatisfying end to the album

**vayyiqra** (8): Yeah this is weird and long and indulgent and I know it will bomb but I like it anyway. Idc !

## Thnku4lettinmebmahself

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): not my favorite intstrumental on the album but this one is one where the lyrics feel like they convey enough to make up for that

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): did they just invent (Slowed + Reverb)???? This confused me when I first heard it because I was like “wait, is this the song from *Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed*?”

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): see the other africa song comment.

**qazz23** (7): good bassline and backing vocals

**welcome2thejam** (7): Evil Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) be like:

**babadork** (6.8): I like this song more than the rating would suggest, but I think it is very reliant on the listener at least being familiar with “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),” which is better when you’ve heard all their most popular songs from the 60s.

**celladonn** (6): I kind of admire them for doing this to one of their biggest hits but that doesn't mean I love listening to it

**MadJohnBeard** (6): I will say a slightly underwhelming closer, but it encapsulates the optimistic 60s turning into the narcissistic attitudes of the 70s

**jman457** (5.8): I mean the original was better but this was intresting

**Blisterman** (5): No thanks (Falletinme Be Mice Elf Agin)

**Tadevos** (5): I’m so used to the single mix that this sludgy album version just feels…off. Half this record sounds like an exceptionally funky paranoid breakdown and this is no exception.


## Longsongphobia pls bully them

**freeofblasphemy** (6): Wow it’s…still going…

**flavasavavandal** (10): : A beautiful ballad that is one of two tracks that are key to examining Innervisions. A dreamlike atmosphere encapsulates the song and the listener with Stevie’s lower register accentuating the arrangement. Understating the majority of lyrics. Combined with some terrific guitar playing it makes for one of the more stunning moments on Innervisions and one I’m sad to see won’t make day 3.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.7): This song is so beautiful to me, very peaceful and soothing. I love Stevie's wishing for a better world without systemic oppression. It's sweeping and you can hear Stevie leaning into more political topics than his prior work, but this time discussing a positive world. Yet there's still a melancholy undercurrent to the song.

---

## Knows Stevie is blind because he is

**AHSWeeknd** (10): They just don’t make songs as great as this anymore (mainly because attention spans have gotten worse and can’t sit through a five minute ballad)

**akanewasright** (10): ENDED Charli XCX

**austrosinitic** (10): This is really just one of those songs that gives you chills because of how beautiful it is. The melancholy of it all just sinks more and more into you as it goes on and it's gorgeous

**bbfan132** (10): love how mellow this song is, the guitars make me tingle

**BeauMeringue212** (10): I love this, the lyrics are like poetry

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): Stevie Wonder has a beautiful voice.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I feel like this is the “representative” track for this album, I mean obviously because it’s the title track, but I feel like when people think about *Innervisions* and Stevie in general this is the kind of song that their mind immediately jumps to. The poetic lyrics are delivered so beautifully

**kappyko** (10): Provides a great argument that, if he wanted to, Stevie Wonder could easily just have been a neat folk singer/songwriter type. for a similar sort of syncretism i really like Terry Callier's work

**seanderlust** (10): okay my first draft comment on this was a snarky joke about "today's not yesterday" but looking at the lyrical content this is actually a very pretty and thoughtful song

**vayyiqra** (10): For this song I followed the advice of the hosts and listened to this in pitch darkness and tried to think about the imagery that Stevie is describing, writing so vividly about a world he doesn't see but that doesn't matter here - what matters is he knows it can be better, and that's his vision. Honestly this was a great experience and a beautiful song.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Loving the guitar. Definitely can feel the tension in this one. Hopeful dreams and visions of the future, but darkness and knowing the difficulty of getting anywhere close to those dreams always lurks there in plain view.

**babadork** (9.7): Amazing vocal melodies and fantastic lyrics

**freeofblasphemy** (9): Beautiful

**MorrisFae** (9): I love a good delicate vocal from Stevie, and these are some of the strongest lyrics he ever wrote. It's an uncharacteristic song for him, but I can almost hear a lot of what Terence Trent D'Arby would do in this melody.

**musical\_pyn** (9): when the vocals come back in after the instrumental break…immaculate

**runaway3212** (9): the outro I ascend

**TiltControls** (9): 'Imagine' but without the pretentiousness

**waluigiest** (9): I am going to arrest Charli XCX for plagiarism

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): From a kiwi’s perspective, this makes me think of the struggle for a bicultural New Zealand. Sure, it’s technically codified in law that we are a bicultural nation, but that was built on a lie by the Europeans, who presented our tipuna with the Treaty of Waitangi in their language, and promised them partnership, but turned around and continued to insist that the English version of the treaty they wrote, one with less signatures and therefore less signatories and consenting parties, is the one that is valid. The one that gave our lands to the Queen, gave the English legal rights to strip us of our culture, and our language, and to steal and trap our people in a cycle of poverty. TL;DR: Fuck colonialism.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): idk how to describe it i just love when guitars do that

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Wow! Absolutely beautiful! That was amazing. I felt like I was in a trance.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): frick off, balladphobia

**Blisterman** (8): Get whiplash going into this spare heartfelt ballad right after Too High, but it’s a great song.

**jman457** (8): a cute little tune with good vocals

**Smuckles** (8): Psychedelic guitar? In my 70's soul music?

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.8): Love the soulful, semi-psych-folk stylings

## Stevie can see truthers

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): this song is just vibes

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): it’s vibey

**celladonn** (7): Very pretty imagery, though musically it doesn't hook me that much

**fadedblue09** (6): I want to like the message but it sounds really cheesy

**FightYaAtThePrody** (4): Slow Stevie doesn't really do much for me

**Tadevos** (3): Love that Mr. Wonder throws in a line about how “all things have an ending” before a *very*\ long caesura—long enough to fool me—and then this boring-ass, offensively pretty song continues for another whole minute. This song sounds like it was written explicitly to get sampled in a nineties rap song and I mean that in like the worst possible way.

**flavasavavandal** (10): This is basically the second part to What’s Going On, or at least that’s how I see it in the context of the album. Inspired by conversations between Marvin and his brother about the treatment of soldiers returning home to a country that seems to be in a more broken state than when they left it. Marvin gave a voice to those predominantly black soldiers returning in a sincere way that still resonates to this day. Good shit!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.6): I overall like how this album has an intentionally "one long song" kind of vibe, so I like how the melody and lyrics carry over from the title track. War *is* hell Marvin, so true.

---

## Like their brother enough to reply

**2dina3dworld** (10): also can’t find work. Sucks to be unemployed.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The delivery of these lyrics. Marvin Gaye was a genius.

**babadork** (10): I seriously considered giving “What’s Going On” a 9.9 to make it clear that I think this song is better before realizing that was a terrible idea.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): as the title suggests, this feels basically like a more conversational part 2 to what’s going on, so it just feels right to give them the same score

**MorrisFae** (10): Much like Stevie's clavinet, Sly's bass, and Curtis' concept, I define this album by the percussion and strings over anything else. It's a layer and an edge that, yeah, means the album isn't quite as "funky" as the rest, it certainly isn't as danceable, it's downright dour, but goddamn is every song powerful. There's a very nebulous unstructured feel that lends the song an extra weight over something with a typical and easy verse-chorus structure

**qazz23** (10): nice thick bassline and sax interludes (11 candidate)

**TiltControls** (10): Maybe it's just the similar sounding names right next to each other, but I always tend to connect this song to What's Going On. Still while I would rank the title track over it, this might be my 2nd or 3rd fave on the album. Another lyrical masterpiece and a great expression on how the government just kind of took (essentially) kids, forcibly sent them to their likely deaths, and leaves them to the wolves on their return

**bbfan132** (9.5): loved this as well!!

**Tadevos** (9.5): It is almost *upsetting* how well Marvin takes the basic elements of “What’s Going On” and recombines them into another absolute stunner. The run of “how in the wooorld” have yooo-oo-ou been” is just otherworldly.

**jman457** (9.3): Song has a really rich story

**austrosinitic** (9): This is more of a continuation to the title and opening track to the point where I almost thought it was just an extended outro but it’s still very, very good.

**Blisterman** (9): Great song. I fail to believe, though, newspapers have ever said that things are getting better.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): not much how about you

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): I love the back vocals

**frogaranaman** (9): I'm currently procrastinating homework and doing an online game where we as a collective assign numbers to songs and get angry when they go out which is something I'm sure none of the artists in this rate would have never even imagined would happen, that's what's happening Marvin

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): I love the way the songs flow on this album, just incredible

**vayyiqra** (9): The Vietnam War was fucked up on many levels but learning how it disproportionately affected the African-American community makes it even worse.

**bo_g_o** (8): isn't this just another way to say what's going on

**kappyko** (8): I'm doing a rate last minute and really wasting darj's good will

**runaway3212** (8): this is just a worse what's going on

## hates their brother

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): This is a tough album

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This song is good but it’s kinda weird because it feels like an alternate universe version of “What’s Going On,” like the sound and lyrics are so similar it feels like it’s going to morph at any second. It also ends kinda abruptly

**ignitethephoenix** (7): when I heard the beginning of this song I thought what’s going on was being played again

**MadJohnBeard** (7): This serves as a great continuation - I wonder if Marvin had to explain "concept albums" to record execs in '71

**Smuckles** (7): Smooth even by Marvin's standards

**Stryxen** (7): not much i’m just doing this rate while my laundry finishes lol

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): This song is such a vibe! I love it.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Love the message but needs a lot more to stand out

**flavasavavandal** (10): I’m giving this a 10 despite the fact that in the narrative of the album the wife backtracks slightly after this song. Millie absolutely drags him

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): This one is from an album I was recommended to check out by rate/sub creator, u/kappyko. It's one of the few 70s soul concept albums from a woman, "Caught Up". The album is a TRIP, and camp. The concept is the second half of the album is from a wife's perspective, and then the other half is from the husband's mistress. Drama! The most famous track off this album is from the mistress' perspective, but when making the bonus rate I wondered if raters would not be keen to hear that smug perspective from the other woman. So, I chose a lesser-known track form the wife. And it paid off for Millie! Many raters were ready to THROW DOWN for Ms. Jackson. For a lesser-known artist to popheads, I'm happy with this placement.

---

## Felt Millie’s power

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THAT is how you deliver. Talk about understanding the assignment

**bo_g_o** (10): yes fuck that man!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): kill him

**kappyko** (10): GET HIS ASS

**MorrisFae** (10): Speaking of the break up song, Millie gets vicious and she's earned the right. This is a "you're going to get dressed down, we're GOING to argue, but this is catharsis". Goddamn what a powerful performance, and what a unique lyrical direction. I love how every instrument in this song sounds accusatory and threatening.

**qazz23** (10): powerful vocals and funky

**seanderlust** (10): "now am i supposed to feel all your fatherly instincts when you've been practicing babymaking all the while?" GET HIS ASS MILLIE

**TiltControls** (10): a verbal beatdown in song form and I love it

**bbfan132** (9.5): i remember seeing this album cover once, maybe i should check it out!!!

**babadork** (9): I have been underrating Millie Jackson for years. I’ve always associated her with songs about being the other woman, but this is more my style.

**welcome2thejam** (9): The righteous fury emanating from her, great performance. Just wish it didn't end so abruptly.

**jman457** (8.1): almost instincyly gave this a low score because I thought it was a m*n

**freeofblasphemy** (8): YES

## Cheated on Millie

**vayyiqra** (6): foreboding title

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): This is in a similar boat to the Diana Ross pick I made; I wanted another track but picked this one. When searching for an Aretha song, one of my favorite 70s Aretha tracks is Daydreaming. However, I felt that the whole album should be rated (please note I have a very dodgy understanding of the rules of re-rating songs), so I thought a track off a movie would be a nice mirror to Super Fly. Since this is somewhat long and ballad-adjacent, I assumed it would be out fairly quickly. But duh, it's Aretha, who transcends balladphobia at every turn.

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): Aretha sex jam somehow better than I expected

---

## Felt something (from the song)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Queen of music tbh

**akanewasright** (10): It’s Aretha and Curtis what did you expect?

**bbfan132** (10): aretha <3 <3 <3

**bo_g_o** (10): yeah I'm feeling this

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this would be my 11 in the main rate

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ugh so iconic. Love it and the en vogue cover so much

**MorrisFae** (10): Ooooooh when that choir hits while the bass takes over the low end? Peak music.

**seanderlust** (10): not her referring to her lover's "funky stuff"...ew michelle

**TiltControls** (10): You can't ask me to rate an Aretha song and not give it a 10. What a legend

**waluigiest** (10): it’s so magical and there’s so much of it

**Roxieloxie** (9.6): This is so sultry and fun god

**jsonphile** (9.5): I mean I legally can’t give Aretha lower than a 8 but if course this is also fantastic. It’s no Respect or Natural Woman but it’s still great

**sarcasticsobs** (8.7): long songs, baybeee!

**babadork** (8): The original Irene Cera version from Sparkle (1976) is great, and I should not have to go to YouTube if I want to hear it.

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Aretha Franklin was a pretty good singer

**jman457** (7.1): A bit too long, im sorry ms. Franklin

## Nope, not making the joke

**MadJohnBeard** (7): this one gets going over time, good buildup

**MNREDR** (7): Docked a point because it went on too long. I know Ms. Franklin has a lot of beautiful runs and ad libs in her but she needs to just cram them all into 3 minutes like contemporary singers do /s

**vayyiqra** (7): This starts good but doesn't go anywhere (I say, as a "Thank You For Talking To Me Africa" enjoyer, well aware of the irony)

## Care to explain yourself TK?

**kappyko** (7): I do not know why TK INSISTS that I am an Aretha Franklin hater when I am anything but!!!!! I've only listened to Young Gifted and Black from the 70s and it's great ofc.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.9): This song is too gorgeous. The swooning, enticing drums and Stevie's singing just touch me emotionally.

**flavasavavandal** (8): Fun fact, for Robert Christgau’s review of Innervisions, he called this the weakest song on the album. He’s wrong of course because Too High exists but he still has a point. Golden Lady isn’t exactly the song that makes me keep coming back to Innervisions. I mean I love the opening piano, and Stevie (as always) has a warmth and charisma that makes his songs irresistible. But the song is a bit too repetitive, and doesn’t end up feeling special enough in contrast to the other songs here. Still a great tune though

---

## Golden Scores

**austrosinitic** (11): Forget all the ten minute ballads, all the 80s and 90s throwbacks, or, heck, even all the songs on Key of Life (which I think is the better album!); this is the best song of all time, no question. Nothing else I've ever listened to the right tempo, the right production, or the right passion as much as this does.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Golden Lady is how I describe this emoji: 👩

**bbfan132** (10): the piano and the hook…. yes.

**Blisterman** (10): I love this song so much. Something about it just really speaks to a part of me that few songs reach.

**freeofblasphemy** (10): I can’t even describe what Stevie’s music does to me. It just touches me so much. Tearing up right now

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is so good… this is random but doing this rate immediately after High Concept Pop I feel like you can really hear the influence that Stevie had on Janelle during this track, so many songs on *The Archandroid* feel like they’re going for exactly this.

**kappyko** (10): He actually wrote this song about me sorry (reading the document, i honestly was not aware of the Cuban influence, kinda neat to see that it appears on this album more than just the very blatantly obvious DYWBAT

**waluigiest** (10): it’s so lovely and light and airy

**jsonphile** (9.5): Peter Quill singing to that woman in Guardians of the galaxy 2

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): You know what i was gonna be balladphobic on main but i woke up after one of the listening parties singing this and its quite :comfy:

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.4): Golden Gal

**BeauMeringue212** (9): They really asked Stevie how many key changes he wanted and he said yes

**bo_g_o** (9): this is the worst song on the album and yet it fucks hard

**celladonn** (9): This is just a lovely pop song

**MadJohnBeard** (9): when the key keeps changing higher and higher in the outro, I want it to never stop

**MorrisFae** (9): I think the absolute best thing about the classic 70's Stevie run is sitting back and just listening to the interplay of the instruments. Golden Lady especially almost sounds like there's about a dozen people playing totally different songs that by some cohere into something beautiful. I'm not as big a fan of the vocal melody on this, but it's the butter on top of a perfect piece of toast.

**qazz23** (9): nice key changes

**vayyiqra** (9): I love the Latin influence on this with the conga drums.

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): this feel's like the afterparty to "don't you worry bout a thing"

**babadork** (8): I love most most of Stevie Wonder’s love songs, but this one doesn’t quite do it for me lyrically.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): where

**ignitethephoenix** (8): for a second I thought this was about drugs again but Wikipedia thankfully confirmed that it is indeed a love song

**musical\_pyn** (8): wasn't feeling this one but as it went on I got more and more into it, the ending raises this up a few points

**runaway3212** (8): I fucking love gold I wish I was covered in it like that one lady from goldeneye sorry I literally do not care that I would do

**soggy\_charge9447** (8): I really like songs that build in energy like this one, Untitled by D’angelo, and Dreams and Nightmares by Meek Mill

## Looked directly at the sun too long

**jman457** (7.7): A sweet love song with a dynamic production that helps it not sound overly cheesy

**seanderlust** (7.5): giving this a seven and a half because what am I gonna do, tell stevie wonder he can't rhyme eyes with eyes with eyes? who the hell am I? 7.5

**Tadevos** (7.5): Fantastic chorus, especially with the synth flourish after the lyric. This song also features the best Stevie Wonder Key Change on the album, for which I award +.5.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I love the melody in this one!

**TiltControls** (7): It's cute, but feels a little outmatched by the rest of the album

## We got another Stevie can see truther, throw him in the pit

**2dina3dworld** (10): “looking at your hands” - how can Stevie look when he can’t see?
