**gowestyoungkanye** (7.8): I love the xx and think they’re pretty underrated as pop artists (though I see why people tend to shove them under the indie umbrella). This is a lovely little track but does suffer from being forgettable and a lack of enunciation contributes, I have no idea what some of the lyrics are.

**strawberryswing1** (10): Ughhhhhh I love the early music from the xx and I love this! This is one of my favorite songs by them and I’m really happy that it squeezed it’s way into day 3. Also read u/radiofan15’s comment because I second every part of it.

---
##Close

**radiofan15** (10): Because of how little thus sub talks about The XX my guess is that r/popheads is XXphobic and they shouldn't be because they're so gay and moody and Oliver is daddy (he can British-raw me everyday all day) and Jamie is cute and talented and... did I mentioned they're moody? Yes, and it shows in this song in which the compromise between the band's usual minimalistic style and desire to go cinematical at the second half creates such a gorgeous overall track that fites like a glove with Luhrmann's moody adaptation.

**CarlieScion** (9): this is beautiful

**enecks** (9): What the fuck is actual talent doing a good job doing here, shoo before you embarass yourself

**robbiec\_** (9): I love you

**tapdancingpig** (9): The song is too long, but it’s incredibly well produced and emotional. The guy kind of has a bit of a bananis and avocadis voice and “together, to be” gets old at some point (before the strings come in and save it), but it’s a marvelous song and it’s well used in the movie.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): The xx can literally do no wrong and this is definitely one of their more underrated tracks, it feels like it could fit right on Coexist. I feel like many will hate that repetitive percussion but I love it.

**1998tweety** (8.4): This is chill and soothing, but I feel like they have a lot more stronger songs so in comparison this feels weak.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): very nice

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): A chill, moody XX song. Like many of their better songs, this is good "it's freezing outside and i'm vaguely depressed" mood music. I really like the string build near the end though, it takes what could be on any XX album and gives it the cinematic soundtrack feel. The last minute is really menacing too, I like how it fades into just the drum.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I was falling asleep until it got all dramatic with those strings

**notdallin** (7.2): it’s a the xx song for sure, a below-average-but-still-pretty-good-because-it’s-the-xx song, but it is so out of place on this soundtrack. This album is all about maximalist party music and over the top instrumentation; in what world does the xx fit that description at all?

**jamesfog** (7): A little empty to be 5 and a half minutes long

**Roxieloxie** (7): this song is probably better in the context of the movie but by itself it's to slow for me, however i do like the strings towards the end

##Apart

**followingfreeways** (6): yawn,,, i remember trying to force myself to like the xx in middle school because they were cool or whatever but i never got into them

**Raykel** (6): I mean yeah it's pretty but I'm boredt

**ZankeeZero** (6): okay, i know this is like sorta controversial but i'm just not the biggest fan of violins and it felt like they were supposed to be the explosion point of this song. otherwise, it was boring and though i sorta liked the beeps it wasn't enough to save this song.

**luigi\_is\_better** (5): im giving this song a neutral score because the xx reminds me of someone that was very special to me and now we don't talk anymore (by charlie puth featuring selena gomez) hope it doesn't interfere with its results.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): hmmmm

**TragicKingdom1** (5): boring but i like the dinging noise

**twat\_brained** (4.7): there's only like 3 words said throughout half the song, and the instrumentation feels so unnecessarily sparse at times. Lorde isn't a thing yet, you can't do that! This would've been much better as a 3:20 length song

**kappyko** (4.5): ok im as much a fan of the xx as anybody else but this is like the weirdest pace killer lol

**hikkaru** (3): I fell asleep

**gowestyoungkanye** (8.6): Banger. Just an out and out banger. And who the fuck thought Miguel and the Chemical Brothers needed to collaborate? So. Good. (And Lorde’s menacing ‘there it is’ — FUCK ME.)

**strawberryswing1** (7.5): I would really love this song if someone other than Miguel was singing it. I like Miguel but his voice doesn’t fit in at all with the song to me. Nonetheless, it’s still got great production and Lorde’s creepy little “*there it is*” peppered in the song elevate it to a higher level. 

---
##Football

**hikkaru** (10): the production goes tf off wow

**kappyko** (10): there it is AASAAAAAAAAAAAA THIS IS IT

**radiofan15** (10): OK, this bops hard and that drop HOLY SHIT. The Chemical Brothers are so underrated and deserved to break into the worlwide markets a long time ago... also Miguel was a killer fit for the song and Lorde doing just her "there it is" really set the mood for everything it cames afterwards.

**turtle-thief** (10): I wish I liked more things by the chemical brothers cause this is straight up fire. Lorde's bit is too good and miguel carries the song perfectly.

**Banananaise** (9): lmao this is lit

**CarlieScion** (9): this goes hard

**robbiec\_** (9): this is another mess but it’s so bombastically messy I love it I think that RRRRRRRR noise brings so much dread and drama naaah baby

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): now this is a fucking epic soundtrack song

**Shippy** (9): this was so interesting

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This is the hardest instrumental on the entire rate. The Chemical Brothers murder this shit and Miguel is one of the only people to get this weird-ass electronic beat to not only work but sound suave as fuck. Lorde’s small contribution to this track is very much appreciated, and the chorus is so choppy and odd and I love it so much.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this SLAPS hard

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): is that lorde lol

**Roxieloxie** (8): there it is

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Lorde whispering “There it is” gives me life.

**luigi\_is\_better** (7.5): this song sounds like simple things which is also by Miguel but i love that song so i also love this one

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): oh my god i was so confused for a whole 2 minutes because i thought it said My Chemical Romance ft. Miguel and the dubstep beat did not help at all i just thought i was losing my shit even more. anyway yeah this is fine.

##American Football

**1998tweety** (7.3): This also feels like a grower.

**enecks** (7): I'd like to think this title is on some evangelion shit. This is (Not) A Game

**vodkainsipido** (7): weak for a miguel track, good overall

**twat\_brained** (6.2): Is this dubstep? I don't know. What I do know is that this is neither a game nor something I'd want to listen to again. The only TCB song I know is "Galvanize" and judging from that I thought'd this'd be much better. I don't know why.

**notdallin** (5.3): the intersection of these three very different artists really doesn’t work. The Chemical Brothers are way too meticulous for Miguel’s fluid adlib… and Lorde’s contribution was limited to a sample of a sentence she said one time out of context

**mudkip1** (2): what even am i listening to

**gowestyoungkanye** (8): It’s easy to think ‘Kanye didn’t do much’ but considering drums are his weakness, he did more than you’d think he did.

**strawberryswing1** (10): At first, I was really underwhelmed with this remix. The original has a faster pace and packs more punches. I still prefer the original, but this one is quite special as well -- arguably, the production matches the lyrics even better, and Kanye of course makes his own interesting twists on it that I like, like the elephants and wind instruments at the end.

---
##Kanye in 2014

**Roxieloxie** (10): This version feels so much powerful, like the scene right before someones about to go fight someone

**skargardin** (10): I’m - I wasn’t expecting it to actually be better than the original!!

**turtle-thief** (10): It's just as good as the pop version, but it does feel more cinematic.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): I've been hoping for more Kanye & Lorde since uhh checks notes my entire fucken life

**enecks** (9): nice try Kanye but I'm not dragging any of Lorde's songs

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I would honestly love to hear Kanye produced Lorde songs. They really suit each other well.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): I definitely prefer this version of the song. The dark, gloomy production fits the tone better, almost giving it this apocalyptic feel that really works. I wish Kanye and Lorde had more of a collaboration history, cause their only crossover came out this good.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): I mean it’s kinda the same song but eerier

**Leixander** (8.5): ominous and has a nice atmosphere, could do better with a kanye verse tho!

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): i wish ye did a verse

**ZankeeZero** (8.5): wig

**notdallin** (8.1): So Kanye West is on 2/3 of the albums in this rate… but not on the one you would think  [Editor’s note: The racism jumped out!]

**hikkaru** (8): Original outbopped

**radiofan15** (8): Look, I love Kanye I will defend him till death, MAGA and everything, but he took two whole points out of the song, even if the minimalistic beat does a better job than the original in highlighting the lyrics and fitting better with the movie's athmosphere.

**Raykel** (8): This is gonna get so stomped on. All I can say is Kanye gave it a different vibe and it works for me.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): this is a lot better woah

**twat\_brained** (7.9): This doesn't sound too bad but I do not like the man who made this remix, and when I've had the perfection that is the original, nothing else will satisfy.

**1998tweety** (7.8): I mean I don't want to take off points since I technically like the song, but this remix only really makes sense in the context of the film, you replay a song that was played earlier but switch it up a bit. When listening to the album it ends up feeling too repetitive, especially cause the gap between the 2 instead that big and the songs are long. With all that being said I just don't find this remix nearly as appealing as the original.

##Kanye in 2018

**jamesfog** (7.5): Original better

**CarlieScion** (7): not as good as the OG

**gannade** (7): much better than the original

**robbiec\_** (6): kind of pointless like it’s pretty much only here for its namesake

**tapdancingpig** (6): Look, this is very well done technically, but 1. The original has a soft spot in my heart, and I miss the giant nature of the chorus and 2. I refuse to be objective with Kanye. After all the bullshit he’s said and done, he doesn’t deserve that from me.

**kappyko** (5): this is badass actually EDIT: nvm

**static\_int\_husp** (5): I don't really like this version of the song. The original version had a strong, driving instrumental that made it the banger it is. This instrumental is a little slow and causes a wierd tension between Kanye's production and Lorde's singing. At the very least, they should have re-recorded Lorde's part to better match the new production.

**raicicle** (4): okay but when you think about it this is just the original but with bad choir oos and cheap garageband piano samples so i have to laugh

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): I don’t even know why this version exists, it isn’t very different from the original and if this is the only collaboration we get from Kanye and Lorde I will be massively disappointed considering she was supposed to be on Yeezus.

**selegend** (3): Unnecessary tbh

**PuggleMaster** (2): I'm always told how Kanye is a producer genius or whatever, but this is the most underwhelming remix/rework.

**gowestyoungkanye** (8): However, Babes Wodumo definitely is my kind of girl. Her voice is so rich, wow. Love the all night section of the song too.

**Strawberryswing1** (7.5): This song had an interesting ride in our rate and I’m surprised it made it so far. There was a point in the beginning where this had a worse average than the interlude. Honestly it didn’t jump out to me the first time, but on relisten I recognize that the production is really poppy and can see why people really like it. 

---
##ᶢǃʱòm

**turtle-thief** (11): It gives me a sense of hope and calmness but at the same time it's a danceable bop. What else could you ask for, appart from the amazing african influences, the overall positive energy and the moving delivery by Babes Wodumo.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): I really want to hear Zacari and Tinashe do a song together

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this made me wanna shake my ass

**Roxieloxie** (10): danceable bop

**twat\_brained** (10): This is like "Too Good" by Drake and Rihanna, but like, too good for either artist. Babes knows how to deliver the goods on vocals, so +2 on that front. This is surprisingly one of the better songs in this rate, color me shocked.

**CarlieScion** (9): BOP

**ZankeeZero** (9): an extremely catchy carribean pop bop! we might stan a lil.

**radiofan15** (8.5): OMG THIS BEAT, Drake was surely crying in the corner for not being able to get it for Scorpion. This Afro-Beat banger sort-of kinda dones't seems to do anything to the movie but I don't care because this shit is catchier than Malaria. Also that intro in Spanish... Kendrick, I see you motherfucker.

**Shippy** (8.5): this was fun

**1998tweety** (8.2): This has a nice beat and the chorus is really groovy, but some of the lyrics are questionable or bad.

**enecks** (8): mmm zacari's smooth

**jamesfog** (8): A highlight

**Leixander** (8): kiki riki kiki do you love are you riding

**notdallin** (8): oh my word! oh my gosh! Everybody say kikiritikiki! Everybody say ung'bhasobheung'gudlukeksalfkndjlksnljwiuqqiusijsa’imkjlaaaajnflelcwiescleliqiqiossl!!!!

**tapdancingpig** (8): A bop mixed in with the dark rap tracks.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): mild bop, i like the "kikirikikititikitki" hook

**kappyko** (7.5): kendrick introducing the world to zacari was a gr8 decision because i love his voice

**robbiec\_** (7): OKAY


##EDM

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The instrumental kinda bops but I never found myself returning to this at all. However, the chorus is wonderful, and I wish the entire song had that energy.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): not sold on this one yet

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4.5): this was confusing

**gannade** (4): the interlude was promising and then we got this

**gowestyoungkanye** (8.1): A continuation of the themes from Meltdown, I love that repetitive sound in the background of the track (like a hollow clap almost?). Tove sounds so good.

**strawberryswing1** (9.5): I absolutely love this song and it has a lot of repeatability too. I was hoping for it to make top 10 but this is close enough. 

---
##I’M SCREAMING

**CarlieScion** (10): we love a swedish Queen

**gannade** (10): lowkey better than tove los normal music

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the “oh-oh” sounds so similar to “Habits (Stay High), another Tove song. Anyone else notice this?

**rotating3Dtext** (10): idk why I like this so much. so dramatic

**PuggleMaster** (9): Does Tove sound like Miley Cyrus on this song to anyone else?

**tapdancingpig** (9): I haven’t watched this movie in ages (I don’t remember liking it, especially because of the decision to split the movie up), but this song is a PERFECT thematic fit for the movie/Katniss, in addition to being a really bloodydamn good song.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): love the emotion on this...a very well written song that's catchy as well

**twat\_brained** (8.7): "I can take bullets to the heart" Didn't Katniss get a bullet to the chest rather than the heart? Also it's interesting how we go from this to "they used to shout my name now they whisper it". I just love Tove, honestly.

**1998tweety** (8.6): Tove's voice suits this well.

**enecks** (8): Tove Lo is good

**Leixander** (8): QoTC goat album

**turtle-thief** (8): Do y'all remember when Tove Lo wasn't the queen of the disco tits?

**notdallin** (7.7): goes for a little long but it’s vintage Tove Lo and that deserves an upvote I mean 7.7

**kappyko** (7): catchier but also less distinct than the previous track

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): remember when it looked like Tove Lo was going to have a career? simpler times :)

##...

**radiofan15** (6.8): Ok, i'm quite impressed that this quite fits with the movie's themes and also works as a separate piece of art. I'm not really sold on the poppy athmosphere (this is the prelude to the climax of the franchise girl, you could have tried to do something grittier) but I can live with that... thank God it's not like that Churches' song!.

**ExtraEater** (6): could've been better with a different singer

**luigi\_is\_better** (6): it honestly sounds like a demo and is not a bad song but it feels like misses something

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Kinda a forgettable Tove Lo song? I always skipped this, sorry puppet queen.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): this the disco titty girl but boring. what the fuck is play pretending

##Robbie Listens For The Plot

**robbiec\_** (2): this is so throwaway and even trying to tie it in with the movie I really doubt Katnis thinks she’ll be forgotten lol

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): I loved this song before I was even an Ariana stan. She sounds lovely, but Major Lazer’s production can’t be discounted either — that big, percussive drop with the bird-like sounds? So, so good. It plays in so well to ‘up on the mountain top’, I see a lush jungle when I listen to this song and I love it so much!

**strawberryswing1** (10): What can I say, I’m a basic bitch that loves everything Ariana puts out. The production is absolutely wonderful and Ariana’s voice is heavenly as normal. Poo, you’re dead to me. 

---
##Female God

**robbiec\_** (11): I literally cannot stan anyone harder right now than I do Ariana Grande this song was part of my summer 2015 soundtrack which was very transitional in my life so to throw feelings at a soundtrack song feels a bit basic but this is the best iteration Major Lazer’s melting pot of global EDM blending and Pop Drama Ariana it’s really such a slap

**selegend** (11): This is one of Ariana’s best songs, honestly

**didney-worl** (10): underrated af

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is a “Break Free”-tier bop im literally quivering

**PuggleMaster** (10): If All the stars wasn't in this rate this totally would've been my 11

**turtle-thief** (10): This soundtrack is on a combo of amazing tracks and this one just adds to it. I'm so mad that it never gained that much air play. Major Lazer will surely be missed after their last album.

**1998tweety** (9): Why wasn't this pushed more? It bops.

**jamesfog** (9): Remix slightly better

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): this is SUCH a bop i can't believe I hadn't listened to it before. definitely the highlight of the album for me. Ariana's voice just sounds like it was made for this beat

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): MAJOR BOP ALERT!!! This should’ve been huge, the pre-chorus is wonderful and the drop is so great, and honestly it’s one of my favorite Ariana songs.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): The best Major Lazer songs usually have a good mix of their electropop and dancehall styles, as well as a well chosen guest singer. This does that really well, it's not quite Lean On but it's a good dance bop.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): great drop, ari has great vocals for an EDM song

**Raykel** (8.2): Sounds a bit dated now but still bops as hard

**gannade** (8): why is this song better than ari’s entire discography wtf

**Leixander** (8): How have I not heard this before wow

**twat\_brained** (7.8): Not sure Major Lazer is necessarily the best fit for Ari but she sounds fantastic as ever on here. I could do with a better post-chorus drop, though, there's plenty of potential in this song.

##Male God

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Ariana sounds great but Major Lazer’s production is kind of annoying.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): don't forget to stream thank u, next!

**tapdancingpig** (7.3): Really fun little bop, but it’s a little odd in context of everything around it.

**radiofan15** (7.2): if Bruno Mars can make a Twilight song, why can't Pete Davidson's ex fiance and Major Lazer of all artists? In spite of some trendy production (it's a Major Lazer song after all) and some weird choice in lyrics (Mockingjay Pt. 1 might be the most innapropiate movie of the whole franchise to include a love song, especially an upbeat one) this one is a bop and i'm not complaining that it exists, after all the soundtrack certainly needs an upbeat song somewhere to counteract so many somber tracks. *[Editor’s note: Addressing Ariana as “Pete’s ex” is a CHOICE]*

**Banananaise** (7): why are soundtrack songs always so underrated in pop artists' discographies? the warpy sounds in the chorus feel dated as hell

**CarlieScion** (7): good song but it really doesnt fit on the soundtrack lmao

**enecks** (7): I like Major Lazer, I like Ariana, but this doesn't quite mesh

**Roxieloxie** (7): her vocals and the beat work really well together

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): i didn’t even know this existed lol

**skargardin** (6.5): This drop is even worse than I remember

**Shippy** (6): i luv ari but this isnt my favorite

**notdallin** (4.8): somebody needs to put that woodpecker out of his misery

**vodkainsipido** (4): nowhere near the songs of peace is the mission

**kappyko** (3): rumor has it the drop is samples of the sounds of actual kids getting killed in the hunger games. how sad!

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): Can Florence Welch so any wrong? My scorching hot take is that this song is superior to Young And Beautiful, spinning a more intricate narrative with Florence’s emotion-heavy vocals. Made me full body shiver on the bus.

**strawberryswing1** (6): Florence has a magnificent voice, but I hate it on this track.

---
##Champagne

**Leixander** (11): Imagine my disappointment when I switched from spotify to apple music and still see this song blocked. One of Florence's best, just FEEL the emotion in her voice!

**letsallpoo** (11): i think florence is the only person on this soundtrack to have read the book

**Banananaise** (10): this song in the trailer was like 50% of the reason i watched this movie

**didney-worl** (10): I can't believe p4k didn't like this song

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Florence absolutely kills this song. I love how she made green light a part of the song (thanks for actually connecting your song to the movie!) I actually did this song for my lyrical dance for my dance class 4 years ago, and we had yellow dresses too.

**jamesfog** (10): This song really surprised me, her vocals are great.

**kappyko** (10): she did what she had to do baby!!!

**tapdancingpig** (10): I don’t know what I expected, but it wasn’t this. And frankly, I should have expected this. Florence is often at her best on thrilling numbers like this. But I guess I forgot that after High As Hope was a quiet joy, but this was perfect.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Lana and Florence on the same soundtrack? Wow Jay-Z's mind is powerful. The bridge and last chorus takes me there.

**CarlieScion** (9): its very hard to rate this bc the YT version is pitched and it annoyed me, but i think the song itself is probably very good

**enecks** (9): I'd be lying if I didn't say this production feels a bit too crushed and artificial, but I'm giving it a good score because Florence is the best.

**followingfreeways** (9): WOW i am not usually a florence and the machine fan but this song is beautiful

**radiofan15** (9): Ok, Miss Welch didn't have to go of like that but she did and now here we are... in all seriousness through the vibey athmosphere is enervating and the lyrics are really great and surprisingly appropiate for the movie BUT the payoff at the end is kinda dissapointing considering how much buildup it has.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): holy fuck who told her she could snap like this

**notdallin** (8.6): Beautiful, soaring, unintelligible love song

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): This really feels like a soundtrack song. It's big and soaring and cinematic and that last chorus has such a huge punch.

**ZankeeZero** (8.5): this is a very generic flo ballad but its great

**Roxieloxie** (8.2): oh so Lana del rey and her arent the same person, well today i learned.

**twat\_brained** (8.2): Come on, Flo, give me something grand to work with! You're singing but the beat isn't keeping up with you, what the hell? I should be hearing "Hello" by Adele type levels of production against a voice like Florence. The second chorus is making up for it so let's hope the final minute of this song is nothing but a theatrical, overpowering showcase of vocals, percussion and instrumentation; as grand as Luhrmann went with this movie! It happened, but too late. And didn't even happen as big as I thought it would. Credit to Florence for bringing her musical style to this soundtrack but I wish the drums were mixed louder.

**turtle-thief** (8): Florence snapped in this, her vocals are amazing.

**Raykel** (7.2): God is singing

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Florence on the Gatsby soundtrack is a dream, and while this track doesn’t quite hit all the marks, the explosion of a final chorus makes the whole thing worth it.

##Prosecco 

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): A below average Florence song tbh. Also not sure whether to add or deduct points for literary references to the book the movie is based on.

**luigi\_is\_better** (6): it's a song from florence that has her scream-singing which means im probably not listening ever again but the production is very good so not a bad song at all

**robbiec\_** (6): queen of vocals but eeee

**rotating3Dtext** (6): I LOVE Florence… but this is weird

**gannade** (4): Florence stop making songs that all sound like some dystopian gospel challenge

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): of course there is a florence track

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): We chose to include this one so all the albums would have the same number of tracks, and Bagbak was used on the trailers for Black Panther so it was perfect. I love Vince Staples in general, and he killed this.

**strawberryswing1** (10): It’s hilarious that the one song in this rate is one of the highest ranking. This and the low averages in the top ten (we still are only in the 8’s average wise!) show that these soundtracks aren’t a huge hit with popheads.

##Vince

**enecks** (10): Sorry for betraying you Vince, but I had to give a 11 to Gotye. Still, this is amazing. Big Fish Theory most underrated album 2017.

**raicicle** (10): vince is an ally of the gays

**robbiec\_** (10): still a banger

**Roxieloxie** (10): FUCK THE GOVERNMENT

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): sick

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): there's a very good chance this is Vince's best song ever. just off the chart energy levels.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This song was amazing to see live, and I've been in love with it ever since. The beat goes incredibly hard, and Vince gives the song so much energy. The final verse with "TELL THE PRESIDENT TO SUCK A DICK BECAUSE WE ON NOW" is one of my favorite parts of Big Fish Theory, which is already a fantastic album.

**twat\_brained** (10): Okay, this is great! Why didn't Kendrick AND Vince curate the soundtrack? Given the field of most of these songs I wouldn't be surprised to see this go top 10 again!

**vodkainsipido** (10): i need more bft in my life

**radiofan15** (9.6): FUCK, THIS GOES HARD... and just checking on his album it has production by Sophie (hurra?) and Flume and collabs with Kendrick, Damon Albarn and Justin Vernon? SIGN ME THE FUCK UP

**CarlieScion** (9): yas

**kappyko** (9): tbh if u wanted a 45 song rate u couldve added the florence and sbtrkt song! never listened tho. i love this song but ionno if it should be here

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): not even in my top 5 of big fish but still so good. honestly if yall haven't listened to that album just do it

**rotating3Dtext** (9): is it the same score I gave it on the 2017 hip hop rate? (no, it’s higher)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): One of the highlights of last year’s Big Fish Theory, BagBak is just quip after quip in rapid fire succession over a banging beat. What more can you even ask for honestly.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I don’t like rap, but I can get behind this. I don’t know why I like this so much, but I do.

**notdallin** (8.3): Ain’t nobody got that wordplay like Vince: “Boy I’m Buoyant”? Your fave could never

**followingfreeways** (8): I like his sound a lot

##R. Kelly

**Mysario** (8): hmm

**skargardin** (8): .5 *[Editor’s note: I just noticed this...if this was a typo and meant to be a score of 8.5, it still doesn’t change the song’s ranking.]*

**1998tweety** (7.7): Originally I gave this a 7.3 in its rates, but I'm bumping it up here. The production is very good.

---
##Good Taste

**luigi\_is\_better** (11): finally giving an 11 to vince! i legit feel so bad for not doing the rate that yeah right was in so here's my chance to give a kendrick/vince collab its due. this song has such a night vibe and i dont know how to explain but i just really love it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): One of the frontrunners for best song of the year, any genre. Vince Staples murders this song, and hearing this during the casino fight in the movie is a top 10 cinema moment of 2018. Kendrick Lamar is on his best form on the entire album, the instrumental is a certified slapper, and Yugen FUCKING Blakrok, some random rapper, somehow ethers everyone involved and gives the best verse on the entire damn album. The effects all over this song are sublime, and the chorus is beyond killer.

**vodkainsipido** (11): is vince a gay icon? [x] yes

**ZankeeZero** (11): honestly the most underrated song on the soundtrack and for no reason, the sample is catchy as fuck and Yugen absolutely did her thing.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This goes hard and bops at the same time, and I love it.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): goddamn this slaps hard

**mudkip1** (10): THIS SONG IS FUCKING INCREDIBLE!!! if sophie stans we stan!

**PuggleMaster** (10): whew Vince came for WIGS i'm pleasantly shook by this

**radiofan15** (10): I can forgive how the relation between the lyrics and the movie requires some heavy mental gymnastics because it was used as the background of an action scene but what I can't forgive it's the blink-and-you-miss-it Cyborg and Riddler references in Yugen Blakrok's verse, like dude, this is a Marvel soundtrack, you're dead to me... but leaving that aside this FUCKING BEAT is so sick might have sneezed on it multiple times, and the chorus is weirdly catchy with the whole YOU'RE DEAD TO ME! Fucking Sounwave snapped so hard with this motherfucker

**raicicle** (10): vince is an ally of the gays

**robbiec\_** (10): omg this slaps so hard they all bring IT and in the movie it just goes off

**Shippy** (10): that was amazing

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Vince is good as usual but Yugen Blakrok is really good. I'll be interested to hear more from her in the furture, hopefully

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Vince Staples has a talent for rapping over basically anything and making it incredible. This track has probably the most experimental sound on the album, which is interesting because it was produced by Ludwig Goransson, the film's composer. All three verses on this song, including Kendrick in an uncredited feature, bring it and make it an incredible banger. Just when you think the song can't keep the hype for the whole run, Yugen Blakrok comes in at the end and brings it home. Amazing song.

**turtle-thief** (10): Yugen's verse kills me everytime, this track deserves as much recognition as "All the stars".

**kappyko** (9.5): omg this is the scariest song that has ever been written all talent

**twat\_brained** (9.2): Okay, the beat here fucking SLAPS. I don't even remember nor do I really care what Vince or Blakrok said here, this is a total banger!

**enecks** (9): This slaps. It's no Yeah Right, but oh yeah this is good. I can't believe Disney let Vince Staples have that butterfly line.

**followingfreeways** (9): this is Such a bop!!!

**notdallin** (8.8): This is straight up cinematic hip-hop at its best. Furious beat with a-grade vocals and slick lyrics. Absolutely amazing.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): you are dead to me

**Roxieloxie** (8.7): Hype af

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): you're dead to me

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): /u/letsallpoo you're dead to me

**1998tweety** (8.3): Godney and Legend Mix outsold but this still bops.

**CarlieScion** (8): will this song get high scores bc it comes right after the ways?

**tapdancingpig** (8): So apparently I really like Vince Staples? The guy’s a really effective rapper, and he’s good at finding great producers (he has songs with SOPHIE, for God’s sake). Anyway, this song is a lot of fun.

**jamesfog** (7.5): You're dead to me

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): An absolute 11 of a song, the song that got me into Kanye West (I was only 13 and white with protective parents when it came out, mind you). I truly believe this is a contender for Kanye’s best song. The narrative woven on it is sublime, and Frank-Ocean-before-he-was-Frank-Ocean’s philosophical chorus is stunning. And that’s before we even touch the production, the heart of the track. I love this song so much I can’t even begin to describe it. Except — it’s been my alarm song for the last four years and I don’t hate it. At all. Which anyone with an alarm song can tell you is a miracle.

**strawberryswing1** (10): An incredible song and one of Kanye’s best, which is a triumph considering his very impressive discography. This song would probably win with a 9+ average in a different rate, for better or for worse. This song is perfect from start to finish. Who else here remembers when “Sunglasses and Advil, last night was mad real” was the \#cool photo caption to use?

##2011 Kanye

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): Can y'all please let my 11 win for once? Can y'all please let Frank Ocean win for once? Can y'all PLEASE let a critically acclaimed, message-driven masterpiece win for once? P.S. watching this video after Kanye's antics this year almost brought me to tears. I miss the real ye.

**CarlieScion** (10): B O P

**enecks** (10): Yeah I know Kanye's a dick, but I'll treat this as a Frank Ocean song, because holy fuck his hook dominates this song. And this song dominated whole years of my life. That sample. That evocative as hell imagery. Would've been my 11 but Kanye's verse is kinda weak in comparison to the firey as hell imagery of THAT Jay-Z verse.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is such a good collab, Frank, Jay and Kanye’s parts all work really well together. I’m not the biggest fan of Frank but his hook is one of the best things I’ve heard from him. Just don’t get why this was on the soundtrack lol.

**Mysario** (10): not the right song but www.kanyezone.com

**radiofan15** (10): Let me start this minireview by calling out MR. KNOWLES FOR KEEPING US EATING DICK BY NOT GIVING US WATCH THE THRONE ON SPOTIFY YOU DIRTY MOTHERFUCKER... anyway, this is a banger, a new classic that introduced Frank Ocean to the general public and proved that Kanye's winning victory lap in MBDTF wasn't a fluke and that he is indeed one of the greatest producers of our time. Pure musical crazyness and I love every second of it, even the weird-ass outro that keeps popping up in several tracks of the album... also also FUCK YOU JAY-Z NO ONE LIKES YOU OR TIDAL YOU DAMN DIRTY ASSHOLE STOP THE DICK SWINGING CONTEST LET THE KIDS HAVE THE MUSIC WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE EVENTUALLY.

**robbiec\_** (10): Why is this here though????????????? 

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Perhaps one of Frank Ocean’s best choruses, No Church In The Wild is easily one of the most memorable tracks off Watch The Throne. There’s really nothing about this song that isn’t fantastic, but I will say the instrumental is underrated.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of my two absolute favorites on Watch the Throne (along with Otis). The beat is huge and cinematic, a perfect opening to this big collab project from two of the biggest rappers alive. Frank's hook builds the epic mood even more, and I love the wordplay of the circular nature of belief. Jay and Kanye's verses are both short and to the point but set up the themes of the album well, with religion, sex, belief, and wealth touched on. The outro with the James Brown sample wailing and animal sounds mixed into the beat gets me so hyped every time.

**ZankeeZero** (10): the FUCKING OUTRO!!!!!! an absolute serve and an 11 contender.

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): really amazing, but why is there that weird auto part in the middle

**jamesfog** (9.5): The hook is iconic.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): ok this isn't really fair. hope this doesn't miss top 10 bc kanye

**notdallin** (9.3): rare sighting of Jay out-rapping Kanye but the real winner is the thought-provoking hook from fresh-off-an-EP newbie Frank Ocean, where a towering hierarchy of rulers eats itself and becomes one eternal round over electric guitar

**followingfreeways** (9): okay wow, i didnt expect to like this song so much. im not a rap person or even a kanye person but damn this was impressive!!! i loved it

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): sick beat but the dream’s part sucks

**1998tweety** (8.8): Has a nice beat.

**twat\_brained** (8): The only good part about this song is Frank and the guitar riff. Jay and Kanye add nothing of value, and "you will not control the threesome" is rapey as hell

##2018 Kanye

**luigi\_is\_better** (6.5): i think this is the first time that im rating a song that has my favorite artist since i wasn't really comfortable rating blonde so im gonna only talk about his part which is good but sounds like his old demos. also, the autotune was not a good choice at all

**gowestyoungkanye** (11): Yes, Strawberry and I have the same 11 but I promise it’s not premeditated! I was really stuck between Meltdown and No Church In The Wild but I had to give it to Meltdown because it is one of my favourite Lorde songs of all time (I think I mentioned Meltdown and Magnets when we did her Top Ten Pop Ten because they’re both top five songs). There are so many different (legendary) people on this song and it shouldn’t work, but it absolutely does. I think a lot of my love is contained in the song’s narrative. It’s poetic cinema. I absolutely love it. She even got Pusha not to talk about coke for one song. And that line — ‘respect comes from the money or your blood’, that’s murder. Plus — Haim’s ‘I’m your undertow’ chorus at the end makes me lose my shit every time. Meltdown is made up of so many incredible elements and they ALL work perfectly together.

**strawberryswing1** (11): UGH this song is INCREDIBLE. I am a bit salty because for a good chunk of time this was winning, but then it dipped to #6, and it’s finally on #5. Everything about this song is amazing -- Stromae’s instrumental production is amazing on it’s own. This song has a sense of urgency to it, mirroring that it’s written for an action movie, that just gets me hyped. The different artists work so well together and all bring A+ lyrics inspired by the novel together. Lorde doesn’t collab often so this is truly a one of a kind song.

##Chernobyl Exclusion Zone IRL

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (11): Literally one of my favorite songs of all time. I fully expect it to get voted out on the first day but such is life

**hikkaru** (11): What a weird group of people. It works so well though

**TragicKingdom1** (11): major major major banger. all of the elements seem SO disparate but flow into each other to make something truly special. one of my favorite Lorde songs

**1998tweety** (10): HAIM and Q-Tip might have small parts but I feel like everyone's contributions make this song what it is. I don't know where this plays in the movie but its a great opener for the album.

**ExtraEater** (10): works surprisingly well

**kappyko** (10): i lvoe this disaster of pop excess. more music needs to sound like this

**Leixander** (10): this collab works somehow! if it had a bit more HAIM i would be happier though.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i want Lorde and HAIM to collab again

**radiofan15** (10): Who would have though that Stromae, Lorde and King Push wouldwork so well on a track together? Of course Stromae's original track, Merci, was basically begging to be sampled by a hip-hop musician (maybe not in it's entirety but anyway... i'm glad he was given main artist credit instead of being a feature) and Lorde and Push had their respective 2018 controversies involving Whitney Houston's bathroom so the connections will always always there. I find it quite amazing how Push works so well in a PG-rated track, how Lorde's non-chorus is such a banger, how Q-Tip's misplaced presence makes everything just more charming and how HAIM's harmonies at the end creates such an out-of-body experience HOLY SHIT with the correct promo this might have smashed and take Lorde's (wrong) ettiquete of one hit wonder out of the GP's mind. Also if some other track wasn't in the track, this might have been my 11.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): all these people, wow

**skargardin** (10): On this episode of “unexpected collabs that work unreasonably well”

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is a huge mess but they somehow pull it off and it works really well. The song Homemade Dynamite Remix wishes it was.

**turtle-thief** (10): High energy, dope verses, amazing production, great chorus and HAIM is doing their thing. I love every second of it.

**ZankeeZero** (10): this is REALLY good, their dynamic together is surprisingly amazing and i'm really glad this happened

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): There alot going on here but I'm feeling it

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I never thought I would hear Lorde, Pusha T and Stromae on the same song, but here we are. And it’s actually really good!

**jamesfog** (9.5): HAIM and Lorde? Wig.

**enecks** (9): OK, any song with Lorde in this album's getting a minimum of 9. I dig this - as well as everyone playing different roles within the plot.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): hell yeah

**notdallin** (8.7): it’s like someone made a board of trendy artists and started throwing darts furiously and said “yeah ok”

**twat\_brained** (8.6): This is what the Homemade Dynamite Remix tried to be and it sounds fantastic. My only gripe is I don't know where Stromae is meant to fit into this

**luigi\_is\_better** (8.5): ok this is a very busy track but somehow... it works? stromae's instrumental is def the strong point, but all of the artists bring something to the table. a good start for sure

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): Pusha T & Lorde & Stromae collab album when

**Raykel** (8.2): I love all the features on this. They blend in really well together and having a whole group of people at the start of this album brings in some hype.

**Banananaise** (8): i didn't hate this as much as everyone else apparently did when it was released but it's also not as good as it could have been

**raicicle** (8): did the haim sisters save this? yes

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This is by far the funniest group of artists in the entire world, but I can’t sit here and lie and say this doesn’t bop. Pusha T is versatile as fuck over this dance beat, Lorde gives a solid hook, Q-Tip does his thing, and HAIM delivers an outro that somehow works.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): This sounds like 5 different songs playing on top of each other but I kinda like it? The rap verses feel a bit disjointed from the rest of the song, but otherwise I enjoyed this more than I thought I would.

##Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Video Games

**vodkainsipido** (8): all of the parts in this are strong but they don't quite fit together

**CarlieScion** (7): a nice intro

**mudkip1** (7): so much of this is good but it's so insanely disjointed that you just can't like it... disappointed so far

**robbiec\_** (6.5): this is a MESS but I don’t dislike it it’s just such a song that could only happen on a soundtrack

**Shippy** (4): oof dk i didnt like this

**gowestyoungkanye** (9.6): I actually prefer this single to All The Stars, I believe Pray For Me is on my most played this year list. I’m also glad that the Weeknd is in this rate. His pre massive fame Hunger Games Catching Fire song (Devil May Cry) is SO GOOD and SO UNDERRATED. But back to Pray For Me. The production, the story, Kendrick, the chorus, Abel’s voice, everything about this track is so good.

**strawberryswing1** (9.5): A very good pop song that got overplayed for me, sadly. 

---
##Lighting a Candle for Beto

**Mysario** (11): this song is so good, it's technically part of the MCU and therefore means WE'RE part of the MCU

**enecks** (10): I don't give a fuck that it's a watered down mix of Starboy and Sidewalks, this shit slappeth.

**gannade** (10): a bop and a half

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love this song I just wish it didn’t get overplayed.

**jamesfog** (10): Abel can do no wrong

**poppinmmolly** (10): bop

**tapdancingpig** (10): This song reminds me of the kinds of rap songs that were on the radio when I was young, back before I was tired of the genre, back when I enjoyed it.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Basically Starboy 2.0 but with Kendrick, and I'm not complaining. It's synthier and a little more grungy than Starboy, but it fits the tone of the movie and its world better. The hook is great and big sounding, easily one of Abel's best. Kendrick's verse is just all energy, and the song just kicks into overdrive and stays there.

**twat\_brained** (10): Ah, yes. I hear this on the radio pretty much every other week. And honestly, I'm glad he was chosen for this soundtrack; he's able to breathe life into it in a way that others haven't been able to do. Largely because of his voice.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): alalalalalalalalalalala

**radiofan15** (9.3): And this is how you close an album... after jumping back and forth between quality and garbage K-Dot and Selena's ex give us a banger to end all bangers with Abel's suave vocals and Kung Fu Kenny spitting like a dragon as usual. The beat is powerful and the chorus is such an earworm, i'm not surprised this was embraced by pop and rap audienced alike as soon as it came out.

**1998tweety** (9): I really like the intro to this song, that one bit makes me never skip this song.

**Leixander** (9): huge bopper

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Sounwave kills it again, with this track sounding like Starboy on crack, and The Weeknd gives one of the best choruses on the record. Kendrick gives a standard verse, but it just sounds great. This song deserved a video and deserved to be bigger.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): an EPIC collaboration, i find this song weirdly uplifting? like it makes my skinny white ass feel like a superhero :sad:

**notdallin** (8.6): I almost forgot that we’re all gathered together here to talk about pop music. This is probably the poppiest song on here, right?

**vodkainsipido** (8): the best weeknd song in a while, mdm can suck a dick!

##1 Like = 1 Prayer for Ted Cruz

**Banananaise** (8.5): something about the beat just reminds me TOO much of starboy

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): I wish it was more interesting

**Roxieloxie** (8.1): Oh hey I forgot about the weekend. This one feels like it could've been on DAMN.

**kappyko** (8): i like how it starts out like a starboy sounding song kinda. sounds a bit more like a mvoie soundtrack song than any other song on this album but its good man

**robbiec\_** (7.2): I hated this song when it came out but the use of the sounds from the music and that baseline are undeniable

**gowestyoungkanye** (8): The MV for this song is stunning, first of all, so vibrant and full of life. This track does have a certain irony to it (as does the whole soundtrack, and the film, when you remember Disney financed it). SZA’s vocals are pretty. It’s pretty in general.

**strawberryswing1** (9): Sadly radio overplay ruined this a little for me too, but it’s a great song where I have no idea what SZA is singing. This song was #2 for a short period, but the last few days of procrastinator scores lowered it to #3.

##All the stars are Kosher certified 

**PuggleMaster** (11): I just love how airy the production. SZA did that with the vocals, and while i don't really care about kendrick he isn't annoying so i don't mind.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (11): I thought this song was okay the first time I heard on it, but it grew on me a ton and I love it so much now. The production feels enormous and cinematic, but not out of place for the artists or the soundtrack. SZA's chorus is fantastic and soaring, and I know some people don't like Kendrick on here but I think he adds to the song well with his verse. Everything about this song is just building so much to the huge, incredible, gorgeous chorus, especially the epic prechorus with Kendrick's little harmonies which I just love.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): This was almost my 11! Just a beautiful, lush masterpiece of a song.

**enecks** (10): I don't give a shit that its a bit safe coming from both artists and that SZA's enunciation isn't the best - this is fucking incredible. The production is godly - that little duDU is infectious as hell. And I just get caught up in the emotion of the chorus so much. AND HOLY SHIT WHEN THE STRINGS COME IN LATER.

**ExtraEater** (10): compelling

**gannade** (10): i cnat understand a thing sza is saying but it bops pretty hard!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is what pop-rap songs should be. SZA sounds great and Kendrick’s rapping complements her. I also love the pulsing production a lot! SZA does need to enunciate better but I’m not going to hold it against her (I almost took off a 1/2 point but I felt mean).

**jamesfog** (10): So good

**Leixander** (10): all the stars are closuh

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): why is SZA singing about kosher

**selegend** (10): This isn’t really a 10, but it’s a bop and it deserves top 5.

**radiofan15** (9.5): Marvel has a really terrible track record when it comes to soundtrack songs and albums (the fact that their highlight before BP was an AC/DC compilation for Iron Man 2 says everything) so Kendrick, one of the best rappers currently working, working with up-and-comer SZA for the title track was already a huge improvement. Although the track gets somewhat drowned by Kendrick's surprisingly weak lyrical contributions (by his standars), SZA's delivery (as gibberish as it sounds) and the infectious catchiness works wonderfully... I can't wait for K-Dot and SZA to perform the song at the Oscars in route of their eventual lose against Gaga.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): huge grower bop, i love the atmosphere and it is cinematic af

**notdallin** (9.4): “Love. Is it anything and everything you hoped for? Or do the feeling haunt you?” this song does NOT get the recognition it deserves. Kendrick and SZA give memorable performances pillowed by cinematic strings and gritty beat. On paper it looks great and it completely meets expectations when it unfolds.

**didney-worl** (9): When Kendrick and SZA become Oscar nominees I'm gonna cry

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): this song REALLY grew on me. when it was first released i hated it and was so disappointed because i was expecting a lot. but after listening a few times and seeing in the credits i really like it. the first verson was better though

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I cannot, and will not, stop hearing "All the stars are kosher"

**tapdancingpig** (9): This is a fucking JAM!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): One of my favorite songs of the entire year, SZA honestly absolutely murders this track. This is rare for me to say, but I don’t really feel like Kendrick adds much besides those background moans. SZA’s chorus is one of the best in 2018, and her verse is literally everything. The instrumental is wonderful, and this deserves all the Oscar hype it’s been getting.

**turtle-thief** (9): If it wasn't for the fact that I want Gaga to win an oscar next year, I would say this song is 110% oscar material.

**ZankeeZero** (9): VERY good. SZA's chorus is just pure quality, and Kendrick does his thing too.

**1998tweety** (8.7): For the thing that holds this song back from being really good is that half the time I have no idea what SZA is saying. On some tracks its fine, but I feel like this song is trying to make a bigger message so we need to actually be able to hear it. Also are there 2 different versions of this song? It sounds different.

**kappyko** (8.5): kendrick is unfortunately boring on this but sza really transcended

**CarlieScion** (8): [insert joke about SZA's pronunciation]

**followingfreeways** (8): kendrick is good but Szas part really makes this song imo

**raicicle** (8): sza saving an average kendrick song

**robbiec\_** (8): this is CLEARLY a soundtrack song but omg the condensation of their respectable talents into a pop song is really quite something

##All the stars are non-kosher

**twat\_brained** (8): It sounds nice but I pulled up the Genius page just so I'd know what SZA says on the chorus. Even then, the second verse doesn't do much to aid matters.

**vodkainsipido** (8): kendrick's part: 6, sza's part: 10, (6 + 10) / 2 = 10 [Editor’s note: You tried sweetie] 

**skargardin** (7): I still can’t understand a word of what SZA’s saying on her verse

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): nothing special

**Overall average**: 7.342

**gowestyoungkanye**: Kendrick killed it, but he also had a lot of time to learn — I believe Jay started working on Gatsby all the way back in 2010. He easily made the most cohesive album, centring it on African musicians and sounds, and as Strawberry wrote, it’s a celebration of black excellence and James Blake.

**TragicKingdom1**: This album clearly shows a lot of talent and had a lot of thought put into it in terms of representation so I was very enthusiastic about its success. The highlights are definitely top notch bangers, but I feel like otherwise the production kinda blends together between songs and it doesn't quite come together as much as the potential is there. Still worth a listen though! [Grade: B+]

**radiofan15**: I wasn't as big of a fan of this album as most people when it came out and revisiting the whole project now I remembered why... too many dead spots, senseless features and lyrics without any point at all or relation to the movie, just the usual braggadocio. I didn't hate it at all (i'm kinda glad it exists because this is miles better than Suicide Squad's album and Marvel needed a well received soundtrack since like yesterday) and the highlights are really great but I would never listen to the album in full again... maybe Marvel might give Kendrick or other rapper (Kanye perhaps?) more time to make a sequel album. (Score: 6.6 OUT OF 10)

**enecks**: This is a pretty solid album. At its worst, it's a little conventional. At its best, it's basically a concept album where Kendrick plays both T'Challa and Killmonger.

**SendMeYourSATScores**: tbh never seen the movie but i don’t like super heroes

**Banananaise**: honestly just kind of boring

**letsallpoo**: i remember spending like an hour finding all of this album's damn duplicates for the popheads chart

**mudkip1**: the only cohesive album on this rate, everything else lacks a good concept

**Mysario**: solid hip-hop album that feels cohesive and clearly had some care put into it by Kendrick

**ExtraEater**: really cool soundtrack. it's like fun and stuff

**skargardin**: I can’t say that I’m a “fan” of most of the artists featured on this soundtrack but that being said, this album surprised me. All of the songs went hard as fuck. It’s definitely not something that I’d listen to repeatedly but it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

**kappyko**: its good. maybe too good for this rate tbh the other ones are more endearing for how much excess shits stuck in there. very artistic 4 sure tho

**ZankeeZero**: extremely atmospheric in the best way

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): ‘I made a little prison and I’m locking up everyone who’s ever laid a finger on me.’

**strawberryswing1** (10): Well, here we are -- another rate where Lorde dominates the top 10 but fell short of that #1 prize. Still, this is impressive as it stuck around #5 or so for the majority of the rate, and was at #3 until the last 10 or so scores came in. I enjoyed this song before I listened to the whole soundtrack -- I think the music video and her performance of it at the AMAs are incredible. I’ll love you forever my Lorde and saviour.

---
##Fire

**CarlieScion** (11): AAAAAA

**Raykel** (11): All these years later and I still get chills when she says "and I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me mmmmmmm"

**rotating3Dtext** (11): This classic song was my only nourishment during the great Lorde draught.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Probably Lorde's biggest banger. It's intesnse, fun, and has great lyrics.

**twat\_brained** (11): Y'all… I remember when she teased the lyrics way back when on her Twitter and Tumblr profiles. 4 years later… and I still just love this song so much. It brings me back to being a moody ass 16 year old who listened to Pure Heroine on repeat and loved The Hunger Games. What I was not ready for, however, was how I'd go full u/wonderbitch26 upon hearing this live on the Melodrama Tour. Since I'm rating this on Ella's birthday, I can't think of a greater gift to give her than her second rate win, courtesy of this song. If that doesn't happen then fuck it, I'm going full indiehead on your asses.

**enecks** (10): This is so god damn 2014 in every way and I love it. Lorde is amazing.

**followingfreeways** (10): this song is severely under loved in my Lorde library, and I thank this rate for making me realize this!! I love this song

**Leixander** (10): I'M DONE WITH IT WOO

**Mysario** (10): the main reason Lorde agreed to do this soundtrack was to show off this song

**poppinmmolly** (10): bop

**PuggleMaster** (10): one of my favorite lorde song's. This is definitely going top 10.

**radiofan15** (10): The only complain I can think of about the song is the way it was used in the movie. The film director Francis Lawrence had the perfect chance to use the nearly-acapella intro for the final scene of the movie and to have the credits to kick-off when the beat drops, it would have been so perfect! Just imagine it! Obviously not withthe ACTUAL final scene of the movie but the opportunity was there and Mr. Lawrence wasted it. Also this should have been nominated for the Oscars but instead we got that boring U2 song about Mandela and that song in that Christian movie nobody saw that was disqualified and it's space was left empty; such an injustice!

**Shippy** (10): queen of red orange yellow flicker beats sparking up her heart

**turtle-thief** (10): Lorde is really killing it, now, then, and let's be honest, she'll continue in the future.

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): time to blast this and overthrow the government

**1998tweety** (9.5): Wow she snapped a bit on this. This song along with Magnets are a good transition from PH to Melodrama.

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): This is not peak Lorde (not even peak early-Lorde), but I have such a soft spot for the song (plus, it’s super badass sounding).

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Doing the Lorde’s magic

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): LORD

**kappyko** (8.5): rumor has it this song inspired tinashe to condense this song into a bona fide hit we now treasure as "binaural test"

**notdallin** (8): it’s tough because we know what Lorde is capable of on pretty much everything else in her discography and this song just pales in comparison. The lyrics are pretty as usual but I’d rather just throw on Pure Heroine instead

##Water

**robbiec\_** (7): captures so much drama with nonsense

**selegend** (7): The remix that she performed on the Melodrama World Tour was so much better. Still a bop though

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This song is good but it’s really not one of my favorite Lorde tracks, and I never quite got the hype.

**luigi\_is\_better** (6): never understood the hype of this song. it sounds like a PH reject

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): don’t call me out but overrated

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5.5): I'm gonna be honest, every time I had heard this song before had been the rework, and I really just prefer that version in every way. The menacing tone of Lorde's lyrics and delivery really just fit better with the gloomy, more minimal production than with a club beat.

**gannade** (3): im going in hard, says the 100 pound New zealand white girl as she continues to write songs about crying in her bedroom *[Editor’s note: Those literally are not the lyrics]*

**Overall average**: 7.210

**gowestyoungkanye**: My connection to this album is so personal. It came out while I was in the hospital actively dying (I’m okay now! The four year anniversary is in a few weeks.) so I listened to it over and over killing time. Lorde debuted her live performance of Yelliw Flicker Beat at a festivalI was at, and she brought me to tears. While this isn’t the most objectively perfect album, I love it to bits and have replayed it for years.

**didney-worl**: so many bangers on this album

**TragicKingdom1**: This soundtrack has a really consistent mood that matches the tone of the movie superbly. I don't like all of the wide array of genres showcased here, but I appreciate what each song brings to the table. Some of the songs are totally outside of what I'd normally listen to but I really vibed with regardless. In terms of overall experience this is the best in the rate. Hopefully this doesn't get forgotten like the last two Hunger Games movies were! [Grade: A-]

**radiofan15**: In spite of a small detour, this is my favorite of the Hunger Games soundtracks and it's a shame that there wasn't one for the 4th movie, but anyways... Lorde does a fantastic job as curator, getting (mostly) sonically and lyrically fitting tracks for the whole album, creating a pleasant listening experience that works outside of its limits as an album for a film that it's just OK at the end of the day. [SCORE: 8.14 OUT OF 10]

**SendMeYourSATScores**: lol the first 2 movies are super fucking good but this one sucks

**Banananaise**: god lorde truly can do anything she wants

**mudkip1**: who decided this was good lorde should be ashamed 

**Mysario**: just like the movie, the majority of the soundtrack is enjoyable when going through it but overall forgettable. It makes a decent Lorde EP though

**ExtraEater**: really existent soundtrack

**kappyko**:  expected this to suck but honestly some slays

**luigi\_is\_better**: this album was somewhat difficult for me to rate because there's a lot of my favorite artists here but the songs are very forgettable and don't really connect to the movie like the other two albums do. also the second part of the album drags so much

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): A stunner of a track, and it’s definitely going to do well. Lana really was perfect for this film, and it makes you wonder what an Gatsby album curated by her would have been like. The lush orchestration, the lovesick ache in the lyrics — so beautiful.

**strawberryswing1** (10): Even people like me who are skeptical towards Lana can agree that this is a stunner of a track. This held steady at #1 through the whole rate. 

---
##Beautiful Little Fool

**1998tweety** (11): Wow. This song along with Dark Paradise are what first really got me into Lana. I fell in love with her voice and lyrics. My interpretation of this song might be wrong but I always thought that Lana (who I guess represents Daisy) always knew her partner would never leave her. Instead its more directed at herself, she's wondering if she'll leave him (Jay) when hes no longer young and beautiful (and rich).

**didney-worl** (11): STILL WAITING FOR THAT OSCAR PLS

**gannade** (11): The song itself is beautiful, but this is the only song in the entire rate (and in most soundtracks) to completely encapsulate the tone & setting of a film in a digestible 4 minutes.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): This song is so gorgeous and one of Lana’s best. I prefer the YouTube (orchestra music) video version though which sounds a bit different and more grand imo. I originally had on my phone and not the album version so I was super confused when I listened to the album version.

**jamesfog** (11): A timeless classic.

**mother\_rucker** (11): Lana Bond theme when???

**notdallin** (11): every single gd moment of this song is completely, utterly, and quintessentially Lana Del Rey. The reasons people cite in this song to criticize it have only become iconic in the 5 years since this song has dropped; yes even that “oh that face makes me wanna party” line. Perfectly walking the tightrope of Lana’s signature trip hop and cinematic baroque instrumentation, this song feels timeless and yet eternally relevant—because who doesn’t relate to the fear of growing old and alone? At least I can take solace in the fact that my 11 will go to this song which will never have to worry about not being young and beautiful

**perfumevee** (11): Still get goosebumps 5 years later.

**Shippy** (11): queen struck again

**SinfulAnarchy** (11): I can't not give my 11 to my mother.

**skargardin** (11): It’s time for miss Lana to win a rate and this song absolutely deserves it.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): all that face... makes me wanna potty...

**CarlieScion** (10): AAAAAAAAAAA

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): I predict this will win, and it deserves it. Such a beautiful song, well-written, well-performed, well-produced... damn this is a good song!

**enecks** (10): And here lies the one song I unironically love in this. Prior to her sudden uptick in quality around the Lust For Life era, this was her best song. Why? It's the song to back up the decadent tragedy and melodrama of Lana's lyrics with lushly orchestral production. It's moving, powerful, and intense.

**luigi\_is\_better** (10): so i have to say that if it wasn't for the way that i give my 11s, this song would 100% get it. this is literally one of my 100 favorite songs of all time and probably my second favorite song from lana, an artist that for better or for worse has been a part of my life since 2013. i dont have anything bad to say about this and if it wins im totally happy about it. also when can we rate once upon a dream

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Lana is truly the queen of the sad gays

**radiofan15** (10): What else can be said about this song, Lana's biggest hit and more recognizable song as a solo performer (no, that remix is not her song) and one of the biggest Oscar snubs in DECADES, that most people haven't said before? It's use in the movie is pure magic and Lana's smoky/romantic delivery alongside that classy baroque pop background is nothing but beautiful. It might be a cliched answer but this is definitely in my top 5 of Lana's songs/

**selegend** (10): What a masterpiece. One of the best soundtrack songs of the decade honestly

**tapdancingpig** (10): Honestly, this is one of the most beautiful, accessible Lana songs.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): easily top 5 Lana songs. an iconic masterpiece. a worthy winner.

**turtle-thief** (10): Magnificent

**vodkainsipido** (10): a classic

**ZankeeZero** (10): okay, this is iconic and honestly probably the only thing i can see myself giving a 10 to on this soundtrack so far.

**kappyko** (9.5): wbk

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): I confess… I discovered Lana through this movie and song. Does that make me basic? Still, I remember I was obsessed with this song and its aesthetic

**Banananaise** (9): i thought this was like a huge hit... but it only reached #22 in the US? fucking West Coast charted higher

**mudkip1** (9): i overplayed this but it's still good

**PuggleMaster** (9): beautiful

**raicicle** (9): the orchestral version is better but i willl give it a 9 for the orchestral version

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Lana Del Rey and The Great Gatsby were literally born to be together, and this doesn’t disappoint.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): one of lana's best. this song is arguably more iconic than the movie it comes from

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): An above average Lana song

**followingfreeways** (8): im not a lana fan, but this song is sadly beautiful and i dont mind it at all

**Roxieloxie** (8): this song has horny chaotic cryptic vibes and im not sure how i feel about that

**twat\_brained** (7): Lana sounds great on this, and the way I was listening to this outside with the wind blistering around me as tree branches were stripped of their leaves against a cloudy autumn afternoon just seemed so picturesque. It just feels so dreary though, and I don't entirely buy into the lyrics. I already don't love Lana like I used to, and "the way you'd play with me like a child" is very creepy given her aesthetic. I'm glad she released Ultraviolence the year after to redeem herself.

##Any Other Kind of Girl

**Leixander** (6): Never understood why this got popular when all the other songs in this soundtrack are better! Lana has way better songs that are less boring and I am saying this as a huge fan of Honeymoon.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): Kind of a standard sleepy Lana ballad. The orchestration is pretty, but these kinds of Lana songs I always kind of tune out after the 2-3 minute mark. I'll take it over the terrible EDM songs any day though.

**robbiec\_** (4): I will never understand how this is a fan favourite I hate this song because it just sounds like the idea of a Lana song and it lacks any edge whatsoever, it’s boring and meaningless but... get that soundtrack money gyal

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): i’m sure this song is put at the most dramatic moment of the movie with this fake deep shit

**poppinmmolly** (3): no

**Overall average**: 6.975

**gowestyoungkanye**: I was so excited for this movie even though it got cancelled and rescheduled like 695388 times and that’s a bad sign. While I definitely think it’s my least favourite of the albums in this rate, it still has some very high highs and not many lows. Jay Z didn’t make a very cohesive record, but it is really interesting, and gave us some timeless classics (okay, it gave us Young and Beautiful and not much else, but still).

**TragicKingdom1**: Honestly this album was quite boring and disappointing. There were some good songs but I do not get the sense there was a lot of creative energy put into it like the other two. I think the atmosphere of the film had a lot of potential that was wasted here outside of a few songs. Far from the worst listen ever, but still a skip under virtually any circumstance; I can't think of any particular music fan it appeals to as a complete work. [Grade: B-]

**radiofan15**: I don't really dislike Baz Luhrmann's modernized classic take on the book as much purists, I though he brought something that made the nearly 100-years-old book interesting to "watch" (not just read) and his music choices had a lot to do with it. Kudos to Jay-Z (BUT FUCK YOU NOTHENLESS) for this great selection of performers and songs that fit Mr. Luhrmann in spite of some misses (IMHO) here and there... also FUCK YOU FOR TAKING WATCH THE THRONE OUT OF SPOTIFY YOU SELFISH C*NT YOU DESERVED MORE THAN SOLAGNE GAVE YOU (Score 7.86 OUT OF 10)

**enecks**: This album is like 40% amazingly powerful music that lives up to the legacy of one of the great American classics, and 60% unlistenable electro swing EDM abominations. So basically like the movie it was based on in quality then.

**SendMeYourSATScores**: i’ve never seems the movie. but i read the book in 7th grade and it was cool

**Banananaise**: i think i have too much nostalgia to really impartially judge some of these songs

**letsallpoo**: the fact that jay-z made sure a lot of this album was only available for streaming on tidal yet left all of these youtube videos alone kinda sends me

**mudkip1**: somehow this sounds even more dated than the era this movie is set in

**Mysario**: if you were to only show me the soundtrack and had me guess the movie, it'd be some cyberpunk '20s mafia film - and since I haven't seen this version of The Great Gatsby, that's what I'm going with

**ExtraEater**: really hilarious soundtrack. it's like listening to katy perry's discography while reading the agony and the ecstasy.

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: do I get gold for listening to this album on YouTube instead of Apple Music because it’s unavailable there?

**kappyko**: this lowkey sucks but its the soundtrack im most familiary with so i like it a lot more than i should

**ZankeeZero**: overall... it was gross outside of a few highlights, the worst parts of the album are REALLY bad though, so it doesn't really help it.

deleted: I'd also like to announce the contest winner at this time -- actually, we have a tie! With eight points each, /u/THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD and /u/salinedijon, for your tiebreaker (don't worry, the person who 'loses' will still get a prize! I just don't have the time to write three essays, haha, I have one to write for university too! Unless you want to read about the Bosnian genocide?), whoever can get closest to the actual place wins!

Your question: After Strawberry (the first person to do the rate) sent her scores, what place was Young and Beautiful in?
