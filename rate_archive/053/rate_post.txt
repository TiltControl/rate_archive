Curated Soundtracks Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/9kljm0/curated_soundtracks_rate/

u/letsallpoo believed in the [green light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMK_npDG12Q), the orgiastic rate winner that day by day recedes before us. It eluded us in the 2017 rate, but that‚Äôs no matter‚Äîthis month we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther if you send in your fucking scores‚Ä¶. And one fine evening (afternoon for the Americans, this is a multinational rate !)‚Äî So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past where Lorde has only won one rate. 

‚Äî

Greetings loved ones, let‚Äôs take a journey. 

We‚Äôre your hosts, üá¨0Ô∏è‚É£‚¨ÖÔ∏èüë∂üèº[KIMOJI is available now on the App Store or Google Play!] and üçìüèåüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, with special assistance from [:minnie:](https://www.reddit.com/user/strawberryswing1/comments/7r6ih1/minnie_my_baby_3/) and a guest appearance or two by [Crunchie](https://images2.imgbox.com/8f/71/7VD1TsD2_o.jpg).

(Special note: u/gowestyoungkanye and u/kanyewestrep2 are not the same person. Thank you.) 

Competing with the first 50 rate winners rate is a tall order (r/hailthepopheadscorporate, love a bit of cross promotion), but trust us, your fave has a song in this rate and you‚Äôre going to want to give it an 11. And, for the first and possibly last time ever in a popheads rate, you get to give your opinions on le ƒçi√±√©m√§. If you‚Äôve watched the relevant films. We‚Äôre not going to make you watch the films. Watch the films, though.

This is the curated soundtracks rate, so you need to know what a curated soundtrack is first. Curated by prominent artists to promote a film and featuring tracks from multiple artists (often collaborating) narratively tied to that film, only some (though there are exceptions, Gatsby being one) of the songs on a curated soundtrack appear in the film itself, making them different from movie soundtracks. This month we‚Äôre rating three such projects (and their respective films): Jay Z‚Äôs curated soundtrack for Baz Luhrmann‚Äôs *The Great Gatsby* (2013); Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs curated soundtrack for Ryan Coogler‚Äôs *Black Panther* (2018) and Lorde‚Äôs curated soundtrack for Francis Lawrence‚Äôs *The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ‚Äî Part 1* (2014).

### THE GREAT GATSBY

Somewhat controversially, director Baz Luhrmann called upon hip hop artist Jay Z to executive produce Gatsby‚Äôs soundtrack, rather than using the tried and true ‚Äòjazz music for a Jazz Age story‚Äô, explaining that jazz was to the Twenties as hip hop is to the modern era. Ironically, despite Jay Z‚Äôs heavy involvement and the controversy of using hip hop alongside the whitest actors you can think of, the album is best known for Lana del Rey‚Äôs ‚ÄòYoung and Beautiful‚Äô, which was released as a single to promote the film (where it features prominently and appropriately ‚Äî in a love scene) and the soundtrack. 

The Great Gatsby follows old money and the strife of the Roaring Twenties in the US, but like, metaphorically, claiming a love story lies somewhere in the centre of it all (what can F Scott say? #loveislit). Bachelor and enigma Jay Gatsby throws lavish parties on Long Island; old sport Nick Carraway, a writer, totally in love with Gatsby (a hearty fuck you to my American Lit teacher Mr S) the cousin of the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, is pulled into his orbit, with deadly consequences. Jay Z‚Äôs soundtrack is woven throughout the film, often featuring at pivotal moments, as part of Luhrmann‚Äôs vision of it as its own character. 

Featuring frequent collaborator-pairs like Fergie and will.i.am as well as Jay and Beyonc√© (covering Amy Winehouse‚Äôs rate winner Back To Black with the legendary Andre 3000), there‚Äôs also sub faves like Florence+the Machine and Sia (and as aforementioned, Lana). There‚Äôs something for just about everyone on this soundtrack, from rocker Jack White to one hit wonder Gotye to UK hit Emeli Sand√© to one of Kanye West‚Äôs best songs and where Frank Ocean‚Äôs success arguably began. 

**Note: due to the existence of Tidal, some of these tracks are not possible to find on Spotify, so we‚Äôve linked them on YouTube instead. These songs are bolded.** We know this is annoying, but please don‚Äôt skip them or we can‚Äôt accept your scores. Listen. Do it. Do it for Jay‚Äôs ‚ÄòJay Gatsby I park things‚Äô line.

### THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY ‚Äî PART 1

At the time of Mockingjay Part 1‚Äôs release, Lorde was revered as a youthful prodigy. This album came out a mere ten days after her eighteenth birthday and on the heels of a successful US tour backed by her massive debut album, Pure Heroine, and ten week number one in the US in Royals. She wasn‚Äôt a controversial choice; a few films earlier, her friend Taylor Swift (teaming up with the Civil Wars) was part of the soundtrack for The Hunger Games, releasing the gorgeous and haunting Safe and Sound. (We could make a rate on the Hunger Games soundtracks alone ‚Äî who‚Äôs up for a sequel with Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey?)

On this soundtrack, Lorde flexes her Hollywood sized budget (nabbing Grace Jones and Kanye production, among others) and plays close to her personal tastes while also supporting the narrative presented in the film ‚Äî the first part of Panem‚Äôs chaotic end, chronicling a number of deaths and catastrophes for Jennifer Lawrence‚Äôs Katniss Everdeen as a war rages in her dystopian society. Lead single Yellow Flicker Beat is minimalistic and menacing, a suitable theme for the franchise‚Äôs heroine. 

Even more sub faves crop up on this soundtrack ‚Äî Lorde, as the curator, takes the lead on four songs, most interestingly paired with Pusha T, Q-Tip and HAIM over a Stromae (yes, like the rate winner) beat. Ariana Grande and Charli XCX pair up with Major Lazer and Simon Le Bon (of Duran Duran), respectively. Tinashe and Tove Lo make their solo appearances. Kanye reworks lead single Yellow Flicker Beat into Flicker. And legends like Grace Jones and the Chemical Brothers (working alongside R&B crooner Miguel) pop up too, with relative unknowns XOV and Raury coming into the mix as well. And last but not least (don‚Äôt yell at us for leaving out CHVRCHES and Bat for Lashes, we‚Äôve mentioned them now) is Jennifer Lawrence, singing a revised version of the novel‚Äôs gruesome lullaby-cum-call to arms. 

Tracklist:  
1. [Meltdown - Stromae, Lorde, Pusha T, Q-Tip, HAIM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhO0zQhqoOw)  
2. [Dead Air - CHVRCHES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWhEUR0I9fo)

### BLACK PANTHER

In case you forgot, Kendrick Lamar has a Pulitzer. Highly accomplished and perhaps best known for his magnum opus on being black in America, To Pimp A Butterfly, it was no surprise when he was announced as the curator of the album created to promote Black Panther, the first Marvel blockbuster (Kendrick got that Disney money!) with almost entirely black cast (Everett Ross / Martin Freeman.... could have been left out). Drawing black talent from across North America and Africa, Kendrick curates an album heavily influenced by hip hop sound and traditional African music that parallels the film‚Äôs primary soundtrack by Ludwig G√∂ransson.

Throughout the album, Kendrick and his collaborators frequently reference Black Panther‚Äôs main conflict, between ‚Äòvillain‚Äô Killmonger (was Killmonger the true villain of Black Panther? do you want Michael B Jordan or Chadwick Boseman to raw you? weigh in in this rate!) and King and Avenger T‚ÄôChalla, battling to control the fate of the African kingdom of Wakanda, untouched by colonialism, and with it, the fate of the world, particularly that of the global African diaspora caused by the slave trade. The film poses a number of existential questions, and the soundtrack Kendrick creates does the same, while also going all in on producing bangers.

The Black Panther soundtrack is an exhibition of musical Black Excellence featuring many of Kendrick‚Äôs TDE labelmates, including ScHoolboy Q, Jay Rock, and SZA, South African rappers Yugen Blakrok and Sjava (delivering his verse in Zulu), their countrywoman Babes Wodumo, a Gqom singer, perennial young hitmakers Khalid and Swae Lee of Rae Sremmurd, the incomparable Vince Staples, featured-on-everything Future and chart topper the Weeknd, and the only non black person on the album, the soulful favourite of artists like Beyonc√© and Frank Ocean, James Blake. 

Note: for congruence (so each of the soundtracks has 15 tracks each) we‚Äôre including BagBak from Vince Staples‚Äô album Big Fish Theory (previously rated by this sub in the 2017 Hip Hop Rate, with BagBak claiming a top ten spot ‚Äî will it repeat?) as it was featured in the trailers for the film.

##THE RULES (LISTEN UP, SLUTS)

This is like a plane safety briefing. We don‚Äôt care how many times you‚Äôve heard it before, you better read it. And if this is your first rate, welcome, thanks for flying with us! Don‚Äôt be an idiot like Gowest, who didn‚Äôt use the goddamn prefilled link to send her scores to poor u/berober04 during her first rate. Use the prefilled link! Please!!!

Here are the rate rules:

- Listen to every song and assign it a value from 1 (bad) to 10 (good). Decimals are fine, but only to one decimal place. (6.9 not 6.96)

- You may give ONE zero and ONE eleven, these should be reserved for the worst and best song in the rate, respectively.

- DON'T SABOTAGE. The hosts are free to reject your scores or ask you to change them if they feel they could be sabotage.

- USE THE PREPARED LINK TO SEND SCORES. Please just enter in your scores, don't copy and paste, it usually messes up the program. 

**THIS IS THE CORRECT FORMAT TO SUBMIT:**

> Bang Bang: 10 Outsold Jessie J!

Strawberry, the rate master who wrote up this section for you, is not gonna post incorrect formats. Literally don't submit any other way or she'll shame you for being illiterate. 

**You can also comments on the albums and films as a whole by adding a colon after the title**

> Album: The Great Gatsby: Why does Jay-Z hate us put it on Spotify already. Also, Nick was in love with Gatsby, r/changemymind.

If you have any issues, feel free to contact u/gowestyoungkanye or u/strawberryswing1. Gowest can be summoned by you saying literally anything about One Direction in this sub, Strawberry comes on command if you type :minnie: three times in a row. Just kidding. DM us. We‚Äôre nice, we don‚Äôt bite and we‚Äôd be glad to help you. We want your scores.
