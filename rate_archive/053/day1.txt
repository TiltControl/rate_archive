Curated Soundtracks Rate: Day One — Hi Sabrina Carpenter
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/9vnhx9/curated_soundtracks_rate_day_one_hi_sabrina/

Before we begin, a quick Q&A session:   
Q: Is this the Sabrina Carpenter AMA?    
A: No.

So what is this, then? Popheads, welcome to the greatest show on earth, the reveal of the Curated Soundtracks Rate. There will be cannons announcing the death of each ~~Hunger Games participant~~ song that goes out. There will be Kendrick Lamar getting yet another shot at a prize that's worth infinitely more than an AOTY Grammy, the coveted 'double rate winner'. And also something about Jay Z and Gatsby. Uh. Champagne sea. Feelin' so Gatsby for all of last month. Please help me.

***

I'm GoWest, one of your hosts, here with Crunchie the Killing Machine (he can be rented!). The incomparable and magnificent /u/StrawberrySwing1 is going to be following along with me on the plug, assisted by our beloved :minnie:. We have ~~shit~~posts and fun galore in store for you tonight, so please settle in and watch the bloodbath! If you want to send a silver parachute to your fave at any time, please get in touch with their mentor.

Today we will be revealing songs 45 through 31 here and on the Plug. Tomorrow we will be doing the same thing but with songs from 30-16 and also it will be at 1PM EST / 7PM GMT. 

We will be holding a contest with the exceptional prize of me writing an assay / shitpost on the topic of your choice free of charge. Or I'll make you some graphics for your playlists. We're not mods and we are poor. Please do our contest. More information will be pinned below.

**GWYK** (4.7): Will is very polarising. And this track is polarising. The lyrics are beyond cheese (the sneaky bitch ad lib, lorde have mercy) and the production is a mishmash of modern and 1920s, like some whack kind of electro swing. I still enjoy it, to a degree, but I can see why people don’t.

**Strawberryswing1** (9): https://imgur.com/a/OTrraoq

---

##The few, the proud, the brave

**mother\_rucker** (10): I love will.i.am and his production style, I will NOT apologize.

**radiofan15** (10): This is me, giving a near-top score to a will.i.am song... me, who wrote over 5,000 words about how his music in this particular era leaved too much to be desired... but I have such a weak spot for this song, the stupid-ass namedrop of Tom & Jerry and Scooby Doo. It's either because of how the song switches so abruptly from modern EDM to throwback-style doo wop or the fact that the female singer is basically Britney in the Britney Jean era but there's something that keeps me hooked to this song since 2013 and I can't believe the world let Scream & Shout and This Is Love to top worldwide charts while Bang Bag rotted as a late single in the bottom of the charts. Also sorry u/sapphire1921 but it outsold Jessie J.

**Roxieloxie** (10): On the low this song is corny as hell, but tbh I love it so much.

**CarlieScion** (9): sneaky bitch

**turtle-thief** (9): I unexpectedly loved this too much. It's cheesy, fun and doesn't take itself seriously. The production might be a bit dated and at points too much but it's just a jolly ol' time and I love it.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8.5): will i am really knows how to make trashy bops, huh

**1998tweety** (8.3): Honestly this is kind of iconic.

**Mysario** (8): I love scat

**robbiec\_** (8): this score is too high but omg this was such a bop

**poppinmmolly** (7): Jessie, Nicki and Ari outpeaked

##Literally everyone else

**notdallin** (6.6): See now this is a fair example of the 1920’s hop music and 2010’s EDM coming together in a way that I appreciate. They never quite mesh but they dance in parallel next to each other, complementing in a strange way that I cannot quite fully articulate

**Banananaise** (6.5): i just remember someone on tumblr being REALLY mad about the plagiarism controversy around this song (sneaky bitch)

**Raykel** (6.5): This is horribly good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I’m not gonna lie, I have the vinyl to this soundtrack and this song is really stupid but for whatever reason it bangs so hard. will.i.am’s lyrics are tragic as always, but the instrumental is some of the more tolerable electroswing I’ve heard.

**enecks** (5): Uh this is hilarious. WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU DROPPING REFERENCES TO SCOOBY DOO IN THE GREAT GATSBY. THIS ALBUM IS A FUCKING MESS.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): This song is very will.i.am and that’s all I have to say.

**Leixander** (5): the chorus BOPS but william's verses ruins it

**ZankeeZero** (5): is that britney

**rotating3Dtext** (4.5): what? no.

**ExtraEater** (4): oh dear

**twat\_brained** (4): Poopity scoop. Woop di scoop di poop. Britney is that you? Never mind, it's someone named Shelby Spalione. God, I got scared he tainted her music again. This I can admittedly do without

**didney-worl** (3.5): Cher/Nancy/anyone who's ever done this song I'm so sorry

**mudkip1** (3): wait a minute lemme take you there

**PuggleMaster** (3): This is TERRIBLE oml

**skargardin** (3): Thanks but no thanks

**tapdancingpig** (3): Ok, the jazz sample is fun and I like the female vocalist, but... will, you gotta clean up your act! Like, I know how you think none of us care about lyrics, but that isn’t an invitation to make gibberish and pass it off as lyrics. And the melody does not stick in the brain at all.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (3): will.i.am and putting minimal effort into things; name a more iconic duo.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2.5): this sounds like a doofenschmirtz song but electrotrash

**kappyko** (2): I think he misconstrued what "scatting" is it doesn't mean you have to sound like you're taking a shit jfc

**Shippy** (2): this was trash

**gannade** (1): Will i am is awful

**selegend** (1): Is that Britney? This song is terrible lol

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (1): An awful mix of jazz and EDM that doesn't work at all. This is will.i.am at his absolute worst, with terrible lyrics, an obnoxious beat, terrible singing, and holy fuck that scat part at the end. I have a soft spot for some Black Eyed Peas songs and occasionally will.i.am can be so bad that he's good but this is just awful.

**hikkaru** (0): Ariana/Jessie/Nicki outbopped and I don't even like that song at all... will.i.am's production is just so messy and not in a good way at all. Not to mention the "vocals", oof.

**jamesfog** (0): Cacophony. How did this go #3 in UK? Also, who is this Britney Spears impersonator?

**static\_int\_husp** (0): Yup, that sure is a Will.i.am song

**TragicKingdom1** (0): this kinda reminds me of Back In Time by Pitbull and that is a much better song which is saying something  *[Editor’s note: How dare]*

**vodkainsipido** (0): **i wish the worst of life to him**

**zekkyzach** (0): wtf

**gowestyoungkanye** (9.4): XOV goes with Raury in the who? category, but like Lost Souls, I love this song and having heard more XOV songs now can count myself as a fan. This track is supremely underrated and a better take on the Maroon 5 song of the same name :maren:

**strawberryswing1** (7.5): I don’t know, this song is interesting to me. I like the vibe of it. I don’t think it’s a masterpiece but there are plenty of songs in this rate that deserve to be second to last a lot more. 

---

##Minnie

**gannade** (10): i loved this song for some reason even tho its objectively just kinda meh. Its nice background music

**followingfreeways** (9): did Peeta and Katniss have like… rough sex in this movie or something?? I dont remember but it sounds like it ! nice

**rotating3Dtext** (9): It’s kinda simple but I dig it

##Crunchie

**1998tweety** (7.4): This feels like a grower.

**Roxieloxie** (7.3): It needs something else in this to really get it more hype, it's just kinda there

**turtle-thief** (7): It's not as bad as I remembered it.

**radiofan15** (6.9): This is the first track in the album, and I hope it's the last, in which I can't forgive the disconnect with the movie because the song itself it's not good enough. It's not bad at all, but I would have never listened to it in another circumstances and might have even skipped if it, let's say, appeared in a Spotify Radio station.

**enecks** (6): naninaina

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This is just filler on a soundtrack somehow

##That Rat Camila

**ignitethephoenix** (5): Generic and just not that impressive in anyway way. It’s not bad though, just not great.

**Shippy** (5): kesha is not at all threatened

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): This sounds like a watered down X Ambassadors, which really isn't a compliment. Super generic.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): this sounds like some nightmarish mashup of The Weeknd and Imagine Dragons and that one female singer who had that one hit song but whose name I can't remember to save my life but the hook was all glitchy and bad. anyway, not good.

**Leixander** (3): painfully below mediocre

**robbiec\_** (2): no lol

**notdallin** (1.6): you know when you have a fun riff but can’t really make whole song with it? it’s like they built an entire song around that echo-y “animal” part at the end of the chorus but they needed those generic animal lyrics like YESTERDAY. and that is how this song was birthed

**kappyko** (0): i hate this omfg the payola JUMPED OUT lets not act like lorde actually knew who this was and just let him shit this out on her curated soundtrack skfajfjsdadfak

**twat\_brained** (0): I don't really care if there's a song that's worse than this, whoever is the singer absolutely cannot fucking sing and listening to this makes me just want to skip to the next one, no other song on this album has made me want to do that yet. I still love Lorde with my heart, she is my fucking world, but her selections for this album are just not it, sadly.

**gowestyoungkanye** (5): So throughout the whole of this rate I somehow thought James Blake was on this, which is... it definitely says something about this song, that’s for certain. Your interpretation of what, exactly, that is is up to you.

**Strawberryswing1** (5): I love Zacari’s voice but let’s be real it’s just an interlude there’s not much to say and it deserved a low placement. Can we talk about how 4 people are credited as writers even though there’s only like 12 words. 

---

##Strawberry knowing James Blake is not on this song

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (9): this is lovely

**gannade** (9): pretty

**Roxieloxie** (8): it exist

**notdallin** (7.6): Zacari is the new Bieb. change my mind

**turtle-thief** (7): it deserves credit for introducing the best song in this album.

**twat\_brained** (6.3): This is a nothing song. Doesn't sound particularly bad, just doesn't do much of anything

**1998tweety** (6): This is not needed.

**CarlieScion** (6): cute

**enecks** (6): ?

**Leixander** (6): okay

**raicicle** (6): is this majestic casual

**skargardin** (6): It’s alright

**tapdancingpig** (6): Perfectly fine, but it’s an interlude.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): this isn't bad enough to be the first song out but it's gonna be the first song out

##GoWest thinking James Blake was on this song the entire rate

**robbiec\_** (5): okay

**static\_int\_husp** (5): yep that's an interlude

**kappyko** (4.5): its an interldue aight

**ignitethephoenix** (4): it’s an interlude

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (4): goodbye

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): This is kinda a non song from Zacari, and it’s too repetitive for being less than a minute and a half

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3.5): interludes r gay lol

**radiofan15** (2): Let's average... If the interlude was just Zacari on the piano it would have been an 9, however it's also somethingwhatever the fuck is at the end which scores a 1 for me... this gaves us a total of 10 and an average of 5 with gets one point deductd for the abrupt switch, another point deducted for ending so abruptly and ONE LAST MINUS POINT for interrupting my listening experience.

**gowestyoungkanye** (7): I have a feeling this one will be controversial as the original is absolutely untouchable. The auto tune on 3 Stacks is certainly a choice, but I love the almost industrial spin on this cover — this album is not cohesive at all but at least Jay and Bey’s tracks match.

**strawberryswing1** (8): If you’re just comparing this to the original version, this song is like a 3. But I love Bey’s sultry vocals on this and while the production is quite dated I enjoy it nonetheless.

---

## Black Don’t Crack
**radiofan15** (10): I love Amy Winehouse, she's one of my all-time faves so i'm very defensive of her being covered, especially if the basic of her songs are subsistuted in such a blatant way. The first time i listened to this cover, I was really unsure of Andre's delivery and how would the rest of the song fare out but then the XX-esque guitars kicked in and Beyoncé came through and saved the whole ordeal and made verything better and gave me a bigger appeciation for 3K's half-rapped/half/singed verse and the gender-swapped lyrics... after all these years this is still my favorite cover of an Amy song and FUCK JAY-Z FOR KEEPING IT OUT OF SPOTIFY YOU GREEDY BITCH

**luigi\_is\_better** (9.5): didn't even needed to listen to this song (yeah, i wasn't aware of it before the rate) to give this a 10. i love me some bey but 3 stacks is def the highlight of it, he just sounds so good. i think this song will get a big controversy score but i know im in the good site of herstory

**perfumevee** (9): I remember liking this better but I think I was just remembering the Beyoncé parts.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): this is very... sultry

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): in love with how great of a job they both did to stay true to the original, while bringing their own personalities in it

**Roxieloxie** (8.6): Beyoncè's voice in this feels so hypnotic I love it so much.

**jamesfog** (8.5): Beyonce snapped. Amy outsang tho

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): needs more emotion tho

**twat\_brained** (7.6): nothing will stand up to the original, A RATE WINNER NO LESS, but I give credit where credit's sur, if nothing else but for the innovation on this

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): It's an okay cover. Bey is much better than Three Stacks here tho.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): This is smooth and cool and both their voices fit well into the cover, but could they not get some more interesting production to back it up? This sounds like 2 GarageBand loops fighting with each other.

**CarlieScion** (7): **why does beyonce have a lisp in this**

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): It’s not the original but honestly it’s way better than I would imagine it would be. I love the pulsating instrumental, and it’s a weird collab but it works well.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): not feeling this production.......had the potential to be much better

**ZankeeZero** (7): Bey absolutely killed this, but I think it felt really dry either way. The song's just not the same without Amy's personality.

**1998tweety** (6.8): An interesting take from the original but I don't really see myself ever choosing this one over the original.

##Obvious joke about how Amy Winehouse didn’t die for this but since she’s actually dead and I miss her I’m not gonna make that joke

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (6): This could've been so much better than it actually is. Beyonce and Andre 3000 covering a heartbreaking classic? Why isn't it better than this?

**kappyko** (6): amy winehouses father is a lying scumbag he said he initially did not hear andres part when he judged the cover but hes literally the first fucking singer. its not bad honestly but andre prolly shouldve touched another song on the record instead of this.

**Leixander** (6): disjointed but a guilty pleasure in a way, remove andre from this thanks

**turtle-thief** (6): Once again the minimalist production takes the cake here, beyonce tries to save it at the end but it's just "meh" all around. I might add it to a sexy playlist tho, it has that streeptease feel to it.

**Raykel** (5.5): They made this sound like a creep was singing it

**notdallin** (5.4): DAE feel like Jay got a little carried away with how much they could re-interpret these songs for this movie? It’s like they got to this point where they had all these OTT hip hop songs and when the director found out, it was too late to do anything about it

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (5): delete this

**didney-worl** (4): Amy I'm so sorry (Bey sounds very good tho)

**gannade** (4): amy… sweetie… im so sorry

**hikkaru** (4): I kinda like the wubbing sound throughout but as a cover of Amy Winehouse's masterpiece of a song this ain't it...

**Mysario** (4): hate is a strong word but I really really really don't like this soulless cover

**letsallpoo** (3): amy winehouse's dad disapproving of this cover is one of the few things he's done that i agree with

**robbiec\_** (2): ???

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): this is actually really bad wow

**enecks** (1): AMY SWEETIE I AM SO SORRY. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS LOW TIER EDM.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): This cover is just a mess. I apologize for this Amy.

**tapdancingpig** (0): I hate this cover so much. The original is one of my favorite songs of all time, and this just misses the mark completely. Credit where credit is due: I kinda like Beyoncé’s vocals. I don’t think that anyone will dispute that she’s a better technical singer than Amy, and she plays around with the song much more effectively than Andre (who I will get to. Will I ever get to him). HOWEVER, she’s playing the song as if it’s sexy, which fits the beat, but not the lyrics. As for the beat... dear god. The beat kind of makes the depression of the writer seem hot. That’s not cool. Also, the bridge of “black” was my favorite part of the song, and they took it out. Now onto Andre 3000. [cracks knuckles] Andre getting a verse to himself is dumb, and his gender swapped lyrics are why I drink. And his back phrasing (messing with the rhythm, essentially) is fucking awful! In conclusion, Amy deserves better.

**gowestyoungkanye** (7.2): Bryan Ferry is interesting. He appears on this soundtrack multiple times. I’m not sure I like his voice, but I do love the instrumentation. I find it so funny Baz Lurhmann said he wanted a hip hop album because hip hop is modern jazz but basically just gave us a jazz album.

**strawberryswing1** (5.5): This song makes me wanna dress up as a flapper and dance with a man who smells like cigars in a jazz club.

---
##Nick Carraway

**Mysario** (9): put a horn emoji here [Editor’s note: 📯📯📯]

**Roxieloxie** (9): I really like the orchestra in this one, the vocal are a little too quiet though

**notdallin** (8.4): Man I wish more of the songs on the soundtrack were more like this. I appreciate how unique the soundtrack is and that it’s essentially a snapshot of 2013 but it’s songs like this that really transport me to that era.

**tapdancingpig** (8): Pretty fun, also actually pretty era appropriate for once.

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is cute filler.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): idk what this is but they kinda went off

**followingfreeways** (7): why am i not in a bar w flappers right now?????

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Kesha is SHAKING

**turtle-thief** (7): It's a cute song, the last chorus with the choir is the best part.

**Banananaise** (6.5): this is nice

##Daisy Buchanan

**radiofan15** (6.4): It is ok to say that Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac outsold in the soundtrack of Sucker Punch? I mean, the song is a classic and the arrangment works fine with the period but I would never listen to this version voluntarily again.

**CarlieScion** (6): this fits in the movie but not on the soundtrack lmao

**enecks** (6): This is one of the songs in the album I have nothing much to say about. It fits.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): i want Leonardo to DiCaprio my vagina

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): kesha outsold

**twat\_brained** (5.7): I'm sorry, who is Bryan Ferry? Should I know him? And if love is the drug then this song is my Xanax.

**jamesfog** (5.5): Your Love Is My Drug outsold

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (5): I'm sure this is technically a good song, it's just totally not my style at all

**Leixander** (5): zzz

**ZankeeZero** (5): i'm just appreciating this soundtrack's ability to go from very gross electropop to even grosser old school ballads. this is not allowed

**robbiec\_** (4): I barely remember watching this move and I barely remember this song

**kappyko** (3.5): smoky and sexy, very fitting for the atmosphere. but he also praised nazi imagery so can we really stan him

**PuggleMaster** (3): I didn't think jazz could be so boring

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): this soundtrack is making me start to not want to watch the movie

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): Raury.... is..... Well. Anyway. Moving on. Despite the unexpected nature of his appearance on this soundtrack back in 2014, this has been one of my favourites for quite some time now. There’s a smokiness and urgency to this track that’s really, really pleasing to listen to.

**strawberryswing1** (7.5): oooooOOOOOOooooaaaadrumdrumdrumstrumstrumstrumcommmmmeeeeeeonnNNNNNNNNNNNLASSSHsouth

---

##Raury????

**Shippy** (10): this seems like it really fits the movies mood, stan

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i get a lot of atmosphere out of this one and i love the production. gonna get robbed tho

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): This is a really cool song that’s probably going to get robbed.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Raury never really broke through as an artist, but he did have some real talent that shows on this song. I love the spacey, soulful feel of this track, that acoustic guitar really gives the song some real grit that works well.

**CarlieScion** (8): pretty

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Raury's "All We Need" album is lowkey one of my favorites of the decade but I don't think he's put out another project since :/

**robbiec\_** (7.4): this is really quite interesting for a soundtrack song this was enjoyable

**1998tweety** (7.3): This song is okay, I'm not a huge fan of what he does with his voice at parts.

**radiofan15** (6.1): THIS is the kind of song I might have expected in any of the other soundtracks of the Hunger Games. Although it's a better fit than other songs in the album, it's really forgettable, I have not that much to say.

##Raury is an industry plant

**jamesfog** (6): ummm...

**ZankeeZero** (6): zzzz

**enecks** (5): ZZZZ

**notdallin** (5): there’s some really cool minimalistic percussion going on here but those vocals are really bad

**Roxieloxie** (5): this sounds like an acoustic 21p song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Raury is hit or miss and this is a definite miss.

**kappyko** (4): i like his voice on noname's mixtape wait is that him singing too?? very cinematic so thats cool but its not very interesting. the most exciting part was realizing yellow flicker beat was next

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (4): literally what happened

**Raykel** (4): The rapper has the same flow as someone reading slam poetry lol. Come oooooooooooooon let this be over.

**twat\_brained** (4): Who is this Raury fellow and where did Lorde find him? I just finished listening to this and I was falling asleep but I just unclenched my teeth after I bit the side of my tongue. Yeah, anyway, the soundtrack doesn't need this.

**gowestyoungkanye** (8): Lorde really dragged the legend Grace Jones out of retirement for the third Hunger Games movie. And we are all the better for it.

**strawberryswing1** (3): I would have given this my 0 but I don’t like giving 0s in rates I host and I also felt it would be disrespectful to the living legend……...but this ain’t it sis.

---

##Order of Jamaica

**kappyko** (10): literally end my life you goddess omg slay

**Leixander** (10): screams in gay

**mudkip1** (10): legend

**radiofan15** (10): The ska-esque guitar and the caotic beat really sold me this track even before listening to the lyrics... what does it mean or what doesn it have to do with the movie? I'm not sure but THIS IS DEFINITELY in my TOP 5 in the rate, IT'S THAT GOOD HOLY SHIT... why I have never listened to Grace Jones before? I though she was like a white R&B british singer with that name, I need to catch up with her ASAP.

**robbiec\_** (10): this could have also been on Black Panther but omg this is so out of place but in a welcome way

**Roxieloxie** (10): This belongs in Black panther in the part where Killmonger and T'Challa have that first fight scene.

**ZankeeZero** (10): what a QUEEN

**CarlieScion** (9): yesss

**vodkainsipido** (9): the first song I really did love in this

**twat\_brained** (8.4): This sounds like it should be on the Black Panther soundtrack instead of this one, especially considering BP makes a reference to her early on in the film. Also fun fact lol my uncle briefly had a fling with her believe it or not. If nothing else it feels like a good pick me up given the last few songs but it's rather confusing to me.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): this makes me want to shake my ass

**notdallin** (8): IT’S LIKE LASER TAG!… IN THE JUNGLE!!…?

**raicicle** (8): legends stay winning

**tapdancingpig** (8): This may be the most bizarre song in the rate. I wouldn’t be shocked if this went out first. But let’s admire the 70 year old Grace Jones trying her hand at the modern trop bop. Admittedly, I’m being way too nice to this song, but it had a LOT of entertainment value for me.

**turtle-thief** (8): Sonically, this is one of the most interesting. Lorde has taste.

**Raykel** (7.8): Go ahead legend

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): i don’t see this fitting in a movie but it’s cool

**enecks** (7): drum my prostate incineroar

**selegend** (7): ICON!

##Order of the British Empire

**1998tweety** (6): I think something different can be cool but this goes on for way too long.

**Banananaise** (6): i like grace jones but i don't really like most of her music that much! i just hate reggae tbh

**jamesfog** (6): ok... werk

**ignitethephoenix** (5): The distorted drums is unique and cool, but the song as a whole is not my cup of tea and kind of a mess.

**Mysario** (5): cool but unenjoyable to listen to, much like a coworkers story about their weekend

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): This is like a David Byrne track but you got rid of all the good parts

**TragicKingdom1** (4): sorry not my kinda thing

**tedyonce** (11): IDK how far this song will get but its fucking incredible

**CarlieScion** (10): euphoric

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): Probably my favorite song on this soundtrack

**ForretressArtillery** (10): If not for Gotye this would be my 11

**tapdancingpig** (10): Well that was hot

**1998tweety** (9.5): Wow this is so atmospheric, I love it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I fully expect this to be the first song out but I used to love dubstep and especially Nero, and they occupy an orchestral electronic niche that I really could never see replicated by anyone else. This track maybe isn’t fitting for The Great Gatsby but it’s really great.

**luigi\_is\_better** (8.5): a very movie song but im just a sucker for these types of songs so

**Roxieloxie** (8.2): I love how this track builds up very cinematic.

**gowestyoungkanye** (5.4): I don’t know why but Son Lux covers never sound right which is funny because Son Lux original songs don’t sound right either?

**strawberryswing1** (6): I can’t take this song seriously because their voice reminds me so much of those merpeople in the Harry Potter movies.

---

##Prison Break

**radiofan15** (9.5): Covering Son Lux is always a risky proposition because they have such a defined sound that it's unmistikable regardless of who sings it, and also the fact that this is a shortened version of the 5-minutes-long tracks gives me a lot of preconceived notions even before listening it. I love the original track, so I'm gonna approach the cover as most separate of the original track as possible... two and a half minutes later... I can't, this sounds A LOT like the original, there's nothing original or different here that gives me something to hold on to.... so, instead of rating the cover, i'll rate the original with the idea that if Lorde wanted their friend's song on the soundtrack she could always have asked them for a rerecording or remix.

**hikkaru** (8.5): I love the wubs omg

**notdallin** (7.8): I know this is a cover but I haven’t heard the original. Bat For Lashes executes this song so well, perfect atmosphere for the Hunger Games. The production really paints the picture so well.

**1998tweety** (7.7): Fits the theme well.

**twat\_brained** (7.7): Idk I'm just not really feeling this; I thought a soundtrack for this film would echo the film's plot in a sense. Most of it just seems rather lowkey, which surprises me. Did Lorde even read the Hunger Games trilogy or see the first two films?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This definitely sounds like a hunger games song.

**CarlieScion** (7): this is okay

**Roxieloxie** (6.8): feels more like an interlude than an actual song tbh

**Gowestyoungkanye** (5.7): I was looking forward to this one cause I actually love Khalid and Swae Lee, but it was a bit of a letdown. Everything blends together.

**strawberryswing1** (8.5): I don’t love Khalid but his and Swae’s just glide across this smooth track.

---

##Young

**Roxieloxie** (10): this would be an 11 if it was just khalid on here. I love this song so much but swae lee's part just throws me off to much

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): Swae Lee is a main pop girl and I'll fight anyone who disagrees. thank u, next.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This song has such a chill vibe which I love. Idk what this has to do with the movie though.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Definitely the best Khalid song I've ever heard. The funky BADBADNOTGOOD production suits his voice way better than the typical stuff he sings over, and Khalid proves that he has pretty solid chemistry with Swae Lee. Everyone involved with this song brings out the best in each other, and it comes together in a smooth R&B bop.

**luigi\_is\_better** (8.5): all three of them sound so smooth here and the way that kendrick says "im only one n****" makes me so wet. wanted to see more of swae though

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): pleasant

**1998tweety** (8.2): Khalid is overhated, he makes chill bops.

**enecks** (8): This track is smooth as hell, and I like in context that its about admiring powerful women.

**kappyko** (8): omg maybe they made some points

**turtle-thief** (8): Nice vibes.

**PuggleMaster** (7.5): I actually like Khalid on this. Swae could've stayed home

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): this is cute and inoffensive but it will go out day 1 because the khalid hatejerk is unfairly strong on this subreddit :pensive:

**ZankeeZero** (7.5): this is rly cute

**notdallin** (7.4): Those little Earthbound bleeps and bloops in the chorus really endear this song to me

##Dumb, Broke

**twat\_brained** (7.3): I like Khalid but I wish someone would wake him up half the time. At least he doesn't need AutoTune like Swae does.

**Banananaise** (7): when do we get the squirrel girl movie

**robbiec\_** (6.7): I think this is a lovely collab but it’s sort of eh in comparison to the rest of the soundtrack

**tapdancingpig** (6.7): Perfectly pleasant background music, but it’s nothing I would listen to a thousand times.

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Khalid and Swae Lee are both artists that I think are ... maybe ok. This song does nothing to change that thought.

**CarlieScion** (6): :help:

**followingfreeways** (6): this is a nice tune but it’s too repetitive for me honestly

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I don’t have much to say about this average collaboration but the percussion is LITERALLY so similar to the last song and it really bothers me.

**Raykel** (5.5): Khalid always sings like he has his eyes almost closed and he has to lean his head back in order to look at you

**radiofan15** (4.2): In theory Khalid and Swae Lee should have provided with the catchiest poppy rap track this side of Post Malone but what'sthe point on creating a love song with a tropical vibe for a movie about African superheroes? Also this ends too abruptly, there's no payoff of any kind, ugh.

**Leixander** (4): swae lee, no

**Shippy** (3.8): i like swae lees voice, i continue to hate khalid and his lazy ass singing

**gowestyoungkanye** (9.5): Yes lawd! I love how distinctly Anderson .Paak this is even on Kendrick’s soundtrack. The instrumentation (what is that in the background?) is so good. I also have to note that this is the song James Blake is actually on, and what the fuck.

**strawberryswing1** (7): Good not great

---

##James Blake is Good

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): a post election mood

**kappyko** (9): why does everybody hate this

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): This is a really interesting mix of artists, and it results in a one of a kind song. The production is summery and warm but also has kind of a chilly, darker undertone. Anderson .Paak is great as always, James Blake fits surprisingly well on here with a heavenly outro, and Ab-Soul drops some of his better verses. This definitely feels like a soundtrack cut with a mix of talent coming together to make a dope track.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): i really like that background melody

**robbiec\_** (8.5): LAWD

**notdallin** (8.4): yeah yeah yeah the song is good but can we level and talk about how tf James Blake is on this record?? James Blake in the class picture be like **https://imgur.com/a/Ybncl9B**

**CarlieScion** (8): :despair:

**enecks** (8): Not the best beat of the album, but pretty lyrically solid

**luigi\_is\_better** (8): finally some rep for white people ✊

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): why won't James Blake just adopt me :(

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I swear James Blake just pops up on songs all the time, does he even have his own music lol


##James Blake is white

**1998tweety** (7.3): Boring and very long.

**tapdancingpig** (7.2): I really like the beat, but this needs a real chorus.

**mudkip1** (7): okay but why is it literally this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVma3RT4wqs

**twat\_brained** (6.5): Pretty clever bars here, especially the "patois" line, I find. Well, at least with Anderson's verse. Ab-Soul kinda drops the ball a bit, though. At least James comes through with some pretty smooth, sultry vocals. Also clever use of those African drums to lead into the next song.

**Raykel** (6): Was expecting more from this collab. The hook sucked but ooooo that last part was great.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This collab should theoretically be a trio of god-tier contributions, but in reality it’s really nothing that special on this album, sadly enough. There’s too much Ab-Soul and not nearly enough James Blake.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): kinda dull

**radiofan15** (4.4): I don't understand what the instrumental is trying to do but it's annoying me... and the verses doesn't help at all. Also, it's quite funny how James Blake of all people is the only white artist in the whole album

**gannade** (3): really not a fan of this. Maybe its just my gay ass not being able to handle this many men on a track

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): Had Jack White ever not gone all the way off? I love how raw this track is. Rock was an interesting choice by Jay Z.

**strawberryswing1** (5.5): I hate his voice here and it’s just too loud.

---
##Cute Ass Seeing Eye Dogs

**CarlieScion** (10): AAAAAAAAAAA

**mother\_rucker** (10): This song is very straight white male, but I love it.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): I love Jack White's voice, and it's so perfect for this song and style that I forget sometimes it's a cover at all. Every time he explodes into that chorus, I get sent into orbit. It's bluesy, angsty, and easily one of the highlights of this soundtrack album.

**turtle-thief** (9): This is an experience, i don't know what to do with myself.

**1998tweety** (8): Not my kind of thing but I can appreciate it.

**Banananaise** (7.5): there was this rock cover of Happy Together floating around tumblr back in the day which everyone thought would be on the Great Gatsby Soundtrack and then it wasn't. anyway it was better than this but this is still good

**jamesfog** (7.5): Surprisingly good. The Don't Hurt Yourself and Seven Nation Army songstress snapped here

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Okay, but I kept hearing “love is blondness” and now I’m laughing.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): relax

**Mysario** (7): overrated musician doing a cover from an overrated band

**Roxieloxie** (7): yeehaw but emo

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This U2 cover is pretty solid. I can’t figure out which one I like better but the explosive nature of this makes it a pretty good Jack White song.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): wow this is awfully mastered

##Dilated Eyes

**radiofan15** (5.7): Jack White covering U2... 2013 Pitchfork was already calling it song of the decade before it even came out. In all seriousness I never though this particular version worked outside of the dramatism of the trailer in which appeared, it just sounds like it was made under the "this is for the dramatic moment in you movie Mr. Luhrmann, I don't care which one"... also it sounds so sonically out of place in the whole album.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): i don’t think there’s been a good song yet

**ZankeeZero** (5): dad rock

**robbiec\_** (4): no dad

**enecks** (3): This is a mess. Jack White and U2 mix as well as my life and happiness.

**TragicKingdom1** (3): honestly this is kinda just lurchy and annoying and the guitar work combined with jack's vocals just really makes me wanna turn it off lol

**twat\_brained** (3): if I wanted to hear Jack I'd probably just put on some White Stripes, this doesn't fit well within the soundtracks context

**kappyko** (2.5): i like the white stripes but this is just a scary old man screaming at me to eat my oatmeal as i beg for him to stop. maybe meg white was necessary!

**luigi\_is\_better** (2): i legit dont understand how people can suffer through jack white's voice sorry (im giving this score because the song is just very forgivable and doesn't add anything to me)

**PuggleMaster** (2): Not my genre of music at all

**gowestyoungkanye** (9.3): A very chill little track that begins in Zulu that’s easy to pass by, I find Seasons to be an underrated gem. The story midway through the track — the way it’s rapped / sung is gorgeous (‘white skin you’ll be out before Christmas’). I’m also obsessed with narratives and I think this song is tied to Killmonger’s journey in the film.

**strawberryswing1** (5): This sounds like a bunch of different songs mashed together.

---

##Winter

**Roxieloxie** (10): really powerful narrative in this one

**enecks** (9): I like the incorporation of Zulu verses

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (8): This song took me a few listens, but it really grew on me. very intense, cathartic tune

**tapdancingpig** (8): I think like this one more than some of the other tracks because the lyrics connect with me more for some reason and the production is stellar.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): this takes a while to get going but when it gets going... fire

**robbiec\_** (7.8): my favourite thing about this blockbuster soundtrack is that there is still room for more obscure artists like Yugen Blakrok but especially this song and it doesn’t dim in shine

**jamesfog** (7.5): Good chill track, really like the strings

**1998tweety** (7.4): Wow the chorus is so annoying. The beat is nice tho. The last verse kind of redeemed this.

##Summer

**twat\_brained** (7.3): And now we're back to the tracks starting to blend together.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I like how they tried something different, but it’s kind of forgettable to me.

**kappyko** (6): cute slow jam

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This song isn’t really my thing at all, it’s a smooth and traditional rap track, but it never really feels anything but a pale imitation of its contemporaries.

**radiofan15** (5.9): OK, the Zulu was cute but I was so bored with this track that I started to question Kendrick's status as a Grammy and Pulitzer winner.

**notdallin** (5.6): iss… iss… issa lil slow for a song that relies on a lot of lyrics that I don’t have any hope of understanding…

**strawberryswing1** (8): I am white and I have economic anxiety

**kanyewestrep3** (10): hov is literally perfect for this track. super sharp lyrically, wonderful synergy with the beat. great song.

**gannade** (9): They shouldve used lanas unreleased song hundred dollar bill

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): this is an excellent opener thanks dad jay

**ZankeeZero** (8.5): this is really good tbh

**1998tweety** (8.1): The spoken bits from the movie bring this down.

**Roxieloxie** (8): a solid intro the album.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): “who wanna be my 100th problem”

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): 2013 had Jay Z priming himself for a comeback. Open Letter was insane, and then this was fire, but then he gave us the mediocre Magna Carta Holy Grail. Oh well, this is one of my favorite random Jay Z loosies, it’s pretty catchy and has bars.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): good start

##British bank notes aren’t vegan :(

**CarlieScion** (7): i found the interpolation of the gatsby lines very annoying

**rotating3Dtext** (7): it exists

**TragicKingdom1** (7): not bad but like please you can do so much better

**enecks** (6): I like this beat. But this is hilarious lol. It's so bluntly for The Great Gatsby as a soundtrack. Hashtag rap that only sticks to the topic of the album through the first verse and random samples of dialogue in the film

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): This sounds like a cut Magna Carta Holy Grail song, and that's not really a compliment. It shares a lot of that album's empty "I'm a rich guy" lyrics but with a weird, choppy flow and a beat that's unique but isn't really interesting enough to carry the song.

**turtle-thief** (6): I feel like I could warm up to it but for now its production alone carries the song.

**radiofan15** (5.5): I'm not a big fan of feeling poor by just listening to a song so i'm not a big fan of this song... also, the dialogue samples are weird and took me out of the song... also also I can't remember when this was used in the movie... also also also the line "That cheese made us constipated couldn't tell us shit; took that, Taylor Swift to a hundred fucking million, bitch" was a choice... also also also also FUCK YOU JAY-Z FOR KEEPING YOUR GOOD MUSIC IN TIDAL YOU GREEDY C*NT

**Raykel** (5.5): Never been a Jay fan :/ and I don't appreciate the random dialogue in the middle of this song

**static\_int\_husp** (5): Jay-Z was ok, but the intro / interlude with lines from the film interspersed was not well done at all

**twat\_brained** (5): I mean the flow is decent but I'm not here for the T-Swift potshot, especially when one of her best friends is in the rate.

**notdallin** (4.7): it’s a little too on the nose when you sample the movie you’re literally doing the song for, no?

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): I really thought it was gonna build up to something but it didn't, either way It's a calm bop

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Coco O has a really soulful, great voice, and it mixes really well with the bouncy production. That throwback piano sample is an actually good execution of the modern/retro blend, which is a bonus.

**1998tweety** (8.2): Also kind of filler but nice.

**ZankeeZero** (8): this is probably the most fun song on this soundtrack and i'm glad it exists! the piano loop is really catchy and it shines way brighter than the outdated dancepop tunes.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): Okay, largely mood music but I'm kinda feeling it? What a pleasant surprise. IDK this Coco O girl but I like what she's working with!

**jamesfog** (7.5): Interesting

**notdallin** (7.1): “Just because I am more single than anyone” same

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This is a forgotten song on this soundtrack but that beat goes off

##-40C Windchill

**radiofan15** (6.5): I never heard if her before and honestly I don't remember this song at all (in the soundtrack or the movie) but it kinda irritate me how the drums kept me waiting for a full blown breakbeat ending that never happened and how overall they sound like they don't belong in the song at all.

**gannade** (6): starts off promising before going nowhere

**luigi\_is\_better** (5.5): cute but not something that i would listen spontaneously

**enecks** (4): Christ, this album isn't even good electro swing most of the time.

**robbiec\_** (4): O

**turtle-thief** (4): Beautiful voice, filler track.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): this was boring but it’s a movie so ok

ignitethephoenix: Didn’t realize I missed this, but nothing of substance was lost thankfully. Also Beyoncé’s vocals were good on Back to Black but that arrangement is such a mess and a let down when you have Beyoncé. So I had to give it a 0
