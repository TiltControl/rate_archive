Curated Soundtracks Rate: Day Two — Bye Sabrina Carpenter
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/9vw53e/curated_soundtracks_rate_day_two_bye_sabrina/

First off, sorry to everyone who thought we were Sabrina Carpenter's AMA. We were not. Yall probably aren't here anymore though. 

Welcome to the second day of the Curated Soundtracks Rate reveal! This is the electric bugaloo one. I don't have anything else funny to say today (do I ever, though?). Let's do this.

***

Same as yesterday, we'll be revealing 15 songs (today, songs 30-16). This is Day Two, so these were the songs you thought were kinda not bad but kind not good. Tomorrow we will be doing the same thing one last time but we will crown your winner and it will begin at 2PM EST / 7PM GMT.

As was the case yesterday we are still holding a contest with the exceptional prize of me writing an assay / shitpost on the topic of your choice free of charge. Or I'll make you some graphics for your playlists. We're not mods and we are poor. Please do our contest. More information will be pinned below.

Please join Strawberry in the Plug! https://plug.dj/popheads

**gowestoungkanye** (8): Putting a cover of your own iconic collab song with your future wife (also on your soundtrack) on your curated soundtrack is such a power move, tbh.

**strawberryswing1** (7): This is by far my least favorite version of this iconic song and tbh I should have given it a lower score. I suppose I like how the Jazz feeling to it fits the movie well, but I doubt I’ll ever revisit this. 

---

##In a Polyamorous relationship

**enecks** (10): This was either getting a 10 or a 0. This album is such a clusterfuck it makes my soul scream. But my soul's screaming makes my mind laugh. A laugh of bitter defeat.

**Leixander** (10): this could have kazoos and airhorns in it and it would still be a 10

**perfumevee** (9.5): Love this jazzy version!

**1998tweety** (9.2): Wow, ironic how Bey covering someone doesn't work too well, but someone covering her sounds great. This version is the in between of the original and the 50 Shades version; it's pretty cool that there's so many ways of remaking the same song.

**didney-worl** (9): honestly Emeli did such a great job I can't even be mad

**static\_int\_husp** (9): A very good cover. Love the jazz instrumental

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): boppy

**twat\_brained** (8.6): The benefit to this cover is that I can decipher what the lyrics are, I couldn't do that on the original. Also this more or less feels like an instrumental of the Star Wars Cantina band lmao

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): i love emeli's vocal delivery on this. the instrumental reminds me of the star wars cantina theme tho

**CarlieScion** (8): the OG version is better

**jamesfog** (8): Cute, Emeli did good. Original and Fifty Shades version are better tho.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): i want an actual koala to cover this song

**Mysario** (8): an inoffensive cover

**Roxieloxie** (8): not as hype as the og but it gives me marching band vibes and as a former band kid i love that

**tapdancingpig** (8): Such a fun arrangement of the song, and Emeli Sandé sells it.

**notdallin** (7.7): does anyone else think this song sound like one of those youtube cover bands that covers pop songs in the style of vintage-sockhop-50s/60s-jazz-crooner-chillhop-beats-to-study-to?

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): I really like how the first verse feels like a modern song done in that throwback swing style, but then as the song went on there were some more trap synth fuzz and drums and it kinda killed it a little bit. I love Emeli Sandé's voice on this though, it fits the mood perfectly.

**ZankeeZero** (7.5): this is really fun! while i can't say it saves the soundtrack, it's still good and i'm glad it got in.

**radiofan15** (7.2): Ok, fine, Emeli snapped. She's obviously not Beyoncé but she sounds period-appropiate and the arrangement is cute but nothing particulary earthshattering... but, just like the Love Is A Drug cover I would never listened to it on my own will.

**Banananaise** (7): who the fuck is beyoncey, i stan the anglo-zambian queen of soul ADELE EMILY "EMELI" SANDÉ (MBE)

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (7): real Scott Bradlee Postmodern Jukebox hours

##Single

**skargardin** (7): This would be so much better if the tempo was a bit slower

**gannade** (6.5): why did jay z allow her wifes most iconic song be butchered like this. Emile sande has as much personality as a white person

**kappyko** (6.5): extra .5 for the awesome outro

**followingfreeways** (6): how many versions of this song do we need? jk but actually, i loved this song until emeli sande came in. she has a beautiful voice but i preferred just the horns really. with her singing it felt too rushed (even tho i know it was the same tempo the whole time)

**Shippy** (6): i am sensing some beyonce love in this soundtrack, popheads aint gonna like this

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I’m not really big on this version but I will admit the chorus is jangly in a good way.

**selegend** (5): The arrangement doesn’t really work for this song tbh

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): i think this could’ve been better. poor execution

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): why would you do this to that song :(

**turtle-thief** (5): MAAAAAAN i expected so much more by the premise of this song and the amazing vocalist behind it. Really wanted an all out high energy anthem like "Electric Lady" but it just felt monotone and it seemed like Emeli wasn't having fun with it.

**letsallpoo** (3): https://i.imgur.com/sZapCzo.gifv

**luigi\_is\_better** (3): is this how people that hate the BbB cover feel like

**robbiec\_** (3): ???

**Raykel** (1): bitch whAT THE FUCKK [Editor’s note: mood]

**gowestyoungkanye** (8): DOO DOO DOO DOO WAKANDA DOO DOO DOO WELCOME (this song wouldn’t be out of place on Astroworld)

**strawberryswing1** (5.5): While I enjoy the flute, Kendrick and Travis are too of my favorite rappers and they can do so much better than this. 

---

##Vegetarians 

**CarlieScion** (10): AAAAAAAAA

**enecks** (10): I AM A SLUT FOR FLUTES IN RAP SONGS. I know this is crap, but IDGADFFAFA.

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): f l u t e

**notdallin** (9): YOOOO WHO GOT THE TABS FOR THIS PAN FLUTE BEAT?? I WANNA TRY AND PLAY IT ON THE OCARINA OF TIME B*TCH

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This beat is everything, and Kendrick not only nails the chorus, but gives a pretty memorable verse. Travis Scott does his thing, and it’s impossible to dislike how he works the monster of a beat. I played this one a lot earlier this year.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): This is almost a weird, alternate universe version of New Freezer, but it's a lot of fun on its own. Kendrick's hook rides the line of being too silly, but it's too catchy to not love. While I don't think its the best Travis/Kendrick collab, it's a good poppy track.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): EMOTIONAL

**1998tweety** (8.4): Kendrick has a lot of good songs, but one thing that really annoys me is when he talks in a distorted voice. I get that its kind of his thing at this point, but its the equivalent of Britney singing in her baby voice.

**Roxieloxie** (8): #WakandaFlex

**TragicKingdom1** (8): i like flutes in rap songs

**gannade** (7.5): the flute is pretty cute

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): travis and kenny gotta do better than this but still kinda bangs

##People Who Eat Children

**ZankeeZero** (7.5): the lizzo cover outsold

**twat\_brained** (7.2): Pretty decent production, but I'm not getting the hype for this album, sorry not sorry.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): For a song with Kendrick and Travis, this song is disappointing and could have had more potential.

**mudkip1** (7): lizzo snapped!!!! flute queen

**raicicle** (7): this is fine but lizzo’s flute version makes it a 10

**tapdancingpig** (6.5): I think I finally understand the annoyance with triplet flow now. The song is fine other than that note, but it doesn’t really stick with me.

**kappyko** (6): lizzo did it better. this doesnt really feel like it fits on the album is that just me? lmfao. its kinda underdeveloped

**turtle-thief** (6): I don't know which one came first but it reminds me a lot to Cupcakke's Navel.

**robbiec\_** (5): this isn’t a bad song but it’s so forgettable

**PuggleMaster** (3): Queen lizzo outsold this mess QUEEN

**vodkainsipido** (3): recycling verses is not smart kendrick

**radiofan15** (1): Definitely a downgrade from Goosebumps and just killing time for the big finale... also, minus 4 points for not even trying to shoehorn a reference to the movie like the other songs.

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): You know what? I talked so much shit about Jennifer Lawrence back in the day, but she really deserves more credit for not thinking that the remix of this song becoming a radio hit meant she should have a music career. Thank fucking god. The 9 is a 9 because I will never understand ‘necklace of hope’ over ‘necklace of rope’. Let anti war kids movies reference suicide and show the consequences of fascism challenge!

**strawberryswing1** (10): This is probably one of the weirdest hits ever, so I guess it makes sense that it’s one of the most controversial songs in this rate. It’s kind of funny we make fun of Selena’s whispering when this song exists. Nonetheless, I weirdly love it. The chorus at the end really makes this a 10. 

---

##Oscar Winner Jennifer Lawrence

**radiofan15** (10): Who knew that our Academy Award winning problematic fave could sing? Of course she's not coming for Whitney/Celine's throne anytime soon but she still does a good job with this emotional song risen by James Newton Howard's powerful work in the background orchestra and The Lumineers' gorgeous melody. Although it works better in the context of the film, The Hanging Tree is still a great battlecry outside of the movie and the fact that it turned Mr. Howard into a main pop girl for a while makes the score of 10 really deserving. Also never listen to the remix, it's crap.

**Raykel** (10): What is it about this song that is so unconventional but yet so accessible it almost made top 10 on billboard??? JLaw can really put the pop girls to shame.

**Shippy** (10): i wish it was less produced and more just raw vocal with no background instrumental but the song haunted me when i read the book and i think jennifer delivers it well and i love

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): main pop girl james newton howard snapped

**turtle-thief** (10): Jennifer Lawrence, the pop girl prophecy is full-filled. Very cinematic and catchy. I also really love a good chant.

**Mysario** (9.5): one of those songs where vocals isn't really the main lead of the song but rather the melody that brings the strings and other accompanying instruments to a more powerful level

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): this song weird as shit but it does something for me

**CarlieScion** (9): i wish this song was entirely acapella, not with a swelling orchestra in the background

**gannade** (9): lowkey jennifer has a better song than about 95% of songs in this rate and shes basically singing one note over and over

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): have to turn up my volume to 90% for Jennifer to be barely audible, but I really appreciate her effort here. i love the acapella choir towards the end, though.

**mudkip1** (9): lol this used to be played on the radio all the time it was so weird but i love it

**rotating3Dtext** (9): yeah, this was well made. I will now refrain from “new main pop girl” jokes cause I don’t really like j law

**1998tweety** (8.5): I like this song but I have the weirdest reason for not loving it. When I first read the book before the film came out I sang the song in a different way, so when the song came out it sounded super weird to me and prevented me from getting super attached to it.

**twat\_brained** (8.4): Okay but why does Jen sound eerily like Lana here? An interesting fact worth pointing out: when the lyrics are introduced in the novel, Katniss says her father showed her the song, but her mother didn't like it, I guess because she found it to be distressing.

**followingfreeways** (8): im not a fan of Jennifer Lawrence but I think she a simple and pretty voice and this song is pleasant to listen to. Also the music in the last half of this song sounds like something that would play in Skyrim or Oblivion and Im really feeling it

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Does this make Jennifer Lawrence a pop girl?

**Leixander** (8): kinda strange that this became a hit, the last minute of this is stunning though

**robbiec\_** (8): weird flex but okay y’know

**Roxieloxie** (8): this song is an experience especially with good headphones

**Banananaise** (7.5): jennifer's voice weirdly reminds me of lana del rey

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): This song. This FUCKING song. It is such an enigma to me. It went to #12 on the hot 100. It broke the top 10 on Top 40 Pop Radio. It's a morbid little movie song and somehow it was everywhere for the span of a few weeks. And I will never be able to understand why.

##Jennifer Lawrence has only won one Oscar

**notdallin** (6.8): I’m sorry but wHAT kind of parent would sing such a literally EFFED up lullaby lyrics to their CHILD. No wonder Katniss was messed up! but yeah the strings are nice

**hikkaru** (6.5): JLaw queen of vocals

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): the most bizarre hit of the decade, like it's literally film music and just the same verse repeated over and over dsfgefabhwadgf

**raicicle** (6): what is this and why

**tapdancingpig** (6): I’m kind of pissed this was as successful as it was, but it was a really good moment in the film, and one of my top ten favorite moments in the book series. The lyrics serve a great purpose within the story, and the melody is effective enough. Jennifer Lawrence isn’t a good singer, but I wouldn’t be happy if Katniss was any kind of good singer. I just wish that it wasn’t embraced to be anything more than it was in the movie.

**mother\_rucker** (5): It works fine as a normal song, but remember that weird club remix version? omg mess

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): This song is a perfect metaphor for Mockingjay Part 1: too long, too uneventful, and didn’t deserve to do as well as it did.

**luigi\_is\_better** (4): well, it's jennifer lawrence kinda singing. this is what you need to know.

**selegend** (3): In the context of the film, it’s not terrible. As this is, it’s terrible. Also I fucking hated hearing this on the radio. Even worse than hearing the suicide hotline song on the radio. Also fun fact: Jennifer Lawrence has more chart success than Tinashe.

**vodkainsipido** (2): LMAO WHAT IS THIS

**kappyko** (1): im deleting half of my scrobbles from this album thx jennifer,,, so damn extra

**enecks** (0): Jennifer is the worst vocalist in this rate. And this should not have been a hit. Garbage.

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): Fergie went off. The irony of this track can’t be ignored either. It’s so flippant (my favourite word as longtime readers of my comments will know!). I also think it pulls off the electro swing Bang Bang doesn’t. Love the chorus. Okay, that’s all I (we) got.

**strawberryswing1** (9.5): I have such a soft spot for the 2011-2012 era like drops like this one. I miss when music was light hearted and fun to dance to in the car. No there’s nothing super meaningful about this...it’s literally a song for parties, about parties. Context matters and I stand by my very high score thank you. Also Fergie please bless us with more music soon.

---
**kappyko** (11): Now this is how you do electro-swing fuck off punk this is the greatest song ever written

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (0): Trying to blend Gatsby-period music with modern sounds and production isn't a bad idea in concept, but holy shit is this the worst possible execution of it. None of this fits together, the dubstep production is incredibly dated, and both Fergie and Q-Tip sound really out of place on this terrible mess of a track.

---

##Gatsby? What Gatsby?

**radiofan15** (11): I know this is a VERY brave choice for my 11 but I don't care... this song was my immediate highlight from the soudntrack as soon as it came out and still is... I mean, it was my clock alarm for like 6 months, can you imagine that? Anyway, Fergie sounds lovely and in her range here (what happened at her National Anthemp performance? we will never know) and the rap by Q-Tip (his best in the whole rate; sorry but I don't make the rules) is quite trashy but the flow is just so catchy and goes along pretty well with GoonRock's electro house/swing/hiphop production that I can't believe Baz Luhrmann didn't created a full dance sequence to go along the song and instead let it rot in the backgroung mashuped with Bang Bang

**CarlieScion** (10): what a bop

**enecks** (10): This taps into that part of my brain that likes Party Rock Anthem and electro swing. That part of my brain is a dumbass, but it's still a part of my brain. I'll give it a 10.

**gannade** (10): major bop

**hikkaru** (10): The sax and the piano weaved in with the EDM is heavenly and the fact that this song serves LMFAO realness does not bother me one bit. Fergie also serves jazzy vocals that are leaving her performance of the USA anthem shaking in its boots.

**followingfreeways** (9): wtf this is an absolute bop...ive never seen the great gatsby fully but i can imagine myself just getting lit w all the rich ppl

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): Double Dutchess deserved better

**poppinmmolly** (9): a bop tbh

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This song is legitimately a megabop - it’s such a ridiculous concept that feels like Party Rock Anthem: 1920s Edition, but it’s definitely one of my favorite original songs off this soundtrack. The chorus is so good and Q-Tip is such a wild choice for a feature on this but it works so well. I’m sure this will go out early, but if you don’t recognize how hard that drop hits, I have nothing to say to you.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): bop

**1998tweety** (8.5): Fergie actually suits the style of music very well.

**Leixander** (8.5): goofy fergie at her finest

**notdallin** (8.2): it’s nice to know that the dubstep era at least went out in 2013 with a thunderous, messy, and magnificent bang

**jamesfog** (8): A Platinum certified hit

**tapdancingpig** (8): Ok, this jazz-EDM mashup is very 2013, but it’s a lot of fun.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): kind of a guilty pleasure bop, Q-Tip is definitely the highlight tho

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This songs is like 5 different songs in one, but I don’t completely hate it?

**Roxieloxie** (7.3): it's a dancy bop but it didn't need to be this long

**twat\_brained** (7.1): Wow maybe Fergie's credibility hasn't completely gone out the window. This beat's a bit much for me; it sounds like something a rent-a-DJ would put on at like 1:10 AM in a seedy nightclub

**Banananaise** (7): dear god what did we do wrong in the late 2000s-early 2010s to deserve the dubstep trend. i mean i like Katy B and NERO as much as the next person but why did this song need a dubstep breakdown??? why they do this???

**Shippy** (7): okay this was kinda boppie

**static\_int\_husp** (7): They do realize how the movie ends, right?

**didney-worl** (6.9): I forgot how messy this album was. Still love it.

##Gatsby’s dead, Fergie

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): omg is so bad… but i’m dancing

**skargardin** (6.5): Somehow it had completely escaped me that this song was from the Gatsby soundtrack. Still, I’ve never really enjoyed it that much. On top of that it’s just so utterly dated by this point.

**robbiec\_** (6): trash I... love

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (5): Expected to hate this, kinda didn't

**ZankeeZero** (4.5): you know, it's ironic that this is called "A Little Party Never Killed Nobody" because this somehow manages to sound like a literal seizure. which is not that hard to achieve, but this is a slap to the face of everyone who ever died to a seizure and i take offence in their name. i appreciate q-tip's azealia banks flow on this one cuz it kinda saved this from being a 2.

**luigi\_is\_better** (4): this is like every song from 2008 and fergie sounds like a random person

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): i personally blame this song for the death of electropop

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): 2013 was a mistake.

**PuggleMaster** (2): Oh Fergie what are you doing? I hate this soundtrack......

**vodkainsipido** (1): i was going to put the image of fergie pissing herself here but that would be nothing next to the career-killer double dutchess was

**gowestyoungkanye** (6): While Jay Z struggled with sonic cohesion (am I a Pitchfork writer now), Kendrick absolutely killed his soundtrack, balancing weaving the film narrative in with creating an African sound and using African artists. This intro, while ultimately forgettable among the soundtrack’s best songs, is a perfect introduction to Kendrick’s curation and the film itself.

**strawberryswing1** (7): this is a better intro than raindrops (an angel cried)

---

##Erik Killmonger

**Roxieloxie** (9.6): kendrick know how to give a good opener

**CarlieScion** (9): a Good intro

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): I can't believe this album came out this year. How long has 2018 been going on for? Anyway, banger.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): I love how weird of an opener this is. The dark piano loop so abruptly transitioning to the more experimental, abrasive parts is so cool.

**enecks** (8): This album's really interesting. It's basically Kendrick acting in the role of T'Challa (and later KillMonger), emphasising the parallels between his life experience and the character. Take this title track - echoing the accumulation of details in DNA to draw a connection between Kendrick and T'Challa as on top of the world. The beat's production is a little too unambitious to really take this all the way, but it's a potent track in context.

**followingfreeways** (8): kendrick SNAPPEd but im not a fan of the instrumental

**mudkip1** (8): king king king kingkingkingking

**robbiec\_** (8): this sounds like DNA-lite but wow banging open

**static\_int\_husp** (8): A really interesting intro, flows really well into All The Stars

**notdallin** (7.5): It’s like if Kanye produced a Kendrick song and I’M HERE FOR IT

**twat\_brained** (7.4): How does what Kendrick is saying relate to the movie? I guess the "I am T'Challa" line but other than that I don't really know.

**radiofan15** (7.1): The intro track brings the TPAB-Kendrick we fell in love with, but even if it works as an intro I wonder how it would have sounded as a full-on developed track instead of a an interlude.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): cool

**tapdancingpig** (7): I don’t get this. I’m pretty sure that this is secretly brilliant, and that the off beat rapping is symbolic and good for some reason, but I don’t get it. It’s begun to grow on me, though.

**turtle-thief** (7): I felt like I was baptized, this changed me. Still, it's not a track i would replay unless I was listening to the whole album.

**1998tweety** (6.8): I actually kind of like the lyrics but my biggest turn off from Kendrick's music is that I really don't like the beats he uses, the piano is nice though.


## Ulysses Klaue

**luigi\_is\_better** (6): the worst opening of the rate is from the best album from the rate lmao it feels like an interlude from to pimp a butterfly

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Ironically, the solo Kendrick Lamar track is probably the most forgotten rap track on the Black Panther soundtrack. It’s not anything bad but it’s not anything special for a Kendrick track? The whole thing is pretty dissonant but it feels more like a performance of Untitled Unmastered than an actually emotional song.

**kappyko** (5): nice!!!!

**PuggleMaster** (5): Kinda boring tbh

**gowestyoungkanye** (6.5): This was so hard for me to score. I think I re-rated it like 800 times. There’s nothing particularly wrong, per se, but something about it annoys me. And I’m not a Tinashe hater! I actually streamed Joyride, okay! (Stuck With Me is one of her best songs.) But I’m just not feeling this. Maybe because it’s one of the few ‘solo’ songs on this soundtrack it feels lacklustre and one note?

**strawberryswing1** (8): This song is a blatant attempt at Tinashe trying to make herself a gay icon. The gays use the phrase “I’m gonna LEAP” and so she named her song the leap. She remains as Tinasha to me. 

---

##Hop, Skip, Jump


**didney-worl** (10): Tinashe at her best tbh

**PuggleMaster** (10): NIGHTRIDE QUEEN

**robbiec\_** (9): MUTHA

**1998tweety** (8.9): This is very chill.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Absolutely hypnotic.

**CarlieScion** (8): cute

**followingfreeways** (8): this is really good but it also made me realize that for some unknown reason I have had Tinashe and cupcakkes appearances confused (they do not look or sound alike I am just stupid)

**letsallpoo** (8): a dancing with the stars legend

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): this is really good for a Tenisha song

**ZankeeZero** (8): remember the nashe description tinashe posted on her ig

##Falling 800 Feet to your Death

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I don’t feel much listening to this

**jamesfog** (7.5): She has better

**radiofan15** (7.5): Tinasha in a Hunger Games soundtrack is definitely a surprise, sure, but a welcome one. Of course this is Aquarius Tinasha and not Joyride Tinasha so it's all alright. Her smoky vocals and the stripped-down beat works as well as usual but the lyrics and their relation to the movie requires lots of mental gymnastics.

**Banananaise** (7): jesus christ tinashe pops up in the least expected places.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): i love you T, but this isn’t the tea

**turtle-thief** (7): Nashe did good.

**twat\_brained** (6.8): Every time I try to get into Tinashe I'm just reminded of how downplayed much of her music is, to my dismay, and this is no exception, sadly. It's good background music for sparking up with pals but in the context of Mockingjay and what it represents, I'm just not feeling it.

**notdallin** (6.4): it sucks that this song drags so much because Tinashe kills the chorus with somehow simultaneously sounding airy and smokey vocals.

**enecks** (6): OK

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I completely forgot this song existed

**kappyko** (5.5): leap!

**TragicKingdom1** (5): i don't know what the mood is supposed to be here but i dont like it

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): Ohhhh Gotye. This is way superior to his one hit. It’s an outright banger, even. YOUR HEART’S A MESS, YOU CAN’T ADMIT IT TO YOURSELF!

**strawberryswing1** (6.5): This sounds like background music at a coffee shop. Nice and relaxing but not memorable.  

---

##Admitting it to yourself

**enecks** (11): Gotye is actually an incredible artist, and to be honest he deserved more hits. But Australians already knew that, and you Yanks just had to give Chris Brown even more hits instead. It's appropriate this film is about a very American tragedy, because the American tragedy on the charts is ignoring talent.

**ForretressArtillery** (11): Please come back Gotye

**Banananaise** (10): a masterpiece! why was this on a soundtrack like 10 yrs after its release. when i heard it in the trailer i was so excited because i thought the US was about to be enlightened about early Gotye's genius and this song would be a big hit suddenly but that didn't happen

**didney-worl** (10): GREAT song

**ExtraEater** (10): goatye

**Leixander** (10): AND I'M DESPERATE TO... CONNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT

**notdallin** (10): the song that made me a Gotye stan was not his most popular song (2011’s rando left field hit “Somebody that I Used to know,” which is also one of my favourite songs), but it was this slow-burning, pain-churning, and emotionally labile pop oddity with spontaneous jazz and hip hop flares. That, along with the lyrics that somehow perfectly mirror the movie’s plot, made the song a perfect addition to the soundtrack even though many were scratching their heads at first. I mean come on, who doesn’t get chills when Gotye basically screams at the top of his lungs “I’m DESPERATE to CONNECT,” I dare you to show me such an emotionless carcass.

**radiofan15** (10): First and foremost a much deserved FUCK YOU TO GOTYE'S LABEL FOR TAKING OUT THE ALBUM WITH THIS SONG FROM MY LOCAL SPOTIFY, YOU CAN CHOKE IN A BAG OF DICKS. Anyway, it's a shame that STIUTK was Gotye's worldwide breakthrough because this song was always so much more interesting than his biggest hit, which is still awesome by the way. Also, seeing all of the people's reaction when this track appeared over the credits and most wondered when they have heard that voice before, that was priceless.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): Gotye fucking goes off in almost every song; one of the most underrated one-hit wonders ever.

**kappyko** (9): art/indie pop this pusy king

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Anyone who thinks Gotye has one good song needs to listen to his records - this song is amazing and the chorus is just as good as his signature song imo, although it takes a bit more time to get to.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): i hope gotye gets a random song in more rates

**1998tweety** (8.3): Bebe shook.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (8): I miss Gotye

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I’m just surprised that Gotye has a song for this soundtrack.

**Roxieloxie** (8): it's nice but it's too long

**twat\_brained** (7.6): This song is okay but time and time again like I've seen in this rate I fail to see the connection between this song and the film for which it's soundtracking. Jay should really just stick to what he does best; tacking himself onto Beyonce's features.

##CAN’T ADMIT IT TO YOURSELF

**perfumevee** (7.5): I like parts of it but it goes on a little long.

**jamesfog** (7): An interesting song, but STIUTK and Eyes Wide Open outsold. Thank you for giving Kimbra a career though king.

**Mysario** (7): I see why he only had one hit

**tapdancingpig** (7): Kind of fun and odd, but nothing exceptional.

**luigi\_is\_better** (6.5): im very confused about how to rate this song. it's nice but i feel like it should be 2 minutes long

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): *heart’s a mess

**Raykel** (6): I mean yeah it's pretty but I'm boredt [2]

**CarlieScion** (5): i dont know why but this song is so annoying to me

**Shippy** (2): nnnnn im not liking much from this soundtrack

**gannade** (0): this was so fucking long and it sounded the same for the entire 6 minutes. It was literally just elevator music. Did they play this song when Daisy went up on an elevator or something?

**enecks** (10): This is good! A song that fits well thematically, has real weight, and is movingly beautiful.

**kappyko** (10): omfg that was really good

**1998tweety** (9.3): I was already liking this song, but Sia brought it even higher at the very end.

**jamesfog** (9): Queen, y'all gotta put some respeck on her name.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I love the weird key of the song and how Sia sounds. It’s just so haunting.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): epic and cute

**skargardin** (8.5): Queen of soundtracks

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): This almost sounds like a lost Bond theme, it's very moody and builds to a big dramatic finish in a way that all the best Bond themes do. Makes me want her to do the next one ngl.

**Banananaise** (8): she sang!

**PuggleMaster** (8): Standard Sia soundtrack song

**notdallin** (7.9): PETITION FOR SIA FOR NEXT BOND THEME

**Roxieloxie** (7.9): I'm not really a fan of ballad but this ones pretty good

**hikkaru** (7): Sia and movie soundtrack ballads name a more iconic duo

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The first half of this isn’t that special, but once Sia hits the final chorus my wig sees the green light

**TragicKingdom1** (7): /u/THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD kill me and run me over

##Yeah you’re right :(

**radiofan15** (6.7): WOW, relistening to this I was reminded of an era in which Sia's soundtrack sounds didn't sounded like rejected demos from the same writing session... looking at you Salted Wound and Waving Goodbye and To Be Human and Magic and Deer in Headlights. There's a sense of a gorgeous melody in the chorus which I wouldn't have minded if Sia had explored more but oh well it's a nice track and I don't regret having listened to it but I almost forgot it as soon as it ended.

**Raykel** (6.5): I was expecting something more grand but they half assed this

**twat\_brained** (6.2): aw, how cute! A stripped down version of "Skyfall"! I'm hearing "keel" and run, as if one will keel over and another will just run away. It's a definite slow burner though, and doesn't do much for me

**CarlieScion** (6): this feels slightly out of place on the soundtrack (sonically)

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): Kill and Run sounds like the title you would get if you used a word generator to come up with a title for a Sia song and oh oops the whole song actually sounds like it was generated from a bot doing the best to be Sia

**ZankeeZero** (6): i mean ok lol can she chill

**Shippy** (5): i wish i knew what she was saying

**luigi\_is\_better** (4.5): honestly so surprised to see the soundtracks rate only having one sia song

**gannade** (4): sias voice is tolerable here but the song is kinda meh

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): When I was scrolling through HHH reading people’s reactions this one came up a lot. For good reason. It goes OFF. And ScHoolboy Q is underrated — ‘not even Kendrick can humble me’ is an absolute banger of a line. I love his voice for some reason too.

**strawberryswing1** (8.5): The first time I listened to the Black Panther soundtrack, this was one of the non-singles that stood out to me most. I really love the first half of this song -- issa total bop. But I had to deduct points because thought I love 2 chainz, I wish the beat switch and his part weren’t on here.

---
##Robbie, sweatie....

**robbiec\_** (10): **I sent a nude helicoptering my dick to this song**

##DAMN.

**Roxieloxie** (10): are you on ten yet

**ZankeeZero** (10): are you on 11 yet

**kanyewestrep3** (9): Kendrick Lamar, Q and Chainz all killed it. Saudi's verse brings it down from a 10 unfortunately

**turtle-thief** (9): Too many good verses, i'm too weak for this.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): kind of repetitive maybe?

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I just realized that this song means ‘ten’ just like how the iPhone X is the IPhone 10 (why tf did they skip 9 though...)

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Kendrick low key the best part of this song too

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): One of the more basic songs on this album, but it's still a banger! Kendrick's hook is super catchy, and both Q and 2 Chainz have fun verses. It goes on a little too long and Saudi's verse probably could have been cut, but I like it.

**twat\_brained** (7.8): Ohhh I get it now, Kendrick is saying "ten" because that's what "x" represents in Roman numerals. Why the number ten, though? Also I think I recognize Q and 2 Chainz but not Saudi, do they DJ on this track?

**1998tweety** (7.6): 2 Chainz is :god: as he has proven on bops like “Yes” with Louisa, and “Accelerate” with Godtina. The rest can go tho.

**notdallin** (7.6): Cut the ScHoolboy Q verse and you’ve got an incredibly tight Halloween Party song. It evolves just one minute too late.

##24K Magic

**Leixander** (7.5): kinda too long

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): sick

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): i love kendrick's subtle uncredited vocals on this

**CarlieScion** (7): to quote u/leixander "why is kendrick not credited on this, he basically makes the song by singing that hook sksk"

**kappyko** (7): actually wow this is fun but it kinda falls off with the last verse and chorus. outro is cute

**luigi\_is\_better** (7): "not even kendrick can humble me" is unironically a good line

**vodkainsipido** (7): i love you q

**radiofan15** (6.9): Infectious beat and kickass intro/chorus by Kendrick that somehow gets followed by some random somewhat-whack verses by ScHoolboy Q and Saudi (what does Rolex watches and Xanax had to do with the movie) only for 2 Chainz of all people to save the day with hi usual flow and usual gibberish. If it wasn;t on the soundtrack I might have though this was a 2 Chainz deep cut.

**jamesfog** (6.5): Kendrick's part is the best

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I love most of the artists involved here, but this is easily one of the most forgettable tracks on the soundtrack - Kendrick’s chorus is alright, Schoolboy Q kills it, but 2 Chainz doesn’t quite carry the momentum of the song, and Saudi is just kinda there at the beginning.

**enecks** (4): Oi, get this Xanax-referencing song that has "no homo" as a part of its lyrics out of this album.

**tapdancingpig** (4): This song is a bit of a mixed bag. I don’t love the chorus, and I’m not impressed with Saudi’s verse. Dumb drug references, vapid money references, and his masculinity is so fragile, he has to say “no homo.” ScHoolBoy Q and 2 Chains are more fun and more interesting, though.

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): Just a lovely, haunting little cover.

**strawberryswing1** (9): All the \#haters can rejoice, a Lorde song has been eliminated on day 2. I’ve read less than nice things about Lorde’s voice on this sub, but her voice is just lovely to me and she can encapsulate this tone that I would describe as “sickeningly sweet” in a lot of her songs that I love. She does that here to an almost haunting extent.

---

##Ladders

**Raykel** (10): It's a special time when one your favorite artists covers another one of your favorite artists #streambrighteyes

**theburningundead** (10): I love this cover so much, severely underrated and if it weren't for Yellow Flicker Beat this would absolutely have my 11

**turtle-thief** (10): gorgeous cover.

**radiofan15** (9.2): Having never heard the original, I can judge this one on its own merits. I like the religious imaginery (but also i'm glad Lorde changed the lyrics in a line about Jesus and Buddha) and the athmosphere, and how the whole thing applies to Panem. Probably my biggest complaint would be that this song feels more appropiate for any of the other Hunger Games movies, like the ones in which Katniss loses a very dear friend (Rue, Prim, Cinna) as the original song's subject matter.

**Roxieloxie** (8.6): really really beautiful

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): The organ backing of this song is really warm and nice. I generally like Lorde on more minimal production, and this is pretty much as minimal as you can go. It's good!

**1998tweety** (8): This is soothing and Lorde suites it well.

**enecks** (8): Lorde's one weakness in her Pure Heroine era was some bad covers. But this isn't one of those.

**kappyko** (8): i like tha organ. slap some drums on this and call it a melodrama bonus track baby! art + pop q+u+e+e+n!

**tapdancingpig** (8): Really haunting cover.

**notdallin** (7.9): that icy production really looks good on Bright Eyes

**twat\_brained** (7): Upon second listen I realize there's more to it than I initially imagined. Still doesn't really go anywhere, though, and it makes me disappointed in Lorde; she really ought to stick to writing her own songs.

**robbiec\_** (6.8): this is simple and cute

##Shutes

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): ok i love lorde but that song barely happened

**CarlieScion** (6): eh

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): this is the epitome of the indie-avocado voice

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This might be the most forgotten Lorde song right next to No Better, except this deserves to be forgotten

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): I love Killmonger, as a character and villain and cause he looks like Michael B Jordan, so of course I love this track. It’s the twin track to X, I think. And ‘you ain’t really in the field you just tweet a lot’, wow.

**strawberryswing1** (10): Holy shit this song is a BANGER !!! Y’all had me scared at first because in the beginning this was a Day 1 song but slowly good taste came in. Still, this was a little bit robbed. 

---
##Single Payer Healthcare

**SendMeYourSATScores** (11): i don’t have a comment but you can’t just not leave a comment for your 11

**robbiec\_** (10): this is the only SOBRBE song I like

**Roxieloxie** (10): #KillimongerWasRight

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I literally barely heard of SOB x RBE before this track, and honestly, I haven’t heard much of them after. Why? It’s because this is far and away their best contribution to this world. It’s a really weird song, with a flow that seems really disjointed and terrible, but hear me out - it’s weirdly addicting in a way that’s unexplainable, and the first verse rides the infectious beat pretty wildly. The intro to the third verse is just a complete tonal shift, and DaBoii just makes it work. This song is just hard as fuck and I expect it to be out pretty early, but y’all don’t know what you’re missing.

**vodkainsipido** (10): please sobxrbe end me

**Leixander** (9): donate to "i wish a bich would, the foundation"

**notdallin** (8.5): feels like a DAMN. leftover but that’s not actually a bad thing when that album was just so chock full of bangers.

**1998tweety** (8.2): My favourite word is the n word.

**radiofan15** (8): Finally a track that doesn't get embarassed for being part of a movie soundtrack! SOB x RBE really brings their A-Game in what is their breakthrough and they're helped by the infectuous beat and tight production.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): i wish /u/poppinmmolly would

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): banger

**enecks** (7): this is pretty solid NGL

**tapdancingpig** (6.8): I like the intro, and I like the first verse, but I do not like the chorus at all. The beat’s ok at least.

**twat\_brained** (6.8): Oh is this the part in the movie where Killmonger thinks he overthrew T'Challa so he gets himself treated?

##Republicans 

**Banananaise** (6.5): this transitioned SO smoothly into an airline ad and i was wondering for a second why a white lady was talking about comfy seats on the black panther soundtrack

**gowestyoungkanye** (7.8): When I was prepping this rate and saw Charli pop up on the tracklist, I did a double take. She’s certainly a far cry from the Charli we know and love today, but I actually like this a lot more than some of her current work (I’m waiting for the angry mob). It’s a nice little track.

**strawberryswing1** (7.5): This is one of those songs that is hard to put a number on for me. Part of me kinda hates it part of me kinda loves it. Charli has become one of my favorite pop girls but her stellar qualities don’t shine through this track at all. Still, it’s sorta nice to see a new side to her...idk. 

---
##[FRESH ALBUM] XCX World

**tapdancingpig** (11): I expecting a massive, out of place taunting song from Charli. I was disappointed at first, but HOLY SHIT THIS IS GOOD!

**didney-worl** (10): Charli is an angel confirmed

**PuggleMaster** (10): omg imagine this song with her 2018 autotune 💀💀💀💀💀

**Roxieloxie** (10): Charlie's voice on this song is so soft

**skargardin** (10): What the actual fuck how haven’t I heard this before? This is beautiful!

**turtle-thief** (10): It's such an interesting track. The production is so flowy and simple but starts glitching randomly, the airy falsettos, and that bridge is everything. It's just italian chef kiss

**ZankeeZero** (10): Charli's voice during the True Romance era was super healthy and i'm sad that it's gone, but this is one of her best songs from that era. Kinda wish she could revisit this sound, just for like, one song.

**kappyko** (9.5): putting charli xcx on a piano ballad is probably the worst decision anybody could have. it worked though UPDATE: i just listened to more of the song this slaps. i was gonna scream about a man being on this but its the guy from duran duran oops

**1998tweety** (9.2): I think this is the first piano ballad I've heard from Charli and honestly I like it.

**CarlieScion** (9): this is not what i expected from charli but i love it!!!!

**carly-rae_sremmurd** (9): Charli plz put Simon le Bon on Pop 3

**robbiec_** (9): omgggg????

**notdallin** (8.9): never knew I needed a Charli-fronted Vampire Weekend until now

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): I never knew charli was on this. A fairly different song for her.

**radiofan15** (8.2): This is such a nice surprise coming from Charleak... first, the fact that this song wasn't composed especifically for the movie and yet it fits so well with the themes of the franchise (if I have to say compare it to the soundtracks of other franchises, I gotta appreciate that the Hunger Games's soundtracks for their tendency of including mostly fitting songs, it might have something to do with how the Hunger Games' universe is such a great fit for good and interesting writing), second is the inclusion of Duran Duran's lead singer which is always appreciated. Probably my biggest perk with the song is how it ends so soon but i'm not really complaining about it.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): Is this Charli XCX or Kate Bush? Was Charli asked to sing like Kate here? Either way this is a bit too much of a clash for her style of music.

**Banananaise** (7): honestly charli xcx + rostam + ariel rechtshaid + simon le bon should have made something better

**luigi\_is\_better** (6.5): so in Brazil we have a very popular female singer called Xuxa that sings songs for children and this honestly sounds like a Xuxa song (minus the lyrics of course)

##[LEAK]

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6.5): It's fine, but I was expecting more from the combo of Charli, Rostam, and Ariel Rechtshaid. It's actually Charli who let me down most here, as her vocals are kind of pitchy and weaker than usual.

**Leixander** (6): cute but ??? sorry choli but this is a no from me

**pickupthephonebaby** (6): charli wasn't good yet

**raicicle** (6): is this a bad imogen heap song? maybe

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5.5): I'm trying to not fall asleep and this is not helping. igotigotitigotit

**enecks** (5): This really isn't Charli's best zone of operating in. It's too sugary and flavourless.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I love Charli XCX but this really just didn’t work at all, I don’t know why they just didn’t give her a normal ass dance song, smh.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (4): how was Charli not bored making this song

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): i don’t like this stream girls night out  *[Editor’s note: good advice regardless !]*

**Shippy** (3): omg i could not recognize who sang this and looked at the credits and then i realized why it sounded so strained

**gowestyoungkanye** (3.3): My lowest score in this rate — as host I chose three albums I love and I don’t hate any of the tracks enough to give a zero! I just find the brass so jarring and I feel bad because I love supporting other Scots, but her voice is also grating. So I don’t really enjoy Dead Air, no.

**strawberryswing1** (7): This is my first CHVRCHES song and I can’t say that I’ve become a fan of them. The song isn’t terrible but if I were to try to get into their other work it would take some time to get used to the singer’s voice, which is not my favorite.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): [this artwork on last.fm looks so badass. damn.](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/300x300/8c7792cf755d228c404bc96d756d2450.png)

**robbiec\_** (10): This song hits me right in the gut when it gets to the synth at the forty five second mark it’s just so cathartic

**jamesfog** (9): CHVRCHES last alberm overhated, Greg Kurstin snapped

**Leixander** (9): why is this better than most of their first album

**rotating3Dtext** (9): there’s something creepy about the concept of “being dead air”

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this is my favorite CHVRCHES song, i think this kind of mood suits them really well

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): another post election big mood

**1998tweety** (8.4): This is nice but it feels a bit forgettable.

**twat\_brained** (8.1): Why do we have to be dead air? Why not the dead rebels who sacrificed themselves in the name of freedom from Snow's fascism?

**enecks** (8): I can't believe a Mockingjay soundtrack song was less of a sellout than Love is Dead.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This really sounds like a Bones B-Side in the best way, and they were really delivering these random non-album singles in this time period, some of their coolest work imo.

**vodkainsipido** (8): maybe chvrches should go back to their bones / every open eye sound huh

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): i think every chuh vurches song i have ever heard has been a light to decent 7

**Raykel** (6.5): Kinda killed the hype the first track made :/

**notdallin** (6): did the post-Bones Chvrches albums ruin them for me or have they just always been a mediocre synthpop band? Asking for a friend

**raicicle** (6): a (medium) chvrches song

**CarlieScion** (5): i find her voice so annoying sorry

**gannade** (5): sounds like every churches song, which is ehhhhh

**luigi\_is\_better** (5): this is just like every chvrches song that ive listened to so im gonna rate like i rate all of them: not bad, but just meh

**Shippy** (5): this somg feels really out of place for the tone of this movie? idk

**radiofan15** (2.7): I was ready to call this one "dead air" but it just so bland I can't imagine calling it matter... it's more like "a loose group of protons wandering in an empty space devoid of life"... yeah, that's a more appropiate title.

**gowestyoungkanye** (8): I!! Like!!! Jorja!! Smith!!! And I like this song. Even if she always sounds so lethargic and oozy.

**strawberryswing1** (7): I’m not a big fan of R&B so this feels pretty basic to me.

---
##She is

**CarlieScion** (10): jorjas voice is so pretty

**enecks** (10): WOAH THIS IS GOOD

**Leixander** (10): great production, great vocals by jorja, what more can i ask?

**Roxieloxie** (10): the emotions in this track are everything!

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Jorja Smith is one of the most underrated, talented vocalists in the industry and while this isn't her best song, it's still fantastic. It's angsty and moody but also smooth and soulful. The production is harsher than what Jorja usually sings over, but she doesn't sound out of place at all. I'm so glad she got this spotlight from Kendrick while Drake is writing bitter songs about not getting to date her. Listen to Lost & Found NOW.

**mudkip1** (9.5): i like this but it's kinda jarring to hear this after opps

**kappyko** (9): Jorja... The Obtrusive Chanteuse

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): this slaps hard, too

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): this is good

**1998tweety** (8.8): This was going well but it loses some of its steam near the end.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): i liked it but i kinda can’t remember it

**twat\_brained** (8.3): Glad to have a chill lofi tune here that doesn't put me to sleep, unlike that Raury song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Jorja is always delivering consistency, and she does a great job over this wonderfully punchy beat.

**vodkainsipido** (8): jorja is such an amazing singer

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (7): I know lots of people find Jorja Smith boring but I'm a fan

##She is not

**robbiec\_** (6.7): I think this is the most conventional soundtrack song and it doesn’t do much for Jorja’s strengths

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): i feel like there's a lot of clashing elements here but there's talent on display at least

**notdallin** (5.9): No offense Jorja, but how the poopy did YOU score your OWN song on this soundtrack??

**PuggleMaster** (5.5): definitely the wrong song to put after Vince, but this song wasn't that good to begin with.

**radiofan15** (3.5): I like the subdued rock beat and Jorja's vocals but if this was a MCU marathon, the song would be Thor: The Dark World, or as it also known, Bathroom Break.

##Wild

**pickupthephonebaby** (11): THEN I FREAKED IT

**enecks** (10): If you give this a low score for Future's verse, you are a cop who hates fun.

**kappyko** (10): transition from bloody waters broke in my ass. this is better than dna.

**luigi\_is\_better** (10): this was legit very close to get my 11 just because when it was released i was listening to it nonstop. yeah it has the future meme but jay's flow is so mesmerizing and the outro is one, if not, the best part of the album. all hail king killmonger 👑

**robbiec\_** (10): this song is just so nuts and they had no right to make such a fucking amazing music video for this song when they didn’t even have to

**Roxieloxie** (10): future dies in infinity war

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Actually my most played song of 2018. An absolute banger from start to finish with a great beat switch.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): this is such an amazing song lmfao ladidadida slob on me knob

**ZankeeZero** (10): probably one of the catchiest choruses of this year, a great song that i hope will get far

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): LADIDADIDA SLOB ON MY KNOB

**radiofan15** (9.2): Memes aside, this track slaps so hard! Jay Rock's verse has a really great flow and is very enjoyable despite of how empty it is, Future does what Future has to do and his bridge is actually quite catchy, and Kendrick fucks up everyone as usual with his fire bars... oh and James Blake is also here for some reason.

**notdallin** (9.1): originally gave this song a 1.6 and then I FREAKED IT la di da di da~~

**Leixander** (9): going from slob on me knob to serious kendrick was an experience

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): I wasn't a fan of this at all the first time I listened to it, but it grew on me a lot. The song is just too much fun to resist, with a quick pace, energetic flows from Jay Rock, catchy hook from Kendrick, and memes from Future. While I don't really understand the point of having James Blake on here for 5 seconds, it does transition into Kendrick's fire verse so it's not totally pointless. L A D I D A D I D A

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): i freaked it

**1998tweety** (8): This was going so well until Future(?) decided to sing in that weird tone; also I can't decide if James' contribution is my favourite or least favourite.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (8): LA DI DA DI DA, SLOB ON ME KNOB

**skargardin** (8): Slaps but I still don’t get what Future was trying to achieve with the falsetto

**Raykel** (7): Ok but I love that part

**TragicKingdom1** (7): would be a lot better without the James Blake outro tbh

**twat\_brained** (7): Holy fuck Jay has some BARS! ………wait this is the song that references three 6 mafia and had stupid memes made from it? Damn this a major L chief ngl. This sounds like two songs in one, what happened to the start of the song? Does Kendrick say anything in the last minute that isn't just "red light", "green light", "fuck" or "not"? This started out great but just rolled right off the cliff M'Baku resides on.

**vodkainsipido** (7): https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/444170072072650772.png?v=1

**jamesfog** (6.5): la di da di da slob on me knob /u/ComeOnAndSlang

##Tourists

**mudkip1** (6.5): hm

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): i’ve never listened to this with headphones it’s cool

**raicicle** (5): im subtracting points solely for letting “i freaked it” happen as a meme, and also future

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Oh god, this is quite the controversial song. In theory, this should be the album’s hardest rap song, but instead, we get Jay Rock giving like 25%, Kendrick Lamar carrying all the weight in his verse, and Future doing sounding like a fucking elderly man on his deathbed in the bridge singing LADIDADIDA. The video is admittedly fantastic, but there’s not nearly enough James Blake, who should be manning the mediocre chorus.

**CarlieScion** (3): oh my god this song is so bad

**PuggleMaster** (0): this song is ruined by that dumbass meme and future. I hope it rots!
