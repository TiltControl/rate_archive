YOU ARE ALL FUCKING VIRGINS I HATE YOU ALLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# experienced sex havers

**akanewasright** (10): Why does this feel like it has Rico energy to me? I think I’m seeing a new take on the Fallon OHFR performance in my head when I hear this

**CrimsonROSET** (10): kim really was the blueprint

**plastichaxan** (10): i typed this 10 as soon as i heard the moans

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I can't listen to this song in public

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): Chase Icon’s impact omg

**BaconShoes** (9): a bop. People fuck to my music, they say it’s pornographic!! This beat is so horny

**bbfan132** (8.5): thought the start was a macarena sample… welp

**iniekcja\_** (8): thank god for pornographic music

**seanderlust** (8): oh come on I JUST got used to slayyyter sampling a porno in daddy AF

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): The moans... help.

**bigbigbee** (7.5): Her delivery is so unique always!

**bornskinnyhomo** (7.5): Bumped up a point for the moans

**hikkaru** (7.5): i'm honestly obsessed with the stark difference between the opening 30 seconds of this track and the opening 30 seconds of the prior track

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): well that sure is a way to make a beat

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I have so many questions: are the moanings fake? Did they record a woman fingering herself? Or did they record her having sex?

**waluigiest** (7): ok macarena tea

# virgins

**MrSwearword** (7): filthy production, lukewarm delivery

**throwaway-7650** (6.9): ghostin (ariana) did this concept better /hj

**indie\_fan\_** (6.8): The beat is sick and Kim knows how the ride the beat as well, but the moaning in the background that is heard throughout is irritating as hell to me, especially with how prominent it is.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): i'm loving her flow and the instrumental but the moaning is too loud in the mix

**Stryxen** (6.5): GOODNESS GRACIOUS the moans

**1998tweety** (6): moaning is a bit much

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This isn’t bad but it doesn’t slap, which is kinda worse in a way

**ricki** (6): the verses are a slay but the chorus is a drag and it’s like half the song :verve:

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I was like "oh this woman is about to go OFF" and then the beat slowed down and she didn't

**babadork** (5): Not a fan of the beat. The two verses are good, but it needs a third one.

**MC\_Fuzzy** (5): This beat ain’t it, and my favorite album has a skit of Biggie getting dome

**nt96** (5): Oh boy, not the moaning. Wait is the beat slowing down. Oh....so this moaning is just gonna continue throughout the song?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): The rapping and macarena moment is nice, but oh my god the moaning sample that won’t go away I hate it so much

**jackisboredtoday** (4): i see how the sampled moans are an interesting idea but I kinda hate it? they don’t really add to the beat outside of the moment where the beat repeats the breathy start over and over again in quick succession and it completely overwhelms the rest of the song for me, which is otherwise a good-not-great Kim track

**celladonn** (3): This specific moan sound is really annoying to me

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): ummmmm

**welcome2thejam** (3): Can't listen to anything with the headphones unplugged smdh

**fadedblue09** (2): can't stand that moaning, sorry

**voidofstars** (1): never liked the beat on this one

**2dina3dworld** (0): I’m sorry but the shock value of playing a moaning sample stops after the first minute or so, and for people who aren’t shocked by it, it just gets annoying after the first thirty seconds. Also this samples the Macarena. And it’s boring.

**frogaranaman** (0): that sample made me highly uncomfortable

**ImADudeDuh** (0): this would’ve been good had there not been the fucking moaning throughout the entire song

**moonagenightmares** (0): the moans literally making this unlistenable

**TiltControls** (0): Okay this song isn't terrible in all aspects and I like the idea of using the moaning. But the actual moaning sound effect sounds remind me of super over-exaggerated obvious porn scam ads that used to pop up out of nowhere when trying to find shows online. Use your fancy algorithm calculations to give me scams I'll actually fall for!

**TragicKingdom1** (0): the moaning and "goodness gracious" hook are really annoying sorry

This being out second is such a ???? moment to me, but I guess in an album full of male rapper features, a song with two of them, neither of which are parcticularly memorable, it makes sense that this just.... was kinda unanimously disliked it seems djdj.

---

# drag on

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This song makes me want to fight (compliment)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): it’s debatable that this should be on the album because Eve isn’t a presence on the song until the end, but her verse goes SO hard, the payoff is definitely worth it. Not to diss the men because they served too, the whole song is a bop!

**babadork** (8.2): I was not expecting this to be the song from this rate that I would get stuck in my head.

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): this was very loud

**BaconShoes** (7): a bop a vibe

# drag off

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): I'm gonna need less men on this song and more Eve please and thank you.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): eve feels like a feat, which is weird because her verse is by far the best

**thedoctordances1940** (6.7): got a cool beat and some cool energy but not much more really

**bornskinnyhomo** (6): It’s not bad, not amazing

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Speaking of lox I went to a cafe this morning and got an omelette sandwich and asked for it “without bacon” and then when I got home it turns out they misheard me and thought I said “without bagel” so I ended up with just an omelette that I couldn’t eat and I wish I’d just gotten a regular bagel instead because I have some lox in the fridge I could have put on it.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i didn’t know Jadakiss actually had a good song since i only knew him from Why

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): for the juice line

**jackisboredtoday** (5.2): this is the first song on the album where it feels like the production is actually the weak link… also i like male rappers fine but this has so little Eve on it that it prob shouldn’t be on her album

**1998tweety** (5): meh

**cremeebrulee** (4.7): is eve even on this

**fadedblue09** (4): was this actually her song? Didnt hear her till the end

**indie\_fan\_** (4): Should've been on The LOX's project. The production is just way too different and too much of an outlier from the rest of the album

**NotWith10000Men** (4): wish there was more eve on it, i'm a pophead i don't wanna listen to men

**plastichaxan** (4): ok girl

**slimboyfriend** (4): Although I lie Eve's verse and this song's placement on the album....... this is way too masc for me

**ricki** (3): is eve even in this

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): find the beat drag-on...find the beat...

**2dina3dworld** (1): something something the instrumental sounds like they’re rapping over a reputation 8 bit remix

**MrSwearword** (1): I don't fuck with this many unnecessary men and that Drag-On-fly bracelet that said the F-slur.

This is one of my favourite instrumentals on the whole album, and honestly this song explains perfectly to me why DMX was such a legend. I think this is one of the placements on the album I am most sad about, even if I get why, but this song is just such a powerful showing of the first lady and first man of Ruff Ryders I love it.

---

# homophobic but they have taste

**buddhacharm** (10): tried urban dictionary-ing double r and aesthetically I've decided that it's ... road rage?

**you2009** (10): ^_^

**akanewasright** (9.9): This is straight up an 11 without the rogue f-slur

**CrimsonROSET** (8): sigh

**DaHumanTorch** (8): another f slur oh that's not-

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): that vocoder sounds like Eminem and it makes me want to punch stuff like Limp Bizkit

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Did this man say the word too.... I hate it here.

**TiltControls** (7): hmmmmmmm

**waluigiest** (7): the writing is eh but I love the energy

**welcome2thejam** (7): I'm a simple man: you start off a track with DMX just yelling interjections like "yeah!" "what!" and "grrrr" and I'm immediately interested

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): RRIP X

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): yayy slur discourse time

**bbfan132** (6.5): the f slur again….

**NotWith10000Men** (6.3): i like the instrumental and eve but not feeling dmx

**celladonn** (6): growl... woof woof

**indie\_fan\_** (6): more or less same comments as the last song. DMX's verse is fine, but that's all I can say that really  get's my attention

**lady\_sable** (6): why is this man barking

# tasteless but idk gay rights i guess

**BaconShoes** (4): Eve is serving but this gets minus points for DMX using the f slur

**Saison\_Marguerite** (3.5): DMX was a legend, and he and Eve are both fire MCs… so I expected way better. This doesn’t work for me, even ignoring the slur. The instrumental and the hook are unfortunately annoying, and the verses are skilled but don’t compel me to return to this song.

**1998tweety** (3): minus 1 for the f-slur

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Darly Mae Xepsen?

**IIIHenryIII** (3): hearing her dogs might very likely sound better than this

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this homophobia was worse than the other song’s

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): eve served as usual but the rest of the song is a miss i fear

**ricki** (3): the song drags and it also has a slur? pick a struggle

**Uberpigeon** (3): i thought it would be slurs in a fun way but it wasnt

**seanderlust** (2): okay besides the f-slur, I really wish DMX varied his adlibs on the chorus - it feels repetitive - and overall it feels flat. plus the mosquito synth line is not it.

**bornskinnyhomo** (1): Another f-slur, Eve girl…

**MrSwearword** (1): Eve has better, DMX has better but let me open the "forbidden door" by saying fuck you to him and that can of Purple Drag-On from earlier.

HOW DID SHE LET THIS LITTLE GIRL EAT HER UP LIKE THIS ON HER OWN SONG LMAOOOOOOOOO

---

# trina girl she is coming for your career

**2dina3dworld** (10): Lil Brianna ate this up and left no crumbs! This is gonna get tanked because she’s a kid but you know I’m not wrong

**fadedblue09** (10): Rap verses mix well with that bubblegum chorus

**1998tweety** (9): does this sample something??? it BOPS

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): my weakness… songs that reference candy… also the sample is a serve, it takes a lot to sample a song like this and not be completely devoured

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Burruss as in the winner of The Masked Singer US season 3 as The Night Angel????

**NotWith10000Men** (9): of course i like the poppiest song

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): Vocal!!! The feature is so good.

**waluigiest** (9): she was 10 YEARS OLD here wtf??

**bbfan132** (8.5): this is super fun idc

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): the way this random toddler came out of nowhere and ate trina up on her own song i'm losing my mind

**you2009** (8.5): it's just something sweet for the fucking kids <3

**akanewasright** (8): I hate kids but this song is allowed

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this sounds like a popsicle ad

**iniekcja\_** (8): lil Brianna next queen of rap

**vayyiqra** (8): Lil Brianna ate, unironically

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Even though this is G rated Trina her flow still sounds the same as when she wants her ass slapped. And I think it’s, uh, special that the kids call Lil Briana “baby Trina”….

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): what in the kidz bop... trina got ate up by a child

**seanderlust** (7.2): lil brianna is so cute omfg

**IIIHenryIII** (7): sweet sugar Kandi girl

**lady\_sable** (7): ohh no that chorus is going to live rent free in my head now

**Uberpigeon** (7): ended emily montes

**welcome2thejam** (7): Honestly, good for Lil Brianna. I 1000% doubt she was old enough to listen to the vast majority of this album though

**moonagenightmares** (6.7): cute switchup

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): not what i expected from the feature but I guess i should’ve taken the Lil more seriously

**MC\_Fuzzy** (6.5): I did not expect a 10 year old as a guest rapper on this type of album.

**nt96** (6): It's cute I guess

**plastichaxan** (6): this sounds like a song that’d play at the end of an animated kids movie but it's a Cupcakke remix idk how to explain

# r/childfree 

**babadork** (5.9): This child is a pretty good rapper, but I don’t want children in my Trina songs.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): this sounds like a Jackson 5 song gone wrong

**BaconShoes** (4): now why is a child rapping about skittles on this album

**celladonn** (4): Who allowed their child to appear on this album lol

**ricki** (4): ???????

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4): literally what is this… not Trina trying to be G-rated

**bornskinnyhomo** (3): Unlistenable…is this supposed to be camp?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): The New Edition sample was not that great. And so sorry Lil Brianna was not feeling this song

**BeauMeringue212** (2): what in the Jackson 5 ... who took this poor girl outta school for this

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): errr...what is this kid doing here

**voidofstars** (2): cute but why?

**frogaranaman** (1): what the fuck is this

**indie\_fan\_** (1): What in the Nickelodean X P*rnhub crossover is this...

**MrSwearword** (1): I cannot condone child cruelty.

**cremeebrulee** (0): this is the most obnoxious chorus i've ever heard and i would like this song to suffer

This is bubblegum camp stupid as fuck and it is everything I've ever wanted, the Tom's Diner sample is literally genius, Kim's approach to the track and the character she takes on for it is amazing and I think she's a mastermind. She knew *exactly* what she was doing with this track, it is a tongue in cheek dance track and I will defend it til the day I die.

---

# camp

**akanewasright** (10): This is literally the 00s version of don’t rock me to sleep, but 100 times better

**ImADudeDuh** (10): what the fuck is going on

**you2009** (10): compact music for polly pockets to listen to

**bbfan132** (9.5): the samples…. :listening:

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): Another sample I’m pretty obsessed with. This song is so fun

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): finally, some disco

**waluigiest** (9): try to listen without dancing… few can succeed

**seanderlust** (8.5): kim's diner

**babadork** (8.1): I might have gone with a 10 if it had been just Kim’s parts, but Carl Thomas was always kind of boring.

**BaconShoes** (8): it’s groovy, i forgot she sampled tom’s diner here lol

**CrimsonROSET** (8): its provocative it gets the people going etc etc

**TiltControls** (8): Kim's Diner

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): I like the guys voice. This is really good. Might be my fav from kim so far.

**hikkaru** (7.5): this sample is fun though

**frogaranaman** (7): Lil' Kim really loves the word daddy huh

**vayyiqra** (7): Yet another weird sample choice, but it's not bad. I guess. It's jarring, but it does bop.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I know I said the Art of Noise sample in the last song was the last thing I expected to hear going into this album, but Cathy Denis and Lil Kim existed in entirely different dimensions before this song.

# conversion camp

**iniekcja\_** (6): this is very unmemorable for me

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): it’s giving rave.dj mashup of Toms Diner and Thong Song but go off I guess

**BeauMeringue212** (5.5): has anyone not stamped Tom's Diner lmao

**MrSwearword** (5): at least it's funny but yeah...I can't with it.

**voidofstars** (5): i appreciate how different this sounds but i don’t think it was executed the right way

**jackisboredtoday** (4.7): i didn’t think there would be a worse take on Tom’s Diner than the Britney one but this is kinda a hot mess

**bornskinnyhomo** (4): It's almost worthy of....something. But it's not. The singing is off-putting by both parties.

**MC\_Fuzzy** (4): Bro, Carl is the best part of this song. . . But I’m not on board.

**cremeebrulee** (3.7): ok what the fuck

**MoonlightByWindow** (3.5): nice chorus but this voice kim puts on is a jumpscare tbh

**Stryxen** (3.5): yeah nah i can’t stand this. it’s so messy but there are some really good moments hidden in it

**IIIHenryIII** (3): brush your teeth y'all at least twice a day and don't forget to floss

**NotWith10000Men** (3): your breath smells like shit anyway lmfao

**indie\_fan\_** (2.2): Kim...why...do...you...try...to...sing...

**TragicKingdom1** (1): is no song too sacred

**bookthieving** (0): sometimes rap girls should just stick to rapping

**fadedblue09** (0): Really generic and out of place on the album, nauseating lyrics and atrocious sample, etc.

# denali

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Cool to hear her tackle a somewhat harder topic on an otherwise raunchy album, and it doesn’t feel out of place either. I dig the silky smooth production as well, and she’s one of the better singers of the artists in the rate.

**nt96** (7.8): More like 78% C+

**BeauMeringue212** (7.5): "yall know I'm from Miami right?" Eh yeah you..  mighta mentioned it

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): This is probably my least fav on the album. It's still good though.

**1998tweety** (7): 100% Orange Juice the game a serve

**CrimsonROSET** (7): it’s not right but it’s ok

**indie\_fan\_** (7): more or less what I said for U & Me

**ricki** (7): Yung Miami yeah bitch I'm from the city

**TiltControls** (7): more like 70%

# kahmora

**throwaway-7650** (6.6): more like 66%... anyway, not this song being how I find out that several NFL players, including one that trina used to date, have workplace sexual misconduct allegations and were fired together because of them...

**bbfan132** (6.5): i like trina’s verses but the chorus/hook….. oof

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I like this change of subject matter, but the singing is throwing me off a little

**skargardin** (6): Insert a percentage comment here

**waluigiest** (6): that hook…. Oof

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): I’m sorry but balladphobia yass

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Love the light R&b elements but doesn't really stand out

**BaconShoes** (5): decent but not quite my vibe

**MrSwearword** (5): I think this was done better on "U & Me".

**IIIHenryIII** (4): well, she didn't give 100%, otherwise this song would be good

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): not sure if the vocals here work for me teabh but these are some of trina's best lyrics

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3.5): This is definitely the weakest song here. The singing is so bad in the chorus. I can’t find who’s singing it so I might be slandering some legends, sorry! Until I’m told otherwise, I’m just gonna say it’s giving “I’m giving my cousin a favor” vibes

**cremeebrulee** (2): oh this hook is not good

i honestly just have nothing to say abt this song ?????? the fanmade sims music video is the only saving grace

---

**iniekcja\_** (10): conservatives when they switch to a fake account to push an agenda

**seanderlust** (8.7): the chorus and bridge feel a little clunky

**CrimsonROSET** (8): we love a religious queen

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): I like the beat. The collab was actually really good.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): overstays its welcome a bit but still good

**IIIHenryIII** (7): is this the *Let Me Love You* guy?

**ImADudeDuh** (7): The owner of queenbitch.com is offering it for sale for an asking price of 36000 EUR!

**BaconShoes** (6.5): not my favorite vibe, but she’s spitting

**bornskinnyhomo** (6.5): I liked her bars, but the hook/male vocalist was lackluster

**nt96** (6.5): Took me a while realize the chorus was interpolated from Sade. I love Sade, but this song is ok.

**indie\_fan\_** (6.2): The mario is feature is decent, the subject matter is decent. That's it, the song is just decent

**DaHumanTorch** (6): this was in the 9 or 10 range until she said #that word

**MrSwearword** (5): vibe clash is present with Mario Winans against a Lil Kim song...just...no.

**RandomHypnotica** (4.6): "Keep my jewels frozen like they've been in the freezer" …

**fadedblue09** (4): For a song about boasting, this is so boring

# u should all like.... 

**throwaway-7650** (10): same sis @ relationship status!

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): two out of three

**1998tweety** (7): I can relate with 1 of the things listed here

# vayy ur fine dont worry its a bad song

**vayyiqra** (5): Idk I'm guilty for this because I'm speedrunning this rate but I wasn't into this and had to skip the end of it (and a few other songs) to save time please forgive me King

**bornskinnyhomo** (8): Not for broke bitches

**CrimsonROSET** (8): is it offensive to say missy is the mom of hip hop like i can imagine her bringing cookies to the bake sale

**waluigiest** (8): it was okay but the “if you’re broke say you’re broke” chorus is too strong

**BeauMeringue212** (7.8): "I ain't on no ra ra shit" Gaga when  gays ask her to sing Bad Romance

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): guess you can say the title refers to the man's ass since all it's blowing up is some smoke

**lady\_sable** (7.5): eat the rich but also if it slaps it slapa

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I like this melody. Her flow is sooo good.

**BaconShoes** (7): a bop

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): now what is this about a chinese man reversing it... should I have given this a 5.7 instead? let me still be a kind rater because I like you missy...

warm

**1998tweety** (7): Avril Lavigne outsold

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the lady gaga - bad romance diss at 0:21

**akanewasright** (6.5): Not her re-reusing the Work It chorus… but I do like the speech at the end

**fadedblue09** (6.5): This was okay but it felt like it went nowhere

**seanderlust** (6.5): please don't call back to the racist part of work it

**cremeebrulee** (6.1): i'm broke

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): was great but kinda drags i fear

**Stryxen** (6): the outro is so good i had to raise my score a bit but some lines (just one really) has not aged well

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I appreciate the lyrics, not the music

**MrSwearword** (5): boring, but it made me remember, the Murcielago is a more interesting Lamborghini than that overrated Gallardo or Aventador (especially if it's a Four Door Aventador).

# cold

**TiltControls** (5): not

**indie\_fan\_** (1.2): One second thought, this is probably my least favorite Missy X Timbaland song. Just an irritating ass hook and honestly don't find Missy's voice on this track too appealing

Honestly I'm so exhausted rn and I think if I tried to write a complex, developed thinkpiece abt this song I'd actually explode but I really love what Kim tried to do here even if it is entirely ridiculous.

---

# too many of these girls let themselves get washed by a kid on their albums at least the kid IS kim in this case

**RandomHypnotica** (10): im a sucker for tracks that are literally just somebody narrating a story

**throwaway-7650** (10): not another MC getting eaten up by a kid... I-

**BaconShoes** (9): This whole album has influences from the Notorious BIG obviously, but this one reminds me of him for sure with the storytelling, and i love the personification of her period

**nt96** (9): Empire could never

**you2009** (9): something sweet for........the kids?

**indie\_fan\_** (8.3): Runs a bit too long for my taste but still once again a solid showcase of her storytelling. Kim kills it when she raps as "Shanice" as well.

**lady\_sable** (8): she's so extra lmao

**waluigiest** (8): by the time you read this…. Mmm watcha say

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): What in the world is this about? Am I missing something?

**moonagenightmares** (7.3): i liked this but its a bit too long

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): love the instrumental

**bornskinnyhomo** (6.5): I wasn’t obsessed with this one, but the concept is there

**CrimsonROSET** (6): … ok?

**MrSwearword** (6): the ambition is to be admired but this is a CHOICE to put this at the end of the album.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): the narrative here is exhausting, I think? I couldn't concentrate on what they're saying, sorry

**2dina3dworld** (3): this is kinda cheesy

# is this about periods??

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): I’m smooth brained so the period metaphor went over my head until I visited Genius and re-read the rate post. I thought it was about legitimate family drama of Kim’s. Anyways… I’m kind of obsessed with the lyrics now, I can definitely read layers into this about fear of parenthood and shit, she was ahead of her time with this quirky personification of a topic that’s simultaneously taboo and not taken seriously enough. And this is why Lil’ Kim is a feminist icon, I hope riot grrls were taking notes!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): ngl when the song started I thought it was gonna be about PMS but I guess she doesn’t have the range that DOECHII does

**celladonn** (7.5): I like the beat a lot but this goes on a bit. Also is this really about periods lol

**akanewasright** (6): …So is this just all one big period joke?

**seanderlust** (6): hm.....I think we got a little sidetracked from the main metaphor but okay!

**iniekcja\_** (10): i feel like people hate this type of theme but this is great

**bbfan132** (9): this production :listening:

**NotWith10000Men** (9): the longer this goes on the more i like it

**throwaway-7650** (9): the "no!" reminds me of how bruno mars (? idk) sings

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.3): the Fuck U Betta-print. why is it kinda giving Michael/Janet Jackson?

**BaconShoes** (8): relatable freak content

**fadedblue09** (8): This slaps, despite the lyrics being clearly a product of its era

**nt96** (8): Could've sworn that was TLC 💀

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): And here I thought this was gonna be a sappy, slow rap song about how she doesn't love him but Kim does.... safe to say I was wrong...

**welcome2thejam** (8): Beat goes hard, and the quick King of Rock interpolation was a massive serotonin boost.

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): what is a relationship built on? Love, respect? Lil Kim has a bold proposition here, a vision, a question for the culture. What is a relationship built on?

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): something about her voice makes me believe her, she sounds like she means everything she says

**seanderlust** (7.5): the delivery on the third verse kind of gives me rico nasty teas

**voidofstars** (7.5): i LOVE kim’s singing voice on this

**thedoctordances1940** (7.1): 😳

**CrimsonROSET** (7): sample jumpscare

**slimboyfriend** (7): I’m listening this at work hearing Lil Kim say “I’ll let you cum in me/Stick it in the booty/lick the nut off then stick it back in the cootie” on company time.

**Uberpigeon** (7): two weeks by fka twigs

# she doesnt love you get over it man

**bornskinnyhomo** (6.5): The beat went so hard, but the hook and rap weren’t my favorites

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.5): So many choruses on this album are not very good, but the verses are great

**skargardin** (6): There's quite a lot of filler so far I feel like, but tbf I haven't outright disliked anything yet

**ImADudeDuh** (5): EVELYN ‘CHAMPAGNE’ KING’S THIRD TRACK OFF OF “GET LOOSE,” ‘BETCHA SHE DON’T LOVE YOU’ REFERENCE????

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): a point off for being a minute longer than it needs to be

**MrSwearword** (5): I mean the lyrics are cute but the beat doesn't work for this.

**Stryxen** (5): the verses are GREAT - this song could potentially be a 10 without the chorus but it’s just kinda… really bland and doesn’t sound good and takes up half the song

**indie\_fan\_** (1.2): IMMEDIATE SKIP. Production Does not suit Kim at all and I just want to know why the hell she chose to "sing" here

Trina wants you to know she's from Miami.

---

# trina when she's an afro latina

**waluigiest** (10): she is SERVING on this beat.

**2dina3dworld** (9.5): this would be better if they didn’t have the skit at the start

**frogaranaman** (9): mamiiiiiiiiii

**ImADudeDuh** (9): we love Latino representation

**TiltControls** (9): another addition to the Missy Elliott extended universe

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): Maybe I should live in Miami with Trina, honestly

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wait after all that there ARE bad male features in this rate? You could have fooled me

**IIIHenryIII** (8): she knows that ain't how you spell ass in Spanish, right?

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): we LOVE a missy reference (god she's really all over this album huh) but like that's what it is, the chorus gets OLD

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): This beat is so good. The feature is so meh to me.

**BaconShoes** (7): latina queen

**jackisboredtoday** (7): this is the opposite of the a lot of the album in that i remember the hook and very little else

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): "so i'm straight" how could you trina??

**indie\_fan\_** (6.6): The slight latin influences are a bit of a throwoff, but actually work in well.

# kim when she's an aFrO lAtInA

**fadedblue09** (6.5): This feels like a clunky version of Get This Money

**plastichaxan** (6.5): -0.5 for spelling poppy with an i

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): It’s very much Kim’s No Matter What They Say but not as good because Trina only has like half a verse

**akanewasright** (5): Her verse serves, but I kinda hate the faux Latin sound

**NotWith10000Men** (4.5): duece poppi sounds bad on the hook :/

**BeauMeringue212** (3): OK this is trash lmao, mami culo took me out

# iHate

**MrSwearword** (0): NOPE. I can't. It's such third rate straight club music nonsense, iCannot, iWillnot, iRefuse, iShant.

If Hold On > I'm Human didn't exist this would certainly be the most odd transition of songs across these albums sjdjsd, but as goofy as it is I really like this song as a closer. Eve's flow is as solid as ever, and idk it's cute she's cutesy!!

---

# be yourself

**throwaway-7650** (10): c? you'll miss me when I'm not around !?

**TiltControls** (10): i also would like to go out and see the world rn : (

**CrimsonROSET** (9): you do you girl

**waluigiest** (9): a cute little closer I love it!

**BaconShoes** (8): i love Eve’s flow

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): the hook reminds me of Ashanti a bit

**bornskinnyhomo** (7): Fresh beat and nice conclusion to the album

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I heard this before, it sounds familiar

**seanderlust** (7): the more i hear this song the more i like it. i still wouldn't stay it's more than good IMO, but the "we can all buy the bar but we can't all sell" line and the instrumental going up in pitch rather than down is really cool

# be literally anybody else

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): This is kinda meh. Not my fav, not my least fav.

**MrSwearword** (6): is this the same Mashonda who's sharing/blended family with Swizz and Alicia Keys? That's more interesting than the song. Mainly Mashonda's contribution but Eve is consistency personified on this album.

**celladonn** (5.5): Not a big fan of the hook or instrumental here

**RandomHypnotica** (5.4): that chorus is… not good… nothing feels like it goes together

**2dina3dworld** (4): I’m sorry but the guest vocalist is super nasally

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): #not a fan of this beat methinks and life is so hard would have been a better closer

**indie\_fan\_** (2): Easy ass skip. I get why it's used a closer, but it really should have ended with Life Is So Hard

kim the first one was fine you literally didnt need to make a second

# i think this is the only song in the rate that got no 10s idk why that sends

**celladonn** (9): banger

**TiltControls** (8.5): do i need to listen to Queen Bitch Pt. 1 to understand Pt. 2?

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): mm maybe this would make more sense if I’d seen the first one

**skargardin** (8): love her flow here

**throwaway-7650** (8): love the toad voice going "bee-yatch!"

**indie\_fan\_** (7.6): Still PALES in comparison to Pt. 1, but this "sequel" of sorts is still solid on its own for what it is. Also a well used sample of Biggie's voice.

**BaconShoes** (7.5): wanna run up in my pussy like a pap smear

**bornskinnyhomo** (7.5): This goes hard

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): This is probably one of my fav collabs in the whole rate.

**babadork** (7.1): I don’t think it’s that discerning to not want a guy to taste like slaw.

**akanewasright** (7): This is alright, but she doesn’t say “got buffoons eating my pussy while I watch cartoons” on the track, so part 1 is automatically better

**CrimsonROSET** (7): pardon my french but this is a seven

# the sequel was worse

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): it's a hate crime i have to listen to diddy's nonsensical rhyming here after so much amazing rapping in this rate

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.8): This song felt super long

**cremeebrulee** (6.4): "the way i rock you to sleep like a lullaby" i don't think this is a good thing kim

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): not gonna lie the Biggie hook is by far the strongest thing here

**slimboyfriend** (6): my fav part of this song is Biggie’s :/

**MC\_Fuzzy** (5.5): Biggie saved this for me. Was disappointed that it wasn’t a full verse

**voidofstars** (5): its good but not as good as the original (& whyyyyy is diddy on this ugh)

**RandomHypnotica** (4.8): piss kink

**IIIHenryIII** (4): the original Queen B

**MrSwearword** (4): meh, the only really subpar song that isn't outright shit I've encountered thus far.

I love how sugary the beat and instrumental feels on this one, it's a different side to Eve but I think I like it, and even if the vocals on the chorus are kinda weak, it's really catchy to me.

# ctfu

**iniekcja\_** (10): she's edging him hard

**throwaway-7650** (10): love ?'s contributions in the chorus with their vocals

# gettin some

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): Robin Thicke stay away from Eve!!!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): What's wrong with his friends being feminine?

**BaconShoes** (8): a jam, i enjoy the chorus a lot

**CrimsonROSET** (8): creep

**ricki** (8): i like the beat

**Stryxen** (7.6): bop

**bornskinnyhomo** (7): It’s a good flow

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): period queen

# gettin a little

**MrSwearword** (8): at least it's just Eve riding the beat. It's not quite among the highs of the album but it's cute.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): not bad but it just kinda sits there

**skargardin** (7): slightly fillerish bop

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): cute, and i like the production, but this song really feels longer than it is

**1998tweety** (6.5): bops a bit

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): why’d she have to call me out like this

**indie\_fan\_** (6): Hooks are really Eve's weakness, isn't it?

# gettin fuckin NONE

**IIIHenryIII** (5): you ain't getting none good score

**plastichaxan** (5): ok but you ain’t giving none so

**moonagenightmares** (4.2): i thought that was kali uchis in the chorus for a second

**seanderlust** (4.2): i just don't really feel anything one way or another about this song

**babadork** (3.9): It would be better without the record scratch that is the chorus.

# im

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): this beat is really intriguing for the year 2001 but I can't tell if it's date rape-y...?

**waluigiest** (7): I’ll take this chance to say I live that every song starts with her “this is a Missy Elliot production” like I know I’m actively listening to your album

**welcome2thejam** (7): Always seem to forget it, but Missy's singing voice is such a strong part of her game

**ImADudeDuh** (6): me to tk’s rate comments

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): is this proto hyperpop?

# that aint funny

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): don’t like this one, it’s harsh and repetitive

**indie\_fan\_** (3): uhh forget what I just said. The production on this track is way too abrasive for me that I really can't focus on anything else. Easy skip for me

I wish I liked this more than I do, because I love Eve's choice in sample, but I think the sample is kind of the songs weakness for me, it just feels like a shitter version of the song it is inspired by, with weaker vocals too.

---

# besties

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Iconic Dawn Penn sample, and Stephen and Damian sound great here. We love all the Jamaican excellence Eve is spotlighting here

**Roxieloxie** (10): solidarity with my island bestie darj <3

# yes yes yes

**seanderlust** (10): this is such a nice switch up from the rest of the hard-hitting album

**BeauMeringue212** (9.3): the reggae sound really works here, Eve is great at mixing genres. Love her singing voice too

**fadedblue09** (9): A nice rendition of a classic

**iniekcja\_** (9): I love making summer playlists in the winter, I really do

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): the way my first exposure to the song this samples was Rihanna’s Music of the Sun album

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jffl-ceZ2b4

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Apink outsold.

**BaconShoes** (8): a fun lil reggae moment

**indie\_fan\_** (8): A bit of an outlier in comparison to the rest of the album, but not bad at all to me and Eve's singing on this is rather decent.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): i could kinda do without the stephen marley verse but otherwise this is gorg

**skargardin** (8): I feel like I've heard this before, but I can't for the life of me recall where

**vayyiqra** (8): Thinking "oh interesting a reggae-influenced song" "[sees Damian Marley]" "oh that makes a lot of sense"

**voidofstars** (8): island giiirrllll!

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): this had potential, I believe

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**celladonn** (7): This chill reggae song feels pretty out of place on this album but it's fine I guess

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this one kinda just drags, i don’t know

**MC\_Fuzzy** (7): Good to hear Stephen and Damian, and I like the new spin on the beat. I will admit that Dawn’s original vocals are better than Eve’s

**waluigiest** (7): so everyone in the early-mid 00’s had their own take on this song huh

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): nice but i don’t know if this is the best version of the No No No hook I’ve heard or not

**akanewasright** (5): This is okay, it’s just… idk it doesn’t feel like there’s much to the song. The Marleys enliven it a little but other than that this is dull

**MrSwearword** (5): boring reggae-lite beat. They tried something different but this wasn't needed.

**babadork** (4.1): I wish they had done more with this. It’s still very close to the original “You Don’t Love Me (No, No, No)” with a little bit of added rapping.

**Stryxen** (2): simply it just doesn’t do anything for me

### these all sent me for different reasons

# im \*checks writing on green hand* hue man

**iniekcja\_** (10): this is fun, I thought this would be something much different hugging by the title and placement on the album

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): experimental diva moment

**throwaway-7650** (10): trailblazing queen of autotune, caroline polachek could never

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Wait, this is good too! Might be a tie for my fav Kim song...

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): I kinda love that the last song on this album really just went in a totally different direction

**bbfan132** (9): v good outro!!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): it was a different time

**seanderlust** (8.6): this is what plays when you are fighting lil Kim as a boss fight

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): I like how futuristic this sounds

**TiltControls** (8.5): Hmm I don't know, that sounds like something a robot would say

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): what the fuck is she talking abou

**babadork** (8.3): This is the song that grew on me the most between when I first listened to the album and now. At first listen, the autotune is a bit clumsy compared to what we’re used to today.

**bigbigbee** (8): The sort of techno-groove of this track feels really fresh and unique in this rate. I love it.

**fadedblue09** (8): Feels like a predictable way to close the album, but still a banger

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): ratchet up the production a bit and this is hyperpop

**BaconShoes** (7.5): man this is such a solid album. This was possibly the first song by a major female rap artist to use autotune? which is cool

**1998tweety** (7): Christina Perri ended

**MrSwearword** (7): a bold choice for a closer...even if the previous track would've made better sense. Oh well.

**bornskinnyhomo** (6.5): The “la la la’s” killed me, but otherwise I liked it

**indie\_fan\_** (5.7): I actually like the verses, but the hook... I just want a talk to whoever implemented autotune in her voice near a tall flight of stairs.

**frogaranaman** (5): wasn't she getting put on trial at the beginning of this album where did this presidency come from

**IIIHenryIII** (5): yeah, and as humans, we all make mistakes, like this song

**waluigiest** (5): this feels wildly misplaced and underwhelming

**voidofstars** (4): wish she ended this album with hold on

**BeauMeringue212** (3): I hate this ngl, it sounds weird and the lyrics are giving Marina and the Diamonds

# do conscious hip hop in march

**sufjancaesar** (0): this was a cacophonous assault on my ears

The intro to this song is actually brilliant to me, the instrument in the background that sounds like it is going up? so cool, and how she comes in before the beat? she knew exactly what she was doing. Styles is ultimately one of the weaker features on this album for me, but he's still far from bad and Eve's verse is awesome so idc.

# harry

**CrimsonROSET** (9): its like mansplaining but with murder

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): fuck it UP, this hype man is turning it out

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Oh, is that what it is? I would've never known, it's not like you repeated it a million freaking times.

**MrSwearword** (8): Styles is so unnecessary on this. At least Eve has consistency on lock.

**skargardin** (8): THAT'S WHAT IT IS

**you2009** (8): what is it?

**akanewasright** (7.5): This one is fun but the hook is a touch grating

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): eve please miss once so my album average isn't so high pls pls

# the other four idk do y/n

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): the chorus gets really old/repetitive quickly

**TiltControls** (7.5): There was like 4 things listed that it was. Which is it????

**1998tweety** (6.5): alright

**fadedblue09** (6.5): The feature gets really annoying after a while

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): this song is not that good, that's what it is

**BaconShoes** (6): could use more Eve

**indie\_fan\_** (6): I'm relistening to this realizing that Hooks are not exactly her strength, at least to me. Nothing exactly offensive from this song, but the production is a bit uneventful to me.

**waluigiest** (6): it starts strong and I love the piano but it really gets lost

**babadork** (5): I do not appreciate being repeatedly told that Eve does not care about me.

**nt96** (5): This song gets repetitive. That's what it is.
