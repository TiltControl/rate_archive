Legendary MC’s Reveal Day 2: Cause I’m a Nasty Bitch, give a 0 to your fave
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/sfoyjj/legendary_mcs_reveal_day_2_cause_im_a_nasty_bitch/

[Hi!!](https://i2.wp.com/www.jojocrews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Kim-Eve.jpg?fit=480%2C480&ssl=1) In case you missed Day 1, Missy and Trina came out almost unscathed, and Kim and Eve were kinda massacred but bc kim's album has so much filler you wouldn't even be able to tell

Today will be from **#39 to #21** and the reveal today will begin at **3PM EST** once again, **but** unfortunately I will not be running it, I fear I have clashing plans :woeis:. *Fortunately* you will be in the very capable hands of u/akanewasright and u/darjeelingdarkroast, who I have handed everything off to for the reveal to run as smoothly as it should! Give them a lot of love for being able to take over for me, and I hope everyone enjoys today as much as I envisioned you all when I was planning it, I wish I could be there too

Now this is a controversial one, because this is far from one of the best songs on the album and there were much more interesting and deserving single choices, but also this song is just very fun and I love the switch-ups throughout it, I think the rapper's delight sample is used brilliantly too.

---

# mmm whatcha say

**nt96** (10): "If I was you, I'd hate me too" Eat your heart out and get scalped Megan.

**voidofstars** (10): one of my favorite rap songs of all time and the mv added to the glamour

**you2009** (9.5): very festive

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Sounds weird but I love the sample

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): single bias elevates this, ngl

**seanderlust** (8.5): sex and the city theme song but so much better

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Is it just me or is the production really quiet? Idk it could just be me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): sounds like something an unimportant side character in a modern Disney movie would sing

**MrSwearword** (8): a good single but it might've been better as ["Bad Girls" with RuPaul...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XaGzta8-bM) also I have to ask but what the fuck is Lil Kim's deal with rice? Why does she hate rice so fucking much?

**thedoctordances1940** (7.7): well apart from a slur use (which ig is something you kinda have to ignore for this rate) this is a bop and a nice little rendition of rapper's delight

**BaconShoes** (7.5): a fun track

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): the bad girls mention (and the genius annotation) reminded me of the RuPaul collab that was originally gonna be on the album (Drag rate promo???)

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): this is so weird and i really like it

**indie\_fan\_** (6.9): Again, I know this is a fan favorite, but the reggae-ish vibes of this song during the hook always throws me off. At least she still kills the verses

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): not RuPual on the [original scrapped song's remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XaGzta8-bM) and it bopping...

**CrimsonROSET** (6): please dont throw ice at the groom and bride it WILL hurt

**Uberpigeon** (6): i wanted this to be the tracy beaker theme

**bornskinnyhomo** (5.5): Not the biggest fan of this one, but it has its merits

**akanewasright** (5): …Lil Kim didn’t even want this on the album, let alone as the lead single, because she thought it was generic and too of its time, and she was right! This aged badly, and the original lead single (The Queen, a song that was cut after it leaked) was one of Kim’s best. She could have released the song with a bar about pegging, but her label chose this instead!!

**BeauMeringue212** (5): I don't like the Latin pop sound tbh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): This is not a zero because the rap is good. But the chorus is so off-key it’s hard to listen to.

**celladonn** (0): I literally cannot believe this was the lead single from this album I'm sorry but it sounds like a complete mess to me

# gucci jdedjkasd

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): when she started rhyming kites with fights i just knew the d slur was coming but it's okay she's allowed to say it <3

# that is a fun fact

**IIIHenryIII** (7): fun fact, this is the only non-explicit song on the album

This is the light spot in a kinda mid run on the album, the beat picks up, and Missy is flirty and fun!! Kinda robbed but there are much bigger robberies today so I'll forget this.

---

# thats so embarassing omg i definitely said one of the day 1 songs was the only one with no 10s LMAO

**TiltControls** (9.5): oh with all that meowing it looks like Missy got her pussycat working after all

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Missy isn’t the best singer but I really like her voice here… or maybe the uncredited background vocalist is carrying her, Idk. It’s nice though.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): i'm jamming out in my bed to this how have i never heard it before???

**welcome2thejam** (9): Missy Elliott is ready to be my "excuse me he asked for no pickles" gf

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): wow this started SO strong and then it just fizzled out

**BaconShoes** (8): oh this is good turn that up

**BeauMeringue212** (8): female down bad anthem

**frogaranaman** (8): I DO know what a good dick would do!

**vayyiqra** (8): The "Funky Drummer" beat makes most songs better

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I'm sorry but the cat noises are sending me for some reason.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): (cat sound) gonna tell my kids that's what a vagina sounds like when the time of "the talk" finally comes

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ok jesus christ we get it, its an exclusive. Im already listening to you album you won

**indie\_fan\_** (7): Now we're getting back on track after two iffy songs

**lady\_sable** (7): respectfully i am too much of a misandrist to fully appreciate this. still a bop tho

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): i thought the beat was fun or whatever that lady says

**cremeebrulee** (6.6): missy said yes i do the cooking yes i do the cleaning

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): the beat is kinda slightly annoying but it's still decent

**bornskinnyhomo** (6.5): It’s a good song, seems like it flies under the radar

# pause that beat

**akanewasright** (5.5): Okay we’re getting into the not great songs huh

**MrSwearword** (5): I'd complain about Missy saying THIS IS A MISSY ELLIOTT EXCLUSIVE by this point but then I remember Cool Off and Siri doing the job...anyway another great beat on a underwritten shitshow of a song.

**babadork** (4.5): The only thing that would make this relationship sound less appealing is if he also tasted like slaw.

I found this song kinda mid initially, and was kinda disappointed the collab between my two favs in the rate, but god this has grown on me to no end. They both do such a good job with their verses, and the end of Trina's first verse might be one of my favourite moments in the whole rate due to the lyrics and her performance of them, "shoes by jimmy choos and michael kors, fuck thelma and louise its trina and eve" is such a time capsule of when the song came out and i adore it for that

---

# feminists

**NotWith10000Men** (10): i am so predictable

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Kinda wish this was the final track because it really feels like the end credits to a nostalgic movie

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): "You thinkin' I'm a dime, but I'm a silver dollar" ok, this goes down as one of the best lines I've ever heard

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): Gangsta Bitches kinda washed

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): What is this? A crossover episode? I'm here for it.

**moonagenightmares** (8.2): eve’s verse my favorite even on a trina track

**cremeebrulee** (7.9): ayoooo

**nt96** (7.5): Queen Latifah outsold I'm afraid. Great effort though.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): woman behaving almost badly

# men <3

**seanderlust** (7.7): "After you listen to this one verse" - the verse needs to be really good for this line not to come off as corny but it was just okay

**iniekcja\_** (7): this kind of sounds like a video game song

**waluigiest** (7): even with an annoying beat and a bad hook, Trina sparkles.

**BaconShoes** (6.5): i was jammin but it could have been better

**celladonn** (6.5): Bit of an underwhelming collab

**ImADudeDuh** (6): ladies night outpeaked

**MrSwearword** (6): cute but boring

**RandomHypnotica** (5.2): when two queens try to maximise their joint slay… and this is the result...

**bornskinnyhomo** (5): Thought the collab would hit hard, since these two really delivered bangers, but I hate this beat.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): SAY IT EVE.

**indie\_fan\_** (4): ehh, I'm here for Eve's verse, but that's about all I can say

**voidofstars** (4): awful chorous

# mk how u gonna say this and still give it an EIGHT POINT FIVE

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): love eve but this collab... leaves a lot to be desired

I like what Missy was going for on this song and I understand why it works for some people but it feels like it toes the line of camp *so* unintentionally, with Missy sensually whispering pussy to the listener throughout the song. Missy not to put my individual needs above your happiness but pls get away from these men so you can be a bad bitch that is when you make your best music

---

# ayyyyyyy we want some pussy

**throwaway-7650** (10): ty missy (and george michael) for their sex education prequels

**waluigiest** (10): this song is so unassumingly beautiful - the harmonies, the production, her voice. It’s all there.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): Pussy don't fail me now is such an iconic line omfg

**BaconShoes** (9.5): i love this song lol. PUSSY DON’T FAIL ME NOW. The lil monologue at the end is so good too

**indie\_fan\_** (9): I should NOT have been listening to this song as a preteen. Missy always says that she can't sing, but while she may not be the most gifted vocalist out there per se, she's definitely the best singer out of the four rappers on this rate, which shines through on this track.

**ricki** (9): “pussy dont fail me now” isnt that how lana starts born to die?

**TiltControls** (9): :pussypray: for Missy

**seanderlust** (8.7): that outro 100% makes the song. the ending "oh nooo!" is so funny

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): wasn't expecting a slow jam but it's a nice surprise. Love her speech at the end

**2dina3dworld** (8): bussy don’t fail me now 😽✋

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This isn’t as sexy as I expected it to be but it’s a fun slow jam, and I love the lyrics. The spoken word at the end should have been a separate interlude but I do like what she’s saying at least.

**MrSwearword** (8): PUSSY DON'T FAIL ME NOW...I can't at Missy singing this with sincerity...and that certain rumor...anyway at least this song title spelled her collab with The Pussycat Dolls on Whatcha Think About That, so cool.

**nt96** (8): Missy made sure she had to instantly defend herself before we even got a chance to tank this.

**slimboyfriend** (8): I can’t tell if the verses are serious because the rest of the song is so funny…. Like “can I put my booty booty up in your spaghetti daddy?” And telling her genitalia to puss the fuck up?

**welcome2thejam** (8): WAP prequel

**bornskinnyhomo** (7.5): Super smooth

**lady\_sable** (7.5): concerned abt what spaghetti means in this context

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I was expecting a more threatening sound based on the title, not something this chill. I love the message of speaking outro. Way to go!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (7): queen of having to hype her pussy up before the big game

**iniekcja\_** (7): I love how she's just casually talking to her pussy

**MC\_Fuzzy** (7): Would’ve been great to here Janet Jackson on the beat . . . Besides that, I’ve been trying to speak about how Missy and other lady MCs were talking about sex in a vulgar way for years.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): "can I put this booty, booty in your spaghetti" ...help

**Uberpigeon** (7): mushy

**vayyiqra** (7): I wasn't that into this but the monologue at the end is pretty based so I had to raise my score a bit for that.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): cute song but i’m surprised this one was one of the singles given how much slower and more chill it is while still being… hard to censor for radio

**bigbigbee** (6.5): This score is a full point higher because of that outro – I love the humor, and she is right!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i was gonna complain about the ted talk but honestly these ladies really were the blueprint for sex positive women in the main stream so you know what! Go for it!

**frogaranaman** (6): love how horny this album is

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): even the image of "booty in spaghetti" doesn't quite ruin this song for me

**NotWith10000Men** (5.9): pussy don't fail me now OH MY GOD

# dog ppl

**akanewasright** (6.6): honestly this is just kinda okay but I love her speeches

**plastichaxan** (6): the best part of this being her speaking at the end plss

**cremeebrulee** (5): i feel like a pussycat doll i don’t answer when he call

**celladonn** (4.5): This is a pretty unsexy slowjam

**fadedblue09** (4): Too on the nose for me, and honestly a little boring

Kim is so goofy for this entire album tbh, but I'm especially obsessed w the way she sets up narratives on tracks to never return to them. Also very surprised this got as far as it did, I think because the people who like it like it a lot, and the people who don't sort of just... don't know what to think.

---

# abmfab (all bad male features are bastards)

**CrimsonROSET** (10): we love a narrative queen

**lady\_sable** (10): kim says acab

**MrSwearword** (10): wow what an opener.

**plastichaxan** (10): this is such a good opener wtf

**throwaway-7650** (10): the skit... it'z camp tbh

**thedoctordances1940** (9.6): yeah wow, I love this concept. The beat kinda drones on but that's also kinda what I love about it and it really sets the tone for the track perfectly.

**bbfan132** (9): this is a really good opener for an album lmao, this drew me in right away

**indie\_fan\_** (9): Strong as Hell Intro, Kim's storytelling is solid as well.

**iniekcja\_** (9): hate the hook but this is an experience

**NotWith10000Men** (9): "lil kim is a threat to society" "i may be hard core but i'm not jeffrey dahmer" dying

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): Not Guilty

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): she did nothing wrong

**TiltControls** (8.5): what a twist

**bornskinnyhomo** (8): Certainly a statement!

**celladonn** (8): This is a pretty cool and atmospheric opener

**IIIHenryIII** (8): Come, they told me pa-rum pum pum pum

**BaconShoes** (7.5): your honor lil kim is a threat to society

**seanderlust** (7.5): WHERE is their oscar

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I love her voice. Her flow is so good too.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): bruh I thought my headphones broke… cool idea for an intro to the album but it feels like a song in a musical that’s used to set up for an even bigger song but then we never get the payoff

**ImADudeDuh** (7): why was there a 30 second intro of silence

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): all these albums have good intros

**slimboyfriend** (7): omg it's cee-lo like the one of the green variety

**voidofstars** (7): “i’m the 1st female king” pretty much sums my good sis kimberly up!

**babadork** (6.8): There’s some good stuff here, especially in Lil’ Kim’s verse, but this doesn’t come together. I blame Redman and Angela Bobbett.

**1998tweety** (6.5): the long empty intro had me not sure if I had the song muted or not

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): i feel like i should like this bc its a concept song and that’s cool, but idk it just didn’t grab me

**ricki** (5.5): i appreciate the theatrics but i didnt care for this

**vayyiqra** (5): Feel kind of bad giving this a mid score because I know it's trying to make a point about her reputation and talks about police brutality but I don't like the song itself that much.

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): confused about every creative decision here

**akanewasright** (4): …So Kim is solid here, as usual, but this feels like a weird opener, weirdly dark subject matter, and just… I don’t think I like this at all

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): This is saved by Redman being pretty good here. But I don’t really like this skit/song/opener. It’s very clunky and the acting is pretty bad

# ppl made so many different references for this one

**2dina3dworld** (8.9): How much Ace Attorney do you think Lil Kim has played?

**you2009** (8): I love legally blonde

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): i just killed 6 cops now i’m horny

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): the male feature served for once

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): This is sooo good. I'm sorry but the guy's verse is so... no.

**1998tweety** (7.5): ended Rita Ora

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): how exactly are malaysians slick, good sir?

**seanderlust** (7.4): fabolous sounds so good on this beat

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): So not only is Fabolous a man, he’s straight? Um…

**MrSwearword** (7): who the fuck orders wine at a club...anyway the beat knocks but this leaves something to be desired.

**BaconShoes** (6): it’s decent

**thedoctordances1940** (5.9): idk i don't really like this beat that much and the constant heys

**bornskinnyhomo** (5): Not very memorable, but not bad either

**fadedblue09** (5): Kinda unmemorable

**akanewasright** (4): I don’t love this chorus or beat, but Trina kinda doesn’t miss on her verses… it’s just the eternal question of “why would I listen to this when B R Right/I Need/Pull Over exist?”

**indie\_fan\_** (3.2): just a filler track for me

this bitch rly sampled the conga huh

# ayyyy we want some money

**fadedblue09** (11): Love everything about this: the lyrics, the delivery, the sample. Definitely the track i keep coming back to in the entire rate

**2dina3dworld** (10): cmon shake your body baby do the conga know that Trina’s gonna show you how to get this money

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): You heard the woman, this is a royal edict I guess. The piano really elevates this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): I’m obsessed with the use of this Gloria Estefan sample

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): "best believe I'm going diamond on my next LP" ...well...

**you2009** (9.5): kinda the best interpolation ever thank U katrina estefan

**seanderlust** (9.2): "Miami hot, 'Candy' flopped" - not trina coming for mandy moore

**CrimsonROSET** (9): *tinashe gif* THE CONGA?

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): The sample... please. It's so good.

**1998tweety** (8.5): me when I get a job

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I think this might be my favorite, it feels like one of those songs that progressively get better the more you listen to

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): the fucking sample i- i guess i gotta respect it

**BeauMeringue212** (8): the best (only decent) Latin influence song on the rate tbh

**iniekcja\_** (8): fun

**MrSwearword** (8): an interesting twist with the melody to Gloria Estefan's "Conga".

**welcome2thejam** (8): Not loving them leaning so hard on Conga, but this is a Trina hard carry, she's got a killer flow here

**bbfan132** (7.5): fun although the hook isn’t the best

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): finally some good fucking food again. this song really is needed after a stretch of kinda mid songs

**bornskinnyhomo** (7): It’s a fun rap, and the hook is very enjoyable

**indie\_fan\_** (7): That Conga Sample is what really sells this song

# broke bitches

**waluigiest** (7): the interpolation just makes it a cheap version of Conga by Gloria Estefan

**akanewasright** (6.5): I can’t decide if this sample is camp (complimentary) or camp (derogatory)

**TiltControls** (6.5): Trina this sounds like you're trying to get me to join a MLM (and cause it's this sub - no, not the gay kind)

**celladonn** (6): Gloria Estefan outsold

**BaconShoes** (5): wasn’t crazy about this one but it was okay

**plastichaxan** (5): i'm sorry i can't with the conga sample

**TragicKingdom1** (5): this is tacky sorry

**voidofstars** (5): it feels like its missing something

**babadork** (4): Miami Sound Machine has had enough members that they could have gotten one to make this sound less basic.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this sample doesn’t work

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): cute but goes on too long

**moonagenightmares** (3.7): so boring it felt twice as long

Beyoncé PLEASE what is this, the only thing keeping this score as high as it is is their riffs and vocals, bc the lyrics in these verses are *so* clunky it actually sends me. Oh also Bey's delivery of "Girl I do not get high" also keeps this score from bombing because that is brilliant sjdjs

# beYONCE? BEYONCE??

**ImADudeDuh** (10): you know this is a pre-crazy in love song cause she still uses her last name here

**throwaway-7650** (10): ! predicted lemonade !

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Me when deciding if I wanna leave my room just to get snacks when we have company over.

**waluigiest** (10): putting this a few minutes after a Jay-Z feature is so fucking funny

**you2009** (9.8): missy interviewing the dean of bird school

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): this was the original telephone

**1998tweety** (9): Beyoncé???

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I really miss the early “girl next door cum independent diva who still loves her man” phase of Beyoncé’s career, and her and Missy work really well together. This feels more like Beyoncé’s song than Missy’s but like… when you get Beyoncé on the track that makes sense.

**nt96** (9): I can't help but feel like this was originally written for Aaliyah. The soft vocal runs sound like something she would do.

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): LL cool j wanna be is killing me

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Beyoncé sounds like she’s doing an impression of herself from the early 2000s with her little spoken words

**TiltControls** (8.5): me when its too cold outside and i've got places to be

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this song is kinda gay tbh

**bornskinnyhomo** (7.5): Beyonce? Beyonce????

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): this is a tad overhated, but also maybe its not as bad as i thought to remove features from artist averages so this doesn’t hurt bey too much

**BeauMeringue212** (7): Not Missy calling Jay a broke down LL Cool J wannabe lol

**voidofstars** (7): love the back and forth between them

**2dina3dworld** (6): what’s this Beyoncé girl doing nowadays?

**CrimsonROSET** (6): not me thinking the beyonce song is the most boring on the album people get arrested in some countries for this

**indie\_fan\_** (6): By itself it's not a bad track, but I always felt it sounded off in context with the rest of the album.

**vayyiqra** (6): The features on this album are stacked, it's astonishing.

**BaconShoes** (5): not my fave but not bad

**fadedblue09** (5): Sounds awkward and half baked

**IIIHenryIII** (5): nothing here for me

**iniekcja\_** (5): I don't think i like it

**plastichaxan** (5): this could’ve been such a jointslay it’s sad

**babadork** (4.4): Unfortunately, this comes after Pussycat, so I am already skeptical about this guy. At best, I think it’s boring.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3.5): filler but bey ate as usual

# beyonce PLEASE this is so embarazzing

**ricki** (8): beyoncé! beyoncé omg get up you’re embarrasing us

**seanderlust** (8): beyonce sweetie that sounds like a bad relationship

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.6): when you look at it through the lens of the Covid-19 pandemic, Missy is a superspreader and Beyoncé is the voice of reason actually

**MrSwearword** (5): Beyonce sounds great but basically this song is the reason Keyshia Cole's "Let It Go" exists. I mean thanks but I can listen to that when I want.

**moonagenightmares** (2): always choose your girls over a man

**cremeebrulee** (1): if i am ever down this bad, please take a baseball bat to my head

Idc idc Drag-On has the f slur pass bc this verse is so good idc

---

# oh i guess straight men using the f slur to refer to effeminate men is "bad" and "homophobic" and not a "yass moment" i see how it is

**CrimsonROSET** (10): like at first i had knocked down a point for the slur but like… i can’t deny this is fucking amazing

**fadedblue09** (10): Oh I definitely recall this one a lot.

**indie\_fan\_** (10): Swizz knew damn well what he was doing when he produced this one. I honestly have no major qualms about this track. While neither rapper is trying to blow my mind in terms of RAPPING RAPPING for this song, their flows go so damn well with Swizz's beats.

**iniekcja\_** (10): I'm a sucker for any track where rappers exchange lines on a verse

**skargardin** (10): this chorus bops SO hard

**cremeebrulee** (9.9): a 10 in theory

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): this is catchy enough to look past the f slur lol

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): she kind of got eaten up by the man

**akanewasright** (9): The way this is one of the most fun songs in the rate and then there’s the slur…

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): my god she has just not missed once

**plastichaxan** (9): me in the middle of the song: is this one of the songs that says the f- oh it is

**bbfan132** (8.5): did i hear the f slur? :grinny: i liked this besides that

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): oh shit, I know this one

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): this beat is so perfect for Eve’s voice, I love how she sounds over the piano (the guest verse… i do not perceive it)

**frogaranaman** (8): gonna headcannon Drag-On is fruity based off the name so I can give this song a good score

**lady\_sable** (8): another banger--wait did that guy just drop the f slur

**NotWith10000Men** (8): man this old shit slaps

**welcome2thejam** (8): Is that a submarine in the background?

**you2009** (7.8): [fiona apple voice] ladies ladies ladiessss

**celladonn** (7.5): This beat is so fun, shame about the slur!

**1998tweety** (7): minus 1 point for the f-slur

**Uberpigeon** (7): ladies ladies ladies ladies take it easy

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): it bops a bit, but… how are you gonna be homophobic with a name like Drag-On??!?!

**seanderlust** (6.5): mid-00s male rappers stop using the f-slur challenge. anyways shout out to swizz beats for a killer beat

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): oh not the f slurs

**DaHumanTorch** (6): ...did he say fa-

**MC\_Fuzzy** (6): the chorus. . . The chorus

**TiltControls** (6): I need to be able to give 2 11s in rates. Have you got any of that?

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6): Did this man just say.... yeah I'm docking points for that.

**MrSwearword** (5): Swizz was annoying and then whatever a Drag-On is saying the f-slur...bye gurl we ain't need you. Production does knock though.

**ricki** (5): LIKE A STICKEEEEER!!!!!

**babadork** (4.3): It is very generous of her to put a Drag-On song on her album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): unfortunately not good enough for me to overlook the f-slur

**ImADudeDuh** (4): guys, it’s obvious Drag-On just said “vegas” but they have enunciation problems

**voidofstars** (4): i wanna fight swiss for this beat omg

**Stryxen** (3.8): oh the last 30 seconds are laced but the rest is just eh and also its homophobic but whatever

**letsallpoo** (3): uh oh he said the word

**bornskinnyhomo** (1): Not interested in f-slur drops

these three together on a track should be like *incredible*, but i dont think thats necessarily what they were going for. they clearly went for a very grand idea of this song about gang violence and its very narrative based, which i respect, but i do kinda think it doesnt quite live up to what they could've done with it, especially with how good they all are over more fun beats.

---

# darj pleek dont retire the women of alt dance idea :'(((

**2dina3dworld** (10): okay this hook goes off. Also did she reference Mother Courage in this or am I losing it

**nt96** (10): It's a 10 cuz of Grace Jones. Give her a rate of her own so Darj can die happy.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this track is a masterpiece of storytelling, the production and Grace Jones’s powerful voice add to the foreboding vibe, and it had some great comic relief lines as well. True cinematic energy.

**Stryxen** (10): love this song there’s so much going on but it all comes together and constantly builds in intensity and its tied together entirely by kim’s very serious and convincing delivery - like in the last verse where she goes like he WON’t fall over! I just think it’s neat

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): LIL KIM LESBIAN ALLY?!

**babadork** (9.3): Whoever came up with the idea of having Grace Jones sing the hook for a Lil’ Kim song is a genius.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Grace Jones makes everything better

**lady\_sable** (9): grace jones my beloved

**indie\_fan\_** (8.8): One of Kim's best story telling songs post-lyrical prime.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): The production is good. She's really good at storytelling.

**throwaway-7650** (8): the way I'm having snapple rn

**vayyiqra** (8): The premise of this song confuses me but it sounds cool as hell whatever they're doing with all these guns

**welcome2thejam** (8): A Snapple!?

**BaconShoes** (7.5): getting the legendary Grace Jones on the track yas

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): why does it sound like Grace Jones’ voice is being played in reverse?

**1998tweety** (7): Grace ate

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I like what's happening in the background

**MrSwearword** (7): mainly for the ambition and GRACE JONES on this track.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): the beat has some interesting ideas but overall eh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.7): I wish I liked this song that features GRACE JONES more. I think it’s just alright

**moonagenightmares** (6.7): men always ruining women’s songs fr

**ricki** (6.5): lizette isnt shit fr

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): well grace jones sounds good on it at least

**plastichaxan** (6): this had so much potential but i sleep EDIT: okay the song improved since the shots

# A SNAPPLE???????

**RandomHypnotica** (10): snapple really? Product Placement is so obvious these days smh  🙄

**seanderlust** (10): S-W nine millimeter, check. Long-nose double barreled rifle, check. Snapple, check.

**celladonn** (8.5): "I'll be down in a minute, I'm drinking a Snapple" lol

kim invented feminism AND racism on one song she is a revolutionary

---

# cock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**voidofstars** (11): she went so HARD on this its crazy, her mind is so powerful

**2dina3dworld** (10): me having an imaginary argument in the shower

**bigbigbee** (10): I don’t have time to explain this sentence, but I believe that this song is on the right side of gender theory

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): so true queen

**MrSwearword** (10): "ALL I WANNA DO IS GET MY PUSSY SUCKED, COUNT A MILLION BUCKS IN THE BACK OF AN ARMORED TRUCK" Lil Kim is a poet.

**throwaway-7650** (10): "I peeled the Benji's off" did it hurt/you enjoy? u/Uberpigeon

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Umm... No thanks, but I... appreciate the offer I guess?

**you2009** (10): bell hooks we real cool

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.7): proto-Can’t Hold Us Down

**seanderlust** (9.7): I know there's a lot of thinkpieces about lil kim as B.I.G.'s protege (and he's literally sampled elsewhere on the album) but I really feel like her flow here is where I can hear him most on this album

**BaconShoes** (9): she spilled here

**bornskinnyhomo** (9): Holy shit, does this woman miss?

**IIIHenryIII** (9): dope chorus

**lady\_sable** (9): suck her dick sunday

**TiltControls** (9): i love thinking of you by kesha

**cremeebrulee** (8.7): he sucked the WHAT out of your pussy

**babadork** (8.6): The third verse is a little weaker than the other two, but she saves it with that interpolation of “Bitches Ain’t Shit,” which is one of the best parts of the song.

**akanewasright** (8.5): OWN HIS ASS KIM!!!

**BeauMeringue212** (8.3): Don't let the power bottoms find this song

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): im sad this is good cause I wanted to give it a 6.9 for the joke

**buddhacharm** (8): me rapping the chorus out loud to myself and my housemates genuinely thinking I'm deranged

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i won’t

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I kind of stan this argument

**fadedblue09** (8): Lives up to the explicitness of its title

**iniekcja\_** (8): jumping up and up seems appropriate

**nt96** (8): Finally, a perfect song for the church picnic.

**skargardin** (8): The On & On interpolation was pretty clever

**Stryxen** (8): the on & on sample line yass do the neo soul rate 11 months ago

**slimboyfriend** (7): the ingenuity of her to rhyme bitch with bitch, bitch and dick in the chorus

**ricki** (6.5): girl what the fuck is this chorus

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): taylor, take notes from Kim next time you try and make a song like The Man

**1998tweety** (6): ok

**thedoctordances1940** (5.6): yeah idk this just does nothing for me and also idk why some of her vocals just seem to be mixed really quietly at times in the chorus

**plastichaxan** (5): the worst song about sucking the dick of one of the girls in the rate

**indie\_fan\_** (3): Runs too long, production is too stripped down (especially here when she definitely needs to rely on the production). I like some of the wordplay she has here, but that's about it

# honestly yeah racism is bad

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): sorry but racism against Asian people is an instant turnoff for me

**vayyiqra** (0): These lyrics are certainly something. I have nothing against raunchy lyrics, I like lots of songs with them, but we could've most likely done without the line about piss. As well some of the more aggressive parts got uncomfortable. Idk, I'm not big on this song. Update: Ghost brought up the racist origin of the "love you long time" line which I noticed as well and thought was suss, and then this description: "Lil Kim makes you lick up her pussy whether you like it or not" yeah that's no good. This song is making me think of "Did It On 'Em", which I gave a 1, so that is not a good sign. The more I think about it and the more I read them, the worse these lyrics are. Musically this is okay, but lyrically this is awful. I'm going to go ahead and 0 it.

**waluigiest** (0): I’m trying to get into it but I just can’t. The flow feels lazy, the writing is rarely good, the beat gets in the way of the track. It feels like it relies on shock value instead of good bars.

I've joked before about Missy's spoken word interludes being better than her songs on this album and that is obviously hyperbolic but here I actually kinda feel it jsdjs. My favourite part musically is actually the "hard-working,, the *star* of the show" intro to the song part, I always get that stuck in my head. But unfortunately aside from that it is kind of a middling track to me.

---

# i was going to play unfoolish by ashanti as the interlude for this but forgor and decided on my 11 for all stars instead <3 ly akane and darj hope the reveal is going well

**fadedblue09** (10): The Ashanti shoutout alone is enough to tell me what year this album was released

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Honestly, this whole song is so good, even including the intro. I’ve heard the album earlier this year and this was one of my faves from it. This was close to being my 11

**nt96** (10): These interludes serve as perfect time capsules as it nicely captures where she was in life as well as the country's status in the beginning of a post 9/11 society.

**seanderlust** (10): missy comparing herself to don king...we have no choice but to stan

**bbfan132** (9.5): this intro is fun!!! enjoyed this quite a bit

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Far be it from me to silence a woman but bitch, please stop talking and play the music! Love the Ashanti shoutout.

**Stryxen** (9): the call and response in the chorus is so fun and spoken directly from the pussy

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): really good opener

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the tittygif-ication begins

**indie\_fan\_** (8): Her flow is dope as hell on this track during the verses and compliments tim's beat really well, but I always felt that the chorus was a bit empty or uneventful

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): great intro

**plastichaxan** (8): i came to shake my booty down to the rate

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): i can’t believe missy invented time travel so she can do a callback to on & on here

**akanewasright** (7.5): We’re not rating the spoken intro but like… Missy is so smart, so kind, and so well spoken, I have to give credit for that. This isn’t the best on the album, but it’s still got everything that makes Missy such an engaging presence

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Her flow is so good. I like the lyrics too.

**BaconShoes** (7): not a collapse or anything, but a good introduction to the album

**IIIHenryIII** (7): this definitely is a Missy Elliott album

**slimboyfriend** (7): Aaliyah would’ve wanted us to throw some ass in the club :,(

**welcome2thejam** (7): This is how I'm finding out that part of one of my favorite songs - Childish Gambino's Algorhythm - has its big hook ("Everybody move your body / now do it / here is something that's gonna make you move and groove") interpolated from another song altogether (Zhané - Hey Mr. D.J.)

**MC\_Fuzzy** (6.5): I listened to the “Intro” in addition to this. Weird to here what the current(ish) events were in 2002, damn twenty years ago.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): plain ole haters and bullshit

**bornskinnyhomo** (6): It’s pretty good, but didn’t immediately capture me.

**TiltControls** (6): even Missy thinks we should rate ashanti soon

**2dina3dworld** (5): now why’s she starting this album like she’s presenting a very special episode of Clone High

**celladonn** (3): The Ming Lee line... the "I got so high I looked Asian 🤪" joke has absolutely never been funny

# trump jumpscare call that a trumpscare

**throwaway-7650** (10): "you don't see [gates] and [trump] arguing with each other" she really picked the 2 polar opposite ends of the rich, white, american men

**lady\_sable** (8): bop but the trump reference in the intro gave me whiplash

**waluigiest** (8): the Trump/Gates line…. 😳

**letsallpoo** (7): "you dont see bill gates and donald trump arguing with each other" oh honey you got a big storm coming

**MrSwearword** (7): the intro is hilarious aside from the mention of Orange Foolius, but as for the song...it's cute but as an opener without the intro is a chop.

**ricki** (7): we got a donald trump name drop before we got any music

# 27

**fadedblue09** (10): I feel like this is where the album actually begins

**babadork** (8.7): I like when Kim shows her more playful side in her disses.

**bbfan132** (7.5): not this song [infinity]

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): the answer? not nicki until she collaborated with 69

# hahahahahahahhahahahhahahahahahhahahahahh get the joke

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): this probably isn’t

**celladonn** (8): Great collab, even though the whistle noise in the instrumental grates on me a little

**Stryxen** (8): wait the intro is so so bad and then the rest just devoured the rest of the album lol

**babadork** (7.8): As much as I enjoy Da Brat and Trina, I am not sure about gangsta purses.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): bop (though another round of a great set of verses and a meh chorus) but we also need to rate Eve’s Gangsta Lovin at some point too

**1998tweety** (7): Saweetie & Doja Cat - Best Friend vibes

**bigbigbee** (7): I really love the way they play with rhythm in this song

**bornskinnyhomo** (7): It’s a fun song, bumped up by the outro

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i’m so gangsta i’m so thug

**indie\_fan\_** (7): and we're back with the choruses being lackluster and repetitive. Again damn shame considering All three women kill it on the verses. Da Brat has always been a dope rapper and this production suits her well.

**MrSwearword** (7): at least it's three female MCs working a song together but this song needed to go gangbusters to really work. But hey Da Brat! Hey Trina in the early aughts, love you.

**ricki** (6): the chorus is awful

**slimboyfriend** (6): how do u think a diamond thong would feel in ur crack

**waluigiest** (6): I actually like the beat and the verses but the chorus is SO obnoxious

**welcome2thejam** (6): The beat's letting them down, makes it much more of a slog to get through than it should've been

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): As a gay man seeing this many female rappers on the track should be teleporting me to mars but this is just kinda middling. None of them really stand out from the others and they repeat the word “gangster” so much that it just loses all of its meaning.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): too much gangsta

**ImADudeDuh** (5): why does the chorus lowkey feel off beat and why did Eve remind me of “you just lost the game”

**fadedblue09** (2.5): Now this one is just irritating

# this is cute

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): when three girlbosses maximise their joint triple slay

**plastichaxan** (6): they did not maximize their joint slay

Unfortunately I fear if this song didn't have Method Man it would be even lower, I just find the melody to be too repetitive and I prefer Missy when she's a bad bitch than when she's in love!! What can I say

---

# no pain no game

**indie\_fan\_** (11): One of my favorite Missy Deep Cuts. I honestly could've seen this being a promo single during its time. And Once again, Tim kills it with the production. Again, also biased because I'm a big fan of Method Man's flow most of the time.

**seanderlust** (10): opening this banger with a public enemy sample? chef's kiss

**welcome2thejam** (10): Nasty beat but saying the word "nookie" gives me Limp Bizkit PTSD

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): BOP!!!!!!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): Great sample and great energy between Missy and Method Man

**you2009** (9): one of the most sickening samples of this bunch

**BaconShoes** (8.5): a total vibe yas

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): S P E L L I N G (and counting) I S F U N

**CrimsonROSET** (8): spelling IS fun

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): listening to classic rap is so funny because you’re like “oh I know this guy from movies.” love the instrumental to this one but Missy’s weakness as a singer holds it back a bit

**MrSwearword** (8): oh cute a reworking of a Method Man classic [shout out to DEF JAM VENDETTA]. It's not Method good but it's nice.

**plastichaxan** (8): me when i can finally accept that my favorite songs will be tanked in all stars 5 rate

**voidofstars** (8): kinda sexy!

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): vote for crunk (just like a party) rate!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Method Man's verse is just....

**MC\_Fuzzy** (7): Would’ve loved more Wu-Tang on this beat

**vayyiqra** (7): cool sample

**babadork** (6.7): I know he’s here because it was originally his song, but I don’t know that Method Man is adding anything.

**bornskinnyhomo** (6.5): I like the vibes.

# no game no pain ? idk anymore

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): for a split second at the start of the track, I really thought the counting would just never end

**IIIHenryIII** (6): you didn't have to be so literal with your song title, Miss! Listening to it really did bring me a bit of pain

**moonagenightmares** (1): oh god that beat was so annoying

I hate this. I really do not like the instrumental, it feels like a weird attempt at an industrial beat but it just sounds clunky, like a lot of the noises in the back of the track catch me and im like "i did not want to zone in on that", and I find the hook kinda grating too. Like if you like this great but the fact that it almost beat some of these very good songs coming up makes me want to crawl into a hole and I will be listening to this song in the reveal muted <3

> akane's note: he really didn't show up to day 2 so he wouldn't have to hear this, I'm yelling

# weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

**bigbigbee** (10): This is SO hypnotic and cool. Every time I listened to it in my final scoring, I raised it a half point until it got here

**cremeebrulee** (10): flabster

**iniekcja\_** (10): how many exclusives does she have

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): okay now THIS is how you make a beat

**NotWith10000Men** (10): there's some incredible backing tracks on this album damn. your chain platinum... or is it really sterling? much to think about

**throwaway-7650** (10): an unironic 11 contender! fuck you u/Awkward_King for hating this

**seanderlust** (9.5): "My twinkies look stinky on the Benz" missy said rights for gays with poor hygiene

**1998tweety** (9): groovy

**bornskinnyhomo** (9): My favorite hip-hop comes with a dirty beat

**TiltControls** (9): when someone asks me to describe my favourite mario 64 secret level

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.8): this beat is INCREDIBLE, what??? This is why Missy and Timbaland get so much love for their production!!!

**TragicKingdom1** (8): honestly the best production on the album, but its held down by the underdeveloped hook

**BaconShoes** (7.5): This beat slaps

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I like the verses, but the hook is kinda meh.

**akanewasright** (7): this is lower energy work it flow wise, but I like work it so I’m cool with it

**CrimsonROSET** (7): do the hokey pokey

**frogaranaman** (6): didn't realize we were rating Calvin Harris

**voidofstars** (6): sounds like the FUTURE

# got stuck halfway down

**IIIHenryIII** (6): "Don't it sound so fantastic?" No, it doesn't. It sounds decent at best.

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Work It with less the charm

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This is breaking the streak of good scores for Missy I fear, it’s just kinda ugly sounding

**ImADudeDuh** (5): yeah calvin harris frank ocean and migos ended this

**indie\_fan\_** (5): ehh, her flow's not bad, but not one of Tim's best production moments for me.

**MrSwearword** (5): great beat, bad song. You say slide, I say DIP.

**waluigiest** (5): compared to the rest of the album the bars here are weeeak

I'm not being hyperbolic when I say this is one of the most brilliant songs I have ever heard, like it's fucking *infectious*, the production is brilliant and I could listen to this 1000000 times and never tire of it, such a banger. And how the FUCK IS IT OUT DAY 2

---

# these people r really pretty

**buddhacharm** (11): this album is very hit for miss but this one literally has me [like](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/880223648181542952.gif)

**CrimsonROSET** (11): maybe i will!

**fadedblue09** (10): Oh this is a banger

**TiltControls** (10): omfg I love this

**waluigiest** (10): when I tell you my jaw hit the floor…. This is CRISP. Beat goes mad, there are countless excellent one liners. A jewel on this album for sure.

**you2009** (9.5): very silly beat

**akanewasright** (9): this fucks but I’m docking a point for the ableist slur 💀

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): I love this production! The feature is actually really good!

**BaconShoes** (8): i like the beat a lot, it’s a bop

**bornskinnyhomo** (8): An amazing collab, I swear Lil’ Kim does not miss

**IIIHenryIII** (7): kinda good

# you insult this song? this song raised me. this song was the mother i never had, the friend everybody needs, this song held me til my dying breath and wept at my funeral.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): oh no it’s sampling a song I had to hear a lot at work on the Pandora oh god oh fuck

**NotWith10000Men** (6.9): it's certainly weird

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): the third verse really saves/elevates this

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Going into this Lil Kim album I didn’t expect to hear her rap over an avant-garde 80s synthpop song by Art of Noise.

**MrSwearword** (6): at least the production is as bold as it can get for a not single on a Lil Kim album.

**vayyiqra** (6): Art of Noise ???

**indie\_fan\_** (5): Not Bad but Not Good

**voidofstars** (4): its cute

# special place in hell

**babadork** (3.5): I didn’t start actively disliking this song until a few days before I turned in my ballot.

# girl there ain't no "i" in team

**seanderlust** (10): the biggie sample on the hook is killer. also shoutout to the synths in the background

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9.5): I love the lyrics. Her flow is sooo good!

**akanewasright** (9): I always forget I really like this song lol

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i mean she is the moment, come on  now

**TiltControls** (8.5): oh no she cut the spelling is fun line

**thedoctordances1940** (8.1): really just a great beat

**BaconShoes** (8): i like the beat a lot, a jam

**bornskinnyhomo** (8): Loved the flow

**MrSwearword** (8): the Kimmy Blanco persona is cute but the chorus almost feels a touch forced.

**welcome2thejam** (8): "Live from NYC, it's QB" For almost the entire album I thought QB stood for quarterback. There is literally a song called Queen Bitch and multiple uses of Queen Bee and I still thought she was just a big NFL fan

**babadork** (7.8): This is my favorite Biggie reference on the album. It feels more reciprocated than the others, because she’s sampling a song that had already sampled on of her songs.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): banger

**voidofstars** (7): runway banger

This switchup halfway through the song before Ms. Jade's verse is one of my favourite spots of Missy/Timbo production on this album, bc it compliments the change in MC really nicely while also being rly interesting sonically. Kind of robbed of day 3 I fear.

---

# well dressed

**lady\_sable** (10): ok i'll turn the volume up

**bbfan132** (9.5): :listening: this is really good

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): A part of this song always came in the middle of the Gossip Folks music video so I think I just have to love it, tbh!!!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): Wait, this is so good! This has no right to be as good as it is.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Oh this definitely rings a bell for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): my sister had surgery recently because she was having painful periods and it turns out she had a cyst… she’s fine now… sorry I’m doing these scores last minute so I don’t know what to say

**akanewasright** (8): we love MC Lyte [2] (but slightly less this time bc this song is slightly less good)

**indie\_fan\_** (8): Again, one where Missy's flow really shines through. Imo, Missy's not the best RAPPER RAPPER on the block in terms of lyrical ability. However, she definitely makes up for her attention grabbing voice as well as her flow with songs like this. Although, Ms. Jades verse on the album version always felt tacked on to me

**slimboyfriend** (8): I was so happy that I got Ms. Jade’s Beastie Boys reference because I’m usually too dumb to pick up on anything without reading the genius lyrics first

**welcome2thejam** (8): "Please do not try to fuck with this young duck" - Ms. Jade predicting Untitled Goose Game 17 years in advance

**throwaway-7650** (7.7): bonus points for the curry line 😋

**you2009** (7.5): ms. jade slid

**1998tweety** (7): Jade Jolie?????

**iniekcja\_** (7): how I feel in a crammed bus desperately trying to survive and make it to a party

**voidofstars** (7): i see how this one influenced some of the new girls

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): “my speech is very slurry” idk i think that’s more Drag-On on the Eve album

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): idk who ms jade is but she ate here

**bornskinnyhomo** (5): This one didn’t make much of an impression, but was catchy

# floppy flop dressed

**BaconShoes** (6.5): nothing amazing but a bop

**IIIHenryIII** (6): sorry, I'm turning the volume down

**MrSwearword** (6): a "Misdemeanor" exclusive wow...the production knocks but this lacks anything substantial.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.7): Most of this track is good, but the weird reversed drum sample bit is not good

**CrimsonROSET** (5): bestie what are you a salad

# ty i will be doing this!

**babadork** (10): Since Ms. Jade’s verse is the best part, I want to take this opportunity to recommend checking out her album, “Girl Interrupted,” if you’re looking to listen to more female rappers from the 2000s.

Thank y'all so much for coming today and sticking through some technical issues ~~including me doing this from a Dunkin Donuts after my uni's wifi went out~~. I have NO idea what's happening tomorrow, and maybe that's a good thing for my sanity! But I'm excited for what will happen!

See you at 3PM EST again tomorrow!!
