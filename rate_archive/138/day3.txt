I do not think this song is perfect at all but the sheer gall and ability to sample Heartbreaker and have it come out actually sounding good is insane and Kanye was on the top of his game here.

---

# woah i just realised all kanye songs made day 3 :yass:

**you2009** (11): anybody can relate

**akanewasright** (10): GOD I love this song. First of all - this is a brilliantly used sample, early Kanye was a GOD with this stuff. But more importantly… I mean I think this song is *brilliant* lyrically, I love how she tears into this ex ~~who is probably biggie~~ for being manipulative and abusive to her - things she wouldn’t directly admit to about this relationship until the 10’s. I truly don’t think I can rave about it enough, and it kills me a little to not 11 it

**buddhacharm** (10): JAN LOST TO SILKY! ENOUGH!!!

**lady\_sable** (10): she is coming for this man's ENTIRE life. also fantastic use of that sample

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): when I give this a high score, I’m ignoring the skit at the end

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): I really like this one! Her voice is soo good.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): there's some fantastic samples on this album

**celladonn** (9): This slaaaps, that shouldn't work but it does, and I love the rock influence in the sound

**CrimsonROSET** (9): love that sample

**ImADudeDuh** (9): the samples on this album are fucking wild

**indie\_fan\_** (9): Her aggressiveness and confidence is really what sells this song. I think when Kim is at her most abrasive is when she's at her best

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): this sample...chef's kiss

**ricki** (9): im nosy i love to gossip

**babadork** (8.5): The sample is somehow so annoying that it becomes good.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I like how she references the song she’s sampling, I don’t feel like I hear that very often. The skit at the end is a choice though

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): a guitar moment? yes please

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): i’m pretending the skit at the end doesn’t exist bc the rest is so good

**1998tweety** (8): NOT THE HEARTBREAKER SAMPLE

**skargardin** (8): this heartbreaker sample.. :listening:

**Stryxen** (8): kinda just did not end but i really liked the outro skit lol

**voidofstars** (8): this song feels like a lifetime movie in a fun way… the skit at the end makes me laugh every time

**waluigiest** (8): sample goes kinda crazy ngl

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): the reference to Big Yellow Taxi ASDFghjkl

**bornskinnyhomo** (7.5): The rock influences from Pat Benatar, with the flow, great

**welcome2thejam** (7): "I don't care for skits on albums" Lil Kim shoots a man in the ass "I care for one skit on an album"

**MrSwearword** (6): if only because the sample source took me for a surprise.

**vayyiqra** (6): "Heartbreaker"? What? A very weird sample, but it kind of works. That skit at the end was odd though.

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): the interpolation is nice, but that's about it

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): the vocals in the chorus are so annoying/off-putting

# wtf this song invented sampling

**BaconShoes** (7): not crazy about the production and sample but she is spitting here

**plastichaxan** (6.8): this has interesting ideas but i can’t fully enjoy cause of the sample :sob:

**fadedblue09** (6): verses go off but idk how to feel about the Pat Benatar sample

**RandomHypnotica** (5.1): I see what they were going for… but that sample just did not work

**hikkaru** (4): kinda weird sample lol

I promise I am not a Missy anti this is just far from my favourite era of her work. Trina is kinda the saving grace of this song for me, I find the chorus quite annoying, Missy's really abrasive on it and it feels like she's going for too many memorable moments rather than making a cohesive hook which just makes me really not enjoy listening to it jsadjsjd. Also by the time I get to Trina's second verse I kind of tire of the instrumental, overall yes I am very mad about this outlasting Ladies 1st it greatuly upsets me fuck you all.

---

# ladies 2nd

**lady\_sable** (10): TWO bad bitches!!

**plastichaxan** (10): the ultimate maximation of their joint slay moment in the rate

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I love to see all the collaborations between the women in this rate (even if it seems Kim was left out, she still gets a shout out on Work It)

**seanderlust** (10): i'm obsessed with missy's delivery on the chorus

**throwaway-7650** (10): I can hear nicki singing the chorus

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): This sounds like a better Missy song than most of the songs on the Missy album lol

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): This song knocked the teeth out of my mouth. I will not be explaining myself

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): ATEEEE

**skargardin** (9): They ate

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Missy's parts send me

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): this is SO VERY GOOD for the first stretch and then it just kinda loses steam at the end

**BaconShoes** (8): two lady legends together! A bop

**TiltControls** (8): You can rewind that back by putting it down, flipping it, then reverse it

**voidofstars** (8): island giiirrrlllss!

**waluigiest** (8): Missy Elliott and that damn rewind button…

**bornskinnyhomo** (7.5): A great collab!

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): can’t quite rewind it forward i’m afraid

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I'm sorry, but Missy's "BoOooOoy" part is sending me.

**1998tweety** (7): not excuse my French after saying fuck....

**frogaranaman** (7): I wanna smoke out with Missy and Trina

**welcome2thejam** (7): Crossovers all over the place

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): missy ate

# ladies 1st was saur robbed

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is the weaker of the two Missy-produced tracks on the album for me, although I do like her verse here a lot.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): good but not earth shattering

**ImADudeDuh** (7): should’ve been better

**iniekcja\_** (6): wtf is missy doing

**MrSwearword** (6): fine for what it is but the Bad Gyal or whatever that one Missy track from This Is Not a Test with Vybz Kartel was...whatever that was, Missy is doing it again and it does NOT work here.

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): make me

**ricki** (5): i don't like this chorus:(

This song kinda feels like dark sonically? Which I find really cool because the rest of the album is so bright to me! This isn't Trina's most memorable work to me but at the same time I really can't fault anything about it, her and Rick both do what they need to do very well, and the production is catchy as hell.

---

# told you so

**CrimsonROSET** (10): diamonds are a girl’s best friend

**lady\_sable** (10): maam i am on my KNEES

**seanderlust** (10): AAAAAHHH BABY RICK ROSS

**you2009** (8.8): right hea!

**1998tweety** (8.5): i know comparisons are annoying but she sounds like a fusion of Cardi and Cupcakke

**akanewasright** (8): This one never sticks with me and I honestly don’t know why, it’s really damn good

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): she did tell us, that is true

**Stryxen** (8): pls i thought she was saying that’s sus

**throwaway-7650** (8): RAH-RAH? ROMAN HOLIDAY BY NICKI MINAJ?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.8): I forget Rick Ross was around rapping this early, but apparently this is one of his first rap appearances ever

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): i’m not used to Rick Ross being so nimble vocally instead of his usual booming self, but I don’t mind it

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Help, I watched the music video with the song and it looks like it was shot on a potato...

**BaconShoes** (7): a jam

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): when she said "switch up the flows" and she actually did...it was over

**voidofstars** (6): makes me wanna shake some ASS

# my friend is making me watch pitch perfect as im writing this and its going off

**MrSwearword** (7): makes sense as a single but this bored me.

**MC\_Fuzzy** (6.5): I cannot believe Ross sounded like this.

**bornskinnyhomo** (6): A good song brought down by a trash hook

**IIIHenryIII** (6): the drums are the only good thing about this track

**indie\_fan\_** (4): to be real, was never a hug fan of this track

**MrSwearword** (5): I know the production from background music on VH1. That production makes up for a lukewarm song like this. Sorryboutit.

I don't really know what to say about this song tbh, it just feels so triumphant? I'm not gonna say it is perfect, bc I think something was up in the studio when they mixed this jasdja, but god if I don't love this song and the way it makes me feel. It's such a good summation of the themes of the album, and Trina is absolutely on the top of her game and raps back and forth with Bathgate so well!

---

# would u like to marry me

**welcome2thejam** (11): Jesus, this beat. Oh shit, this is Kanye produced? Had to instantly hit repeat, everything and everyone on this is firing on all cylinders. And I legit said "wow" out loud, that's how this song is making me feel

# who want me

**akanewasright** (10): Trina SHINES here, like I feel like any time she gets to have this back and forth with another rapper, she’s just brilliant. And this beat just feels so… classic in the best possible way. It’s an early Kanye beat, so of course it is, but like… everything about this is really really special

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I've just realized I finished the album and didn't give a 10 to any of these songs, well… this is my favorite so I might as well give it to it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the instrumental is giving sims 1

**TiltControls** (10): Almost the 11. Too bad Missy was here

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): who wont me

**iniekcja\_** (9): that's a lot of cars

**lady\_sable** (9): yes queen i do

**BeauMeringue212** (8.8): "you need a wife in your life and I'm taking your spot" oh I'm stealing that line

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): I want power, actually

**bbfan132** (8.5): fun outro! (not including the actual outro)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): Thank you Trina for this glorious album mwah

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): good note to end the album on but not necessarily a standout

**thedoctordances1940** (7.9): just a very solid closer

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): honestly very surprised how much i like the guest verse from the random guy on this

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Ngl this os very mid for me...

**BaconShoes** (7): i was jamming i liked it

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this is a VERY weird closer

**frogaranaman** (7): the feature bought Belle Delphine's bath water

**seanderlust** (6.3): it's fun enough but the weird singing on the chorus isn't it for me

**indie\_fan\_** (6): It's alright, but 100% should have been the closer

**slimboyfriend** (6): The mixing during the sung part is so awful that it really drags the rest of the song down

**throwaway-7650** (6): the Staples Center line did #not age well

**MrSwearword** (5): it makes sense as a closer but goddamn is this just hollow.

**babadork** (4.5): I’m usually pretty easy to please with these kinds of songs. I think Bathgate and Trina’s skills are too similar.

# nixon </3

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): watergate walked so bathgate could run

**1998tweety** (7.5): wtf is a Bathgate

**ImADudeDuh** (7): is bathgate like watergate but smaller?

I think this is my most negative take in the rate?? Not sure, but this song never hit for me, especially compared to the other obligatory end-of-album-singing-about-hardhsip ballads on the other three. I usually enjoy Teena Marie's vocals at least somewhat, but here I just find them kinda whiny in the background, and idk what it is but the phrasing of the hook and title "life is so hard" just sounds so... ugly to me?? I think that could've been workshopped to be something better while still being just as impactful.

---

# easy peezy

**thedoctordances1940** (11): yeah this is incredible, brilliant lyrics, brilliant beat, brilliant hook, I'm not entirely sure why this isn't considered a classic

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (11): I looove this sound. The vocals are so good. The lyrics too.

**2dina3dworld** (10): life is so hard but do you know what else is

**CrimsonROSET** (10): see i feel bad agreeing with this because i feel like what i consider ‘hard’ and what eve considers ‘hard’ are very different but let me feel my feelings ok! If you see me loop this when the store is out of cookie dough look away!

**fadedblue09** (10): One of the most relatable and most revelatory songs in the rates, also love the tinge of soul in this

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): melaninated queens… jokes aside Teena kills this, she fucks it all the way up. One of the standouts of the album

**iniekcja\_** (10): I kind of want to go hear some gospel live, not that I'm religious, it's just fun

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): popheads might tank because religious theme, but it's just a banger

**MrSwearword** (10): everything about this song is right.

**throwaway-7650** (10): teena marie's spotify description uhm.

**indie\_fan\_** (9.8): I always like when Eve get's personal in her lyrics as well as what she brings up on this track. This could have been the closer, but then...

**1998tweety** (9): Teena ate this up

**Stryxen** (9): woah

**TiltControls** (9): so true

**welcome2thejam** (9): Well thankfully, this song goes so hard

**you2009** (8.8): normal white women can hang too!

**IIIHenryIII** (8): most generic track ever, but it works. Sometimes less is good enough.

**lady\_sable** (8): queen of mental health awareness

**nt96** (8): Teena Marie was the only white girl that the r&b community claimed.

**plastichaxan** (8): so true

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): they spilled

**TragicKingdom1** (8): so true

**vayyiqra** (8): At first I wasn't sure if I liked this but you know she's got a point

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): i saw the title and thought this would be more relatable than it actually was

# woe is me

**BaconShoes** (6): yeah i’m usually not into the like, inspirational, take me to church kinda songs but it’s not bad

**babadork** (5.9): Eve has some good lines, but she isn’t matching what Teena Marie is bring in the chorus.

**bornskinnyhomo** (5.5): The gospel inflection is not for me, but Eve sounds great as per usual on this album

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): ok Ms. Teena needs to tone the vocals down a few notches

**skargardin** (5): I really wanted to like this more than I ended up doing :pensivegrin:

**Uberpigeon** (5): i dont support god

**voidofstars** (5): god forgive me but this song is corny as fuck

# i shouldve made this the banner 

**waluigiest** (8): if you told me this was fergie I’d believe you

# SLUTS <333

**radioactive-isotopes** (11): bop!

**sufjancaesar** (11): only justification I have for this score is simply that this song goes fucking crazy skdjsjd….like I can’t stop wanting to replay it - it’s addictive

**2dina3dworld** (10): wow this really sounds like GP Basic’s Jelly Pop

**akanewasright** (10): 10 Trina could probably eat this man for breakfast

**bigbigbee** (10): Another 11 contender. I FUCKING LOVE this song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Kinda obsessed with how the chorus of this song is literally people calling her nasty and her agreeing

**plastichaxan** (10): this song didn’t even let me breathe to think of a comment my god

**throwaway-7650** (10): I need the rico nasty cover ASAP

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): These lyrics... help.

**you2009** (10): nasty bitch put some clothes on

**waluigiest** (9): this really is nasty. I live!!!

**slimboyfriend** (8.3): she has a point when she says “can’t talk with a pussy in your face”

**BeauMeringue212** (8): the verses go so much harder but the chorus is a bit meh

**bornskinnyhomo** (7): Why is WAP considered revolutionary when women have been doing stuff like it for decades? Give the OGs their credit!

**IIIHenryIII** (7): you nasty song, you nasty

**iniekcja\_** (7): *ululululul*

**MrSwearword** (7): nasty is good but the guest rapper here is so unnecessary. Still, glorious filth should be exalted.

**Uberpigeon** (7): trinas pussy is tighter than mine i fear

Eve's flow is just insane, I was really pleasantly surprised with how this song did in the rate bc I kinda felt like it would pale in comparison to the few following tracks, but glad to see people feel like it stands up on its own too!

# when i say yee, you say haw

**akanewasright** (10): honestly I always forget how good this is because the big singles are right after it, but it’s SUCH a fun time

**bornskinnyhomo** (10): Damn this goes hard! Great intro to the album

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is so much fun

**MrSwearword** (10): holy shit this is an album opener.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): See You Space Cowboy…

**throwaway-7650** (10): aur my god... don't you know I'm a... SÆVAGE? anyway fuck SM

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): say it queen.

**fadedblue09** (9): A fire opener

**iniekcja\_** (9): I love Eve

**lady\_sable** (9): ooh this slaps

**skargardin** (9): bop alert!

**BaconShoes** (8.5): Where my people at? -Roxxxy Andrews

**bbfan132** (8.5): good opening track!! nice start to the album

**plastichaxan** (8.5): this is so catchy

**1998tweety** (8): Mitski shaking

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the ‘bounce’ part is absolutely a twerk break isn’t it

**frogaranaman** (8): thought there'd be more equestrian lines

**indie\_fan\_** (8): Strong intro, main complain is the hook is a little questionable and a little short

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Is this country?

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): where the cowboy at???

**MC\_Fuzzy** (7.5): Off rip, better intro than I expected.

**seanderlust** (7.5): eve comes out swinging immediately on this album which we love to see it. this one just doesn't click with me though. the separate pieces are great, i just have never been able to make this one click

**TiltControls** (7.5): when i say yee

**Stryxen** (7): i went to genius for the lyrics and i got so distracted by the fact this is on the blade soundtrack to care about the lyrics x

# I DIDNT SAY FUCKING YEE

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): an alright opener but it doesn't blow me away

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): stream bounce by charli xcx (illegally)

**babadork** (6.4): Great energy to start the album, but the call and response goes on a bit long.

Idk if this is real or not but the instrumental to this reminds me a lot of Ex-factor by Lauryn Hill. Anyway I'm pleasantly surprised by how this did, as the first of the four obligatory slow songs to go out, MJB is a legend and it is a wonder how we've not rated her yet tbh.

---

# oh i didnt see ghost said this before i wrote my comment, well :besties:

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): kinda has Lauryn Hill vibes

# gotta keep holdin' on

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): oh i really love this one...i'm a sucker for introspective songs about how fame has changed relationships (see little simz miss understood)

**NotWith10000Men** (10): only reason it's not getting my 11 is bc i already heard can you hear me. beautiful

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is such a nice change of pace for the album, and it's such a refreshingly vulnerable and delicate song

**skargardin** (10): oh wow this is stunning

**throwaway-7650** (10): I appreciate this [2] but it's kind of giving spoken word tribute that goes on for far too long at the memorial service

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): This is so good wait. This is my fav Kim song for sure.

**bbfan132** (9): it’ll probably get cut early bc of the length but it’s very good!! mary sounds amazing here

**BeauMeringue212** (9): Damn this is heavy. Can't imagine how hard this must've been to write

**CrimsonROSET** (9): mary j blige is a blessing to every song

**iniekcja\_** (9): I need to get into Mary J. Blige's discography

**indie\_fan\_** (8.9): Maybe a bit off in context with the album, but still a beautiful track nonetheless.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): yeah this is just great innit

**celladonn** (8.5): Awww. Mary's vocals here are amazing

**TiltControls** (8.5): The same comment as last time there was a MJB feature in a rate - WHEN ARE WE RATING HER??

**seanderlust** (8.2): very pretty but i'm a little in my long-song-phobic bag right now

**BaconShoes** (8): one of the better gospelly, “we can get through hard times” kinda songs between these albums. Mary definitely delivers

**frogaranaman** (8): Kim's verses are alright but I don't like the idea of Mary J. Blige getting robbed so I'm raising my score

**MrSwearword** (8): it's a rare thing to hear a rapper at the height of their fame be vulnerable.

**1998tweety** (7.5): Mary ate

**akanewasright** (7.5): Kim recorded this holding back tears and you can tell :barrelcat:

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Vote for 2000s Women of Neo Soul Rate 👀

**voidofstars** (7): i feel her pain on this one

**MC\_Fuzzy** (6.5): God Bless Mary J.

# kinda fell off

**babadork** (6.5): Their emotion is very moving, but this song has a bit too much baggage that gets in the way.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): *Tough times, they last so long*, 6 minutes and 4 seconds to be exact. I held on and held on, and believed, but the song didn't get any better.

**vayyiqra** (6): Not to be longsongphobic but I am in a (self-imposed) hurry here

**bornskinnyhomo** (5.5): Didn’t fully capture my attention, but sounded generally good

**hikkaru** (5): it's pleasant but at this point in the album i am NOT interested in a 6 minute song i'm sorry

**moonagenightmares** (3): long and boring im sorry

This was very very nearly my 11, and would have been deserving of at least one, but alas. This was the first song I fell in love with when I was getting into all of these albums, Eve's flow in the verses is insane and she tells such a fluid story through them. Most people's complaint seems to be with the nursery rhyme repetitiveness of the chorus, which I understand, but to me the chorus is such a proclamation of pure "fuck you" energy it works for me

---

# you had me

**iniekcja\_** (11): breaking up with my nonexistent man as we speak

**2dina3dworld** (10): the hook is a bit weak but this is bad bitch energy to the max

**bbfan132** (10): eve delivered here <3

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Eve has some great lyrics on this one and the “playground chant” chant actually really works for me

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): she came on this bitch mad as hell

**seanderlust** (10): *writes a letter to Ruff Ryders and Interscope twenty one years later complaining about how this should have been a single*

**throwaway-7650** (10): giving this a 10 for the skit (3 Way), an 11 btw

**lady\_sable** (9.5): idk who this man is but he fucked up

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): love the bratty energy here

**bookthieving** (9): you had me (with the verses), you lost me (with the chorus)

**CrimsonROSET** (9): alexa play you lose!

**BeauMeringue212** (8): I'd probably rate this higher but the chorus melody is a bit nee naw schoolyard

**indie\_fan\_** (8): I notice I'm going to say this a lot, but the hooks during a good amount of the songs on this album is where my main issue is. And it's a shame considering that the verses are damn killer. If she replaced the chorus with something more lyrically substantial (or at least less irritating), it would be an easy 10.

**MrSwearword** (8): this does not measure up to the first three songs but lyrically this is fantastic.

**TiltControls** (8): songs when i give them a score under 10, grow to love them, and then leave day 1

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): These lyrics are so good. Why does the production sound like a ufo?

**waluigiest** (8): good raps and good hook

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): kinda a cool beat i suppose

**MC\_Fuzzy** (7): You know, I’m not big on Eve singing, but it’s here that I realized I really like her voice for rapping

**welcome2thejam** (7): Fuck yeah, get him Eve

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): "fuck this guy in particular" songs never get old

# you lost me

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): had me with the verses and kinda lost me with the hook

**cremeebrulee** (6.8): the chorus feels a bit juvenille but it's decent otherwise

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): omg this is like abcdefu by gayle but older

**plastichaxan** (6.5): me with this song coming on after the great first tracks

**BaconShoes** (6): the chorus is slightly annoying but also catchy

**bornskinnyhomo** (6): Again, a bad hook with great raps

**frogaranaman** (6): the fuck is this a fucking kindergarten playground?

**Stryxen** (6): hated this at first but it took a few listens to be… alright i guess

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): The “na na na na” taunting chant chorus is pretty annoying

**IIIHenryIII** (5): you annoyed me

This was the first song to hit for me on the album and really remains my favourite, I think it's the 90s rap pastiche of it all but I can't get enough of this beat or Jay and Missy rapping back and forth on it, for sure one of my favourite collabs on the album. I also love all the references Missy throws to more tenured rappers, in theme with the song and also a fitting callback for a song that is a call to peace among what was at the time a very hostile community.

---

# jules alts

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I think this is my favorite deep cut. It’s just so fun and all the references make me happy. This is auntie pop, about an era I wasn’t around for, but I’m here for it. And all verse about the women who opened doors for her is great.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): makes me nostalgic… I know you’re not gonna do it but please play “Dedicated” by Mariah Carey after this

**NotWith10000Men** (10): oh this is fucking GROOVY and fun

**nt96** (10): When you realize that the years between her younger days and this album are about as long as this album's release and today. We've changed alright.

**TiltControls** (10): this is. another. missy elliot. 10

**waluigiest** (10): I’ve loved all of Jay-Z’s early 00’s collabs

**babadork** (9.8): It is interesting that the throwback song is one of the few that does not sample any old-school songs.

**you2009** (9.5): missy franklin!!!

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): such a good track, great beat, awesome smooth vocals, really good feature, just great overall

**akanewasright** (9): Yes Missy we LOVE MC Lyte

**fadedblue09** (9): Very irresistible and groovy production

**lady\_sable** (9): 90s nostalgia before it was cool

**BaconShoes** (8): One thing I love about Missy is her singing and rapping are like, just as good

**bornskinnyhomo** (8): I love the beat on this one

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): oldhead anthem but make it catchy

**vayyiqra** (7): Another memory unlocked - did one of my brothers have this CD and I forgot? Weird.

**welcome2thejam** (7): Probably should hate "Missy goes lewronggeneration" more than I do

# oldheads (derogatory)

**CrimsonROSET** (8): a bit preachy i’m afraid? but it still bops

**ImADudeDuh** (8): i was gonna make a “back in MY day” joke but thats what the song is called so rip to this comment

**indie\_fan\_** (8): Always appreciated how Missy was one of the few rappers in the 90's/2000's that was always about unity and wanting to get along.  My main complaint is I feel that this track runs on for just a tad bit too long.

**throwaway-7650** (8): old raters yell at [up-and-coming rap girls rate]

**moonagenightmares** (7.7): jayz always ruining women’s songs

**MC\_Fuzzy** (7.5): Really like the beat, but some of these lines didn’t land for me. It could be the subject matter, but shout out to Jay telling Bill to fuck himself.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I wonder what she thinks about hip-hop now?

**frogaranaman** (7): lmfao was JAY-Z even on this

**MrSwearword** (7): How many goddamn Missy Elliott exclusives are there...*before 2007 shh*...the production makes up for the fact that this is basically Lauryn Hill's "Doo Wop (That Thing)" but without the rich subtext or good song behind it. But hey Tweet! I hear those backup vocals.

**slimboyfriend** (7): I like the throwback instrumental and sentiment but her singing isn’t fully doing it for me on this one

**plastichaxan** (6): okay i had a 5 when jay-z came on the song but then when missy was in it went up to a 7 so

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I can't with Jay-Z's references. As a non-native English speaker, it's hard to get most of them

**BeauMeringue212** (4): I like that it's got a positive message but it's giving... Kidz Bop

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): boring

This is far from my favourite on the album, but I love Trina's choice to make a ballad about the fallout of a platonic friendship rather than a romantic one, her Bad Friend by Rina serve! I also think it'll be a surprise to a lot of people how well this did, but I think at this point you can tell each album had one obligatory "slow emotional" song that people did very well.

---

# this could be us 

**babadork** (10): I want to live in an alternate universe in which this was really popular and there is an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show about the two of them reuniting.

**bbfan132** (10): this is excellent, i love this

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): ugh...really love this one

**seanderlust** (10): this is one of my favorites off the record. she goes into such depth and gets so specific to really build her story.

**TiltControls** (10): Trina trying to play letterle with this album

**welcome2thejam** (10): Rap beats that sound like this instantly land on my good side. Trina absolutely takes aim and lands multiple critical hits

**you2009** (10): me who has never experienced this in my life: sooo true

**cremeebrulee** (9.3): this is actually rly sweet aww

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oooooh that vocal line

**iniekcja\_** (9): samples like this always make me feel warm and loved

**lady\_sable** (9): that melody is so good

**throwaway-7650** (9): still not sure who the lyrics are addressed to so I'll pretend it's nicki

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.8): I love the fire in Trina’s verses

**indie\_fan\_** (8.7): Always have a weakness for songs that get more personal. This is one of the few Trina tracks I actually revisit every now and then

**akanewasright** (8): I actually really like gentler side of Trina’s personality that we see here, and ig I’m a sucker for chipmunk soul samples

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): there’s a Cassie joke here but I’m not funny enough to find it

**MrSwearword** (8): cute for what it is

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): This is corny, but in a good way.

**voidofstars** (8): i wish we had more songs like this from trina

**waluigiest** (8): the sample is criiiisp

**IIIHenryIII** (7.8): it has some groove to it

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): this beat is fucking phenomenal but for some reason the song as a whole isn't clicking for me

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): struggle tweet

**bornskinnyhomo** (6.5): A lil cheesy, but otherwise a nice song

**fadedblue09** (6.5): This one has a more vintage hip hop feel, making it sound a little typical, but still has some memorable lyrics

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): It was you and me HO!

**BaconShoes** (6): not my favorite but a vibe

This is the smasha, I think I actually prefer this to Work It even, I love when Missy does this sort of flow. If this rate wasn't already hella stacked this would be an awesome all stars submission.

---

# fuck tmz

**bigbigbee** (11): It’s SO much fun. This one’s for you, Lee Jung!

**bookthieving** (11): this is some of missy's, ludacris's, and timbaland's best work and yet alyson stoner is still the biggest slayer here

**nt96** (11): 20 years later, and we're still talking shit. People never learn.

**akanewasright** (10): If you get a Luda feature, the song is a 10. It worked for Missy on One Minute Man, and it works here, and it’ll work in 100 years when she, the immortal being she is, digs up Luda’s rotting corpse and makes it feature on the second single off her new project

**babadork** (10): I had a really hard time choosing between this and Work It for my 11.

**BaconShoes** (10): ICONIC!!!! Missy is always doing something fresh. Like I can’t think of another song like this. Ludacris is always so fun, and the Timbaland production is sick

**buddhacharm** (10): has anyone watched the Gossip Girl reboot? it's shit

**CrimsonROSET** (10): luda makes this a 10

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This was going to be my 11. It’s an amazing use of a sample, and the intro and outro are so fucking funny

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of my favorite songs on the album! I love how she fires back at all the things people are saying about her with a sense of humor, and the skits and cartoonish sound palate are so much fun to listen to. Her and Ludacris have fantastic chemistry on the track too, and the sample is used very well.

**MrSwearword** (10): a goddamn classic, justice for Ludacris [bring him back and get rid of every shitty rapper out there now]. Also hey Tweet in the video! Hi Tweet, I just salmonella girl.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): [Teatime Thread]

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I was so torn between giving this (the long-standing favourite) and B R Right (the new favourite) my 11. Both featuring Ludacris, KING!!

**seanderlust** (10): MISSY READING THEM AT THE END HELP

**skargardin** (10): Ludacris ate this UP

**slimboyfriend** (10): This is Work It, Get Ur Freak On, Lose Control-level greatness, but for some reason gets overlooked maybe because she’s got a weird granny flow but reads these girls to the ground

**welcome2thejam** (10): Finally just learned what the chorus means, so doing this rate is already super beneficial to me! Missy is just loads of fun on an all-timer beat

**you2009** (10): I heard she eat one cracka a day!

**MC\_Fuzzy** (9.5): The best single of the album. Ludacris deserves more respect for his raps.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): classique but i wish the chorus wasn’t just the double dutch bus sample

**iniekcja\_** (9): no cause if Payless ran out of plastic pumps for the after party I would be mad too

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): 00s Luda guest verses are just a gift. We need to rate 11 Minute Man soon though

**Stryxen** (8.5): under construction is in stores tomorrow give it up for under construction you guys

**moonagenightmares** (8.1): get their ass missy

**BeauMeringue212** (8): Idk half of what Missy is saying bit it's catchy lol

**frogaranaman** (8): growing up Catholic I was always told that gossiping is a sin and looking back on it I just don't think my parents wanted the kids to be around when they were gossiping

**plastichaxan** (8): finally the gossip girl remake that includes us they/thems

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): This song was so chaotic in the best way possible.

**vayyiqra** (8): Childhood memory unlocked of trying to figure out what the hell the chorus says

**waluigiest** (8): after listening to this I’ve decided to be less of a hater

**bornskinnyhomo** (7.5): It is in fact a bop!

**lady\_sable** (7.5): "take those baby gap shirts off" is peak early 2000s diss

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): flabster

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): not messing with this a ton but ludacris's verse is really good

**IIIHenryIII** (7): this has never been one of my favorite hits by her, but it's decent

**NotWith10000Men** (7): luda is a nice addition

**Uberpigeon** (7): the mequetrefe of 00s mcs

# im sick of rumours starting, im sick of being followed

**indie\_fan\_** (7): Honestly have mixed feelings on this track because I think the "quirkiness" she adds on this track with how she uses her voice works well, same for Ludacris as tracks like this are definitely his specialty. However, the sample in the hook with the kid always bothered me quite a bit.

**TiltControls** (6.5): the gossip is that this is just kinda mid

**cremeebrulee** (6.3): this chorus feels like a cheese grater to my brain

**throwaway-7650** (5): ik it's a sample but the chorus gives PBS kids

I could probably write a lot here but I don't really think I have anything unique or new to say, but god it is a tragedy that Aaliyah and Left Eye aren't with us today. I think this song is such a perfect end to the album, and to be quite honest it just really makes me wanna go listen to the music of the people they are singing about, which is perfect. So excited to rate Aaliyah finally in May!

---

# yeah :/

**NotWith10000Men** (11): i never hand out 11s until i finish the whole rate but i had this one down before the song was even finished

**akanewasright** (10): Perfect way to bring the album home. Absolutely incredible in nearly every way

**CrimsonROSET** (10): 😔

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Wait this is adorable, the writing is a bit clunky at points but their sincerity shines through. Though I will say there’s a kinda weird tone to this song now though given how the images of these artists (Aaliyah in particular) have been resurrected for profit.

**indie\_fan\_** (10): I'm glad this album ends on a beautiful and heartfelt note after the last few questionable songs.

**nt96** (10): As much of a golden age the late 90s - early 00s was for Hip Hop and r&b, we often forget how turbulent it was due to how many legends were taken too soon.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Not to be all "omg this track is really sad therefore it's good" but like… it's really pretty and makes me feel things what can I say

**seanderlust** (10): this is such a sweet tribute to the numerous legends that have passed. while I may not come back to it very often, I am so grateful this collab exists

**Stryxen** (10): (11 really) i’m very desensitised to sad music i listen to so much but there’s such a hopeful optimistic tone to this song that it just makes it so bittersweet and every single time i get to the “we hope that you’re proud of us” i tear up so much. I can’t give much insight or analysis but this song really just captures a certain emotion about losing your close friend and i’m so glad this song is in my life now <3

**waluigiest** (10): it’s a beautiful, emotional tribute. This album really took us through it

**celladonn** (9.5): This is genuinely really lovely and heartwarming

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Very heartwarming dedication

**bbfan132** (9): :/ really good albeit sad note to end on

**BeauMeringue212** (9): this is a lovely tribute

**cremeebrulee** (9): </3

**lady\_sable** (9): ending on a sad note i see (also a genuinely great message)

**Roxieloxie** (9): I've been thinking alot about what it was like for alot of the black girls in this scene lately, like what was it like loosing left eye and Aaliyah so close to each other. Idk I have alot of thoughts on this I dont think i wanna go on about it here

**TiltControls** (9): This is just super sweet

**voidofstars** (9): beautiful ending

**welcome2thejam** (9): Jesus, realizing this was made right after Left-Eye died is a fucking gut punch

**BaconShoes** (8.5): this is so sad. I hate that Aaliyah and Left Eye passed, but this is a beautiful tribute

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): So sad, rest in peace Aaliyah and Left Eye

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): 😢

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): good closing track, really just feels like a classic hip-hop closer

**1998tweety** (8): :(

**frogaranaman** (8): I like how it feels like I'm on Facetime with Missy whenever she has a spoken word interlude

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): really nice

**MrSwearword** (8): a cute closer, but umm maybe some quality control on this album needed to happen. Seriously how is this the same album that had PUSSY DON'T FAIL ME NOW.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Wow, this is so sweet. I really like this. It's so touching.

**bornskinnyhomo** (7): As someone who was a baby when this album came out, I clearly don’t understand the full impact of the artists this album is dedicated to, but this album did really help me appreciate their absence.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): oh, I had a joke, but then I learned this is a dedication to Aaliyah

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I usually really like music that sounds like but something about it isn’t connecting 100% for me, which I feel a bit bad about because the meaning of the song is so wonderful. I mentioned this on my album comments, but I love her love and support for other artists – both alive, and on this track, deceased.

**MC\_Fuzzy** (6.5): I like vibe, I understand the meaning behind the skits, but most of them throw me off

# @ me

**hikkaru** (6.5): the outro is her message to anyone tanking her here

# sorry i didnt make this the banner mk everybody look at how funny mk is guys give it up for mk

**throwaway-7650** (10): I appreciate this but it's kind of giving when the aunties collectively break out in song at the funeral while everyone sobs

I WANT MY ASS SMACKED FRONT BACK PUSSY WET god they both fucking nailed this. I honestly don't have a lot to say about this song simply because it's so faultless, Luda's verse especially is *incredible* though, kind of sends me that Ludacris appears more in this top 10 than Kim does.

---

# want their ass smacked

**BeauMeringue212** (11): the production on this is crazy and Trina just spits out every word. The chorus is iconic

**jackisboredtoday** (11): Ludacris guest verses were truly the best thing to happen to 00s rap

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): possibly my favourite beat in the whole rate tbh and an 11 contender for sure. edit: it is now my 11.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): this has winner energy

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): Trina and Luda have so much chemistry and charisma, and the string sample is everything

# everything gonna be alright

**akanewasright** (10): GOD this is such a good song. Aside from the video, which feels like Shrek ripoff levels of censored crass, this is just pure gold. The back and forth, the beat, every single verse, all of it is so good

**bbfan132** (10): this totally bops

**celladonn** (10): This absolutely slaps omg, classic Kanye beat and Trina and Luda both ate

**cremeebrulee** (10): BOP!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): throw the child like a water balloon

**fadedblue09** (10): Luda always snaps with his features, also another rapping highlight for Trina

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Ludacris might be the one good man on the planet actually, he really managed to slip onto two of the best songs in the rate

**MrSwearword** (10): Everything is R Right here

**seanderlust** (10): this rate and the early 2000s southern rap hits rate idea have really cemented for me that early 2000s was unmatched

**throwaway-7650** (10): GLORY TO THE DHARMA OF THE LOTUS SUTRA

**BaconShoes** (9): i turned up the volume for this one

**bornskinnyhomo** (9): Oof I love this, the violin beat and Ludacris sounds good

**TiltControls** (9): not to be confused with C S Left

**vayyiqra** (9): :flushed:

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Buddhist chant turned BDSM anthem

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): ludacris's verse goes hard af

**1998tweety** (8): ok it really is wild just how much she sounds like Cupcakke both vocally and lyrically

**indie\_fan\_** (8): Luda and Trina complement each other pretty well on here. And Kanye also does well on the production here

**waluigiest** (8): there are a few tasty moments throughout the song like the really crunchy beat behind Luda a few lines into his verse

**welcome2thejam** (8): The perpetual nostalgia of 2000s Ludacris features

**ricki** (7.5): Alejandro by lady gaga

**Stryxen** (7.5): i just saw cupcakke girl

**MC\_Fuzzy** (7.3): Man, Ludacris deserves more credit than he gets for this early half of the 2000s

**NotWith10000Men** (7): i really like the violins

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): thanks for the imagery

**Uberpigeon** (6): not ooh ee walla walla bing bang

# girl ludacris ate that

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I'm sorry, but her male feature are... no.

This is just the ultimate hype song to me, and of what I considered the possible winners (essentially the top 6) this was by far my first choice. It just feels like such an epic entrance, it's catchy, it has memorable lines, the saxophone line is legendary 20 years later, it literally ticks every box and I am very mad at you all for robbing it like this!!!

---

# lalalalalalalalalalalala

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): no it’s eve

**letsallpoo** (11): this song now automatically plays in my head whenever i enter a room full of people i dont know

**moonagenightmares** (11): banger

**skargardin** (11): An 11 influenced by nostalgia and re-discovery? It's more likely than you think!

# who *is* she

**akanewasright** (10): ~~It’s Jess~~

**BeauMeringue212** (10): Even better than Robyn's "Who's That Girl" and that's a high compliment

**celladonn** (10): Oh this bumps

**CrimsonROSET** (10): who is she drag her slay her yadda yadda yadda

**fadedblue09** (10): Cool! A song I’m familiar with

**iniekcja\_** (10): this song is older than me but it feels nostalgic

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the lyricism...unparalleled

**MrSwearword** (10): a fucking classic, enough said.

**seanderlust** (10): I mean of course eve's flow is legendary - I mean, come on, it's eve - but shoutout to the trumpet in the background which really heightens this track

**throwaway-7650** (10): loona every time they teased the next "girl of the month"

**welcome2thejam** (10): Who's that girl... (who's that girl) It's Eve!

**BaconShoes** (9.5): A smash

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9.5): I don't know. Is it eve?

**you2009** (9.5): eevee's that girl

**1998tweety** (9): she ate this

**bbfan132** (9): i really enjoyed this! eve is great here

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): okay but she made a point, she IS that girl on this song

**voidofstars** (9): i feel like i’m ascending to heaven every time this song comes on

**waluigiest** (9): who is she?

**TiltControls** (7.5): I love questions that resolve themselves in the next line

**NotWith10000Men** (7.2): i love a trumpet

# this shouldve won :(

**IIIHenryIII** (7): the chorus is a bit disappointing, but the verses make up for it

**indie\_fan\_** (7): Again, Eve kills it with the verses, I was never crazy about the hook. I know it was obviously for commercial appeal (which worked in the end as it's one of her bigger songs), but I always felt like it didn't fit.

**Uberpigeon** (7): 00s was a rough time for horn sounds

**bornskinnyhomo** (6.5): The rap is good, don’t love the hook though.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.3): who *is* she?

Thank fuck this didn't win jejkjas. I'll tell you now, the whole top 4 was very close, but I'm very happy this fell where it did. It is not a bad song no, it is groovy and I like a lot of Eve's lines, but it is guilty of never really picking up throughout the song, I know not every song has to be big or build-up to anything! But I want this one too! I also think this collab could've leaned a *lot* further into the rock that clearly influences them both, I'd have loved that.

# DROP YA GLASSES, SHAKE YA ASSES

**celladonn** (11): That was a classic, that was a classic

**IIIHenryIII** (11): elevening this is so predictable, but you can't deny this is the best song in the rate. I know it, you know it, everybody knows it

**TragicKingdom1** (11): dr. dre production plus some of the best verses in the rate...a basic 11 but deserved nonetheless

**vayyiqra** (11): Giving this my 11 is an important moment for me! Okay not really but I do have this cringe memory of when I was a kid, about 20 years ago. My stepsister liked this song and had printed out the lyrics to it and somehow they wound up on the desk in my room (along with a bunch of other lyrics by random artists like Eminem). My mom found them and was teasing me about liking this song which of course at the time I denied. Now today I have grown and become more based and see there is no reason to feel ashamed for liking such a banger. It felt a little weird to give this my 11 because it's a rate of black women and it's the one (1) song with a white blonde woman but it's not because of Gwen (I'm not even that big a fan of hers). It's more than that; it's the interplay between the two of them, Eve's verses and Gwen on the hook, the incredible sample and how smooth the rhythm is, idk this song's just cool okay I'm done

# https://imgur.com/P0bBW30

**2dina3dworld** (10): Gangsta Lovin was the superior collab and I stand by that

**BaconShoes** (10): DROP YOUR GLASSES, SHAKE YOUR ASSES

**buddhacharm** (10): put Gwho on the map!

**cremeebrulee** (10): i know this is lowkey the rate villian but honestly if it wins i won’t even mind, it’s just /that/ good

**fadedblue09** (10): Sorry for being basic but this was one of the standouts for me lol

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): a boring rate winner but also an absolutely deserved one

**ImADudeDuh** (10): after hearing this on the radio all my life, it made me feel extremely weird to not hear “don’t fight that good… In your ear”

**jackisboredtoday** (10): I know giving this a 10 and being my fave from the album is a boring take, but what can I say its that good

**lady\_sable** (10): we need more rap girl/rock girl collabs i think

**MrSwearword** (10): THIS. is how all collabs should be done. It might be shady to say this is Eve's best song but it slays so motherfucking hard.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): i didn't know this was this song??? i swear i know too many songs from cultural osmosis yet remain ignorant

**nt96** (10): The most unlikely collab to ever happen but damn was it iconic.

**plastichaxan** (10): well you are blowing my mind girl carry on

**ricki** (10): this slays idc

**seanderlust** (10): i played the hell out of this song when it came out when i was like...a child njjkldfs. anyways it went off then and it goes off now. gwen is great but i think eve is the true highlight - her flow here is so effortlessly cool

**skargardin** (10): the beat is just so goddamn infectious

**throwaway-7650** (10): rich girl is better, I hate to say it

**TiltControls** (10): well you did

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Gwen sounds sooo good on this.

**waluigiest** (10): this song feels expensive. I’ve always loved it

**welcome2thejam** (10): Opening notes on this are an instant adrenaline rush. Eve rides an all-timer groove, and this is probably about as cool as non-No Doubt Gwen Stefani will ever be

**indie\_fan\_** (9.7): It's rare for a rapper's most commercially successful/pop-friendly song is also one of their actual best, but Eve definitely executes this song well.

**babadork** (9.6): I will say that I think this song and her other collaboration with Gwen Stefani are better live.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): this album starts off really strong

**1998tweety** (9): they both ate this up

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): Rich Girl really outsold this

**akanewasright** (8.5): Does this deserve to win? No. Is this her best song in the rate? Hell no! Is is still a bop and a half? You fucking know it

**bbfan132** (8.5): i’m familiar with this and i like it but it isn’t quite a 10 for me… i think gwen’s part is catchy but not super interesting

**you2009** (8.5): even racists can hang

**bornskinnyhomo** (8): An iconic song

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this comes before sweet escape in the gwen stefani cinematic universe

**Stryxen** (7): it did blow my mind at first but now ive relistened a few times its just a nice listen that lost its novelty

# the rich ppl at the party when they are shaking ass:

**voidofstars** (4): this song rides the line of “annoying as hell” and “fun to listen to” very closely

Surprise! There really was a point where I thought this could win, and god that would've been amazing. This is genuinely one of the best album openers I have ever heard, and I think how immediately it connected with people in this rate is a testament to that. Trina is unabashedly nasty, southern and female, three things that it was hard to be in the industry at this point. The structure of this song is brilliant, with the Q&A format, Trina's delivery is as fire as ever, and overall I am so *so* pleasantly surprised by how well this did in the rate. Trina overall tbh, she's definitely the least known of the four artists, so her having the most songs day 3, and kind of dominating the echo chamber around the rate was glorious to see. Stan Trina!!!

---

# women who have cocks <3

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): I’m scared of her but in a good way… like the shock factor of this song is kinda astonishing, it’s just line after line. The talk show framing device is kinda incredible too? I love this

**lady\_sable** (11): literally obsessed...real bad bitch hours

**seanderlust** (11): okay wait what channel is diggler's wild world of girls on

**Stryxen** (11): KEKE PALMER INTERVIEWED TRINA??

**waluigiest** (11): This song is just a joy to listen to! This was somehow 20 years ahead of its time. It’s fun, Trina is a stunning rapper, it’s almost transgressive. A show stopper that is now in my rotation.

# hustlers (2019)

**2dina3dworld** (10): the interlude for this better be No More ?’s

**akanewasright** (10): This is literally a bimbofied version of an Eazy-E song, and I love every second of it

**babadork** (10): Better than the Eazy-E original

**bbfan132** (10): :listening: a++++ tier intro

**BeauMeringue212** (10): this really sets the tone for the whole album lmao, I love how aggressive her delivery and lyrics are

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Trina please plot and scheme more. Someone get her a job as a spy or something, tbh!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this made me scream several times

**nt96** (10): Now that's an opening!

**plastichaxan** (10): did i had this as my 11 for almost the entire month solely for the “put my cock in his mouth” line? no, but wouldn’t that be funny

**RandomHypnotica** (10): she ate

**ricki** (10): \*takes notes*

**slimboyfriend** (10): THAT is how you start an album

**throwaway-7650** (10): we're not rating the intro but I just want to say that it's one of the best on the album, 11-worthy even. and this song is pretty good too... I guess

**TiltControls** (10): I hope this is how Trina answers all her Q&A's

**welcome2thejam** (10): Ten seconds in and this album starts off with an absolute bang. The interviewer yelling "Damn girl you wild as fuck!" describes this song exactly

**cremeebrulee** (9.7): its like the 2002 version of YBF but with 10x the more attitude, i love it

**BaconShoes** (9.5): this song is just so fun i love her

**celladonn** (9): Please this is so funny

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this is how yucky blucky fruitcake can still win

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): my god...she ate

**MrSwearword** (9): a solid opener but minus one for hating dicksucking.

**vayyiqra** (9): :flushed:

**voidofstars** (9): perfect use of a sample, eazy-e would be proud

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): what an absolute banger

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**bigbigbee** (8.5): me who has only watched Boss Baby, listening to my second song: getting a lot of Yucky Blucky Fruitcake vibes from this one

**bornskinnyhomo** (8.5): The INTRO HOLY SHIT bumps this score way up. Otherwise, a fun album opener

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Would get a 10 with less spoken parts

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): I really like this whole interview style thing. It's really creative.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): oh i LOVE that sample, what a genius move

**IIIHenryIII** (8): *Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustla, of a hustla, of a, of a hustla*

**indie\_fan\_** (8): actually a rather strong intro for the album. Definitely presents what you're into and showcases Trina's personality rather well

There was a point in the last week of ballots where this was only like 4 points behind and I genuinely thought it could pull in front, but unfortuantely Work It just got too many 10s and 11s at the end to compete. This is a brilliant rap song, it's got a catchy as fuck hook, memorable bars from Kim, and the video is iconic as iconic gets. 2nd is still very good.

# if i reversed this reveal this wouldve come last... much to think about

**1998tweety** (11): i mean come on now, an absolute classic and still holds up today.

**babadork** (11): This song is undeniable fun, because you can tell that everyone in the studio was also having a great time.

**BaconShoes** (11): Possibly even more iconic than Gossip Folks. This had me shaking ASS when it came out. Her saying “put my thing down flip it and reverse it” and then literally reversing it…GENIUS

**bbfan132** (11): basic but this is a classic for a reason!!!!

**hikkaru** (11): me when i host rates complaining about people stanning the most obvious winner and then turning around and giving this my 11

**ImADudeDuh** (11): i mean duh

**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (11): Certified dancefloor banger; Timabaland's beat and the fun lyrics make this one go off

**MrSwearword** (11): this is the most agonizing eleven selection I've made [sorry Kim] but this is simply fucking legendary. IT BETTER FUCKING NOT FINISH IN SECOND PLACE OR I BEAT MUHFUCKAS IN THE NECK.

**slimboyfriend** (11): ok ok, I know it’s the obvious choice, but it’s also the right one. The instrumental is next level for 2001 one and even for 2021, and Missy raps forwards, backwards and all around just to show everyone that she can!

**static\_int\_husp** (11): The backwards parts of this are still cool as hell

**TiltControls** (11): I used this on a deeper cut, but also this is one of the coolest songs ever

# this is the 25th highest average until happier than ever gets a 9.712 next month and its knocked off 

**2dina3dworld** (10): :daisybop:

**akanewasright** (10): This is a boring winner but yeah sure I guess it deserves

**BeauMeringue212** (10): I mean... it's a classic for a reason

**bigbigbee** (10): I was just gonna accept that I didn’t understand what the second line of the chorus was until I was listening to this with a friend and she was like “hey did you know?” Anyway, I think this is what I get for never reading lyrics

**celladonn** (10): Absolute classic obviously. Incredible beat. The elephant noise is so funny

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): ended the r/antiwork sub

**fadedblue09** (10): Very essentially 2000's, blueprint for a lot of pop sounds and trends in the decade

**frogaranaman** (10): I, too, like to search big dicks

**indie\_fan\_** (10): I mean... come on now

**lady\_sable** (10): i believe in female supremacy

**NotWith10000Men** (10): the instrumental on this is sick, i've never really paid attention to it

**nt96** (10): The song that spawned millions of different interpretations of her backwards talking.

**plastichaxan** (10): cissalc a saw taht

**RandomHypnotica** (10): thgir s'ti ...thgir s'ti nehW

**ricki** (10): im going to be real mad if this wins because i was THIS CLOSE 🤏 to 11ing it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): invented flipping then reversing it, the Black Lodge from Twin Peaks is shook

**skargardin** (10): it's the smasha!!

**throwaway-7650** (10): stream hot pink by EXID and give ILY your 10s/11s in smackdown

**TragicKingdom1** (10): TIL that she actually reverses "i put my thang down flip it and reverse it" !!! wait actually i did not learn today because thats brought up 10 times every time this song is mentioned

**vayyiqra** (10): Honestly I didn't enjoy this song all that much at the time it was released (I was also a kid) but now it's a classic and the beat is downright hypnotic so it should win

**waluigiest** (10): it’s got some of the most powerful, infectious energy I’ve ever heard.

**welcome2thejam** (10): God gave his sickest beats to his strongest MCs

**you2009** (10): I mean it's work it

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): tespu elttil a eb llits lliw i tub lla retfa yssim s'ti esuaceb devresed naem i ,sniw siht fi

**seanderlust** (9.5): I can't give this a ten because of the bridge lyrics that have uh..aged poorly. that said, i also can't give it less than a 9 for how hard it slaps and how much I loved it when i was a kid

**buddhacharm** (9): now CeCe that wok

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i’ll give it a better score in all winners i swear

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I miss these weird and funny references to genitalia, now people are so lazy and just say dick or pussy

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): grooooooovy

**bornskinnyhomo** (8): I mean, get that dick

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): This beat! That switch up is so good!

**Stryxen** (7.5): i honestly don’t really like the reversed line but the rest is so top tier it's unfortunate

**voidofstars** (7.5): i personally enjoy screaming the chocha line

# u tried but you didnt try hard enough im sorry

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I appreciate this but I’ll be honest I’ve never loved it, it’s kinda flat.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3.5): the high school musical cast outsold

**nt96** (9.077): This album balanced the old school and the y2k era of hip hop to the point of perfection. It gave a clear image of Missy's current state of mind as she went through a lot of grief due to the passing of Aaliyah, Left Eye, Biggie, and not to mention how 9/11 changed everything, all of this happening within a mere 5 years. Growing up during this era, it feels a bit strange seeing Y2K nostalgia posts knowing how tumultuous those times were. Those times were just as unprecedented as what we're going through today. Are we truly nostalgic for the good old days, or are we yearning for a time when things weren't nearly as bad?

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.938): This rate cemented my opinion that Miss E… So Addictive is better than this, but the highlights are SO iconic.

**skargardin** (8.615): No one did it like Missy and Timbaland, such a strong album.

**waluigiest** (8.308): This is a great project! She has great bars, fun beats, beautiful melodies at times, and it’s all tied together by the interludes.

**sufjancaesar** (8.231): You can’t really go wrong with this sound. It’s just good ass nostalgia. Very classic and very comforting. For that reason, this album isn’t really as exciting as the other albums tbh, but it’s certainly the most evocative

**welcome2thejam** (7.923): Some absolutely devastating beats, as expected from the all-time top-tier Missy/Timbaland pairing

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.808): I can see why she’s the queen but Trina outsold

**akanewasright** (7.738): the thing about Missy is that she’s never *bad*. She always has incredible energy, smart wordplay, and the ability to ride whatever beat is thrown her way. Some tracks here are pretty obviously *special* (ala Work It) while others aren’t as much that, but she’s consistently at least good, and often great.

**fadedblue09** (7.731): An album that is definitely deserving of its classic status. With well delivered themes, you can see how it was influential not just on rap, but also in genres like pop and how it contributed to the soundscape of the mid 2000’s.

**slimboyfriend** (7.692): Missy strikes such a good balance between being heartfelt and just having fun/flexing on everyone.

**plastichaxan** (7.646): i wish i liked this more, Missy is one of those artists i’ve been wanting to get into for a while cause she innovated a lot and while i really like this maybe i just had a high expectation for her or just wanted to like this more

**bigbigbee** (7.500): I watch a Korean dance competition show called Street Woman Fighter and the sheer amount of Missy Elliott used on that show is unreal. Her influence that even over 20 years later, she’s being spun halfway across the globe! All of the women in this rate are amazing, and I’m not even sure this is my favorite album…but I just love Missy so much. She is so important to women everywhere, both in music and in general. Also the amount of support she shows to other artists in this album is amazing. Oh, and I love how she “talks to us” throughout this album. I don’t think it would work for every album, but it’s perfect on this one.

**vayyiqra** (7.231): Quite a throwback for me, this album had the most songs I recognized (even deep cuts) from the 2000s. It's not all nostalgia though, because it stands on its own even today and I agree with the hosts it's the album that's aged the best.

**babadork** (7.223): I love Missy, so I thought she was going to have my highest average in this rate. I guess I forgot that I really don’t like most of the songs from this album that aren’t in my Missy playlist. The best songs are really great, but Missy has really bad taste in men.

**bornskinnyhomo** (7.192): Missy served on this album, with Slide being by far my favorite!

**indie\_fan\_** (7.169): I have a bit of bias towards this one as this is actually the first ever Hip-Hop album I listened to from front to back. Not necessarily my favorite Missy Album (or even one I consider one the best hip-hop albums of its time or anything like that), but it's definitely one that I have a lot of nostalgia for.

**frogaranaman** (7.154): the beat choices on this album are ON POINT

**celladonn** (6.885): I went into this expecting it to be my favorite album of this bunch but I actually think it's my least favorite! It's still a lot of fun though

**IIIHenryIII** (6.731): I am kinda disappointed? I came to this with really high expectations since Missy is the most successful out of the four, but she ended up having the least enjoyable album. It's definitely not bad. It just ain't for me, I think. *Work It* is the only track I truly like. Who am I, though? She doesn't give a shit about my opinion. Good 4 her!

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.192): the worst album in this rate imo - i’m sure missy has better but i think she’s outdone by the other 3 women here

**throwaway-7650** (9.423): it's a fucking game and she's the queen. eve RATE WINNER!

**sufjancaesar** (8.615): I had a fucking great time listening to Scorpion. Eve has my fave hooks, they’re so catchy and her electric delivery sells the shit out of them. For me, also the most consistent album in the lineup

**buddhacharm** (8.500): scorpi moon 😃 SCORPI VEEN 😁 mmm 🥵 SCORPI SUN 👅

**akanewasright** (8.338): this is probably my favorite in the rate? Like… it feels both consistent, with a diversity of sounds and flows, with as much fun as the others. The last few tracks sag a bit unfortunately, but overall it just fucks

**fadedblue09** (8.000): Among the four albums, this one’s the most gritty and hardcore with its approach to rap, and Eve has the most impressive flow of the four. At times, it also feels less accessible than the others but she makes up for it by having some of the more personal and revelatory lyrics.

**skargardin** (8.000): The album's a bit uneven in the second half, but I absolutely love Eve's flow throughout the album!

**nt96** (7.885): An iconic album of the decade. It dragged a little towards the middle but I think it closed off pretty well.

**celladonn** (7.808): There are some incredible tracks here but I kind of feel like there are too many features and not all of them work. Not enough Eve on this Eve album

**thedoctordances1940** (7.508): Legitimately one of the worst album covers i've ever seen

**vayyiqra** (7.385): Despite not being that big into Eve before now (other than "Let Me Blow Ya Mind", yes I know, basic) I enjoyed this album more than I thought. It's not the kind of hip-hop I would normally be into but I'd go back to it and listen to it gladly.

**waluigiest** (7.385): I think it gets lost in its features

**letsallpoo** (7.308): the men kinda ruined this one

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.269): fractional

**jackisboredtoday** (7.262): a few fantastic highlights that made for obvious smash hits on an album that’s way too long and stuffed… wait i started writing a review of the wrong Scorpion. Anyway Eve’s album would probably be the most consistent here if it didn’t kinda fall off on the last few tracks, and I enjoyed it (her flows and the production are both top notch) but kinda wish there were a couple more songs where everything else comes together to make the full package a clear winner

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.192): for sure the best album in this rate, was so pleasantly surprised because i’d never heard any of her music before this rate but she was amazing on every song

**1998tweety** (7.038): Eve 6000 ended ha

**indie\_fan\_** (7.038): Eve's best work, hand down. With her most commercial and accessible, but she still makes it work thanks to her voice and rapping ability. To me, Eve's the most talented out of the four on here if we're talking simply PURE RAPPING ability.

**welcome2thejam** (7.000): Wasn't feeling it the first time around, but I'm coming back around on it. Just a solid album overall, a few meh tracks but also a nice handful of standouts

**frogaranaman** (7.000): Drake sounds weird here

**plastichaxan** (6.808): Someone told me i wouldn’t like this much and when i started listening i was like ??? why would they think that but then the second half of the album came and… this had the potential to be such a great album…

**IIIHenryIII** (6.654): This album sounds better as background noise. For real, I enjoyed it a lot more on the first time I played it on my speakers while playing video games.

**bornskinnyhomo** (5.885): Had never heard of Eve before, and this was a great album. Sadly I thought it was a little front-loaded.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.893): this SLAPPED

**sufjancaesar** (8.607): Not to compare bad bitches but Trina really is the baddest I can’t lie. Diamond Princess is brimming with charisma, stank and confidence - interwoven with some heartfelt, personal themes

**waluigiest** (8.429): this was my surprise favorite of the rate. It really was ahead of its time.

**nt96** (8.414): As someone who partly grew up in south Florida, this album was quite the nostalgic trip! A lot of these soundscapes were quite prominent around that area for years to come. I can hear the palm trees swaying in the wind already!

**akanewasright** (8.214): Trina deserves more. I know she’s easily the least known person here, and that shouldn’t be the case. She’s been hailed as the most consistent female rapper of all time, and I’d say that’s pretty damn true! She *always* gives it her all, and this album is just one of many Crown Jewels in her discography (it is my favorite though, and the one I’ve spent the most time with). A good chunk of the songs here were genuine 11 contenders, and even the songs that aren’t my favorites feature good verses from Trina. If you liked this stuff - listen to her other music. Jump in anywhere, and you’ll get this level of quality.

**plastichaxan** (8.086): my favorite album for sure, Trina has found a new fan with this rate this is litrally the cupcakke blueprint and i mean that as the highest compliment

**skargardin** (7.929): Now this was so solid! I hadn't listened to much Trina beforehand, but this was definitely an album I would want to revisit.

**fadedblue09** (7.679): The only rapper I had 0 familiarity going in, I must say I’m really impressed by this. The songs here have lots of poppy elements, but Trina manages to make her rapping the highlight in most of the songs and she never compromises her flow. Shame that half of them are region locked on my Spotify tho

**babadork** (7.364): Trina is the most consistent rapper in this group. I gave some of the filler songs a low rating, but I never have any complaints about her flow.

**vayyiqra** (7.357): The only thing I knew about Trina going into this rate was "Pull Over", which is quite a banger, so I expected more of that dirty rap kind of style, and I guess she delivered. A very solid album from beginning to end.

**slimboyfriend** (7.343): She knows we're all put on this earth to be horny

**celladonn** (7.286): I wasn't familiar with Trina before this rate but I'm glad I am now! Quite enjoyed this album, it's a shame it's not on spotify in my country

**welcome2thejam** (7.286): Couldn't really keep the momentum of a killer first track, but I do like what I heard out of Trina and it recovers at the end with my favorite discovery of the rate. So this album is at least bookended with fantastic songs. Does suck that we were a Lil Kim feature away from getting all four of em in one album

**IIIHenryIII** (7.057): it's definitely not bad, just ain't for me. There's not one single song that I fell in love with, but I feel like I might revisit a couple of tracks.

**frogaranaman** (6.643): THIS ALBUM'S INTRO IS SO FUCKING FUNNY LMAOOOOOO

**bornskinnyhomo** (6.393): I really enjoyed this introduction to Trina, but damn a couple of the songs really just missed. She has an amazing voice and I saw a lot of Cardi B in her, and I suspect she was definitely influenced by this amazing rapper.

**indie\_fan\_** (5.650): TBH, I'm not exactly a huge Trina fan with her voice being my main turn off. That said, I'm going to set some of my bias aside for the sake of having a fairer rating.

**nt96** (8.611): Lil Kim really was ahead of her time with her vibrantly colorful visuals and fashion sense. It's a shame that there's such strange disconnect between her influence and Nicki's, as if Nicki did this first. In a perfect world, I can see them making an iconic collab, but due to the unending beef, I'm afraid we're passed that now.

**sufjancaesar** (7.917): For me, this album took the hardest swings of the 4. Which results in some exhilarating highs and a couple of confusing lows. Overall, the risks pay off in some of these insane samples and lyrics

**akanewasright** (7.750): This album is a little doomed in the rate for its long tracklist and inconsistency, but like… when it’s good, it’s the best material in the rate. Kim is an incredible talent and an undeniable trailblazer, and while this album has bad moments, it does exactly what it had to do. Lil Kim has been the victim of a lot of sexism throughout her career - whether from people claiming her success came from Biggie (that he wrote her verses for her/made her what she is), from gossip outlets that pitted her and Foxy Brown against each other, or from people decrying her use of her sexuality in her music and image. This album… honestly it does everything to refute those things. She proved herself as an entity in rap without Biggie helping her, she doubled down on the things that made *her* special, and she doubled down on the nastiness of Hard Core in some places while proving her versatility in others. Kim is nothing short of a force to be reckoned with, and while this is not a perfect album, the best parts of it are genuinely unstoppable

**skargardin** (7.444): This probably had the most filler out of all the albums in this rate. That being said though, the highs were REAL highs.

**ricki** (7.322): this didn't need to be so long

**babadork** (7.211): Of this group, I liked Lil’ Kim the least when these albums came out. Back when I had to pay for music and didn’t get to listen to a lot of full albums, I had the idea that she was usually either sexy or serious, so it was nice to see more sides of her. I tried to put aside my feelings about her relationship with Biggie and how he treated her, but I did struggle rating some of these songs.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.194): I’ll be real this was pretty mid

**bornskinnyhomo** (7.056): The obvious standout for me in this rate. Lil’ Kim had serve after serve, and to me I found her open sexuality very powerful and exciting.

**celladonn** (6.972): I think this could probably do with a few cuts because it is loooong and there are a few songs that really don't work for me, but overall I was impressed with it

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.972): ATE!! kim has insane charisma on every track on this album, but this album would have benefited from cutting a few songs

**welcome2thejam** (6.944): Lil Kim confidently walks a real tightrope of raunchiness and references throughout the entire album, and for the most part I think she pulls it off

**waluigiest** (6.944): I wasn’t so keen on this album, but the last third or so is really special

**indie\_fan\_** (6.589): Definitely Kim's most pop-friendly album. I know this album is a favorite among fans, but I actually have a lot of mixed feelings on this record.

**vayyiqra** (6.333): Alright, well. I feel bad because I didn't have time to dig into this album fully, since it's so long and I did this ballot in a rush (which is my excuse for any weird or bad takes I may have made), and Lil' Kim was the artist I knew least in her (other than "How Many Licks"). I didn't not like it, but I see why it got some mid reviews. It is overlong and has some dubious lyrics even for the time period. Still, there's enough material on here I like that I would listen to it again and give it another chance.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.306): I think this is the best album out of the four. It definitely is the most creative. It has some really original tracks, and all of them sound different from the other. I really like this one! It's not a perfect album at all, I mean, it becomes kinda disappointing after the eleventh track, but I enjoy it and I think it might grow on me.

**fadedblue09** (6.139): TA very fitting album title….cuz this album is certainly notorious, having the most explicit lyrics and themes. At times, it’s almost comical and I can see how she’s a precursor to people like Nicki, but overall the long tracklist and handful of questionable songs make this an uneven experience.

**frogaranaman** (5.611): well
