Hello raters of r/popheads and welcome to a long overdue rate! This rate is a significant one in rate history as not only is it the first rate featuring exclusively rap albums by women, but it is the first time we are rating *any* full length rap LP’s by women who are not Nicki Minaj ~~no reputation does not count~~. The longhand title is [**Legendary Female MC’s of the 2000s**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/396894460128133130/914697511392915466/00sFemaleMCs.png) but I will probably just refer to it as “2000s MCs” or “Legends” as shorthand. I am beyond excited for this rate, not only because I just really enjoy the aspects of hosting a rate and the creativity behind it, but because *god* I cannot wait to see people discover these incredible four albums and all the diverse qualities and amazing lyrics and catchy beats and fall in love with them like I have.

#[Introduction](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/866838013626941470/913624479211589682/men_am_i_rite.JPG?width=595&height=595) 

I think to appreciate these artists and these albums fully you’ve gotta understand the industry when they were coming up, because while they are undeniably trailblazers and had to fight for their places, they were by no means the first women to make it in rap and have many influences and peers who it would be unfair to go without mentioning. The first solo female rap album, which came only 12 years before the earliest in this rate, [Lyte As A Rock](https://open.spotify.com/album/2i8QflzkUsxQOhHHCiJiVm?si=UxKwP-_oTOSRFjTb8vGBfA), was released when MC Lyte was only 17, and with many tracks written when she was much younger. Her debut single [I Cram to Understand U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw1WbJFi5oI), written when she was only 12, is an early account of her experience around the crack epidemic in New York. In 1993, her single [Ruffneck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGbn6eaZmCY) became the first song by a female solo rapper to be certified gold in the US. It would be difficult not to find a rapper, regardless of gender, who’s not influenced in some way or through some line of inspiration by MC Lyte.

While all these achievements are remarkable, it has to be noted that they are mostly records for *solo* female rappers, as women did have a position in rap prior to this, it was just only under the format of groups or collectives. Even in the 90s, rappers like Lil’ Kim, Foxy Brown and Eve rose up in hip-hop collectives before they found stardom on their own ([Junior MAFIA](https://imgur.com/BcyzAdQ), [The Firm](https://imgur.com/NwoxmtX) and [Ruff Ryders](https://imgur.com/bXbVRQh) respectively). Salt ‘N’ Pepa are undeniably the most successful female rap group not only of this era but of all time with two top 10 hits ([Shoop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vaN01VLYSQ) and [Whatta Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEmH1EgJbEs) and six further top 40 hits. Their early singles [Push It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCadcBR95oU) and [Let’s Talk About Sex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydrtF45-y-g) were ahead of their time in how they discussed sex from a feminine perspective without surrendering power or dominance. Their most successful album, 1993’s [Very Necessary](https://open.spotify.com/album/2W2EmEpud13QHlhCFS9P8g?si=atG20rKvT5OXAyw1MT_fgA), ends in a [three minute long skit about a girl who catches AIDS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h2DsNeLpUk), in effort to raise awareness around sexual health and the spread of HIV. 

Of course not all successful acts of the 90s limited themselves to just rap music, one of the most acclaimed rappers was Lisa ‘Left Eye’ Lopes of TLC, a group that made primarily R&B music which Left Eye would enhance by rapping over. Only a teenager when the trio formed, she had some incredible verses and bars, some of my personal favourites being [her verse for the *Panther* (1995) soundtrack](https://youtu.be/qxyxqVDjSzs?t=102) and [her verse from Donell Jones’ song ‘U Know What’s Up’](https://youtu.be/W2mEjkBmDQo?t=146). Another successful rapper from this era is Queen Latifah, even though that might not be the first association you make with her because of how incredibly she’s built her career off of it, she began as an MC. Getting her start beat-boxing for female hip-hop groups in New York, she carried that energy throughout her whole music career, her most known songs [U.N.I.T.Y.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8cHxydDb7o) and [Ladies First (feat. Monie Love)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qimg_q7LbQ) centering around female empowerment and especially the uplifting of black women. 

An often forgotten legend of the 90s is Da Brat, who’s innovative blend of rap and old school funk music set her apart from her contemporaries. Her debut [Funkdafied](https://open.spotify.com/album/3wQuZdfDboB8bo5MPTUpgA?si=VO5MaQa2SPq3VhmFEdON-A) was the first female rap solo album to be certified platinum in the US, featuring three top 40 singles [Funkdafied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfpR9jKy0IQ), [Fa All Y’All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lkAUMHypM0) and [Give It 2 You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLt1lhbtKM). Though on popheads Da Brat’s possibly most likely to be recognised for her frequent collaborations and remixes with Mariah, especially [Heartbreaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyjuUu_XDZ8). And finally in this prologue to the events of the rate and whistlestop tour of female rap before the early 2000s, we have Foxy Brown. Foxy was seemingly set up for legend status in the late 90s, her debut album [Ill Na Na](https://open.spotify.com/album/6qLC4weRVEetELyQQgkAMk?si=byDbxiwyT_u-tRcvN8lDCQ) in 96 broke the record Da Brat set with Funkdafied, to go Platinum even quicker in under three months, and it is easy to see why with smooth bangers like [Get Me Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4zJVGGkN78) and [collaborations with the likes of Jay-Z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qQ5BRy-K1A), which funnily enough became both of their highest charting song at the time, peaking at #7 on Billboard. But her later attempts to recapture the magic of her debutant era were mostly unsuccessful, the lead to her sophomore release, [Hot Spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4wB7yne0gA) only charted at #91 and the following album was met with middling reviews. Unfortunately the only way her name resurfaces today when it comes to the rap world is remembering or rehashing her infamous, and ongoing, feud with Lil’ Kim. Which is a shame because while their disses to one another are iconic, be it in interviews or album tracks, their case is such a clear example of media manipulation and how the press and the men around the two women turned two former friends into arch rivals, a rivalry that peaked in a literal shootout.

Without these trailblazers and so many more I didn’t have time to mention, the four albums we are rating simply would not exist. These four albums take themes explored before, like feminism, grief, sex positivity, crime, fame and revolution and lift them to a different level. Featuring a star studded lineup of features and producers (Timbaland, Mary J. Blige, Kanye, DMX, CeeLo Green, Grace Jones to name a few) and some of the best rappers of all time, I can’t wait to stop wasting your time and actually get into these albums.

# [Missy Elliott - Under Construction](https://resources.tidal.com/images/d40b644e/372d/4f3a/9272/dfc91e7a8f23/640x640.jpg) 

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6DeU398qrJ1bLuryetSmup?si=9Pb8-hPCTSaIRdiPTnUTsQ) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/under-construction/254167732) | [YouTube](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kJ07CA7r2NYvWMcX40KRaE4vDl8Fa3olc) | [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/album/533965) 

> What happened to the good old days  
> When hip-hop was so much fun?  
> House parties in the summer y’all  
> And no-one came through with a gun

\- *Back in the Day (feat. Jay-Z)*

Debuting at #3, Missy’s fourth album was released in November of 2002 to rave reviews and has only aged better and better. The only album of these four we are rating to be nominated for Album of the Year at its respective Grammys, it is now certified double platinum in the US, making it Missy’s best selling album. Despite being only just over a year since her eponymous third album, [Miss E… So Addictive](https://open.spotify.com/album/20t54K6C80QQH7vbcpfJcP?si=WWgmZ-YgRSOaMDD7SDzTUA), which features the iconic [Get Ur Freak On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPoKiGQzbSQ) and [One Minute Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XayUCLgxS5c) ([which actually has a remix featuring Trina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-CJXwQJZaM)), a lot happened in that year for Missy to sit with and marvel at and turn into what would become, *Under Construction*. This album is dedicated both to victims of the September 11 attacks, and Missy’s dear friend and collaborator Aaliyah, who passed only a few weeks before 9/11. Missy (and the iconic Timbaland) had known Aaliyah as long as they had both been in the spotlight themselves, having produced almost half of her sophomore album [One In A Million](https://open.spotify.com/album/79EIRdmpPSIWfRlxaZdJbG?si=a_LiGadNSXCBaRLLCY5vIQ) and remained close friends after too. The closing track of Under Construction, [Can You Hear Me? (feat. TLC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKDU3c_gDz8) encapsulates the themes of the album well, being a message from Missy as well as T-Boz and Chilli of TLC to their dearly departed Aaliyah and Left Eye, who died in April of 2002*, right as Missy began work on the album. Additionally, Missy sings to Biggie, Tupac and Big Pun, the former two whom both died in drive by shootings of a east/west coast hip-hop feud, harking back to the themes Missy and Jay sing about on [Back in the Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCQRKbO2e2E), wishing for the violence within the community to end. It wasn’t only Missy in this rate who was close to Aaliyah too, [Kim also became a close friend of hers due to them being label mates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPwfc37bTBI) and Aaliyah even featured in probably one of the most iconic and pastiched music videos of all time, Kim and Lil’ Cease’s [Crush On You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6yC4KXGixE). 

It wasn’t only Aaliyah that Timbaland produced so prominently for though, Missy and Tim co-produced almost all of Missy’s own music, including the entirety of Under Construction. [Work it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjIvu7e6Wq8) became both of their highest charting song at the time, ironically though it is the only of Missy’s three top 3 hits to be in collaboration with Timbo. Her Ciara collaboration [1, 2 Step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBHNgV6_znU) peaked at #2, with production by Jazze Pha of Ciara’s label, and her final top three hit, [Lose Control (feat. Ciara and Fat Man Scoop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na7lIb09898), was actually entirely self produced. And it is not just herself she produces for, in fact some tracks on Trina’s *Diamond Princess* are also produced by Missy. Missy’s hand in her own lyricism and production is consistent across her discography, with her being the co-producer on ten out of thirteen tracks, to Tim, and lead producer on the other three, including [Nothing out There for Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evNsbrS83hQ), a Beyoncé collaboration from before she had even put out any solo work. In fact, Missy’s list of collaborators on this album may not be as ample as her competition, as she conquers more than half the album solo, but the features she does have are undeniable *stars*, and her eye for aesthetics doesn’t slip in this era either, beyond the video for Work It, [Gossip Folks (feat. Ludacris)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYKI8tAELXY) features her signature choreography and cohesive costuming, with the added twist of half the video having them all colour corrected to appear like aliens…. Or as much like aliens as they could with 2002 technology. 

Overall, it is clear as day why this album is called *Under Construction*. Missy herself saw her life, and her music, as very much under construction. The sudden deaths of so many close to her made her realise how fleeting life can be, and how much she still has to say and accomplish, and while for anyone else this album could simply be a victory lap of an already astounding and trendsetting entry to the industry, this is just another Missy album. And a brilliant one at that.

# [Eve - Scorpion](https://resources.tidal.com/images/765c3560/9482/4747/896a/33a8e0d8044d/640x640.jpg)

> Yo, I can understand why they scared of Eve  
> Thought I did it one way ain’t prepared for me  
> Mad ‘cause an image I don’t care to be  
> Realness, real shit, spit reality

\- *Who's That Girl*

Eve got her break in the industry under DMX and The LOX’s label Ruff Ryders Entertainment, following a [brief, unfruitful stint under Dr. Dre’s label Aftermath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmH5nkVA6-8). Dre’s relaxed attitude to recording and hyper focus on the newly signed Eminem did not mesh well with Eve’s undivided eagerness to rap, leading to her being dropped. However Eve thrived in the hypermasculine environment of Powerhouse, the home of Ruff Ryders, having come up through [battle rapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_rap) in the local, rising Philadelphia scene. While she is proudly a Philly girl, Eve cites New York and specifically Yonkers a second home, due to her pride in her position as ‘The First Lady of Ruff Ryders’, as shown in Scorpion album track [Scream Double R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ezIjHqxWr4). Eve pulled from a number of different influences in the creation of *Scorpion*, a big fan of rock herself, she blends that style in with the hardcore rap she perfected under the guidance of DMX and producers like Swizz and DJ Shok. [Let Me Blow Ya Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wt88GMJmVk0) features Gwen Stefani, at the time most known for being the lead singer of *No Doubt*, as Eve wanted a collab between a rap girl and a rock girl at the time. ‘Blow Ya Mind’ went on to win the first Grammy ever awarded for “rap/sung collaboration”, being both of the artists’ only solo Grammy wins to this day.

On the complete opposite end, [No, No, No (feat. The Marleys)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7J2lrCRcHo) is a reggae track sampling Dawn Penn’s 1994 song of the same name, making use of the brothers’ transporting chilled vocals and Eve’s ability to tell a story through her lyrics. One of my highlights of the album, [You Had Me, You Lost Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R14g4kYsuo0), is a brilliant showcase of Eve’s lyrical talent, with her recounting the tale of the fallout of a juvenile relationship and moving on from it, ending the final verse with the lyric *”Now hate me forever while the chorus goes around”*. The album is titled Scorpion to represent Eve’s Scorpio side, and while that evidently is present, there is also an apparent reservation in her sting. Coming out of the era of Foxy and Kim’s widely publicised feud and the East/West Coast rap war, Eve’s approach to combat was remarkably less aimed and instead served to showcase Eve’s strengths, rather than highlight anyone else’s flaws.

Eve’s aggressive style of rap can be affronting at first, but reflecting on her legacy now and the influence she has had, it is hard to imagine her any other way. [Gangsta Bitches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG-PA0ZYlpI) featuring fellow female rappers Da Brat and Trina is a perfect statement piece for everything Eve represents as an artist; a show that just as good as her more complex lyrics are, she is at her peak when the prompt is braggadocious. And Trina and Brat compliment her amazingly, making it a true showcase of unapologetic women in rap.

# [Trina - Diamond Princess](https://resources.tidal.com/images/65003996/d7b1/4881/a314/7a51a81bb278/640x640.jpg)

\- *Hustling*

Hailing proudly from Miami, Trina is our answer to the question [“What if the City Girls could rap?”](https://youtu.be/XnjsEJnmsIc?t=64). Described by XXL Magazine as [the most consistent female rapper of all time](https://www.xxlmag.com/trina-is-the-most-consistent-female-rapper-of-all-time/), Trina’s ability to paint a perfect pornographic picture with her lyrics is almost unmatched even twenty years later and her infectious southern charisma brings them to life brilliantly. She’s the definite outlier to a [popheads crowd](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DKTOEboVoAIWuk_.jpg) when looking at the four names in the title, she doesn’t have Eve’s [compelling pop collabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNXX0dODIMM), Missy’s [well documented industry recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9zN9hrrgB0) nor Kim’s [notorious public persona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3uveQkzwyI), but that doesn’t mean she should be underestimated or brushed over here. After a string of nothing short of iconic features on Trick Daddy tracks, including [Nann N\****](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaFqyJG8ung) and [Shut Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp2b0CMuq6M), Trina began her solo career with a bang putting out the album [Da Baddest Bitch](https://open.spotify.com/album/5tXpmutwVnXITJLptIssVU?si=YZezEds2SWajxm11q3lVwg), including the timeless [Pull Over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grmJsiGf5Bk), which remains to this day her only solo Billboard 100 chart entry. While the album wasn’t quite the same commercial splash that the other members of this rates’ debuts were, it was a critical success and firmly carved out her own niche in the industry, which allowed her to form connections and long lasting friendships and cooked up the perfect storm which was *Diamond Princess*.

Trina fought to have more input behind the scenes in the creation of her second LP, she was the star and she wanted her pick in producers, her pick in collaborators, and to be able to write what she wanted to write, and it paid off. Closing track [Do You Want Me? (feat. Bathgate)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRruKFjVKqo) is a production highlight on the album, being some of Kanye’s earliest work, and features Trina and Bathgate rapping back and forth with amazing chemistry. Another production credit of note that you might recognise is none other than Missy Elliott, who not only produced the *Tweet* feature [No Panties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKyxTanhnh8), but even guested on her other song on the record [Rewind That Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_RSlZcPooo). As she admits on more than one occasion on this album, Trina is a [Nasty Bitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjEtE3mVu0w), and that is something she leans into. I am firmly of the opinion that sexual lyrics are just as valid and can be just as intellectual as lyrics tackling serious issues, as shown with the adroit *“Third time I come I’m breezing, The ice just keeps on freezing, Hold up I’ma keep it going, back to back I’ma keep on blowing”* on [B R Right (feat. Ludacris)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw7ukmZVQHg), another of the Kanye tracks on this album. Trina rarely ventures into too serious topics, at least on Diamond Princess, but when she does she floors it, as shown on [U & Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVTFSLvqwes), where she sings about a lost friendship and all the things they had been through together. 

Throughout her career Trina has run into the neverending issue of not being taken seriously, be it from serious musical publications or simply her male contemporaries, stemming mostly from the fact that she is a hyper-sexuliased female rapper who is not doing it for the pleasure or with the approval of the men around her but for herself, and she refuses to change that. Without Trina’s unabashed confidence in both her writing and the auteurship of her own work, female rappers of today like [Flo Milli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76e_EbDbFhE) and [Junglepussy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StwsqxbjQoE) would not be able to write what they write or rap how they rap, and she deserves her flowers for that.

\- *Off The Wall (feat. Lil’ Cease)*

There is an argument to be had over whether Missy or Kim are the “big name” coming into this rate. If you look at it from a lens now, it is undoubtedly Missy, who’s legacy has far surpassed her few years at the peak of her fame, in contrast to Kim, who’s footprint and influence on almost everyone her junior is unfortunately often understated, as she sings in the titular diss track to not only Foxy Brown but anyone who had feuded with Junior MAFIA, [Notorious Kim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0P0VSQ3mT8), *“Girls say they different but uh see, in all actuality they wanna be me”*. But one thing is for certain, at the turn of the millennium when the female rap game was hotter and tighter than ever, even if Missy had the charts advantage and might’ve been [winning more awards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GheCnRMVT8), Lil’ Kim had the name and face recognition. And in an industry so reliant on positive relationships with your peers and being ahead of whatever trend was coming next, that name recognition was worth its weight in gold. On [Custom Made (Give It To You)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOBRDYOLa3g) Kim brags about the cash she is rolling in, over a sample of her mentor, and partner, Biggie’s [Gimme the Loot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMayh7FhLGE). Kim’s relationship with the Notorious B.I.G. was complicated, he was responsible for signing her and getting her her break, featuring her as a member of hip-hop collective [Junior M.A.F.I.A.](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3r0OeTcOw37N9juMYyyw39?si=Xw9nBwLpR4mLM4tBLDiB7g) and consequently setting her up for her big break and what would become her debut album, [Hard Core](https://open.spotify.com/album/39xHAZmTUSQJyXt6ebpjKT?si=lNTz-WHQTNihwo62-zPlcQ). But like most of Kim’s professional endeavours, it rippled through her personal life too, as she sings on [Don’t Mess With Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxdFi7izGig), he (Biggie) was so infatuated with her he would hide her birth control pills, until she discovered his wife, Faith Evans, was also pregnant with his child, and she would go on to have the child aborted. 

Kim’s lyrical genius is greatly downplayed too, [Revolution (feat. Grace Jones and Lil’ Cease)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJVqLDE0P2o) shows this off incredibly, with Kim using her bars to tell a fictional mafia story of drug runs and misfired guns, highlighting her versatility from her still incredible, but slightly more repeated salacious lyricism. Few truly revolutionised the rap game like KIm did when she came onto the scene, where all the rappers before her, the aforementioned MC Lyte, Salt ‘N’ Pepa, Queen Latifah, had all been challenging sexism in hip-hop, Kim brought her sexuality to the forefront, toeing the line between owning her own sexuality, and attempting not to lose ownership of it. Her [iconic May 2000 XXL Cover Shoot](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51FRUyWWcdL.jpg) literally was known to cause prison fights between inmates fighting to jerk off to it, a feat she proudly mentions on [How Many Licks? (feat. Sisqo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhCD9qxlczo). But beyond just the issue of eroticism, *The Notorious K.I.M.* deals with a number of other themes, lyrically and musically, from the cheesy 80s recollection of a drunken encounter in [Right Now (feat. Carl Thomas)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GddJtFauLE) over a sample of the classic [Tom’s Diner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4jtIDaeaWI) by DNA, straight to [Aunt Dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO4fkiCMWRw) featuring the fictional “Lil Shanice”', a song where Kim personifies her period and the pain it brings and the way it changes her mood. 

On her sophomore LP, Lil’ Kim succeeds in breaking out of the shadow of her peers within Junior MAFIA and her mentor the Notorious B.I.G., an incredible feat when you consider the album is named after him. Kim proves she is much more than her controversial and sometimes violent public persona, that she can experience hardship and struggle tenfold to what her competition are going through and still rap circles around her male counterparts.

One more thing! This is a rate I feel most popheads won’t be familiar with *most* of the music, bar perhaps Missy’s biggest singles and Eve’s songs with Gwen, I imagine these four women are more public personas and musicians the sub’s userbase will have heard of, rather than artists who’s discographies they will actually be familiar with. Furthermore, given this is our first female rap centered rate [that doesn’t feature Bhad Babie](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/gc8ewh/upandcoming_rap_girls_rate/), I think it would probably help people to have somewhat of a stepping stone, as just looking at the playlist with all four albums totalling nearly four hours can be pretty daunting. 

That’s why I put together an [**Intro to 2000s MC’s playlist**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1dP3UKFxam2VsBCXylR8Tw?si=8d02ac011f9e4a0e) (which you are encouraged to save and listen to on your own!! It is filled with bangers and will help you get into this rate, and this era of female rap too), comprised of about a dozen songs by varying artists I spoke about in my introduction of this post to help you understand where the genre was at this point, as well as six songs from each album in this rate that I feel give you a good feel of the album and should hopefully draw you in! Singles and deep cuts alike.

I contemplated putting together a bonus rate for this rate, but given the already lengthy runtime and how unfamiliar of a genre it will be to the sub, I felt that might be me getting a bit ahead of myself. But hopefully this rate being selected at all, and this mini history lesson of a playlist will put enough people onto these artists that we’ll be able to have more rates centering on, what I consider to be, the golden era of women in hip-hop.

And for some additional reading, u/indie_fan_ has put together some incredible posts the past few months, on [women in hip-hop across each of the last 4 decades](https://www.reddit.com/user/indie_fan_/comments/pn174o/a_look_back_at_women_in_hiphop/) that I would seriously recommend

#Rules

Most of you know all of this, but if you don’t, **please** read this!! And if you then still have any questions about the rate process or the formatting of your ballot or anything, feel free to ask away :D 

- You must listen to and submit a score for every song, **ballots with missing scores will not be accepted and you will be asked to submit a score**

- **Each song must be scored between a 1 and a 10 (with exception of an optional 0 and 11).** Scores are allowed to one decimal point but no further, meaning you are allowed to score something a 5.5 or a 9.7, but a 5.42 or 9.75 *will* make the rate machine act all goofy so please don’t. ^(Also please make sure to use periods and not commas for any decimal places)

- Your 11 and 0 are reserved for one song each in the whole rate. This is *not* one per album. You aren’t obligated to use either of them at all, but in this rate **a comment is required alongside the song you are 11’ing or 0’ing**

- Please [*please*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RoxNxt6oI4) **use the message format linked in this post**, and if that doesn’t work, just use [**this pastee formatted ballot**](https://paste.ee/d/75K0s/0) and send it to me with that.

- If you want to change any of your scores after you submit them, **message me on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Awkward_King&subject=&message=) or discord (king!#2326)**. So long as it is before the final due date that should be okay :)

- **Your scores are not considered confidential**, you are free to talk about them once you have submitted them (you are also free to keep it all to yourself til your reveal) ~~meaning I am also allowed to publicly drag the bad ballots I get~~

- Including comments in your ballot is not mandatory (with exception for your 0 and 11), but is a lot of fun, however if you do include any they **must be formatted like this**:

> Hustling: 11 nrs just want cock in my mouth

Any other formats will simply be rejected, such as:

> Work It: 10, Ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gniht ym tup i

> Right Now (feat. Carl Thomas): 2.5 - the blueprint for Megan’s Don’t Rock Me To Sleep

> Scream Double R (feat. DMX): (7) alexa play stoggaf by cakes da killa

- You can also leave album comments, but if you do, **make sure you put a colon at the end of the album title**, for example:

> The Notorious K.I.M.**:** can’t decide if i preferred the horny songs or the ones abt gang crime or the ones abt both 

- Finally, and this one should be obvious, **do not sabotage songs or albums**. You are free to dislike certain projects, and have that reflect in your scores, but if your average is low enough that it looks like you are just being a dick, **make sure to include justifications in your comments**, or just shift the criteria/scale you are scoring on. If you submit a ballot with a suspiciously low average (typically <4), then do not be surprised when you are asked to provide further clarification or it is ultimately rejected
