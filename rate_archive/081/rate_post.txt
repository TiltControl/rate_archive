The UK Main Pop Girls Rate!
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/dqt7fm/the_uk_main_pop_girls_rate/

### The United Kingdom

Yes Americans, there are more countries than just your own, and yes their artists do make BOPS. On this sub, way too often is Rita Ora called a flop for not charting in the US even though shes a record older in the UK. Welcome to the **UK Main Pop Girls Rate**! This rate serves as an opportunity to explore 3 of the biggest female artists in the UK. We'll be rating I Cry When I Laugh by Jess Glynne (you know her as the Rather Be girl), Glory Days Little Mix, and Pheonix by Rita Ora (the girl on Black Widow)! All 3 of these pop albums saw huge success in the UK (and unfortunately couldn't replicate that success in the US). What matters though is that they're gonna get the justice they deserve here!

# Jess Glynne - I Cry When I Laugh


*Note: The tracklist we are rating may not be avaliable on streaming in all countries, YouTube links will be provided below.*

I'm gonna be honest this isn't the Jess Glynne album I stan so idk what to say here. ICWIL was a smash album debuting at #1 on the UK album charts. The album produced 2 #1 songs (5 if you include the ones that were thrown on the deluxe edition). The singles here are HUGE bops, Take Me Home (my fav Jess song) in particular has so much emotion packed into it and gives Jess the chance to show off her powerful vocals. I will be dissapointed if y'all rob that song.

# Little Mix - Glory Days


*Note: We will be rating the original solo versions of Touch, No More Sad Songs, and Power; the remixed versions will appear in the bonus rate.*

The biggest ~~Western~~ girl group of our time, I'm sure Little Mix needs now introduction. After Black Magic, Glory Days became LM's first album to debut at #1 on the UK Album chart and produced their 4th #1 song (along with 3 top 5 hits). A year later the Platinum Edition was released with 4 new songs (which we'll be rating)! Depending on who you ask, you'll pretty much always get a different answer behind the question, "What's your favourite Little Mix album?". Salute, Get Weird, Glory Days, or LM5. Ask them about their fav LM singles though, and chances are it's either Black Magic or one of the songs off of Glory Days (although if I'm being honest there really is no wrong answer since 90% of their singles are excellent). Shoutout To My Ex, Touch, and Power have all quickly become Little Mix classics. Singles aside, the rest of the album delivers too. Between the Meghan Trainor penned You Gotta Not, emotional ballad Nobody Like You, and raunchy sex bop Private Show/Beep Beep/Freak/honestly half of the album, there really is something for everyone here. It might not be their most inventive and adventurous album (that honour goes to LM5), but it's definitely what the gays would call "pop perfection".

# Rita Ora - Phoenix


5 years after her debut album, we finally saw the release of Rita Ora's sophmore album Pheonix. Unfortunately the album only peaked at #11 on the UK Album Chart (compared to her Ora which peaked at #1). This was probably because the lead single came out a year and a half before the album did, and it also didn't help that Rita released over half of the album before the release date. The singles performed quite well though. Anywhere and Let You Love Me both went top 5, with Your Song and For You going top 10 as well. Girls, a song featuring popheads fave Charli XCX, sparked much controversy and discussion here, unfourtunately it could not replicate the success of the previous singles and didn't even go top 20. Chart performance aside, this album is chock full of bops. Despite being half made up of singles, every song on the album fits well; there really is no filler here.

# The Bonus Rate

The bonus rate is pretty much just here so that I could include the Little Mix remixes cause they're technically on the album. Could've done Rita's newest collabs but her previous non-album singles are way better so we're doing with that. Jess will be taking the L on this one.

I will not accept ballots that are not arranged correctly.

* You can **DM me at any time if you wish to change your scores** before the deadline.

* DO NOT SABOTAGE. I will **require your album averages to be above a certain unlisted threshold**, and **if your scores do not meet the threshold I will require you to redo your scores until it is**. The threshold is the same across all users.

* If you feel strongly enough about a song to give it a 0, it's encouraged that you pair it with a comment explaining why, again to limit chances of sabotage.

That's it! Use the link below to send me your scores and feel free to ask any questions (I'm Dusk on the popheads Discord server if you'd rather ask there). DM me to change your scores any time before the deadline currently set to **December 1st**. I'll probably have extensions for a week or so (it's exam season so that time is a bit busy).
