**Lowest Scores:**

---

I'm gonna be honest, this is literally just here cause I wanted each artist to have the same amount of songs in the bonus rate.

---

**rotating3Dtext** (6): more hair salon music

**ManofOranges** (5): you know what i don't hate this either but there's just nothing going on like the song goes nowhere i don't even get how jess glynne is a feature on here when all she does is whisper like two lines

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I have to respect that Jess is going for that old-school dance diva thing and collaborating with all these DJs who are making songs that’ll only be heard deep in the bowels of the club scene, but I have no interest in music like this.

**skargardin** (3): This never went anywhere remotely interesting

**jamesfog** (2): What is this mess lmao it's not even real

**TragicKingdom1** (2): i feel like this was mislabeled on spotify or something because those do not sound like jess glynne's vocals?? i can't find any info though

**rickikardashian** (1): this feels like the shitty EDM music DJs sometimes try to play on clubs that absolutely no one likes because you can't dance to it, but there's also nowhere to sit and the music is loud as hell so you can't talk to people so you're standing there all awkward with an empty cup because a drink is fucking expensive

Honestly, the song is pretty decent outside of having Chris Brown on it. There's not really much reason to have Chris on any track when you can easily replace him with someone else.

---

**jamesfog** (10): Guilty bop, Player by Tinashe teas

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): why does every chris brown song we rate have to be a bop

**sailormunelune** (8): This would be a 10 if it was a solo

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Why do people keep thinking that doing a Chris Brown collab will be good for their career? (Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 don’t interact.)

**bbfan132** (7): chris is trash but i kind of like this rip

**Tolk1en** (5): the maximum I can reasonably give featuring Chris Brown

**rotating3Dtext** (4): why rita

**ManofOranges** (1): originally i was just gonna give this a 1 and call it a day but i ended up listening to it and was relieved to realize that i don't like it anyway

**rickikardashian** (1): I'm not even going to listen to this song. I'm tired of having to do rates with this man. I don't like him. I don't like him as a person, I don't like him as an artist, there's nothing good about him. If we ever rate Fine China, aka his one good song, call me and I'll angrily give it like a 9, but I'm done having to keep on adding Chris Brown scrobbles to my last.fm

Meghan Trainor penned...yeah. The beat is cute at points, but the bad lyrics unfortunately overshadow everything else. The Blues Clues is iconic though we'll give her that. ~~Also the lines about wanting a "man who acts like a man" are super problematic but let's not get into that.~~

---

**ManofOranges** (8): ok kind of a bop but the lyrics to me are a bit grating to me

**skargardin** (8): The blues clues lyric caught me off guard AGAIN goddamn

**waluigiest** (8): more Meghan Trainor energy but it’s more interesting and layered so I’ll allow it

**jamesfog** (7): Blues Clues lyric iconic

**jexan13** (7): it's a bop. good thing I'm a dumb latino and I don't understand the lyrics.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): is you afraid of blue's clues

**ImADudeDuh** (6): wow this is very meh

**letsallpoo** (5): the key change is excessive

**sweetnsoursauce1** (4.5): honestly one of my least favourite songs by them

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Sorry Meghan… I love you but the writing on this song is rough. The actual concept and structure are decent but the actual lyrics aren’t good. Like… are they suggesting we dump people because they don’t love The Weeknd? Um………..

**vayyiqra** (4): they gotta write better lyrics than these, whoever wrote this song

**CarlieScion** (1): this song turned me into a MRA

**selegend** (1): this album is the definition of shit vs perfection

**rickikardashian** (0): This is probably Little Mix's worst song as it fails in so many aspects. It's bland, mean, unoriginal, and it's incredibly dumb, which usually is not a problem, not every song has to be a 5 minute ballad filled with metaphors and complex rhymes, and Little Mix is a band that doesn't take themselves too seriously all the time and some of their best hits are just fun pop songs, but they were completely unable to make this song feel authentic to them. I consider that the one of the band's biggest strengths is their ability to completely sell you the songs they sing, they commit fully to whatever feeling the song wants to showcase, yet none of the girls sound like they believe what they're singing. This has the same energy of a Kids Bopz cover, or 4 friends singing Karaoke to a song they've heard only once. The lyrics are the worst part of the entire song by far. I believe in the old saying *"Men ain't shit"* and understand that a woman has to have standards to not end with a worthless piece of shit, but the reasons the guys "gotta not" are shallow and completely unrelated to each other, and that's without mentioning that most of them don't make sense and were only written to create lame rhymes. The song tries to be fun, sassy and empowering (apparently, based of the bridge that speaks to all the women in the world), but it just comes off as stupid and mean. This is just a gif of a woman sassily waving her finger turned into a song. Sonically it's alright, but it's nothing they hadn't done before and it would probably fit better in *Get Weird*. *You Gotta Not* is just a Meghan Trainor song so and, she didn't even take it, and for some reason LM's team thought it would be a good idea to buy it. [e: Also, I originally gave this a 1.5, but every time I thought of this song I got so fucking angry I just realized I had to give this shit a 0 to make my soul happier]

In hindsight, we should've rated the acoustic version here instead, oh well. There's not much to be said about this song, it's kinda chill but also doesn't really take off. It is impressive that it beat You Gotta Not though.

---

**ditacarlita** (11): this song still gives me goosebumps all these years later

**jamesfog** (9): Acoustic outsold

**vayyiqra** (7): i have a lot of nostalgia for the early 90s given that i was a baby then. this is a catchy song and grabbed me instantly even if it doesn't have much variety in the lyrics which makes it come off like a remix of something else

**rotating3Dtext** (6): hair salon music

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.3): I blinked and I missed her feature but this would be fine in the background of a club I guess

**CarlieScion** (5): this is pretty boring tbh

**waluigiest** (5): this is too boring to play in the club

**jexan13** (4): the acoustic version is not interesing and remixes like this are always vastly inferior to the acoustic/original, so, this is the worst song on the album

**ManofOranges** (3): i don't even know what's going on with this one

**Tolk1en** (3): when does the song ctually start

I was actually surprised seeing this so low, I like the song a lot. Their vocals go well together (maybe a little too similar though), and lyrically the song does a good job of standing out from the rest of the album. Oh well.

---

**waluigiest** (8): chill and clever

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I mean it definitely sounds like a Julia Michaels track but I think that Rita holds on to her signature sound well. I think Julia Michaels has gotten more mileage out of other artists but this is decent, I like the hook.

**CarlieScion** (7): julia lowkey outshines rita on this

**skargardin** (7): Made some points tbh but I can't get over how bad their voices mesh together. Good thing Julia's presence is kept to a bare minimum.

**rickikardashian** (6): I feel like this should have just been names High Road, it's what I remember the most of the song idk

**Tolk1en** (6): Unfortunately too repetitive but at least their voices sound great

**vayyiqra** (6): haha DAE julia michaels bad no but really this is okay

**jexan13** (4): more like keep snoozing

**ImADudeDuh** (3): more like WHOlia michaels

**ManofOranges** (3): i hate to say it i hope i don't sound ridiculous but i don't like this song... i mean it could be playing on the radio... i would skip it immediately... sorry to this song

**gannade** (1): this song sucks and idk whose fault it is but it sucks

I actually kinda love the Indian vibe the song is giving off but outside of that it's mediocre and unmemorable. 

---

**CarlieScion** (10): cuz baby now we got [instert joke here]

**jexan13** (9): those drums

**TiltControls** (9): Taylor outperformed

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This sounds like it’s sampling a boss fight from a PS2 game and it’s cursed and I’m totally into it.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): taylor made the more iconic bad blood but this weird drum beat song is ok

**megm26** (6.9): I already know half of the comments are gonna be "Taylor outsold!!!!" or something like that

**ManofOranges** (6): i hate to say it but taylor did it better

**rickikardashian** (6): /*Taylor swift reference*

**skargardin** (4): I really don't like this, the production is way too much and the spelling the chorus makes it even worse

**vayyiqra** (4): bad blood is NOT a bad song and i will defend it wait this is a different song and it's not that good i appreciate that it tries to be different but it's really weird and dissonant and not enjoyable to listen to

**hikkaru** (2): never in my wildest nightmares would i expect to find a song titled "bad blood" that is worse than one of taylor swift's absolute worst songs...

Despite sounding a little barebone, the beat here is pretty nice. The mixing sounds off at some points though, her vocals aren't as loud as the beat and sound a little scratchy at points.

---

**jexan13** (7): not bad but... i need something else

**vayyiqra** (7): this bassline slaps

I don't hate this but I'm having a hard time liking it. The lyrics are weird and don't feel like they making any sense. The rest of the song doesn't know what it's doing either, it's threading the line between being a proper slow ballad and a ballad with energy, but instead of picking a side it's awkwardly shuffling in between.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m actually really into this song? It’s a nice change of pace on this album and definitely one of the most memorable songs, when I was finished I was like “remember that song about ice cream?” Like, she’s actually calling herself sad vanilla. But it works, I really buy into the situation she describes and I find myself empathizing with this character that she creates. Sometimes that’s really how heartbreak works, you’re just kind of, like, eating ice cream and being sad. I’m not sure *why* Emeli Sande is there since it doesn’t make sense for the song to be a duet, but she sounds good so I won’t complain. Hearing the two of them belting so earnestly about being sad vanilla is so delightfully campy I have to love it.

**jexan13** (10): maybe it's the fact that its melody doesn't sound like all the other songs in here, but this is very good. The delivery is amazing

**waluigiest** (9): I don’t know what this means but like...... it is not as serious as it takes itself and it’s so good

**megm26** (8.6): Jess and Emeli's voices sound amazing together, they both have such beautiful soulful voices and the vocals on this song really shine.

**skargardin** (7.5): Emeli outshines Jess in every way on this song

**ManofOranges** (7): very interesting metaphor to use

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): ok maybe I don’t like her voice that much in this

**vayyiqra** (6): it's not a great song and a weird concept but i too am white and sad so i can't hate it

**letsallpoo** (5): a good description for jess overall

**selegend** (5): saddest vanilla indeed

**agentofscranton** (4.5): emeli sande deserved to be an adele but ended up a leona lewis rip

**gannade** (4): is she dragging herself lmao???? also emile sande makes r&b for white people

**hikkaru** (4): owl city - vanilla twilight outsold

**ImADudeDuh** (4): Lana del Rey's favorite ice cream flavor

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): ?????????????

This is bad but it's fun bad, I think. The lyrics are bad and I'm not a fan of that drop or the beat. Also wtf at the end of the song it sounds like there's someone coughing/barking in the background, drags it down even lower.

---

**gannade** (10): this is a guilty pleasure

**jexan13** (9): the Daenerys reference aged poorly (or greatly?), but despite that, the energy of this song is amazing. It has a dissapointing drop but at least is not, ahem, Power levels of bad.

**waluigiest** (9): I will not stand for this anti-teacher rhetoric!!!! Otherwise slaps hard

**Tolk1en** (8): bitchy pop power

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is such a weird song but low-key I give it a pass because that drop is sooo good.

**vayyiqra** (7): oh my god this is embarassingly 2010s and i kind of love it this is like nicki on dextromethorphan

**jamesfog** (6): Aged Black Widow copy

**rickikardashian** (6): if there's already 4 bad bitches rolling in the Royce, I don't think there's plenty of room in it

**ImADudeDuh** (3): I hate this weird drop

Another song I'm not sure how to feel about, I like the instrumentation, but Jess's vocals sound pitchy and strained all throughout the song. At least she's improved a lot since then.

---

**jexan13** (9): there's something in the melody that i think is brilliant, but i can't really pinpoint it.

**megm26** (6.8): honestly kinda boring tbh

**vayyiqra** (6): i guess someone took her home as she asked that was nice of them

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): She made this a single? Okay. It starts off kind of cool but it quickly becomes plodding, and her singing here sounds a little painful.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): if someone were to ask me "what kind of music does jess glynne" I don't know what i'd tell them.

**ManofOranges** (5): yup... this exists

I loved ADIDAS, but this just doesn't click as hard. It's fun but it's also pretty cringey. ADIDAS was similar but felt like it had more effort put into it and was more polished. A lot of the lines here are meh and take away too much from the song. It's a guilty pleasure tho. 

---

**ManofOranges** (10): every bone in my body tells me that i shouldn't like this song... but it's so endearing and catchy. this song also proves that traffic is the true villain here

**rickikardashian** (9.8): I know this will get dragged for not cursing and being a bit childish (even tho it's one of their most explicit songs), but just like I defended *A.D.I.D.A.S.*, I'll defend this because I think it adds to the tone of the song, as if it was still like a little naughty secret that you don't want to tell completely, and not so it's more family friendly as other people suggest, because as much as it sounds like a doo-wop love song, most parents won't let their kids sing along "I love making love to you". ~~-0.2 because the sentence "boy you're so sexy, just like a Cadillac" makes no sense~~

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): There are people who say that the lyrics to this song are bad… those people are WEAK and natural selection is coming for them.

**jexan13** (9): Little Mix: "think I broke the stick, dreaming all day about jumping on your -beep-", Shakesphere: throws all his work into the trash because he'll never write something as iconic

**megm26** (7.4): they have a lot of songs about having sex huh

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): cute and fun lil bop

**vayyiqra** (6): this is like the beatles wrote an extremely horny song using a bunch of car metaphors and well i guess it's different i respect that

This bops a decent bit but kinda got stale. I know it's not *that* long, but I feel like I still would've preferred it if it was under 3 minutes. Not really sure what's going on with the last 30 seconds when the song should've ended 2 minutes ago.

---

**CreepyMannequin** (10): why isn’t this on US Spotify…...a bop

**ManofOranges** (9): me to every man i've found remotely attractive

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Why isn’t this on Spotify? It’s good. She switched up her delivery a bit and it really helps the song stand out.

**megm26** (7.8): this is bop but it goes get a little repetitive though.

**skargardin** (6): This started out promising but quickly plateaued

**vayyiqra** (6): suddenly it's adele covering an ariana song but i don't hate it

Jess kinda snapped here, the chorus pops off. Not the biggest fan of Tinie Tempah (what ever happened to her?), but he's not awful here. 

---

**skargardin** (9): Radio fodder, but some damned good fodder

**TragicKingdom1** (9): a huge summer bop that will probably be robbed because popheads is misandrist. periodt.

**agentofscranton** (8.5): tinie tempah really just dropped off the face of the planet after being like one of the biggest names in the british music scene at the start of the decade - same with emeli sande, olly murs, the vamps and all those lot

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I mean, I’m grooving, but I probably won’t remember this tomorrow.

**vayyiqra** (7): this really slaps and i would rate it a bit higher but i want tinie tempah to go away he sounds like off-brand kanye pitched up a bit

**megm26** (6.5): I love Jess' chorus but I don't really like the rap

**letsallpoo** (6): this was alright until jess's part started

**ManofOranges** (6): meh

**ImADudeDuh** (5): remember tinie tempah? wild

**CarlieScion** (2): destroy all songs with tinie tempah thank u

**selegend** (2): this man is f!cking awful… written in the stars bopped a bit though oop

So I normally love sad Little Mix ballads, These Four Walls, Secret Love Song Pt. II, Good Enough are all among their best songs, but this just doesn't click as hard. Yeah their vocals are great but it's missing that special thing that made their previous ballads work so well. This feels like it has too much going on, ballads are better when they're simple.

---

**jexan13** (9.5): An acoustic version of this would likely be a strong contender for the 11. The vocals of this, the sadness, the dark atmosphere... get washed away with EDM elements that really don't fit. It is still great

**rickikardashian** (9.2): I listened to this album so much when it first came out, and surprisingly had no memories of this song, which is a shame because it actually is so good. I feel like Little Mix was built to sing ballads, because Everytime they do so, they kill it

**Tolk1en** (8): beautiful

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): the vocals are amazing (as always) but until the last minute it just falls flat for me

**vayyiqra** (6): as sappy ballads go it's better than average i guess

**ImADudeDuh** (4): why is this album boring

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Not to be too stereotypical “popheads hates ballads” but like… filler. Their performances are impressive, they’re dripping in emotion, but the song just takes too long to build to anything so it feels slow and boring. They’ve delivered solid ballads in the past but this is just so flat and plodding it feels like a waste of their talents.

**ManofOranges** (2): color me bored out of my mind

I've already written plenty of essays about this song here on this sub so I won't bore y'all with another one. Instead I'll link letsallpoo's comment from last time we rated this cause he summed it up perfectly. 
"I think the reception of this song is one of the uglier moments in the pop music scene from last year. A lot of the criticsm was justified, like how the song was written by several men (and it shows), and how it bears similarity to past problematic songs like "I Kissed A Girl" (which Rita even cited as inspiration). But a lot of the criticism got strangely personal, especially to Rita, who as the lead artist was assigned the blame of her song's failure. I feel bad for her, because I do think this song was intended to be a revelation of something that was deeply personal to her - yet even the song itself doesn't seem interested in that, because the only personal detail we get in three minutes comes from the first line: "Her name was Laura." It quickly became clear that Rita was unintentionally entering a conversation that she was completely equipped to deal with, and I wish she were treated with empathy instead of attacks on her sexual orientation. Everybody loses when that happens.".

---

**CreepyMannequin** (11): This song came out right around the time that I came out as bisexual, so it honestly resonates a lot with me. Lots of the criticism of it seemed to not actually come from bi women, which really bothered me. This song deserved a lot better but culture critics really went at it for no reason.

**jamesfog** (10): Fuck Hayley Kiyoko

**Tolk1en** (10): an iconic collab

**agentofscranton** (9.5): i love this song, controversy be damned

**jexan13** (9.5): how daer that rita oral try to convince us that bisexaul poeple exist?!!1!! Cancer her!

**ManofOranges** (9.5): i'm sorry but i like this song and i have no regrets

**letsallpoo** (8): this is better than all of hayley's new songs

**vayyiqra** (8): i do not sabotage in rates but i am probably rating this highly partly because i know it's going to sabotaged and i think it's a good song aside from The Discourse about its lyrics which i do not want to engage with here at all ty i will not be taking phone calls for the rest of the afternoon

**rickikardashian** (7.5): Before saying anything… the assays :deadbanana:. Anyway, ignoring the whole "straight women using lesbianism to pander to the male gaze" thing, this song feels way too much like music producers choosing whatever girls they have available to make a fun pop anthem, that it just doesn't work. A lot of the lyrics, especially Charlie's and Bebe's, feel like they're tiptoeing around the topic of lesbianism, as of they were trying to make them queer enough to fit the song, but not queer enough to have to label the artists as LGBTQ+. Surprisingly, the one that committed the most to the whole theme was Cardi, but still was mostly "Tonight I'm fucking a girl" than "I consistently like women". The most sincere part of this track was Rita saying pretty explicitly that she likes both women and men, but the rest of the song just feels so manufactured and that's the biggest problem to me. I wouldn't care if it was a song about a girl hooking up with another, because at the end of the day that does happen, people experiment all the time and they can still consider themselves straight, but listening to this I really don't believe they have played with a vagina that isn't their own. It truly is a shame that this song had to be so damn messy, because this could have easily been the best song of the album. The production is a thousand times more interesting than all the other songs, it had a killer lineup, it has a pleasing build-up to the climax, and the melody and hook are catchy as hell. Had this touched this topic in a more tasteful way (or even better avoided the topic and sang about idk, girl power or something) this could have been straight-up pop perfection, but instead we're left with Bebe Rexha yodeling and "kush loving".

**skargardin** (7): no comment

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.8): bebe is absolutely atrocious on this lmfao

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): i'm bi and i was super excited for this song and it rlly just didn't reach expectations

**rotating3Dtext** (4.8): this song is kinda a trainwreck

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): How do you assemble this kind of pop dream team and then instead of “Lady Marmalade” give us “Ms. Smuckers?” I’m not even going to touch the controversy surrounding this song but all I’ll say is that you can get away with a song like this if it’s good, and this just… wasn’t good. I gave it a few points because it has an ounce of catchiness to it but that’s the only redeeming factor.

**waluigiest** (4): yah this was ignorant. It’s too bad because it’s one of the more developed and interesting songs on the album

**CarlieScion** (2): bebe ruins yet another perfectly average song

**bbfan132** (0): bye, this is boring as hell and the lyrics are terrible

**gannade** (0): not even cardi could save this song

**ImADudeDuh** (0): cancelled sis!

The chorus on this song is actually ridiculously good, unfortunately the song gets a little too repetitive in the post-chorus though. Sad cause this is probably one of the strongest deep cuts on the album.

---

**jexan13** (9): i don't know if this stands out because it's a very good song or because it's different to the previous songs

**megm26** (8.4): love the disco vibes and the choir this is such a bop

**vayyiqra** (7): this is a bop and i love the early 90s dance sound of this

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Jess I’m starting to get tired of this song. This had a fighting chance at getting a good score but once I got to the part where she was just going “hey yeah” over and over again I had to admit that this was literal filler.

**ManofOranges** (6): cute but i am unphased

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): tk im so fucking bored

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this sounds like it would be the end credits of a generic 3D animated movie that you can tell had no heart put into it and had a poop joke in the original trailer of the movie

Another LM song that's unfortunately not that great. I really don't like that weird alarm beat in the background, it's so annoying. The rest of the song doesn't have much going for it either, it has some of their worst vocals and the lyrics aren't a standout either. 

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Actually one of my favorite Little Mix songs, not even kidding. Screams blaring, alarms sounding, demonic vocals warbling… literally every element of this song sounds intimidating. This sort of unhinged energy is something that I don’t feel like we see all that often in pop songs, I really feel like letting my freak out when I hear this. I also think this song has a ton of replay value, it was one of my most listened

**gannade** (9): ummmmmm inch resting

Ok the verses and pre-chorus on this are a massive serve, queen of bops. The drop is...ok. I mean it's not *bad*, it definitely could've been a lot worse, but it does take a little away from the song for me. That last chorus is great though.

---

**CarlieScion** (8): possibly the only good addition to this hellhole of a re-release

**jexan13** (7.5): Imagine taking a song with nice verses and prechorus... and ruin it with a horrible generic EDM drop. Must be the same people who sees a smiling puppy and they go and kick them. This is like the third 10 worthy song in Glory Days ruined.

**ManofOranges** (7.5): the drop sounds a bit like someone hyperventilating but who cares it sounds good

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its good oh wait the drop isnt tho

**vayyiqra** (6): i like the drums but the rest is mid (also oddly getting a bit of an ariana vibe, yuh yuh)

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This synth/edm/reggae fusion track is probably the most inventive of the new tracks, but it’s also the least memorable. It feels underwhelming, almost like it’s a demo they were going to rerecord later. I guess it’s better to take an old standard and do it well than try to do something weird and end up milquetoast.

Charli Puth is an absolute king. Now that that's out of the way, this song is pretty good. Their voices all go pretty well together. It could've popped off a little harder but it's cute.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Gives me PTSD from Marvin Gaye, but at least it sounds better

**letsallpoo** (10): this is a good song

**skargardin** (9): Oops! They did it again

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): apparently i'm weird for loving this song but i'm not ashamed

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): HoNEStLY I enjoy this song, i’s cute and silly. I love how innocent the song is despite the sexual content, it’s like a lil romantic comedy. Low-key this is one of my favorite songs by Charlie Puth, I think he rises to the occasion and holds his own against the girls, which is a bold feat.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): cute

**rickikardashian** (7.9): In the pre-Attention days, Charlie got a lot of criticism for not being able to sing about sex convincingly in songs like *Marvin Gaye*, and honestly I never really got that ^(~~mostly by the fact that I was real young when this came out~~) and felt like it was just people shitting on him just because he did pop music. Relistening to this years later, god, Charlie Puth truly couldn't sell sex during his debut era. I can not believe for a single second that sweet sounding, pitch-perfect Charlie Puth is having sex with any of the Little Mix girls, or anyone really. Still, the song is pretty cheeky, and I've always liked when LM kinda sang in a cutesy way about stuff that are a bit less pg

**CarlieScion** (6): i know what you did last summer but make it meghan trainor

**hikkaru** (6): pre-attention charlie puth was a mistake

**jexan13** (6): It's not terrible, but... the feature doesn't add too much and it's overshadowed by the other better slow songs.

**ManofOranges** (6): i didn't like this one when i first heard it but somehow i got some kind of stockholm syndrome while listening to it so now i actually like it a little

**waluigiest** (5): Meghan Trainor energy

**vayyiqra** (4): i hate whistling and who is charlie puth anyway = britney outsold

I love this song but it's weird that Rita picked it as the closing track. Soul Survivor, Falling To Pieces, Velvet Rope and Hell Of A Life (which closes the standard edition) all sound like they could've reasonably closed the album. Nonetheless, this song is a serve. Rita displays great vocals and the lyrics leave a lasting impression on you with the album finishing.

**CarlieScion** (10): call out that shitty label miss oral!!!

**gannade** (9): why is this rita track actually good

**jamesfog** (9): Vocals

**jexan13** (8.5): what a strength

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ok she took us to church, a white church, but a church nonetheless

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): me when jeff probst is about to award me with a million dollars

**ManofOranges** (6.5): she's a survivor she's not gonna give up she's not gonna stop she's gonna work harder

**vayyiqra** (6.5): better ending

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I think she put this song at the end of the album because it’s big and cinematic but it’s also, like, kind of boring? It just feels so thin, her voice doesn’t carry this like it should.

**selegend** (2): end this
