I like Stormzy's verse. When it was first released a lot of people were saying we should've had a female rapper on this instead, but I feel like Nicki would just make it all about the power of her pussy which is *fine* but I also really like getting a song with a big male rapper agreeing with the message that women are powerful. 

---

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): easily the best of their remixes, stormzy's verse does the song justice. my only complaint is we miss out on one of the motorbike parts

**TragicKingdom1** (10): fixes all the problems of the original and adds a pretty great verse from stormzy that's actually on topic! this is how you do a pop song remix

**sailormunelune** (9): the Stormzy rap can go

**skargardin** (9): Contrary to the other remixes on the album, stormzy actually greatly improves the song

**CarlieScion** (8): stan the only good man stormzy

**jamesfog** (8): Solo better [2]

**ManofOranges** (8): stormzy's verse just doesn't fit imo but power is such a hit that it doesn't matter that much

**rickikardashian** (7): I'm only rating Stormzy's verse since the song remains the same, but it has an added verse in the place of the bridge. Honestly his verse is pretty nice and it has some lines that go with the song well, although I feel like him being "we can be a powerful couple" feels a bit like a man being like *I wanna be included too:)))*

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): He’s sooo sloppily edited in to this song it’s like they didn’t tell them he was gonna be there and didn’t let him listen to the song while recording, but you know what? At least he’s  not shouting ever ten seconds like Kid Ink did.

**jexan13** (1): the atrocious, rage-inducing drop is still there. Also, since the bridge was one the best part, some puppy-kicking-maniac-genocidial war criminals decided to eliminate it and shoehorn a f*cking rap feature instead.

On album release week this song was one of the ones I listened to the most. It bops so hard. Usually I prefer an actual bridge instead of just getting the pre-chorus again, but I feel like this works well. Also Rita knows how to not needlessly drag a song on, only 3 minutes long, the song doesn't get much of a chance to annoy you.

---

**CarlieScion** (10): this is a straight up banger

**ManofOranges** (8.5): don't have much to say about this one. it's good though

**rickikardashian** (8.5): You've heard of "chopped vocals replacing the chorus" and "Rapper feature replacing the bridge", we'll get ready for "Chopped vocals replacing the bridge"

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): The album has really started to pick up at this point, but I’m noticing that a lot of Rita’s songs feel kind of underwhelming? Like there’s good ideas in this song but they weren’t fully fleshed out, this is good but it feels like the bones of great.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): literally the day i heard this song was the day the guy i was casually seeing broke it off so tysm rita for providing some relatability

**jexan13** (7.5): The chorus is great (and she sounds like Albania Grande, ugh, her vocals). The verses are underwhelming tho

**vayyiqra** (6): :pensive:

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this album is very bland

I was surprised to see this so high; I mean yeah it's a bop but it's also a deep cut in a rate with a dozen better deep cuts. I screamed at ImADudeDuh's comment cause I can lowkey hear it now.

---

**jexan13** (10): Truly an anti-f*ckboi anthem, with an amazing vocal delivery. The minimal non-generic production really helps the voice of the girls shine.

**rickikardashian** (10): this is a cover of "my man ain't shit // why you won't leave him? // cuz bitch, dick too bomb"

**ManofOranges** (8.5): overall i like this song but there are just a few parts that don't really do it for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I love the trap doo-wop influences on this song but if we’re grading on the curve then they’ve done better. The lyrics are a little weak, but it is one of their best vocal performances on the album. They really go to town here, this is a good genre for singers.

**CarlieScion** (7): gorgeous

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this is one toy piano and one verse about wooden blocks away from sounding exactly like a Melanie song

**jamesfog** (7): Miley outsold

**skargardin** (5): There's way too much going on her vocally for me to appreciate it

**vayyiqra** (5): cheating songs are boring

Say goodbye to the last of the Platinum Edition tracks! Leigh and Jesy in particular eat this UP, Jade and Perrie aren't bad either. This works pretty well for a collab, it does a good job at keeping the essence of the original while still adding that Little Mix flair. Wish the video was better though....

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): actual successful artists and little mix

**jexan13** (10): this ain't reggaeton (afortunadamente, no me hagan @). This is how you do a duet. Also, the girls singing in spanish is truly endearing.

**ManofOranges** (10): at first i heard this and was like "...ok?" but now i get it

**rickikardashian** (9.5): This song was quite big in Latin America, to the point that I was tired of it, so honestly I wasn't too excited about this remix, but now that I haven't heard it in a while, this version is fucking good. The funny thing is that honestly, the best part isn't Little Mix. They do a pretty good job at incorporating themselves and not sounding out of place, but CNCO kills all their parts and are even able to slip some Spanglish, which I usually despise but here it worked well

**megm26** (8.2): ¡Es un bop! ¡Me encanta!

**waluigiest** (8): this album is confusing

**rotating3Dtext** (7): this remix came so late and had little impact on the latin world (still not as irrelevant as the meghan remix of hey dj)

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Of the songs that came out of the “Despacito” Latin wave, I think this is one of my favorites, but as a Little Mix song it’s very middling. They do their best but I’m not quite convinced that they blend well with the track or even (unusually) each other. I think Jesy is the only one who really nails it.

**skargardin** (6): I really don't remember disliking the outro this bad but it just stinks

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): cute but not memorable like 80% of their discography

**CarlieScion** (5): this is such an obv "latin pop is popping atm"-cash grab

**selegend** (4): simon pigwell’s disgusting payola please never do latin music again girls yall are so white british except leigh anne she can stay

**vayyiqra** (0): quite a leap from my 11 with "touch" to my 0 but i knew i would hate this based on this title alone. i hate reggaeton, i hate dumbass "fire-desire" lyrics, i hate everything about this abomination of a song

I LOVE this song, their friendship is so cute! My one complaint is thought is that it's a little too ambiguous for me. I really don't need another song that could potentially be talking about your boyfriend, give me a song explicit about friendship!

---

**CarlieScion** (10): UH HUH UH HUH

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’ve seen negative reactions to this track because “it sounds like it’s from a Disney Channel original movie” but I think that’s what I like so much about it. It’s just so sweet and sentimental, it hits. I know that it’s technically a love song but really it feels more like a song about friendship and the bond between the girls, and I think it plays a lot better that way. It’s an ode to being young and feeling like you’ll be with your friends forever; and even if you won’t, it doesn’t really matter right now. It reminds me a lot of “New Romantics” by Taylor Swift, which is high praise.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): probably filler-ish to some people but i loved this song as soon as i heard the chorus for the first time

**jexan13** (9): Nihilistic queens. The melody in the chorus gives me depression which in a song like this is great (?).

**ManofOranges** (9): I do enjoy this one

**vayyiqra** (7): what song on 1989 is this

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): oh nevermind its kinda boring again

MUCH betta than the remix, Jesy's bridge is so good and elevates the song to a new level. I really like these kinda songs, just like Dancing On My Own it's a song with sad lyrics but boppy production. The juxtaposition is quite nice. 

---

**CarlieScion** (10): possibly my favorite song on this album

**rickikardashian** (10): **adds to my "im sad but I also want to dance" playlist**

**rotating3Dtext** (10): don’t know why I like this song so much

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Did I listen to this a lot after breaking up with my first boyfriend? Absolutely, and that’s all that needs to be said on that. I think the dramatic irony of this song is really interesting, it’s a sad song that’s desperately trying not to be a sad song. It’s a tricky line but I think they balance the dance friendly aspects with the emotional breakup aspects really well.

**jexan13** (8): This is sad, u liars. If the production was not so generic this would be absolute perfection.

**ManofOranges** (7.5): not but i feel like it's kinda plain

**ImADudeDuh** (6): idk this is very awkward

**Tolk1en** (6): this strange sound at the end is just killing the song wtf

I knew this was a fan favourite but I was NOT expecting this to do so well. Yeah it's a bop, but the best deep cut in the entire rate?? At least it's a lot a fun and the chorus bops HARD.

---

**jexan13** (10): This is a serve. The beat at the beggining gets you so hyped, the afterchorus amps it up and you get a powerful and dramatic chorus. A standout of the album.

**selegend** (10): uh maybe the second best song in the rate

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): amazing

**TragicKingdom1** (10): how was this not a single?? simply FIERCE

**CarlieScion** (9): the only good sex song on this album

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is such a whiplash coming out of “Nobody Like You” but I kind of love it? It’s musical equivalent of [this gif](https://media1.tenor.com/images/063c920aadbd43fa2fdd90e4e3660db2/tenor.gif?itemid=10425409), they’re like, enough being sad, let’s hoe out. And hoe out we do! I love how cheap and dirty this song feels, and it has one of the best choruses on the album.

**skargardin** (9): ironically i've liked the trashy bops so far the most

**ImADudeDuh** (8): oh wait its interesting again

**jamesfog** (7): Britney outsold

**vayyiqra** (7): wtf this slaps, it fucks, it bangs, it bops, it tweaks, it shreds, etc. mostly i just love orchestra hits i guess

Love this! It's really cute and the lyrics are nice. I do wish that the last chorus had a little more oomph put into it, but besides that this slaps.

**CarlieScion** (10): elton john WHO

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is a really cute song! I like the sentiment and the sound of it, but I think it needed a little more to get over the edge. It doesn’t feel like it achieves the build it hints at, the ending is too low-key.

**ManofOranges** (9): while i don't like this one quite as much as other songs on phoenix, this is still a hit to me

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): i'd give it an 7.5 but my dad loves this song so i'll give it an extra .5 for him

Avicii :( This is EDM done well. The chorus and drop are the stars of the show and they own it well. I love Rita but she's kinda generic here, I mean she does a good job but she's kinda replaceable. 

---

**jexan13** (11): I was really on the edge about which song I would give my 11. Not because there are many candidates, but because there wasn't one. But the beat of this and the vocal delivery just won me over. This is the best crafted song on the rate. The verses are just amazing.

**hikkaru** (10): ??

**ImADudeDuh** (10): most interesting production so far

**selegend** (10): rip i really liked don’t you worry child too

**skargardin** (10): Rita's got a great voice suited for EDM tracks. This will always be one of my personal avicii favs

**ManofOranges** (9.5): mm very beautiful

**CarlieScion** (9): the chorus is werdly quiet vocally

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): [For reference, this made #30 when we rated it in the Charity Rate.](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7lraxw/rate_reveal_charity_rate_day_2/droidsy/)  I said that it was technically impressive but generic, and then I gave it an 8.5, not sure what I was thinking but I think I was on to something there.

**rickikardashian** (8): The Genius Page of this song is kinda hilarious because someone truly took time out of their day to do some serious ass analysis in some of the lines, comparing some of the lyrics to Aristotle and explaining the figures of speech used in the song

**vayyiqra** (7): :(

Her album might be a bit boring and similar at points, but when Miss Jess brings the bops she BRINGS them. The chorus and production are great, message is nice too.

---

**hikkaru** (10): bop!!!

**ManofOranges** (10): me to myself every day

**skargardin** (10): This is Jess in her prime, pandering with incredibly relatable lyrics and a banging beat, whew

**TragicKingdom1** (10): if you can't appreciate a good self-empowerment anthem then pop is NOT the genre for you

**jexan13** (9.5): the chorus is amazing, the damn piano is infectious and the bridge is a highligth of the entire album

**CarlieScion** (9): bop

**selegend** (8): so cheesy… but i bop. i bop.

**megm26** (7.8): I love a good slightly generic motivating bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): It’s not realistic, but it’s a bop. Actually, this is the point at which the album started to wear on me. I feel like Jess is rehashing the same song too many times and it starts to get hard to tell them apart. I think this is one of the better takes on the formula but at the same time one of the less memorable ones, if that makes sense.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this album has no coherence

A mega SMASH and a mega BOP. I wanna say this is being robbed but all the other songs are 10s as well. It's wholesome and cute, so slutbangersheads will pan it. The beat on this is so good, Jess' vocals are good, what's not to like?

**TragicKingdom1** (10): this has like 10 hooks which is the hallmark of good pop songwriting

**waluigiest** (10): I just love the construction - the unexpected modulation pre-chorus into a disco-inspired beat is tasty

**megm26** (8.2): I was surprised to recognize this song, apparently it hit 86 on the US charts. It still slaps 4 years later.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): I like her voice (in this song at least)

**vayyiqra** (8): idk where i have heard this before but it's very catchy

Pop perfection! The production on this song is SO good. They both deliver great vocals and actually have good chemistry. It lowkey annoys me that Rita and Liam are credited equally on this song cause Rita carries it HARD. Too bad it flopped a little cause it's WAY better than the Taylor/Zayn collab and only a little worse than Ellie's. 

---

**agentofscranton** (10): nice of rita to do some charity work

**gannade** (10): rita actually did sumthin here

**ImADudeDuh** (10): YAAAAAS GAY ICONS

**jexan13** (10): Holy sh*t, the energy of this song left me in the ground. Amazing beat and incredible delivery. One of this rate's finest.

**ManofOranges** (10): i have loved this song since day one when it came out one of my favorite songs by rita and probably the only exemplary liam song

**rickikardashian** (10): Already rated this song, and I consider that y'all didn't appreciate how good this song is, but I'm sticking to my decision and this is a 10 and I'm fighting anyone that says otherwise

**skargardin** (10): A SERVE but I know that this will flop just like last time it was rated

**CarlieScion** (9): YOU GOT ME NOOOOOOOOOW

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): First off, is anyone else impressed by the longevity of the *50 Shades* franchise? Like it came out when I was in high school way back in 2011 and I assumed it would be a flash in the pan fad but it’s the end of the decade and people are still referencing it. Another big shocker was how good the soundtrack for the movies were, but in a weird sort of way it makes sense? As poorly executed as it was, I think that the darker, fetishistic-yet-romantic tone of the movies gave a lot of musicians room to do interesting things with the soundtrack. While I wouldn’t necessarily say that this is exceptionally “interesting,” it’s darker than Rita’s usual fare and has a gravitas that really helps her out. Low-key it is one of my favorite Rita songs in the rate. Liam is the weak link here, I just don’t think he really “gets it” like Rita does and she shows him up as a result. I hope the streams this rate generated helped LP1 sales out tho

**megm26** (8.1): the fact that spotify put the lp1 cover when this song started playing... disgusting. It's still a bop

**waluigiest** (8): not bad but I am not feeling the Liam verse

**vayyiqra** (7): oh no it's that one guy from that boy band but also i like the rest of the song a lot

Literal pop perfection. *puts on tinfoil hat* This is 100% a gay coded bop and deserved to have a female love interest in the MV but didn't cause of all the backlash Rita got after Girls. Unfortunate since it would've made the whole moment so much better, but I think Rita was scared and hurt after how everyone reacted to Girls. As for the song it's so so good. The production is great, the drop adds to the song, and as always Rita serves vocals. That moment right before the last chorus in particular is amazing.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): melancholy bop. produced by easyfun of

**megm26** (8): I didn't know this was a Rita song until now, it's a bop. Surprised it didn't chart in the US

**rickikardashian** (7.8): it's a cute bop, but honestly lyrically it's quite empty. Rita sings about a topic that could be way deeper and explored more, but instead the entire song is stuck in "I can't let you love even though I want to", without an explanation as to what happened or why, you straight up heard everything she wanted to say in the first verse. I understand that this was probably just supposed to be a nice jam enjoy musically, but I would rather the lyrics to just be some basic lines about love or partying, because I feel like I'm gossiping with someone that refuses to give me all the details of a story. I straight up counted the phrases, and she only says 21 sentences. This might as well be an instrumental because this says nothing. ~~I actually do like this song and enjoy listening to it, but I just noticed how bland the lyrics are and I needed to vent~~

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this sounds like forever 21 playlist filler

**vayyiqra** (6): wasn't this the title of that selena song with the black and white video

**waluigiest** (6): this feels too long

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.2): I mean girl… just let them? Ladies, is it that hard to just accept love? I don’t feel like she’s offering up any compelling reasons here for there to be an issue. Musically it’s also kind of uninspiring.

Little Mix doesn't do a lot of songs like these, but I love it when they do. Usually their songs go Girl1 sings the verse, Girl2 sings the pre-chorus, Girl3 sings the 2nd verse, and Girl4 sings the pre-chorus, but on this track (and Hair as well) they all kind of jump all over the place, gives me kpop vibes. This bops hard though, people say it's too loud but that's what I like about the songs, it's meant to get you super pumped up. The message is great, the vocals (for the most part, sorry Leigh) are great. A good party jam!

---

**sweetnsoursauce1** (11): I can see why people don't like this song, but personally i LOVE how loud and in your face it is. For LM at the time, it was also pretty experimental, and Jesy's verse goes off. The video is also gorgeous

**hikkaru** (10): "bike bike bike bike bike whoop!" lyric of the decade

**ManofOranges** (10): absolute bop show me one person with good taste who doesn't like this song

**sailormunelune** (10): Aside from “gasoline-y”, this is fantastic.

**rickikardashian** (9.5): I tried to do an essay trying to explain the message of the song and detail that although this song is mostly about sex, a woman feeling confident about her sexuality is empowering and a feminist sentiment on its own…. and then I realized that no one really cares, so I'll just say what I know a bunch of the comments are going to be talking about…………. the motorbike part is funny, but I kinda despise "gasoline-y"

**megm26** (8.3): this is such a bad bitch anthem, I stan. I usually don't like drops in choruses but the rest of the song is so fierce and amazing I can forgive it.

**CarlieScion** (8): what the fuck is perrie singing

**ImADudeDuh** (8): idk this has always been the weaker single to me.

**jexan13** (8): I remember listening to this for the first time. It just dragged me to the ground from the beggining, used me as a mop and unwigged me... Until that drop. I have never seen such a huge abyss between the quality of the chorus and the rest of the song. Also the pre-chorus reminds me so much of Demi Lovato's Heart Attack that it gets distracting... The potential lost, it just pains me.

**skargardin** (8): I don't know if im just in a bad mood today but some of these songs are so incredibly shouty

**TragicKingdom1** (8): pun intended but the POWER behind the drop...too bad it drops a few points for being messy in other respects

**gannade** (7): i liked it when belerghdah said my turn

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I like this song but if we’re being honest it’s kind of a hot mess, it’s a testament to the charisma of the girls that it’s actually listenable. There are fun lines and hooks but the actual song itself is all over the place and I *still* don’t understand why they say “motorbike” at the end. It’s fun to listen to but I can’t give it a good score.

**selegend** (7): no motorbike please no motorbike also the way leigh wore her boots in that video annoyed me so much

**vayyiqra** (7): i hated the intro to this and then i realized i kind of love it as chaotic and messy as it is. a femdom anthem!

Ok I love Little Mix but I don't get why everyone loves this song so much, imo it was the weakest single off of the album. I mean it still slaps and the video is a massive serve but it doesn't have that punch I was looking for. It's a cute post-break-up song that suits the girls' image well so it def has that going for it. I actually prefer the verses over the chorus for once, the beat during the verses is just way too good.

**agentofscranton** (10): tHiS iS uGlY hEaRT

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’ll never forget my first kiss… we were watching a movie on my bed and he ended up on top of me and then he leaned down and kissed me and all I could think was “pretty sure it’s not supposed to feel like this.” Anyways, song is a bop, gets a 10 for personal reasons.

**ManofOranges** (10): this song is a hit i don't even have an ex but like it makes me feel like i have one

**rickikardashian** (10): I'm 100% expecting this song to win, or ending up 2nd to Rather Be.

**skargardin** (10): pop perfection what else is there to say

**megm26** (8): was grateful for exes before Ariana, iconic

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): okay i know this is a bit disney-esque but it was a great lead single and opener

**waluigiest** (8): it’s like good and fuck men so yah

**jexan13** (7.5): it's a bop, but goddamn if the production doesn't feel as inoffensive as it could get.

**vayyiqra** (4): i have a weird, oddly specific test for pop songs: if the chorus sounds like a cola commercial, i don't like it, no matter what the rest is like. this song is a disappointment after all the hype i've heard about it

Ugh this song is so so good, the drop is actually good and the lead up to it slays too. I remember when I first got into this song, I actually talked to someone in math class and felt super happy about it. After class this came up on shuffle and I've associated this song with that moment since (and the whole day I spent bopping to it). The song just has so much energy in it, pop perfection!

---

**CarlieScion** (11): a bop, a classique

**letsallpoo** (11): the greatest song of all time

**selegend** (11): duh

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a lot of fun

**ManofOranges** (10): during the chorus i don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl i am living

**sailormunelune** (10): Listening to this in the car on a hot summer day is chefs kiss

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): easily Rita's best song. Anywhere encapsulates a soft spring sunset and its so light hearted without being too sweet. Would've been my 11 if Power wasn't in the rate.

**rickikardashian** (9.3): Honestly the song is very good, especially in the chorus, but honestly the chopped vocals part is just alright. It's a trend that's been done a million times now, and most the songs that have it sound pretty much the same. Hopefully that just gets left behind in the 2010's

**jexan13** (9): that "bip bip" in the drop is she talking with an alien, she really wants to go anywhere in the universe, ugh her mind

**rotating3Dtext** (9): I love that dumb drop

**megm26** (8.6): I've heard this song so much, I'm surprised it didn't chart in the US. I usually don't like vocal chop choruses but this slaps.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): She really says she wants to go somewhere “nobody knows her name” and then says she’ll go anywhere… why drag yourself like that? However I actually enjoy the song, the chopped vocal chorus instantly dates it but the rest of it is pretty good. “Only You,” the Little Mix/Cheat Codes song, does this template a little better.

**skargardin** (8): I used to think that this was a whole ass ten. But the drop is admittedly very weak, the rest of it is basically generic pop perfection

**vayyiqra** (7): this is a really pretty opener, how to do a ballad without being boring

**gannade** (4): i wanna be anywhere but listening to this song

1998tweety: # Phoenix

---

**Overall Average**: 7.258 **// Average Controversy:** 1.828

---

**jexan13** (8.469): I really didn't know what to expect from this. But I was nicely surprised. As an album it will not make any list of the year or decade, but it has so many bops and truly amazing pop songs. I don't really like EDM drops but here they're not as annoying as in Glory Days. Also, Ora's vocals are amazing and versatile, she can go from dramatic belts to nice whispery vocals and give great song in both cases.

**skargardin** (8.063): This is my favorite album in the rate, but it's lowkey marred by the same problem as the other albums, but to a lower extent. It's singles are great but there is filler. Rita's got the voice to carry the more tepid productions though.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.938): A beautiful collection of singles. Not at all cohesive as an album (probably because it was recorded and released over the course of like 3 years) but there really aren't any super weak points here. [Grade: A-]

**Tolk1en** (7.875): I'm biased and nostalgic listening once again to one of my all time favorite albums. So many cool songs. Rita Ora is one the artist that really got me into pop music.

**rickikardashian** (7.800): It is a pretty nice album, with consistent bops all over, but honestly, I can't tell you anything I learned about Rita Ora besides that she's messy at relationships, at any given point she wants to be with whatever lover she has, and she's bi. You know how Zedd asked for demos of 20 different women singing *The Middle* before deciding who would sing it? Most of these signs feel like they went through the same process, they could have been sang by Demi, or Selena, or Zara Larsson, and they would be the same. This feels more like a collection of loose DJ singles featuring Rota Ora than a Rita Ora album.

**megm26** (7.506): has a lot of bops but nothing particularly special.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.650): The clear weakest link in the rate, Rita is going to get slaughtered and she’s going to deserve it. It’s not an awful album and I do enjoy some of the songs but I think it just needed more fleshing out. The songs just feel underproduced and underwritten, Rita thinks she can carry them off by herself but despite a nice voice she doesn’t have the gravitas to force a project like this to work. I can’t say that this album makes me feel as though she's underrated; for once I completely understand why American audiences are passing over her despite hosting stings on ANTM and cameos in bad movies.

**vayyiqra** (6.344): after meaning to give rita ora a try forever, i'm glad i did because i liked this album quite a bit. it was probably the most consistent in the rate and had a few very pretty tracks. i do think rating the deluxe was a bit of a misstep since the bonus tracks didn't add a whole lot, but overall this is a solid pop album. cool title as well (phoenixes are cool ok). overall rating: 6.3

**CreepyMannequin** (5.313): Unfortunately, as much as I want to like Rita, most of these songs (besides the singles, basically) are filler tracks. They go in one ear and right out the other without making a single impression.

A classic (that should've won a previous rate so it didn't have to lose this one oop). Rather Be takes the best elements of both Jess and Clean Bandit, her vocals work so well with their interesting production. Sorry TK maybe next time!

---

**agentofscranton** (11): it's such a shame when an artist peaks so early in their career - let alone as a feature

**bbfan132** (11): years later and it’s just as fun and catchy as it was when it first came out !

**hikkaru** (11): This is a really easy 11 choice but at the same time I'm very reluctant because I can't stand when artists slap collaborations that they're not the lead artist on onto their own albums. This isn't a Jess Glynne song it's a Clean Bandit song and thus should not be on her album !!!! anyways this is a BOP and a half, and it deserves justice after it lost to Clarity

**jamesfog** (11): Litrally one of my favorite songs of the 2010s whew

**ManofOranges** (11): i remember the 1st time i heard this song i was taken to a different plane like i didn't think a song could sound so good and just so delicious to the ear but it does, and i maintain, to this day, that there are few songs that sound as good as this one

**sailormunelune** (11): modern classic

**skargardin** (11): She better take her rightful spot as the winner this time! It's pretty clear to see why this was both clean bandit and jess glynne's breakout hit, absolute perfection.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): a song on the standard edition of the album in the US! honestly easily one of the best pop songs of the decade, it's one of those songs that are so perfect they become hits in the US beyond all logical explanation

**waluigiest** (11): This song is incredibly slick and is part of the canon for a reason. It’s glitzy, it’s clean, it flows and grows. Really can’t complain about it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Bop. Perfect song. Will probably win the rate and you know what? It’ll deserve it.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): yas iconic bop

**rickikardashian** (10): I feel like this song is the whole reason this album was rated. This whole piece of work is mostly just alright, but Rather Be still feels as fresh as it did the first time I heard it. Usually it bothers me when an album with one amazing song and a bunch of average-at-best songs gets the #1 spot on a rate, but this song is amazing enough that I'll completely support it if it ends up winning

**rotating3Dtext** (10): this is a classic and SO many songs on her album sound like they try to be Rather Be 2.0 i’m TIRED.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): honestly a banger

**megm26** (9.5): such an amazing song, I love the use of strings and Jess works amazing with Clean Bandit as I said before. It came out 6 years ago and hasn't aged a second. This totally deserved to smash.

**jexan13** (8.5): the intro is the most interesting part of the song.

**letsallpoo** (7): doesnt slap as hard at the end of such a...tiring album

**vayyiqra** (6): disco bop but more strings it's okay i guess

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.1): this album has made me tired of jess glynne for the imminent future and this is no exception

**selegend** (4): im sick of this song

**gannade** (2): this has aged like milk. mainly because clean bandit does the same violin melody for EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR SONGS

**jamesfog** (8.667): I loved this album back in 2015

**TragicKingdom1** (8.361): GLYNNCELS RISE UP!!! [Grade: A]

**jexan13** (7.833): I don't know what to think about this album. Its highs are very good but its lows are just totally forgetabble. And I know it may sound a bit nitpicky, but the song titles are so bland. This is the most inoffesinve album og this rate. But goddamn if it ain't so catchy. Also, I really hope you don't hate me but... she sometimes sound like a high-pitched, better-production-aided Shawn Mendes. Like, her high notes reminds me so much of Shawn's in In My Blood that it gets distacting.

**megm26** (7.750): this is a great album, Jess is such a great vocalist and she works with a lot of different sounds. I just wish all of the tracks were on US Spotify.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.739): I’ll have to pay more attention to her from here on out because this album had some amazing songs and was probably the most consistent in the rate, almost to a fault. It low-key felt like the same song ten different times with slight variations but she found ways to keep making it work. It could have definitely used some trimming and it wouldn’t kill Jess to switch it up a bit, but the raw talent and energy are there and they carry the album into greatness.

**waluigiest** (7.611): This album is front loaded with bangers but then kind of loses momentum

**vayyiqra** (6.278): i liked this album quite a lot and its retro house-inspired sound. if dua lipa and kiesza had a baby through some kind of hypothetical gene-splicing technology and that baby grew up to be in her early 20s and trying to quell her low-grade anxiety on a dancefloor, this is what would happen, and i am for that concept. it did have a few weak tracks which dragged it down, but it's decent for a debut album, and could be very good with a few tracks yeeted. overall rating: 6.3

**CreepyMannequin** (6.083): Not a very memorable album but it has some good tracks

I know I've said it over and over again, but WOW pop perfection! This song is just so so good, the chorus bops really hard but the pre-chorus and verses slap too. The bridge serves major vocals. Ghost explained how I feel about this song so much better so read their essay instead.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): I was gonna be quirky and give my 11 to “Your Love” but like… if I’m being completely honest, this song is an eternal bop and the rightful winner of the rate. This was the song that introduced me to Little Mix because when I was first getting into pop music YouTube threw me the video and they were absolutely right, I loved this song when I first heard it and I love it to this day. I don’t throw the phrase “pop perfection” around a lot because I think it’s massively overused, but it’s completely applicable here. When this song starts it’s like Leigh-Anne is slamming the door open and grabbing you by the throat and then the girls just take turns throwing you around the room, and you love every second of it. The lyrics are sexy and fun, the energy is overflowing, and that legendary chorus over that speaker pounding bass is just *it*. This song is a modern classic, end of story.

**rickikardashian** (11): This song is just so fucking catchy and good I feel I don't even need to explain myself, instead, I'll open a debate to talk about that fucking thing Perrie work in the music video. I'll start….. it's fucking ugly

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): we can ignore that ugly ass latex corset to give this bop the respect it deserves

**TheQueenOfVultures** (11): this is my hoe anthem

**vayyiqra** (11): i love everything about this: the synths, the random "hey!!" sample that is used in a billion electropop songs, the harmonies, the cliche "i want to be touched by you and it's ~electric" kind of lyrics, the random dubstep-lite flourishes. i like it enough to not notice that it uses that fucking trop-pop beat that was way overused in the 2010s, which is another oddly specific test i have for if a song is good or not

**agentofscranton** (10): never forget the godawful styling job on perrie in the video

**CarlieScion** (10): the biggest bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Touch? More like 10uch!

**ManofOranges** (10): bop bop bop

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): this song continues to slap

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): still baffled by jade's outfit in the music video for this 3 years later

**waluigiest** (9): cute and a bop

**Tolk1en** (7): Boring chorus but the voices sound great

**jexan13** (5): I seriously don't understand how can this song be so touching in its acoustic version, worthy of the 11, with a vocal delivery that makes me teary-eyed... And such a plastic, forgettable song in its standard form. This gets too repetitive too fast and the production is absolutely generic.

**gannade** (3): dont see the love for it sorry. its very repetitive and generic but not all that catchy aside from the pitchy "just a touch of your love"

**Overall Average**: 7.147 **// Average Controversy:** 1.904

---

**jexan13** (8.056): Its production could be much better as I doubt it will stand the test of time. Almost all songs with a EDM drop feel sh*tty. However, the album highs lie in the vocals moments. Amazing notes, deliveries and harmonies, truly makes you feel a huge potential underneath; this won't be the album that exploits that potential fully, but you can sense the greatness in some songs. The highs are breathtaking and the lows are tolerabe, so, overall, this is a good album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.944): I was OBSESSED with this album in 2017 and relistening to it was super fun, it still holds up really well. Even though I gave a variety of scores to the songs that’s based off of how quality I think they are, in actuality this is one of those albums where I do love (almost) every song. It’s such a crowdpleaser of an album, it’s not as ambitious as some of their other albums but it’s everything we love about pop music. I feel like in a decade or so when we look back on Little Mix as legends, the throwback fan favorites that make everyone lose their minds will be from this album.

**agentofscranton** (7.750): i've literally never heard such a lop-sided album in terms of quality in my life

**megm26** (7.606): each of the girls have such different voices but they work really well together. Honestly though at some point the songs started to get kinda average.

**skargardin** (6.889): The second half of this album completely plateaued for me. There's little of substance to this album, the original singles are all pretty good great but otherwise, this is a no.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.750): The most personality in any of Little Mix's work to date, which doesn't always end up as a good thing because there are some very questionable choices ("motorbike" among them.) That being said most songs here really nail the hooks, especially the climactic final choruses, which are killer. [Grade: B]

**CreepyMannequin** (6.139): Not their best, but plenty of good tracks

**vayyiqra** (5.500): this album was really weird, ironically weirder than their album "get weird" which i enjoyed more. it was all over the place and had some bangers and a lot of filler, and a few just plain bizarre tracks. i like that it tried, but they can do better. however i also realize they don't have a lot of control over the songwriting as i understand it. i do like how this is very much a time capsule of the middle of the last decade. overall rating: 5.5

1998tweety: Thanks to everyone for showing up! 

Rather Be was actually in the lead for most of the rate trading places with Touch until the literal last ballot sent Touch to #1 (Anywhere was also #1 for a hot minute).

Here's my [shitpost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCi-Jyzi2mE) if you wanna watch it again.

rickikardashian: Ever since that pastebin saying how many people's 11 have won, I've overthought my decision, hoping that my favorite songs are the ones that win the rate, and they always end up in like 3rd-10th.Istraight up decided to give Touch my 11 a good second before submitting my scores. Imma stop overthinking these things because this feels like some shit that would happen on a sitcom

1000_nights: Don't be so hard on yourself and Hold your hand are clearly miles better than songs like Power. I guess Jess really does have no fans.
