So I actually like mgk's verse (hot king), but Jesy's bridge is the best part of the song so having it be taken out is a big loss. The video also makes me mildly uncomfortable. 

---

**letsallpoo** (10): i want mgk to raw me

**jexan13** (8.5): the only Glory Days song remix that doesn't belong in the trash. The rap feature doesn't sound bad and the beat is kinda nice. A bit superior to the original.

**jamesfog** (8): Solo better [3]

**ManofOranges** (7): kelly's verse is.... there

**sailormunelune** (7): these rap features are so awkward

**TheQueenOfVultures** (6.2): your my wonderwall

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Machine Gun Kelly is frustrating because like, he’s bad and doesn’t even have the decency to be hot. Which is why it’s surprising that I think he turned in the best rap verse of the three Little Mix remixes in this rate? The song is still better without him but his verse actually fits in to the vibe of the song and his lyrics relate to what’s happening. The bar was low but you know what? At least he cleared it.

**CarlieScion** (1): mgk choke

**rickikardashian** (1): Let's grab Jesy's bridge, that gives the song a lot of depth and emotion, and let's change it for a random ass Machine Gun Kelly verse that was probably made for another song and he just slapped it in this song. Fuck this strategy that didn't work either way because the song flopped still

**skargardin** (1): This is one of my least favorite remixed songs ever, MGK makes this completely unlistenable

The solo is so much better, I still gave it a 7 cause the rest of the song bops hard.

---

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): They clearly were waiting to put a rapper on the bridge of this song

**jamesfog** (8): Solo better

**ManofOranges** (8): don't hate kid ink's verse but i think the song is better without it

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): honestly the songs still amazing with the rap its just SO UNNECESSARY and i like how the second chorus is more muted in the original

**TragicKingdom1** (8): the rare little mix remix that doesn't improve on the song

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): yes… it’s a little bit better

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.5): i mean still a bop but wow what a pointless feature

**bbfan132** (7): was this feature needed??? yikes

**jexan13** (3): in fantasy, there exist blades that can cut through the souls, leaving the skin and bones unscathed. Well, this song would be totally impervious to those blades

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): https://imgur.com/RckCPDl

**rickikardashian** (1): It annoys me way too much that Little Mix decided to take pop songs that were completely perfect on their own and decided to shittily insert some rap feature, and in this case is even more annoying because they also decided to add annoying ass ad libs that fucking enrage whenever they come on. They also fucked up the buildup into the second chorus by just copy and pasting the louder chorus. The only positive thing of this is that we get some little vocals we didn't get in the original, but it's fucking ruined because the guest rappers are talking throughout the entire song. Garbage decision that didn't even make sense because it didn't even make the music video.

Ummm this was actually pretty good??? This is super groovy, and my bff jamesfog says the remix is better so I will definitely be checking that out later.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): We’ve kind of rated this song before, [I myself submitted the original version for the last Charity Rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7lraxw/rate_reveal_charity_rate_day_2/drog6km/) and low-key I was made fun of for being so adamant about not submitting this remix but I stand by that because this remix sucks. The original is perfect, one of my favorite pop songs of all time, and this waters it down. (A watered down 11 is a 10 though, like, Jess isn’t that bad.)

**rotating3Dtext** (10): I love disco ok

**jamesfog** (9): Audien Remix better

**ManofOranges** (8): groovy but too long

**skargardin** (5): This combo should be way better than it is but the hook is so paper thin...

I like the beat in the verses but besides that I find this song to be kind of unmemorable. 

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Oh the album decided to get good again! A lot of the songs on this album feel somewhat formulaic and I think that this is the best one made with the “big house pop” mold. The chorus is catchy (in a good way) and the lyrics are memorable. Plus there are actually *levels* to this song, it’s not just unrelentingly loud like Jess can sometimes be.

**ManofOranges** (7.5): i especially of the song but the rest to me is okay

**rickikardashian** (7): the "no rights no wrongs take it from me" part sounds like a supermarket jingle

**rotating3Dtext** (7): i SWEAR all this songs are the same. like a clean bandit copy.

**vayyiqra** (7): confused where the last two songs went for a bit but anyway i like this disco feel

**jexan13** (6.5): i feel that the songs like this would be much much better if the production was more vibrant

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5.5): tbh i'm getting a bit bored now but ok

**CarlieScion** (5): its at this point i realized that all the songs sound exactly the same

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is half a major bop and the other half terrible

I do like this and it is catchy, but it's kind of on the weaker end of this album. Unfortunately, that's what happens when pretty much every song is a 10. The drop is also just kind of ok and the song doesn't really go anywhere. A bop nonetheless.

---

**jexan13** (8.5): This is criminally catchy, with a cute beat. can't remember the verses tho

**rickikardashian** (8): where is this song supposed to be at? are we in the mall or at the beach or at a parking lot?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Once again, decent ideas, lackluster execution. Did she really have sex in all those places?

**ManofOranges** (6): this song doesn't really do it for me but it's still serviceable

**CarlieScion** (5): this is very. average.

**vayyiqra** (5): song itself is okay but love=drug metaphors must be destroyed

**ImADudeDuh** (4): i don't care

**selegend** (3): bad

Awww I was sad seeing this so low. Jess's vocals on here are some of her best and her voice is filled with so much emotion. The shoutout to Hold My Hand is nice too. But it's a ballad so y'all did it dirty oop-

---

**agentofscranton** (10): this was used on like every sad moments compilation on youtube for like a decade

**jexan13** (10): those vocals and dramatism. The undisputed best of the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This song (and some others on the album) really gave me Christian pop vibes (like, I was thinking of “Jesus Take The Wheel” when listening to this) but I looked it up and she’s Jewish. Anyways, this is a good ballad track but in true popheads fashion it doesn’t resonate like the upbeat songs did. Maybe I should listen to it when I’m in a more depressive state.

**megm26** (8): her voice is beautiful, it really works on ballads.

**Tolk1en** (8): nothing especially exciting but pleasing to listen to

**CarlieScion** (7): ngl id heard this in passing before and i thought it was jesus take the wheel

**rickikardashian** (7): honestly I kinda can't stand her voice sometimes, especially in a stripped back slow ballad that has such a heavy focus in her voice. I don't know exactly what it has that makes me not enjoy it, but it just annoys me sometimes

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): damn her vocals go hard here

**ManofOranges** (6): a bit boring to me

**vayyiqra** (4): as a rule i don't hate ballads but this one isn't working for me

**waluigiest** (4): this is just a worse reskin of Halo/Already Gone

**ImADudeDuh** (3): one direction ended ha

I'm not a huge Ari fan but I kinda wish we got her version instead, I feel like it would've suited her better. I like the brass instrumentation, but besides that, this song just blends away into the rest of the album.

---

**jexan13** (10): that goddamn beat and a hook galore. This lady has made pop perfection. An album with something like this would have left the other two in this rate eating dust. BUt reality is dissapointing

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I almost missed some of these tracks because they aren’t on Spotify but they’re good, I love the synth work on this song.

**megm26** (8.1): really slick production. Apparently it was supposed to be on Dangerous Woman and I can see Ariana pulling it off but it really fits Jess.

**vayyiqra** (8): oh shit this is a BOP i love this it's such a good throwback to late 90s R&B (stream 90s Music by kimbra)

**TragicKingdom1** (7): originally an ari song but you can't really tell?

Is it just me or is this lowkey a bi anthem? Like I imagine a gay/bi guy singing it to another bi girl. "If I get my way, I'mma take care of you. I can take her place, let me get my way" Ok maybe not, it's most likely talking about a guy and his female best friend, but I prefer my interpretation! 

---

**ManofOranges** (10): this one has slowly grown on me and now i truly recognize its greatness

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I remember hearing this when it first came out and being underwhelmed by it, but listening to it now it slaps? It’s got a slow start but it positively explodes once it hits the pre-chorus/chorus. It’s a little generic and the tropical sound doesn’t really line up with the rest of the album but I think this is a fun addition.

**jexan13** (8): there's a great song buried below the generic production

**CarlieScion** (6): who decided this album needed even MORE songs

At first I did not like this song at all but it was a massive grower. The album came out over a year ago (wow time flies by quickly), and I distinctively remember listening to it on the bus ride home at 6pm in pitch black Canadian winter. It really was a vibe huh. I've always seen it as a song more suitable for winter than summer. The song is so chill and atmospheric, I can see why it wasn't really a hit since songs like these don't particularly do well, but I wish it would've at least got justice here.

---

**CarlieScion** (10): this is so smooth and pretty and chill

**ImADudeDuh** (9): omg wait this is kinda a megabop especially on the drop

**jexan13** (9): i like the subtle production and the vocals in the pre-chorus are truly magical

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): It’s certainly different from the rest of the album. I do kind of enjoy the hazy atmosphere of the song but I’ve never been a fan of these “we left the drum machine running” kind of songs.

**ManofOranges** (7): i don't hate this song to be honest it kinda intrigues me but i don't particularly love it

**vayyiqra** (7): i thought i would hate this from the title but it's alright

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): okay honestly this is just a lil too boring for me

Despite some meh lyrics, this is a great song. The drop isn't really bad and actually fits the song kinda well. The ending in particular is amazing. Here all those strings come together, it really does feel like Rita is at the end of her life and she's looking back and reflecting on ever shes done. Obviously that's not what going on, Rita still has a lot longer to go, but she does a get job at selling that vibe.

---

**jamesfog** (10): This aged real good

**jexan13** (10): the more artsy song in here. Reminds me of Dua's Want To which is also one of my favorites of hers. The outro truly stands out. goddamn i love strings

**ImADudeDuh** (9): lowkey kinda shook a biT

**CarlieScion** (8): money money dolla sign!!!

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): i do enjoy this sound from Rita, but i think this song is just missing something although i can't put my finger on what it is

**rickikardashian** (7.4): I understand that lyrics aren't the strong point of Rita's songs, but "you look like money, money, dollah signs" is a level of lazy I just can't accept

**ManofOranges** (6.5): "you look like you'd be heaven for a night" "hell of a life" okay come through juxtaposition

Leigh ate this shit up! She's kind of had the weakest vocals since The X Factor and got a fair bit of hate for it back then, so it's really nice to hear her in particular kill this vocal focused song. The lyrics are cute too and the chorus is catchy.

---

**CarlieScion** (10): how can little mix both put out songs like THIS and you gotta not???

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of my favorite Little Mix songs! It’s so cute, I like “cozy” little love songs like this that just make love sound like the best thing in the world, this song is a really refreshing change of pace on an otherwise aggressive album. I think it’s clever how the lyrics drop out after the “your love makes me feel like” part, as if there just aren’t words to express how it feels.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): Leigh's vocals really come through here, and i love how it starts slow and soft and really builds up to THAT ending

**jexan13** (7.5): I like it overall and the chorus is cute, but the production makes this feel like background music.

**ManofOranges** (7): cute but nothing special

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Josie's on a vacation far away

**hikkaru** (5): is my drug

**vayyiqra** (5): i zoned out for this so it's probably not good

A good trumpet solo can elevate any song, Falling To Pieces takes it to a higher level though. Not only do we get a great trumpet solo to close out the track (which Rita seems to do a lot on this album with different instruments), it's also sprinkled throughout the rest of the track too. The song is catchy too and she serves vocals, no complaints!

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This starts off with that watery trop pop intro and you’re expecting it to suck but you know what? Sometimes these songs work, and I think this one does because of the strong tone and chorus. One of the best songs on the album imo.

**jexan13** (8): I like horns. I like bops. So I like this song

**ManofOranges** (8): whenever there are horns in a song im bound to like it

**waluigiest** (8): gotta love the classic brass that’s so overproduced you can’t tell what instrument it is

A mega bop! This was actually the winner at a time as it was the first submission and received an 11. It's a nice bop. I think it's clear that all the platinum edition tracks were just kinda made to give the fans some extra songs in between the wait for LM5. They're nothing special but they're fun.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (9): latina queens

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Why didn’t I enjoy these new tracks when they came out? This slaps hard, I love the chorus! I love the build of this track, it’s got great energy and it manages to keep ramping that energy up throughout the rest of the track.

This is actually a mega bop, that chorus pops off and the verses are great too. I do wish the bridge had a bit more going on but besides that, it's a great song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): The fiddle that plays during the chorus adds a whole new level to this song. I know nothing about Jess Glynne but I’m like… proud of her after listening to this song. I wish it had a better bridge though.

The versatility on this album is great, you have songs about deep love with someone you've known for a long time, and then you'll also have sultry sexy hookup bops. It's short and sweet but that chorus bops so hard. This needs to be made a single so it can smash like it deserves to.

---

**sailormunelune** (10): so sultry, I love it

**jexan13** (9.5): idkw but i really like this song. Maybe it's the vocal effects or the dark atmosphere

**selegend** (9): god this is so good

**megm26** (8.1): I really like how dark and sexy sounding this is

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): if u haven't had sex to this song u def should and hope rita has more songs like this in the future, she sounds amazing!!

**rickikardashian** (7.9): Rita Ora hooks up in your house and doesn't clean up after

**vayyiqra** (7): wasn't this a led zeppelin song but also it's vayycore enough for me

**ManofOranges** (6.5): i love cashmere sweaters

**ImADudeDuh** (6): oh no its getting boring again

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): It’s kind of ugly sounding, not sexy. We get really no information about this person or the hookup at all so it’s almost as if she doesn’t care, and she doesn’t really sound that in to the situation either. It’s empty and emotionless, she should have left this off the album entirely because the tracks that precede it are much stronger and this kills the momentum right at the end.

That chorus bops so so hard, the beat is so good. My two criticisms though are that this kinda sounds like a remix of the song instead of what the original should sound like, also, and I've noticed this with her older songs on the album, the mixing is a bit off which takes a little bit away from the song.

---

**waluigiest** (10): when that WET beat came in I absolutely lost my mind

**ManofOranges** (7.5): i like the beat of this one although i don't really care for the hook

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this album is half disco bops, half weird ballad, and another half both of them together

**vayyiqra** (7): these nu-disco bangers never get old do they

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Feels like background music from a Grand Theft Auto game. She blends in to these kind of songs too well, another singer could have done more to make this feel substantial.

**jexan13** (6.5): a great intro but the rest is... not it

**Tolk1en** (4): you can't make a good pop song with a boring rhythm and only 3 different notes

It bops a bit, definitely not as good as Rather Be but it's still pretty nice. It sounds like it has a little too much going on at some points; the great beat and chorus make up for it though.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (9): clean bandits were icons

**jexan13** (9): i'm a sucker for that electronic sample in the chorus. Very very very catchy

**megm26** (8.1): I like Clean Bandit's production a lot, and Jess' vocals work well with it. This song shows her vocal chops.

**ManofOranges** (8): carly is unphased

**skargardin** (7.5): If there's anything Jess has proven over the course of her two albums and features is that she can carry an EDM-track

**agentofscranton** (7): honestly until hold my hand came out i was certain that jess glynne was just some singer that clean bandit specifically hired for their songs

**rotating3Dtext** (7): it’s not bad. it’s just not Rather Be

**vayyiqra** (7): dua who

**waluigiest** (7): when the glitzy beat comes in it picks up some momentum!

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Did anyone else notice that Jax Jones dropped like, [a knockoff song with Ella Henderson?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpArZkzrU3g&frags=pl%2Cwn) Anyways, this song is nice but it’s clearly the inferior of the two Clean Bandit collaborations in this rate, it just feels like a normal Jess Glynne house-pop song and I was hoping for something a little more. Like, my opinion of this song dropped after I finished the album because I realize that Jess made this song like six times on her own, and those were better.

**CarlieScion** (5): this is possibly the most generic "producer ft pop singer" you can get

**selegend** (5): her best song is that kill the lights song

I love most of the songs on this album, but this one didn't really click as hard with me. It's fine but I find the chorus more grating than catchy. Not sure why it got an MV when there are like 4 bops more deserving of it on this album

---

**ManofOranges** (10): this is one is quite exquisite kinda wish it wasn't so short

Wow this song is absolutely gorgeous, lowkey my 2nd option for my 11. This does not sound like the kind of song Rita could pull off but she kills it. The ending of the song is so amazing, the choir, the brass, the claps, multiple layers of Rita's vocals. It all comes together to create a wonderful moment that lasts with you.

**selegend** (10): yes ive cried to this song before

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i didn't think rita could pull off this kind of soul song but she blows me away with every listen

**waluigiest** (10): I was ready to give up on this album but then this track came!! The understated orchestration and pleasant lyrics make this such a standout. It’s a cute, simple ballad and it really works

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.7): I like this one, it has a nice sound to it. Her asking for us to clap *on the actual track* is kinda tacky, but the actual effect of the clapping on the track.

**jexan13** (8.5): see what happens when you don't have a generic EDM production behind your good vocals? Good songs happen

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): didn’t expect to like this so much

**ManofOranges** (7.5): a bit catchy i gotta admit

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ended janet fadson

**rickikardashian** (6.8): this feels like one of those songs that eventually builds up to a huge final chorus with a gospel choir and a band, but instead it leads nowhere

**CarlieScion** (6): [insert joke about janet]

**skargardin** (6): It's ok but most of the ballads from these albums just fall flat

**agentofscranton** (5.5): janet sweetie

**vayyiqra** (5): isn't this the name of a kpop band

When Jess pops off she pops off HARD. This song is so cute.

**ManofOranges** (10): this is a hit

**TragicKingdom1** (10): inject the piano into my bones

**waluigiest** (9): okay who told this song to be so dramatic? It’s a bop and a half

**jexan13** (7.5): a cute bop that lacks teeth

**ImADudeDuh** (6): why does she go ohohohoohohohohoo so much

**skargardin** (6): This is just okay, terribly inoffensive and not really all that good of an album opener

**vayyiqra** (5): this sounds like a focus-grouped minivancore pop song
