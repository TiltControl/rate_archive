I'd actually be gagged if Check On It ends up the highest, even if it was an 11 contender for me.

I'll just say it now, one of the best dance songs of all time. If you don't want to get up and do all the moves to this in sorry to say, you have no flavour whatsoever, and you really havent lived until you've seen half a gay bar immediately coordinate a group dance to this. This sat around #10 and wrestled for that top 10 spot almost the entire time until the unseasoned last minute entrants knocked it down to our first song out of day 3

---

**starlightzone** (11): YEAH THIS IS MY 11 its hard to describe what Get Me Bodied has over all these other songs, but I just think everything flows together. It's the perfect hit in the middle of the album. Get Me Bodied is an incredibly strong song and I think it's one of Beyonce's best. It hits on all the great parts of a Beyonce song, it's got speed, it's got bounce, it's got Beyonce showing off how great her voice is. Overall top tier.

**wavingwolves** (11): do I even need to explain? this is fucking iconic. the music video is probably the one I most watched in my life and I used to wait for it to play on tv to see it (remember a time before youtube?). I know the whole choreography for it to this DAY because I still dance to it all the time. absolutely perfect, ugh!!!! no more words!!! I just fucking LOVE beyoncé!!!!!!

**anothertown** (10): I don’t even know what to say. This propelled me entirely through college.

**bespectacIed** (10): Yasss the extended version, as it should be!!! Beyoncé's high-energy, won't-let-you-breathe-for-a-second songs will always be my favorite part of her discography. Get Me Bodied is one of her most important songs, and a slap in the face to those who say Bey only cared about showing her blackness later in her career. This is such a joyous celebration of RnB, bounce music, and female blackness. I'm so happy Bey loves this song because it means this always gets included in her setlists. Don't get me started on the surprise Beychella performance with Solange, the wig snatchery. She knows she will always have us BODIED.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): im not very flexible but one time at the club after probably too much alcohol i got very close to doing a split during this song anyway its a fucking banger

**fadedblue09** (10): Original version is already good, but extended is fine too even though I felt like it didn't add much.

**J\_Toe** (10): so close to getting my eleven. And the extended version is the only one people should listen to. I was so unimaginably happy to see Solange join B for this during Beychella. Also, I love how this song references Crazy In Love: Do the uh-oh/Do the uh-oh/Do the uh-oh-uh-oh, uh-oh-oh-no-no. Weirdly no one has made this connection on Genius?

**JunkyGS** (10): Michelle Obama

**lilguavachan** (10): every time the beat drops, i drop with it.

**rsmitty99** (10): Todrick's "Nails, Hair Hips, Heels" wishes it could capture the magic of this song. Whoo chile when this song comes on, let me tell you. Don't care where I'm at. The club? The Gym? At work? Mid orgasm? Bout to pat my nonexistent weave. Shout out to the "Move Your Body" mix she did for Michelle Obama. Also a bop

**waluigiest** (10): this song is a piece of art. The first time I ever went out was to a gay club in New York. They were playing this song and I was overwhelmed with joy

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.8): This song is like what I imagine Tina Turner would've made if she debuted in the 00's.

**rickikardashian** (9.3): the version they did for Coachella I perfect, and listening to this version now kinda makes this pale in comparison:/ also the breakdown kinda goes of for way too long here

**ImADudeDuh** (9): oh this could be a bit of a workout sex jam

**ditacarlita** (8.5): this song has given me motivation to get off my ass and peel and chop the apples for my upcoming pudding recipe and i HATE peeling and chopping shit, plus i'm rating this as if it was the short version

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): The non-extended mix is a 10 :/

**evilqueenlex** (8): the bob fosse tribute in the video is so cute

**ignitethephoenix** (8): where’s the non extended version though

**jexan13** (8): Single Ladies sounds weird here

**1998tweety** (7.5): Gurl I don't have time for a 6 min extended mix. It's alright.

**maybe9** (7): good tempo, very repetitive

**Qwilphish** (7): Michelle Obama teas

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): I mostly remember this from the Spanish version called Mueve tu Cuerpo that we played in my high school Spanish class

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.7): When this started I thought it was “Freakum Dress” and I just kept waiting for the chorus to hit so that shows how interested I was in it… however the shift that happens halfway through really caught me off guard. I don’t think either half is especially spectacular but I respect that she tried something weird.

**DaHumanTorch** (6): first track i didn't love. it went on much too long and even if it didn't, i did not like it all that much when compared to the first 8 superb tracks

**timothy444** (6): On the technical aspect, there's something wrong with the audio equalisation because I feel like the adlibs (which is surprising in a 2000s song) are distracting and annoying. It's a shame too because Beyonce's vocals would've shined here without hearing "yeah" and "yo" every second in the background.

**MrSwearword** (5): I can get my life to legit so many other Beyonce songs, especially if it's one of the overrated ones that so many will insist is exceptional. BYE

Fun fact: I've accidentally Mandela Effected myself because for my entire life I vividly remember the Check On It video being Beyonce in a nightclub as her Pink Panther character- turns out that's the Baby Boy video and I drove myself crazy during this rate trying to find what i thought was the "original" Check On It video. Anyway this song is fun, but surprised it's one of Beyonce's biggest hits on the charts

---

**drewbarrymore2** (11): This video made gay!

**bespectacIed** (10): This rate is exhausting me, trying to hold back giving an 11 to so many songs. One of my fave Bey songs ever. This is pure honey, so irresistible, so impossible to NOT throw ass to. If I ever get dementia later life, I know I would just be a vegetable reciting "dip it pop it twerk it stop it check on me tonight" over and over until I die. I love Beyoncé so much, no other artist makes me happier with their music

**fadedblue09** (10): Beyonce's 2nd catchiest song, after Countdown. Almost got my 11.

**J\_Toe** (10): hate that lyric at the beginning. But Bey's parts are perfect. Also, reminder, Bey's 2 fav colours are gold and pink.

**MrSwearword** (10): the only good to come out of that goddamned Pink Panther remake. Bangin production and stands as one of Beyonce's best videos.

**rickikardashian** (10): the video for this is such a pink bubblegum cheesy mess, and I love it so much, I want my life to look like that video. also this is one of Beyonce's best songs and I know I'll feel bad for not giving it my 11

**starlightzone** (10): i have nothing to prove here this song slaps.

**waluigiest** (10): maybe the most 2006 song ever

**wavingwolves** (10): it's impossible to hear this one and not have the music video play on my head at the same time. it's also impossible not to dance to this song, it's fucking ICONIC

**yourfacesucksass** (9.5): One of her BEST. Same goes for the video.

**1998tweety** (9): Bey eats this UP, not sure what's up with the bad features that all sound the same. Would've been a 10 if it was just her.

**ditacarlita** (9): CLASSIC

**slimboyfriend** (9): Kelly Rowland's best song

**timothy444** (9): I remember listening to this bop when I was in school and it still slaps! Amazingly good!

**anothertown** (8.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikhYCfUTQsQ

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): The chorus is a classic!

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.3): Fun, cute bop. Still not sure if those are Kelly's vocals on the second verse lol.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): i liked it but it wasn't my favorite. definitely near the bottom of the album, but still a great track

**Qwilphish** (7.5): repetitive, but a forgotten gem

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): mindless bop

**maybe9** (7): i do like what i see, tyvm

**rsmitty99** (7): Probably Beyonce's most forgettable #1 smash.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.6): I like it (Beyoncé’s chorus especially) but it’s kind of unremarkable.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): i love you bey but this sounds so dated and not in a good way

**ImADudeDuh** (4): messy song

I appreciate Beyonce taking the unique angle of being the one to improve her man with her wealth and power. The song is a bop and the video is iconic with Bey pretty much playing Jay in drag. Still, it's not a 10 for me as it just doesnt reach the level of boppitude that so many of the B'Day songs do. A really decent score and placement for this one I think!

---

**jackisboredtoday** (11): THIS BEAT… one of Bey’s best ever and unfairly overshadowed by her other Jay collabs

**Qwilphish** (11): (jay-z) WHATS HIGHER THAN NUMBER 10

**agentofscranton** (10): honestly my fav of the BeyJay (is that their couple name? it should be) collabs

**bespectacIed** (10): Every tour run or medley performance that this gets snubbed is a year shaved off my life. Such a irresistible song that makes me forget a little bit that I hate Jay because he served.  "Lemme UHP lemme UHP grade yew" activates the hoe in me

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the bad bitch energy exuding from this....her power. also jay's verse went off, i usually don't like rap features but this was great and brought the song from a 9/9.5 to a 10

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A massive banger

**J\_Toe** (10): technocratic queen

**maybe9** (10): unbelievably good, im shook

**MrSwearword** (10): a great song with an exceptional and opulent video [that doubled as a DirectTV advert if I recall correctly] and is one of Bey and Jay's best collabs.

**rsmitty99** (10): Fuck. Yes.

**anothertown** (9.5): the unfettered capitalism... :bernie:

**yourfacesucksass** (9.4): Why wasn't this the first single???

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): like 8 of these points double as points for her braid in the video

**rosecult** (9): then upgrade him sis

**skargardin** (9): Boppy but not too sold on Jay's verse

**starlightzone** (9): I won't deny that this song is my jam. I can't think about listening to B'Day without thinking about how good it'll be to listen to Upgrade U. The whole Chorus really makes this song but the verses are also just stunning and I love the bridge lyrics. I feel there's a lot of upgrading songs about taking one man for another man, but it's definitely more about lavishing her wealth on her new lover and making them stronger. Much like Welcome To Hollywood, Jay and Bey both compliment each other on this song.

**wavingwolves** (9): love this song but the "I can do for you what martin did for the people" line is a choice

**ditacarlita** (8.5): this should have been a single, i haven't gotten sick of this song since it's release

**1998tweety** (8): I don't really for Jay here but at least Bey ate.

**jexan13** (8): imagine if Everything is Flop had songs like this

**waluigiest** (8): not crazy in love but a good, nostalgia-laced bop

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): The first time I heard this song was in a DirecTV commercial back when Beyoncé had partnerships with consumer brands for peasants like me

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.4): Lmfao this is Beyonce's least feminist song but it still goes hard so I'm giving it an okay score.

**JunkyGS** (7): girl compares herself to MLK Jr in this song.... im sorry that just takes me out LOL

**fadedblue09** (6.8): Fine, but definitely not their best collab.

**timothy444** (6): Meh

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): There’s just no particularly interesting parts of this song, they layer in sound effects and stuff to try to salvage it but I think the central hook is just so weak they should have scrapped the song entirely.

The backing choir really brings something to this song and helps it feel different from the rest of the album. Of course, she's serving the best vocals in the industry yet again but this has some real soul to it!

---

**DaHumanTorch** (11): the lyrics are what push this above into my 11. not only is the song phenomenal and up there with we belong together, but the lyrics are just so beautiful. i even teared up a little when the choir came in with her whistle notes....ugh *chefs kiss* bellissimo. i know this won't win as it isn't the most popular of this album or anything, but it definitely deserves some 11s

**gaymike219905** (11): - This song is perfect from start to finish. I almost gave my 11 to WBT, but I think Fly Like a Bird is the superior song. Let it take you to church!

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): I remember being in college and listening to this song while riding my bike home and feeling like I was crying and flying at the same time. This is such an uplifting song, I’m not a religious person but I think the themes that Mariah touches on in this song transcend that. Possibly the best fusion of pop and gospel ever recorded?

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): would be my 11 if gwen werent in the rate

**fadedblue09** (10): This is how a modern Emotions track would sound like.  The gospel influences are a nice touch.

**jess\_22** (10): I get chills every time I hear the ending

**JunkyGS** (10): LOOK UP HER GRAMMY PERFORMANCE OF THIS SONG. NOW. DO IT. OR YOU WILL BE PERMA BANNED FROM POPHEADS FOR BEING FAKE!

**lilguavachan** (10): look how she ate that (vocally)

**oscarbrierley1** (10): queen of speaking whistles

**rsmitty99** (10): If this song can make my atheism-ass weep uncontrollably, then it gets a 10

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): CARRY ME HIGHER LORD!!!!!!!

**timothy444** (10): Oh my god, this song is simply perfect beyond any expectations I've ever had. There's just so much 'oomf' in Mariah's voice and the way she hit the high note slayed me and my brain! A 10/10 closer of a banger!

**starlightzone** (9.5): This song also feels somewhat out of place but the vocalization is still so strong here.

**bespectacIed** (9): "She's fabulous for a throwback" - Katy Perry

**maybe9** (9): a classic

**skargardin** (9): whew what a closer

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is quite nice, vocals jumped out.

**evilqueenlex** (8.5): take us to church Mariah

**megm26** (8.5): those high notes at the end... I'm speechless

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Nelly Furtado ended ha

**MrSwearword** (8): Mariah's sweet vocals always do THATPART

**wavingwolves** (8): cheesy but charming

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.7): This song does a nice job of slowly building to the final chorus. Nice way to close the standard album.

**Qwilphish** (6): I’m over this whole back half being a boring ballad

You could not have ever convinced me before this rate that Heidi Montag recorded an absolute slapper of a track that Gaga or Britney could have taken to the top of the charts, yet here we are! I unironically stan this song and ironically stan her Miss Universe performance of it

---

**agentofscranton** (10): not heidi montag actually releasing a legitimate bop

**CandlePrince** (10): One of the best pop songs of all time, the sampling of Yazoo's Situation is just brilliant.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): iconic, truly a moment

**lilguavachan** (10): the rapping with her husband is so bad... but like it adds so much to this song

**skargardin** (10): i was gonan give this a trash score but holy shit it bops so insanely hard

**worlds-okayest666** (10): The rap on this is dog shit but I don’t care! The rest of the song is such a classic it balances back out into a 10

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This… isn’t bad? I wouldn’t listen to it again but it isn’t bad.

**bespectacIed** (7): trashy white girl pop has the tea, I hate to admit

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): kylie outsold

**yourfacesucksass** (5): Vocals? Not astounding. The music sounds IDENTICAL to a song you can use on a ride in RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 and I'm in tears just thinking about it

This is it, the superior ballad on this album. Might seem like a redux of We belong together but this outdoes it for me, the melody is heavenly and the chorus just slides into my head so comfortably and sticks there. Sad it came short and just missed the top 10 for the entire voting period!

---

**bespectacIed** (10): sometimes it be like that

**DaHumanTorch** (10): mariah carey really invented r&b with this album didn't she. this song is just even more perfection, nothing more to say

**evilqueenlex** (10): the companion piece to We Belong Together

**fadedblue09** (10): This gets dragged for being a We Belong Together clone, but I don't care. She can make a whole EP of these and I'll still enjoy it.

**oscarbrierley1** (10): the note that lasts forever

**rsmitty99** (10): That bridge. Phew.

**starlightzone** (10): LIKE IF YOU CRIED TO THIS SONG THE FIRST TIME YOU HEARD IT.

**yourfacesucksass** (9.5): I like this more than WBT, even if they always compare them.

**1998tweety** (9): The last minute of this song pops off hard.

**skargardin** (9): Queen of doing a re-release and getting another hit

**timothy444** (9): Her voice is always amazing and this song is no exception. The passion, the commitment to those lyrics are incredible; she truly is an iconic kween!

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.6): Basically repeat of We Belong Together, but it still slaps.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Nipsey Hussle (RIP) ended ha

**maybe9** (8): BOP

**Qwilphish** (8): an rnb nice groove

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (8): We belong together part 2. The bridge is the best part

**worlds-okayest666** (8): this bops but it’s literally just We Belong Together II: Electric Boogaloo

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): one of her blandest #1s

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I’ve always found this song soooo boring, it just feels like “We Belong Together” watered down.

**jexan13** (5): what the bonus tracks said to the happy me when I finally stopped listening to the standard tracks

**MrSwearword** (5): aside from the music video, this is just boring as shit and more or less one of the more baffling number ones to Mariah's name

an absolute banger and probably one of the last pure pop records Beyonce has put out. I'm really glad this was so appreciated, being a non-single album cut that's not that well known outside of the random. It was tragic seeing this fall out of a comfortable top 10 position for most of the rate to where it is now

---

**jexan13** (11): This song is pure crazyness and chaos. I can't see anyone but Beyoncé singing it. I love every single second of it. Lend me your freakum dress queen bee, mine is ugly.

**starla\_** (11): this is still my favourite beyonce song, it slaps eternally

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i too got my freakum dress on

**evilqueenlex** (10): This song is an 11 but we can only choose one.

**fadedblue09** (10): That bridge. WOW.

**gannade** (10): i know this is one of beyonces more polarizing singles but lmao its so catchy

**J\_Toe** (10): perfect except for the misappropriation of Hamlet. "To be? Or not to be?" Means "Should I live, or should I kill myself?" Answering "Not" begins this song with an uncharacteristically fatalistic outlook.

**lilguavachan** (10): you see this serve???

**MrSwearword** (10): a fucking BANGER and has a fabulous video

**rsmitty99** (10): If I had 2 11s, this would be one of them. Classic Beyonce

**skargardin** (10): ICONIC is the word

**waluigiest** (10): FUCK YES this goes stupid hard. The little chromatic rise really really gets me going I had to start it over WOW

**starlightzone** (9.8): We're hitting some of Bey's best songs on this album and I don't feel like I should give everything on here a 10 but this is like right there. If I had a tiny criticism it's that I don't like the harsh sounds during the verses but that's like so fucking tiny and minor it's such a good song.

**bespectacIed** (9): The mother of SNSD - I Got A Boy. That whole "hol up, bring the beat back" intro is iconic

**DaHumanTorch** (9): another bad bitch bop, this album is full of them ive noticed. literally ended men

**1998tweety** (8.5): Whew this went off. Love that energy.

**ditacarlita** (8.5): a song that should be on every single beyonce playlist, you are not a beyonce fan if you don't like this song

**anothertown** (8): the prechorus makes me go FUKIN CRAZY

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8): The production and background vocals really make this song. The use of chromaticism is a fun trick she uses again in Countdown.

**timothy444** (8): I actually like the funky flow of this and it's catchy!

**yourfacesucksass** (7.9): The intro is hilarious to me LOL "not!"

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.8): On the one hand this slaps but on the other hand I could just stream “1 Thing.”

Two titans of the industry collide, truly an iconic crossover of our times. The music video is the only time in her life that Beyonce came close to being completely outstaged but they worked well together and produced an iconic hit!

---

**1998tweety** (11): I was debating between this and We Belong Together but I had to give it to Bey and Shakira. The life I got from this song...too damn much. This is one of those songs where you know you're gay if you stanned it when you were young. A duet done RIGHT.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): This song is just so iconic and amazing on so many levels. Collaborations honestly peaked with this song. I love it when Beyonce and Shakira end men!

**bespectacIed** (10): That moment when you, a black queen, comes across a tax-evading, small and humble-breasted white queen, and discuss how to best maximize your joint slay

**DaHumanTorch** (10): beyonce repeating her and shakira's names over and over is my new religion

**fadedblue09** (10): Those Arabian influences make the song.

**jess\_22** (10): Truly the underrated collab of the century

**lilguavachan** (10): i wish they'd do more collabs... they kinda served

**MrSwearword** (10): a legendary collaboration that transcends time

**Qwilphish** (10): two legends???

**rickikardashian** (10): I'm crossing my fingers for shakira to just pull Beyonce to the Superbowl and sing this, because God knows, JLo won't be able to sing it

**skargardin** (10): Collab of the century

**waluigiest** (10): is it bad that I really associate this with Just Dance

**wavingwolves** (10): earlier this year me and my best friends got drunk and danced to this song for like a full hour. it never gets old

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): one of her most forgotten singles but wow what a banger

**ditacarlita** (9.5): damn the instrumentals, this collab, so much approval, i want this at the superbowl between shaki and jlo plz

**jexan13** (9.5): this is great... but it feels recycled fron Naughty Girl.

**timothy444** (9): An alluring duet

**anothertown** (8.5): The poetic cinema that’s here. The lyricism, the unity.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8): Love the feminist solidarity and the part where they say "we can laugh about it" and then laugh super aggressively.

**maybe9** (8): its both amazing and tired

**rsmitty99** (8): I used to watch the dance break of this song and try to catch the cuts where Beyonce and Shakira change. Anyway, the song is fine. "HA! HA! HA!"

**starlightzone** (8): this is just a seriously stunning song and i love the message and lyrics with it its so beautiful

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this should be so much better

**evilqueenlex** (6): the music video was such a ten but the song never impressed me that much. I always found something really off putting about it.

**gannade** (6): its catchy but this song is definitely a disappointment considering the starpower

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Star power isn’t enough to carry this one, the song isn’t bad but it’s just kind of bland. Both of them have released songs much better than this one.

**JunkyGS** (6): "I want it to be like that Eurythmics and Aretha Franklin song Sisters Are Doin’ It for Themselves, not Beautiful Liar. But I definitely want to do something that is so iconic." - Katheryn "3x Diamond Singles - #1 RIAA Certified Digital Artist" Hudson

A fan favorite for many out there, I'm kinda surprised this only hit #9 but with all the competition it had im not shocked either. Gwen rides that fiddler on the roof sample for all its worth and kind of outsold the iconic play in the process

---

**1998tweety** (10): Erm this is going off HARD, love the beat, that chorus is catchy af and Eve ate that rap up.

**bespectacIed** (10): Charli XCX's whole career was built on this song, part I

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the fiddler on the roof interpolation... wig

**DaHumanTorch** (10): I didn't know this was Gwen Stefani, until now I just knew it as that bop from Beverly Hills Chihuahua that I loved as a kid. Also the Eve feature snapped.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A bop but also when are we going to rate Hall & Oates

**ImADudeDuh** (10): We stan a broadway queen. Also, stan Eve.

**J\_Toe** (10): A remake of the Louchie Lou & Michie One song (Rich Girl), itself a cover of the Hall & Oats song (Rich Girl), itself an interpolation of If I was a Rich Man from Fiddler on the Roof, itself a translation of the Yiddish monologue "If I was a Rothscild" from Sholem Aleichem.

**MrSwearword** (10): sure it's not as iconic as "Let Me Blow Your Mind" but hey, how many times have successful collaborators teamed up more than once.

**rickikardashian** (10): the just dance choreo of this is what made me gay, and the chair choreo of it is what made me dumb, because I feel on my head while doing it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): https://twitter.com/cmerechicken/status/1200118243291254784

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.2): First time I saw Fiddler on the roof I thought they ripped off this song. Also I miss Eve.

**fadedblue09** (9): This one's good too. Rap verse flows nicely and actually adds something to the song

**jess\_22** (9): Before 7 Rings there was Rich Girl

**maybe9** (9): her voice is iconic, and eve feature is fuego

**rsmitty99** (9): Was never aware of the Fiddler on the Roof song before hearing this song all over the radio back in 05. Man (girl). Gwen really loved borrowing from different cultures on this album, huh?

**skargardin** (9): Banger

**waluigiest** (9): I don’t know if I’ve ever stopped thinking about this song. I didn’t know the “nananananana” was an interpolation for a while and it’s so iconic

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.7): A *Fiddler On The Roof* sample, of all things? It takes guts to take on something that iconic and it really works.

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): if only listening to this song made you rich

**starla\_** (8.5): Loses 1.5 points for not being Let Me Blow Ya Mind

**ditacarlita** (8): I don't think the Eve part elevates the song at all

**jexan13** (8): money deserves a better anthem; one with a better rap verse.

**wavingwolves** (8): say no to materialism!!! give the communist manifesto a shot, it's a great read

**starlightzone** (7.8): The only reason, the only reason, it doesn't get higher is that I feel it doesn't live up to the first Eve and Gwen collab. Blow Ya Mind still hits it years later, and while Rich Girl is good, it does not hit the levels deserved by both of these artists.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): maybe capitalism actually made a point here

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Love the Almost Feminism but the Eve feature is underwhelming

**Qwilphish** (6): repetitive and the production is very 2005. Eve is a great addition on this track

a perfect opener. for the emancipation era. Mariah is HERE and she's letting you know she doesnt have time to listen to anyone talk shit or even insinuate she "flopped", after all you chickens is ash and she's lotion! The only thing i have to say about this song is it might have been better elsewhere on the tracklist because it really brings a great energy that dies down later off

---

**ditacarlita** (11): I would give this a 50 if I could. One of my favourite songs of ALL TIME.

**agentofscranton** (10): them chickens is ash and i'm lotion is literally the greatest lyric of all time look it up

**bbfan132** (10): “them chickens is ash and i’m lotion” ended your favorite artist’s career

**evilqueenlex** (10): Mariah "them chickens is ash and I'm lotion" Carey went off with this song

**gannade** (10): mooriah is so good at hiphop. why doesnt she do it more???

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Oh wow, did it get iconic up in here?

**jess\_22** (10): 'Them chickens is ash and I'm lotion.' Iconic

**lilguavachan** (10): "them chickens ash, and i'm lotion" is a mood i'm trying to bring into the new year

**MrSwearword** (10): if only because of the lyric, "these chickens is ash and I'm lotion" and Mariah being the only person that could pull that off.

**rsmitty99** (10): I play this song every time I'm about to go to a party.

**skargardin** (10): Crazy strong opener

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): so fucking fun. Dem chickens is ash and i'm lotion will always be amazing.

**wavingwolves** (10): little me loved dancing to this and older me still loves it. such a fun song!!!

**bespectacIed** (9): Mariah started what would become the greatest comeback of her career with a trend-chasing song. It's a massive bop and it has the single most iconic lyric of the 2000s, y'all know the one, but it unfortunately kinda sounds like every sexy RnB song with breathy female vocals that time.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): them chickens is ash and im lotion

**maybe9** (9): what a way to start an album

**Qwilphish** (9): Mariah pulling her best Shakira impression and honestly succeeding

**yourfacesucksass** (8.8): I think it's a fun party song, but the sound is so distinctly 2005 that it could only ever sound as that.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.6): This song deserved more! No one but Mariah would've written lines comparing herself to a hot tamale or lotion.

**megm26** (8.2): them chickens is ash and I'm lotion

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): Why don’t people talk about this song more??? a Mariah club song is such a treat

**anothertown** (8): i would have liked to have been there when she wrote the chickens line

**DaHumanTorch** (8): The adlibs from Jermaine and Fatman were a bit much at times, otherwise a great opener to the R&B perfection that we expect from Mariah. "Them chickens is ash and im lotion" Mariah has some bars in there too whew

**fadedblue09** (8): A perfect moodsetter for the album. That outro was super annoying and unnecessary though and cost it a point.

**J\_Toe** (8): oh wow, I remember this song from my child hood! I didn't know it was a Mariah song. I guess I skipped it 'cos I usually only listen to select Mariah singles. Hopefully this rate will change that.

**jexan13** (8): catchy and criminal beat that gets old fast

**starlightzone** (8): I try to be nicer to collabs but I think Jermaine and Fatman bring this one down. I feel like they don't add anything worthwhile to the song and the weird noises they make in the middle of the song just bother me.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): "Them chickens is ash and I'm lotion"

**1998tweety** (7): Erm...this is not really it

**ImADudeDuh** (7): People really give this song way more credit than it deserves just for that one line.

**timothy444** (7): It's alright. I wouldn't listen to it again but I wouldn't exactly turn it off if I somehow find myself hearing this on my Spotify

**waluigiest** (7): a good song for establishing her musical palette at this point in time. Not super sure what the features are doing

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Mariah sounds great everyone else sound awful

What an audacious way to start her solo career and open her album. This experimental, fresh while citing all her references for this era, and still sounds good to this day. Lyrically it's strong as well- I just cant stop raving about this song! The music video is extremely iconic as well

---

**agentofscranton** (11): absolutely batshit in all the best ways - one of the best songs of all time as far as i'm concerned

**jess\_22** (11): I thank Bring It On: All Or Nothing for introducing me to this gem

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): honestly all of these gwen singles pop off they all deserve 11s but i guess im partial to this alice in wonderland writer's block fever dream please give it the high rank it deserves thank u

**1998tweety** (10): Oh WOW. This started off slow so I did NOT expect it to explode a few seconds later. A very good intro

**anothertown** (10): one of the best album openers

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): motivational anthem omg

**DaHumanTorch** (10): The first time I heard this, the transition from the slow ballady opener to the TICK TOCK TICK TOCK fully scalped me. Iconic. TAKE A CHANCE YOU STUPID HOE!

**ditacarlita** (10): this song has absolutely no flaws and is such a perfectly crafted pop song

**fadedblue09** (10): This album opens with a BANG.

**gannade** (10): this song is so motivational. a feminist anthem. a self love banger

**J\_Toe** (10): For some reason what I remember most about this song is it playing on Spicks and Specks (Aus panel show) and Alan calling Gwen Stefani dressed as a queen and pushing herself into the pool "the story of my life" and I think a lot of people on this sub can relate to that sentiment.

**jexan13** (10): the undisputed best of the album. What an amazing beggining; so much energy and catchyness. This track ran so Sucker by Choli Xbox could fly.

**lilguavachan** (10): what an iconic way to start an album

**MrSwearword** (10): if any Gwen song deserved commercial success it was this one. The song captured solo debut from popular band nerves perfectly and has a legendary video.

**rosecult** (10): made me feel like a super hot female

**starla\_** (10): Invented Stupid Hoe

**wavingwolves** (10): the term pop perfection really gets thrown a lot but there's no other way to describe this

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.6): This is surprisingly weird, but in a way that feels natural and not a gimmick. It feels more like a Gorillaz song than a debut single for a pop singer. In other news "take a chance you stupid ho" is my new motivational phrase.

**starlightzone** (9.5): When I think of songs that start off an album right, this is it. This is literally all I can think about. The intro is so well done and it hits the beat immediately after wards. It fully defines how hectic this decade was and it's just such a great song. You're still a super hot female is just that lyric.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I’ve heard people say that this song still sounds fresh and while I disagree with that, it still sounds great. Bold of her to begin her career as a pop star with what’s essentially a diss track to the entire pop system.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I completely forgot about this song! Still a bop

**ImADudeDuh** (9): a just dance bop

**Qwilphish** (9): A burst of fun to start off, I’m really into the varied production.

**sailormunelune** (9): Ms. Gwen saving me from major procrastination on the daily

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): This is such a banger, the production still feels ridiculously fresh today

**maybe9** (8.5): 🔥🔥🔥

**evilqueenlex** (8): "take a chance you stupid hoe" is something I remind myself often whenever I'm scared to take risks.

**skargardin** (8): Cute opener

**waluigiest** (8): what an introduction to a solo career omfg

**rsmitty99** (6): I mean, it's a catchy arrangement. But those gasp noises and moaning ad libs really made me uncomfortable. Call me old fashion. Aslo, never knew that lyric was "Take a chance you stupid hoe." Hilarious

**bespectacIed** (2): "I have to stop before the halfway point, I can't let this song be recorded on my last.fm" is the story of my L.A.M.B. listening party, starting off with the opening track

Crazy in Love’s younger sister, and shes every bit as powerful of a song, and in some ways better. The bridge is AMAZING and one of my favorites in any Beyonce song; the manic energy and the way her her desperation seems to be building and building makes my heart race. Strong 11 contender and great finish in the top 5 for a song that's somewhat forgotten in her discography

---

**anothertown** (11): One of my favorite songs of all time. Iconic intro, the production is so tight, and I love how Beyonce escalates her vocal and goes bigger and bigger into the song

**MrSwearword** (11): Beyonce's best song. Deal accordingly.

**sailormunelune** (11): Bass. Hi-hat. 808. Jay. Let’s go get em. Come on!

**bespectacIed** (10): The best Bey and J song, argue with your mama. Most iconic bass line of all time, Another One Bites the Dust can choke on that dust

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is better than Crazy In Love and you can @ me about it

**DaHumanTorch** (10): finally back to the 10s. i really liked jay opening the song and having the third verse. his features on this album have all been great

**fadedblue09** (10): Still a bop, and maybe even better than Crazy in Love?

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of Beyoncé’s most underrated singles. It’s such a bop

**maybe9** (10): absolute banger

**skargardin** (10): Even if it might be CIL Part II it's no less of a slapper

**starlightzone** (10): The strongest of the collabs on this album I think. Deja Vu keeps Jay's energy up while not pulling Beyonce back as hard as I think Upgrade U does while also showing off the incredibly voice Bey has at the very beginning of the song. I think they flow so nicely here.

**wavingwolves** (10): people will say that this is her trying to recreate crazy in love but this is way better... and crazy in love is an amazing song, don't get me wrong, but the this is just much more fascinating

**rickikardashian** (9.5): now I hear this and I remember when in Coachella, after Beyonce sang for a good few hours with intense choreo and outfit changes, Jay Z cane out to only sing this song and was out of breath as if he had ran a marathon, in both weekends

**J\_Toe** (9): trying a little too hard to be Crazy In Love Pt II (Part III?). But it still slaps. It's also the first time Bey tried to use her Louisiana roots to background her music (which she did more successfully in Lemonade)

**waluigiest** (9): incredible intro to the album - the chord progression and harmonies on the pre-chorus are magical

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.7): Love the funky vibes. Also she demonstrates really great vocal control on this song.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This bops a fair bit, Jay ate a bit for once.

**Qwilphish** (8.5): Beyoncé calling in her instruments - legend

**ditacarlita** (8): i don't get the hate for this song, sure it's not crazy in love but does it have to be? any other musical couple would love to release something this good, caramello and shawn the sheep could never

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): The best Jay/Beyoncé collaboration on the album.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): yes we are bopping

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): as a baseball fan from the mid-2000s I smiled more than I’d like to admit at the Juan Pierre reference

**timothy444** (7): Quite enjoyable

**yourfacesucksass** (5): LOVE the video, the song on the other hand....The chorus is so jarring to me.

Possibly one of Beyonce most iconic hits, at least before Lemonade, here's were B'day gets laid to rest. Personally I've never really bought the hype over this song- it's not bad dont get me wrong, but there's so much better on this album both in terms of bops and ballads. The midtempo just doesnt work to well for me and reminds me of her lesser songs like If I Were A Boy

---

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Maybe one of my fav Bey songs, cuz I'm basic. Also I think the first time I have given her my highest score in a rate.

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic, I remember not being able to find this song when I was younger cause I didn't know how it was spelled oop

**agentofscranton** (10): whew socialist queen

**bespectacIed** (10): Funny how Karl Marx and Max Engels went quiet after Bey released this. Her longest solo number 1, iconic in all levels, a smash hit, TO THE LEFT, TO THE LEFT!!! ☭☭☭📣💥🔴🔴🔴

**DaHumanTorch** (10): my parents raising me conservative: omg we are so proud of you for voting for trump............me become more and more liberal every year voting for the dem candidate in the 2020 election and lying to them about it: to the left to the left

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This is a perfect pop song.

**gannade** (10): to the left, to the left. this intro is so iconic

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A classic Beyoncé song. Her voice has matured a lot since here (and it sounds a lot better), but I think this is still a great song.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): She ended all men, YAS!

**J\_Toe** (10): I was really confused the time I misspelt it in a youtube search and found Irreemplazable (not knowing she did a Spanish version).

**jexan13** (10): the starting guitar is perfection and the lyrics and hook is just great. This will very likely win, won't it?

**lilguavachan** (10): an iconic breakup anthem!

**oscarbrierley1** (10): timeless bop

**Qwilphish** (10): I AM... 100% that bitch

**rickikardashian** (10): it's crazy to think that at some point this was Beyonce's biggest hit, because I feel like now there's at least 5 songs that could be considered her signature song now. This woman has made sure to hit everytime she is allowed to and keeps on topping herself all the time

**rsmitty99** (10): I frickin love this song. Ne-yo's magnum opus

**skargardin** (10): She's a classic

**timothy444** (10): Probably the best song that Beyonce will ever perform or sing!

**waluigiest** (10): a song for listening into in the backseat of a car and just emoting

**wavingwolves** (10): the reason why I'm a leftist today

**starlightzone** (9.5): ugh this song defined everything about this era of break up songs. i feel it was powerful in the way that very few songs could be. she's rich you fucked up get out and stop back talking.

**slimboyfriend** (9): but this production still sounds stiff and dated!

**starla\_** (9): I really do love this but it was so overplayed back then that I'm still reflexively sick of it

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.4): my politics be like "to the left to the left"

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): it’s a classic, there’s really not much more to say

**JunkyGS** (8): absolute smash, but it never felt like a Beyonce song. That is also cemented by the fact she rarely performs it and couldn't even be included among her 40 track amazing Homecoming Live Album.

**maybe9** (8): why do i know all the words

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (8): I go through phases of feeling tired then liking this song again.

**anothertown** (7): one of my least favorite singles of hers, but that bridge is so good, classic beyonce bridge

**ditacarlita** (7): this song was EVERYWHERE in Australia to the point that I'm STILL sick of it, having said that I've put that feeling aside and rated as fair as i can, not a bad score considering I don't like Beyonce ballads

**evilqueenlex** (7): the big single that I also didn't like very much

**fadedblue09** (7): Iconic, but as with Shake it Off, a bit weak and generic in the context of the album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This song is good but it’s really aged, Beyoncé moved past this kind of music for a reason.

**MrSwearword** (7): it's fine for what it is, but there's always been better Beyonce songs and its backstory of being a song Ne-Yo wanted for himself but was told "this is something a girl should sing to a guy" and Chrisette Michele rejecting it is more interesting than this.

**Overall Average**: 7.691 **// Average Controversy:** 1.722

---

**starlightzone** (9.222): what if there was an album created with no bad songs on it

**bespectacIed** (9.111): Beyoncé's first visual album. An album often overlooked in Bey's amazing discography, but an amazing, commercially successful album nonetheless. B'Day is black country girl hoe extravaganza, a collection of really well-produced fun, sultry bops that really showcases Beyoncé's affinity to her Southern roots and classic RnB. It's a known fact that [country girls make do](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQo1P96Z7JBw4jAMrIuxTzYF8lPOoc6exvhsZToFJWI9EK74szV), and in this album, Beyoncé sure did.

**fadedblue09** (8.367): Overall, this album mad me appreciate Beyonce's artistry altogether. People say Beyonce the artist only showed up in 4, but this is a counterargument against it. Assuming Sasha Fierce was just some weird interlude into the mainstream, the transititon from this to 4 makes sense.

**waluigiest** (8.167): I know all of her albums from 4 on front to back, but this was a bit of a blind spot for me. The singles were just as fresh and there are some great deep cuts too. Overall a really solid project.

**evilqueenlex** (8.083): yes I have the visual album

**jexan13** (8.028): I remember hearing Dangerously In Love and absolutely hating it. I feared this was going to be the same... Turns out it was pop perfection. The beats, the vocals, everything about this is amazing. The energy is almost overwhelming and I love it. IMO, this is Bey's 2nd best album, only after s/t. Also, this is the best album of this rate BY FAR. But the standard edition is way superior.

**megm26** (7.761): Beyoncé has a beautiful voice, but I feel like the production fell flat a lot of the time.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.683): It's hard to rate any of Bey's first three albums knowing that she would make such better music later on.

**yourfacesucksass** (7.583): Great album, can't help but pronounce it as "bidet" though

**timothy444** (7.333): I don't normally like Beyonce but it was a mostly decent album. The standouts such as Irreplaceable and Check On It were absolute fire!

**ditacarlita** (7.139): take away the ballads except for irreplaceable and you have a stellar album

**slimboyfriend** (7.028): Damn they really diluted a great album with this deluxe edition, huh?

BIG early 2000s teen high school comedy energy. I can easily see this being played during the shopping spree at the mall montage part of the movie

---

**agentofscranton** (10): sounds exactly like something that would be used in a shopping montage in a trashy mid-00s teen movie

**bespectacIed** (10): Fuck Dr Luke, I hope he burns in afterlife; heck, I hope he burns on Earth right now. But this song is pop perfection as pop perfection goes, THE soundtrack of the mid 2000s, and so much better than anything today's white blonde pop girls has threatened us with

**CandlePrince** (10): A Classic, seemingly simplistic yet highly memorable.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): She sounds so unenthused while recording this but it kind of works?

**J\_Toe** (10): imho this song is better than Stars Are Blind (though Stars is a more unexpected song)

**MrSwearword** (10): Paris' best song, deal

**rickikardashian** (10): this is the gayest shit to ever be made and I love it, I'm sorry

**yourfacesucksass** (10): Can't stress it enough, this song paved the way for 2010 pop music. Does not get the credit it deserves!

**DaHumanTorch** (9): this is so good, it really brought me back to when i was a kid in the 2000s

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Paris is racist/homophobic and is basically the epitome of a terrible rich person, but evaluating this as a piece of pop cultural history, it bops. The video is a major YIKES though.

**ditacarlita** (8.5): wow I haven't heard this in YEARS and I didn't even know this was Paris, I can only imagine how good this would be if someone who could actually sing had this song and maybe if it was sped up in the chorus, no offence to Princess Paris

**skargardin** (8): bop

**wavingwolves** (8): remember the music video for this one? is there anything more early 00s than that?

**slimboyfriend** (7): Still a good song

**waluigiest** (7): this is like if you made an AI listen to every pop song released 2002-2007 and then asked it to produce one

**rsmitty99** (3): God this is basic

Legitimately one of my favorite songs of the mid 2000s, period! When Paris revealed she was releasing an album with this lead single, everyone pretty much took it as a joke. Paris was a huge joke if you recall, and yet this came out way better than it had any right to. Even Lady Gaga loves it! So here you go Paris, congratulations on your rate win

---

**agentofscranton** (10): i wanna live in the alternate universe where paris hilton is a respected pop superstar after this absolutely smashed the charts like it deserved to

**bespectacIed** (10): THIS HAS NO BUSINESS BEING THIS GOOD. This song is literally cotton candy perfection. Fuck Paris's Trump supporting ass, but pop culture would literally be nothing without her.

**evilqueenlex** (10): the queen of reggae

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This song and actually Paris's whole album was brilliant, mindless pop.

**rickikardashian** (10): Im not even going to act like this is a shitty song and meme it to a win, I actually do love this song. This easily could have been a No Doubt song and get praised to death, but instead it gets no recognition and it's left to be rated against Tardy For The Party

**rosecult** (10): lady gaga said she loved this and ia

**skargardin** (10): pop perfection idc

**CandlePrince** (9): The impact of this song on tropical pop, iconic.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I think the thing that’s most shocking about this song is the intelligence of the lyrics? Like these are very poetical.

**J\_Toe** (9): I have a Paras named StrsRBlnd on Pokemon Go thanks to this subreddit's insistence this song needs more attention.

**waluigiest** (9): I love ska!!!

**wavingwolves** (9): it would be a 10 if it wasn't a paris hilton song

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): The vocals really aren't bad, and the beachy vibe is a pretty nice change for a 2006 pop song

**ditacarlita** (8): it's cute and I love Paris, her voice isn't strong enough for this song though

**slimboyfriend** (7): Ok, but this song is actually good

**DaHumanTorch** (6): i might get dragged for this, idk the sub's opinion on paris but i didn't love this but it was still cute

**rsmitty99** (6): I don't get the love for this song. It barely alright.

The song that catapulted the LAMB era into a legitimate superstar blockbuster, this song was burned into the minds of most of us at a very impressionable age- I still bananas like that to this day! Underneath the nostalgia though, I really cant say this is a good song, and overplaying has reduced it to being pure annoyance to me

---

**gannade** (11): legendary

**slimboyfriend** (11): I know like 3 of y'all are gonna be contrarian and rate this song low but just know that it's not cool to hate perfection

**waluigiest** (11): this was my favorite song in second grade, which was a huge deal. I was OBSESSED. I really think it awakened something inside of me.

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic, all I need to say. That little bit of tuba(?) in the second verse is something a genius can come up with.

**agentofscranton** (10): my french teacher in year 6 used to do this thing where she'd sing the bananas line in french but replace the fruits to help us learn how to spell fruits in french. she was a bit over strict and she slept with our headmistress and ended up getting fired, but the headmistress stayed on which was a bit fucked. life of a gwen stefani stan eh?

**DaHumanTorch** (10): I urge everyone to listen to the Black Death parody right now...this was my shit in seventh grade: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZy6XilXDZQ ... OOOH FLEAS ON RATS FLEAS ON RATS

**ditacarlita** (10): just interrupted my boyfriend working by dancing to this with 2 bunches of bananas next to my head

**ignitethephoenix** (10): People who say Pharrell sucks clearly don’t know about this song because the production is iconic and our Queen Gwen teaches us how to to spell a bananas!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): COURTNEY LOVE CAN SEETHE!!!!!!!!!!!!

**jackisboredtoday** (10): one of the first pop songs I ever liked so I owe it too much to give it any less

**maybe9** (10): the original stomp clap banger

**MrSwearword** (10): anyone calling this her best song, you're basic as shit. However, over the years, I've come to appreciate this jam and have always gotten my life to the production because Pharrell in 2004 was a GOD.

**rickikardashian** (10): this song is the sole reason why I have always wanted to become a cheerleader, because the thought of lifting a girl and doing some backflips while this plays gets me too hyped up

**rsmitty99** (10): Iconic. Whenever anyone spells "bananas", they dead ass sing this song in their head. Gwen's influence.

**skargardin** (10): I swear this song will never get old, perfectly obnoxious and campy.

**starla\_** (10): b a n a n a s

**TiltControls** (10): 🍌

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): queen of spelling

**sailormunelune** (9.5): Bananas

**wavingwolves** (9.5): thank you for your work, courtney love

**anothertown** (9): I love that even though this song is relatively minimalist it still sounds at home on this album with maximalist songs like WYWF

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): Very fun but very mid 2000's

**starlightzone** (8.9): To be honest, I listened to the entire thing before remembering I'm supposed to be rating them and not just jamming to them. Hollaback Girl is such a good song, and I really love it.

**megm26** (8.2): this song is my shit

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8): Fun to sing, and it's great for getting hyped up, but nothing about it is special besides the bananas part.

**J\_Toe** (8): Is it bad that I liked this song *until* it played at my year 12 formal (australian prom) and I got to see a bunch of basic people jamming out to it?

**rosecult** (8): fun fact, the music video was filmed at my bff's hs (before she attended it) and they make it look a lot nicer than it really is

**jexan13** (7.5): I used to love this song when I heard it in the radio or in the street... but when I played with earphones my love took a hit. It's catchy, but a) the production feels incomplete in some way and b) the bridge is way worse than "spelling is fun!". It's still good

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I respect how weird and influential this song is but on a purely musical level it doesn’t do much for me.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): I appreciate the production and it will forever remain one of the most iconic and unique songs of the 2000s, but it gets grating on the ears towards the end.

**Qwilphish** (5): not as b a n a n a s as it would have you believe, I get bored half way through

**bespectacIed** (3): Charli XCX's whole career was built on this song, part II.

Possibly the smoothest song on this album and maybe in her entire career (Touch My Body is close!), this serve is an easy 10 for me. Great placement for this song especially considering no one gave it an 11, an extremely uncontroversial hit!

**lilguavachan** (10): outsold taylor swift

**maybe9** (10): the tempo is so GOOD

**MrSwearword** (10): oh wow, a song that deserved number one on the Hot 100 instead of fucking We Belong Together.

**oscarbrierley1** (10): the 19th number one we don't deserve

**Qwilphish** (10): this is how you do a comeback

**rickikardashian** (10): this is the contrary of maximalist pop and it still pops off hard. the power of a good melody

**starlightzone** (10): read what I said above, nothing negative, this song is just pop perfection.

**timothy444** (10): After all those years, this song is still a massive bop! Taylor Swift who? Only queens allowed here!

**waluigiest** (10): bops bops bops

**wavingwolves** (10): this is soooo smooth and sexy that it makes me sad that I get so little action these days. it features some of the nicest mariah's vocals

**jess\_22** (9.5): This will always be the superior Shake It Off

**yourfacesucksass** (9.4): The quintessential Mariah- R&B ease, spitfire delivery, catchy af hook "shake shake shake it off"

**rsmitty99** (9): Growing up, I didn't really like this song. It definitely grew on me over the years. Those quick "Hooo! Hoo!" at the beginning are incredible.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): the number 1 that never was. Also really fun.

**ditacarlita** (8.5): I'm usually not one for slow pop song but this is so smooth, yes Mariah!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This song was a grower, I didn’t much care for it the first time I heard it but I’ve really come around on it with time. It’s a little bit weird on the first listen because of how low-key it is but once you really get into the melody and lyrics it’s a ton of fun.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Ended Taylor swift tbh

**jexan13** (8.5): Florence's is mystic. Taylor's is fun. Charli's is avant-garde. Mariah's... is a good lullaby.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): the most iconic song to bear this name

**1998tweety** (8): Chill bop

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Take 5 ended ha

**fadedblue09** (6): Surprisingly weak in the context of the album. There are far better single choices than this one.

An effortlessly beautiful song about staying together with an ex as friends, this was a no brainer for my 11. This is a timeless synthy, sad banger in the vein of Cyndi Lauper and Carly Rae Jepsen that I can listen to endlessly. It has only managed to sound fresher and remain even more relevant to me as time has passed since its release in 2004 and for that, we have to stan!

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): this made 10 year old me SO emotional when it came out and it still does! such a timeless melody and the production still sounds fresh

**fadedblue09** (11): The perfect love nostalgia song, with the crisp new wave production to match it, which adds to its timeless quality. Normally, I don't agree with the tracks popheads overhypes, but this one deserves the acclaim.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): This is legitimately one of the best pop songs of the 2000’s.

**J\_Toe** (11): Cool (and Early Winter and 4 in the Morning from Sweet Escape) could honestly belong to an album titled Melodrama before Lorde got to the concept. Just listening to it makes me feel like a rich Italian socialite battling with the pain of unrequited love on the shores of Lake Como, all while transitioning between time and hair dyes 😭.

**letsallpoo** (11): this had middle school me in my feelings, reminiscing on relationships that never existed

**rickikardashian** (11): this song just makes me feel many things. I feel warm and fuzzy whenever I hear it, and I get way too nostalgic considering this is not my song. I don't know if the "I know we're cool" is meant to be 100% genuine, or if it's just faking it till it makes it, because the way Gwen sings it has such a melancholic way to it, either way the message keeps on being perfect. Gwen has made a lot of my music, most of it very good, but this is just on another level, and she has never made anything like this, which is a shame because my body desires another song that makes me feel the way this song does

**worlds-okayest666** (11): I heard this song in a Wal-Mart once and it was a religious experience. I say that a lot but this time, it truly was.

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh what a jam. I love the verses and chorus on this song, they give off a feeling like you're drifting/floating.

**bespectacIed** (10): Yeah I won't get mad if this wins the rate, it's just effortlessly cool. It's also the only song in the album that doesn't feel like a caricature of something else. One of the best songs of the 2000s.

**ditacarlita** (10): literally one of the best slow-fast songs ever

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): GOAT music video. This song is a masterclass really, the lyrics are explicitly nothing but positive but you can still tell from the performance and the subtext that she’s hurting.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of the most perfect songs about a mutual breakup and moving on

**jexan13** (10): if you're cool then why is this the saddest song on this rate.

**MrSwearword** (10): seriously, this is her best song. It's sung so beautifully, written very well and the music video is so tasteful.

**Qwilphish** (10): ahead of its time, gives me high school nostalgia type vibes

**skargardin** (10): A classic that I used to love back when it was on the radio but funny story, I never registered it to a single artist or anything and I actually never knew was Gwen until I listened to this album like a week ago and i was SHOOK to the core!

**starla\_** (10): the best song on this album hands down

**starlightzone** (10): Cool is an easy 10 for me. Whenever I think of the best Gwen Stefani song ever, three come to mind (one from each of her non christmas albums), and out of those 3, Cool is just this beautifully chill song that I can't deny a 10 to. Nothing compares to Cool in my mind and I could listen to it for hours on repeat.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): a true cultural phenomenon we were lucky to witness

**waluigiest** (10): is this the best breakup song ever written? maybe

**wavingwolves** (10): it's impossible to listen to this song just once so it's been on repeat for almost two hours and now I'm afraid that I won't be able to finish this rate. this just strikes something in me instantly. it's such an early 00s type of song and it's still able to sound fresh. it can sound a little dismissive but still so genuine at the same time. idk, I just love it

**DaHumanTorch** (9): A great chill song, I just don't like it as much as the phenomenal first three tracks of the album. Lyrically amazing though, there aren't a ton of good songs about remaining friends with youe ex.

**rsmitty99** (9): I love the production of this song. Sounds like it could be on Carly's Emotion. Got that 80s vibe.

**slimboyfriend** (9): Yes she can have her immature moment on Hollaback Girl and then sing an emotionally mature song about being secure in your friendship with a former lover years later! Gwen can do almost anything except comeback

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.6): The synths are kinda lame, but Gwen's songwriting is solid on this, and it's an interesting POV we normally don't hear.

**megm26** (8.3): I guess you could say... this song is cool

**anothertown** (8): me the second my plane touches down to visit my parents in california: Remember Harbor Boulevard, The Dreaming Days Where the Mess Was Made????

**maybe9** (8): how could i forget about this bop

**Overall Average**: 7.457 **// Average Controversy:** 1.729

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.042): kinda one of the greatest pop albums of all time and one of the first i stanned before i even knew stanning was a thing

**rickikardashian** (8.475): this album is so fucking weird for a pop album, like a lot of the elements shouldn't work at all, and somehow they do perfectly, it's such a bizarre experience and I'm so glad it was as successful as it was. also truly appreciate how gwen is so respectful and appreciative of all the people she made this album with, giving them proper credit on interviews and stuff

**ditacarlita** (8.292): This came out around the time we got pay TV when I was 15 and had access to the music video channels and I was obsessed with all the videos off this album, brings back such great memories for me. At the time I was too "alt myspace girl" to be into pop music but once I was watching music video channels and saw former punk girl Gwen doing pop so well.... I could no longer deny my love for pop music. I loved it. Not a bad song on this album!

**fadedblue09** (8.200): This album was unexpectedly enjoyable! First time I listened to a Gwen album and I admired the colorful aesthetic and diverse music influences throughout, and how it spans multiple genres. Despite that, the album still has a cohesive musical identity which makes it a unique 2000s pop record.

**megm26** (7.950): I really enjoyed listening to this, it's full of great pop bops.

**starlightzone** (7.892): honestly this song defined the 00s for me. I could listen to this album for years to come and still be thinking about how Crash didn't get the music video it deserved.

**jexan13** (7.333): I really didn't know what to expect from this. Having most of the singles at the beggining of the album is a red flag for me, and, indeed, this album is way better in its first half than the second one. As an album this isn't too good, but some songs individually slap hard.

**waluigiest** (7.333): okay some massive bops but at what cost

**slimboyfriend** (6.917): This album sounds like its cover

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.533): Really impressed by the production quality on this album. Super interesting and varied. It feels of it's time, but not dated if that makes sense. Tbh the weakest link was the songwriting. Gwen's unique vocals and presence tie the album together.

**wavingwolves** (6.458): I have several problems with gwen stefani and her usage of other cultures for aesthetic purporses, especially how she directly treated "her" harajuku girls, but this was one of the most important pop albums for me growing up and I still think it's great. it just brings me back to that time instantly and I'm so fond of it for that reason.

**bespectacIed** (5.917): The mid 2000s was a rough spot for white pop girls. In an era where RnB and hip-hop IS pop, we saw so many of our pop girls acting a fool: mixing and matching cultures and they have no business of and being awful caricatures, with Gwen probably the biggest culprit only narrowly beaten by Xtina. Adding salt to the wounds is what Gwen turned out to be fifteen years later 💀 But holy shit, is this album so well-produced, fresh-sounding, and ahead of its time (cough cough, Charli's blueprint cough cough).

**timothy444** (5.750): Frankly, I found this album quite the snoozefest. The singles were decent enough to stand on its own but the second half to be sooo boring. The only things I can really remember from it is that awful cat sound at the beginning of Harajuku Girls. Gwen Stefani doesn't have the star power of other pop girls and she should stick to her band instead, where actual good music gets played.

The crowning jewel of one of the greatest comebacks of all time, theres not much more that can be said about this iconic song! Clearly you all scored with great respect as pretty much you all agreed on how amazing and iconic this song is. I cant exactly disagree, but I think its a victim of its own hype and overplay- there are better slow songs on this album!

Watching the tug of war between this and Cool play out in real time was fun, as basically no other song even came close to touching the #1 and 2 spots. WBT sat on the top for the first half of the voting period, then Cool took over, and they swapped a bit back and forth until the last day of balloting when WBT finally distanced itself with it's insane 9.69 average

---

**bbfan132** (11): the second verse might be one of the most clever/quirky verses in a major hit that i’ve heard - the “wait a minute, this is too deep” line alone moves this up to a 10 for me, and the key change at the end boosts that score up to an 11. pop/r&b perfection.

**bespectacIed** (11): I'm a staunch, sometimes delusional, often oppressed Beyoncé stan, but in a rate called "Mid 2000s Pop Excellence", We Belong Together is the right winner. It's just a simple contemporary RnB ballad that showcases Mariah's two best weapons: her vocals and her songwriting. It seems like a fluke, that a song with actually top-grade vocals and meaningful, smart songwriting (that bobby womack line??? chef's kiss) is the biggest song on the charts. But on that sweet summer of 2005, it wasn't.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (11): This is probably my most played 00's song. Honestly the most iconic music comeback in music history.

**lilguavachan** (11): need i say more? it's an iconic single that relatable from a woman no one expected to come back after having a mental breakdown. it's literally the song of the 00s! how could i not give it an 11?

**mylps9** (11): Kidzbop CANCELED 💅

**oscarbrierley1** (11): I mean song of the decade says it all

**rosecult** (11): this was my favorite song ever when it was released... my itunes shows that it has the most plays with 1007

**rsmitty99** (11): I just wanna take a minute and reinforce the claim that this is the best comeback in pop music history. Bar none. You could argue britney a few years after this. But Mariah hadn't had a hit in YEARS. She went through HELL with glitter. Was paid to LEAVE her label. Attempted a comeback with Charmbracelet and she flopped AGAIN! She should've been done. Then out of fucking nowhere, she gets a song that lounges at #1 for 14 weeks and is the biggest song of the decade. Blocks her own damn song from getting to #1. Then isn't satisfied and writes another #1 hit for the deluxe album. Then wins 3 grammys. Come on. That'd be like Katy Perry releasing her next album, it flops. Then comes back in 2023 and has her biggest hit ever. Can it happen? Sure. Highly unlikely? Understatement. What Mariah did with this song is, simply put, a miracle. The arrangement is simple. The melody is straight and true. The ending climax is powerful. Everything about this song is just perfect.

**skargardin** (11): What can I say? It's a timeless classic.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (11): the comebacks of all comebacks. Skinny legend

**1998tweety** (10): Excellence, I would not be sad at all if this won the rate (as it was my second choice for my 11). The vocals at the end..whew.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i sound like the kidz bop version when i sing along to this

**DaHumanTorch** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it. possibly my favorite mariah song ever, the vocals are so smooth and beautiful

**fadedblue09** (10): Definitely a 10/10 Mariah song.

**gannade** (10): i kinda hope mooriah doesnt win this rate because she has the weakest album by far but damn this song did THAT

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A classic in every sense of the word

**J\_Toe** (10): stop mentioning Kidz Bop it's not that original (even if it is hilarious)

**jess\_22** (10): It feels wrong to give this anything less than a 10

**maybe9** (10): if you dont fake cry singing this song, dont talk to me

**Qwilphish** (10): I cri evertim

**rickikardashian** (10): add this comment to the pile of people mentioning the kidz bop version of this song

**sailormunelune** (10): Classic

**starlightzone** (10): tbh if get me bodied wasn't on this list it would get my 11 because this is the perfect Mariah Carey song. No question about it. Everything about it hits just right and I can't say there's a single negative thing about it.

**timothy444** (10): One of the best Mariah Carey songs of the 2000s. Her vocals are perfect and the melodies are just so smooth!

**waluigiest** (10): yes I have sobbed to this song before yes I still deserve rights

**wavingwolves** (10): I mean, I don't think ANYONE is capable of giving this song a score under 10. mariah's vocals are fucking perfection and this is a classic. basically a song that birthed me

**jexan13** (9.5): cute. The last belting chorus made this song's much better

**anothertown** (9): her belt at the very end is just one of the best moments that we get to experience in life

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Mariah gave us everything with this song, her lyricism is fantastic, her voice sounds great, the melody is iconic, it just all works. It’s not my favorite #1 by her but it is undeniably an important one, however despite this being a HUGE hit I somehow don’t foresee it winning the rate.

**yourfacesucksass** (9): A great ballad at this time of her career, but not my fave on the album

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): one of the most iconic songs of the millennium, plain and simple… this is what all big vocal power ballads aspire to be

**ditacarlita** (8): a cute song, not sure why this was number 1 for so long though, It's Like That is way better

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Kidz Bop ended ha

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.5): the kidz bop version outsold

**MrSwearword** (0): NOT THIS BULLSHIT AGAIN. There aren't enough synonyms for trash, so I'll just finish with FUCK THIS SONG and be done with it.

MrSwearword: It's just a really terrible and maudlin ballad. Plus the overplay I experienced when I was growing up...I just really fucking hate the song.

MrSwearword: For those of you who allowed [We Belong Together](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch) to win, you don't get to enjoy the Pussycat Dolls reunion considering that song blocked PCD from ever hitting #1.

yatcho: # The Emancipation of Mimi

---

**Overall Average**: 7.717 **// Average Controversy:** 1.698

---

**JunkyGS** (9.500): Literally my third favorite album of all time along with being an album of my childhood, so my average will be high, but I am just being honest.

**starlightzone** (9.322): this is actually one of the first albums I bought and I'm ashamed to admit I haven't listened to it all the way through just yet. Time to fix that shit now.

**bespectacIed** (8.306): I'm not a lamb and even I know that lambs are overprotective and overzealous about this album. Rightfully so, it's only the triumphant return to form of the greatest vocalist in music, although lambs will scoff at that because they SWEAR Charmbracelet is an amazing album. I've never listened to this in full but after finally doing so, I realized my respect for Mariah's talent could still increase, it's Mariah flexing everything she's great at wrapped in a fucking gorgeous album

**megm26** (8.239): this is such an excellent album, it was released over a decade ago but it still sounds fresh today. Mariah is incredibly talented.

**waluigiest** (8.167): a classic album, if not a bit tired towards the middle. It’s not bad by any means (it’s actually super good and the singles are highlights of her career) but it stops being as fresh

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.950): Surprised how much I enjoyed this album! I was worried it would be filler to support the singles, but it's a solid listen with lots of 70's-inspired R&B.

**timothy444** (7.944): There's no doubt that Mariah Carey is an extremely talented singer so it comes to no surprise that this album is filled with so many bops, most of which have been released as singles. Carey's vocals on the first four tracks definitely stand out in particular in a good way! What I didn't like were half of the collaborations which were just poor quality. Still, this is a fun listen.

**evilqueenlex** (7.917): the first album I ever bought and still listen to regularly

**fadedblue09** (7.422): The only album I've listened prior to this rate. Ironically, she got my lowest average. Tbh, I don't dislike this record. It's just that I really had mixed feelings towards certain tracks here that dragged it down. If it weren't for those stinkers, I'd say everything's equal.

**rosecult** (7.333): i remember asking my dad to buy me this album when i was 13 and i saw at costco.. i still love it years later

**ditacarlita** (7.167): This is my first time listening to this album apart from the singles and I'm expecting a fucking masterpiece the way everyone goes on about it. Roughly an hour later - I'm at least a fan.

**jexan13** (5.694): I enjoyed Caution. I (somewhat) enjoyed Music Box. But this... I'll put it clear, is one of the worst albums I've ever heard. I almost dropped this rate due to this album. Everything in it sounds the same! And it's not a good same, it's a boring same! It has some nice songs, but this turned me off completely from Mariah. I tried to be merciful.

MrSwearword: > although lambs will scoff at that because they SWEAR Charmbracelet is an amazing album.

There is no Mariah stan in their right mind that would say Charmbracelet is a listenable album

bespectacIed: That statement was based from experience, I tweeted charmbracelet slander years ago and got called out by two delusional lambs

Squedboi: Lmao how did you pick the one LAMB single that's not in my playlist? Don't get me wrong, it's a good track, but WYWF is a slapping track, not to mention Rich Girl. Also Hollaback Girl is for nostalgia.
