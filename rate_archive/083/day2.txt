The delicious 80s vibes continue on this really smooth track from Gwen and our first casualty of day 2. Like a lot of the back half of LAMB i think this is really underscored, I mean no one else was really doing the 80s revival thing yet like Gwen! a true shame

---

**fadedblue09** (10): Love that synth riff in the chorus

**anothertown** (9.5): The back half of the album takes this really 80s turn and this is the best part. A whole banger.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): Wow more spelling lessons, gwen truly invented education

**Qwilphish** (9): the best her voice has sounded and the production is freshhhhh

**skargardin** (9): The hook is EVERYTHING

**1998tweety** (8.5): This started off a bit meh but it quickly picked up.

**ditacarlita** (8.5): the best album track, could easily have been a single in UK and Europe

**rsmitty99** (8.5): yeah I like this

**starlightzone** (8): It's like a worse Real Thing, but it's still good. On this album,it's definitely a top song. I don't know what all to say about it, I just think it's a great song.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.8): Would be higher but I despise the Casio keyboard strings at the beginning.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.6): Okay we were on a down swing for a minute there but this is prime.

**J\_Toe** (7): does the whole 80s pastiche thing better than Crash.

**jexan13** (7): the chorus is irritating

**maybe9** (7): this song is SEXY

**yourfacesucksass** (7): I can appreciate the music here

**ImADudeDuh** (6): oh no I think i’m over this album

**waluigiest** (6): it’s like Crash, but with less charm

**wavingwolves** (6): it goes a little to long but the instrumentals and production are so good. it's kind of dated but it still has some kind of sophistication to it

**MrSwearword** (1): unacceptable garbage

The middle stretch of Emancipation starts to drag here in my opinion. Yes Mariah serves vocals as always, but we've just heard her vocal acrobatics for 5 or 6 songs now and it starts to blend in. Still, it's not a bad track, just gets lost in the tracklisting. I wish I knew more to say about it

---

**fadedblue09** (10): Love the brass instrumentation and subtle jazz influences. Reminds me a lot of Subtle Invitation

**lilguavachan** (10): okay brass section, give it to me

**maybe9** (9): the break away got me fucked up

**starlightzone** (9): I just don't jive with this as much as Circles and often forget about it. However, it's still a worthy ass nine.

**waluigiest** (9): what I’m realizing as I get through this album: Mariah’s soundscape, voice, and production will carry any track. This is romantic and large and wonderful, even if it blends into a lot of the project as a whole. It’s stunning and the contour with the live sounds is great

**wavingwolves** (9): the instrumental is flawless. gives me goosebumps, ugh, so good

**1998tweety** (8.5): It's cute.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (8.5): really cute

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.2): She's giving us VOCALS on this.

**bespectacIed** (8): The monologue is so cringe it looped back to funny. But again, damn, otherworldly vocals.

**MrSwearword** (8): so the album has this tendency to have the same kind of pleasant enough material for Mariah to slay and this is another case of it. It's not bad but somewhat uninspired.

**rsmitty99** (8): That whistle note is ridiculous

**DaHumanTorch** (6): i really liked it during the first chorus, especially the horns. however, as the song went on, i began to like it less and less. the crowd cheering was fine but it really annoyed me when it played during her big whistle tone near the end. it was really distracting and ruined the moment for me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Tbh this is the first song on the album that disappoints me. It has a lot in common with some of the songs that I adore but it just doesn’t click for some reason, maybe I’m just tired of this kind of song by this point in the album. Her putting the live crowd sounds in kind of explains why I don’t like it, this is the kind of song that goes off live but because I’m listening to a recording I can’t connect as well.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): why does she sound like Beyonce when she talks

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Jim and Jesse ended ha

**timothy444** (6): Not horrible but awfully boring.

**Qwilphish** (4): I don’t remember anything about it and I just listened to it

Beyonce adorns some Prince drag well before Janelle Monae was even an idea. This funky, brassy sound really works for her in opinion and I'm a little sad this is an early day 2 exit

---

**gannade** (10): this beat sounds like exactly like Work It Out lmao (which is a GOOD thing)

**lilguavachan** (10): one of my favorites from beyonce ❤

**MrSwearword** (10): underrated gold like a motherfucker

**skargardin** (10): FUNK queen, this song is so hot

**bespectacIed** (9): Songs like this make you wonder why Bey is shut off by country lovers and was vilified for attending the CMAs, Bey is country-er than everyone's faves

**jexan13** (9): imagine being Bey's twink and getting spoiled by her riches. like, is there better destinies out there?

**rsmitty99** (9): "Come sit on mama lap"

**starlightzone** (9): I don't have much to say on this song, I just think it's so fresh and funky fun.

**1998tweety** (8): Suga from BTS outsold, this is a cute bop though. Those vocals at the end of lawd she took me there.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): the songs the last few tracks haven't been as good as the front of the album ive noticed, but still are bops

**fadedblue09** (8): Fifth Harmony who?

**rickikardashian** (7.8): "come sit in mama's laptop"

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Proud Family Representation

**timothy444** (7): Nice soul track! I can see myself dancing to this when no-one's watching.

**ditacarlita** (6.5): it's okay but not really as good as the rest of the album and certainly isn't helping me peel my apples, fail

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.5): I like the song, but the vocals feel too polished for the production which takes me out of it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): It’s just a little recursive at this point on the album.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): a filler song if I ever heard it, and not even a good filler song

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i only have 1 suga mama and she’s on The Proud Family.

**maybe9** (3): album filler song boo

**Qwilphish** (3): this is... slightly disgusting

Heiress to the Hogan Empire, somehow Brooke Hogan get a spin off show and solo career from a very forgotten reality franchise. Still, this song is honestly a bop and a half. Perfectly captures the 04 hip hop sound that filtered down to basic white girls a few years later

---

**rsmitty99** (9.5): This song is fantastic

**CandlePrince** (9): Such a good song

**MrSwearword** (9): there's better Brooke Hogan songs but also far, far worse in that regard and this rate.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): i just now put together brooke is hulk hogan's daughter im......

**rickikardashian** (7.7): this sounds like diet Naughty Girl

**yourfacesucksass** (7): This song is trying to be too many different people, and yet she still chose to be Brooke Hogan

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.3): Feels like a Danity Kane reject.

**ditacarlita** (6): generic but alright

**skargardin** (6): it's alright

**evilqueenlex** (5): this really is so 2007 though

Truly part two outsold in my opinion. This is fine, but Twista takes up too much of the song (remember when Twista was a thing?) and all it has gonig for it is a nice hook. Good riddance for day 2

---

**fadedblue09** (10): Is this Breakdown 2.0? I just love it when Mariah is rap-singing.

**lilguavachan** (10): mariah is really the queen of rap features, she just works so well with all the features on this album

**starlightzone** (10): this gets a 10 for sing rapping, no i'm not joking, this is incredibly good. And I love when Mariah hits her high notes in the back. I think Twista does shit right here, and I think it's just such a good romantic song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I feel like Gwen is going to be really celebrated for being ahead of her time in this rate (rightfully so) but Mariah had her sights set on the future too. This song still sounds fresh today, the chiller production and Mariah’s rapping are exactly what a lot of r&b/pop girls are going for these days.

**skargardin** (9): Twista went OFF

**timothy444** (9): Yes, it's a Mariah Carey song but Twista steals this with his verses! It makes her look pale in comparison.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.9): The better ones of this album

**bespectacIed** (8): gorgeous vocals, queen of songs with a part II on the same album

**DaHumanTorch** (8): This would've been an easy 10 if it weren't for Twista's feature. It didn't fit the song very well and really killed the vibe for me.

**ditacarlita** (8): i'm surprisingly okay with these slow songs

**MrSwearword** (8): energy this low should be earning ire but Mariah has talent on her side to not make this one a total waste. Twista is also good on this.

**1998tweety** (7.5): This was alright, one of the better features here

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Adele ended ha

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): the Twista feature actually really elevates this one

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.4): Not a bad song, but her annunciation when she's using her head voice kind of annoys me? Also while Twista's cadence and vocal presence changes things up, he doesn't bring much to the song lyrically.

**rsmitty99** (6): Never felt this song

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (6): It's alright

**wavingwolves** (6): sorry mariah but gowon outsold!

**evilqueenlex** (5): I could never get into this song

**jexan13** (5): didn't i hear this one already?

**Qwilphish** (4): same as the previous song, Her voice is nice but that’s al this gives me

**maybe9** (2): Twista ruins this song

Gwen said I didnt ask to be born Latina, no mas tuve suerte! and you know what, she made SEVERAL points in this smooth banger. The sample is fire and Gwen rides it through some truly luxurious lyrics in the verses. The music video with the Slim thug feature really enhances it all. A shocking placement for this song in my opinion, it really should've been a top 15 song.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Oh my lawd the production on this is so damn good and Gwen makes her vocals fit it so well.

**bespectacIed** (10): This sounds like 90% of what k-pop boy groups has released in 2019, I kid you not 💀 Gorgeous song and production. 2000s pop is known for its celebration of excess and wealth, this song is my favorite embodiment of that

**fadedblue09** (10): Love the slick R&B vibes on this one.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Another semi-problematic video from Gwen (she’s clearly going for a “chola” aesthetic and it’s… not great) but I appreciate the intention here, I like that she spotlighted normal working people instead of just doing a cliche “look how much money I have” video. I love the sultry r&b vibes of the track and the lyrics are ace, this song really does sound luxurious.

**MrSwearword** (10): and this is considering it got a remix/official video with Slim Thug who would normally fall under "superfluous rap verse" but because he was a rapper that flowed with the song/actually knew how to fit on the song, it adds a nice bonus to a great song.

**rickikardashian** (10): I feel like this I the most 2000s song to be ever be created. I can straight up picture this playing out of someone's bedazzled flip phone

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): not quite single material but ugh it makes me feel exactly like the title... CH-CHIIIIING

**anothertown** (9): amazing sample. Great little production flourishes and I love when she says “sensitive and delicate kinda like a tuberose”. Point off though cause I hate the bridge.

**ditacarlita** (8.5): one of the best uses of a sample of all time

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.4): Great use of a sample! Living for Gwen's slinky/campy delivery.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): I loved the French in this, it really contributed to ther sexy vibe of the song. Also the bridge!!!! My favorite part for sure

**rsmitty99** (8): Maybe it's the sample, but this song groves. Really like the harmonies in the chorus. Verses are meh.

**skargardin** (8): Probably the weakest of the LAMB singles but still pretty good

**starlightzone** (8): ugh I keep going back and forth on Luxurious for one very strong reason. I think the Chorus hits harder than any of the verses could dream of. And then there's the end part of ch-change. Which I think is the only reason I rate this song as an 8. If it did not have the chorus that slapped like it didn't deserve, I'd probably rate it lower.

**yourfacesucksass** (7.7): I like the direction of the sample and sound, even the "cha-chings"

**gannade** (7.5): personally i prefer fergies glamorous

**ImADudeDuh** (7): queen of sampling

**Qwilphish** (7): this is pure sex energy, the sample is hot

**wavingwolves** (7): another materialistic bop, but this time it reminds us that being rich is supposed to be a sexy thing

**starla\_** (6): I always felt like this was a parody of R&B

**waluigiest** (6): loses momentum but I guess it’s not actively bad

**jackisboredtoday** (5.4): the sample and production give some great G-Funk feelings but the song that they built around it just doesn’t really work for me

**jexan13** (5): the cartoons' "sneaking around on tip toes" sound effect is... how I feel about this rate

**J\_Toe** (4): low point of the album

**maybe9** (2): you cant sample an amazing song and do it worse

Really cute in the shorter version in the music video and as an interlude in homecoming. Slightly too long as its own thing, and the whole pussy/cat concept is not enough for a real song. Bye to this song

---

**anothertown** (10): quite frankly

**bespectacIed** (10): I seriously considered giving this my 11 because I just can't get enough of this song and it's my personal favorite song on the whole rate. Seriously, this is just four minutes of Beyoncé dragging a man to filth and talking to her own vagina, how can anyone not stan???? Let's go, little kitty kat

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): pussy rights!

**DaHumanTorch** (10): ok 4 10s in a row for me, beyonce is serving with this album wow. this was such a bop, the chorus was so catchy and addictive

**evilqueenlex** (10): why did my mom let me sing this around the house like it was nothing?

**fadedblue09** (10): Love the slightly dark vibes on this one. I'm surprised this is considered underrated? I guess this is the No Angel of this album.

**gannade** (10): im feelin this song!

**MrSwearword** (10): even with the music video being too goddamned short, this song is great. A telloff that cuts to the chase of saying "you ain't gettin' this pussy anymore."

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.4): Fun fact--this is Tyler, the Creator's favorite Beyonce song.

**1998tweety** (9): Some of the lyrics on this are a bit odd but besides that it I really like the vibe.

**yourfacesucksass** (9): Needs. To. Be. LONGER. Leopard eye makeup for daysss

**ditacarlita** (8): i'm already buttered up by the cat references and it's also just a sexy fucking song

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is a subtle one, I wasn’t into it when I first heard it but I listened to it again with headphones and all of these little riffs and intricacies came out that really elevated the track for me. Probably the sexiest Beyoncé gets in the rate.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): kinda surpringly a bop despite the title

**skargardin** (8): Boppy

**wavingwolves** (8): I'm a big cat person so I appreciate this

**starlightzone** (7.9): Much like the last song it's not a favorite of mine but I love it for different reasons. I love the slow feel of it, and it just feels so sensual and relaxing to just listen to while laying down rubbing your hands on your body no I won't justify myself.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Honestly could have been an interlude the length of the music video, but it's still so smooth

**ignitethephoenix** (7): A little cringey

**jexan13** (6.5): this song is the worst in the standard album. It's almost like something from DiL

**J\_Toe** (6): I love how many songs from this era were made into videos. But this one is weird.

**Qwilphish** (6): this production is fuego but the actual song doesn’t match

**waluigiest** (6): a bit messy but not unpleasant

**maybe9** (5): im not interested in this song

**rsmitty99** (5): I can recognize every song by Beyonce whenever it starts. But I remember watching her perform at Coachella and she started rapping this song and didn't recognize it. That's because I skipped the song every time as a kid. Taste hasn't changed.

**timothy444** (5): Poor; it sounds like filler!

To anyone that believe Jay-z and beyonce made up the whole narrative of Lemonade for a hit album, Beyonce has been telling y'all about it since 06 and this song is proof! The Lemonade comparisons kind of end there though, as this is a boilerplate standard upset ballad otherwise and I dont have a lot to recommend about it. The live performance in Paris is great though

---

**anothertown** (10): I just listened to the victoria beckham demo for the first time omg

**bespectacIed** (10): ONE OF MY 11s. A song that successfully embodied the old school female RnB crooner, it won't be out of place in an old Motown record. One of her most heartfelt songs ever, one of her best vocals, one of my favorite Bey songs ever.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): wow these lyrics...powerful and heart-wrenching. i could feel the pain in her voice in this especially at the end...chills. i also liked the static at the end, i don't know why it just really felt right

**evilqueenlex** (10): jay ain't shit but slow it down

**jexan13** (10): I don't get the hate for this song

**lilguavachan** (10): proto-lemonade

**oscarbrierley1** (10): she may have been attractive but beyoncé has this song

**rsmitty99** (10): When she does this song live and gets to the part "I know she was attractive…but…" If you a fan, you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about

**starlightzone** (9.8): This compliments Ring The Alarm so well and I think it's beautifully done.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.1): VOCALS.

**MrSwearword** (9): if only because it took the Wynn Las Vegas rendition to leave me SNATCHEDT. Other than that, it's great.

**waluigiest** (9): such a strong performance omg. Is the mixing off?

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Some people think that the whole Jay-Z cheating thing was cooked up to give Beyoncé a narrative for *Lemonade* but it’s actually a theme that goes WAY back in Beyoncé’s music and this is the proof. The doo-wop sound is a nice change of pace on the album and I’m giving it a bonus point because of [how hard Beyoncé crushes this live](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5bz35u).

**1998tweety** (8): This was cute, vocals jumped.

**gannade** (8): she is screaming in my ear and omg i feel it

**timothy444** (8): It's a slow ballad but it's bittersweet in a good way. The lyrics are deep and it's a good track to place in the second half of the album.

**CandlePrince** (7): I prefer Victoria Beckham's version but this is good too.

**fadedblue09** (7): Love the country/folk flavors on this one.

**maybe9** (7): beyonce finally sings, pog

**Qwilphish** (7): Beyoncé ballads usually don’t do it for me, but this is beautiful

**wavingwolves** (7): a pretty nice ballad

**ditacarlita** (6): another ballad, great, i can't stand it when albums go banger banger ballad banger ballad, omg the vocal olympics towards the end makes me want to die

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Kesha outpeaked massively

**J\_Toe** (5): the title sounds like it could have been one of the chapters in Lemonade

This following Circles in the tracklist kind of feels like a mistake, they start to blend together and compared to Circles it just doesnt do it for me quite as much. Still a decent song, and a decent placement for a decent song

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song is SO under appreciated, it just makes me happy every time I hear it. The weird chirpy vocals in the background give it this really cartoony feeling and I love the way that the vocal lines spill all over each other like Mariah is tripping over herself with a schoolgirl crush. She sounds so peppy!

**lilguavachan** (10): a cute little bubblegum-y bop... that's also relatable fuck off mariah!!!!!!!!

**timothy444** (10): She. Also. Did. That.

**starlightzone** (9.7): this has more preferred vocalization over circles but theyre still both top tier songs.

**1998tweety** (9): Ooh finally a song that makes me feel something, a shame it's super short. The chorus on this is great.

**Qwilphish** (9): a JAM(turn it up)

**waluigiest** (9): this production is so glitzy and nostalgic, I’m pretty into it

**wavingwolves** (9): underrated af

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.9): She sounds amazing on this! Also the production does a great job of making a classic-sounding melody more modern.

**anothertown** (8.5): whole bop!

**bespectacIed** (8.5): In every popheads rate, I always find a song I think Carly Rae Jepsen should have sung/covered/stolen. This is the one.

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): loved the production in this song. definitely more in the middle of my overall ranking of this album, but still a great track.

**rsmitty99** (8.5): She could never do this song live. But who cares

**fadedblue09** (8): Reminds me of some Charmbracelet songs for some reason (and I don't hate that album btw)

**MrSwearword** (8): cute and pleasant

The vocal legend absolutely jumps out here, paired with Stay the Night this really, REALLY made me respect Mariah's vocals and her willingness to do it all even in some deep album cuts

---

**DaHumanTorch** (10): The vocals on this were SUPERB wow. She rode the beat so smoothly ugh i loved this. easily one of my favs so far.

**lilguavachan** (10): (god warrior voice) i can hear god

**maybe9** (10): my soul mom jam

**MrSwearword** (10): oh my god this is so good

**rosecult** (10): the vocals.. my wig

**starlightzone** (9.5): I don't even know how to describe my feelings on this song. I love it.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): Brilliant. Great vocals.

**timothy444** (9): She. Did. That.

**waluigiest** (9): her voice!!!!

**CreepyMannequin** (8.5): Post Malone who?

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This song is stealth catchy, it pops into my head randomly every now and then. I really enjoy the songs on this album where angsty Mariah lets her full voice out.

**1998tweety** (8): It's kind of cute, the bar is low at this point.

**rsmitty99** (8): That run to the whistle gets me every time

**wavingwolves** (8): post malone wishes he was this powerful

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.3): Sounds like it could've been a forgotten Minnie Riperton b-side (in the best way).

**bespectacIed** (7): A less interesting rehash of Breakdown (Mariah's best song of all time btw). I'm having a hard time critiquing Mariah songs that I find boring because they are ALL sung beautifully

**Qwilphish** (7): smooth as helllllll and she obviously sounds amazing

**fadedblue09** (6.1): One of those songs where it feels like Mariah thinks her voice is the only thing she has to give.

**skargardin** (6): pretty disposable

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Post Malone ended ha

**jexan13** (4): Post Malone is unbothered

She is BELTING here, its an amazing vocal performance and the first sign of what's to come in the rest of this album. Had this beena  single or something I think it wouldve performed better,a s a lot of you were impressed but held back on your scores for some reason. A decent placement in the top 20 for this song at least would've been fair

---

**bespectacIed** (10): Holy shit this song is insane. I know I liked it before but the relisten blew me away

**fadedblue09** (10): A serious contender for my 11. Love the classic R&B production on this one.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Actually one of my favorite Mariah songs, it’s one of her simpler tracks but the emotions and vocals are everything. Like she just goes to town here and pours her soul into it, not to mention that *key change* near the end. I doubt she can ever sing this live, it’s just that powerful.

**JunkyGS** (10): VOOOOOOOCALS. OMFGGGG SHE ISNT HUMAN! Fucking puuuuurfection.

**lilguavachan** (10): she sang the shit out of the song, and she produced the shit out of this song... the flavor....

**maybe9** (10): this is just a vocal flex and im here for it

**rosecult** (10): love this... her vocals, lyrics, everything slays. it would be my 2nd choice for my 11

**rsmitty99** (10): Trivia: This song was nominated for best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance at the grammys. Cause duh

**skargardin** (10): Underrated and godtier

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): So underrated. The vocals are amazing

**timothy444** (10): From the relaxing instrumental to the powerful vocal performance, it shouldn't be surprising that Mariah can deliver a stand out ballad of a track!

**waluigiest** (10): this is FANTASTIC!! The orchestration, the emoting, the ownership, the way she says “irrelevant”

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): emancipation of screami

**oscarbrierley1** (9): vocals

**starlightzone** (9): God this song hits so many right notes. It deserves such a good score on this and I think it's just so good.

**wavingwolves** (9): makes me want to go to a nice restaurant with a lover and look deep into their eyes while I talk about dumb shit

**yourfacesucksass** (8.8): GREAT vocals, maybe too 90s in the instrumentation though?

**DaHumanTorch** (8): for some reason this felt a bit shouty / oversung at times which usually isn't the case with Mariah songs. Still a great song though, and I loved the lyrics and the outro

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.4): I like the song, but I feel like she goes for belting too soon and there wasn't enough to build to that chorus.

**1998tweety** (7): The vocals on this are quite good, but I've come to expect that from any Mariah song so this doesn't stand out in particular.

**ditacarlita** (7): , hey a ballad and I don't mind it actually

**MrSwearword** (7): slightly veering into sappy territory but I'm not mad at it

**slimboyfriend** (6): I can barely distinguish jazzy R&B jams from each other, so idk if this song is good or not

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Taylor Swift again ended ha

**Qwilphish** (5): obviously stunning but I’m bored not for me

**jexan13** (3.5): a bathroom break in an album! How nice!

**gannade** (3): snoozefest

Vocals!!!! Putting this right after the very low-key Say Somethin was smart, I was not ready to be completely dewigged like that. Absolutely gutted this just missed out on the top 20, like you all should be ashamed at the scores for this masterpiece!

---

**bespectacIed** (10): BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM. I can see why the fags and hags worship her, Mariah's voice is out of this world

**fadedblue09** (10): Zedd who? A better single choice than Shake It Off tbh.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Zedd ft. Hayley Williams ended ha

**lilguavachan** (10): mariah and kanye really did that on the production, and mariah singing her head off? mawma just keeps delivering bop after bop

**oscarbrierley1** (10): vocals and when kanye was good

**rosecult** (10): a bop!!

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.6): I get that this wasn't right for a single, but this would've been a huge hit in like the 70's.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Kinda random that she worked with Kanye for this one but the production is great so good on you Mr. Kardashian-West. ANOTHER great deep cut, I love how “conflicted” this track sounds.

**rsmitty99** (9): Very Kanye

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): should have been a single

**starlightzone** (8.7): I don't think it's as strong as some of the other songs here, but I really enjoy how smooth it feels. I think my problem, much like It's Like That, is that it feels that weird sounds are added for no reason.

**ditacarlita** (8.5): had to listen twice because i got distracted by the fact that i tried peanuts again while cooking and I didnt hate it?! wtf is going.. is Mariah doing this?! She's making me like peanuts after nearly 29 years of hatred?!

**DaHumanTorch** (8): wasn't crazy about the chorus but i LOVED the verses. I think my issue with the chorus is that I wanted it to be more mellow / lowkey like the verses were. The transition from the chill, smooth r&b to the powerful chorus did not do it for me in this song like it should have.

**MrSwearword** (8): vocally, she's on fire but something feels...dated but not by much

**timothy444** (8): I prefer the Zedd version with Hayley Williams and not Mariah Carey :janet:

**yourfacesucksass** (7.6): It's good and eh at times

**rickikardashian** (7.5): the bassist is just doing whatever the fuck they want to, aren't they

**1998tweety** (7): Another song where Mariah just kind of relies on her vocals, not bad but also not really interesting.

**anothertown** (7): I’m trying to imagine Mariah and Kanye in the booth together

**jexan13** (7): my god, it's too hard to notice nice song in between so many sleeping pills.

**maybe9** (7): her high notes save this song

**Qwilphish** (6): chill anime beats to study to

Outstanding vocal performance. Doesnt really fit in to the tracklist that well but i dont really care, its that impactful. Top 20 is okay for such a stacked rate but really side eyeing all the  big vocal powerhouse performances going out in a row

---

**1998tweety** (10): Whew the vocals on this, sis is really taking me to CHURCH.

**bespectacIed** (10): No one touches her vocal prowess in this generation of main pop girls, people who disagree are either delusional or simply just haters who definitely stank

**fadedblue09** (10): People say this was "tacked on", but I disagree? The whole album was inspired by Beyonce's role in Dreamgirls. If anything, it's more fitting than some of the bonus tracks.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): I definitely lipsynced to this while listening just now.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Can you BELIEVE that this lost the Oscar for Best Original Song and was a big factor in why the rules were changed to limit the number of songs a movie could be nominated for?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS

**Qwilphish** (10): THE VOCALS JUMPED OUT

**rickikardashian** (10): The writers of showgirls must be still making tons of cash from everytime someone sings this and And I'm Telling You in The X Factor or any show of that kind

**sailormunelune** (10): Dreamgirls was peak Beyonce acting tbh

**timothy444** (10): This is pure raw talent coming out of a legendary mouth!

**wavingwolves** (10): makes me fucking wish I had an ounce of her vocal talent

**starlightzone** (9.8): like i said what if there was an album with no bad songs on it and listen nails it perfectly. I think this is probably the best showcase for her vocals.

**agentofscranton** (9.5): from personal experience, if you go to a filipino karaoke party odds are you'll end up hearing this sung by SEVERAL women throughout the night

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Good cover but I’m kind of side eyeing them putting this song on the album for the extra sales boost

**jexan13** (8): powerful message and a great vocal delivery. My only complain is that it 100% doesn't fit in this album.

**rsmitty99** (8): Vocals are unreal. But it can be much.

**waluigiest** (8): I was wondering why this seemed like a melodramatic Broadway ballad lol

**yourfacesucksass** (7.8): Can only think of the dubbed Vine.

**gannade** (7.5): jhud kinda sucks but she did end beyonce here, that one time

**DaHumanTorch** (7): her vocals were superb but you can kind of tell this is for a film adaptation of a musical

**rosecult** (7): i liked it a lot more when it came out but it's as little too cheesy for me nowadays

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): I mean this is a fairly plain power ballad but Beyoncé is better at these than almost anyone else

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): love bey but this is overrated

**MrSwearword** (5): I've legit never used this besides an "eh, she's fine with it live" moment. Horrendously gassed up by the fandom.

**ditacarlita** (3): MAKE IT STOP

Give it to mama is slightly corny… still goes off though. This encapsulates the sound of the B'day era very nicely and reminds me off stuff she'll go on to do later like Countdown. A nice score and placement for this slightly underappreciated song

---

**agentofscranton** (10): road safety never sounded better

**bespectacIed** (10): a better Green Light better than your resident white pop girl

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): one of her best and most underrated songs!

**DaHumanTorch** (10): wow three songs in and its just bop after bop. how am i just now hearing this album

**evilqueenlex** (10): this should've been bigger why did America fail Beyonce like this?

**fadedblue09** (10): Feels like the ancestor of Countdown

**ImADudeDuh** (10): she ended that fad Lorde, but cultural icon Pitbull still remains unbothered

**MrSwearword** (10): finally, a Green Light worth liking in a rate. Brunette Beyonce, A1 production, a video that Kalomira more or less jacked for Secret Combination...this has EVERYTHING.

**jexan13** (9.5): yes, run me over queen

**yourfacesucksass** (9.1): Underrated, and promotes healthy thoughts about motor vehicle safety

**anothertown** (9): The breakdowns with the horns make this song good but the bridge with the guitar and then the horn coming back in makes it great

**waluigiest** (9): not melodrama but honestly it still smacks

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Wow I can’t believe Beyoncé was inspired by Lorde to right this song. Lorded impact!

**Qwilphish** (8): catch me in the fucking club

**slimboyfriend** (8): Enthusiastic consent anthem

**starlightzone** (7.9): This is the one song i almost always skip when listening to the album in full but that was when I was younger and I'm gayer now. I don't obsess over this song like I do some of the others but its still such a good listen. I like that there's just some power in this song about a woman taking control of who she is with her lover.

**1998tweety** (7.5): Miss Lorde and traffic both outsold but this bops a bit

**ditacarlita** (7.5): ooooo yes girl, a perfectly satisfactory album track from start to end

**J\_Toe** (7): Lorde and Kylie Minogue and shooketh (do ppl still say that?)

**jess\_22** (7): [insert Lorde comment]

**rsmitty99** (7): This song is kinda weird. Some of the lyrical rhythms are all over the place. Chorus is kind of uneventful. But that "GO! GO! GO-oo-OH-oo!" goes off.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.8): In retrospect, Beyonce does songs with a similar vibe much better on her later albums. Also, I feel like the Neptunes were already recycling this beat by 2006.

**maybe9** (6): a huhuhuhuh

Tyra is legendary in so many ways, and my favorite of them is that she's legitimately insane. That chaotic energy doesnt come off in this single though, leaving a very decent and respectable but kind of generic tune. So here it is, the last of day the bonus songs on day 2

---

**CandlePrince** (10): Classic, one of Darkchild's best productions.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): camp classic

**lilguavachan** (10): the power this song holds

**MrSwearword** (10): legendary track that legit went nowhere and that's a shame

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.7): I know this kind of went down in history as being a terrible mess but looking back I’m not really sure why? Maybe it’s just that ANTM owns me but while she wasn’t going to be selling out stadiums, this is a solid song and she gives a better vocal performance than most of the bonus rate. If you want to hear a bad Tyra Banks song, [listen to “Bootyful”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvOzH94SsbI&frags=pl%2Cwn) (which high-key sounds like a Kpop song). Unrelated but [Naomi Campbell had an album.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZy8SjLyA0)

**bbfan132** (8): this is a fun song but really, people should watch antm if you like trashy reality tv because it's full of ridiculous moments that are beyond iconic.... stan natasha

**bespectacIed** (8): I have watched every episode ANTM like the true f-word that I am, and I can honestly say that Tyra is worse than Hitler. But this is a bop that could make Janet gulp

**rsmitty99** (7): The song isn't bad. This would be much better if J.Lo did it

**waluigiest** (7): beyonce-lite

**ditacarlita** (6): reminds me of Spice Girls third album

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5.2): Not terrible, but I actually wish it worse because then at least it would have a campy quality to it that would make it more fun.

**DaHumanTorch** (4): hi hi, its ty ty !!

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): It's not straight up good and not bad enough to be good either

Another proto-Lemonade song on this very early album, this goes the fuck AWF. Angry Beyonce is possibly my favorite blend of Beyonce and really the most personality we get out of her these days. This was really close to the top 10 for most of the voting period, unfortunately it slipped down to day 2 in the last couple days. Sorry to this song

---

**bespectacIed** (10): ONE OF MY 11'S. I love screaming every damn contrived line of this song, this is the best expression of female anger in recent music, only topped by Bey herself exactly ten years later with Don't Hurt Yourself. That fucking ring alarm is ingrained in my soul. The fact that this song is hypocritical cuz she's still married a cheat, hmmm, let's just look the other way!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): dont hurt yourself the prequel

**gannade** (10): this is what lemonade shouldve been

**lilguavachan** (10): i still think of that vine. you know the one. i hope it's one of the shitposts.

**MrSwearword** (10): WHEW what a banger. Exceptional and wild.

**starlightzone** (10): okay yeah i have to give this a 10 because its just a rough song and it's very much her powerful voice filled with anger which we don't always get. I think it's such a powerful song here.

**evilqueenlex** (9.5): jay z aint shit

**anothertown** (9): the first time I ever really noticed Beyonce was at the 2006 VMAs when she performed this song and i was amazed at how hardcore she and Bibi were. Recommended viewing

**Qwilphish** (9): you can not go wild listening to this

**rsmitty99** (9): This song has always been good. But we now have "Don't Hurt Yourself", which is better.

**sailormunelune** (9): Lemonade Prelude

**waluigiest** (9): tell me why I was introduced to this song in a madden football game........

**wavingwolves** (9): I have to admit that I had no idea what she was saying before because I didn't understand english but now that I do I still don't understand anything. love it tho! don't care about the words!

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.9): The VMA performance of this is iconic.

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): for some reason this reminded me a lot of don't hurt yourself, especially when she was all angry. this would be higher but after awhile i began to get a bit annoyed by the alarm noise in the background. it triggered my fight or flight tbh since i grew up in the midwest with tornado sirens

**ditacarlita** (8): i feel like i want to stomp and throw shit everywhere but also joyously bop and clap at the same time

**jexan13** (8): i've never in my life heard anything remotely like this. It's like three kids on a trenchcoat, but somehow, it works

**yourfacesucksass** (7.9): This song goes hard in rage, and the sirens signal the Queen's rampage

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Too much noise here

**ImADudeDuh** (6): we love Deja 2

**timothy444** (6): I prefer Pound the Alarm by Nicki Minaj tbh

**1998tweety** (5): The only screaming I tolerate is from Demi or Xtina. The alarm sound is also quite annoying.

**J\_Toe** (5): if you want a wild read, check the controversies section of this song's wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_the_Alarm#Controversies

**maybe9** (4): i remember this song being better than it is

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): This album has like, *straddled* the line of just being annoying and I think this song just crosses over into being obnoxious noise. The loudness and clashing production are just too much here and Beyoncé sounds way too harsh for no reason.

Not gonna lie, this couldve been shorter. It's great and low-key for a good 2 minutes then a little aimless for the outro... still that 2 minutes is really, really nice. For the last song of day 2, I think it's not a bad spot

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Another deep cut favorite of mine! Mariah and Snoop Dogg worked together on *Rainbow* for [“Crybaby”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B0P--IU_Pw&frags=pl%2Cwn) (an underrated song) and they make a great team both times, Snoop’s sleepier voice really bring out the best in Mariah’s since she pulls back to match him. I love the way the chorus of this song drops down into that heavy part of her voice and the “so whatcha gon’ do?” part is so seductive. The Neptunes also do great on the production, this song feels so slick and honestly still fresh.

**jexan13** (10): all it takes is adding a bit of energy and a nice beat to a Mariah's song and it becomes enjoyable

**lilguavachan** (10): mariah, the neptunes, and snoop dogg work so well together! the song is so silky and smooth

**starlightzone** (9.5): I think this is an ideal Mariah collab. I think Snoop just works well with Mariah and they're just so smooth together. I think Snoop's part also allows him to show off his best vocals.

**bespectacIed** (9): That 4-count intro is almost comforting. Snoop was soooo not needed tho.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Justin Timberlake ft. Christina Aguileria and A Great Big World ft. Chris Stapleton ended ha

**rsmitty99** (9): The Neptunes can make any song a fucking groove and a half.

**skargardin** (9): Snoop went off

**timothy444** (9): It sounds like all of Mariah's other songs except with a Snoop Dogg verse and it feels like he adds something to the song, rather than being a pointless rap feature. Most certainly a bop!

**yourfacesucksass** (8.8): To me the instrumental would even work in this decade

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.6): This song is SMOOTH. Love the production.

**ditacarlita** (8): a lush album track

**maybe9** (8): this was worth my while

**MrSwearword** (8): cute and funky

**Qwilphish** (8): smooth bop jam the house down boots yas gawd *toungue pop*

**DaHumanTorch** (7): i liked the production a lot in this but Snoop Dogg's feature really brought this one down for me. i've never liked him as a feature artist for some reason (save for a few exceptions @ california gurls)and this song did nothing to change that opinion. Mariah did her thing though

**fadedblue09** (7): Could've been less repetitive tbh. One of the few songs on this album where the rap was actually a blessing.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (7): not a favourite of mine but it's cohesive with the album

**waluigiest** (7): lush, but lacks the substance that the previous tracks had

**wavingwolves** (7): sorry but I got nothing to say

**1998tweety** (6.5): Mariah sounds pretty good on this but Snoop's verse ain't it.

**anothertown** (6): not one of my favorite neptunes productions
