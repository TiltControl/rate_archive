It's my first time listening to Gwen and Bey's albums, and I enjoyed both of them. Gwen's in particular surprised me, it definitely sounds unique for a mid 2000s pop record, and I haven't listened to a lot of her stuff before. A pretty consistent and fun listen throughout.

In what likely surprises no one, this song is dead last by a rather large margin. I think we all unloaded our thoughts and feelings on Gwen Stefani's long, LONG history of being a culture vulture here and I cant really bblame anyone for it. This song itself is inoffensive but also... a mess. A love letter to her posse of japanese girls, in theory, it's extremely superficial and just wierd. Random cat noises and japanese giggling, on top of a weird spoken word style delivery. No, just no

---

**gannade** (10): yes its problematic idc it goes off

**bbfan132** (8.5): the lyrics are not good but the song is a total bop :S :X

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): problematic bop! like yes i should score it lower because she literally dips into a terrible accent but the beat and melody are so great smh

**1998tweety** (8): I know this will get dragged and it's certainly not as good as the previous songs on the album but it's still nice.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): Harajuku Girls walked so tiny bbq grill and 7 rings could run...ok jokes aside I actually like this song a lot despite the questionable lyrics and "aesthetic"

**fadedblue09** (8): I feel like this is gonna be one of the more controversial songs in the rate, but I honestly enjoyed it and I have no regrets.

**evilqueenlex** (7): is it appreciation or appropriation??? feels aggressively like both.

**skargardin** (7): SUPER KAWAII

**rickikardashian** (6.7): I'm sure that the whole Harajuku girls thing Gwen had was never meant to be mean or mean spirited, but honestly I would be way more offended by this song than any cultural appropriation she did back then, not because it's all that offensive, it's just fucking disastrous

**ditacarlita** (6): drags on a bit

**starlightzone** (6): I like the song but I can't deny it's basically an audio tour of Harajuku. And unlike the last song, the verses are better than the chorus. The chorus is absolutely 40 year old woman who just went on a trip once to Japan.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Ugh, these comments are gonna be annoying as fuck. Also, what the fuck is this bridge

**J\_Toe** (5): Minna saik≈ç, arigat≈ç, ka-ka-ka-kawaii Ka-ka-ka-kawaii

**sailormunelune** (5): Hello Kitty, you‚Äôre so pretty

**starla\_** (5): this sounds like Good Charlotte's I Just Wanna Live but with added cultural appropriation

**yourfacesucksass** (5): I can't even, definitely just a song to ode to the Harajuku Girls but really??

**agentofscranton** (4): UwU minna saikou, arigato! ka-ka-ka-kawaii! xD OwO

**jexan13** (4): The "super kawaii! That means cute in japanese" is like chalks in a slateboard. Caricaturas chinas was a mistake.

**MrSwearword** (4): oh dear god. It's at least far better made than Avril's Hello Kitty but jesus fucking christ this is more of a misstep than Katy's last four singles.

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): Ok, by itself this song isn't too yikes, it's just very camp and Gwen talking about fashion is very Gaga's Black Jesus/Amen Fashion by way of Avril's Hello Kitty....... which is bad I guess yeah

**anothertown** (3): She didn‚Äôt even need to do this because she has entire verses about the harajuku girls and Japan in like 2-3 other songs?? She really put female weebs on the global stage huh.

**rsmitty99** (3): Alright, this song has been foreshadowed throughout the first half of this album. And‚Ä¶huh. This hasn't aged well. The guitar riffs are good, I guess

**jackisboredtoday** (2.5): this feels super weird to listen to and gets downright uncomfortable, especially with the context of everything Gwen did promoting this album

**letsallpoo** (2): the chorus reminds me too much of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDr742MGZJ8

**bespectacIed** (1): I remember thinking this song was more problematic than it is. It's actually just a really bad, corny song that praises the said tokyo street culture, no harmful intent or anything I think. It just feels problematic because Harajuku IS inherently problematic

**jess\_22** (1): ...it's a yikes from me

**lilguavachan** (1): why... did she get four japanese girls... to just stand around her... and she really told people that they were a figment of her imagination....... why...................................................................................................................................

**maybe9** (1): why does this exist

**Qwilphish** (1): this was definitely a moment that happened that definitely should not have happened

**frankiefrankiefrank** (0): There's so much to unpack here that I'm not even going into it. Too bad because the production's dope.

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): I‚Äôm an Asian-American (my mother is Vietnamese my father is white) and growing up doing theater I became really hyper aware of race as it relates to entertainment, so I‚Äôve done a lot of research on this topic/have firsthand experience with it and my take on this is that the Harajuku Girls thing was #not #great. I‚Äôm going to talk about it at length here because this sub is TERRIBLE at respecting Asian people/cultures and goes ass out every time we talk about cultural appropriation so I feel the need to speak up. I think that this is the textbook example of cultural appropriation, which is ironic because I think the song is quite nearly an example of the coveted ‚Äúcultural appreciation.‚Äù In the song Gwen acknowledges her place as an outsider in their culture and shouts out the people who inspired her. It‚Äôs clear that she has a genuine love of the Harajuku subculture and I‚Äôm sure that she meant all of this as a loving tribute. HOWEVER, things went super far off the rails in the execution. It‚Äôs not enough to experience Harajuku culture and appreciate it, Gwen must also *possess* it, she must become the purveyor of it. Her love is expressed through her repackaging it as her own to sell to audiences these people could never dream of reaching on their own. There‚Äôs an inherent imbalance in power here: as the wealthy, white, American pop star, Gwen has much more cultural sway; she gives them credit, yes, but the fact remains that for the vast majority of people their primary point of of contact with Harajuku culture is a white woman‚Äôs interpretation of it. I can‚Äôt be too harsh on Gwen because honestly, in a capitalistic society still reeling from the effects of imperialism we don‚Äôt have the vernacular to ‚Äúappreciate‚Äù other people‚Äôs cultures, and we won‚Äôt until all countries are (somehow) equal on the world stage. Hell, in some ways I think Gwen was actually *ahead* of her time for highlighting a specific, more fashionable Japanese subculture rather than just the generic ‚Äúcherry blossoms/anime/advanced technology‚Äù associations a lot of people had around the time. I spoke to my sister about it (she was a huge Gwen Stefani fan at the time and loved the Harajuku Girls) and she said while she cringes looking back, it was an important part of her Asian representation. I‚Äôd be willing to grant some clemency for that‚Ä¶ EXCEPT 15 years later Gwen is still pulling the same shit with her stupid *Kuu Kuu Harajuku* show! You could write an entire dissertation on a white woman skinning a foreign culture to use was a cutesy aesthetic for a tv show where she‚Äôs the self-insert hero and then [rapping the word ‚Äúkawaii‚Äù multiple times in the theme song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9RlxjyHnXg&frags=pl%2Cwn) This bitch [does not talk politics with her country singer boyfriend](https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1129659/celebs-are-vocal-about-the-election-but-not-gwen-stefani-blake-shelton/) and it shows. I don‚Äôt usually hand out zeroes but I cannot abide by racism, and the song itself is ‚Äúeh‚Äù anyways, and way too long.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): This song is a choice but I will let everyone else write think pieces on it because I don‚Äôt have the time or energy.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): This song just kind of makes me feel weird. I don't know know if it is cultural appropriation in a bad way or not, but it does make me personally feel uncomfortable.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (0): sorry I don't make the rules just enforce them

**TiltControls** (0): Building up to "Cause it's super kawaii, that means super cute in Japanese" has to be one of the worst lyrical deliveries of the 2000's.

**waluigiest** (0): I heard the album in full for the first time in high school, and I remember being completely disgusted when this came on. On top of being infantilizing and appropriative, this is just not a good song.

**wavingwolves** (0): not even nostalgia can make me appreciate this because the lyrics are plain awful and this whole harajuku girls thing makes me incredibly uncomfortable. I can't believe there's people who think this is proof of gwen stefani being "appreciative" and "respectful" about japanese culture. like. lmao. no, thanks

In kind of the extreme opposite of the previous song, instead of dragging Gwen for being culturally insensitive we drag her for trying to be woke about race. The way she just cant win skjsksss

---

**skargardin** (10): the way this just fucking SLAPS

**starlightzone** (9.5): I find that the beat is similar to Danger Zone with how frantic it can be, but I think the duet aspect of this song where she's working with Andre 3000 to push it all the way through. The Chorus is just a beautiful mix of their voices and that's what I think is so beautiful about it.

**bespectacIed** (9): the better usage of Andre in the album, it's so experimental and trippy

**waluigiest** (9): I want this Gwen to beat up Harajuku Girls Gwen.

**ditacarlita** (8): makes for an interesting collaboration and a great album closer

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): There is a LOT to criticize about Gwen and her relationship to race throughout her career but I really have to applaud her for her message with this song, and it sounds good too. The frantic synths fused with other genres she does here and ‚ÄúBubble Pop Electric‚Äù sound fantastic, I wish we‚Äôd get more music like it.

**MrSwearword** (8): definitely an interesting way to close the album.

**worlds-okayest666** (8): ended racism

**megm26** (7.7): when I started playing this album, commentary on interracial relationships was the last thing I expected.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): There‚Äôs more potential in this song than what is actually executed. I appreciate the message but it could have been done better.

**jexan13** (7.5): wii menu music snapped and went woke

**rsmitty99** (7.5): Well that intro spoken word was‚Ä¶artsy. The rest of the song sounds like a prince throw away song. But pretty funky.

**1998tweety** (7): Erm yeah lemme drag just this one. It's trying just a little too hard also I'm def not one to cry about cultural appropriation but Gwen of all people trying to push this message is a bit yikes

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): her ~~whiteness~~ witness era in a song

**ImADudeDuh** (6): She really thought she did something here huh?

**wavingwolves** (6): there's something too simplistic about the message of this song and it just sounds like a basic andre 3000 track

**rickikardashian** (5.5): this has the same energy as slam poetry, full of weird metaphores and phrases that don't make all that much sense, and yes, im referring to upgrade computer

**DaHumanTorch** (5): I really didn't like Andr√© 3000 on here or the overall production. I liked the message of the lyrics a lot, though I thought they were a bit corny at times. Definitely my least favorite on the album and not a great closer.

**TiltControls** (5): Love the lyrics and idea of the song, but honestly I think the production is a bit of a mess

**jackisboredtoday** (4.9): I wanna like this so much because I love Andr√©3K, but I‚Äôm sorry this is a mess

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): Yes I agree racism is bad, but this song still confused me

**anothertown** (4): the metaphors‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre bad

**fadedblue09** (4): Ok that was a weak closer.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (3.7): I appreciate Gwen attempting to address social issues, but the song and the beat don't really go together (it almost feels like a remix), and she doesn't do a great job of going past superficial platitudes :/ Also kind of random to have this song close out the album.

**agentofscranton** (3.5): when i looked at this tracklist for the first time cause of this rate and i saw that these two had collabbed i went mental and wondered why no one ever talks about it, then i listened to it.

**Qwilphish** (3): they both sound terrible, usually Andre is a feature king so this surprised me as being particularly bad

**maybe9** (1): this song gave me anxiety was

This kind of makes no sense? Nothing I would‚Äôve expected from beyonce, especially at this point in her career. Definitely the least of the Jay-z collabs

---

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i was surprised jay didn't have a verse, but i actually liked how they did it. his adlibs and brief moments really added to the song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): we love Jay-Z!

**lilguavachan** (10): this song gets passed over by the other jay-z featured songs like deja vu and upgrade u (for good reason, those songs go the hell off), but this is still a bop in its own right!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): this is her best collab with her husband after Drunk In Love and Deja Vu tbh

**bespectacIed** (9): This is a pretty forgettable song in Bey's discog but the production of this song is incredible

**rickikardashian** (9): I know this song was made to have an old school Hollywood video with Beyonce dressed in red and perfectly curled hair, and Jay z just wearing a tuxedo and maybe a fedora to make him look classy

**rsmitty99** (9): The ending is a little tactless listing all those dead musicians. But that part goes off. If this had a music video, I can see it now. Beyonce in a dressing room looking the mirror two gay black men dramatically doing her hair while also having fans. I don't know why that's what I think about. But I do. Every time.

**starlightzone** (8.5): I feel like there might be some eyebrows raised over this beating out Beautiful Liar and the reason is simple I just thing Bey and Jay-Z really flow well together on songs. Beyonce's high energy raises Jay's energy up, while Jay is there to keep Beyonce moving through the song. I think their collabs are some of the strongest, period.

**1998tweety** (8): This was good but I wanted a bit more from Jay

**evilqueenlex** (7.5): just ignore Jay Z

**J\_Toe** (7): never heard this before? lol

**timothy444** (7): Passable

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.1): The outro where she namechecks a bunch of celebs who OD'd was wild.

**jexan13** (6): boi bye

**oscarbrierley1** (6): should have left it on the jay z album

**slimboyfriend** (6): She's not saying anything new, but it's Beyonc√© so it's still good enough

**ditacarlita** (5): the album could do without this song, surely the worst bey-jay collab

**MrSwearword** (5): mediocre as hell even with cute production

**waluigiest** (5): it‚Äôs glitzy but why

**Qwilphish** (4): this is 3 songs standing on top of each other‚Äôs shoulders

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): I guess I just don‚Äôt get the point.

**maybe9** (2): i cant stand this song

**fadedblue09** (1): This was Jay-Z's song? A bit unnecessary tbh.

**JunkyGS** (0): I literally forgot this song existed.... and  I wish I could forget it existed again

Mariah and Jermaine are an iconic duo dating back to the 90s as songwriting partners, but not everything they do turns out to be a hit. Many of you thought this was filler and tbh i cant disagree. That IHOP line though‚Ä¶ iconic.

**anothertown** (9): This should have made the standard edition wtf. ‚ÄúI got stacks like the international house of pancakes,‚Äù iconic opening line to a verse.

**starlightzone** (9): This does better than Get Your Number because I feel like Mariah is hitting hard here and is just a lot stronger.

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): ok this was a total bop but did jermaine really say "i got stacks like the international house of pancakes" im-

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): stacks like the international house of pancakes

**wavingwolves** (7): "something in you gets me so tingly inside" is so cute!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.6): It‚Äôs ‚ÄúDid I Do That?‚Äù but kind of worse.

**1998tweety** (6.5): Girl stop with these features PLEASE

**MrSwearword** (5): a bit flat and unoriginal

**oscarbrierley1** (5): filler af

**timothy444** (5): Generic 2000s tune. Literally anyone could have sung this and it would've still been the same song!

**frankiefrankiefrank** (4.6): This sounds like a bonus track, especially the schoolyard-chant prechorus. Also LEAVE KEYBOARD STRINGS OFF YOUR SONGS.

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): "I got snacks like the international house of pancakes"

**1998tweety** (6.5): It's alright, chorus got a little annoying.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.5): invented the internet

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): fun fact the internet only decided to precede every website with www after hearing Beyonc√© sing the letter W three times in this song

**J\_Toe** (6): I have a theory that Diva, Run the World and Flawless were all trying to do the same thing, and that she only got it right the last time. Maybe I should add this song to the theory too?

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5.7): Filler but she sounds great.

**JunkyGS** (5): even more generic

**rsmitty99** (4): Ugh. Just. This analogy. Yikes

**slimboyfriend** (4): Not exactly Email My Heart, BUT.....

**jexan13** (3.5): why is the melody on this so unispired and forgettable?

**maybe9** (3): this is an album filler song, beyonce not understanding the internet is so iconic though

**timothy444** (3): The lyrics really suck and her ghostwriting team should feel guilty for making this song a reality!

Some of you just didnt have the mental acuity to grasp the iconicness of this song, and thats okay! We all cant sound like Kim, and tbh Beyonce and Mariah were looking at this for vocal lessons back in the day

---

**evilqueenlex** (10): this was originally a country song

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.5): Kim was giving the gays everything they want long before Erica.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): this could actually be trash but i remember it being iconic

**DaHumanTorch** (6): this is so bad but i kinda loved it?

If ~~ Beyonce could write at all~~ Beyonce could just write more than one decent ballad, maybe she wouldnt be here! If popheads' brains werent burnt out on poppers, maybe we would appreciate a ballad! If, if only IF

---

**lilguavachan** (10): the better ballad off of b'day tbh

**starlightzone** (10): I think this is stronger because it's after Get Me Bodied and it's just a lot slower and more powerful. It's got this powerful feel and just feels like it's swallowing me whole in how beautiful it ends up being.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Not as strong as Flaws and All, but still an excellent ballad that will be likely overlooked.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): beautiful

**MrSwearword** (8): nice and dramatic if a bit too by the numbers for the time.

**timothy444** (8): Great song, I guess?

**1998tweety** (7): This was..ok. It popped off at the end but the first half was a snooze.

**waluigiest** (7): a lot of the accompaniment sounds like piano and strings just warming up lol

**bespectacIed** (6): great vocals, beautiful vocals

**ImADudeDuh** (6): janet shaking a bit but neither are that good

**rsmitty99** (6): Beyonce ballads are always either hit, miss, or most of I am‚Ä¶SashaFierce. And this is a miss for me.

**ditacarlita** (5.5): sounds like a crappy version of a rihanna ballad

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Beyonc√© Make A Good Downtempo Song In 2006 Challenge

**evilqueenlex** (5): R&Beyonce is just not as good as Pop Beyonce or Rap Beyonce

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I get the idea of asking your man to treat you better the verbiage here is uncomfy. ‚ÄúIf you let him take me from you‚Äù girl don‚Äôt defer the blame onto this dude, just own up to your role in this. Musically it‚Äôs a bit boring, it feels like Asian Mall Music at times.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (4.9): Discount version of Unfaithful (one of the lyrics is even "a girl like me" which was the name of the Rihanna album Unfaithful is from!).

**jexan13** (4.5): "if you let him take me from you", a shitty message in many forms. And, if you gonna be toxic, at least give it a melody and production worthy of the standard edition.

Back in 20006 it was slightly believable still that maybe, MAYBE Beyonce had flaws. Still, that wasnt enough to convince most of us that its a believable topic for a song. Her greatest flaw? Making popheads listen to a ballad apparently

---

**TiltControls** (11): criminally underrated track. I wouldn't say it's necessarily the most memorable on the album but it's definitely my favourite.

**fadedblue09** (10): I feel like this is gonna get robbed due to this sub's balladphobia, but the production here is very sensual and atmospheric and her vocals are very haunting here for some reason. At least Kelly Rowland has some taste.

**lilguavachan** (10): where does one find someone willing to accept a shambling mess of flaws masquerading as a person, beyonce? asking for a friend.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): one of her best ballads tbh

**DaHumanTorch** (9): "i'm a trainwreck in the morning, a bitch in the afternoon" we love a good instagram caption. fr though, these lyrics were amazing, they really hit me and made me realize im never gonna have this whoops

**starlightzone** (8): Originally when I heard this song order, I was like 'I don't think Flaws and All works well after Upgrade U with the heavy slowdown' and then I realized I was wrong, because after these high paced songs, a song where Beyonce just gets to show off her amazing voice by herself and shows how much she loves her man is just top tier.

**timothy444** (8): A majestic slow-jam

**1998tweety** (7.5): Lyrics are cute, otherwise it's a bit of a snooze.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): *insert witty, original joke about Flawless here*

**bespectacIed** (7): I'm a delusional stan but yeah this is lowkey a bore

**MrSwearword** (7): it's not the live version because this is kind of lukewarm at best

**rsmitty99** (7): I hope the irony of Beyonce telling Jay she's thankful he loves her despite her flaws isn't lost on any of us.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): It‚Äôs fine as a song but like‚Ä¶ humble sounds weird on Beyonc√©. It stands out on the album because basically every other song on the album is Beyonc√© talking about how she‚Äôs #thatbitch and men are like bugs beneath her heel but suddenly she‚Äôs this broken bird in the hands of a caring gentleman? I‚Äôm not buying it. It does sound pretty though.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I like the harp production but this song is just too cheesy for me

**JunkyGS** (6.5): generic

**starla\_** (6.5): this song could be great but the lyrics are so terrible

**waluigiest** (6): love the sentiment but the writing is clumsy

**yourfacesucksass** (6): Kind of dull and forgettable

**ditacarlita** (5.5): i do not need beyonce ballads in my life

**jexan13** (5.5): Pretty Hurts uglier aunt

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5.2): Not bad, but nothing special.

**slimboyfriend** (5): Ooof she really needed to workshop her ballads back then

Mariah is doing the thing, Nelly is... there. Really marginal contribution from him, and I (and many of y'all) have NO IDEA why this was a single. As hot as Nelly was around the time, they surely would have known this would go nowhere right?

---

**lilguavachan** (10): the amount of emotional whiplash going from i wish you knew to this... far too much. it still goes off though

**DaHumanTorch** (9): i don't like nelly very much but i actually really enjoyed his inclusion on this track. he was actually a part of the song and part of why the song worked instead of just being tacked on in the latter half of the song like snoop and twista were. pharrell's production was also a highlight.

**starlightzone** (9): I really like the parts of this song that don't have Nelly. I actually really like Nelly and he hits some good notes when he's singing with Mariah, but when he's rapping off on his own, I just question why we couldn't get Twista back.

**ditacarlita** (8): this is quite a groove and i love nelly

**1998tweety** (7.5): Get's a little repetitive at points but at least Nelly ate it up.

**anothertown** (7): this nonexistent feature LOL

**skargardin** (7): The guest verses on this album really go off

**waluigiest** (7): Hot in Herre Part 2

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.6): The Neptunes worked on all three albums in this rate, and it's clear that 00's Pharrell really loved syncopation and a guitar or synth at the end of every measure.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): I mean its enjoyable but its also Neptunes by numbers

**bespectacIed** (6): Again, another trendchasing song. I feel like this is an unfair critique because I actually love trendchasing songs (they become music time capsules for the future generations) but I guess I expect innovation from Mariah. This sounds like every other female RnB hiphop song on the radio at 2005

**jexan13** (6): the chorus is nice. The rest? I forgot

**rsmitty99** (6): Meh.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (6): It's alright but a bit forgettable compared to everything else

**wavingwolves** (6): not the the biggest fun of nelly in this

**MrSwearword** (5): I'm mad; you can't have Nelly be on GET YOUR NUMBER, but this average for Neptunes beat and medicore ass song has him? GURL BYE.

**Qwilphish** (5): boo

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): If I had to cut any song from the album it would be this one.

**maybe9** (4): its boring

**timothy444** (4): Please never collaborate with Nelly again

Beyonce's latina-era was a confusing moment. A bit too late for the latin pop explosion of the early 2000s, and too early for reggaeton to really blast off, i'm not really sure why she decided to collab with two latin megastars for the deluxe edition but this one certainly did not work for me. However her annunciation is amazing

---

**lilguavachan** (10): i can't believe she invented the spanish language, taught alejandro how to speak it, and then released this song! her power is overwhelming!

**starlightzone** (9.8): I love when she sings in Spanish and I think Alejandro compliments her voice perfectly. I think any Beyonce collabs just bring up the strength of the male artist and make them shine so much better.

**rsmitty99** (9.5): I bet this is like vanilla spanish music, but man do I love it.

**timothy444** (9): I normally don't like reggaeton but this is smooth. Both of their voices sound amazing together and it feels sexy and romantic as well! Kudos to the both of them!

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): oooo the flavor. we love versatility

**ignitethephoenix** (8): We love the 2nd highest selling single on Spain of all time (only behind despacito)

**MrSwearword** (8): specificamente porque el espanol de Beyonce es mas rica que me recuerdo. Alejandro es un elemento mejor tambien.

**1998tweety** (7.5): Did anyone ask for this? Well I'm glad we got it anyway cause Miss Knowles eats this up.

**rickikardashian** (7.5): why during this era Bey's team was obsessed with making her sing in Spanish? because as far as I know, she never really tried that later on, but this era she was determined to have a mark on the Latin American public ig

**maybe9** (7): spanish banger alert

**wavingwolves** (7): alejandro fern√°ndez our latin king. stream me dediqu√© a perderte, y'all

**yourfacesucksass** (6.9): Not sure if this really fits?

**Qwilphish** (6.5): not my cup of tea but still an impressive duet

**bespectacIed** (6): Bey's Latina phase is a weird moment in time, a moment I like to forget

**ditacarlita** (6): well this is random, it's okay but doesn't really suit the album

**evilqueenlex** (6): her spanish is pretty good but this just doesn't do it for me.

**waluigiest** (6): ‚Äúsoy tu gitana‚Äù hmm

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5.5): Not a bad song, but this just feels like a random attempt at a crossover hit. Doesn't fit her vibe at all.

**gannade** (5.5): why is beyonce pretending she is spanish

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Artists need to learn that just singing in a different language doesn‚Äôt make it okay to release boring songs.

Just like Making It Last all Night, y'all were really not here for another Mariah and Jermaine hook up. Jermain's hook is extremely grating. Has a cool funky beat but thats all its got going for it, not a great performance from Mariah either. Weak for a single

---

**MrSwearword** (10): even if Jermaine Dupri is on here instead of Nelly [seriously, imagine him on this track, it could've been in the top fifteen minimum] but this is such a banger and MARIAH. IN. THE YELLOW. DRESS. And the fact Mariah's raps are lowkey underrated FIRE.

**skargardin** (10): Sure this isn't anything revolutionary per se but goddamn do they sell it so well

**DaHumanTorch** (9.5): I wasn't expecting the featured artist to be on the chorus and it worked really well. i also loved jermaine's production. the prechorus was the highlight for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.7): Jermaine‚Äôs hook is kind of dumb but it works because this song is so campy and because Mariah is *flexing*. Like, I don‚Äôt normally care for songs that are bragging about songs but when she whispers that fast section about her expensive stuff I‚Äôll be damned if she doesn‚Äôt sound like baddest bitch in the world.

**starlightzone** (8.7): I feel like unlike Say Somethin', this song doesn't really show the best of either artist. However, it's still incredibly good and I just love when Mariah harmonizes.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (8): It's fun but doesn't have as many lyrical zingers and It's Like That or Shake It Off

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.5): This such a breezy, fun song.

**bespectacIed** (7): Yeah it's a product of its time alright. It's fun, I liked the beat

**evilqueenlex** (7): the music video is such a SERVE though

**oscarbrierley1** (7): should have had actual nelly rather than jd's impression

**rsmitty99** (7): Honestly, I can't stand Jermaine Dupri and a vocalist/rapper. A writer? Absolutely. This should've been Usher.

**slimboyfriend** (7): Who is this bargain brand Nelly whining in the bathroom

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): why do they keep putting jermaine on these tracks stop

**1998tweety** (6): Mariah stop with these wack features, they aren't helping your album.

**wavingwolves** (6): fun but a bit bland

**timothy444** (5): There's not much of Mariah's vocal talent showcased here and Jermaine feels like he overstayed his welcome. The lyrics don't really help either. This song feels rather dirty tbh.

**Qwilphish** (4): no you can‚Äôt, the dude lowers the score

**yourfacesucksass** (4): I cannot fathom this song. I just hate Jermaine's vocals. It's so off-putting here lol

**jexan13** (3.5): your number is a 3.5. Seriously, do I have to hear this song 911 times for me to finally remember at least a single melody line??

**maybe9** (3): yeah, this aint it chief

**fadedblue09** (0): I love you Mariah, but this was a trainwreck, almost on *Did I Do That?* levels of bad. As with the opening track, Jermaine Dupri should NOT be allowed to feature as guest vocals.

Mariah pulls off her signature remix with a  posse of rappers but you all hated it for some reason?! Yes it greatly changes her iconic hit single but in doing so she basically makes a new song and its a bop!

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I kind of like this better than the original version? I love the different lyrics.

**lilguavachan** (10): the power this remix has... immense.

**yourfacesucksass** (9.4): I actually like this more than the original

**starlightzone** (9): really didnt need the rappers in it tbh thats just my personal thoughts.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): So underrated

**bespectacIed** (8): An unnecessary serve. Queen of remixes

**rickikardashian** (8): the og is better of courses but honestly I appreciate how different this remix actually is

**rsmitty99** (8): Pales in comparison to the original. Unnecessary.

**timothy444** (8): I prefer the original

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.8): Pretty good as far as remixes go, but why mess with perfection?

**megm26** (7.8): I don't really like the features :/

**anothertown** (7.5): ‚ÄúShow your respect whenever you hear me and see me / This is the Emancipation of Mimi‚Äù

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): I like the original better but i love how mariah actually knows what remix means.  a cute bop that is something fun something for the summertime something for the girls to get ready and party to, but not my favorite on the album

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Not essential, but it's better than some of the standard edition songs.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Do I like this song... more than the original?

**1998tweety** (7): I'm dragging this purely cause it is so not needed, only took away from the song. At least it's pretty much a new song.

**rosecult** (7): doesn't compare to the original but cute i guess

**skargardin** (7): It's quite good but it obviously can't match the original

**waluigiest** (7): far inferior to the original, but is an interesting take

**worlds-okayest666** (7): This feels like an...odd choice of song to do a fun hip-hop remix of

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): honestly way better than i expected, but Mariah invented putting rappers on remixes so I should‚Äôve known she‚Äôd make this decent

**evilqueenlex** (6.5): slightly unnecessary

**ignitethephoenix** (6): not really a fan of this remix

**gannade** (5): hmm

**maybe9** (5): im not into this remix

**agentofscranton** (3): how to ruin a great song 101

**wavingwolves** (3): no, thanks

**Qwilphish** (2): imagine throwing terrible features on such an iconic song. Irredeemable

**ImADudeDuh** (1): I think everyone ended ha

**MrSwearword** (1): how dare you

**jexan13** (0): you literally remove the last chorus of the song, the best part, to shoehorn literally whos with forgettable verses. Like, someone said "you know one of the few good songs in that album? Yeah, let's make it boring and unispiring"

But money CAN buy you this 14 week #1 hit single right?? Countess THEE Luanne is looking for a GENTLEMAN and its not like any of you gutter ho's know anything about that right?? Anyway-

---

**agentofscranton** (10): this is absolutely amazing. the lyrical content. the delivery. the true peak of music.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): My sister used to watch some of the Real Housewife shows so I actually saw the episode where Countess Luann recorded ‚ÄúChic C‚Äôest La Vie‚Äù and I‚Äôm upset by the erasure of that. Anyways, I‚Äôm giving this a 10 not because it‚Äôs the only song in the bonus rate that‚Äôs ACTUALLY enjoyably bad. The rest are either good, bad, or boring, this is the only one that manages to be enjoying in its badness. I think it‚Äôs because Countess Luann actually injects some personality into the song, she‚Äôs two dimensional rather than one dimensional. Like, a lot of the other songs could have been anyone but this? This is pure Luann lunacy.

**saucymac** (10): chic cest la vie should have been here tho

**bbfan132** (9): these lyrics are beyond beautiful‚Ä¶ she should become a motivational speaker or something

**wavingwolves** (9): don't forget to stream "opulence" by contrapoints

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.4): But money can buy you a better vocal producer.

**waluigiest** (8): I‚Äôm rating this highly because it‚Äôs a gorgeous, glitzy, sassy piece of art. All it needs is a real singer to record the chorus

**DaHumanTorch** (5): ok this was also trash but i also loved it at the same time...what are the real housewives doing to me

**ditacarlita** (3): fucking SHIT

**J\_Toe** (3): oof

**rickikardashian** (3): is this Cher's believe?

**bespectacIed** (2): If a k-pop girlie released this bubblegum house track y'all (and by y'all, I mean me) would absolutely eat this up

**fadedblue09** (1.5): Okay wtf

**MrSwearword** (1): it can't buy you a good song either

**rsmitty99** (1): What. The. Actual. Auto-Tune. Fuck.

**skargardin** (1): Goodbye

This is suuuuper 80s well before the 80s synth revival happened- kinda dangerous to do thatw hile also naming your song as the iconic Kenny Loggins 80s hit. A cute bop but not much more to it for most of you, and I had to agree.

---

**J\_Toe** (10): Crash and serious are fun, but I'm not gonna buy anyone who says they could have been radio singles. They were just too throwback-y. Danger Zone, on the other hand, is the single that got away. It is perfect. It sounds a little like 4 In the Morning. It has the Melodramatic perfection of Cool, but with a rocker-chick edge. And it sadly foreshadows her marriage :(

**DaHumanTorch** (9): The chorus is soooo catchy and I love the production

**Qwilphish** (9): I‚Äôm sounding like a broken record but the production is so fun on this song. And omega catchy

**rsmitty99** (9): Catchy as fuck

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.9): the real danger zone is her accent on Harajuku Girls but anyway this slaps

**1998tweety** (8.5): Another slapper, not as memorable as the previous songs but it's still quite good and doesn't stand out in a bad way.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): HIGHWAY TO THE...oh wait wrong song

**ditacarlita** (7.5): made the first step of my peanut caramel slice baking quite enjoyable

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Kenny Rogers is shaking a biT

**jexan13** (7): another irritating chorus, but the production and verses redempt it

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.5): I like the overall vibe but it's not amazing or anything. Sounds like a background song in a 00's teen movie.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I like the chorus of this one but on the whole it‚Äôs a little forgettable.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): Top Gun is unbothered but this is fun

**fadedblue09** (6): I thought I would like this more for being one of the more rock-ish tracks given that Gwen has roots in the genre, but I find this a little underwhelming.

**maybe9** (6): a bit repetitive, but its good at least

**MrSwearword** (6): it just sounds like a Rocksteady b-side that was a region exclusive vinyl release

**waluigiest** (5): she‚Äôs a top!! wish she brought that energy tho

**starlightzone** (4): this is the worst song on this album i don't even know what to say about it its just bad i need an adult.

**wavingwolves** (4): this sounds like a filler from a disney pop girl album

**bespectacIed** (3): boring song, interesting production

Better than part 1, more twista goes a long way and this hook is way catchier. This is a massive bop and i dont know why you all hated it so much!

---

**lilguavachan** (10): an iconic part 2 to a great song

**rsmitty99** (10): I was shocked when I found out this song wasn't much of a hit. I heard it on the radio ALL the time. Really like this song.

**starlightzone** (10): the one sequel that's just as good as the first one. Twista I think is the best rapper to mix with Mariah but I also just really like Twista I find.

**DaHumanTorch** (9.5): i liked this a lot better than the original, i actually loved this, including the feature who i hated on pt 1. also why does twista sound exactly like the main character in that one disney channel movie Let It Shine

**yourfacesucksass** (9.5): I can jam to this, wish the album were more like this sound

**bespectacIed** (9): better than one & only

**skargardin** (9): Twista ATE this

**1998tweety** (8.5): Twista serves again, this one is actually quite good, another great chorus.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.5): This is so much better than Part I.

**ditacarlita** (7.5): very enjoyable

**gannade** (7): this was better than part 1

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): It‚Äôs not as good as ‚ÄúPart I‚Äù but it‚Äôs still decent.

**Qwilphish** (7): an improvement from the first in all aspects

**timothy444** (7): so lonely is ok but i don't think im gona listen to it again lol xd

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): the strings pop off but eh

**fadedblue09** (6): As a fan of One & Only, this was disappointing. Love the darker vibe, but Mariah's talents doesn't shine here as it does on the original.

**rickikardashian** (6): it's nice but it's honestly barely a Mariah song

**wavingwolves** (6): the intro...

**maybe9** (5): these features are a choice

**oscarbrierley1** (5): filler af

**MrSwearword** (3): unnecessary sequel

After a few bombastic, megapop single here's where the album changes course into quite a lot of throwback vibes. Here Gwen is giving me BIG salt n pepa vibes and im here for it.

---

**DaHumanTorch** (10): This and Hollaback Girl are tied for my favs on this album.

**1998tweety** (9): This is alright, there are some elements I really like (the chorus), but there are other elements (pretty much everything else) that I'm just kind of ok on. But whew does that chorus go off.

**ditacarlita** (9): the final jewel on the crown of LAMB singles

**skargardin** (9): BOP

**waluigiest** (9): UGH 90s nostalgic realness

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): she said "yes i fuck"

**wavingwolves** (8): I love this song because it sounds like brazilian funk music but a little more poppish and polished

**evilqueenlex** (7.5): this is her jj fad/l'trimm moment

**J\_Toe** (7): I personally prefer when she lifts just an element of 80s music, rather than making a song that sounds like it popped out of an 80s time capsule. I mean, it's mainly that *dun. dun-dun* sound effect. You know the one.

**Qwilphish** (7): aggressive n i g h t c o r e

**rsmitty99** (7): Very much an 80s throwback. And it's alright I guess. Fun and cute

**sailormunelune** (7): < Shut Up and Drive

**yourfacesucksass** (6.9): I can appreciate the "car door is open" noise as a beat, but the song is way too chanty-talky to exist apart from Hollaback.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): This is probably the first track on the album that doesn‚Äôt do much for me, it‚Äôs not awful but she‚Äôs been delivering at such a high level that this comes as something of a disappointment.

**bespectacIed** (6): Cute pop song, if it was sung by Sarah Bonito instead, r/indieheads would eat this up

**slimboyfriend** (6): ugh more driving as sex metaphors?

**jackisboredtoday** (5.2): Shut Up and Drive outsold

**fadedblue09** (5): Feels a little longer than it's supposed to be

**starlightzone** (5): This is also very much 40 year old woman who is very excited to try out her new convertible. When I was younger, I really loved this song but as I grow older, it grows older than me. It's absolutely just about sex. And It's not that great.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (4.3): Great production, but the songwriting (melody and lyrics) is really lacking. Not even Gwen's charisma can save this.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): Fuck Crash, Ape Escape is the much better Playstation franchise

**maybe9** (3): i am bored

**MrSwearword** (3): holy fuck this is bad.

Getting to the point where vocals can only take us so far, I got very bored with this one and I'm pleased that pretty much everyone agreed with me

---

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i read online that this was made only a few weeks before the album release as another song had to be scrapped for legal reasons. i can't even tell this was thrown together, its one of my favs on the album even. mimi snapped

**JunkyGS** (10): Absolutely hypnotizing

**skargardin** (10): An ascending tonight

**starlightzone** (9.2): I can't explain why this song doesn't get as hard as circles for me but I still enjoy it. Just listening to it it almost feels like it doesn't fit with the album?

**fadedblue09** (9): One of my favorite deepcuts on this album.

**rsmitty99** (9): This song is very much a throwback to older ballad days. And it works for me.

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): for a late addition it fits in well

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I never paid this song much attention until the rate but listening to it closely it sounds really angelic, it‚Äôs kinda beautiful?

**1998tweety** (7): Zara Larsson and Tinashe both outsold.

**MrSwearword** (7): cute as a lot of the slower joints but this reads more like prom song and it's slightly underwhelming.

**Qwilphish** (7): better than average Mariah ballad

**timothy444** (7): It's ok? I appreciate Mariah's vocals and she does display her range a little here. There's nothing special that makes this song a must-listen but it's not bad. Just ok.

**bespectacIed** (6): sounds like a 90s mariah album reject. Her most overrated song, but it's a cute girl

**jexan13** (6): the title describes what this album is not

**maybe9** (6): her vocals carry this boring song

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5.8): Cheesy AC ballad that Mariah should've left in the 90's.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.7): tinasha reference

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Zara Larsson ended ha

This could've been on an early Madonna or Cyndi Lauper record, or on Emotion-B side, It really hits that Carly/Robyn sad-banger energy so im shocked its this low!

---

**jexan13** (10): she really knows how to sing sad melodies

**1998tweety** (9): It is not fair just how good this album is. A GOOD ballad.

**starlightzone** (9): When we talk about good Gwen Stefani songs like cool, we forget that there was another song on this album that was also good but got forgotten because it wasn't a single. The Real Thing is just this chill love song with a sped up beat. And I think it deserves some fucking goddamn respect.

**fadedblue09** (8.9): Low-key wished the opening beat set the tone for the rest of the song, but the song itself wasn't too bad. One of the more pure throwback songs on the record.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): kinda filler-y but still distinctive enough since it's one of the slower moments on the album

**ditacarlita** (8): the singles make everything else pale in comparison but this is still beautiful

**oscarbrierley1** (8): (but a 10 for the slow jam remix)

**skargardin** (8): Cute!

**slimboyfriend** (8): ok wow this song is very early 80s goth synth pop like New Order and Depeche Mode with some Pet Shop Boys. It's really feeding my inner homosexual goth dad self

**starla\_** (8): this sounds like a Robyn song

**bespectacIed** (7): Feels like a carly club banger (yes, everything's about carly)

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): Eh. I liked the prechorus and the lyrics but something about the rest of the song didn't click with me like most of the album has so far. I wouldn't skip it or anything when relistening to the album though.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): mmmm, smacks of filler but I‚Äôll allow it. The ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go away‚Äù part is like, almost the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give it up‚Äù part from CRJ‚Äôs ‚ÄúNow That I Found You.‚Äù

**ImADudeDuh** (6): oh this is def filler

**Qwilphish** (6): I really like the production but her voice lets the song down

**waluigiest** (6): missing a certain spark the rest of the album has

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5.8): It has it's moments (I really like the prechorus and the background vocals), but overall forgettable.

**J\_Toe** (5): I've got a question: is one ballad per pop album some sort of requirement? I don't think this song was needed.

**MrSwearword** (5): more boring than terrible

**rsmitty99** (5): Honestly I'm still getting some Carly Rae vibes, but every time, I just think they would fit Carly better. I'm aware she wasn't around and maybe it's unfair I'm comparing them. But I just don't Gwen's voice fits the genre.

The more i listen to this song the more im convinced this was made by MK ultra to control a certain gay portion of the population. Just listen to how she says *bills, BiLlS*. ICONIQUE

---

**bbfan132** (10): kim k really outperformed every pop girl that has existed with this electropop bop‚Ä¶ we have no choice but to stan

**bespectacIed** (10): SONG OF THE MILLENNIUM. Kanye should've been banned to make any music after this was released, knowing his wife had devoured him with this J√ÜM. Turn it up, DJ.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): kim needs to make music again because this unironically is such a bop

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This song is iconic and I won't accept another opinion.

**oscarbrierley1** (10): if you don't bump to this you have no taste

**rickikardashian** (10): where were you when Kim kardashian invented music?

**saucymac** (10): whatever bitches kim rules and is an iconic tone deaf queen

**CandlePrince** (7): Even though this song is weaker than the other songs, it's still a Jam.mp3

**waluigiest** (7): the Jam bridge > Golden Gate Bridge

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Honestly I feel like if this was handed to someone who could actually sing like Kesha then it would be a decent song.

**skargardin** (5): *some* points were made

**yourfacesucksass** (4): The fact that The Dream and Tricky Stewart teamed up and made this mess, is pretty sad. Not only are the vocals bad but the lyrics are bad too.

**evilqueenlex** (3): i love being reminded of this

**rsmitty99** (3): lol

**gannade** (2): FLOP!

**ditacarlita** (1): this shouldn't exist

This is almost TOO cute. Not sure how well the 50s aesthetic works and really it veers into corny territory a little too much, but I do bop around to this every time I hear it. I a disappointing placement, out on day 1, for sure

---

**1998tweety** (10): I already know this is gonna be the most robbed song here. I don't know why exactly I love this so much but I just do. It's just so weird and fun.

**anothertown** (10): This song is immaculate‚Ä¶ The production, the instrumentation, the backing vocals, the skit, the double bridge! Also Andre 3000 being credited twice under 2 different names on this album is iconic.

**fadedblue09** (10): There's something about her voice that makes the chorus weirdly catchy.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Oh my GOD this is a bop? This album had so many strong singles I was curious about how the B-sides would sound but the first one up is such a serve. This song is so ahead of its time we still haven‚Äôt caught up with it, I can‚Äôt think of any other songs that sound like this and if you know them please leave them in the comments below. I love the combination of the innocent ‚Äò50s girl thing with the heavy undertones of sexuality, emphasized by the frenetic beats.

**lilguavachan** (10): this song is so damn cheesy... and i live for it.

**skargardin** (10): she bops

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): run it like a track meet

**starlightzone** (9): This was one of the songs when I was younger that I thought was just so fun and cool and this was before I knew what sex was. It reminds me a lot of Strawberry Bubblegum by Justin Timberlake, except just better and more energetic. I really adore this song.

**waluigiest** (9): wet wet wet wet this is just wonderful pop

**J\_Toe** (8): this should have been placed after Hollaback Girl in the playlist, rather than Cool. That was one jarring transition.

**Qwilphish** (8): an acid trip, in a really good way

**agentofscranton** (7.5): hyuna made the superior song about bubble pop

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): None of these elements go together, but somehow I still like the song

**bespectacIed** (7): Hyuna outsold

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.5): The score would be way higher if that drum loop wasn't so incessant and annoying.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): The song is just too chaotic for my ears

**jexan13** (6.5): the chorus is slightly annoying

**DaHumanTorch** (6): I liked the bubbles popping within the production...otherwise I thought this was average. I enjoyed it but nowhere near my favorite. Also the talking was cute for the intro but I didn't like how they put it in the middle of the song though I'm sure some people liked that part of it.

**ditacarlita** (6): I'm just not into these busy sounding songs

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Aqua snapped on this track

**yourfacesucksass** (6): I don't see this as anything but filler

**starla\_** (5.5): the chaotic energy makes me uncomfortable

**MrSwearword** (5): the song title and chorus are garbage but the song itself is weird, energetic and cutesy

**maybe9** (4): that car is so distracting and bad from an otherwise good song

**wavingwolves** (2): [taylor swift's voice] you need to CALM DOWN!!!! you're being TOO LOUD!!!!

**rsmitty99** (0): nope

J_Toe: I think being placed after Cool in the track list probably gave people mood whiplash. If this was after Hollaback Girl instead I think it would be well received.

Maybe I'm too tired, too, but isn't it kind of a precurser to the kind of sounds Charli XCX is playing with these days? Or maybe in 2017.

But I'm glad singles bias didn't apply to Get Your Number and I feel vindicated that it's out (seriously, what was Mariah thinking?). So far, the most of my scores below 5 are out so I guess I'm fine.
