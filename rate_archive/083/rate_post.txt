Mid 2000s Pop Excellence
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/e52vt7/mid_2000s_pop_excellence/

**THE YEAR IS 2005**

George Bush was just re-elected and does not care about black people. Youtube was just invented, freeing us from the shackles of MTV and cable television. Half of this sub was in diapers while I was watching a pirated copy of Brokeback Mountain in the middle of the night on the lowest volume behind locked doors. And you were a basic bitch if you didnt have a pink juicy tracksuit with matching Motorola RAZR.

 Pop music is in a grim state of turnover- 2004 was completely dominated by R&B crossover artists. Britney, Christina, NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys are on extended or permanent hiatus. The industry was having trouble launching the next wave of pop girls, so who was to be the saving acts but 3 90s queens each ready for a comeback (shoutouts to Madonna and Nelly Furtado who also did this but we’ve rated them before).

Scores due Jan 12th at 11:59 PST, an extension of a day or two may be granted if you ask for one. PM me with any questions and concerns over your scores, including corrections

##[Gwen Stefani- Love.Angel.Music.Baby](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-12-at-11.34.png)

First off is the most pop album of the rate coming surprisingly from the leader of a 90s ska/rock band. Gwen had a very successful career already as the frontwoman of No Doubt, while on a break from touring she began working with people outside her band for the first time, like Pharell, Linda Perry, and Dr. Dre. The album launched with moderate success of her first couple singles, which turned into massive success when Hollaback Girl hit #1 on the Hot 100 in 2005, becoming the #2 song on the year end list, and taught everyone in America how to spell bananas. I personally have really fond memories of this album and its iconic singles which have only gotten better over time somehow. Did I mention this produced 6(!) hit singles that Gwen was promoting well into 2006, harajuku girls in tow. On that note, not everything about this album has aged well, mostly Gwen’s consistent use of multiple cultures to play dress up and the troup of 4 mute Japanese women that followed her everywhere she went. Did it make for great, varied visuals and music? Yeah tbh. Could she get away with it nowadays? Probably not. Lets just say cancel culture wasn’t really in anyone’s mind in the Iraq war era.

##[Mariah Carey- The Emancipation of Mimi](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71meogmqM2L._SL1400_.jpg)

The early 2000s were a rough couple of years for Mariah. From completely owning the 90’s with a hit record year after year, the cracks sharted to show after 2 flop eras in a row (and calling Glitter a flop is being kind). So what do you do when the fickle industry has decided they’ve had enough of you? Go on the greatest comeback of all time, of course. It’s no exaggeration to say this is one of the biggest albums of all time: it’s the highest selling album of 2005 and Mariah’s personal best since 95, We Belong Together was the song of both 2005 and the decade with 14 weeks at #1 (iconically blocking herself from another #1 in the process), and it nabbed another #1 with the rereleased Platinum Edition. Even if you’re not a Lamb you likely have heard all of the singles from this behemoth of an album. Musically, it’s Mariah doing what she does best: immaculately sung smooth R&B tracks with huge hop hop and pop appeal. LAMBily assemble and support your queen during her strongest month.

##[Beyonce- B’ Day](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51zJpDmMeqL._SX355_.jpg)

B’Day is Beyonce’s second solo album and criminally underrated nowadays in my opinion! It’s hard to say this really was a comeback as she had just rocked the world with her debut a few years ago, but she did go back to Destiny’s Child in between. Released in 2006, this is where she really solidified herself as a solo superstar: once again ditching 66% of Destiny’s children but gaining 2 number 1 hits in the process, extending the commercial longevity of the album with a hugely successful rerelease in 07, and really pushing the boundaries when it came to visuals. This is actually her first visual album as every single track in the original release has a music video or some form of visual, something she would later become very well known for. The music is probably one of Beyonce’s popiest records and almost entirely extremely danceable, with some amazing ballads thrown in as well.

Bonus rate:

This part is an additional, completely optional rate just for fun. You can rate some or all of the tracks, no 11 or 0s, and no minimum scores per artist.

You know what else was big in 2005? Reality TV and the paparazzi. So for the bonus rate instead of celebrating excellence, I want to celebrate the trashy side of the mid to late 2000s where a sex tape and reality show could also lead to a viable singing career, regardless of actual singing prowess. Below are some of the most iconic reality star cash in singles that spawned from the first wave of reality tv and mid 00s tabloid culture. Yeah some of these actually came out as late as 2010 but spiritually you cant get more 2007 than these songs. Since this is a bonus rate you dont exactly have to rate these songs based on quality- visuals, camp factor, and overall iconic-ness are all worthy criteria too.

1. [Paris Hilton- Stars Are Blind](https://youtu.be/icpqB22c4G8)
2. [Paris Hilton- Nothing In This World](https://youtu.be/0BiS-AT5v3k)
3. [Brooke Hogan- About Us feat Paul Wall](https://youtu.be/zdysSfFV2jo)
4. [Tyra Banks- Shake Ya Body](https://youtu.be/zMGcLwmQwiA)
5. [Heidi Montag- Body Language](https://youtu.be/CKcXiR8qUkI)
6. [Heidi Montag- Superficial](https://youtu.be/_DJxsQFQoDQ)
7. [Kim Zolciak- Tardy For The Party](https://youtu.be/wQo8vZixklg)
8. [Countess Luann- Money Can't Buy You Class](https://youtu.be/kEDvlSAMhQU)
9. [Kim Kardashian- Jam (Turn It Up)](https://youtu.be/gHp7sq1Tzn0)
