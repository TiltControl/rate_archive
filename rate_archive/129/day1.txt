DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: Legit sent me war flashbacks. It was not a good time to rate anything from Taylor when the rates debuted. Hopefully the userbase can be a bit kinder with 1989 this time around.

**letsallpoo** (3): Some things never change. Don't be mistaken by the seeming increase in position; this song came dead last in both rates, and by a considerable margin. In the original rate, I never bothered separated the remix and the original, though, so I'm glad we finally have empirical evidence that this is the worst version available.

I didn't fully "get" this song when we first rated it — songs about friendships are rare, and songs about *ending* friendships especially so, but it's only in the past few years where I've finally borne witness to how explosive and fiery the destruction of a friendship can be. Does this song channel that energy in a good way? Not especially; Taylor's lyricism is kind of poor here, like how she really needs to draw out that syllable in "cuUuUut," and the production is generic synthpop at its most generic. Her releasing a remix to bolster this shoddy song makes sense, but we'll get to that one when it comes...

**ImADudeDuh** (1): Well, I'm glad that this rate made everyone nicer to the songs than last time[...](https://i.imgur.com/tOIilpG.png) This is one of the worst songs melodically in the entire rate, no, it is *the* worst. This is probably one of the worst hooks of a #1 hit of the whole decade (in the company of songs like MAGIC! - Rude, Maroon 5 - Girls Like You, and DJ Khaled - I’m The One). I don’t know a single reason why anyone would listen to this song to enjoy it as intended. Is it to sing along with the lyrics? They’re weirdly paced and make it really hard to actually sing along with. Is it to feel pumped up and angry? I don’t know how you can with a hook that basically gives up on itself at the end of every line. Is it to enjoy the video? Maybe, but it’s uninteresting too! It’s like an SNL cold open sketch on a season premiere: full of cameos that are made to feel cooler than it actually is, but then do nothing interesting other than show that someone is involved in it. The girls just look angry and hold a weapon or wear “futuristic” gear and maybe if you’re lucky, you can walk in front of a green screen by the end of the video. I wish someone kicked Taylor out of a window while she was writing this.

#Positive Comments 

**GARjuna** (10): I fucking love this song

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes, I am unironically giving both "Shake It Off" and this song a 10. This song is very petty and that's a bit childish and embarrassing, but the key is to not take it seriously at all. It's camp, I mean it. Also, I love the guitar in it. I can see why it has haters because of the loud and repetitive shouty chorus, which is rather grating at first, but I like the song anyway. *So if you're coming my way ... just don't.* ;)

**welcometoNY** (10): i've never really understood the hate for this song. sure, it's abrasive, but that's the point, and nothing hits like this when you're in the mood for it. it's so brilliantly scathing but not in a way that sounds petty. favorite lyric: band-aids don't fix bullet holes

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is bad but I can’t pretend I don’t like it. It’s 2021, can we label this as camp?

**IIIHenryIII** (9): This was my favorite song off the album when I listened to it for the first time. I just love songs with drum beats so much, and this song is the perfect example of that. I genuinely don’t get why it gets so much hate even among the fans. The lyrics are spot on considering the topic. Do people have a problem with it just because of the drama? That’s just silly. We all have disagreements with people we are friends with, that’s how friendships get to an end. In no way the lyrics are derogatory or disrespectful to whoever it is addressing. It’s so delusional to call the song and the video anti-feminist. It’s ok to not like the song because it’s not up to your taste, but you don’t need to make up narratives to justify it. Sorry for the rant

**nootnoot781** (9): i promise i’m not a swiftie i just like this album a lot.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): It feels so weird to listen to this without Kendrick's verses.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (7.5): this isn’t even a bad song y’all are just haters for no reason

**cashewconstellation** (7.5): This is actually my first time listening to the solo version and all I have to say is JESUS CHRIST y'all are so dramatic, y'all hate THIS? seriously? okay.

#The rest of the comments

**twistedpython** (8): The beat on this song literally shakes debris loose up in my brain, and I love a good knock-down drag-out pop girl fight, but also "band aid's don't fix bullet holes" is the most egregious use of cliche in Taylor's entire discography.

**jasannn** (7.8): I remember telling my friends that I don't have "bad blood" with my ex-girlfiend anymore in 2015. I thought I was being clever but it's cringe in retrospect.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): i like this song despite the yikes lyrics! sorry!!!

**austrosinitic** (7): Half of me believes that the Taylor/Katy feud was just PR and another half believes it was actually about John Mayer, but whatever the truth is, they’ve made up now, which makes this song the most irrelevant pop single to come out since Pink released So What and then got back together with her husband. I don’t think it’s shit like everybody says and I am a spiteful and vengeful enough person to enjoy it because it makes me think of everybody I have ever quarreled with, but I can’t deny that it’s grating and weird coming out of an adult’s mouth.

**endcreditouilles** (7): remix outsold

**Leixander** (7): yes, this is better than style

**musical\_pyn** (7): my serial killer trait is that I think bad blood is a good song

**Square\_Preparation55** (6.9): the lyrics and production are definitely not groundbreaking, but I actually don't think this song is that bad

**jaztinax** (6.5): the songwriting is worse than i thought it was 6 years ago but i guess that is just character growth :p

**wavingwolves** (6.1): galactika could turn this into a good itzy song

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): idc if it's petty, I like it

**HogwartsReject1912** (6): Fuck y'all I liked this

**just\_thonking** (6): I've really soured on this song

**ManofOranges** (6): This song is the musical embodiment of gaslight gatekeep girlboss.

**modulum83** (6): that scene at the end of 1984 where Winston finally is broken into loving Big Brother except it's me quietly tapping my foot to the chorus of Bad Blood while weeping

**poppinmmolly** (6): Kendrick's remix is far far superior

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): I don't dislike it, I think it's a good pop song, but there is no denying it's the weakest song here along with How You Get The Girl. Both the writing and production needed more meat on the bones. It's one of those songs where Taylor is so concerned with being relatable and all-encompassing that she withhelds all details specific to her case and the result comes across as empty and mean because we have no idea why she's so mad at the other person.

**TheQwertyGuy99** (5.5): This song would be fine if it was written by a teenager.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): , boo fuckin' hoo, Katy Perry's a woke fucking BITCH, we get it OK, please don't make a song like this EVER..

**Bajuko** (5): It's a little overhated on this sub

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): LOL I have such a confusing relationship with this song. I would bop to this song hard when I am mad at someone or just mad in general. But listening to the album with this song on while rating it? I may be a hardcore Swiftie but I really can't justify giving Bad Blood more than a 5 tbh.

**moooo566** (5): i'd give this an eight if she'd released those awesome movie promo style posters outside the US so i could have got my hands on one, but she didn't so i won't. the best i can say is that it's not actively bad.

**simplyterific** (5): honestly this song doesn’t really fit on the album but its cute

**wasian-invasion** (5): Happy Women’s History Month I guess

**flibbityflob** (4.5): I liked it at 14, I do NOT like it now.

**1998tweety** (4): Trash

**Brendon-Urine** (4): the awful downwards leap in the vocal melody just absolutely kills whatever else is good about this song. maybe the most grating thing taylor has written

**slimboyfriend** (3.8): Epitomizes everything I feared for Taylor's switch to a 100% pop album: 1)shallow/cliche lyrics 2) bland instrumental 3) grating vocals

**ignitethephoenix** (3.5): I never hated this song (but I never loved it) but the verses are so much worse than I remember. The bridge is kind of iconic still and the chorus is well … it’s bad blood

**gelastic\_quince84** (3): yikes. so petty, almost pathetic. And in her “feminism era” too . . .

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (3): catchy yes, annoying also yes

**Jhe116** (3): The song itself isn’t that bad, I just hate everything associated to this song including girlboss Elizabeth Holmes.

=====

ImADudeDuh: **jimmy345960** (3): My favorite album in the rate has a sore spot. This is so anti everything she was saying at the time. It was disappointing for this to get so popular when there are better songs on the album. Whatever, this is probably gonna be last.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (3): so I've never actually listened to the album version of this song before, and I always kind of assumed both versions were equally bad? Oh boy was I wrong! This is definitely worse. Taylor's verses are just so juvenile it's AWFUL

**sssaaage** (3): most grating chorus ever good lord... the weird video game sounding synths or whatever in the background of the prechorus dont fit at all and the chorus production is actually so horrible

**waluigiest** (3): the verses are honestly not bad! The chorus however sucks.

**jman457** (2.5): The lyrics are so cringe, and the chorus is really annoying. It's an everything but the kitchen sick scenario. She invented punk with this song

**PointlessBibliophage** (2.5): i actually like this version better for some reason but it's still trash

**throwaway7650** (2.5): I never really listened to the original after the remix came out (not that I listened to the remix much either) but this just falls flat in comparison. for example, the prechorus is so lacking here in energy compared to the remix and obviously kendrick brings energy in his verses compared to the verses of the original.

**CarlieScion** (2): very grating, loud and generally all around annoying

**jsonphile** (2): no this chorus is absolutely terrible. It gets an extra point though for a decent bridge

**runaway3212** (2): Kendrick is the only good thing about this song so it sucks now that he's not here, except for the bridge because the line 'bandages don't fix bulletholes' is so fucking cool

**static\_int\_husp** (2): the remix is better because the Taylor only version is just utterly boring

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (2): ya'll say reputation was taylor's "cringe badass phase" but really it was this song

**thedoctordances1940** (2): The verses are the only redeeming quality

**wailord\_fan** (2): this IS bad. Yes.

**yusrak** (2): The bridge is the only thing saving this song.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1.5): for booming anthems from Taylor, I prefer the GOAT (lulz) "I Knew You Were Trouble" or "We Are Never Getting Back Together" I'm a Redhead I guess.

**2dina3dworld** (1): the only thing that saved this from a zero is that it’s really catchy, unironically. It’s not good, believe me, but it does stay in your head.

**AHSWeeknd** (1): Katy Perry

**akanewasright** (1): The entertainment weekly review of 1989 called this one of the best songs on the album. They quoted lines from it to justify it as good songwriting and I’m truly baffled as to why we let that happen.

**Alumineous** (1): This song is pure embarrassment. And I cannot help but laugh when she tries to make "You made a really deep cuAAAuuut" work melodically. Melisma didn't help, girl.

**Awkward\_King** (1): who asked taylor? who asked?

**bespectacIed** (1): RT @katyperry: Finding it ironic to parade the pit women against other women argument about as one unmeasurably capitalizes on the take down of a woman...

**buddhacharm** (1): cuz ~~baby now we got~~ bad-

**CrimsonROSET** (1): the thing is, this song is a 5.5 but i need to equal things out for kendrick’s average

**lambeosaura** (1): no ❤

**mudkip1** (1): garbage mawma

**RandomHypnotica** (1): just... no

**seanderlust** (1): my cat bit me when this song started playing and i was just like "i get it buddy"

**shhhneak** (1): This MV is the reason why I didn’t become a Sw*ftie until folklore.

**TiltControls** (1): what more to say about this song that hasn't already been said.

**apatel27** (0): Taylor trying to act like a bad bitch will never stop being hilarious

**avg-vag** (0): should have never been recorded

**bluepupz** (0): Oh man, I still remember the month-long promo for the Girl Power MV LOL. The chorus is sort of catchy, but the verses are Not Good (red flannel and all). I'm also not a huge fan of how she delivers her lines here.

**bulforster** (0): sounds like a bad demo of the Kendrick version

**duochromepalmtree** (0): GOD AWFUL. It doesn’t even sound good!??? It’s not even a bop!!!!!

**GlialUreterostenosis** (0): If you make a song like this you should be legally forced to change your name to Becky

**hikkaru** (0): this is one of the worst choruses i've ever heard, i have no idea what the production is going for, and the drama surrounding it is so dumb

**juanolsen** (0): yes this will be my cero

**KennyEarthman** (0): yeah this was cringe. also I could've sworn this was on rep, but idk I'm not really that much of a Swiftie

**ReallyCreative** (0): the sound of the song isn't bad but the verses are ridiculously juvenile, everything this song stands for is an issue

**rosecult** (0): awful, just awful

**Saison\_Marguerite** (0): That whole era of Taylor turning her squad, her stans and the GP against Katy Perry for petty reasons was not the slay she thought it was, and nothing about this song redeems the immature subject matter. Yes, it’s catchy as hell but the earworm factor just make me hate it more, and why would I listen to this when it gets stuck in my head when the Kendrick version exists?

**SmileAndTears** (0): I choose to believe this is about Katy and Taylor's past lesbian romance and that I Kissed a Girl was written about Taylor

**specialtrickholdA** (0): The entire package surrounding this song’s single release is cringeworthy, the whole era of her going everywhere she went with her “squad” was nauseating.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (0): Happy Women's History Month I guess

**Uberpigeon** (0): this song is TRULY irritating. this song gave me a rash

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): The sheer existence of this song is so baffling… It’s like the songwriting, singing, and producing parts of Taylor’s brain all collectively decided to take a vacation for this song alone. It’s not pleasant to listen to, the lyrics have the complexity of an elementary school poem (“Did you have to do this?/I was thinking that you could be trusted” is one of the ugliest lines she’s ever written), and what I hate most about it is just how awfully the words fit in with the actual melody of the song. Lines like “So take a look what you’ve dooooone” and “You made a really deep cuuuuut” are just so skin-crawlingly cringy to hear… The only redeeming quality of the song is the bridge really (god bless Tay’s bridge-writing part of her brain stayed to hold down the fort), but if I’m being honest the rest of the track is so far gone not even a well-crafted Taylor Bridge© could save it...

**ImADudeDuh** (2): ditto to all of that but ft. Kendrick Lamar doing his worst feature until Maroon 5 came in to take that “accomplishment.”

**letsallpoo** (2): Well, this didn't make it much further. At least there's a substantial jump in the average score! Let that bring some solace to fans of Kendrick, whose overall artist average across all rates is in severe trouble now.

As the single version of "Bad Blood," this remix had some heavy lifting to do. How did it tackle making this song even mildly palatable? Forcing Taylor Swift into becoming a hook girl for her own song, I guess. It's kind of a shame because I think the chorus was the weakest part of the original anyway, and Kendrick now has a 0-2 record for guest verses on pop songs, a hilarious kryptonite for arguably the greatest rapper alive. The production is better, but the song remains tiresome and drab, and when you take into account the context and the music video — a takedown of fucking Katy Perry of all people, carried out by a squad of random celebrities whom Taylor purged from her contacts in the years after this song — it really just gets worse the more you think about it. I mean, this was all over dancers who had TOLD TAYLOR AHEAD OF TIME THAT THEY WOULD WORK FOR KATY WHEN HER TOUR STARTED! AND TAYLOR FIRED THEM ON THE SPOT EVEN THOUGH THEY GAVE A 30 DAY NOTICE! Taylor held onto this one-sided grudge for YEARS until it was Katy who deigned to apologize, despite not doing anything wrong! Nothing about this made sense.

Anyway, this song was a smash hit and reached #1 on the Hot 100 and whatnot. If I were Taylor and I saw that this reached that top spot and "Style" didn't, I too would punish my fans by making *Reputation* and *Lover*. Happy Women's History Month I guess.

#A moment of silence for Kendrick's average

**anothertown** (10): This is for Kendrick's average

**avg-vag** (10): i gave the standard version a 0 so i could save kendrick’s rate average/the overall album average. everyone makes mistakes, and this feature is a tough one.

**GapeCod** (10): Fuck you for lowering Kendrick's overall artist average.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): for kendrick’s average

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i am only doing this for Kendrick's average

**akanewasright** (9): am I inflating this score because I want it to do better than the original? Yes. Is this 8/9 points better than the original bad blood? Yes.

**musical\_pyn** (8): bad blood but with kendrick so it's a point higher

**Roxieloxie** (8): i am giving this a 9 for kendrick

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Can’t wait to see how this song affects Kendrick’s placement amongst artists we’ve rated

**vayyiqra** (7): My hot take is that this remix isn't better than the original song - it's just that the original is widely hated and Kendrick is widely liked, so we want to think it's better. However I don't think it's bad either. It's just there. I do love the video though.

**ManofOranges** (6): Sorry to Kendrick I feel really bad giving him a bad score but the song is just not really good!

**jimmy345960** (5.5): elevates the song because the verses are the worst part, but the chorus and the bridge are also bad so sorry kendrick.

**moooo566** (4): feel bad for kendrick, he's so good but his lines here are basically just shit that was rejected because it was just slightly too good to make it into shake it off

**seanderlust** (3.5): (expanded mrs puff voice) oh kendrick...why?

**buddhacharm** (3): Kendrick sweet tea I’m so sorry…

**plastichaxan** (3): @KendrickLamar i hope you know that this has nothing to do with you

**TiltControls** (3): i am sorry kendrick but there was never a chance of redeeming this song

ImADudeDuh: **Awkward\_King** (10): do not perceive this

**endcreditouilles** (10): the Kendrick verses make this song, it feels incomplete without them.

**nootnoot781** (10): maybe i should get swabbed because i literally have no taste

**runaway3212** (10): Now this I love

**wailord\_fan** (10): Actually listenable.

**wavingwolves** (10): kendrick verses here being actually SO FUCKING GOOD⁉️⁉️⁉️ this slays

**welcometoNY** (10): While I disagree with the consensus that this is stronger than the solo version, it is a straight-up banger and the adlibs on the bridge add a lot. favorite lyric: use basslines to replace you

**simplyterific** (9.5): this song is good y’all suck

**sssaaage** (9.5): kendricks verses actually so good making this song good... his power. this also removes the weird sounds in the prechorus i dont like so yass

**IIIHenryIII** (9): It was already a 10 before Kendrick, but with his feature, it got so much better. How’s that possible?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Kendrick definitely adds a lot to the song, and I like how the production goes a fair bit harder in this version.

**twistedpython** (9): Same mind-altering production as the original (seriously listen to an instrumental version on youtube and tell me it doesn't shake some things loose mentally, plus this version has Kendrick covering up some of the more unfortunate lyrics (if only he took the bridge too smh)

**cashewconstellation** (8.5): one of the very few male rap features in pop done right

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): so fun

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Kendrick is better than Taylor's verses and the instrumental is much more fleshed out here too. Much better than the album version.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Kendrick saved this song

**Alumineous** (8): I have no words other than Kendrick saved the song. The score is quite generous, but Kendrick just shines so much on this track and he didn't even try.

**fallenriot** (8): yeah kendrick carried this one

**GARjuna** (8): mixed feelings on this rap

**ReallyCreative** (8): Taylor could have replaced her verses with Kendrick reading the phone book and it would have been the smartest musical decision she's ever made

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): Yes, Kendrick saved this song from being a 0, he’s that powerful. His verses take out some of the worst lyrics, and the instrumental is more dynamic. When everything surrounding it is better, the chorus becomes dumb fun instead of irritating. We love a glow-up.

**throwaway7650** (8): kendrick (and the updated production) hard-carrying this... thank god he got multiple verses instead of just a bridge

**tinyleapsoffaith19** (8): much better than the original

**companion\_star55** (7.1): maybe hot take but this wasn't MUCH of an improvement

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , boo fuckin' hoo, Katy Perry's a woke fucking BITCH, we really get it OK, please don't make a song like this EVER but to be fair, this sounds actually better, I just hope her next album won't sound like this on-

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): Kendrick definitely elevates this song

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): Okay, I am going to give this two extra points because I am starting to like Kendrick's feature verses which I wasn't a fan of before. Kendrick understood the assignment and created a fun rap verse for a pop song. Nothing harmful about that but I do think his solo music showcases his talent much better. Also, the production really elevated the song's otherwise mediocre content so there's that.

**frogaranaman** (7): why did Kendrick Lamar put so much effort into this remix

**just\_thonking** (7): mild improvement

**jaztinax** (6.6): only a little better than without kendrick

**modulum83** (6.5): TOP of Da mornin 🤠 TOP of Da mornin 🤠 TOP of Da mornin 🤠 TOP of Da mornin 🤠 TOP of Da mornin 🤠 TOP of Da mornin 🤠 LETS GET DIS SHIT 👺 LETS GET DIS SHIT 👺 LETS GET DIS SHIT 👺

**jman457** (6.4): Thinking about how Kendric won best music video for this and not the FAR superior Alright music vid. Also even Kendrick couldn't save it with 2 whole verses. Like the new production though

**bluepupz** (6): Kendrick's verses vastly improve the song. It's still just okay, but the worst parts got cut out so that's a win in my book!

**Brendon-Urine** (6): marginally better.

**duochromepalmtree** (6): I still can’t believe this exists! Kendrick, and the new mix, really do make the song better. The chorus is just such a clunker!

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): Infinitely better than the album version but this is still the worst hook in the rate

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this man really did a feature on a song on the album that beat To Pimp a Butterfly at the Grammys. Taylor cursed him I guess. Also Kendrick truly does elevate this song with his verse because it removed Taylor’s awful verses

**Ktajlili** (6): worst Kendrick song but still better than the OG

**lambeosaura** (6): I really hate the original version of this song, but the production is better on this, Kendrick’s verse, the reputation tour mashup and the MV make it passable at least.

**slimboyfriend** (5.9): It's incredible how much a low tier Kendrick verse and some extra percussion moves this song from bad to average

**jackisboredtoday** (5.2): yes, this rift in a friendship is in fact similar to the military situation in Iraq. Of course

**1998tweety** (5): Only slightly better than the original

**bulforster** (5): Kendrick's verses are a lot better than Taylor's since they actually have some flow to them and the fleshed out production also really helps.

**Leixander** (5): I may be one of the few people that prefer the solo version

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): after listening to the album version for the first time I have gained a newfound appreciation for this version, which is significantly more bareable. Thank you Kendrick ❤️

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (5): less cringe but still cringe

**wasian-invasion** (5): In the kidz bop version they go "bandaids don't fix dontchaknows" which was the funniest thing in the world. This was before phcj existed though so I had no way to share my discovery

**austrosinitic** (4): I was listening to early hip hop albums from the 80s a few months ago and I realized that from the very inception of the pop + rap single, the concept has been fraught with the very likely risk of the combination just sounding...off. Like the first major example of this is Walk This Way by Run D.M.C and Aerosmith and it’s a bop but there’s still an uncanny tension between the two groups. Sometimes the tension is dissolved, like in Fantasy by Mariah Carey ft O.D.B, but if the song doesn’t already lean RnB it can go very...weird, and this is just another example of that in recent memory. Kendrick sounds caught up between his usual aggressive flow and trying to sound mainstream. The production just becomes a failed attempt to sound dark. Taylor sounds like she doesn’t belong here either and it’s her fucking song. The video is also too overwhelmingly girlbossy and just makes you wonder if the Squad was ever real. Maybe this is where the 1989 era started to let shit hit the fan. Meh. This sucks.

**flibbityflob** (4): Like. The remix is worse than a song I already dislike, but the music video is phenomenal. My heart and soul for Ellie Goulding as Destructa X. Also the appearance of Karlie in the video...very funny to me. As the great philosopher Mike's Mic said, Band-aids *don't* fix bullet holes.

**gelastic\_quince84** (4): slightly better, still bad

**hikkaru** (4): kendrick does alright and i think there's minor production differences that make it better but i still hate the chorus

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (4): Kendrick is so good at rapping that he can do shit like this and still not lose his street cred but this song still sucks

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (4): This version is absolutely NOT better than the album version.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (4): idk if this is unpopular but the original is so much better. Kendrick really doesn't belong anywhere near most Taylor songs, but ESPECIALLY this one

**ThatOneSaltyBoi** (3.5): im sorry this is worse than the original

**jsonphile** (3): I gave the original a 2 so this gets an extra point for having Kendrick

**KennyEarthman** (3): DAE remember the Bart Baker parody? actually DAE remember Bart Baker in general

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): I mean this is the audio equivalent of putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound but I appreciate the attempt

**cremeebrulee** (2.5): where's the new music kendrick .

**thedoctordances1940** (2.5): I think it's ever so slightly better but still not good. I think Taylor's original verses are better than Kendrick's but the original was so sorely lacking instrumentation in the first part of the chorus that while even this isn't very good, it's at least something. I absolutely hate that I have to do this to Kendrick, he really doesn't deserve it.

**apatel27** (2): did you need to add this. Like I love Kendrick but this is intrinsically linked with the 0-tier MV.

**leaffan34** (2): worse with kl feature, enjoyed taylor’s verses more in original

**SmileAndTears** (2): its still ass. oh well. :(

**specialtrickholdA** (2): Two extra points because Kendrick sorta snapped on this and the production is bit of an improvement over the original. Fuck this song still, though.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1.5): this was not an improvement

**2dina3dworld** (1): bandaids don’t fix bulletholes, and Kendrick verses don’t fix bad songs

**bespectacIed** (1): mandatory "the feminism leaving swifties' bodies when discussing women other than taylor"... This is the biggest asterisk in her songwriting prodigy claim :(

**Uberpigeon** (1): spiritually, this is a zero

**waluigiest** (0): 🥴

**ImADudeDuh** (9): https://i.imgur.com/k4UCJ5R.png

**letsallpoo** (8): From my writeup for the The Top 100 Tracks of 2015, according to r/popheads countdown, where this placed at #74 (above two Courtney Barnett songs! Take that /r/indieheads!)

Phoned-in pop fodder? A canned lead single? Potentially the inspiration for “On a Roll,” a deliberately soulless satirization of modern music? Just “Problem” 2.0? “Focus” may be all of these things, but it’s also a bop, damn it. Ariana’s coquettish vocals are cast across brass, synths, and random percussion instruments that would make Pharrell cream himself, and then the chorus hits, where Jamie Foxx sounds like Mystikal and/or a chihuahua. None of this should work, but it all does. I don’t blame Ariana and her fans for trying their hardest to forget this song ever came to exist, but let’s be real: its particular strain of wackiness manages to be more effortlessly fun and zany than anything she’s done since 2016.(n)The fact that this is the first song out from an Ariana Grande with many questionable songs is very distressing!

---
#ctrl+F "Problem"

**GapeCod** (10): Problem 2.0, but Problem sucks and has Iggy on it, and this is a massive improvement on both accounts.

**hikkaru** (10): it's the way this is better than problem but everyone pays it dust. idc idc idc. the prechorus is the eat and the horns in the bridge omfg.

**moooo566** (10): it seems like people don't really rate focus but as far as i'm concerned it can totally hang with problem, and maybe even into you

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i unironically love this song it's so much better than problem

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): the superior version of problem

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Do I think Focus is a re-thread of Problem? Yes. Do I think it's still a bop nonetheless? Yes.

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I know this is just a rip off of Problem, but it's really not bad. I don't mind artists recycling their own songs or other artists' if the final product is not an atrocious imitation

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.3): I know people hate the "Focus on me" hook but I think it's pretty cool and adds a lot to the song (even if said song is just a rehashed Problem).

**austrosinitic** (7): We were all convinced that this song was Not Good when it first released in 2015 since it was (and essentially still is) a worse problem, but in hindsight I think the guy who shouts ‘fuh-focus on me!!’ may have tainted our perceptions a little too much. Let him ruin the song for you if you want to, it’s a free country, but I think the horns are still fun even if they’re an echo of Problem’s, and, besides, the melodies? I think they’re a wee bit more fun than Problem’s. Okay, no, that’s going too far, but sometimes I’m more in the mood for Ariana doing these vocal twists and turns compared to her just singing for the heavens in Problem; both are great, but still.

**cherryices** (7): i really do like this one better than problem

**seanderlust** (6.5): this is just them copying the formula for problem. it's not bad, but I feel like i've heard it before.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): this would be like, maybe an 8 if Jamie Foxx weren’t doing whatever he does. Its better than problem but god he ruined this so badly

**GlialUreterostenosis** (5): Better than Problem in some ways and worse in others, making both songs feel weaker. Bravo.

**yusrak** (5): problem's ugly step sister

**bluepupz** (4.5): Is this Problem Pt. 2? Yeah, but I wouldn't say that it's terrible. The annoying guy saying "Focus on me" is the absolute worst, and it's unfortunately a part of every chorus so that brought down its score haha.

**thedoctordances1940** (1): I already don't like problem, but at least it had good verses. Add to that that this chorus is even worse and it's just terrible.

2dina3dworld (0): this sounds like a Bart Baker parody of Problem (which is a 10)

#Comments that didn't mention Problem

**AHSWeeknd** (10): She released this after licking a donut, but it’s a whole bop and the video is a gem

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is so overhated and for what?? Because people couldn’t take Jamie Foxx’s vocals in the chorus (answer: yes pretty much)? The pre chorus is one of the best things Ariana has done

**Leixander** (10): fork a zombie

**simplyterific** (10): you have to have a high enough IQ level to understand that this is a pop masterpiece

**ManofOranges** (9): It's catchy I can't lie.

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): You know i was about to ask why everyone hated this so much but then the chorus hit and well, im not gonna lie, its been more sonically interesting than most of the bonus songs that I think im invested

**jaztinax** (8.5): shut up i love this song

**flibbityflob** (8.3): Probably my favourite song on the album. Really really good. The little bell, it's so good.

**anothertown** (8): the focus enjoyer has logged on

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): damn it I can't hate this song

**just\_thonking** (8): I vaguely remember this song being clowned on but it's good

**lambeosaura** (8): I unironically like this a lot. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAW4l1M9DPg

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Tank support anthem

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , i would rather not, the Samsung promotion resembles things only YouTubers would do.

**fallenriot** (7): this always made me feel like a baddie in middle school but i don’t remember the guy in the chorus being so grating lol

**plastichaxan** (7): okay it's not really that bad but i also don't feel strongly enough about it to inflate its score

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): fuck a zombie??? Natalia Kills is shaking!

**slimboyfriend** (7): This is my annual reminder that this song exists I guess

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): I'm realizing I've never heard this song before but it's not as bad as what people have been saying imo

**wasian-invasion** (7): a cultural behemoth for giving us the "noooo" and "cmon girls" clips for all those pop girl videos

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.9): lol

**duochromepalmtree** (6): this one never really did it for me

**gelastic\_quince84** (6): my friend played this song way too much back in 3rd grade and now I can't listen to it. sorry Ari.

**jman457** (6): Far from the worst song here, but I mean it sounds like she was retreading a lot. Also this whole music video was a product placement

**modulum83** (5.5): i really hate you for this one ariana

**1998tweety** (5): Meh

**bulforster** (5): Jamie Foxx is the only truly awful thing about this, otherwise it's fine.

**companion\_star55** (5): better than Everyday at least

**frogaranaman** (5): huffing and puffing in the chorus like they're the big bad wolf or some shit

**hunnybee12** (5): we all fall down sometimes

**jimmy345960** (5): everytime i listen to it, it gets worse.

**KennyEarthman** (5): this song said yes to recycling

**specialtrickholdA** (5): #JusticeForFocusOnMeByJUS2

**wailord\_fan** (5): like knew better/forever boy, everything except the chorus' drop is a 10, the drop is a 0

**Awkward\_King** (4): why is this reminding me of my secondary school lunch hall then... whats that about

**CrimsonROSET** (4): i mean it’s not that bad

**jsonphile** (4): it’s a good song until the chorus

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): I just can't stand this chorus sorry

**sssaaage** (4): girl wtf

**TheQwertyGuy99** (4): The subpar verses lead to a terrible chorus. Production is actually good though.

**Uberpigeon** (4): this chorus is so annoying

**vayyiqra** (4): Yeah, this song is going to bomb. I don't *hate* it, it has good parts, but the chorus is very annoying, so it's a 0 magnet in a rate where there aren't any other truly bad songs (I am a "Bad Blood" and "Shake It Off" apologist). I bet this goes out first, in fact.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): This lady really just Ctrl+C’d a whole song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3.3): Oof

**Alumineous** (3): Something about this song feels like something you'd find at the Marshalls bargain bin.

**avg-vag** (3): this is a place i can’t stand to see ariana explore as an artist. it’s a grating hook that sticks with you like a night terror

**jasannn** (3): My friend group in highschool were drifting away from each other and talking about how we didn't like this song and MV united us back together. Thanks Ari.

**rosecult** (3): i forgot this song existed tbh

**twistedpython** (3): Now this was left off the album despite being the lead for a reason

**bespectacIed** (2): You wouldn't get it the first time, or the second time, by the 20th time you'd be like "yeah this sucks"

**imasalesman** (2): oof

**ReallyCreative** (2): wow what an obnoxious "chorus" this deserved to stay in drafts

**static\_int\_husp** (2): what the hell is that chorus

**throwaway7650** (0): jamie foxx shut up challenge. huge shame because the prechorus (and by extension the bridge) are pretty good but the chorus tanks this to a 0

**TiltControls** (0): I've told this story before, but this song is the main reason I didn't do the very first rate. Came across the post on the last day scores were due. "Oh I like doing the subreddit games that pop up". Saw Emotion. "Oh I love Emotion". Saw 1989. "Oh I love 1989". Saw Dangerous Woman. Well the only two songs I know from this album (at the time) are Dangerous Woman (which I already didn't love) and Focus. Oh that's the song with Jamie Foxx's incredibly annoying f-f-f-f-focus. Do I really want to power through a whole album possibly of Focuses? Nah. So I skipped it. After watching the reveal I definitely regretted it and started doing rates. So yeah, that's why I blame Focus for that. Would my additional 10 to Runaway With Me have changed a single thing? Nope! But still my annoyance with Focus persists. Over the years doing so many rates I felt a little sad about missing the very first. I'm so glad we're doing the anniversary rerate though, cause now I can give this awful song the 0 I meant to give so long ago. Happy 5 years of rates Popheads!

**ImADudeDuh** (4): This is a song about falling quickly in love with a man, but because it’s coming off of a breakup, its unrelatable :////. No. but for real, why does Ariana sound so bored on this song? It doesn’t sound sexy or sultry, it just sounds like she wanted to save her voice for the better songs on the album. Plus, Lil Wayne’s music was always not my cup of tea, but after the events of 2020, my tolerance for him has waned greatly.

**letsallpoo** (4): An early sampling of Ariana's foray into trap music, and it's about as questionable as it's been ever since. Her wispy delivery gets as stale as the trite lyrics, and the stuttering chorus is more aggravating than catchy. Lil Wayne contributes a Lil Wayne verse. This was the second promo single from *Dangerous Woman*, and it also has a music video that features her rolling around on a bed. It's honestly incredible how popular Ariana was at this time while having, like, 1.5 good music videos total. Anyway, this debuted and peaked at #99, which is better than most of Carly's singles.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Underrated

**Alumineous** (10): So sultry, sexy, smooth, and just all of these things. And Lil Wayne killed it.

**cyborglilith** (10): underrated

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): …how do I explain docking 0.5 points from Mad by Solange for Lil Wayne reasons, then giving this a 10? well, I don’t stand by that score!! they’re both 10s!!

**sssaaage** (10): literally so good idgaf

**jaztinax** (9): this song is a vibe but lil wayne does absolutely nothing for this track

**simplyterific** (9): one of her best videos honestly y’all need to see the vision

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): wayne’s verse has no right being THAT good wtf

**1998tweety** (8.5): Sex bop

**austrosinitic** (8.5): This is a steamy album that I didn’t get when I was younger. I like it more now not necessarily because I vibe hard to the sexuality in it or anything (flushed) but because I understand why a slow, sensual ride like this is not only valuable for showing that Ariana isn’t just a Tori Kelly-type shouter but that she can take you to down there with her vocals, too. Lil Wayne’s verse is also suprisingly well-done, meshing together with Ariana’s.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): I always loved this song but it has shrunk on me, and I know it’s going to do bad in this rate lol

**akanewasright** (8): This grew on me a LOT

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): better than I expected

**runaway3212** (8): Lil Wayne saves this

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i'd love to hear a let me love u part 2

**thedoctordances1940** (8): the production is immaculate and that chorus is an smash, even lil wayne is good

**endcreditouilles** (7.5): like a woman

**leaffan34** (7.5): y'know, i dont really hate wayne on this track

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , not bad, not good though.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this song is fi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ine

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Surprisingly it’s Lil Wayne that saves this song for me, his lyrics are low-key kinda great? “The mood changed and my name changed from Lil Wayne to ‘ooh Wayne’” like come on

**IIIHenryIII** (7): Ne-yo outsold

**throwaway7650** (7): the (pre)chorus slays but the ft. does not

**vayyiqra** (7): This song is not that good - it feels like an interlude, or an attempt at a more experimental track that doesn't quite work. I've grown to like it however, though I bet it will bomb in this rate.

**waluigiest** (7): lyrics miss the mark at points but I still like it

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (6.9): least fav on the album

**gelastic\_quince84** (6): a bop, not much more to say about it lol. Lil Wayne’s Verse kinda ruins it though.

**joeeswift** (6): so good until the atrocious chorus, wasted potential

**KennyEarthman** (6): that chorus is a letdown compared to the rest of the song

**Ktajlili** (6): lil Wayne’s growing on me

**ManofOranges** (6): Kind of boring but Lil Wayne's verse gives me a good laugh.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): Would've probably raised it a bit higher if it was a cover of the Mario song but eh this is fine I guess.

**TheQwertyGuy99** (6): I don't hate Wayne on this song. His lyrics aren't great but his voice and flow fits the production.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Uhh I’ll pass

**wasian-invasion** (6): If she was gonna have lil wayne be horny on this album, im glad he's not ruining a good song

**flibbityflob** (5.9): Extremely sexy intro, the beat + the synth makes some good sounding music and I'm really into it. Lil Wayne on the other hand...boy. Not for me. Kinda destroys a song I was otherwise enjoying.

**frogaranaman** (5): this sounds like a 2013 Soundcloud song that would get featured on MrSuicideSheep

**musical\_pyn** (5): I actually like lil wayne's verse but this is not it sorry

**stryxen** (5): lil wayne just lying

**Vromega** (5): A male feature ? Day 1

**welcometoNY** (4.7): i can appreciate lil wayne in some contexts but this is not one of them

**bluepupz** (4): It's not awful, but it is kinda boring. I don't like the stuttery "lo-lo-lo-love you"s, and Lil Wayne's feature doesn't do much for me.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): feels like a weak turn of an R&B song. Ari would go on to do better. And Lil Wayne's feature is that same blah energy he had on "Lonely" off Tell Me You Love Me, lol.

**fallenriot** (4): i really don’t like her voice here, the skip effect is really annoying

**GARjuna** (4): lil wayne plssssss

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): Mario outsold

**nootnoot781** (4): zzz zzz

**Roxieloxie** (4): you know this isnt *bad* but its not *great* and its also not even close to being the best lil wayne feature we've rated this year (mad) or and its not even fun like shots.

**vintagebathingsuit** (4): this song is fine up until lil wayne's verse

**wailord\_fan** (4): Like 1989, I found to really dislike most of the album cuts on this album. Lil Wayne didn't really show up for his verse and the chorus is really underwhelming

**TiltControls** (3.5): I know this is a problem in a lot of Ariana songs, but I can honestly only understand like 25% of what she's saying here

**2dina3dworld** (3): I can’t get over how immature the lyrics are, they sound like they asked a teenage smut writer to write a song

**bulforster** (3): no

**duochromepalmtree** (3): absolutely terrible. Lil Wayne does not deliver here and the rest of the song is a snooze

**juanolsen** (3): i really hate the vocals in the chorus

**twistedpython** (3): The chorus repetition causes my ears to bleed and the thought of Lil Wayne being a sexual being makes me sick

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (3): i…have never liked this song oof

**shhhneak** (2.5): This doesn’t do what they think it's doing.

**avg-vag** (2): i don’t know what this track is trying to achieve

**wavingwolves** (2): now who thought that chorus sounded good??? girl you shouldn't have left the studio with that shit sounding like that

**modulum83** (1.5): "she grinding on this grande oh lord" NEARLY got me to give this a meme 10 but...no. this rejected Certified Lover Boy instrumental demo doesn't deserve that

**Awkward\_King** (1): lil wayne is really the only redeeming part of this song huh.. and his verse isnt even that good jsdjks

**jman457** (1): pretty boring if i'm being honest, like no effort put into making it

**Brendon-Urine** (0): sleepy, boring, fades into the background, etc

**ImADudeDuh** (3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MehzZTW-fAE if this video isn’t enough proof that this deserved to go out bottom 5, idk what is.

**letsallpoo** (0): Nothing I can say here will come close to how /u/calltehshots dragged it in [the original reveal thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/50uoxj/1989_vs_emotion_vs_dangerous_woman_day_1_aka_the/d7737v9/): 

> I'm born and raised and I grew up in the East Village/LES for the majority of my life. I grew up knowing people of every race, every religion, every sexuality, every class, every crazy personality in the book. You'd go one block passing the extremes of most gorgeous upper class fashionable people to junkies strung out in the street. The things I learned from being raised here and the people I grew up with shape me into the person I am today and is probably one of the most formative things of my life.

> For this bitch to come in and make the most watered down, white washed, insanely BORING song about New York I've ever heard and for her to actually become the ambassador for tourism of NY and seeing bus stops with quotes from this awful song actually broke me a little as a person. You can love or hate NY but for her to describe the experience so blandly like she's entering Disney World...I can't. Her New York experience is her buying overrated, overpriced cookies in the Upper West Side.

Like Taylor's other "political" songs, this song proves that the road to cringeworthy, would-be uplifting lyrics and uniquely bland production is paved with good intentions. I get that it's pretty much made to be an intro song, but like...would "New Romantics" have been that bad of a replacement?

This song was released as a promotional single, where it reached #48 on the Hot 100, and it is certified platinum. She donated all proceeds from the song to the NYC Department of Education, which is nice of her. She also performed this song [in NYC itself for New Year's Eve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHUlWsEuVPo), which I find demonic.

**2dina3dworld** (10): picture this. It’s 2016. You’re 14, and your high school choir sings this song as it’s signature piece. You don’t know what r/popheads is, you don’t have to think about what song will get your 11 and whether you’re allowed to traumadump in your rate comments. Life is good.

**Awkward\_King** (10): fuck off

**CarlieScion** (10): call me delusional, this is a clear and good thematic opening to the concept of 1989

**CrimsonROSET** (10): and that’s on unrealistic expectations love xoxo

**hikkaru** (10): this is gonna flop but it bops idgaf. IDGAF!!!!!

**jman457** (10): Will proudly live my life as a W2NY truther, as its the only song that sounds remotely 80’s also Taylor invented city pop

**nootnoot781** (10): this song makes me the most nostalgic for the album. listening to this ill*gally on grooveshark (RIP) was the pinnacle of my teen years.

**runaway3212** (10): This song is actually perfect and I dont wanna hear anything bad about it

**vayyiqra** (10): I don't understand how this has so many haters. This is synthpop perfection; it's so bright and shimmering and sounds aggressively 80s in the best way possible. I love this song.

**welcometoNY** (10): i cannot begin to describe the amount of serotonin i get from those opening beats. this is such a joyful and fun song without being cheesy or trite and it's such a good tribute to my favorite city. very underrated song lyrically and in general. favorite lyric: kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): This song makes so much sense, especially when we look back at Mean: *Someday, I’ll be living in a big old city*. The lyrics just shows how much in love and fascinated she was with New York City. What really sells me on this song is the synths, though. Do you all hear that? It’s Ryan Fucking Tedder. OneRepublic was my favorite band for a long time when I was growing up, and when Taylor got to work with Ryan, I went insane. The same happened when she teamed up with Brendon Urie. I lost my shit!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): "and you can want who you want boys and boys and girls and girls" is a better pro-lgbt message than the entirety of you need to calm down

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I remember when this song did poorly at the original rate. One of the main criticisms that this song got is that it was Taylor was talking about New York in a way that doesn't really match up with what living in NY is actually like. I get that especially since she is a privileged white woman living in Manhattan. But I feel like anyone who has moved to a new city to start a new chapter in their lives would relate to this song. That's how I felt when I moved cities and that's exactly how Taylor felt when she moved from Nashville to NY.

**ManofOranges** (9): I think this song is very cheesy.

**waluigiest** (9): I know this song is bad, but that doesn’t mean I don’t love it.

ImADudeDuh: 
**juanolsen** (8.5): i actually like this song

**Square\_Preparation55** (8.5): the song is generic, but it's still an enjoyable listen and great album opener

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): i remember when I first moved to new york I tried to do a basic insta story with this song but it didn’t show up as a music sticker option so I had to settle with that madonna song :(

**1998tweety** (8): Cute opener, love an LGDP bop too

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): other places make me feel like a dork

**thedoctordances1940** (8): While I can see why people find it annoying, I mean it definitely is at least slightly, I do still really like this and feel like it's pretty overhated

**TiltControls** (8): it's cute!

**jasannn** (7.8): This song is like 10 year old me playing Empire State of Mind (Glee Cast Version) once I stepped into the New York, New York Hotel in Las Vegas.

**jimmy345960** (7.7): gay rights before YNTCD yes gawd

**avg-vag** (7.5): this concept is cheesy but i love the escapism of the chorus - a literal kaleidoscope of loud. far from the worst in her album or discography even if most fans seem to dislike it.

**flibbityflob** (7.5): Taylor's opening tracks can be a little hit or miss for me, but listening to this? I'm 14 and thriving again. Such a good song.

**modulum83** (7.5): Inspirational and Happy 80s Synthwave Music For Driving - 4 Min (No Copyright)

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (7.5): It's a good opener. It's not the best song on the album, but it conveys the new themes and sounds of the album perfectly.

**throwaway7650** (7.5): nice enough opening track but not a standout by any means, however I don't get the hate at all. it's cute! *hoshi ILNY<3 outfit*

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , it's a decent opener but for a song about that mystically shitty place, it's not that great.

**austrosinitic** (7): This is colored with romanticism about New York which I would venture to guess is not shared by the majority of the city residents, and then solidified into something that sounds like corporate mall pop, which should theoretically make the song even more annoying. But it was clearly tailored to be an album opening and it just barely works because it does legitimately sum up her vision for this album well; the liner note to this goes “We begin our story in New York” and the synths and lyrics align to give off an appropriate atmosphere that echoes the experience of being dropped off at a new city for the first time. This is a song so fluff that it can only be played at the beginning of a story; the good news is that it is in one.

**Brendon-Urine** (7): not bad but also so unbelievably cheesy for an album this big lmao

**cashewconstellation** (7): it's an okay song, I think it's overhated but last fm says I've listened to it like 8 times and it already feels like it's aged

**fallenriot** (7): not her best, but overhated imo

**jaztinax** (7): kind of obnoxious but if i ever moved to new york i would eat this up

**Ktajlili** (7): it’s cute and sets the scene. even if it’s not a complex depiction of NYC, I think it captures the wide eyed idealism of moving to the city.

**leaffan34** (7): would be higher if my language arts teacher didnt sing this song in class everyday

**musical\_pyn** (7): Overhated, actually a good song

**PointlessBibliophage** (7): the "boys and boys" line is still a better contribution to gay rights than yntcd

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): "the lights are so bright but they never blind me" not her flexing on The Weeknd

**simplyterific** (7): honestly its giving kidz bop a little bit but Im here for it

**TheQwertyGuy99** (7): Other than the bridge this song's lyrics and Taylor's vocals on it are weak

**twistedpython** (7): Honestly the fact that Taylor singlehandedly ended homophobia with this song is the only reason I didn't give it like a 3 for being annoying

**wailord\_fan** (7): gay but in a very corporate 'happy pride month' during June and 'god hates f*gs' the other 11 months of the year.

**seanderlust** (6.8): there's a joke in 30 rock where a young fresh-faced ingenue gets off a bus hopefully singing "three buses, two bags, one mee!" before turning to tina fey's character and asking in a very musical theater delivery, "say, where does a young prostitute get her start in this town?" welcome to new york feels like what that joke is making fun of.

**cherryices** (6.7): very much an intro. it’s, like, fine… it just doesn’t really go anywhere for me

**J\_Toe** (6.5): until You Need to Calm Down Swifties used this as their defining evidence that Taylor was a vocal LGBT+ ally 😂

**Jhe116** (6.5): I still have a New York dream and I don’t want the karma to get me for scoring this song too low. The synth is cute but the hook is obnoxious.

**jsonphile** (6.5): of all the songs about New York, this is definitely one of them

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6.5): it's an alright song but a feels a bit too much like filler to be an album opener imo, but bland

**stryxen** (6.5): ...wALKING

**Uberpigeon** (6.5): at this point any location song not about LA is welcome. that beings said this is annoying

**wavingwolves** (6.2): the way I KNOW this song sucks but i still can't find it in myself to hate it

**GARjuna** (6): so fucking bland jesus

**HogwartsReject1912** (6): Made me home of hobic

**joeeswift** (6): look guys it’s the song from the secret life of pets

**shhhneak** (6): Welcome to New York hep HOOVEN HOOVEN HAY whoa

**slimboyfriend** (6): From serving as a gentrification anthem to barely alluding to being a gay ally, this song is unintentionally hilarious and therefore enjoyable

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (6): sets the tone of the album nicely but i wouldn't go out of my way to listen to it

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6): it's a nice intro, but i rarely revisit this song unless i'm listening to the album in full

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It’s not that great to be honest… idk if I was New York City I’d be a bit embarrassed

**bluepupz** (5.5): Curious choice for an album intro. To this day idk why she chose New York, since I don't think she has personal ties there? It's fine, if not a bit bland and repetitive.

**AHSWeeknd** (5): the opening theme of some forgettable 2010s musical

**bulforster** (5): Thinking about how this is esteemed music critic Robert Christgau's fav 1989 track... I feel like I could like it too if the rhythms weren't so stiff.

**gelastic\_quince84** (5): a bop and I sometimes play it when walking through manhattan because it makes me feel like im in a movie, but the lyrics are kinda cringey

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I don’t think it’s outlandish to guess that this will be the first song out. New York is overrated! My sibling went there and for a souvenir they brought me back an umbrella someone left in the lobby of their hotel, I’m angry!

**KennyEarthman** (5): added to the mediocre songs about New York playlist

**lambeosaura** (5): Of all the songs about NY, this is probably the blandest. It isn’t bad, and it was a great opener for the tour but otherwise cloying and insipid.

**poppinmmolly** (5): I think it's a good intro to the album in terms of sound, but it really just is not very good on its own.

**hunnybee12** (4): if you told me she only made this song to get a check from the city of new york to be their official tourism ambassador i would believe you

**Roxieloxie** (4): me when i go visit my theater friend in NY

**SmileAndTears** (4): Well this just sounds awful.

**static\_int\_husp** (4): I would rather hear Empire State Of Mind while stepping of the plane at JFK, and even that is an entirely painful trope by now

**vintagebathingsuit** (4): that synth line is so annoying

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (4): i almost prefer the beep beep boop boop in successful

**jackisboredtoday** (3.5): worse than empire state of mind, but better than “other cities make me feel like a dork”

**akanewasright** (3): What a bland ass way to open an album

**apatel27** (3): Her voice annoys me here

**duochromepalmtree** (3): I just cannot get into this song. I’ve heard all the tour opener arguments but it doesn’t even sound good! “It’s a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat forevermore” is a great line though.

**frogaranaman** (3): why is this frozen yogurt commercial of a song trying to gas me up like this who the fuck in New York is waiting for some average bearded white gay like me to show up

**ignitethephoenix** (3): pizza rat is a better representation of NYC then this song

**sssaaage** (3): i have a hatred of this song bc my little brother loves the secret life of pets and this plays right in the intro, ive heard it so many times omfg.

**bespectacIed** (2): I know she tried to be this chic new yorker socialite in 1989 era so bad, but sorry it always felt contrived. She'll never beat the horsegirl allegations

**buddhacharm** (2): this is one of the whitest songs I’ve heard (derogatory)

**RandomHypnotica** (2): this sounds like a high-school project where you had to write a song about your home town using garage band.

**ReallyCreative** (2): 🎶anything can happen in the Bronx🎶

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1.9): This is like the theme song for Caroline Calloway

**GapeCod** (1): Brita Filter if you read this im free on Thursday night and would like to hang out. Please respond to this and then hang out with me on Thursday night when I’m free.

**plastichaxan** (1): for a second there i thought this would have a strong start but then the song went on and it just got cringy and awful

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): Does anyone from New York actually like this song?

**anothertown** (0): This is Rudy Giuliani's fault

**endcreditouilles** (0): taylor swift said gay rights but only in New York

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (0): There is no way that anyone who lives in NYC actually likes this song.

**Leixander** (0): this is the worst song i've ever heard

**martian\_pet** (0): i hate this song, a skip unless i forget

**letsallpoo** (8): And the last male vocalist in this rate departs, on yet another Ariana single that's being unduly dragged! This wasn't a single when we did the original rate, and it looks like getting a music video centered around voyeurism has somehow made us like it even less. Yes, this was a bad single choice, and yes, the fact that this has (inadvertently) become the last single from an album full of solid potential singles is a shame, but the song itself is more than fine. Ariana sings about needing constant sex, complete with nutting quick, and while Ariana's lyrical approach to sex is a juvenile ideal, it's dumb enough for me not care too much. Future's part is pretty decent, and he delivers the hook (can you imagine if Ariana was the one going "erryday" in the chorus?) and the bridge well. This is not the first 11 that should have fallen!

**ImADudeDuh** (1): Lmao. Remember when this was trying to get pushed on radio, streaming, and even the Fine Bros made Teens React to this video?

**Leixander** (11): i have no regrets, this is a banger and deserves more than day 1 bottom 8

**CarlieScion** (10): fuck all of y’all this song is good

**cyborglilith** (10): idc issa bop

**frogaranaman** (10): this song. this one is the origin of her annunciation woes. my personal head cannon is that she saw the level of attention this song got for her saying "not quit" in a way that sounds like "nut quick" and realized how easy of a conversation starter that is for her. like how many times do you see the comment "Ariana songs are a language on its own"? "annunciation queen"? everyone knows to say Ariana when people ask the question about misheard lines, which people LOVE to do. she really leaned into it. I cannot believe this song. I really can't. anyways I looped this three times in a row anyways because that synth line in the production is godsend

**hikkaru** (10): the synth in the chorus omfg omfg omfg people died.

**hunnybee12** (10): that good shit! that make me nut quick!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I’m so glad Ariana is able to nut quick, proud and happy for her!

**runaway3212** (10): I think Ariana should sing exclusively about being fucked hard tbh this song is such a joy to experience

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.6): this hits

**sssaaage** (9.3): crunchy yass

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): nutquik

**nootnoot781** (9): this rate is really exposing my horrendous taste omg

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): aave struggle tweets but the beat is hard

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): it’s just a bop!

**Square\_Preparation55** (8.7): this song has no right to sound as good as it does

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): he giving me that good shit, that make me nut quick

**1998tweety** (8): Mega bop. This should've smashed a bit. The video is gross though.

**2dina3dworld** (8): Bon Bon Chocolat really improved on this song, but this still bops. Also the “everyday” bit is weirdly catchy

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I got her intentions with the video but it was awful

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): N U T T Q U I C C

**jimmy345960** (8): making it a single made me like it more and that normally never happens

**plastichaxan** (8): the lyric is actually not nut quick??? what the fuck?

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's hype

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): i don't get why people hate this one???? is it just men????

**throwaway7650** (7.5): great production let down by such generic lyrics

**IIIHenryIII** (7.3): Just because he’s giving you shit it doesn’t mean you should give it to us too!

**Brendon-Urine** (7): make me N U T quick

**KennyEarthman** (7): nut quick

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i loved this song at the time but it hasn't aged well for me

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): something something nutquik https://me.me/i/ariana-grande-arianagrande-bye-claire-sunsetsbutera-arianagrande-he-givin-me-5144d8f38575413e9bef8298319f83de

**jaztinax** (6.5): i get it ariana no need to rub it in our faces

**cashewconstellation** (6.4): The feature ruins the song

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): , i would rather pay for Ariana to lick a burnt donut than to ever listen to this, thanks.

**avg-vag** (6): this is a shade of basic but at least it’s an arrangement that keeps me interested.

**Awkward\_King** (6): ariana be fuckin

**CrimsonROSET** (6): you know i was vibing until future came on

**SmileAndTears** (6): Headache inducing

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6): a bit much

**twistedpython** (6): This being released as a single instead of Greedy hurts my soul

**vayyiqra** (6): This song could've been much better than it is - it starts strong and then the chorus is so weak with Future repeating "everyday". It is a well-produced song though, I'll give it that. Ari's lyrics are just weak and Future's verse isn't one of his best. Kind of a wasted feature.

**waluigiest** (6): he givin me that good shit that make me nut quick

**wavingwolves** (6): this got future souding just like my intrusive thoughts but the production is good

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.8): This sounds dated not in a fun way.

**flibbityflob** (5.5): Not a fan of her voice or the general sound on this. Good, until Future's verse, which is just...meh

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5.5): this beat is not it

**austrosinitic** (5): I used to really not understand what people hated about this song because I, as a person, used to care more about melodies than anything else in music. I still enjoy melodies the most out of every other element of music now, but I can also afford to notice the production in this song now and it is...so mediocre. The opening is a lame attempt to bridge Ariana and Future together and even if this is melodically still cool, the entire execution in general just seems like...an afterthought, even on Ariana and Future’s part. I did not nut quick to this one.

**fallenriot** (5): i like future’s part a lot actually, the rest just doesn’t do it for me

**gelastic\_quince84** (5): I just don’t really have thoughts about it? like the music video though

**ManofOranges** (5): I strongly debated whether I should give a 0 in this rate, I mean there's so much quality in this rate that maybe it's a little disrespectful to give such a low score in a rate filled with high scores. And why give THIS song a 0 when bad blood is also here? At the end of the day, I decided I wouldn't give a 0, but if I did give it, it would be to this song. It's the least enjoyable song in this rate for me. All these albums that have "duds" but this song I enjoy the least out of all the duds. It's repetitive without the charm to back it up. It's vapid without the fun required to allow for it.

**TheQwertyGuy99** (5): Too much of an EDM feel. Future's verse is fine but the "everydays" are annoying.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): What a stupid chorus. Makes me wanna not not quit

**Vromega** (5): Not fond of this instrumentation

**yusrak** (5): worst on the album

**bluepupz** (4.5): This is really repetitive. I like her singing as usual, but the rest of the song is pretty forgettable.

**Alumineous** (4): Future, what the hell? What a poor feature. That chorus brings down the entire song for me. The only highlight of the song is when Ariana says 'that good shit' in that head voice.

**apatel27** (4): beat sucks

**cremeebrulee** (4): yeah a man has never made me c*m what about it

**duochromepalmtree** (4): really terrible. This album did not need this many features!!!

**simplyterific** (4): I can’t believe that I used to like this song when it first came out this sounds terrible

**modulum83** (3.5): he give me that good shit that make me nut quick

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (3.5): this song is put your hearts up tier

**bespectacIed** (3): Nah I can't defend this lmao but ari still sounded good

**lambeosaura** (3): girl, no.

**shhhneak** (3): why did this get the single treatment again

**jman457** (2.3): I mean at least I was intrigued by the production I guess..

**companion\_star55** (2): somehow she came up with a worse version of Focus

**wailord\_fan** (2): worst song on the album 100% yup yup

**stryxen** (1): we

**welcometoNY** (1): i mean...do i even have to say anything here? future is phoned in, even for future, and it's yet another tally (who's counting?) in the "deeply unsexy songs about sex" category

**seanderlust** (0): what is that squeaking table noise in the background of the refrain?? i was gonna 0 bad blood but at least that one i can picture liking if i was like in middle school and fighting with my best friend. this one? i got nothing.

**thedoctordances1940** (0): future? more like past because this sounds dated as fuck.

**wasian-invasion** (0): do you remember that old key of awesome channel cause their parody of this had the cringiest future impression ever. 0 for dredging up those memories

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Waaaiiiittt! This is a bop! This is such an energetic fun song! It reminds me of I Don’t Dance from High School Musical 2 a bit, which is the highest of compliments I can give any form of media. I love the horns on the song, and it really gives time to properly get in some bad dancing alone in my room on the chorus. My only problem is that it ends too abruptly, but that’s a minor nitpick in such a fun song.

**letsallpoo** (3): The fact that the *Blackout* remix snaps as much as it does is proof that Britney's taint-smashing powers can elevate even the drabbest work. The thing about this Target bonus track is that the song starts out promisingly enough, but the chorus is painfully inert, and the cabaret-esque instrumental starts to grow old by the time it finishes. With some proper embellishments (like in the aforementioned remix) it could've been so much better. Also [the Ariana Grande wiki claims that Ariana herself dislikes the song](https://imgur.com/gxS3v36) but also doesn't provide a source; I'm going to interpret this as some stan hating the song enough to make up this rumor.

---

**Alumineous** (10): Greedy's younger sister. Vocal runs are on point.

**duochromepalmtree** (10): SO GOOD. Better than the majority of the songs on the actual album.

**GARjuna** (10): I have only heard this song in the gimme more mashup

**ManofOranges** (10): It's a bop, why lie. Although I have to say, I think the gimme more remix that someone posted on Youtube is even better than this.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9.5): why was this not on the standard edition

**wavingwolves** (9.3): the way i actually love the production choices in this but i feel like it might be a little hated on

**jaztinax** (9): TIL that ariana has a song called “step on up” even though i’ve heard this on tikok what- my mind is blown. i recognize all of her titles but i genuinely didn’t know that this song was hers. doesn’t feel the same without the gimme more instrumental behind it tho

**jimmy345960** (9): the blackout remix is everything

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): , go listen at the Blackout Remix of this one, it sounds better than ever.

**cherryices** (8): liking this may be a hot take but i stand by it

**CrimsonROSET** (8): step on me

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): If this was the Blackout version, I'd give it a 10.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): i wish we rated the gimme more mashup instead because that's honestly the only version anyone should be listening to

**yusrak** (8): blackout version goes crazy

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (7.5): still waiting for it to grow

**austrosinitic** (7.5): Out of every bonus song on the Japanese edition I definitely think this is the best one, or at least the most interesting. It’s not as great as the actual album cuts but I appreciate it for being a song where you get an actual sense of the choreography; there’s some folk dance they teach in gym class in the Philippines where you step over bamboo sticks and with the heavy beating thuds in this one’s production, I can definitely visualize Ariana doing a similar dance. Ariana Filipino?!

**gelastic\_quince84** (7.5): why tf is this a bonus track??? the drums are amazing holy shit

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the production sounds so cheap unfortunately but there is a bop in there

**flibbityflob** (7.4): Something upbeat!! This is more like it. Really fun, really funky, but that sample looping in the background gets old after a while.

**slimboyfriend** (7.2): She sounds like she had fun recording this Step Up Soundtrack B-side

**1998tweety** (7): the Blackout remix outsold

**astrologicalangel** (7): I love this song but I'm so used to the Gimme More Remix version that the real thing sounds wrong now

**J\_Toe** (7): the blackout remix works really well

**Leixander** (7): where blackout version

**nootnoot781** (7): gimme more mashup so much more superior

**sssaaage** (7): this actually wasnt bad like i remembered

**vayyiqra** (7): I like the percussion, which makes up for this being one of the weaker tracks.

**Vromega** (7): The Britney mash-up is an instant 11 though

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.5): You need a more forceful voice to pull something like this off

**leaffan34** (6.5): kinda blame tiktok for ruining this song

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): damn the blackout remix rlly has ruined this one for me

**welcometoNY** (6.5): giving mid-2000s minor pop hit from an artist who was never heard from again realness

**anothertown** (6): I don't know about this one...

**hikkaru** (6): blackout remix etc etc

**joeeswift** (6): I prefer the tiktok Britney mashup

**twistedpython** (6): Fine but the Blackout version on youtube is better

**waluigiest** (6): the framework is there but it sounds so muddy

**jman457** (5.7): Sounds like a Weight Watchers commercial song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.5): the annoying sample prelude to "YOUWOULDNTLETANYBODUSPEAK"

**SmileAndTears** (5.5): I don't enjoy this sound :/

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): ????

**fallenriot** (5): is that sample the precursor to “you wouldn't let anybody speak and instead”

**frogaranaman** (5): is this song based on that one competitive dance film

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Personally never been a big fan of this one, I think it gets overhyped because of that legendary “Gimmie More” mix but the Amerie pastiche doesn’t suit Ariana and I’m not surprised she shunted this one to bonus track status and never followed up on it.

**hunnybee12** (5): idk where this even came from but my life was much better 2:43 mins ago

**IIIHenryIII** (5): This is definitely not bad but there's nothing here for me

**KennyEarthman** (5): the blackout remix being more saucy than this really proves production can make or break a song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): this is such a nothing song

**thedoctordances1940** (5): there are some weird production choices but like it's fine

**throwaway7650** (5): does anyone else hear that vocal sample or whatever going "daddy" in the background? this song is so lazy, the vocal run at the end of the bridge is literally the same as in into you. blackout remix outsold etc.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (5): this isn't for me and the production feels a bit messy

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): No thanks (OH!)

**wasian-invasion** (5): this annoying sample walked so the light is coming could run

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): it's kinda stale?? it's sleepier than Focus but slightly less embarrassing

**seanderlust** (4.5): the last harmonies almost makes up for how much i don't like the rest of the song lol

**bluepupz** (4): What in the world is going on in the background... It's like a less intrusive version of The Light is Coming LOL. The parts without the noise are nice though! I'm okay with this being a Target exclusive, I didn't miss too too much.

**modulum83** (3.5): step on up to THESE GREAT DEALS FROM TJ MAXX

**cremeebrulee** (3): this song is NOTHING without the blackout remix

**runaway3212** (3): THIS SONG IS SO FUCKING ANNOYING UGH

**specialtrickholdA** (3): How does a fan made mashup of this song with Gimme More by Britney Spears shit all over this?

**stryxen** (2): why did she ruin this good song with that shit in the background ??

**2dina3dworld** (1): this feels like the first draft of Focus (derogatory)

**AHSWeeknd** (1): This is part of that musical that features Taylor Swift’s New York song and How You Get The Girl

**plastichaxan** (1): wow this is obnoxious

**simplyterific** (1): the fact that this was released instead of forever boy pt. 2 keeps me up at night. This should’ve stayed unreleased and the instrumental gave me a rash

**akanewasright** (0): How did the gimme more mashup spin gold out of this utter shit?

**letsallpoo** (1): This song sounds like she recorded some random lyrics and a producer decided to retrofit them onto some stock R&B audio. This would've been a bad album introduction or interlude (now that I think about it, it reminds me a bit of "shut up"), but now it's just here as a bad standard track. Like, where was the effort? We know you have a gorgeous voice, Ariana. You can do more with it!

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): about this song

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): arianas most underrated song

**bespectacIed** (10): R&Biana >>>

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m predicting that this one is an early out and I won’t argue with that but I’ve always had a soft spot for it, mainly because it’s the easiest song on the album to sing along to. I have many fond memories of being in college and putting this one on after a rough day and just *not caring* about whatever it was that was bothering me.

**waluigiest** (10): I forget how strong and diverse this album is until this song comes on

**sssaaage** (9.3): underrated

**duochromepalmtree** (9): I love this song. It’s so theatrical and sexy. They’ll use this one in the Ariana grande jukebox musical.

**stryxen** (9): wa wa wa wa

**throwaway7650** (8.5): ariana dipping her toes into soul is very welcome

**jman457** (8.3): Reminds me of a sexy D’angelo jam (watch this to better than any of his songs on the BCC rate)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.2): this is cute, I like it

**avg-vag** (8): i’m at the point where i’m rating the songs as if ariana isn’t singing. this is a beautiful production.

**musical\_pyn** (8): this could be a positions cut in a good way

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): i do love the horns on this

**flibbityflob** (7.2): Oh that guitar is SO good. The rest of the song is just fine, but that guitar takes it up a solid point.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , fine.

**austrosinitic** (7): Sometimes Ariana has a problem with ‘nothing’ songs on her albums that I don’t think Taylor and Carly have had in a bit and this one is another one of them. I used to remember nothing from it, but now I can recall enough to know that it sounds decent, but is essentially just a short intermission that literally everybody could have lived without. Sometimes there are moments on albums that are this brief but are still unjustly overlooked, and can be fun to hyperfixate on if nobody talks about them; I’m happy if this is one of those moments for you, but it’s not for me.

**bluepupz** (7): Her voice is well-suited to R&B songs. This song is smooth listening, with the brass and guitar.

**bulforster** (7): Random jazzy number? why not

**CrimsonROSET** (7): ah yes the well-known technique of writing songs about things you don’t care about

**TheQwertyGuy99** (7): Cool RnB vibe but doesn't really fit the record.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.8): me about like half the songs on this album

**moooo566** (6.5): i guess you could say i don't care for this one much

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): still my least favourite but its grown from a 2 to 6.5 so thats progress

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): i don't care about this track haha get it

**1998tweety** (6): A whole lot of nothing

**gelastic\_quince84** (6): she has better songs but I love that it’s about self love!

**ignitethephoenix** (6): my least favorite song on the album by far, I don’t care about this song

**ManofOranges** (6): It's a very soothing song and it sounds good... that's pretty much it.

**thedoctordances1940** (6): it's cute enough but not particularly interesting

**vayyiqra** (6): This is fine, but I wouldn't miss it if I never heard it again.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): me neither

**wasian-invasion** (6): we can tell ari

**hikkaru** (5.5): me neither

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): I’m gonna get a lot of hate for saying this but Ed and JB outsold

**modulum83** (5.5): yeah i like jazz

**Awkward\_King** (5): i do

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): boring

**frogaranaman** (5): the Ed Sheeran song sounds different here

**jasannn** (5): Me about this song.

**KennyEarthman** (5): 2NE1 outsold

**Leixander** (5): incoming comments about how people don't care about this song

**ReallyCreative** (5): it's a little cheesy

**twistedpython** (5): Boring

**welcometoNY** (4.6): this just might be the most forgettable song on this album, which is saying something because this album is full of forgettable songs.

**cremeebrulee** (4): girl me neither

**fallenriot** (4): well the strings in the beginning were pretty!

**nootnoot781** (4): so true! i don’t.

**rosecult** (4): i don't care for this song

**runaway3212** (4): only slightly better than the Justin Bieber version

**wavingwolves** (3.2): that's exactly how i feel about this song! who could've thought. just end my misery already

**plastichaxan** (2.5): me but about this song

**anothertown** (2): this is just nothing

**akanewasright** (1.5): She sounds nice I guess?

**jimmy345960** (0): Sorry it just edges out BB for the worst song for me.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): The most camp thing that Taylor Swift has ever done in her whole career is releasing a lead single all about shaking off the haters and how she isn’t bothered by haters, players, fakers, or heartbreakers,& their criticism and hating doesn’t bother her one bit and then her next lead single is about how all the hate bothered her and eventually turned her into a monster that killed off her old self.

**letsallpoo** (10): Is this the whitest song in existence? An embarassment to everyone involved in its creation? The start of Taylor's streak of torturing her fans with disastrous lead singles? The answer to all of these questions is yes, but the song is also a bop. Perhaps the campiest thing about the song is that the entire premise is wrong. Taylor, if anything, does not always react to criticism and "haters" well, and she especially does not always shake them off, but here she is with her chaotic cheerleader rally call about how she DGAF about anything you have to say! She's rich and famous and white and beautiful and you aren't, roach! Regardless, I'm glad this song did better this time around: more 10s/11s than 1s/0s, a near 1-point average increase, and an increase in position. This was also infamously the first 11 to ever be eliminated, with /u/NapsAndNetflix paving the way for delusional swifties way back in 2015. His 11 has remained the same, but a questionable Ariana 11 precluded him from that distinction this time.

This is the song that launched the *1989* era, and as is emblematic of that era, it debuted at #1 on the Hot 100 and was one of the biggest songs of 2015 and the 2010s decade. It of course attracted a lot of ire (and also accusations of racism because she included a scene with twerking in the video and apparently the only black dancers were in the twerking scene but that wasn't even true? like people were straight up going "I don't need too watch the video to know that the only black people in this are twerking" and like it wasn't even true??) because it was annoying and in-your-face and omnipresent (all adjectives used non-derogitorily). It also led to a lawsuit over plagiarism which has been ongoing since 2015. Try as she might, I guess she can't shake everything off!

Also, does anyone vaguely remember the guy in the orange shirt who dances at the end of the video being exposed as a member of /r/hiphopheads who used the n word and would insult Taylor? I can't find any evidence of it but I swear I watched him get exposed in real time one chaotic night.

**1998tweety** (10): Camp

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): , shaking my booty off to this song, never realizing I'm a future Swiftie.

**Bajuko** (10): Unironically my favorite Taylor swift song, I remember being shocked that people hated this lol

**CarlieScion** (10): there will be no explanation only ~~reputation~~ bops

**CrimsonROSET** (10): yes i like this more than blank space feel free to @ me later

**ExtraEater** (10): I always underestimate how much people hate this perfectly good song

**fallenriot** (10): it goes hard i can't make it not idc

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): It’s okay to like things that are fun sometimes.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): This is the perfect pop song. You just can’t get it out of your head. It’s been 7 years, and I haven’t got tired of it yet. I remember the very first time I heard this song. I was in shock at how bad I thought it was on first listen. I couldn’t wrap my head around it and just left it alone. I only came back to it after it went number 1 on the Hot 100, and I was like, "How?". Well, I just needed to give it a second chance, and the rest is history

**ManofOranges** (10): Guilty pleasure song. People can hate on it all they want--I know I used to--but eventually that hate circles around to unironic love for it and that's exactly what happened to me.

**nootnoot781** (10): i am not a swiftie. i am not a swiftie. i am not a swiftie. i am not a swiftie. i am not a swiftie. i am not a swiftie. i am not a

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This bridge is literally the best part of this entire album and I will stand by that opinion when this song is eliminated Day 1.

**TiltControls** (10): idc it's camp

**Uberpigeon** (10): its camp

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes, unironically I'm giving this a 10. This song is dumb but catchy and energetic and fun. I don't even care that Taylor is a grown woman singing about haters; to me this is just silly fun. I love the bridge with its goofy monologue. I hope its haters someday learn to get down to this sick beat.

**welcometoNY** (10): a fun bop with much smarter lyrics than it's given credit for and some god-tier horns. favorite lyric: i never miss a beat, i'm lightning on my feet

**cremeebrulee** (9.9): constantly thinking about that tumblr post that said taylor wrote this while also being incapable of shaking literally anything off

**simplyterific** (9.9): i dance like im possessed when this song comes on its quite embarrassing

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): objectively a bad song but i can't be objective with this song

**endcreditouilles** (9.3): no thots head empty big bop

**ignitethephoenix** (9.3): thinking about how I had to do a rookie team dance to this song

**austrosinitic** (9): I don’t know what made this song meh in 2014 but has made it so fun to me since. That’s a controversial opinion, but I listened to this song one day recently and I actually loved the euphoria the sax beat took me too; no, I would never claim this is as good as Let’s Get Lost, but at the same time I’m also giving it the same score, so maybe I’m just deluded by how alluring stupid positivity like this can be in these trying times? Alternatively, this could actually be a good song that’s just hindered by the music video being corny and kind of cursed, so there’s that.

**duochromepalmtree** (9): so close to giving this a ten if it didn’t have that dumb rap in it. But this song is FUN and hating this song is UNFUN. this is my toddlers favorite song and even as a full grown adult this song can automatically get me out of a funk. Haters gonna hate hate hate.

**KennyEarthman** (9): this is great aside from that "this sick beat" part

**modulum83** (9): imagine dragons would body the fuck out of this track

**runaway3212** (9): As im getting older im realizing that just because music is stupid fun, it doesn't mean it's bad. This song is just really having fun so I like it

=====

ImADudeDuh: **wavingwolves** (8.9): i used to hate this but it's actually such a moment. and everyone should stream the fujii kaze cover of this which is great<3

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.6): Once the context of Taylor Swift herself fades from memory, this will be more fondly remembered. It's likely to outlast every other track in this rate, for better or worse.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): When I heard this on the radio at the time of its release, I’d never hated a song more. I can admit it’s fun now, though.

**jasannn** (8.3): My immigrant mom after hearing Shake It Off and All About That Brass: Why are these songs so repetitive?

**akanewasright** (8): yeah sorry this bops

**bigbigbee** (8): In college, I met one of the prettiest girls I’ve ever seen in person. I told her that she reminded me of Taylor in this music video and she wrinkled her nose and said “Everyone tells me that. I think she looks like a goat in that video.” I disagree, obviously, but I can’t say that I don’t think of that every time I watch this MV. That’s not a good story but it’s true!

**GapeCod** (8): "I'm dancing on my own", girl, are you sure? Unlike her, you're not winning any rate.

**jimmy345960** (8): Definitely the third worst song, I like it for what it is. Mindless fun. It's also kinda memey and if it wasn't so big it might have become a lot of funny memes like RAWM, but I am glad that this exists.

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's a cute, fun track. not much else to say

**Vromega** (8): I didn't like it when it was released but it aged quite well tbh !

**SmileAndTears** (7.8): I'm a sucker for Taylor's very 'white girl' brand of camp

**jman457** (7.6): Its stupid but catchy, Taylor invented Hip Hop

**cashewconstellation** (7.5): Look. Is it overplayed? Yes. Does it deserve to be her most successful song? Definitely no. Is it fun when you've taken some time away from it? Absolutely.

**jaztinax** (7.5): i remember how shook i was when this came out, kinda like how people reacted to ME! but it grew on me pretty quick

**stryxen** (7.5): my mum loves this song

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): idc it's a bop

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (7.5): It's a huge bop, but maybe a little too big of a bop for my tastes. I only like it in small doses. I think it works in the context of the album, but I'd never listen to it in isolation.

**throwaway7650** (7.5): this song is just catchy bait (in addition to probably being the only taylor song my mom knows) but I can't score it higher because it's a precursor to ME! the brass, the self-love, the talking in bridge... naur.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): overplayed as hell at this point, but still a really fun song

**twistedpython** (7.5): Cause the overplayer's gonna overplay play play play play, but still a fun little number for birthday parties, pool parties, beach parties, wedding reception parties (etc). Really just a good song to have on a party background music playlist

**bulforster** (7): I was prepared to trash this but it's the first song other than Style with any life in it. Throw me in with the "it's camp" defenders.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): I am not going to be mad if this song goes out on Day 1 tbh. It's a bop but this is definitely not the best song that Taylor made for this album.

**J\_Toe** (7): hot take: this isn't "bad". Still only a 7 though

**poppinmmolly** (7): this is one of my least favorite debuts.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): sorry but this kinda bops

**TheQueenOfVultures** (7): Taylors best spoken-word interlude, it's endearingly cringey

**waluigiest** (7): for years I hated this song but I’ve decided it’s fine!

**flibbityflob** (6.8): Taylor's little giggle near the start of the song is so fun, and the song itself is still a total bop. It's charming, I don't know. Also, sue me, the rap always makes me smile.

**Jhe116** (6.8): She turned “How do you do, fellow kids” into a song at the age of 24.

**anothertown** (6.5): This may be bad, but it has personality of some kind.. what kind? We may never know

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): taylor ingested the yasspills before she made this one

**plastichaxan** (6.5): might be a sick beat but the lyrics make me just bop a little bit not all the way through

**seanderlust** (6.5): ah yes, the bridge that t-sweezy tried to double down on and ended up with "spelling is fun!" dunking on ME! aside, i'm done pretending this isn't fun. it's a full cheerleader anthem and i'm okay with that.

**frogaranaman** (6): fun song but I'm still recovering from its general overplay

**GARjuna** (6): if not for taylor rapping this would be higher, I've listened to the siivagunner remix so many times that I keep expecting Donald Glover to come in halfway through this song

**slimboyfriend** (6): Now that we've heard what hot trash she's capable of making in a post-LWYMMD-and-ME! world, I think it's time we recognize this song isn't awful because Taylor can (and will) do a lot worse than this.

**sssaaage** (6): i hate brass but ive heard this enough to the point where it doesnt really bother me.. the bridge is actually amazing avant garde art pop experimental hiphop

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (6): i hated this song for so long but after seeing it live and it being forced on me for so long, its kinda enjoyable now

**wailord\_fan** (6): See my comment for AYHTDWS. This is fantastically bland.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.9): after this song was released, Taylor Swift proved to the entire world that no, she cannot shake anything off

**jsonphile** (5.5): this is one of those songs that I just can’t decide, even 7 years after it came out, how I feel about it. Is it in absolute bop with an incredibly infectious beat, or is it an annoying cringy attempt to seem above the “haters” with one of the corniest bridges Taylor has ever written? Or is it both? I don’t know if I should give this a 1 or a 10 because depending on my mood it could be either or anything in between so we’ll just give it a 5.5 and call it a day

**Ktajlili** (5): not my fave of the album but I respect Taylor for making such a versatile hit.

**TheQwertyGuy99** (5): The song would have been at least a 7 but then she comes in with the "Hey hey hey".

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): My favorite thing about this song is that, if you listen very closely, you can hear Taylor Swift’s slow but steady mental breakdown as the song progresses. Just hear how in the second chorus she goes from simply singing the words to almost shouting them (specifically the “That’s what they don’t kno-o-ow!” and the second “It’s gonna be alright!”). It’s like she’s trying so hard to convince not just the audience but even herself that she does not care about the haters, that she can brush them off easily, that maybe if she sings even louder and more forcefully she can drown out all those thoughts of self-doubt that continue to float through her head. It’s like Shake It Off is her coping mechanism, but it’s incredibly unnerving witnessing her slowly coming to terms with the fact that it is not enough. 10/10 great acting

**bluepupz** (4): I do enjoy how catchy this is, and the background sax is nice. The lyrics kill me though. I struggle to take "haters gonna hate" seriously when it's repeated so often lol. The bridge is also my least favorite in the album.

**gelastic\_quince84** (4): it’s nostalgic and a fun bop, but looking back on it . . . the lyrics are cringey. When has Taylor ever shook something off lol.

**hikkaru** (4): ME! is better

**Leixander** (4): hated it back on release, still don't like it but can't deny that it is pure fun

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): can't think of a better way to make people think you don't care about the haters than to go through the effort of writing, recording, and producing a song about how much you don't care!!!!!1

**avg-vag** (3): i hate this but it doesn’t mean i won’t dance to it at a wedding

**PointlessBibliophage** (3): i hate this song *sings along to every single word*

**buddhacharm** (2): it’s catchy! but in a I'M PEPPY PEPPY PEPPY way

**HogwartsReject1912** (2): No. Only gets 2 extra points cause I love whenever she raps

**specialtrickholdA** (2): The song is inoffensive at worst for the first half but then the bridge happens… still one of the low points of Taylor’s discography.

**2dina3dworld** (1): shout out to my friends dad who used this song as a way to process his emotions about his divorce

**apatel27** (1): yt people nonsense

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): I feel like I'm listening to that "September Cover"

**AHSWeeknd** (0): the worst song I’ve ever heard.

**Alumineous** (0): I hated this song when it came out, I still hate it now. Something about the whole song just makes me cringe in second hand embarrassment. I do have to note that the bridge is awful. The beat is not sick. It's quite shit.

**astrologicalangel** (0): you could not pay me to listen to this song again

**bespectacIed** (0): Annoying, zero substance, insanely popular. The Taylor Swift of Taylor Swift songs

**jackisboredtoday** (0): hated it in 2014, hate it now

**moooo566** (0): this song is dogshit. i almost never give a zero but i'm here to speak my truth. it's lazy, it's annoying, it's repetitive, her "rapping" section is the worst thing she's ever done. the video is just as awful i'm so quirky lol #girlboss #winning #fyp its painful to watch. there are so many other songs on the album that do the "i'm going to be me, i'm going to do my thing, if you don't like that i don't need you" thing so much better. why was this so popular? if i tell someone i like taylor swift there's like a 70% chance they put this on and then expect me to dance because they played the song i like and fuck that i hate it so much. this song has genuinely negatively impacted my social life. my life is worse for its existence.

**Roxieloxie** (0): i wish this song never got conceived

**yusrak** (0): Just horrible

**letsallpoo** (8): A random glitchpop track being thrown in this synth-heavy album, complete with formless lyricism and random shouting? Sign me the fuck up! This is by far the weirdest track on *Emotion*, with every part not sounding like they were formed with the intent of putting them on the same song. It's like a Girls Aloud b-side if anything!

This is the second time "Black Heart" has been the lowest-ranking *Emotion* track, and I understand why, but I'll never find it in my black heart to hate it.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): bleep bloop, bleep bloop, this sounds like poop

---

**mudkip1** (10): this is camp

**plastichaxan** (10): V

**throwaway7650** (10): this deserves more streams wtf... will also be robbed I fear

**vayyiqra** (10): Does anyone remember in the early days of Popheads when this song had a lot of haters? I never got it, because I think it's great. Synth go bleepbloop, fun song.

**jman457** (9.6): Feels like i've heard this song before, but it feels like they made this song with crack

**sssaaage** (9.3): ok literally why do people hate this so much its such a bop

**Awkward\_King** (9): this feels like game noises almost, dare i say.... its.. city pop

**CrimsonROSET** (9): kingdom heart teas

**nootnoot781** (9): worst song emotion by far and i’m still gonna be pissed off when this goes out day 1

**stryxen** (9): i love this so much

**waluigiest** (9): this is the town tune on my animal crossing island

**wasian-invasion** (9): all her bonus tracks here would make an amazing emotion side c by themselves

**welcometoNY** (8.9): such an underrated song, i know this will be out day 1 but it's unbelievably amazing

**hikkaru** (8.5): the worst song on the album... but i'm still bopping

**jasannn** (8.5): Popheads really convinced me this was a bad song. The production is immaculate and are you guys even hearing this outro????

**juanolsen** (8.5): hyperpop carly

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): It’s cool to hear some different electro pop sounds from her, a really interesting album could be built around this and I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance. (No don’t say Disco Sweat)

**vintagebathingsuit** (8.5): another cute and overhated bop. if this comes last out of emotion i will be mad

**akanewasright** (8): This song is perfectly okay. It bops even.

**austrosinitic** (8): The fleeting presence of glitchy influences is always going to prevent a song from really appealing to a listener who's not into the sound already, but Black Heart is still a pretty great cheerleader routine for all the cybergirl mall rats of the world. The fragmented production even brings Madonna's self-titled debut into mind, making this another standout example of 80s inspired pop actually fulfilling its goal of sounding like the 80s.

**duochromepalmtree** (8): not the best song in the album but probably my most listened to. It makes me feel like I’m doing my makeup for prom in a late 90s teen movie

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I don't get why this wasn't on Side-B. It’s kinda monotonous. I still like it a lot though. I mean it’s Carly!

**ManofOranges** (8): It's cute... cute next to so much gorgeous though?? Gorgeous is gonna, you know, devour cute. And that's exactly what's going on. I might like this track better if it weren't surrounded by perfection on all sides. It's still a fun little song though, I'll give it that.

**Roxieloxie** (7.9): gotta love a super mario bros 2 type love song

**just\_thonking** (7.5): I pretend I do not see it

**seanderlust** (7.5): this is interesting! a little downbeat in a good way

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): step aside nick cave, carly rae just reinvented goth

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): this is serving spooky witch in a video game

**leaffan34** (7.2): production is cool

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , see my review for Warm Blood

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): I can see why this song was left off of the standard edition

**GapeCod** (7): 🖤🖤🖤 this should be an ari song 🖤🖤🖤

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): This song sounds weirdly... 90s UK bubblegum? Like give it some driving dance/rock production and girl group harmonies and it'd fit write in with the Sugababes, or at least Shampoo.

**jaztinax** (7): giving me 2005 annie vibes

**wavingwolves** (7): i love video game music omfg

**slimboyfriend** (6.9): I know it's a meme by now that this is the worst song on the album, but it's not that bad! It's still the worst song on the album though.

**Brendon-Urine** (6.5): I was a black heart defender back in the day, and I still like it, but the shortness and placement in the tracklist bring it down for sure. The last minute on it's own is so good but can feel out of place

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.5): WEAK

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): i like this song but enough to rate it higher

**1998tweety** (6): Camp

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Never liked this one all that much, it leans too much into the parts of the ‘80s that were better left behind.

**jsonphile** (6): worst song on the album. But still fun enough

**modulum83** (6): bonus track energy, but it's good

**ReallyCreative** (6): CONSPIRACY THEORY TIME: ok so do you hear very faint synth line in the background that starts with the first chorus? very light, higher pitched. This sounds EXACTLY like the music from the Rogueport Sewers in video game masterpiece Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door pitched down. I think it might be a sample?? Could it be?? Let's have that conversation! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xxgqbghlVQ

**twistedpython** (6): The video game inspired production choices need to leave and take the poorly layered harmonies with them

**flibbityflob** (5.7): That intro is soooo good. The rest is just kinda repetitive

**bluepupz** (5.5): This one's a bit unexciting and sort of one-note tbh. I do like that she's not doing the same synthpop sound for every song though.

**TiltControls** (5.5): a fine song on an otherwise stellar album

**AHSWeeknd** (5): The first ten songs of this album are a quality John Hughes film, the last five songs are a terrible B-Movie you’d have to go to some Russian site to see

**frogaranaman** (5): is that some military award or

**jimmy345960** (5): Automatic skip but I appreciate

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): This is a miss for me. The weird Minecraft instrumental that opens the song and stays in the background is just baffling.

**fallenriot** (4.5): idk what it is but i really don’t like this one

**SmileAndTears** (4.5): Should've stayed in the drafts sis

**thedoctordances1940** (4.5): yeah it's just quite annoying

**gelastic\_quince84** (4): the worst song on the album. It’s still not bad though (a testament to how good the album is lol)

**KennyEarthman** (4): probably just me but this sounds like Masseduction without the guitar

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): it's kinda giving me Sugababes vibes for some reason???

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): ...uh this is not catchy enough to deserve to be an Emotion song

**runaway3212** (3): this has no redeeming qualities sorry

**tinyleapsoffaith19** (3): meh

**bespectacIed** (2): it's was bad for her.... I've only listened to this in full like 3 times and that's pushing it

**simplyterific** (1): it’s just not good

**letsallpoo** (7): I believe this is the biggest tumble in the rate. It got kind of impossibly high the first time around for what was a disposable bop, and Ariana singing about "hood love" is a moment that has simultaneously aged terribly yet felt more representative of the person she's trying to represent herself as in the years since. Aside from that choice diction, "Bad Decisions" is a cute little upbeat jam, but it's decidedly on the filler-y section of the album. It churns steadily along as Ariana sings about questionable things, and then it ends and your mind mostly forgets about it.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): I really cringed when Ariana sang about how she and this guy have “hood love” together, as if Ariana has ever been to any building with a property value before $500k.

#Hood Love

**bespectacIed** (10): A BOP, but you gotta need to turn your mind off to enjoy this. It's ariana's 2010 electropop girl serve, including the cringe 2010 lyrics. I will never not laugh at "we got that hood love" hook lmfao girl you're from boca raton!

**joeeswift** (10): we got that HOOD LOVEE *raised in mansion by rich ceo mother*

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): "we got that hood love" and "ain't you ever seen a princess be a bad bitch" are terrible lyrics in an otherwise great song

**cyborglilith** (9): hOoD lOvE

**vayyiqra** (9): Putting aside how questionable it is that Ari is singing about "hood love", this is a very catchy song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I love the rapid fire melody of this one and it has such an incredible build to it, I just wish it didn’t contain one of Ariana’s dumbest lyrics. You were on Nickelodeon Ari, what do you know about hood love?

**Jhe116** (8.5): Somehow “we got that hood love” sounds very on-brand of her.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): the hood love line drags it down a little bit this song is still really good

**ignitethephoenix** (8): who let Ariana sing about hood love 😩 this slaps otherwise, a problematic fave I have to admit

**specialtrickholdA** (8): “We got that hood love” was foreshadowing…

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Guys come on, when she says “hood love” she’s not talking about the area she’s from, she’s talking about [her and her bf’s love of wearing hoodies!](https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b315a92b4a2e66e33b0ae0a/master/pass/tout.jpg)

**slimboyfriend** (6.8): Ironically enough, saying the phrase "hood love" was a bad decision on Ariana's part

**Brendon-Urine** (6.5): "we got that hood love"... uh huh... sure Ariana

**just\_thonking** (6.5): ah yes, you sure do got that "hood love" ariana

**modulum83** (6.5): On this track Ariana reveals her "hood" background for the first time and gloats that if anyone stands in her way she'll make "bad decisions." She warns people that she "ain't fuckin' with them good boys" and when she namedrops Bonnie and Clyde it truly sends a chill down your spine to imagine the hits she's called. This song isn't just a flex, it's a direct shot at all her enemies. People love to call Ariana soft or sensitive but this song further proves that Ariana is the demonic Michael Corleone gangster figure of pop who will stop at nothing. For the first time in forever we’re looking at an invincible GOAT who really lives the stories, a gang affiliated Michael Jackson tier pop-star but on a much grander scale than MJ ever was.

**anothertown** (6): "We got that hood love" was a bad decision

**bluepupz** (6): The "hood love" line is a bit questionable, but otherwise the song is fine.

**lambeosaura** (6): hood love? Lmao!

**jman457** (5.5): a fun tune but did she say “hood love”??

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5.5): I went through a phase of being obsessed with this song. Even if you choose not to perceive the “hood love” line (she’s just enunciating “hot love” weird, keep telling yourself that), there’s not a lot musically or lyrically than wasn’t done better by Greedy or the title track. I do still think the bridge is cute.

**jaztinax** (5): is she saying “hood love”? now that’s a bad decision

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): ...hood love? HOOD LOVE????  Yiiiiiikes

**MasterWizardRyan** (5): The chorus makes me laugh, seriously. We 👨👨👨👴 got 😏 that 😝😤 hood love, 💞💝👫 We 👥 got 🙌😜 that 👌😤 Bonnie and Clyde love 💒💀💀

**RandomHypnotica** (5): ari to her songwriter for putting that line in

**throwaway7650** (5): bad decisions, hm? *stares at "hood love" line and this song in general* did a boy "make [her] make" (god what a clunky lyric) them too?

**wasian-invasion** (5): if there was a music video for this she'd be throwing gang signs

**bulforster** (4.6): I was enjoying this until the chorus... They really were so proud of "hood love" that they led the chorus with it huh...

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): .........we're all thinking the same thing

**seanderlust** (4.4): letting ariana say "we got that hood love" was the real bad decision here

**2dina3dworld** (4): NOT ARIANA TALKING ABOUT THE HOOD

**avg-vag** (4): ariana singing about her hood love is about as self aware as her tanning shade

**buddhacharm** (4): "we got that hood love" is actually dialectic code for "I'm not white, I'm Italianx"

**musical\_pyn** (4): oh this one has a pretty good beat and I really like ariana's vocal delive--wait did she just say hood love

**runaway3212** (3.5): I dislike this song in general, it's obnoxious and the line about 'hood love' is so fucking cringe

**frogaranaman** (3): what the fuck does Ariana Grande know about "hood love"

**GapeCod** (3): She's said it with her chest and she don't care who she offends, aha.

**gelastic\_quince84** (3): it’s such a bop and a guilty pleasure but the lines “we got that hood love” and “ain’t you ever seen a princess be a bad bitch “ are inexcusable. Could probably make a pun off the title of it here lol.

**static\_int\_husp** (3): genuinely what would Ariana know about "hood love?"🤨

**cremeebrulee** (2): i almost 0'd this for hood love but the instrumental bops a bit i fear

**akanewasright** (1): “Hood love” is so cursed that it cancels out anything else in the song. ~~I didn’t hear that line for a while because I don’t tend to listen to Ariana lyrics but once you hear it, it’s all over~~

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): aave struggle tweets but it just sucks

**Roxieloxie** (1): I can never unhear the moment my roommate was playing this on her alexa and the chorus hit and i turned to her and said 'lmao why did i think she said hood love' and my roommate laughed and then rewinded it and we both listened and realized she actually did say hood love and we both just kinda sat there like 🧍🏾‍♀️🧍🏿‍♀️

**fallenriot** (0): “we got that hood love” ok thank you for sharing

ImADudeDuh: #Non-Hood Love comments

**allthesesongsforyou** (10): I'm so injured that I can barely walk but I will nevertheless shake ass to this song

**ManofOranges** (10): Stupid lyrics aside, this song is a bop, and I'm not going to try and hide that fact.

**superrcrazy** (10): The secret banger at the back of the record.

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (10): ain't u ever seen a princess be a bad bitch

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): y’all need to stop sleeping on this song fr

**companion\_star55** (9.7): lyrics have not aged well but this used to be my fave

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): probably the song that's grown the most on me over the years, Ilya is the undersung hero of this album I think

**endcreditouilles** (9.3): there's a pete davidson joke in here somewhere but i'm too lazy to find it

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Ariana trying to be a bad bitch here in this song is high-key cute 😭 Okay Miss Grande, here's A for effort!

**KennyEarthman** (9): the lyrics were the bad decisions

**sssaaage** (8.8): itz camp

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.3): The point where the beat drops out for a split second and Ariana's exhuberent backing vocals come in is perfection.

**hunnybee12** (8): corny but cute

**stryxen** (8): good song 👍

**TheQwertyGuy99** (8): One of Ari's most fun songs. Possibly my most played from the album.

**twistedpython** (8): Serviceable but very much a piece of filler. I do love princesses being bad bitches though so it redeems itself that way for me. Also the long BAAAAAAAAAAAAD in the chorus is catchy as hell

**waluigiest** (8): this would have torn it up on tiktok if it came out 4 years later

**austrosinitic** (7.5): Some people have unflatteringly said that Ariana sounds like a goat in the chorus. The people who invented that insult could have also gone for Spongebob, y’know? This song isn’t grating to me on that level or anything but I’m also not really on the side of people who see this as one of the best ones on Dangerous Woman. The entirety of it rushes on me a bit too quick and overall I mostly see this as a partially successful, yet also mixed attempt to go back to the quality of the first half of the album, though it’s still somewhat entertaining.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): bop but doesn't pack enough of a punch to truly be great

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): this song is a bit of a mess, but a fun mess

**vintagebathingsuit** (7.5): cringey bop

**jasannn** (7.3): well...

**1998tweety** (7): Fillery but it bops

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , fine.

**wailord\_fan** (7): a shrinker

**CrimsonROSET** (6): obvious joke is obvious

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): Ari's vocals aren't doing much for me here.

**flibbityflob** (6): I like it but I also don't. Ariana's voice is nice but the lyricism isn't there for me.

**AHSWeeknd** (5): The more I re-listen to this album the worse it gets

**nootnoot781** (5): this song was a bad de-

**IIIHenryIII** (7): It literally says bad in the title

**Alumineous** (4): r/Trashy

**SmileAndTears** (4): Hello kidziana popde

**plastichaxan** (3): okay but why would you make decisions for a man

**wavingwolves** (2.8): honestly i don't really have anything to say besides the way this sounds bad to my ears

**duochromepalmtree** (2): so generic. The first one I didn’t want to finish all the way through.

**TiltControls** (2): what including this song on the album was

**Uberpigeon** (2): girl...

**welcometoNY** (2): "ain't you ever seen a princess be a bad bitch" is the type of thing you'd see on a forever 21 t-shirt that's so marked down they're giving it away for free

**ImADudeDuh** (6): When I first went to the genius page for this song, the first line of the song bio was “Taylor Swift unveiled a little snippet of this song in her Diet Coke ad,” which says so much more for this song than I ever could.

**letsallpoo** (6): I'm so incapable of retaining anything about this song that when I went to the *1989* tour and she came out to perform this with her cute little umbrella number, I thought she was debuting a new song. This is the most median *1989* song on *1989*; it has hooks and some charm, but the song just kind of goes by inconsequentially. You know she thought she was doing thaT when she switched it up and sang, "That's how you lost the girl!"

---

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): aww, this is super cute but it's gonna get robbed so badly

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Another underrated gem of 1989. I just know that I am going to love the re-recorded version of this song much more.

**ManofOranges** (10): I think this song is objectively not that good but it's still a 10 because I HEAVILY projected onto this song at a particular time in my life.

**welcometoNY** (10): i really really love disco taylor and honestly i wish she'd make another song like this. the bridge has such great post-chorus energy and i'm a sucker for a good post-chorus. it teeters on the edge of camp without ever really going over and that's very impressive. favorite lyric: remind me how it used to be, with pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks

**hikkaru** (9.5): this song gives me red single reject but luckily i like the red singles

**jimmy345960** (9.2): Taylor trying to tell a story in a pop song is interesting, and it succeeds.

**bulforster** (9): First the white supremacists, now she's trying to grift the pick-up artists!

**CarlieScion** (9): sugary sweet like candy syrup

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I picture this whole song in my head. It’s fascinating how the lyrics are so evocative yet so simple. I also love how explosive the chorus is

**modulum83** (9): banger. bangs. fucks. slaps. goes. hits. cums.

**musical\_pyn** (9): one of my favorite choruses on the album

**TiltControls** (9): as a gay man, I can't imagine this life lesson will be of any use, but thanks for the bop at least!

**cremeebrulee** (8.7): did she write this from a man's perspective too

**bigbigbee** (8.5): This song makes me nostalgic for the mid 2000s. It kind of reminds me of those bubblegum rom-coms that were popular at that time – Legally Blonde, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, Disney Channel original movies, etc. I miss that optimism!

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): underrated bop

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): not a relevant question for me but thanks for the tip sis

**AHSWeeknd** (8): this is part of the musical that Welcome To New York opens up, except this is slightly better.

**Awkward\_King** (8): this feels the most like it could be an emotion track (complimentary)

**Brendon-Urine** (8): now THIS is a sick beat I can get down to.

**duochromepalmtree** (8): this song is pretty ridiculous but I can’t help but love it and I’m not sorry about it.

**KennyEarthman** (8): her wikihow era

**runaway3212** (8): I need to not give every song here a 10 because y'all will think im sabotaging DW but if this for some reason makes it to all stars im giving it a 10

**stryxen** (8): doesn’t work i tried

**vayyiqra** (8): An underrated cut - no one seems to talk about it much but it's quite nice.

**waluigiest** (8): just because I would never choose to play this song doesn’t mean I don’t jam when it comes on

**cashewconstellation** (7.5): It's a cute song, kind of a bop, nothing too great

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): If this were gay it would be a ten

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): stop hating this song and just try to let yourself feel joy for just four minutes and seven seconds

**throwaway7650** (7.5): the 2nd half of the chorus is great but otherwise I find this derivative of AYHTDWS, which IWYW was already derivative of so

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): omg i didn’t know taylor wrote for wikiHow

**akanewasright** (7.3): This is just Betty but less good and with no discourse

**1998tweety** (7): Meh

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , pretty fine, but not as good as the singles.

**austrosinitic** (7): The greatest Disney channel anthem that never was. Okay, maybe not, Best of Both Worlds is unironically better as a song than this. So this is weirdly disjointed, it sounds too stalkery especially coming from Taylor’s pen, and it should by all accounts be forgettable, but her writing probably manages to save this like it barely saved Welcome to New York? It’s intimate enough to stop you from thinking that the narrative here is creepy, and it makes the song cuter than it should be. So let’s give some faint cheers for the final appearance of pouring rain.

**endcreditouilles** (7): how you get the (horse) girl

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (7): enjoyable with a catchy chorus

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): well you don't get the girl if you play this boring song

**SmileAndTears** (6.8): Okay

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): this is just too cheesy for me, my heart is dark and cold

**jaztinax** (6.5): it’s always been a little boring

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (6.5): It's cute, but if this album has any filler is definitely this song. It's a liiitttle grating.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.3): Secrets from a Girl (Who's Seen it All)

**flibbityflob** (6.3): 14 year old me thought this was a gay song, and to be honest, they were right. Absolute bop. Used this one for more than one fanfiction title/ship playlist, and I'm NOT ashamed to admit that.

**bluepupz** (6): The melody of the chorus reminds me of another song but I can't figure out what it is. This lowkey feels like another album filler, but it is cute!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): is this the start of the taylor lesbian rumors

**fallenriot** (6): usually a skip for me tbh

**gelastic\_quince84** (6): Men, PLEASE do not show up at the doorstep of the ex who you dumped, begging for a second chance. Terrible advice.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): The production just isn't working for this song. There's something here but it'd need a complete remix.

**jasannn** (6): Idk why I do the dance to EXID's Up & Down to the post-chorus.

**PointlessBibliophage** (6): least memorable song on the album tbh

**poppinmmolly** (6): sound wise this is fine but i don't like the lyrics. If you left me all alone and never told me why please just leave me alone.

**simplyterific** (6): corny but cute

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Kind of annoying, and not nearly as lyrically complex as other 1989 songs

**wailord\_fan** (6): wow I really dislike the deep cuts on this album

**jman457** (5.7): A weak spot on this last part of the album. Taylor invented hyperpop

**Alumineous** (5): This is what made me question the overwhelming praise for this album. This sounds like the definition of filler.

**avg-vag** (5): no one can convince me this isn’t a red bonus track lyrically. Max Martin did everything he could to save this but it’s still the kind of song you play over movie credits when you don’t need people to stick around for a bonus scene.

**hunnybee12** (5): this feels like a predecessor to ME! in how it sounds like it was written by a 10 year old

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): meh it's fine!

**wavingwolves** (5): acoustic guitar pop... was not a moment

**apatel27** (4): "and that's how it works that's how you get the girl" sounds like "that's what the mask is that's what the point of the mask is"

**frogaranaman** (4): there's a bit of Ed Sheeran energy here

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4): I think this is pretty corny but I changed my mind on 0-ing it

**twistedpython** (4): Why the hell did this was this on the standard version and New Romantics wasn't Taylor girl I just want to talk

**sssaaage** (3.8): its surely a song

**static\_int\_husp** (3): The staccato way of singing in the pre-chourus is one of the more awkward decisions made on this album

**buddhacharm** (2): it’s giving 22 b-side

**allthesesongsforyou** (0): Kidz Bop vibes

**ImADudeDuh** (6): How Step On Up gives me fun dance scene vibes, this gives me generic broadway number from the side character who’s story ends by the second act and just does nothing for the rest of the show.

**letsallpoo** (2): The background on this song is pretty cute: The titular Jason is Jason Robert Brown, a Broadway composer who worked on *13: The Musical*, where Ariana performed. The two had known each other for some time, and this is their first actual collaboration, as Jason produced and co-wrote it. Does this charming backstory make the song, which was the third and last promotional single for the album, much better? Not really; the Broadway schtick is kind of fun, but it swallows Ariana up, and her vocals sound like they're fighting to be heard above the jazzy din. We're like just a bit more than 10 songs into this rate, but I'm surprised this managed to make it that high. Is it just because that ponytail line is that good?

---

**Jhe116** (11): I would gladly give my 11 to Into You or Blank Space but someone has to support this song, and from my knowledge to this sub I know I can’t count on anyone.

**1998tweety** (10): Serve, give us an album of this

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Literally a masterpiece, deserves the vinyl treatment with Focus on the other side

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): , one of my favorites off this album.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): AND THIS SONG TOO THIS ONE IS GREAT WHY WAS IT LEFT OFF THE ALBUM

**cremeebrulee** (10): scooter is OVER!!!!!!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): JASON ROBERT BROWN?!?! Stream "Songs for a New World"!!!

**hikkaru** (10): need a jazziana album. gaga will be bones.

**hunnybee12** (10): her performance of this on jimmy fallon being deleted on all official channels is my joker origin story

**KennyEarthman** (10): I want more theatrical Ariana songs

**Leixander** (10): more broadway ariana pls

**musical\_pyn** (10): main pop girl jason robert brown

**Roxieloxie** (10): The first and last songs of this album both being tens is kinda sending

**runaway3212** (10): fine I guess I'll give this a 10 too, the breakdown is so great

**throwaway7650** (10): more like this on the next album pls ariana

**simplyterific** (9.8): one of her best vocal performances and the ponytail line gave it an extra point

**sssaaage** (9.8): slays the haus

**avg-vag** (9.5): amazing, should have been properly on the album.

**jsonphile** (9.5): I love some jazzy piano

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.2): outsold broadway

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.2): I never heard this before the rate but it’s refreshing, Ariana should explore this sound more

**akanewasright** (9): I love Jason Robert Brown’s writing so much djhdj

**waluigiest** (9): this came out a little after my The Last Five Years phase so I was so into this

**yusrak** (9): love a lil broadway moment

**jman457** (8.7): The instrumentation on this is so nice. Ariana honestly fits sunday brunch music so well

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Remember when this song was a subtle shade towards Scooter? I think Ariana should shade him harder! But this works!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Jarb?

**ManofOranges** (8): Should've originally been on the album!

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I appreciate how different it is from the rest of the album!

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): finding out this song was produced by a famous broadway composer made SO much sense, it's SO overdramatic

**just\_thonking** (7.5): does the mix sound weird to anyone else? or like the vocals just seem kind of far away?

**leaffan34** (7.5): her vocals sound weirdly mixed to me

**modulum83** (7.5): i wanna eat this song

**plastichaxan** (7.5): this is cute especially for what people say

**austrosinitic** (7): Is this a ragtime song on a mainstream album one hundred years after that genre was invented? That’s quite an oddity, but it does go to show how much ragtime musicians contributed to the development of popular music. Quality-wise, there’s nothing wrong with this; it’s more of a bar song than Broadway, but it’s cute if not a complete spectacle.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): ariana stop putting your exs names in song titles challenge

**frogaranaman** (7): Ariana really did her homework with this album and leaned hard into the old time-y sound and vibes

**gelastic\_quince84** (7): the song itself doesn't strike me but she NEEDS to do more music with a jazzy feel like this. her voice suits it so well.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this sounds like a Yours Truly cut or something that would be done on Glee

**jaztinax** (7): this hit harder in 2016 and why is her voice so high here

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (7): love the jazz but something's missing

**twistedpython** (7): Apparently this is about Scooter which makes me love it but otherwise it's almost unlistenable. The production is certainly a choice

**anothertown** (6.5): Jason Robert Brown is a hack

**bluepupz** (6.5): This is a cute jazzy Broadway-esque song. Love the instrumentation, especially the piano solo!

**flibbityflob** (6.2): Boring start, gets way better. I'm honestly more into it than Step on Up, but Step On Up was more funky, and also! I hate Jason Robert Brown! I am grown enough to acknowledge this is petty, but musical theatre beef supersedes all. I am and always will be a musical theatre person.

**wasian-invasion** (5.5): why does she sound so pained

**bulforster** (5): She doesn't really have the enunciation for musical theatre...

**jasannn** (5): Why do songs with my name in it gotta suck?

**SmileAndTears** (5): I thought this was supposed to be good?

**vayyiqra** (5): This is a weird song for Ari and I'm not sure how much I like it. The jazz influences are neat (there's even a piano solo!), but the lyrics aren't very good and I'm not sure what it's trying to say. I'm okay with it being left off the album.

**engie301** (4.5): this feels like being on a bus

**Alumineous** (4): Ariana's voice can do many things. But for a light lyric, belting is just not her forte. The belting lacked the impact that the song demanded, and the song is 90 percent belting. So, ironically, I gave this song the score because of her vocals.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): I really dislike the way this sounds. I don't know what genre this is but it's not my cup of tea. This kind of song brings me no joy, just makes me bored and eager for whatever it's playing to be over

**stryxen** (4): this feels like being on a bus

**welcometoNY** (4): thought this was gonna be a bop and then she started singing

**2dina3dworld** (3): did she compare her relationship to being brought at a bargain sale? Mildly offended, bargain sales are some of the best places to find stuff to love

**letsallpoo** (7): I used to go pretty hard for this song, but it's been a bit of a shrinker. The verses start off promising enough, but the cadence of the prechorus is awkward, and then the chorus's "EH EH EH"s is a hook I think we've had enough of at this point. The bridge is also on the weaker end of *1989*'s bridges. We also probably don't need any more songs that reference Alice in Wonderland.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): This is one of the happiest songs about a “toxic relationship” that I’ve heard in a while. I’m still confused on if they wanted it to end or not.

---

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): , i jammed to this shit everyday for two years, by the way.

**CarlieScion** (10): that Cheshire Cat smile-line just gets to me

**endcreditouilles** (10): i wonder if her name isn't alice either

**GapeCod** (10): Has Taylor been credited on Gaga's Alice yet?

**hikkaru** (10): DIDN'T YOU TELL ME DON'T RUSH INTO THINGS DIDN'T YOU FLASH YOUR GREEN EYES AT ME DIDN'T YOU CALM MY FEARS WITH A CHESHIRE CAT SMILE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Taylor x Max is such a good team. I eat up whatever he puts out but when it comes to Taylor and him working together… No one can stop them

**jimmy345960** (10): this song is kinda underrated and I love her

**nootnoot781** (10): if this is your favourite song from 1989, you are so hot

**poppinmmolly** (10): if I could give another 11 this would be it. Should've been on the standard album!!

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (10): deserved to be on the main album + deserved single treatment

**tinyleapsoffaith19** (10): WHY IS THIS SONG ONLY A BONUS TRACK

**welcometoNY** (10): this song slaps so hard and the entire dark and twisted vibe is amazing. favorite lyric: whispers turned to talking and talking turned to screams

**1998tweety** (9.5): I thought this was from the Alice In Wonderland Soundtrack at first

**wavingwolves** (9.1): who said this is about dianna agron⁉️

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): good song

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): As a low-key of Alice in Wonderland stan, I really do love the imagery of Wonderland in this song so much.

**fallenriot** (9): yeah maybe the theme is overdone but whatever, it's still super fun

**jaztinax** (9): if anyone says this is about dianna agron i will slap you

**austrosinitic** (8.5): So has anybody watched the Babe music video together with Sam Smith’s “I’m Not the Only One” side by side? Has anybody missed Na’ama’s presence on Twitter lately? Huh? Anyone? Moving on, while Wonderland is a little rough around the edges my acquired distaste for it and it’s “eh, eh’s” (which seem like an accidental attempt to emulate Rihanna) disappeared recently when I noticed that those chinks in the armor are the reason why the song does sound like a break from a reality (in an emotional way not a musical one I am not trying to argue that this is psych) and what makes it work at being an unsettling recollection of a doomed romance. That’s probably why people have liked it all along; I’m glad it grew back on me.

**runaway3212** (8.5): God is this song great, carol lewis or whatever his name was could never

**cherryices** (8.3): 🥲 https://kaylorevidence.com/2018/08/swiftgron-masterpost/

**jman457** (8.3): Synthpop glory

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (8): I wish it were on the main album because I feel like this album's story isn't complete without this song. Not my personal favourite, because the production is a little too noisy, but otherwise a great song.

**TheQwertyGuy99** (8): A great song to reset the album.

**twistedpython** (8): This is the most dated song in Taylor's discography in terms of production and the Alice In Wonderland references are a bit over-done but I love me a little hint of Swiftgron so she gets some points

**vayyiqra** (8): All the bonus tracks on *1989* are very good - this song may be a little *too* bombastic for me but I do like the keyboards.

**waluigiest** (8): a year ago I fell into a Swift/Agron spiral on tiktok because of this song

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): the true wonderland is going down the rabbit hole of Swiftgron theories

**ReallyCreative** (7.7): the weakest deluxe track, still pretty good

**simplyterific** (7.7): was she trying to do an accent on the wonderland part??

**cashewconstellation** (7.6): My first time hearing this, quite good! Not amazing but pretty great!

**flibbityflob** (7.5): Possibly the most dramatic breakup song she's done. Like, Dianna got rid of her goddamn tattoo because of this song...the swiftgron breakup is probably one of the most entertaining things she's ever been involved with. Icon shit. They really did a number on each other.

**jsonphile** (7.5): take me back to wondaland wait wrong song

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh

**throwaway7650** (7.5): good but I don't really love the way she sings "wonderland"

**duochromepalmtree** (7): I swear to GOD if she drops the British accent in the re record I will freak the geek out. Also for a change of pace this is one of my least favorite Taylor bridges.

**gelastic\_quince84** (7): fun and I like to dance to it, but I can see why it was a bonus track

**hunnybee12** (7): she wants to be bri ish so bad

**KennyEarthman** (7): screeeeeeaaaaaaaammssss (œh)

**tragickingdom1** (7): i did not remember this production being so noisy

**akanewasright** (6.9): …These are not Taylor’s best vocals. Maybe the re-recording will improve it, who knows ~~or maybe it’s just mid~~. Kinda love the bridge though, but you know what they say about Swifties and bridges

**avg-vag** (6.5): this has always been a skip for me

**bluepupz** (6.5): The post-choruses are interesting but miss the mark for me, especially with all of the "eh eh eh"s. I like the semi-chanty prechoruses.

**2dina3dworld** (6): songs called Wonderland always bang, no exceptions

**bespectacIed** (6): Bop

**Brendon-Urine** (6): kinda the opposite of I Know Places for me, the verses are great but that chorus hurts

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Wonderland imagery will always be a *little* played out but it was especially so back during the height of the tumblr era. Also her vocals on this track are wonky?

**jasannn** (6): At least, these drops improved in rep.

**just\_thonking** (6): 1989 definitely has the most annoying songs in the rate

**ManofOranges** (6): For a song called "Wonderland" it's not giving me much of a sense of wonder or anything like that. Its chorus has got a very "2010s pop/edm lame chorus drop" kind of thing going on, which I don't really enjoy. I wasn't a big fan of this song when I used to listen to this album a lot back in high school and I'm still not a big fan of it now.

**wasian-invasion** (6): her name isnt alice

**slimboyfriend** (5.8): I'd hoped her dubstep obsession lived and died in 2012

**CrimsonROSET** (5): is this an edm collaboration (derogatory)

**modulum83** (5): this song has no purpose other than to be used in extremely melodramatic fanfics for CW shows

**Roxieloxie** (5): i give her one compliment and she starts singing in uppercase staccato or w/e i hate it here

**SmileAndTears** (5): God I hate this maximalist production. It's just loud noise.

**static\_int\_husp** (5): This is not how I remember this song going at all. It's worse, in fact

**TiltControls** (5): a song

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): that pre-chorus… I HATE HATE HATE when she sings like that!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4.9): not this "Once Upon a December" melody in the background (no shade to great movie Anastasia). And the chorus is a very dubstep-centric no for me. And this Rihanna eh-eh's??? I am not listening to this sick beat.

**frogaranaman** (4): thought I was in the product placement bonus rate for a second

**seanderlust** (4): this sounds super dated to the point that i wonder if it was dated by the time it came out

**apatel27** (3): The instrumental is just loud with no substance in the chorus.

**plastichaxan** (2.5): okay don't tell my drag mom this but i'm tired of wonderland references i know this is 6 years old but it's too late

**companion\_star55** (2.2): hmmm is this a bonus track? never heard this before...wish I kept it that way

**AHSWeeknd** (2): This really wasn’t necessary, she should’ve kept it in the vault.

**anothertown** (2): this is so dated even for 2014

**Leixander** (2): eh is an understatement taylor

**JunkyGS** (1): eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh

**sssaaage** (1): the vocal melody in the verse is so good but then it immediately goes to shit like... the chorus/drop thing whatever you wanna call it is actually so bad

**ImADudeDuh** (6): First off, I was very sure she said “to stand back wasted” on the bridge, but apparently its actually “stand back where you stood,” which makes more sense but is less fun! Second, is it me or is this song kinda from the point of view from the other person in All You Had To Do Was Stay? Third, the production on the song feels like it’s fighting itself at points, especially on the chorus. I like it, but this song just makes me feel conflicted.

**letsallpoo** (5): The hookless chorus is kind of just smacked into the song with no warning, and then it just breezes past without any regard for engaging the listener. Sometimes I think I underscored this, but the song feels so...nothing despite being crammed with all sorts of noises and quips. If this song ceased to exist, the world would be unaffected.

We're definitely in that awkward middle part of the rate where the hilariously bad stuff is gone and the genuinely good and interesting stuff is still to come, but instead of these waters being brackish, they're just kind of bland. Oh god, how many more of these comments do I have to write?

---

**CarlieScion** (11): [insert long comment about why this is the best song ms. Swift has made]

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Only Ava Max can deliver this sort of dramatic energy these days

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): must underrated taylor song

**fallenriot** (10): i love the way she delivers this one vocally

**ManofOranges** (10): I remember thinking this song was a flop when I used to listen to this album front to back a few years ago, but apparently I actually like it?? Who knew.

**stryxen** (10): no cos literally

**wailord\_fan** (10): The most interesting writing formula on this album, three verses, a great bridge, and a chorus that develops during the outro and adapts to tell a story.

**welcometoNY** (10): this is such a masterclass in pop songwriting. hooky, inventive, and bombastic. favorite lyric: stand back where you stood, i wish you would

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): This could be part of the soundtrack to a coming of age movie. Who’s gonna make it?

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): what is it with Taylor and 2am

**bulforster** (9): "When it comes to what a Haim and Swift song would sound like, your guess is as good as ours. Though we would venture to say it would sound like Tay’s “I Wish You Would,” which we think is super Haim-inspired. But since they’re super duper close, we could easily see them recording some sort of #girlboss anthem about how they all support and show one another love." - Hellogiggles.com, 2017

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Wow, a burst of nostalgia really hits me with I Wish You Would. I think it's safe to say this is one of the songs that didn't get enough love from Swifties. I cannot wait to hear the re-recorded version of this.

**jimmy345960** (8.8): Stand back wasted babe

**modulum83** (8.5): this song really embodies the particular plastic-yet-wistful atmosphere of the endless cycle of urban sprawl and decay in the commercial centers of the american suburbs. somewhere, right now, a dying mall is playing this song on the loudspeakers.

**runaway3212** (8.5): The production on this is a bit messy sometimes but overall pretty decent

**throwaway7650** (8.5): this is just a slightly faster AYHTDWS with a slightly more annoying synth in the background, still good though (FUCK SAGE!)

**slimboyfriend** (8.2): In retrospect, I think Taylor's teenage heartache and Jack's John Hughes-era Bleachers pop fist pumpers were perfect for each other. Maybe that's why they've been such a successful pair to this day.

**SmileAndTears** (8.2): This is a HAIM song actually

**J\_Toe** (8): the album tracks aren't single worthy, but aren't filler either. They're nice.

**KennyEarthman** (8): that guitar kinda sounds familiar

**mudkip1** (8): this couldve been a single

**musical\_pyn** (8): I forgot how interesting this song is? Also how in the world did I not realize this was a jack track

**vayyiqra** (8): A slightly weaker cut on the album but still good though. The instrumental is the best part, especially the guitar and synth.

**wasian-invasion** (8): a bit fillery but I do like the instrumentation

**simplyterific** (7.9): I loooveee the way she says buttons in this

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.8): I wish the chorus didn't go half-time but it's definitely a good song

**plastichaxan** (7.7): okay i'm surprised this is actually pretty good

**1998tweety** (7.5): Ok

**cashewconstellation** (7.5): Would be a 9 if the chorus wasn't so half baked. I need to find a Youtube remix real quick.

**jaztinax** (7.5): the production is more messy than i remember but i still like it

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): damn I forgot this song existed but it kinda hits

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (7.5): There is so much I love about this song, but it sadly never delivers a whole package for me. The production is kinda muddy. I feel like you can tell this wasn't produced by Max Martin, it lacks the polished perfection of his work on this album. The writing on the verses is great though.

**akanewasright** (7): This is on the weaker side, but I like the production and the lyrics are a little stronger than some of the other weak tracks

**austrosinitic** (7): I have listened to the voice memos exactly one time, enough to know that this is literally a Bleachers throwaway track. Boy, should I have known that earlier. I used to really like this because of its combined brevity and intensity but I guess the magic died around the same time I realized that she wasn’t actually saying ‘stand back wasted’ (the alcoholism will come, don’t worry, we just need to wait one more album). Right now in the grand context of this album and her music it’s just kind of...insignificant. But it’s not bad.

**avg-vag** (7): the pre-chorus saves this because the bits and pieces are pretty boring.

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's definitely filler, I just don't see the need to include this when Out of the Woods/All You Had To Do Was Stay exist but it's fine

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (7): another enjoyable song that is obvious filler

**thedoctordances1940** (7): Jack Antonoff what is it with you and your really loud drums? They definitely bring the song down a bit.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): the bridge and outro kinda save it, but it's pretty unremarkable

**twistedpython** (7): Meh, completely unremarkable except for the fact that it has the weirdest structure imaginable for a pop song and a chorus that lasts an entire minute

**Uberpigeon** (7): im getting older my bodys changing and thats not something im going to apologise for!

**waluigiest** (7): you’re telling me this is a different song than All You Had to Do Was Stay?

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.8): A lot of 1989 feels like a Taylor Swift autobiography shot on IMAX 3D and your reaction to them is gonna depend on how much you buy into her persona.

**jman457** (6.8): I honestly remember this being better. Allison invented power pop

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eql3P4-W8AEiMkM?format=jpg&name=900x900

**duochromepalmtree** (6.5): the most forgettable song on the album by a mile. Quite possibly one of the most forgettable songs in her entire discography. Is this anyone’s favorite song? I do love the bridge though. “push my buttons” is my most anticipated moment of the re-record

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Eh, theoretically I should like this because I’m a weak bitch who misses his exes but I just don’t vibe with it musically. The melody is too busy to be catchy and the production is overloaded

**bluepupz** (6): This kind of feels like album filler ngl. The song is fine, though I wish she would use "I wish you would" a little less throughout. I like the guitars!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i wish you wouldn’t

**gelastic\_quince84** (6): nothing inherently wrong with it, it’s just meh compared to the rest of the album. Still good though

**flibbityflob** (5): Another teen skip, another adult skip. It's a good song, absolutely, but I'm always looking at the tracklist thinking 'Is it time for Wildest Dreams yet?'

**poppinmmolly** (5): I think the heavy instrumentation is distracting

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): I wish you wouldn’t

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): The instrumentation is waaay too big and strong for a song with lyrics this… simple

ImADudeDuh: 
**2dina3dworld** (4.5): if you put reputation and emotion in a blender then you’d get this

**aldwin\_is\_here** (4): , i wish you would shut up, wished I never listened to this obvious filler.

**buddhacharm** (4): yet another issue I have with one of her choruses, the verses have a kind of volatile energy that just sits awkwardly against the chorus

**frogaranaman** (4): yas queen get that Netflix sync licensing

**seanderlust** (3.7): this feels like the first emotional vulnerability we get from taylor on this record, but it's too rushed. it's so airtight we can't breathe - there are some truly gorgeous moments that for a song like this to work, she needs to linger on. otherwise it's just a series of words that blur by while jack antonoff plays music in the background.

**wavingwolves** (1): i hate the vocal melody and how it sounds like she's rushing through this song to get all the words in. most of the lyrics just sound awkward and the rhymes are bad too making this have no redeeming qualities

**ImADudeDuh** (7): https://i.imgur.com/ZAIITWh.png

**letsallpoo** (3): I'm not necessarily balladphobic, but I do find most of Taylor's ballads here to be weak, including this little bonus track. She's long-demonstrated her ability to craft an excellent ballad, but something about her transition to pop neutered that skill of hers. Also, as like half of the comments here point out, this song is indeed about Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff, who were dating and no longer are. What you might not know is that Lena Dunham got married somewhat recently to a man she met in January of this year, and that [Taylor was a bridesmaid for her wedding????](https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/lena-dunham-luis-felber-wedding) I cannot believe that Lena Dunham survived the great Squad Purge of 2016-2017.

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): in another life this would be an anime OP

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Didn’t she play this in the background of her Christmas giveaway video where she drives some kid’s car?

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): another great ballad that is going to go out day 1

**CarlieScion** (10): if u ignore that this is about lena Dunham, it’s an all-time top 10 of Taylors discography

**cremeebrulee** (10): god i really have to thank l/na d/nh/m for my future first dance song

**fallenriot** (10): it hurts so bad

**hikkaru** (10): like don't take the money, it's a jackoff synthpop masterpiece if you simply ignore who it is about

**IIIHenryIII** (10): This is one of my favorite Taylor songs ever. In fact, I could say this about almost all of her songs, but this is literally in my top 15

**ManofOranges** (10): I once heard that this song was about Jack Antonoff's and Lena Dunham's relationship and ever since that day I've done everything in my power to try and repress that idea.

**mudkip1** (10): cute

**runaway3212** (10): fuck it this is a 10 idc what anyone says

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): I want this to be my first dance song at my wedding even if it was written about L*na D*nham

**wavingwolves** (10): this is the most beautiful song ever written actually

**welcometoNY** (10): one of the most underrated songs on this record and in her whole discography, a sparkly sonic backdrop sets the scene for a simultaneously ordinary and extraordinary love affair. I think this is one of her best songs lyrically and the live version gives me chills. favorite lyric: you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars, and why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

**cherryices** (9.9): loses 0.1 for being about jack/lena

**akanewasright** (9.8): this gets 0.1 point off for being about Jack and Lena and another 0.1 off for Jack giving this beat to Troye for Strawberries and Cigarettes… it’s literally magical besides that

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.8): I do not perceive that Lena Dunham was a muse for this lovely song

**austrosinitic** (9.5): Every day I thank the Lord that there is nothing on this song that actually points to it being about Lena Durham because I think it’s just one of the most emotionally affective things that Taylor’s ever written. The melody is one that envelops and comforts you in the most bittersweet way; the various times I’ve listened to this song while actually being in love, I cried. The narration just sums up those mundane little moments where you begin to like somebody succinctly and the bridge is just such a great little moment where Taylor mythologizes herself so iconically, particularly in the line “...and why I’ve spent my whole life trying to put it into words”. One of the most convincing arguments to me personally for separating the art from the subject.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): Sorry Taylor but I'm not, are you usually this confidently wrong?

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): , great but nothing else to say

**TheQwertyGuy99** (9): I've never been in love but this song sounds like the perfect way to describe the feeling of being in a great romantic relationship.

**vayyiqra** (9): This song is a grower - it might seem a little boring but it hits for me now that I'm at the age when I'm thinking of getting married and "settling down".

**seanderlust** (8.7): burnt toast? you having a stroke? smile for me, taylor. who is the president?

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): learning this was about Lena and Jack genuinely upset me

**simplyterific** (8.5): maybe love is real

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): this is such a comforting song

**twistedpython** (8.5): This would be a ten if it wasn't about fucking Lena Dunham.

**avg-vag** (8): i didn’t appreciate this song as much upon release - it’s a victim of balladphobia. listening now it builds and emotes and it draws you in. her vocals are pretty shaky so I bet this will benefit from the re-record project.

**lambeosaura** (8): the tingles that this production gives, omg.

**poppinmmolly** (8): the fact that this is about Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff troubles me

**SmileAndTears** (8): I love Comeback (ft. Bleachers)(Taylor's Version)

**thedoctordances1940** (8): really pretty

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (8): The only deluxe track that I feel belongs on the deluxe edition. It's very pretty, but doesn't fit the rest of the album.

**throwaway7650** (8): not as good as this love but praying for no balladphobia

**wailord\_fan** (8): I love it because my sister loves it but I hate that this is about Lena Dunham

**bulforster** (7.8): aw, this one was nice

**1998tweety** (7.5): Fuck Lena Dunham

**cashewconstellation** (7.5): I love everything about this song EXCEPT the you are in love part which sucks a LOT

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Sometimes it’s not the artist you have to separate the song from, but the muse

**jman457** (7.2): Good lyrics but a little boring. Taylor invented Yacht Rock

**companion\_star55** (7): a decent bonus track

**modulum83** (7): i know a jack antonoff synth patch when i hear one

**musical\_pyn** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5L3lmNh7fU

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s a cute little song

**wasian-invasion** (7): songs in second person just seem weird

**anothertown** (6): romanticizing Lena Dunham.. couldn't be me.

**bluepupz** (6): I like that she highlights the smaller aspects to being in love, but it just feels like it's a bit too long tbh. I don't like the "Yououou"s, which is unfortunate because they're everywhere in the choruses lol.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): don’t tell me how to live my life

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): I'm split with this song. It sounds nice but these "yoo-hoos"? Kinda wish Carly was singing it :/

**flibbityflob** (6): Like, it's fine, but Wonderland is such a dramatic breakup song and New Romantics is so goddamn good it can't help but fall a little short in my eyes.

**hunnybee12** (6): absolutely cursed

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Do u think she's still friends with Lena Dunham now that Jack escaped?

**allthesesongsforyou** (5): I'm too single for this

**Brendon-Urine** (5): im not thanks tho </3

**GARjuna** (5): taylor has SUCH 'white woman who fervently believes in second wave feminism' energy

**J\_Toe** (5): hi jack antonoff. I just saw jack antonoff girl

**sssaaage** (5): its cute i remembered this being one of the few songs on this album i liked but its doing nothing for me now

**buddhacharm** (4): You Are Asleep

**frogaranaman** (4): so glad she got better at writing about sex in her albums after this one

**gelastic\_quince84** (4): lena d\*nham

**jaztinax** (4): zzZZzzZzzzzZZZzzz the fact that this is inspired by lena dunham makes it qualified for a 1-2 tbh

**KennyEarthman** (4): haven't I heard this song on the album before

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): no im not

**duochromepalmtree** (2): cancel me if you must but I just cannot get into this song. It’s so slow and it takes her forever to get out each line. Friends to lovers has also never been my trope. There are also some really weird background instrumental choices throughout the song that always drag me out of it. I cannot believe she wrote this about Lena and Jack lmao!!!

**Leixander** (2): not with this song definitely

**waluigiest** (2): sorry but the fact that this is about Lena Dunham ruined it for me

**bespectacIed** (1): she made a song about lena dunham...

**plastichaxan** (1): no i’m not what do you know taylor swift

**ImADudeDuh** (9): This is a real underrated song. It’s not the best song lyrically, but there’s something just hauntingly beautiful about this. It’s a very beautiful idea of someone actually making “if you love something, set it free. if it comes back, it’s meant to be” and the love actually comes back. The soft production and Taylor’s vocals feel like a warm, comforting embrace. If I had to nitpick, I would say the drums can take away from the quiet beauty of the song, but it’s still an incredible song.

**letsallpoo** (3): That pastoral, funereal opening activates my fight-or-flight response. The lyrics are vague and sometimes awkwardly sophomoric ("this love is GOOD this love is BAD!!") and devoid of any the storytelling magic Taylor is capable of. The production is distinctly average, with the drums kicking in bringing about the only interesting thing here. Maybe I am balladphobic after all.

---

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): okay, I don't care that this song is gonna go out day 1, I don't care if I'm wasting my 11, this is one of Taylor's best songs and I will NOT let anyone tell me otherwise. if you don't like this song, you are WRONG and should be punished and I am only half joking. anyways I like this song

**2dina3dworld** (10): This love is like a popheads love for Taylor iykyk

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I used to hate this but it goes off

**CarlieScion** (10): a gorg-ina love song

**fallenriot** (10): incredible amazing beautiful stunning fantastic majestic wonderf

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I miss Nathan Chapman so bad. He and Taylor have created some of my all time favorite songs, and this is one of them. I really hope someday they work together again

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (10): One of my favourites from her lyrics-wise.

**waluigiest** (10): wow this chorus is everything. This is sonically the predecessor to My Tears Ricochet

**welcometoNY** (10): definitely the most underrated song on this album and probably in her whole discography. the whole thing has this hushed, reverent quality while still being dynamic and haunting. the lyrics are absolutely stunning, but it's really the melodies and the whole world that she's built here that make this song so special. some of her best imagery and lyricism ever. favorite lyric: tossing, turned, struggled through the night with someone new

**companion\_star55** (9.6): this album really needed more acoustic numbers

**throwaway7650** (9.5): very cute ballad, really want to hear (taylor's version) of this

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): , i love songs that actually sounds like it was made in the 80s but not really.

**austrosinitic** (9): I DON’T GET WHY YOU PEOPLE HATE THIS. Yeah, the production is lowkey for the album just like Sad, Beautiful Tragic’s was and it doesn’t fit the rest of the songs as well since this was probably either a Speak Now or a Red track that got shafted onto 1989 instead, but I can’t understand how people don’t visualize the beauty of This Love; a slow ballad with lyrics as pretty as these is exactly my type of thing and I seriously think it’s the best balance of amazing symbolism with piercing narration that she ever achieved before Folklore. I will die on this hill.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): It's crazy to think that Nathan Chapman produced this. There's definitely a mix of Red's lyricism to 1989's staple synthpop production.

**duochromepalmtree** (9): this song is gorgeous. I cannot wait to hear the re record because I think this song will finally have its moment with her more mature vocals. Hoping popheads has good taste and this one doesn’t go out too early!

**runaway3212** (9): Nathan Chapman should produce more pop songs

**wasian-invasion** (9): ooh I love how this builds

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.7): some good 80's throwback pop. Taylor's voice sounds nice here. Almost dream pop-like.

**jimmy345960** (8.6): The poem is actually the weakest part of this song, but for some reason, this song actually makes me imagine giant city sized wheels that are slowly moving over a landscape, in the most gorgeous way.

**avg-vag** (8.5): an underrated ballad, would be beautiful stripped down folklore style

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): You can really tell that this was written as a poem because the lyrics kinda don’t sound like anything else on the album? But that’s kinda good in a way, I like how dreamy it is and how soft the production is to match. I do wish it had a bit more direction to pull everything together though

**jsonphile** (8.5): Maroon 5 better oh god I can’t believe I just said that please don’t crucify me I swear I just like some of their 2000s songs

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): I know y'all will tank this but I think it's pretty.

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Finally some good fucking music

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): ugh i'm such a sucker for those slow arpeggiated synths

**wavingwolves** (8.5): the bridge of this being both so good and bad because of the way she isn't able to fit the lyrics to the melody so she just rushes through it... but i'm still yassing because the production is good

**modulum83** (8.3): please taylor just collab with american football already

**akanewasright** (8.2): The chorus is a bit basic perhaps, but I think it sounds nice, and I love the verses, bridge, and the breakdown of “this love THIS LOVE this loooove”

**cashewconstellation** (8): I think this is my first time hearing this song and it's very very good, very gentle, very dreamy.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this song is nice but it does not fit on this album at all

**seanderlust** (8): this one is kind of underrated I think! it's beautiful

**static\_int\_husp** (8): ok this is cute

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (8): gorgeous song

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): i think this is super underrated in Taylor's discography. That pulsing synth line throughout the song is great too

**vayyiqra** (8): Balladophobia will tank this song but it is pretty even if it's not one of the best songs on the album.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): It’s pretty

**jman457** (7.6): honestly a pretty good but nor great softer song. Taylor invented dream pop

**1998tweety** (7.5): She'...alright

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): I love the wordless vocalizations and the aquatic themes and I'm baffled at how hard this song got shellacked in the original rate

**twistedpython** (7.5): Slow and snooze-ish but props for the solo writing credit, which is difficult to get not everybody has that to their credit

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): :floating:

**allthesesongsforyou** (7): I wanna rate this one higher but the line "this love is good, this love is bad" ruins it for me every time...she really couldn't think of anything more profound that that?

**bluepupz** (7): This has a sort of cyclical/hypnotic nature to it. It's a slower and more relaxing song, which is nice.

**jaztinax** (7): i used to think this song was a snooze but it’s prettier than i remember

**stryxen** (7): this love is good 👍

**TiltControls** (7): this love is an alright song

**Roxieloxie** (6.6): i cant believe the ballads on this album are kinda eating up the other songs

**jasannn** (6.5): As usual, the bridge saves this.

**slimboyfriend** (6.3): A lesser Swiftian ballad for sure, but the end is pretty

**Alumineous** (6): Pleasing to the ear, but devoid of any substance.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this love isnt crazy (2020)

**KennyEarthman** (6): this love is meh

**wailord\_fan** (6): serving self titled ballad realness

**buddhacharm** (5): I want to like this so bad but the chorus is SUCH a flop, people exalt Taylor for her songwriting sensibilities but like...could she really not imagine a better chorus than “this love is good, this love is bad, etc.”

**flibbityflob** (5): the second half of 1989 is kinda....just a snooze. It's slow, it's boring, I just don't really care for it.

**GARjuna** (5): jesus this album is long

**gelastic\_quince84** (5): pretty song, but a ballad on my synth pop heaven? Get outta here.

**ManofOranges** (5): This song is boring to me! Call it what you want (probably balladphobia) but I just can't bring myself to want to listen to this whole song. Like why would I listen to this when I could listen to "You Are in Love"? They feel like they're meant to fulfill the same purpose but "You Are in Love" is simply better at it.

**ReallyCreative** (5): would it be a Taylor Swift album without an absurdly mediocre ballad?

**simplyterific** (5): sounds like the song that plays at the end of a lifetime movie where the kids convince their divorced parents to get back together. I don’t like that

**anothertown** (4): Has Taken Control of Me. She Said Goodbye Too Many Times Before

**frogaranaman** (4): something about this song (it being bad) is telling me this relationship failed

**nootnoot781** (4): i cannot forgive boredom

**sssaaage** (4): its not even bad but i feel nothing (this could be my comment for like most songs on this album)

**plastichaxan** (3.8): gia gunn i was so bored.jpg

**Leixander** (3): this song is bad

**Awkward\_King** (1): i feel like i should like this because its like a cheesy 80s synth ballad but..... why do i not enjoy anything about this

**ImADudeDuh** (5): its meh.

**letsallpoo** (5): I've never fully understood the loud minority of Arianators who go hard for this song. Maybe it's just because hearing a dude going "la la la" over a guitar instantly puts me on edge, but this song feels a little slight when juxtaposed with something like "Thinking Bout You". It's a cute little diddly, and Ariana's vocals are exquisite, but I'm content with its placement here.

---

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (11): maybe my fav pop song ever sooo good

**bespectacIed** (10): Hard to blame the gays for wanting ariana to be stuck on pop when Max Martin and Ilya put their entire pussies into this album. Like cmon, this is textbook flawless pop production

**cyborglilith** (10): BOP

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The best bridge of Ariana’s discography, bar none.

**rosecult** (10): cute!

**throwaway7650** (10): the chorus production and the "when you're not here" at the end of the bridge... I'm ascending. if ariana finds this boring like touch it I'm going to go insane. LA LA LA LA LA LA LA (god I really can't escape mafuyu)

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): ariana’s most underrated song iktr

**akanewasright** (9.5): The bridge is one of the best moments on the album, I don’t make the rules

**sssaaage** (9.5): the chorus slays so bad

**Alumineous** (9): Nintendo lawyers be bringing a cease and desist for those Mario Kart sounds.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): when I heard the acoustic guitar I was worried but this song ended up being good

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this is the best song i hadn’t heard before

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This is such an underrated Ariana track tbh.

**runaway3212** (9): You know what? this is fun

**twistedpython** (9): Under appreciated and for what. This should be a fan favorite and no one seems to like it. The guitar is so smooth and crisp

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I never realized how much I liked this song… but it sounds great!

**waluigiest** (9): I think this song is beautiful, and it gets surprisingly lush in the chorus.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.8): I heard a killer mashup between this and "Dilemma" by Kelly Rowland and that's the version I'm rating

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): don’t love the la la las but Ariana killed it on the rest of the song

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): takes a minute to get going but I really like it

**AHSWeeknd** (8): That intro bit ruins it

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): , i love the way that the chorus sounds.

**anothertown** (8): it's nice

**GapeCod** (8): Some crimes. (roxie, i still don't know what that reference is)

**ManofOranges** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C5xpF-USA

**modulum83** (8): when the vocoder comes in i start floating

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (8): in retrospect, this song was a good indicator of where ariana wanted to go musically

**yusrak** (8): live version of this is so beautiful

**flibbityflob** (7.8): Now...this is more my speed. That last chorus hits in a very fun way.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.8): Ilya & Max can really make even the most basic song sound like a luscious electro-pop masterpiece.

**bluepupz** (7.5): The vocal layering during the bridge is great, and I just generally like the production choices throughout.

**TheQwertyGuy99** (7.5): Really sweet song. The bridge is full of emotion.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.3): Ariana is singing really well here. But WHO is singing at the start of this song?? Frankie Grande??? Huh?????

**austrosinitic** (7): I remember some people arguing for the quality of this one when this album was just released, but to me it’s essentially a replica of a quick, decent pop hit by a B-list star who charts at #40 and then never comes back to Billboard, except adapted for Ariana and also bumped up in quality a bit since she’s one of the biggest stars in the world and can afford better production, in addition to having a great voice that can add to songs like these. But still, this is no lost classic.

**duochromepalmtree** (7): there isn’t a lot to say about this one. It is a song that exists and isn’t completely awful to listen to

**KennyEarthman** (7): Everyday, Sometimes, everytime... can't wait for Never

**musical\_pyn** (7): the beginning of this sounds like billionaire by travie mccoy but the rest of the song makes up for it (especially that bridge)

**stryxen** (7): good song 👍

**thedoctordances1940** (7): it's good but not the most memorable

**vayyiqra** (7): Going to take away a point for the weird lyric "tattoos on my mind". It's an okay song though.

**jman457** (6.6): a fun acoustic jam, but the lalala’s are really grating

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): sometimes I run sometimes I hide sometimes I yawn sometimes I skip

**slimboyfriend** (6.1): Ew who's that guy singing in the beginning

**1998tweety** (6): Filler

**PointlessBibliophage** (6): anyways stream sometimes by britney spears <3

**frogaranaman** (5): pretty sure they just madr that shijt up

**avg-vag** (4): this is a category of faux deep pop paired with a beachy guitar riffs and a white guy ad libbing that i just can’t stomach

**fallenriot** (4): just not my thing, sorry

**gelastic\_quince84** (4): the “la la la” is weird and the hook is so clunky and I’m pretty sure grammatically incorrect. It’s still catchy though and I hate myself for that.

**wavingwolves** (4): and again.... acoustic guitar pop... was not a moment

**IIIHenryIII** (3): I could tell I was going to hate this for the moment it started playing. Who the hell is singing those la la la’s? https://youtube.com/clip/UgxRVmT6pFLGSYoxlT54AaABCQ

**2dina3dworld** (1): this highlights the low points of Dangerous Woman imo. Too much reliance on hooks and upbeat pop hits at the expense of lyrics and actually using the good parts of pop to make a good song that doesn’t just feel like a quick attempt at worming their way into people’s consciousness so that the next Ariana album hits.

**companion\_star55** (1): really hate the production on this. sounds like some poorly mixed jason mraz

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I don’t know if I like this. It feels like something from a Broadway show, but it just kinda... exists? Macy Gray doesn’t add that much to this song either, which is kinda disappointing.

**letsallpoo** (5): I remember when I first listened to this album, I thought the vocalist here was male, and I just want to apologize to Macy Gray again for ever thinking a m*n could sing that well. Her part is quite nice, too, full of intrigue and mystery, but then Ariana sets in and the song gets a little dialtory and plain. I'm glad that Ariana largely abandoned the showtune-y thing after this album; it's not a style that I think she's particularly good at channeling when it comes to pop music, even if her voice is prime for that kind of thing.

---

**cyborglilith** (11): periodt

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I used to love this, Macy Gray and Ariana have great contrast

**Alumineous** (10): This is a god tier track. I never watched Fifty Shades, but it sounds like it would work on that soundtrack. Vocals are on point, lyrics on point, emotive delivery on point. And the Macy Gray feature is perfect. Future? Take notes.

**anothertown** (10): To me, 5 years ago, a full on torch song with Macy Gray was the ultimate symbol of artistry for an upcoming main pop girl. And maybe it still is!

**Leixander** (10): dangerous love... you're no good for me darlin'

**Osaka1268** (10): ariana sounds great and all but honestly macy completely outshines her

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): An 11 contender, Macy’s part gives me chills and Ariana went OFF vocally, they complement each other so well.

**seanderlust** (10): where's that video of wayne brady pretending to be macy gray being slowly rolled over by a steamroller

**throwaway7650** (10): omfg that intro (DISCO MOMENT?)... all of the songs in triple metre on this album are really fucking good huh

**twistedpython** (10): Macy Gray's voice is very, very nice

**Vromega** (10): Their voices heal me

**yusrak** (10): the bond song we deserve

**akanewasright** (9.5): fuck you all, this is good

**wavingwolves** (9.1): this hits just right

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): this is so cinematic

**ManofOranges** (9): It's a hit to me.

**sssaaage** (9): smash.

**austrosinitic** (8.5): I saw Macy Gray on a Billboard recap the other day and I was shocked to recognize her from this song! It’s one I’ve learned to love more as I’ve gotten more exposed to Ariana’s influences from RnB and soul; both her and Macy really succeed at releasing feelings of temptation and fraught indecision in their voices here, even if they contrast in between high and low. It’s slightly less catchy than the rest of Dangerous Woman, but their vocals make it work almost as well as its highlights.

**bluepupz** (8.5): I adore the contrast between Macy Gray and Ariana's voices. It's dramatic and fun to sing along to.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Ariana tapping Macy Gray for this album kinda came out of nowhere but it was a great choice, her voice is haunting and she fits perfectly into the darker world of the album. Really, I just love Macy Gray. I think she’s such an underrated artist and she’s got a great discography, I dare you to put on “I Try” and not feel a little nostalgic. Everyone should check out her most recent album *Ruby*, it’s so nice on the ears.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): this feels magical and macy fits so well on the track

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): , okay okay, I would...

**apatel27** (8): solid RnB track

**CrimsonROSET** (8): let me tell you i originally read it as (ft. Mariah Carey) and had a very visible reaction to i

**fallenriot** (8): macy gray is incredible i love her voice so much!

**hunnybee12** (8): macy gray is a legend but her feature doesn't mesh with the song to me

**vayyiqra** (8): The tracklist of this album is kind of all over the place and the whiplash between "Greedy" being an uptempo bop and this is a lot, but I still like it.

**waluigiest** (8): honestly high drama here

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): I like it, but I think Macy could have been utilized better

**cherryices** (7.6): i feel like ari’s voice was a little light for the instrumental at this point in time

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): Ari and Macy collabing was fun. they should do it again

**jman457** (7.3): Justice for Macy Gray, but why does this sound like an oscar nominated “empowerment song” that John Legend would write.

**KennyEarthman** (7): she's singing!!!

**musical\_pyn** (7): why are the features on this album so good??

**simplyterific** (7): I still can’t believe that she got a Macy Gray feature

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (7): WHEN U WALK OUT THAT DOOR.... DON'T U COME BACK NO MORE

**TheQwertyGuy99** (7): Macy's on a different song

**wailord\_fan** (7): a grower, but I'm sorry, Macy's voice doesn't do a THING for me.

**wasian-invasion** (7): its not bad just not interesting

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.9): thinking about how people called this a bathroom break during the tour

**1998tweety** (6.5): I do not care for ha but she grew a bit

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.1): I love Macy but this sounds like the blues-rock adjacent song that previews a new "gritty lady detective starts her life in a new town" TNT show or some random True Blood revival

**cremeebrulee** (6): never did anything for me personally but they both sound great

**duochromepalmtree** (6): I am really realizing I just don’t love this album especially compared to everything she’s done afterwards!

**IIIHenryIII** (6): These backing vocals are fire! It’s definitely not bad

**runaway3212** (6): I just really hate Macy Gray here

**stryxen** (6): good song 👍

**thedoctordances1940** (6): eh, not the most interesting

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Not really feeling it… think Ari needed a few more years on her before she could pull off something like this

**avg-vag** (5): pairing ariana with macy was a misstep because she’s delivering soul ariana isn’t capable of matching. another song that would sound so much better with a different artist.

**flibbityflob** (5): Ariana's good, I really don't like Macy Gray's voice. And frankly, it's just a boring song.

**frogaranaman** (5): I mean it is a song

**SmileAndTears** (5): Idk this doesn't do anything for me

**welcometoNY** (4.7): another terrible collab choice. their voices simply do not mesh and aside from that, it's completely forgettable.

**2dina3dworld** (4.5): when this started and the featured vocalist started singing I was so confused, I thought I’d queued up something else.

**bespectacIed** (4): a bore

**gelastic\_quince84** (4): this is gonna sound SUPER shallow but I just find it really creepy for some reason. Just the sound of it and the feature is kinda scary? Idk

**joeeswift** (2): I like this album for the catchy hooks and earworms so this one never really left an impression on me

**modulum83** (0): L + ratio + youngboy better

queenmeme2: I didn’t do this rate but as someone who loves EMOTION, is indifferent on 1989, and dislikes Dangerous Woman this is so pleasing lol
