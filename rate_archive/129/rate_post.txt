The Original Rate (5th Anniversary Platinum Version)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/p3n9rj/the_original_rate_5th_anniversary_platinum_version/

# August 13th, 2016.

Fifth Harmony still has five members, Justin Bieber still has comparatively normal hair, and Olivia Rodrigo is still starring in *Bizaardvark* alongside Jake Paul. "Closer" by The Chainsmokers has just debuted at #9 on the Hot 100. "Lush Life" by Zara Larsson currently sits at #75, and we're all just waiting for her to be the next big pop girl. In terms of albums, more tracks from Britney Spears's upcoming album, *Glory*, have just dropped, Frank Ocean's *Blonde* is on the cusp of release, and *Emotion Side B* is about a week away from being announced. And over on a little community called /r/popheads, boasting just a bit more than 10,000 subscribers, we're having the times of our lives, with plug.dj parties, Top 10 Pop 10 countdowns, and general discussions where already people are oversharing about their relationship issues.

After a random discussion in the plug.dj about which Carly album tracks are better than others, I decide to introduce [a new activity called a rate](https://redd.it/4xmic6), which I shamelessly stole from ATRL and Popjustice. The idea is simple: A group of people all listen to a group of songs, to which they assign numbers, and then the tracks are later revealed in the order of their averages. A straightforward concept, but if the last five years have proved anything, it's that these events always turn out much more chaotically than you'd expect.

I chose these three albums in the original rate because I considered them to be the favorite pop album of each of the previous three years (2014 - 2016). Admittedly, the fact that the albums were all by white women making dancepop is an unfortunate representation of the limits this subreddit did and still does hold when it comes to recognizing and appreciating what pop music can be. Regardless, these albums are still keystone elements when it comes not just to the foundations of this subreddit, but to what pop music sounded like throughout the mid-2010s. 

And so here we are again, rating these three albums against each other for no real reason other than we like celebrating anniversaries, and I guess because the userbase has completely changed since then. I'm somehow still here (and even the founder /u/kappyko has miraculously managed to not delete his account), and I'm now joined by /u/rickikardashian and /u/ImADudeDuh, who are lovely previous hosts of lovely previous rates. They'll be helping out with stuff like gathering scores and doing the actual reveal now that ~~I have a job and a boyfriend~~ I don't have as much time on my hands as I did in 2016.

Anyway, it's time for what you really clicked on this thread for. Are you raters ready to rate, rate, rate, rate, rate?

## Taylor Swift — *1989*

In 2014, Taylor Swift became the face of pop music. Armed with producers ranging from the legendary Max Martin to the then up-and-coming Jack Antonoff, Taylor crafted an album that did away with any remaining country stylings and overlaid her trademark songwriting with a pop veneer. There were synths, there was a millennial whoop, there were mentions of "haters". Of course the album was a smash, selling a fucktillion copies around the world, churning out multiple #1 singles that dominated pop radio, and birthing a stadium tour that phalanxes of adoring fans flocked to. (My first ever concert was for this tour; no I don't regret it.)

If you considered yourself a Swiftie, you loved every second of it. If you didn't care for her, Taylor's sheer omnipresence in the pop zeitgeist was more nauseating than intoxicating, and as her celebrity status lurched further and further into the spotlight, the shadows it casted grew in turn. Sure, she proved she could pal around with girlboss friends ranging from Hailee Steinfeld to Haim, but her tussles and feuds with celebrities she didn't get along with also became public knowledge. It all came to a head after she won Album of the Year at the Grammy's and fantastically shit the bed not five minutes after. Some severe backlash followed, which in hindsight was overblown and just tiring. All of that mess hurt her chances when we did this rate originally — will we be able to look at this album with a clearer lens this time around?

Yes, we're rating both versions of "Bad Blood". Just be glad that she ended up not releasing *1989 (Taylor's Version)* and that we're spared from rating a dozen vault tracks and "Shake It Off (Taylor's Version) [The Blessed Elvira Yule Log Remix] <feat. someone in boygenius> {from *The 'I Just Dummied Your Wedding Porta-Potty' Chapter*} — 69¢ on iTunes".

## Carly Rae Jepsen — *Emotion*

For what was supposed to be Carly's big commercial comeback, *Emotion* turned out to instead be the moment where she established her core fanbase: the terminally online. After the lead single underperformed despite a very heavy push on every format imaginable, Carly pivoted and instead began courting the critics, who gave her music — layered and intricate and sharply written all while being unashamedly '80s-inspired dancepop — the recognition it deserved. This acclaim trickled down, and soon the "Call Me Maybe" girl had a vast array of forum homosexuals to call her fanbase. This album might have been the curtain call on Carly's mainstream appeal, but it was also the foundation of her becoming an established creative force in pop music.

It bears repeating that this subreddit literally would not exist had people not needed an outlet to discuss the merits of this album (/r/indieheads wouldn't allow it, and it's not like we were going to flock to /r/music or something). Its lead track won the rate the first go around, and came very close to winning our first ever [Winners Rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/a0a23j/the_popheads_winners_rate_day_3_rolling_in_the_10s/eagbni7/). Our subscriber count has grown exponentially since then, however, and I wouldn't consider its victory here a foregone conclusion.

## Ariana Grande — *Dangerous Woman*

It's strange to position this album in Ariana's discography. Sonically, it wavers between the pop and R&B stylings that usually dominate her albums, resulting in perhaps her least cohesive body of work — it's scattered from trap to orchestra pizzicato plucking to intense, synth-driven bops. I don't think we had fully figured this out when we first rated it — "Side to Side" hadn't even been released as a single when the rate first started — but now that we've had the proper time to digest the album, I do think the years have been kind to it. Despite its unevenness, it remains a fun and captivating listen, a discography highlight that showcases her range as a pop artist.

It's equally strange to position this album in Ariana's overall life and growth as an artist. It came before the terrible tragedies that informed her later work, but also after her big breakout hits that carried her early years. If anything, its main purpose was to prove to the world that, as a pop star, she was here to stay, regardless of whatever it would throw her way.

##Bonus Tracks

Just for funsies, we've thrown in a collection of corporate bullshit that these three artists released around these album eras. Are any of these tracks even good? That's for you to decide! Reminder: Rating these songs is completely optional, meaning you can rate as many or as few as you'd like. You also can't use your 11 or your 0 on these.

I did my best to find YouTube links that weren't geoblocked (but even then there were some oddities, like how Carly's official audios [are available everywhere except for her home country???](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/866157056367788082/874835107121356801/Screen_Shot_2021-08-10_at_7.02.05_PM.png?width=2160&height=1163)). You should use the playlists anyway, which are linked at the bottom of this post.

Scores should be sent to /u/5thAnniversaryRate, an account the three of us are sharing. If you want to change your scores, change comments, ask anything, call /u/ImADudeDuh smelly, or whatever else, feel free to PM that account. Use the pre-made message link at the bottom of this post to send your scores in. We'll accept scores until at least **September 22nd**!

#Rules

* You must rate every single song here for your scores to be accepted. The program used to calculate everything will not accept your ballot if you are missing a score. Use the pre-made message link at the bottom of this post to send your scores in.
* Keep in mind that your scores are not confidential! Every single number you assign to every song here will be revealed for the world to see!
* **Don't be a dumbass, and don't troll**. We can accept scores that demonstrate atrocious taste, but we reserve the right to reject your ballot if we think your primary motivation is to fuck up the results or to tank a particular album.
* Assign a score to each song between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine, so long as they are to one decimal place (i.e. 5.4 is fine, 5.42 is not). Also, please use periods (.) for the decimal places and not commas (,).
* You may give ONE song an 11 and ONE song a 0. This is one song TOTAL, *not* one song per album. Reserve these scores for your favorite and least favorite songs in the rate. These special scores are optional, and they cannot be used for the six bonus tracks.
* Feel free to change your scores at any time up to the due date! Just shoot /u/5thAnniversaryRate a PM detailing what you'd like to adjust.
* If you would like to add a comment to your scores, the correct way to format them can be found below:

> Thinking Bout You: 8 Why is Ariana arching her back in a dedication to her grandpa?

* To add a comment to an album, add a colon and format the line as follows:

> Album: 1989: I love disco music!

* Don't add a comma between the score or your comment, don't put your comment in parentheses, and don't add line breaks to it. Also, don't write some malicious headassery in your comment or we'll just delete it and judge you.
