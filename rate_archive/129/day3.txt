TiltControls: Unfortunately I'm gonna miss the back half of the rate & the rate cycle reveal trailer today due to probably needing to actually show up in person for my own birthday so the stats might not be up until very late tonight, but I'll post some of the notable records going into day 3 for now!

* Bad Blood is on the leaderboard for songs with most zeroes acquired in 8th with 24

* Carly now becomes the artist we've rated the 2nd most number of songs from (with 102; moved up from 6th)

*  Ariana also moves up from 13th to 8th (with 83)

* Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj break a 5-way tie and become the 2 artists that have appeared in the most rates at 18 each

*  Ariana gets another appearance which moves her into the old lead tie group with 17 rates

11's and zeroes are likely to still stand to change for today but for now...

* Taylor now has more than twice the number of 0's under her name compared to 2nd place (301 0's vs. Halsey's 129)

*  Ariana picks up enough 0's from the first two days to push her from outside the top ten all the way into 4th (She has 101 now)

* Taylor also still has too much of a lead for 11's for anyone to catch her (372), but Carly (currently in 3rd with 215) might be able to catch Gaga (2nd with 248)

*  Ariana (originally in 6th) got enough 11's in the first two days to surpass Charli in 5th and might also be able to catch up to Lana in 4th depending on how today plays out (173 vs. 184)

Artist averages also will likely wait except for:

* Kendrick unfortunately didn't score anywhere near enough to keep his place in the top ten (he would've needed about a 6.8 on Bad Blood Remix for that) and drops to 11th place on the overall rankings

And for the rates...

* The rerate is now the 5th most participated rate for the sub!

I'll be watching the thread since I'm definitely excited to see how the final day plays out, but the hosts have been killing it in the beatsense reveal so please don't miss out there if you can make it!!! And also early congrats to anyone who has their rate selected for next cycle since I'll be missing that too!

**letsallpoo** (10): There are some days where I am convinced this is her best song. It's assembled so delicately, building up bit by bit — first a wispy ad lib, then more intricate percussion, then additional synthwork, and in the end it just erupts with harmonies and emphasized vocals and just pure bliss. It's like you're in this vacuous auditorium with Carly right next to you, steadily breathing color and light until the entire room is enveloped in bright prismatic rays. There's nothing on this album that performs this gradation nearly as well as this song, and in a just society this would have made it even further in the rate. Also this song reminds me of my boyfriend (yes, I have a boyfriend, I just wanted to make that clear — I have a boyfriend). [*ImADudeDuh Note:* Fuck you]

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I’m not typically one to complain about repetition in pop music, but this song is more repetitive than I Really Like You. It’s a very catchy repetition and the chorus is fun, but damn its a lot of “gimmie love”s in this song. Also, who tf spells it “gimmie” and not “gimme?”

---

**wasian-invasion** (11): I was struggling to decide on an 11 on this rate, so I listened to my top contenders after taking an edible. And jesus, I could feel myself transcending on this one

**1998tweety** (10): I'm levitating

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The best song on this album, sorry I don’t make the rules.

**akanewasright** (10): Is this song perfect? Maybe not, but I love it as if it was

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): , one of my favorites oof the album

**Awkward\_King** (10): cause i want what i want but with you its what i need

**bespectacIed** (10): Flawless

**bulforster** (10): This was stuck in my head for almost a week the first time I heard it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This song gets me all emotional oml

**frogaranaman** (10): on my "songs that make me feel like drowning" playlist

**hunnybee12** (10): i could cry this song is so good

**IIIHenryIII** (10): This is my second favorite Carly song. It was a strong contender for my 11, and I feel extremely horrible for not giving it

**jimmy345960** (10): NOW this is where the album picks up baby.

**juanolsen** (10): I'm clingy

**ManofOranges** (10): This was and still is one of my favorite tracks on the album. The way it just builds and builds and builds and you start off with just Carly singing and then by the end you've got the "ooh"s going on in the background and the harmonies. UGH! It's just SO GOOD.

**mudkip1** (10): bop

**nootnoot781** (10): i thought gimme was correct so if carly says gimmie then- oh i just realised as i’m typing this that spellcheck only recognises gimme. maybe carly is wrong :(

**slimboyfriend** (10): Listening to this song's progression is euphoric

**sssaaage** (10): the chorus is so yassing

**static\_int\_husp** (10): me when I'm yearning (which is too often)

**throwaway7650** (10): the 2nd verse is pure excellence (the chorus is great too)

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): that bass line is soooo good

**twistedpython** (10): This song was revolutionary to my ears. I can't really describe it, but it changed things for me emotionally after I first heard it

**vayyiqra** (10): I love the bridge to this song. I know I keep saying this, but this wholesome feeling is why I love this album so much. Also, it just bops.

**waluigiest** (10): the peaks and valleys of this song give me life (*love)

**welcometoNY** (10): she literally invented post-choruses with this song

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.8): the bridge slaps so hard

**jasannn** (9.5): The part after the first chorus is lowkey a dab moment.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): the way this song builds and explodes like YESSSSS

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): look ABBA defined that it's spelt "Gimme" idk how you fucked that up Carly

**2dina3dworld** (9): this song is Joji’s Gimme Loves good twin

**bigbigbee** (9): The melodic structure of this song’s chorus reminds me of Ed Sheeran’s Thinking Out Loud. That sounds like a dig, but joke’s on you! I actually like that song! (Anyway everything else about this song doesn’t remind of it, and is excellent on its own.)

**buddhacharm** (9): minus one point because the “ie” in “Gimmie” has thrown me off for years

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I always wished that this had gotten a music video a la [“Come Into My World”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63vqob-MljQ) of Carly dancing down a street at night

**jaztinax** (9): this is underrated. or is it? i have no insights into the CRJ fandom

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): god Carly makes falling in love sound so great! Wonder what that's like haha ha h a 🙃

**runaway3212** (9): gimmie love too!

**wavingwolves** (8.7): this is the pleading face emoji in song form (non derogatory)

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.5): I can't stand the production on this. It's like anti-ASMR, the bassline and drums just feel unpleasant to my skull. It's more of a personal issue than a problem with the song, though, so I'm trying to ignore it.

**austrosinitic** (8): I've always thought that this is...one of the least remarkable Emotion songs, which just speaks to the entire album's quality if you take into account how catchy it is? It comes after another song with a really repetitive hook and while it's better crafted, I think it's on equal footing with I Really Like You since the latter is more memorable. They're two twins and they're not the best in the family but you can't say that they break the lineage.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): a good song with ‘gimme’ in the title

**gelastic\_quince84** (8): the verses and pre-chorus on this . . . yes please

**KennyEarthman** (8): what's this song called again

**Roxieloxie** (8): I think i just really love how yellable the chorus is of this

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (8): I think the thing with this album in general is that the songs sound so good, but the lyrics are a little too simplistic and this is the perfect exaple of that.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I love the production but the chorus is a tad bit lazy, just needed a bit more from Carly

**seanderlust** (7.7): we're yearning in the club today

**avg-vag** (7.5): another unimaginative chorus lyrically but the production amplifies it

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): basic. but good.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): I guess my quarrel with this song is that some of the production is just a little bit overdone but it is still a massive bop

**duochromepalmtree** (7): the hook is just really weak for me tbh but I LOVE the melody in the verses so so so much. If only that clunky chorus wasn’t there!!!!! (This song also sounds extremely dated at this point)

**endcreditouilles** (7): who let her spell gimme like this

**modulum83** (7): all this needed was a killer chorus to be perfect but alas

**SmileAndTears** (7): very gay

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I hate the phrase “gimmie touch” so fucking much I wanna give this song a zero for that alone… but no, I’ll show some restraint

**flibbityflob** (6.7): Incredible chorus, but I just don't really care for the verses.

**simplyterific** (6.5): outsold ed sheeran

**bluepupz** (6): The chorus is a little too repetitive for me, but the beat is great and keeps me from getting too bored with the song.

**plastichaxan** (6): she can do way better i’m sorry

**jman457** (5.8): Sucks because the production on this is so good, but the lyrics and chorus are a bit trite.

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (4): not a fan of the vocals and the chorus is boring

**ImADudeDuh** (11): This is my favorite Emotion song and the best song in the rate. I just love everything about this song. Carly plays “yeah... but i love him!” girl perfectly, and there’s just enough Sia in this that it’s only the good parts and I don’t remember that she released golden globe nominee Music this year. The whole song’s groove makes me want to go to a rollerskate rink on D̵̪̩͋i̶̫͒ş̷̄͜c̷̫̿̉o̸̙̒͝ night and have the time of my life with a boy i’ll dump by the end of the night. If this were released in 2020, it would be a gen z tiktok anthem, I swear.

**letsallpoo** (4): I'm sorry single people, but this is easily the weakest track on the album for me. Carly's cutesy wutesy talk-sing voice quickly grates on me, and the whole "boyz suck!" thing is surely #relatable but not terribly interesting. To its credit, there is some clever stuff here: The way it's set up as a conversation between Carly and her friends provides a realistic and interesting framework, and Sia's spoken-word intro is a nice touch. (Yes, Sia cowrote this as well; to date I think Carly is the only person to sing a Sia track and not sound like she's trying to emulate Sia on it.) But that's not much to latch on; for an album that explores the different dimensions of the emotions that come in tandem with love, the straightforwardness of this one just comes across as shallow and a little dumb.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Love an LGDP bop [3]

**2dina3dworld** (10): boys aren’t real

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Why is this gonna be a first day out

**bespectacIed** (10): so good. Carly, who is the most unambiguously heterosexual lyricist of all time knew how to stimulate the gay psyche

**bulforster** (10): bop!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): like 85% of the participants in this rate carly

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Sia recorded her speaking parts of the song from Beyonce's basement.

**duochromepalmtree** (10): okay this one was almost my eleven honestly. It’s just so much freaking fun.

**fallenriot** (10): iconic

**hikkaru** (10): bop problems

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): I wish I could rock that Boy Problems pink hat, but as a forty plus heterosexual man, it seems like a bad idea

**J\_Toe** (10): yass the bass yass boys yass danceable bop! that chorus is killer

**jasannn** (10): I relate to this song but from the friend's perspective. I would be so annoyed with Carly.

**ManofOranges** (10): Yet another bop, what else is new? We've all been there, we've all had boy problems. And the way Carly realizes she's been being a bad friend by having boy problems and dumping them on her friend, omg character development or whatever! We could learn something from this.

**modulum83** (10): absolutely fucking SMOKES Run Away With Me and singlehandedly rescales the rest of the album. funktronica is almost as blessed of a genre as hip house

**RandomHypnotica** (10): fuck men

**ReallyCreative** (10): do they still count as boy problems if the boy causing the problems is me? we love self-sabotage

**static\_int\_husp** (10): me in 2017 when I first heard this (straight, cis guy) - "can't relate". me in 2021 hearing this (bi, trans girl) "oh god I realte so hard"

**throwaway7650** (10): so infectious! this massively grew on me - I saw the light

**vayyiqra** (10): This song's a bop and also kind of funny - I have a friend who used to be like this. :eyes: Don't we all?

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): A cute song that I like to listen to when I think my love life is more dramatic than it actually is!

**wavingwolves** (10): this is fun and i like fun so i like this

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.7): the i think i broke up with my bf part has made me hate this song to weirdly love it

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): fuck u sia

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Na-na-na-na-na

**just\_thonking** (9.5): maybe Sia deserves some rights

**seanderlust** (9.5): not sia telling carly she's tired of hearing about carly's problems...alexa play bad friend

**sssaaage** (9.5): bop

**twistedpython** (9.5): Catchy little number but I've played this so many times that I have every single level of the harmonies memorized and that takes it down a half point. Would be a nine even except I too have boy problems and the song is very relatable that way

**cremeebrulee** (9.3): this could never be me, like please tell me all the boy gossip in your life

**austrosinitic** (9): The phone call at the beginning of this song says it all, and the rest of it is pretty much not just a nudge or encouragement, but outright a sonic celebration of the fruits of relieving yourself of your silly frustrations and anxieties — in this case, men. It's one of those masterpieces that's really just nothing except hook after hook all stitched together and that really does wonders for making you forget about Carly's boyfriend, too, which is amazing, considering the fact that you've never even met him, and even more amazing for me, too, considering the fact that I am a lesbian (it's more complicated than that but I am just saying this to be funny).

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): we are going to pretend that wasn't sia in the intro

**cyborglilith** (9): ptsd

**frogaranaman** (9): I too wish I had double trouble with boy problems, Carly

**Roxieloxie** (9): What i dub 'the last night' aka my last friday out before covid ruined all, this song came on in this indie theater while i was with a group of friends seeing the rocky horror picture and i started dancing a bit in line while the cashier at the concession stand told me how much they loved this song and how they saw carly live when they performed

**stryxen** (9): no cos literally

**waluigiest** (9): maybe the most Emotion song on Emotion

**flibbityflob** (8.8): I listen to this song and momentarily I become heterosexual. CRJ transcends.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.7): it's uwu ok

**avg-vag** (8.5): this has no right being this fun

**bluepupz** (8.5): It's so funky and groovy, I love it! Also I relate so hard to the friend in the song whose advice keeps on getting ignored lol. Sometimes you gotta just shrug and move on because people don't want to listen.

**buddhacharm** (8.5): Sia reporting live from Beyonce’s underground cellar

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.5): Male Issues. Masculine Predicaments. He/Him Snafus.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): carly's friends are sick of her shit

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): , fine

**anothertown** (8): I feel like it should have been either this or IRLY that stayed

**GARjuna** (8): so funky!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I won’t lie, this song does make me lose my mind, but I’ve always placed it a little bit below the most of the other *Emotion* songs. It’s fluffy fun but there’s no substance to the melody or production, plus the lyrics are kinda sketchy when you actually listen to them.

**jman457** (8): Groovy little track, with a fun message

**thedoctordances1940** (8): a fillery bop

**akanewasright** (7.9): The song is good but I overplayed it hard when this album first came out ~~and Sia’s voicemail is no longer as cool as it once was~~

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): don’t relate queen but so true!!

**plastichaxan** (7.5): this is a very cute bop but her voice is a bit... (a word for grating that doesn't sound as harsh)

**jimmy345960** (7): i always wanna get to the next songs so i usually skip but its fun

**runaway3212** (7): stupid but fun

**simplyterific** (7): it’s very disney channel star’s first single

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6.5): tag yourself I'm Carly's friend telling her to dump her shitty boyfriend

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): gay

**gelastic\_quince84** (6): I'm not gonna entirely sure why I don’t like this song? I guess the random “I broke up with my boyfriend”’s in the chorus just bothers me

**KennyEarthman** (6): Sia when Beyoncé keeps complaining about Jay-Z

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): I feel the same way about this song that many feel towards I Really Like You: it's too childlish and meme-y.

**vintagebathingsuit** (6): i just can't get into this song. the production is amazing, her voice is just so nasally

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): its fun but drags alot at the end

**GapeCod** (4): This peaks with Sia's intro tbh.

**CarlieScion** (3): bimbo rae jepsen

**companion\_star55** (2): worst on the album IMO

**welcometoNY** (1): i'm completely baffled by this being such a favorite because it sticks out to me as being the most immature and unimaginative song on the record. this is thematically so trite and the delivery is annoying, particulary the "i've got EE-em" too in the chorus which is vile

**letsallpoo** (10): Every time I hear this song, I envision Ariana furiously gesturing to her vagene as the chorus sets in, with every cry of "touch it" being accompanied by a light smack. Like with "Thinking Bout You," Ariana makes a sex song that's oddly somber and moody, but "Touch It" isn't afraid to rev it up when the chorus sets in, with a serrated synth that adds a fritty texture to her featherlight voice. It's fittingly intense, and even if Ariana herself hates it, I'm glad someone forced her to release it.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): It’s got some good harmonies with herself, but is it me, or does the production sound shoddy compared to the rest of the album? Like it’s really holding the song back. I have not heard the Final Fantasy version, but Square Enix, it’s up to you to fix this ariana song.

---

**anothertown** (11): The best song in any of these 3 girls' discographies. And that's that!

**Vromega** (11): Perfection. Sex is cool but have you ever listened to the last minute of Touch It

**yusrak** (11): INJECT THOSE HIGH NOTES INTO MY VEINS

**1998tweety** (10): Ascending

**2dina3dworld** (10): Ariana when she sees us giving this song high scores: *angery*

**AHSWeeknd** (10): She wants me to touch a donut?? DURING A PANDEMIC???

**akanewasright** (10): This song is… fucking incredible.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): , Ms. Ariana (probably) has some questionable tastes for saying this is boring.

**astrologicalangel** (10): this was very nearly my 11

**Awkward\_King** (10): :0

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this is amazing, Ariana is tasteless

**bespectacIed** (10): Ariana's pop songs are so perfectly manufactured, it's sickening both in a good and bad way. No shits, no gimmicks, just frigid, calculated pop... give me a hundred more of those

**cyborglilith** (10): ok this is epic

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Thinking about how the instrumental really went off with this one. And Ariana's vocals in this? *chef's kiss*

**frogaranaman** (10): girl just cum already

**GapeCod** (10): That lil' dingly thing that swing in the back of my throat.

**gelastic\_quince84** (10): pop perfection, my second favorite song on the album. Explosive like Into You, sexy, kinda sad in the beginning? Chefs kiss.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): This is definitely more of a Max Martin track than an Ariana track, and it is basically gentrified stadium trap, but it's one of the best things Max has ever done. The sidechained kick drums, the trance supersaws in the background of the chorus, the layers upon layers of backing vocals, it's all immaculate. It does need a *little* something extra to turn into perfection, though, maybe a whistle note or some beefier snare drums in the final chorus.

**hikkaru** (10): i just thought it was one of the best produced songs i'd ever heard

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Ok why wasn't this a single? I would definitely give this my 11 if Carly and Taylor weren't in this rate. I think I've just found my new favorite Ariana song. Damn I don’t know how to express how this song has blown my mind

**jimmy345960** (10): An iconic song that ari has no reason to dislike.

**KennyEarthman** (10): I wish this got as much attention as Into You tbh

**leaffan34** (10): how tf is touch it boring ariana what

**Leixander** (10): this is how ariana and mariah may still sing this song together sometime live, in this essay i will

**ManofOranges** (10): Even though I've never felt another man's touch before, this song gives what I imagine to be the same orgasmic feeling.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is into you's hot older sister

**nootnoot781** (10): ariana is so tasteless for not liking this, 2nd best on the album

**plastichaxan** (10): as much as i love her and like a lot of her music, there are very few times in my life where i've been surprised by ariana and this is one of them lol

**poppinmmolly** (10): I love this song and I know she and others thinks it's boring but it's NOT

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): The Reloaded mix is such a pleasure to listen to.

**rosecult** (10): a bop

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): every time I hear this, I go into a zone!!

**seanderlust** (10): REALLY interesting instrumentals on this one. this might be my favorite discovery of the rate

**specialtrickholdA** (10): The ending stretch of this album (Touch It through to Thinking Bout You) is one of the best three track runs in pop music.

**sssaaage** (10): was really close to getting my 11

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (10): ahhhhh the whistle notes how can she think this is boring

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): is it time to admit this is better than into you? i think we should have that conversation

**throwaway7650** (10): at least ariana followed up bad decisions with a good one (and then proceeds to have terrible taste with finding this boring, FUCK ARIANA!). my other 11 contender for this album along with into you, it's on par tbh

**twistedpython** (10): Ariana hates it but I don't care

**vayyiqra** (10): The tracklist of this album is a mess with its many versions but the one we're rating at least could have ended on this excellent song.

**wailord\_fan** (10): SERVE

**simplyterific** (9.7): now THAT’S what I call a bridge!

**jaztinax** (9.5): touch what?

**modulum83** (9.5): this is just into you but way better?

**davgonp** (9.4): This song makes me feel like Ariana Grande with her ponytail

**wavingwolves** (9.1): love the fart noises

**bluepupz** (9): I quite like her singing and vocal layering here. The background music lets her voice shine, and the bridge is nice too.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I love this song and vocally she’s amazing here but it is a tad not as exciting as other songs

**just\_thonking** (9): bop

**ReallyCreative** (9): there are a couple moments in the production that keep this from really ascending, but this song is definitely appropriately hyped

**slimboyfriend** (9): ...touch what?

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): Look, it's a good song, great even, but I'm gonna need you to stop saying it's the best song ever

**austrosinitic** (8.5): I’m not as big of a fan of the second half of Dangerous Woman as I am the first because I think it’s too flooded with pop songs when Ariana’s attempts at RnB are more consistent (to say nothing of Into You, of course). This is the best track on the second half that I can think of that is still obviously pop, but defies that judgement of mine. I’m not really good at analyzing such production-focused music, but the production really intensifies the intimacy of this song, which makes it stand out more compared to some of its more forgettable predecessors.

**jman457** (8.4): I get Homogenic Vibes

**apatel27** (8): that initial buildup into chorus is pure sex but song goes on a little too long

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): doesn't ariana hate this song? could not be me

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): It’s okay

**waluigiest** (8): the beat? so fat.

**wasian-invasion** (8): please let me touch it mommy :pleading-bottom-face:

**flibbityflob** (7.8): I like it. The chorus especially sounds SO good, the drumbeats and synths swelling end up sounding fantastic.

**fallenriot** (7): the production on this is sick

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (7): This is like Into You but not as good, sort of pointless

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): This isn’t bad but tbh Ari is right, of the songs on the album this one has aged the worst and I don’t blame her for not wanting to sing it anymore. It’s also way noisier than I remember now that I’m really paying attention?

**welcometoNY** (6.5): ariana had a point when she said this was boring. there's a lot they could have done with the whistle tones and they decided to do absolutely none of it, leaving a song with some impressive vocals and literally nothing else.

ImADudeDuh: **Alumineous** (6): This feels so manufactured and "perfect". Don't get me wrong, the production is good and of course, the bitch sang. I was hooked the first listen. But I think that's more due to Max Martin. Ariana just did her thing, as usual. It just feels lifeless and boring, you know?

**CarlieScion** (6): why do the gaze hype this up so bad

**CrimsonROSET** (6): you @ grass

**endcreditouilles** (6): no thanks

**Osaka1268** (6): tho final fantasy remix is god tier

**TiltControls** (6): wish the production were a little less overpowering here

**hunnybee12** (5): there's so much happening that it becomes boring.. took me a few years to realize but ariana you were right !

**runaway3212** (4): This is just into you but at least it's not as overhyped

**thedoctordances1940** (4): production-wise it has some of the same flaws as everyday but it's not nearly as bad as that and still has a catchy melody at least

**bulforster** (3.7): Ari is right, this song is boring and she sounds bored singing it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3.2): oh no no. this VERY tacky sounding EDM song. i feel like it was tacky in 2016? no ma'am. And this "touch it" chorus? The prelude to "getitgetitgeithitithithit" or whatever.

**stryxen** (2): it’s not awful but it really is forgettable and just not good

**companion\_star55** (0): idk why but this song always felt underwhelming to me. I remember when everyone was hyping this up and i was just...bored? not surprised it was cut from the standard version tbh. sorry to its fans :/

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (0): yeah, i still do not like this. the production is too busy and the way ari sings 'touch it' is off-putting to me for some reason

**ImADudeDuh** (10): God fucking dammit Carly. How could you make such a personal attack on my single ass’s love for wasting time driving and not caring about where to go?

**letsallpoo** (6): This always just felt like RAWM but without the bombast and with the whole "let's run off together and get lost in the city" vibe being made way too literal. I guess it's good if you want a chiller take on escapism, but I can't ever think of an instance where I would've preferred that take instead. The sentiment at its core is still infectious and cutesy, but it doesn't really do much that RAWM doesn't do better. Even the sax solo isn't as good!

**Brendon-Urine** (10): seeing her live was great, RAWM was out of this world, but this is the song that made me ascend. like float through the ceiling of the venue. the saxophones and the way she harmonizes on the last chorus gah DAMN

**CarlieScion** (10): im going on an ADVENTURE

**cashewconstellation** (10): This song is joy in its purest form and I adore it

**duochromepalmtree** (10): this song is so SWEET and just perfectly encapsulates the feeling of starting to really fall for someone new.

**hikkaru** (10): the sax omfg.

**jasannn** (10): Shoutout to my queen Seohyun from SNSD for posting about this song and forcing me to give this song another chance. This has turned into one of my tracks off the album solely because of her.

**just\_thonking** (10): literally so close to getting my 11, this better not be robbed

**ManofOranges** (10): Another 10, add it to the list. Carly somehow perfectly encapsulates the feeling of... well, wanting to get lost with someone. Like I can feel it in the lyrics, in the vocal delivery, in the production, in my bones!! Even though I've never gotten the chance to be alone in a car with someone that I really like, I think this song serves as a great substitute.

**modulum83** (10): blessed saxophone

**musical\_pyn** (10): there isn't a single element here that does not work, everything is just perfect.

**nootnoot781** (10): 2nd best song the album. it’s true!

**Square\_Preparation55** (10): any song with a saxophone intro or outro is an automatic 10

**sssaaage** (10): amazing perfection excellence

**stryxen** (10): no cos literally

**TheQwertyGuy99** (10): This song is underrated. Feels like a movie scene. It's very similar to RAWM but different enough that it doesn't feel like a repeat.

**TiltControls** (10): you know what, yeah. fuck maps! and gps's! and directions!

**waluigiest** (10): this was the soundtrack to my first almost requited love

**austrosinitic** (9.5): This is the greatest theme song to an 80s sitcom that never was. And it sounds like that for a damn reason; what is a theme song meant to be if not a musical representation of a journey that's endless, always recurring throughout the seasons? Is Let's Get Lost about anything other than type of escapism, now redirected towards a real love interest instead of some stupid TV show? How much more powerful and how much more comforting is it then? I'm not even going to get into the saxophone. It practically forms a trilogy along with the ones from Love on Top and Edge of Glory, and that's saying something considering this song is nowhere near as popular. (I wrote this comment before Run Away With Me's and am just realizing how stupid I was to say this so I'll just say it's the Frankie to the Jonas Brothers of those three songs).

**buddhacharm** (9.5): in a rate filled with soaring choruses, I think this song stands out as a necessary moment of respite. CRJ knows how to write simple yet effective songs, and this is my favorite example of that

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): me every time I get in my car

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): Even Carly knows how great this deep cut is because she performed it on the Dedicated tour

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Ten bucks says she made this directly after watching some Audrey Hepburn movie

**Awkward\_King** (9): i love the idea behind this song, the idea of getting lost with someone just to spend more time with them. men.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): *kicks down the door* IS THAT A SAXOPHONE I HEAR?

**bulforster** (9): It's just a bit unfortunate it's on an album with a much more iconic sax part.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): on bluray

**GapeCod** (9): IPR ballots with an under 8 Manners average:

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Years ago someone said in a thread that they thought that Carly should have thrown some jingle bells into this and made a holiday version and I’ve never stopped thinking about that.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Yoooooooooooou

**jsonphile** (9): I’m a sucker for some sweet sax

**lambeosaura** (9): the sax!!!! listen to it in a car late at night as the city lights pass you be, for added effect

**vayyiqra** (9): Can we get some appreciation for the instrumental tracks on this album? Because the guitar and horns on this are impeccable. What a bop.

**welcometoNY** (9): y'all are gonna hate me for this but this is giving what run away with me thought it was giving

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): this song feels like eating shaved ice on the beach at sunset

**jaztinax** (8.5): groovy baby

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Pretty gay

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): another banger

**throwaway7650** (8.5): kind of an inferior RAWM but still very cute! the deflating noises at the end are hilarious. maybe I do want to... run away with her

**1998tweety** (8): Girl you ever been lost before? That shit ain't fun

**anothertown** (8): so smooth and atmospheric, just suffers from an unimaginative bridge that totally sinks the momentum of the song

**bluepupz** (8): Is that another sax I hear in the background? That instantly makes the song better, and it's already pretty good. What's going on in the last few seconds though?

**fallenriot** (8): i thought she was saying “i like that you’re a dragon soul” for the longest time

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is cute

**KennyEarthman** (8): needs more sax

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): definitely a hidden gem, can't say I've paid much attention to this before but it's a bop!

**mudkip1** (8): i love how the noise at the very end of this song is the same sound used in Kanye West - Wolves

**runaway3212** (8): I prefer staying found

**thedoctordances1940** (8): i feel like i just wanna comment bop for every song on this album but that's just what they all are and this is no exception

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): the little saxophone flourishes are great

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): not bad, but not too much that stands out other than the sax

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.2): I want to like this more than I do.

**seanderlust** (7.2): shoutout to whoever was playing the saxophone on this album. really adds something great to the atmosphere

**flibbityflob** (7.1): Another total bop, but it just doesn't Do It for me. Loses points for whatever the fuck is going on with the ending

**wavingwolves** (7.1): do you ever listen to a song and think "god i wish i felt like this about someone"? that shit hurts. this bangs though

**apatel27** (7): RAWM lite

**gelastic\_quince84** (7): Is this an innuendo? A bop, but nothing amazing compared to the other songs.

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (7): It's pretty fillery to me idk. Goes in one ear and out the other.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Like the rest of the album it sounds great, but the lyrics here are some of the most generic on Emotion...

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): I swear I heard a children’s choir :terror:

**twistedpython** (6.5): I've never liked the production

**frogaranaman** (6): I think the new Tyler, The Creator album was about this song

**J\_Toe** (6): is the first 8 seconds a sample? I swear i used to hear it all the time in a coffee ads but I doubt CRJ is getting that coffee ad coin

**jman457** (5.3): I mean it's well made, but kind of boring

**leaffan34** (5): kinda boring

**letsallpoo** (8): And the last Sia collaboration is OUT! As well as the first and last HAIM collaboration! Imagining all five of them in the same studio, writing this song, is a bit of a trip, and definitely not something I could envision happening again. But they blessed us with this strange little track, so at least a nice gem came out of that madness.

A number of comments bring up how awkward Carly's use of the word "hijack" is in this song, but I've always considered that to be the point. The song glides in smoothly, but once the chorus kicks in, it all goes awray — their relationship is going off the rails, and the song reflects that. She's literally hijacking it, and the bumpiness that word brings is all part of it. It's interesting to hear Carly be the provocateur for once, and the song never loses its cheeriness in spite of the chaos.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): [the official audio video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC9aceFjhd4) of this song is kinda serving generic desktop background. Just the idea of this song is so adorable. Trying to cheer up a sad friend by doing everything you know they love is such a wholesome premise for a pop song. My only problem with the song is that it feels overproduced and sloppily made at some points, but it’s still full of fun.

---

**plastichaxan** (11): this is the first carly song i fell in love with, it means so much to me and it hasn’t changed to this day

**2dina3dworld** (10): this whole song comes off as a threat from a woman who’s got me tied up in her basement but it still bops

**bespectacIed** (10): pop perfection

**Brendon-Urine** (10): Huge fan of Sia's songwriting, it comes through strong here

**CarlieScion** (10): bops SO hard

**cashewconstellation** (10): Mysterious, hypnotic and perfect

**cherryices** (10): there is something hilarious about sweet carly rae jepsen singing about hijacking somebody

**duochromepalmtree** (10): this song is really great but it is extremely repetitive. But I like some of the unique sounds she used here. It creates a sort of spooky atmosphere which I’m all here for.

**HogwartsReject1912** (10): Best song on EMOTION tbh

**hunnybee12** (10): tyler oakley once tweeted this was his favorite song and it ruined it for me for years but now i'm grown and not a petty brat and love it. white gays can be correct (sometimes)

**jackisboredtoday** (10): the ableist did admittedly snap when writing this one

**joeeswift** (10): so glad im doing this rate because this song is amazing and for some reason, I never saved it from my first listen of emotion??

**jsonphile** (10): underappreciated bop. One of Carly’s best songs

**Leixander** (10): hijack me carly, you could force me to listen to your 1000+ unfinished demos and i would ask for more

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): makes me want to run away with my crush in the middle of the night

**ManofOranges** (10): This song just goes absolutely ALL OUT. I love it. This song makes the four previous songs sound so subdued in comparison. It just takes you there! And by the last chorus it's just soooo good. Like when she yells "Hey!" at the end omg. I also have no clue what the fuck she means when she says she's here to "hijack you" or whatever but I would let Carly hijack me in a second so <3

**moooo566** (10): if i had a 10.9 to give it would go here

**musical\_pyn** (10): I know like four words of the chorus besides the title and this is still one of the best songs I've ever heard

**nootnoot781** (10): I LOVE THIS ALBUM SO MUCH

**ReallyCreative** (10): the fact that HAIM wrote this, a cultural moment

**shhhneak** (10): Carly was singing like her life, career, and mental health depended on it.

**sssaaage** (10): the chorus slays so bad

**throwaway7650** (10): probably the best deep cut on the standard version of emotion and 1/3 11 contenders for me on it. the prechorus/bridge leading exploding into the chorus - I'm living. hope it makes the top 10 again!

**tinyleapsoffaith19** (10): hijack me pls

**wailord\_fan** (10): when I say perfection, you say Making the Most of the Night

**avg-vag** (9.5): what a ride, i fully enjoyed that. before this rate i really didn’t like this song, but i don’t think i had ever truly listened to it in full in hindsight. maybe a 10 if i give it more time.

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): "I know you've had a rough time, but here I come to hijack you" carly coming for halsey's gig

**wavingwolves** (9.3): do you ever listen to a song and think "god i wish someone felt this way about me"? that shit hurts. this bangs though

**1998tweety** (9): Big bop but repetitive

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Only Ava Max can deliver this sort of dramatic energy these days

**akanewasright** (9): I overplayed this song hard, but it’s still… really cool and electric and magical

**anothertown** (9): It makes perfect sense that this is, in part, a Sia and Haim cowrite. The mix is just so fucked though

**austrosinitic** (9): Maybe you're just a bad actor. As I would expect from any Sia song, Making the Most of the Night relies on a structure that's centered around adapting pop music into an epic in only three or four minutes — and it's a fine structure, because therein lies the hype of listening to songs like these, but it's also a method that's not exempt from the danger of pop falling into predictability after a handful of listens. This one in particular isn't really revolutionary enough to completely escape that pitfall, which is a little disappointing since that's what Emotion as an album is famed for doing, but like the rest of Emotion it's executed sublimely enough for the chills you get hearing Carly declaring her intention to hijack to never completely wear off. Music as dramatic like this can be a bit like the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet at times — a little too ubiquitous, but artistically stunning all the same.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): making the most of the night am i right fellas???? I’m gonna stay home and rank pop songs against each other

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Betty Who has a song called [“You Can Cry Tomorrow”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7mIK4fqZf0) that’s basically the exact same song as this, just wanted to mention that ~~since Carly stole the acclaim and career that Betty was owed for her album *Take Me When You Go* which did the longing ‘80s revival pop perfection thing a year before *Emotion* came out~~

**ignitethephoenix** (9): okay I love this song but yeah it completely aggressive for no reason at all 💀

**IIIHenryIII** (9): This song sounds so dark and whimsical. It used to be my favorite

**thedoctordances1940** (9): one of the more underrated songs on the album imo

**twistedpython** (9): Frenetic and hectic when on any sort of substance, but when sober this is a nice song

**vayyiqra** (9): Someone pointed out the wording "hijack" is kind of funny here but whatever - this is still a very good song. Also, it shows that Sia, whatever her many other faults, has a lot of songwriting talent in her.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.8): Kinda an asshole move for Carly to get a writing credit on this considering that Sia's demo sounds identical. Great track, though!

**modulum83** (8.8): the spotify mix of this song is trying to gaslight me but it's okay because the song itself is amazing

**jasannn** (8.5): The prechorus to end all prechoruses.

**jaztinax** (8.5): i love this song but the use of the word “hijack” is very unsettling

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): this song is a journey from start to finish and it's a fun one

**seanderlust** (8.2): there's something interesting about the harmonies and notes on the chorus. someone better at music theory than me help me out here. or don't and i'll be content to just know it's a bop

**buddhacharm** (8): this is pre-hyperpop hyperpop

**frogaranaman** (8): me after starting my drinking for the evening at 10PM and needing to catch up with my friends who started at 7PM

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Love that chord progression in the chorus

**runaway3212** (8): could literally never be me

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (8): what a banger

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This song is so fun and puts me in a dancing mood, and then I hear the word “hijack” and I’m just like “...huh??”

**waluigiest** (8): this is hyperpop

**wasian-invasion** (8): the chorus feels a little cluttered, completely seizes control of the song's energy like a vehicle or something. There's probably a better word for that…

**flibbityflob** (7.8): This song makes me dance around the house in a way that can only be described as extremely slutty. The pre-chorus is so good it makes me angry.

**bulforster** (7.7): There's a bit too much crammed in here musically but I suppose the title kind of explains it.

**leaffan34** (7.5): was not expecting that chorus wow

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): again, alot of these songs start off and im like 'eh' but god i just wanna start running outside my house and scream the chorus

**welcometoNY** (7.5): the chorus really holds this back but it's immaculate otherwise

**bluepupz** (7): From a listening perspective, I don't love how the word "hijack" sounds when she repeats it a million times in the chorus. This has great build up with the drums.

**gelastic\_quince84** (7): It’s a banger, but didn’t really stand out to me ig

**J\_Toe** (7): Hi Sia! I just saw Sia girl

**KennyEarthman** (7): hijackyouhijackyou

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (7): This is the song that reminds me of 1989 the most. It kinda sounds similar to I Wish You Would and the imagery is something Taylor Swift would use as well.

**jman457** (6.7): Is she is saying she is gonna “hijack me” Halsey is shook

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): the chorus of this song felt very frantic, and it feels in tune with the song but i never vibed with it too hard.

**apatel27** (6): a bit too long

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): for whatever reason the vocals on this song are panned to the side and tbh it really ruins the song

**SmileAndTears** (5.5): sounds like an anime opening (derogatory)

Run Away With Me, Into You, Greedy, Emotion, Style, Your Type, Blank Space, Boy Problems, Making the Most of the Night, Let’s Get Lost

6 too many Carly songs, Style and Blank Space for Taylor and Into You and Greedy for Ariana.

5 years later, shit ain't changed a bit for Ariana, but the turntables as Taylor now has HALF of the Top 10 with two good songs along with New Romantics, Clean and Blank Space. Carly is down to RAWM, Emotion and Your Type.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): man fuck full house, and SERIOUSLY fuck Fuller House.

**letsallpoo** (5): Carly's a great muse for this song, but like...it's the theme to *Fuller House*, a Netflix reboot of a mediocre 90s show. It's cheery, but almost nauseatingly so, and a white person reminiscing about the good ol' days is not ever going to sit right with me.

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): improved on the original, unlike what John Stamos did to the Beach Boys

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Outsold John Stamos, or whoever sang the original one

**Brendon-Urine** (10): WHY DOES THIS GO SO HARD???

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): true story, according to lastfm I have scrobbled this song more than four hundred times

**ManofOranges** (10): Giving this a 10 because it absolutely sends me that this exists.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.8): so good tbh

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): never watched full house or fuller house but the theme song is great

**slimboyfriend** (8.8): She knows ho cheesy this is and she's loving it!

**shhhneak** (8.5): She kinda ate this I hope she gets residuals for life.

**GARjuna** (8): this is fun

**PointlessBibliophage** (8): why does this kinda bop

**poppinmmolly** (8): I actually really liked this cover

**TheQwertyGuy99** (8): Never seen Full or Fuller House before but this is a theme song bop. I've still not listened to the full original song but Carly's voice really fits on this.

**twistedpython** (8): A shame the show isn't very good but this rendition of a childhood classic is very nice

**waluigiest** (8): okay but her voice! She bodied this too!

**duochromepalmtree** (7.5): I have never heard this but wow she absolutely killed it and her voice sounds amazing.

**throwaway7650** (7.5): carly coming for the soccer mom demographic IKTR... when she starts acting omg

**jman457** (7.3): I hate full house with a passion but it's kind of a bop

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , not that big of a fan of the show.

**avg-vag** (7): as a genuine full/fuller house fan, this works

**fallenriot** (7): well its a theme song, good for what it is but i don't listen to it regularly

**KennyEarthman** (7): it's a good opening and nothing more

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): this is certainly a song that exists

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I watched a lot of *Full House* as a kid… couldn’t tell you anything about it.

**jasannn** (6): I can't believe Full House was my favorite show when I was in Middle school in the early 2010's.

**jsonphile** (6): I mean it’s not like the original theme was that great

**just\_thonking** (6): let's sort this whole thing out tease

**RandomHypnotica** (6): i have never seen an episode of full or fuller house

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): i've never watched this show so i have no attachment to this, but i guess not terrible

**frogaranaman** (5): yeah it's a song

**IIIHenryIII** (5): It doesn't have the appeal of the original, which is a lot of fun

**Roxieloxie** (5): god this haunted every netflix ad for the longest time

**TiltControls** (5): Everywhere you look (there's a hem)

**wasian-invasion** (5): im too young for this to score any nostalgia points with me

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU, OUGHTA KNOW

**anothertown** (3): this is godless

**modulum83** (3): it seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on tv but where are those good old family values on which we used to r

**simplyterific** (3): I’m more of a Family Matters girl

**vayyiqra** (3): Sorry Carly, the original recording of this song is a bop and this version is much worse, and it's just bizarre to hear her singing it. I want to like this, but I do not.

**wailord\_fan** (3): Hollywood make original tv shows challenge

**flibbityflob** (2.1): Better than Last Christmas, still terrible. I'm English and so I have no love or affection for Full House.

**apatel27** (2): It's clearly designed to be a jingle.

**akanewasright** (1): I fucking hated this show. My little brother would watch it obsessively for the month after each season would drop and that is the one time I have been upset to hear Carly’s voice.

**mudkip1** (1): bop

**welcometoNY** (1): this is worse than let's be friends

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): This is also a very beautifully produced song. I feel like the song eventually gets to be too much by the end, and I’ve never been a fan of the ah-ah’s throughout the song, but the lyricism and the xylophone? vibraphone? marimba? Whatever it is, it’s a beautiful representation of the rain.

**letsallpoo** (8): Talk about a jump. "Clean" ties OOTW (acronym bot, activate!) for the biggest increase in the rate, vaulting 18 positions and raising its score by 1.5. This song was done wrong in the original rate, and I'm glad that it's getting its dues now.

"Clean" is the closing track of *1989*'s standard edition, and it provides a somber, pensive conclusion to the album. Compared to the other ballads, "Clean" has a tight lyrical metaphor that's utilized well, and a vague impression of a narrative that provides enough of a journey for the reader to undergo. The production is simple but effective, with that xylophone adding a crystalline texture to the song. Imogen Heap's influence certainly helped, but the song is quintissentially Taylor still.

---

**avg-vag** (11): a masterpiece. it's sonically immaculate and Imogen Heap’s vocals heal my trauma.

**duochromepalmtree** (11): breathtaking, haunting, healing, bone crushing, top three Taylor songs ever.

**HogwartsReject1912** (11): So gentle, so beautiful, so calming. Just pure perfection.

**stryxen** (11): no cos literally

**1998tweety** (10): Masterpiece

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The evermore stans are about to give this an eleven

**akanewasright** (10): I literally love the production on this song so much

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): , a great ending for the standard edition of the album.

**Alumineous** (10): It's a beautiful song that deserves a better singer. But I will admit, I have been shitting on Taylor's vocals this entire rate. And she'll never sing like Ariana. So, just as a pity score, I'll give this song a 10.

**Awkward\_King** (10): the shower in my flat is so dodgy wish this were me

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): best closer in the rate. good ballad too.

**bespectacIed** (10): Fave song on the album, thank u imogen heap. Little miss prim and proper can-do-no-wrong, likening a break-up to substance withdrawal and recovery? I might've stanned a lil bit

**CarlieScion** (10): [insert joke about Jake Gyllenhaal]

**GapeCod** (10): Mr Simple, Simple

**hikkaru** (10): :catcry: imogen snapped the boots down haus mawma with the production i love it sm

**IIIHenryIII** (10): All I have to say is that Taylor introduced me to Imogen Heap and I’m so grateful for that (I knew *Watcha Say* but had no idea it was a sample)

**lambeosaura** (10): Taylor really shines in these earnest confessional type of songs.

**ManofOranges** (10): One of the more laid back songs on the album but it's also one of the best. I know Imogen Heap worked on this one, and whatever she did, she worked her magic and made it so great. The production is great, the lyrics great, they really resonate. Even though I wouldn't say I've really been addicted to anything, I'd say I can still feel the simultaneous relief and wariness of finally getting something or someone out of your system. It's a very cathartic experience to listen to this and feel that.

**modulum83** (10): i'm a sucker for realistic and powerful depictions of trauma. don't read too deep into that.

**mudkip1** (10): we love imogen heap

**musical\_pyn** (10): I swear to god if we don't rate imogen heap next cycle I will submit the re-recordings for a future rate

**ReallyCreative** (10): Imogen Heap doing icon shit as usual

**rosecult** (10): so soothing, i love it

**runaway3212** (10): This song is so incredibly beautifull ugh

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Imogen Heap doesn’t miss

**seanderlust** (10): i love you imogen heap

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (10): perfection

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (10): Another song with gorgeous writing and still her best closer.

**throwaway7650** (10): 11 contender, the more minimalistic production works here and the lyrics are fantastic. (taylor's version) of this song is going to break me I fear

**TiltControls** (10): the best non-single on the album by far. If my 11 weren't in this rate, this song would take it easily

**tinyleapsoffaith19** (10): PERFECT album closer

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): great songwriting and Imogen's production is so good on this

**wailord\_fan** (10): a wonderful closer, probably her best closing track?

**waluigiest** (10): The best song on 1989 is actually an Imogen Heap song

**wavingwolves** (10): this song makes me so miserable it's like i'll never be happy and healed but it's such a YASSSSSSSS MAWMA SLAY DOWN THE BOOTS

**welcometoNY** (10): this is catharsis in audio form. the bridge has some of my favorite lyrics ever and the atmosphere created here with imogen's harmonies is so stunning and beautifully reminiscent of rain. favorite lyrics: the entire bridge

**yusrak** (10): All too well's first cousin

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): ,,,,,, I actually really like this

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I think this is the best B-side on 1989 by a big margin. It’s a wonderful marriage of instruments (is that a xylophone….?) and lyrical imagery that conveys its intended feeling really well, IMO.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): It really is just such a beautiful closer to quite a messy album

**twistedpython** (9.5): Wine gives me a headache and whenever I hear the wine lyric in this song I think about a headache so I have to dock it points for that

**austrosinitic** (9): The favourite closer of every Swiftie who’s ever had trauma (this was one of the songs I played on repeat when my dad went RIP earlier this year), Clean is nothing short of excellence and is a wonderful song to end this album on, as it would be for any album. It really just evokes the finale of a story full of pain so effectively through both its music and its words, which is more than I can say for how this album started, and while I’m not really attracted to drug metaphors I think the flood and rain imagery of this song is the reason why it succeeds (then again I am a Scorpio, although if astrology is real I should like the drug metaphor). Now you, too, can cry alone together with Taylor Swift! Wait, that’s an oxymoron.

**fallenriot** (9): i really wish she would work with imogen heap more

**gelastic\_quince84** (9): beautiful song about healing and moving on. I slept on it for so long, now I adore it.

**vayyiqra** (9): Maybe one of the lower-energy cuts on this otherwise rather upbeat album but it's very pretty. Normally don't like addiction metaphors but I still like this a lot.

**wasian-invasion** (9): what an understated yet cathartic song she gives me shivers

**jman457** (8.8): Glad she was able to be treated for chlamydia. Also move over Aphex Twins, Taylor Swift is the new Ambient Queen.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): this is far from Imogen's best work but it fits this track so well, it feels so... clean. And I *will* stan Imogen wherever possible

**bulforster** (8.7): I should listen to more of Imogen's music, this is some neat production.

**SmileAndTears** (8.7): Oh wow, the Imogen Heap song is the best song on the album, what a surprise, who would've thunk

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.5): A little high but Imogen Heap was the first artist I stanned so I'm always gonna be biased with her. She gets sampled so often for a reason: her production work is incredible.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): one of mg favorite deep cuts from the album

**bluepupz** (8): These lyrics are really lovely, and I think they can definitely apply to many things besides a romantic relationship. I can see why this is one of the fan favorites from the album!

**sssaaage** (8): a pleasant surprise in this nightmare of an album

**jasannn** (7.3): I know it's fan favorite but it really doesn't do much for me.

**cashewconstellation** (7.2): I used to love this song but it really aged for me. Just okay now.

ImADudeDuh: **darjeelingdarkroast** (7): this has a nice beat and good singing from Taylor.

**KennyEarthman** (7): Taylor and Imogen should work together more

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): objectively this song is pretty good but it just doesn't do much for me

**simplyterific** (7): it goes on a little long

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The production, especially the mbira, just sounds so childish to me, and I don’t mean that as an insult, I mean literally listening to this song reminds me of like a kids playroom with building blocks and toy xylophones… and I’m not sure if I like it?

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (6.5): talk about overrated taylor songs

**apatel27** (6): xylophone jingle bad

**flibbityflob** (6): It's so middle of the road. Boring album closer that's absolutely eclipsed by the near perfection of New Romantics as the closer for the deluxe edition

**buddhacharm** (5.5): I think the lyrical conceit is cute but it feels overproduced and rather overwrought as a whole, I think this song would really benefit from an acoustic reinterpretation on her (inevitable) re-release

**CrimsonROSET** (5): it’s a quarter after one, i’m all alone and i need you now

**Uberpigeon** (5): i hate love = drug metaphors

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): This isn’t the serve she thinks it is

**jaztinax** (4): sorry i hate this song so i think i was pretty nice to give it a 4

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3.5): It's honestly hard to give anything in this rate a zero but eh, rules are rules. In reality it's a 3.5 at most. [Host Note: Their score was changed after learning you don't have to give a 0]

**frogaranaman** (3): my biggest issue with this album is the production, honestly. this could have been a huge 'moment' of a song but the instrumental is so sterile that it stifles anything from happening. and it happens so much on this album

**plastichaxan** (2): i don’t get what everyone sees in this song i do not like one single thing about it but at least is not that annoying to me(?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): GREEDAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a fun song. It’s so energetic as well as being a great showcase of Ariana’s talents. There are parts of the song that feel like the instrumental is trying to march forward but Ariana starts to be lacking behind, and everytime she slingshots herself to the front of the song, until the final part where the key changes happen and both are at their fullest force. It’s honestly one of my favorite songs to lip sync to in my car, which yes gays, i understand that’s very ironic. Greedy’s fun is so infectious, that the only way I can see someone doesn’t catch it is if [they wear a mask!](https://www.losangelesblade.com/content/files/2017/07/Valentina_RuPauls_Drag_Race_Screenshot_460_by_470.jpg)

**letsallpoo** (10): In a better world, this would have been able to be released as a single, where it probably would've peaked at like #38 and gotten a music video filled with glamour shots and no plot. "Greedy" does deserve all of that and more, though, and it stands as one of Ariana's best bops still that fully takes advantage of her pipes. She coos, she belts, and she deftly changes keys, all while a medley of violins and drums keeps the tempo. Ariana never made a song quite like this ever again, and maybe its weirdness in the scope of the discography is responsible for this dropping a bit in ranks since the original rate. But it's still a bulletproof song that can stand with her best.

---

**Alumineous** (11): She fucking killed this song. Vocals, vocals, VOCALS. Those mixed chest voice belts are... UGH! They're so good. It makes the lyrics so redundant. I'm just here to hear her SANG. And she sounds like she's having a lot of fun. God-tier track.

**endcreditouilles** (11): the key change gets me absolutely soaked

**1998tweety** (10): Bop

**2dina3dworld** (10): when you’re rolling with popheads, you’re rocking with the best (help it’s 1984 in this sub)

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): bc that key change is one of my fav things in any pop song

**austrosinitic** (10): This was Popheads’ first single that got away; I still remember ‘when will Ariana release Greedy’ being a meme here and that in itself, I believe, proves how old I am. Of course, the gays will die for any key change (by the way, why is every single song with a key change good? I’ve never heard of a bad song with a key change before) but Greedy is consistent throughout, bringing a funk style to the table that happens to always result in a banger whenever we reintroduce it to modern music (see: Get Lucky, Uptown Funk). Would be perfect as a cabaret number.

**Awkward\_King** (10): u/supermodelruru if you're out there xx

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): KEY CHANGES

**bespectacIed** (10): Crack

**bluepupz** (10): Iconic Drag Race lipsync? Check. Iconic key change? Check. Official/promoted single from the album? :( All jokes aside, she keeps it interesting and fun throughout, and it's a great song!

**Brendon-Urine** (10): show stopping

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I love that this song didn't age one bit. Just iconic things.

**GapeCod** (10): 👁😷👁

**hunnybee12** (10): kang selugi marry me

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Valentina’s worse nightmare

**J\_Toe** (10): I will be honest: I am one of the people who only started listening to this song after the Valentina lip sync. I have no intention of pretending I was ahead of the curve here.

**jasannn** (10): A b-side so good that there are numerous kpop covers.

**jimmy345960** (10): uknowthatimgreedy4luv

**joeeswift** (10): the key changeeeee. EVERYBODY BETTER BE JUMPING

**jsonphile** (10): oh man this groove is incredible. And the key change??? Ohhhh yeah this does it for me

**lambeosaura** (10): Valentina is SHOOKETH

**ManofOranges** (10): I've always been a staunch Greedy disliker... or at least I was always of the opinion that it was not as good as everyone claimed it was. I never though it was bad, but the way everyone hyped it up all the time, I felt like it wasn't so deserving of all the hype. But everytime I listen to it, it's a different story. I do very much like this song. And while Into You is clearly superior... this song is very much a 10.

**nootnoot781** (10): valentina was ahead of her time

**Osaka1268** (10): something something valentina mask something something covid joke

**poppinmmolly** (10): THIS IS SO GOOD

**ReallyCreative** (10): everything about this song is STUPID fun

**rosecult** (10): takes off mask

**runaway3212** (10): Honestly this song isnt good but I don't want to only give everyday a 10 on this album and this one is fun and never really bad

**simplyterific** (10): the fact that money was spent for Everyday to have a video but not this masterpiece is the most homophobic thing I’ve experienced the past decade

**Square\_Preparation55** (10): the vocal layering on this track is amazing

**stryxen** (10): she must be greedy cos she ATE idk i've written too many comments

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (10): iconic key change, iconic song

**thedoctordances1940** (10): It's just an absolute bop, the key change is just :poohascend:

**twistedpython** (10): This not being released as a single still hurts my soul

**vayyiqra** (10): Hot take: this song is better than "Into You". No further analysis, it's just a goddamn bop.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Fun fact: Me and my college roommate would always get this song and Breathin mixed up… Imagine hearing her sing “BREATHIIIIIN WOO! You know that I’m breathin for yuh❤️”

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): another 11 contender. probably my second favourite ari song. the horns! the drama! the vocaalls

**Vromega** (10): This key change omg !! Pure joy, pure bop

**wailord\_fan** (10): go Valentina, give them redemption arc realness

**waluigiest** (10): here’s how Greedy can still be a single

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): this is one of the best songs of all time, argue with the wall

**moooo566** (9.6): it's less than a 10 but its more than a 9.5

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): Valentina, Covid clairvoyant and icon

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Queen of oversinging!

**jackisboredtoday** (9.5): I’d like to leave it on

**sssaaage** (9.3): overrated ass song [3]

**akanewasright** (9): I was convinced this was going to be a single when I first heard this album in 2016. It just seemed so perfect

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): , should've been a single.

**frogaranaman** (9): she really struck gold with this sound

**gelastic\_quince84** (9): I used to not like this song for some weird reason. Looovveee it now.

**jman457** (9): a great groovy little track

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): so groovy!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Should've been a single tbh.

**seanderlust** (9): the version with rupaul interrupting would have been in the bonus rate, but hearing someone asking someone else to take a mask off their face is upsetting this year so we're sticking with this one. which is okay because it's still a bop.

**TheQwertyGuy99** (9): One of her most underrated songs. The bridge is so greedy. I love how big the last verse goes.

**throwaway7650** (9): the grip this song has on korea... if I see ONE MORE dance cover...

**wasian-invasion** (9): i know that im cumming tonight after that key change

**duochromepalmtree** (7): silly & goofy mood

**fallenriot** (7): this sounds like it could’ve been on ava max’s heaven and hell album. take that however you will

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): 90% of the comments are gonna be about RPDR aren't they

**flibbityflob** (6.1): The mixing on this one's a little whack around the chorus, Ariana's voice gets muffled by the the sax and the guitar lines, and it's not my thing. The funky little guitar line at the breakdown is really fun, but it doesn't rescue it for me. Really don't like the key change in the final chorus, either.

**HogwartsReject1912** (6): I would give this an 8 but Valentina :( Wound's still fresh.

**Roxieloxie** (6): I cant unhear her yelling 'CREEPER' like she's about to go play minecraft

**anothertown** (5): it’s giving a bit of Kids Choice Awards

**specialtrickholdA** (5): This song is the root of this sub’s obsession with “disco” or what their idea of what disco sounds like (which this song is NOT), so I can’t really bring myself to enjoy it that much anymore.

**companion\_star55** (3): i have no idea why this was hyped. this is sooo...irritating

**AHSWeeknd** (1): Overrated AND only Ava Max can deliver this sort of dramatic energy these days

**cyborglilith** (0): it's trash

**welcometoNY** (0): i cannot fathom why anyone would enjoy this song, nevermind love it the way most people on here seem to. it's ridiculously unpleasant and grating to my ears without a single redeeming quality. the "cause i'm so" adlibs in a weird baby voice are one of the worst and most bizarre choices made in music in the past few years. this could maybe be partially forgiven if the song slapped, but instead there's no real melody to speak of, the production is essentially nonexistent, and of course the lyrics don't offer anything. very weird song, and not even in an interesting way.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): its like lana del rey’s music, but good. *turns off notifications*

**letsallpoo** (7): Ever since I read a review that said that the "he's so tall and handsome as hell!" prechorus sounds like she's reading a Tinder bio, I've been incapable of taking this song seriously. "Wildest Dreams" is over-the-top with its protrayl of this romance that for some reason can only be carried out in secret, but the song is mostly in on the joke, taking every single detail as far as it can. This is something that can only really happen in your wildest dreams; it's not meant to be a literal depiction of love, and the dreamlike instrumental ripped off of *Born to Die* ties into that perfectly. The bridge is also one of Taylor's best, churning the whole production as far as it can. It's all schtick, and while it's not schtick that I can fully buy into, I can acknowledge some good schtick.

Released after "Bad Blood" as the album's fifth single "Wildest Dreams" did decently enough, peaking at #5 on the Hot 100. It's lately become part of a TiKToK trend, and its Taylor's Version version is being used for some horse girl movie. If anything in that previous sentence excites you, then I'm happy for you.

---

**2dina3dworld** (11): it was between this and Style for my 11, but the “nothing lasts forever” and the “Burn. It. DOWN” make the panties drop in a way that Style just doesn’t.

**astrologicalangel** (11): beautiful

**ThatOneSaltyBoi** (11): this song is literally her best song and no one can convince me otherwise

**TiltControls** (11): I cannot get enough of this song. It's just such a relaxing listen and (against tough competition) may be my favourite Taylor Swift song. (Though I do prefer the radio version with the slightly more intense percussion). Also maybe it's overfamiliarization with this song but I am not really feeling the new version all that much : ( Still! This is an easy 11 and I hope it does well!

**tinyleapsoffaith19** (11): just gets better and better with every listen

**twistedpython** (11): I just know this song is gonna get dragged by pesky Lana fans (who should take note that despite the similarities, Wildest Dreams wipes the floor with Without You and literally everything else in Lana's cutesy discography), and it doesn't deserve any of it. Yes, the possibly colonial music video is a tad problematic, but the cinematography is gorgeous and Scott Eastwood is... easy on the eyes. The fact that her heartbeat is interpolated into the production is the only thing that keeps me going in this dark and dreary life. The orgasmic moaning in the chorus is the only thing that has ever caused me to question my sexuality. The fact that this song might be inspired by Taylor's little one night stand with Alexander Skarsgard (another man that is easy on the eyes) while they were filming The Giver is another reason that Wildest Dreams is just unparalleled in the Main Pop Girl Cinematic Universe. This song is better than anything your fave will ever even dream of making, sorry not sorry

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The best song Taylor Swift has ever made, I’m sorry, I don’t make the rules

**akanewasright** (10): This song makes me melt

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): such a pretty ballad

**bigbigbee** (10): When I go to hell, one of my first punishments will be being forced to listen to recordings of every time I sang along to this song

**bluepupz** (10): This is beautifully dreamy (heh) and atmospheric, especially in the choruses. Shoutout to the Taylor Swift bridge(TM), which is predictably my favorite part.

**CarlieScion** (10): the first proper sexy song she made, this is the spiritual follow up to Sparks Fly and Treacherous and for that we love it < 3

**cashewconstellation** (10): Wonderful song, very much lives up to its name

**duochromepalmtree** (10): I cannot quit this song. And it has one of my favorite Taylor swift bridges ever.

**fallenriot** (10): still annoyed that she gave us blue balls for the re-recorded version but whatever

**gelastic\_quince84** (10): mmhmm. So wistful and sexy. My absolute fav song when I was like 7, I remember singing it not he school bus everyday. Love it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of Taylor’s best songs, physically fight me if you disagree.

**hikkaru** (10): this song is about me bc i'm so tall and handsome as hell

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I miss those drums from the music video so bad on the original track. Why no one thought about including them before releasing the album? I want to hear them on the re-recorded version so bad. Please Taylor if you are reading this! I really hope you’re not

**J\_Toe** (10): so picturesque. I like the drums for the final chorus of the video more though (I know literally everybody is gonna say that, though)

**jimmy345960** (10): So much nostalgia. I had a gf for the first time when 1989 came out, I was also a freshman in college. So much chaos but college was fun.

**jsonphile** (10): one of the best Swift songs I said what I said. This might be one of the sexiest songs Taylor’s ever written

**lambeosaura** (10): enchanted/wildest dreams mashup official release when?

**ManofOranges** (10): I might be crazy but I feel like I remember people saying Taylor copied Lana when she made this song and I just think that's totally insane like??? I hear no mentions of cigarettes, sex, or the word "daddy" like hello???

**poppinmmolly** (10): this song is fantastic

**ReallyCreative** (10): the moment

**runaway3212** (10): Remember when Taylor randomly started making critically acclaimed music during this era

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this song fucks.

**stryxen** (10): aaaaaaaaaaaa

**thedoctordances1940** (10): it's just absolutely fucking gorgeous

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (10): This is the song along with Style that really delivers on the wish-fulfillment fantasy aspect of the album and I love it. No lyric is wasted, every line further expands on the doomned glamour.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): excellence! sparks so much nostalgia for me

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes this sounds like that Lana song. I don't think it was on purpose and besides that's a compliment, since I love *Born to Die* and both that album and *1989* excel at being cinematic, both in their lyrics and sound. This is one of the best songs on the album for that reason.

**wailord\_fan** (10): Dripping in Lana, like Stoned at the Nail Salon. Swifties stop going nuts over Taylor using her heartbeat on this track like it's some genius musical feat.

**waluigiest** (10): I love the horny energy she curates here.

**welcometoNY** (10): such a lush, dreamy, beautiful song with just the right amount of darkness. this is one of the best melodies that Taylor's ever written and also one of her best vocal performances. the contrasting of her lower register in the verses with her higher register in the chorus is so well-done and clever, and the "a-ah, ha" bits are so delicate and get me emotional despite not even being words. favorite lyrics: you'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night, burning it down

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): i cannot mentally seperate this from that fucking horse movie, this whole song just reeks of horse girl energy now

**Square\_Preparation55** (9.7): it is so generous of her to release Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version) early so that r/popheads could rate it before the ballots were due

**1998tweety** (9.5): I love Without You by LDR

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): glad I’m submitting after Taylor’s Version was released, it actually bumped up my score

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9.5): just such a pretty, dreamy song!

**throwaway7650** (9.5): she really released (taylor's version) for rate promo huh
[/r/popheads/comments/q5eg45/the_original_rate_5th_anniversary_platinum/hg5khwz/]

=====

ImADudeDuh: **aldwin\_is\_here** (9): , the only dream-pop song I've ever listened to and it would probably stay that way.

**Alumineous** (9): I can't believe I'm saying this, but her heartbeat as the underlying beat is kinda cool?

**austrosinitic** (9): I don’t really think Sparks Fly is a sex song so this is, in my mind, her first sex song. And I have never had sex, so I cannot comment on that. But this does Lana del Rey from a more cinematic perspective than what most of Lana’s depression anthems can offer unless we’re talking about indie cinema (Lana stans don’t come for me) and it’s as exhilarating as Taylor’s breath control, which is probably her best on this album. There’s a delicacy here that is, sadly, lost in the TV version; her vocals may have improved since but there’s no better median point between her younger voice and her deepier, raspier one than Wildest Dreams

**CrimsonROSET** (9): https://i.imgur.com/SjCg7j7.png

**seanderlust** (9): the tumblr post with "he's so tall and handsome as hell" text over pics of the spongebob episode where he takes pearl to the prom is stuck like a sticky note on my frontal lobe so i can't take this song seriously

**wasian-invasion** (9): colonialist queen <3

**avg-vag** (8.5): another epic chorus but i generally find this overrated across her discography

**modulum83** (8.5): i hated this song when i was a kid and now that i'm fully depressed and indie-poisoned i like it now

**simplyterific** (8.5): her breathiness in this is so pretty omg

**flibbityflob** (8.2): Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaan this song is so good, just. So so good. The bridge is absolutely iconic. I used to sing this song with female pronouns and still didn't realise I was a lesbian. Iconic. The bridge takes it from good to great.

**bulforster** (8): wish there was a bit more of a climax

**KennyEarthman** (8): omg is this the song from box office hit, Spirit Untamed?!?!

**superrcrazy** (8): I feel Lana's psychic resonance

**TheQwertyGuy99** (8): It has a very dreamy vibe, hence the title, but it manages not to sound out of place at all on the album.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Sampling your own heartbeat for a song is still kinda amazing, I’ll give her that

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.9): It's a very sweeping and romantic song.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.8): Yeah it's a dumbed down LDR ripoff, but maybe Lana should write more straightforward pop songs

**jman457** (7.7): As a longtime Lana stan, and Taylor Anti, I can't but help and hear Without You in this, but is a respectable Lana copy. TAS invented Baroque Pop

**plastichaxan** (7.7): it's kind of funny that people praise so much taylor for her lyrics but they are what is mostly holding back the songs for me

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): The music video version is a 9

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I don't quite see what everyone else does in this song, but that bridge makes me wanna stand on a seaside cliff in a lavender chiffon robe blowing in the wind on a cloudy evening as I await my love's return from sea

**SmileAndTears** (7.2): If it weren't for the lyrics, this would be pretty boring

**wavingwolves** (7.1): this is actually so incredibly overrated. the pre chorus lyrics are so awkward and the way she sings the chorus always sounded so unplesant to me. the bridge slays down though, i'll admit to that easily

**anothertown** (7): ok but this would be much improved if it was actually MORE Lana like, with a slower tempo and looser harmonies.

**frogaranaman** (7): why is this music video filmed in Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park

**GapeCod** (7): This really is a Born To Live, Laugh, Love song.

**musical\_pyn** (7): The chorus is great, but the bridge/final chorus doesn't build enough for my liking, it just kinda happens

**Leixander** (6): pre-chorus is atrocious

**static\_int\_husp** (6): This is like the platonic ideal of this album, which means it's lush and well produced, but it's still not actually good

**buddhacharm** (5.5): this song really is a beat-by-beat ripoff of Without You, thank god Lana is kinda inept because the lawsuit was there!

**bespectacIed** (5): Eh, this is a cute song. That white colonizer mv meanwhile... it was bad for her lmaooo. To her credit, I'm on her side on that plagiarism debacle, this never sounded like lana to me at all

**sssaaage** (4.5): like its cute but im pretty sure if i hadnt heard the 1989 singles so much when i was younger i would be tanking them even more

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): youre all horse ppl

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (2): i hate this song, i hate the sighing in the chorus. the bridge is ok.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): IDK why people were so surprised that this underperformed after Taylor had 5 hit singles that were already everywhere on the radio. Of course people would be burned out on Taylor. Also, its good but that mashup of it with I Really Like You by CRJ >>>>

**letsallpoo** (5): This is a nice enough bop that gets worse the closer you pay attention to the lyrics, which quickly turn into vaguely inspirational word salad. It's like she had a giant box of Hallmark cards that she rearranged to make them rhyme. I could find myself enjoying this on a day where my head has been sufficiently emptied, but today is not that day.

This song was originally released as a promotional single, along with the other *1989* bonus tracks. It was then released as the Okay Y'All This Is The Last One JK Here's One More single, where it eventually peaked at #48 on the Hot 100. Not bad for a *seventh* single with just tour footage as its music video!

---

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): I think I gave this song an 11 before in the original rate and I will give it my 11 again for this rate. Do I think this song would win in the rate? Nope. Do I think this song is better than Run Away with Me and Into You? Nope. But the reason why I gave this song an 11 is because New Romantics brought me back to such fun memories I had in 2014 - 2016 timeframe that I know I won't return to ever again. Among of all the songs in this rate, New Romantic brought me the most nostaglia so I am giving this song an 11 for sentimental reasons. And yes, I am definitely that Swifite who thinks Taylor should've released this as the lead single instead of Shake It Off.

**engie301** (11): queen

**flibbityflob** (11): Truly one of my favourite songs ever written. The way she hits the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-aaaa before that first chorus is just musical heaven for me, and the mixing and audio just sound SUBLIME. This song, more than any other on 1989, I'm waiting for Taylor's Version. I could probably gush about this song forever.

**Uberpigeon** (11): i love when she says aaaAAAA A AAAA!

**akanewasright** (10): why wasn’t this on the album etc etc

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): , you should've charted higher than #50s.

**allthesesongsforyou** (10): This should've been the lead single for the era

**Alumineous** (10): Thank you Terrace House for introducing me to this song.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): such a bop

**avg-vag** (10): the apathetic verses, the energetic choruses - it’s the perfect popheads cocktail. how this was a bonus track and not the lead single i will never understand. an 11 contender for me if not for the triumph of clean and i won’t be mad if this wins the rate.

**Awkward\_King** (10): euphoria

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): why wasn't this the lead single. why wasn't this on the album either

**Brendon-Urine** (10): BABYWERETHENEWROMANTICSCOMEONCOMEALONGWITHMEEEEEEEEEHEARTBREAKISTHENATIONALANTHEMWESINGITPRRRROUUUDLY

**bulforster** (10): Her best song!

**CarlieScion** (10): ‘the best people in life are free’ comrade Swift reporting for duty

**cashewconstellation** (10): Just as with many fan-favorites, I used to be VERY sceptical about this song, but damn, if it isn't the perfect song to represent the 1989 era and Taylor in general. I love it.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): a better political song than only the young

**duochromepalmtree** (10): Pop perfection nothing else to say

**endcreditouilles** (10): idk why but the "ah ah" vocals in the background remind me of Pikmin 2. anyway, it's a bop

**GapeCod** (10): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/236929075934003200/879647114408386571/emoji.gif

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is maybe my hottest take in the rate but I actually love the music video for this one and the song will always feel a little bit incomplete without the little speeches from Taylor, they really get me hyped. Like the bridge NEEDS that pause! Anyways I’ve been a bit snarkier with my comments for Taylor than I have for the other two artists in the rate but I do have to say that this song always puts a smile on my face and makes me wanna dance like an idiot. I know a lot of people have turned on Taylor in recent years (~~I know I have~~) but the *1989* era was such a MOMENT and it made so many people feel so happy and empowered and this song perfectly encapsulates that sensation of feeling young and free and swept up in the same wave of music and magic as everyone around you.

**hikkaru** (10): i think the first time i heard this song was when i first realized what happiness truly is. like instead of using ink to write this she took serotonin and put it in her pen bc holy SHIT

**hunnybee12** (10): this feels like the only honest song on the album

**J\_Toe** (10): i like the lyrical symmetry of New Romantics and Call it What You Want

**jasannn** (10): This song was the first time I felt euphoria from a song.

**jimmy345960** (10): this deserves all its praise and more

**jman457** (10): Taylor chose homophobia by not putting this on the standard version or giving it the true single treatment. Best on the album

**KennyEarthman** (10): deserved to be as overplayed as the other singles

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): a bop!

**ManofOranges** (10): Something something it's an absolute crime that this wasn't on the standard edition of the album. This is probably one of Taylor's best songs period. It's got a feeling of jubilation that outranks a lot of the songs on EMOTION, believe it or not. It's the kind of song that just gives you hope, even while the world is crumbling around you, that you can have a party and live life to its fullest anyway. It's the kind of song that really just makes me appreciate any moment of fun in my life.

**moooo566** (10): lowkey the best song on the album

**musical\_pyn** (10): The best taylor song? More likely than you think

**nootnoot781** (10): her best song by far. if not for RAWM, this would EASILY get my 11

**ReallyCreative** (10): her best track and a serious 11 contender

**runaway3212** (10): I literally watched the video for this so many times before her music was on streaming it still feels weird to hear this song without her little spoken interludes

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): such a smash! could have replaced several songs on the standard

**sssaaage** (10): actually such a bop why couldnt we get more songs the quality of this, style, and clean

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (10): brilliant closer but also could've been an amazing opener

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Yeah it's one of her best songs of all time, it's just an absolute bop and as much as I love Clean, this would've made more sense as the closer for the album imo.

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (10): One of the crowning jewels of this album and it's a damn shame it isn't on the standard edition. It finishes off the themes started at Welcome to New York perfectly.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): The Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-AHH is sooo infectious

**twistedpython** (10): The fact that this was NOT on the standard edition of the album, was not properly pushed as a single, and didn't get a real music video with budget is literally one of the most upsetting things about this era

**vayyiqra** (10): I like this song a lot, but never quite got why it was so hyped by fans - it's just one of many equally good songs on the album. I will agree it's better than a lot of the tracks on the standard album though, all of which are pretty good.

**welcometoNY** (10): any single couplet on this song would be enough to decimate most popstars' entire discographies. a tour-de-force of lyrical genius not lacking in sheer, unbridled *fun* and dripping in the type of sly sarcasm that only taylor could deliver, it's everything you could want in a pop song and more. favorite lyric: the rumours are terrible and cruel, but honey most of them are true

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): best song on the album, deserved far better

**bluepupz** (9): This is a superb synthpop track. I like the chorus in particular! It seems like there are a lot of Insta-quotable lines here.

**gelastic\_quince84** (9): insert “New Romantics should have been a single” thinkpiece

**TheQwertyGuy99** (9): Clean is a great subdued closer of the album but New Romantics is the dancepop closer the album deserves

**waluigiest** (9): THE BEST PEOPLE IN LIFE ARE FREEeeee

**anothertown** (8.5): Taylor who's us? Who is we?

**austrosinitic** (8.5): I never got why people thought this was the single that got away, since the melody just seems decent to me and since the lyrics are very Starbucks, although that’s probably why they think it would have succeeded. I think it works best as how it was released; a crowd anthem meant to commemorate the end of the era. It’s a song that doesn’t really work until you get people to adapt it as their own and sing along with it, and to be fair, it seems to have just done that. It even does that to me because of the verses; after all, everybody wants to be the outcast poet, the rejected artist (who’s actually a multi-millionaire living in New York).

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): why wasn’t this on the main album??

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I overlooked this anthem for so long. It’s still bottom 3 on this album, though. That doesn’t mean anything when the album is so perfect from start to finish

**simplyterific** (8.5): [dances around my bedroom]

**slimboyfriend** (8.4): Imagine the lead single was not Shake It Off...... but THIS

**poppinmmolly** (8): I don't love this like others do

**Roxieloxie** (8): yeah this kinda slaps

**yusrak** (8): Deserved more

**modulum83** (7.8): here the wall of sound actually works

**plastichaxan** (7.5): my average was way too close to being considered sabotage but then she put on a good song and saved me

**TiltControls** (7.5): it's a nice song, but I never got the intense love for it? the chorus is really fun, but the verses just kinda exist.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): nooo I wanted to like this song but this Scarlet Letter lyric?? From Taylor thee Lyricist?? The hook is AMAZING but this was at first a 5.5 so the chorus saved these awkward verses. and those "ANHH-AHH-AHHH-AHHHS" stoppp.

**fallenriot** (7): i overplayed this one so much that i usually skip it now lmao

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): man y’all just like this song cause it sounds like a mid-tier Carly track

**vintagebathingsuit** (7): this song is so noisy, lyrics are fun though

**wailord\_fan** (7): overrated. It deserved to be the 6th single compared to her other options.

**wasian-invasion** (7): i remember when she started pushing this like 2 years after shake it off and I thought she just sounded tired lol

**frogaranaman** (6): I always thought this sounded like "New Americana" but I might just be stupid

**GARjuna** (5): I do not like 'for the fans' songs

**SmileAndTears** (5): God I despise that sound in the prechorus

**2dina3dworld** (3): it’s kinda boring, that and I hate the way she rushes through the lyrics. I’m gonna get clowned for this but it should’ve been a ballad

**companion\_star55** (1.5): this is my first time hearing the 1989 bonus tracks....glad to know I wasn't missing out on anything

**shhhneak** (0): I despise this song with all my being. I would hear it a minimum 3 times a day working a nightmare service job and I wish it nothing but the worst.

MrSwearword: > I am definitely that Swifite who thinks Taylor should've released this as the lead single instead of Shake It Off.

It wouldn't be a rate with Taylor in it if there wasn't any "OMFG Taylor sucks at picking singles, why wasn't this lead/released/#1, etc." chatter about

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I mean, it’s a cover of Last Christmas. You'd have to really *try* to mess that up.

**letsallpoo** (7): I admit I do bop to this when winter sets in, but it's just one "Last Christmas" cover in a vast, concerningly white ocean of them. The fact that this ranked in this high despite voting happening in September and the song being thoroughly mediocre is probably just evidence of how bad these bonus tracks were.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Carly Rae Jepsen always nails Christmas songs

**apatel27** (10): top tier christmas song

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): this is the second best version of Last Christmas

**ManofOranges** (10): It's Last Christmas, I mean you can't really go wrong with it.

**moooo566** (10): perfect, flawless, ideal pop crossover, it's very bad luck to listen to christmas music outside december so fuck you

**waluigiest** (10): you can’t tell me she didn’t body this

**GapeCod** (9): Tinashe outsold.

**modulum83** (9): distilled nostalgia

**shhhneak** (9): It bops but it’s no Mittens.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**duochromepalmtree** (8): every person in the world has done a cover of this song but this is by far the best one. Sadly the song sucks. But I needed some Christmas so this one still gets a good rating from me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is cute but Ashley Tisdale low-key outsold

**jsonphile** (8): can’t believe I had to listen to a Christmas song in September, but it’s Carly so I’ll let it slide. Normally I don’t like covers of Last Christmas, the original is corny and only works because Wham is also corny as hell, but Carly manages to find the right amount of playfulness to make it work.

**musical\_pyn** (8): okay but the bonus rate should have just been this, taylor's cover, and ariana's cover

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): it’s alright

**just\_thonking** (7.5): carried by the sax tbh

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): i dont care for Christmas music but damn she's trying to lull me in with the sax

**seanderlust** (7.5): this is going on the christmas playlist yup yup

**akanewasright** (7): Allie X is the Canadian flop with the better Last Christmas cover

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , not that festive.

**bespectacIed** (7): something sweet for the kids

**IIIHenryIII** (7): It's ok

**jasannn** (7): yass more saxophones

**jaztinax** (7): why are you guys making me listen to christmas music in august

**KennyEarthman** (7): It's Not Christmas Till Somebody Cries outsold

**simplyterific** (7): oh there’s a sax in this

**throwaway7650** (7): it's no santa tell me but good 4 her

**vayyiqra** (7): It is the first day of fall and I am not in the mood for Christmas music to say the least, but this is cute.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): I really like her vocals on this but the little riffs in the background are just not doing it for me

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): Allie X outsold

**jman457** (6.4): I mean her voice suits this song really well, but it's also not an xmas classic by any standards

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): IT IS AUGUST, IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THIS SHIT [host note: *salt aiiiiiirrrrr*]

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): it's fine but the original is a classic and cannot be beaten

**thedoctordances1940** (6): i don't want to hear christmas music in august

**wasian-invasion** (6): not the worst christmas song she did

**frogaranaman** (5): sure

**GARjuna** (5): it's fine?

**TheQwertyGuy99** (5): The original song is obviously a 10. But as far as renditions of it go, this one's in the middle. Not great not terrible

**TiltControls** (5): this just makes me want to listen to the original

**twistedpython** (5): Fun and jazzy but I'm not a Christmas music person and I resent having to listen to this August

**welcometoNY** (4): non-mariah christmas songs are rarely good and this is no exception

**superrcrazy** (3): I love Carly but this is so shopping background music

**2dina3dworld** (2): I’m sorry but it’s like someone mashed up Run Away with me with the Wham! original and I don’t like either.

**flibbityflob** (2): Carly what the fuck is this

**mudkip1** (1): flop

**ReallyCreative** (1): sorry Carly you try your hardest but this song just sucks, Last Christmas needs to be retired

**ImADudeDuh** (8): alright, lmao. This is better than the original though.

**letsallpoo** (7): If you listened to the already-noisy "Touch It" and thought, "I want this to be even noiser! And attached to a mobile gacha game!" then you must've been very happy when this dropped. Ariana becoming a canonical Final Fantasy character is still weird to look back on, but even that is low on the list of strange things Scooter is capable of orchestrating.

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Yes.

**anothertown** (10): thank you Square Enix

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): Hey, I thought the video game vocal rate was over! (please laugh at my stupid joke)

**duochromepalmtree** (10): if I could give my eleven to this masterpiece I would!!!!

**fallenriot** (10): why does this exist

**GARjuna** (10): wish I could give this my 11. SO into the idea of beating up enemies in a jrpg to the tune of ariana singing about sex

**hikkaru** (10): gamer queen

**just\_thonking** (10): omg so grand(e)

**Leixander** (10): gamer queen

**ManofOranges** (10): PERFECTION

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): would honestly give this my 11 if it was part of the main rate

**modulum83** (10): hahaha holy shit what

**moooo566** (10): bop, more pop songs should have rad video game soundtrack instrumentals

**mudkip1** (10): bop

**musical\_pyn** (10): hi can I give a bonus rate song my 11

**Osaka1268** (10): I unironically want Ariana to do video game music like imagine fighting the final boss and when it reaches its final phase Ariana just starts belting

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): idk why this exists but i'm glad it's been brought to my attention cause this is GREAT lmao

**seanderlust** (10): legit can't pick which instrumental i like better. this is so big though. i love it

**shhhneak** (10): This score is an 11 in spirit.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): that fucking final fantasy mobile game really had no reason to make a remix that slaps this hard

**throwaway7650** (10): the winner

**twistedpython** (10): An improved version of an already perfect song

**wailord\_fan** (10): STRINGS

**waluigiest** (10): put ariana in smash

**jman457** (9.3): Improves the original, wish the mixing was cleaner though

**akanewasright** (9): still pretty damn incredible

**jsonphile** (9): wait this actually slaps so hard what

**RandomHypnotica** (9): i think there's moments here that are absolutely GORGEOUS, but the track kinda feels like it didn't build as well as it could have.

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): this could’ve been in the video game vocals rate, technically. Right?

**avg-vag** (8.5): i wish this was mixed better, the concept is amazing

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): gamer rights

**bespectacIed** (8): wow

**flibbityflob** (8): Above all else I am a Gamer(tm) so this appeals to me a great deal. I really liked Touch It, and I think I like this more. Only improvement would be the inclusion of the FF6 or FF7 victory theme leading into the song.

**frogaranaman** (8): when will Ariana Grande say "pog" in a song

**KennyEarthman** (8): the uwu adlib is really distracting here

**simplyterific** (8): yes

**jaztinax** (7.5): it sounded like i was going to love it but it didn’t get me as hyped as i wish it did

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , Promo.

**jasannn** (7): Nice but a bit cluttered.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): worth its existence for the very concept of the Ariana/Final Fantasy collab but the remix itself is just ok

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): It’s an interesting resin of the original but suffers from a lot of the same weaknesses

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (6): a little overdramatic

**J\_Toe** (6): i like the concept, but the execution is a bit too loud and the vocals and instrumentals compete.

**TheQwertyGuy99** (6): A worse version of Touch It but I can see it working better than the original as background music.

**TiltControls** (6): see other touch it comment but more \*magical\*

**vayyiqra** (6): Well, this somehow exists. It's okay.

**endcreditouilles** (5): the vocals sound so out of place with the production

**slimboyfriend** (5): As a gaymer/FF fan/Ariana fan....... um.

**thedoctordances1940** (5): it doesn't have the horrible wall of synths the original has so that's a plus but gamer music isn't much better

**ReallyCreative** (2): it's giving fever dream except actually fever nightmare

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Your Type is like a hopeful, melancholic sigh of a song. It’s very self defeating in the best way. She comes to terms with never being able to be in a relationship with the friend she loves, but at the same time says that she’s ready to climb him if he ever decides it could work out. Paired with glossy synths and an incredible chorus and post chorus, this would definitely be a great gay karaoke song if we ever get out of the pandemic.

**letsallpoo** (8): If RAWM is the epitome of the emotional highs of this album, "Your Type" is the polar opposite, a deep pit of despair that can trip you up on your path to love. Carly bemoans the hopelessness of her love, slowly coming to terms with its impossibility and acknowledging along the way that it wasn't because of something in particular that wedged them apart: She's just not the type of girl for him, and that they're destined to just remain friends at best. There's a lot of memes about how Carly sings about love from the perspective of a gay man, but it's on this song where that argument is the strongest; who here hasn't suffered from a straight crush before?

After being the fourth promotional single, "Your Type" was released as the third single from *Emotion*, a decision that would have been more exciting had Carly had a morsel of a prospect of charting well and if the song's music video didn't have almost a minute of pointless audio forced in at the beginning. It has only charted in Canada on random radio-related charts.

---

**cashewconstellation** (11): My favorite song of all time, it just can't be topped

**frogaranaman** (11): I am in desperate need of the sensual touch of another man

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (11): perfect friend zone anthem

**juanolsen** (11): relatable

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Love this. Hard driving, and dancable, yet you can feel the despair in lyrics, like she's on the verge of tears. Both beautiful and heartbreaking.

**vintagebathingsuit** (11): this is wayy better than RAWM, that huge explosive synthy chorus is pure serotonin

**1998tweety** (10): Love an LGDP bop [4]

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Depression

**apatel27** (10): 3rd best song

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): every gay person relates to this song at one point in their life

**bespectacIed** (10): GAYYYY. What a song, jeez. The awful memories. To all the straight guys I dedicated Your Type for -- a novel by Jenny Han

**bigbigbee** (10): She makes being rejected sound like so much fun

**CrimsonROSET** (10): https://i.imgur.com/aRsKjR0.png

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Carly stop dragging meee

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Robyn's Dancing on My Own and Your Type would totally be besties.

**ExtraEater** (10): The non-meme song I associate the most with old PH plug.dj

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Yes I’m gay. What is it about this particular type synth that just hits us right in the feels? “Dancing On My Own” and “Wrecking Ball” use somewhat similar sounds in our instrumentals, that rapid melancholy up and down electronic beep boop noise just triggers something primal within us I guess.

**hikkaru** (10): i don't pine for unavailable people ~~straight men~~ enough for this song to have the emotional impact it does for a lot of people. but it's still a fantastic song

**IIIHenryIII** (10): This is the most emotional track on the album, which is full of fun bops. So I'm all hear for that

**J\_Toe** (10): these lyrics cut deep

**jaztinax** (10): the drum fill leading to the chorus (chef’s kiss)

**jimmy345960** (10): I connected to this on a straight guy, it turned out great in the end, I didn't know it when I first rated it in 2016.

**jsonphile** (10): Carly I can call you more than a friend

**just\_thonking** (10): the song itself? 10/10. The memories I have associated with this song? 0/10.

**lambeosaura** (10): gave me so many flashbacks to my unrequited lovers… wow, I really was that dramatic huh

**Leixander** (10): the emotion in her voice on this song is just AAAAA

**musical\_pyn** (10): I don't know who needs to hear this but this is your sign that the straight boy you are crushing on does not and will not love you in the way you want him to

**plastichaxan** (10): every time i relate to a carly rae jepsen song i can only think about that tweet about how she truly captures what it is like to date for gays

**ReallyCreative** (10): gayest song on the face of the planet right after Sufjan's Predatory Wasp of the Palisades, pronouns be damned

**runaway3212** (10): IM NOT THE TYPE OF GIRL FOR YOU AND IM NOT GOING TO PRETENED THAT IM THE TYPE OF GIRL YOU CALL MORE THAN A FRIEND

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): things that are sapphic because I’ve decided so: this song

**seanderlust** (10): Recycling my redemption rate comment for this one: It's basically a song about the friendzone, but goddamn it is a jam.

**shhhneak** (10): Rent was due.

**SmileAndTears** (10): gay heartbreak in song form

**stryxen** (10): no cos literally

**superrcrazy** (10): I feel this song in my bones!

**thedoctordances1940** (10): such an insanely massive bop

**throwaway7650** (10): this and IRLY are the most sing-along-able for totally different reasons. IRLY is catchy and upbeat as hell while this song is also catchy but carly emotes such a longing feeling that I can't help but feel like I'm singing to an ex I never had... I still think about *that* story from the redemption rate

**TiltControls** (10): to think this was almost in winners 2

**twistedpython** (10): A pop masterpiece and it really deserves so much better from the listening audience. Also very relatable

**vayyiqra** (10): More than any song on *Emotion* this song is inseparable from its video I think, which is great - aesthetically it captures what the song sounds like perfectly. This is one of the best songs on the album.

**Vromega** (10): It hurts me to not give this a 11

**waluigiest** (10): this song is just so weighty - it’s emotional but the groove also has this gravitational pull. It’s so well done

**wasian-invasion** (10): I did karaoke for the first time in years this month and screaming along to this song in a room full of gays was worth the wait

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): Im pretty sure i cried over two different boys to this song its so overdramatic but so was i so oh well

**avg-vag** (9.5): any song that has so much fun while being so sad is always a win.

**CarlieScion** (9.5): a song for all the sad singles in this sub

**gelastic\_quince84** (9.5): finally a song on this album I can relate too lol. Love this one, also like how she isn’t bitter or mad that he doesn’t like her, she just says that she’ll always be there and stuff (better person than I am)

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9.5): this is so relatable it's actually painful, so I don't listen to it too often, but FUCK. Would be a ten but the first two lines of the second verse have always given me a kind of bitchy, not like the other girls vibe? Idk but it takes me out of the mood for a few seconds. Other than that it's outstanding

**bulforster** (9.4): There's so much desperation in those final "I'll make time for you"s

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): , oooh...

**duochromepalmtree** (9): I spent so much time listening to this song and thinking about a certain someone and then six months later I started dating my now husband. Still love this one.

**hunnybee12** (9): I'LL MAKE TIME TIME FOR YOUUUUU

**jasannn** (9): I haven't been in love (requited or unrequited) but I've watched enough K-dramas and experienced second-lead syndrome to relate.

**KennyEarthman** (9): the e•mo•tions on this track...

**slimboyfriend** (9): Really epitomizes her entire brand this era

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (9): This has all the CRJ tropes in it and it works beautifully. Her best song on unrequited love imo.

**wavingwolves** (9): alternative title: i fell in love with a straight person and made things weird between us by unintentionally showcasing that #SORRY

**welcometoNY** (9): another god-tier post-chorus on an infinitely relatable song. we stan.

**bluepupz** (8.5): This is really smooth and glossy. I like the way she sings the beginning of the pre-chorus, the rhythm makes it catchy.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): waiting for my moment where my heart will be broken by a man friendzoning me and then I can cry to this

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.5): *sad twerks in crush on straight best friend*

ImADudeDuh: **fallenriot** (8): this one hits one late-night drives

**modulum83** (8): i ain't reading all that i'm happy for u tho or sorry that happened

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): just a really solid pop song

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): God she sounds like she’s gonna break down and cry every time she gets to the chorus… It adds so much more depth to the song

**leaffan34** (7.8): sounds like something that fit on 1989

**jman457** (7.6): seems more like a 1989 song that I would like to admit

**sssaaage** (7.5): its cute

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): this is still a decent song, but it's not even top half on Emotion

**GapeCod** (6): Alvvays >>>

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (6): its fine

**flibbityflob** (5.9): Meh verses, absolutely banging chorus.

**anothertown** (5): yawn

**Awkward\_King** (0): god i hate how... droning this song is. lyrically i have never vibed with it, i think i have the same problem with it as i do normal girl by sza, where it feels very "not like the other girls". and even the interpretation that its actually carly singing abt the industry kinda doesnt redeem it for me. it feels like every word she's singing drags on for like a tenth of a second too long and i hate it.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (11): Taylor, as a lyricist, runs circles around Carly, and the latter's blankness in her lyrics and persona is one reason why she's never taken off as a pop star. Style (which this song structurally has a lot in common with) has more memorable turns of phrase and some of the best production of Max's career. But I'm a pop fan. I don't listen to music for the storytelling, I'm here for killer hooks I can sing along to in the shower. And in my opinion, Your Type has the best hooks in the rate.

**ManofOranges** (10): I was considering whether or not it would be cheesy or overdone or lazy or all of the above if I took the comment that I used for Your Type in the Redemption Rate (which I originally ripped from my comment on Hayley Kiyoko's song "Sleepover" in a rate before that one) and then just used it here again, but I've decided I'm going to include it here again. It's just so relevant to the way I experience this song (and honestly I think it's kinda fun to look back on at this point) and I think it's pretty obvious that other people have the same experience. When my life revolved around my straight high school crush, this song was how I coped, so I have no shame in leaving my long-ass story here once again, if for no one's enjoyment other than my own, so here goes: This song takes me back to the crush I had a few years ago on this guy who was in my anatomy and physiology class who was really hot and he and I used to talk all the time and we were always partners in partner activities and so I'd think that maybe he actually is gay but that he was just too afraid to tell me and that he was actually closeted or something I don't know. So we'd be partners in like a blood pressure activity and I'd have to take his blood pressure since he was my partner and I'd think "maybe this is the time that I ask him if he's ever streamed emotion by carly rae jepsen" but I felt like that was too on the nose so I didn't do it and I'd just focus on how big his arms were and how I kinda wished he'd choke me and then I'd remember where I was and ask him how to write blood pressure correctly even though I knew how to do it simply because I really just wanted to have any reason to talk to him. And then at one point we had a test about muscular system or something like that and I'd pretend like I'm gonna flop the test because I wanted to talk to him some more and then I'd get a 100 on it and he'd be like "you're smart" and I'd be like wow I think he wants to marry me and then I'd help him correct the questions he got wrong and hope that maybe during that time he'd tell me something really personal or ask me to prom or something, I don't know, and then nothing would happen. And then we'd come back to class another time and he'd drink a bottle of water and I'd feel like I'd have to drink a bottle of water too because imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Rinse and repeat for like 5 months and then it's the end of the semester and I realize that I'm never gonna have a class with him again because he just doesn't take the same classes I do and so I have a break down and one day I go home and I just can't take it anymore and I come out to a friend for the first time. So as one of my mechanisms for coping I went back to Emotion and remembered this song and for like a whole damn week I'd listen to this song and think "I'm not the type of girl for you" and "I love you I'm sorry I'm sorry I love you" and I'd try to get over him but then I'd go back the next day and there he was and sometimes he'd like stretch or something and I'd see a little bit of his stomach and I'd go right back to fawning over him because I really was desperate and a straight man's whore. And that would go on until the end of the semester and then I'd think, "oh well at least I won't have to see him anymore so maybe I'll get over him" but it turns out that he and I exited the school the same way so we'd actually just exit the school together and walk beside each other and talk and I knew I was fucked but I couldn't help it. And then whenever he wasn't at school or he didn't walk beside me at the end of the day I went home and listened to this song because I assumed he somehow figured out that I was into him and he never wanted to see me again but it's okay because I simply was not the type of guy for him. And that continued to the end of the year and all that time I was really thinking he'd still come out to me as if a white boy located in the southeastern united states and who played on the football team was actually gay--what was I thinking. And the year ended and once again I listened to Your Type and thought "at least I'll get over him because I won't be around him" but I legit dreamed about him sometimes and then I'd have to listen to this song or vent to my friend or something and eventually the beginning of the next school year came and I was like "okay that's it we're done I'm over him" and then I was exiting my chemistry class one day and I saw him and I purposely walked so we'd be walking together in the halls and it was at that moment that I knew I still wasn't over him. And I asked him if he was going to a school dance later that week and if he had a date because I was once again expecting him to say some really personal shit like that he was actually really wanting to ask me to go with him and was just too afraid to say so but then he was like "well I was gonna go but my parents don't like the girl I was gonna go with" and my heart broke into a million pieces and I went home and moped and knew that I shouldn't have fallen for a straight man but I just couldn't help it and then I listened to Your Type for like a 100 times on loop. Good times............ And this is normally where the comment would end, but it's not actually where the story ends. I did not get over this dude for a while. To put it into perspective, I started crushing on this guy in the first semester of my junior, and it lasted all through that year, through the summer that followed (I don't even know how exactly that was possible but I dreamt about him over the summer which was simultaneously torturous and amazing) and it even went into my senior year. Now during my senior year, I thought I'd be over him, but since I wasn't, I did a lot that was in my power to make sure to talk to him, say hi, etc. whenever possible (which wasn't often). And this went alright. I'd see him around, have a brief exchange, and then the hit of dopamine from that would keep me going for the next week or so. Standard stuff. Until one day I see him in the library. I walk up and say hi. He looks up at me with this look that, in my mind, I could only process as some kind of mixture of bewilderment and disgust. I don't know how to describe it accurately but when I say I was mortified, I mean I was MORTIFIED. It looked like he absolutely did not want to even hear my voice. Maybe I was hallcuinating somehow, but that's what I thought I saw. And in my mind, there was only one explanation for such an expression on his face: he had found out that I was gay and that I was into him and wanted absolutely nothing to do with me. There was no other explanation that made sense to me (and honestly there still isn't). I walked away as quickly as Cardigan left the hot 100, and tried to process what had just happened. I knew what had to be done. Later that day, I got home. I laid in bed. I nearly cried. And I listened to Your Type once again. This actually was the end. That day I had finally accepted that I was "not the type of girl for him" and I was not gonna pretend anymore that I could be anything more than a friend. I never said another word to him after that day. Even though I sang those words to myself probably over 50 times, no longer was I going to make time for him. And my life was all the better for it.


**akanewasright** (10): So uh… in 2019, I was very in denial about having a crush on a certain boy. He was my closest friend, and he had a girlfriend I was also friends with (and was straight, at least to my knowledge). And at some point the line “and if you ever think of me, I bet I’m just a flicker in your head” popped back in my head for the first time in ages. I listened… a lot. And then I learned to sing and play it on guitar. And then I was booked to do a gig, alongside him and a mutual friend. There was one day where we practiced at that friend’s house, mostly goofing off, figuring out what works for us, learning to play songs that could accompany him. But there was one point where the mutual friend left the room and I played Your Type. And that… was not a good choice. He knew that I had feelings for him - I wasn’t particularly subtle, literally everyone but me seemed to know it - but that… probably just wasn’t smart to literally sing a song that said what I wasn’t comfortable even thinking. We stayed friends for a little while longer before things fell apart for a variety of reasons, but by the end of the year, we were barely speaking. So I don’t listen to the song much anymore, even if I think it’s really, really good pop music.


**austrosinitic** (7.5): I'm confused about how this was written about a dude that later turned out to be gay, because that sure doesn't come off in the lyrics. What is his type of girl, Carly? A femboy? Under the assumption that she just didn't want to out the guy at the time, Your Type is enjoyable enough for me to stop being bugged by this disconnect. Past the writing, the chorus has never really wowed me aside from a few times that frustratingly never seem to stick around, and there's something about its production that makes it stick out from the rest of the album (from my perspective, anyway) but a yearning anthem is still a yearning anthem.

**letsallpoo** (11): The boundary between a pop star's art and a pop star's pop stardom is a line that's fun to dance across. Taylor Swift's artistry has always been informed by the personal happenings in her life, be they her family, her career, and of course, her relationship woes. Her celebrity status is informed by all of this as well, of course, and it's on "Blank Space" where she is able to tackle that most effectively. Compared to her many other songs where she tries to go against the media/the world/her haters/whatever the hell she's mad at, this song instead respond by merely becoming the character she's decried as. Yes, she is the crazy girlfriend, the one who only wants to see "how this one ends," either as "forever" or going "down in flames". It's a character study of not quite herself, but as the person she's perceived as, and it allows her to not necessarily dismiss these claims, but mostly to mock them. The instrumentation weaves its way perfectly with the lyrics; it starts off lithe and shimmery, then adds in harsh percussion, as if her relationship is literally hitting rock bottom. Even the ad libs that multiply and intensify as the song goes on adds to the sense of her deteriorating stability. I'm not sure if Taylor can ever make a song that exploits her narratives this well (God knows she's tried), but I'm glad she at least has this.

"Blank Space" was the second single from the *1989* era and was also a smash hit. I remember being in the backseat of the family car as they flipped through two stations that were both playing this song, and I was also listening to the song on my headphones. I think this song is when Taylor really came into the pop limelight — she was successful before, but this song added a dimension to her stardom that a song like "Shake It Off" could never provide.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Taylor Swift isn’t the first one to make a self-aware jab at herself and call it a single, but it is one of the best. I remember thinking how hilarious it was that Taylor takes all the criticisms of herself and going “you know what? Sure, let’s go full into this so I can make a big ‘I’m singing about exes, i’m singing about a boyfriend, i’m singing about how I’m perfect’ song” and it becomes one of her biggest hits. The music video is also very memorable, which helps with the song. Even when my family was in the “ew taylor swift” part of 2014, they still didn’t change the station when this came on ~~until one time where we heard it 4 times on a car ride and we got tired of it that day.~~

---

**fallenriot** (11): i would say this is her definitive song honestly, its such a perfect display of her artistry and personality

**jimmy345960** (11): This still smacks SEVEN years after release. Did she have to drag me this hard, there was no reason for her to be this iconic. I remember staying up and saw the music video leak and it was the most legendary thing I have ever seen. The song is so deep but also fun to listen to and I have a truckload of experiences with it, I can't wait to make more.

**poppinmmolly** (11): this is still my favorite music video she's done and it's a KICKASS song. Brava.

**simplyterific** (11): I don’t need to explain why this is pop perfection.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (11): it's THE quintessential Taylor song and maybe THE quintessential pop song of the 2010's

**1998tweety** (10): Where was this wit on reputation?

**2dina3dworld** (10): got a long list of Starbucks orders, they’ll all tell you that I’m insane. Welcome to Popheadsbucks, what can I get you?

**AHSWeeknd** (10): We need Elvira to hop on this

**akanewasright** (10): I once won like $50 in a competition by singing/playing this song. No other song in this rate has made me money.

**bespectacIed** (10): Yeah this one's the perfect pop song. I still get chills with how she pulled off this satire flawlessly

**bluepupz** (10): This is one of her best songs and MVs to date, imo. Also, it gave us "Starbucks lovers" and the beloved Insta caption "Darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream" lol.

**CarlieScion** (10): the only time Taylor has successfully pulled of a satirical song, and for that I applaud this

**cashewconstellation** (10): Such a perfect song, honestly. I remember watching an interview in which Taylor said that this song is basically a compilation of cool lyrics she thought of over the years and, God, that's a very spot-on way to describe this song. It's so quotable, each lyric is more or less perfect.

**cherryices** (10): gotta love these star-crossed lovers

**companion\_star55** (10): probably her best pop song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I CAN'T DENY A HIT. It's addictive and one of her most popular for a reason.

**endcreditouilles** (10): they should have put this song on the Death Note soundtrack, in this essay I will

**gelastic\_quince84** (10): I love this song so fucking much. Not only is it catchy, the lyrics are so clever and she does such a good job at satirizing her public image. I love it.

**hikkaru** (10): the grip this had on everyone.. the girls the gays the critics.. a moment. SCREAMING. CRYING. PERFECT. STORMS.

**HogwartsReject1912** (10): I love Starbucks. PSL season y'all!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Not that it matters, but this should've won song of the year at the Grammys

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): Gotta love these Starbucks lovers

**Jhe116** (10): And you love the GAY.

**jman457** (10): LWYMMD superior older sister, also Miss Swift invented Trip Hop wbk

**just\_thonking** (10): I was obsessed with this song in high school

**KennyEarthman** (10): the nostalgia... this truly was everywhere. can still sing the lyrics at heart

**lambeosaura** (10): wish she was more tongue-in-cheek like this IRL.

**Leixander** (10): the song that revived my interest in her music after i lost all hope with Shake It Off

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): a great catchy pop song, and also easily Taylor's best attempt at playing with/mocking her own public image

**ManofOranges** (10): I remember being obsessed with this song when it first came out, which was a big deal to me because I hadn't really payed much mind to Taylor prior to this song. But I heard it and I was immediately taken aback by how good it was. The way she plays off that image of the serial dater and the catchiness and the cleverness of the lyrics. It's all just a perfect storm of... everything, honestly.

**mudkip1** (10): probs her best pop song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i just think that pen click is the hottest thing i've ever heard

**ReallyCreative** (10): my long list of ex-lovers is just one giant blank space

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): walked so Sweet but Psycho could run

**shhhneak** (10): Blank Space into Style into OOTW might be the best 3 strong stretch in pop music.

**Square\_Preparation55** (10): the chokehold that this song had on Instagram captions in 2014 is unparalleled

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (10): easily top 5 of taylors pop songs

**TheQwertyGuy99** (10): As a stereotypical teenage boy who wasn't into popstars this is the song that convinced me TS is good.

**throwaway7650** (10): don't have much insightful commentary that other people won't say so I'll just link a piece I read long ago that really increased my appreciation for this song, max martin, and pop music in general (edit: can't find the link :woeis: but tl;dr taylor is a master of melodies/musical genius)

**TiltControls** (10): let's hear it for the starbucks lovers

**twistedpython** (10): Pop classic, there's literally nothing I can say about this that hasn't been said over and over. Sheer masterpiece, that's all I can say

**wailord\_fan** (10): by technicality? Her best song if you take all pieces of a song's measurable success. Writing, commercial performance, longevity among future work, production, etc.

**wavingwolves** (10): the lyrics of this are peak white girl instagram captions

**welcometoNY** (10): there's not much i can say about this song that hasn't already been said. it's always been it and continues to be it. favorite lyric: keep you second guessing like, oh my god, who is she? i get drunk on jealousy

ImADudeDuh: **ignitethephoenix** (9.9): wow a song about me, a Starbucks lover!

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): Okay i'll be genuine for one second. Despite what my roles might say as an anti swiftie, no song has ever been as close to conveying me as to what people were hearing that i wasnt from taylor than this song. Fall 2019 when this dropped I would be tasked by my dad to go warm up the car, which essentially consisted of me just turning the key on and sitting in the passenger seat to make sure no one tried to steal the car while he helped my mom get my siblings ready and i remember always trying to find the aux to try and sneak an audio of this i saved from tumblr on the radio while i waited for them to come outside. This song genuinely almost made me become a swiftie, everything about it just made me want to check out the album ~~this timeline was averted however when she took her music off of spotify and i was left vulnerable to be consumed by 1D's fourth album~~

**slimboyfriend** (9.8): do u remember how Taylor was on top of the WORLD when this music video came out

**avg-vag** (9.5): some of her best lyrics ever - witty, catchy, self-aware.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i dont like pop music but this ones alright i guess

**Brendon-Urine** (9.5): I tried so hard to act like I hated this song in high school when it came out but it was impossible. She struck gold

**leaffan34** (9.5): dont ask why that bart baker parody wont leave my head while listening to this

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): , this song is what made me go from just a casual listener of her into a monthly tradition of streaming her.

**astrologicalangel** (9): overplay kind of ruined this for me but it's still incredible

**bigbigbee** (9): Concept – a fancam of football coach Jose Mourinho set to this song. Three people maximum will know what I’m talking about. But I hope those three people are losing their minds right now, just like I did when I thought of this.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): S T A R B U C K L O V E R S

**duochromepalmtree** (9): to say I was obsessed with this song when it came out would be an understatement. I love when Taylor is self aware and pokes fun at herself and her image. The video is also probably my favorite Taylor video.

**J\_Toe** (9): used to think it was the best song on the album, but I like other tracks more. Though this was Taylor's most successful self-parody

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (9): It's great, but I'm a little tired of the it'S jUSt sAtIrE marketing campaign, it would have been a lot cooler song if Taylor had played it with a straight face.

**vayyiqra** (9): Tbh I have never cared much about Taylor's love life nor the discourse around it, so the lyrics aren't that big of a draw for me here, though I understand she was treated unfairly over it. Anyway this is an excellent song, though I don't think it's quite as good as some of the other highlights on the album. Ironically despite what a big hit it was, I never heard it in public ever, lol.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I’ve always wanted to smash a car with a golf club

**waluigiest** (9): at one point in my life I was obsessed with the Blank Space/Jealous/Break Free mashup by Superfruit + Shoshona Bean…. Yeah I’m gay keep scrolling.

**wasian-invasion** (9): billboard chose this as her defining song of the decade and honestly I cant argue with that

**austrosinitic** (8.5): My dad caught me listening to this in 2014 and lectured me about “selfish and egoistic” songs and haha, screw you, dad, you died last April, so who’s laughing now? This song wasn’t made for people who don’t like Taylor, anyway; it’s cleverly disguised camp that’s meant to elicit a ‘so true, queen’ response from people who already think Taylor is unfairly hated (and this is mostly directed to misogynistic comments that she got in the past so, hey, I can’t say it’s nearly as an uneven dichotomy like You Need To Calm Down) and while the music itself is as minimalist as a song from the first half of the 2010s can be, Taylor’s satirical bravado on it is as memorable as her acting in the video, which you cannot separate this song from.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): nice self aware bop

**frogaranaman** (8): major MordeTwi energy

**jsonphile** (8): iconic as hell, but honestly works more as a music video than a song. Still a great song though

**runaway3212** (8): Blank space, more like blank 8

**modulum83** (7.8): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ElEkz9qUYAARdhF.jpg

**plastichaxan** (7.5): a hit, we hate to admit it but it is

**seanderlust** (7.5): shoutout to when i went dressed for halloween as "a nightmare dressed as a daydream" but everyone thought i was just a fancy zombie in a suit smh get on my LEVEL. i mean to be fair, i looked like a fancy suit zombie but where were the swifties that night at the bar? at home with 1989, that's where. anyways it's cool 7.5/10.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): I've always prefered the concept of this song more than the execution, it's just missing something to really make me love it.

**vintagebathingsuit** (7.5): i like the lyrics but the beat is so bare and sterile

**flibbityflob** (7): Look, I'm a swiftie, and that'll show as I rank these songs. It's such a fun, pointed little song, and the way she just croons around the bridge? God, it's so sexy.

**GARjuna** (7): once a girl in high school asked me if I was a nightmare dressed like a daydream or a daydream dressed as a nightmare and I was like what the fuck are you talking about. Anyways it's one of those songs that's better in covers bc this production is nonsense

**CrimsonROSET** (6): the fact i remember this as the ‘starbucks lovers’ song and that made more sense in my mind than the actual lyrics tells enough

**static\_int\_husp** (6): This was peak "Taylor only writes about break ups" and boy am I fucking glad we're out of that era

**stryxen** (6): the melody just kinda annoys me

**SmileAndTears** (4.5): Royals was an awful song and the ripoff is just as bad

**anothertown** (4): There’s a 100% chance that in this post, someone's 11 comment will have waxed rhapsodic about the pen click noise

**bulforster** (4): The lyrics are good but the production is just so soulless...

**cremeebrulee** (4): never been a fan of this one tbh. i just think the delivery is stilted and the lyrics come off as cringe and not as satirical as she intended it to be. i do think the bridge is nice (boys only DO want love if its torture) but i actively skip this when it comes on. the mv is really gorgeous though, i wish it had a better song accompanying it.

**sssaaage** (4): jumpscare

**buddhacharm** (0): I hate hate HATE ~~your hair and makeup~~ this song unfortunately. I really can’t see it as the satirical statement piece y’all say it is — tbqh she doesn’t have the perspective to pull off self-referential “satire” like this successfully, and it just lands as grating and self-indulgent to me

**letsallpoo** (10): For what is clearly one of the best songs on the album, the title track of *Emotion* doesn't really get discussed very much. This was the least controversial song in the entire rate, with nobody outright hating it, and most people loving it — it's like we all listened to this and went, "Yeah this is good," and didn't feel the need to defend it or praise it or whatever. This is also the second time this has been ranked as the second-best song on the album, beating out all but one of the singles in the process.

But really, what an excellent song. It provides the thesis for the whole album succintly: an exploration of all she can do with emotion, with just pure and raw feelings. Her lyrics here are some of her best and some of her weirdest (the image of her growing ten feet, ten feet tall is so strange but conveys so much). The production is peppy without being overbearing, and subtly sensual in its light synthwork. It's so good! I'm glad we mostly agree!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): It’s always a surprising experience when I listen to the Emotion songs that I don’t typically listen to, and I just get that realization that, wow the whole album really is as happy as RAWM and Boy Problems. It’s another sugary sweet Carly Rae Jepsen song, how mad at it can you be?

---


**companion\_star55** (11): first time I heard this was a magical experience. wish I could re-live that again

**CrimsonROSET** (11): this song told me that maybe i do deserve happiness

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): If I’m being honest, the song that I always come back to on this album isn’t even the BIG one, it’s this one. I just love how much of a genuine declaration of love it is, and how bubbly and happy it sounds!

**1998tweety** (10): IN YOUR FANTASY

**anothertown** (10): I wish this were the opening track. "Be tormented by me boy"!

**Awkward\_King** (10): who put class a drugs in the chorus

**bespectacIed** (10): Pop music peaked after this, sorry. The moment I knew the album is gonna be legendary is when after the amazing song everyone praises was done, an even better song came in

**Brendon-Urine** (10): impeccable vocal melody on the verses.

**CarlieScion** (10): so damn joyous

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song genuinely overwhelms me but in a nice way

**duochromepalmtree** (10): this song is actually extremely h*rny and I love that

**flibbityflob** (10): Yes I can and will give the first two songs on this album 10s, they're just that good. Emotion is just...if I say it's a karaoke song that makes it sound less perfect than it is, but like... I want to be back in Tokyo absolutely BELTING this song with friends.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I can’t help myself, any time I hear that synth intro I immediately have to jump in with “be tormented by me babe” and sing the whole song.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): easily a top 3 song on the album

**jimmy345960** (10): This used to come on at work and I was living.

**joeeswift** (10): the best song on this album btw

**just\_thonking** (10): bop!

**KennyEarthman** (10): idk why but this has the opposite vibes of good 4 u

**Leixander** (10): TEN feet TEN feet TALL

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): IN YOUR FANTASY, DREAM ABOUT ME

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is a great title track to me, like it perfectly encapsulates the feeling of the album, the thesis behind the name "Emotion."

**musical\_pyn** (10): should've been the lead single

**ReallyCreative** (10): the way the chorus flows is just addictive, it should be a controlled substance

**rosecult** (10): love it! it really should've been a single

**runaway3212** (10): There is a fly in my room and I've tried to kill it for the past hour and this song makes me feel completely opposite from what this fly makes me feel OMFG I ACTUALLY KILLED THE FLY RIGHT AS THE SONG ENDED THIS SONG HAS MAGICAL POWERS IM CONVINCED

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the chorus hits the same highs as Run Away With Me. THIS! E! MO! TION!

**sssaaage** (10): YASS

**stryxen** (10): carly AND her fans are barely 5” why would she say that

**throwaway7650** (10): the 2 title tracks in this rate are so good, but while dangerous woman might be a better song from a pure musical standpoint, the emotion title track truly captures the essence (of the album) of its title to a T(ten)!

**twistedpython** (10): I'm literally obsessed with the melody in the chorus

**vayyiqra** (10): This is kind of embarrassing, but when I first got into this album, I somehow removed "Run Away With Me" from the album and for a little while, thought this was the opening track. I know, right? However I also think this is one of the best songs on it and just as good in its own way. The organ at the end is one of the best moments on the album.

**bluepupz** (9.5): My favorite part is the chorus, but the production choices are so good throughout. I can't quite make out what instrument (if any) is making up the backing melody, but that's also a highlight.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): I really do love this song, but it feels like it's just missing that last little bit of magic to push it to a 10

**jman457** (9.2): A great title track, really captures the tongue-in cheek nature of the album

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): , a rare title track that actually sounds great.

**austrosinitic** (9): This is a wonderful song to place second in the tracklist because it introduces you to the other side of Emotion other than the unadulterated bliss of Run Away With Me; the simple happiness you get when you hear one of Carly’s numerous gold-standard hooks throughout this album. These two sides are inseparable, of course, but there are just some songs on this record where you’re fully engrossed into the refrains between the verses and the chorus on a primal, rhythmic level and this is the one that leads them all.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): the rest of the album is pretty good too

**gelastic\_quince84** (9): I am very worried that my score for this album will be way too high.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): That rising "fa-an-tasy" is audio gold

**IIIHenryIII** (9): WiTh tHiS E.MO.TION Also what’s this bridge? Carly, you're not allowed to do that

**jasannn** (9): IM GROWING TEN FEET TALL!

**moooo566** (9): here we go, the album's really picking up

**Roxieloxie** (9): im really trying not to give this album a near perfect average but god every song here is just so good

**thedoctordances1940** (9): cool bop

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (9): it's sounds so good but I don't know why.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): I really love the vocal production on this

**waluigiest** (9): it’s so bubbly and wonderful

**akanewasright** (8.8): This is a really nice song as a comedown from RAWM. Not my favorite on the album, but really solid and well sequenced

**modulum83** (8.8): the 1975 have been trying to make this song for 8 years

**slimboyfriend** (8.7): I saw her live on the gimme love tour and when she sang "what if I turned the lights right down, the lights turned down. THAT'S her power.

**simplyterific** (8.5): should’ve been the album opener

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): wtf does that flower on the wall line mean lol

**wavingwolves** (8.3): this song is about yearning therefore it's gay

**2dina3dworld** (8): I originally gave this a 3 but it turns out that that day I had just decided to hate fun

**AHSWeeknd** (8): semi-underrated

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this song feels like summer (i'm a summer bitch so that is a good thing)

**avg-vag** (7.5): a fun title track but lacking title sentiment

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): homosexual

**fallenriot** (6.5): it makes sense as the album title but i’ve always thought its one of the weakest tracks

**welcometoNY** (5): this song doesn't really have much substance and like RAWM, ultimately doesn't go anywhere

#**buddhacharm** (11): https://i.imgur.com/4Bn6oAc.jpg?1

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): tequila won today

**frogaranaman** (9): I too drink tequila to fantasize about this emotion (the emotion being horniness)

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Style is the critical darling of 1989, probably the most praised song on the album. Not everyone has a [Vox video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_b86duruvs) explaining why it’s a great song, which is difficult to get. I do love the song, however, I feel like the first verse does a pretty bad job at setting up the song, which only gets good at the pre-chorus and then is amazing. However, there’s still a lot of little moments that make this song; a personal favorite for me is the way taylor delivers “taking off his coat.” I won’t argue that this doesn’t deserve the acclaim, but I would argue that it’s not the best song on the album.

**letsallpoo** (9): And Taylor bows out, once again being outlasted by her two competitors. Overall, though, this rerate was much kinder to her this time around; even aside from how all of her songs had a healthy boost in scores, she actually managed to claw her way to the #3 spot instead of #5. I think her results are fairly emblematic of the quality of *1989* as an album: There's a handful of truly incredible songs, then a fair bit of filler, and finally some hideously bad stuff. It's a solid album, and she has better albums from both before and after this one, but it's still perhaps her most significant career-wise, as it cemented her status in the pop music zeitgeist.

"Style" was always the crown jewel of the album, the agreed-upon best song that critics and fans adored, despite it being the first single from this era to not reach the top spot on the Hot 100 (it peaked at #3). It rides that slow-churning synth beat, one that's infected so many pop songs since, as Taylor takes a little drive with her man as they try to navigate their way through a messy relationship. There's not much of a direct narrative, more of a series of impressions and glimpses that cohere into something compelling. There's hints of sadness and sex peeking through that eventually explode in that bridge, where she does away with that austere veneer and comes fully into her passions. It's utterly gorgeous in a way that sounds so effortless, and even though it's not my favorite Taylor song in this rate, I can't argue that it didn't deserve to make it all the way here.

ImADudeDuh: **aldwin\_is\_here** (11): , I love the way she used her words to describe a ~~vehicular manslaughter~~ with Harry Styles.

**bigbigbee** (11): My bathroom mirror has seen me pretend to be in this MV far too many time…this was my second most played song in 2020. 2020!!

**cremeebrulee** (11): it's nothing revolutionary- it's just a good song and it just does what it does well. it's proof that sometimes the simplest lyrics can just hit really hard (i mean that bridge is literally just "take me home oh oh oh!" and it makes me ascend). idk i have more appreciation for this now since lately a lot of taylor's newer songs feel overwritten to me. i doubt this wins, but i think it would be a nice addition to my runners up 11s collection lmao.

**gelastic\_quince84** (11): I love this song so fucking much. Not only is it catchy, the lyrics are so clever and she does such a good job at satirizing her public image. I love it.

**IIIHenryIII** (11): Yeah, this is it. Pop perfection at its finest. This song has my favorite Taylor music video

**jackisboredtoday** (11): yeah i’m boring. and what about it?

**jaztinax** (11): this song is perfection. the production goes so hard, the melody is addicting and the lyrics are well-written but simultaneously fit into a catchy, simple pop song. not that those two things are exclusive, but it’s not easy to accomplish that

**joeeswift** (11): pop. perfection.

**Ktajlili** (11): was going to vote blank space but this just feels like a classic

**runaway3212** (11): Real talk this song is so good, like I don't like to be full out swiftie in rates or anywhere but god this song is so fucking great, the instrumentation just the everything of it all

**seanderlust** (11): this is possibly my favorite t-swift song. the driving bassline, the hushed prechorus, the drama in every single movement as what happens is actually so small but so big???? fuck this is good. also, this song gets way more interesting when sung by a guy without changing the pronouns. then it becomes about a closeted man meeting up with the singer under the cover of darkness for clandestine car hookups, and the singer keeps hoping he will leave his girlfriend for him but he knows that the man never will but every so often he is helpless to the classic charm of the man and he gives in until he finds himself at 3 am, lit only by the taillights of a departing car, weak in the knees and cursing himself for falling again. what was i saying? oh yeah, the song is good

**Square\_Preparation55** (11): this is one of my favorite songs of all time

**thedoctordances1940** (11): It's just a perfect pop song, I don't think there's much more to say

**vayyiqra** (11): This is one of the greatest pop songs I have ever heard. Hearing this song convinced me to listen to *1989* after not caring much for Taylor for her whole career before. I was entranced like I seldom have been before or since at the atmosphere this song creates and its cinematic storyline. I know the lyrics might seem extremely cliché, but that's on purpose - it's meant to be full of classic tropes, it's Art, you get it. I can't get enough of this song. It might even be the greatest song of the 2010s, I'm serious.

**wavingwolves** (11): take me home by one direction is a great album she's right for referencing it

**welcometoNY** (11): The bridge is single-handedly the best thing to ever happen to pop music. A masterpiece in every sense, from the layered, detailed production (those three little guitar licks building into the chorus are pure euphoria), to the lyricism with just the right details, to the soaring melody. it really doesn't get better than this. favorite lyric: i got that red lip, classic thing that you like

**1998tweety** (10): Pop perfection

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is such a pretty song, but when I envision the dude in the song I most definitely don’t think of Harry Styles. I just think of a buffer Timothee Chalamet with less chylamida. Maybe I have a type.

**akanewasright** (10): Entertainment Weekly once called this song “blatant CoverGirl-commercial bait” and I don’t think I’ll forgive them for that

**Alumineous** (10): Probably the best song in her career.  But then again, I have not listened to Red.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): taylors best single

**avg-vag** (10): a top ten across her whole discography, when the chorus hits it takes you places

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this song is hotter than Taylor's intentionally "sexy" songs

**bluepupz** (10): My best friend's a big Harry Styles fan and she broke down the whole saga of them sub-tweeting each other via song/MV lol. A Taylor classic! The chorus is great.

**bulforster** (10): Damn that guitar is so good...

**CarlieScion** (10): 16 year old me screaming along to this as if I’d ever hooked up with a guy 💀

**cashewconstellation** (10): I used to be one of the people who found this song a bit overrated (same with Run Away With Me, a bias I also overcame), but now that it finally clicked, I find this song a masterpiece. It just SCREAMS early summer, it's amazing.

ImADudeDuh: 
**CrimsonROSET** (10): this song is about the fish kisser

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Style is where the cinematic lyrical universe of Taylor Swift and the immaculate pop production of Max Martin and his crew meet. There's so much detail into Swift's songwriting here that fits well with Max's iconic pop song structure in the backdrop of sounding like a theme song of an 80s John Hughes movie.

**flibbityflob** (10): Pure musical euphoria. Not giving this the 11 was agonising, but regardless, it's so, so good. The guitar, the bridge, the way her voice is simultanously so soft and yet just aching with this undeniable lust. Pop perfection.

**frogaranaman** (10): if Tiktok was a big thing when this song dropped, I could easily see this being one of the songs I'd receive massive amounts of misinformation to

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’ve never understood why people don’t like this music video? I think it’s gorgeous.

**hikkaru** (10): NO BC THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST SONG EVER except it's not my 11 bc into you exists but OMFG PEOPLE DIED. CULTURAL RESET ETC ETC. i didn't like pop music much back when this was released but this song was like reverse conversion therapy i looped this shit when the mv dropped. the guitar the synth the vocal delivery AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

**HogwartsReject1912** (10): So sensual.

**hunnybee12** (10): fuck you

**ignitethephoenix** (10): yeah this is my favorite song from the album (sorry Blank Space!) I would like to thank Harry Styles for this as well

**J\_Toe** (10): this is the song from the album i keep coming back to the most. I like the arpeggio (am I using that term right?)

**jimmy345960** (10): We love a play on words that gets 12 year old directioners mad, i know a few. Right after Blank Space, great decision.

**just\_thonking** (10): literal pop perfection

**KennyEarthman** (10): that chorus is thick so this makes it an automatic Certified Popheads Fave™

**lambeosaura** (10): incredible. Vulnerable, honest and immaculately written and produced, likely among her best songs of all time.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): not a lot I can say about this that hasn't already been said a million times on here - this song sounds great, but is also another example of how well Taylor can sell a story and the emotions behind it. Like I know her storytelling has been talked about to death, but she just makes me feel things okay?! Anyway this song is fantastic no surprises there!

**ManofOranges** (10): From the very beginning of this song, you know it's going to be something special. That guitar had to have been sent from the heavens above, Taylor Swift must've made a deal with god herself in order to get such a great riff put into this song. Then you have the pulsating synths in the background, giving this song a much darker, more mysterious sound compared to the brighter sound of the two songs that come before it. Taylor actually sounds vulnerable in a way that she hadn't even done on All Too Well. She's not absolutely angry or devastated over the fact that the relationship. All she can do is look back on it and realize that she and this person were perfect for each other, for better or for worse. They never go out of style. And at the end, with her simply requesting "Just take me home," Taylor perfectly captures that feeling of just... not being able to deal with all these problems. The relationship can't really go on anymore but it doesn't go out with a bang. It just... ends. It's such a simple statement but it's really so perfect.

**modulum83** (10): if we're being honest here, played a major role in my homosexuality

**moooo566** (10): taylor swift and harry styles 100% ran someone over and she's here bragging about it

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i remember loving this song before i even became a pop music fan or a sw*ftie, it was just too good to resist

**poppinmmolly** (10): this was #5 last time. Will y'all tank it?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song never goes... out of Style

**rosecult** (10): she did that!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This song never goes out of style actually

**shhhneak** (10): Max Martin’s magnum opus.

**simplyterific** (10): Haylor shippers make some noise!!!!

**sssaaage** (10): i may hate this album but i cant deny that this song is really great

**stryxen** (10): perfect song

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (10): best song on the album ngl

**TheQwertyGuy99** (10): I didn't love this song when I first heard it partly because of it's on the nose title/chorus but I grew to enjoy it. I recently read a write-up on this song it convinced me that it's one of Taylor's best songs.

**throwaway7650** (10): this song after blank space in the tracklist is unfair... I remember first hearing this song in that target commercial and have been obsessed since, though my re-obsession ignited when I started associating myself with popheads back in 2019. while blank space might have the edge in just absolute perfect production, the vibe of this song is absolutely immaculate and makes me want to scream the lyrics while driving into the sunset

**TiltControls** (10): everything about this song is perfection. I really don't know what else to say

**twistedpython** (10): Maybe Harry Styles actually did something right for once when he inspired this one...

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): It’s a pretty, well-written song that shows a sensitive, self-critical side to Taylor we don’t often see… What's not to like?

**wailord\_fan** (10): This is the best production on a Taylor song ever. No discussion allowed.

**wasian-invasion** (10): not to be a sw*ftie but god damn this song is a religious experience

**slimboyfriend** (9.7): From the moment I heard that 10 second snippet of this song's bridge in a Target commercial I knew this album would bang

**austrosinitic** (9.5): What can I say about the holy grail of 1989? Not much, because this isn’t my type of music to gush over, but I still love this song. People don’t overestimate its brilliance; I’m not the right person to analyze its musical sublimity but I will say that whatever the hell Taylor and the producers did with these synths, they succeed in exuding powerful romantic and sexual nostalgia and regret. There are hardly better songs to drive at night to.

**duochromepalmtree** (9.5): writing a song about Harry styles and calling it style? Iconic. This song will forever put me in a good mood.

**jsonphile** (9.5): one of Taylor’s best songs easily

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (9.5): The sexiest break-up song she's ever written.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9.1): Not my favorite Taylor song but it's telling that *this* is the track that other artists keep trying to rewrite and not, say, Blank Space or Shake It Off. Taylor and Max brought out the best in each other here.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): One of her best songs ever, but it gets old fast

**GARjuna** (9): why wasn't this the lead single?????

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's a little overrated but it's really good

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): i took away a point because G-rated really had to say 'lights are off he's taking off his coat' instead of 'clothes', but other than that, stunning pop song

**waluigiest** (9): fake interviews…. oh!

**anothertown** (8): This is her Juice

**fallenriot** (8): a bit more basic but still a bop

**SmileAndTears** (8): One of the better songs on the album, I'll give her that!

**Uberpigeon** (8): ugh why are the verses so good and then the chorus just doesnt fit???

**leaffan34** (7.5): i like the song and it’ll probably go top 10/15 but i dont like this song that much

**Brendon-Urine** (7): really good, but also not quite the "pop perfection" it's made out to be imo

**static\_int\_husp** (7): Taylor says she never goes out of style, but every other song on this album did. curious.

**Roxieloxie** (6.7): I was on tumblr in 2014 i don't need to justify this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.5): Beautiful gowns

**Leixander** (6): it is good, compared to all the other great songs in this album though... a skip

**Awkward\_King** (4): this song makes me think of this summer when i went on holiday with two friends, and we'd play the 1989 cd i have because they're both swifties, and style came on just at dusk and we were driving down narrow lanes and it really just felt euphoric. but i still think the song is mid at best.

**plastichaxan** (4): i'm sorry but i refuse to believe these lyrics were written about Harry Styles

**Bajuko** (3): This song has never really clicked for me, and I've always found it to be a bit boring

**bespectacIed** (1): Literally the most bland basic production and cringy adult who still keeps a teen journal lyrics ever. Y'all are doing too much for this song!

**jman457** (0): Massively overrated by the swifties, probably the least inspiring single from this era. Honestly the song just sounds really boring and the lyrics are rather cliche and annoying. Also the opening guitar riff triggers my flight or fight instinct. Also contributed to this traumatic memory of high school that set gay rights back 15 years (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWwd5vks9n8 (Taylor invented disco)

**OliviaGodrigo** (0): i am sorry to swifties but 7 years later it has not aged gracefully, and it sounds like something i'd hear from a random white girl on my discover weekly. maybe it was more unique back then? then again, we had so many (better) songs with similar undulating, pulsating production - even one in this rate (and another great one being cheyenne by jason derulo), that this doesn't even strike me as one of the best 80s inspired pop songs of the time. i guess for something that is heralded as one of the best pop songs of the century, it to me sounds nothing nearly interesting enough to deserve that title. especially following her most charismatic single ever.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): FLOP!

**letsallpoo** (10): And "Into You" falls in second place for the third time ever. I haven't seen someone get blocked at #2 this much since the *Lover* era! Maybe she'll finally make it to the top when this is sent off to All Stars again.

If "Run Away With Me" wasn't in this rate, then this would've been very much a worthy winner. It's just a feast of excellent dancepop that knows how to build in intensity. I love how the opening line sets up the cadence of the titular hook, and when the chorus comes around, she's able to sing the "into you" chant like she's actually steadily falling deeper into you. The bridge is magnificent, of course, with the greatest vocal run in the entire rate perfectly giving way to the final chorus, which knows to step back before that explosive finish. Bonus points for how it puts the background vocals to the front right at the very end, like her latent feelings have finally bubbled up to the surface. This song has had /r/popheads hooked since it dropped in 2016, and it's easy to see why.

"Into You" was the second single from the album, and it peaked at a disappointing #13, becoming one of very few Ariana hits to not actually reach the top 10. I can only supposed that America wasn't ready for it yet. More importantly, it was the #1 song on the Top 100 Tracks of 2016 According to r/popheads countdown, beating out a *very* stacked year. I guess that's just the power of twink-friendly dancepop!

---

**bespectacIed** (11): The pop manifesto. The last great american pop song. No new pop girl will ever make a song as perfect as this, I fear.

**bluehxrizon** (11): crown it

**bluepupz** (11): Sorry, I had to give this my 11. It's one of the Popheads anthems for a reason *shrug*, it's just a really really well-constructed pop song that I always enjoy listening to.

**GARjuna** (11): this fucking instrumental man. The fucking buildup. However I WILL say I don't think Valentina danced well in that lipsync even though she was clearly very into the whole thing

**hikkaru** (11): LITERALLY THE BEST SONG IN EXISTENCE WTFFFFFFF. like i literally do not know a better crafted song, every piece of the production is immaculate and it NEVER gets old. the synth bass? holy FUCK

**ignitethephoenix** (11): I remember I tried a free week of Spotify just so I could listen to this album, but specifically cause I listened to this song earlier. I did not keep Spotify (shout it Apple Music) but I became an Ariana fan because of Into You

**martian\_pet** (11): a bop for the ages

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): What a masterpiece.

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (11): there is nothing to say about this song that hasn't been said. except it is definitely in my top 3 songs of all time.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (11): this song has to win, its one of only two songs that I can classify as perfect pop (the other being Toxic by Britney Spears)
[/r/popheads/comments/q5eg45/the_original_rate_5th_anniversary_platinum/hg5v4hg/]

=====

ImADudeDuh: 

**1998tweety** (10): Pop perfection

**2dina3dworld** (10): brat anthem

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A rate winner

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): , you should've get an 11 but the mods doesn't want me to...

**Alumineous** (10): I only love this song because of Just Dance 2017. Those dance moves are like muscle memory at this point.

**apatel27** (10): 2nd best song

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): i think this style and run away with me are some of the best pop singles ever

**avg-vag** (10): this is the perfect pop song. moody, sexy, confident, energetic - ariana showed up. it’s the best song on the record and it’s a wide gap above the rest.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this, run away with me, and style are the holy trinity of bops in the rate

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I feel like actual shit for not giving this my 11, but over the years RAWM has just barely inched out over it. Ariana actually made a masterpiece with this song though. Not sure she'll ever make a better song.

**CarlieScion** (10): id be more than fine with this winning

**CrimsonROSET** (10): to quote a wise man, ‘i’m so into you i can barely breathe’

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): It's still a good song!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I'll give this an 11 to this song if the Cupcakke remix is part of the rate.

**duochromepalmtree** (10): this is perfect definition of an Ariana grande song at its best. Great beat, catchy as hell hook, and her voice on full display. I have so many great memories associated with this song!!! I know this a popular opinion but this is a pop smash. It does sound a little dated now but that just makes me love it more tbh

**engie301** (10): a smashhhhhh

**frogaranaman** (10): she put her whole pussy into this

**gelastic\_quince84** (10): so explosive . . . that bridge?? Don’t really have anything else to say that hasn’t been said before <3

**HogwartsReject1912** (10): I initially heard "so baby come tie me up, and maybe I'll let you own it" cause I was going through my BDSM phase.

**hunnybee12** (10): Yaaaaaaaaaaaaas

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I'm with y'all. This is her best song and there's no arguing with that

**J\_Toe** (10): In case you needed a 30 min video analysis demonstrating why this song is so incredible https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBDJDZAo41c

**jasannn** (10): My top song of 2016.

**jaztinax** (10): it’s not ariana’s best but it’s a super solid pop song

**jimmy345960** (10): This is a meme and unlike RAWM it hasn't aged for me.

**jsonphile** (10): a perfect immaculate song. Would be my 11 if not for RAYM

**just\_thonking** (10): horny anthem

**KennyEarthman** (10): waaaay too overhyped, but let's not pretend it doesn't deserve the praise

**lambeosaura** (10): I really wanted to give this the 11 but RAWM took the spot off. Into You is one of those perfect pop classics for me, great verses that EXPLODE into the chorus, the breathless declaration of love in the bridge, production with perfect harmonies and the syrupy synths. Just so, so well done, we love to see it.

**Leixander** (10): SO BABY COME LIGHT ME UP

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): a huge bop obviously, but I think ari just sells it so well, truly at her best on this song

**ManofOranges** (10): This song still gives me chills when I hear it sometimes. It really shows just how powerful some dynamic contrast and some buildup can be, and that they can even elevate a song all the way to greatness. The way the bass-y synth riff starts off all muffled with just Ariana's vocals, and then you get into the chorus and it's in full force with it's chunky sound and Ariana just singing her ass off. And then as the song goes on you just get more and more added. It's like the finale of a tv show where every character you've seen in the show comes back in more and more spectacular fashion and you're just in awe from how fantastic it all is. And then by the bridge, it gets all quiet and you've got the more breath-y vocals in the back and then the final chorus OH it's all just so perfect. And to think Ariana doesn't even like it that much.

**plastichaxan** (10): i can see why the gays love her

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the first four beats of this song >>>

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i don't want this to win but it fucking bops i can't help it

**rosecult** (10): one of her best songs

**slimboyfriend** (10): I could listen to any one vocal stem of this song and I'd be more than content

**sssaaage** (10): overrated ass song [2]

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Yet another essentially perfect pop song

**throwaway7650** (10): this song should be an 11 contender for everyone, I'll let this video speak for itself https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBDJDZAo41c

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): pop perfection. idk how many times i've said that on this rate but it's true, it's true

**twistedpython** (10): She's got a point. She's an icon, she's a legend, and she IS the moment

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The Rick Beato video on the production of this song gave me a newfound appreciation for it, highly recommend

**wailord\_fan** (10): it is the moment, c'mon now.

**waluigiest** (10): deserves the hype

**wavingwolves** (10): i can't stand you u/hikkaru

**austrosinitic** (9.5): This is basically the Toxic of the 2010s, isn’t it? A widely beloved, widely iconic dance pop track that sadly didn’t peak as high on the charts as it should have. And there’s no excuse for how society failed Toxic, but I’m convinced that this one hasn’t exactly achieved the same legendary status yet because, Jesus, I do not remember a single thing from its music video. That explains it all. Oh, my God. I’ve unlocked the riddle. The thought of this is maddening, but the song itself? It’s maddening too; it’s absolutely insane just how good it is from start to finish. Nothing else I can say.

**TiltControls** (9.5): The song has grown off me a little since the first time I heard it, but it's still such a powerhouse

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): I came into this expecting to give it a 10 but i just noticed how the synths sound kinda fart-like on the chorus and it's too distracting

**akanewasright** (9): This song is good, but it’s so obnoxiously overhyped that it just gets *exhausting* to engage with it. Edit: nvm it is that good

**GapeCod** (9): ILY hikk :filthycat:

**leaffan34** (9): the 4 track run from moonlight to this is amazing

**ReallyCreative** (9): the cupcakke remix has absolutely ruined this song for me, baby come SMACK MY ASS!!

**vayyiqra** (9): I was quite torn over what to give this song. When it came out I loved it, then I got tired of it and for a while felt it was overhyped - I feel like I've read a bunch of essays on Popheads about how it's Pop Perfection tm. It got to the point I was genuinely annoyed by this song, but now I have to admit it's a great song even if it's a little overrated because le Max Martin synthpop. The chorus still irks me a bit, but the bridge is amazing. I don't want it to win the rate, but it is a very good song.

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): vastly overrated, but still a banger

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this is the smasha for a reason. it smashes.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.5): It's so, so close to being a masterpiece and that only makes the track more frustrating. It needs *something* - more instrumentaion in the second half, a more forceful vocalist, something to put it over the top

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Cautiously giving this a high score but it doesn't deserve to win. Not in a milion years.

**modulum83** (8.3): soundtrack to achieving a life-altering high in the middle of the low-rent gay club

**fallenriot** (8): realizing after listening to it for the first time in a while how much the bass sounds like farts

**flibbityflob** (8): Yet again, boring verse that's matched with absolutely phenomenal chorues. The production and mixing are exceptional. Ariana finally gets a total banger of a bridge.

**poppinmmolly** (8): I don't love this like everyone else does

**TheQwertyGuy99** (8): I get why this sub loves this dancepop anthem, it's really good, but not the best song the album

**Uberpigeon** (8): so THIS is THAT song...

**cherryices** (7.8): again, i prefer the live versions

**simplyterific** (7): [foolishly hoping that this song isn’t number one]

**vintagebathingsuit** (6.5): i actually find this song kinda boring

**jman457** (6.3): It's a fine pop song but not really her best or most iconic hit

**stryxen** (6): this was gonna be my 0 but then it clicked but still some parts of this song are so jarring

**anothertown** (4): overhyped

**welcometoNY** (4): it's a fine pop song, but the obsession with it can be a bit much at times

**runaway3212** (1): I’m sure the production is great, but to me all of this song’s qualities are pretty much reduced to how boring I find it. In the past I liked ariana’s vocals and the obvious joy she expresses while singing, however as time went on I just find all of it so vapid, I feel like every time I hear this song I get why people are so obsessed with it less. To say it’s the best on this album is an underservice to the album, to say it’s ariana’s best is such an underservice to ariana. In a different rate at a different time I might be easier on this but I feel like in this rate of pop classics it shows an inherent flaw in this album. Ariana can’t make a song as effortless as carly and she can’t make something as well crafted as taylor. She’s hanging in the middle and does neither well.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): duh.

**rickikardashian** (10): [i mean...](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9a668aa600a364776b14d8c2006211fc/6f15cdc065f2815b-c3/s400x600/d5c9ef8f99762afeddba516023cf91ddbcd50cc5.gif)

**letsallpoo** (10): Well, here we are. It won again. Are you happy, /r/popheads? Five years ago, this won our very first rate ever, and now that we've taken a good look at these albums all over again, we've collectively decided that this is the best of the lot. Was this all pointless? Is it even possible for this song to not win this rate? Is there any universe out there where Carly doesn't emerge triumphant? Who knows.

Am I disappointed? Not at all; this is easily the most deserving winner, and the song that is most emblematic of what /r/popheads was and what /r/popheads still is. I literally would not be on this forum had Carly not made this song and *Emotion* and I didn't stick her name in the reddit search bar to see if anyone anywhere was recognizing how good it was. And as has been mentioned before, this subreddit itself wouldn't exist had /r/indieheads not wanted to banish discussion of her from their subreddit, forcing music nerds to break new ground here. The domino effect is honestly weird to think about; there's so much history and incredible content that originated here, and it's all because a bunch of twinks wanted to talk about the "Call Me Maybe" girl.

It goes without saying, but this song is really good. I feel like I've written about it like eighteen times on this subreddit already, but it bears repeating: This song is really good. It kicks off the whole album with that weird, unweildly saxophone-bagpipe-esque hook, and you instantly have to stick around to see where it takes you. And Carly takes you to amazing places: sensual verses, an explosive chorus, and a bridge that knows how to play with both of these ends. The best moment isn't exactly the part in the bridge where Carly starts bellowing, and then the harmonies kick in to lead you into the chorus; it's the moment right before it, where the song settles down just for a moment, and Carly faintly murmurs to you what she's about to yell out to the world. She's right next to you, and it's this little brush of intimacy that makes the world-consuming final chorus all the more powerful. It's perfectly assembled, perfectly written, and perfectly executed, and I feel blessed to live in the same timeline as the existence of this song. Even if it meant I would end up wasting five years of my life on this subreddit.

---

**1998tweety** (11): I mean come on now. She's iconic.

**\_SoulGlitch** (11): this song just evokes something in me that no other song can

**akanewasright** (11): This is literally one of the best songs I’ve ever heard. Like. It is circlejerked to death, but I can’t think of a song that brings me as much joy as this one.

**allthesesongsforyou** (11): Music as an artform peaked with this song

**Brendon-Urine** (11): idk what to put here... um... created homosexuality? literally invented pop? criminalized being straight? /uj this song transcends genre and context, it IS that perfect. the world is a better place because of this song.

**bulforster** (11): I mean I don't know what's left to say about it, it's just one of the best songs ever.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): there was no other choice. the saxophone sets a fire in my soul

**GapeCod** (11): I need an 11 win.

**hunnybee12** (11): if this doesnt win someone's going to JAIL

**J\_Toe** (11): idk what to say that other people won't already. from the artist that birthed a subreddit, to the song that birthed a million saxophone memes, to the cool 12/8 time signature. It's just nice, you know?

**jasannn** (11): I believe I first discovered this song through a random comment on K-Pop review site. I remember thinking it was just okay on first listen but I just kept thinking about the song and wanting to give it another chance. I wish I could find that comment and thank them for introducing me to this song and this amazing album, and reintroducing me to the wonderful Carly Rae Jepsen.

**jsonphile** (11): yeah yeah I know obvious predictable choice but there’s a reason it’s considered one of the best pop songs of the 2010s. Every note of this is pop perfection

**JunkyGS** (11): For this rate, I have to. Sorry not sorry.

**just\_thonking** (11): I tried to avoid giving this an 11 because it's the obvious choice, but picking anything else would be dishonest. This is literally my most played song of all time, and for good reason. It is pure euphoric pop perfection.

**KennyEarthman** (11): upholding tradition for the first time

**lambeosaura** (11): This song is just pure joy, lightning in a bottle, pop magic. It holds up incredibly well, it captures the feeling of love in a way many songs don’t. A pop classic through and through, as it should be.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (11): everything about this song just makes me feel so overwhelmed with emotion I genuinely could not even consider another song to give an 11. The chorus literally makes me want to scream every word and jump around my room

**ManofOranges** (11): Honestly what is there to say about this song that hasn't been said? Like literally what? It's literally an amazing song. This dead horse has been beaten so much that at this point we're not even beating a bloody pulp we're beating grass and flowers and other various types of fauna that sprouted from the ground that was fertilized by that dead horse. There's not much else to say other than that. This song helped foster my musical identity, it helped me find this subreddit where I could, rather than actually discuss with other people like I probably should, lurk and read other people's opinions. Without this song I wouldn't be doing this rate. I hinged part of my identity around this song for long enough that my life actually would be different without it. Thank you Carly for making one of the best songs ever made.

**mudkip1** (11): still the best pop song ever created. she tore the house down boots mama!

**musical\_pyn** (11): I know this is basic but oh my god this is just one of the best songs I have ever heard and everytime I listen to it I just fall in love with pop music all over again

**nootnoot781** (11): i think this might be my hottest take in the rate 😨sorry guys

**Osaka1268** (11): omg i love the canadian national anthem

**PointlessBibliophage** (11): yes i'm a gay with basic taste why do you ask

**RandomHypnotica** (11): whenever I begin to doubt if this is the greatest song ever written or not, I take a listen and that saxophone blasts the doubts away

**ReallyCreative** (11): the fact that Pete Buttigieg hasn't made this the national anthem yet is proof that he's not actually gay and was simply manufactured by the liberal media

**rosecult** (11): pop perfection

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): this takes me to the feeling every time and deserves to win again!!!

**SFbby** (11): I have a love/hate relationship with the sax intro but this song is too euphoric to not give an 11

**slimboyfriend** (11): This song was so magical to me that it could instantly turn a grungy college basement party into an electric and emotional dance experience

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): reject homosexuality embrace tradition

**TheQueenOfVultures** (11): This song made me realize I could no longer deny my love of pop music. Pure euphoria right here. RAWME remains my most listened to song of all time

**TheQwertyGuy99** (11): One of the best pop songs ever. The fact that it's the opener just makes it better.

**waluigiest** (11): It’s just hard to imagine a better pop song.

ImADudeDuh: **AHSWeeknd** (10): THAT FUCKING SAX IS THE REASON I LIVE

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): , I'll even take photos of your feet and touch it if I'm allowed to... nevermind.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (10): not my number one fav but one of the best pop songs ever made

**avg-vag** (10): musically equivalent to new romantics with less bite and i’d almost rate it a little bit lower if it weren’t for the last reprise.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): best opener in the album. best opener of all time. Carly made some points here

**bespectacIed** (10): comment if Into You wins - CarlybQueen of Popheads. RAWM pop song of the millennium; comment if RAWM wins - predictable winner booooo 🍅🍅🍅 but deserved

**bluepupz** (10): I mean, it's a Popheads anthem for a reason lol. Synthpop at its finest, with an excellent sax riff throughout. The layered "oh-oh-oh" at the end of the bridge is a Moment. I just feel happy every time I listen!

**buddhacharm** (10): It was…fighting for gay rights, people were killed

**cremeebrulee** (10): duh

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i wonder what song is gonna win the rate

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I mean, how can you give this song less than a 10? I know Run Away with Me is treated as a meme on Popheads since the very beginning, but this is legit an amazing pop song with so much careful attention to lyrics and production. Every time I hear the word Poptimism, I think of this song and how it began a shift of music critics and listeners trying to appreciate pop music as a legit form of art worthy of being compared to other genres where critical reception is important to the success of the musical body of work. And just personally think, this song brings me back to the good old memories of the subreddit where the community was much tighter (and less decisive lol). So yeah, this song still holds well for me six years later.

**fallenriot** (10): do i even need to say anything here

**flibbityflob** (10): That sax... What else is there to say. So so so good. I couldn't help but start BEAMING the more the song went on.

**frogaranaman** (10): Carly making the anthem for those who are submissive and breedable and titling it RAW Me? what a queen and ally for the gays

**gelastic\_quince84** (10): perfection through and through. I am forever grateful to this sub for introducing me to CRJ.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The part after the bridge where she screams that high note and then repeats the same melody that the saxophone has been playing and then the two blend together until you can’t tell where it ends and she begins… it makes me feel like I’m dissolving into the ether as if I’ve been Thanos snapped but like, in a good way.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): Half the time this song sounds leaden and overproduced with weak verses, the other half it's the greatest thing i've ever heard in my life

**hikkaru** (10): i mean i feel like there's no doubt that this wins again right? it'll be boring but there's no denying that this is one of the greatest songs ever recorded

**ignitethephoenix** (10): going into this, I thought I would dock a couple points for the saxophone which unfortunately annoys me sometimes, but literally everything else about this song is perfect I can just ignore

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Pop perfection

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): Possibly the most overrated CRJ song but it's still a ten

**jackisboredtoday** (10): if this doesn’t win i’ll be shocked. It isn’t necessarily the best song here but anything else winning would feel really weird

**leaffan34** (10): just an amazing pop song

**poppinmmolly** (10): the winner last time and tbh wouldn't be surprised if it did again

**Roxieloxie** (10): the predictable winner but god if im not a slut for this song

**runaway3212** (10): THE PUBLIC HATES GOOD MUSIC

**seanderlust** (10): the saxophone? the catchy chorus? the title that can be reduced to RAWMe? this was made for the gays.

**shhhneak** (10): It’s insane to me that the general public doesn’t know this masterpiece exists.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I once was at a concert and a DJ started his set with Whitney Huston't rendition of the national anthem, and at the end dropped into the sax from this. The gays went wild

**stryxen** (10): yeah sure win or whatever i’m gonna be mad no matter what wins but i’ll be less mad if it’s you

**Sweetnsoursauce11** (10): nothing to say about this song that hasn't been said before lbr

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Hadn't listened to this song much over the last few months but when I came back to it again a week ago or so, it was just as perfect as it always has been.

**throwaway7650** (10): a deserving frontrunner I fear, I can't believe I didn't think this was a 10 for the longest time and I won't be mad at it winning

**TiltControls** (10): this should win again and hopefully will

**tinyleapsoffaith19** (10): I'LL BE YOUR SINNER IN SECRETT

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): THE album opener of the decade

**vayyiqra** (10): What a great song. It's what Carly is all about, wholesome and happy and pure.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): NOWA TAY ZONDAY

**wasian-invasion** (10): what? you wanted me to say something about this song? There's nothing left, every opinion is taken fuck you

**wavingwolves** (10): that intro sax is a mating call for homosexuals

**yusrak** (10): AHHHHHHHH

**simplyterific** (9.7): blah blah pop perfection blah blah [phcj joke]

**austrosinitic** (9.5): I also said this for Style but I don't think I can write anything more about this song because a hymn as universally joyous as this one cannot be accurately expressed through words, at least not wholly. It can only be experienced through the indescribable wonder of just listening to it. So all I will say is that in real life, my hair really resembles Carly's in the video, and I, too, have the urge, in my most ephemeral daydreams, to turn my head to to somebody walking behind me and to stick out my hand, inviting them to come and run away with me around the city, where there shall be nothing but unceasing delight.

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Pretty fucking gay

**Awkward\_King** (9): im not gonna be mad when this wins because it deserves it, what an incredible pop song

**CarlieScion** (9): https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/444532547645472769.png

**duochromepalmtree** (9): don’t dox me I love this song but it’s not the best song on this album!!! But such a killer intro. The first time I heard it I died. I am a ghost now hello rip me

**endcreditouilles** (9): a saxophone intro? oh so THIS is jazz

**jaztinax** (9): this is one of those songs that ages well

**Jhe116** (9): Soundtrack of Krely Roolind crashing Kety Perr off the cliff

**jimmy345960** (9): I've overplayed this, sorry.

**modulum83** (9): [doesn't give this a 10] that's enough contrarianism for today i think

**plastichaxan** (9): i can see why this won...5 years ago (it's still a great song)

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (9): To be honest I find the opening sax to be kinda grating but it's great for providing that sugary rush once the chorus hits.

**jman457** (8.7): I hope something else wins, but no denying this is a decade defying pop song

**GARjuna** (8): FUCK yes

**twistedpython** (8): Overplayed. The sax solo is a moment though

**moooo566** (7.5): my warmest take, this isn't particularly great and i dont care for the sax at all.

**sssaaage** (7.5): overrated ass song.. i still like it but it is #NOT that good im sorry

**welcometoNY** (6.5): I’m kind of resigned to this winning despite it not even being the best song on the album, never mind the best song in the rate. The opening saxophone riff is so euphoric, but it’s really let down by the rest of the song which is, to be honest, pretty basic, and the chorus is just a continuation of the prechorus which prevents it from ever really soaring. the verses are also very "typical pop song" which further drags it down.

**anothertown** (6): a shrinker

**wailord\_fan** (6): synthetic horns got a 6 for Shake it Off and it gets a 6 here too. It's not a cultural reset gays. Stop it.

**cyborglilith** (3.1): I initially gave this a 1 because it sucks but bitches deemed it sabotage so I raised it. [Host note: you could've also just wrote 4 more sentences explaining your score and we would've accepted it but go off a bit]

**bluehxrizon** (3): Saxophone intro is grating and artificial. Especially when you compare it to the sax on multiple other songs in the album. Chorus is basically just one note with different words. Where are the hooks??? Song sounds more 2010 than 1980s like the rest of the album. Bomb of the century unfortunately

**2dina3dworld** (2): I just don’t get the appeal of this song, it’s too shrill and squeaky for me but I’ve never really liked that sort of Robyn-esque synth work, it’s always just given me a headache and it makes it impossible to enjoy any song that uses that. It’s just a wall of sound and not the good sort, the type that’s just sensory overload to the max. Also the saxophone sounds like a dying otome, and that really pisses me off because I like a good sax solo, but it just feels like someone phoned it in.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (9.044): 2nd for these albums

**hikkaru** (8.972): this one's kinda interesting in this rate because i think 1989 and especially emotion are still regarded by a lot of people as the best of taylor and carly's discogs, whereas in a post-sweetener/tun world we've seen ari take more creative control and put out more cohesive and critically acclaimed albums. as a basic bitch, this of course does not affect my opinion from the pre-sweetener/tun world where DW IS FULL OF BOPS!!!!!!! there's only a couple songs i'd consider filler here and it still houses some of her absolute best tracks, even if it can feel incohesive.

**ManofOranges** (8.833): This is the album I remember being the most inconsistent in terms of quality. There are some really outstanding tracks and then there is some quite clear filler and boring tracks sprinkled in between. Maybe, I just learned to tolerate those worse tracks or maybe they're just not as bad as I thought, but overall my experience with this album is that I still do very much love it. Few things can give me the same high that I get when listening to Into You, Thinking Bout You, Touch It, and more, all fantastic tracks that I believe are unparalleled in quality. It's certainly not an album for everybody, but I think it is very high caliber and deserves its praise.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.639): I used to hate it when people called this album Ariana's best because thank u, next is right there. Then I heard the whole album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.472): Now that Ariana has some hipper albums out I’ve noticed a lot of people downplaying this one and acting like it didn’t have us all by the neck when it came out. Like why are we pretending like we didn’t all love this one? This album had a stranglehold on the gays for like two years, the *Dangerous Woman* bunny aesthetic was everywhere and “Into You” was the go-to example for pop perfection. I’ve also heard people say that the album lacks an identity and I completely disagree, the entire point of the whole album is that being soft, strong, sexual, and emotional are all compatible and so the intentional juxtapositions between the sound palates of many of the tracks makes perfect sense. They *compliment* each other and are conjoined by a sort of “late night cabaret/club” vibe that’s difficult to pin down but she actually nailed. So yeah, this album will always hold a special place in my heart I guess

**waluigiest** (8.278): I think this was the last album I bought as a physical CD. It was the summer after my freshman year of college, and I was disappointed to be returning to my hometown. This album is very entrenched with how I felt driving around that summer, feeling sweaty and aimless.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.083): It feels weird to consider Dangerous Woman as Ariana's best album knowing this isn't the music that Ariana wanted to make in the long-run. Despite that, Max Martin's production really drove this record from start to finish and Ariana showcased her potential as a legendary popstar in this record when it came out. Even if Ariana is indifferent towards this album, I think many people including me will hold this album very dearly.

**moooo566** (8.061): i've never really considered myself an ariana fan so i've only ever listened to this once before (also as a result of popheads). i was fully ready to slate it in comparison, but it definitely has some high points that can stand up to the other two albums. it does seem to lose a bit of energy in the middle though, there's a whole run of songs that just feel like paint by numbers filler

**AHSWeeknd** (8.056): The photo shoot for this awakened something in me….

**cherryices** (8.050): definitely buoyed by ariana’s outstanding vocals. this was the album that really cemented her as a star for many, though it’s not one i revisit as a whole very often.

**GapeCod** (8.000): I have nothing to say about this album, I just want to apologize to the rate hosts for half-assing my ballot. 😭

**jsonphile** (7.917): Ariana is pretty easily the best singer out of the three, but a lot of songs tend to fall flat just by being not that great. This album has some duds, but the good songs are really really good, where Ariana just sounds incredible

**bespectacIed** (7.833): This album predated my ariana fanboying but I appreciate its important place in the pop canon. Great transitory album from the electronic era of pop to hip-hop/R&B's dominance. This is why ariana is a main pop girl rn, she understood the assignment way ahead of everybody else. Anyways... sweetener > DW always, fuck the gossip

**cyborglilith** (7.828): this is so fucking basic

**jaztinax** (7.806): despite being a day 1 ariana fan, i never really listened to her albums in full until sweetener? so i’ve missed a few of these deep cuts, but found out that i didn’t really miss out on much. overall i do think this is a good album, but far from my favorite of ariana’s. the highs are so high though.

**slimboyfriend** (7.767): This is probably the first great Ariana album even though it's too long and some of the international bonus tracks are better than some of the regular songs on the album.

**vayyiqra** (7.722): While I think this album is not quite as good as the other two in the rate, it is very solid and has quite a few great songs on it. The thing is that Ari has always been better at making great songs than great albums, so some tracks are kind of weak and feel filler-ish. Also, the tracklist is all over the place and should've been arranged quite differently, but that is a whole other story. I've still listened to this album a lot despite its flaws and it is quite a good album for simply vibing to it late at night. I would say it's at least much better than Ari's early work and her first truly good album (the first two are just okay). This version we're rating is also arguably too long, but whatever, all these albums are long. Anyway, it's still quite good even if it's not a classic like *1989* and *Emotion*.

**sufjancaesar** (7.722): Dangerous Woman clarified two things to me: 1. That I’m wildly attracted to women 2. That there’s a lil gay in me

**just\_thonking** (7.694): tbh this is the album I'm least familiar with (although I know the singles very well), so I have a feeling that a lot of songs could grow on me if I played them a bunch, but right now the deep cuts are kind of meh

**seanderlust** (7.644): i'll be honest, ariana is hit-or-miss for me. when she hits she slaps (into you, leave me lonely, touch it) but when she misses....she misses hard. :deadbanana:. anyways, I agree with the writeup that this doesn't feel cohesive in sound and feels more just like a compilation of songs, but i'm okay with that because some of the songs are very good.

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (7.611): Albums filled with mindless sex lyrics are usually not my cup of tea at all, but her vocals make it worth it.

**austrosinitic** (7.556): Relistening to this has made me realize and appreciate just what a step forward this was for Ariana in terms of consistency and quality in her albums. Yours Truly was fine as a 90s throwback, but it wasn't anything too special, and My Everything's non-single cuts could be... choices, but while Dangerous Woman isn't completely perfect (in fact, it commits the fatal sin of petering out after a while despite doing it a great deal later on in its runtime than most pop albums) the songs here seem to, at last, finally come from a place where Ariana has found her footing. It contains as much pop perfection as continued homage to Ariana's roots in RnB, which is sadly why I think white pop fans had a...suspicious reaction to Sweetener, but that in itself doesn't obscure that this album showed just how dangerous of a force she could be. It's probably the least great out of all these albums, but it still deserves to be on the podium with them, and its highs aren't any less great than the other two's at all.

**lambeosaura** (7.556): This is definitely the album that made me pay attention to Ariana as a serious pop artist. The production and the melodies are genuinely infectious, fun and well crafted, and Ariana’s voice is incredibly suited to the pop genre. The second half drags tbh, but this is a good full pop album, and I hope Ariana does one more of this sort!

ImADudeDuh: 
**jimmy345960** (7.472): definitely the weakest for me but when it hits it HITS

**ReallyCreative** (7.417): Even though my average for this one is close to 1989, this is clearly the red headed stepchild of the rate for me. Ariana served quite a few amazing moments but they just don't stack up to the peaks of the other two albums. At the same time, she avoids having lowpoints that are grevious(I don't really count Focus). A good album that generally meets the hype.

**musical\_pyn** (7.389): it's very weird for me to revisit this album because I like everything ariana has done after this album so much better (yes even positions)

**RandomHypnotica** (7.350): The most confusing album in the rate for me. It's clear that Ariana was starting to gain more control over her creative direction at this point, but this overall still feels like an album that lacks a vision. It's all over the place, the sequencing feels strange and jarring, and there's a lot of tracks that just feel like they needed more development. But, within that, there's still some gold to be found.

**KennyEarthman** (7.278): you've been a bad girl. you've been a very very bad bad girl ari

**Alumineous** (7.222): Vocals. Nuff said. She belted, she gave us runs, she gave us beautiful vocal register transitions, she SANG. I feel like we've been deprived of vocals by, well, the 'voice of our generation' with her 3 most recent albums. She absolutely killed it with this one. But it wasn't perfect. The Max Martin production gave us this translucent wall between Ariana as a vocalist and Ariana as a person. Sure, she has songwriting credits on most of the tracks, but the songs didn't feel honest and raw. I'm not surprised Ariana doesn't like this album anymore.

**bluepupz** (7.167): This was one of my favorite albums of 2016, and I feel like most of the songs have aged well. There are some filler songs, but they're not actively bad. I had no idea the Target exclusive songs existed!

**OliviaGodrigo** (7.167): we were so happy back then - the anti-appropriation committee

**wasian-invasion** (7.111): I find this so hard to rank as an overall album because I love the beginning and end but the middle really doesn't work for me. Personally, I think her next two are better whole projects, but the highs on this are so goddamn amazing

**plastichaxan** (7.056): i can see why people kept calling this album frontloaded, i didn’t really expect such a drop in quality on the second half of it other than Touch It, but the first half is strong enough and full of classics to make this a fine album, it may not be my fave ariana album overall but it does have some of my favorite songs of hers

**apatel27** (6.972): This would be so much better if she cut the last 2 choruses from half the songs

**IIIHenryIII** (6.872): I had to give this album a third chance because my scores were really low. I only knew 7 songs before this rate, and hated 2 of them actively. Well I just came to the conclusion that I really don’t like it. I love TUN and Sweetener though

**flibbityflob** (6.800): The only album I'm not coming in with a pre-concieved notion about. All notions bar one - I fucking hate the cover art. Undoubtedly the most horny of the albums, but it's not really for me. I wish it worked, it just...doesn't.

**jman457** (6.633): Honestly this is in my opinion her weakest album. It sounds very dated and of the three albums here has really aged the most poorly.

**Brendon-Urine** (6.583): DW has some of Ariana's best songs buuut it's pretty inconsistent. The deep cuts vary a LOT, and the second half gets rough at points

**avg-vag** (6.528): 6.7 i found myself categorizing most of this album as pretty or empty or both. it all comes down to ariana’s lack of substance, she’s vocally talented but she’s not bringing anything to this record. so many songs could be better justified by a different artist with more energy or soul. in her next few releases we hear her singing with some life aligned with tracks, but this is just a collection of songs they knew would be commercially successful with some of ari's experiments mixed in.

**anothertown** (6.444): This album was very transitional for Ariana and it shows! I truly don't think I've listened to it front-to-back once since it came out

**frogaranaman** (6.444): it's cute and fun and ungodly levels of horny

**bulforster** (6.367): An album that add up to less than the sum of its parts. It was kind of a slog to get through because while there aren't any truly terrible songs, the highlights are just *so* few and far between for me.

**modulum83** (6.311): this entire album gives me violent flashbacks to department store loudspeakers circa 2015

**buddhacharm** (6.278): I don’t really know what to think of this album — its highs are great, but it feels quite inauthentic considering the direction she pivoted to immediately after this album. The lows are also not super low but they also feel rather uninspired and uncharacteristic of what the album was even going for…? For the fugly album cover it gets minus points but I think it stands as a nice transitional album into the more unique and distinguishable era of her career

**engie301** (6.256): good album 👍

**thedoctordances1940** (6.111): It's almost more inconsistent than 1989. There are some absolutely awful songs here, especially ones that just sound dated as fuck, but there are also some absolute bops so it kind've manages to level it out to being an alright album I guess, especially if you were to just take the original 11 songs.

**fallenriot** (5.889): I’ve never been a huge Ariana Grande fan honestly, and listening to the album brought basically what I expected.  Objectively she’s one of, if not the best vocalists of her generation, I just don’t like her voice that much unfortunately.  Still, I tend to like her singles, and the album has some of her best/most iconic!

**tinyleapsoffaith19** (4.694): not my favorite Ariana album, but pretty awesome and got me into Ariana in the first place

**welcometoNY** (3.950): I can see why this was so loved upon release, but it's not really the type of thing I have any use for. It's completely devoid of substance, but doesn't actually go hard enough to be used for basic bops. Combined with the introduction of the blaccent and the nauseatingly forced bad bitch persona, the best thing that can be said is that she actually bothers to enunciate on a few songs, which is more than any of her other albums. The bar is low.

**hikkaru** (9.735): yeah this is like THE pop album and there's nothing anyone can say to convince me otherwise, it's absolutely immaculate through and through hence my... high average. it's rightfully incredibly acclaimed and i can always throw it on and not get bored bc it's just so good all the way through, even the target japan bonus super deluxe extended edition tracks. the other two albums here have some flops idc about that lower their averages but my lowest score on this album is an 8.5 lmfao.

**vayyiqra** (9.412): The best, or at least the most consistently good album in the rate, *Emotion* deserves all the praise it got. This is a pop album that pop haters will admit is great. I've pop-pilled some of my friends with it, even. I think it's the album I've listened to the most in this rate, and I have listened to them all quite a bit. Another reason I also love this album is how joyous and happy it makes me feel and how it's unapologetically saccharine and cutesy - it took me a while to be okay with liking stuff like that, but now, partly thanks to Carly, I'm a lot more based and don't care. I'm from Canada and Carly is a national treasure. I love this album!

**ManofOranges** (9.412): I have no doubt that my average for this album is going to be high. It might actually be the highest album average I've ever given in a rate, and it absolutely deserves that. I don't necessarily think this is one of the greatest albums of all time, but it undoubtedly is one of my favorites of all time, if not my absolute favorite period. Without this album, I never would've really truly discovered what kind of music I like. I probably wouldn't be as comfortable as I am with my sexuality if it weren't for this album. I probably wouldn't have been able to get over the one high school crush I had that I keep mentioning without this album. I wouldn't have gotten into college without this album. And I don't mean that in a sappy kind of way, I mean that literally. When I was applying to colleges, the topic I often wrote about in my personal essays was THIS ALBUM. I thought there was no more surefire way of setting myself apart from the rest of the crowd than by writing about a topic as oddly specific as the Call Me Maybe girl's unheard of cult classic album. And I guess it worked because I got into college. So, I think it's safe to say that this album changed my life, and I could not imagine I would be as happy as I am today if it did not exist.

**musical\_pyn** (9.353): This is legitimately my favorite pop album of all time so uh my scores definitely reflect that. Not every track is a winner, but every track takes an idea or phrase and executes it almost perfectly, never overstaying it's welcome. Whenever I listen to this album I'm just so satisfied. There are like six songs on here that could be my 11.

**akanewasright** (9.318): This album means the world to me. Entertainment Weekly, which my parents bought me a subscription to for a few years, shilled for this album HARD when it dropped, so I stanned pretty much from the beginning of the era, and it’s one of the first albums I really… got into on my own terms. And I also consider it to be just… pretty much perfect, happy pop music.

**ReallyCreative** (9.294): I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said but this album still feels as fresh and as fun as the first time I heard it back in 2016. An all-time favorite.

**moooo566** (9.265): oh hey it's the best pop album of the decade, which is a meme but also entirely true. i'm on this sub because of this album.

**just\_thonking** (9.235): literally my favorite album of all time, dragged down a hair by the deluxe tracks. Also sometimes I think about the time I recommended the album to a friend and he said he didn't like it because it reminded him of the Christian music his family made him listen to

**jasannn** (9.147): Even as naive teenager with narrow music taste in 2016, I remember thinking, "This is like 1989 but even better." More cohesive, better production, better hooks, better everything. I still bop to every song on here and it still feels as fresh as it did five years ago.

**cashewconstellation** (9.100): My favorite album of all time!

**IIIHenryIII** (9.059): I should start by saying this is not my favorite Carly album. Damn, it’s not even the one who turned me into a fan; Dedicated Side B is responsible for that. I have always liked her music, but never devoted my attention to her until that album came out. Now she’s one of my favorite artists ever, and I hate myself for not realizing that before. I know everyone considers this album her magnum opus, maybe except me (and a whole lot of people actually, I’m just being dramatic), and I have a very good reason for that: for an album titled “emotion”, there’s little to no emotion in here, at least for me. That’s not a bad thing at all, but I feel like that’s why it’s not my favorite and clearly why I prefer 1989 over it. Anyway, it’s an album full of amazing bops and it brings me so much joy every time I listen to it

**waluigiest** (8.941): I was actually introduced to this album by Side B - I saw Store all over Vine and was obsessed. I then started listening to this and understood: this album perfectly captures the lyrical and sonic essence of naive love.

**lambeosaura** (8.941): Now this album is genuinely a pop classic. The 12-track version of the album is as immaculate as a pop album gets it, with the deluxe and the expanded edition, despite slight missteps being excellent as well. The production, lyrics are all well realized, consistent and just don’t let up. There’s a breathless joy to her vocal delivery that is enjoyable as hell. This album is genuinely one of the pop greats.

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (8.929): Truly the best pop album of all time

**bespectacIed** (8.824): The only modern album I could confidently call pop bible. No album in the realm of white girl pop has come close ever since

**plastichaxan** (8.824): this is mostly why i did this rate (other than the fact i have not missed a single rate since the year started), i love this album but i dont come back to it as much as id like to and taking this excuse to realize how much i love it overall and a lot of these songs was great, i know the difference between the 3 albums for me is huge but it does reflect how i feel about the 3 of them, she really did something so special here and it’s the reason this whole sub exists so we all better put some respect into the album’s name

**slimboyfriend** (8.806): Taken altogether, this album is a 10. It's a defining album of pop music, an example of the dissolution of ithe indie/pop genre dichotomy, and a herald of poptimism's dominance. Not to be too dramatic or anything.

**austrosinitic** (8.706): Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of the other two albums, too, but this just blows them away in the magnitude of how much of an accomplishment it is. Of course I recognize the phenomenal success of Dangerous Woman and 1989, but let's not measure things just in terms of commercial success; honestly, how fucking powerful must your album me if it manages to convert an entire generation of music nerds to into appreciating a genre that they not just scorned, but downright hated? It's amazing how Emotion succeeds in doing this not by any particular metric other than just being really, really, good. Complexity be damned; the giant boon this album was towards pop music's case is exemplified in how this isn’t, despite its notoriety, a record to write long and complicated thinkpieces about; to fully appreciate Emotion you just have to have a fun time listening to it. And the undeniable quality of this album shows that it’s not a bad thing; that sometimes, even in music, pleasure is better than overwrought intellectualism. (Yes, I know I’ve been a hypocrite about this the entire time, but what can I do?)

ImADudeDuh: **jsonphile** (8.676): I mean what is there to say about this album that hasn’t already been said? This album made me a simp for Carly. Banger after banger, nearly every song is fantastic

**Brendon-Urine** (8.618): ik it's a common story but this album really changed how I view pop music. I was a lowly freshman in college when i discovered it and it unironically affected my life a lil. love u carly

**bulforster** (8.582): Seems like this album'll stomp and it deserves, I'm one of the people it personally converted to poptimism and even if it wasn't that for everyone it's *still* the reason they're here doing this.

**wasian-invasion** (8.559): when this came out i remember being floored that a pop album could get this level of critical acclaim. It 100% deserves it and the only reason I don't listen to it as much anymore is I overplayed it so much over the years. But DAMN these songs, the bonus songs, the side b songs, and the 5th anniversary songs, it's a level of consistency that im so glad i can experience

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.529): Ah yes, the album that was the reason why Popheads existed in the first place. If it wasn't for Emotion, I wouldn't have cared for Carly Rae Jepsen at all to this day and I feel so many people have the same sentiment. I did like her previous album Kiss but I was so surprised to see people liking Emotion so much, especially Run Away with Me when I was still a new member of Popheads. The moment I heard the sax, that's when I knew my life was about to change at that moment. And the rest of the album followed up strongly so well that I can understand the critical acclaim and it made me appreciate Carly's discography so much. I don't think Carly would be on my Spotify library if it wasn't for this album. And ofc, every time I think about Popheads, I think of Emotion and how it all started.

**buddhacharm** (8.529): Sure there’s been a massive paradigm shift in the direction of Taylor but y’all need to put some respect on Emotion’s name for originating the sub that we all have come to inhabit. The album flopped but it did everything else right — and its legacy as a 2010s pop staple (and ushering in a wave of indie poptimism) is undeniable, especially years later. In the words of every pophead from 2015-2019, [stan Emotion](https://i.imgur.com/LBi0dTz.png)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.524): I'm a basics r/popheads user. Not mad at it!

**jimmy345960** (8.500): i have to be thankful for the album that created popheads

**AHSWeeknd** (8.471): Actually it’s spelled E•MO•TION (Deluxe)

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.441): yeah, it's alright

**frogaranaman** (8.412): it's actually unfair to the other albums how much better this is overall, lmfao

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.353): This album is overhyped but not overrated, if that makes sense. It’s an incredible pop album with strong writing and tons of replay value that’s deserving of heaps of praise, but also it’s been mythologized to an extent that really nothing would be able to live up to. Fortunately you don’t have to listen to fan chatter while listening to music, and even if no one ever mentioned this again it would still be damn good. I really wish I could fall in love all over again after listening to this!

**OliviaGodrigo** (8.235): we were so happy back then - the anti-antonoff agenda

**thedoctordances1940** (8.206): While I've come to enjoy the deeper cuts a little bit less over time, it very much is the great pop album most people claim it to be.

**sufjancaesar** (8.176): Only thing that could make this album better is being on molly…lots of molly

**jman457** (8.129): Just a really solid Pop record. Not like the best ever made or anything, but a highlight of the past decade

**RandomHypnotica** (8.100): There's a reason this sub was made to praise this album. The tracks are intricate and varied, danceable and endlessly catchy. Even at it's weakest points, the album still has a clear, cohesive feeling of fun, summery synthpop, and that's exactly what we want.

**SmileAndTears** (8.029): This album is so gay it's hard to believe a straight woman wrote it

**modulum83** (8.012): This is the gay equivalent to dad rock

**fallenriot** (8.000): I don’t listen to Carly super often, but I love this album so much.  Even though I only listened to it the first time probably a year-ish ago it makes me feel oddly nostalgic?  It gives me warm end of summer night vibes, and I can see very clearly why it was the impetus for the creation of the sub.

**seanderlust** (7.988): this isn't a controversial take on this sub, but this really should have been bigger with the GP. RAWMe is the obvious winner in this rate and for good reason - it is one of the best pop songs ever created. besides that though, this album is laced with bops and sweetness and sugary 80s danceable confection.

**jaztinax** (7.824): i didn’t get into this album until a couple of years ago bc of popheads, but it really does live up to its hype. this is really a pop staple if i ever heard one, and it’s a shame that CRJ isn’t as big as the other counterparts of this rate.

**KennyEarthman** (7.706): she really was popping here

**cyborglilith** (7.653): this album is too long

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (7.647): I've never been an Emotion disciple. It's a good album, but there are many good albums out there that do the sugary synthpop thing as well or even better. I only listened to it in the first place because everyone on r/popheads went on and on about how amazing it is in 2017 when I joined. I'm glad I did because I discovered a couple of songs I love, but overall it doesn't have much staying power for me. A lot of the songs lack tension and the lyrics are too twee for their own good.

**avg-vag** (7.529): 7.5 the most cohesive album sound and presentation of the whole rate even if the production sounds like it was funded by a Canadian Heritage grant. The songs are fun mindless bops but it’s not filling the sonic space with anything terribly interesting.

**95ztaehyung** (7.376): this was my first time listening to this album for the rate and i was actually really pleasantly surprised

**bluepupz** (7.324): I was already pretty familiar with the other two albums, but I've never listened to this entire album until now. Blasphemous, right? I'm happy I finally got my lazy ass to check this out for the rate though!

**anothertown** (7.324): The blueprint for the current new wave resurgence, but of course Carly did it with so much more finesse then most of the girls today. I read that Carly described the album as "not a period piece" which.. completely describes the difference lol.

**engie301** (7.100): good album 👍

**flibbityflob** (6.929): It's like, absurdly good pop music but I'd never choose to go for it on first look. Listening to it is a fucking delight though, especially as an adult with good headphones. The production especially is a highlight, really exceptional stuff.

**welcometoNY** (6.582): I owe a lot to this album. although 1989 was the album that got me into pop music, this was the album that prompted me to find a place to talk about it, which is how I discovered this sub. Years later, I see this album a bit more clearly, which is to say, it’s not as great as I once thought, but it’s still good. I think my main criticism lies in how manufactured it feels; it’s as if it was scientifically engineered to be the perfect pop album. There's not a lot actually going on here when you break it down, and that makes it hard to get invested in the music the way that it demands. That doesn't always take away from the listening experience, but in terms of being evaluated it does knock it down a few points.

**tinyleapsoffaith19** (6.176): can't be a popheads user if you don't LOVE this

**welcometoNY** (10.059): This was my favorite album by a wide margin for six years before folklore came out, so I feel very justified giving it such a high score. I think this is a perfect album. Every single song brings something special to the table and has its own atmosphere without disrupting the cohesion of the album as a whole. It was such a momentuous leap in her songwriting and overall vision as an artist. This album opened my eyes to how great pop music could be, and I still consider it the gold standard of pop albums.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.635): This is not even my favorite TS album and I love it to death. Every single song of this album is a 10 for me, except maybe New Romantics. I’m pretty aware it’s not fair to give them all the perfect score, so I struggled a bit to lower some of the scores. And that’s the reason why I did not participate in the rate that had folklore. It was literally the only album I really liked there, so I decided not to participate. Anyway, 1989 is perfect and along with some other songs from 2014 saved that year and the first part of 2015 for me, which was the worst time of my life. For that it will forever hold a special place in my heart.

**tinyleapsoffaith19** (9.118): 👑

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9.024): this is the only album I've ever owned, and I've had it since I was 10, so this album means a lot to me

**vayyiqra** (8.941): What a great album! I'm far from a diehard Swiftie but this album is one of the best pop albums of the 2010s and definitely my favourite Taylor album. It maybe falls off a bit toward the end, but there are so many iconic songs on here. If I could only listen to this album and none of the rest of her discog for the rest of my life I would be mostly okay with it. I just love the new wave sound. Side note: I was also born in 1989. :eyes:

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.765): I remember seeing this album being slaughtered in the original rate. That was around when Snekgate was still so fresh into everyone's minds so obviously anyone who isn't a Swiftie wasn't quite enthusiastic about this record lol. I am glad we have the opportunity to re-rate this album again because it was truly done dirty at the original rate due to poor timing and I hope many of the users will be a bit more open to appreciating this album. Emotion was obviously the better record but it shouldn't discount the fact that 1989 is probably one of the most influential pop albums to date. 1989 combined the best of Taylor Swift's songwriting and Max Martin's pop genius beats in a way that I feel like this album was the reason why the poptimism movement started to take effect, with Emotion driving that movement further.

**ManofOranges** (8.765): Certainly not a perfect album, if it's not clear by the fact that Bad Blood is here, but it nonetheless has a very good average from me, I believe. This album, along with EMOTION and Dangerous Woman all benefit from the nostalgia factor and the fact that these albums were all pivotal in developing my musical taste, as well as played an integral role in how I dealt with my own angsty teenage problems. All of which, I'm sure, are not just unique to me, I'm sure it's also the case for a lot of other people here too, but I think it's worth pointing out. Without this I'd album, I think I'd be living an identical yet unrecognizable life. Identical because this album did not change my life in any overt way, but unrecognizable because it, in a plethora of subtle ways, helped get me to where I am today. It's a very cliché thing to say, but I wouldn't say it if I didn't think it weren't true in some fashion.

**jimmy345960** (8.759): OMG this is crazy. I can't believe that I still lurk on this subreddit!!!!! I was there originally with this rate and my parasocial relationship with many of these artists were strong. I was a huge stan of Taylor starting with around Red and then this album was still a huge moment for me at the time. Obviously 2016 happened, UGHHHHH, and I was still a major fan with reputation. Unfortunately, the Lover era I fell out because I didn't like the album as much and I had a job. Then with folklore /evermore I dived right back in. I am in a completely different spot in my life since 2016, and just like august I have definitely changed for the better. Too bad that this album is overshadowed by Red, reputation, and folklore. Saying that, this album bops and we all know that Blank Space deserves that eleven amirite ladies?

**fallenriot** (8.588): Taylor is my absolute favorite artist - that said, this is probably my least favorite album from her if I were to rank them all lol.  I still absolutely love it though!  I remember thinking I was so cool listening to this when it came out, doing dramatic reenactments of the Blank Space MV in my room, imagining what a video for This Love would look like.  It will always have a special place in my heart.

**hikkaru** (8.441): i love synth/electro-pop taylor, and this album's singles did a LOT for me to get into pop music, so it really holds a special place in my heart. i actually do prefer reputation lmao oops but this has many many classics, and also bad blood which is imo her worst song (with the remix also in the main rate my average kinda got tanked a bit lmfao). i'm interested to see what the difference will be compared to the first rate with many more swifties on the sub (but maybe not doing rates?) as well as it not being 2016 in the middle of snakegate :thots:

**engie301** (8.441): she had some points

**cherryices** (8.371): ah, the album of a thousand fanfic titles… very solid album altogether, but loses its shine a little after getting used to taylor’s improved vocals in her more recent releases. brings back lots of good memories

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.294): While I’m ethically anti-Swiftie I do think that this is a really good album, if anything the reason I have beef with Taylor is because I got into her when she dropped this and then she screwed the pooch with *reputation* and then just never ended up delivering on the promise she showed on this album. The songs here are huge, smart, and feel personal while still having universal appeal, something that her more myopic followups lack for me. Fortunately I could spin some of the songs on this record forever…

**AquariusTeaSpiller** (8.271): These are literally my 3 favorite pop albums, this one is probably 3rd

**TheObsceneBirdOfNight** (8.206): It's hard for me to be objective about 1989 because it was my #1 favourite album for a long time. I suspect I wouldn't be so impressed if I heard it today for the first time, but it's neither here nor there. I think Taylor was at her lyrical peak with this album and not even Red and folklore are as well thought out writing-wise as 1989. Every line is just so sharp. Production-wise it's slowly beginning to show it's age, on some tracks more than others, but nothing stays fresh forever. Listening to it again is like eating your favourite childhood candy again. Your tastes have probably changed since then, but it still hits.

**austrosinitic** (8.147): Now that Folklore and Evermore exist 1989 sits at a weird place in Taylor’s discography for me, especially as somebody who doesn’t like her poppier stuff as much as the rest of what she’s put out. It’s not an album that I’m totally enamoured with when it comes to Max Martin and Jack Antonoff’s synthy, pseudo-80s production on it and when I remember its songs in my head a lot of them don’t seem *that* good, but when it comes to actually listening to it...the entire experience turns out to be amazing, to the point where everything falls back together into becoming a masterpiece despite the amount of flawed moments on the record. And I think Taylor is really to thank for that because, in my honest opinion it’s her songwriting that makes this album so iconic; no, it’s doesn’t match the confessional power of Speak Now or Red, but prior to last year it had her best poetic imagery and I will die arguing for that merit alone. And her performance on each track is fantastic, even if it *is* peak millennial white girl. In that sense, she may have took over half a decade more to finally strike the perfect balance between what was great on 1989 and what was great in her earlier music, but that doesn’t erase this album as a major step forward for her artistry and for her image; Reputation and Lover fulfilled those roles in their own ways, but 1989 makes the process evident and, despite its missteps, does so much better than either of them.

ImADudeDuh: **sufjancaesar** (8.000): Hope that Wildest Dreams continues to go viral on tiktok, it deserves. That’s all

**akanewasright** (7.812): Oh yes. 1989. The album that made a bunch of Swifties out of gay pop fans, the album that made her 1000% undeniably pop, the album that won Taylor AOTY the second time, making her the only solo woman to win twice. And to be quite honest, it is not my favorite Taylor album by a longshot. It was the era that made me check out a full album of hers, an album I largely liked (and still like), but this is not a perfect pop album in any way whatsoever, and that makes me hesitant to praise its many highs. It beating To Pimp A Butterfly at the Grammys is a fucking joke and that casts a shadow on the album for me. I think she has better albums ~~and better pop albums but I know that’s not a good take~~. But whatever. I still gave it a good average bc it does actually have those ridiculous highs.

**jasannn** (7.806): Oh, the album that finally turned me into a Swiftie in 2015. This was one of the first albums that I have ever loved and thought it was a masterpiece. I remember buying Shake It Off and Blank Space off iTunes and having them on repeat for weeks on end. I was pumped with every new single and MV. I was confused why there was so much outrage why this won over TPAB. As of the years went by, I found better albums such as Emotion and I understood the outrage behind the TPAB snub. 1989 was an iconic era and it lead to my deeper dive into pop music but I rarely comeback to this album and it has fallen to the lower half of TS album ranking. There are better synth-pop records and she has better lyrics and melodies before and after 1989. Despite these comments, some of these songs are still bops thus my decent average.

**just\_thonking** (7.706): mid-tier for Taylor, but good

**RandomHypnotica** (7.653): 1989 overall is a very safe and straightforward album. It's basic pop music and nothing more, and it doesn't need to be. When it works, you get some truly catchy, fantastic pop songs that deserve the acclaim for being perfectly refined. When it fails, it fails spectacularly, and feels shallow, vapid and underwritten. It's by far the most inconsistent album in this rate

**ReallyCreative** (7.647): There was a point in my life where I considered this album to be one of the best pop albums of all time. I think if you pare down the album to its best 12-13 or so, you have an argument, but even when Taylor is firing on all cylinders with her best work, she still manages to find enough filler to drag the album down from greatness.

**AHSWeeknd** (7.647): One Thousand Nine Hundred Eighty Nine 👁👄👁

**lambeosaura** (7.647): This was pretty much the album that made TS a global pop star, I would say. She was on top of the world, and the era was perfectly handled with endless promo, amazing music videos and her press blitz. Other than being held back by some duds, this is an excellent pop album, with memorable melodies and that sugary 80s inspired production. Is it her best though? I would say no.

**jaztinax** (7.594): this could be controversial but this is on the bottom 4 of taylor swift albums for me. i remember loving it when it came out, but it didn’t hold up over time as some of her earlier work has imo. with that said, some of these songs here are some of taylor’s best ever.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.588): It is a really inconsistent album but when Taylor is at her best, there's almost nobody that can match her

**wasian-invasion** (7.559): The first taylor album I ever listened to <3 I don't come back to it as much as her other albums now but definitely have to respect it for its enormity in pop culture and how it cemented her as an all time great. BUT what's even the point of this rate if you won't let me give my 11 to I Wish You Would - Voice Memo!!!!! >:-(

**GapeCod** (7.529): Bottom half of her discography.

**moooo566** (7.500): I definitely don't love this album as much as a lot of people, it's a top 50% Taylor album but for every song that really smashes it there's one that really doesn't. I will say, I haven't listened through it recently and enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.

**avg-vag** (7.353): 8.2 the problem with any taylor swift album and especially true for 1989 is that the highs are intoxicating, the lows are few but cringing, and the middles are completely void of personality. in hindsight and with more releases since, I don’t think 1989 stands as her best artistry (like folklore) and the dull tracks were a glimpse of the more empty pop to come (like lover, reputation). even with the downsides, this still marks a defining moment in the validation of femme musical identities.

**jsonphile** (7.324): One of Taylor’s best albums, although it does have one of her worst songs. But the songs that are good are really really good

**waluigiest** (7.235): I’m glad I wasn’t a swiftie when this came out because I would have been so annoying

**jman457** (7.188): Look I remember when this first came out and swifties and the media where very quick to hype this up as some groundbreaking album (it isnt). Its just a solid but not spectacular pop record that really combined the popular sounds of the time.

**Brendon-Urine** (7.059): one of Taylor's better albums for sure! so many memories attached to the singles when they came out.

**bluepupz** (7.000): I love most of the singles from this album (they picked well), but some of these album cuts are not great. I think this could have benefited from cutting a few songs. Overall though, it's a great pop album, and I totally see why Taylor had her imperial phase with this era.

**KennyEarthman** (6.824): taylor's music usually gives me a really mild reaction. like "this was nice ig," and this album is no exception. will still check out 1989 TV tho

**flibbityflob** (6.647): Takes me back to being a teenager. I remember buying this in my local Fopp the day it released, and all these years later it still makes me euphoric. Listening now with proper headphones is an incredible joy. The real strength of this album is in Swift's songwriting, when compared to E-MO-TION and Dangerous Woman, you can just hear the fact there's fewer songwriters on board.

**seanderlust** (6.512): Taylor is at her best when she leans into more emotive lyricism and I feel like in this first foray into pop music, she sacrificed a bit of that. it seems she traded in complex feelings about sweaters that exes keep and that feeling of driving home after meeting someone enchanting for tired cliches about going crazy in wonderland and shaking off the haters and her music here suffered for it. in fact, the best tracks are where that poeticism and subtle attention to detail shines through (style, wildest dreams, clean). other than those three tracks, if this did not have jack antonoff production I think it wouldn't have been nearly as well-received.

**bulforster** (6.235): This rate is my first time listening to this album and it's *such* a mixed bag but luckily there were some deep cuts I really enjoyed and I suppose either way it's a blank spot in my pop music knowledge filled.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.235): Honestly can't wait for Taylor's Version to drop (whenever that happens)

**Leixander** (6.176): this album is a fucking rollercoaster that has some of her best songs along with her absolute worst

**SmileAndTears** (6.100): Yeah sorry this is a very mid pop album. I'd actually rather listen to ME! 100 times in a row (because it's actually a good song) than listen to this. Also there are like... 2 songs that are *somewhat* reminiscent of the 80s sound, can we stop pretending this album

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.535): The podcast "The Read" was at one point my only Taylor Swift news source; so me liking a few of these songs here is a miracle!

**OliviaGodrigo** (5.412): maybe like 3 songs were actually inspired by the 80s

**anothertown** (5.324): This album came out a couple months after I moved across the country. out of my parents' house, and in with my girlfriend, all at the same time, and our other roommate was a manic Swiftie, so this very mid music will always remind me of that fucked time in my life

**sssaaage** (4.976): sorry this album does absolutely nothing for me... the production overall is so bland and uninteresting and even though there are a few songs i really like, all the others are so boring that the album listening experience is painful

**frogaranaman** (4.412): my overall biggest issue with the album is the production underselling the songs themselves, which have some decent to pretty great pop lyricism. but the singles were definitely the right choices and give a good impression of the album overall

**plastichaxan** (4.306): okay, i feel like i have to justify my average since it’s very very low, but the thing is that i find a lot of these songs obnoxious in general and this is something that’s always happened with Taylor’s albums to me so far; Lover, folklore and evermore all have songs i actually like but then there is a lot of filler, here however, it’s more than filler, it’s songs that i just couldn’t wait to finish or straight up skipped from how annoyed i was, i’m sorry i know i have swiftie besties but not all her songs are for me i guess

TiltControls: Okay!!! Delayed stats time!!! Great job with the rate Dude, Ricki and Poo. I'm sad I missed it, the reveal sounded incredible!

##**Songs**

**RUNAWAY WITH ME** RUNS AWAY WITH THE VICTORY AGAIN! 

* The original average leader, Run Away With Me (Rerate) becomes the 11th highest rated song of all time, falling short of the top 10 but still landing on the leaderboards!

* RAWME also takes the coveted spot as the song with the **most 11's of all time** with 48, snatching the record set earlier this year by Blinding Lights & I Know the End with 45

 *  Style also just barely lands on the leaderboard for most 11's too in a 8 way tie for 22nd with 18 11's!

 *  Taylor also becomes the artist with the most songs on the 11 leaderboard, taking four separate spots (Style (see above), Cruel Summer in 4th with 36, All Too Well in 14th with 24, and August in 15th with 23. Say what you want about Swifties, but they are quite the coordinated bunch

* In terms of 11% magnets, RAWME just barely misses the leaderboard and lands in 12th for that category (though still grabbing a staggering 28.70% of participant 11's!

* Run Away with me also becomes the song with the highest combined average rated 2 or more times!! Across all its iterations (Original rate, Winners I, Rerate) it has an average of 9.406. It takes the lead from Whitney's How Will I Know (in the 2+ rated category) and Britney's Toxic (in the 3+ rated category)

##**Artists**

Let's talk about some ARTIST AVERAGES!

* Ariana (7.335 -> 7.329, moves down 2 places)

* Carly (7.599 -> 7.682, moves up 17 places)

* Taylor (7.296 -> 7.294, no change)

Also due to features...

* Future (6.449 -> 6.420, no change)

* Kendrick (8.340 -> 8.292, moves down 2 places)

* Lil Wayne (6.705 -> 6.664, moves down 1 place)

* Nicki (7.084 -> 7.098, moves up 2 places)

Also I mentioned artist 11's/0's earlier, but let's see the final counts!

* Taylor: **421** 11's (1st) | **305** 0's (also 1st lmao)

* Carly: **280** 11's (moved from 3rd to 2nd) | **64** 0's (14th)

* Ariana **193** 11's (moved from 6th to 4th) | **105** 0's (moved from below 10th to 4th)

Yes that means Taylor (1st) has twice the amount of 11's as Ariana (4th)

##**Albums**

Okay yes, there's nothing to be done about the original 1989 bottom 3 score. However, Taylor did much better here and can hold that achievement up (even if I don't track it)

Nothing else notable here, though EMOTION did really really well!
