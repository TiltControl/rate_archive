**survivorjdmarina** (8): Yeah, this may be a little more drawn out than the rest of the album, but it’s not *terrible*. To me, it just sounds like a normal album track. Alas, I’m not surprised that it was rated in last place.

**TiltControls** (0): I don’t know if this song is offensively bad or anything, but it is so below the quality of the other tracks in the rate it’s disappointing. The chorus in particular lacks any sort of impact and the whole song kinda blurs together.

---

**wavingwolves** (10): incredibly underrated

**bbfan132** (9): this is the first time i’ve heard this in years and this is surprisingly nice, love the grungy guitar in the background and it almost sounds like a demo, which i also enjoy a lot. unfortunately, this will be out on day 1 :/

**slimboyfriend** (7): Hehehe... GameBoy...

**vayyiqra** (7): Maybe underrated but some more lyrical effort would be nice.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.8): it's good but pales in comparison to the rest of ultraviolence

**freav** (6.5): paradise city

**1998tweety** (5): Well....

**andrxwzsz** (5): It's not BAD but come on, Lana

**ariiaaaa** (5): Lana walked so Mitski could run

**hunnybee12** (5): Zzzz

**plastichaxan** (5): worst on the album ithink

**astrologicalangel** (4): it's not *so* bad

**bulforster** (4): More the absence of good than the presence of bad.

**CarlieScion** (4): boring

**jexan13** (4): Yeah, we all know this is one of the first to go.

**fadedblue09** (3): Tbh, I don’t get why Lana stans hate this so much since it sounds similar to her other stuff for me, but at least I can agree with them that this was a waste of time.

**fluviusfluit** (3): Yes we get it sis he loved guns and roses

**minha1234** (3): justice for flipside which could have been on this album instead.

**cremeebrulee** (2): yeah this is trash lmfao ... i gave it some pity points bc i can effectively disassociate to it if need be but that's about it

**WaffleWhales** (2): this sounds like how my local Texas Walmart looks

**mudkip1** (1): this was awful

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): sucks just like the band

**RandomHypnotica** (0): Yes to Heaven gets cut from the album but THIS makes it onto the deluxe? THIS? LANA WHY???

**Steelstepladder** (0): I just don't get it. What's the point of this. Why would I want to listen to this?

**worlds-okayest666** (0): this is really really boring and goes nowhere

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): This track is pretty nice! The lyrics are very heartbreaking, but very captivating as a story. Unfortunately, this isn’t from Lana’s pen, it was actually a song first sung by Nina Simone. However, it doesn’t take away the beauty of the lyrics.

**TiltControls** (6): It’s a fine cover, but something is missing compared to Nina Simone’s original. It needs just a bit more fire or something, cause as it stands it’s pretty forgettable tbh

---

**cremeebrulee** (10): her best cover

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i know this is just a cover but oh my god is it stunning

**mudkip1** (9): one of the few songs that didnt overstay its welcome

**WaffleWhales** (9): y’all are SLEEPING on this cover! Equally as good as Doin’ Time, if not better.

**waluigiest** (9): tbh I don’t know the original but the production and orchestration here have always been so beautiful to me

**bbfan132** (8): an interesting song to close the standard edition of the album with but it works, it’s a great cover

**freav** (8): I like the non deluxe version of this album more not just because it's 3 songs shorter but also because this is a really cool and nicely written song that works great as a closer.

**jexan13** (8): Cute. Not bad, but nothing too otherworldly.

**wavingwolves** (8): one of her best covers

**1998tweety** (7): Well...

**Steelstepladder** (7): It's short and focused. I like it

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.2): one of the two skips on this album

**andrxwzsz** (6): Nvm

**RandomHypnotica** (6): I actually really like this as a cover, and it's a nice way to end the album (The standard edition anyway...)

**vayyiqra** (6): pensive

**akanewasright** (5): Not her best work, but it’s a good way to end the album. The story arc of it all has been completed with Lana’s character realizing that she’s trapped herself in an unhappy situation. I don’t hate this song (quite the opposite), but if it goes out first, I’ll be okay with that. After all, if Nina Simone had a #1 single, Lana would probably call her a woman who had a number one with a song about being sexy, wearing no clothes, fucking, cheating, etc.

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): Ya know, some people just aren't cut out to sing

**sandyfishnets** (3): this cover doesn't do it for me...

**fadedblue09** (1): This bitch really got the nerve to do covers when she barely sounds good on her OWN songs. Yikes! Have to stan for bravery though.

**TiltControls** (10): I actually really liked this track and a little sad (but not surprised) to see it going early. I like her energy on the chorus, but I definitely see how it can be grating.

**survivorjdmarina** (8): I, too, want money, power and glory. This song is a little… average, but it’s nice at its core. I definitely get its placement though.

---

**1998tweety** (10): I am levitating

**minha1234** (9.2): underrated masterpiece

**bbfan132** (8.5): another repetitive/lethargic song but the downtempo/trip hop sound makes it more interesting

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): three things i also want but do not have

**freav** (7.3): turns out this spacey and minimalistic instrumental fits her rather well

**Steelstepladder** (7): Not bad and doesn't overstay it's welcome like so many songs on the album

**ariiaaaa** (6.2): why do I kinda get Robin Daggers vibes from the beginning?

**andrxwzsz** (6): We know, girl

**vayyiqra** (6): mid

**wavingwolves** (6): capitalist anthem

**bulforster** (5): The histrionics of this chorus are the only time she really nails the self-parody I think she's going for on parts of this album, too bad the rest is nowhere near as good.

**jexan13** (5): In a perfect world this and FMWTTT doesn't exist and Ultraviolence (standard) gets a +9 score for every song. Damn it.

**WaffleWhales** (5): all of which I lack

**fadedblue09** (3): I smell a colonialism anthem here somewhere...

**akanewasright** (2): This song has always kind of just been there. I’m probably being meaner to it than I would be normally, but this was always a song I would skip. At least it has the bridge and “that’s not what this bitch wants, not what I want at all,” which is an excellently delivered line.

**mudkip1** (1): muhhhhneeeeeeyyyy,,,,,, pahwuuuuhhhhhhh,,,,,,, glauhhhhreeeeeeeeeeeeee,,,,,,

**brenda\_official** (0): one of the lana songs that sounds like a parody of a lana song, others in this genre include Art Deco, Lust For Life and GBAAATBWII

**survivorjdmarina** (10): This song is an emotional rollercoaster, mainly due to its arrangement and production. The lyrics can seem a little repetitive, but honestly it’s so relatable. Shame it’s going out at third-to-last :(

**TiltControls** (4): I wish the song just did something more. It just sounds like a lesser version of all of her other songs. Not the worst on the album, but a forgettable experience for me.

---

**vayyiqra** (11): Idk why but I can put this on loop because I love the chorus so much and I am a sad boy so I feel it. I know this isn't going to win, but I have to give it my 11 anyway.

**jexan13** (9.5): I like this so much. It gave me unrealistic expectations of how rock sounds.

**1998tweety** (9): An eternal mood.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): big mood

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): "I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a maAaAaAad girl" - Lana Del Rey in one sentence

**bbfan132** (8): kind of repetitive but i love the vibe

**WaffleWhales** (8): me as of late

**wavingwolves** (8): this one is solely for the melancholic bitches

**thunderbird\_14** (7.5): 7.5 points for that bridge alone

**andrxwzsz** (6): And we're in the "oh..." part of the album

**cremeebrulee** (6): this and PWYC are the only 2 songs i skip when listening thru UV, i can go without it

**fadedblue09** (6): Not as hideous as the past few tracks, but why does she have a habit of wasting five minutes of peoples’ lives?

**slimboyfriend** (6): Yah I think I finally get her point

**CarlieScion** (5): the chorus on this just makes me want to lie down for a while

**akanewasright** (4): Back when I stanned Lana, I would have made excuses for this song. To be honest, I still like it, but it’s not... very good. The lyrics are kind of bad, and I don’t blame anyone who calls this song boring and overlong

**Steelstepladder** (3): Lana rhyming sad girl with bad girl on the chorus bothers me for some reason. Also a song about simply being sad doesn't need to be over five minutes long. Just too many small Lana-isms that get on my nerves kill this song for me

**bulforster** (2.5): This is a baaad song, this is a baa-aa-aad song.

**ariiaaaa** (0): her vocal performance is so odd here, and I can barely make out a word here

**TiltControls** (9): Definitely one of the stranger songs of the album, but I actually really enjoyed it. The weird vocal breakdown during the chorus is a neat touch. Do I have any idea what she’s talking about other than being in a one-sided relationship? No, but the song keeps my interest regardless.

**survivorjdmarina** (7): It’s not awful, but I’m a little indifferent on it. It’s cute I guess.

---

**andrxwzsz** (10): The one two punch of this and the title track sends me into a coma

**mudkip1** (10): the climax is so fucking hot

**1998tweety** (8): The ending is great

**bbfan132** (8): the intro was beautiful, the backing vocals make this song imo

**Steelstepladder** (8): This ending is so good. I absolutely love how she plays around with melodies in her climaxes.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): I wish someone would ride a bear for ME

**bulforster** (7.5): Uncharacteristically for this album, the instrumental passage is the worst part of a pretty good song and just unnecessarily takes up time.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): this is weird af but i kinda fucks with it

**freav** (7.4): I feel like the album dips a little in quality at this point but there's still a lot of fun stuff going on here

**jexan13** (6): I can't remember a single thing

**minha1234** (5.7): not my style

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Feels a little empty lyrically and not as musically interesting. The outro is climactic though.

**vayyiqra** (5): Weird lyrical metaphors but sure this has a good beat even though by the end I was getting very tired of it.

**wavingwolves** (5): "did you ever really stan me? like i stan you"

**survivorjdmarina** (9): It’s nice, it’s different, it’s unusual. Chica cherry cola lime.

**TiltControls** (7): Sorry Florideans. This is not a bad song, but probably one of the weaker ones on the album. It brings a bit more of an upbeat energy compared to the rest of the album, but her vocal sounds a bit… off here. Also Lana stop saying Yayo I don’t want to remember that song

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): my fave lana song ever yup!

**CreepyMannequin** (10): this song always reminds me of Jeb Bush for some reason

**hunnybee12** (10): i peaked at 14 when this dropped while i was in the florida keys

**bbfan132** (9): i still remember staying up all night and listening to this at like 7 am back in 2015 for some reason lol; anyway, i like how this takes us out of the dreamy haze we’re in for most of the album

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): queen of coke! taylor quaking

**jexan13** (9): ¡Lana mencionó uno de mis paises! ¡Qué orgullo mi Cocalombia querida <3!

**Steelstepladder** (9): Now this is actually a decent change of pace in the album! I feel like the pure Lana stans might hate this one but I'm just happy to get a song that isn't "slow five minute song about being sad and beautiful"

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): this is way out of place on the album but it's catchy so I accept it

**1998tweety** (8.5): This grew on me, a cute lil bop

**jman457** (8.3): Lana's second best album after NFR

**bespectacIed** (8): cokehead anthem. closest thing we would ever have to a synthpop lana song

**vayyiqra** (8): Lana write song about drug what else is new

**minha1234** (7.4): catchy but that's it

**andrxwzsz** (7): Bop, plain and simple

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): ok I'm kind of a fan of demented baby voice Lana

**wavingwolves** (5): incredibly overrated

**waluigiest** (4): this song is really bad. But I like it. I love how she says “come on down to Florida” but the song still sucks so hard

**bulforster** (2.5): That voice she's using for the chorus is like nails on a chalkboard.

**fadedblue09** (1): Look, I get that this is about drugs, but that doesn’t give you a pass for singing hideously like that. (To all the people who ‘bop’ to this unironically, please seek help omg)

**kappyko** (0): fuck florida. i live here and its nothing like this!!!

**mudkip1** (0): this was awful

**WaffleWhales** (0): Lana Del Rey was simply too powerful when she created Cruel World and Ultraviolence as the openers, so she had to close the “deluxe” version of the album with this sad, grating excuse for a song. The deluxe tracks really drag the album out, but this is the worst song on the album (and perhaps on Lana’s whole discography). It’s mind blowing to know Lana had any hand in placing this on the record. Her vocals are just irritating to listen to, and the lyrics feel so uninspired and hollow. Exactly what the degrading critics had in mind for Lana’s future sound. It could maybe fit in as a reject on BtD Deluxe/Paradise. Or maybe next to the Summertime Sadness Remix. Just not here.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): I am not pretty when I cry, but this song is pretty, and you guys are wrong for putting this out so early.

**TiltControls** (7): The guitar is a nice touch on the song, and Lana sounds great. However, I’m having the same problem with a lot of these day 1 songs of hers where I like listening to them and then just forget about them later, especially when compared to the stronger songs on the album.

---

**CritneySpearz** (11): hearing this song live is actually one of the best experiences I’ve had lmao

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the bridge! that's art, girls!

**jexan13** (10): Another 11 contender just for that bridge alone. "I'm stronger than all my men... except for you", whew, I'm now balder than all my men.

**1998tweety** (9.5): I love how haunting this song is, her messy vocals actually add to it.

**akanewasright** (9): I adore this song with all of my being.

**wavingwolves** (9): "i'm stronger than all my men" yes!! "except for you" noooooo

**bbfan132** (8.5): lethargic in the best way possible

**RandomHypnotica** (8): I like the chorus but the verses just sound like an improved Yayo

**vayyiqra** (8): Lana is pretty [2]

**fadedblue09** (7.2): You definitely don’t sound pretty when you sing, that’s for sure.

**andrxwzsz** (7): Better but still repetitive

**freav** (6.7): don't love the song but this is probably her most interesting vocal performance on this album

**cremeebrulee** (6): like sad girl, this is a skip for me

**rotating3Dtext** (6): huh I’ve never noticed how… rough her vocal performance is here

**minha1234** (5.8): sounds just like Sad Girl but worse

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): The song is fine but it makes me wish Lana got a vocal coach before dropping this album.

**hunnybee12** (5): the only redeemable part is the bridge & outro, her voice in the verses is so grating

**Steelstepladder** (5): This is not bad for what it is but the overall aesthetic that shes going for here does nothing for me.

**ariiaaaa** (2): why does this sound off key??? is this an artistic choice at this point

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): I like this. It’s not as bad as people make it out to be. The arrangement is very interesting, to be quite honest.

**TiltControls** (6): I really love this album, but this song doesn’t really do much for me. The lyrical story is great, but the instrumentation is a bit too messy for me here, which is saying a lot since I love the messiness on the rest of the album.

---

**andrxwzsz** (10): One of the most iconic openers ever

**plastichaxan** (10): the textures, i'm so!!!!!1

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): such an interesting opener and definitely sets the tone for a change from her earlier almost cabaret-like influences

**slimboyfriend** (9): gay

**bbfan132** (8.5): this is definitely quirky and i’m not sure what to take from it but i enjoyed it haha

**freav** (8.2): always liked how left-field this was for an abum opener

**bespectacIed** (8): sex

**WaffleWhales** (8): The outtro is a bit strange but the instrumentals on the first listen are nice

**minha1234** (7.8): extra points for the instrumental breakdown in the end

**1998tweety** (7): She's an all right opener.

**akanewasright** (7): Song go brrrrr

**ariiaaaa** (7): I am a sucker for experimental stuff so this gets some points just for being weird

**Steelstepladder** (7): On re-listen I totally get why so many people were saying this was their hardest album to get through... Doesn't stop me from liking that blown out fuzz sound though

**thunderbird\_14** (7): Yes mamsir. Whisper me brrrrrrrrr

**bulforster** (6.5): The chorus/title is just unwieldy.

**fadedblue09** (6): I really love the instrumental but the song itself feels very underwhelming and non-descript.

**jexan13** (5.5): I can't remember anything apart of the (kind of) irritating hook.

**wavingwolves** (4): how is this under 3min but it feels like it lasts so much longer

**vayyiqra** (3): Uhh I knew this title was vaguely familiar from somewhere and it's about BDSM and from a horny artsy French movie I probably read about on Wikipedia one day. Anyway it's really weird but a neat concept but also a bad choice to open an album.

**sandyfishnets** (2): not the most sonically appealing song imo

**CritneySpearz** (1): I…. don’t know how to feel?....

**astrologicalangel** (0): it is just very grating

**cremeebrulee** (0): am i stupid or do i just not get this

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): This track is nuts!! I don’t get why people rated it so low compared to some tracks here. Whatever floats their boats, I guess.

**TiltControls** (8.5): Another song I wish had done a bit better. The instrumental on this one is actually amazing. I think with the Strange Mercy songs sometimes the lyrics can feel very abstract or unrelatable at times, especially when compared to Lana and Mitski. That doesn’t make this bad, but it does hold it back from being fantastic.

---

**andrxwzsz** (9): Haunting followup to the title track in a way

**jexan13** (9): Saved the album

**bulforster** (8.5): I like the free-flowing vocal lines but I wish the vocals were a bit clearer and less subdued and breathy.

**bbfan132** (8): i love when the song suddenly gets super noisy with the guitars

**slimboyfriend** (8): Not SUPER crazy about the song until the last half 30 seconds when my inner rocker chick takes over

**1998tweety** (7.5): kind of a nonevent except for the end

**vayyiqra** (6): This is weird but intriguing and it bops harder than anything else on this album so far.

**wavingwolves** (6): why does this feel like something i've heard before?

**fadedblue09** (5): The outro was amazing (I sense a recurring pattern here somewhere), but overall I find the track to be quite empty.

**Steelstepladder** (4): Don't really like the how uneven this song feels. I'm not sure what that means but I stand by it.

---

**andrxwzsz** (9): Definitely feels like the b-side, but it's one of her most unique songs and still amazing like the rest of Strange Mercy

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I like the part when she says whore

**jexan13** (5): The only song in UV (standard) that I would call mediocre, along with MPG. Not terrible, just... not up to the high bar the album set before.

**wavingwolves** (5): i do love the way this song is kind of a power move but it's a little annoying

**fadedblue09** (4.9): I’ve heard that this is supposed to be some Lorde/Gaga diss? I really hope that isn’t true because this is just fucking bad and embarrassing.

**akanewasright** (1): This song does nothing for me.

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): It’s a fine track, not much to say beyond that.

**TiltControls** (5): Until the last 4 ballots came in, Mitski was actually going to get through Day 1 without losing any main rate songs. Though honestly, if any Mitski song was to get eliminated first, this was definitely the best one. Nothing really remarkable happens for the song’s 5 minute runtime. I know I criticised a few Mitski songs for being too short, but if this is the alternative go do your 2 minute songs sis

---

**bespectacIed** (10): crack

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is gonna get robbed smh

**fluviusfluit** (10): Goddamn the emotions

**jexan13** (10): Ok, maybe she snapped. Maybe because it doesn't feel like white noise.

**WaffleWhales** (10): "Crack baby" was a term coined to describe children who were exposed to crack (freebase cocaine in smokable form) as fetuses; the concept of the crack baby emerged in the US during the 1980s and 1990s in the midst of a crack epidemic. Other terms are "cocaine baby" and "crack kid". Early studies reported that people who had been exposed to crack in utero would be severely emotionally, mentally, and physically disabled; this belief became common in the scientific and lay communities. Fears were widespread that a generation of crack babies were going to put severe strain on society and social services as they grew up. Later studies failed to substantiate the findings of earlier ones that PCE has severe disabling consequences; these earlier studies had been methodologically flawed (e.g. with small sample sizes and confounding factors). Scientists have come to understand that the findings of the early studies were vastly overstated and that most people who were exposed to cocaine in utero do not have disabilities. (From Wikipedia)

**bbfan132** (9): that bass though….

**plastichaxan** (9): i'm baby

**Steelstepladder** (9): Mitski does Lana Del Rey better than Lana Del Rey

**1998tweety** (8.5): Beautiful and ominous

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I didn't like this at first but I'm glad I gave it another go because the latter half of the song is immaculate.

**freav** (8.2): trip hop queen

**andrxwzsz** (8): I need a therapist

**CarlieScion** (7): as a crack baby, i relate

**hunnybee12** (6): I get what it means in the context of the song but the chorus gives me an uncomfortable mental image

**wavingwolves** (6): lowest point on the record imo but still not bad just less interesting. the stormy ending is the highlight of it

**mudkip1** (4): never have been a big fan of this one

**vayyiqra** (4): :face_with_raised_eyebrow: What an awful title but an okay song nonetheless even though it's a little too long. Too bad the weird and uncomfortable concept of the song brings it down a lot.

**survivorjdmarina** (6.5): This track ranks relatively low for me on this album, so I guess I don’t mind it being out this early??

**TiltControls** (6.5): Similar to Crack Baby, this is only leaving on Day 1 due to the last ballot that came in. I can’t say I’m too mad though, it’s another one of the songs on the album I’m just neutral on. It’s sweet compared to the other songs from Puberty 2, but I wish she did a bit more with the instrumentation.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): "If you would let me give you pinky promise kisses / Then I wouldn't have to scream your name/ Atop of every roof in the city of my heart" i fucking hate her simp ass so much... but same

**fluviusfluit** (10): IN THE REARVIEW MIIIIIRROR

**WaffleWhales** (10): this song is placed last in the “mitski songs ranked from a scale of jaded cynic to hopeless romantic” spotify playlist and i agree

**wavingwolves** (10): just the "if you would let me give you pinky promise kisses then i wouldn't have to scream your name atop of every roof in the city of my heart" line is a 10 by itself

**plastichaxan** (9.6): 3 for 3 so far in this album wow

**freav** (9.5): kick kick-kick snare, i love the melody on this song

**CarlieScion** (9): mitski if you read this im free on Thursday night and would like to hang out. Please respond to this and then hang out with me on Thursday night when I’m free.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This sounds so different from her usual output, love it.

**akanewasright** (8.5): This was lovely

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): oof. she's got a lot of feelings, huh?

**andrxwzsz** (8): Yearnful, horny — it's a classic Mitski song

**bbfan132** (8): probably the most underwhelming track on the album but it’s a needed break from the raw tracks that precede and follow it

**purplechilipepper** (8): this is so pretty ugh

**fadedblue09** (6): IMO the weakest song on the album. It's not bad and still well-written, but it's too subdued and lacks the emotional punch of the other songs.

**jexan13** (6): what was that?

**mudkip1** (6): you misspelled this btw. it's 'Once More to See You'

**Steelstepladder** (6): Probably my least favorite on the album. Still decent though

**bulforster** (5): This just kinda drags, especially with how sparse and unvarying the instrumental is.

**vayyiqra** (3): Mitski does this thing a lot where she writes songs that meander and have no clear melody that stands out and this is one of them.
