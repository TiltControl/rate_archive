**survivorjdmarina** (10): This is a crooner! It’s sexy, seductive and captivating. Kind of a precedent for Masseduction.

**TiltControls** (10): This song is beautiful, and a nice change of pace from the rest of the album. Though I do love her heavier, more chaotic tracks every part of this song just fits together perfectly.

---

**andrxwzsz** (10): Total heartgutter, I've cried to it many times

**bespectacIed** (10): god damn this is a stunning title track.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): would absolutely be my 11 if ultraviolence wasnt one of the albums in this rate. just heartwrenching and beautiful

**freav** (10): the bridge of this song is the finest moment of this album

**rotating3Dtext** (10): the instrumental section of this song sounds like what would play in a cave section in an RPG

**akanewasright** (9): This is just such a cool song. I adore that twangy instrument that plays in the interludes.

**hunnybee12** (9): acab

**slimboyfriend** (9): A+ wistful nighttime walk song.

**worlds-okayest666** (9): the lyrics always get me ;-;

**1998tweety** (8.5): We love a good ballad

**bulforster** (8.5): St. Vincent said abolish the prison-industrial complex!!

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Quite straightforward considering the preceding track, and I love it! Also some really timely lyrics.

**fluviusfluit** (8.5): A reminder that Annie says "strange mercy" at the halfpoint of the album

**Steelstepladder** (8): She really lets her voice do a lot of the heavy lifting here which is a nice change of pace on the album... I like the heavy distortion sound better though.

**bbfan132** (7.5): annie is a very interesting lyricist, still trying to figure out what she means at times

**jexan13** (7): Here's when the album starts to go down

**wavingwolves** (7): sounds a little like a videogame soundtrack so i stan

**vayyiqra** (6): St. Vincent meets lo-fi chill radio on YouTube and it's not bad somehow.

**survivorjdmarina** (8): It’s a pretty closer.

**TiltControls** (8): Unlike some of Mitski’s other short songs, I do think the length actually affects this one. It just kind of… ends. Still, it’s an otherwise incredible song. Her performance is great here, and I can imagine some non-Mitski fans enjoying it since it’s definitely not as harsh or chaotic as her other tracks on the album.

---

**WaffleWhales** (11): i’ll love some littler things

**andrxwzsz** (10): Makes you cry hard, but they're almost happy tears

**bbfan132** (10): i am the fire and i am the forest and i am a witness watching it… i stand in a valley watching it

**bespectacIed** (10): Great way to end a melodramatic album tbh. Mitski knows her trauma and internal turmoils are all very real for her, but they're also kinda romanticized by her, and she knows she still has to don her white button down everyday to face the uncaring normality of life. Slay, i think

**bulforster** (10): "I am the fire and I am the forest and I am a witness watching it" 🔥🔥🔥

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): yes im crying and what about it

**fadedblue09** (10): Wish I had another 11! I love song titles that paint the images they evoke, and it gives my idyllic vibes. A lot of Mitski's short songs leave me wanting more, but this one feels perfect.

**fluviusfluit** (10): She said all there is to say with this one

**letsallpoo** (10): i have a very vivid memory of posting the [FRESH VIDEO] for this to /r/popheads in 2016 and getting like 20 upvotes

**mudkip1** (10): another potential 11 ugh i love mitski

**freav** (9.6): such a beautiful coda to the emotional climax that is crack baby

**1998tweety** (9): The lyrics on this are so damn good

**CarlieScion** (9): a cute closer

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.6): great closer to the album!

**jman457** (8.3): Such a good album her best so far (dont kill me Be the Cowboy Stans)

**Steelstepladder** (8): The perfect closer. Yet not a song I'd really go back to.

**wavingwolves** (8): the way this reminds me of jo from little women

**akanewasright** (7): This is a soft note to go out on, but a lovely one.

**jexan13** (7): Not too bad

**ariiaaaa** (6.3): I am a sucker for the guitar in this track

**vayyiqra** (5): Like with many Mitski songs, I blinked and it was over.

**TiltControls** (10): This is another favourite of mine. The slowly building guitar adds a lot to the song’s production. I love how vivid the lyrical component is. Mitski does a great job at evoking all this wonderful, happy imagery with fireworks, but with a definite air of sadness and isolation. Everything comes together with this song and I’m glad it made it’s way into the top 10.

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): It’s cool, it’s got a nice progression to it. Kinda thought it would be out earlier though.

---

**akanewasright** (10): Holy fuck. This is one of the best songs I’ve ever heard about depression. For one, it slaps, but also it’s short and to the point while also being gorgeously metaphorical

**andrxwzsz** (10): She truly gets it and says it like nobody else

**bespectacIed** (10): Who is this new indie girl, I love her positive outlook in life 💕 Looking forward for more morally uplifting songs like this, I bet she does many

**fadedblue09** (10): A song about pain triggers coming out of nowhere? I never knew I needed this my entire life. The climactic instrumental is just the icing on the cake.

**fluviusfluit** (10): Katy is shaking

**freav** (10): chamber pop-punk anthem

**mudkip1** (10): get into it

**sandyfishnets** (10): yup I'm crying.

**Steelstepladder** (10): This is my first Mitski song and I will always cherish it because of that

**WaffleWhales** (10): really captures the stuck in quarantine vibe like no other song out there

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): katy retired

**bbfan132** (9): “i will be married to silence” - me whenever i have to interact with people i know and socialize

**bulforster** (9): I love how the tension in the instrumental from the persistent pulse of that guitar note never fully pays off, instead building for the climax of the album.

**1998tweety** (8.5): If the song is called Fireworks imma need a HUGE explosion, with that said it's still good

**jexan13** (7.5): Well, a bit better

**wavingwolves** (7.5): outsold katy!!!

**waluigiest** (7): the start is great but I want it to be bigger than it gets

**CarlieScion** (6): do you ever feel like a plastic bag

**vayyiqra** (5): This is very just okay.

**TiltControls** (10): I would not have thought a 1D song would work well as a Mitski cover but here we are. Honestly Mitski has some great taste for choosing one of 1D’s best songs. Though this held 2nd for most of the ballots, I would not have minded either song winning the bonus.

**survivorjdmarina** (9): This is a pretty cool cover! She brings a lot of soul here.

---

**bbfan132** (10): this is the best cover in recorded history

**bespectacIed** (10): HOW THE FUCK?????

**freav** (10): this works great as noise pop song, who would have thought

**hunnybee12** (10): proof mitski can sing anything and make it sound profound

**wavingwolves** (10): this is an obvious 12 for me since fireproof is my favourite 1d song

**CritneySpearz** (9): I was wondering why I liked it so much, then I realized it was a cover lmaoooo (clown emoji)

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): The way Mitski can make a 1D song sound like she wrote it ugh, incredible

**fluviusfluit** (8): Her mind with this one

**WaffleWhales** (8): i simp harder for Mitski than 1D

**fadedblue09** (7.5): It’s…nice, but I absolutely detest 1D with a passion so I can’t justify giving it anything higher than this.

**andrxwzsz** (7): It's a 1D cover lmao but actually really solid

**vayyiqra** (4): okay but why

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Probably my favourite song off this album, it’s more toned down than most tracks on this album, but it’s got that same charisma. I first heard this from Gossip Girl, and I loved it almost instantly.

**TiltControls** (10): I love the energy St. Vincent puts into this song. It’s got this dreamy nature in the verses before kicking into full gear for the choruses. The lyrics are also fantastic here - “I’ve seen America with no clothes on” is a standout on the album.

---

**andrxwzsz** (10): The live version is a bit better but that goes for most of these

**bbfan132** (10): “i’ve seen america with no clothes on” is a god-tier line

**bespectacIed** (10): Women being fed up of societal expectations, *saweetie voice* "that's my type!" (see also mitski - townie, lucy dacus - i don't wanna be funny anymore)

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): I! I! I! I! IIIIIII DON'T WANNA SEE THIS NOT AT LEAST IN THE TOP 15 NO MORE

**jexan13** (10): I-I-I don't wanna be a clown leader, no more

**plastichaxan** (10): one of her best in every way, lyrically, sonically...just a masterpiece yup

**thunderbird\_14** (10): That boom moment leading to the chorus? chef’s kiss

**waluigiest** (10): OMI outsold

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): The way that chorus hits is stunning

**1998tweety** (9): chorus slaps

**slimboyfriend** (9): this song makes me feel like I'm waking up from the trance of a mystical forest witch

**Steelstepladder** (9): I- I- I- I-I think that I found myself a cheerleader

**wavingwolves** (9): wow ended omi's career!

**skargardin** (8): oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader

**bulforster** (7.5): A reliable formula for a good St. Vincent song is contrasting Annie's uncannily controlled voice with a frenetic element in the instrumental but in this song everything is a bit too methodical. It's still good though.

**ariiaaaa** (7.2): I love the synths and the drums in the bass here

**akanewasright** (7): This kind of slaps

**fadedblue09** (7): I personally believe the message of the song would’ve been better executed but I do love how the chorus goes off.

**letsallpoo** (7): almost as good as omi's

**minha1234** (6): forgettable

**vayyiqra** (4): You know the movie But I'm a Cheerleader that's about a lesbian girl that gets sent to a conversion therapy camp and it's a surreal but funny satire about gender roles? It has nothing to do with this song but it's a good movie. I saw it randomly on TV one night and since then I've seen it a couple of times and even wrote a review of it once for the school paper. I am saying this because I have nothing to add about this song which has good lyrics but is really boring.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): A great introduction to the album. I can never get sick of this song, and even though it’s almost 7 minutes long, it’s such an experience of a track that its length doesn’t even matter.

**TiltControls** (10): What a way to open an album! Just that opening guitar is enough to sell me on the song, but even from there it keeps going. The chorus hits especially really hard. I’m glad it managed to get into the top 10 despite not being a single.

---

**jman457** (11): Lana's Best Song by Far!!

**akanewasright** (10): Her lead vocals sounding as rough around the edges as she does (imo) improves the song. I love the backing vocals, I love the fucked up lyrics, I love the production... this is the perfect opener to this album.

**bbfan132** (10): the perfect intro. love the psychedelic guitar tone here

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this makes me feel like i'm a beautiful protagonist in a very dramatic movie that isn't actually about anything but it's beautifully shot and i brood a lot in it

**jexan13** (10): sis I swear, it totally hits different after the 15th listen

**skargardin** (10): what an opener yes ma'am

**WaffleWhales** (10): Lana’s best.

**waluigiest** (10): I played this album in my car all the time in high school so the intro is super nostalgic and fantastic for me

**wavingwolves** (10): perfect opening song and my favourite song on the album at time of release

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.2): amazing opener to the album

**andrxwzsz** (9): More songs like this please, Lana

**1998tweety** (8.5): I love Lana's longest songs but this is kind of a doozy to open the album with.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I think this is the point where Lana's music finally matched up with her image. I think the late 60s electric stoner production suits her more than the sampled strings and stiff beats from before

**CarlieScion** (8): im finally haaaaaappy now that youre gone < 3

**Steelstepladder** (8): Probably one of the better songs on the album but it really doesn't have to be six and a half minutes.

**ariiaaaa** (7): I love the guitar here, this reminds me a lot of INXS' Welcome to Wherever You Are

**freav** (7): some cool stuff going on here but Lana's songs already feel longer than they are so this is a bit much.

**vayyiqra** (7): I like women and Lana likes red dresses what else is new

**bulforster** (5): I like this song at first but it does not need to be this long, I feel like it wants to stop twice before it's finally over.

**fadedblue09** (4): It’s only the first song and my patience is already tested. Her voice in the chorus sounds like an old hag attempting to sing, and the instrumental is really grating.

**bespectacIed** (2): first song & i'm bored already

**wavingwolves** (10): this is probably the most captiving song in this album for me

**1998tweety** (9): When the song switched up in the 2nd half, love that

**bulforster** (9): The rich textural haze of this song lets it get away with being downtempo, which Once More to See You and Thursday Girl don't fully manage.

**Steelstepladder** (9): When that organ comes in... perfection

**freav** (8.5): nothing like some good self sabotage

**andrxwzsz** (8): Some of the most haunting lyrics ever

**fadedblue09** (8): Not really much of a highlight for me, but the instrumental is still very nice.

**vayyiqra** (5): This is why I am glad I like cats instead.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Ok like every other track on this album, it’s great. The tune is good, the arrangement is good, and even the male backing vocals are good. It’s amazing lol.

**TiltControls** (9): This song has so many great lines - “Well my boyfriend’s pretty cool, but he’s not as cool as me”.is a fantastic one. Lana has that gorgeous airy vocal here that she’s known for. The background vocals kicking in is a great high point for the song, I just wish the instrumentation picked up a little more to match it. Regardless, it’s still a fantastic song.

---

**1998tweety** (10): The story behind this song is actually quite sad, made me like it more tbh.

**bbfan132** (10): tuwalking ‘bout that newer nation

**CarlieScion** (10): i too get down to beat poetry

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): my jazz collection isnt rare bc it's literally just cheek to cheek

**cocosairdep** (10): This one is actually tied in first place with Ultraviolence for me. I mean, “I get high on hydroponic weed” and “Yeah, my boyfriend’s pretty cool/ But he’s not as cool as me” are my favourite lines in the whole album. However, I know this one will get more 11s, so I had to make U1travio1ence happen.

**hunnybee12** (10): maybe my favorite lana song of all time, in any other rate my 11. filled with peak lanaisms

**plastichaxan** (10): what does it say about me that this is one of lana's most relatable songs to me

**vayyiqra** (10): A hipster anthem. I love when Lana is clearly being ironic with her lyrics, i.e. most of the time.

**wavingwolves** (10): "the freedom land of the seventies" freedom for who? you surely seem to be proving others right. this still bops tho even with that line

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this makes me oddly sad

**minha1234** (9.7): masterpiece, iconic

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): This song is exactly what people who've only ever seen pictures of lana think her music is like

**akanewasright** (9): I love this song so much.

**kappyko** (9): lovely guitar work here

**skargardin** (9): the chorus UGH such an earworm

**WaffleWhales** (9): Lana took one glance at the BtD critics and made something sweet for the kids with this one

**andrxwzsz** (8): Pretentious in the best way?

**slimboyfriend** (8): I can't completely tell if she's being serious, or if it's she's being self-aware, or doing satire... but u know that's art

**Steelstepladder** (7): Another song I would like more if it was two minutes shorter. I'm not opposed to long songs but if a song is nearing six minutes you gotta really start to change things up around minute five. Sucks because I all the parts individually are great. Easy 10 if it was four minutes.

**ariiaaaa** (4): instrumental track when?

**bulforster** (4): I get(/hope) that it's a bit tongue-in-cheek, but these lyrics are still pretty cringey.

**fadedblue09** (1): People tell me this is supposed to be satire and I’m like bitch where? There’s an idea here, but she’s clearly more fixated on the superficial details to make it work. In the end, I can’t tell whether she’s satirical or not, and those songs just piss me off (her annoying tone in the chorus doesn’t help).

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Yeah, this should’ve replaced *Guns and Roses*. It fits the grimy vibe of the album a bit better.

**TiltControls** (10): Should have been on the main album instead of Guns and Roses. Everything about this song is what I want when I hear Lana. Great instrumentation, wistful lyrics, and an absolutely killer vocal performance. Even if this was in the main rate I would have still given it a 10 among stronger competition. It really is that good.

---

**1998tweety** (10): fuck me this song is soooo good, easily better than half of the album.

**hunnybee12** (10): why was this a target deluxe whyyyy I love playful lana

**jexan13** (10): If I had to make a rating of ALL bonus tracks, this would be the best of them all probably. Seriously, the guitars are so catchy, the atmosphere is amazing and dark, the melody is great and the chorus is just pop-perfection. I would go bald if Chemtrails Over The Country Club has a sound like this.

**andrxwzsz** (9): Should've been a standard or non-exclusive deluxe track, it's one of her best songs

**bbfan132** (8.5): love how raw this is

**bespectacIed** (8): yeah it was stupid not to include this on the standard version

**wavingwolves** (8): the instrumental is too drowned out but i still like this quite a lot. the guitar riff is so addicting!!

**freav** (7.6): rock and roll music with guitars

**CreepyMannequin** (6.5): This would have made a cuter closer

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): sorry i don't get the love for this song, this is just some noise-guitar with swoony lana vocals

**vayyiqra** (5): Um I thought I was a Lana fan and had heard Ultraviolence dozens of times but somehow never heard this song in my life. Or maybe I have but don't remember it, idk. Either way, it's okay but doesn't go anywhere.

**fadedblue09** (4): Nice try, but Norah Jones did it better.

**survivorjdmarina** (11): Yeah, this was definitely going to be my 11. Its my favourite Lana song ever. Its beginning guitar chords set the tone pretty well for the rest of the track, and through its almost six minutes, it croons in a way only some Lana tracks can. Also, that fucking guitar solo?! Unreal. Thank you Dan Auerbach for this.

**TiltControls** (8.5): Lana gives a captivating performance here. Her vocals are infectious and the lyrics fit the tone of the album. With the strength of the competition personally there are a few other tracks I like more, but it’s easy to see why this is such a favourite among her fans.

---

**1998tweety** (11): One of my all-time fav Lana songs ugh this is just so damn good. THAT BREAKDOWN good lorde. Everything about this is immaculate

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): this is... her best song

**minha1234** (11): euphoric chorus, amazing instrumentals, just a beautiful track overall. this is what got me to explore Lana's discography

**bbfan132** (10): the second half of this song is glorious

**bespectacIed** (10): This is magnificent. Lana's voice, the song's atmosphere, the instrumentation, especially the guttural guitar solo bridge, the cinematic MV, all perfect. What I feel about this song is the same strong feeling that diehard Lana stans have with her discography, but nothing comes close to the greatness of Shades of Cool except Off to the Races

**brenda\_official** (10): lana’s boyfriend is a cop that is not cool

**mudkip1** (10): and that's that on that

**wavingwolves** (10): this is just halsey's colors older and cooler sister

**jexan13** (9.5): if there's an artist, band, or whatever that sounds like this, DM it to me immediatly

**cocosairdep** (8.7): Should have been a Bond theme. Such a missed opportunity.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): As a previous Lana hater, when this song came out right before the album I tried my hardest to hate it.... but here we are

**akanewasright** (8): This just sounds like a perfect Bond theme. I hope she fucking apologizes for her insensitivity and then does one of those soon.

**andrxwzsz** (8): One of her coolest songs

**kappyko** (8): this might win!

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a vibe

**WaffleWhales** (8): i don’t really stan aging republican men as an aesthetic in the MV but that’s antithetical to liking Lana’s music

**Steelstepladder** (7): When this song reaches it's climax it's great. Bit of a chore to get there though

**bulforster** (6.5): I love the chorus and guitar solo but the verses aren't doing much for me.

**freav** (6.5): i do kinda like how haunting these verses are

**ariiaaaa** (4): I love the guitars but I really hate the way Lana sings which just ruins her work for me.

**fadedblue09** (0): Dear lord, what a fucking ordeal. Every exaggerated utterance she makes irritates me to no end, plus you have that guitar solo which is one of the tormenting noises I’ve ever heard (like the outro to Charli XCX’s Click). It’s as if she distilled everything I dislike about this album in one song. Brilliant.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): A very good introduction to the album! It’s pretty simplistic for this album, but it’s so addicting and beautifully arranged that simplicity means nothing. Ok miss Mitski!

**TiltControls** (10): Though I absolutely love many of the tracks, this has got to be my favourite on the album. The heavy guitars and the constant beating drive the song nearly into unsettling territories. And that closing sax is absolute perfection! Not to mention one of the most chilling music videos of the 2010’s.

---

**brenda\_official** (11): i have been known to listen to this song 20 times in one day

**plastichaxan** (11): this brings an emotion that no other song brings for me, i think it's one of the clearest elevens i've given, even if the other two albums had a contender each.

**andrxwzsz** (10): Beautiful, tragic

**astrologicalangel** (10): first song I listened to and has been stuck in my head ever since

**bbfan132** (10): the kick drum glitching out at the end is the best part of this entire album

**bespectacIed** (10): the mental gymnastics mitski had to do just to say "happiness fucks you up so why bother trying". One of mitski's finest songs, and her #1 best MV

**bulforster** (10): When the bright guitar and drums break in after the first warped sax solo? chef's kiss

**CarlieScion** (10): and i felt happy come inside me .... this song live is so good ugh

**cremeebrulee** (10): wow i fucking love this ... prob my favorite new discovery other than cruel

**freav** (10): what a way to open an album, a masterclass in song-building, truly. I love this moment after the saxophone solo when all the instruments kick in and you notice how fucking smooth the verse melody is, and then the chorus comes back with such power

**jexan13** (10): this gave me wrong expectations. As always, Mitski openers are incredible.

**mudkip1** (10): the music video is an absolute serve and elevates the song to a whole other level

**RandomHypnotica** (10): ❤️Happy❤️ came to visit me 🏡 he bought 💰 cookies 🍪 on the way 🚶‍♂️. I poured him tea ☕️ and he told me 💁‍♂️ it’ll all be okay 👌. Well, I told him 💁‍♀️ I’d do anything 😯 to have him 👨 stay with me 👩‍❤️‍👨, so he laid me down 🛌 🙇‍♂ ️and I felt ❤️Happy❤️ cum 🍆 💦 💦 inside 🌮 of me. He laid me down 🛌 🙇‍♂️, and I felt Happy 😊

**slimboyfriend** (10): She said, "I'm gonna write an allegory where I fuck happy but he ends up fucking ME in the end."

**Steelstepladder** (10): What a fucking intro! Oh no my bias is gonna come out on this album.

**WaffleWhales** (10): miss mitski y’all

**waluigiest** (10): I FELT HAPPY COME INSIDE OF ME

**wavingwolves** (10): this is one of the best opening tracks i know and one of her best by far

**akanewasright** (9): This is a perfect album opener.

**fluviusfluit** (9): What other opener is like this

**fadedblue09** (8.7): Takes a while to build up, but once the horns kick in, it doesn’t look back.

**thunderbird\_14** (8.5): When she said, ‘When Happy Come Visit Me” I never knew she could articulate the feelings I could muster whenever the claps of Pharell Williams bring me to a field of nostalgia wrecked by disconnect in these trying times. Best opener tbh

**1998tweety** (8): Takes a minute to go off but when it does it does

**cocosairdep** (8): The only song I truly enjoyed at all first listen in the whole album.

**ariiaaaa** (7.8): bold drum machine, bold lyrics

**sandyfishnets** (7.5): oh boy strap in we're in for an emotional trip

**vayyiqra** (4): This is giving me a headache and causing anxiety.

**purplechilipepper** (0): reminds me of the mid 2000s pseudo beatles revival in the indie scene and I dont like

Otherwise I bet on losing dogs moves to 6th, surgeon moves to 14th, and Neutered fruit goes to 30th. Same songs gone on same days, same top 10, same top 5.

CritneySpearz: Hi, is this not allowed?  I did not purposefully try to sabotage or "play favoritism".  I actually had never heard either Puberty 2 (minus 1 song) or Strange Mercy and I rated them truly to what I felt, regardless of my feelings towards Lana's album.  Neither clicked at at all really, minus a few songs from each album.  Should I just refrain from submitting my scores in the future if I have such lopsided scores?  Genuinely curious, thanks!  And FWIW, I do even have one of Mitski's songs rated above Lana's!
[/r/popheads/comments/ijknq7/women_who_rock_rate_reveal_day_3_ooh_baby_ooh/g3eyglb/]

=====

TiltControls: Usually there is a certain average that hosts will enforce, to avoid possibilities of sabotage. Especially if there is a disparity with one of the other albums (which i think was the issue in your case)

That's why I take a bit of blame here cause I probably should have let you know before the reveal so you could be a bit kinder in scoring instead of removing them outright. Sometimes people just don't like certain albums in rates, which is fair! So if that's the case sorry you're getting caught in the crossfire a bit here.
[/r/popheads/comments/ijknq7/women_who_rock_rate_reveal_day_3_ooh_baby_ooh/g3ezkkb/]

CritneySpearz: Yeah, that makes sense.  I don't think I've ever had a rate where I genuinely just didn't like 2/3 of the albums, but I will definitely just not submit if that happens again lol.  Thank you for clarifying, my apologies for the apparent outrage I may have caused!

Mudkip1: i wouldn't say it's not 'allowed', but usually rate hosts don't accept submissions if they can tell that the user was intentionally trying to imbalance the results of the rate. when i hosted a rate and saw scores that seemed strange i usually just messaged them to ask about it.

and no, i wouldn't refrain from participating! be honest with your scores, i just assumed this was something done intentionally to sabotage those two artists. hope this makes a lil sense

**survivorjdmarina** (10): That PACE CHANGE!!!!! It caught me so off guard when I first listened to it, and it still manages to get me every time. The closest we’ve gotten to a Lana bop to be honest.

**TiltControls** (10): Possibly surprising to many, Lana is the first one eliminated from the rate. But damn this is a fantastic song to end with. The way that Lana masterfully sets the energy of the song works so so well. That breakdown into the chorus is just perfection and also when it picks back up into the verses again. In an album filled with strong songs I definitely understand why this one was rated as the best of hers

---

**astrologicalangel** (11): perfection

**cremeebrulee** (11): to me this song is so smooth and so timeless and there's nothing i would change about it. this is one of my top tracks of all time so i had to give it my 11 even though i know it's not gonna win sadly :(

**jexan13** (11): A no-brainer for my 11. NOTHING sounds like this. NOTHING comes close. From the first drum pattern and the bouncy bass, it just transports me away. It feels like Ride's brother, and just like her, this is a trip: I become a beautiful american girl, with latina roots, riding my convertible through Florida coasts, seeing how a lot of boys look at me like the sexy goddess I am; but I don't care about them, as their bank accounts are too small and their remaining lifespans too big. Then the bouncy beat collapses into an other-wordly beautiful chorus and my world becomes gray, for even tho I no longer have to worry about working, I still don't have HIM. I still grieve, until the final notes end, and I return to my poor awkward male self with no American Visa. I grieve a bit more.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Everything about this song is fantastic, the gradual build up in the pre-chours, the dramatic shift when it eventually hits, the instrumental UGH, so good. And I feel like overall it really captures the spirit of UV.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): this song has so much stuff that’s w r o n g (“he’s crazy and cubano como yo”???) but I can’t help but eat this shit up

**SFbby** (11): West Coast Best Coast

**waluigiest** (11): My favorite memory of this song is that once my friend was a little drunk and asleep and when I started playing this song she air drummed the intro drum fill in her sleep

**1998tweety** (10): Mega bop, love the switch up in the chorus. I wanna swaying on the beach to this.

**akanewasright** (10): This song is just majestic. I love the drum beat of the verses, the guitar licks, the hazed out vibe of the chorus, and of course, that glorious synth line at the end. One of Lana’s best songs.

**bbfan132** (10): i remember spending an entire day in 2015 studying lana’s lyrics (i was only 14 so i didn’t understand a lot of it) and i spent the most time reading up on “queens of saigon”… just felt like mentioning that

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): THE song that got me to stop hating lana after i hated born to die (and still hate half of it but that's another rant)

**didney-worl** (10): this almost was my 11

**WaffleWhales** (10): bilingual queen (again)!

**wavingwolves** (10): yeah, this is this album's true 11

**plastichaxan** (9.5): the way this made me cry doing this rate ugh i hate her why is her music so good and she's like that

**CarlieScion** (9): my SOTS in 2014 lmaoooo

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Oooo... she's got vibes...

**andrxwzsz** (8): A banger of a single

**letsallpoo** (8): i really hope this isn't the highest-ranking track from this album

**kappyko** (7): the transition is still very unsatisfying

**vayyiqra** (7): I want to like this song but the tempo changes feel messy but it has good moments.

**minha1234** (6.6): never got the hype

**freav** (6.3): I like that the verses of this song switch things up a little, but damn I wish they were doing something more interesting

**Steelstepladder** (5): I really don't like that echo effect on the guitar in the chorus. This song also feels way way way too slow to achieve the desired effect.

**bulforster** (3): The choruses are the saving graces of the better tracks on this album but the worst part of this one.

**fadedblue09** (1.5): So if she's not singing like a tortured banshee, she's whisper-singing? Does this album have a single normal song?

**bespectacIed** (1): i don't get the adoration, this is legit her worst lead. This only went downhill after that delicious drum/guitar intro

CataKala: They should’ve been kicked out for sure. I’m a huge Lana stan but when I do these rates I always listen to all the albums in full and try to be veryyyy objective. I posted somewhere else I feel bad giving anything lower than a 5, so it was crazy for me to see them ranking so many songs SO low.

CritneySpearz: Hi!  Sorry if you feel I was purposefully tanking the scores! I explained in another comment, I truly just did not "get" most of the songs from either albums, Puberty 2 and Strange Mercy.  I tried to listen to each album on different days to avoid direct comparison and avoid bias.  It seems silly to not rate songs below a 5 if you don't enjoy them at all, I mean isn't that why there is a ranking from 0-10?  Is it considered a "faux paus" to give multiple scores in a rate below a 5?  I don't do rates too often, so genuinely curious :)

=====

CataKala: Hey!! I read your explanation down below and I totally get it. I definitely misjudged you and I apologize for that! I don’t think it’s a faux pas at all to rate how you truly feel, and if that falls below a 5, so be it. 

For me, I just feel (admittedly irrationally) guilty, like I’m shitting on songs that so many people enjoy. But then I come here and see people giving some of my favorite songs wayyyy below 5, sometimes even 0. I didn’t really get those two albums either but it’s so hard for me to give anything a really low score because I feel like there has to be something good there if so many others love it. 😂 So honestly this has been a wake up call for me that it’s okay to give something a 1 or 2 if that’s how I feel. 

And I’m pretty sure I have given songs below a 5 before, just always feels bad doing so.

=====

CritneySpearz: No you're totally fine, if I was an outside party I can see how it would be a little suspicious.  That does make sense though, I was seeing all the Mitski love during the reveal and felt a bit guilty since nobody else was giving such low scores lol.  I think maybe I need to listen to albums 3-4 times each in the future to give them more accurate scores, as maybe I was a little bit too harsh!

survivorjdmarina: # Ultraviolence

---

**Overall Average**: 7.590 **// Average Controversy:** 2.010

---

**survivorjdmarina** (9.536): If you didn’t already know, this is my favourite album of all time. This is, in my opinion, Lana’s creative peak as a music artist, and the craftsmanship and detailing of this album is spectacular. The album means so much to me, and I can listen to this without ever getting sick of it. I struggled to not give almost every track here a 10. Hell, I even did a writeup for it earlier this year, if that gives any indication on why and how much I love this album lol., Ultraviolence, was an interesting scoring experience for me. There were plenty of songs on it I absolutely loved (Cruel World, West Coast, and Black Beauty especially), but there was (imo) also some filler that could have been cut down too (mostly in the back-half of the album). Even a few of the songs themselves could maybe have been a minute or two shorter. Regardless of my criticisms, this is still an overall fantastic album and it’s easy to see why it’s many fans’ favourite.

---
**didney-worl** (9.179): lots of memories, what an album

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.629): the way this is still lana's best album... iconic

**cremeebrulee** (8.500): this is kinda unfair because UV is one of my fave albums ever and i'm incredibly attached to it even if lana continues to disappoint me. west coast somehow managed to be one of my spotify top 5 tracks last year so there's no question this is gonna be the frontrunner for my scores so im not excited to see lana get melodrama'd again lol.

**jexan13** (8.357): The worst best Lana album. A very good sound that sadly falls flat at times with some boring filler in the middle. It is a total grower tho, and holds some of the best songs of her career (yes, I know, that can be said about everyone of her albums)

**CarlieScion** (8.357): one of the first albums i ever got on vinyl so u know i was a Tumblr KidTM

**wavingwolves** (8.286): this album feels like a time machine that brings me back directly to 2014, when i was getting through the ugliest breakup of my life. i almost feel like i can't see this album objectively because it just feels like part of my story. the one criticism i can give is that the vocals can be way too muffled and drowned at times, and so can the instrumentals. it can feel a little like aesthetic over music, but the songwriting is still great and hits me where it counts.

**skargardin** (8.143): On a good day this is by far my favorite Lana album but it's pretty neck and neck with NFR to be honest. The atmosphere of this album is completely unmatched though, not a single skip was found.

**vayyiqra** (8.000): When this album came out, I admit I kind of slept on it. I loved Born to Die so much, and the drastic change in sound threw me off; plus it seemed like Pitchfork bait to me, and I don't tend to like music like that (i.e. indie pop/rock that I find is usually really boring). I'm so glad I gave it another chance because it really grew on me. It's maybe a little overlong but the songwriting is very strong and I would put it in the high tier of Lana's albums. I still like Born to Die more though, and she will never quite top it to me, but I think it's the best album in the rate by far.

**plastichaxan** (7.879): I'll be honest, I'm not one to revisit albums too much, I'll listen a couple of times and the couple I listened to this I loved it so much, revisiting a few years after isn't the same, either my taste has changed a bit or her controversy has put me off a bit, cause it has happened to a lot of other musicians for me, so, idk, I remember this being sooo much better :(

**lambeosaura** (7.857): This was my favourite Lana album until NFR came out and with good reason – the album is a cohesive, dark and beautifully realized album about tragic romance and loss with a signature Californian touch that we are now used to from her. Her debut album was poorly received, but this album seems like a clarion call – that she takes her art seriously and is here to stay. Dan Aeurbach’s production creates a wistful ambience that does not let up until the very end of the album. The second half falls flat, but the first half of the album is among the best that pop rock has to offer.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.657): Ultraviolence is one of my least favourite Lana projects, but there's still some solid enjoyment to be had here, and listening to it again in this rate made me enjoy it a little more

**QueenBeysus** (7.179): This album is TOO LONG

**andrxwzsz** (7.000): Some of her best, some of her worst (7/10)

**WaffleWhales** (6.786): Legitimately some of Lana’s best work. The second half and deluxe tracks seriously detract from this album, but the first half is second only to NFR in her discography despite the low average I have for this. Haunting writing and instrumentals.

**slimboyfriend** (6.714): Sometimes the songs get stuck in the same old Lana tropes of "I'm a bad girl/sad girl/I like bad boys/daddies/whatever" but sometimes the songs are GOOD. The instrumentals are vastly better than her vocals. The first five songs and Black Beauty are excellent.

**brenda\_official** (6.357): the 2nd best lana album, the 2nd best in the rate

**freav** (6.307): Yeah unfortunately I don't get much out of this. These songs are not like bad or anything, but nothing ever stands out and the dreamy blur it turns into is not particularly compelling for me

**akanewasright** (5.857): This was always my favorite Lana album, and I decided not to sabotage my scores for this. I haven’t forgiven her for her comments, but I really loved this album and while I don’t want to listen to it again, I can rate the standard edition by memory. I also have a firm belief that the standard edition tells a pretty simple, cohesive story, and the deluxe tracks are just tacked on at the end.

**Steelstepladder** (5.786): I almost didn't do this rate because this album just isn't very good. After three songs in I feel like I've experienced all the album has to offer. And these songs are sooooo long and all sound like each other to the point where I often can't tell where one song ends and the next begins.

**ariiaaaa** (4.857): i'm not a huge fan of lana del ray, but I am excited to give this a shot

**bespectacIed** (4.000): The instruments are gorgeous. Lana's voice is clear and beautiful. This album is boring and sonically repetitive as fuck

**fadedblue09** (3.986): Yeah, I hated it. I went into this album expecting to finally “get” Lana, and somehow ended up hating her more. Maybe it’s because I prefer simplicity, but her album comes off as superficial compared to the other two. Also, Lana’s music and I just feel like….universes apart. Her songs exude a lifestyle that is very American, lavish and somewhat exclusive, and frankly, I couldn’t bring myself to care about it. Her music just doesn’t speak to me, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Sorry.

**bulforster** (3.821): NFR was my first full Lana album and I really liked a lot of it, so I went into this one optimistic having heard it was her best a lot. I did not enjoy it. Her moany vocals drenched in reverb over these lumbering instrumentals combine into musical sludge that's a struggle to get through and honestly made it hard to score because it's easier to figure out how much you like rather than dislike a song.

**TiltControls** (11): Everything about this song is just perfection, but what really drives it up is that killer guitar line. There were so many great songs to choose from in this rate, but I kept coming back to this song, getting it stuck in my head, constantly thinking about it, etc. At that point I had to give it my 11. Even though it didn’t even come close to winning the rate I can’t be that mad given the quality of these albums.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Yeah, this is an earworm, you cannot deny that. This was always in a pretty solid place throughout the rate, although it was sometimes pushed off second place by West Coast. It’s a really great song so it deserves its placement.

---

**slimboyfriend** (11): idk what it means but it's a banger!

**akanewasright** (10): I love this. Holy shit. I love this. This is the Annie fell in love with on MASSEDUCTION. Maybe she’s not as open about her feelings here, but this sounds like another Los Ageless.

**andrxwzsz** (10): Perfect, nothing else to say really...

**bbfan132** (10): the video for this song is spectacular, it’s a 10 even without it but it makes the song 100x better

**bespectacIed** (10): Feminism!!! What a brilliant, scathing commentary on womanhood. That guitar riff is what makes the song topnotch, but the way annie pronounces cruel "crawl" is the flavor

**bulforster** (10): Immaculate. The only true competition for my 11. The chorus is obviously an incredible earworm and I feel like I could listen to it forever, the growling guitar solo is a nice counterpoint to the clarity of Annie's voice and I love the plucky outro and the alarm noise that overwhelms it at the very end but my favourite part is the breathless bridge where the desperation that enters her voice after the flare line gives me chills.

**CarlieScion** (10): [insert joke about cruel summer]

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): one of the most iconic guitar solos in my opinion

**cremeebrulee** (10): oh this is a bop

**didney-worl** (10): another potential 11

**fadedblue09** (10): Love how the seemingly cheery and majestic instrumental contrasts with the lyrics! The guitar riff is also super catchy.

**fluviusfluit** (10): If this is not in the top 3 we are cancelling popheads

**freav** (10): absolute banger, her best song maybe

**hunnybee12** (10): makes me want to punch someone

**jexan13** (10): Well, can't deny she SNAPPED here. This should be Cruel feat. Sexy Guitar.

**minha1234** (10): immaculate bop

**mudkip1** (10): BOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**skargardin** (10): Now this is a banger

**Steelstepladder** (10): Best song on the album

**wavingwolves** (10): ...casually cruel in the name of being honest?

**worlds-okayest666** (10): came very close to being my 11

**cocosairdep** (9.5): This song blew my mind. Also, the music video makes the song even better for me.

**thunderbird\_14** (9.5): The latter half is so unsettling, it might be the best sonic moment among all these albums.

**waluigiest** (9): the guitar here is so fun

**1998tweety** (8.5): Love the production on this

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): I forgot want this song was called and I thought she was singing "Crawl" lol

**WaffleWhales** (8): Happy by Mistki vibes

**vayyiqra** (5): This has some nice energy and cinematic-sounding strings but that distorted crunchy guitar can go.

survivorjdmarina: # Strange Mercy

---

**Overall Average**: 7.734 **// Average Controversy:** 1.706

---

**survivorjdmarina** (9.045): This is a very interesting album for St. Vincent for sure, and it deserves all the acclaim it gets. It’s very raw and unpolished, while also very idiosyncratic and crazy. That album cover is horrid though lol., I was surprised how much I actually enjoyed Strange Mercy once I really got into it. St. Vincent does have a bit of an issue with either unrelatable or unintelligible lyrics at times, but too often the amazing instrumentation kept me distracted enough to ultimately enjoy a majority of the songs on the album.

---
**kappyko** (10.000): sorry for being biased but GOAT album lol

**andrxwzsz** (9.818): A near-perfect album and probably my favorite of all time (10/10)

**didney-worl** (9.773): Annie Clark is a wizard

**plastichaxan** (8.782): Everytime I'm more convinced this is St. Vincent's best album so far

**slimboyfriend** (8.591): This album really brings out my inner indie art rock heaux. Love the psychosexual tension under each song. Sometimes I don't 100% know what St. Vincent is singing about, but that's most of the appeal for me.

**freav** (8.473): Annie has a super consistent catalog, but this is probably my favorite album of hers, a great collection of songs with an extremely personal and distinctive guitar sound

**bespectacIed** (8.364): This is a gorgeous sounding, well-written, very feminist take on depression from st. vincent. Took me a while to really get into it compared to her other more accessible albums, but I get why this is considered her best album. The centerpiece of this album really are the guitars, they're all so fucking lush and complex for each song. Annie being the most talented guitarist of our generation is an understatement

**thunderbird\_14** (8.227): I now realize why many love this woman’s guitar work. Every final section of each song is also a-ma-zing. It’s so enchanting that as a full body of work, this one would far surpass the others (even if I like other tracks better). And I can’t wait for her to have the highest album average, oh boy!

**QueenBeysus** (7.955): The fave album of my 16 year old self

**jexan13** (7.818): St. Vincent is one of my favorite artists and I've gone throught all her solo albums. But from all of them, Strange Mercy is undoubtfuly... the worst. Yes, even worse than the not-so-appreciated-by-pop-fans debut. Of course, the album is enjoyable and it has its brilliant moments, but... the album starts with an amazing four-songs-run with such a high energy, and the rest... just blends together. Plus, the highs are low, compared to her other albums. Damn.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.455): Going into this rate, I didn't expect to enjoy this album that much, but I was really pleasantly surprised by it.

**lambeosaura** (7.273): I had difficulty adjusting to this album’s song structure, as I don’t listen to much rock at all – what makes this album soar is the incredible finesse that St. Vincent plays the guitar with. This was a great album but I guess I will need to sit with it for longer to appreciate it.

**skargardin** (7.273): I wish I had more to say about this project but it doesn't really spark anything in me at all? It sounds kinda samey throughout the whole thing and never really goes anywhere. It completely plateaus after Northering Lights for me. Not that I don't enjoy it but it does blend together a lot.

**wavingwolves** (7.273): feels a little too heavy at times but it's still pretty enjoyable. the guitars in this are probably the best part of it.

**Steelstepladder** (7.273): If you don't like blown out distortion you must really hate this. I love the rawness and lack of polish in some areas though. Not expecting a great showing but hopefully a few tracks hold out.

**fadedblue09** (7.227): Hmm...I can see that this album leans towards the art pop side of things, and I think it’s the best album here from a production standpoint. That being said, a lot of the songs tend to over-rely on the sound while the lyrics come off as too vague and empty to make an impression and it took me a while to “get” most of the songs. Despite that, I do appreciate its themes and messages, and I understand why a lot of people would love it.

**brenda\_official** (6.909): St. Vincent's 4th best, the worst in this rate

**cremeebrulee** (6.636): this is my first time with this album and the third st. vincent album i listened to in its entirety and i think she's just always gonna be hit or miss for me. when i like a song from here it's on repeat FOREVER (los ageless / digital witness / and i see cruel joining that list) but everything else is kind of forgettable to me. regardless, this is the album/artist i have the least familiarity with so its inevitable that this might be my least favorite of the bunch.

**vayyiqra** (5.091): Look, I have Opinions about St. Vincent. I can't get into her even though she seems like my thing because she is artsy but also I've always thought she seemed pretentious somehow. Now, that's mostly just me projecting my thoughts about the hipsters I knew in college who liked her onto her which isn't really fair, but also she is frankly a little pretentious lol. This album is weird and dissonant and the lyrics are a little too obscure for my taste. I guess this album is unique at least but I wouldn't say I like it.

**sandyfishnets** (4.055): sorry Annie this album doesn't do it for me ):

**survivorjdmarina** (10): This track is unreal, and definitely deserving of the #1 spot. It also not surprising that this was always on the top throughout the whole rate, and at a large margin too. The production and lyrics here are amazing. 100% deserved.

**TiltControls** (10): This was never really a competition for Mitski. Even 25 ballots in, she had a clear 30-40 point lead over the 2nd place song and that lead only kept growing as more scores came in. As a song I love every part of it. I love that this is one of those artist songs that only they could pull off. Mitski fully commits the frustration she holds into her guitar lines vocals. It all comes together to create a cathartic and very emotional performance and easily deserves the win. Congratulations Mitski, we’ll see you in a few months for the Winner’s rate. (btw for those wondering this sits at #11 on the all time song leaderboard)

---

**bbfan132** (11): one of the most cathartic songs i’ve heard. i’ll never be able to relate to this that well but i can still feel every word she is saying and it’s brutal. easily one of my favorite songs of the 2010s

**bespectacIed** (11): Can't wait to feign surprise when this loses to a Lana song! Non-asian people will never truly understand what mitski sings about here --- the Asian self-deprecation, the desire to fit in the Western culture, the obsession for white approval, the self-hate that comes with failing to get that, the even bigger self-hate that comes after realizing how ridiculous you are for tap-dancing for them. And to top it all off, she did it in the most *white man* musical medium ever, indie rock. It's so fucking genius. Every line in this song is iconic and should be preserved for posterity. This isn't exaggeration, **this is one of the greatest songs of all time**

**bulforster** (11): My favourite artist's best song, how could it not be? This song means a lot to me as a first generation immigrant and when she sings "I do, I finally do" in the last chorus? sobbing

**CarlieScion** (11): THE CHORUS!!!!! THIS EXPLOSION!!!!! MITSKI GIRL YOU HAVE DONE IT AGAIN!!!!!!

**didney-worl** (11): song of the decade

**fadedblue09** (11): Okay, just so we’re clear, this is not the only 11-worthy song on the album. But damn, the emotional punch this one has.

**freav** (11): what is there to say about this one? one of the best songs ever written, the way it just fucking explodes in the chorus is fucking unmatched

**hunnybee12** (11): i’ve only done a handful of rates but this was definitely the hardest rate to pick an 11 yet. but there are few things in existence that make me as emotional as this song

**letsallpoo** (11): i'm lonely

**mudkip1** (11): pop perfection

**skargardin** (11): The layers in this song ugh how can you not stan? The slow buildup into the explosive second half of the song, the impeccable lyricism ugh she really did that.

**Steelstepladder** (11): Top 10 songs of my lifetime

**thunderbird\_14** (11): Was there any doubt that this wouldn’t win? Let’s raise our goal to have this beat Mariah’s record

**wavingwolves** (11): this is just wishful thinking and longing to be seen and loved in song format

**worlds-okayest666** (11): the sheer emotion in this song is stunning. one of my favorite things about mitski's music is how passionate it is, and how you can FEEL the emotion in her voice when she sings, and this song is a perfect example of that. i'm bad at putting my thoughts into words but god i just love this song

**1998tweety** (10): Almost gave my 11 to this, as a child of immigrants I gotta just say that this song hits differently.

**akanewasright** (10): Absolutely stunning.

**andrxwzsz** (10): Oh, it hurts so damn good

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is gonna be her highest song and probably get knocked out earlier than it deserves, but GOD this is just such a wonderful burst of energy and feeling an heartbreak and another 11 contender

**fluviusfluit** (10): I considered giving this the 11 because I think it has a high chance of winning the rate but my love for I Bet on Losing Dogs prevailed

**minha1234** (10): I really debated between this and Shades of Cool for the 11 but I wouldn't be mad if it got 1st place. Too relatable and overall just an amazing sound

**slimboyfriend** (10): big spoon problems :///

**WaffleWhales** (10): Amy Tan has to go into hiding after this one

**plastichaxan** (9.3): i regret ever asking why people consider this one of her best songs

**jexan13** (8.5): I really don't want this to win over Annie's and Lana's finest. I think that verses and prechorus are good, but the chorus is so abrasive and sounds like everything from this album and from BMAMC.

**cremeebrulee** (8): this is probably the winner and honestly i can't be mad about it (even as a lana stan) the message of this song is incredibly relatable and i love that is feels so short even as 3 minute song (kinda on the longer end for mitski). i think my only fault with it is that the instrumental overpowers mitski's vocals in the chorus

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): Honestly, this song never really connected with me like it seemed to for many others, I enjoyed it, but there's definitely better from Mitski and even this album imo

**vayyiqra** (0): I'm going to get hated for this and giving this frontrunner for winner my 0 is, I admit, a highly chaotic move and I hesitated to do it. I just feel like this is a very overrated song. The chorus is kind of memorable, and that's it. This is probably the best song on the album though aside from Thursday Girl. I just don't vibe with it myself.

survivorjdmarina: # Puberty 2

---

**Overall Average**: 8.128 **// Average Controversy:** 1.797

---

**survivorjdmarina** (8.500): This is a very dense album! It’s similar to Strange Mercy where it’s very electric and whizzbang, but it’s got the same image-painting lyrics that Ultraviolence has. It’s a beautiful combination of both, and definitely a great album for Mitski., Though I really love some of the songs on Be the Cowboy, I think as a whole I actually enjoy Puberty 2 much more. The album is the textbook definition of short and sweet (maybe a little too much at times). Coupled with some fantastic instrumentation and relatable lyrics it deserves the 8+ average it got.

---
**WaffleWhales** (10.091): Heartbreaking album. By chance, Mitski and Puberty 2 were recommended by a friend while I was stuck at home in quarantine with “nothing ahead of me.” It so perfectly captures the feeling of confusion of growing up and the feeling of being unsure of what’s to come ahead like no other. While I won’t be moving on to the next phase of my life for a while, I’m so lucky to have discovered this lovely work. My favorite Mitski album and my second favorite album of all time (right behind Melodrama). Even if this rate does Mitski dirty, I will simply go forth with wearing my white button down and loving some littler things.

**didney-worl** (10.000): Mitski if you see this ily

**bespectacIed** (10.000): Mitski is a top 10 artist of all time for me. I've always viewed her as the female Nick Drake, except she's pretty, sexy, and has better production. No album this century has captured adult depression more intimately than the holy trinity of bury me at makeout creek, Puberty 2, and Be The Cowboy. I felt every gripe mitski has with herself and the world in Puberty 2, and she expresses them so fucking clearly that sometimes I wonder why I'm not a sad insecure amerasian girl with severe white man's whore issues

**fluviusfluit** (9.682): I feel like I was a little biased in rating the other two albums because I love Puberty 2 so much...literally a masterpiece and one of my favourite albums of all time that I will be so sad if y'all disrespect it

**morgchrist** (9.636): didn't realize this was my favorite from this group until I started to have to rate these songs. There really isn't a weak song here!

**freav** (9.191): Enough has been said about Mitski's music being sad and relatable, but I just find her to be an incredibly outstanding songwriter. Her chord progressions are not obvious but they are hard-hitting, the fuzzy guitar sound is incredible. I discovered this album the year it came out and instantly fell in love, an all time favorite for me.

**Steelstepladder** (9.091): Oops my bias really jumped out here

**fadedblue09** (8.973): My favorite album here by far. Her style of rock is raw, simple and nostalgic, reminding me a lot of mid-2000’s pop-rock (which is a genre that I live for btw). I also connected with her lyrics the most, partially because her songwriting reminds me a lot of my own faves, and also because I’m a sucker for “quarterlife crisis” albums (especially now I’m going through a similar phase as well). Thank you popheads for making me discover her.

**andrxwzsz** (8.909): Here come the tears and angst (9/10)

**wavingwolves** (8.636): this is a big comfort album for me. a lot of mitski's music is about longing and yearning for connection and this is just that overload. i can't say i don't love the shit out of it.

**slimboyfriend** (8.409): I love this album more and more each time I come back to it.

**brenda\_official** (8.273): Mitski's 3rd best, the best in this rate

**waluigiest** (8.091): I was so mad when Be the Cowboy was massacred so I’m worried for our girl Mitski in this rate :-(

**akanewasright** (8.000): I didn’t like Be The Cowboy when I did that for a rate, so I wasn’t expecting to love this as much as I did. This is EASILY the best album of the bunch in my mind, and Ultraviolence was a part of my emotional development (I’m fine)

**QueenBeysus** (7.955): Mitski's best album

**skargardin** (7.818): There's just something about Mitski's lyricism and her voice that I just can't get enough of. Puberty 2 isn't my favorite project of hers but there's still lots to enjoy here. I'm sure that some of these songs that I scored a bit lower might grow on me in the future.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.764): I definitely prefer Puberty 2 to Be the Cowboy overall, but I think Mitski is still very hit or miss for me in the end, but this album overall felt a bit more on the hit side

**ariiaaaa** (7.736): i've listened to mitski 1650 times so maybe i'm a stan

**lambeosaura** (7.591): Having only heard “Be the Cowboy” before, this album comes across as a more sorrowful meditation on mental illness and lost love. Mitski’s vocals are impassioned, urgent and sometimes more restrained. Each song creates its own ambience that is at the same time sad and beautiful. It’s amazing how she manages to create so much meaning with comparatively sparse lyrics.

**jexan13** (7.364): Oh Mitski. I absolutely loved Be The Cowboy. Like I think is a close to perfect amazing album; so colorful and cute. I imagined that her previous albums were the same... Nope. Nada. Niente. Everything blends too much, nothing feels too memorable. It failed to impress me.

**cremeebrulee** (7.182): i knew only a couple of tracks from this album before so listening to it in its entirety was interesting. there's a lot of tracks in here that i enjoy, more than be the cowboy, but i think the whiplash between the tracks and the shortness of the tracks themselves are stopping me from fully enjoying it. still i can understand why people find this to be their fave mitski album!

**cocosairdep** (6.609): I’m sorry, I really tried to like this album. I guess it’s just not for me. Or maybe I’m too dumb and it all went over my head, idk. I tried not to give it too low scores though.

**vayyiqra** (4.091): A girl I had a crush on knew I liked Lana and recommended this album to me. I heard it and didn't understand why because it sounds nothing like Lana. I have tried to get into this album probably half a dozen times and don't get it. I never remember anything from it except that one song everyone likes and the rest is just a morass of distortion and noise to me. I just Do Not Get Mitski, and that's okay.
