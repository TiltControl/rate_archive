#**Lana Del Rey - Ultraviolence**

When Lana Del Rey first released her major-label debut album, “Born to Die”, in January 2012, people were questioning her authenticity, and where she had appeared from. When the album finally came out, it gave us a glimpse into what we’d expect from her. The album itself played around with the baroque sounds of yesteryear, fused with modern hip-hop production. One of the most divisive albums of the last decade, it became noteworthy for ushering in a wave of female alternative artists, such as Lorde, Halsey and Billie Eilish. However, it wasn’t until her sophomore record where music critics started to take her more seriously.

It all started when the first single, “West Coast”, was released in April 2014. Audiences and critics were quick to note how different the single sounded to her previous work, departing from the baroque/hip-hop fusion of her first album, and instead diving into psychedelic rock and 
dream pop, for the album that would be known as “Ultraviolence”.

It was an enigmatic record for Lana, a record that was a complete 180 from what she had previously released. While “Born to Die” was polished, modern and euphoric, “Ultraviolence” was dirty, raw and vulnerable. Co-produced with Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, every song minus two (“Old Money” and “Black Beauty”) was recorded in one take with Lana and a seven-piece band.

As stated before, this album was the first in her career to be revered by critics, praising the cohesiveness, and the change in direction from “Born to Die”. Pitchfork’s Mark Richardson remarked that it was a “concept album from a concept human”, alluding to Lana’s assumed persona, while also mentioning that the album sounded “gorgeous and rich”.
This album also fared well with Lana’s fanbase, being cited as one of her best albums and bringing in a new audience of diehard rock fans. 

We will be rating all 14 tracks featured on the deluxe version of the album.

#**St. Vincent - Strange Mercy**

After a rough 2010, Annie Clark (St. Vincent) set out to create her most personal piece yet with her third album, Strange Mercy. Inspired by the methods of singer/songwriter Nick Cave (whose song lyrics originally provided her inspiration for the name ‘St. Vincent’), Clark spent October of 2010 in Seattle treating her music career like any other day job. She would spend the next month in social and technological isolation, primarily only moving between her hotel room and the studio (rented from the drummer for Death Cab for Cutie). In an interview with SPIN in 2011 she described the experience:

>”Sometimes I felt like, 'Things are going great and I'm loving this,'?’ Some days it was just terrible. I'll listen and think, 'This is shit, what was I doing?' Sometimes I'll be in a moment of shame, and then I'll try this, or maybe this, and then the next day I'll think that it's better than I thought. Feelings aren't fact."

Following her time in Seattle, Clark announced that she was working on her third album in early 2011. Collaborating with her previous album’s producer John Congleton (who would also return to help produce her follow-up album St. Vincent), Clark created a magnificently written and fantastically produced album. Strange Mercy explores many real and dark lyrical themes including relationship expectations, depression, and societal pressures. All of the tracks on the album were written entirely by her, with the exception of “Year of the Tiger” (which was co-written with her mother, Sharon).

Like her previous album, Strange Mercy received universal acclaim from critics upon release and currently sits at an 85 on Metacritic. It also became her highest charting album for the time, peaking at number 19 on the Billboard 200. Strange Mercy placed on numerous year-end best album lists for 2011 including NME (#7), Pitchfork (#11), as well as decade-end lists like Pitchfork’s best albums of the 2010s (#55).

Although there were no singles officially released from the album, two videos were made: one for “Cruel” and another for “Cheerleader”. We’ll be rating the 11 songs on the standard edition of the album.

#**Mitski - Puberty 2**

Puberty 2 is the fourth studio album released by indie-rock superstar Mitski. Coming off her 2014 breakthrough album, “Bury Me at Makeout Creek”, Mitski described wanting to go back to her roots and create a more personal album.  

Only working with long-time collaborator Patrick Hyland (producer and instrumentalist of her previous studio albums and on 2018’s Be the Cowboy), Mitski created an emotionally charged, and sometimes distant, album. She heavily incorporates punk and rock sounds, even more so than her previous outings. The album meaningfully addresses topics like loneliness, fear, and change (so really Puberty 2 seems to be a fitting name).

The autobiographical lead single, “Your Best American Girl” addresses Mitski’s struggles with her Japanese-American background and the cultural divide between her and an “all-American boy”. The track has become one of her most well-known songs. The second single, “Happy” creates a bleak outlook to feeling happy, musing over the lows that will inevitably follow. Fitting the sexual lyricism, the song is best described by Mitski herself: “Happiness fucks you”. Both singles received music videos, as well as another one for the album’s closing track “A Burning Hill”.

Puberty 2 released on June 17, 2016 to rave critical acclaim from critics, ending up with an 87 on Metacritic. The album has also been included on year-end best album lists from Time (#3), Stereogum (#8), Pitchfork (#18), and Rolling Stone (#23), as well as Pitchfork’s decade-end album list (#30).

We’ll be rating the 11 tracks found on the standard edition of the album.
