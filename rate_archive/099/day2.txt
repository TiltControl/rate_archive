**survivorjdmarina** (10): This is one of my favourites off the album! The outro is pure chaos, and this track would honestly sound good in a teen drama, to build up tension.

**TiltControls** (7.5): This song is neat, I’ll give it that. The production gets a little… too weird for me at the end, but otherwise it’s a strong song. Also I’m disappointed no one made any cheap Simpsons jokes.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): The guitars, on point as always.

**fluviusfluit** (10): Other guitar players exist? How embarrassing for them

**jexan13** (10): This song makes me see the Northern Lights too, so, it's great.

**mudkip1** (10): this is so fucking good i can't wait for it to get a 6 avg

**bulforster** (9.5): Manic catharsis like this is a quarantine mood.

**andrxwzsz** (9): Just slightly below par lyric wise, but its excuse in that guitar solo is heavenly

**CarlieScion** (9): love the guitar

**Steelstepladder** (9): I really like songs that just kind of pound away. And that distortion solo is just chefs kiss It's like 100 Gecs but good

**bbfan132** (8.5): really dig the energy here

**1998tweety** (8): This is nice but it gets a little too crazy

**freav** (8): she says champagne year but then champagne year is another song on this album, wow annie, crazy stuff!

**slimboyfriend** (8): I just like the word maudlin

**waluigiest** (8): those noises....... my brain freezes when I hear them

**wavingwolves** (8): a good song for the year of 2020

**thunderbird\_14** (7.5): Sucks to live in a tropical island.

**cremeebrulee** (7): "It's a champagne year full of sober months" whew felt that but the rest of the song is ok

**WaffleWhales** (7): Queen of Fairbanks Alaska!

**fadedblue09** (4): Kinda too progressive for my tastes. And the lyrics really didn’t grab my attention either.

**vayyiqra** (3): I live in a northern country (Canada) but have never seen the Northern Lights in person. Sad! Anyway, this would be okay but fuck this crunchy guitar tone I can't stand it. Also that solo, if it can even be called one, was the worst.

**CritneySpearz** (1): the outro sounded part sounded like a 5 year old tried to replicate Sophie’s production

**survivorjdmarina** (7): A bit of a change-up from the crazy guitars, this track is honestly not my favourite off here, but it’s pleasant sounding. It’s very drenched in reverb though.

**TiltControls** (7): I wish the song picked up a bit more, but otherwise it’s a good song. The subdued vocal is a nice change of pace from the rest of the album and the chill mood is nice to embrace. Though I absolutely love the lyrics on the song

---

**1998tweety** (10): I love it

**bulforster** (10): The progression from nihilism to hope on this song makes me want to cry.

**CarlieScion** (10): gorgeous!!!!!!

**hunnybee12** (10): always loved this song. eerie and hopeful at the same time

**fadedblue09** (9.5): It’s nice to see a stripped-down track for once and it gives me Enya vibes at same time? Also, TIL about this “champagne year” thing.

**andrxwzsz** (9): Still makes me tear up

**bbfan132** (9): this is the second time she’s referenced champagne years on this album… too bad i was born on the 3rd of november so i will never experience one :/

**wavingwolves** (9): hypnotic

**cocosairdep** (8.7): The first verse in this one is my favourite part of this album. The delivery is amazing.

**thunderbird\_14** (8.5): The entire instrumental between the first and second chorus sounds so majestic. I also feel bad for those born in the 1st day of the month.

**akanewasright** (8): A lowkey moment works so well here.

**slimboyfriend** (8): The song with the most space on this claustrophobic album

**jexan13** (7.5): I first listened to this album earlier this year, and thought "oh, what a haunting tune. But this will be my Champagne Year, so get those dirty vibes away, Annie!". Hehe, now I'm fading away as if Thanos snapped.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): I really liked the imagery of the opening lyrics, but it never really went anywhere unfortunately...

**vayyiqra** (6): A nice break from all the distorted crunchy dissonant stuff but it also doesn't really go anywhere. I think of it as more of an interlude.

**Steelstepladder** (5): Lyrics are good... but this isn't what I listen to St. Vincent for

**WaffleWhales** (3): it doesn’t really progress or go anywhere

**survivorjdmarina** (10): This is one of my favourites on the album too!!!! The guitar pulses are really cathartic here. Also that “let’s not forgettttt” vocal run... mwah! Shame it’s not making it to day 3.

**TiltControls** (10): From Dictionary.com - “a person who cultivates an area of interest, such as the arts, without real commitment or knowledge.” since I didn’t really know what it was before the song.  The song has a great atmosphere to it and the build up throughout the whole song is done amazingly!

---

**andrxwzsz** (10): Stank face just thinking about that guitar

**fluviusfluit** (10): masterpiece

**1998tweety** (9.5): a funky bop, love it

**hunnybee12** (9): the chorus screams tik tok sound to me

**minha1234** (8.9): I really dig the ending

**bbfan132** (8.5): the guitar riffs on this track are awesome, love the touches of funk too

**freav** (8): i'm not a native english speaker so i'm genuinely asking, is that really the way you pronounce Elijah??

**slimboyfriend** (8): This song makes me feel like I'm at a little tipsy at a nice cozy party in a brownstone and I'm making eyes to some twink with glasses across the room but he never notices me and I just end up swaying alone in a corner by the end of the night

**wavingwolves** (8): cool stuff

**fadedblue09** (7): I didn’t quite get this one lyrically, but I do love the guitar riffs.

**Steelstepladder** (7): This is so lovely. Excellent build throughout the whole song

**vayyiqra** (6): At the yearly Passover seder, Jews traditionally leave an extra spot at the table for the prophet Elijah in case he comes back from heaven and feels like stopping by. Since they have been doing this for thousands of years, she might be waiting an awfully long time, I hate to say.

**jexan13** (5): If it were not for the ocasional riffs this would be much lower

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Damn, I was hoping this would make it to day 3. I can see why people would think it’s a bit much, but honestly I thought more people would rate this one higher. It’s very cathartic and noisy, and I love it.

**TiltControls** (7): This sounds more like a jam session than a structured song tbh. I definitely see the potential and feel like an extra minute or so could have really helped. It’s still great, but I think it’s one of the weaker tracks on the album.

---

**bbfan132** (10): maybe i lied earlier… this is so fucking cathartic, i love it

**bespectacIed** (10): I already feel the early exit because this is a short song and popheads hate unconventional song structures regardless of song quality. This is my 2nd most listened song in Puberty 2 after YBAM because it's so universally relatable lol. Like, did mitski really have to call out literally every young adult who's lost in life and just wanna die???? It's the epitome of this [tweet](https://twitter.com/mitskillme/status/1282065468249923584?s=20)

**bulforster** (10): If someone told them they weren't afraid to die in a job interview I'd hire them on the spot.

**fadedblue09** (10): GO OFF SIS. This one gives My December-era Kelly vibes, and I'm here for it.

**fluviusfluit** (10): Several male fronted punk bands found irrelevant

**mudkip1** (10): honestly should be my 11. i fuck with this so much i love you mitski

**plastichaxan** (10): the coolest song in the album ofc is the one with the coolest title yup

**Steelstepladder** (10): It's so unpolished I fucking love it. KILL ME IN JERUUUUUSELUM is one of the best moments on the album

**WaffleWhales** (10): I’M NOT DOING ANYTHING [aggressive guitar]

**akanewasright** (9.5): KILL ME IN JERUSALEM

**freav** (9.5): go off

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): i also work best under a deadline

**andrxwzsz** (9): Go and kill me

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): should be longer!

**thunderbird\_14** (9): Mitski just because the prevailing concensus is that all matter on earth was produced from supernova doesn’t mean that we’re made of crushed little stars. That’s not the definition of stars at all.

**waluigiest** (9): I too work better under a deadline

**lambeosaura** (8): its brash, but this is a perfect encapsulation of how my anxiety attacks sound.

**slimboyfriend** (8): My go-to interview question is also "What age have you picked to disappear?"

**wavingwolves** (8): "i work better under a deadline" adhd teas

**cremeebrulee** (6): ok this score was lower but then i read the genius description for it and for some reason it made me laugh so i bumped it up a bit

**rotating3Dtext** (6): the lyrics here are really something

**jexan13** (5.5): Nice lyrics but the music is lowkey abrasive, and not in a good way.

**1998tweety** (5): Mood, but the song is not good

**CarlieScion** (3): im so sorry mitski but even i have limits

**purplechilipepper** (2): hate the production

**vayyiqra** (2): No one can stop us now / 'Cause we are all made of stars

**kappyko** (1): not even my adoration for mitski’s artistry keeps me from hating the fuck out of this

**survivorjdmarina** (9): I don’t know why, but the intro of this sounds like Oingo Boingo’s *Forbidden Zone*. I really like that comparison though, so I’m sticking with it.

**TiltControls** (6): I’m just… not a huge fan of this one. It stays pretty monotone and never goes anywhere interesting. Although the lyrics are neat they can’t completely save the song.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): i'm dan

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The imagery in this song is wonderful, it's the type of imagery that is the peak of mitski imo

**sandyfishnets** (10): goosebumps. devastatingly beautiful

**WaffleWhales** (10): shown his bedroom dancer to ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

**andrxwzsz** (9): An absolute rager

**bbfan132** (9): the concept of this song is ridiculous but i still love it

**fadedblue09** (9): An underrated cute rock bop. When you look at the lyrics, it’s the perfect follow-up to “Happy”. Also, the repetition of “shown his bedroom dancer to” is so addicting.

**Steelstepladder** (9): I forget how good this album is everytime I listen to it

**freav** (8.6): one of the most low-key songs on side A, but fantastic nonetheless

**1998tweety** (8.5): Bop

**CarlieScion** (8): kinda quiet, but the beat makes me wanna MOVE

**cremeebrulee** (8): oh i also dig this ... lots of good discoveries today

**wavingwolves** (7.5): so nice of mitski to write a song about incels

**bulforster** (6.5): I don't really like the spoken-word quality the vocals have in the first half, clashing with the instrumental that's so rigid. The song gets pretty good when she fully commits to singing though.

**jexan13** (6): Not terrible, but kinda forgettable

**minha1234** (5): meh

**vayyiqra** (5): Weird and a little disconcerting.

**TiltControls** (9): St. Vincent definitely knows how to close an album. The song has an unsettling nature that really does match the “Living in fear in the year of the Tiger” chorus. The guitar work is fantastic here too (I feel like I’ve commented this on all of her songs)

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): The lyrics are very raw and personal here, talking about her depression back in 2010 (which was coincidentally the year of the tiger). I really love the pulsing guitars that play in the verses. I wish they had more of a presence though.

---

**andrxwzsz** (10): A classic already

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): OH AMERICA CAN I OWE YOU ONE?????

**bbfan132** (8.5): this is definitely an album of its time but i still enjoyed it! good closing track

**thunderbird\_14** (8.5): Thank u annie for teaching us to pronounce bourgeoisie

**fadedblue09** (8): A very pleasant closing track, and a somewhat fitting way to distill the themes of the album.

**wavingwolves** (8): good as a closing track

**1998tweety** (7.5): Alright

**jexan13** (7): Guess she isn't too good with closers

**slimboyfriend** (7): When I was young coach called me the sloth

**jman457** (6.7): Not my fav ST. vincint Album, more of a fan of her self-titled album and Massudection.

**bulforster** (6.5): I like the music but I can't figure out what the lyrics are trying to tell me.

**vayyiqra** (6): We are in the year of the rat in fact which is fitting because this is also the year of the plague and I Do Not Like It. I liked this song though.

**Steelstepladder** (3): Probably my least favorite on the album. Just a bit too slow without much punch, especially for the closer.

**TiltControls** (10): The conviction Mitski has in the way she sells every single one of those no’s like a cry for help makes this one of my favourite songs of hers. I think the simplicity really sells this song better than if she tried to add an extra verse or something. Not to mention that the instrumental is fantastic. Wish it could have gone a little further.

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): I really like the synth progression here. The guitars make this song sound a bit clunky to be honest, but it’s okay.

**Steelstepladder** (8): popheads are gonna eat this alive but just cause it's a ballad doesnt mean its bad

**wavingwolves** (8): the way you can feel the emotion in her voice is mesmerizing

**fadedblue09** (7.5): A bit under-written, but the instrumental solo elevates this one.

**TiltControls** (9.5): Short, but sweet. Honestly she could have gone an extra minute longer. 1:30 is almost interlude length for some artists. Still, Mitski uses the opportunity to absolutely rock out to a catchy, memorable tune.

**survivorjdmarina** (9): This is a banger!! I have a loving feeling for this song.

---

**ariiaaaa** (10): holy shit, I'd never heard this either what stunning guitar

**bespectacIed** (10): is she ... you know ... *spongebob limpwrist meme* ??? This was a nice callback to the raw sound of bury me at makeout creek

**cremeebrulee** (10): lol the whiplash from the last track but yes this is great

**fadedblue09** (10): Gives me indie rom-com soundtrack vibes. It's a crime that this bop is only over a minute long, but somehow I'm satisfied. Better than most of the "short" songs on Be The Cowboy.

**Steelstepladder** (10): It's weird coming off hosing a rate with many unneeded and unnecessary interludes and shorter songs and then I come over to Mitski and a one and a half minute song is one of the best songs on the album. Look at that

**WaffleWhales** (10): ~holding hands under the table~

**bulforster** (9): This song is so good she could've made it a little longer.

**slimboyfriend** (9): When u hate ur lover

**wavingwolves** (9): ouch i guess

**freav** (8.2): mitski's so punk rock

**andrxwzsz** (8): And that's the thing about illicit affairs!

**bbfan132** (8): this describes gay relationships perfectly…

**1998tweety** (7): It's alright

**minha1234** (7): forgettable

**survivorjdmarina** (9): Like most tracks on its parent album, the outro is very *whizzbang*, and almost the best part about this song. It’s cool.

**TiltControls** (7.5): This song has really really grown on me since I gave it a score. The guitarwork is captivating before descending into what I can best describe as a descent into madness at the end (and still captivating!)

---

**andrxwzsz** (11): The only 11 I'm giving in this rate as it's probably my favorite song of all time

**bespectacIed** (10): The slowly increasing speed of the beat that feels like a heart monitor during a surgery, oh wow

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): loooove when this just goes off the rails

**RandomHypnotica** (10): That bass lick (I think?) is really REALLY catchy and the way this song builds at the end took me WAY by surprise but it's incredible

**Steelstepladder** (10): GET ALONG GET ALONG GET ALONG

**freav** (9.5): the melody of the verses is one of her prettiest, and then the chorus is insane

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): Eerily manic

**bbfan132** (9): the synth in the background is heavenly

**bulforster** (9): The tempo switch from following Annie's slow vocals to the double time guitar line letting the song reflect both depression and panic is genius.

**fadedblue09** (9): Oh wow this is heading towards art-pop territory. I love the arrangements in the second half.

**hunnybee12** (9): i’m usually eh about st. vincent songs until I look at the lyrics - learning that the line “best, finest surgeon / come cut me open” was taken from a diary entry by marilyn monroe makes the song for me

**jexan13** (9): This song feels like the slutty version of Black Rainbow from Actor (which, btw, was my 11 in an /r/indieheads rate and was absolutely disrepected, you aren't the only ones, (in the only world), with infuriating rates)

**ariiaaaa** (8): I really dig these lyrics

**minha1234** (7.9): weird but cool

**1998tweety** (7.5): The 2nd half of this song is great but it takes a second to get there

**WaffleWhales** (6.9): bEsT fInEsT sUrGeOn

**fluviusfluit** (6.5): I always wanted to like that chorus because of the lyrics but some evil part of me prevented it

**cremeebrulee** (6): i feel like a running theme in this album is gonna be me not understanding any of these songs

**vayyiqra** (6): This is weird but in a quirky and fun way unlike the earlier weird tracks and I like the lyrical concept behind it.

**waluigiest** (6): noise

**wavingwolves** (6): the end of the song was something alright

**CritneySpearz** (2): pls don’t cut me open

**TiltControls** (10): There’s no denying that the lyrics are questionable **at best** (and glorifcation if not). It’s a messy, messy song. But the actual track is gorgeous and I think (like The Crystals song it’s based of off) the song is meant to tell a story rather than glorify anything. Does it do that part well? Ehhh…... But it’s still an interesting story

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): This isn’t anything less than stunning either. A little more lowkey that other tracks on here, but it’s pleasant. Sound wise at least. The lyrics are pretty problematic.

---

**cocosairdep** (11): I’ll never get tired of this one. Such a perfect song, it’s so captivating. The bridge and the chorus are out of this world.

**1998tweety** (10): Gorgeous, yeah it's a little messy but it's still a phenomenal song.

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes I am going to be contrarian and rate this highly when I know it's going to be tanked for the offensive line in the chorus which does make me a little uncomfortable. Lana has always been edgy in depicting toxic relationships in her songs, but this is a step further than what she usually does. Nevertheless I love this song anyway.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): okay yes there's THAT line but everything else is just so gorgeous

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): "He hit me and it felt like a kiss" is still one of Lana's most questionable lyrics, but despite this, I think this song really is good

**bbfan132** (9): “he hit me and it felt like a kiss” is a disturbing lyric but the song still sounds beautiful… i’ll see myself out

**jexan13** (9): me dio un putazo que se sintió como un beso <3

**WaffleWhales** (9): bilingual queen!

**waluigiest** (9): I love love LOVE that this title track comes right after the Cruel World overture. It’s so beautiful

**letsallpoo** (8): perhaps this hasn't aged the best

**plastichaxan** (8): /that/ line still brings me out of the song a bit but damn this is great

**sandyfishnets** (8): In classic Lana style, the lyrics of this song are problematic, with direct reference to this 1962 song... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-MBpL4GbUY

**worlds-okayest666** (8): no lana dont glamorize domestic violence youre so sexy aha

**fadedblue09** (7.7): Very subdued and actually one of my favorites, but loses points for the cringy spoken-word thing.

**andrxwzsz** (7): I don't know if this aged well but...

**ariiaaaa** (7): I get a very "edgy tumblr trying to be cool" vibe from this but that's okay, cringe culture is dead, we all need to express ourselves sometimes

**CarlieScion** (7): the grand intro strings make up for how little this song interests me

**slimboyfriend** (7): To me, this song doesn't romanticize abuse so much as it captures the messed up mindframe that abusers can manipulate into taking on. Until she starts speaking spanish in the bridge.

**freav** (6): yeah, definitely not really my thing although the chorus is nice

**Steelstepladder** (6): It's alright but for a song called Ultraviolence this isn't really provacative or striking.

**wavingwolves** (6): already waiting for the "glorification of abuse" essays this one is going to get

**akanewasright** (5): I’m giving out a lot of 10s to Lana, so I’m trying to be fair. This was always a track that I would be okay with skipping, even though I liked it.

**kappyko** (3): the bridge really sank this

**bulforster** (2.5): She sang and it felt like a sleeping pill.

**bespectacIed** (0): Score for obvious reasons. Lana romanticized domestic violence and had the girls and misogynistic gays stanning

**survivorjdmarina** (10): The lyrics here... whew! She should’ve kept this on the standard, non-deluxe album, to be honest. It’s the spiritual sister of *The Other Woman*.

**TiltControls** (10): One of my favourite songs on the album. The chorus is especially beautiful. “Oh what can I do. Life is beautiful but you don’t have a clue” gets me everytime. imo this is her strongest vocal performance in the rate. Even though its deluxe version partners left early on Day 1, I’m glad this one got the love it deserved to nearly get to day 3.

**bbfan132** (8): i don’t remember this song sounding like this but i’m not mad

**bulforster** (7.5): Shades of Cool with better verses.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): So she decided to put 4 breathy snoozers on the last half of the standard edition but left this one off. Cool.

**freav** (7.3): this is better than most non deluxe tracks

**andrxwzsz** (7): Super pretty

**vayyiqra** (7): It's okay but too similar to other songs on the album.

**plastichaxan** (5.8): ok maybe this album isn't as great as i remember....oop

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Y’know, one thing I noticed about Lana’s songwriting is she tends to get sidetracked in her own songs . For instance, this song is drowned in too many color metaphors/imagery that the message itself gets lost. In the end, I’m just left confused and unsatisfied.

**Steelstepladder** (5): If you're writing a song over five minutes, minute two should sound different than minute five

**WaffleWhales** (4): I just think the Deluxe edition was really unnecessary

=====

VeryGreenGreenbeans: I agree to an extant. My favorite Lana song period is Pretty When You Cry. It’s just so perfect in every way, but we all knew that it wasn’t going to even make it half way due to the dust it’s paid. To me, songs like Ride and West Coast are crowd pleasers amongst the fandom. Everybody has their own individual faves, but almost all can agree that those are some damn good songs. It’s the reason Vroom Vroom wins every Charli rate even though few have it as their number 1 favorite, it’s just that nobody dislikes them. I love West Coast and would love to see it win (although Cruel World is the best remaining song imo), but I wish the typical fan favorites wouldn’t hog the spotloght every damn rate. But when it’s this neck and neck and between Lana and others, not just herself, I’d be happy to see any Lana song win.

purestdreams: Great points, and I definitely agree. "Crowd pleasers" is the perfect term for them. It's not so much that I dislike them, rather that I prefer many other songs. I'd put it between Cruel World and Brooklyn Baby myself. Would be nice to see a rate where the guaranteed win was removed and the rest had to fight it out!

**survivorjdmarina** (10): This, to me, is the heart of the album. It’s so sad, but it’s beautiful. It’s a more vulnerable and raw side of Lana. Shame this is going out just as Day 3 arrives.

**TiltControls** (7.5): Just missing Day 3 is Old Money. I can’t say I care too much for the verses, but the chorus is gorgeous. Especially when the strings kick in.

---

**bbfan132** (10): stunning. she might have my favorite lower register of any singer i listen to, it moves me

**bespectacIed** (10): STUNNINGGGGT. Need her on an orchestra all the time

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song is a lana discography highlight and needs to be respected as such. i remember seeing someone describe NFR as Old Money: The Album and they're completely right

**CritneySpearz** (10): honestly why does the line “will you still love me when I shine, from words but not from beauty” hit so hard.. :’(

**fadedblue09** (10): Wow, I can’t believe she actually delivered something good for once? See, Lana? I can actually like your music. It just needs to be simple, soulful, and free of any pretentiousness.

**fluviusfluit** (10): Oh this one hits me in the heart

**jexan13** (10): Yet another 11 contender. Oh God. This is one of the most beautiful ballads I've heard, and if /r/clownheads dare to disrespect it because it is not a bop, i swear...

**wavingwolves** (10): blissful

**minha1234** (9): what can I say? It's a classic and deserved to be on the gatsby soundtrack more than young & beautiful

**mudkip1** (9): this album is such a stark sonic difference from the other two in this rate

**1998tweety** (8.5): Beautiful ballad, I do wish it had an extra little oomph in it, but it's nice.

**akanewasright** (8): Looking at the lyrics, this song is kinda skin deep, but it’s so, so pretty and well produced, I can ignore that entirely.

**andrxwzsz** (8): And we're back!!
