**just\_thonking** (7): Yeah.... not surprised this one is out first. It's definitely the low point on the album and I still question why he felt the need to include this, but it's also kind of iconic idc. Horny album is horny!

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): with our first elimination of the rate we lose this ode to the pleasures of cat ownership. I can‚Äôt really act like this is any sort of standout but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs THAT much worse than everything else here, idk. I guess we‚Äôre all dog people here

---

**flava** (10): the way this short track was definitely not recorded on accident like the outro implies. It‚Äôs short, and really funny. But honestly this is the kinda song you write after having the sex that Use Me implies happens

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): unironically a 10 like he ate that

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I laughed a lot when the song ended. Miguel take my energussy

**starla\_** (9.5): why do I love this dumb interlude so much

**ImADudeDuh** (9): had about enough, its not hard to see, pu-ssy is mine

**celladonn** (8): this is a little too stripped back and the lyrics border on pathetic buuuut he sounds so good that he makes it work

**nt96** (8): Popheads is gonna tank this due to its content but let's be honest, yall musty virgins wish you could relate

**slimboyfriend** (8): I‚Äôm sure we can all relate here on r/popheads

**Stryxen** (8): kinda love this but ‚Ä¶ üò≠

**vapourlomo** (8): sorry, the teen boy part of my brain still finds this funny lol

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): king princess type title

**shipperondeck** (7.8): liked this more than i thought i would lol

**AHSWeeknd** (7): imagine if Will Schuester covered this

**amr** (7): this would literally be a perfect song if it were about anything else and then he drops the title more than once like oh brother we get it it's Urs. enough!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): miguel! stop being busy getting pussy we got an album to record about how much you want pussy!

**freeofblasphemy** (7): You can make a low-stakes interstitial song. And you can give a song a goofy name. But doing both is asking for trouble. That said this is still admittedly catchy and I like the creepy synth line

**frogaranaman** (7): no the fuck it's not

**plastichaxan** (7): This pussy is yours Miguel

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): I love Bella Thorne

**welcome2thejam** (7): Sorry but Hatsune Miku said "World is Mine" first so she had dibs

**noavocadoshere** (6.9): miguel walked, so kung-fu kenny could levitate on sza's doves in the wind. i do love a good "stripped" song though.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): ‚ÄúIt is very poetic considering Miguel is poetic by nature. ‚Äú is a real genius annotation for this song

**fadedblue09** (5.5): love how he passionately delivers lyrics such as these üíÄ anyway this wasn't very interesting

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): hate the studio chatter at the beginning. The song itself is kinda camp in a it's so sincere that it's funny way.

**1998tweety** (5): the one bad song for vulnerability OMG

**akanewasright** (5): https://open.spotify.com/track/7tqIKNBfS2sKSd013aOFBE?si=Eh78Q4g2TXG19sd_AFjQYg

**bogo** (5): lol i do not believe for one second you didn't know you were being recorded miguel, this sounds super rehearsed

**MiguelWifetoc** (5): dude this shit is so goddamn funny but dont flop with an acoustic mid ass ditty. like yeah bro you have a hysterical on point voice, but do NOT waste it for dis comedown!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): vote and favorite my rate with Heaux Tales next cycle xo

**sarcasticsobs** (4): "What is he doing?" is RIGHT! No h*rny zone!! The vocals cannot save that for me, I can't get into this over-the-top stuff

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): this is fun at the start but kind of drags and the more i have listened to it the more of a chore i find it to get through

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): No.

**runaway3212** (1): horrible

**babadork** (0): ‚ÄúThe‚Äù pussy should be ‚Äúyour‚Äù pussy. This one word choice is enough to make the song unlistenable.

**DirtyRat583** (0): with a title like "Pussy Is Mine" i was expecting more of a üí•üí• song but no we get... this?

**ignitethephoenix** (0): literally why does this song exist on this album it‚Äôs so boring especially for a song about pussy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): i get that this is supposed to be kind of a ‚Äújoke‚Äù song but you could also, i don‚Äôt know, try to make it sound good or remotely interesting

**TheQueenofCultures** (0): ugh, jesus gross

**throwaway-7650** (0): this is an all saints song [derogatory]

---

**just\_thonking** (9): I am choosing the non-rapey interpretation of this song.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): Our first single of the rate exits very very early. Honestly I get it, as nice as the production & vocals are, this song is way skeevier than most of the rate, and that‚Äôs in quite a sleazy rate.

---

**MiguelWifetoc** (11): saintly 11 dispatched to easily the funniest goddamn line on the album "yeah you look good, and I got money, BUT I don't wanna waste my time. Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three". this is the ULTIMATE sigma wife guy. like a dipshit pick up artist could not effortlessly convey this sorta "well your hot but if it don't happen dw no biggie" vibe that miguel effortlessly flops into. i don't even know if this guy wants to fuck tbh, but Im glad he knows his audience.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): his voice is insanity, even in that little rap part, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ there are no words

**amr** (10): pew pew pew just grows on U so much as it goes on and it wasn't even a bad song at any point

**TheQueenofCultures** (10): Its always good to let women know up front that you're cheap

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): the sequel to how many licks we never knew we needed

**shipperondeck** (9.6): the opening synth thing, what do u call that. it is good and in many 80s songs

**bogo** (9.5): the swimming pools reference is kinda odd considering that the original lyric was about alcoholism and peer pressure and here it's being used in a song about drinking and partying in a positive context, that being said this is still a really good song

**akanewasright** (9): is this lyrically kinda rancid? Sure. Does it kick ass? Hell yeah

**Awkward\_King** (9): give how many licks your 11s in as6

**cremeebrulee** (9): 0 baby we can leave RN

**fadedblue09** (9): problematique bop

**ignitethephoenix** (9): a bit bop if you ignore the lyrics (which I love to do sometimes)

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): ignoring the potentially rape-y implications of this song sawry

**runaway3212** (9): the basic human decency leaving my body hearing this bopping

**welcome2thejam** (9): When Kendrick came on and referenced Swimming Pools I popped like an opening day Marvel moviegoer at a cameo

**emayzee** (8.7): this song bops if you pretend not to understand the english language for a few minutes

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): first How Many Mics, then Licks, and now Drinks? Idk, to quote 21 Savage, A LOT!!!!

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): A little questionable lyrically, but the Weeknd has definitely said worse on House of Balloons

**starla\_** (8.5): THANK YOU for including the remix version so I didn't have to hear Miguel say 'let me dig that out like a fossil, damn baby that ass is colossal'

**1998tweety** (8): till you get to the center of a tootsie pop

**freeofblasphemy** (8): I do love the original with Miguel doing his own skeezy rap feature but peak feature era Kendrick is peak feature era Kendrick

**celladonn** (7.5): we love a kendrick appearance

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): I can't make sense of these lyrics but it somewhat bops

**ImADudeDuh** (7): to get to the center of a tootsie pop

**throwaway-7650** (7): does it take to get to the center of the (emergency room from acute liver failure)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.9): taking points off bc we‚Äôre not rating the kendrick lamar version smh

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): lyrics are distractingly douchey unfortunately

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i‚Äôll take ‚Äòconcepts for songs that would probably not pass today‚Äô for 200 alex

**oscarbrierley1** (6): in my head this is a party dance song. Then i hear it and it's a meh mid tempo song and I'm disappointed.

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Questionable song topic!! Not into Miguel's non-singing part in the original, glad we rated the remix at least. Good guitar again

**flava** (4): I can sense this song will be slightly controversial. Since this song could be viewed as Miguel pining over some girl trying to get her more drunk to make her easier. And yeah I kinda agree with the sentiment. This song might not be explicitly icky but idk the vibe has never sat right with me for this, something about asking someone how many drinks would it take to get someone home has always come across as too sleazy

**seanderlust** (4): aw hi baby kendrick! I think miguel and kendrick kill it, but something bugs me about the production - the laser gun sound effect in particular gets old pretty quick. also in hindsight, the message "how many drinks would it take for you to leave with me" has some uh...problematic elements to it.

**static\_int\_husp** (4): the Kendrick feature is super unnecessary

**Stryxen** (4): ?

**noavocadoshere** (3): wtf is that on the instrumental, a laser gun? jesus. i hate it here.

**vapourlomo** (3): well, this one hasn't aged well, huh? (also it's a little boring tbh)

**letsallpoo** (1): this gets even worse when you look at the Personal life section of his wikipedia page

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): ‚ÄúHow many drinks would it take you to leave with me?‚Äù I know he didn‚Äôt mean for this to sound creepy/gross but NOPE. Can‚Äôt. Won‚Äôt.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): Of all the songs in this rate I think this is the one I saw people talk about the least of any of them. And I get it, its a shorter song and doesn‚Äôt have the narrative hooks of some of the samples or smashes in the rate, but I actually like it quite a bit anyway. Not too mad about its early exit but it could‚Äôve stood to do a little better

**just\_thonking** (7): This got paid dust! Just kidding, this is one of the weaker cuts of Nostalgia, Ultra so I think a day 1 exit is fitting.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Parts of the beat remind me of Alicia Key‚Äôs Girl On Fire. Lyrics sell it though (Dust, not Alicia Key‚Äôs song).

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh those bleep bloops in the background‚Ä¶so nice.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh that hits a bit too close to home

**rosapalms** (10): one of those songs that I know isn't necessarily amazing but it lingers in my mind for whatever reason. Can't explain or justify, but oh well

**starla\_** (10): short but very very sweet

**TiltControls** (10): Second choice for the 11. Just a stunning song

**shipperondeck** (9.5): simple theme but very sweet

**MiguelWifetoc** (9.4): *white kid just discovering frank ocean is good* yeah fuck man, this frank ocean kid has some ideas. robby d, plz pass the bong and add some extra moon rocks on it, im trying to go "spliff tempo" mode.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): Live. Write. Love.

**noavocadoshere** (8.9): frank academia. for some strange reason, dust made me want to listen to lonny breaux. i genuinely enjoy this.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): god I fucking hate dust so much, it comes so QUICK and makes having black and/or glossy furniture a cleaning NIGHTMARE

**thedoctordances1940** (8.1): the faint little synth flourishes add so much to what would otherwise be one of the most unremarkable tracks on the mixtape

**runaway3212** (8): a bit weak for this album

**throwaway-7650** (8): omg... the "hey. hey. hey. this is library" guy was frank ocean all along

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Captures the thrill and pain and fleeting love real well. One of those songs where both performance and production feel so distinct yet intertwined

**welcome2thejam** (7): Dreamy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): should‚Äôve been longer

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): this sounds like that one avatar the last airbender kalimba song

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): giving nothing right now, sorry if I regret this

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): lyrically i love the concept but idrc for it generally

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): ngl i literally always forget this song exists

**oscarbrierley1** (3): idk I don't find anything about this song fun.

**amr** (1): I don't even have any logical reasoning for why I hate this if anything the sparkly production should be right up my alley but I frowned throughout the whole thing regardless. I also would not have guessed this clocks in at only 2 minutes and 33 seconds cos it feels so much longer and not in a good way

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): Frank looking at this like ‚Äúyes i did that, and you‚Äôd do it too for a check‚Äù

---

**frogaranaman** (10): cackling at this being included in the bonus

**plastichaxan** (10): I hate this but the audacity of this being here and ending the rate‚Ä¶ I respect that

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I cannot believe this is real (and its good)

**throwaway-7650** (10): camp

**starla\_** (7.5): this is a song for children but it still slaps

**ImADudeDuh** (7.1): why can I actually hear the frank ocean influence on this

**apatel27** (7): His voice üò≠ I can't

**DirtyRat583** (6): his ass is NOT in time with the song

**noavocadoshere** (6): it's not bad and it's v. age appropriate for him but it doesn't fit jb at all. it's also officially time to go to bed lol.

**welcome2thejam** (6): Imagining someone that isn't Justin Bieber on this with a better sound and now I'm mad

**MiguelWifetoc** (5.7): a very talented gentleman. like a nonalcoholic pbrnb

**freeofblasphemy** (5.5): Late 2000s production values so egregious they somehow become tasteful. Appreciate the effort, Justin, but clearly someone older and more creative than you wrote this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): ‚ÄúI was a player when I was little‚Äù First grader with four girlfriends because you had the 64 pack of crayons type energy

**vapourlomo** (5): well, it's certainly no One Time

**seanderlust** (4.7): yeah these lyrics do not make sense when a 14 year old sings them dfjsjlf

**cremeebrulee** (4.5): frank's pen definitely ran out of some ink here

**slimboyfriend** (4): You couldn‚Äôt have picked any other song Frank was featured on huh

**akanewasright** (3): huh!

**criticalprocess** (3): even frank ocean can't make young jb good

**indiefan** (2.7): Not even a writing credit from Frank will make me like this man.

**TheQueenofCultures** (2.5): probably would sound better if he didn't sound like he's 12 (I know he's probably 12 on this track)

**babadork** (2): We could be listening to Brandy, but this helps balance out all the 10s I gave Frank Ocean.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): üò≠?

**AHSWeeknd** (1): Ya‚Äôll buttered up my ears with Miguel‚Äôs gorgeous voice and want to end the rate with this? JAIL.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): lmao

**sarcasticsobs** (1): Well

**just\_thonking** (8): Another weaker Miguel cut gets an early exit. This song has grown on me a lot, but it definitely doesn't touch the songs on the first half of the album.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): This was honestly my favorite from the stretch here in the second half of this album that seemed to struggle compared to the rest of Miguel, but I guess y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt agree

---

**CrimsonROSET** (10): pitbull - time of our lives

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): i‚Äôm a heaux for great basslines

**MiguelWifetoc** (10): the whole lead in line "where's the fun in forever?" straight into this absolute immaculate no issue, no chaff, no silly bullshit banger. like fun man, Im eating my first meal of the day rn, sipping on an imperial pint and this is just so goddamn GOATed. love the wife guy

**throwaway-7650** (9): I see you, ms. alicia keys! vote for piano girls \~

**starla\_** (8.5): a low key bop

**AHSWeeknd** (8): the title is giving Taylor Swift reject track

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Da bass is back!!

**welcome2thejam** (8): The fun is packed into that bassline nestled tightly in the background

**akanewasright** (7.8): Alicia Keys writing this actually makes way too much sense (complimentary)

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): ok Annie, let‚Äôs get you back to bed

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): So much modern R&B seems to treat instrumentation as a non-descript backdrop to non-descript vocals. This brings out the best in both and has them work against and without each other

**TiltControls** (7.5): F(un)orever

**1998tweety** (7): cant spell awesome without me

**seanderlust** (7): "tomorrow's just a day away" yes bestie that's exactly how days work

**slimboyfriend** (7): Alicia Keys? What are you doing here?

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): tomorrow is just a day away so grab somebody sexy tell em HEY GIMME EVERYTHING TONITE

**noavocadoshere** (6.4): this feels like i listened to the thong song, where sisqo says the same thing over and over. except it's miguel. eh, i like it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): kinda went in one ear and out another

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Me listening to ‚ÄúLoft Music‚Äù by the Weeknd (because it‚Äôs too damn long and boring).

**flava** (3): ok I promise my hate for this album will stop after this but I just hate how this song feels. The way it sticks with no momentum. And I‚Äôve never loved Alicia Keys‚Äô voice and she doesn‚Äôt fit on this album at all

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): HAVING TOES FOR THE MOMENT??? ARE YOU CUTTING MY FOOT OFF?????????

**just\_thonking** (7.5): It's not bad, but it's surrounded by essentially perfect songs so what can you do.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): Honestly expected this song to do better in the rate since it was the first single to get posted to Drake‚Äôs blog and start blowing Abel up, but it seems y‚Äôall thought it was on the low tier of the project. And tbh I agree, it‚Äôs fine but I‚Äôve never found it as catchy or unique compared to most of the other songs here

---

**emayzee** (11): sexy and simple and intricate and intimate all at the same time. he's put out so much good material in the last 10+ years but this is arguably still a top 3 weeknd song of mine to this day

**sage** (11): best song ever

**AHSWeeknd** (10): That sample is just insanity, he nails the samples

**akanewasright** (10): the Aaliyah sample really completes this

**amr** (10): ironically it's not the aaliyah sample. but aside from the very lush production it's absolutely the second verse. "I got everything U want with me. I do everything he does times three. and he don't gotta know, I got U on the floor doing things U ever thought U'd do. baby leave them high heeled shoes, cos I love it when U're looking down at me, I'm looking up at U. and I don't give a damn shawty watch me knock Ur boots off" likeeee just the most fun and sweet delivery across this entire rate TBH maybe in the world. tbh!

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is honestly a top ten song in his discography!! the simple chorus + tranquil production play off each other so well it makes for a really mesmerizing track

**Islands** (10): One of his best songs for the atmosphere alone beach house needs take notes

**MiguelWifetoc** (10): dude what the FRICK is going on with that twitched out carbon black compressed percussive; absolute sonic *flatline* of a pop track, deeply bleak. "he's what u want I'm what u need" is such a pervasive thousand yard stare into purgatory that abel sells. oh and what a bomb sample

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): ultimate male manipulator music

**nt96** (10): What we need is to give Aaliyah a rate win. I'm still bitter.

**starla\_** (10): I love the muffled vocals

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): it's so smooth and chilled out. The aaliyah sample is amazing.

**noavocadoshere** (9): dreamy, dark, haunting. still sounds fresh. aaliyah was done justice with how rock the boat was utilized here.

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Haaaaaaazy

**shipperondeck** (9): thematically the same song as what you need by inxs

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): This does haze so well. Strong Clams Casino vibes too

**indiefan** (8.4): Even with the Aaliyah sample, I always thought this was a tad overrated. Still a solid track nonetheless

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): I love how haunting that synth is

**celladonn** (8): vibey

**welcome2thejam** (8): Remember back when people memed those boring looking dudes who held pieces of paper pointing at each other with that corny ass "he's the one who you want" "he's the one you need" thing. Idk just reminded me of that

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I wish the Rock the Boat sample was used outside the beginning of the song. Other then that, this song is kind of mid to me. It‚Äôs a nice vibe but not a standout

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): this sounds so cool but i can NOT imagine someone using this as a sexy time song, i think if someone tried to seduce me with this playing i‚Äôd think theyre a serial killer üíÄ

**ImADudeDuh** (7): something something the hero this city deserves

**TiltControls** (6.5): Something with a bit more life than this

**CrimsonROSET** (6): idk its kinda sandwiched between better tracks

**1998tweety** (5): a whole lot of nothing

**bogo** (5): it's not this

**runaway3212** (4): me when he's incredibly toxic: yass

**throwaway-7650** (4): the tracklisting really doesn't do this song any favors at all

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): If you‚Äôre gonna be toxic at least have the decency to make it slap.

**flava** (2): oh this was just not even remotely enjoyable at all

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): made me give American Feeling an extra .1 point because I can appreciate the sample in that just a little bit more

**Awkward\_King** (0): my least favourite song called what you need from a rate that includes albums that shaped who creme is as a person

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): This is SO robbed, I know its a swerve after the extreme horniness of the rest of the album but still!! it's so good!!!

**just\_thonking** (7.5): And Miguel takes another hit. Kind of an underwhelming end to such an incredible album, but definitely still enjoyable.

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yeah I think we‚Äôre fucked but at least this song is great.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): post nut clarity

**flava** (10): this is just like if Marvin Gaye ended his album Let‚Äôs Get It On with What‚Äôs Going On (song) and I kinda stan that choice

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): "is he watching / is she watching / are they watching now" kinda the blueprint to "he is just a pony / she is just a pony / they is just a pony"

**Awkward\_King** (9): this might be the most horrid thing ive ever said but why i wanna make a hunger games fancam to this

**TiltControls** (9): oh i love weezer

**shipperondeck** (8.6): the introspective/socially aware final song but it sounds quite good actually

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): ‚Äúis there a god? / is he watching? / is she watching? / are they watching?‚Äù inclusive KING!!

**fadedblue09** (8): not sure what's with the dissonant instrumentation but I dig it

**nt96** (8): Are the Candles in the Sun bright enough for me to see the Cranes in the Sky?

**throwaway-7650** (8): ...did teddy steal a line in pink venom from this song?

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): this can coexist with candles in the wind

**celladonn** (7.5): it's a powerful message but it feels very out of place on this erotic album

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): ctfu at Miguel going from ‚ÄúPussy is Mine‚Äù to a song that opens with asking if there is a god. That little studio talk was not enough to get you out of this one miguel.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): oh yeah this album is from that era where they needed an obligatory political song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i think theres some interesting ideas here that arent explored to their full potential, still a neat outro

**freeofblasphemy** (6.5): As far as overly earnest songs about how the world is bad, it‚Äôs above-average but also I don‚Äôt know what this sort of song is doing in this album

**MiguelWifetoc** (6.5): again, i don't know why he has to flop through the ending of tracks here with a trio of "yeah that's pleasant but not delirious psychedelic or wife guy enough" classics

**vapourlomo** (6): look, I respect the ambition of ending this album on a big "let's save the world!" song, but uh that ain't Miguel's strong suit. Plus, it's WILDLY out of place on this sex jam album lol

**welcome2thejam** (6): Post-nut clarity

**seanderlust** (5.7): @ elton john youre OVER FLOP

**oscarbrierley1** (5): extremely meh about the production but the vocals are great.

**cremeebrulee** (4.5): god being non-binary is the most based take i will give him that

**runaway3212** (4): this also kinda flops

**noavocadoshere** (0): WHAT. you can't go from singing about a situationship to singing about the world's problems. you just...can't, i'm sorry. who lied to miguel and told him THIS was the song to end the album on?

**starla\_** (0): I hate this song. It's boring, too long, and cheesy even for Miguel

**just\_thonking** (8): STREAM GILA!


**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): I barely remember a moment of this one lyrically beyond ‚Äúunless its keys then i play all day‚Äù but the production is so fresh that it doesn‚Äôt even matter until it starts to drag on the back end

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): ‚ÄúThat I‚Äôm only fucking 20‚Äù he made this at 20, what was Liz Truss doing at that age?? Streaming Taylor Swift???

**amr** (10): this song is so one note (compliment) until the second half and I absolutely love it for that. but there's a lot of fun little switchups that keep it from getting boring and the best of those for me are the little ricocheting synth underneath "in that two floor loft in the middle of the city after rolling through the city with me" and the candy eyed way he sings "what U doing in the bathroom? I hear noises in the bathroom" just insanely fake but I live for it each time

**Awkward\_King** (10): not a cellphone in site just young people living, doing drugs, having orgies in the moment

**MiguelWifetoc** (10): Like dude's almost into a self-parody here with the lyrics, enough he uses a finger wagging worthy word. A certain threshold here may be passed. And still this is one of the best instrumentals in the rate? this guy totally threw me off with that bouncy drums and then the rlly funny gtr sample )the fact that mr weeknd understood a certain sect of goth and how to link it into this rather fist-pump bigstack coke bully talk should be commended). but then HE ASCENDS TO A KETAMINE AMBIENT ZONE. AND ITS SO INSULAR. NO ONE'S COMING OUT OF THEIR ROOM. like a lost open zone opn "leave me tf alone" insularity we didn't get on garden of delete. you have to really be in it to want to make THAT kind of sound. that's this mortal coil world building (i dunno what that means but i just applaud that this is on there)

**runaway3212** (10): this man would go on to make the biggest hit ever ang arguably the best pop song ever made

**starla\_** (10): I would be lying if I said I loved the 3 min outro but the first 3 mins more than makes up for it

**throwaway-7650** (10): elevator music \[complimentary\]

**celladonn** (9.5): my brain is melting listening to this production

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): "what‚Äôs good young ho?" cracks me tf up because i can‚Äôt even take the misogyny seriously. it's got the stummy feeling sickly vibes

**akanewasright** (9): ABEL WAS ONLY TWENTY WHEN HE MADE THIS MIXTAPE?????????

**vapourlomo** (9): Abel and Beach House samples: name a better couple

**shipperondeck** (8.5): fuuuuuck this is the fucking proejct ever

**1998tweety** (8): this does fit loft vibes

**bogo** (8): i don't mind the "what's good young ho" line it's funny

**DirtyRat583** (8): this song is like 80% outro wtf

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the pitched ahhs are a bit annoying but at the same time it works really well? This song also drags a bit but there are some good elements in it

**plastichaxan** (7.5): This is good but why did it sound like a parody of himself for the first minute sob

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs good, young ho‚Äù Weeknd sounding like a mad cornball rn

**sarcasticsobs** (7): As a proponent of longer songs, I do not care for this outro much

**welcome2thejam** (7): Ngl discourse turned this into the "what's good young ho" track I can't think about anything else outside of maybe how weird the intro sounds comparatively to the other songs

**fadedblue09** (6.5): This was okay but the long ambient outro was unnecessary

**seanderlust** (6.3): sob abel was really a beach house stan in this era huh

**freeofblasphemy** (6): Hard to get a grasp on this one. I definitely don‚Äôt care for the indulgent wail midsection

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): the last minute of this >>>

**oscarbrierley1** (6): the Outro feels unnecessarily long to me, I'd probably like the song more if it was five minutes instead of six. Even the first half doesn't stand out a huge amount to me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this song wouldve been so much better if it ended at the 3 minute mark and didnt have the long boring extended outro

**sage** (5.8): the first part's instrumental is so fucking annoying like the ah ah oh ah ah ah thing idk but the 2nd half is good

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): lofi music. also all these songs are so long and for what. like it's the third time I lowered scores just because the songs are giving Cool & Collected

**CrimsonROSET** (4): maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm in a bad mood but GOD does this drag too much. TWO MINUTES OF OUTRO?!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Ladies, if he writes songs about you making noises in the bathroom, he ain‚Äôt the one.

**noavocadoshere** (1): this one didn't age well at all. generic then, generic now. i wish this song would end by the time abel asks me what i'm thinking about.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): I‚Äôd like my minutes given back to me, thank you.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): realizing one of the reasons it took my mom years to stop hating The Weeknd was probably that the first time she heard him it was on this song

---

**imfine\_jpg** (10): I'm sorry but this is a 10 and had such a hold on 14 year old me

**AHSWeeknd** (9): A mildly annoying male hoe classic

**cremeebrulee** (9): https://reductress.com/post/how-to-wrap-your-pussy-in-foil-and-put-it-in-the-fridge-since-no-ones-eating-it/

**criticalprocess** (8): god he's so fucking hot

**freeofblasphemy** (8): Getting Abel on this remix was so good huh

**seanderlust** (7.8): ty and the weeknd's verses are my favorites

**vapourlomo** (7.5): oh Wiz. opening every song with that Seth Rogen laugh

**slimboyfriend** (7): I‚Äôm glad he asked for consent before stretching her pussy out

**welcome2thejam** (7): Whoa whoa lemme get some headphones in, jesus christ Abel

**ignitethephoenix** (6.9): this song isn‚Äôt that good but it‚Äôs also iconic for how sexual it is so let me give it this lovely score

**apatel27** (6): The fucking bed squeaks sample I can't

**noavocadoshere** (6): NOT THE SQUEAKY BOOTS AND TY DOLLA $IGN. ugh. when you played this song, was it for the weeknd or nah?

**nt96** (6): well then

**starla\_** (4.5): nah

**MiguelWifetoc** (4): this song lowkey sucks ass but I love that the weeknd is just vibing around as much as him saying "stretch that..." and just continuing to go off. like dude, you can chill here but im gonna keep giggling.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): oh they really have those bed squeaking noises throughout the whole song dont they‚Ä¶

**TiltControls** (4): who was sitting in a squeaky chair for the recording

**babadork** (3.7): I have a lot of nostalgia for this era, but those squeaking beds can fuck right off.

**celladonn** (3): this is one of those unsexy sex songs... and i'm really over songs having bed squeaking sounds in the beat

**indiefan** (3): Yeah I never liked this song. And Abel‚Äôs part just reminds me of all those cringy ass fckboys who would use that song on musical.ly

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Somebody stop that squeaky chair in the background PLEASE.

**cocosairdep** (2): Nah

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): I‚Äôve already been haunted by the time I stanned Wale - Bad ft. Tiara Thomas. I was OBSESSED with this song, and somehow my dummy young ears totally missed that there‚Äôs bed squeaking throughout THE WHOLE SONG. Suddenly, a song I loved I could never listen to again. Now, any song I hear with this damn bed squeaking I have to automatically tank, cannot abide any song that does this.

**sarcasticsobs** (1): JFC, this thing again. Too much for me

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): Need Abel to give away loosies to random rappers to pretend are their songs again. This, Remember You, Pullin Up, Might Not, Some Way. He has so many of these where he makes for a highlight by handing a rapper a nearly complete song to add a verse to and put on their own album

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Who would‚Äôve though Juicy J would be getting TikTok fame because of a Dahmer lyric in the year 2022

**celladonn** (8): what he said about bi girls was so true

**freeofblasphemy** (8): Doesn‚Äôt really know how to end but Abel and Juicy are both at the top of their game here

**indiefan** (7): Had to take a few points off because of Juicy‚Äôs bisexual fetishizing ass

**welcome2thejam** (7): Heard this was originally titled One of These Nights but they saw Don Henley still lurking & made the switch

**babadork** (6.2): I don‚Äôt think the combination of Juicy J and The Weeknd is one that works.

**cremeebrulee** (6): it‚Äôs okay but definitely better than whatever the fuck was going on in the outro of the other juicy j/weeknd collab

**nt96** (6): sounds like Forgot About Dre

**MiguelWifetoc** (5): juicy j is important but this is mid

**seanderlust** (4.5): "Juicy J and The Weeknd hook up on a track that is sure to be a ‚Äòdrugged-out-panty-dropper-banger‚Äô of 2013." - the worst Genius track description I have ever read in my entire life

**starla\_** (4.5): boring

**jackisboredtoday** (10): fuck Don Henley

**just\_thonking** (8): As someone who has spent his life trying to avoid hearing Hotel California at all occasions, I actually don't mind this """sample""" as much as the other ones, but it sucks that it's the reason N,U isn't on streaming.

---

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Look Don Henley has a right to be mad about how extensive this sample is. But it's cool so I give Frank extra points for pissing off a boomer.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Plantation wedding

**amr** (10): I love this song so bad man and I acknowledge that I may not at all if I had heard the eagles version first or at all but I have not so we move. it's just so dreamy and I'm obsessed with how he's able to affect this insanely romantic and melancholy tone for a song that's very clearly meant to be a satirical commentary on the instituion of marriage. amazing guitar solo and not even the hilarious pronunciation of "hijabs" can make me love this any less and while that outro took dozens of listens to grow on me back when I first heard the album...it's grown! and does not detract one bit from the deserving score I'm giving this song

**apatel27** (10): Fuck Don Henley

**celladonn** (10): whatever i love every second of this. the eagles were such bitches for hating this

**letsallpoo** (10): this is a miranda lambert song in disguise

**nt96** (10): shame on you Eagles

**oscarbrierley1** (10): this song made an old white guy angry, for that alone its perfect. Other than that it's a beautiful song. The Outro feels a little unnecessary to me.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): fuck you don henley you $200 million net worth cunt

**sarcasticsobs** (10): \[Big Lebowski voice\]: I hate the fuckin' Eagles, man. Anyways, such a fun time trying to get the full version of this to accurately rate it

**seanderlust** (10): shoutout to my old boss who hated the eagles so vehemently it was a running joke in my department. he was so right for that. fuck you don henley

**throwaway-7650** (10): the controversy score for this song will be of a greater magnitude than the plagiarism controversy itself... and I'm just increasing it!

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): if i was don henley i would be mad as hell too that he made a song better than my entire discography

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): i knocked half a point off because this song is the reason this album will never be on spotify so FAWK YOU THE EAGLES

**1998tweety** (9): omg the guitar im ascending

**akanewasright** (9): Fuck Don Henley

**DirtyRat583** (9): this is kinda cute actually

**shipperondeck** (9): not this scrobbling as Frank Ocean by American Wedding

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): such a good use of a very recognisable sample

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): Don Henley can cry some more

**vapourlomo** (8.5): ...wait, do I like Hotel California?? oh no

**emayzee** (8.3): frank ocean could do hotel california but the eagles couldn't do super rich kids

**TiltControls** (8): the temptation to tank this since it's the reason the album's not on streaming

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): the hotel California production is doing the heavy lifting here but I guess he sounds fine

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Does it all work perfectly? No. Is there value in the attempt? Absolutely (That goes for the tape overall)

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I‚Äôm glad he changed the chorus because the original hook is insufferable

jackisboredtoday: **bogo** (7): fuck don henley

**CrimsonROSET** (7): https://melmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/I_aint_reading_all_that_meme.jpg

**plastichaxan** (6.5): I don‚Äôt know how to feel about the Hotel California sample slkjdf but that outro holy shit

**noavocadoshere** (6.1): oh my god i hate hotel california. the things i do for you, frank ocean. i could take it or leave it, but i appreciate the commitment to driving home the american theme.

**rosapalms** (6): it's a better song than "Hotel California," but the instrumental is so iconic that it's just a weird artistic choice to repurpose it. I wish he would have taken this concept and used it with an original track. A connection to "Hotel California" doesn't elevate this material in any way IMO

**welcome2thejam** (6): Damn I forgot how much of this is just straight Hotel California. Love the "that guitar solo üî•üî•üî•" comments

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Kinda want to give this a higher score just because that Eagles guy sucks but I can‚Äôt lie this one is a little boring.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): hmm. i dont know how to feel about this one! i knew this song had a hotel california sample in it but i didn‚Äôt realize that that sample was going to be basically the entire song, including the vocal melody! i‚Äôve loved hotel california for a long time so hearing a different take on it feels‚Ä¶off, and even though i like frank‚Äôs lyrics and vocals on this it just feels really weird to be rating a song thats basically the exact same as hotel california, except not really. idk, this is very weird to my brain and i have a lot of emotions both positive and negative, it only feels fair to give this a 5 and move on so i dont think too hard on it

**MiguelWifetoc** (4.2): its still really funny and honest, but we have to destroy this instrumental at all costs. we peaked as a society with its usage by the gypsy kings in the big lebowski. like alright man i get it, you should find a better instrumental to make a more coherent point. anyways I still love the reverb he adds near the end, the cassette deck skipping around, and the outro. but no, this is not a sacred cow. kneecap it. that fucking intro alone as he name drops shit is silly. this is all still earnest and "well executed", but we as a society have progressed beyond this.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): listen, it is a nice idea to sing an original song over Hotel California but that doesn‚Äôt automatically make it good, even if the story is nice. Idk I just wouldn‚Äôt risk this much legal trouble over a song that‚Äôs 4/10.

**starla\_** (3.5): I really hate Hotel California so I can't enjoy this

**runaway3212** (3): wayyyy too pretentious

**Awkward\_King** (2): this doesn't surpass or kinda even come close to hotel california for me so i just kinda dont think it needs to exist ?? i cant fundamentally dislike it bc the eagles instrumental is so fucking good but this doesnt do a whole lot. not worth the whole album not being available everywhere sjdskj. would probably be my 0 without the outro

**DaHumanTorch** (0): hotel california is seriously the worst song ever made for me, so this song is my personal hell

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): This whole time when people were so upset with Don Henley, I figured this song featured some type of sample or vague interpolation of Hotel California. I was completely floored when it turns out it‚Äôs LITERALLY THE SONG with Frank singing over it, with his own lyrics. To be clear, I don‚Äôt give a shit about Don Henley and I think it‚Äôs annoying he‚Äôs the reason why this project is not on streaming. However, this song itself is awful. I mean it‚Äôs literally ‚ÄúHotel California‚Äù with Frank singing, in my opinion, pretty trite ‚ÄúAmerican Dream is a lie‚Äù fake-deep lyrics. There are plenty of ‚ÄúAmerican Dream is a lie‚Äù kind of lyrics and songs I don‚Äôt mind, but again this literally just Hotel California. I simply want to point and say this song sucks while people try to explain why I should like it- i know how the history of sampling in music works, and for me here it‚Äôs a total fail. I think The Eagles song is fine enough, but this whole song combined is just corniness personified and will literally never put this song on again.

**fadedblue09** (0): Wow‚Ä¶a disaster in every way possible. From Frank's phoned-in vocals, and the barely-changed instrumental‚Ä¶.yeah the Eagles were so valid for striking this. His fans may think he's a genius for making this but to me this is just pure laziness.

**flava** (0): yeah just dont sample Hotel California this blatantly, not because it is some stone cold classic that no one should touch, but because it‚Äôs just so distracting

**just\_thonking** (8.5): One of my favorite non-singles from N,U.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i‚Äôm gonna assume that the moon landing line is deeper and not with my gut reaction that frank ocean believes the moon landing is fake

**runaway3212** (10): the marriage line he spilled fr fr

**throwaway-7650** (10): omg frank's a "america never landed on the moon" conspiracist

**akanewasright** (9): Bro really thought he could deny the moon landing and get away with it

**CrimsonROSET** (9): and he succeeds!

**shipperondeck** (9): moon landing deniers anthem

**MiguelWifetoc** (8.5): some people will tell you "we all cry". miss me with that. tell me "we all try" and then share your feelings about christianity and why you swing different than the odd future kids. rock on sir.

**starla\_** (8.5): kinda lame but still good

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): need the b.o.b. flat earther vs frank ocean moon landing conspiracy theorist debate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Well as far as celebrities believing conspiracy theories go I‚Äôll take the moon landing skepticism over most other stuff.

**seanderlust** (8): frank slipping into an unrelated song that he believes we faked the moon landing is hilarious i'm ngl

**Stryxen** (8): btw i wanna give bitches talkin interlude a 10 just putting it out there

**TheQueenofCultures** (8): The moon landing denial lyric took me out

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): and we don‚Äôt all succeed, that‚Äôs ok <3

**1998tweety** (7.5): same

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): this sounds great but the lyrics are‚Ä¶ hmm, much to unpack without saying anything deep at all. Who asked for Frank‚Äôs take on abortion, and is he a moon landing conspiracy theorist or no?!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): if you ignore the fact that this song is anti abortion its pretty good

**fadedblue09** (7): very contemplative lyrics, but it kinda went nowhere

**welcome2thejam** (7): 1 out of 3 rate artists are moon truthers. Feel free to speculate which ones for future rates

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): he really said they faked the moon landing then came out on the same song like DUDE

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Ah yes‚Ä¶ that R&B drum beat

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): ‚ÄúI don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon‚Äù can‚Äôt believe in 2022 I‚Äôm learning that Frank is a Kubrick moon truther

**TiltControls** (6): fitting title

**freeofblasphemy** (5.5): This is like a cornball first attempt at Blonde (with superfluous drums) but his delivery redeems it some

**slimboyfriend** (5): his love-is-love-pro-choice-moon-landing-was-faked moment

**amr** (4): try harder

**noavocadoshere** (4): past avocado probably ate this up, especially the 'love is love' line. present avocado is not one for sentimental songs like this (as seen with candles) however so.
