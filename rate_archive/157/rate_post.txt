The Alt-R&B Rate: The Weeknd vs Miguel vs Frank Ocean
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/x486n5/the_altrb_rate_the_weeknd_vs_miguel_vs_frank_ocean/

Hello XOs, Oceanographers, and Miguelheads! We are your hosts,  /u/jackisboredtoday and /u/just_thonking, and we welcome you to the Alt-R&B rate, where we will be ranking and rating songs from three projects from the early 2010s that shaped the R&B scene. This rate covers two debut mixtapes and a studio album from three giants of R&B: The Weeknd, Frank Ocean, and Miguel. All three projects received critical acclaim and pushed the genre in a darker direction with strong influences from other genres like hip-hop and alt-rock---and all three projects will be super fun to rate whether you are a longtime fan, first-time listener, or somewhere in between!

Without further ado, onto out first project...

# The Weeknd - House of Balloons

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7zCODUHkfuRxsUjtuzNqbd) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/house-of-balloons-original/1558941834)

Before he was a global superstar, Abel Tesfaye was a mystery. In late 2010, he began generating buzz in the blogosphere by uploading his shadowy yet intricate R&B music to YouTube (and being featured on Drake's blog) all while remaining anonymous under the name "The Weeknd." In March of 2011, he lived up to the growing hype by releasing his debut mixtape, House of Balloons, on his website for free. 

The mixtape features nine tracks of dark, atmospheric R&B with smooth vocals and lyrics centered on partying, cocaine, and existential despair. Behind the nocturnal themes and lush production there is also a diverse palette of samples ranging from Cocteau Twins to Aaliyah. The mixtape included the single "Wicked Games," which charted at #53 on the Billboard 100 and went double platinum. In addition to its commercial success, House of Balloons received much critical acclaim; it was rated the third best project of the year on Metacritic and given Best New Music status by Pitchfork. The mixtape, as well as several individual tracks, made it onto many year-end and decade-end lists.

Since its release in 2011, the impact of House of Balloons has only grown. While the Weeknd has become a Superbowl-performing, record-breaking megastar, the pop and R&B landscape has re-formed in his moody image, reflected in projects like Lorde's Pure Heroine and Usher's "Climax." As The FADER puts it, "\[House of Balloons\] looms large over everything we've heard. It made happy songs passe. It made the very concept of contentment seem lame."

# Miguel - Kaleidoscope Dream

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/21XMv0TCsnhWPt7MNVvkzD) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/kaleidoscope-dream/561709112)

The most classic-R&B styled album in this rate, and the only project here to both be a studio album and not be a debut, Miguel Pimentel had already established himself as a rising star in the R&B scene with his debut album “All I Want Is You,” which spun of hits with its title track and “Sure Thing,” but on his second album he made a conscious effort to expand his sound and make a more focused and cohesive album, working with collaborators including Salaam Remi, Pop & Oak, and Alicia Keys, among others. The product, Kaleidoscope Dream, brought him to new levels of prominence both critically and commercially. The album earned him his first top 20 hit and his first pop radio exposure with lead single “Adorn,” and didn’t stop there, spinning off additional chart runs for subsequent singles “Do You..” and a remix of “How Many Drinks” with then-new rapper Kendrick Lamar. Critically, meanwhile, the album was well-received by outlets both mainstream (multiple Grammy nominations, including Song of the Year for “Adorn”) and in indie circles (Best New Music from Pitchfork, #5 in the Pazz and Jop year-end critics’ poll).

In the beginning of the 2010s, one of the most buzzed-about names in music was the Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All collective, who which built a name on the shock-rap of leader Tyler, the Creator coming off a heavily publicized VMA win for Best New Artist and other rising members like Earl Sweatshirt and Domo Genesis. As the group built its name, however, Frank Ocean emerged as the introspective and melodic core of the collective with his earnest, soulful vocals and buzz being built up through his songwriting for artists like Brandy, Beyoncé and Justin Bieber. In 2011 he made good on that hype by finally releasing his first mixtape “Nostalgia, Ultra.” The tape mixed Ocean’s hook-writing bonafides with a confessional and soulful writing style that would come to define his future work and proved a breakthrough moment for Ocean, earning him his first charting single with the success of “Novacane.” While the mixtape was never able to be sold commercially as a whole due to sample clearance issues, Frank also offers up some impressive reinterpretations of songs ranging from Coldplay to MGMT to even using The Eagles’ “Hotel California” on the song “American Wedding,” and the project has seen wide critical acclaim in the years since, appearing on decade-end lists from Rolling Stone and Spin, among others.

\#Rules & Instructions

PLEASE READ THESE THOROUGHLY TO AVOID HAVING TO DEAL WITH ANY PROBLEMS WITH YOUR BALLOT LATER.

* **You must listen to and score every song in the main rate.** Ballots with missing scores will not be accepted.
* **Your scores must be on a scale from 1 to 10** and can include one decimal place but no more. So 8.2 is fine but 8.25 is not.
* **You may give one song in the whole main rate a score of 11 and one other a score of 0** so, if you want to award these scores, save them for your favourite and least favourite songs in the rate respectively.
* **We encourage you to leave comments** of your general thoughts or reasoning behind your scores on any songs you wish. If you choose to do so however, **they must be in this format**, simply leaving one space after your score:  
Wicked Games: 6 Him bringing shame and pain while she brings the drank seems like an uneven trade.  
Any other format such as:  
Strawberry Swing: I prefer Apple (10)  
Do You...: 1: Do I what??  
will get your ballot rejected.
* If you'd like to leave a comment on any of the albums as a whole they must be formatted like this, leaving colon then a space after the album title, for example:Album: House of Balloons: comment here
* **Your ballot must be formatted exactly like the template in the message link** so make sure you use it or the template in the backup pastebin for your scores to be accepted.
* **Your scores will not be confidential** and will be revealed, along with any comments, with your username attached.
* **DO NOT SABOTAGE** the rate by giving outrageously low/high scores for the sole purpose of skewing the results, we reserve the right to exclude any ballot we suspect of this. If you're worried your scores could be mistakenly perceived as such, all you need to do is leave comments explaining the reasoning behind them.
* **If you want to change any of your scores** or comments after you've already submitted your ballot, feel free to message me before the deadline either here on reddit or find me or my cohost u/just_thonking in the [Popheads Discord](https://discord.gg/57C67VBs).
