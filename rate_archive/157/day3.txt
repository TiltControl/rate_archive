**jackisboredtoday** (10): One of my favorite album openers of all-time, this sets the tone so well, and the way the beat comes in on the hook is INSANE. This made day 3 with an 8.5 average and honestly it still feels kinda robbed

**just\_thonking** (10): Now THIS is how you open an album. Instant captivation.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “you don’t know what’s in store.” THATS HOW YOU OPEN A WHOLE DISCOGRAPHY

**akanewasright** (10): the way the producer of this song is the guy who co-writes and produces all of Ava Max’s songs

**amr** (10): can't say anything coherent about a mixtape that's like fused itself into my spinal chord over the past decade so I'm just gonna say what my favorite part of each song is. lyrically this one isn't all there which is fine cos it works considering the album's um...pacing. but my favorite moment is definitely the drums before the second chorus. crazy!!

**cremeebrulee** (10): not to inflate a man's ego, but there’s something so ingenious about this being not only the opener of the mixtape, but also the opener to the abel's career as a whole. like did any of us know what we were in for??

**ignitethephoenix** (10): absolutely a perfect intro song. I love the atmosphere of this and how it sets the tone for the project. One of my favorite songs by him and I love love so much listening to this

**MiguelWifetoc** (10): dude legit opens his album swinging big fucking willie "u don't know what yr in for"!??!!?!?! like WOW bro WANTS this and straight up sends. he's bringing a NEW vibe.

**noavocadoshere** (10): MY GOD WHAT AN OPENING. beginning on high for this feels extremely unfair, it's such a memorable opener.

**plastichaxan** (10): How I wish I was right now

**sage** (10): history

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I got shivers down my spine the first time I heard 1:17 and lost my shit the first time I heard the percussion come in at 2:31, the latter might be my favorite singular part on the whole project

**seanderlust** (10): the musical soundscape here is just so damn sexy. it feels custom built for abel's pained falsetto, to the point where the best cover of it i can think of only worked because ellie goulding drastically changed the musical background. high for this sets the tone perfectly for the album it kicks off, and outside of album context just goes so damn hard

**TheQueenofCultures** (10): banger

**throwaway-7650** (10): my 11 coming into the rate :woeis: hope it gets one pleek...

**vapourlomo** (10): An absolutely chilling opening. When that sledgehammer synth bass hits during the chorus?? whew!

**welcome2thejam** (10): I'm doing this at 2:45 pm on a Wednesday this is not a good time to get high

**thedoctordances1940** (9.8): this is how you open an album

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): I don’t much care for the lyrical content but musically I love this, the soaring almost industrial synths hit so hard

**celladonn** (9): ugh what an eerie and evocative opener, sets the tone for the rest of the mixtape so well

**runaway3212** (9): love the vibes makes me feel wanted instead of a loser doing rates sunday evening

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): holy FUCK what an intro

**TiltControls** (9): Fantastic way to open the album. Don't need to be high on anything to enjoy this album (though you can be!)

**1998tweety** (8.5): high for this cause I'm ascending

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): Well as luck would have it, I am! Perfect introduction into the Doom Generation album for the Tumblr generation. That drop with the dirty bass is so good

**CrimsonROSET** (8): is this implication his vocals sound better when i’m taking acid

**starla\_** (8): I'm high for this rate

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.8): i’m actually very sober while I do my rate comments and just ate a bunch of chocolate covered almonds

**shipperondeck** (7.5): me who has never even touched a blunt in her whole life be like. yass so true

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): all raters should be high when rating

**bogo** (7): abel i cannot legally do that i would get kicked out of college

**Awkward\_King** (6): this sets the tone well for the rest of the album its just a shame the albums tone isnt like my fave thing in the world just like... how many songs in the world do we need of abel singing about taking a key of coke of a models' nipple like

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I get that it’s like…atmospheric. But it’s also kinda boring.

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): I was gonna give this a higher score for this (like a 5-6) but then it didn't end for so long I got irritated

**just\_thonking** (11): My favorite thing about Frank Ocean as an artist is his storytelling, and Swim Good is a prime example. The imagery he creates with this song, a desperate man in a bloody car driving into the ocean to "swim from something bigger than \[him\]" is such an evocative depiction of suicide, heartbreak, and the need to escape. I love how the car in this song serves as a symbol both of freedom/escapism and of death and confinement---a literal hearse filled with dead bodies. And on top of it all it's just a super catchy, lively, well-produced song that is thankfully on streaming!

**jackisboredtoday** (10): And we finally lose one of the Frank songs that actually did make it to streaming here!! Swim Good kinda gets overshadowed by Novacane being the bigger hit from the record, but while it isn’t quite as catchy I think it’s got some of Frank’s best storytelling

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Speaking of swimming, is the name “Frank Ocean” a stage name?

**amr** (10): some of U have never kicked off Ur shoes and swam good and it's sad :\\

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I’m about to pull up Novacane and this song on Apple Music…and stream good.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the grip this song had on tumblr gays everywhere

**rosapalms** (10): mysterious and foreboding, a masterpiece

**runaway3212** (10): yass

**TheQueenofCultures** (10): GATTACA Vibes

**throwaway-7650** (10): me making a lazy host comment for the RoL song in PEGGED

**starla\_** (9.5): Frank Ocean's School for Kids Who Can't Swim Good

**noavocadoshere** (9): when nostalgia, ultra is good, IT IS GOOD. swim good is a phenomenal track.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): oh this is nice I can’t believe I’ve never heard it before

**emayzee** (8.7): high school me should be jailed for countless reasons but the fact that i used to prefer ed sheeran's cover to the this is a major offense

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): this placement will be interesting because it's got both singles bias and available-on-streaming bias

**TiltControls** (8.5): the mgk jumpscare

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): September rates with songs about swimming across the sea alliance

**bigbigbee** (8): The downside of listening to this album on Youtube is that I got an incredibly inappropriately chipper ad for Wayfair in the middle of this gorgeous, sobering suicide metaphor

**CrimsonROSET** (8): frank sweetie you cant drive on water you’re gonna sink

**MiguelWifetoc** (7.2): yeah man swim in that ocean, do it

**1998tweety** (7): cant relate

**frogaranaman** (7): swim good to Heartless vocoder pipeline

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): and FUCK YOU MGK!!!

**freeofblasphemy** (6): Kinda feels like a Sparknotes version of an early Frank Ocean song

**oscarbrierley1** (5): I was in a club recently and the dj put this on. The dancefloor emptied. I think that describes how I feel about this song.

**sage** (4.6): 🛌

**just\_thonking** (10): This was the first song I ever heard from House of Balloons and gets better with every listen. Hearing this live was such a pleasure.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): SUCH a classic within Abel’s discography, every lyric hits and its deserving of continuing to be referenced throughout his future projects like BBTM and After Hours

---

**shipperondeck** (11): the fucking song

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant” is he also a midwife?

**akanewasright** (10): “girl put in work” me when I’m doing a group project and the other kids are slacking

**amr** (10): when the guitar starts the song but also when it loops and fades out at the end with the trap drums. BUT ALSO! the last verse...I think he's very talented at telling a story w his voice, like he genuinely sounds stressed as hell singing there

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh yeah this is the pussy of the album.

**emayzee** (10): in high school some kid used "money is the motive 💸💯😈" as an instagram caption and my friends and i found it hilarious for whatever reason and it became a running joke. so to this day i still think of that kid when i hear this song

**ignitethephoenix** (10): amazing song but while listening to this I just recalled that Taylor Swift told The Weeknd that she loved this song and then touched his hair 🥴

**MiguelWifetoc** (10): like pacing wise, he's just done a lil' sketch of a night and then decides to do THIS kind of quixotic yet bittersweet instrumental. that totally nails the rnb fit down to the suit n' tie. that silk gtr really at a crossroads, as the trap beats just dead eye their way to the finish. THEN THOSE LYRICS. the red eyes, the bullshit dreams, but when he says he's gonna push you and tells you "girl put in work", he seems not to be bluffing. the girl (abel) did put in work!

**sarcasticsobs** (10): These synths just waaaash over me

**starla\_** (10): this is my favourite mixtape-era Weeknd song, despite the cringy 'six months pregnant' line. I was 18 when this mixtape came out and this song in particular gives me so much nostalgia for my partying era.

**Stryxen** (10): trying not to get h word in the rate comments sorry

**TiltControls** (10): Abel's control over this track is masterful

**vapourlomo** (10): ah yes we love Uncut Gems, don't we folks

**welcome2thejam** (10): Getting hot & heavy for this guitar sound tbh

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): this could honestly fit really snugly in BBTM as a cute little prequel to “in the night”

**runaway3212** (9): i am so vibing honestly

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): How this transitions from woozer to banger is inspiring. The drums are amazing and “Got the walls kickin’ like they six months pregnant” is iconic

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): the instrumental is so good. The chorus is really catchy, but it maybe gets a little repetitive by the end.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i went to look for this song on genius so i didnt jump to conclusions and the universe punished me by telling me this is one of taylor swift’s favorite songs and i dont know what that says about anything

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): knew this was gonna slay after 10 seconds in like who am i to turn away an opening guitar solo like that

**throwaway-7650** (8): this song has the same dog arf arf arf-ing as loona yves - new

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): "got the walls kicking like theyre six months pregnant" monet this is WILD

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): this song reminds me of that trend in the early 2010s of indie bands ironically covering rap songs but singing them

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): more like the mourning amirite

**1998tweety** (7): he bops a bit

**noavocadoshere** (4): ...this is the equivalent of sitting on the beach after a bonfire, nursing a hangover and hoping you don't throw up. not a fan.

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): imagine if this was a 5 minute ambient interlude. yeah instead the walls are kicking 6 months pregnant.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): she sounds gorgeous but this is a mid-tier song in the context of 4 era for me

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Beyoncé struck gold with 4, then did again with the albums that followed. All of her albums are such masterpieces… except Sasha Fierce

**akanewasright** (10): this is a touch simpler than the others but like… man this song has a special place in my heart

**MK** (10): pretending this is superpower so I can give it a 10

**RandomHypnotica** (10): you know maybe the frankprint is obvious here in retrospect

**runaway3212** (9): iconic slay but kinda weak for beyonce

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): eh

**cremeebonuss** (6.5): this era of beyonce just came and went for me unfortunately

**king** (4): in terms of frank and bey collabs it is no pink + white

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): a song I didn’t listen to much at all back when this album first came out, but where I’ve grown to like it more as I got old enough to get it. Still a bit too long though

---

**akanewasright** (11): Basically a perfectly realized song

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Plastic Off The Sofa is this but the relationship has aged 9 years

**runaway3212** (10): when she goes “goddammit im comfortable in my skin… and you’re comfortable in my skin” lives changed

**indie\_fan\_** (9.8): Almost a ten, but the length coulda been shortened for about a minute.

**MK** (9): the weakest of these songs by far but I can't tank

**cremeebonuss** (8): MIGUEL WROTE THIS? that actually makes a lot of sense bye ...... i remember hearing this at 17 and literally being so embarrassed . honestly this song still makes me blush a little

**RandomHypnotica** (8): it's alright

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): the Miguel really jumped out here, I just wish it was a bit shorter

**seanderlust** (6): incredible soundscape and beyonce being flirty and fun, but this lasts way too long. also why is she talking about instagram and baby boomers in a song about boning?

**jackisboredtoday** (11): Legit one of my favorite Beyoncé songs of all-time. You should have seen me jumping all over the room when I was watching the Lemonade premiere and the Abel vocals came in

---

**AHSWeeknd** (11): Abel presented her with a song about a stripper and Beyoncé said “let’s give her emotions” then made the second half of this gem.

**cremeebonuss** (11): ... yeah duh this is my fave lemonade song 😭 i dont think i will ever be as gagged by a surprise feature the way i was with this. the film version is superior tho i wish it matched the streaming one

**ignitethephoenix** (11): the joint slay

**MK** (11): it's on lemonade so

**RandomHypnotica** (11): i can't believe beyonce and abel invented sex appeal

**runaway3212** (11): she literally slays so fucking much it’s insane

**indie\_fan\_** (10): I remember watching the visuals for this just thinking "ooh chile, the white conspiracy theorists gon' be donating some tears tonight!"

**king** (10): anyone who gives this a 6 for the bit is being taken out back and shot

**seanderlust** (10): incredible banger. this was a standout on LEMONADE when I first heard it, and being a standout on an album that good takes talent

**akanewasright** (9): okay this is a great song but like the others are among my favorite Beyoncé songs ever…

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): The first of the many instrumental-jacks here, this one has always worked well for me, even though it isn’t on my top tier of Frank material, and given its placement it feels like a lot of you agreed, making it the best-placing sample on the album

**just\_thonking** (6): The original Coldplay song is a 10 but this is unfortunately way too similar for me to rate this very highly. It's giving Rihanna's "Same Ol' Mistakes"

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): the feeling this song captures is so hnnghh to me like there’s something so nostalgic about it and something just makes me emotional. also i didn’t even know this was a coldplay cover for, like, years LOL

**RandomHypnotica** (11): oh this is pretty pretty

**seanderlust** (11): this song gives me full body goosebumps. the concept behind the song is gorgeous, the sampling is perfect...this is one of my favorite frank songs

**TheQueenofCultures** (11): One for the Spotify Local Files me thinks

**TiltControls** (11): You're giving this an 11 since it's a beautifully performed track with amazing lyrics. I'm giving my 11 since it samples my favourite coldplay song

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is how you set a vibe for an album!

**bigbigbee** (10): THANK YOU COLDPLAY!!! I forgive you for being indirectly responsible for the Glee version of Fix You!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Vote for (insert idea with Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends in it) next cycle.

**cremeebrulee** (10): apocalyptic love songs are really the pinnacle of music

**fadedblue09** (10): An enchanting intro, very dissonant but dreamy

**flava** (10): this is just such a romantic dream of a song

**nt96** (10): God this is just gorgeous. Everything about this song sets the that yearning tone for the rest of the album. The Coldplay sample, which in turn sampled Brian Eno's An Ending was superb! Feels like I'm floating on a cloud.

**plastichaxan** (10): This is such a strong start so powerful

**rosapalms** (10): this is the direct instrumental repurposing that really works on this tape.

**runaway3212** (10): god it's just such a good fucking song

**shipperondeck** (10): i love the original and this is even better

**vapourlomo** (10): look, man, Frank could read the phone book using that perfect Coldplay melody and it'd still get a 10

**welcome2thejam** (10): Gotta say, few things in life feel more nostalgic than the Strawberry Swing guitar line & melody. Perfect song to sample

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): alarm clock jumpscare

**1998tweety** (9.5): ascending a bit oh wow

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): god this song is beautiful. i hate you frank ocean

**celladonn** (9.5): crazy how nostalgic this song about nostalgia makes me! his mind!

**MiguelWifetoc** (9.4): dude this shit hits so goddamn hard with 1 beer after work while real tired. the coldplay shit is still so goddamn funny and genius.

**emayzee** (9.2): chris martin found jobless

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): the original is good but he just turns it into such a beautiful song

**CrimsonROSET** (9): big movie starting energy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): I like this but I often HATE alarm clock sounds in songs and by God had to use so much strength in me not to tank cuz of that

**ImADudeDuh** (9): if you know you know

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Pretty

**slimboyfriend** (9): Frank’s voice adds so much more emotion and makes that “sky could be blue…” coda pop way more

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): as a resident Coldplay stan here who also loves the original song, I love how he took the instrumental and did his own lyrics about growing up over it. The only thing that bugs me his how his cadence/the way he sings certain parts doesn’t match up with the with beat of the song. But this is a great version still. Also VOTE FOR THE 2000’S BRITISH ALT ROCK CLASSICS SO WE CAN RATE THE ORIGINAL ALSO!!

**sage** (8.6): the ending slayed

**starla\_** (8.5): I love Viva la Vida

**frogaranaman** (8): the Coldplay sample… Frank is sick for that

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): so glad ive never listened to the original coldplay version of this because im sure its worse and will ruin my enjoyment of this

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): muv-luv unlimited

**bogo** (7): yeah it's good but it's essentially the same song as the coldplay version, i could just listen to that instead

**Stryxen** (6.5): kinda the only miss but not even a miss (pretending nature feels is a hoax and didnt happen)

**freeofblasphemy** (6): My Coldplay adversary of Viva La Vida strikes again. I def prefer Frank with as little or no percussion as possible and he’s definitely enhanced his nostalgia-conjuring abilities since this. Also, alarm clock sounds? Who are you, Superorganism?

**noavocadoshere** (4): i'm in an indie movie where we walk across abbey road, jump into lakes hand-in-hand and there's a love triangle. i don't like it.

**oscarbrierley1** (0): I always found this song really irritating for some reason. I also hate songs with alarm sounds in them.

The energy, the performance, it’s all there and I just want to thank the pro-uptempo bias on popheads for helping this accomplish what it deserved

**just\_thonking** (9.6): Great song, properly rated.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): OKAY PRODUCTION/BEAT

**amr** (10): my only 11 contender of his songs like who hid this from me. sickening outro too and it doesn't sound the least bit sleazy that's real charm

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This sounds like a very yassified Halloween song.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this production... i ascended

**CrimsonROSET** (10): it’s giving detective noir opening credits where we get a montage and it’s in black and white with only some parts in color and i LIVE FOR THIS SHIT

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): DRAMA

**nt96** (10): ugh I'm ascending so hard rn

**plastichaxan** (10): Hello??? I thought something random had came on instead of the next song in the album

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me when i have a stiff neck

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I love Télépopmusik

**sarcasticsobs** (10): qwhat teh hell is that opening?? Oh god, it comes back!! Wild switch to the outro

**starla\_** (10): I love the driving riff on this

**welcome2thejam** (10): The drums sound incredible here. Time of the Season cover is definitely a choice, but everything before it rocks so we can sidestep the move

**MiguelWifetoc** (9.6): this fucking blown out HUMONGOUS production is SO goddamn funny. i got a taste of it months back while listening to Danny Brown's Old. here, he kills it and THEN unlocks a bonus zone. also, good drum (sample?)

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): oh so this was supposed to be the album opener but the label wanted the big single to be the first song.

**1998tweety** (9): a bit repetitive but GOOD

**bogo** (9): that intro gave me whiplash lol i was not expecting that, but it's great

**flava** (9): Miguel making this dramatic ass song about asking his partner to leave him cause during the night he’s going to cheat on her. You’d think I hate this, but man Miguel just has an irresistible charisma about him that kinda works. He’s aware he is a sleazy and slutty, and the way he paints it as if he’s like a werewolf adds an element of shame and guilt to the song

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This would be a 10 if it wasn’t for the outro

**noavocadoshere** (9): miguel's very cinematic with his production. very big screen blockbuster with explosions and car scenes. love the time of the season reference here. i won't look back, you convinced me.

**runaway3212** (9): orpheus

**shipperondeck** (9): why does this sound so Epic lol

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): action movie hero song - is that why there is so much static or w/e in the background? the only fault with otherwise a 10

**vapourlomo** (9): god this synth psych production is SO COOL

**celladonn** (8.5): ok sexy vampire anthem

**TiltControls** (8): orpheus take notes

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): What an era for sampling/interpolation in R&B. This is already a weird sci-fi Broadway musical that closes in three months before the “Time of the Season” cover kicks in. Just amazing even if not entirely successful

**seanderlust** (7.5): the angels to Lot for some reason when instructing him to flee their village

**Stryxen** (6): SO dramatic. And maybe… just hear me out… maybe a little TOO dramatic!!! Gasp!

**akanewasright** (4.5): There’s something about the chorus and the synths that just doesn’t hit my ears right at all… bonus points for the outro though

**just\_thonking** (10): For a while this was Miguel's highest rated song, which was a pleasant surprise. I'm glad it got lots of love from popheads because it's genuinely incredible. Especially that high note...

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): One of the biggest fan favorites in the entire rate, this got a ton of 11s, and if it were a single I think it would have gotten even higher than it already did. I think the result it got is about right, since I’m not one of the diehard shooters this song definitely has, but as I got into registers I started to get what the Miguelheads see in it

---

**flava** (11): It isn’t that surprising that the album I’m most familiar with gets my 11. That’s usually how it is with these anyway. But this song is genuinely special. And I’m gonna write an essay about this song. Because it connects to me on a really personal level. Because as someone who identifies as demisexual. This hits on a whole different level, to the point it almost feels like a demisexual anthem, which coming from Miguel is really unexpected considering the rest of the album. But there is an intimacy and closeness that suggests an emotional connection has already been thoroughly established before the song even starts with the way the psychedelic buzz begins and Miguel’s charismatic voice starts. But Miguel feels off here compared to the rest of the album, there is a timid hesitancy in his voice that puts him in this nervous position. He so badly wants this, more than anything, but the idea of sharing himself and his body like this still terrifies him. To be this emotionally and physically intimate and vulnerable with someone else can be scary, especially when you like it only under specific circumstances. And as someone who is horrible at reading people and gets too attached too quickly, I can think someone might like me more than they actually do, and that can really lead to me second guessing every thought that goes through my head and I can hear those second guesses in this song, in his voice. But sometimes, shutting down those anxieties can lead to bliss, and that’s what this song is. Euphoric bliss when all that build up and intimacy pays off into something pure and beautiful. The intense climax of the bridge that just explodes all over the song. This is beautiful song, I can’t wait to feel pain when it doesn’t win

**indiefan** (11): The EPITOME of rawness and passion mixed into one. Also, we all know HOB/GTG gon’ win, so might as well level the playing field.

**starla\_** (11): one of the horniest songs on the album (if you like this, definitely give his album Wildheart a listen!). I tossed up between this and The Morning for my 11 but decided to go with the underdog

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Wait so is he nervous? Is she nervous? Is this about being a virgin??? I’m so confused but I’m sold on this.

**amr** (10): I love earthbound

**Awkward\_King** (10): horny so horny

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): POV: You’re drugs.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): DRAMA

**freeofblasphemy** (10): Making a song about men embracing submissive roles in the bedroom that manages to feel commanding but vulnerable at the same time is amazing. This is so hot but also so heartwarming

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): another 11 contender for sure

**RandomHypnotica** (10): damn he’s just like me

**runaway3212** (10): lowkey like get a room

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this song is such a grower, the horny-on-main yet vulnerable vibe is very real

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Who is doing the instrumentals on this thing? BASS guitar. Hitting every dopamine receptor in my brain. His vocals go off, but that goes without saying

**seanderlust** (10): this is probably my favorite miguel track

**throwaway-7650** (10): roxie's 11 in 2018 indie pop:

**vapourlomo** (10): just incredibly hot

**welcome2thejam** (10): If I had that kind of voice I'd be screaming shit like "defile me" too

**shipperondeck** (9.8): oh what the hell nice guitar??

**TiltControls** (9.5): i wonder how many horny comments we'll get for this

**akanewasright** (9): I am not writing thirst comments about Miguel… I am not writing thirst comments about Miguel…….. I am not writing thirst comments about Miguel…………

**celladonn** (9): it's rare for me to find songs about sex actually sexy but umm. this is very sexy

**CrimsonROSET** (9): bonk

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): thrush me. also these two songs go full vgi in the end. kinda funny

**MiguelWifetoc** (8.2): this is again, just a really funny good execution. idk why im imagining his flow in the way left chainsmoker delivers the flow of "closer (ft. halsey)", but i am. also that crosswalk sound effect in there is so good. what the FUCK is it with "lights on" horny times and what not? like fka twigs make a big deal about it on LP1's second track.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this sounds like the slowed and reverbed version of itself

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): the chorus us catchy but it needs a bit more of a beat behind it for me to love it.

**cremeebrulee** (7.4): okay girl, we’re still gonna need a top tho..

**fadedblue09** (6.5): His vocal range is impressive, but ultimately repetitive

**noavocadoshere** (5): maybe a little too cinematic. less is more. the instrumental drowns out his vocals here. with balance, it would've been nice.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): Frank hard-carries this with the hook tbh, but it feels like kinda a culmination of late-period Jay’s philosophy and image in a way. Anyway I would say Watch the Throne rate when but the last month or so has happened so maybe this is the last kanye we’re rating for awhile

**just\_thonking** (8): Wow very cool for Jay-Z and Frank Ocean to team up on this song!

---

**apatel27** (10): Let me 11 this you cowards

**MiguelWifetoc** (10): this one is really a slapper

**RandomHypnotica** (10): yeah this deserves to win the bonus

**throwaway-7650** (10): alicia keys in the main rate but not the bonus rate? what's empire state of mind doing here

**criticalprocess** (9): best song on watch the throne

**akanewasright** (8): not Kanye’s South Park line… has he seen the gay fish episode 😭

**rc5568** (8): why did you guys not choose no church in the wild instead of this smh

**babadork** (7.5): This is three good to great songs that is trying and failing to be one song. Maybe Jay Z and Frank Ocean’s parts go together, but Kanye is too off-topic.

**seanderlust** (7.5): I love the chorus here. overall this is a celebration of black success flying in the face of american discrimination. the shoutsout to black icons is excellent, and ye and jay both bring great verses. while this wasn't one of my favorites off of WTT, that isn't saying that much because watch the throne is such an incredible album that even the worst songs on there are still fantastic.

**sarcasticsobs** (7): That beep in the background got real annoying tbh

**welcome2thejam** (7): Frank's hook pulls a pretty massive carryjob tbh, and even then it might run too much by the end

**AHSWeeknd** (6): This album was conceptually better.

**cremeebrulee** (5): honestly not one of my faves on WTT

**freeofblasphemy** (5): Alright, it’s not too controversial now to say Watch the Throne kinda sucks now, right? Individual parts of it are fine but does anyone listen to it and think “Wow Jay and Kanye are really bringing out the best in each other?” This song is fine. Frank’s hook is nice. It’s just so much less than the sum of its parts

**noavocadoshere** (5): sweet baby jesus, i really don't like sentimental/uplifting songs. TIL.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): is this a demo…? why does it sound so barebones and unfinished

**vapourlomo** (5): I love Watch The Throne, but this has always been one of my least favorites. Now...if we were rating Paris, or HAM, or Otis?? Very different story

**starla\_** (4.5): I love Watch the Throne so much but this by far the worst song on it

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): Cole is the most overrated rapper in the whole game if you ask me but honestly the singles from Born Sinner were the best music he ever made, he was making better work than his debut but hadn’t gotten up his own ass the way he would by the time 2014 Forest Hills Drive dropped. This was such a fun little bop

---

**starla\_** (10): J. Cole rate when

**rc5568** (9): that hook is butter

**vapourlomo** (9): Remember when J. Cole was like "I'm gonna go head to head with Yeezus!" with this album? And now nobody remembers Born Sinner? Anyway this song is pretty great

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): :irenenotes:

**AHSWeeknd** (7): The early 2010s were annoying

**noavocadoshere** (7): if you know you know with this one. marvin's room for j. cole fans.

**welcome2thejam** (7): Not quite as strong of a Two Man Power Trip as Triple H & Stone Cold, but still good

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Miguel u should have saved this hook for a better song

**seanderlust** (5.3): i feel like when people talk about some of the best MCs currently in the game, j. cole comes up. breaking my silence: I have never been able to get into him. I respect his work, I can tell he's a talented man, I think his discog is just not for me.

**freeofblasphemy** (5): Feel like this could be a pretty good beat with a different mix. And uh, a much better song with someone besides J. Cole on the mic!

**MiguelWifetoc** (4): "The nostalgia of me being in college..nothing but studying, going to the beach, and kicking it with friends. I’ll give anything to have it back. But here I am, 29 years old and finally a home owner and I gotta say I feel just fine where I’m at. I hope you all find that same feeling" what the fuck kind of comment is this? homeowner?

**Hulnia** (2): miguel did great but god i fucking hate j cole

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): Yeah of course this won the bonus rate, it’s the only song here with a pop girl involved. But it’s also a legitimately great song with the one caveat that you have to ignore the title

---

**1998tweety** (10): QUEEN

**akanewasright** (10): we’re basically never rating this album so lemme take this space to say that this is one of the best latter day mariah songs. Genuinely such a joy of a song

**babadork** (10): If it was an option, I might have given this my 11. Mariah and Miguel sound perfect together.

**flava** (10): I mean duh

**runaway3212** (10): biggest slay since fantasy teabh

**starla\_** (10): hashtag beautiful

**TheQueenofCultures** (10): "I like when you run red lights" Mariah endorsing unsafe driving smh

**throwaway-7650** (10): she's so #quirky for the #hashtag

**welcome2thejam** (10): Lmao good luck to the rest of the bonus songs but I know where my ratbucks are going

**slimboyfriend** (9): this song deserved so much better from you people!! And by you people I mean the hets!

**TiltControls** (9): I should take away points for the #... but it's too good for that

**vapourlomo** (9): Knowing popheads, this will win in a landslide. And I wouldn't be mad! It's a great pop song! Mariah knows what she's doing!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): does Mariah know this title just looks like a “how do you do fellow kids” moment?

**celladonn** (8): i remember when this came out and i thought the hashtag in the title was sooo annoying... but you know what? bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): you know its gonna win the bonus rate bc its the only song with a woman on it

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Watch this somehow win the rate because a main pop girl is on it.

**cremeebrulee** (7): stop i just realized this is the only track in the rate with a woman on it... raters inflation incoming

**MiguelWifetoc** (6): "Miguel is the homie!!! Really cool dude" - Mariah Carey on her collab with Miguel, as well as the weeknd on a potential collab with Miguel circa a 2013 AMA.

**freeofblasphemy** (5.5): Hard to really feel the romantic bliss this is trying to convey when everything is so brickwalled

**noavocadoshere** (5): this feels like it was made for a commercial.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): you guys will not convince me this is a good song.

**just\_thonking** (10): Yeah this song is perfect and deserves all the praise it gets.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): The biggest hit of trilogy era at the time, this is SUCH a deserved classic that I still hear today & which has been referenced in songs by everyone from French Montana to Lorde. Extremely extremely deserving of the deep run into day 3 it made here

---

**TragicKingdom1** (11): why didnt he do all 5 minutes of this in his 13 minute super bowl set

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The way I was obsessed with this song. And it may just be the reason why I find female silhouettes attractive, but luckily this comment will be buried in a sea of other comments so no one will ever know

**amr** (10): first song by him I ever heard so it's hard. but for now I'll go with "I'm one some shit that U can't smell baby so, put down Ur perfume" like the way it descends is nuts

**celladonn** (10): the atmosphere and production are otherworldly

**cremeebrulee** (10): very cruel that I can’t give this an 11 this as well :( iconic ass opening line, one of the catchiest choruses in the rate, and the guitars at the end… a perfectly crafted showstopper

**CrimsonROSET** (10): well yeah this is good

**flava** (10): a top tier The Weeknd slapper

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I LEFT MY GIRL BACK HOME, I DON’T LOVE HER NO MORE

**MiguelWifetoc** (10): morning had a twisted uptempo swagger. this have colossal bummer energy. real mechanic piston, barely chugging drums. growling downtrodden gtr. "that bring the drugs bb i can bring my pain." dude's just doing another round of parties. THIS IS PACING!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): ultimate male manipulator music \[2\]

**sage** (10): THIS CLASSIC

**sarcasticsobs** (10): First Weeknd song I ever heard, wild stuff to think about now

**seanderlust** (10): when we talk about the weeknds music being this strange combination of sexuality and insecurity, these lyrics are maybe the best example in his discog of it.

**shipperondeck** (10): LET ME SEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEE THAT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSS

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the chorus…period

**throwaway-7650** (10): do ricki's rate with demi/poot lovato - tell me you love me

**vapourlomo** (10): the first Weeknd pop hit! so cute (kind of)

**welcome2thejam** (10): A masterpiece in atmosphere

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): it makes sense that this was the most successful song on the charts from the project. It has such a catchy Chorus. The kind of rock vibe is fun as well.

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): He makes a convincing proposition

**starla\_** (9.5): this was the first Weeknd song I heard and I was transported

**1998tweety** (9): BOP

**akanewasright** (9): I’d have more plays of this, but every time I listen, I have to sing along to “LET ME SEE THAT AAAASSSS” and there are some situations where that’s undesirable

**Awkward\_King** (9): nice

**freeofblasphemy** (9): It doesn’t get much more crushing and seductive than this chorus huh? Also have to shout out the beautiful piano in the right channel

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): I keep thinking this is the song where the Weeknd sampled Portishead but it’s not. Kinda want Beth Gibbons on this but don’t want to hear her go “let me see that ass”.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Thank god, I was about to fall asleep at this point.

**TiltControls** (8.5): It's an amazing song, but this is just making me think that Abel could kill a Chris Isaak cover

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): welcome to my wicked games

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): A pretty damn good debut single.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I’m glad this isn’t seen as the best song on the album anymore.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): Ramin Djawadi version is the 10

**runaway3212** (7): Chris Isaac outsold

**noavocadoshere** (6): the blueprint for so many of abel's later songs. iconic, especially the "let me mf-ing love you" line. personally not for me.

**bogo** (5): abel's voice gets on my nerves here and the song as a whole is really slow moving

**just\_thonking** (10): P\*tchfork once said this song sounded like it was recorded in a racquetball court, and I always think about that when I hear this song. They meant it as a compliment and so do I. Also fun fact \[there is a version of this song with Jessie Ware\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nshXwIRYjfI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nshXwIRYjfI))

**jackisboredtoday** (9.1): the classic that ensured this album’s place in the rate, we bid adieu to Miguel here after an impressive run including him taking half of the top 6. This song doesn’t even feel like it’s entirely a song in the way most hits of this era did, it feels so much like it’s just a gorgeous mood piece to me, the vibe being so well-set and it almost feels like Miguel is just spontaneously riding that vibe if it weren’t so catchy that it clearly had to take real time to make.

---

**1998tweety** (11): soty

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): I just love a two-stepping kinda bop anthem

**fadedblue09** (11): Cannot believe this is a 2012 song, sounds really different from everything in that era

**Roxieloxie** (11): so true!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “Baby these fists will always protect ya, lady” that “lady” made this one lyric go from gangster to 50s mob boss

**akanewasright** (10): This is like one of very few songs that would deserve to beat The Weeknd’s big hitters… if this isn’t Miguel’s top track, y’all are fucking insane

**amr** (10): this song is probably the most perfect mix of classic r&b/soul sounds with...Uno...alternative sounds. so lovely

**celladonn** (10): classic for a reason

**CrimsonROSET** (10): it’s the smasha

**emayzee** (10): so many 2012 songs have aged like milk but this one just keeps getting better with time

**freeofblasphemy** (10): What’s so good about this song is that you just know Miguel could’ve made it into an R&B “throwback” song, singing sweetly over a tasteful string arrangement. And he maintains that essence while also fucking it up just enough to keep things interesting. This is so nakedly synthesized and it’s so beautiful in its confidence

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Very nearly got my 11

**imfine\_jpg** (10): I apologize for all the 10s I'm going to give this album because I just realized how much I love Miguel <3

**MiguelWifetoc** (10): "Cindy Tsai whose head allegedly cushioned the singer's fall is suing Miguel"

**rc5568** (10): classic song maybe his best

**sarcasticsobs** (10): The bass is Doing Something to my brain, good lord. Love his little "wah's!". Almost the 11

**starla\_** (10): this is Miguel's biggest solo song and for a reason. It's a gorgeous ballad

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): the vocal sample thingy that repeats is so addicting

**vapourlomo** (10): obviously a mega-classic

**welcome2thejam** (10): Before we continue this rate, anybody wanna let my love adorn you

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): this is so fun and smooth this feels like cherries

**noavocadoshere** (9.5): OHKAY MIGUEL. HOLD ON NOW. adorn is also a strong opener. miguel put his whole heart and soul into adorn.

**seanderlust** (9.5): a timeless feeling R&B bop!!

**TiltControls** (9.5): all three of the artists in the rate killed it with their openings

**cremeebrulee** (9): listen it’s a good song but if it wins i will Die a little bit lol

**flava** (9): the biggest hit in the rate I think. Not my favourite Miguel song ever, even if I do the little stuttering back up vocals and the wholesome love Miguel just surrounds with the song.

**slimboyfriend** (9): do u remember when Kelly Clarkson won a Grammy and said “idk who Miguel is but we need to sing together because he has the sexiest voice I’ve ever heard”

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): \[sung to the tune of Snail Mail - Valentine\] iiiiii adorn you… iiiiii adorn you

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): The vibes are immaculate…but vibes don’t always get you all the way there.

**runaway3212** (8): sure why not

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): this is nowhere near the best on the album so if it's his highest...

just\_thonking: One of my favorite albums of all time. The atmosphere is immaculate, and while I think it is a bit frontloaded, it is truly a soothing, kaleidoscopic experience the whole way through.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.045): Stunning album tbh

**AHSWeeknd** (8.818): The voice is amazing (Miguel’s voice, not that show).

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.773): i had such a big miguel phase in 2015, i need to return to that because his music slays so much…

**nt96** (8.755): soulful and SEXY. Miguel understood the assignment and then some!

**flava** (8.727): the only album I’m familiar with going into the rate and one of my favourite R&B albums ever. Relentlessly sensual with a psychedelic flair. The album fucks. Miguel if you see this, hit me up on my reddit profile u/Flavasavavandal I’d be free anytime for you

**welcome2thejam** (8.545): Love the instrumentals. Miguel's got such a killer voice, this album's heavy sensuality can be a tightrope to walk and his delivery & charisma keep him balanced for the most part

**plastichaxan** (8.427): This album brought out such a horny side of me I had to stop myself from making some comments here like… Miguel we need to talk

**throwaway-7650** (8.409): congrats to miguel for joining zara larsson in getting both my 11 and 0! with that out of the way, wow this is a great album. the album ranked by streams (spotify) is tragic, hopefully this rate fixes that!

**sarcasticsobs** (8.409): Some… questionable lyrical choices but the instrumentals and vocal prowess overtake my hesitations for the majority of the cases

**starla\_** (8.273): Average 8.3. This album has high highs and low lows. It's not my favourite Miguel album for that reason but it has some of his best songs.

**bogo** (8.136): this one's gonna be underrated i fear and it's a shame cause it's lovely and really fun

**shipperondeck** (8.009): way more guitar than i expected

**sufjancaesar** (8.000): Really classic album. Miguel’s voice is something special fr! The album slightly derails for me in the 2nd half but the highlights are spectacular.

**slimboyfriend** (7.955): he’s hot

**vapourlomo** (7.909): Supremely underrated album

**fadedblue09** (7.818): I liked this project the most, and it makes senses cause it's the only "real" album. Therefore it feels the most "complete" and polished, and doesn't sound as insular and self-indulgent. Still, there are parts I couldn't vibe with and if I'm being honest, I realized this particular era of R&B may not be for me, but Miguel has been on my to-listen list for a while now, and I'm glad this rate made me do so.

**freeofblasphemy** (7.773): The perfect weird midsection between House of Balloon’s debauchery and Nostalgia, Ultra.’s romanticism. Miguel is like a normal R&B dude who fell into early 2010s R&B world and did his best to find compatibility

**MiguelWifetoc** (7.755): i was under the impression Miguel was a wife guy but he has had some considerable flopping in that regard, including a VERY sudden separation during the ballot submission period of this rate. I have had trouble rating this album, considering mr. art gallery chic and all his silly little shenanigans. However, the more time I spend with the album, the more I also realize Miguel's only issue is having to be pitted against two sorta decade defining albums, whereas he just made a perfect "this is the ultimate wife guy rnb classic". it is basically a hot 7.8-8.4 with minimal flops. he just understands "rhythm and blues" for a modern audience.

**DirtyRat583** (7.309): if i had to guess which of these albums would get my 11 i would NOT have said this one - but also it got the 0 so idk god works in mysterious ways ig

**cremeebrulee** (7.209): a great album, but unfortunately it's against two really fantastic ones for me. i will say i'm grateful that miguel is here to break up some of the heartache and misery with just unabashed, horny bops and i do see this growing on me over time.

**oscarbrierley1** (6.773): his vocals are amazing, but its let down by meh production.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): The noble dark horse run of Frank’s first charting single ends here. I do wanna share that it was winning for a huge chunk of the rate, and honestly it would’ve been an iconic and not-undeserving upset if it had pulled off the shocker. This is Frank at his very catchiest and pop-friendly without sacrificing the storytelling

**just\_thonking** (10): This was back and forth with HoB for a long time but Abel took the W. I would have slightly preferred this one to win tbh cause it's just THAT good.

---

**bigbigbee** (11): I’ve never felt my US East Coast-ness more keenly than when I listen to this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): What is a dentist’s favorite time of the day? 5:00 PM because that’s when she gets off work.

**CrimsonROSET** (11): literally ended america’s fear of dentists

**plastichaxan** (11): God this song fucks so much and that’s saying a lot in this rate but wow !!

**runaway3212** (11): when the song just slays I 11 it because I have taste

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): I love the "I still can't feel my face" line

**welcome2thejam** (11): 2010s me thought this was the hottest beat around lol. Still choppy & grimy as hell in the best possible way. His voice during the whole "chemist on campus" section activates the pleasure center in my brain. Also, my brother and I still quote "cocaine for breakfast: yikes" to each other all the time

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Beyond iconic. Deserves a Top 3 place in the rate

**akanewasright** (10): Honestly you gotta love the theatricality of this one… like you can feel him mugging at the camera

**Awkward\_King** (10): god this is such a highlight in his discography

**cremeebrulee** (10): i love love love how distinctive and immersive frank's songwriting is. this track being one of the best examples of it— just a great balance of genuine storytelling and haunting catchiness. it's crazy to think this was his debut single, it's one of his best still.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I think a reason why this works is it’s like a flip of the nihilism of House of Balloons. This is also very dour lyrically but there’s a weird innocence to this song

**MiguelWifetoc** (10): A saintly 11 was considered being dispatched to the Coachella 2k10 snapshot. I just think it's a great beat and a heartbreakingly honest lyric. you come out the gate with this you'll have attention. but forreal, I can't go back to the first time I heard this and if I could I'd have so much to fix that would still collapse on me. i dunno, i think frank tapped into something insane here. this was it.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): what an absolute timeless SMASHA

**noavocadoshere** (10): SUPER HUMAN EVEN WHEN I'M RATING ALT-R&B RATES. perfection. chef's kiss. this really was a visionary track.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): “YIKES”

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I can’t tell if this song is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek or heartfelt but I think the balance of both is what makes it so great

**sarcasticsobs** (10): That "womp" that comes in at 1:12 did something to me

**shipperondeck** (10): the single cover being a roxy music homage really makes it for me

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): not my favorite from him but still really good

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): I can't feel my face when I'm with you

**babadork** (8.5): Always liked the Viagra/autotune lines, but this has always been one of my least favorite songs on the album.

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): I’m a little colder on this and Channel Orange compared to Blonde but this is one of those songs that feels like a true game-changer. Dude can make seemingly the most unimaginable chorus sound good, as well as write verses that are even catchier

**starla\_** (8.5): she wanna be a dentist really bad

**thedoctordances1940** (8.1): yeah this is the big song and it is very distinctively frank ocean but I just feel like he has a lot of songs later on that are quite similar but better

**1998tweety** (7.5): breathe in breathe out pain

**ImADudeDuh** (7): least evil dentist in media

**sage** (6.7): the way i dont think i ever heard this til now .. its boring tho (edit: after a relisten i raised this it got a little better)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): love the chorus, dont really feel anything for the verses

**amr** (2.5): annoying delivery just super corny I know he was wearing them big ass white plastic glasses U can't see shit out of when he was recording this. lemme not even get into how awful the chorus is cos girl...that being said I do enjoy the production flourishes and it's fun how U can hear it all over r&b songs we got in the last decade

jackisboredtoday: # Nostalgia, ultra

**Overall Average**: 8.028 **// Average Controversy:** 1.838

just\_thonking: I could do without the samples that are basically remakes, but overall this is a great project. Channel Orange is one of my favorite albums ever and you can really see/hear the seeds of it here.

* \#2: Novacane | 9.337 | 653.6

* \#29: Dust | 7.270 | 508.9

**nt96** (9.350): wow, just wow. I haven't really heard much of this before but i can see why it's so critically lauded. Crazy to think this all got shut out of streaming cuz of the Eagles but then again that's not surprising. Calling Frank Ocean a talentless hack cuz he sung over the one and only track everyone knows???? Mr Henley you wish you could've made something as good as Blonde.

**AHSWeeknd** (9.200): I’m not the biggest fan of his, but he is a killer artist.

**sufjancaesar** (9.150): Man what an charming and incredible debut album. Almost every track has some emotional impact on me. It sounds dated at parts but, true to name, it’s damn nostalgic!

**shipperondeck** (8.840): why arent we rating street fighter smh would've been my 11

**plastichaxan** (8.710): Kinda criminal that this great album isn’t on streaming. Frank has never missed, but we have missed him where the fuck is the new music Frank

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.600): all of frank’s music means a lot to me and this album is no exception

**throwaway-7650** (8.590): it's super cool how brandy and tyler, the creator are on this mixtape. it needs to be cleared for streaming already fawk the eagles!

**sarcasticsobs** (8.510): Look, I just really like his vocal timbre and that helps me overcome shortcomings

**emayzee** (8.490): i won't know peace until this album is available on spotify

**starla\_** (8.450): Average 8.5. I love Frank's regularly released stuff but this was my first time listening to this project. I really enjoyed it! It's not as polished as Channel Orange but I like the roughness.

**cremeebrulee** (8.350): i don't listen to N,U often just because of its non-availability on streaming, but sitting down to rate this made me realize i do like it quite a bit. i think as a project this is his tightest— there's nothing here that i outright dislike. but i do think he's outdone himself on individual songs later on. i'm REALLY really interested in what people will think of some of these album cuts since there hasn't been much discussion as some of the abel and miguel tracks, so it'll be a fun read-through when the results are out (even if they hurt my feelings a bit).

**akanewasright** (8.200): the way this is Frank’s worst project, where his lyrics are often too blunt and a bit dopey… and it’s still this damn good

**DirtyRat583** (8.110): i downloaded the album off dbree and Nature Feels had me checking the link in the post bc i didnt believe it was real 💀

**MiguelWifetoc** (8.000): "I’m definitely influenced by Rhythm and Blues, as much as I’m influenced by other shit that I listen to. I think that it’s like a lot of music that’s progressive in new ways, it’s a fusion of at least a couple genres. I’m not saying that this is my manifesto or anything, but it’s definitely not a straight up R&B record." Frank said that in a 2011 interview to Jeff Weiss that would eventually find its way to Weiss' long-running blog, PassionoftheWeiss when Weiss realized he couldn't publish it in the LA Times. Nostalgia, Ultra is a CRUCIAL snapshot of many things: a guy who was part of the most important collective of '08-'12, Los Angeles hipster/indie culture, and diverse "anything goes" sounds of mp3 blogs. What remains 11 years later, is a colossal sense that Frank Ocean is above all, a fascinating curator that sometimes coalesces into a one-man genre. Love or hate the man, his vision and idea of music, one intrinsically tied to how one finds their sense of self, has always felt rawly empathetic; he made the 2010s better for a lot of people. He trolls old memories and technologies, recontextualized coldplay n' radiohead n' MGMT (WILD and ballsy moves that paid off bc he committed himself completely), and sweetly sings of getting the most heartbreaking booty of his life/pondering religion/nostalgia. Nostaliga, ultra sounded like one guy telling you what his soul looked like. it wasn't always pretty, but you had to realize that the way he was curating this was going to create colossal brainworms and set a bar for how you lay shit out in the future.

**welcome2thejam** (7.900): True to the theme, my nostalgia goggles came off big for some tracks, but others remain some of my absolute favorite Frank songs and bring me way way back

**bogo** (7.700): this is a really solid set of songs and is a really good starting point for frank, but 1) i wish he was much more creative with the samples on this album instead of literally just singing the same melody over the same production as the original but with different lyrics and 2) frank would go on to make much better albums that this project pales in comparison to. still, it's quite good for what it is.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.100): The most inconsistent project here. Frank made a huge leap forward by Channel Orange.

**freeofblasphemy** (6.950): I was admittedly more into the more raucous/outwardly aggressive side of Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All and apparently didn’t first listen to this until 2013, when it made as much of an impression on me as Channel Orange did, which is to say, not much of one, even though the artistic progression is apparent. But then Blonde dropped and flip my brain upside-down, and I’ve since gone back to these first two releases and realized that they are deeply flawed but admirable in their flaws and ambition. This is the album (sorry, mixtape) equivalent of having your teacher write “showing improvement!” on your fifth grade report card. You can feel the bones of Blonde’s bittersweet recollections, obfuscated by superfluous layers and some lackluster performancaes, but also enhanced by playful production, distinct concepts, and just utter sincerity. I’ve never listened to a Frank Ocean song that made me think “Wow, he clearly didn’t give a shit about this”, and I don’t think I ever will.

**slimboyfriend** (6.550): I remember liking this album a lot more in high school when it came out :/

**oscarbrierley1** (6.350): it's a bit hit and miss for me. I feel like channel orange would've been a fairer fight with the others.

**fadedblue09** (6.150): Frank Ocean is like the Lana Del Rey of R&B to me: both are very mystique-coated "cult following" artists whose appeal will forever remain a mystery to me, and sadly this mixtape won't change that fact. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by some songs and the personal songwriting, and I can say this mixtape provides a cohesive album-level experience.

**jackisboredtoday** (11): I know we all were saying this was gonna win from the very start, but I want it to be known this was far less certain a result than you all thought, it went back and forth with Novacane all through the process and was as low as #8 at one point despite the mountain of 11s. But this is SUCH an undeniably deserving winner, a song suite that spans genres, serves as the centerpiece of the album, and went from a low-profile mixtape release all the way to the super bowl, and now most importantly, a popheads rate win!

**just\_thonking** (9.5): Not my favorite song in the rate (or the mixtape), but definitely a deserving winner. The first half is incredible, Abel at his best, and the second half is also quite good. For the first few ballots this had an average over 10, but it was a little too controversial to maintain that sky high score. That being said, the fact that it held onto first place even with a zero is quite impressive!

---

**AHSWeeknd** (11): FUCK ME THE FUCK UP KING

**akanewasright** (11): genuinely this is just one of the coolest uses of a sample I’ve ever heard… like he fully turned Siousxie & The Banshees into party music

**bogo** (11): even if i'm not crazy about this album i still agree that this song bangs. any song that samples siouxsie and the banshees is a guaranteed banger

**celladonn** (11): Insane how good this is. The way it transitions into the second part, I screamed

**cremeebrulee** (11): i don't even watch stranger things but this song would save me from vecna fr. sometimes i do feel a bit basic calling this my favorite weeknd track, but it really is his best. the \[STALE TOPIC\] beat switch is so perfectly fitting, it sounds exactly like abel giving up on trying to convince himself that he's content with this lifestyle, leading to an excellently delivered second half (the little effect on "nightmare: elm street" btw... chef's kiss) i really do love this song through and through, i've been waiting for a chance to 11 it (and hopefully get another chance too down the line!)

**freeofblasphemy** (11): “On another level” is right. My friend was playing the original Siouxsie song in the car the other night and the sampling here is just A+ but this doesn’t just ride on that pedigree at all. Also, why didn’t he do the second half at the Super Bowl

**frogaranaman** (11): the way this song rewired an entire generation's brain

**ignitethephoenix** (11): arguably his magnum opus, there are no flaws in this song.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): I mean, come on.

**nt96** (11): that SWITCHUP from deranged to demented. Gurl IVE FALLEN AND I CANT GET UP

**rosapalms** (11): things were simply different after that pitch-shift on "we can turn this to a n!6h7m@r3 - elm street"

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): You think I’m NOT gonna take the chance to 11 Siouxsie by proxy this spooky goffik season!? The sample is used so well and this song earns every second of its length

**sarcasticsobs** (11): Yeah, easy pick. Nothing to say that hasn't already been said. All-timer sampling usage with Siouxsie and the Banshees

**slimboyfriend** (11): He even used a British accent for the interpolation….. the attention to detail

**thedoctordances1940** (11): cannot begin to describe how incredible this song is so just imagine a wane essay here

**vapourlomo** (11): Still, somehow, the best Weeknd song. Distorted, haunted, obscene and an absolute goddamn banger. I'm side-eyeing anyone who gives this less than a 9.

**amr** (10): in the first chorus when he sings "if it hurts to breathe open a window" like all the oxygen is being sucked (raised eyebrow emoje) out of him as it goes on...

**CrimsonROSET** (10): does he mean the house from up because i feel like i just went on a journey lost my wife and aged 50 years

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I gave black midi - Cavalcade like a 9.8 average demonstrating my love of “fucked up carnival music”, so glad the Weeknd came through to satisfy my target audience

**MiguelWifetoc** (10): sioxsuie and the banshees were goddamn timely and lucky. she was legit the last punk to really keep things going and while the band was rudimentary at best (up until about the first two peelie seshes imo), the banshees kept getting BETTER. her vibe kept getting more immaculate (tbf, she was basically an aloof character that allowed her to evade british music press sexism at the cost of being treated as a curiosity). and by at least 1980, with a lineup that enjoyed reggae and sorta had their shit together, they had a coherent vision that was gonna carry them through the decade with a run of all timer post-punk -> goth releases. Here at the center of Weeknd's House of Balloons, he makes a brilliant call to SNATCH 1980 albium opener/stunner Happy House. The white (gothic) reggae (not too far off from rnb) melts perfectly his own kaleidoscopic hellfire realm. the 2 parter at the middle of the album is tear-jerking sublime; it takes a LOT of prowess to recontextualize the already bleak "lunies have taken over the asylum" mantra of happy house and sell it as sleazy merry-go-round that could be coming from down the coked out bathroom. and then that second part? dude what the FUCK. that's maverick class "im not afraid of you and I will beat your ass" level coke delivery coming out of an iMac laptop (shit sounds bold, brazen, and brashly cheap) with a PERFECT hissy n' droned out laptop percussive; im rolling in the bugatti. sublime display of cocky anti-swagger. that back half is damn painful and beyond scary; nihilism in a black velvet am appy onesie.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Gotta think people who've been Weeknd fans since HoB went off when dude brought this out at the Super Bowl

**noavocadoshere** (9.5): chaotic all through the entire run and I LOVE IT. a funhouse track.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): that fun fun fun hook is a little too close to Rebecca Black for comfort

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): fine creme this song just keeps growing on me. title track is awesome, glass table girls not for me

**starla\_** (8.5): I love the OHHHH from 'Happy House', such a clever sample

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I’m not as over the moon with this as most people…but I can see why it’s the faraway front runner.

**TheQueenofCultures** (8): We're happy here

**plastichaxan** (7.9): Glass Table Girls outsold it would be a 10 on its own

**TiltControls** (7.5): Took a little to grow on me, and while it still falls in 'like' rather than 'love' right now I would not be surprised to see this score bump up if it makes it to winners/all stars

**babadork** (7.2): I like House of Balloons a lot.

**1998tweety** (7): the first half of this is immaculate but then it went downhill a bit

**flava** (6.5): House of Balloons is a 9 with how dead inside Abel sings the chorus, but yeah the careless sloppiness (that’s probably intentional but still just sucks all enjoyment out of the song) of glass table girls brings the whole song down

**apatel27** (6): The second half is so bad. So on the nose for sex & drugs

**sufjancaesar** (6): This could grow on me but on first listen I found the 2nd half way more enjoyable

**Islands** (5): He kinda sounds like shit especially in the second half great prod though

**fadedblue09** (4): Neither half particularly interested me

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): although HoB isn't exactly fun for me, I'd still probably give it a good score. But GTG is horrible, wish they were separate tbh

**AHSWeeknd** (10.100): Possibly a magnum opus. He showed the R&B boys how it’s done then moved onto pop.

**MiguelWifetoc** (10.000): House of Balloons has sat as an increasingly humongous blind spot (I'd really like the Urban Outfitters tape edition but its price is now $80 and a collector fetish item) for a couple of years now. I came to this album with knowledge of the Weeknd's imperial top 40 flop era and sudden redux as "the man in a red/black suit" who has emerged in the 2020s as the only guy who wants to be/and moonlights well as a POP STAR. Listening to this album, I am incredulous and aghast at how viciously *honest* Abel is about wanting to be a pop star here and what he tapped into. Two ideas play out as I think of this album and why it works so well. 1) In 2k10 Kanye West did what no indie band really could do in the wake of the new millennium: found a novel way to sonically encapsulate the failure of the American Dream. MBDTF heavily foreshadowed that pop music of the 2010s was going to have a fascination with pleasure; one such that was consistently more morose and dejected to the point of OD'ing on us repeatedly and often. Themselves the hallmarks of being brutally marred within the fatalism of capitalist realism. 2) The 2k9 indie Chillwave summer, sonically reactive yet technological momentous (bedroom production paying off), vibed so hard and in the process sorta tip toed around that reality; that era of music was itself a product of blog-insanity and unchecked tastemaking--a time of greener pastures as much as also bountiful dipshittery. The bedroom-produced and circulated Chillwave, along with its "vibe" cast a long crooked shadow over 2k10s indie and pop as well...the scenes own pleasure derived from unremembered, asynchronous nostalgia. In 2k11, a handful of albums (drake's take care and James Blake's 2k10 hold over s/t) pointed rather clearly towards what what capitalist realism's inability to imagine futures, this power mp3 blogs welded, and unremembered nostalgia might amount to. But it was the Weeknd's House of Balloons that quite frankly, took the entire MOMENT and created a whole new way to encapsulate of what has hung over the 2010s and 20s writ large: **our unconditional, societal case of depressive hedonism**. Abel was a ruthless magpie, gouging on (well, it was posted to/featured on drake's blog) indie blog architecture: am appy aesthetics (he did work for the company amongst employees who didn't realize they were hearing his music) & chillwave's unremembered nostalgia--turning it all into a giant coke-fueled nightmare of sublime, transcendent sleazey rnb. This is not to be confused with How to Dress Well's PBRNB classic Love Remains, a very white, very scholarly reading of RnB through lost memories and sonic ghosts that profited from blogs and primed those readers for a real deal like House of Balloons. House and Balloons' sound reminds me of one personally loathed, yet earnestly important release (you can guess). Both albums sound fantastic and deal with sleaze, but Banksy's never came off as having gone this CRAY. Every word abel says on here is both a lived-in noir autofiction (told as a possibly cohesive story!?!) about the worst goddamn nights/months/cycles of one's life. And the Weeknd sorta seems to have it as the kind that you go out and re-do and re-live because there is nothing to live for except to burn it all and rail a line of coke. House of Balloons is all about living in the sleaze and is the rare album to encapsulate the thin, blurred dynamics "who's sleazing on who" at the self-imploding, deliriously haunting degrees it RISES to. Abel's voice n' lyrics and aping of white kid indie blogs were only two parts of this trifecta: the brilliant crack roster of samples that recontextualized and warped sonic pathways into blown out coke table brawls, fast and furious drift king escapades, and "too horny to talk about on popheads" excursions; new rnb. That this album legit acts as an argument to prove "dream pop is a fancy way to describe adult contemporary" is only like its 8th best achievement. So cunning and rare it is that we receive an album of this caliber that acts as an apt prognosis of the era. I know that just like me, Abel too, has hidden himself in blogs and tumblrs and media sites where one could construct "The Self-Image of Their Desire", and House of Balloons reflects that singular expressiveness. In only five listens the album tasted of the darkest stout I have ever hung myself over; i feel ecstatic and transcendent. If only for a little moment.

**cremeebrulee** (9.740): i really do love all of the weeknd's full length projects, so i won't say that he peaked with his debut, but the truth is that he won't ever make another project like this (and that's ok because i'm just glad it exists already!) there's just a perfect balance of hedonistic lyrics that describe things i will ever experience but mixed with the very real feelings of solitude and cynicism i am way too familiar with. it makes for an experience that serves as both an escape and a comfort; i don't imagine i will ever tire of it, so i'm very grateful i got a chance to give it my highest album average in a rate ever

**vapourlomo** (9.500): A straight-up masterpiece. The blueprint for 2010s R&B. Drake wishes.

**akanewasright** (9.450): this is honestly the best debut project I’ve ever heard, album, EP, mixtape, or otherwise. The Weeknd emerged fully formed - sleazy, hazy, and completely singular.

**nt96** (9.350): the little mixtape that could and DID. This album changed everything and music a lot more moodier. Haven't been this depressingly turned on since The Velvet Rope.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.080): The first half to two-thirds is near-untouchable, but I'm not over the wall about the final 4 tracks like I am about them

**shipperondeck** (8.900): this music got me through the most depressing era of my life so as a result it was kinda "tainted" for me now yknow what i mean BUT this rate kinda helped fix that so thanks

**starla\_** (8.900): Average 8.9. I absolutely love this mixtape, it's what got me into the Weeknd years ago and it still holds up today.

jackisboredtoday: **throwaway-7650** (8.800): still need to stream the rest of trilogy but my god HOB is great. a few weaker tracks but there are more 10s than non-10s, and 28 was an amazing discovery. already know HoB/GTG is going to win (which I am not doing anything to prevent) so high for this better make day 3 or else!

**welcome2thejam** (8.800): My brother kept telling me this was undoubtedly the best era of the Weeknd, not looking forward to acknowledging to him that he had massive points

**oscarbrierley1** (8.550): full of great choruses and interesting samples. It feels in a league of it's own in this rate for me.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.300): the weeknd is one of my favorite modern pop artists, and this album is no exception to his greatness. it’s really hard to overstate just how UNIQUE this album was and still is, there’s nothing that sounds like this out there. while i enjoy his pop work more, i can’t deny that house of balloons still remains his most ambitious and influential album, and it will almost certainly go down in history as one of the most essential albums of the 21st century.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.030): Abel when he’s on, he’s on. His best work here shows incredible melodies and merging of his influences.

**slimboyfriend** (8.000): The Weekend’s output post-Can’t Feel My face’s chart ascent is incredibly overrated, but this album is legitimately good.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.850): the atmosphere he managed to create on this album is so impressive, i genuinely don’t think i’ve heard an album that fits the “atmospheric” tag as well as this one does

**freeofblasphemy** (7.750): Didn’t listen to this when it first dropped, which is all well and good because I don’t think I needed an album about getting high and getting laid in my life when I had yet to experience either. The first five tracks are a perfect EP. The final four (here, five, I guess) kinda feel like Abel’s trying too hard to convey the idea of a comedown/morning after. That’s like the point of this album (sorry, mixtape) that these nights of debauchery are just about the numbing inner pain. But it’s so good at doing its thing, and so much credit goes to Abel for just being a fantastic pop star. It makes absolute sense that this guy got huge.

**plastichaxan** (7.620): There are amazing elements to this that sometimes feel like they’re used for a bit of the song and not fully so yeah that kinda brought my average a bit down from a great to a really good lol

**sufjancaesar** (7.550): For me, the production here was too discordant at times. And I’m not a fan of Abel’s singing voice: it’s either too nasally or too much falsetto. The drowsy mood hit harder in the last third but this didn’t fully click

**DirtyRat583** (6.820): damn this album is melancholy... good for him i guess?

**bogo** (6.500): one day i might get this album but for now it's not clicking much with me. idk maybe it's because i'm only 18 and have never done drugs

**flava** (5.950): yeah this was pretty boring overall with only one huge highlight in Wicked Games, The Weeknd is either being cringe, hedonistic or cringe and hedonistic and I don’t find either that interesting or compelling. I’ll still check out the rest of these mixtapes cause I’m kinda curious now so at least House of Balloons has that going for it.

**fadedblue09** (5.800): I'm really sad how much I did not like this project. This is very much a debut mixtape: a lot of the songs are formless, unpolished and meandering. Normally, Abel's vocals would save this, but it appears he hasn't found his groove yet at this point. Oh well, at least we're assured he'll make better stuff.
