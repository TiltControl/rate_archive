(Leix) This version throws everything that made the Live version great and earns one of my lowest scores in this rate just because of that.

(Luna) Song so nice, it's in this rate twice! Plain Gold Ring is a great song no matter what's done to it, but I do admit I prefer the live version by a smidge. It's more dynamic and interesting, IMO.

---

## Lost its charm

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): actually loses some of the charm the live version has but still v good cover

**kinglet22** (6.2): misses the energy of the live version

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (4): It's like the live version only worse

**m4ttycool** (7): I think I get it now, live version is better (?)

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): live version is much better. Some parts of this version sound way louder than they should, and other parts sound a little off, too.

**vayyiqra** (7): friendzoned again also why do we need two versions of this (leix's note: i thought some people would like this version more but guess not)

**whatareblackhole** (7): I think she did this more polished, studio version as a tribute to Ms. Nina, but I think the rawness of Kimbra's take is much more apparent in the live version.

## On his hand, was a plain gold studio version.

**awryj** (8): Marry people you're in love with, kids

**banananaise** (8): hmmm popheads is going to hate this song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw6KRkx0vNg

**fourchip** (5): these bonuses from kimbra are ridiculously bad i’m sorry

(Leix) This song is a real grower. I used to skip this in my listens of Vows, since it was between two perfect songs, but now I find myself going back into the album just because of it! The drums and the synths at the beginning of this song is just infectious and makes me want to rhyme along, I wish she made this a single back then because it deserves a great music video like the others.

(Luna) This is a good one! It's sweet, yet also a little eerie and "odd", in a very Kimbra way. It has the disadvantage of being between Settle Down and Cameo Lover, which both feel a lot "bigger", but I love the twinkling production and Kimbra's cooing nonetheless.

---

## You're my favorite pastime!

**BiPolarBear17** (10): Honestly this song takes me there. Probably my favourite off Vows, as it's just so magical and breathtaking. A chill bop to end all chill bops.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this was my favorite song of hers for a while. it's very sweet, and i still play it a LOT when i'm starting to catch feelings for someone (kinda like right now lmao! anyway). the bridge is also one of her best imo

**Mudkip1** (10): lovely

**RandomRocketKat** (10): Those drums and that melody make me queef

**whatareblackhole** (10): A really beautiful love song! I've always really enjoyed this one.

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): a wholesome queen who appreciate people for who they are instead of Rihanna and Ellie who just like how they move. also this is super lush

**twat\_brained** (9.2): Much better than "Settle Down" and I'm unsure why this was foregone as the lead single.

**vayyiqra** (9): so pretty

**Raykel** (8.5): Was that a key change? Sounded off, but it's a key change regardless so it sounded amaaazing.

**banananaise** (8): australian tour edition tracklist > international deluxe tracklist

**izeasklapaucius** (8): Vocals are on fuckin point.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5rLz5AZBIA

**awryj** (7.5): A cute retro track. Bonus +0.5 point for the second half of the track, this choir is like waves of refreshingly cold water in a scorching hot day, ugggh


## And then you're just passing by...

**CarlieScion** (6): This song is too long

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Why aren't can't the verses be as good as the chorus?

**kinglet22** (4): the bridge is nice

**InfernalSolstice** (3): i don't really like her voice in this at all

**SkyBlade79** (3): her voice sounds kind of mediocre on here and the bridge is bad

(Leix) The pastoral vibe here is just amazing. The first song Florence Welch ever wrote, Between Two Lungs is about the breath you share with your lover while you are kissing. (Ew?) You can feel the sheer happiness as Florence sings along. Also, the harps elevate this song into another level for me.

(Luna) Luna had comments for this rate, but she's too busy flopping RN!

---

## I pray to god this breath will last!

**CarlieScion** (11): Okay, so this song was my favorite song for so long - I love this song with my whole soul. This song makes me feel so light and airy and I always discover something new when I listen to it. Honestly one of the best indie-pop songs ever made - dont @ me.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this was my absolute favorite F+TM song for a good half decade before we were blessed with Delilah, but it's still way up there for me. the build up is amazing, and when Florence just like, explodes at the end it's beyond beautiful

**kappyko** (10): i'm just so happy to be discovering this album honestly

**skargardin** (10): Okay, this is incredible. The background vocals, the production slowly coming into focus, simply beautiful.

**specfagular** (10): Beautiful. Skinny. 10/10

**BiPolarBear17** (9.5): Unfortunately I get the feeling that this'll be an early cut, but it's such a wholesome warm track and it always manages to put a smile on my face.

**whatareblackhole** (9): This is a fun one!

**awryj** (8.8): queen of anatomy, your heart is a muscle is canceled

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Florence + The Green Bean

**vayyiqra** (8): pretty melody

**izeasklapaucius** (7): Didn't kicks as hard as the previous songs.

**m4ttycool** (7): we are all too young to die

## The Build-Up pt.2?

**twat\_brained** (6.2): Love the buildup but the song started out too slow for it to be saved, I'm afraid.

**RandomRocketKat** (5.5): omg shes talking about her heart I got it just now **(leix's note: no)**

**Mudkip1** (5): didn't really feel this one

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (3): This sounds like a buildup to an amazing chorus

(Leix) And our first single is out! This is not a surprise for me, since the structure of this song is a mess. There are really good parts, like the brass, but the transitions(like verse-> chorus) are really clunky. Video is not really good too imho.


---

## I just wanna have you up in my head!

**awryj** (10): a lobotomy anthem

**BiPolarBear17** (10): Mark Ronson realness!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): THE FUCKING BRAAAAAAASS!!!!!! THAT BRIIIIIIDGE!!!! THE VIDEOOOOOOO!!!!!!!

**kappyko** (10): she is bad af

**m4ttycool** (10): I can't explain but I really love this

**nikitasd** (10): This has been sewn into my head after hearing it dozens of times from booting up FIFA

**skargardin** (10): Finally an uptempo song, so so good.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): VERY different than the first part of this album, but it's a welcome change that sounds really unique, but also somewhat mainstream compared to the rest of the album.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZWmwHjFRPI

**izeasklapaucius** (9.5): Love the experimentation with the genre-mashing.

**SkyBlade79** (9): omg what an atmospheric bop, the synths are SO nice

**banananaise** (8.5): when i think of exotic and erotic i think of new zealand

**vayyiqra** (8): yet another funky bop

**deadspiderwall** (7.8): nice twinkle

**twat\_brained** (7.6): She's really trying to be Kylie here, and it shows in many ways.

## What is the missing ingredient this time?

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): It's alright but missing that special something that would push it into the stratosphere

**Raykel** (7): I get what's it's trying to be but misses it just a bit.

## Charli XCX - Out of My Head (ft. Tove Lo and Charli XCX)

**whatareblackhole** (7): I think this song is overproduced…sorry…!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6.7): what is this mess

**Mudkip1** (6): another snoozer but it's still fun

**InfernalSolstice** (5): get rid of her singing and this is a huge bop (leix's note: you may be right for once)

**sandwichsparrow** (5): something about this song is really grating to me but I can't put my finger on what it is.

**CarlieScion** (4): This song isn't bad but it's kinda boring

(Leix) TEN SILVER SPOONS COMING AFTER ME

Mowgli's Road is like a song directly from an animated movie, I love the quirky and whimsical vibe of it. It was the second single of The Family Jewels and its difference from the first single Obsessions is striking. In the lyrics Marina talks about the dilemma she faced; either go safe and have a more succesful carreer which is what her label wants, or go the forsaken route and do the music she wants to do and risk it all. The song makes you feel like she chose the "unforsaken route" but I think she balanced it well in the end, doing full on pop on her second album Electra Heart while still keeping her main shtick.

(Luna) Fun fact: this song first got buzz through its video, linked by, among others, Kanye West! Thanks Ye. This song is delightfully weird in a way that shouldn't work, but Marina pulls it off.

---

## I'LL ESCAPE IF I TRY HARD ENOUGH

**BiPolarBear17** (10): Still to this day my favourite Marina track. It manages to be both sinister and absolutely bonkers at the same time, and despite how off-kilter the song is it works perfectly. Not only is her delivery in the verses on fire, but the song has some of my favourite lyrics from her as well. Also when will your faves have an entire refrain of cuckoos?

**chipsi1** (10): Cuckoo(lander)

This song is so weird. Between Marina impersonating a chicken and making Mowgli references as a way to criticize society for making Marina follow it's rules, this is probably the weirdest song Marina has ever written.

But this song is like, fucking fantastic. With the really catchy groove the song has and Marina's unique way of stating that she's unsure where to move on with her life and that she feels society's pressure and the way it's telling her who to be, this song belongs in the top 7 songs from the album IMO

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I just love this so much. Cuckoo!

**Kaylaboe** (10): an unknown fun fact is that marina ghostwrote the jungle book and then directed the movie and produced this amazing song for the soundtrack

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): This song is batshit insane and it shouldn’t work. But it does, and so well.

**specfagular** (10): CUCKOO

**kappyko** (9.5): NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO

**awryj** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcehzlBd_uY

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): Nice solid rock song. Why didn't this do as well as a single, this has hit written all over it

**izeasklapaucius** (9): Love the melody on the chorus.

**m4ttycool** (9): Cuckoo!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): When will your indie pop faves release a not-so radio friendly track as their first ever single? (Leix's note: florence did!!!!!!)

**skargardin** (8.5): Queen of the jungle.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): A weird as hell bop

**fourchip** (7.5): i love cynthia lee fontaine

## TILL KING OF THE JUNGLE CAUGHT MY BLUFF

**vayyiqra** (7): catchy but wtf is it about

**Raykel** (6.5): This tried just a little too hard to be unique.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Type of Jewel: Bismuth

**twat\_brained** (5.7): Not feeling this one like some of the earlier tunes

**whatareblackhole** (5): Mehhh, not my favorite. It's just weirdly too theatrical?

(Leix) Depression usually leads to ruin, but in Marina's case it apparently isn't, it just makes her want to succeed more to get out of it which turns into a snowball effect and... Anyways, in this song she sings about the struggles she had while trying to be succesful; losing friends, strained relations with her family, getting into such a state that she can't feel any emotion anymore: aka feeling numb. I love how she turned this theme into a good song.

(Luna) Just missing the top 20 is Numb, TFJ's closer on some versions of the albums (Marina released like 37472810 versions of TFJ so it varies across 'em)! This has always been one of my top songs off the album-- it's so...*crystalline*, for lack of a better word, and is a really definitive moment in terms of the album's themes about Marina's search for fame.

---

## :emofish:

**awryj** (9): 2017 was really tough for me, I never really wrote about this here (because honestly, who cares), but it was probably the closest I was to not wanting to be alive. But now, after I had recovered, I noticed how huge of a difference there is between Feb 2017 me and Feb 2018 me. I feel more alive than ever, even though some things that triggered all of this cannot be changed. I'm more social, more invested, more active - I feel like I finally started to reflect all that I've absorbed. On the other hand, will this high high be followed by an even lower low? tldr who can relate (woo)

**twat\_brained** (8.9): I've gained so much respect for Marina now that I've heard her actually sing about her struggles with mental health, putting pen to paper and sharing it with the world. Go her!


## SHIIIIIIIIIIIINEEEEEEEE LOOKING FOR THE GOLDEN LIGHTTTT

**specfagular** (11): Originally I gave my 11 to The Family Jewels before it was put in the bonus rate instead, but I was seriously considering Numb, so once TFJ got moved to the bonus rate I just had to give it to Numb. This song is beautiful and it has always been my favorite off of the main album.

**chipsi1** (10): This song is actually my favorite album closer ever, and it honestly feels like a "to be continued", like Marina's battle with life and herself isn't over, but she's gonna deal with it.

One of my favorite things about this song is how Marina basically addresses being stuck in a situation in which no matter what goals she gets that she set up for herself, she cannot reach the light at the end of the tunnel, which is something I relate to.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): her 2nd best song ever! an incredible emotional showcase and artistic statement! grand in the grandest of ways!

**fourchip** (10): call me katy perry bc wig flew to arkansas

**m4ttycool** (10): SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE

**nikitasd** (10): Remember when people would use marina and the diamonds music for Homestuck fan videos? Just me.. OK..

**izeasklapaucius** (8): Vocals on point.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): her song “Buy the Stars” from Electra Heart is oddly similar with this one

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Type of Jewel: Sapphire

**vayyiqra** (8): relatable lyrics

**kappyko** (7): she sounds pretty

## Pretty okay!

**whatareblackhole** (7): I've never been a total fan of this one, but I still like it. I like Marina's recurring theme of perfection.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): It's okay. I don't hate it but its nothing special

(Leix) The infamous first single of the band, Kiss With A Fist is not like the rest of the album as it has more of a rock vibe. This is NOT about domestic abuse, it is about a strong love affair. I personally don't like this song much, but it is pretty short and harmless.

(Luna) Making the top 20 is one of F+ATM's most markedly "different" songs-- a big garage rock-style number about a destructively passionate relationship (with somewhat concerning-sounding lyrics). It's not necessarily one of my favourite songs off of Lungs, but I think it provides a welcome departure from the rest of the album's sound and is generally very rowdy and fun and catchy.

---

**deadspiderwall** (10): SLAP

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Reminds me of White Stripes. Top notch dark comedy lyrics.

**kappyko** (10): I really hope this gets far. This is a very much needed garage rock detour from a sound that was starting to get a little hard to distinguish, and I've loved this song for a long, long time. It's so fucking cool to imagine what this album would've sounded like if it was more like this; Fratellis-esque indie rock with attitude. Then again, would we have gotten the iconic band we have today?

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): !demand an extended version

**specfagular** (10): I'm sorry but I love this song everyone. Kween of domestic disputes. No tbh my mom and I were abused by my dad for years and lil gay me was listening to Florence in the car and she started jamming out to this song and we had a moment so that's always been a fond memory I've associated with this song /endsobstory

**BiPolarBear17** (9.5): If you try and tell me that you don't scream along to this bop at the top of your lungs with limbs flailing everywhere like you're absolutely shit-faced at a karaoke bar then you're lying to both me and yourself.

**Mudkip1** (9.5): badass

**skargardin** (9.5): Short, powerful, straight to the point.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Yikes, imagine hearing this song without some context from Florence, saying this song is not literally about domestic violence and it's more about how passionate a relationship is.

**Kaylaboe** (9): honestly if florence made a punk album i would be here for it

**m4ttycool** (9): Hit me pls

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Pretty different sound than the first four songs, but still very good.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Florence + The Dry Clean

**awryj** (8.8): Only Flo could make domestic violence seem wholesome and happy

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.8): invented rock music

**kinglet22** (8.8): i'd kiss this song and not with a fist

**CreepyMannequin** (8): I thought this was Lily Allen for the longest time

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): This is a better, angrier version of "The Pantaloon" by TOP

**DraculaWeekend** (8): Honestly I thought this was Kate Nash at first. This has a more rock vibe that is pretty different from the rest of the album but still works really well.

**fourchip** (8): queen of domestic abuse, chris brown is shaking

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): Florence was definitely still finding her sound here, so even though it doesn’t really feel like a F+TM song it’s so fucking fun to sing to.

**Raykel** (8): Oh I love this girl rocker vibe, she pulls it off really well.

**letsallpoo** (7): a bop but also a horrific choice for a debut single

**RandomRocketKat** (7): I hope all my relationships are this abusive

**vayyiqra** (5): her worst song, just awful lyrics

**whatareblackhole** (5): Meh, it's never been my favorite.

**SkyBlade79** (4): not a fan of these scenario type things

**twat\_brained** (4): I can't see past the lyrical dissonance on this one; this straight up sounds like a glorification of abusive relationships. I'm surprised Florence hasn't been called out more for this.

**CarlieScion** (3): This doesn't fit with the album at all wtf, like it's an okay song on its own but it breaks the immersion so badly

(Leix) With an infectious chorus, this song is definitely a bop and one of my favorites from Marina overall. Her vocals in this song are unique and amazing, and i love how she pronounces *celestial* differently when it suits her. 

(Luna) Marina allegedly dislikes this song, but honestly, I don't get why. It's good! A thing to note is that I LOVE basically any song where the subject matter is heavily drinking to forget your deep existential depression, so this was always gonna get in my good books.

---

## Let's drink the pain away

**chipsi1** (10): This is the best song made about drinking the pain away, like, ever.

Even though this is like very obviously about drinking alcohol to forget your troubles, I feel like there's another aspect here that parallels Paramaore's Fake Happy and is close to the message she delivered in Are You Satisfied; everything around Marina seems so glamorous and "celestial" when in reality she's an insecure teenager with anxiety problems that just spends her life trying to reach a position that she is happy in.

Also this is like a major bop so i guess this parallels Paramore's Fake Happy in that sense too

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): new wave goodness and so much fun to sing along to

**skargardin** (10): It still sounds [FRESH] af!

**fourchip** (9.5): a classy drinker

**letsallpoo** (9): never understood why marina allegedly hated this song

**izeasklapaucius** (8): Catchy.

**vayyiqra** (9): such a bop, so 80s

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Type of Jewel: Peridot

## yes

**whatareblackhole** (8): Do you think it's spelled "shampain" because it's like fake pain? Like pain that's a sham? Hmmm…I didn't think of it this way until now.

## Drank so much that I forgot what to put here

**twat\_brained** (7): I've already forgotten what this sounds like oop.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): I feel like I should like this but it sounds a little too out there.

**Mudkip1** (4): repetitive

**BiPolarBear17** (2.5): I feel like there's one day a week where I might enjoy this but every other day it just gives me a headache.

(Leix) The first song above a 8 average! Two Way Street is a really cute love song like most of you mentioned. Kimbra's lyricism shines brightly here, with all the traffic references. There was a time where I would just listen to this song and nothing else that lasted for like a few weeks, the wholesomeness of it just pulls you in and doesn't let you go.

(Luna) I feel like this song's placement in the middle of the album makes people not think about it as much, but I like this quite a bit! The snazzy instrumentals are really nice on the ears. Remember, love is mutual, kids!

---

## I THINK I AM REAADYYY TO LET YOU GET UNDER MY SKIN

**chipsi1** (10): the piano in this omg

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): a super sweet song and also a very important thing for people to remember! love is in fact a two way street; it can't just be one person putting in time and effort! "the cars could all collide/the shards of glass wont catch my eye" is also one of her best lyrics tbh

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Love the instruments on this song.

**letsallpoo** (10): theres a street near me called "friendship street" that's one way only

**m4ttycool** (10): I need love :(

**Mudkip1** (10): another really pretty song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://i.imgur.com/jzkKp0W.jpg

(Leix) Isn't it crazy and amazing how she went from songs like this to the chilling opener "Happy" in Froot? I am really happy she is feeling way better now in her life. THe breakdown after the last chorus is amazing and this song deserved way better in this rate but alas…

(Luna) I used to skip over this song while listening to TFJ, which is astonishing to me now because this is just...perfection. This is an easy 9-10, it's full of such a perfect vulnerability and the crackers verse is one of my favourite verses on the album. I'm sad this didn't manage to make top 10.

---

## the essay :deadbanana: part 2

**chipsi1** (11): okay, before I start this write-up I just want to state that this is like my favorite song ever so this might seem a little too stan-ish, but me stanning Marina isn't anything new, so...

IMO, the genius of this song lies in the repetition of the chorus, each time she repeats the chorus, it gets a new meaning based on the context it has in the song. The first time it shows up in the song, it's about dealing with a toxic relationship:

Won't you quit your crying? I can't sleep One minute I'm a little sweetheart And next minute you are an absolute creep

However, the unique thing about this is the fact that the relationship was also probably damaged by the fact that they both have anxiety, which is shown in the first chorus:

*I want to wipe out all the sad ideas that come to me when I am holding you*

*All you ever think about are sick ideas involving me, involving you*

The second time Marina repeats the chorus, she's probably reffering to herself seeing as it comes after a very long (and absolutely fucking genius) verse that paints a very obvious picture of Marina's social anxiety, and comes after a pre-chorus that can very easily be attributed to that same verse ("Can't let your cold heart be free when you act like you've got an OCD"). Additionally, there's an interesting addition to the chorus ("I want to erase every nasty thought that bugs me every day of every week" and "You never told me what it was that made you strong and what it was that made you weak") the first line is pretty obviously reffering to her mind/anxiety negatively impacting her life, and my interpertation of the second one can be seen as a reach, but IMO it's reffering to her basically not knowing what causes this and how she can get rid of it. Marina's anxiety is something she views as a weakness.

And the third one is the one i've had the most difficulty interpreting, however, i've come to the conclusion that if Marina's referring to herself in the second chorus, the way she's repeating "Made you weak" could be her saying that she herself is the thing that makes her weak, she's not good enough in her own eyes.

Sounds like a little bit of a reach, but it's just a loose interpretation, I feel like this song can be taken in so many different ways which is another thing I love about it.(n)Also, I feel the need to mention her delivery in the first verse because it's literally the best delivery I've ever heard in a song and it honestly helps paint the picture Marina is trying to paint so much.

## SUUUUPERMARKET OH WHAT PACKET OF CRACKERS TO PICK?

**m4ttycool** (11): This songs means so much to me. And I love everything about it.

**Marshynarsh** (11): This is one of my all time favourite songs, the way that she represents her thoughts in the song is honestly so real and her breakdown in the supermarket gets pretty close to the running thoughts of my mind when I am feeling particularly anxious

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the gradual build up in this is stunning; also v relatable

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): the most “normal” sounding song on the album, but Marina still manages to put her spin on it and make it unique.

**specfagular** (10): fuck supermarkets and the damn crackers

**CarlieScion** (9): I really like how clean her voice sounds in this

**vayyiqra** (9): she writes such nice ballads

**awryj** (8): aww that crackers part

**whatareblackhole** (8): Raw vocals!!! 2010 Marina is iconic. The cracker scene is iconic. This song is iconic.

(Luna) This just might be my favourite ever Florence song, and the funny thing is is that it took time for this to creep up on me. As I said earlier, I love songs about Drinking To Forget, and this of course fits that bill, but in addition to that I just love the use of harp, I love the explosive chorus, and I love love LOVE that dreamy, melodic, and oh-so-tragic bridge. "And I've never felt so aliiiiive...and soooo...dead."

---

## And I never felt so alive...

**awryj** (10): This song is going to be ROBBED HARD. The swinging beat and the angelic arpeggios, the fairytale verses and bombastic choruses - it all is so beautiful and I feel like it not being a single will make it a Day 2 song :/ Also, can we please get more harp in pop? It's not even that prominent in this track but it makes it so much richer, I love the repeating riff so much

**BiPolarBear17** (10): I'll never not be pressed that this got scrapped as a single for a reissue of Dogs Days Are Over :fish2: It was originally my favourite from the album, and I still remember staying up late (an absolute REBEL I know) to watch the video premier. With regards to the song itself, it's just an absolute bop and a half. The soft, delicate verses are amazingly contrasted by the gut punch that the chorus packs, and this applies to both the whimsical instrumental and Welch's vocals which go from almost whispered to belting within a split second.

**kappyko** (10): Another unexpected turn holy shit they really did put effort into this album huh

**twat\_brained** (10): 🚨B O P A L E R T🚨

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): that little break in the bridge snatches me every time

**chipsi1** (9): me

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): Fantastic lyrics once again, one of the best songs about self destructive behavior. Relatable legend!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Florence + The String Bean

**deadspiderwall** (8.5): sounds like I'll Be Waiting by Adele

**izeasklapaucius** (8.5): Nice beats.

**RandomRocketKat** (8.5): Guys i dont think shes quite over him

**banananaise** (8): the unreleased video is honestly so bizarre. her outfits and the set look great but the contact lenses are the most jarring thing, and the whole flashing lights and bold colours thing just clashes with the folk pop rock thing

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Dog Days' lesser but still amazing sister. Great pick me up.

**whatareblackhole** (8): ~wavy~

(Leix) An outlier in Lungs; Blinding is haunting and gorgeous. She can really pull of the dark songs well, so if you like this and didn't listen to her other albums definitely check out Seven Devils from Ceremonials.

(Luna) This song is a weird one, because it's not really talked about as much as other Florence and either other Lungs songs, and yet it's SO GODDAMN GOOD. I'm so glad it got into the top 15, it's so haunting and heavy-- it's real a lesser-talked-of high point on the album.


---

## Seems that I have been held, in some dreaming state

**BiPolarBear17** (11): There are so many 11 worthy songs across all 3 albums, however it's Blinding which takes that title for me. Blinding manages to create such a dark, ethereal atmosphere, whether it's through the raven's caw and the laughter that start the song off, or the pounding drums that have your heart pounding with them. It's a huge song that always leaves me covered in goosebumps, and there's no other song on Lungs quite like it. Also the second prechorus and the bridge floor me every single time.

**CarlieScion** (10): This is beautiful

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): DRAMA! EXCITEMENT! VOCALS!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This is so haunting. Love it.

**fourchip** (10): her lyricism really shines here imo

**twat\_brained** (9.7): I love how this sounds. This is just yet more proof that Florence Welch is the indie songstress we all need in our lives.

**banananaise** (9): i forgot this wasn't a single. the chant-y chorus and the haunting post-chorus are so strong, it's stayed in my head for a decade now

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): This would be a great song to use for the credits of an epic fantasy movie

**izeasklapaucius** (9): Wicked instrumentation.

**kappyko** (9): didn't expect the longest song on the album to not be a snoozer this is good

**vayyiqra** (9): another creepy-cool witchy bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Florence + The Unseen

## No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world

**whatareblackhole** (7): I've always thought this to be a kind of boring end to the album.

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Goes on a little long

**RandomRocketKat** (6): This is just sorta here but its not bad makes for good background

(Leix) One of Florence's most famous songs, You've Got The Love is also one of her many covers. 

(Luna) Repeat: we LOVE an iconic queen of hit covers! F+ATM really made this song their own with this one, and it just makes me so deliriously happy whenever I hear it. It's stunning and triumphant and feels genuinely very joyful, it's a real gem. Plus, yet again-- that harp!

---

## They got the love

**awryj** (10): Everyone's arguing which version of this song is the best and I'm telling ya, ALL OF THEM. I love the anthemic Florence cover, the original 1986 version (a total BOP), the house remix, the countless edits - they're all great and they all deserve 10s. Florence did this song justice and it's one of my favorites by her. A close contender for my 11.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this isn't even a cover at this point it's basically hers

**kappyko** (10): the xx's remix of this is fantastic kcaskkks the drums just came in i was hyst jgaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**m4ttycool** (10): You got the love You got the love You got the love You got the love You got the love You got the love

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I love Swedish House Mafia

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Yet another INCREDIBLE cover. Beautifully produced to feel magical this song is something special. A perfect album closer (it closes the standard version) to a nearly perfect album.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Florence + The Widescreen

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): bop

**twat\_brained** (10): Florence just sings with so much joy and power here! A fantastic choice for a single.

**chipsi1** (8.5): You've Got The Bops

**fourchip** (8.5): serving vocals!!!

**izeasklapaucius** (8.5): Nice outro for the album.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Decent finish to an album that otherwise stumbled near the end.

**CarlieScion** (8): A decent closer, I think it's a tiny bit too short tho

**vayyiqra** (8): such a nice close to the album

**kinglet22** (7.7): fun, prefer the xx remix tbh

**Raykel** (7): Ok so she really likes using harps so what if she got Joanna Newsom to do it for her and make it sound more creative? I'm shaking at the thought.

**whatareblackhole** (7): We love a pop diva!

# They don't got the love

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): This is underwhelming. Why was it released as a single? Calvin Harris remix is better

**SkyBlade79** (3): really generic

(Leix) 0.33 point jump now! Withdraw is one of the elusive Australian version songs of Vows, and it is pretty lovely! Definitely deserving its place as the best song of the infamous three.

(Luna) In hindsight, this is my 2nd favourite Kimbra bonus track. I enjoy the slow swaying tempo of this song, it brings to mind a 50s/60s lounge singer singing it mournfully in a darkly-lit room surrounded by smoke.

(Leix) It feels like she is directly talking to me and it disturbs me a bit. "Do I need to lie, to make my way in life?" especially hits hard since there were some decisions I made in my life where I told the truth and got the short end of the stick. Turns out, you do need to lie to make your way in life sometimes. Anyways, the emotion in her voice can be heard in the infamous "It's my problem if I feel the need to hide, It's my problem if I have no friends and feel like I need to die" line, I don't care if this line or the song overall is pretentious or not really. I also think calling everything personal about you that is not cool pretentious prevents people from opening up about their troubles and just affects everyone bad. /rant

(Luna) "And it's my problem if I have no friends and feel I want to die." Wow! We love a relatable queen! This is such an iconic opening track for me, and is probably legitimately in my top 10 Marina songs in general. This song will always instantly bring me back to sunny Friday afternoons in 2014 where I'd play this album and get sucked into it all over again.

---

## @everyone

**fourchip** (11): me @ me while i watch myself actively ruin my own life

**chipsi1** (10): Probably my second favorite album opener ever, which is fitting since TFJ is my favorite album of all time.(n)The main theme surrounding this album is Marina's perception of herself and reality, and from my perspective it seems like Marina's talking about how achieving her goals in life and getting what she wanted hasn't helped her in the road to happiness, and that she thought that getting those goals would make her happy, or it least happier than she was before. But they haven't, she just keeps wanting more and more and chasing more goals.(n)She also invites the listeners to basically ask themselves if they're satisfied with what they've got, or do they wanna keep chasing superficial goals and hanging on to the day that they'll get those goals, and if they feel satisfied with their lives as they are.(n)I've always seen this as Marina telling the listeners to not judge her for having basically everything an artist could wish for in order to start their career and seemingly everything a person would want in order to live a happy life; she's not extremely poor and she doesn't look bad, but it's her life, and if she's unhappy with it, it's a problem she has to deal with. She doesn't need anybody to judge her for her problems because she already does it enough for herself.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): no i'm not but that's why i'm trying to improve myself, marina!

**InfernalSolstice** (10): relatable

**m4ttycool** (10): Definitely one of my favorite songs

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i feel personally attacked

**Mudkip1** (10): i've never been a fan of her low register (which is basically her normal register since that's basically how she always sings) but i like this

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Perfect album opener. Introduces the concepts in the album and slaps at the same time.

**specfagular** (10): AND ITS MY PROBLEM IF I HAVE NO FRIENDS AND FEEL I WANT TO DIE (/r/me_irl)

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): <3

**izeasklapaucius** (9.5): Great lyrics and melody!

**twat\_brained** (9): Fantastic introduction, honestly.

**vayyiqra** (9): her mission statement

**whatareblackhole** (9): What a way to start an album! Queen of existentialism.

**kappyko** (8.5): so far? pretty satisfied!

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): i’m doing this rate instead of something productive so yes

**Marshynarsh** (8): A fantastic opening song, sets a good tone for the rest of the album

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Type of Jewel: Garnet

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Sheesh how many syllables can you fit into one line

## DAE autotune and bad vocals

**CarlieScion** (7): I find Marina's voice slightly grating, but I appreciate the emo vibes

**awryj** (6.8): Is this autotune that I hear? Cause it's kinda jarring

**Raykel** (6.8): I like the lyrics, and sonically it's ok, but the autotuned "satisfIED" seems really out of place and comes out of nowhere.

(Leix) This song is quirky gone wrong. Kimbra's uh-oh uh-uh-uh-uh-UH 's in the chorus get annoying after a while but the cute verses save it from being a mediocre song.

(Leix) Not a favorite of mine, but still a good song! The lyrics are pretty great, and her accent is so on point here. It also gave us the iconic Shakira line!

(Luna) "I'm obsessed with the mess that's America" is something a lot of non-American pop culture enthusiasts can relate to, I imagine, especially in the current climate. I feel like if I was gonna give someone a crash course on MATD, this is definitely one of the songs I'd link them to first-- it really captures Marina's spirit and personal stylings as best as any song on TFJ could, at least to me, lol.

---

## Oh my god, you looks just like Shakira...

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): This will always be my favorite song from Marina ever. This obsession on celebrity culture hits home hard.

**skargardin** (11): What a fantastic song all around and the real peak of TFJ.

**SkyBlade79** (8): she looks nothing like Shakira I’m screaming

**awryj** (10): polan stronk

**BiPolarBear17** (10): Actually my name's Trey I have a basketball game tomorrow

**chipsi1** (10): This is one of the most playful and sassy songs on the album, with the odd second verse and the amount of shade she threw at the American music industry.(n)I feel like this song was both her criticizing the "american dream" and just how flawed the concept of it is, especially in the first verse and in the chorus ("You wanted kissing in the rain") and her trying to emphasize that there's an individual behind the music and how she's scared of losing her identity with the second verse, which is a pretty unique take on pop stardom.

## No no, you're Catherine Zeta...

**m4ttycool** (10): album version is better

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): iconique as the kids say.

**specfagular** (10): GOD I remember going to a Journeys in the mall to buy some Vans and this song (and mv) playing and my little stan self freaking the FUCK out.

**twat\_brained** (10): Anderson Cooper be like… "I'm obsessed with the mess that's America". Highkey though this is easily top 10 in Marina's entire catalog.

**izeasklapaucius** (9): Sarcastic, yet kinda sad.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): this is a bop but kinda overrated

**banananaise** (8): i google image searched 'marina shakira' and this came up http://i.imgur.com/Jnx4YJr.png which tbh pretty accurately represents the average aesthetic sense of the 2012-era tumblr marina fandom

(Luna) Wow, this got further than I thought it would! This was even in the top 10 for a while until the end, and I didn't even know this was a single. Don't mistake that as me saying I dislike this, though, because I DEFINITELY do not. This is a great song; Kimbra's delivery is some of the best as it gets on Vows, the melody is catchy with a lot of personality, and I definitely appreciate the guitar that comes through clear in the end. Stay tuned tomorrow for the results of our top 10 main songs and top 3 bonus songs, babes!

## A Simlish legend without a negative comment!

**izeasklapaucius** (11): Loved it when I first heard it on The Sims 3 and still love it til now!

**Mudkip1** (10): sounds very old timey and vengeful idk how to use words correctly but i like this

**specfagular** (10): This is the best song off of Vows and I will fight anyone who disagrees

**twat\_brained** (10): I felt myself really grooving to this at the end! It feels like something passed on from Amy Winehouse which is what really gives it an edge over the rest of the album.

**fourchip** (9): this is where harmful stereotypes of the kiwi accent came from… give me a reason not to hate kimbra

**m4ttycool** (9): nice

**SkyBlade79** (9): omg this is so jazzy and awesome

**vayyiqra** (9): sassy bop

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): this is GROOVY

**skargardin** (8): This album is really low-key in a good way so far!

**whatareblackhole** (8): I've always been weirdly annoyed by this song, but it's good!

**CarlieScion** (7): This sorta bops? but it also really reminds me of another song that i cant remember the name of

## Hell is full of good meanings, but heaven is full of good works.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_road_to_hell_is_paved_with_good_intentions

## Kimbra 007

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this sounds like it would be in some movie about spies a la mr & mrs smith except actually good.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This song makes me feel like I'm in a spy movie.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): What James Bond movie is this the theme of? It's so groovy. I love it.

myhatrules: Homophobia is Marina only having 2 songs left after 2 rounds, especially Are You Satisfied, Mowgli's Road, and Hollywood being cut so early. I'm despondent. Oh No! better make top 5.
