https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/85d4gq/rate_reveal_2010s_indiepop_debuts_rate_day_3_this/

Hello! Guess who's back? I couldn't do the reveal here yesterday for some personal reasons, **so I would like to thank my co-host /u/lunasaflowers again for all their help yesterday! <3** I eventually could join plug.dj at the last few songs but since my laptop is kinda clunky and can't multi-process at times I couldn't join reddit. But I am here now, at my PC! And with more charts! And Miss Songeniality! And The Participation Award, think of it like Miss Songeniality but robbed artist! Without further ado, welcome to the Day 3 reveal of the 2010s Indie-Pop Debuts rate, I hope we will all be happy with the results.

* Me and my dear co-host /u/lunasaflowers will reveal #10-#1 in the main rate and #3-#1 in the bonus rate.

* Rate reveal will start at **3:30 PM EST**, join our [plug.dj room](https://plug.dj/popheads/) for the fun!

* We had **55** participants in the **main rate** which made us happy a lot! :) **33 people also did the bonus rate**, a special thank you to the first  ~17-18 people who had to do it before the split! :)

* Overall song average is: **8.0480**

**Lowest Scores:** (4 x1) letsallpoo (5 x3) Discord\_and\_Dine, kinglet22, Mudkip1

(Leix) One of the first songs that I loved on TFJ, I Am Not A Robot deserves its place as one of the best Marina songs in my opinion. It may be quite basic compared to others but I still think it has a nice message and her voice here is just beautiful.

(Luna) I used to think this song was a little overrated, but honestly I was wrong as fuck because the more time goes on the more I love this. I love how it's about letting oneself be vulnerable and the instrumentals are so pretty. I'm glad this survived the Marina slaughter to get to the top 10.

---

## HELLO FELLOW HUMANS

**InfernalSolstice** (10): /r/totallynotrobots

**Marshynarsh** (10): The theme song of filling out recaptchas

**Kaylaboe** (9): [beep] HAHA. SO RELATABLE MARINA.

**mokitsu** (9): sophia shook

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I will sing this to Google if it means they get the message

**fourchip** (7.5): sophia’s favourite song

**letsallpoo** (4): me after passing the captcha to make my club penguin account

## no drama-ma

**banananaise** (10): guuuh all i can think of when i watch the video is that drama on tumblr years ago because that blog 'your fave is problematic' said the scene of Marina painted with the black glitter was blackface

## can you teach me how to feel?

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): can you teach me how to feel! real!

**m4ttycool** (10): Can you teach how to feel real?

## Oh, go on and cry, baby; 'Cause you don't have to keep it inside

**CarlieScion** (10): Iconic

**chipsi1** (10): This is really relatable, at least as a gay guy living in a pretty homophobic country who always felt like he should maintain a "manly" image. A lot of the complaints against toxic masculinity get shrugged off by the general public, seemingly because they view it as a "sjw" type of act or whatever, but I feel like this is presented well enough to even convince someone with that stance to be against toxic masculinity.

This seems like it's directed at the effects of toxic masculinity on the person who is actually practicing it, which is honestly probably the most unique and smart take i've heard on the subject.

**kappyko** (10): honestly i should hate this but it's had such an impact on me since middle school lol. "you are sooo magneeeetic". sounds like flying

**skargardin** (10): This hits me hard, much more so than when it released.

**specfagular** (10): this song is beautiful. i love her

**whatareblackhole** (10): I loooove this song and what it's saying. It's okay to feel, ladies!

**izeasklapaucius** (9): Inspiring and funny lyrics.

**awryj** (8): it sounds like a theme song for a cartoon for preschoolers, in a good way

**vayyiqra** (8): iconic but a little sick of it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Type of Jewel: Alexandrite

## SAD!

**Raykel** (6): Aw it started off different and promising but then it lost its magic.

**SkyBlade79** (6): bad rhymes but it’s… okay

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): Is she incapable of making songs that don't sound sad

Leixander: # #9: Kimbra - Warrior
---
**Average:** 8.544 **// Total Points:** 469.9 **// Controversy:** 1.588

---
**Highest scores:** (10 x19) agentofscranton, CandlePrince, CarlieScion, chipsi1, Elitefourbrad, fourchip, InfernalSolstice, jamesfog, Leixander, letsallpoo, Marshynarsh, MirandaCrocsgrove, Mudkip1, RandomRocketKat, SkyBlade79, theburningundead, TragicKingdom1, twat\_brained, vayyiqra (9.7 x1) cloudbustingmp3 (9.5 x1) mokitsu 

**Lowest Scores:** (3 x1) kinglet22 (4.5 x1) BiPolarBear17 

---

(Leix) Warrior has great production, and features ice cold vocals from Kimbra which is strikingly different from her warm and graceful voice in all the other songs in Vows. Mark Foster's contribution carries this song to another level too!

(Luna) Damn, I wasn't expecting this to get so far! This is an electronic bop, but even though I enjoy it when I listen to it I tend to forget how it goes after. Huh. Still good tho!

---

## did someone say mark foster

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I need her to collaborate more with daddy Mark Foster.

**fourchip** (10): purely because mark foster exists

**DraculaWeekend** (9): I remember this from that Converse ad! Foster the People has such a recognizable sound.

**izeasklapaucius** (7): Love Mark Foster's contribution. This could fit on Torches really good!

## a BANGER and a GOOD closer!

**CarlieScion** (10): A bop, a good closer

**Mudkip1** (10): i love dubstep

**SkyBlade79** (10): those synths are amazing

**twat\_brained** (10): This is the PERFECT outro song for this album!

**vayyiqra** (10): badass closing track

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): a simple bop! sometimes that's all you need!

**awryj** (9): Wow why didn't I know this bop before?

**specfagular** (9): no offents but this goes awf yas miss kimbra

**banananaise** (8): this is the most 2012 thing i've heard. also does anyone else get Q-Tip and A-Trak confused all the time? i saw the artist credits and was like "ah yes, A-Trak from Mark Ronson's hit song Bang Bang Bang"

**kappyko** (8): what the fuck this goes hard but what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck is this actually kimbra what the fuck what the fuck this is so weird but i vibe. overstimulatinbg though

**whatareblackhole** (8): I was so gagged when I heard this song playing in a PacSun back in, like, 1973! Yas!

## GENERIC TRASH

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): Cheese city. This is bland and boring in every way

**BiPolarBear17** (4.5): The weakest track off Vows, sorry u/fourchip ! :meghan:

**kinglet22** (3): not very soulful or interesting to me

## no!!!

(Leix) A lover saving you from depression and making you want to try to live again? Girl, I wish. I love to pretend I am playing a violin in the end of the song where it goes "...TO SINK- DU DU DU DUN, DU DU DU DUN, DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN!"

(Luna) Okay, this is a JAM. I'm kinda sad it wasn't on the main version of the album, it's great enough to justify a spot there!

(Leix) LOUDER THAN SIRENS, LOUDER THAN BELLS

Drumming Song is catchy and really fun to sing along! I am kinda surprised it got this far honestly, but I am not mad. 

(Luna) SWEETER THAN HEAVEN AND HOTTER THAN HEEEEEEELL. This song is so thundering and powerful! For me being in love feels more like a warm buzzing feeling, but I can definitely get behind describing it like a pounding drum in your chest.

(Leix) After hearing some somber songs from Lungs, Flo's label wanted some happy upbeat songs to serve as singles. Florence and Isabella responded with this song, a twisted fairytale that includes animal sacrifice and punishment by the Midas touch. This is the perfect indie-pop song in my mind; catchy with great instrumentation while still having the lyrical depth.

(Luna) THIS IS A GIFT! IT COMES WITH A PRICE! WHO IS THE LAMB AND WHO IS THE KNIFE? This song is so fucking good! It's top-tier baroque pop, and is an excellent introductory track for anyone who wants to get someone into Florence, in my opinion.

---
## WHO IS THE LAMB AND WHO IS THE KNIFE?

**awryj** (11): Indie pop perfection. I swear when I first heard this song it was stuck in my head for a year. It's incredible. It's ecstatic and explosive, it's got the right amount of suspense, and, besides, I love Alice in Wonderland so I can't not love the music video for this... Also I feel like this song is going to be robbed, so I have no choice, 10 is the only way to go. (Host note: they changed it to 11 after a while)

**BiPolarBear17** (10): Rabbit Heart was my first introduction to Florence + The Machine, and I still remember being absolutely blown away when I first heard it back as a kid. The song captures you right from the first few seconds and it never lets go; it's an enchanting experience from start to finish. Not only would I argue that this is the track that best represents Lungs, I'd argue it's the track that best represents the band as a whole. It's near impossible to outmatch the stellar chorus that this has.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): one of F+TM's best bridges! makes me feel reborn as a beautiful sacrificial virgin tbh

**fourchip** (10): i’m the lamb, this album is the knife and florence has slit my throat wide open

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Once again really great stuff from her. Didn't expect the lyrical themes to be fame with a twwist of ritual sacrifice. Azealia Banks found dead with her dead chicken.

**vayyiqra** (10): her best song, just beautiful

**deadspiderwall** (9.5): VOCALS

**specfagular** (9.5): THIS IS A BOP. IT COMES WITH A PRICE

**banananaise** (9): the music video for this is such a strong aesthetic that i'll always associate with Florence - a pre-raphaelite painting as a pop song

**kappyko** (8.5): so if ur 2 skool for kool

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Florence + The Latrine

**twat\_brained** (9): I can already tell this is gonna be the highest-rated album in this rate.

**kinglet22** (8.5): meaty

**m4ttycool** (8): I love sacrifices

**whatareblackhole** (8): Ooooh, I've always loved this one. I think it follows DDAO really nicely.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Shaky lyrics but the instrumentals come to save them

(Leix) BUM-BU-BUM-BAH! Settle Down is Kimbra's most succesful solo effort, and it is really easy to see why. It is catchy, cute and just so, so lovable. If I have to compare it with a song, I would say it is a cuter version of You Belong With Me. It is really hard not to root for Kimbra while she asks the first star she sees in the night to keep her lover by her side.

(Luna) This was the first Kimbra solo joint I ever heard, and holy shit, I was SNATCHED. This song is absolutely magical, and I love the way it constantly shifts and changes while remaining an absolute JAM throughout! Hands down my favourite song off of Vows, and I'm very glad it managed to make the top 10.

---

## wow mudkip you were right

**Mudkip1** (11): i have this horrible feeling that people aren't gonna enjoy this masterpiece. this deserves to win

## a person with indie-cred

**banananaise** (11): i will forever find it slightly funny that the spotify album cover for this song isn't the vows cover but instead some random weather channel compliation album. but on a serious note when i found the video somehow on youtube i showed my mum (bcos we are from new zealand and so is kimbra) and said she will be big, which hasn't really come true but i want to lay my claim to indie cred right now

## oops

**BiPolarBear17** (10): I'd be over the moon if this somehow managed to sneak a victory because it's an absolutely fantastic song. It's wonderfully wacky, and as she transitions from acapella to singing over a beat of just clapping, it feels like it shouldn't work at all but it does, mainly thanks to it's explosive chorus which ties everything together brilliantly.

## would settle down with kimbra

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the layers in this song are insaaaaane. such a brave way to start an album, and it really is a great intro to the framework of the record. there's the jazziness of her scatting, a nice groove, and at the core of everything, Kimbra's incredible voice. when she explodes into the chorus, it's magical. her backing harmonies are lush af

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Nebraska Jones is a choice

**kappyko** (10): boom boom pow

**Kaylaboe** (10): a boppie sent from the suburbs of Auckland, where Kimbra settled down and eventually gave birth to the lorde and saviour Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor

**m4ttycool** (10): I can't believe I haven't heard this song (and album) before

**Marshynarsh** (10): This song was everywhere when it came out in New Zealand and I never got sick of it. Such an interesting sound that constantly changes throughout the song

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Bop opener

**specfagular** (10): The first song I heard from Kimbra and while I didn't like it with my first listen I absolutely love it now

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://i.imgur.com/tIjHemt.jpg

**RandomRocketKat** (9): Clingy bitch

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This is wierd, but I can dig it.

**vayyiqra** (9): boom ba-boom BA I wanna settle down with her

**awryj** (8.8): People call Carly a pop version of Overly Attached Girlfriend... Well, she's got competition

**CarlieScion** (8): This is the first solo Kimbra song I've heard but it's really good

**fourchip** (8): the best part of this song is literally part of a like... old wives tale

**izeasklapaucius** (8): Groovy. One of her song that I like when I first listened to her music back then. Drags after like 3 minutes tho.

**sandwichsparrow** (8): what a song to open with!

**SkyBlade79** (8): these lyrics are nonsense but this is a bop

**twat\_brained** (8): I feel like for a debut single this would be of slightly higher quality.

**whatareblackhole** (8): Ugh, yes!!! I love this song (and video) so much!!

**Raykel** (7.5): Pentatonix is shaking.

## would rather settle down with someone else

**kinglet22** (6.5): decent song, like the soul but the lyrics & chorus are a little lacking imo

**InfernalSolstice** (5): please tell me the whole album doesn't sound like this

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (3): Horrendous neo-doowop with weird lyrics

(Leix) Howl and Girl With One Eye are my two favorite songs from Florence and among my ten favorite songs ever. Even though my 11 went to Girl With One Eye, I was rooting for Howl to sneak into top 10 somehow and it eventually did! It is the only non-single in this top 10, and it beat many singles which made me really happy. About the song, Howl is basically lusting for your lover but in a Florence Welch-y gorgeous, graceful and non-cringey way.

(Luna) A non-single? In MY r/popheads rate top 5? More likely than you think! Every line of this song is straight-up art to me-- "the fabric of your flesh, pure as a wedding dress, until I wrap myself inside your arms I cannot rest" should be hung in the Louvre TBH. (Down the back, but who cares, still the Louvre.) Everything is on point in this song, it absolutely deserves its place up here.

## Prefers Twilight, the book series

**DraculaWeekend** (11): Those drums make me feel like I'm being hunted. Chills

(Leix) *A fallen star, fell from your heart and landed in my eyes.* Cosmic Love is a stunner, and probably the main reason i listened to Lungs and got into music in general. I used to just listen to singles I heard on radio, and sometimes listen to the songs that I liked the thumbnail of (little leix was pretty shitty wasn't he) in the Youtube sidebar. This was one of them, and the moment I heard those opening lyrics I know I was onto something great. Although I don't like it as much as I used to because of overplay, it is still really important to me since it was literally the song that got me into listening albums and discover many other great songs.

This song had a ~9.57 average early in the rate and I was sure it was going to win, but while the other three competitors recieved solid 10s and 11s afterwards Cosmic Love stagnated and eventually fell. Fourth place is still not bad for a great song like this though!

(Luna) This song is fucking MAGICAL, it's breathtaking. This was #1 for a while, and it's easy to understand why-- both Florence and the beautiful instrumentals are at their full power, and it really is such a romantic song for me at least, lol. I heard this on the radio a couple of weeks ago and it made my whole night.

## Tell me what's next, alien sex

**deadspiderwall** (11): ethereal

**nikitasd** (11): The first song I heard from Florence + The Machine and it was love at first listen. The blaring drums, the soothing harp(especially THAT outro sequence) and the trademark overly-dramatic chorus from Flo that you still don't see coming. I adore everything about it.

**awryj** (10): This is the song that introduced me to Florence. I haven't listened to it in ages because of how overplayed it got years ago and I was afraid that it will lose its magic. It didn't. This odd rush of excitement and nostalgia is still there.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): if my 11 doesn't win i hope this does. amazing, beautiful, wonderful, etc. just makes me feel A Lot of nice things. the fact that something this incredible was written while hungover is a testament to Flo's incredible talent

**Kaylaboe** (10): wig flew to the oort cloud and then an alien responded "did u just say wig"

**m4ttycool** (10): nice

**Marshynarsh** (10): My favourite Florence song, the instruments are so dreamy and her voice is so powerful

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Another signature song for Ms. Welch this song feels epic in every sense of the word. Everything is on point: vocals, lyrics, production. A fine crafted bop.

**specfagular** (10): if u don't like this song ur a fake fan

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Florence + The Sardine

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): iconic

**whatareblackhole** (10): The harp moment at the end of this song ALMOST snatched my 11 from Howl. This song is literal perfection.

**skargardin** (9.5): Her voice is soo powerful!

**twat\_brained** (9.3): Next time I work out I need to put this album on my playlist.

**vayyiqra** (9): everyone loves this

**DraculaWeekend** (8): So pretty

**kappyko** (8): i like the outro

**Raykel** (7.3): I would describe the instrumentation as cosmic so it did its job.

## I prefer to remain in earth, thank you

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Would be a ten as an instrumental piece, I find this a little too depressing

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): Kinda boring.

**kinglet22** (6.5): this is just a good song but I get why people love it

**SkyBlade79** (4): too loud

(Leix) We love a good soundtrack! Chorus is just enchanting and you find yourself singing this even in your first listen, I remember I did. The water imaginary is here as always, but she does it so well that I have no right to complain. The bridge is also stellar and one of her best.

(Luna) This sounds less like a Lungs cut and more like a Ceremonials one, but that's great bc Ceremonials is also FANTASTIC. Love the haunting feel of this one.

NOTHING'S GONNA BRING US DOWN

NOTHING'S GONNA BRING US DOWN

(Luna) And winning the bonus rate is a certified TUNE! This song brings some heavy throwback vibes to the table (which are present throughout Vows but especially prominent here), and it makes for a quality song it's nice to see y'all took to as well.

(Leix) THIS IS NON STOP BABY YOU GOT ME GOING CRAZY

YOU'RE HEAVIER THAN I KNEW

This is one of the best pop songs of this decade and you can't tell me otherwise. First of all, Kimbra is a literal lyrical genius. Second, this bops hard. Third... OPEN UP YOUR HEART AND LET ME PULL YOU OUT OF HERE

Okay okay, let's be serious. This song was never #1 sadly, and I was afraid it was going to drop off the top 10 at some point but in the ended up doing really well, just look at that tiny controversy score! I am really happy this made the top three in the end, it deserves everything and more.

(Luna) And thus, Kimbra bows out. When listening to this song, I always expect to be a little underwhelmed because of the lowkey-ish sound of the verses, but then the chorus kicks in and it's like a Disney fairytale. It's not my favourite Kimbra song, but I definitely understand its popularity and see why it turned out to be Vows's most popular tune in this rate!

---

## LITERALLY ICONIC

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): BUM! BUM! BUM! BUM! THIS IS NONSTOP BABY YOU GOT ME GOIN CRAZY, YOU'RE HEAVIER THAN I KNEW! BUT I DONT WANT NO OTHER YOU'RE MY CAMEO LOVER; ONLY HERE FOR A MOMENT OR TWO! this is an example of perfect pop imo! wonderfully written verses, and insane chorus, and the production is that perfect blend of retro and modern that it still sounds fresh as hell. there are so many little flourishes that only appear once or twice that add soooo much depth. the brass that comes in during the second chorus is where she decides to stop playing hot potato with my wig and just rips my head off entirely.

**kappyko** (11): i love how pretty she is in the video

**twat\_brained** (11): I came into this rate without much attachment to any of the three artists, not expecting to give my 11 to something. And then I heard "Cameo Lover" in full for the first time. This has potential to win the rate, but this is r/popheads, so I'm not holding out hope.

**awryj** (10): This song is basically two bops combined into one - the groovy verses and Motownesque bombastic chorus. The way Kimbra calls "open up your heart" turns my heart into an open book and my bussy into a jackhammer.

**CarlieScion** (10): This is a jam

**chipsi1** (10): You're my cameo wig, only here for a moment or two

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): How could you listen to this and not be happy. It's like shooting sugar right into your bloodstream

**Mudkip1** (10): the chorus is so fun

**nikitasd** (10): No other song can put me in a happy mood instantly (despite some rather dark themes in the lyrics)

**rotating3Dtext** (10): the music video is cute

**skargardin** (10): BOP ALERT, I honestly wasn’t ready for pop-perfection!

**SkyBlade79** (10): omg this is such a bop! So smooth and just fun!

**specfagular** (10): IN THIS HOUSE WE STAN BOPS

**fourchip** (9.5): this surprised me by being good

**izeasklapaucius** (9): Simply BOP

**RandomRocketKat** (9): Open up your heart so she can pull you out bitch. bum bum bum bum bah

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnByuUqMeko

**vayyiqra** (9): same

**whatareblackhole** (9): This is the song that got me into Kimbra. Such a bop. But the video was a choice.

**banananaise** (8.5): pink suit lipstick man is iconic

**BiPolarBear17** (8.5): Queen of breaking it down and breaking down! A multifaceted queen.

**kinglet22** (7): great song name, fun enough song

# Vows

---

**Overall average**: 7.976

---

**jamesfog**: One of my favorite albums of all time! So thankful to have discovered Kimbra in 2012!

**TragicKingdom1**: I was really excited to listen to this album for the first time because it sounded really unique from the clips that I'd heard. The result does partially live up to that expectation-- there are a lot of unique sounds and it's unapologetically weird with its melodies and Kimbra's vocals. For a 19-track album, it never feels repetitive. However, I do feel like at points it gets bogged down by being quirky-for-the-sake-of-being-quirky; sometimes I feel like making a straight-forward indie pop song might've been a better choice. For example, Warrior is my favorite song on here because it's essentially just an 80s inspired, Jack Antonoff-esque production with a dash of Kimbra flair on top. Also, I'd be remiss to mention that the actual recording quality feels painfully low, although that might just be a Spotify thing. Anyways, this is a flawed album but I still enjoyed a lot of it! [Grade: B+]

**specfagular**: Overall a pretty solid album. A few low points that I'm very eh about but the highs outweigh the lows. I got really into Kimbra around 4 years ago during my freshman year of college.

**Discord\_and\_Dine**: I liked this more than I thought I would. It proves to me she shouldn't just be know as that one girl from "Somebody that I Used to Know". It's a little more soupy than Lungs but there's some real gold in here.

**vayyiqra**: got into it recently and have been listening to it nonstop lately

**whatareblackhole**: Vows, to me, has always been a landmark album for pop music. I love listening to Kimbra because the love she feels for her artistry is so palpable. Kimbra is so creative and forward-thinking with her sound. The albums she makes are atmospheres, the sounds bringing you in and inviting you to live within them. The characters that inhabit her worlds are intriguing and complex, broken and strong. Vows was a pinnacle debut because it loosely follows a breakup - the intention for the relationship begins the album (Settle Down) and its demise ends it (The Build Up). These are the vows this couple has made to one another and Kimbra urges us to act as their witness.

**Mudkip1**: 10s almost the whole way through wow we love an icon

**izeasklapaucius**: Arguably the most quiet album between the other two, but still managed to slaps hard with its subtle productions.

**cloudbustingmp3**: full disclosure, this is legiterally my 3rd favorite album of all time behind only Hounds of Love and Reflektor. it's also actually my most scrobbled album ever with nearly 3 times the plays of the album it's ahead of. needless to say, i really love this and i really can't be impartial and fair. this record soundtracked such a vulnerable period in my life, and it's hard for me to separate my personal connection to it when scoring. i hope that anyone who hadn't heard it before got to develop even a tiny fraction of my love for it, and hopefully anyone who didn't quite vibe with it will give it another chance in the future. Kimbra created such a fun and quirky world in this album that's still very accessible, and I'm still noticing new things thousands of plays later.

**letsallpoo**: when i was in like 9th grade i went on basilmarket.com all the time, and one day i met this fellow britney stan (who would always trash beyonce and call her a flop but it was 2011 and anyway thats a story for another day) who would talk about this singer named kimbra and sent me her songs. this was before vows was released and before somebody that i used to know, and when i listened to the songs i remember liking them a bit but not really being in love with them. fast forward a few years and after this album showed up on nearly every spotify ad, i fell in love with it. it's a slow burn, partly jazzy but with r&b influences as well, and it all coagulates into a gorgeous soundscape. one of my favorites of all time! thank you basilmarket boy, wherever you are

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: i came into this not knowing any of her solo material and I honestly just don't think her voice/sound and bjorky tinge is for me... i can see the appeal though, like maybe i'll like her more after just 1 listen idk

**skargardin**: Seriously what an incredible album, I haven’t listened to much of her outside of her more recent stuff and the STIUTK feature so getting a reason to listen to this was the best thing!

**m4ttycool**: I should have listened to this a long time ago!

**kappyko**: *Vows* is a 2011 independently-released romantic black comedy film starring Kimbra Lee Johnson as the main character, a New Zealand babysitter who drops acid, takes off all her clothes, throws herself into black and white body paint, and barks at a troupe of jazz players as she desires to become a '50s housewife

**DraculaWeekend**: This album is so underrated. So many great songs here.

**Elitefourbrad**: I fell asleep listening to this the first time

(Leix)

Happiness, hit her

Like a train, on a traaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-aaaaaaaa-aaaackkkk

This is Florence's signature song so no surprise that it is here! It switched places so many times with Oh No! that I lost count. It really is a magnificent song that deserves to be here, even though I prefer the other songs in Lungs I can't deny the impact of this song on Florence's career. 

(Luna) The last Florence song to make its exit is her most well-known entry not called You Got The Love! It may be the obvious choice, but there's little denying the euphoric, blissful power and energy of Dog Days Are Over, and I can say personally that it makes me happy whenever I hear it. Bravo Florence!

---

## RUN FAST FOR YOUR MOTHER, FAST FOR YOUR FATHER

**InfernalSolstice** (11): generic choice? sure, but a huge bop

**Kaylaboe** (11): happiness with her with an anthem

**static\_int\_husp** (11): This song reminds me a lot of my first semester of college. It played EVERYWHERE that semester. Every social event, every party, every club trying to get people to join. This was in 2015. I don't know why we were so late to musical trends. Maybe because it's we are in Iowa.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): Florence + The Caffeine

## RUN FOR YOUR CHILDREN, YOUR SISTERS AND YOUR BROTHER

**CarlieScion** (10): The first Florence song I heard, bc of Glee lol

**chipsi1** (10): the cat days have begun

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): euphoric, amazing, beautiful. not my favorite F+TM song, but an important one because that VMA performance was what made me check out Lungs, and i've never been the same ever since. experiencing this live is a defining life moment.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): This makes me feel great to be alive. Like every time I hear it things suddenly brighten around me.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Such a great opening song. The harp is gorgeous and the drums are so hard-hitting.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Whoa didn't expect this as a debut opener. Really great stuff.

**kappyko** (10): Probably one of the greatest songs of all time? I hope nobody sabotages this, that'd be awful. This song is such a gorgeous anthem of finding solace and happiness, and I think it's one of the most genuinely happy songs of all time. Apparently most of the sounds on this are from a Yamaha keyboard? Who even fucking does that? How do you squeeze those kinds of sounds from those corny pieces of shit? I own one! That makes my appreciation for this song even greater; how did they even get to do this?

**letsallpoo** (10): i remember when the mv for this song got randomly nominated for video of the year at the vmas. i had never heard of florence before but i watched it and i was snatched! i still think thats what let florence break through in america

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Florence’s signature song and a spectacular album opener. The sheer euphoria of this song is surpassed by her incredible vocals. This song is already a certified classic in my eyes in spite of being relatively new, and I can see it becoming one in the eyes of everyone else too as the years go on.

**RandomRocketKat** (10): idk wtf shes saying during half the chorus but hit those notes

**skargardin** (10): An absolute classic in every sense of the word.

**specfagular** (10): This is, in my experience, the ONE song that everyone who doesn’t know Florence + the Machine knows. I don’t blame them because this is THAT song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): bop

**twat\_brained** (10): This song just comes out of nowhere and punches you right in the face! THAT'S the kind of song intro I'd want on MY album!

**whatareblackhole** (10): An obvious ten. This is the song that most likely got everyone into Florence, so how could I not rate it highly?

## LEAVE ALL YOUR LOVE AND YOUR LONGING BEHIND, YOU CAN'T CARRY IT WITH YOU IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE

**deadspiderwall** (9.5): perfect indie pop

**fourchip** (9.5): an indie classic

**banananaise** (9): this is what freedom sounds like. her performance of this at Oxegen 2010 is on youtube and jesus i wish i was there

**vayyiqra** (8): HAPPI-NESS

## THE DOG DAYS ARE OVER, THE DOG DAYS ARE GONE

## CAN'T YOU HEAR THE LOW SCORES, CAUSE HERE THEY COME!

**kinglet22** (7.5): a little overplayed but it's a fun song

**awryj** (6): I have to admit, I don't get the popularity of this song. It was always my least favorite Florence single, it doesn't really go anywhere and it gets a bit samey. It's got a shitton of energy and it's fun to stomp and sing along to, but come on, Florence is more than just that.

Leixander: # Lungs

---

**Overall average**: 8.277

---

**jamesfog**: It's too damn long.

**TragicKingdom1**: I really enjoyed this album! It's a little same-soundy (probably the worst quality to have when your album is 21 tracks long) but there are distinct emotional high points and low points which I really appreciate. Florence's vocals were very good at expressing these emotions but I did find the lyrics to be pretty hard to understand at times because of the shouty tone of her voice. I also really appreciate some of the unique instruments that were brought into the mix on a few songs. Overall I don't think I'm going to ever listen to this in full again but there are many highlights I'll remember. [Grade: A-]

**specfagular**: Easily the best "vocal powerhouse" of the bunch (seriously Florence sounds like the voice of God herself), Lungs is a great album but personally I’m more of a Ceremonials fan. Great standout tracks but there are a few songs I’m very eh about and one that I just flatout don’t like.

**RandomRocketKat**: She looks like SOPHIE's sister, love it. Cheekbone icons

**Discord\_and\_Dine**: This feels like a soundtrack to some obscure cult movie based on a fairytale. There are some shaky bits but overall a very strong album that I would listen to again.

**vayyiqra**: very nostalgic album for me

**whatareblackhole**: What I like about Lungs is its storytelling. Every song seems like its own encapsulated folktale, a collection of energies that Florence has curated. We use breath to tell stories and to communicate and to connect with others; Florence recognizes the root of this breath and looks to it for inspiration. Lungs is an exciting album and an especially exciting debut because of its expert instrumentation and captivating songwriting.

**CreepyMannequin**: Drags on for too long, but still a quality album

**izeasklapaucius**: Really appreciate the baroque and rock influence in this album.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: i like ceremonials a lil more but lungs still brings the bops!

**kappyko**: *Lungs* is a 2009 film epic directed and written by Florence Welch. Welch portrays the title character, an elven gardener who seeks to find happiness even in the dark of the 18th century woods

**DraculaWeekend**: This is probably the strongest album in the rate. The instrumentation is absolutely gorgeous, and I love how hard-hitting the drums are in pretty much all of the songs. Overall, I think this album is a solid debut that did a great job of establishing Florence's signature sound.

**twat\_brained**: The Bible said Adam & Eve, not Florence and the Machine.

**Elitefourbrad**: I can’t believe I stan Florence now!

(Leix) The TTPT winner wins here as well! A great pop song with great lyrics, *Oh No!* got harder for me to listen after I learned what it was really about. It is about NOT wanting to change but knowing that you NEED to change in order to be succesful. It's about knowing that you are going to fail if you keep going this way but still not being able to change, becoming a self-fulfiling prophecy as Marina says it. I relate really hard to it and even though I bop to it, I bop to it... sadly?

(Luna) We LOVE a deserving rate winner! In mid-2013, I discovered this song via the music autoplay on a tumblr blog I clicked onto, and my life was changed forever. This song is my 11 because it was the beginning of me discovering my own taste in music beyond just listening to whatever CDs my parents played in the car-- in a way, I wouldn't be on this sub without Oh No! The lyrics, the vocals, the production, every single individual beat of this song just RESONATES with me on every possible level, and for that reason it's one of my all-time favourite songs ever, natch. Thank you, Marina, and I hope y'all enjoyed watching our little rate unfold!

---

## I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I WANT AND WHO I WANNA BE

**Elitefourbrad** (11): Pop perfection! Everyone else found dead in a ditch!

**RandomRocketKat** (11): We stan a careerwoman who prioritizes her goals

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): tbh this isn't quite my favorite on the album... but i want to see my fave actually WIN after getting robbed by lorde and lana fans and I'm pretty sure are you satisfied isn't making top 10 :emofish: (leix's note: and you were right!)

**awryj** (10): This song sounds like a lovechild of 2009 Lily Allen, X-era Kylie and Kate Bush's distant relative and I love em all so yknow

**chipsi1** (10): This is probably the most me_irl song in the history of tumblr pop, which is already a subgenere which is considered to be extremely me_irl.

There's so much going on in this song and it's honestly what makes it my second favorite Marina song ever, it's such a mess and it basically reflects what Marina was feeling. She listed her fears, confronted her own narcissism, criticized the media's effect on life and basically just freaked out about everything she possibly could. I've refereed to this song as a musical mental breakdown and ii'l never stop doing so because it's so accurate, freaking out about every possible thing that's holding you back is such a common thing among so many millennials.

I also consider this song to be ahead of it's time, seeing as singing about those types of insecurities has been so common ever since the tumblr pop revolution in 2013.

**kappyko** (10): Absolutely OOZES cool. Kurstin did this song right, the most apt realization of this album's themes of success and excess. Comic book cool.

**Kaylaboe** (10): such a good song. her satirical tone is on point, the lyrics are great and the production is excellence

**m4ttycool** (10): I jizz while I change

**rotating3Dtext** (10): first Marina song I ever heard

**specfagular** (10): "I'm gonna live, I'm gonna fly, I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna die". I relate

**twat\_brained** (10): This was a perfect choice for a single and honestly I hope it gets at least top 5 in the rate.

**whatareblackhole** (10): If this won this rate, I wouldn't be mad. This is an incredible pop song.

## @everyone Part 2

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): the whole possessions bit feels like one giant @

**SkyBlade79** (9.5): quite the formidable bop

**izeasklapaucius** (9): Goddammit why are her lyrics is so fuckin good? She reminds me why I like Lily Allen. They're both snarky bitches.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Type of Jewel: Sardonyx

**DraculaWeekend** (8): I just wanna change I just wanna change

**Mudkip1** (8): this is kinda cute

**vayyiqra** (7): insanely catchy chorus

## Oh No!

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): I know this is their big song but It's just okay? Please don't crucify me

**Raykel** (5.5): Her songs always start with a really cool instrumental and then goes nowhere. This is one of the biggest offenders. Except for the "oh no" part, which reminds me of Kesha's Backstabber which is also a better song, nothing grabs me after the first 5 seconds.

Leixander: ---

# The Family Jewels

---

**Overall average**: 7.902

---

**Marshynarsh**: My introduction to Marina and the Diamonds and I have been obsessed ever since, it came out at a time where I was a pretty insecure and awkward teenager and it has stuck with me ever since.

**TragicKingdom1**: I went into this album with moderately high expectations and honestly I'm pretty let down. I was expecting pretty melodic pop music and to an extent I did get that, but it was frequently bogged down by unnecessary dramatics and vocal effects. I feel like both Marina and Kimbra went for the same quirkiness, but for Kimbra it was effective and for Marina it was just annoying. This isn't bad by any means but I'm going to revisit the other albums in this rate sooner. [Grade: C+]

**specfagular**: I used to be a hardcore Marina stan in high school and I absolutely love this album from start to finish. Don't expect any low scores (below like a 7) for this tbh. I promise I’m not pulling any fuckery I am just in love with this album

**RandomRocketKat**: this is a gem to me

**Discord\_and\_Dine**: I was not the biggest fan of this album. The rock songs are great but I'm never liked overly sad songs and this seems like an overly sad album. I would probably listen on Spotify once but wouldn't actively seek out this album again.

**vayyiqra**: longtime Marina lover; listen to it the least of her albums but still good

**chipsi1**: My favorite album of all time, and it's probably one of the main reasons i'm so attached to tumblr-pop as a genre and will always defend it.

It's funny how this is actually pretty ahead of it's time, considering it came out about 3 years before the tumblr pop revolution, and, IMO, no tumblr pop album (at least dealing with the same topics) has gotten even close to it in terms of quality.

I think the main factor that makes this album great is that it's actually real. Or at least, feels real because Marina sells it really well, even if you didn't like the album, you could tell she was in an actual state of panic in a lot of the songs.

I've described Oh No! as a panic attack in the form of a song, but I think it's also accurate for the rest of the album as well. Between Seventeen, Guilty and Shampain, this literally feels like one big, orchestrated mental breakdown and that's part of what makes it so great. I don't think I've ever heard another album that pulls the whole musical mental breakdown thing off as well as TFJ, and probably never will.

Marina's lyricism and delivery on the album also reflect that, she manages to keep this consistent feel of panic and it definitely managed to keep me on edge thanks to some of her incredibly weird and theatrical yet very entertaining outbreaks (like the chorus of Girls or that one milk line on The Outsider).

**whatareblackhole**: I love Marina, but The Family Jewels has always been the hardest of her albums for me to get into and with which to connect. I think it's an important album and a good jumping off point for the rest of her career, but I've never found a lot of common ground for myself with The Family Jewels. So much of it seems so brash and fantastical with layers upon layers of metaphor that I get lost trying to decipher what Marina is trying to say. However, I enjoy a good chunk of the album and think she asserted herself as an indie darling.

**Mudkip1**: good lord this was a chore

**izeasklapaucius**: Bombastic, in-your-face album with snarky and sarcastic is my weakness. This is one of them.

**Number3rdInTheVoting**: This album is an example of a perfectly realized artistic vision. Most pop girls CAN’T relate.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: tbh this shit means so much to me that it's legit straight 10s... even guilty i could write legit essays on all of these tracks but I don't really have that kind of time so just know that they're ALL that bitch

**m4ttycool**: this album is me

**kappyko**: Marina Diamandis stars in this 2010 chick flick as a forgotten Broadway reject, now singing of her trauma as she succumbs to the voices in her head. As a constant fame-seeking banshee, she screeches and claws her way to get to the top of the Hollywood food chain. Oh yeah the year is also 1988

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: why did I never bother to listen to this album before? I’m suing myself

**DraculaWeekend**: I remember finding Marina and the Diamonds on Myspace years ago and loving how weird Mowgli's Road was. Thankfully, the rest of the album is similarly weird and fun.

**Elitefourbrad**: Wow Marina is a legend! I still like FROOT a little more, but overall a great album!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: Easily my favorite Marina album. There's so many underated bops here!

Leixander: Thank you everyone for joining again! I am trying to upload the spreadsheet at the moment, as it is in my language I am not sure if the averages may work on you or not. Don't hesitate to DM me on Discord or here if that happens. While I am doing that, here are the progression charts for the top 10!
