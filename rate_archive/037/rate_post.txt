[RATE] 2010s Indie-Pop Debuts
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7un927/rate_2010s_indiepop_debuts/

Hello there! I am u/Leixander and with the help of my dear co-host /u/lunasaflowers, I will be the host of the 2010s Indie-Pop Debuts rate! All three of the albums in the rate are amazing in their own way and while being sonically similar, they are kinda different lyrical wise. Let's jump into the artist and album informations, which I totally didn’t steal from Wikipedia articles, and the tracklists!

##**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Me and luna decided to reduce the song count in the main rate to 40 and move the 17 deluxe edition/b-side songs to a bonus rate. Please check the tracklists of the albums below to see the changes. Thanks!

##If you sent your scores before, there is nothing you have to do unless you gave your 11 or 0 to a bonus track. In that case, you have to either change your 11/0 to a main rate song or just don't use it, it is completely up to you.

**For the people who read this before and want to send their ballots:**

## [*Lungs* - **Florence + the Machine**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/26/Florence_and_the_Machine_-_Lungs.png)

**Florence + the Machine** is a indie-rock/indie-pop group that consists of two main members, **Florence Leontine Mary Welch**, the vocalist of the group, and **Isabella Summers** who produces and co-writes some of the bands greatest songs. According to Welch, the band had started off as a private joke that got out of hand. She explained the name in an interview: “I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine, to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought 'Okay, I'll be Florence Robot/Isa Machine', before realizing that name was so long it'd drive me mad".

Florence + the Machine's debut album, **Lungs**, which we are going to rate, was released in 2009; on 17 January 2010, the album reached the top position in the UK after being on the chart for 28 consecutive weeks. **Lungs won the Brit Award for Best British Album in 2010.** 

Florence has been compared to other female singers such as *Kate Bush, Siouxsie Sioux, PJ Harvey, Shirley Manson, Alison Goldfrapp, Tori Amos and Björk*. Welch has a wide contralto voice range. When describing her debut album, Lungs, Welch said, **"When I was writing these songs, I used to refer to myself as Florence Robot... Because I really like what a machine thinks organic instruments really sound like."**

Prior to recording Lungs, Florence Welch had considered or attempted several different projects in the music industry, **including an interest in becoming a country singer**, recording folk songs she had written, and collaborating with Razorlight's guitarist Johnny Borrell, but ultimately she was unsatisfied with those endeavors. It was not until Welch began writing and recording with childhood friend Isabella Summers at her small independent workplace, Antenna Studios, in London that Welch crafted a sound she wanted to develop further. Prior to being signed by Island Records in November 2008, Welch recalled conversing with several session guitarists and drummers to help arrange **her preferred style, which she explained was "a wave of sound that would envelop, something that was soaring, slightly church-like and then-doom-like".**

The band elected to record a shorter rendition of "Kiss with a Fist" as their debut single. Welch, however, began expanding upon the crude punk style which influenced "Kiss with a Fist" by listening to more contemporary music, particularly Arcade Fire's first album Funeral. The influence of the recordings would manifest itself on the concept she had devised for Lungs, which, according to Welch, was a **"scrapbook of the past five years... it's about guilt, fear, love, death, violence, nightmares, [and] dreams"**. Ultimately, the majority of Welch's earlier self-penned compositions were rejected for the album, except "Kiss with a Fist" and "Between Two Lungs", because they did not mesh well with the album's themes. Fortunately for the group rehearsed and improvised some of the material in the relaxed setting of Summers' studio, allowing Welch to refine the tribal drumming back-dropping Lungs' tracks, most notably "Dog Days Are Over". Lungs was recorded in the United Kingdom with five different producers—**Paul Epworth(produced Adele’s Rolling In The Deep and many more great songs), James Ford, Stephen Mackey, Eg White and Charlie Hugall.** Most of the songs on the album were mixed by **Cenzo Townshend.**

A fun trivia: In 2007, Welch recorded with a band named Ashok, who released an album titled Plans on the Filthy Lucre/About Records label. **This album included the earliest version of her later hit "Kiss with a Fist", which at this point was titled "Happy Slap".**

##HOSTS THOUGHTS:

##/u/Leixander 

Lungs is an explosion of emotions. It is my favorite album of all time just because of that, Florence Welch conveys her emotions in such a way that you can't help but be allured and just listen to her with your mouth wide open in awe. At least that was my first reaction, I probably listened to one song from this album ten times (I won't mention that song before it gets eliminated in the rate, I am superstitious like that) before I could jump onto the other tracks and listen to this album in full. I hope you will love this album as much as I do! :)

##/u/lunasaflowers

Fun fact: I still haven't listened to Ceremonials or How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, so Lungs is basically my only real exposure to Florence + The Machine so far! Yeah, I need to get on that. Still, though, Lungs is such a magical, gorgeous album-- every song feels so rich in texture, I love the very orchestral and harp-heavy instrumentation, and Florence Welch has such a powerful, majestic voice. This album is such a gem, and I hope those of y'all doing this rate who haven't heard this before enjoy it as much as I do!


##NOTES:
The rate includes almost all the deluxe tracks available; **Dog Days Are Over's Demo,** **I'm Not Calling You A Liar's Demo** (called Ghosts in the album) and **Girl With One Eye's Percussion Version** are excluded to not make this rate even longer than it should.

*Dog Days Are Over - Alternate Video* is not available in USA. *cue eagle screech*

Also, we are rating the *Bird Song Intro* and the *Bird Song* as one song.

##[*The Family Jewels* - **Marina and The Diamonds**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/da/Marina_and_the_Diamonds_-_The_Family_Jewels.png)

**Marina Lambrini Diamandis**, known professionally as **Marina and the Diamonds**, is a Welsh singer-songwriter. Diamandis has described herself as an *"indie artist with pop goals"* and often analyses components of human behavior in her music. 

Obsessed with becoming a singer, "almost as if it was a disease", she worked at a petrol station for two months in order to earn money to move to London. Despite not having a musical background, Diamandis was able to create lyrics due to her childhood love of writing. She first began writing music when she was 18 years old; she moved to London to attend dance school, but quit two months later. She studied music at the University of East London and transferred to a classic composition course in Middlesex University the following year, but after two months she dropped out.

Knowing that the Spice Girls were formed by an advertisement in The Stage, Diamandis applied for auditions listed in that newspaper. She traveled for several unsuccessful auditions, including opportunities with the musical for The Lion King and a boy band organized by Virgin Records, during which she managed to leave her CV to an A&R Representative, but was unable to audition at the time of the appointment as she felt sick.**In 2005, she created the stage name "Marina and the Diamonds" after coming to prominence, "the Diamonds" was established as a reference to her fans, instead of her backing band.**

Inspired by the example of Daniel Johnston, Diamandis decided to compose her own music and stop going to auditions; she taught herself how to play the piano and recorded music on a keyboard. She self-composed and produced her earlier demos with GarageBand, and **independently released her debut extended play Mermaid vs. Sailor through Myspace in 2007**.

She held discussions with fourteen music labels, rejecting all but one as she believed it was the only one which would not dictate her image. She came to the attention of Neon Gold Records' Derek Davies in 2008, which managed her for six months, and was hired as the supporting act for Australian recording artist Gotye. In October, Diamandis finalized a recording contract with 679 Recordings (eventually renamed 679 Artists), a subdivision of Warner Music Group.

So why did I copy-paste all this info about Marina here? It is because her debut album, **The Family Jewels** has some songs where Marina sings about the problems she had while trying to be a singer. It was released on **15 February 2010** and includes collaborations with several producers including *Pascal Gabriel, Liam Howe, Greg Kurstin, Richard "Biff" Stannard, and Starsmith.* (Notice that five years passed since she chose her stage name and nearly three years passed since her MySpace album. She was also 24 years old when the album was released, which is not really a young age for a pop-indie act to release their debut album) Marina explained that the album is **"a body of work largely inspired by the seduction of commercialism, modern social values, family and female sexuality"**, intended to be **"enjoyed and consumed as a story and theory that encourages people to question themselves"**.

Diamandis claimed that she made producer Liam Howe **take 486 vocal takes for "The Outsider"**. "Hollywood" takes inspiration from Diamandis' previous obsession with American celebrity culture, while in "I Am Not a Robot", her favourite track from the album, she sings to tell herself to accept imperfection, with lines such as "you've been acting awful tough lately, smoking a lot of cigarettes lately ... don't be so pathetic"; she expected audiences to be able to relate to the song. "Numb" reflects on the dedication and sacrifice needed during her early years in London; "Oh No!" and "Are You Satisfied?" have similar lyrical themes. The album had initially been scheduled for release in October 2009, and was delayed by Diamandis' self-confessed perfectionism. 

##HOSTS THOUGHTS:

##/u/Leixander 

The Family Jewels hits close to home. Marina hits you with your own thoughts so much that you start to think, *is this woman reading my mind?* She sings about the bad effects of self-awareness, anxiety, bi-polar disorder... This made the album look really moody I know but the songs are actually mostly upbeat! "And it's my problem if I have no friends and feel I want to die."  she sings in *Are You Satisfied?*, you can feel her voice shaking as she says those words while the upbeat instrumentals play in the back. I could quote much more lyrics from this absolute jewel of an album, but we want you to listen to it and experience it yourself! :)

##/u/lunasaflowers

This album, oh my god. This album is that bitch for me. The Family Jewels is a top 5 album of all-time for me-- probably always will be-- and I simply can't overstate the sheer impact this album has had on me as a music consumer. Discovering Oh No! via the autoplay of a Dangan Ronpa roleplay blog on tumblr in the summer of 2013 basically changed my life, and there was a period in late '13-early '14 that I would listen to either this or Electra Heart every Friday when I got home. I love everything about this album, from Marina's quirky vocal inflections to the crisp production (that still sounds great going-on 8 years later!) and the sharp, relatable, classically tumblrcore in the best possible way lyrics. I asked to be a part of this rate basically so I could watch y'all slaughter me as you do this album dirty, and I love it. (also give Simplify your 11s or I'll get the mods to kill this sub /s)

## [*Vows* - **Kimbra**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a9/Vows_by_Kimbra.png)

**Kimbra Lee Johnson** is a New Zealand singer and actress who mixes pop with classic R&B, jazz and rock musical elements. Her musical influences range from *Prince and Minnie Riperton, to Björk and Jeff Buckley.*

At the age of 10, Kimbra began writing songs. When she was 12, her father bought her a guitar and after a few years of lessons, she was on stage, performing with her guitar tutors. She sang the New Zealand national anthem before 27,000 people at the 2002 NPC rugby union final. In 2007, after winning the Juice TV award for Best Breakthrough music video for her single "Simply on My Lips", she came to the attention of ex-Independiente Records boss Mark Richardson (Jamiroquai, Paula Abdul) and his newly formed management company and independent label Forum 5 in Melbourne, Victoria. She signed with Richardson and in 2008 she moved to Melbourne, Australia.

Kimbra’s debut album, **Vows** was recorded between 2008 and 2011 and was released on **29 August 2011** in New Zealand, and on 2 September in Australia by Warner Bros. Records. Vows has spawned 3 charting singles, "Settle Down", "Cameo Lover" and "Good Intent".

Vows charted at #3 on the RIANZ Albums Chart in its first week after release, with "Settle Down" re-entering the singles chart at #37. In Australia, the album debuted at #5 on the ARIA Albums Chart, later peaking at #4. Vows has been certified **Platinum** in Australia for shipment of 70,000 units and **Platinum** in New Zealand for sales of 15,000 units.

**On 4 May 2012, the album was re-released with six new songs**, new mixing and was mastered by Colin Leonard in Atlanta, US. It was released in Australia as Vows: Australian Tour Edition to coincide with her winter 2012 tour and included 6 previously unreleased songs. **This edition of the album was released in New Zealand on 11 May 2012 as Vows: Deluxe Edition, which includes every song from this era and is the edition we are going to rate.**

##HOSTS THOUGHTS:

##/u/Leixander 

Probably the most up-tempo album of the three, Vows is also rich in emotions but with a quirky twist. Some lyrics on the album are so heart-felt, so pure that you would hug them if you could. This may sound funny, but once you listen you'll see why. Kimbra also has a great unique voice that may sound happy/cheerful at first, but as it can be heard on the end of Cameo Lover and almost all of The Build-Up and Plain Gold Ring's live version, it can be quite somber too. If you like this album, be sure to check out her new singles and her second album Golden Echo! Her third album, Primal Heart will be released in April too! ^(hopefully)

##/u/lunasaflowers

Vows is an interesting album for me! The first time I heard Settle Down, let me tell you, I was shook. I'd known of Kimbra mostly, like everyone else, from her feature on Somebody That I Used To Know (which is wonderful, FTR), but this was my first time hearing a solo joint from her, and I was absolutely mesmerised. It might legitimately be one of my favourite songs ever, NGL, so it's only fitting that it's the song that kicks off this album! As for the rest of Vows, it has a lot of highlights, with Kimbra having such a bewitching presence even on record and old-school-inspired instrumentals that don't feel derivative. It's a lovely debut record! (Also, if you have time, look at some of Kimbra's live performances on YouTube-- she's fantastic, and it's where she shines IMO.)

#**The Rules**

***obligatory we totally didn't steal this from other rate post***

- We will be enforcing a minimum average for this rate. If your average for any given album is below a certain threshold, we won't accept your scores and you'll have to resend them. **It's a reasonable minimum, so just rate sensibly and you'll be fine.** We will come down on you if we think you're intentionally trying to sabotage the results and not just rating songs based on how well you like them. You're allowed to dislike an album, but there's a point of reasonableness.

- Listen to **each song in the main rate** and assign each a score between **1 and 10**. Decimals are fine, but please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two decimal spots: **giving a 4.3 is okay, but giving a 4.33 is not,** it will crash the program.

- Yes, you have to listen to every song. We will not accept your ballot if you have a score missing.

- Your scores should **NOT** be considered confidential.

- You may give **ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11 IN THE MAIN RATE.** This is ONE song total, NOT ONE SONG PER ALBUM. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; **excessive sabotage ruins rate results**. Please don't give out 0's and 11's just because, **they are optional.**

- You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM us again afterwards.

- To make things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on our part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. **The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to use the pre-prepared link that we have put all over this post**, such as right [here]
 (https://tinyurl.com/ya3v4b8k). PLEASE USE THAT. You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE use that format to send in you scores.

- If you don't follow the format, We'll still accept your ballot, but **we reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions.**

- If you want to attach a comment to a specific song, write it right after your score. **Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space.**

- **If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there.** Like this:

> Album: Lungs: she does have lungs huh

- **DO NOT change the submission ballot it just messes everything up.** 

- If, after submitting your scores, you change your mind about a certain song please feel free to message us about changing scores and we will be happy to oblige.

**This is the ONE AND ONLY correct format:**
>Obsessions: 10 fuck supermarkets and the damn crackers

**These are INCORRECT, in fact, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:**
>Numb: 1: I can't slut-drop to this.

>Posse: Doves In The Wind's ironic daddy! 1

>Dog Days Are Over: Why is my fave always underrated and flopping, I am giving this successful song a 1 to relieve my pain

>Howl: 1-What is this Twilight shit

>Wandering Limbs: 1 (Cheek To Cheek knock-off, goodbye)
