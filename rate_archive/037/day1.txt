(Leix) It is a short and good cover in my opinion! Also the only song in the rate without a 10, which is a... big feat?
(Luna) We love a queen of cover songs! This is solid IMO, but I understand why it wasn't super popular.


---
**m4ttycool** (8): too short

**Marshynarsh** (8): Florence manages to do a lot of amazing covers, including this one!

**specfagular** (8): JOY AND MISERY AND JOY AND MISERY AND JOY AND MISERY AND JOY AND JOY AND JOY AND JOY AND JOY

**kinglet22** (7.5): great cover, stays true to the Cold War Kids version

**RandomRocketKat** (7.5): BRING YUR NECES AND YUR CUZINS

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Florence + The Saline

**vayyiqra** (6): boring and too short

**awryj** (5): tbh I prefer the original

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (4): I don't even remember what this sounds like

**whatareblackhole** (1): This sounds like someone's bad first song they ever wrote. I'm glad she got better!

(Leix) Surprising almost no-one, Girls is last! I love the funny vibe of this song and considering even Marina is kinda ashamed of this song I say we shouldn't really take it seriously and just wag our tails to the beat. Chipsi has an explanation (essay?) for both their score and the song itself so without further ado…

(Luna) Our first song out is from The Family Jewels, because you all like to hurt me. :emofish: I like the song, and I don't think it's meant to be super serious, but it does have a bit of that 2000s non-woke Not Like The Other Girls-ness to it a bit, so I understand its controversial reputation. Still a bop, though!

---
## the essay :deadbanana:

**chipsi1** (10): okay this song is not a 10 but i'm incapable of giving any song on this album anything under a 10 i'm sorry

Anyways, this song is pretty controversial inside the Marina fandom. It's obvious an attempt was made her to mock girl on girl fights but it was poorly executed, because it kinda paints Marina in a dumb and "i'm not like the other girls!1!!1!!11"-esque light instead.

But, what saves this song from behind this major block in the flow of the record is Marina's vocal delivery and the sonic aspect of the song. Marina's sassy delivery in the chorus ("ALL THE CALORIES THEY EAT") and in the verses ("You stick to your yogurt i'll stick to my apple pies") makes this song a blast to listen to and is honestly really entertaining, while the instrumental and the effects sound really evil and they honestly really fit the mood of the song.

Tbh, most people i've talked to about this song say that they thought it's a really dumb song and that Marina's the type of girl that listens to Pink Floyd and buys Katy Perry posters just to rip them up with a knife, which is exactly the type of behavior Marina was trying to mock. Mission accomplished, I guess?

## Wag Your Tails To The Beat!

**fourchip** (10): queen of internalised misogyny

**kappyko** (10): all the caloRIES THEY EAT!

**izeasklapaucius** (8.5): I get the both sides about the lyrics, but to me it's a wee bit misogynistic. Still slaps tho so no worries.

**m4ttycool** (8.5): So weird I love it

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): tongue in cheek and super fun

**banananaise** (8): lmao marina is such an indie white girl and i love her

**InfernalSolstice** (8): a huge problematic bop

**Raykel** (7.5): It's hard to find a song that compliments her voice, but once it's found it's really unique.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Did Tim Burton produce this? This is pretty swell.

## [That's a good jewel!](https://serendipitycrystals.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/sugilite.jpg)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Type of Jewel: Sugilite

## What happened to the dream of a girl president?

**SkyBlade79** (7): I get it’s a character but this gets obnoxious

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): This is a bop, albeit quite problematic and Marina seems to be aware of it. This song had potenital but its message did not age well.

**Mudkip1** (6): yeah see i just don't appreciate her voice in these songs it's just not for me

**whatareblackhole** (6): A healthy dose of 2010 internalized misogyny!

## She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent!

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): This song is a bit problematic

**vayyiqra** (5): awful lyrics wtf, very annoying song

## They travel in packs of two or three...

**Marshynarsh** (4): This song comes off a little bit 'I'm not like other girls' Even Marina has talked about disliking the lyrics

**twat\_brained** (4): Hooray for internalized misogyny! /s It doesn't help that the song sounds really annoying, either.

## With their itsy-bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees!

**CarlieScion** (3): I hate when women go into "I'm not like other girls"-territory even if you can argue it's slightly ironic

**kinglet22** (2): all I say is no no no no no

**Lowest Scores:** (0 x2) awryj, kappyko (2 x1) letsallpoo

(Leix) This is definitely one of the weirdest songs in the rate; it is about Marina dreaming about killing the family dog, which is technicolor somehow, and feeling really guilty about it afterwards. She blames herself and her sadness from a lack of father figure, since her father left her in the age of four. In the bridge she also says this dream haunts her even now. I can kind of relate since I had a bad nightmare when I was little and still remember how it made me scared that day.

(Luna) Yeah, killing a dog in your dream is an odd subject choice for a song, but honestly I appreciate it! The bridge is especially great, and I wish it got more appreciation.

---

## Sue ha immediately Katy!

**chipsi1** (10): I killed a dog just to try it, I hope my cat don't mind it

## 911, there is an emergency

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): queen of animal cruelty

**RandomRocketKat** (8): call PETA on this bitch

**m4ttycool** (7.5): queen of hiding parts of dogs she murdered in a dream

**fourchip** (6.5): this is about some dream she had where she killed a bunch of dogs? Is she ok

## IWASJUSTAKIDTHATYOUCOULDNOTFORGIVEBECAUSEITSHARDER

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): some of the most interesting production on the album, and the menacing vibe of her delivery with the lyrics is outstanding

**BiPolarBear17** (9.5): Tbh the lyrics are pretty gibberishy at times but it's easy to let that slide when it has an instrumental as fantastic as that.

**vayyiqra** (9): also relatable and catchy af bop

**izeasklapaucius** (8.5): Unique storytelling. The story itself is kinda weird tho.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): I forget what she's "guilty" of but it still sounds great.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Why can't they do more rock songs like this?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Type of Jewel: Yellow Diamond

## IWASJUSTAKIDANDALLIREALLYWANTEDWASMYFATHER

**CarlieScion** (4): This track reminded me that I don't like her voice lol

**whatareblackhole** (4): I don't like how this one sounds at all. My definite least favorite. And hella daddy issues, so it's too close (even though I love Seventeen).

**kappyko** (0): the beat sounds dated but upbeat. unfortunately ms diamond decides to do some weird shit. the ahhh-ahhh is a hint of the fun this song could have been and it kinda pisses me off

## Well hello there Marina!

(Leix) I like this song a lot! Especially the part where she goes *OOOHHH OOO HO OOOHH OOO HO HOME IS HEREEE* But sadly, it is kinda similar to the other and more successfully executed songs on the album and feels like a filler somehow. Also check the score and average difference between this and Guilty.

(Luna) The first Kimbra song is out! This isn't a bad song, but TBH I think it tends to wash over me a bit because of the presence of stronger songs on the back half of Vows, so it doesn't stand out a lot in comparison.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3ndBfdOu50

## Wholesome and amazing just like most of this album!

**Mudkip1** (10): love love love this one and all the harmonies and the other music vocabulary terms that apply

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): this song always felt like walking in a funhouse but instead of weird mirrors its slightly distorted pictures of my youth and family, but in a good way. kinda helps ground me and evaluate where i am in life and how i got here, and also appreciate that my home is still so full of love.

**kappyko** (9): really gorgeous. kinda like this cute bop near the end, like we're on our way home after this journey with the ms. kimbra lee johnson

**twat\_brained** (8.2): This song, like much of the album, sounds quite good but is unfortunately rather forgettable.

**CarlieScion** (8): The harmonies are so good, this could've been on Lungs

**HoodooMooJuice** (7): I love the sampling though

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): Good enough.

## Filler

**vayyiqra** (7): nice but doesn't stand out to me

**whatareblackhole** (7): Eh, kinda filler, too far down on the tracklist.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Well done but doesn't stand out among the other tracks

**SkyBlade79** (3): why does this sound so familiar

## Limbra disagrees

**fourchip** (6.5): kindbra is bad

(Leix) You thought Hermit The Frog is weird? Well hop on the backseat baby, as Marina is going to show you some emo-tinged rock in this song! It is a really weird B-Side for a song like Mowgli's Road, but still not a bad cover!

(Luna) For those unfamiliar, this is a cover of a song by Late Of The Pier, a British dancepunk band! Marina released this in 2009 as a throwaway iTunes track, and it's certainly an interesting addition to the treasure trove of Marina's non-album deep cuts, because...Marina? Doing rock? It's an odd one, but hey, it's definitely interesting!

## Marina and The Emo

**chipsi1** (10): a rockstar

**awryj** (8.8): that was unexpected

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I nothing to say about this one. It's just awesome

**rotating3Dtext** (5.5): what is she doing with her voice

**whatareblackhole** (5): I don't like this song in the first place, but Marina's cover is too much. Of the three covers we've rated, this one is the worst.

(Leix) The song I expected to be the last when I first thought of this rate idea, so I am happy that it performed a bit better. The Build-Up is amazing in every aspect for me, can you find me any other song who lives up to its title as much as this one? You can't. It builds up to an amazing outro, where the beautiful piano tune and Kimbra's almost silent vocals merge into infinite... I really love the lyrics in this as well and I hope the heathens who gave a score lower than 6 to this see the light some day thank you.

(Luna) This song is of an acquired taste-- from what I can tell, people either love it or don't. Unfortunately, I lean more towards the latter-- I get what it's going for, but I guess it's not really my thing. Also, I think it goes on a little long. (Sorry, Leix!)

## Wait a minute this is too deep

**banananaise** (10): this song makes me feel like i'm in a dark apartment in london looking out at the city lights from my bed and thinking about the man i left behind and lost forever

## TIL

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI8hivxziM0

## Ethereal

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): SHOOT I WASNT GONNA CRY HERE!

**izeasklapaucius** (10): This should be boring but she keeps it great with poetic lyrics, uncommon structures and unconventional, minimalistic production.

**kappyko** (9.5): i love the lyrics, suitable outro. reminds me of nico's *desertshore* record, check it out when you can.

**CarlieScion** (9): This song is so soft, but it's also slightly too long

**specfagular** (9): GOD is this such a mood sometimes. Heartbreaking and you can hear every bit of emotion in her voice

**whatareblackhole** (9): I think this song is so cool and I like the album's storyline ending with this. Really beautiful lyrics.

**kinglet22** (8.1): beautiful closer

**Mudkip1** (8): a bit slow but still pretty

**vayyiqra** (8): pretty, reminds me of Bjork

**deadspiderwall** (7.5): kinda creepy, I like it

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Probably wouldn't work as a single but great after some heavy songs on the album

**twat\_brained** (6.8): Getting major Bjork vibes here but still feels kinda fillery. EDIT: I had no idea there was an outro on top of that. I should really check the time on my Spotify player before I pause.

## Strangeness and Charm?

**SkyBlade79** (7): the fact that this song KNOWS that it’s just a buildup to nothing makes me mad and impressed at the same time

## Sorry you won't fit inside my heart...

**RandomRocketKat** (5.5): why is this sad shit here out of nowhere

**Kaylaboe** (5): at least this builds up to warrior

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): im so fucking bored

## You are... welcome?

(Leix) The cover that turned me into a mega fan! This is actually a Nina Simone song way back from 1958. The moment I heard Kimbra's screams filled with all the sadness and anger she felt when she saw that plain gold ring on her crush's hand is just irreplacable for me. This song was doing well until it got two zeroes near the end of the rating period, but overall I am happy with the mostly positive reception it got.

(Luna) Okay, y'all ROBBED this song with a capital R. Y'all robbed this song at the side of a country road at gunpoint, took all its possessions, and then proceeded to leave it dead in a ditch. Rate cancelled. (/s) But anyway, I think where Kimbra really shines is in her live performances-- she's SUCH a unique performer, and I love the way she experiments with songs when she performs them. This song emphasises a lot of my favourite aspects of Kimbra, and IMO is better than the non-live version, though it's a good cover either way, really. It deserved better!

## Talent

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): slaying ur faves with a live performance! seeing her loop her vocals in person is such a treat

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Diggin the rock'n'roll vibe on this. My eyes widen when the beat breaks. It's THAT good.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): she served vocals love it

**whatareblackhole** (10): Still has my wig hostage however-many-years later. Pure vocal talent.

**banananaise** (9): her little hand movements in the video for this are the most extra thing ever. it's okay though because you can see that the amount of effort going into her music is insane

**kinglet22** (8): if this whole album had this much soul/energy it would be a whole lot better

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): she’s basically Katy Perry who can sing on a live performance

**sandwichsparrow** (8): those notes at the end!!! was going to give a 7 but that pushed it up to an 8.

**HoodooMooJuice** (7.5): I love how the harmony transitions from the background vocals to the guitar in the beginning

**Raykel** (7.5): Sneaky yet sexy yet classy. Omg yes scat hoe!

**vayyiqra** (7): drama bomb, so extra

**Mudkip1** (8): it's cool that it's live but this is the point in the album where it starts to drag

**m4ttycool** (8): It's interesting that it's live, but why?

**fourchip** (7): having a live version instead of a studio version on ur debut is a choice

**CarlieScion** (6): I don't normally enjoy live songs on albums, but this doesn't really sound live

## Something is missing...

**twat\_brained** (8): There's just something about it that doesn't have the same quality as the other songs do. I want to say it's the lacklustre instrumentation, but I don't even know if that's 100% the case. I'm not even sure I can properly pinpoint it, but there's just an element to it that holds it back from perfection.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): I want to like this but there's something missing that I can't quite put my finger on

## Mess!

**SkyBlade79** (3): snooze

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): I just don't like how she sounds in this at all :emofish:

**Elitefourbrad** (0): what the hell is this mess

**InfernalSolstice** (0): her vocals are all over the place and it ruins the song and it gave me a headache

(Leix) My least favorite song from the album, Rootless is about feeling like you don't or can't belong to somewhere. She wants to live in a place where she is loved and accepted but she gets rejected every time she tries. Even though I love the lyrics this song fall flat musically. The instrumentals and the production are not interesting at all to me.

(Luna) The Family Jewels is one of my top 5 albums of all time, but I'd say out of all the songs, Rootless is probably the least essential of them, at least for me, and thus it's probably the most filler-y song here. The production lets it down, I think. I still have some love for it though, so still sad to see it go.

## Wigless

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Loooove this.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): the baroque vibes in this song are fucking NUTS and i love it

**izeasklapaucius** (9): Epic.

**m4ttycool** (9): aaaaaaaaaah

**Mudkip1** (9): i like how different her voice sounds on this it's something interesting for once

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Oh wow, I haven't heard this one before. This is pretty good!

**vayyiqra** (8): this is so dramatic fuck

**twat\_brained** (7.6): At some point I keep hearing "I'm new to this" instead of "I'm rootless"

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): i've got no roots for my home

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Type of Jewel: Topaz

**whatareblackhole** (7): Kind of thank mr. banky, kind of brilliant, really sad, extremely visceral…this song evokes a lot of visuals and feelings.

## Wig Fully Intact

**kappyko** (6): stream alice merton's "no roots" today. forgot i was listening to this

**kinglet22** (4.7): all these songs start off good enough but just don't keep me entertained

(Leix) I absolutely adore this song and I feel attacked right now!!! The demo-vibe of this and the simple instruments in the background is just lovely, lyrics don't seem complete but still amazing. I really, really love the part where she goes "They say get out of the city, but there is no such thing as a house in the country".

(Luna) This song is a top 5 favourite Marina song for me. Maybe even my favourite MATD song, though it fights fiercely with Oh No! and Bad Kidz (the B-side to Hollywood's single release, please listen to it) for that title. It is indeed (heh) a very simple song, but it's so peaceful and calming and very, very underrated. It's subtle, but I love it a lot still. (#whydidyouallrobthis)

(Leix) One of my favorite songs from Lungs, My Boy Builds Coffins is about... Florence's ex-boyfriend being a coffin builder. Yes. I love how she took this thing about him and made such a gorgeous song. Her vocals are amazing as always here, especially in the chorus where she screams "FOR YOU".

(Luna) I'm not surprised this song's out today, since it's kind of an oddball, but I think that's part of its charm. It feels like a Brothers Grimm folk tale, and I feel F+ATM are at their best when they capitalise on Florence's witchy, gothic vibes. (Also, Florence/Hozier collab when?)

---

## A Medieval Queen

**nikitasd** (10): mfw I thought this was some deep metaphor about Florence's relationships. But no, her boyfriend literally built coffins.

**kappyko** (9.5): I love the guitar part on this very folksy

**awryj** (9): this is one of these songs that I'd usually call s0 3dgy and laugh off but she actually pulls it off, the absolute madwoman! kudos, flo, kudos

**izeasklapaucius** (9): The lyrics are kinda deep and interesting.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): Underrated and a great little song that happens to be one of my favorites on the album. The lyrics are so good and show how Florence can craft a compelling song from pretty much anything.

**banananaise** (8.5): this song has stuck with me since the album was released. such a strong and evocative narrative, like a medieval tale

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.4): queen of folk-vibes

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Florence + The Poutine

**whatareblackhole** (8): This is a good one for a rainy day.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): instrumentally is good, the lyrics haunt me

**RandomRocketKat** (7.5): My Queen makes bops

## 2Edgy4Me

**twat\_brained** (7.2): This one kinda feels like a step down from the others. It helps that it's short, though.

**vayyiqra** (7): we get it, you're goth

**Raykel** (6.5): It was nice but dragged out a bit.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): What a morbid fairytale.

**m4ttycool** (6): I want a coffin now

(Leix) This was actually my least Marina song for a while, until it finally clicked. The intro was so jarring to me at first, I would just skip it without listening much. But I left it on by mistake while listening to the album a while ago and I fell in love with how whimsical and quirky this is. A really good indie-pop song that deserved better in this rate in my opinion. 

(Luna) I adore this song! A lot of people really don't like TFJ-era Marina's odd vocal inflections, but I loooooove them. The instrumentals on this track are some of the best on the album, and this song has so much Marina-brand personality, I'm sad it didn't rank higher. DIDJA FIND YOUR BITCH IN MEEEEEEEE

---

## Marina and The Devil : On Theaters in 2048 With Her Next Album

**chipsi1** (10): This used to be my favorite song on the album when I first started listening to it and I still find it fucking amazing how clever the lyrics to this are. Between the very iconic Did you find your bitch in me line and a lot of other lines (the double bed one is another great standout), Marina flexes her lyrical skills here and the outcome is honestly great.

It's honestly kinda lost on me what the song is about, but I think it's about her first relationship which was probably not too good. A connection can be made between this song and Seventeen, seeing how Marina basically points out the double standards within that relationship which could mean that she's referring to the same relationship in the "the rise of a king and the fall of a queen" line in Seventeen.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This song is super theatrical as fuck and I love it.

**fourchip** (10): when marina said “they call him hermit the frog, he’s looking for a dog” i felt that

**SkyBlade79** (10): the influences on this song are amazing

**twat\_brained** (10): Okay, this second half of the album is really good compared to the first! I can't remember another album I heard where this was the case.

**izeasklapaucius** (9.5): Interesting lyrics.

**m4ttycool** (9): I love the devil

(Leix) A good album cut, Old Flame is one of the outliers in the album in terms of sound. I like it well enough, but kinda wish that it was shorter, outro is unnecessary and goofy. Also not a fan of the "na-na-na" parts near the end, which I think almost destroys the serious vibe of this song until the piano rushes in to save it.

(Luna) One of the slower songs here! I used to not like this much, and while I still don't LOVE it, per se, I've warmed up to it in subsequent relistens.

---

## Can you feel it burning, still?

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): gorgeously haunting and a great use of her lower register

**kappyko** (10): absolutely fucking mesmerizing holy shit this better make at least day 2 **(Leix's note: oops)**

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I love how this transitions to "Good Intent"

**Mudkip1** (9.9): i'm just in a good mood rn i deducted some because a good time to end the song was about 3 mins 10 seconds in

**twat\_brained** (8.2): It's really clever how this is led into from Two Way Street. That whole "sleeping downstairs" is not necessary and reminds me too much of SZA's "bright ideas" she felt she HAD to let us know about on "The Weekend".

**deadspiderwall** (8): ooh, I really like this one

**skargardin** (8): The outro raised this score by miles.

**fourchip** (7): s, can’t hold a caaaayyyndle to youuuuuuuuu

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Sounds like the theme tune for a teen mystery/drama series

**SkyBlade79** (6): this is so nice and atmospheric. End is kind of trash tho

## Burned out.

**awryj** (7): Very chill but not memorable

**whatareblackhole** (6): I always skip this one when I listen to the album. I'm just not the biggest fan of it.

**Kaylaboe** (5.5): this flame has already been extinguished

**specfagular** (4): don't drag me but this is kinda boring.

(Leix) A song in Florence + the Machine's debut EP; *A Lot Of Love, A Lot Of Blood*, AYHTOYL is a nice song in my opinion, even though it is not mastered well. I like to think that this was recorded in a kitchen, with all the clanking sounds in the background.

(Luna) This song is unusual in F+ATM's discography in that it's playing for a more lowkey vibe and delivery, rather than Florence's powerful belting. It's not everyone's bag, but I like it a lot.

(Leix) I really love the chorus of this one, but I must say I never bothered to check the lyrics before this rate. Sometimes if a song is just nice to me I don't do that. 

(Luna) Fun fact: this song and the song above it are tied! This song sounds great, I love its atmosphere, and it’s one of the best songs on the back half of the album for me.

**whatareblackhole** (10): OMG I show this song to everybody and put it on playlists constantly, I love love love this song.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): underrated bop with some really fun production. the little drum fills and sliding strings are details i think most people miss on their first listen, and then of course her backing vocals in the chorus are gorg as always

**kinglet22** (9.2): such a fun, soulful song, good production too

**awryj** (9): I've got a feeling that this song is going to be robbed HARD, but it grew on me so much I can't give it anything less than a 9.

(Leix) And the first 11 out is... mine of course! Girl With One Eye is my favorite song from Florence, you can feel the ANGER when she screams in the chorus, the breath she takes after that long note is such a nice touch and it always gives me goosebumps. Also, this is actually a cover from her old boyfriend's band The Ludes, and was performed by Florence as early as 2008! 

(Luna) The other half of our tie! Leix has good taste, because this song is fucking phenomenal and I remember going through a period where I was totally obsessed with it. I love how Florence plays the villain on this song and the way it ramps up in intensity and rage is AMAZING.

**Lowest Scores:** (4 x2) Discord\_and\_Dine, Mudkip1 (5 x3) CreepyMannequin, kinglet22, mokitsu 

---

(Leix) A song about social anxiety, this song is about deciding to be the outsider. Marina realizes she isn't like the people in the social circle she is in, she doesn't know what to say to them because she has nothing in common with them. She is afraid that she is going to be excluded if she tries to join so she just decides to be on her own, again. I personally love the sudden WILDCARD line, which wasn't liked by some for being kinda bizarre.

(Luna) Wow, relatable queen! Some songs on The Family Jewels took more than one listen for me to come to fully appreciate, but The Outsider was pretty instantaneously awesome for me. I love the FUCKING WIIILDCAAARD bit so much, it's SO Classic Marina.

---

## Hop into the backseat baby, I'll show you some fun...

**chipsi1** (10): This song is honestly one of the many songs on the album but perhaps one of the most prominent cases of Marina carrying a song with mostly her personality and additude, you can feel the distress in her voice and it makes the song extremely believable and I think you'll be able to relate to her distress even if you haven't gone through that type of situation. Another thing I adore about this song is how it differentiates itself from the other songs about being the outsider by acknowledging that she is the one making the choice to be the outsider.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): A bop with a dark lyrics.

**skargardin** (9): It’s like she’s singing straight to me, WHY AM I CRYING.

**SkyBlade79** (9): a bop even with some bad lyrics

**whatareblackhole** (9): Oooh, I always skipped this one, but I actually really like it. I like the beat.

**CarlieScion** (8): omg is this the song that inspired all those "you know my name, not my story"-cringe posts?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Type of Jewel: Rose Quartz

## I don't wanna be a stupid girl?..

**fourchip** (8): she’s not like other girls

## CUZ I'M A FUCKIN' WILD CARD

**m4ttycool** (8): I can really relate to this song. Also, FUCKING WILD CARD

**twat\_brained** (9.2): Was kinda enjoying this until Marina felt the need to yowl "wildcard". Still holds up really well against most of the album, though. Without that it'd be a 10.

(Leix) When she skips some of the lyrics in the second verse, I feel that right in my heart. There are some people in the world you love so much, care so much and in return only hear lies from them. You do things for their well being and they just snicker at you. You try to confront them about it, but the fear of losing them is just so overwhelming that when you try to talk you start to skip words and... Everything just ends up being the same.

(Luna) Florence Welch is a powerhouse singer, but the baroque pop instrumentation of this song gives it a gentle, vulnerable feeling. Lungs is a great album, and it has so many strong songs just in its first half.

(Leix) Queen of not putting the title song in the album! The Family Jewels is a nice song about her issues with her family, but I feel like it misses some magic and as a result I think it was a good choice that it wasn't on the normal version of the album.

(Luna) I used to listen to TFJ via a full album video on YouTube which had both this song and Seventeen in it, so for me they are vital parts of the album. Going by her songs (especially lesser-known early ones), Marina has a complex relationship with her father, and this is one of the songs on that subject. I love the lyrics of this one and it deserved better!

(Leix) Marina's relations with her father was definitely not the best. He left her at the age of 4, and when he came back again he didn't treat her well. Complaining about her upbringing while being one of the reasons of her troubles is funny and sad at the same time isn't it?

(Luna) Like the dancing queen! This song has that dramatic early-Marina feel to it, which is not for everyone, but I've always loved it personally. "Seventeen, the rise of a king and the fall of a queen" is a top Marina lyric for me. Kinda sad this didn't make it to #17 just for the meme TBH. (Also, fun fact: Marina's first music video was for this song; it's not on her VEVO page but you can find it pretty easily.)

## Lucky for you... I got all these daddy issues!

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (11): PERFECT CLOSER, also queen of DIY videos

**chipsi1** (10): oh she was PISSED.

This song is IMO the third best song on the album, and the greatest thing about it is how :angery:

Marina was while writing this, and it's also triumphant in a sense, Marina finally confronts the root of the problem, which is her dad. And by confronting I mean obliterating him with words, shooting him with an uzi loaded with good lyrics and basically making a diss track with emotional and confrontational lyrics, and also giving us the iconic line You don't know fuck about my family.

This is such a great fuck you anthem and at the very end of it, there's this hint of progress, there's this feeling like something was resolved. Marina finally acknowledges that she shouldn't "just put up" with everything that's troubling her ("I used to kid myself in this dress that that's how things were meant to be" implies that Marina no longer thinks her situation is normal and healthy) and that it's time to resolve it.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): homewrecker is shook

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): As someone who has some daddy issues, this song resonated with me.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): This has a "vibe" to it. I love the thumping piano riff.

**RandomRocketKat** (8): lemon sucked dry

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Type of Jewel: Malachite

**vayyiqra** (8): idk what it is about her and being a teenager but I like it

**whatareblackhole** (8): I love the passion in this one! Marina has one of the most emotive voices in the game.

**awryj** (7): they only want you when youre seventeen

## Bonus song blues...

**m4ttycool** (9): The Family Jewels should be here

## r/madlads

**specfagular** (8.5): I blasted this on my 17th birthday because I'm THAT BITCH

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7.1): hehe

## Alessia outsold?

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Alessia remains unbothered

## Lyrical depth of a lemon sucked dry

**kappyko** (6.5): who the fuck says Insy Winsy Spider girl

**banananaise** (6): if this is not the first song out i will be mad

**CarlieScion** (5): Not a good enough song to be a closer

(Leix) A hidden bonus track that I didn't know of before this rate! It is cute and kinda dark for a Kimbra song.

(Luna) A weird little secret track. It's not really my thing but Kimbra's huskier voice here is definitely unique.

---

## Somebody please hear this song...

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): uncharacteristically morbid lyrics, but it works!

**m4ttycool** (9): So this is a hidden track... cool (but short)

**whatareblackhole** (9): I looooove Kimbra's musical references and interests. The fact that this was a little hidden track is amazing. She's such a star!

**banananaise** (8.5): this is a funeral dirge and i am living for it

**awryj** (8): She almost doesn't sound like herself here

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIylSE3LnhY

**RandomRocketKat** (6.5): She heard "Strange Fruit" and decided to do this

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Could have done without it but I don't regret listening to it

## Actually don't

**vayyiqra** (6): too short, weird, pointless

**fourchip** (5.5): wow… she was not wrong in cutting these bonus trax

(Leix) Wow T-Swizzle better watch your squad! Kimbra targets the "cool kids" of her teen years here, says that even though she doesn't despise them she is not like them at all and doesn't want to change just to be in that social circle. I find this song really cute, even though I am embarrassed to admit I still giggle like a primary school kid when she says the word Posse. Also I learned the meaning of this word thanks to her, educational queen!

(Luna) A bop! A tune! Deserved to be a single! This song is so sassy and larger than life, it's easily one of the best songs from Vows, and one of my personal favourites for sure.

## The people who don't skip school and find "Dammit" heavy enough

**SkyBlade79** (11): this is the definition of a great dark pop song, that bass is amazing. Outro is so good too… can’t even tell it’s 5 minutes. Definitely the best song on the rate

**vayyiqra** (11): iconic, her best song, hipsters are cancelled

**BiPolarBear17** (10): She snapped! tbh It's pretty dang refreshing to hear a song that actually promos buckling down in school and being a decent kid, instead of the alternative we hear so often of skipping school to go get smashed and party.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): Yas Kimbra drag Tay HARD

**kappyko** (10): that heavy beat god damn i love this OMG THAT OUTRO BEAT FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK

**m4ttycool** (10): I don't wanna be, be in your posse girl

**Mudkip1** (10): BE IN YOUR POSS SEE GIARL. i love how this songs plays a slower version of Settle Down at the end

**RandomRocketKat** (10): omg the bass my poor headphones are shaking

**specfagular** (10): drag them

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): kimbra brings the 5 minute bangers!

**awryj** (9): Tennis Court? I don't know her :)

**DraculaWeekend** (9): Damn this goes hard

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBPpy_SVV_0

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Pass me the tuna cuz this is catty af can I get a glass of water over here

**whatareblackhole** (8): Putting this after Sally I Can See You was kind of unfair lol

**CarlieScion** (7): I like the beat in this song, but it's sooo long

## CUZ I AM NOT LIKE MOST GIIRLS

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): is it a bit "i'm not like other girls?" yes. do i give a fuck? no! it's a good song and tbh i've always interpreted it as more like "hey you're not a bad person but you're not really on my wavelength so you do you and i'll do me"

**banananaise** (8): this is the second "i'm not like the other girls" song in this rate lmao

**twat\_brained** (0): I see a lot of the same issues in this as there are on Girls, and the callback to "Settle Down" just seems lazy to me. I didn't think I'd be giving a 0 in this rate but what do you know?

## The Posse Member
