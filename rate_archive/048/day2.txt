**Shipsinker44** (8): Oh, my god, i did it again (a little mix song that deserved more in its own rate). This was originslly the main focus of Camila’s double single release and im vey happy with the outcome that we got but i wonder what Camila wouldve been like if OMG was the lead single instead of Havana

---
**cyborglilith** (10): actually I prefer All These Years but this is good too

**ItsJustSketchyy** (10): If this is the first bonus song to drop out, I'm leaving this subreddit and never coming back.

**MashLuke** (10): fat bop

**acedino** (9.5): Shouldve been on the album

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Honestly, Quavo has been hit or miss since Culture I but this song is just really catchy, and the instrumental is wonderful. Would have not minded more of this direction on CAMILA but Im happy with what we got

**jjs33072** (8.9): CAMILA WHAT are you doing this was a BOP and deserved to be on the album

**frogaranaman** (8): Incredible how Camila has three good songs and this is one of them.

**MissyBee37** (8): Another pop song I should love that's ruined by a member of Migos. I would give Camila's parts a 9/10. But I hate Quavo's verse so, so much. Given that this was written with Charli XCX, I'd much rather have a feature from her!! But it's a killer beat and a super fun song.

**skargardin** (8): OMG would've fit perfectly on Camila smh.

**TheShineSoul** (8): Same as both CITC and IHQ, better than a lot of stuff in Camila

**1998tweety** (7.8): I like parts of this but it really pales next to Havana. Quavo's bit drags a lot.

**tapdancingpig** (7.7): This had to be left off Camila, but she pulls it off pretty well.

**Glennishill** (7): This is a 9 but its brought down by Quavo. Stop featuring Migos, yall.

**luigi\_is\_better** (7): weird to think that i like this more than havana. still a bop tho

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): The forgotten little sister of Havana, and, unfortunately, it didn't make it into the album. Quavo is pretty forgettable, which is a bummer, since this is the type of song that does need a rap verse, but Camilla's parts are feisty, flirty, hot and energetic; it's her performance that makes this song worth listening to.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7): Camila over a trap beat is nice but there are moments where her vocals miss. Quavo is just on this???

**vayyiqra** (7): can Quavo not be on things anymore also is conversate even a real word also this beat sounds like Soundcloud rap but lyrics by Charli XCX on benzodiazepines

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): this is just a generic trap song tbh. I do like that instrumental base... but why quavo

**eklxtreme** (6.5): the instrumental is dope but this entire song is a mess and idk what this is supposed to be

**twat\_brained** (6.2): The only good pop collab Quavo has had was with Katy Perry. Other than that I can do without him in this rate

**hikkaru** (4): OMG this song sucks, thank the lorde Havana is the one that blew up and inspired the rest of her album

**Me-Luigi** (4): this should have been a quavo feat. charli xcx song, epic was really trying to push this instead of havana at first and that's laughable

**wailordfan\_** (2): Not. A. Fan.

**MrSwearword** (1): gurl get this shit the fuck out my face

**Needlesslyrics** (1): i don't vibe with Quavo

**Shipsinker44** (9): I like how the production all just fits together so well but when you try and separate the production it sounds like they shouldnt work

---
**Me-Luigi** (10): this is incredible

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): my favorite of the deluxe tracks on this album

**misterralex** (10): Another song that should've been on the regular album! Bad Together is catchy and the album would not had missed a beat if it was on the regular edition rather than the deluxe.

**wailordfan\_** (10): another bop lost due to the bonus rate :eyes:

**twat\_brained** (9.8): Dua's already a total baddie so for her to ask I can be her baddie just lights an immense fire under me🔥

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Honestly, it's amazing that Dua could serve so many bops in just one era-this is the last bonus song on her debut and it's still one of her best! In fact, I'd say it's a better closer than Last Dance. It fits in very well with the grandiose of the first half of the album and I can understand why it's a fan favourite.

**vayyiqra** (9): nobody working rn does breakup anthems quite like Dua this rate has given me a new respect for her as a songwriter and vocalist how do you say "I'm stanning" in Albanian

**1998tweety** (8.6): I hear so many different types of music in this song and somehow they blend together.

**TheShineSoul** (8): Her voice makes this song great.

**eklxtreme** (7.5): I love the strong note in the chorus but the rest of the song is just alright

**MrSwearword** (7): cohesive but not significant

**tapdancingpig** (6.5): I almost wanted to skip this after the last two bonus tracks, but this one is significantly better. The lyrics are actively interesting here, and the verses are solid. The chorus is boring (they tried), but that’s a better ratio of good to bad than the last two songs.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Average Dua Lipa song

**Leixander** (4): why did she even record this mess

**frogaranaman** (3): Sure?

**luigi\_is\_better** (2): just remove the together

**Shipsinker44** (10): This is one of Camila's best and would probably be getting my 11 if it wasn't a bonus track

---
**1998tweety** (10): The first time I heard this I thought it was Crying in the Club, the transition in the video left me so shook. This is easily one of her bests songs and should've been included on the album.

**agentofscranton** (10): robbed of a spot on the album

**cyborglilith** (10): bop also THAT COVER ART

**lilacsweetener** (10): She snapt...

**misterralex** (10): This song deserved to be on Camila, I honestly don't know why she cut it because thematically it fits and it wouldn't had changed much of the album's pacing.

**skargardin** (9): If anything this really deserved to be on her debut album, itís stellar

**eklxtreme** (8.5): the dynamic between the low and strong vocals are rly powerful on this

**Leixander** (8.5): should've been on the album[2]

**TheShineSoul** (8.5): Same as CITC

**twat\_brained** (8.4): My question is why this was left off the final tracklist. A very good and very underrated tune

**jjs33072** (8.1): Why isn't this on the album either

**Me-Luigi** (8): this is excellent and should have been on the album

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8): An emotional and moving song from Camila, where she lets all the pain out in her voice

**vayyiqra** (8): for a second I thought this was Bebe Reptar anyway this lowkey bops

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): those strings are so somber. and this is so angsty. I still kinda like it.

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): This would have fit in on Camila. Maybe you would have to remove some of the instruments (and re-record that vocal... vocal fry is not your friend Camila), but it fits in with some of the other dramatic ballads on the album.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I remember people liking this more than Crying In The Club upon its release, and I was originally in that camp. Maybe it's because Camilla's album was oversaturated with ballads, but I feel the reverse now. I still like her tone here, but she doesn't have it in her to make a song like this, and neither does the production.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): so do i

**luigi\_is\_better** (6.5): i was so happy when she released this song standalone after seeing citc's video. def the best out of the two and i was not here for listening to a ballad with camila's voice at the time.

**MrSwearword** (4): most of my questions are how the fuck does she end up with the minimal but still applicable success to her name despite not being able to carry a tune in a bucket. However, this isn't the worst piece of shit to her name.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): I have questions, number one, why did this song get made?

**wailordfan\_** (4): This song though. EHHHHHHHH.

**frogaranaman** (1): This is what I expect a seventh grader to write for their deep poetry unit.

**Shipsinker44** (9): I have loved this song since it came out, Popheads was delusional when they said it sucked, thank you

**letsallpoo** (3): I LOVE CHEPA THRILLS

---
**1998tweety** (10): This is such a huge bop.

**cyborglilith** (10): this song shook my world (but not as much as All These Years did) also THAT COVER ART

**SpanKKy1** (10): a mood

**wailordfan\_** (10): I'm a firm believer in this track. It slapped, it had emotion, it did what Ari tried to do in NTLTC better imo.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Better than I remember

**vayyiqra** (9): okay as a sadboi pop stan who love/hates clubbing I've always found the name and concept of this song hilarious it's a whole mood anyway I wish I hadn't known it was written by Sia because now it's all I can hear but still

**eklxtreme** (8.5): her lower vocals are annoying but this is catchy as fuck

**hikkaru** (8.5): a flop single but kinda a bop tbh

**jjs33072** (8.5): Why didn't this make the album

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.5): More like bopping in the club, should have been on the album

**TheShineSoul** (8.5): Fine debut single, it sounds nice today, don't know why it was disappointing to many, it's much better than a lot of stuff in Camila

**twat\_brained** (8.2): I still love it even if it's a Sia reject

**Leixander** (8): should've been on the album

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Is...is it a bad thing if I...if I like this better than most of the songs on Camilla's actual debut? Sure, I'd say that She Loves Control, Havana, and Never Be The Same are all the same quality or better, but I really like the dark sound she goes for here and I'm fond of the Genie in a Bottle sample. Her voice isn't as controlled, but I think that negative is clouded by the positives. It's not a fantastic song, but I really wish she went in this direction over the one she ended up choosing.

**rickikardashian** (8): I ended up kind of liking this with time, but damn, at the time, while she was still v hated, releasing the third part of the Cheap Thrills saga was not a good idea

**tapdancingpig** (8): I can’t imagine Camila continuing in this direction, so I guess it’s a good thing that THTHTL got scrapped. However, this is a damn good song, even if it’s not as obviously personal to Camila.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): anal crying in the plug

**lilacsweetener** (7): I did not hate this as much as most people did, it was way more atmospheric than Cheap Thrills and the Christina sample is kind of haunting. Even a slightly more unique intro could've avoided people writing it off.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): i love Sia

**MissyBee37** (7): I want to love this song. This is a fun song and I think by another artist, I'd like it even better, but the way her vocal, especially on the chorus, sounds like the Sia demo it began as instead of the unique Camila voice I love is disappointing. It's not surprising her manager later admitted this song just isn't her. It doesn't feel like it. But I do actually like it as a song.

**Me-Luigi** (5.5): sia why

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): CITC stands for Ci Ilove Tcheap Cthrills

**luigi\_is\_better** (3.5): not as annoying as it was when it was released but still by far camila's worst song

**mudkip1** (2): sia tried

**frogaranaman** (1): This song actually has me crying in the club because of how terrible it is.

**MrSwearword** (1): she ripped off Sia and sounds like shit

**Shipsinker44** (7.5): KICKING OFF day 2 is DUA LIPA with one of her best songs being voted off already because you guys wouldnt know what taste it if topped you! This loss is absolutely tragic and i dont forgive any of you for not even letting this break a 7 AVERAGE.GOD.

**letsallpoo** (4): No Goodbyes? More like...eh you know the rest.

---
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (11): i think I replayed this about 200 times one day when I was suicidal


---

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): If there's a perfect song on Dua Lipa, it's definitely this. Putting two slow songs beside each other should be a death sentence, but this is one of the few tracks I've heard that I'd describe as downright ethereal. The production is lush and beautifully put together, and it makes me think I'm floating in the sky during a sunset, which fits in with the song's themes. Is it possible for a song to be so awesome and tearjerking at once?

**CarlieScion** (9): This is the perfect way to make a ballad build into a drop

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): The most emotional and resonating song for me on this album. You can feel the raw emotion from Dua's sadness and longing. I can heavily relate to this song when I broke up with my ex, and to that extent the rest of this album. The opening lyrics shook my the first time because its almost exactly how I felt.

**therandomsinger13** (8.9): Sad bop

**1998tweety** (8.7): I love the lyrics on this song and has an EDM chorus that I actually like.

**tapdancingpig** (8): This ballad works a lot better for me. I think she emotes better, I think there's more energy there (even before the synths kick in).

**twat\_brained** (8): You know that feeling you get when there are songs much better suited to this album in the deluxe edition than in standard? That's how I feel when listening to this. I like the song but

**AnimationJava** (7.5): Another song about a former love, in which Dua Lipa is remorseful.

**eklxtreme** (7.5): sweet but pretty generic overall

**vayyiqra** (7): I like the production but idk

**wailordfan\_** (7): Another average song similar to IDGAF, but it at least doesn't feel like 'filler', it more just feels less inspired.

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): repetitive

**TheShineSoul** (6.5): It's a nice pop song but there's a lot of that here and better so it's kinda forgettable

**Me-Luigi** (6.3): repetitive and doesn't do it for me

**MrSwearword** (6): boring but above average production

**OriginalKappa** (6): Appreciate the more soulful sound but not everything is working so well here.

**PeachPlumParity** (6): It's kind of slow and boring and sounds a lot like Garden but a little more upbeat.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Completely forgot this track existed

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): It can't decide if it wants to be a ballad or a house song

**Leixander** (5): filler

**frogaranaman** (4): This song is Dua Lipa towards her four year old singles shes still performing on tour sets.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (3): Lol bye

**Shipsinker44** (7): This was a really good song from bebe, one of the better songs off of her two projects. Okay ill be honest i just dont have a lot to say about bebe! For camila and dua i can praise their art, for zara i can be pleasantly surprised and trash her, but for bebe she really is just kinda mediocre that i cant really do any of those. Im sorry bebe, i wish we rated expectations instead!

**letsallpoo** (6): "I can only take you in small doses" is a really good description of Bebe as a whole.

---

**tf2manu994** (8.7): I can only take you, It's moldosis.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Bebe uses 'love is a drug' imagery frequently on this EP (another flaw, despite her obvious talent I find it hard to find a song from her that's cliche-free) and this is about as good as it gets lyric-wise. It's a fairly standard bop, but it's okay as a third song.

**jjs33072** (8.5): THE song from this EP. Lyrics relating the toxic relationship to drugs are just soul crushing. Favorite chorus on the EP (and favorite of Bebe's overall).

**PeachPlumParity** (4): It's kinda low-energy and I don't like the cliches and then the last chorus hit and I was bashed over the head with the love-is-a-drug cliche fourteen more times with the same generic production so I had to lower my score for the third time. I'm not sure what I expected.

---

**therandomsinger13** (10): First discovered this because it samples Lindsey Stirling. I’ve always thought about adding vocals to a Lindsey song, but Bebe did it for me!

**Me-Luigi** (10): that sample really works well here! it's beautiful

**wailordfan\_** (7): First of all, the hook melody in the chorus is a sample of Lindsey Stirling's 'First Light', and I love hearing a violin part added into a pop song, however, the lyrics here are so *meh* and generic.

---

**hikkaru** (7): I can only take Bebe Rexha in small doses

**MrSwearword** (5): at least she's quoting her music critics

**CarlieScion** (5): omg she made a song about my relationship with her songs :wig:

**luigi\_is\_better** (1): i can only take this song in small doses but when i say small doses it means none because this song fucking sucks

letsallpoo: 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I wish more songs like this were in her album

**TheShineSoul** (9.5): One of the standouts here clearly, Bebe sounds so good in this kind of songs.

**1998tweety** (8.8): Bebe makes so many bops I can take them in large doses.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.8): The best song on both of these EPs! The lyrics are great and the production actually works! A BOP!!!

**dropthehammer11** (8): oof this is lit

**lilacsweetener** (8): Should've been a single.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): The chorus doesn't flow well - other than that it's pretty good

**eklxtreme** (7): I like how intense the instrumental is but there's not much else on this track for me

**lady\_sable** (7): i do kinda like this one

**Raykel** (7): OH MY GOD it started off with iconic RAWM vibes then it went downhillso quickly

**tapdancingpig** (7): Great lyrics, and killer verses, but the chorus is lackluster again.

**vayyiqra** (7): I see we're on to the edgy love=drug metaphors early into this rate nevertheless I kind of like this

**twat\_brained** (6.2): me with my parents. Also with this song because I’m not feeling it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Decent drop but the chorus has awkward delivery? I dont know why but her pronunciation rubs me off as weird

**ImADudeDuh** (5): maybe break up with him then?

**AnimationJava** (4.5): An overall average song, while the lyrics are hot and sexy-- the beat is forgettable and I don't feel any desire to play it.

**OriginalKappa** (4): That distorted vocal bit towards the end of the song is so awful it sounds like garbage

**ItsJustSketchyy** (3): I had to keep re-listening to the song because I kept forgetting it when I went to write this comment.

**Needlesslyrics** (3): not great, but points for her self-awareness

**frogaranaman** (1): [REDACTED]

**Shipsinker44** (7.5): Can i be honest? I know im an adult, but the production on this song creeps me out. It kinda reminds me of Fergie’s song Hungry, with the weird opening production. Like, it just CREEPS me out dude, and ive never really been able to enjoy this song because of it.

**letsallpoo** (4): Some debut singles are amazing and iconic: Just Dance, Baby One More Time, Ur So Gay. Some are not.

---

**wailordfan\_** (9): Avatar the Last Airbender is shaking with these drums in the intro. The hook's beat and instrumental change up is so amazing.

**therandomsinger13** (8.7): Ooh love this beat. I can some people banging on some buckets and dancing at the same time on the street. Kinda hard to pay attention to the vocals bc I can’t stop thinking about this beat.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I was surprised when I realised this was one of Dua's most well-known songs before the album's release, because...eh...it's just not that good to me. I can get the appeal behind the chorus, however slight, but it seems more to me like a filler song, albeit a good one, than something that brings up hype.

**twat\_brained** (10): Why the hell does Dua perform this live without doing the bridge? She clearly has no problem hitting those C5's in the chorus so why leave out the bridge? Makes no sense to me. Also fun fact: when I did a project for a dance class in college I chose this as our post-routine stretch song.

**AnimationJava** (5.5): "and I've been through mountains and seas, trying to get you to come back to me" cutest lyric from the song, not much else to say.

letsallpoo: 

**mudkip1** (10): ugh what a song

**PuggleMaster** (10): the song that turned me into a STAN

**eklxtreme** (9.5): her vocals are beautiful on this and they give me goosebumps

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): this should've been the closer song (and the single cover should've been the album's cover)

**Me-Luigi** (9): excellent

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): wtf this percussion is so good

**vayyiqra** (9): the tempo changes are a little weird but the synth goes off and as long as a Dua Lipa song has a big anthemic chorus that's really all I want

**1998tweety** (8.1): I know I said I liked different sounding songs but this feels like a bit of a demo.

**CarlieScion** (8): The live version of this is so much better

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Sounds very jumbled and loose. But I like it

**Leixander** (8): a kinda strange pop song that I like

**MrSwearword** (8): Dua can sing the part of seductress but she can't *exude* it yet and that's a critical element she'll probably nail on the next album.

**PeachPlumParity** (8): This is like Genesis two-point-oh in my mind.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): this song sounds kind of raw and early but I still like it

**TheShineSoul** (7): The most unconventional sound here and it was her debut single. I wanna hear more of Dua like this.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): i get so tired by the fourth time she repeats the chorus

**tapdancingpig** (4): She's come a LONG way since this song.

**cyborglilith** (3): such quality recording

**frogaranaman** (2): Im listening to the deluxe version and I didnt even realize this song was different from Room For 2 until I double checked how long the song was.

**Shipsinker44** (5): Let me tell you, writing Bebe’s notes for each song has been so boring, especially when i had to write so many of them right after each other because so many of her songs went out so fast. Luckily since shes already had so many out, itll get easier! Anyway, its no suprise that this landed in the middle of the rate since its so average

**letsallpoo** (4): It took me like a week to finish this rate because every time I tried to start listening to Bebe's shit, this song would immediately delete all interest I had in her work. I had to listen to this like four times to get some imprint of what is sounded like in my head.

---

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): where is Bebes rap album

**eklxtreme** (8): need me some more rapping bebe

**vayyiqra** (8): I like the synths and the beat is okay, but her singing is way > her rapping. That said: queen of meteorology, we stan a science buff, omg her mind, etc.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I actually really like this opener; a fairly original metaphor coupled with a melody that I'd be fairly interested in compared to all the other flops I typically listen to on Sunday radio makes for a pretty decent introduction to these EPs.

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): The chorus falls a little short. She sounds great though, and the lyrics are great. I will always love a song with delivery that fast.

**MissyBee37** (6): Love the chorus; verses, not so much. I love that lyric refrain,"There isn't enough love in the atmosphere to keep you here." Great lyric! Not a fan of the music.

**MrSwearword** (5): brr...it's cold in here...there must be mediocrity in the atmosphere.

**wailordfan\_** (5): [The verses remind me a lot of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVEyVDqWMqU)

**nahaalne** (10): Holy fuc, where was this song in my life

**therandomsinger13** (9): Bop! Does this sample Trap Queen? I like the “ooh woah ooh oh”s in the bridge.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.5): This is the one song that where Bebe blends her rapping and singing well! The production is good too!

**TheShineSoul** (8.5): Great opener to EP

**1998tweety** (8): This is okay, not the best opener imo.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Really 'atmospheric' but the motor-mouth verses seem out of place

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): good intro, i like the beat quite a bit

**ItsJustSketchyy** (7.4): Okay I actually like this one, why am I only hearing this now?

**CarlieScion** (7): one of the better ones

**twat\_brained** (7): This could be the cold I have talking but I feel like I’m falling back asleep again

**jjs33072** (6.7): A bop, but the melodies and flow of the song don't really draw me, love the lyrics tho!

**AnimationJava** (6.5): Bebe begins her EP with a sweet song pronouncing her love for someone, nothing super memorable but overall pretty cute lyrics and a nice beat.

**lady\_sable** (6.5): it's not like. bad but i wouldn't go out of my way to listen to this again.

**PeachPlumParity** (6.2): The production is really repetitive but I liked it for the first minute.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (6): Am I the only one who gets Selena Gomez and the Scene vibes from this?

**OriginalKappa** (4): I might just be being really dumb here but do the lyrics on the chorus make any sense? I'm trying to make sense of it but I can't

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): this is possibly the worst version of C-Murders iconic chorus

**frogaranaman** (3): She is restraining herself *so hard* from saying the n-word in the chorus.

**Shipsinker44** (8): This song has some GREAT production but its remixes are even better. The song definitely.. Is missing something because it kinda feels empty but its still a good bop to hear when ur walking down a street. The goldhouse remix of this song absolutely fixes it. And dont worry Zara stans! This is her last song out for the day (lmao just kidding)

**letsallpoo** (6): So Good? More like...it's okay.

---

**luigi\_is\_better** (6.5): can ty also be called a pop prophecy girl since he's almost in all of these albums

**tapdancingpig** (9): The keyboard and 808 is a fun, tried and true mix, and she sounds great. The high belting chorus is great. Even Ty Dolla $ign tries to get in on the riffing madness.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): This is a song that has dramatically gotten worse to me as time has progressed, its like it goes completely downhill after the introduction and for some reason I almost cant listen to it now

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): To be honest, I've never heard a Ty Dolla $ign feature I've actually liked. Most of the time, he's just, there. This is no exception. But even if this song as a whole is less bombastic than the ones before it, especially when you compare the choruses, it still acts as a nice bridge to the middle of the album.

**vayyiqra** (8): after listening to Camila's album I was expecting someone to come in with "Fifth Harmonyyyy!" after that intro but anyway thissa catchy little tune

---

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (6): Not So Good

**PuggleMaster** (10): hot take but it's better than lush life

**Leixander** (9.5): chorus is godly, why is ty dolla on this

**twat\_brained** (9.2): Wait, what did Ty say? Also I can't remember any words other than "You know my love is so good". Love the piano here though

**therandomsinger13** (8.4): I know this one. I like the vocal effects on the chorus.

**gannade** (8): a 10 but the autotuned chorus is bad

**ImADudeDuh** (8): same sample as The Way?

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7.9): this has a potential to go bigger and Im just disappointed for a title track

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): the "so good"s can be tiring

**1998tweety** (7.4): This is okay I guess, the chorus is grating tbh.

**jjs33072** (7.1): A BOP, don't like the feature

**skargardin** (7): The rent-a-rapper strategy just don't work

**TheShineSoul** (6.5): It's fine but I don't understand how they named the album after this song.

**CanadianSkeleton** (6): Unnecessary feature

**frogaranaman** (4): My apathy for this album only grows every song.

**PeachPlumParity** (3): Who told her she could rap

**lilacsweetener** (2): Has to be an Ariana leftover...

**Me-Luigi** (2): when I listen this I just imagine Charlie Puth singing it and that'd be tons better, it's just uninteresting and didn't deserve to be the title track, 1 point deducted because she didn't write it

**letsallpoo** (7): Generic title and generic song overall, but I think Dua's pretty good at these jazzy numbers. The weed references are a bit tired, though.

---

**Needlesslyrics** (8): Ariana Grande, Frank Ocean and Dua Lipa collab please

**luigi\_is\_better** (4): ariana and frank sweeties im so sorry

**frogaranaman** (1): I immediately had hopes this would be a cover of Frank Oceans Thinkin Bout You, but then I realized that would mean there would be a well written song on the album.

---

**vayyiqra** (8): okay this is a fine song but we all know nobody listens to a Dua Lipa album for the coffeehouse acoustic jams

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): I love the jazzy/soul influence here - it's real finger-snapping

**MissyBee37** (8): I love that she went acoustic for this. It's so different from the rest of the album that it stands out in a good way -- and lets her voice & the melody stand out, too. The vulnerable lyrics match and make for a beautiful, sad song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Since a lot of this album was written about three years ago, it's a really interesting dive into how much modern pop can change in such a short time span. This is the song that fits in today's depressing pop landscape the most, and I've seen a few people recommend it as a single for that reason. Still, despite the song's profitability, it's not as good as the songs that followed it. It's still worth a listen, but I'm unfortunately going to have to pin it down where the streak ends.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (6): Most of the songs on this album have multiple things going on with its production that complement Dua's vocals but this one its just the guitar. This feels incomplete, like there is to be more than just that guitar in the background, but towards the end it gets better and shows potential.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): her raspy voice works so well here UGH her mind

**wailordfan\_** (9): A better guitar driven song than IDGAF, and vocally more interesting.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I’ve always liked this but not in the ways that I like her other singles.

**1998tweety** (8.5): I love how every song on this album sounds different.

**therandomsinger13** (8.5): Not as exciting as others.

**skargardin** (8): Her lower register really shines here

**Shipsinker44** (8): Okay tbh this track is overrated as hell. The lyrics are nice but its a boring piano ballad and the mixing on her voice is HORRIBLE, it does not at all sound like her voice is singing live with a piano

---
**lilacsweetener** (11): Absolutely devastating. By the time she brings the higher notes in, the pain behind the lyrics is palpable.


---

**AnimationJava** (7): Surprisingly catchy, Something's Gotta Give reminds me of A Million Reasons. You can feel Camila's heavy heart as she wants to love her ex-boyfriend, but she can't because of the reason he's giving her to leave.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): It's a better ballad than Consequences but not by much

**MissyBee37** (10): Gorgeous, gorgeous ballad. I love the piano, the melody & lyrics, and her vocal. You can absolutely feel the desperation & it hurts.

**strawberryswing1** (10): a really good ballad? from a main pop girl? shook.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I find this to be the best ballad on Camila's debut, which makes sense, seeing as it was rumoured to be one of her first singles under the title 'A Good Reason To Go' (at least to my inference). Her vocal performance here is pretty much as she gets on the album.

**CarlieScion** (6): i dont understand why this is here over i have questions

**frogaranaman** (2): I was sadder over my boyfriend breaking up with me in a dream where he transformed into a lobster compared to this song.

**ItsJustSketchyy** (10): I love how big this song gets towards the end. Truly makes me feel feels.

**MrSwearword** (10): none of Camila's annoying missed falsetto/high notes and a production that doesn't suck [even if it reads as a ripoff Lana Del Rey in the Born to Die era]

**PeachPlumParity** (10): Probably top 2 songs on this album for me.

**1998tweety** (9): These lyrics are hard hitting. No reason to stay is a good reason to go, is such a simple line but its so effective. I especially love the last chorus.

**therandomsinger13** (9): Pretty! Emo rawr XD

**MashLuke** (8): the best ballad in this album

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): a GOOD ballad

**acedino** (7): I love the start but I usually end up skipping after the second verse

**tapdancingpig** (7): The chorus is kind of dull, but the lyrics are great.

**TheShineSoul** (7): Lyrics are great, sonically there isn't much to it but it's still nice.

**jjs33072** (6.7): Once again Camila, pls be my friend

**lady\_sable** (6.5): honestly slow ballads just...dont really work for her

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This is another track that nobody really talks about, and besides the production, theres really nothing to talk about

**twat\_brained** (6): I wasn't paying much attention to this oop

**vayyiqra** (6): forgettable

**wailordfan\_** (6): She just doesn't really serve any vocals during her ballads, huh? I don't think I was really taken away during a song since Consequences or She Loves Control?

**skargardin** (5.5): This feel very faux to me, doesn't really do anything for me.

**eklxtreme** (5): almost sounds like a stripped down version of a good song. if they replaced the generic piano, I'd like this cus the lyrics aren't bad.

**Me-Luigi** (4): another boring ballad

**PuggleMaster** (4): this is soooo boring

**OriginalKappa** (2): The lyrics here are so lazy and it makes this soppy ballad circle around to being almost funny

**Shipsinker44** (10): This might actually be my favorite song on Camila’s album and im pretty sad at it not really doing as well as i think it should, but ah well. When this song came out, it definitely seemed like her most personal song and i connected a lot with it. I admit, the production and vocals dont really mix that well because it really sounds like they copy pasted her vocals over the guitar, but besides that, its a top notch song in my book.

**letsallpoo** (6): drag that rat lauren

---

**AnimationJava** (8.5): Raw and real, this is perhaps the track off Camila that tugs at your heartstrings the most. Undoubtedly about Fifth Harmony and her fall-out with them, you canít help but feel for Camila by the end of it.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I'm going to leave Fifth Harmony, I don't really understand you girls,,, or any of the terms you use. And every time I come here, you guys act all super strange and everything and change th topic. I don't know what you all have against me but I don't like how you all treat me,,,best of luck to all of your lives, goodbye,,,

**MissyBee37** (9.5): I said it for Bebe and I'll say it again (and maybe more artists will listen) - There aren't enough songs about friendships! I like this one & relate to it, a lot. It reminds me of my wallflower life, shrinking from small talk & fake people after one too many betrayals. I too long for her lyric that wishes for talking about nothing with somebody that means something. Camila gets it! Pretty guitar & melodies, too.

---

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Maybe this and Bebe Rexhas FFF can get a drink and cry over this or something

**rickikardashian** (8.4): The PG version of F.F.F.

**cyborglilith** (10): relatable; < all these years

**CarlieScion** (9): jdfksnfds this was so shady

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): im sorry everyone im just a sucker for songs about friendship so this is my favorite from the album. the way camila delivers "gotta get up out of this town" is pure gold

**1998tweety** (8.7): I used to love this song but its forever ruined for me cause when she performed it she got a fan to come on stage and he got to sing a bit (he wasn't that good) but the worst part was he twerked on Camila.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I just got Lights Down Low flashbacks. Luckily this is better than that abomination

**rotating3Dtext** (8): I feel good listening to this. I mean the lyrics are kinda sad but I like listening to what I want to think are honest and genuine feelings.

**skargardin** (8): Feelsbadman

**therandomsinger13** (8): Kinda boring, but relatable!

**TheShineSoul** (8): Relatable as shit, she sounds great.

**twat\_brained** (7.7): I get what Camila was trying to go for with the stripped down feel but I feel like it could be way better with more maximized production

**jjs33072** (7.2): Camila omg I will be ur friend pls don't make me cry

**PeachPlumParity** (7.2): It's ok I guess. Not the best song in the last half of the album by far but it does ok.

**Me-Luigi** (7): catchy and much better than consequenses

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): wig intact, but this was cute

**Needlesslyrics** (7): chill pop queen

**tapdancingpig** (7): Pleasant, but nothing to write home about.

**vayyiqra** (7): okay but where the hell is her rhythm section, did they take the day off

**lilacsweetener** (6): The echoey guitar she keeps using adds so much to her songs.

**wailordfan\_** (6): I don't think I love that 'ballads' have become more upbeat? If I want to feel sad I don't want a happy coo from Camila. If I wanted to be unsure of my feelings I'd listen to Paramore.

**MashLuke** (5.5): sort of trite

**eklxtreme** (5): boring/generic for the most part

**frogaranaman** (4): This is fake indie but, like, the bad kind of fake indie.

**MrSwearword** (1): the platonic version of "Hide Away" by Daya, y'all

**Shipsinker44** (9): Queen of finally reaching a 7 average but UGH why is this song already out! This song is a really really good club song. Well i mean i never heard it in a club but im ASSUMING it wouldve been really really good becase who doesnt start violently shaking when they hear this

**letsallpoo** (7): It's okay, I'm sure you're not the only one who forgot Bebe was in this rate. This song is pretty cute, but it's telling that the peak on this album would be considered mediocre on releases from other artists.

---
**imasalesman** (11): Bebe will probably get wrecked in this rate but she deserves to win thank you for your time

---

**ImADudeDuh** (3): why does this drop sound like someone just googled "2016-2018 tropical drop beat" and just picked the first one they found.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (4.5): We love a grindr hookup song, ugh she knows the gays so well. Shame that the song couldn't be better

**hikkaru** (10): The trap-pop preceeding this put me to sleep but the groove on this song SLAPS. I didn't think anything by Bebe would have even the slightest chance of catching my eye, but I've been bopping to this song for weeks now. I think I've come to the conclusion that Bebe works best as an EDM feature, which is essentially what this song is, so I guess that's why I'm not as put off by it as I am by her other solo work.

**MrSwearword** (6): the muddled perspective is pissing me off again but at least this dated beat isn't that terrible [but goddamn you Bebe, pick a fucking POV to sing from]

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I was actually pretty impressed when I heard this. It has a bit of that 'oomph' that made Bebe write songs like The Monster and it perks you up towards the end of All Your Fault, which is something this set of EPs desperately needed. Along with the next song I'd consider it the peak of the project.

**PuggleMaster** (10): I love how summery this song is, bebe really did THAT!

**rickikardashian** (9.7): She honestly should have tried and push this as a single eventually tbh, this feels very summery and fun, it could have done good

**TheShineSoul** (9.5): Such a great and catchy song, I wanted this to be the single (Thank god it wasn't in the end lmfao)

**twat\_brained** (9.4): If one thing's for sure, this song is definitely “The One" from this EP! I’ve not listened to Expectations all the way through yet but hopefully it's more like songs like this.

**Gatyto2002** (9): No sense, Want It or not?

**Me-Luigi** (9): scandinavian pop perfection, 1 point deducted because she didn't write it

**PeachPlumParity** (9): This is a really good song I'm glad they didn't put a shitty trend-chasing feature on it.

**therandomsinger13** (8.9): Good but I got a tiny bit bored by the end.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Trop Pop has finally affected Bebe and, surprise surprise, she does a great job with it. The hook is really solid, and she sounds great on it.

**eklxtreme** (8): catchy festival vibes on this

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): I can enjoy stylistic auto tune

**vayyiqra** (8): bored as I am of trop-pop beats this kind of bops tbh

**jjs33072** (7.5): Once again, another bop, sounds like it should be on AYF Pt. 1

**selegend** (7): This is really just I Got You but not quite as good

**AnimationJava** (6.5): The lyrics are a bit quirky, about the different implications of the word ìloveî (sex vs. romance). An interesting take.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Chorus is repetitive, plus it makes me wonder why the guy/girl shouldn't be in love with her

**frogaranaman** (6): Okay, Ill give her a pass on this one.

**lilacsweetener** (6): This is like the 20th "I suck at relationships" song sheesh...

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Probably the most tolerable song Ive heard from both EPs, but its nothing  to write home about

**MissyBee37** (5.5): Cute song concept, good lyrics. Bittersweet. But I hate the instrumentation in the chorus.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): possibly the most generic trop pop song imaginable

**wailordfan\_** (5): Ugh everything is just so fucking generic, and put a pop drop here too?

**strawberryswing1** (4): this instrumental sounds like it would be in a youtubers outro

**OriginalKappa** (2): What is up with that drop? It's like Bebe wanted to put that song she did with Martin Garrix on the EP but she couldn't so they had to make this instead and it sounds awful.

letsallpoo: Introducing: better album writeups!

# All Your Fault Pt. 2

---

This was certainly an album.

**Overall average**: 5.935

[All averages](https://pastebin.com/m0PEprXA)

---

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8.500): this EPs biggest weakness is cohesion. It feels like just a bunch of songs slapped together for a digital release because its exactly just that. The first 2 songs showcases Bebe pandering into trap music territory, the the third song comes on and its the obvious pop radio single with an annoying rap feature. Then, we suddenly get a song with worldbeat influence, and another sudden shift to another genre as the EP closes with Meant to Be. Thank God *Expectations* was so much better at being cohesive. 

**tapdancingpig** (8.000): I think I prefer this to Pt. 1. Bebe still hasnt quite found her voice as a pop star, but she gets close with The Way I Are, and theres a lot more variety than Pt. 1. 

**Me-Luigi** (7.883): Sis really tried 100 genres on this to see what would stick and it worked, her mind, didn't really work together as a project tho, Expectations should have been in the rate instead 

**luigi_is_better** (7.333): i will fight everyone that thinks this isnt better than pt 1. bebe's songwriting props don't shine here but there's a lot of bops and im not looking for the next best seller so get off perverts 

**MashLuke** (7.167): sort of bad 

**vayyiqra** (6.833): REMOVE PERVERTS remove perverts you are worst turk sqhipere shqipare 

**PeachPlumParity** (6.800): Much better than part 1 but I miss "I'm A Mess" since that's her best song. 

**jjs33072** (6.650): A good album but weaker than Pt. 1 

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.417): People seem to like this EP better than the first one, and while I'm nowhere near enthusiastic about it, the highest moments of this project are located towards the end. Finishing it, I guess I can say that I don't have a huge problem with Bebe; she obviously has some talent, and she can be great at crafting a song, but I feel like this is a bit of a rocky start that lacks that special factor that makes pop music great. I do hear that Expectations is supposed to be better, so I may check it out. 

**JanuraryFourteenth** (6.000): 6.5 Listenable but not something I’d hold I’m heavy rotation. 

**CarlieScion** (6.000): bebe u cant just put a rap/country feature on a song and then say its done girl!!!! 

**TheShineSoul** (5.833): Disappointing after Pt. 1 

**AnimationJava** (5.750): All Your Fault Pt. 2 is a less cohesive album than Pt. 2, but there are gems inside it that match the quality of Pt. 1 

**OriginalKappa** (4.500): If this EP didn't have The Way I Are, it would be one of the worst things ever. It screams desperate, with all these cringey attempts at crossover success with popular genres right now. In 5 years this will be one of the most dated pieces of music in existence. 

**mudkip1** (4.167): did she even try her best here? 

**MrSwearword** (4.000): At least Bebe is environmentally friendly considering how reduced, reused and recycled this EP is. 

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3.500): no, again 

**MissyBee37** (3.083): I totally understand & respect the rationale behind not including *Expectations*, but I'm still sad about it because I like very little about this EP and I love her album. I'm glad she goes with a different vibe on the album because I don't care for the instrumentation on most of these tracks and I love the sound of her full album. 

**ImADudeDuh** (3.000): I don't know how the fuck popheads can say that they hate all trap music for being boring af and yet still like this EP. This was one of the worst projects I've ever listened to. Terrible, bland production, uninspired lyrics, and a total lack of anything original whatsoever. There isn't even any *good* songs on this. It's all pretty equally bad. 

**frogaranaman** (2.500): This EP brought us "Meant To Be", so I automatically hate it before listening to it. 

**selegend** (2.500): This is straight garbage 

**lilacsweetener** (1.833): I'm getting major Tinashe vibes from Bebe as an artist. No vision, personality or uniqueness. Just a bunch of messy songs about messy sex and attitude. Boring, been done, burnt out, nothing new.

**Shipsinker44** (7): Ngl i had to rediscover this while writing this because i just had no memory, and i wouldve been perfectly if i never really heard it again. Its not a bad song but i think its just so tragic that Zara put filler on only the third spot on her album!

**letsallpoo** (7): I alternate between hating this song and loving it but either way I can't deny that screaming "I woULD LIKe...TO GET....TO KNOooooOW U BAYYBEH" is kinda fun.

---


**vayyiqra** (9): that opening is fire, reminds me of Love Is a Battlefield (one of my favourite songs ever and it should be yours too tbh) and the rest is solid as hell, now watch I guarantee some teenager will call it "dated" because the production sounds like EDM

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I'm not a fan of the male synth-seriously, I don't know why people keep on doing them, it always ends up sounding distracting at best and creepy at worst-but, otherwise, this is one of my favourite Zara songs. She blends a cute and innocent demeanour with hotness in here and it really plays off.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This is a song that seems okay but then youre actually listening to it and youre like the dude with the question marks around him and youre like this is a bop???

**Shipsinker44** (8.5): Whenever i hear this song i think about that clip of Camila at her tour when the lights at her venue and she and the crowd start singing this song, its just so cute. I think on an album that has a lot of production faults, this is top 3 on the album in terms of the production just *clicking*. I also think the song does a really good job with its lyrics, being playful and being able to tell a good story with them.

**letsallpoo** (7): this is okay (even with the odd mixing) but dev outsold

---

**1998tweety** (11): This seems like a weird choice for an 11 but it was my favourite when the album dropped. I always see a lot of gay subtext (even though its obviously not there) and it ends up making me like the song even more. The bridge is really nice too.

**misterralex** (11): By far my favorite song on my album, I absolutely love everything about this song, the instruments, synths, background vocals and so much more. The prechorus on this song is legendary and the chorus is a nice change of pace which makes this song much more unique than other songs.

---

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This is a track that grew on me a lot since the album release, and theres something about it that works more than nearly every other track on the album, and its the personality the song has on the chorus, from both Camilas playful delivery and the little watery synths on the instrumental. Its a seriously underrated track.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): I'm feeling really...IDK, conflicted. The verse is nothing special, the bridge is great (although it sounds too much like mid-00s EDM) and the chorus is kind of a disappointment with the 'I, I's, although it's not too bad. I'd still consider this a good song, but it also reveals the flaws with Camila's songwriting.

**AnimationJava** (7.8): A song about seeking authenticity in her boyfriend, catchy and really cute.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9): GROSS SHOW ME THE SCARY PARTS BLEAUGH

**therandomsinger13** (9.2): Nice lyrics. Love the background vocals around 1:36. Like the bridge vocals.

**MissyBee37** (9): I really like this song. It's a neat idea & I love all the pieces, but especially the bridge! I looove the bridge, darling!

**eklxtreme** (8.5): this is very catchy and I actually like her vocals on this a lot

**jjs33072** (8.1): This song has grown on me so much, LOVE the chorus and production and the whole message of the song.

**dropthehammer11** (8): mmm

**Me-Luigi** (8): BOP!

**nahaalne** (8): The pre-chorus is great

**vayyiqra** (8): finally something good

**PeachPlumParity** (7.5): It's good but not great. I can stomach it for a while.

**twat\_brained** (7.1): The way Twitter was hyping this up made me think there was more to offer here.

**wailordfan\_** (7): This is pretty, but this is one of the few songs here that could very easily be a 5H song.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this is kinda boring

**luigi\_is\_better** (6): is this song about getting dicked down with the lights off

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (4): This prechorus let down is somehow bigger than the one from Look What You Made Me Do

**MrSwearword** (4): another shitty song about "fake friends". At least Camila is committed [whilst sucking]

**frogaranaman** (3): What the _fuck_ is this Great Value Chainsmokers production?

**Shipsinker44** (10): A cool, summery, tropical opening to Dua Lipa, this track is pure happiness. Somehow combining some chill production but loud vocals, it personally works for me here very well, and its always a pleasant experience listening to this song.

**letsallpoo** (7): I wish Dua did more with the Biblical theme here, but this is still a solid song and a perfect album opener.

---

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I really enjoy the symbolism here-there's actually a lot of biblical references on this album, which I find pretty interesting-and the fact that it's the first song we hear from Dua makes the title quite significant. As a song on its own, it's not as much of a bop as the ones to come-Dua's voice is a little flawed here, although its deepness manages to hook listeners in-but it does just fine for an opener.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Really interesting album opener. It's got a belter of a chorus on it. I can imagine myself wrecking my voice trying to sing along to at a concert. I love the funk guitar in the background.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): My favorite Christian pop song

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): invented the bible. Historians are shook

**skargardin** (8): Queen of creation

**wailordfan\_** (8): TBH she kinda invented religion here.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7.5): Invented the old testament, God is shaking. Lowkey a bop

**vayyiqra** (8): wait aren't Albanians mostly Muslim anyway queen of Biblical hermeneutics and synth ballads

**luigi\_is\_better** (4): no christian propaganda here please dua we're all gays

**twat\_brained** (9.4): Great first song but I feel like it'd be more of a statement with a video attached to this.

**1998tweety** (8.7): This is a very very good opener.

**TheShineSoul** (8.5): Such a great opener to the album

**CanadianSkeleton** (8): Best choice for the opening track

**cyborglilith** (8): I can listen to the grimes version of this song at any time, but I have to be in a happy mood (l o l) for this one.

**eklxtreme** (8): the chorus is so catchy over that simple rhythm

**PeachPlumParity** (8): This song is a great start to the album but I can't give it a ten because other songs on here are even better and basically flawless.

**Me-Luigi** (7.3): a good opener!

**jjs33072** (7.2): Great opener, sets a tone, showing off her great vocals and introducing some biblical imagery we see throughout the album.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Good ballad but the pacing of the delivery is weird

**Gatyto2002** (7): Religious things

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): Genny from the block

**MissyBee37** (7): I I like how she plays off the theme of "beginning" in the title & lyrics.

**MrSwearword** (7): solid opener but nothing special beyond that.

**AnimationJava** (6): A fitting title for an intro track, Genesis is a cute song about infatuation.

**frogaranaman** (5): Just like the Bible, this album opens up with Genesis! Also like the Bible, this album is overall meh and Im not a big fan.

**gannade** (5): a disappointing intro

**Shipsinker44** (9): I am so SHOCKED that this song is this low. I thought this song was the most beloved non-single on the album but apparently i am just as bad at gauging public reaction to a song as the rest of popheads (ily all but we know this is true). I am truly perplexed that this song was never released as a single back when Dua was doing well outside of America because it probably wouldve done really well. Maybe she’ll pull a britney radar and put it on DL2.

**letsallpoo** (10): This is a top three song on the album and I'm disgusted it's so low. Mirror and James were right to desert this rate.

---

**tapdancingpig** (0): This one is just bad. It's a bad fit for her voice, the melody is generic, which is a shame because the piano riff fits with the beat in fun ways.


---

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): THE MOST UNDERRATED DAMN SONG ON THE ALBUM IM BEGGING FOR YOUR DAY 3 INCLUSION

**luigi\_is\_better** (10): dua lipa's best song. i cant believe she had 47 singles and couldn't make this song one

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Oops, I think I needed to give this song more credit than I initially judged it for. Maybe the album's length made me tired enough to ignore it on my first few listens, but it actually fits in quite well into the last quarter of the album-upbeat and attention-grabbing, but clearly signalling the end.

**twat\_brained** (9): Much better than some of the other cuts on this album but not as impeccable as the singles on this album. Then again this is probably gonna go top 20 so I should go easier on Dua.

**SpanKKy1** (6): Im begging for shawn mendes to crush my skull between his thighs

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): i prefer pegging

**frogaranaman** (5): Me towards the desire to have universal healthcare in America.

**eklxtreme** (9.5): one of the best songs she has. it has everything I want in a dua song.

**therandomsinger13** (9): Smooth transition man! Chill bop. Love the bridge instrumental vocal sample thing. And the a cappella ish bit after. Nice.

**TheShineSoul** (9): This has grown a lot on me lately and now I love it. The chorus is so catchy.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): underrated good song

**MashLuke** (8.5): I love the piano segment

**1998tweety** (8.4): Another song where her lyrics stand out the most.

**AnimationJava** (8): Although the song is a bit repetitive, itís really cute.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Good album track. Probably would hold up as a single

**MrSwearword** (8): takes a bit to build up but it gets there

**Shipsinker44** (9): The third song in a streak of losses for her, this was Dua’s beautiful ballad. Her calming falsetto and her solid, soft mid range vocals mixed with a deep male voice in the background against a piano makes a song that will make you cry yourself to sleep, missing a lover you probably never had. If it helps Dua fans, there’s one more song to reveal today, and fortunately, Dua will be given a break.

**letsallpoo** (6): My sister was listening to this song a few months ago because she knows like nothing about pop music, so I asked her where she heard it from and she said her boyfriend had showed it to her. Later on I talked to him about Dua and I mentioned that I saw her live, and he started asking me about how she was live because apparently he tried watching her live videos on Youtube and he said she sounded pretty bad. Anyway I like bringing up this anecdote as evidence that the GP knows Dua is bad live and that Camila won.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i admire how the lyric when Im walking on water, all my dreams have come true is here right way before they filmed the New Rules music video. This song is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Yeah, I'd characterise this as the worst song on the album. The last thing I want from Dua is a super subdued track like this, and, really, the entire thing just outs me to sleep. I won't be surprised if this is her first song out-it's very different from the rest of the record, but in a bad way.

**dropthehammer11** (7): hi chris martin

**CarlieScion** (10): This song Chris Martin hidden-feature is so beautiful

**Me-Luigi** (10): Chris Martin should have been credited as a feature like he is on radio in my country where this was a single late last year, such a beautiful song, glad she delayed the album for this

**PeachPlumParity** (10): I love this song so much. I usually like slow songs, and this one is amazing. Also Chris Martin actually fits really well here, which is a welcome surprise considering all the shit music Coldplay has been releasing for like 8 years.

**MissyBee37** (9.5): I did not know until this rate that Chris Martin co-wrote & sang on this song but I'm not all that surprised because it's so beautiful & has that haunting Coldplay quality. Dua carries the emotion so well here and it's just so beautiful. Love the minimal piano.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): Damn Dua is the only one that can put Chris Martin on backing vocals and make us forget he's there

**OriginalKappa** (9): Sweet, even my Chris Martin-hating self can enjoy this one

**eklxtreme** (9.5): it's simply beautiful and always gets me in my feelings. the repeated "I wish I was there with you" line kills me inside 😭

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9): Sadness overcomes

**therandomsinger13** (9): They did this ordering right. Good song to calm me down. Also make me cry. Thanks Dula Peep.

**1998tweety** (8.3): Obligatory piano ballad, but it doesn't captivate me as much as her others.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This song is so sad wtf

**vayyiqra** (8): after all these dance-pop bangers I guess we needed a break anyway it's not very on-brand for her but I love piano ballads and duets so [shrug emoji]

**twat\_brained** (7.9): Never really been the ballad type but there's an evident charm to this song that just fills me with bliss.

**MrSwearword** (7): a lovely ballad but it's not measuring up to the definite highlights of the album

**AnimationJava** (6.4): Dua Lipaís first stab at a ballad, and itís actually really cute.

**Shipsinker44** (9): Unfortunately, this is Bebe’s last song in the rate, with her just BARELY missing Day 3. Tbh, Bebe’s two projects in this rate are a bit overhated and i think the stigma against these 2 EPs caused people to unfairly bring down the scores for the best songs on them. This is all me talking out of my ass because im just salty that this song didnt get higher than 16 and im quite sad to see bebe not even make day 3 :( she did worse than halsey and lana in their rate (who were also robbed)

**letsallpoo** (7): This song is cute. It has some crisp, pop production, an...interesting vocal performance, and a simple catchy hook. Bebe warranted it good enough (and overlooked enough) to stick on her debut LP Expectations. Maybe that will fare better when we inevitably rate it later, but if this song can't even get it to day 3 here, I have doubts.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): This had no right to flop as hard as it did. Fuck Despactio this should have been the 2017 song of the summer

**MissyBee37** (10): Easily one of my favorite Bebe songs! The chorus is so, so catchy. Love the beat & the music. I discovered this song on Expectations & it's one of my summer jams! It's a feel-good concept too. I got you, baby!

**RandomDKguy** (8): [Never forget the ICONIC FLUFFY "U"](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2YjChgpZkGM/maxresdefault.jpg)

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I do remember this rising and falling in the middle of charts about a year and a half ago, although it never made the Top 40. I listened to it once to see if it deserved to succeed and back then I thought of it as a bit clumsily made and disjointed; listening to it now, though, I wish it rose just a little higher. Some parts of it are pretty average, but in the end Bebe still uses her trusty songwriting skills to make a bop.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Before my inbox is spammed by perverts, Ive never liked this song, theres just really not anything about it that is remarkable in any way, sorry everyone

**strawberryswing1** (6): this song is such a desperate attempt to become relevant and chart. the lyrics are so bland and generic it almost hurts, but she does pair it with a beat that manages to make the song catchy. not a song i'd reach for on my own, but a love-hate one when i hear it.

**wailordfan\_** (4): The melody in the verses seem super old and like it's been used hundreds of times before, plus there is a shit ton of vocal editing done here, and in general in this EP and I am already tired of her voice.

**vayyiqra** (9): this has a fire intro and a killer hook, even with her trademark yodelling. I think of this as her signature song for some reason?? (even though we know it's Bad Bitch of course)

**twat\_brained** (8.9): Great choice for a single

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Chorus is catchy, verses are average

**therandomsinger13** (8.5): Was this on the radio? Why do I know this?

**ImADudeDuh** (8): verses arent that good but chorus still bops HARD

**PeachPlumParity** (8): This is a certified bop and I put it on my playlist

**skargardin** (8): I totally forgot that this was already on this EP so why include it on Expectations as well? girl wyd

**tapdancingpig** (8): What can I say? She snapped.

**AnimationJava** (7.5): Bebe gets bopping with a more intense banger, once again talking about her love in a positive light.

**dropthehammer11** (7): its a bop but a bit overrated. but still a bop

**lady\_sable** (7): this is very generic but the chorus is catchy

**MrSwearword** (7): the beat is catchy but Bebe, if you want to love someone you wouldn't want to get all low...ooh na na na

**rickikardashian** (6.8): This sounds like a Rihanna song written by an AI program

**ItsJustSketchyy** (6.5): I'm conflicted. I like the pre-chorus and the chorus, but I dislkike everything else.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (6.5): Annoying chorus but it gets stuck in your head

**rosesmp3** (6): oh na na na

**jjs33072** (5.4): Worst song on the EP, but honestly still a bop and deserved better

**OriginalKappa** (5): This is dumb stuff I would tune out if I was listening to the radio but it's not the worst

**frogaranaman** (4): She sounds like a dying goat in this song.

**gannade** (4): Her voice is awful on this. yoUUUUuUUUuUUooUUuOuouUOUOuouUUOOU

**dramiaa** (2): Why the fuck does her voice sound like that

shipsinker44: bebes career is unpredictable we werent gonna change the rate to have an album that we all thought had a big chance to be “indefinitely delayed” aka scrapped and she’d have to make seven more EP’s

~~there’s like 4 good songs on that album anyway~~

MissyBee37: Nooooooooooooooo. I'm sad to see this song out already, but I am happy it's the highest-rated Bebe song because I think it's her best showing in this rate. But man, it deserved better than to go out Day 2! This could've been Top 10.

letsallpoo: # All Your Fault Pt. 1

---

**Overall average**: 6.458

[All averages](https://pastebin.com/tJ6jypii)

Miss Rexha did her best. Everyone stream "I'm a Mess" now as reparation.

---

**Me-Luigi** (9.667): Urban pop cohesive perfection 

**TheShineSoul** (8.500): Full of BANGERS 

**tapdancingpig** (7.950): You know, Expectations isnt a perfect album, but when I listened to that album, I knew exactly who Bebe Rexha was as a pop artist. That is not the case here. Her lyrics are great here, and there are some damn good moments, but... lets just say Im really glad that a full sized AYF wasnt her debut. 

**vayyiqra** (7.500): let's go bad bitches 

**Leixander** (7.500): i thought I would drag this but guess what, it is... better than average 

**MashLuke** (7.500): fine 

**dropthehammer11** (7.000): actually good lmao i expected to not like it 

**Discord_and_Dine** (7.000): It's great when it's great and awful when it's awful. It's at its worst when she tries to be a thug. 

**jjs33072** (6.950): Second favorite album on the list, wish you would have included expectations tho that would be my favorite. 

**MissyBee37** (6.750): Part 1 is so much better than its follow-up. I think there's a much stronger theme throughout this one and it shows the promise (a *prophecy*, if you will) of how great her songwriting is on *Expectations*. Seriously, everybody, go listen to *Expectations*! 

**Banananaise** (6.750): solid 7 album... just not a fan of the style 

**AnimationJava** (6.233): An overall average album, highlights being I Got You and Bad Bitch. Not much else of note. 

**JanuraryFourteenth** (6.167): 6.5 Yeah it’s a good album/EP but also the guest rappers bring it down. 

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.083): I was actually liking this EP for the first half of it (which lasts for, like, what? Eight minutes?) but then G-Eazy raps about signing titties and it all goes downhill from there. She does a good enough job for what it's worth, but eventually you get what she's trying to do and it just falls flat; you have to be exciting to be a pop star, and you can already guess what Bebe's going to do for the rest of her EPs very quickly after you've listened to a few tracks from them. I do love the cover, though. 

**PeachPlumParity** (6.033): I mean it was ok. I guess it's about as good/bad as sweetener but with less highs and not as many lows. 

**ItsJustSketchyy** (5.483): Pt.1 > Pt.2, all I can say really. 

**mudkip1** (5.167): this gives me second hand embarrassment for the most part sorry hun thanks for doing an ama with us 

**selegend** (5.167): I Donít Wanna Grow Up EP >>>>>>>>> the rest of her discography 

**CarlieScion** (4.833): bebe u cant just put a rap feature on a song and then say its done girl!!!! 


**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4.333): no 

**luigi_is_better** (4.250): i honestly don't understand people enjoying this album more than pt 2. bebe's voice just sounds unbearable in most songs and small doses is one of the worst songs of the past decade. it's been one year that ive listened to this album and i legit didn't come back to any of these songs. easily the worst of the rate 

**MrSwearword** (4.000): Minimal vocal potential over "I'm such a bad bitch, right you guys?" kinds of beats. 

**TragicKingdom1** (3.917): [This writeup applies to both AYFs] I like Bebe as a personality and she has a more compelling voice than Camila or Zara imo. I Don't Wanna Grow Up and Expectations are both good projects. But this...this is different. I don't know what happened, but something possessed Bebe and forced her to make the blandest pure pop music of the year. The range here, with the exception of "Meant To Be," is from generic, boring trop pop to actively terrible trap pop. There's such little craft in the songwriting that it makes me wonder how Bebe broke through in the industry based on her songwriting. The production is limp and lifeless. But the worst part about this is how you could at least slap some dumb, repetitive choruses on here with the slightest bit of effort and half the songs would become listenable. That's how "Meant To Be" ended up being the best song on here. Anyways, this is just an insultingly terrible listening experience all around. [Grade: D] 

**lilacsweetener** (3.833): I'm really not a fan of Bebe's sound at all. This EP was better than Part 2, though. 

**OriginalKappa** (3.333): OK sorry but if this was a standalone project it would be one of the worst things ever. Nothing good is on this. 

**frogaranaman** (2.000): I cant imagine thisll be wildly good.
