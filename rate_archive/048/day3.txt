**Shipsinker44** (10): TBH this song has always been a staple for me when I want to make a summer playlist. The production sounds really fresh and we'll made and Bebe's voice fits perfectly.

---
**Me-Luigi** (10): ..Bebe's vocal and her own vocal arrangement sound so fresh.. the worldwide smash hit we deserved

**PuggleMaster** (10): SKINNY

**TheShineSoul** (10): Bebe sounds amazing on this, she completely makes the song.

**1998tweety** (9.1): Lowkey hated this song at first but it has grown on me.

**eklxtreme** (9): bebe rly goes off when she wants to

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): this is peak squeaky soprano

**Needlesslyrics** (9): club banger

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Pretty good start to the bonus rate right here. It's sad that this is the best Bebe song I've listened to that's not on Expectations, despite not even being in the context proper, but unfortunate placing aside, this is quite good; I like what Garrix does when he combines the overarching production with her vocals.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.5): A song shows that shows Bebes vocals with great production

**cyborglilith** (8): memorable

**frogaranaman** (8): The drop sounds like a hummingbird is orgasming.

**vayyiqra** (8): alright this rate is long and I'm doing this in one sitting because I go hard like that and these bonus tracks are not necessary but this is alright kinda generic idk

**jjs33072** (7.9): Bebe really out here doing that with Martin

**tapdancingpig** (7.9): I’m not a big fan of the actual drop with the pitched up vocal, but I love every other part of the song so much.

**hikkaru** (7): I actually like Bebe's vocals on this but the drop doesn't do much for me personally (do the edm rate in december! :kisskiss:)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This isnt even the best Martin Garrix song in the bonus tracks section of this rate

**twat\_brained** (7): Of the two Martin Garrix songs in this rate, this is the lesser one. Largely because Bebe does not possess the vocal chops Dua possesses.

**wailordfan\_** (7): Eh, Dua had the better Martin Garrix duet here.

**static\_int\_husp** (6): kinda boring

**Leixander** (5): too generic even for pop music

**MissyBee37** (5): I love half of this song; I hate the other half. This part that Genius calls the "breakdown," I can't stand. But I love Bebe's verses and the actual chorus, and the harmonies added near the end. Pretty lyrics.

**rotating3Dtext** (5): it hurts me. I remember when I had to change the radio station everytime this started

**Glennishill** (4): Oof. What makes Bebe Rexha even worse? EDM

**luigi\_is\_better** (3): the worst martin garrix collab in the rate

**ImADudeDuh** (2): Don't @ me but this is the most annoying drop in EDM recently

**MrSwearword** (1): As The Supremes once sang, STOP in the name of Love

**Shipsinker44** (8): Nicki is the best part of the song and Bebe is very underused

---
**Me-Luigi** (10): the chorus is just amazing, bebe really snapped and deserved to be credited upfront, this is just one of Guetta's best songs.. the trap-edm worked well and it didn't really age badly like some of his other songs, nicki goes hard as fuck on this

**1998tweety** (9): Nick's first 2 verses are honestly a little forgettable but she goes off on the last one and Bebe gets you hyped.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): The inferior Nicki / Bebe collab

**eklxtreme** (8.5): bebe's chorus is the best part of this and the edm instrumental still sounds dope

**tapdancingpig** (8.4): Parts of this song make me really uncomfortable (Nicki... no. You are not a submissive housewife), but the hook is excellent, Nicki sounds great, and Nicki’s actual rap is a lot of fun.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): This is a David Guetta and Nicki Minaj collab, a tag team which usually provides some absolute fucking jams. Hell, I just heard Turn Me On on the radio this morning and I was reminded of how great these two are together. So why is Bebe the scene stealer here? Probably because she's actually doing something with the vocals, unlike Bebe.

**Leixander** (8): guilty pleasure

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I LOVED this song when I was a very young teenager, since it was a great, dirty bop; I felt bad for liking it because I wasn't quite sure whether the lyrics were cheeky or not. Now I'm sure they are, but the song isn't as fun to hear anymore as it was in 2015 (?). The production is less energetic than I presumed it to be. Also, I originally thought Nicki sang the chorus, so yikes.

**TheShineSoul** (8): Again Bebe makes the song.

**vayyiqra** (8): hey this is a bop wtf it's dominated by Nicki though

**wailordfan\_** (8): I remember the drama that ensued when she wasn't credited and everyone legit thought that was Nicki singing the chorus. Nicki went all the way off.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7.7): Nicki kinda outsold Bebe in this. I don't know why in this and In The Name of Love that her voice is so high pitch, like Bebe is screaming.

**jjs33072** (7.2): I forgot how much I loved this song until listening to it now

**cyborglilith** (7): omg nicki has such amazing range!!!!

**frogaranaman** (7): Wait, Bebe is actually in this song..?

**hikkaru** (7): Bebe's hook is really good but I don't really like the rest that much (do the edm rate in december! :kisskiss:)

**Needlesslyrics** (7): Bebe is genuinely the star of this, so much better than her feature on Girls

**MissyBee37** (6): It's a shame Bebe wasn't initially credited for this song because I think she's the best part of it. I like Nicki's verses, too, and I think they mesh well together. Bebe's chorus is catchy!

**rotating3Dtext** (6): these lyrics are so odd for nicki, I swear. oh and bebe is there too

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Not sure what it is, but this song has always sounded like if you took all the Fast and Furious soundtracks together and blended them to get one song

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (5): being a David Guetta song, I kept anticipating a massive buildup to a drop. Instead the only thing that dropped was my balls and they were blue when Im pickin it up, Im picking it up, Im lovin Im pickin it up

**luigi\_is\_better** (3): if i did the rate a month ago i wouldve said that nicki did that (carried the good parts of this song) but yeah im good. so overplayed in my country to the point that im biased as fuck srry

**MrSwearword** (1): David Guetta on an off day production wise, Nicki attempting vocals and some of those being "Yes I'll do the cooking, Yes I'll do the cleaning" and "Yes you be the boss/Yes I'll be respecting/whatever that you tell me/cuz it's game you be spitting" and Bebe's boring almost missing presence makes this reek of suck.

**Shipsinker44** (1): I would like to apologize to the sub. I know y'all love this song a lot, especially one of the rate hosts. While Dua slays, I hate the production, and I will probably never ever listen to this song again until 15 years later when I forget what this song sounded like and discover my hate for it all again. The only reason is isn't a 1 is because I heard it at the beach one day and it wasn't a bad sunny day song.

**letsallpoo** (10): My personal song of the summer. Most EDM songs are described as the producer providing a canvas for whatever vocalist, but here it feels distinctly the opposite, where Dua's fairly anonymous voice acting as a backdrop to Calvin's quirky production. It's discordant but fun - something unique in both of their discographies. "Scared to Be Boring" did not deserve!

---
**1998tweety** (10): Pop perfection

**eklxtreme** (10): THE summer anthem. what a perfect combo.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): S U M M E R A N T H E M

**MrSwearword** (10): it took me several listens from release day to this rate for me to warm up to this but in the end, Calvin Harris made a banger and thank CHRIST Dua said yes to this and slayed on this.

**Needlesslyrics** (10): from the UK so i'm contractually obliged to like this

**rickikardashian** (10): Idk how this didn't do better in the IS, this bitch was inescapable

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): An amazing song through and through. Everything about the thumping house beats and Duas vocals and infectious chorus makes this one of her best songs. Undeniably the song of the summer (Drake who?)

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I'm definitely a huge fan of Calvin Harris's recent work, and, wow, this is an excellent throwback to 90s house. This is a kind of rhythmic that you don't hear often anymore and it pays off big time. The glitchy synth throughout the song is great and it's worthy as more chill version of Blow Your Mind.

**TheShineSoul** (9): It should and will be the song of this summer.

**vayyiqra** (9): this is fluff but it bops hard af, Calvin Harris is still acceptable in the 2010s

**jjs33072** (8.2): This song has grown on me so much as well

**tapdancingpig** (8.2): I live in America, the one place in the world where this song is escapable, because apparently we hate fun. It’s a little too repetitive, but I’ll take it over our current top 10.

**Gatyto2002** (8): Contagious

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This track really grew on me, I want more 90s House Dua.

**twat\_brained** (8): Is it a great song? No. Is it Dua or Calvin's best song? No. Has it been overplayed? If anything, I've been the one to overplay it. No other song this summer has had the replay value, radio-friendliness or crowd-pleasing qualities that One Kiss has. So I don't understand why we failed it on the hot 100 when it topped so many other charts.

**Me-Luigi** (7.5): the vocal delivery is so unenthusiastic.. but it bangs thanks calvin

**luigi\_is\_better** (7): when this song was released i really really really hated it. but after listening accidently on radio/streams/just internet in general i became fond of it.

**MissyBee37** (7): I'm still surprised this is a big hit because I think it's just kind of flat but it's a fun beat from Calvin, and Dua delivers a pretty vocal, so I can't be mad at it. I just wish it built more or had more variation.

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): There's honestly something missing in this song, and I don't know what

**frogaranaman** (6): This song evokes the feeling that H&M is trying to rush you out of their store via the tempo of the songs being played.

**ItsJustSketchyy** (6): Can someone explain to me why she looks so bored in the MV?

**Leixander** (6): nice but dua&calvin could make a better bop

**wailordfan\_** (6): This. Miss Dua can keep this one.

**hikkaru** (5): idk, I just prefer my summer bops to be actual bops. This is just kinda uninteresting and it doesn't go anywhere (do the edm rate in december! :kisskiss:)

**cyborglilith** (1): LOL

**Shipsinker44** (8): issa bop, I actually prefer the acoustic version

**letsallpoo** (7): one kiss outsold

---
**eklxtreme** (10): this was the song that kinda made me realize that Dua would be here to stay. it's what made me realize how special her voice was.

**misterralex** (10): One of the best songs to display Dua Lipa's vocals, I think this song was the one that showed me the maximum potential of her voice.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Fun fact: this was definitely the first Dua song I ever heard, during a brief period early last year when I decided to listen to the radio again (a period which lasted about a week). I'm sad it didn't do very well chartwise, because it shows how good Dua's deep voice is for EDM features; this somehow manages to be chilling both outside and when you're listening to it by yourself.

**twat\_brained** (10): Holy fuck this was the absolute SHIT live I will never fail to headbang like an absolute EDM raver to this

**wailordfan\_** (10): This would easily be the 11 of this bonus rate. Acoustically it is stunning, with full production it will fuck you up and down the dance floor while making you cry from loneliness. I love love love it.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9.4): Dua does it again on this track, the lyrics are sharp and get too real at times (does Dua know how my last relationship went down wtf), its almost perfect but sometimes the production doesn't really work, its small but enough to make this not a 10.

**frogaranaman** (9): The exact imagery for this song is wearing an airy outfit while standing out in Icelandic nature plains, wind blowing to the cameras left while you stare into your on/off again significant others eyes and wonder why neither of you cant get your feelings for each other under control and love unconditionally.

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): the best Martin Garrix collab in the rate; probably my favorite song out of the bonus ones. the acoustic version is just heavenly.

**Me-Luigi** (9): very good and strong vocals and an amazing drop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Might be my favorite Martin Garrix song ever? Everything about this is just so nice.

**TheShineSoul** (9): Not as good as ITNOL but still great

**1998tweety** (8.9): The beat drop on this sounds so different from what I usually hear.

**jjs33072** (8.2): Love the work that Martin is doing with our Pop Girlies

**hikkaru** (8): it's a nice song, I'm not a big fan of the skitters during the verses but the prechorus and drop are very pretty! (do the edm rate in december! :kisskiss:)

**static\_int\_husp** (8): I think we can all agree that Martin Garrix is the real winner of the Bonus rate. Two huge collabs with soon to be main pop girls.

**tapdancingpig** (7.8): OH RIGHT DUA TRACKS CAN BE GOOD. Not in love with the drop, but everything else is great. Dua delivers one of her best vocals ever.

**ItsJustSketchyy** (7.5): This is really the only song that I enjoy Dua's voice in, pls no hate.

**vayyiqra** (7): solid EDM banger and normally I hate when there's a half-tempo drop it's so cliche but this is alright

**MrSwearword** (1): not even with Dua on this can Martin Garrix make something good.

**Shipsinker44** (4): Zara may be the first loser of the third day, but its no failure to make it to the top 15! Zara shows off her rapping skills in this song and tbh they actually arent that bad. Aint my Fault is a shining gem in her discography and i feel like it perfectly deserves the spot it gets in this rate. Im actually disappointed in myself though, i did NOT give this song a good score and i very very much regret it. I dont change my mind very often after sending in scores but if anything deserves a 2nd chance it would definitely be one of zaras best songs.

**letsallpoo** (10): Queen of invading personal space. Queen of victim blaming. Queen of calling an Uber, which is right outside.

---

**CreepyMannequin** (11): What an incredible BOP.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): Brothers Osbourne are NOT shaking https://twitter.com/brothersosborne/status/867868467411775488

**PeachPlumParity** (0): I would give it a negative score if I could

---

**hikkaru** (6): Zara is the queen of both rapping and uber, but wow does the concept of this song suck. The female Blurred Lines may slap but when listening to the lyrics it makes me very uncomfortable, so I'm not even really sure what to rate this.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9.5): This is fucking amazing, a god damn BOP!!! People say this is problematic but I don't really see it. This just bops through and through, the way she carries her voice with the production rising and the beat dropping with that highnote :kimbryell:. Queen of Ubers. Hype all around

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): It seems like people generally agree that this isn't really all that problematic, so even if I do think some aspects of the lyrics are worth a few comments over I won't get into them. I personally like this despite the fact that it kind of barely manages to put its messiness together (I'd actually say the chaos ends up being quite appealing). The handclaps throughout the song really elevate it.

**vayyiqra** (8): wasn't this the name of Bebe Reptar's album anyway this album is starting to feel long and getting samey but I never tire of electro bangers so keep 'em coming

---

**PuggleMaster** (7): cash me outside

**rickikardashian** (6): That post that said there was a voice that sounded like the Cash me ousside, howbodah has ruined this entire song gOD. Thats all I hear

**therandomsinger13** (7.5): It’s all Bebe’s fault.

**RandomDKguy** (10): QUEEN OF UBER

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): problematic bop

**1998tweety** (9.5): A problematic bop (which you guys seem to overlook), but a bop nonetheless. This song is hook after hook after hook.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): ...problematic bop?

letsallpoo: 





**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): The most Rihanna song Rihanna never recorded

**dramiaa** (10): Had this stuck in my head for like a month

**eklxtreme** (10): the ultimate slut bop. amazing production and infectious chorus.

**TheShineSoul** (10): This gets me hyped EVERY TIME, such a great song.

**cyborglilith** (9.5): so if I put your ass where my eyes can see

**Me-Luigi** (9): this is a fucking bop, I love the alternate version even more because fuck men, MNEK really saved this album

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Really fun, catchy bop. I kind of hate the repeated "no"s over the chorus/drop, though.

**frogaranaman** (8): I thought this was a Fifth Harmony song.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Interesting concept, not quite sure if she pulls it off

**ulikejazz** (8): Its a bit messy and somehow cheap-sounding but I like this

**CanadianSkeleton** (7.5): None of my friends like this one but I think its decent

**ItsJustSketchyy** (7.2): I just wish it had a little something more, it could have been a 10 for me.

**OriginalKappa** (7): Those really nasal synths suck and sabotage what could be a great song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This drop is nice but the commentary throughout this track is so uninteresting

**twat\_brained** (7): The saxophone riff is really cool and is one of the redeeming parts of this song. I can't advocate for the lyrics, they make Zara seem irresponsible and immature.

**jjs33072** (6.1): Once again, another bop with a great r3hab remix

**Leixander** (5.5): is this never forget you pt.2

**JanuraryFourteenth** (5): It’s your fault that the album goes kinda off the rails after this

**luigi\_is\_better** (5): can we please just delete this song from her discography and pretend it never happened thanks

**MrSwearword** (5): production >>>>>>>>>> "vocals" on this for sure

**Raykel** (5): I mean it slaps but I don't even need to explain why the lyrics are bad

**Shipsinker44** (10): I have been dragged for this countless times. I have been called rude names by popheads users. I have been cancelled for this. I have been DISCRIMINATED against for this. But you know what. IDGAF! This song is legit my most played Dua song and is in my top ten most scrobbled songs ever on Last.fm This track has simple production but amazing replay value. Its the best song for any situation, be it chilling in bed and sing-talking the pre choruses, being at a party and screaming i dont give a fuck. Maybe you wanna send this to an ex lover, a bad friend, or maybe your aunt deborah is REALLY just grinding your gears and you need to yell the chorus. Whatever it is, i truly believe this is one of the best songs to come out of 2017 and nobody is going to change my mind on that. Dua doesnt try to go to deep with her vocals, she doesnt try to go too high. The piano in the chorus and the chanting at the same part gives this song a chameleon effect where it can slip into any playlist. Im honestly so sad that this song is this low because its really a perfect song.

**letsallpoo** (3): This was such a bizarre followup to "New Rules" and I really don't understand the logic behind it. It's not like there were a lot of single-worthy songs left on the album, but why not something like "Begging," or anything that won't be heavily censored when it's on the radio? The track lacks a lot of the intricacies that made "New Rules" such a fantastic song, and instead just has...pointless cursing? A lame guitar instrumental? The video is also kinda bad - the choreo is so awkward, and nothing happens. [I must admit the single cover is a bit of a slay tho.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/IDGAF_cover.png)

---
**static\_int\_husp** (11): cathartic

**therandomsinger13** (11): This song is so good, such a bop, so badass. I highly recommend you listen to the version on YouTube with the original in one ear and Panic! At the Disco’s cover in the other. It’s heavenly.

**luigi\_is\_better** (0): yeah

---

**rickikardashian** (8.7): I truly believe that IDGAF would have done better and stuck more with the public hadn't it been released as a single after Hurricane New Rules. Maybe closing the era with this instead of NW was a bit of a bad decision, but it still bangs so I forgive her.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): A review on Wikipedia characterised this as having almost militaristic production, and I agree-this song sounds like a rallying cry, which makes it no wonder why they decided to release it after New Rules. Maybe listening to it while your parents are around can be a pain, but this is definitely a song that can bring people into Dua's standom.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7.9): A good song, but other songs are better. I get why she made this a single but like after a few listens, I realized that its not that great as how popheads has talked about it :kim:. People are going to say that this is a 9 or a 10, but I can't relate.

**MissyBee37** (9): This song had to grow on me, but I love it now! I love that it's confident & cool; she's just so smooth in this kiss-off. The guitar, punchy percussion and the boldness to just say "fuck" give it such a great energy.

**lady\_sable** (9): me talking to men

**agentofscranton** (7.5): an iconic tide pod video but an otherwise kinda boring song

letsallpoo: 

**Gatyto2002** (10): Get the fuck outta here

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this was SO close to being a top 40 hit :(

**PeachPlumParity** (10): This song is also flawless and it's better than New Rules too bad the MV isn't as iconic

**PuggleMaster** (10): The talent that exudes from this song

**tapdancingpig** (10): I love this song so much. It's the perfect kiss off, the chorus is perfectly chantable, and it's absolutely amazing to dance to.

**1998tweety** (9.3): Ugh this bops so hard

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): No nonsense

**eklxtreme** (9): rly fun and iconic lyrics

**RandomDKguy** (9): No MØ/Charli/Alma/Zara solo 9/10 though

**vayyiqra** (9): lol this is savage, anthem for millennial serial ghosters like me

**twat\_brained** (8.3): I appreciate Dua's

**CanadianSkeleton** (8): One of my favorites before it even was a single

**dropthehammer11** (8): so i cut you OFF

**frogaranaman** (8): If Elio was born in the late 90s, I swear this would be his fucking jam while he still cries over Oliver. The story also wouldnt work because of the advent of the internet, but my point still stands.

**gannade** (8): i hated this but the radio made me love it tbh. A great sing along song

**OriginalKappa** (8): At points comes across as kind of forced and I generally don't like pop songs with acoustic guitar bases but this is still really fun

**AnimationJava** (7.1): Dua Lipa turns off the vulnerability and becomes empowered, with a catchy pop beat.

**cyborglilith** (7): uncensored version is a 3 though

**hikkaru** (7): Not my favourite song, but I think it just barely missed the year-end hot 100 for 2018. Dua deserves :sadgery:

**Me-Luigi** (7): this song is tired sorry dua

**MrSwearword** (7): production and song do not match at all. However, the chorus is kind of booming.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): overrated! the chorus is nice and anthemic but the verses are really tedious

**wailordfan\_** (7): It's a fun fuck off song, but is kinda a shallow song content wise, and the production is kinda lacking.

**Leixander** (6): nice video but a meh song

**TheShineSoul** (6): Definitely one of the weakest songs, it grew on me after being a single but it's still mediocre compared to the rest.

**jjs33072** (4.8): Once again, nothing sticks out.

**selegend** (4): Imagine choosing THIS over Bibling. the nerve

**JanuraryFourteenth** (3): Maybe Dua Lipa isn’t for me, but like how was this the second hit.

**Shipsinker44** (8): A deluxe edition track, this song is literally Dua’s BEST song to play at a party (with people who actually knows it exists.) because it really gets people up and dancing. You can act like a complete fool going crazy to it but nobody cares because theyre going crazy too. Tbh i dont even like the song THAT much but it is great for this situation.

**letsallpoo** (10): Any song that features a dying, asthamtic goat on its EDM breakdown deserves no lower than a 10.

---
**PeachPlumParity** (11): Wig. Gone to Pluto. I fucks with this song so hard we had a child and named it Dua after this goddess.

---


**CarlieScion** (10): The "WE WERE BUILT TO LAST - WE WERE BUILT LIKE THAT" medically killed me dead the first time I listened to this song. Also the drop works surprisingly well

**JanuraryFourteenth** (10): A good ending for a good album

**Leixander** (10): underrated!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a motherfucking slut-drop worthy anthem

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): An emotional bop and a great ending to the deluxe album, personally I prefer this more to Homesick, but I understand why Homesick was chosen instead.

**TheShineSoul** (10): SO EUPHORIC I LOVE IT. THE BRIDGE IS GREAT. SHOULD HAVE BEEN A HIT.

**twat\_brained** (10): I love the instrumentation on this song and it truly makes me feel like dancing like it was for the last time. Not many artists can do that!

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): Great unexpected drop - bold choice to end an album on

**eklxtreme** (9): that last drop with the strong note is incredible

**Me-Luigi** (9): that drop! y'all really chose the best deluxe songs for this album to win didn't yeah

**therandomsinger13** (8.5): I just accidentally rated Bad Together as this song and now I can’t think straight.

**1998tweety** (8.4): A good album closer.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Dua Lipa works so well on dancier beats, Im surprised we dont have Dua Lipa with more EDM collabs

**vayyiqra** (8): also a good bop how is this album so consistently good like I've heard it several times before but relistening for this rate is making me into a stan tbh

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): We finally reach the end of the album, and instead of a ballad, as you'd expect, Dua's debut ends with a huge banger that's maybe a little too on the nose. I'm not a huge fan of it (I can't even understand what she's saying that well) but apparently some people are. It's still good enough for me to give a couple of soins or so.

**dropthehammer11** (7): a song

**MrSwearword** (7): pretty good way to close the album, but I would've liked slightly more energy for a song called "Last Dance"

**tapdancingpig** (6.5): Better than the other b-side, but not as good as the highlights of the rest of the album.

**AnimationJava** (6): An okay ending to her debut, Dua concludes her remembrance of her relationship by talking about her last dance.

**wailordfan\_** (6): Hm. I found my least favorite track of the album, and it is the album closer. That's honestly kinda super disappointing.

**frogaranaman** (5): Me, right after Dua tells me this is her last dance: Thank you for putting me out of my misery.

**jjs33072** (4.7): Album closes off poorly, wish we got a strong power ballad

**Shipsinker44** (6.5): Shes not a psychic and neither are yall for thinking this would be beating the superior camila tracks she loves control and havana, smh. Into It was definitely a fan favorite when the album first released and if released as a single it would PROBABLY do okay, although tbh i would hate that because its not that good of a song! This track has a very atmospheric vibe and beat to it, with the sharp dark opening bringing you into the club lounge where you see a cut boy in the corner and become smitten and ready for anything. I dont know what any of that means but i feel like it accurately describes the feeling i get from this song.

**letsallpoo** (10): Easily the best nonsingle from Camila's alberm (mostly cause it's not a ballad and because it sounds like they spent more than 20 minutes mixing it) and a wonderful closing song. It's snappy and flirtatious, and I think it displays Camila's personality and vocal quirks perfectly.

---
**jjs33072** (11): WOW one of my favorite songs of 2018. Love the bluntness of the chorus (I see your king-size bed in the corner we should get into it) and the production switching from the verses to the chorus. Love the "ahoooooooo"'s and this song reminds me of sober by lorde which is one of my favorite songs of 2017.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): And now for the most underrated track. The production on this monster just deserves so much praise, the synths are so futuristic and the drums have so much oomph, crashing and crashing, all building up to that beautiful release that is the oturo. I love the woos and I love how Camila makes the song truly feel like a closer, and I can see the credits roll, especially near the end. Its easily one of my favorite pop songs of the year and my favorite in this rate.

---

**Me-Luigi** (10): This is what I imagine a carly x lorde x ariana collab would sound like like it's so good, her mind

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): if Lorde loves this, i love it

**rickikardashian** (10): Okay I know the fan fave was decided to be She Loved Control, but God this is perfection. The intro and the first lines loosened up my wig, and the chorus straight up stole it from me.

**SpanKKy1** (10): literally invented consensual sex

**frogaranaman** (4): This definitely exudes straight girl who cannot handle more than a light slap on the ass during sex vibes.

---

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): This is a Walmart Sober, no question about it. Like, Camila even has Sober on one of her playlists, so...well, even if it is a shameless ripoff, it steals a great song to get a beat from, so even if I deduct a point and a half from it, it still gets a pretty good score.

**LiabilityPlaces** (6.5): Sounds like a copy of HD and Sober by Lorde so

**lilacsweetener** (6): It's hot, but feels disjointed too. Like 3 songs in one. Very Lorde-esque. I enjoy it if it comes on shuffle, but never seek it out.

**1998tweety** (10): Sza verse + IDWLF pre-chorus. It ends up working. I could definitely see this being a single.

**hikkaru** (10): Such a fun song! I love the wordplay and Camila sells the sexiness of it surprisingly well

**Needlesslyrics** (10): into you is arianas best song and into it is camilas best song

**PeachPlumParity** (10): Tens tens tens across the board. Excellent song, I want to get into bed with Camila for this song.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9.5): Aye I am into it.

**twat\_brained** (9.4): I don't even have to listen to this multiple times; I'm into it 😉

**ItsJustSketchyy** (9): I mean...

**skargardin** (9): Underappreciated bop, the perfect song to close the album with.

**TheShineSoul** (9): Fun song, my favourite here definitely. It doesn't do anything new but it's just great.

**therandomsinger13** (8.9): Nice beat.

**cyborglilith** (8.5): < all these years

**eklxtreme** (8.5): it's an odd closer, but it's an earworm and I like the production

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I'm amused by the differ ways she uses the title

**tapdancingpig** (8): It took a while for this to grow on me, but its incredibly catchy and fun.

**vayyiqra** (8): this is a lowkey bop still this album is underwhelming as hell, I miss 5H, it's a shame their last album was their worst but anyway this album is an acceptable debut just nothing to write home to Havana about

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): ooOOOoo

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): a little repetitive

**AnimationJava** (7): All about sex, Camila gets hot and steamy for the first time in her last track.

**MashLuke** (6.5): yeah, not that much

**CarlieScion** (6): The intro lyrics and the weird flow in her singing makes this lose so many points

**MrSwearword** (6): I'll be nice and say that the beat is too upbeat given how surprisingly "dark" the album tried to be.

**luigi\_is\_better** (5.5): the "uuuuuh" from the beginning is the best part and that's kinda telling. also very weird to have this as a closer

**wailordfan\_** (5): It's cute, but I don't have any plans on replaying it again. It turns out this album is VERY front loaded.

**Shipsinker44** (10): And another Camila track bites the dust… This is Camila’s most streamed non-single track and her stubborn ass refuses to make it one and she has missed her chance to make it a summer single and she is a horrible nasty flop and i am NOT bitter. Anyway, this song is a bop and one of the better songs of her career.

**letsallpoo** (8): Every fanbase has that one song that everyone wanted as a single, yet never was for some reason. I think "She Loves Control" evaded an official release because of the similarities to "Havana" (they don't sound similar at all, just mildly Latin-inspired, and do you expect the GP to discern them?). Now that summer is over, I think it's officially over for this song - everyone stream "Beautiful" and "Real Friends" NOW!

---

**SpanKKy1** (11): serving dominatrix realness

**PuggleMaster** (0): I was expecting something......... more exciting? This was so boring considering popheads have been clamoring for this to be the next single

---

**rotating3Dtext** (10): WHY IS THIS NOT A SINGLE MAKE IT

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): fuck Sangria Wine, this song is skinnier

**perfumevee** (10): I agree with many others who think this should be a single!

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Digging the dancehall vibe with this once - good choice for a single

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): How was Sangria Wine her next single when this exists?

**TheShineSoul** (8): Banger, should have pushed this as a single instead of Sangria Wine.

**hikkaru** (9): I'm so happy Sangria Wine flopped while this song stays winning with its 100m+ organic Spotify streams. The summer bop that deserved

**PeachPlumParity** (9): Why no single you dumb bitch.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): A great summer bop! Deserves to be the next single!

**jjs33072** (8.1): THE single we all deserve tbh, love the latin vibe.

---

**MissyBee37** (7): I love this concept for a song. Awesome lyrics. But I just want something more from it... I don't know what, though. More energy? More passion? I don't know. But I don't feel the same fire from it as, say, "Havana." It feels like the "she" is someone who *likes* control rather than *loves* it, and maybe she doesn't quite have it yet.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): The summer single that got away, unfortunately; I wonder if this would have encouraged more Latin hits if she pushed it over Sangria Wine. Missed commercial potential aside, this is a great way for Camila to explore her Hispanic roots. It suits her image well in particular and I haven't heard a chorus this lively in a couple of years.

**rickikardashian** (9.5): I really believe that Camila was held at gunpoint while making this song, because she must hate it, considering her entire fanbase wanted this as a single, and she literally went and made a song not in her album a single before choosing this

**OriginalKappa** (7): I'm still so confused as to how this didn't become a worldwide hit. It pushes all the mainstream buttons and does it pretty well, and considering how well her other singles did, it's surprising.

**AnimationJava** (9): The track that bangs the hardest from Camila, SLC is a feminist anthem that every Camila fan knows by heart. Catchy, empowering, and fun.

**lady\_sable** (10): i'm actually shook by how much i love this omg

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This song is an absolute bop! I want to get up and dance everytime I hear it, and I'd love to see more from Camila in this direction in the future

**twat\_brained** (10): Sorry, I had to get up from my laptop and violently pop my bussy to this. No other song in this rate has made me do that. And surprisingly it won't get my 11.

**wailordfan\_** (10): Finally the first easy 10 of this rate.

**therandomsinger13** (9): Such a bop!

**1998tweety** (8.6): Don't get me wrong I like this song, but I feel like its missing the same kick Havana and NBTS had. The chorus blends too much with the verses and doesn't stand out enough.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): catchy as heck and absolutely deserves to be a single

**Leixander** (8.5): could be a good second single but alas

**luigi\_is\_better** (8.5): ok i get it camila stans y'all want this song to be a single we heard it enough (but i totally agree)

**Me-Luigi** (8.5): a massive bop!

**CarlieScion** (8): why does so many female artists refer to themselves as "she" in songs

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This song is quite overrated on this sub, but I will say, it probably went the hardest out of any song she did live, and the dancing is really fun.

**MrSwearword** (6): above par sexual liberation = empowerment effort. At least the track doesn't drag on.

**vayyiqra** (6): kinky I guess? but totally forgettable

**TragicKingdom1** (5): this doesn't excite me whatsoever and drags by the end. Sangria Wine is honestly a much more hype song

**CreepyMannequin** (4): This falls really flat for me. Dont get the hype.

**frogaranaman** (4): Not sure how reggaeton got more generic but it did.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): I love Pink and Sia - Waterfall

**lilacsweetener** (4): Trying too hard.

**cyborglilith** (3): Why should this be a new single instead of All These Years?

**gannade** (2): This song kinda just proves popheads has no taste. how is this a fan favorite. its literally an even whhiter version of Havana and its so monotonous.

**Shipsinker44** (7): Dula peeper really delivered with this song and the high position it gets in this rate is deserved for this singer-”songwriter”. Yet another single from her debut album, this song peaks higher on this rate than it did in any chart (except the netherlands!)

**letsallpoo** (8): Miguel and Dua is such an unusual pair, but they work surprisingly well together. While pretty much everything about the song is solid - the instrumental, the singing itself, the lyrics - it's not really...good in an exciting way? The beat is the "Style" one we've heard a hundred times over, and Dua and Miguel sound a tad phoned in. This placement is about right.

---
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): an 11

---

**frogaranaman** (10): Since I dont have many 10s in this rate at all, I will be using that comment space to highlight men that I think are 10s. In this edition... [Teddy!](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bk4H3WMAGis/) He is so fucking cute with his husband on Instagram and I love every second of them on my feed.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fucking QUEEEEN I first heard this song in the plug during the first showing of the popheads chart, but when i heard it, i was fucking hoooooooked.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I'll admit that I've never took the time to listen to Miguel despite hearing good things about him and liking his features with other artists, but this may just get me to stop procrastinating. This more up-tempo version of a ballad is beautiful, and it's hard to know who sings better, Dua or Miguel.

**MrSwearword** (8): Ma-DUA Carey here using Miguel as GRAMMY bait. Other than that mishap, the production and Dua's vocals are quite pleasing.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Honestly not my favorite single, I like both artists quite a bit but theres not much here that stands out, but its a good song.

**Needlesslyrics** (10): i'm in love with the way miguel says wOMAN. that is all.

**Shipsinker44** (8): I will never forget hearing this song for the first time, checking out the artists other songs, and immediately going back to my other music to save myself from the boredom. One of Zara’s best songs, the commanding vocals of Zara mesh well with the electronic production, and the drop gives a cute dance break moment. Lets be honest though, its kinda MNEK who carries the song on his shoulders, who seems better suited for the production. Nevertheless, Zara put aside her hatred for men to craft this song with MNEK, and it actually isnt Zara’s last song in this rate yet, so you zara stans stay tuned!

**letsallpoo** (9): @everyone preorder mnek's upcoming album NOW

---

**dropthehammer11** (11): this song is immaculate. the lyrics are simple, but passionate. MNEK does great, the hook and drop are excellent...fuck man i love this song a lot

---

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I know everyone likes this track but I really feel like it was damn dated when it dropped, and the drop just doesnt do anything for me, it sounds so bland like every other tropical drop except with decidedly less identity. In fact, it literally sounds similar to Where Are  Now except worse.

**therandomsinger13** (9.7): My sister and I did a super cringey cover mashup of this and WANEGBT that totally sucked the message out of it and I’ll never forgive myself for that. Despite that this is still a bop. Also MNEK slays I should look into him.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): This is a song packed with energy, especially considering that explosion and a drop. Zara is at her most upbeat here, which is a bit strange-the way this song sounds is at odds with the lyrics, which are quite melancholy, to say at least. At best this is a really heartbreaking separation. At worst, her boyfriend died.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): One of the bests songs this album, the opening where her voice is climbing :despair:. MNEK and Zara are sooo good together, he lowkey outsold her on this but it still bops! The ending duet when they're both reaching those highnotes :fallingdespair:.

**Glennishill** (6.5): This intro is like a fast Save as Draft and its freaking me out.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i remember listening to Beats 1 Radio in March 2016 when this dropped. She did THAT

**vayyiqra** (8): okay I thought MNEK was a K-pop girl group but anyway the production on this goes off so I can forgive the intrusion of some random dude onto my Nigerian WOC album

**Me-Luigi** (10): this is actually incredible and the performance of this in the US should have guaranteed some further relevancy, amazing production and vocals from MNEK as well


**OriginalKappa** (10): Absolute jam, love the breakdown. MNEK goes way too over the top with his delivery but that doesn't compromise a really enjoyable track.

**skargardin** (10): Might just be her best song tied with Lush Life

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): sad bop

**TheShineSoul** (10): Euphoric as shit, their voices work well together, both of them sound amazing and the bridge is incredible.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Was never a fan of the trap beats after the chorus; it feels out of place within the context of the song.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I know everyone loves this song to pieces and don't get me wrong it's great but I prefer Lush Life

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): I like MNEK but I’m not sure they duet together well

**MrSwearword** (8): the production and British Khalid here enhance the song greatly.

**Shipsinker44** (10): The wondeful opener to Camila’s debut album, this song was another hit for Camila and strengthened her footing in the pop world. The song deals with themes of being swept off your feet, comparing the rush you get from that love to drugs. This song has some of the most interesting production in the pop mainstream, with there being so much variety in terms of sound youre hearing in the song that you never get bored while listening.

**letsallpoo** (9): A delicious slab of luxuriously crafted, straighforward pop music. I loved this song upon first listen, "heroWEEN" and all, and it seriously rasied my expectations for the album. I'm glad it eventually broke the top 10 on the Hot 100, even if she needed the help of Kane Brown.

---

**AnimationJava** (11): Camila's debut starts off with an electrifying sound, a vibe that still gives me chills when I hear it. The beginning of NBTS is incredible, her description of infatuation is what really draws me into this song. One of her overall strongest tracks off the album lyrically/sonically/atmospherically.

**rickikardashian** (11): I fell in love with this since the moment it came out. The production is godly and lyrically is pretty good. I was starting to warm up to her with Havana, but after this I had to stan. I'm glad this was given the approval of the GP because it's easily one of the best songs of this> year ^(~~that was released on 2017~~)

---


**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): Camilas best song and the best on this album. The first time I heard this I loved it, not the heroeen part at first. I used to listen to the radio edit that changed the lyrics but hearing it on the radio where it actually has heroeen on it, made me love it. This song is soooo good, it just makes you want to scream the lyrics and move along with the beat. Seeing Camila just made me appreciate this even more. A great single choice for an amazing song!!!

**SpanKKy1** (10): catch camila stealing morphine from the hospital then lighting a cigarette in the waiting room

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the ultimate love song. the song that made me stan Contra Ceptive.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): The most successful pure pop song of this year thus far, and, boy, does it deserve that title. Though Camila's voice doesn't exactly do the chorus, wonders, she's improved enough for her pitch to be bearable, and a Ariana-esque bop like this is just what we needed in this era of sad music. My only other nitpick with this is that the way she lists drugs is kind of lame, but, hey, who cares?

**lilacsweetener** (10): I should hate this song but I absolutely don't. I think her performance sells it, you don't forget how she sings it. She took a generic love song and made it sound weird as hell. Love it.

**MissyBee37** (10): This is a fabulous pop song. I love every eclectic element & the way they mesh together -- the deeper verses, the ethereal pre-chorus, the lovesick chorus. A beautiful, fresh take on a classic pop theme (addiction to a lover).

**wailordfan\_** (7): The issue I have with this song is that it almost hurts my throat listening to it when she is squeaking that high in the pre-chorus and post-chorus. The full sounding production and instrumental is super refreshing though, and the main hook in the chorus is super catchy.

---

**hikkaru** (8): HEROEEEEEEEEEEEN

**strawberryswing1** (9.5): the radio edit is a 10; the high notes she hits during the "heroine, morphine" line are kinda :sis:

**tapdancingpig** (9): I like this song, sue me. Camila gets some (deserved) shit for the nicotine heroween thing, but its really memorable and catchy.

**ItsJustSketchyy** (8.8): Yeah heroween is silly, but that's a dumb reason to not like this song.

**therandomsinger13** (8.5): Learn to pronounce your drug names, Ratmila Cabellno.

**MrSwearword** (3): the production surprisingly knocks but holy shit does Camila miss the notes on "Nicotine, hero-een, more-pheen" portion.

**1998tweety** (10): I love this song and I'm so glad it was a single. Her performances of it are so good and seeing it live was amazing.

**CarlieScion** (10): wig snatched

**chrisw99** (10): Wonderful

**cyborglilith** (10): title is me after hearing this song that is almost as good as all these years

**rotating3Dtext** (9.8): I ended up really liking this song...

**CanadianSkeleton** (9): The pre chorus is annoying but I still jam to it because nothing will make me not like this song

**misterralex** (9): Camila completely displays her range in this song with her heavenly head voice in the chorus

**PeachPlumParity** (9): I love this and I don't care she rhymes heroin and halloween.

**twat\_brained** (9): I love the intro, I love trying to mimic Camila's falsetto on the pre-chorus, and I love the way the song explodes on the chorus. Great song

**Banananaise** (8): gotdang i didn't really want to like this song but even after all this time it's still so catchy

**nahaalne** (8): The bridge brings the score down, wierd and feels low effort to me. Overall a great song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I didnt dig this at first, but the production is so dreamy and while some of her vocals are questionable, I love the vibes on this track.

**vayyiqra** (8): this gets off to a good start but then has yet more basic love=drug metaphors but it still goes off I guess

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): a nice, powerful bop. but god that falsetto

**eklxtreme** (7.5): the chorus 👌  the prechorus 👎

**Gatyto2002** (7): We all Change

**Me-Luigi** (7): its good? but not my thing? and idk why

**TheShineSoul** (7): It has definitely grown on me, but it still isn't great.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (5): I remember this being in a perfume commercial aNd thinking, this would be better if she wasn’t straining.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (4): The high-pitched prechorus is narmy and the forced rhyme with 'heroine' and 'morphine' makes me want to vomit

**luigi\_is\_better** (4): thanks for repping the smoker community camila but no thanks

**jjs33072** (2.1): I hate this song with a burning passion, why does it have to be on the album twice? Honestly just the choruses annoy me with her high screeching voice and boring repetitive lyrics.

**Shipsinker44** (8): Sis you can make me SIN, this dark pop song has some of the most interesting production in this whole rate and shows off a side to Dua that hopefully we see more of.

**letsallpoo** (0): I started following Dua a bit after "Be the One" dropped and I almost stopped following her after she released this. It sounds so awkwardly paced and her voice is annoyingly thin in the chorus.

---

**PuggleMaster** (10): a Classic i expect top 5 ladies!!!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): an 11

---

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): A bit of a short song, but Dua's quick switch from heavenly to hellish imagery here is amazing, and the song really does live up to its title. If there were any doubts about Dua's voice, this song proves that it can be great even when she's singing something that isn't a ballad.

**twat\_brained** (10): For the longest time (in other words before her album came out) this was my favorite Dua song. It's no longer my favorite but it is still absolute pop perfection in my eyes and my ears.

**vayyiqra** (10): more awesome production and I love that her voice cracks for no reason in the chorus? Sia found unconscious in a cellar? this bops hard wtf I love Dua Lipa now

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A solid track but it seems like its the epitome of what a Dua Lipa song entails

**PeachPlumParity** (5): It would probably be an ok song alone but after the first two songs? Doesn't hold a candle to 'em.

**hikkaru** (9): the steel drums <3

**MrSwearword** (9): something about the chorus and verse delivery not meshing well to me prevents this from full marks.

**therandomsinger13** (9): Solid head nod bop.

**wailordfan\_** (9): The only thing knocking this from a 10 is the 'oh yeahs' in the intro, but other than that, it is pretty fucking perfect.

**Me-Luigi** (8.2): a summer hit in my country in 2016! it's so catchy

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Very atomospheric and good vocals

**frogaranaman** (8): This is specifically about my boyfriend.

**AnimationJava** (6.5): A song about sex, nothing but.

**CanadianSkeleton** (6.5): Kinda boring to me

**ImADudeDuh** (6): idk why but I am not really a fan of this and is probably my least fave single

**tapdancingpig** (6): There's good stuff happening here, but it doesn't make a good overall track.

**Shipsinker44** (7): I know this is a fan favorite but i dont like how much the song relies on nostalgia with its sound, versus Dua’s other songs that dont sound like they were released 15 years ago. Still a bop, this song unfortunately couldnt Be The One, as it misses the number one spot, but it does become Dua’s third song in the top ten so far.

---
**agentofscranton** (11): the perfect summer bop as far as i'm concerned - can't believe they didn't opt to promote this as a single again after new rules smashed

**CarlieScion** (11): Imagine having this good of a song as ur debut. The other girlies can't relate

**dramiaa** (11): yes please

**eklxtreme** (11): it has some 2000s pop nostalgia which makes it really sweet and timeless. probably my favorite dua song.

**Leixander** (11): Her best song and I am sad that she won't be able to top this.

**mudkip1** (11): ugh what a SONG!!!

**OriginalKappa** (11): This is such an infectious bop this song is keeping me alive

**skargardin** (11): Imagine having a debut single this good?

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (11): The best song on the album and the best on this whole rate. This is Dua Lipa at her best. With an amazing upbeat production and melancholy lyrics with a hint of sadness, this song masters the duality, while showcasing her vocal range. The production of this song complements the vocals, especially as the song progresses, with it becoming grander and her vocals reaches higher. I remember when I first found this song on my the bus ride to work one day and I instantly loved, and when I got to work, it was stuck in my head. I literally got up and went to the bathroom to listen to it to the point where my boss noticed that I was in the bathroom for over 15 minutes

**ulikejazz** (11): This is the one

**wailordfan\_** (11): Everything about this song is perfect. The intro is minimal, but her vocals strike a bit hard when they are almost alone like this, and the melody is just so well structured for her voice, it sounds like silk. "Oh, baby come on, let me get to know you Just another chance so that I can show That I won't let you down, oh no" is quite possibly the best hook of 2017, and her growling coo at the end of the bridge is perfect too.

**SpanKKy1** (0): I didnt like this song the first time I heard it so when Aus radio played it for months straight I felt personally victimised

---

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): an 11

---

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Definitely one of the most unique songs on this album, Be The One is a synthpop song that sounds like it could have come out of a record that could be grouped into today's alternative pop scenes. It's not as vocally astounding as the previous two tracks at first listen, but the production more than makes up for it.

**AnimationJava** (7): Although the title might lead one to think it's about infatuation, Dua Lipa wants to admit she's wrong to a crush/lover so that he'll come back to her.

**twat\_brained** (10): [obligatory shitpost](https://twitter.com/charlie_crg/status/932848836057489408?s=19) listening to this never fails to paint a smile across my face, especially when I reminisce on how energetic the crowd was at the Montreal S/T Tour concert.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): wait no this is the ultimate megabop

**PeachPlumParity** (10): This song is flawless and I can't decide if this one should be my eleven or not it's too hard to choose.

**cyborglilith** (9.5): slightly sounds like TG4M

**1998tweety** (9): A good song that sounds different and stands out.

**Me-Luigi** (9): an excellent break out song! 1 point deducted because she didn't write it

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I really like this. The beat is nice and simple and the chorus is kinda catchy

**vayyiqra** (9): tbh let's not sleep on this jam, those synths are fire

**therandomsinger13** (8.8): I know this one. I feel like if I’d put this song behind the end of the Shake it Off video, the dancing would go great.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): It's the weakest single and it's still an 8 for me. That's saying something

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I like the "dreamy" instrumental but grew tired of the song overall

**tapdancingpig** (7.8): This one took a while to grow on me, but it's a very pleasant track. It's weird to me that this was her debut single.

**TheShineSoul** (7.5): I think this is kinda overrated but it's still nice and it kinda put her on the map.


**CanadianSkeleton** (7): Good but also boring

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This is a bit more airy than most Dua Lipa songs, another solid song.

**MrSwearword** (6): exuberance aside, this is kind of hollow

**jjs33072** (5.2): I don't like this song as much as i should, there's just nothing that sticks out for me.

**Shipsinker44** (10): A charming, heartwarming song, this is the result of a collaboration between Zara Larsson and hitmakers Clean Bandit. Zara shows off crystal clear VOCALS on this track, and Clean Bandit delivers that production that is both reminiscent of a better time in pop music and sounds fresh in the current climate like they have in their previous hits. It should be no surprise this song made it so far, as it is one of the Zara’s biggest hits, and doesn't suffer from what many of her other songs suffer from in the production department.

**letsallpoo** (11): Utterly gorgeous and powerful in every way possible. Clean Bandit definitely has a formula, but when it works, it really fucking works. I love how Zara sings the title in the final chorus, like she's pounding every syllable like they're piano keys.

---
**Raykel** (11): Of course her best song is by another artist

---

**frogaranaman** (10): Since I dont have many 10s in this rate at all, I will be using that comment space to highlight men that I think are 10s. In this edition... [Mikka Pedia!](https://www.instagram.com/p/s6Yj7DBApo/) Just look at him go off like that.

**luigi\_is\_better** (10): almost got my 11. yeah it's a clean bandit song but this should've been zara's major break into us but y'all suck so im not surprised. the music video is so beautiful i can't wait to watch it in day 3

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): This song may have never made the Hot 100 in the States, but it was played endlessly here, which kind of turns me off it. I still understand why it drew a lot of attention to Zara, though. I enjoy the instrumentals, and I really appreciate the fact that she included a gay couple in the music video. Maybe her voice here is just too high for me to like it.

**OriginalKappa** (10): I would give this an 11 if this was the Clean Bandit rate - but this is their song and I'm not giving an 11 in a pop girl prophecy rate to a non-pop girl. What a bop - Clean Bandit are one of the most consistent pop producers and this is a really sweet and danceable hit from them.

**twat\_brained** (10): The sad thing is this is my favorite Zara song and she's merely a feature. On the plus side it makes me realize how good a lot of Clean Bandit's singles are which means I should really give their discography a listen.

**eklxtreme** (10): one of the best songs that either artist has ever done. clean bandit always comes in with the great string accompaniment and Zara rly snapped and added the beautiful emotion to it.

**Shipsinker44** (7.5): A song so good it single handedly saved Camila Cabello’s career, Havana was a massive achievement for the up and comer. The GP loved this song, keeping its longevity alive for months and eventually bringing it to the top of the charts, and put her name into the mouths of millions. Camila worked with Pharrell on this track to delve back into her roots and bring back music she felt proud of, and it definitely shows in the final product how much work went into her new direction. Unfortunately, this is Camila’s departure from the rate, but she had a great run and ended on a strong note!

**letsallpoo** (10): After CITC bombed, I think most people had written off Camila - even I had to stop pretending to stan her after that disaster. Think about it: She had teased that she was finally ready to show us her own unique artistry as a soloist, and she comes out with this "Cheap Thrills" clone that peaks lower than "Down". I think that failure inspired her to work even harder, though, and with the help of Pharrell, she released "Havana" (and "OMG" which we'll overlook). It sounded distinct from anything on the radio, despite still riding on the Latin trend, and even though it carried a feature, she was undeniably the centerpiece of the song. It was hardly groundbreaking, but it was and still is a unique earworm that forced us to pay attention to her. Watching it climb up the charts, then eventually push its way to the top on the week of her album release, was glorious to witness. I still adore this song, and I hope that Camila can manage to match its quality sometime soon.

---
**ItsJustSketchyy** (11): Anybody who rates this a 0 is getting blocked and reported thanks.

**MrSwearword** (0): hated it then, hate it now. iCannot, iWillnot, iRefuse, iShant

---

**JanuraryFourteenth** (11): JEFFERY

**MissyBee37** (11): Masterpiece. Absolutely one of my favorite songs to be released in a long time. A modern, instant iconic hit. I love every (Camila) moment, from the opening notes through the "oo-ooh"s, every "na-na," that sultry chorus, every ad-lib. Such a catchy hook! I love the lyrics & the story they tell. Her vocal is excellent, her delivery & expression are excellent. The piano, percussion & that horn are all gorgeous. Young Thug is the weakest part but not bad enough to rob her of the 11. I think his verse is half-baked (like, lazy/sleepy-sounding) and his lyrics are plain compared to the fire & passion of her parts. But he's fine. She, however, is amazing and this song cements her status as a solo star.

---

**strawberryswing1** (10): Okay everyone else will do a great job highlighting the good parts of this song so I will say this: Young Thug absolutely makes this song better. This song would not be a 10 without him. He gives this song swagger and personality, which is something you need in a dance track like this. The way he sings "Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn" is just so effortless and cool. *Jefferyyyyyyyyyy.*

**1998tweety** (10): This first time I heard this song was at work, I listened to it once followed by OMG and then went back to Havana for like 20 listens. I'm so glad this blew up.

**AnimationJava** (10): This is Camila's zenith so far, it might not bang the hardest off the album but Havana was the skyrocket that she rode to stardom. The song's cultural impact as well as importance in opening doors for her future cannot be ignored. It's catchy, a homage to her Cuban roots, and still a spicy bop.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.5): Maybe overplayed all throughout of summer 2017 on the radio and still well into this summer, but for good reason because this a great. With piano beats and trombones in the background transporting you to Havana, Camila serves an infectious chorus honoring her birthplace that will get stuck in you head in a good way (spawning great memes like https://youtu.be/PjBS454UAic). Young Thug provides a few decent verses.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Even after the massive overplay, exposure, and times Ive heard this track, it never fails to disappoint. Young Thug gives one of the most fitting rap features on a pop song Ive heard in ages, and the chorus is just, well, you know. The music video is fun too, and Im unsurprised that this was the one to make Camila a star, its a truly fun and unique track.

**twat\_brained** (10): Allow me to copy and paste what I wrote for Havana on the X Factor Excellence Rate: Pharrell's production here is flawless and while I wasn't big on Thugger's verse, it's grown on me with every repeated listen of this song. And I get a LOT of repeated listens whenever I turn on the radio. Not that I'm complaining; Havana is the defining song of Camila's debut solo era but hopefully not her career, there's far more potential to be tapped into. Also the last truly great Hot 100 #1 of our time.

**luigi\_is\_better** (8): the biggest song from this rate. i have to say that when it was first released i was not impressed at all, but after a few weeks it really made a impression. still very repetitive and not the best song from the album by far though. also i love you jeffery

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): After being included in a bonus rate last month, Havana finally makes it to a main one, and it'll definitely be a huge upset if it doesn't take the podium. I know this sub has followed this song's journey, down from its release with OMG to its gradual ascent until it took the crown down to it getting ready to lead the charts. It was a hit that I never get annoyed by, and, musically, I love the saxophone towards the end; songs with saxophones are always great.

**OriginalKappa** (10): Young Thug is a weird addition but this is such a bop that he actually works pretty well. I loved hearing this Cuban sound do so well on the charts, it's a shame most of the songs on the record took an annoyingly lazy different direction.

---

**therandomsinger13** (7): Banana ooh na na!

**lady\_sable** (10): lowkey saved pop music ngl

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): cant wait to see the controversy score on this one

**MashLuke** (10): we love a top 5 song in this rate

**Needlesslyrics** (10): make this the Cuban national anthem right now

**rickikardashian** (9.5): We love a #1 song. Since the moment I heard that I knew this would be a huge hit. Thanks to this I decided to stan. The power of Cuba.

**SpanKKy1** (10): a banging bopping and slapping smash hit, invented charting

**tapdancingpig** (10): Do I have to comment? We all know this is the perfect crossover bop.

**Me-Luigi** (9.5): sis snapped, hated it the first listen but yeah she did snap

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): Very good, very catchy. I feel like Thugger's verse might be a tiny bit out of place.

**cyborglilith** (9): < all these years

**ImADudeDuh** (9): bop

**eklxtreme** (8.5): the chorus mixed with that insane production never gets old. Camila's vocals are rly catchy and the frank dukes piano is classic.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Would be a 10 but young thug kills the momentum :/

**vayyiqra** (8): okay this is undeniably catchy but so repetitive it needs that dumb rap to break the monotony, that said ooh na na

**jjs33072** (7.9): Would be higher if the radio didn't ruin it for me, as well as my brother playing it 24/7.

**TheShineSoul** (7.5): Banger but I've listened to it too much.

**PuggleMaster** (7): this didn't age as well as it should've

**wailordfan\_** (7): Sorry. Thug's part is super annoying to me, and I never really **loved** this song to begin with, I still think Crying in the Club is better.

**frogaranaman** (6): I love this Young Thug song!

**gannade** (6): young thug kinda ruins it tbh

**lilacsweetener** (6): Didn't think it'd be the breakout hit but the catchiness is undeniable. It sounds amazing in clubs and bars. A mood.

**nahaalne** (6): My dad said this song was interesting

**PeachPlumParity** (6): JEFFFFFREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE just graduated from a 5 to a 6.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): idk why people desperately want a solo version b/c without Young Thug this would drag even more

**agentofscranton** (4.5): ask me how i would rate this on first listen and i would probably give it a 8.5 / 9, but i think maybe i just overplayed it to death or something cause now i'm finding this song so boring sorry

**Overall average**: 7.330

**MissyBee37** (8.800): Oh, Camila, na-na-na. She's my favorite new pop artist and I am so thrilled that she's gone solo. She was always my favorite part of 5H anyway, so seeing her shine on her own is just a delight. I admire her as an artist and I am so here for anything she wants to do with her music. My only complaint with this album is that it's still so sad. I'm glad it's not as dark as it sounds like the original version would've been, but I still feel like this album is stuck somewhere between the hurting & the healing. I've been struggling to articulate to myself why I don't listen to it as much as I thought I would, but it's just a bit of a downer. All of the sad songs are good! There's not a single song on here that I don't like! But I want more variety of energy and emotion. I want more upbeat energy on the next record. I would say about 6/10 songs are some type of sad (even "In the Dark," which I love, is still chill, a bit moody and a bit down as she laments how this person won't open up to her). I love a good ballad, but this album needed something like "OMG" or "Sangria Wine" to balance it out. Overall, though, I have to remind myself that it's her debut because her writing is mature and she's so talented; it's strong for a debut and makes me so excited to see what she does next! 

**misterralex** (8.700): 10 Easily the best debut album out of the 4 girls in this rate. Even though it lacks in quantity, Camila makes up for it by adding quality and variety to her album. 

**ItsJustSketchyy** (8.530): Look, i'll try not to be biased here, but I'm not making any promises. I've been basically listening to this album on repeat for the past 2 weeks, and I don't see myself stopping any time soon. I honestly love the whole vibe of this album, which is crazy for me because I'm usually super fussy with the songs that I throw into my library. 

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8.500): 8.5 After a rocky start, Camila hits her stride and makes a really great album 

**cyborglilith** (8.300): I LOVE KARLA CAMILA CABELLO 

**tapdancingpig** (8.100): I wish this album got a little more work before it was released. Its clear that Camila is a great writer with a strong lyrical identity, but too often in the album, the production and melodies are less than stellar. Also, there are a LOT of guitar or piano only songs, which I dont mind, but it makes me wonder if she went over her labels budget and had to cut costs. 

**AnimationJava** (8.100): Although many people would expect Camila to be a bopping album full of bangers, given her famous hits (Bad Things, IKWYDLS, Havana, NBTS). She actually opts for an album of ballads, raw emotion and vulnerabilityó something more along the line of Shawn Mendesís/Ed Sheeranís brand than Taylor Swift/Katy Perry. Surprisingly real and raw, Camila was given a golden opportunity from her smash hit Havana to show the world who she is, and hopefully it succeeds. 

**PeachPlumParity** (8.070): It's an album alright. 

**TheShineSoul** (7.550): Disappointing but still nice? 

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7.500): Can't wait for her sophomore album CABELLO 

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.400): One of the first big pop releases of 2018. Did this convince me that Camila is the next pop legend? No, it didn't, but I did convince me that she has potential past Havana. Even if it's not an especially original album, it still proves that she can make bops when she wants to. Her voice has improved, even if it's still not the best out there, and the album is especially good when she channels her Hispanic roots on the first half. 

**selegend** (7.400): Half amazing, half snooze 

**CanadianSkeleton** (7.250): I saw her at a festival just a month ago and she was even better than expected 

**jjs33072** (7.240): Strongest album on here IMO. 

**vayyiqra** (7.100): better known as Camino "Rat" Comunismo and the Yoko Ono of 5H, she was born in the seaside capital of Cojmar, Cuba 

**Banananaise** (7.000): half good half bad which isn't great for such a short album 

**lilacsweetener** (7.000): I give her props for serving more than generic nothing bops about sex in the club, and actually offering deeper introspection. Her songwriting is promising too, I think her next album will be even bigger. 

**Leixander** (6.950): a disappointment but still not really bad 

**Me-Luigi** (6.730): this album just has a few standout songs and half of it is filler 

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD** (6.700): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0FhjHf63yA 

**Discord_and_Dine** (6.500): I was surprised and let down in equal measure 

**MashLuke** (6.400): about fine 

**luigi_is_better** (6.350): honestly, it's just very difficult to judge this album. i have a lot of scrobbles on it but most songs just got a 6 because the way i see it they're good songs for background noise when you're doing something else, but when you actually want to listen to some music they're not it. also it's all over the place, the starter and the closer don't sound like a starter and a closer and it's basically a playlist (drake did it first, i guess). i hope that camila has a more cohesive second album in mind. 

**OriginalKappa** (5.500): I wish I liked this more because the singles are super fun but the album tracks are so uninspired and mean I can never revisit this album despite the fact that it contains some real bops. 

**animefangrant62** (5.350): In defence of Cameltoe Cabbagepatch, I saw her perform a lot of this album live and it's way better in a live environment. The album itself is just whatever. 


**TragicKingdom1** (5.150): I really do not see the appeal in this album that the rest of the sub seems to. Camila is a fine performer, she doesn't ruin any songs singlehandedly, but she doesn't fit the sparse guitar style that is vastly overrepresented on this project. There's also a lot of trop pop that could use an energy boost or just anything that makes it stand out, and yes this category includes "Havana." The best songs on the album are "Never Be The Same" and "In The Dark" simply because they have these vast, powerful choruses that highlight Camila's voice. I really hope those two songs are the direction Camila moves towards in the future; just because "Havana" was your breakthrough hit doesn't mean you need to neuter the rest of your material. [Grade: C-] 

**MrSwearword** (4.500): she keeps things mercifully short even if she could stand to keep it shorter and NOT RELEASE MUSIC ANYMORE. NO MORE. 

**frogaranaman** (3.600): This album would be better if it didnt exist.

**Shipsinker44** (10): The song of the summer for many popheads user in the year it released, New Rules was Dua’s spotlight moment, where she finally broke into the US mainstream and showed people she could become a force to be reckoned with. With throwback production, deep vocals, and meme-worthy lyrics, this was a rare moment in time where public opinion and popheads opinion came together, to birth a new age pop superstar.

**letsallpoo** (10): This was never in contention as the #1 here, even though I think it's deserved. Even when I disregard how much I like the song (and video of course), I appreciate "New Rules" because it was nice of us as a community to have a little pop song to root for on the charts for once. It was fun to watch it climb every week up the Hot 100, and was easily one of the bright spots of the 2017 pop zeitgeist. 

---

**lady\_sable** (11): so uh i think we have the rate winner here

**Needlesslyrics** (11): just imagine how good this will sound when Dua performs it in the 2021 superbowl halftime

---

**MissyBee37** (10): This song is so good it's easy to overlook how good it is, if that makes any sense. Like, it sounds like it's always been a pop classic and it's only a year old. It's just such a strong concept for a pop song because it's so current yet timeless; it's universal & relatable. This is a message pop music needed. "If you're under him, you ain't getting over him" is a *brilliant* lyric. It's fresh & fun and every part is strong -- the pre-chorus is gold, the verses (especially the, like, background responses) are strong, catchy chorus. This song is the whole package.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): 1) Dont pick up the cig, you know its only there cause its hard to kick 2) Dont breathe it in, youll have to throw it out again 3) Dont be its friend, you know youre gonna have bad breath in the morning, and if youre addicted, youre not getting over them. I GOT NEW JUULS I COUNT EM

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): I know beforehand that this song will be dragged in this rate by how overplayed it is, and I understand that, although there are better songs :kim: this was the one that broke through America. The prechorus and chorus is :fallingdespair:. Dua counting her new rules is so iconic, The Count wishes he could be like her.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Seeing New Rules go from an ignored pop song abroad to a Top 10 hit in America was one of the wildest moments of 2017. I remember hearing the song in the plug.dj half an hour after it crashed and we had to contact an admin, and the song grew on me along with its success. For a long time, whenever a chart was released, people would always asks 'where's New Rules?'. Despite this song being the only one Dua didn't write, it deserves all the praise, and I hope it doesn't act as a kind of one-hit wonder.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I think this song is really objectively good (the lyrics are great, it uses some fun text painting, the structure is interesting), but it's not really my kind of song. The video is an 11 and adds a LOT to the song.

**wailordfan\_** (8.5): I kinda feel bad for Dua that this is the song that blew up, as it is the only on the album she didn't have her hand in during the writing process, and she had to sing her arguably least inspired song constantly. Compared to the rest of the album, the verses are the least interesting, but has one of the most fun choruses of 2017.

**twat\_brained** (10): I love this song, I love the video, I loved hearing Dua close her concert with this, I loved the BRITs performance, I just love everything about this song. It truly deserves top popheads song of 2017 and I totally get why it would win the rate but I know popheads so that won’t happen. This isn't my 11 either so I also hope it doesn’t happen

**vayyiqra** (10): undeniable bop and queen of numeracy, this song invented breakups, counting, telephony, female bonding, the yellow sunglasses trend, and pastel colours. ALSO she literally walks on water = Dua is Albanian Jesus, confirmed canon

**MrSwearword** (10): normally, pop songs famous for being viral sensations before being pop songs earn my ire. In this case, despite the horrendous delivery of the chorus, everything adds up to a really well done song.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): an 11

**Joebiekong** (6): Rule number 4, gotta be lookin pure.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Is any explanation really necessary?

**dropthehammer11** (10): conceptually its one of the most clever, infectious pop songs of the last few years. and it BOPS

**eklxtreme** (10): it's a great song but it's even better because of how iconic the lyrics have become and I could also listen to this everyday and not get tired of it, so this gets a 10

**static\_int\_husp** (10): iconic

**therandomsinger13** (9.5): Whenever I hear this anywhere I still have to sing along to it. One of the best songs on the radio. Don’t mind my aggressive dancing and counting.

**TheShineSoul** (9.5): I knew this was a hit as soon as I heard it when she released the album. Great song.

**hikkaru** (9): The drop/chorus is meh in my opinion, but the ICONIC pre-chorus more than makes up for it, and boosts it up to a respectable 9. Very glad this one crossed over to North America.

**jjs33072** (8.9): The best song on the album and the holy spirit of the holy trinity of pop bangers.

**AnimationJava** (8.5): Dua Lipaís U.S. peak so far, reaching #6 on the billboard hot 100. This is an empowerment anthem that is insanely catchy, and impossible not to bop along to.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): My female friends needed this song.

**Me-Luigi** (8): So tired of this but it bops, 1 point deducted because she didn't write it

**CanadianSkeleton** (7): Still a decent single for mainstream radio

**frogaranaman** (7): The little known fourth rule in this song is You have to eat ass to advertise yourself as vers on Grindr.

**luigi\_is\_better** (6.5): even after all this time the drop still is horrible

**nahaalne** (5.5): I've grown to dislike this song due to it being overplayed to death

**selegend** (3): I remember when Selena got back with Justin and the twitter locals memed this song to death. I trust the gays to not overrate this this time.

**ItsJustSketchyy** (2.5): I really, really don't like this song. Don't ask me to explain.

**ulikejazz** (2): I had this on repeat for two weeks straight trying to win a meet and greet with Dua so now I hate it thanks

**Shipsinker44** (9): I bet yall were scared shitless that this had a chance of winning. Well guess what, it almost DID. of course i cant read your guys minds, but im ASSUMING that when you guys were voting and absent mindedly giving this a ten, you had no idea that thats what everyone else was doing too, and it almost made it win the freaking rate. I was in SHOCK when i was told that this song was in first place. Dont get me wrong, the song got a lot of 11s too, and its definitely the most deserving of Zara songs to be up here, but it got more 10’s and more 11’s than the actual WINNER OF THE RATE. WHAT THE F U C K POPHEADS. I like the song and all but oml, THIS is your 11??? 

 A cool summer song, Zara proved here that you can make a song with the great chorus and horrible everything else and almost win a major rate. I dont think most people really expected Zara to survive this far into the rate, even those who gave it a high score, and some fans are definitely going to be mad that she made it so far over their own favs, but this song’s tropical production and upbeat vibe obviously meshed well with our users, and got it the second place ribbon for this rate!

---
**chrisw99** (11): Phenomenal track

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (11): The summer bop that was never the hit it should have been in America. We need to wake the hell up and embrace Zara

**gannade** (11): men LOST

**MashLuke** (11): I have loved this song since the first listen, what a catchy track. It's my go-to happy song, so fun.

**tapdancingpig** (11): Wow. I had never heard this song before, and holy shit! How did my country sleep on this?

**TheShineSoul** (11): The best pop song of the last 10 years fight me.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): the fact that this incredible song was wasted on Zara is depressing...it deserved to smash (throwback to 2016 when popheads was rooting for it so hard lol)

---

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Oh, wow, I had never actually consciously heard this prior to this rate and I'm surprised at how good it is, even compared to Zara's already pretty decent singles. The disco-inspired composition ends up creating a perfect bop for a summer night, and I love how playful she sounds throughout the entire track.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Fun fact, when this song came out, I was fully convinced it was a megahit because I only listened to Spotify playlists and didnt pay attention to charts, you shouldve seen how confused I was when I saw in the early days of popheads people were watching intently the day it would crack the Hot 100.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): throwback to "Best of r/popheads" posts and that one picture of that one post saying Lush Life finally enters the hot 100 and someone just commented r/UpliftingNews. what an iconic moment

**luigi\_is\_better** (9.5): i wasn't a big fan of this song when i first listened but after going through this album again two or three months ago i became totally addicted to it

**RandomDKguy** (9.367): SO **FUCKING** GOOD 

**MashLuke** (8.633): it's the second most streamed album by a female artist for a reason! 

**Discord_and_Dine** (8.333): Lush Life deserves all the elevens. The rest of the singles pop but the album tracks are kind of a letdown 

**cyborglilith** (8.107): honestly the best pop album of 2017 

**vayyiqra** (8.000): alright let's go Nigerian princess 

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7.847): I want to love this album but unfortunately, it was dated by the time it dropped 

**agentofscranton** (7.733): of the four, So Good was probably the most forgettable of them - it didn't have as low lows as AYF or as high highs as Dua Lipa, it has some decent to great songs, but it's just like, aggressively average 

**TheShineSoul** (7.667): Disappointing but the singles make it great. 

**tapdancingpig** (7.507): I generally like all of the girls in the rate (hell, I even stan one of them), but Zara is easily the best singer. She has a bright clear sound and the ability to belt, riff, and use her head voice at a whim. Shes really good at delivering hooks, but some of these hooks are lacking. Producers and labels: give this bitch all your tome, money, and promotion. 

**luigi_is_better** (7.467): I didn't knew zara before listening to this album for the first time and i got really surprised. it has some problems yes but I always come back to it. get that high numbers, girl 

**twat_brained** (7.433): I lost my scores for this the first time round so let’s see if it's any better on second listen. 

**dropthehammer11** (7.380): this is the best album of the shit we're rating 

**rickikardashian** (7.340): The title isn't about the album, because if not It would be just like So aight 

**Leixander** (7.167): went in with low expectations and pleasantly surprised 

**animefangrant62** (7.000): Zara has the best singles of all the girls but man her album has some stinkers on it. A Rihanna tea. 

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.967): I'd consider this the second best album in the rate after Dua's. Does it live up to the title? Not quite, but it still manages to get you genuinely excited for what Zara has to offer; songs like Lush Life and I Would Like are catchy pop songs from a unique music scene that offer a sort of atmosphere uncommon in today's pop landscape, and Zara's vocals ultimately deliver despite not being strictly showstopping. It has a filler problem, but it's a worthy experience overall. 

**mudkip1** (6.933): she tried her best and that's what matters 

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6.800): So Good, more like So Bad (at times) 

**selegend** (6.533): This is a decent pop album I will die on this hill 

**OriginalKappa** (6.267): There's a good album in here but it's buried by filler and weak tracks, unfortunately 

**TragicKingdom1** (6.033): This album showed a lot more promise before it was released. It's pretty clear that the budget and good ideas were all expended in the singles beforehand and most of those songs are admittedly very good; Lush Life is one of the few songs that this sub viciously rooted for that actually deserved that level of attention. But the rest is just generally below average. Both Zara and the production are limp, lifeless and unmemorable. Listen to the singles, don't listen to the album. [Grade: C] 

**AnimationJava** (5.933): Idk if the album title is accurate to the quality of the album! Haha Jk 

**Me-Luigi** (5.553): that title is a LIAR, I understand all the achievements but of course your album's gonna get a lot of streams if you include 1.5 year old hits and a song you're featured on. A lot of the songs don't really stand out and 15 tracks was just too long and painful except for the few good bops 

**jjs33072** (4.947): So many great songs mixed with terrible songs. 

**PeachPlumParity** (4.933): I swear I've listened to this album before but I only remember three of the songs. 

**MrSwearword** (4.667): And here I thought Swedes made good pop music. Well, I guess national talent skips a generation [or leaves them with a lot working against them] 

**ItsJustSketchyy** (4.600): I'm so 50/50 with Zara's music. I'll either love her, or i'll hate her. Overall I was pleasantly surprised with this album, and I listened to Symphony way more than I probably should have. 

**MissyBee37** (4.567): Wow, this is so not my cup of tea. She has a pretty voice but these songs each feel repetitive to me and I don't like the style at all. I did this rate for the other three artists and was hoping to discover a fourth new pop girl I'd like, but I wouldn't listen to this album again. I didn't know who Zara was before this album but I don't feel like I know her any better after this. 

**frogaranaman** (4.467): Very excited to listen to generic white female vocalist #4 of this rate, enthralled as to what this album will entail.

**Shipsinker44** (11): My GOD. First off, let me just say, it was nerve wracking the first time i saw the results of this rate about a week before they were finalized and saw that LUSH LIFE WAS IN FIRST PLACE. Left and right, users were promoting giving your 11 to Blow Your Mind, and yet somehow, there was legitimately a point in time where it was losing to Zara Larsson. Luckily, with some last few submissions, it just BARELY beat it out. But god, i was actually getting excited at the thought of zara winning the rate and beating dua and seeing how yall would react, but i am very happy with the outcome we actually got, because thank GOD.

Also before i get to the last part, let me tell you, this bangs in a club. I cannot tell you how scary it was to be in the gay club when this song came on. I saw gays screaming, stampeding to the dance floor, some of them were crying. It was a lot to take in while drunk.

This in-your-face seductive anthem, Dua exudes pure confidence on this track, telling someone in her life what she’s capable of and if they dont want it, its their loss, not hers. That confidence is what gave us her amazing self titled album, and brought her right to the top of this rate. Her debut’s 4th single, it didn’t achieve massive success in the US, but its a fan favorite in her discography, as obviously shown here. Joining a long list alongside other amazing winners, Dua is officially crowned the queen of this rate, and she fulfills the Pop Prophecy.

**letsallpoo** (9): this song is pretty good

---
**hikkaru** (11): This is one of the best bops I've ever heard. I absolutely adore the sass of the song, and Dua sells it extremely well, with the "mwah" kisses hammering that in even more. The chorus goes HARD, and has infectious energy. Songs like this are precisely why I listen to and love pop music.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): the first Dua song I heard and DAMN does she fucking ooze charisma and sass on this song, it's prefect.

**MrSwearword** (11): DUA'S BEST SONG. High energy production, vocal delivery that fits said production and even with the stupid wine lyric, I always get my life to this song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): This is really a song that's just made for the runway. From us being blessed with some of Dua's deepest and stormiest vocals from the beginning verse, to the delightful way she shows off her accent during the second half of the chorus, it really does feel like Dua is kissing us by giving us this absolutely fantastic song.

**PuggleMaster** (11): What a fucking song! I love how different this song is. The way the chorus changes from the pre chorus ugh her mind.

**twat\_brained** (11): I love how punchy and in-your-face this is, very reminiscent of the Spice Girls in a lot of ways.

**vayyiqra** (11): GUARANTEED THIS CAN BLOW YOUR MIND also I've been trying to make [statement followed by "m'wah"] into an r/popheads meme for a while but it isn't getting any traction anyway this song goes hard

---

**MissyBee37** (10): This is my favorite Dua song; it's just so great. I love every piece and how it builds from verses that are fairly plain to a strong pre-chorus to that fabulous chorus with that extra something special in the post-chorus. That chorus, though... Mwuah, indeed! It's so, so catchy and I love the sassy lyrics. "If you don't like the way I talk then why am I on your mind?" is just brilliant. Such a fun song. Mwuah!

**frogaranaman** (10): Since I dont have many 10s in this rate at all, I will be using that comment space to highlight men that I think are 10s. In this edition... [Nick!](https://twitter.com/duckumu/status/1015684764714655744) He is for sure my body, aesthetic, humor, and basically everything goals.

**Me-Luigi** (9): A BIG BOP! the sis Lauren Christy (co-wrote 5 songs on All Your Fault: Pt. 1) crosses over to another Albanian and snaps again, mess this wasn't sent to radio in my country

**rickikardashian** (9): This was the first song I heard a Dua song, and BITCH, I WAS GAGGEDT FROM THE START. That *mwah* made my asshole quiver.

**luigi\_is\_better** (7): it's mindblowing (get it? its funny ok) that this song wasn't the one that made dua a worldwide popstar. as a person who got to know her 3 months after this song was released, it really looked like to be her big break but that didn't happened until new rules. still a good song

**letsallpoo** (6.714): fun fact: this debuted with lower sales than Zara

---
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9.443): i am so proud to say that im losing my concert virginity to this woman 

**agentofscranton** (9.214): easily my favourite of these four girls and these four albums 

**therandomsinger13** (9.114): First time I listened to this album I dismissed it bc of her deep voice. No idea why I did that because this thang is full of bops! 

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD** (9.000): is this album a WOC? 

**vayyiqra** (8.786): Albanian Charli XCX - activate! 

**mudkip1** (8.714): sensational 

**Discord_and_Dine** (8.286): I can see this being a classic in ten years or so 

**PeachPlumParity** (8.186): This album is so fucking good I can't wait for the sophomore album. 

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.143): We've been looking for perfect albums full of pure pop recently, like Emotion, but this is the closest thing to an album full of full pure mainstream pop that's as good as such projects can get, and, yes, I am including Teenage Dream in that equation. Dua's debut is exactly what a first album should be-really catchy and hype-worthy, but leaving enough room to improve on. 

**Me-Luigi** (7.964): An excellent debut album from another Albanian sister! 

**TheShineSoul** (7.964): The best album of the 4, full of pop perfection songs. 

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7.857): Im typing this as I lay in bed because I was supposed to see Dua Lipa perform today and instead it thunderstormed and they cancelled the festival when I was FRONT ROW!!! And I bought a record for a signing that was gonna happen afterwards I decided to take the train home and give Dua Lipa the justice she deserves in this rate, smh. Thank you all for listening. 

**MrSwearword** (7.857): a solid debut that shows what Dua has and what she needs to tweak in order to really have her shit together. 

**cyborglilith** (7.821): full of filler and non-unique, but there are some bops 

**TragicKingdom1** (7.714): This is the best album in the rate by far in my opinion. Dua's sultry voice really complements the strong pop songwriting, creating a package that gets along pretty well on sheer competency. The weak point of the album is the production imo, it kind of blends together and can't decide whether it wants to be Selena Gomez/Julia Michaels-esque minimalist or a lusher trop pop. It's not bad but could be improved. A hidden strength is in the ballads; they're much better than the typical soulless, manufactured ballads that tend to end up on pop girl debuts. This ultimately isn't the best pop album ever but it doesn't fall into the typical shortcomings that the other albums in this rate succumbed to, and thus ends up being stronger than it has any right to be. [Grade: B+] 

**MissyBee37** (7.671): This is a solid album. It made me a fan of Dua and it makes me excited to see what she does in the future. Overall, though, I think it's biggest flaw is feeling repetitive. A lot of the songs feel repetitive within themselves and the album as a whole feels repetitive. On the plus side, it's cohesive! But on the down side, a lot of songs run together for me. The standout tracks are so worth it, though, and there's nothing on here that I just flatout don't like; it's all fun to listen to. I absolutely love and still listen to "IDGAF," "New Rules" and "Blow Your Mind." 

**OriginalKappa** (7.643): Originally I hated this album but I have since completely changed my mind, this is a legendary collection of bops and it deserves to win this rate no question 


**tapdancingpig** (7.021): This one is really, really inconsistent. Some of the best songs in the rate come from this album, but a lot of my least favorite tracks are in here. She probably has the weakest artistic identity of all the girls in the rate. Shes got a really cool, instantly identifiable voice which sets her apart from the rest of the girls (I think shes the only one in the rate who isnt a natural soprano). 


**selegend** (6.714): The album tracks really lost their magic on me, still a solid debut album though 

**lilacsweetener** (6.643): Can I thank whoever signed her for bringing a deeper female voice into pop? Sick of these baby voices! 

**AnimationJava** (6.593): Dua Lipaís debut self-titled album offers very vanilla and bland pop, thereís not a whole lot to write about it. Itís catchy enough to be popular with the mainstream, and I wish her the best of luck going forward. 

**luigi_is_better** (5.857): so i was really into dua before her album was released and throughout the release but idk what happened that i grew tired of her and this is where i am currently so it was difficult to rate her album. just like camila though, it's all over the place and not really cohesive (but camila has less tracks which def helps). it's a nice album but not really a pop masterpiece by any means. 

**jjs33072** (5.793): Album has strong moments but is just weak to me overall. 

**frogaranaman** (5.357): [REDACTED] 

**ItsJustSketchyy** (4.150): Idk, I just kind of find Dua's vocals really boring for the most part. Nothing against her as a person, just not my kind of artist.
