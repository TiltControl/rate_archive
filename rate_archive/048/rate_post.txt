#Welcome to the Pop Girls Prophecy rate!

Join your hosts (me, myself, u/jamesfog and I) as we rate 4 potential female pop icons. All of these ladies are distinct enough to separate themselves from their predecessors (such as Lady Gaga and Katy Perry) and have also shown both the commercial and critical success to carry them into the next decade as leaders in the pop industry. All these girls are also exhibiting that they are able to not only survive but thrive in the streaming era, a new challenge many of the older pop girls are still struggling to overcome.

Your competitors are:

# Rules and shit

In what has become a great /r/popheads tradition, the majority of these rules have been copied and pasted from a previous rate.

* Listen to each song and **assign each a score between 1 and 10**. Decimals are fine, but **please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two decimal spots.** 

6.7: OK

6.75: Absolutely unacceptable
 
* **Yes, you have to listen to and rank every song**. The program will not work unless each song has a score!

* Your scores should not be considered confidential!
 
* You may give **ONE** song a **0** and **ONE** song an **11**. By one, we mean that this is **one song total**, not one song per album. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; excessive sabotage ruins rate results and is very annoying!
 
* You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM either me at any time.
 
* The program makes things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on our part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to **use the pre-prepared link, found [right here](https://tinyurl.com/yc2pulaf). PLEASE USE THAT**. You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores.

* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!

Acceptable:

>New Rules: 0 What is this garbage!

Unacceptable:

>New Rules: What is this garbage! 0
>
>New Rules: 0 - What is this garbage!
> 
>New Rules: 0 (What is this garbage!)
>
>New Rules: This is garbage, so I will give it a 0!

* If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there.

Acceptable:

>Album: So Good: I love this album and, as a result, I have cut all men out of my life

# EDIT:
So a lot of you guys have been asking why All Your Fault is in this instead of Expectations and I completely understand why. I responded to this in the comments below but for visibility I will copy my response here

>When this was created we weren’t even sure if Expectations was going to actually be released or if it would go the way of Joyride, so we decided to use AYF. When the album and its release date was officially announced, the other people in charge of this rate and myself got together and discussed this. While dropping AYF for Expectations was something we seriously considered we felt that Expectations was released too close to the rating period and it being so new could skew the rate and make it less fair (cause recency bias and stuff).

Sorry to disappoint but thank you for understanding!

#EDIT 2: PLEASE STOP GIVING 0/11's TO BONUS TRACKS!
