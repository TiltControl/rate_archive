https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/9bwwkh/the_pop_prophecy_rate_reveal_day_1_it_wasnt_meant/

Hello yall, I'm Shippy, one of the hosts that took over for jamesfog and theedgiestmirror! After weeks and weeks of yall sending in ballots, we have finally come up with an answer, as to what new pop girl will fulfill the prophecy and become the next big thing.

Now, have some facts about this rate:

* Number of participants: 99 (damn almost broke 100)

* Average average: 7.0301

* Controversy average: 2.0369 (If you see a controversy score above this, it means yall REALLY didnt like it!)

pretty interesting. today i am revealing the first four songs of the Bonus Rate (right at the beginning!) and then #51-#31 of the main rate.

1. For reasons that are fairly complicated, some of my blurbs may not match my scores, or I may just flat out regret a few scores. I‚Äôm sorry. 

2. This rate was so uneven, no disrespect meant for any of the hosts or creators of it. All of these girls are so talented, but their efforts here are mixed at best. Ugh. Oh well, I did find a few new good songs, which is what expect from these rates. 

Edit: actually, this was an awesome rate to have, because the way that these girls are misusing their talents are really interesting.

**Shipsinker44** (6): Ah, the once infamous discarded collaboration of Pharrell and Camila‚Ä¶. Ya know, after havana, we all expected better. Its not the worst song in the world but i mean‚Ä¶. The production is anticlimactic, camilas voice has the volume turned all the way up and she sounds so shrill i had to take off my headphones, and then it has the most awkward ending to the song ever. I am sad

**letsallpoo** (1): Camila teased this song for so long, then rush-released it like it was a turd begging to be pushed out. For a song made by two POC, it's amazing how they manage to sound off rhythm on their own song.

---

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): This is the song that my opinion has changed the most. When the song first came out, I would have given it a 4, 3 or perhaps a 0. Partly why I hated it so much was the production, pharells vocals, and the fact that this was promoted as a summer song, instead of She Love Control (which deserves to be the next single :mariah:). It was a while until someone kept bringing it up, and then I listened to it more. It grew on me so much, because it's such a bop. At first I hated the production, now I love it. I hated the vocals, but Camilas vocals shines while Pharrell tries to sing (he should just stick to producing imo). Camila singing in Spanish :hearteyes:

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): Look, I get why people hate this. It's not good enough to defy the fact that it doesn't sonically fit in with our contemporary mainstream pop landscape, and it sure as heck isn't gaining momentum. But even if this doesn't really live up to whatever Pharell was aiming for (I guess it's a trop...pop...something?) it's by no means as bad as forgettable as some people label it to be.

**tapdancingpig** (6.8): Have you ever gotten obsessed with unreleased demo tracks of an artist! Have you ever wondered ‚Äúwhy wasn‚Äôt this released?‚Äù This. This is why. The song has decent bones, but it needs a LOT more work than it got.

**MissyBee37** (10): I absolutely love this song and I wish it were on the actual album!! It's so, so good. I love the energy. I love the beat. It's such a hot, sultry song - it reminds me of what I love about "Havana," but totally different because it's just a fun dance song instead of a story. I love all the quirky little ad-libs and random bits. This has definitely been my song of the summer!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (1): I already covered all of this in my [Jukebox review](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/8n64t4/the_popheads_jukebox_week_68_the_indieheads/dzt7l5b/) but this song is just fucking trash, theres little redeemable here and every second of it makes me want to die, and the only thing thats changed is I used to like some parts of the instrumental and now I hate the entire thing.


---

**vayyiqra** (5): okay I'm not prejudiced buuuut I can't fucking stand Latin pop also sangria by definition is wine punch so what the hell other kind of sangria is there anyway now I want sangria which I am in fact a big fan of and also I guess it's kind of nice that she's singing in Spanish and the ending is alright like I said I'm not racist, some of my best friends are Hispanic

---

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): oh, the start of the 2018 pharrell hate circlejerk within stan twitter community. this song is such a bop but i understand why it flopped.

**hikkaru** (1): Pharrell produce a good song in 2018 challenge, Camila release and promote a third single from her album challenge

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): pharrell leave pop girls alone challenge

**Needlesslyrics** (3): our first warning that pharrell was going to fuck up Sweetener

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): this song is so weird, pharrell's been disappointing me lately

**twat\_brained** (1): The only female artist that gels with Pharrell is Rihanna. and Sometimes Missy Elliott. Other than that keep him the hell away from Camila and Ariana

**kanyewestrep** (1): pharrell ur my guy, but u missed with this one

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): does anyone here have good yaoi recommendations?

shipsinker44: 




**1998tweety** (10): A huge pop that does not deserve the slander it has been getting.

**rickikardashian** (9.6): I WILL DIE AND DROWN IN THIS BOAT BUT THIS SONG IS FREAKING GOOD AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE SONG OF THE SUMMER

**CreepyMannequin** (9.5): I groove to this

**jjs33072** (8.7): A bop but it's losing it's charm for me

**cyborglilith** (8.5): needed a few listens but is a bop

**acedino** (8): Bop that deserved better

**eklxtreme** (7.5): I like Camila's parts but I wish this was more upbeat with a better chorus

**TheShineSoul** (7): This is a mess but somehow it still bops. Should have been just a bonus track in Camila and not the next single to push.

**Leixander** (6): will this be the lowest scored song ever

**strawberryswing1** (6): this isn't great but it's not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be

**static\_int\_husp** (4): Man, how was *this* being hyped as the song of the summer. Deserved its flopping

**skargardin** (3): Yikes. This had massive potential but this is not the tea.

**ItsJustSketchyy** (2): Oh no Camila wat is u doin bby. The whole dance challenge thing felt really forced and was just embarrassing.

**frogaranaman** (1): Every single day at work I walk past the Sangria wine we have stocked and every single day I wish I was drunker than the last.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): lmao YIKES

**Me-Luigi** (1): it's just unlistenable

**MrSwearword** (1): Sangria Wine dreams with Two Buck Chuck means

**PuggleMaster** (1): this song is extremely bad girl what are you doing

**wailordfan\_** (1): I really really really hate this song so much and I'm not 100% sure why yet.

**Shipsinker44** (7): Okay im not zaras biggest fan but this is actually big bop. Arianas version is better because of the vocals

**letsallpoo**: I didn't bother scoring this (or listening to it tbh) but I just wanted to say that I think Shippy wrote his blurb at 5 in the morning and it shows a bit

---

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Wait, David Gutetta is still producing songs? I've never been a huge fan of sports anthems, in the first place, so maybe if I enjoyed watching sports I would have enjoyed this as a recurring song better, since it does fulfill the bare minimum of catchy, but I can't find anything about the song that actually makes it special. I can sense some leftover potential, but the production is too noisy and Zara's vocals are not good. It does its job, but no pay raise from me.

**frogaranaman** (4): Yep, this is a David Guetta song alright.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): david guetta is so crusty

**ImADudeDuh** (6): why is david guetta still here in 2018

**hikkaru** (4): it starts fine, lyrics a bit corny, and then the drop makes me want to die, thanks david! (do the edm rate in december! :kisskiss:)

**luigi\_is\_better** (8): wait zara sings this? wtf

**Me-Luigi** (4.5): let's just say it aged poorly and ariana's version is better

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): The Luke Combs song showed up on YouTube first, thats all you need to know.

shipsinker44: 
**Leixander** (9): kinda funny that this is for the European Cup but the video features Africa/Brazil, the producers mistook it for World Cup I guess

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): ok dis a bop

**eklxtreme** (7.5): this didn't age very well and it's just hard to focus on the song with all those synths

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Zara makes the best out of a bad situation by belting the living crap out of it.

**TheShineSoul** (7.5): Fine but generic as shit. Still bops.

**1998tweety** (7.4): Patriotic Queen

**ItsJustSketchyy** (6.5): I found this drop really disappointing. Zara absolutely kills it this song, but I just really couldn't get into the drop at all.

**MashLuke** (5): I hate this song so much

**MrSwearword** (5): as a soccer theme, it's mediocre...as a song by itself...it's mediocre.

---

**luigi\_is\_better** (7): karma got it's kiss for you bih. the first song from dua that i became addicted back when she had like 4 songs. a bit filler so i understand why it's not in the standard but still very good

**agentofscranton** (10): dua indiepa

**wailordfan\_** (10): WE SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED THIS IN THE REGULAR RATE. THIS GOES THE FUCK OFF AND IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE SOUNDING SONGS IN THIS ENTIRE RATE AND ROUNDS DUA OUT SO MUCH THAT IT IS ALMOST A NECESSITY FOR HER AS AN ARTIST. SELF TITLED REALLY WAS THAT BITCH, AND ROOM FOR 2 IS NEEDED TO REALLY REALIZE THAT.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): One of the quietest tracks from Dua's first era for sure. It doesn't really resemble any of her other songs from her debut, and while that isn't necessarily a bad thing, her whispery delivery, while interesting and at least somewhat memorable, isn't utilised well enough to truly make this into a bop.

**twat\_brained** (4): Dua should not sing choruses entirely in her lower register. This one makes me even drowsier than Homesick and that‚Äôs the slowest song on the album. In fact, can we re-release Dua Lipa and replace Room For 2 with One Kiss please? I‚Äôd love that.

**frogaranaman** (2): Haha, get it? Room For 2 gets a **2**? Hahaha, this song sucks.

**rotating3Dtext** (7): I can't stop thinking about Bitch by Allie X when I listen to this

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (6.5): We love an ASMR Queen, but not this song so much

**1998tweety** (9): This is one of my fav Dua songs and I'm sad it's not in the main rate.

**vayyiqra** (8): for some reason I keep thinking this is a cover anyway it would make a good left-field single I think idk

**acedino** (7.5): Duas low range is heavenly

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This is a weird direction from Dua, its unlike anything on DL1 for better or worse

**TheShineSoul** (6): Kinda a mess but it still sounds nice

**eklxtreme** (5): this is a joke of a chorus and a joke of a song

**MrSwearword** (5): the only misstep to Dua's name that I know of

**Shipsinker44** (8): This was a cute bop and not too much else. Im glad its on the deluxe version only because it doesnt really compare to the other songs on the album

---

**twat\_brained** (7.7): I realize now this song is not as dull as I think it is, but with an album that has songs like Hotter than Hell, Blow Your Mind, New Rules and Garden, it's gonna be hard for people to remember this one. It's uninspired but not wholly unforgettable.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Woah, Dua definitely gave us a lot of songs for her debut era...all the better, since she's a promising artist, but despite how catchy this is I'm not really sure it's in the top half of her discography. It's the kind of song that's good enough for you to not want to admit that it counts as filler.

**Me-Luigi** (9): deserved to be the single instead of IDGAF but they went for the male-ending theme new rules initiated

**frogaranaman** (6): This song is just like a hookup: pretty forgettable in the grand scheme of things but fun while its happening.

**Banananaise** (10): WHY is this one not on the album... when New Love screams 'bonus track'??? Dua Lipa exblain

---

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Fleetwood Mac is SHAKING

**luigi\_is\_better** (4): honestly just listen to the Fleetwood Mac song with the same instead

shipsinker44: **nahaalne** (10): This song is an absolute perfection to me, I love it so much

**Needlesslyrics** (10): YOU LOVE ME LIKE YEAH

**skargardin** (10): Hidden gem, one of my personal faves from Dua.

**eklxtreme** (9): incredible production and high energetic

**Gatyto2002** (9): Sadly, It is just a dream

**TheShineSoul** (9): Such a great song, it has single potential

**vayyiqra** (9): this shouldn't have been a bonus track because it's great but I realize the album was hella long so I understand leaving it off but I'm still a bit salty

**1998tweety** (8.4): This has a nice beat.

**MrSwearword** (7): peppy Dua still needs a lot work in a lot of cases, but at least this is cohesive with her other songs.

**Leixander** (4): nice for you guys to put this on bonus tracks, otherwise my dua average would be kinda low heh

**tapdancingpig** (4): Really boring. Dua has some good moments in here, but she also has some pretty bad vocal moments.

**cyborglilith** (1): wow this is trash

**Shipsinker44** (2): Congrats to Bleta Rexha, Radric Delantic Davis, and Tauheed Epps for making history by being on the first song eliminated from this pop prophecy rate! Unfortunately, this does 2 chainz and Gucci Mane wont be the next Main Pop Girl‚Ñ¢, but i dont think theyre too broken up about it. On this fun, inventive track, Bebe ventures into rap and really puts these rap gods up to the test,  where they struggle to keep up with her speed and flow. It has notable lyrics such as, ‚ÄúYou be lookin' at my ass, damn that thing Jurassic‚Äù, ‚ÄúShe love to call me daddy, I treat her like Pops‚Äù, ‚ÄúMattress, passion, satisfaction‚Äù, and finally, the most memorable lyrics of the song because its written like a Charl XCX chorus, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs It‚Äù repeated a whopping **70 times**. Poet Bleta stepped up her games on this one.

**letsallpoo** (3): I honestly believe she is doing her best.

---


**agentofscranton** (0): i hate this

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (0): Bebe has a worse flow than water in the Sahara. Chorus is lazy, unconvincing rhymes, and Gucci Mane of course

**OriginalKappa** (0): This is just fucking trash.

---

**MissyBee37** (2): Listen, Bebe, we just need to talk about that line, "you be lookin' at my ass, damn, that thing Jurassic." Wtf does that even mean?? I mean, girl's hot, but wouldn't calling it Jurassic make it old???

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Not gonna lie, I groaned when this came on. I generally dont like the current hip hop trends of pop music, but I think Bebe really pulled it off. Those rappers though... they are everything I hate about rappers turned up to 11. Im gonna do the normal person thing and try to ignore what theyre saying.

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): I think people like this song (maybe I'm wrong, I wouldn't be surprised if it went out first day) but I can't find a reason to actually enjoy it. The chorus isn't even enjoyably repetitive, and I feel like the sass she's going for here doesn't quite work.

**wailordfan\_** (4): It feels like Bebe has been trying to find a sound/tone that puts her in a different league/separates herself from other artists? It could also be that she is using a different vocal production. She is still lacking a bit in the lyrics department, and her vocal presence isn't here like it usually is.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.7): While Charli outsold with 10s and 11s Unlock It and I Got It, Bebe adds a bop to the list of *less than or equal to 3 word repeating choruses ending with "It" and 2 good rap features that may/may not overshine the main star*

---

**Me-Luigi** (7): she was really ready for that trap career

**frogaranaman** (2): Why does it sound like shes trying to be black?

**hikkaru** (4): This reminds me of a Bhad Bhabie song

**pillsxpotions** (8): What Bad Bitch wanted to be but could never!

---

**cyborglilith** (3): satisfaction OW

**ItsJustSketchyy** (3): Yeah Nah

**Leixander** (3): good BYE

**lady\_sable** (4): no

=====

shipsinker44: **eklxtreme** (9): I didn't expect this to actually slap but it rly does. I just wish bebe did more on the track.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): If you look at this as a Gucci song feat. 2 Chainz and Bebe, it's not bad

**jjs33072** (8.1): I feel like everyone hates this song but its lowkey my guilty pleasure.

**CanadianSkeleton** (8): Sounds like a lower-quality I Got It to me

**vayyiqra** (8): I weirdly like this despite the presence of 2 Chainz and Gucci Gang. the melody is so strange and unsettling but unique. (dassit.)

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): issa banger

**1998tweety** (7.2): Bebe spits bars

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): I LIKE 2 CHAINZ SUE ME

**therandomsinger13** (6.5): Too braggy and not enough backing track to cover it up. Kinda annoying. I guess the beat is alright. Kind of reminds me of I Got It. I like the high part at 1:55. Eventually sounds like she‚Äôs saying acid.

**CarlieScion** (6): why is everything bebe does so damn mediocre

**luigi\_is\_better** (6): filler as fuck but i really gucci's flow in this

**rickikardashian** (6): maybe i would like this if i liked rap more, but i guess well never know

**skargardin** (6): This .. kinda slaps

**AnimationJava** (3): This concept of being so rich and intimidating is so overdone in the music industry, it√≠s gotten tiresome for me.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): When I heard the 2 Chainz and Gucci Mane features I was like thats it?

**TheShineSoul** (3): Boring and it just doesn't sound great.

**twat\_brained** (2.7): What's the point of having 2 features if one of them is just gonna phone it right in? 2 Chainz at least put some effort into his. In any case, ‚ÄúThat's It‚Äù is absolutely NOT it.

**PeachPlumParity** (2): Why does she have so many songs with shitty rap features

**Glennishill** (1): The best thing I can say about this song is that I can put it on when Im suffering from insomnia and itll put me right to sleep.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): jesus christ all this production is fucking awful

**MrSwearword** (1): what the fuck is this trash...BEBE. HOW ARE YOU CLAIMING TO DODGE PAPARAZZI?!

**Me-Luigi** (0): I get the positive women supporting message but the execution sis.. the vocals and chorus are not it

**patronsaintofaspies** (0): Ugh, how do I say this? Look, I get Zara cares about female empowerment-if she was trying to market feminism then she wouldn't make a fuss about hating men-but from the first time I listened to this, I was struck by how...lifeless this was for a political track. It sounds really robotic, and it isn't helped by the fact that everything said in this song isn't anything new-something that would have been migrated if the production actually had any energy in it.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (0): A song where Zara can sing, but the lyrics are vague of supposed female empowerment are accompanied with some weird voice in the background sating that stupid refrain. Even by Zara's standards it's so bad, and that's saying a lot. I don't even know what the lyrics are, it's not directed at anyone or herself, they just exist? Again, the bridge is so much better than the rest of the song, with different production and better lyrics. Why is this a trend for her??? This is the type of song that Trump supporters would cite as reasons why the Left lost even though Zara is Swedish.

**TheShineSoul** (0): Bitch what the fuck.

---

**CarlieScion** (10): now i feel so empowered

**luigi\_is\_better** (8): we love a feminist anthem from a feminist queen

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Wow this song is actually really great except for the chorus, Im shocked

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Gets better as it goes along. I would like it a lot more if the beat was brought in before/during the first chorus.

**1998tweety** (7): This feels like a non-event.

**eklxtreme** (7): a very quotable song but nothing more than that

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): this couldve had so much meme potential

**rotating3Dtext** (6): weird

**twat\_brained** (5.8): This intro already sucks. I am not here for the repeated words between lyrics. This to me is just boneless Why Try. Hang on, this bridge has piqued my interest. This doesn't change my opinion of the song but instead raises it two points higher than I initially would've.

**jjs33072** (5.1): Love the verses

**agentofscranton** (5): with a title like that you'd think the song would be fun or something but this is just super boring

**Leixander** (4): uhh

---

**Me-Luigi** (9): it's not the best song on her but it got 100M streams on Spotify without being a single and some of my local friends know it, so she snapped

**twat\_brained** (8.6): This is the tightest beat on the entire EP. I can‚Äôt hear a damn thing Ty is saying here but I‚Äôm gonna treat that as me not being able to discern any damning lyrics to this song. Try as Bebe might she can't keep up with this absolutely phat beat but then again not many people could. Yes, I just said phat in 2018. I should not do rates with a cold.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): https://twitter.com/Tinashe/status/1022570098362478592

**wailordfan\_** (4): The steady beeping reminds me of Halsey's Hold Me Down, and there is an 'uh uh' around the 25 second mark that sounds exactly like the intro to Habits (Stay High) by Tove Lo. I also don't think I needed two pseudo-drops in the chorus? There is a strange flow/song structure to the whole song, with a new verse/bridge 30 seconds before the end of the song?

**SpanKKy1** (7.5): only bad bitches and rexhars can rate this song, perverts get the fuck out

**vayyiqra** (7): BAD BITCHES ONLY no srsly this is okay although it's repetitive and the lyrics are still kinda basic. this EP is alright but we can see she hadn't found her voice yet

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7.3): The most important song which spawned her biggest and most iconic performance, that live stream that changed the world where she said: This is for the Rexhars and the Bad Bitches only

**luigi\_is\_better** (5): but what about the perverts

**CanadianSkeleton** (4): [insert obvious comment about this song not being for perverts]

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): The comments for this are going to be full of memes, but I'm going to be quite frank here; Bebe's pervert rant did more to solidify her image than this song. It's supposed to act as a signature of sorts, but...eh, I fail to see anything fairly unique about it. The guest verse is pretty meh, too.

shipsinker44: **tapdancingpig** (9): Ah, the song she named her fans after. The small chorus on this song really works in ways that the others really dont.

**therandomsinger13** (9): Sounds in the background sound like Easy by Son Lux. Nice chorus. I was dancing.

**AnimationJava** (8.1): The best song from Pt 1, Bebe takes her iconic title as the bad bitch. It's very much a song about self-empowerment.

**cyborglilith** (8): dat beat

**eklxtreme** (7.5): it's catchy but generic

**PeachPlumParity** (7.5): It's a really good theme and concept but another song ruined by a mediocre rap verse.

**jjs33072** (7.2): Once again, would be so much higher without the feature.

**ItsJustSketchyy** (7): I didn't like the drop at first, but it definitely grew on me after it got stuck in my head.

**MashLuke** (6.5): that drop lmao

**TheShineSoul** (6.5): The weakest here but still sounds good in the EP and fits well.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): The chorus is horrendous - it sounds like a robot being stabbed. Also I don't see how paying your own bills makes you a 'bad bitch'

**nahaalne** (5): The chorus, why?

**CarlieScion** (4): fuck all of these mediocre rap features!!!

**MissyBee37** (4): Ugh. I hate the chorus and that effect on her voice for "bad bitch." The lyrics are so repetitive. No thanks.

**animefangrant62** (3): bebe sounds like a fucking sheep on this holy shit

**dramiaa** (3): The chorus ruins this for me

**ImADudeDuh** (3): generic

**JanuraryFourteenth** (3): Bad $ong eheheheeh

**OriginalKappa** (3): God Ty Dolla Sign isn't even bad but on both songs in this rate he totally phones it in, and Bebe is trying so hard to be badass but it just sounds desperate lol im sorry

**frogaranaman** (2): Its really funny that she isnt including herself when she refers to the group the generics.

**hikkaru** (2): that chorus is a C H O I C E.

**lilacsweetener** (2): Rihanna leftover?

Well, not to worry, it didnt do well here either. Bebe, the QUEEN of consistency! Tbh tho this song isnt good it sounds like every other hiphop pop bebe song

**letsallpoo** (4): +2 points for being better than the Zayn song with a similar title.

---

**TragicKingdom1** (0): this is why "trap pop" isn't really a thing that non-rappers should try

---

**luigi\_is\_better** (10): i unironically think this song is genius

**Me-Luigi** (10): and this its where she perfected her trap skills, it's 5 in the morning but better

[a note from poo: why do these two rexhars both have luigi in their usernames? this is a case for the fbi]

---

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I guess this is supposed to sound edgy and badass...? One reason why I'm giving this a slightly above average score is because I could see how the beat bops, kind of, but coming from Bebe of all people, it's not really something you gape your eyes at. Towards the end it becomes pretty annoying.

**tapdancingpig** (7): Ok, lets talk about these vocals, because whoever autotuned them has a problem with nice things. This is a half decent song, and it isnt aided by the effect like other songs are, and Bebe is a good enough singer that she just doesnt need it.

**misterralex** (9): A low-key underrated bop, Bebe shows off her range with I Got Time, singing with a trap backdrop to create a banger.

**twat\_brained** (5): Worried about what? ‚ÄúNuh"? ‚ÄúNut"? You clearly say ‚Äúworried about nothing" so what the hell is the shame in repeating it? If she got time why didn't she take the time to flesh this out or to leave this off the EP?

**wailordfan\_** (3): Holy shit this just goes on and on, and plays off like something that Jake Paul would release, and is as lyrically sharp as a Jake Paul song too.

**vayyiqra** (7): more songs about vaping or whatever tbh I feel like she's just Lana's character on Born to Die but more ethnic at this point

=====

shipsinker44: **eklxtreme** (8.5): rly catchy and she flows nicely on this

**AnimationJava** (7): This song is Bebe's Hakuna Matata, a chill bop that is made better by its lyrics.

**mudkip1** (7): her autotune is awful

**nahaalne** (7): Lowkey jam

**rotating3Dtext** (7): it has a dreamy feel (?)


**1998tweety** (6.8): Bebe please stick with pop over hip hop.

**PeachPlumParity** (6.8): It's almost really good but then there's the really annoying voice repeating everything she says and babbling in the background.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (6): Who‚Äôs doing Ad-libs in the background. The sign says ‚ÄúQUIET IN THE STUDIO‚Äù

**OriginalKappa** (6): Slightly better trap-ish pop than the dreaded 'That's It', but not much could be worse than that admittedly.

**CarlieScion** (5): why did bebe decide to make this the longest song????

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): So unconvincing - Bebe couldn't thug her way out of a paper bag

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (5): I don't got time to care about Bebe getting high

**TheShineSoul** (5): Decent enough, reminds me somehow of Pt. 1 but not that great.

**cyborglilith** (4): amazing lyrics!!

**jjs33072** (3.1): My least favorite Bebe song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): You got You and you got Time but you dont got any good music Bebe

**Glennishill** (2): I honestly hate any song that talks about how amazing peoples crews are.

**frogaranaman** (1): Oh my god, she really is trying to be black.

**lilacsweetener** (1): I'm sorry, I'm trying to like these songs but there is zero personality here

**MrSwearword** (1): Can you make time for songwriting, singing or personality lessons? You got time, after all.

**Shipsinker44** (8.5): Bebe‚Äôs songs are dropping like flies but lets be honest, nobody really cares since theyre definitely the worst in the rate. This song got pretty much what it deserved, a little better than last place but still very much a loser. How tragic. Ill stream Im a Mess to help you out in these hard times, because they wont be getting any easier, and it seems representative.

**letsallpoo** (4): In which Bebe comes up with a genius, never-been-done-before metaphor, and is hellbent on dragging it out as long as possible.

---


**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (5): Everything from how she says Gateway Drug and hurt or rather *huuuh*. This song is the perfect example of a good idea Bebe has, but the execution fails (like the rest of her EPs). I hate how she says Gateway Drug but the fast rap after is good and the prechorus :weary:. I struggled for so long on what score to give it because apart from that pronunciation, it lowkey bops.

**wailordfan\_** (6): Her lyrics are very 'upfront' I guess. She doesn't really love metaphors (even if the hook line is literally a metaphor) there isn't any grace or poise to her lyricism and it all kinda just feels shallow as a result?

**patronsaintofaspies** (3): Yikes, I can see why people would give this their 0s. This is meant to sound darker than the rest of the songs on this EP, I figure, which explains the...interesting production choices. Coupled with mediocre, shrill vocals, it makes for an immediate skip. Arguably the worst song from this era.


---

**CanadianSkeleton** (5): Bebe is the Gateway Drug To listening to country music

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): This album is the gateway drug to worse music

**RandomDKguy** (2): confiscate this drug please

---

**Me-Luigi** (10): THAT CHORUS, I was so snatched when I heard this for the first time

**1998tweety** (8.3): The verses are boring but I love the post-chorus.

**tapdancingpig** (8.2): This has one of the best choruses on the EP.

**PuggleMaster** (8): ngl the chorus is cringey but i still like the song

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): The bridge is lazy but the chorus makes up for it

**TheShineSoul** (10): This is a banger, not much to say. The chorus is SO GOOD.

**rickikardashian** (6.7): the chorus is pretty good, the rest of the song isnt

**MissyBee37** (6.5): I love the pre-chorus melody, fun chorus, cool vibe overall. A bit repetitive after a while, though, especially with all the vocal effects in the second half.

shipsinker44: **therandomsinger13** (9.5): Bada** bop! Lyrics are good and I like the bridge.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): this is so damn catchy and I love those synth parts

**jjs33072** (8.3): A full bop and a half, love the jarring production and the lyrics.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): Bebe is so much better as a soloist.

**vayyiqra** (7): "u up?" fuckbois have been put on notice. tbh I'm tired of trap beats but the breakdown in the middle is alright. also we don't need two songs on one EP about love=drug cliches, we get it, you vape

**CarlieScion** (6): :eh:

**cyborglilith** (5): wtf is she saying

**MrSwearword** (5): muddled POV and delivery. He breaks up via text but you're still wet from his kiss/sex? Gurl, pick one and attempt to do better.

**AnimationJava** (4): This song is too similar to Small Doses, the concepts are too similar and I find that boring.

**ItsJustSketchyy** (4): What is she even saying in the chorus? At least the beat/melody is okay.

**Raykel** (4): I don'tget it. I know she has an amazing voice, so why does she sound like this?

**twat\_brained** (3.2): Next.

**PeachPlumParity** (3): It's just Small Doses 2.0 but somehow even more boring.

**frogaranaman** (2): ..is there a single good song on this album?

**ImADudeDuh** (1): this is awful, who tf thought this production or the outro was a good idea

**Shipsinker44** (1): FINALLY ITS GONE. i CANNOT believe that this wasnt the very first song that was out. I am already not the biggest fan of this nigerian princess but it is ASTOUNDING that she or ANYBODY on her team thot it would be a good idea to create a song like this. I cannot imagine that this wouldve made it onto any main pop girl‚Äôs album and i dont know why they thought it would be good. This is why people hate pop and u know what im starting to hate it with this song, i am so grateful that it is GONE

**letsallpoo** (8): Invented counting. Honestly this is one of my favorite songs on this album, and I didn't expect it to be this low. I guess some /r/popheads users just got too confused when she started using numbers that were too high for them.

---

**luigi\_is\_better** (11): when i first heard this song i was traveling and i got really depressed to the point that i couldn't get out of my hotel room and yeah i sound like madonna i just really like this song and i dont know why

---

**frogaranaman** (4): Five Mississippi, I skip.

**MrSwearword** (1): I'll give Zara 'til five Mississippi to write a better song than this Platinum Star ass sounding bullshit.



**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): Julia Michaels wrote this song, and I unfortunately have a feeling that her rate record isn't going to improve because of it, although I may be wrong. Maybe it's because I'm eternally haunted by the 'how many ways are there to rearrange the letters in the word Mississippi' in class, but this is the point where the album descends from boppy to kind of boring.

**CanadianSkeleton** (6): Of course this was written by Julia Michaels

**Me-Luigi** (3.5): a boring ballad, would be better if Julia sung it herself 1 point deducted because she didn't write it

---

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): is this a nursery rhyme

**eklxtreme** (5): pls delete this miss larsson

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): I can get like 5 seconds into this song before this premise is just laughable and not at all emotional

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (6.5): What drives me insane about is that motherfucking Mississippi is the basis of the song, the chorus, and the song title. Everything apart containing the word Mississippi is alright, but just, no girl.

**1998tweety** (8): I like this song but the title is a mess.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Thought I was dealing with a ballad with the intro. Was pleasantly surprised

**tapdancingpig** (8): Darker than a lot of its neighbors. This one is definitely a grower, but Zaras serving vocals.

**Gatyto2002** (7.5): There's only one Mississippi

**TheShineSoul** (7): Nice ballad

**vayyiqra** (7): idk this kind of bops but I don't like the lyrics much

**twat\_brained** (6.7): Filler but might be cute live

**MissyBee37** (6.3): I like her concept for using counting to show how fast everything is up & down in this relationship.

**Glennishill** (6): This is fine.

**ulikejazz** (4): A beautiful song but I just cant stand those corny lyrics omg

**rickikardashian** (3.4): Hey. whose idea was this? OKay, cuz it sucks

**Shipsinker44** (8): Fuck fake friends is an anthem of a generation. Bebe serves the least annoying vocals of her career. G-Eazy spits a verse that turns me straight and is actually kinda good ngl. This song deserves to go straight to the top, but unfortunately, it failed. Is this this the same spot expectations debuted at

**letsallpoo** (2): A touching tribute to the remnants of Fifth Harmony.

---

**frogaranaman** (0): I imagine this song was recorded in the sleaziest, grimiest fucking locale the producers could find so this record could turn a profit and once Gerald Earl Gillum, the American rapper and record producer better known by his stage name G-Eazy, pulled up to the place, he walked over to Bebe and muttered in her ear, "Oh, fuck, Bebe girl.. this place has got me mad turned on right now."

**twat\_brained** (0): Ah, yes. The man who thinks he‚Äôs too good for Halsey so he goes and stuffs his dick in sme attention seeker to boost his ego. Hold up, what the fuck is this lyric? ‚Äúsigned titties and signed shirts‚Äù? Are you serious? I don‚Äôt care about any other songs, that is an immediate 0.

---

**gannade** (10): how i feel about /u/imadudeduh and /u/therokinrolla

**vayyiqra** (7): it's always a bad sign to me when a song begins with a male rapper yelping and also the lyrical themes of this song are basic and remind me of that one edgy girl you know who constantly vaguebooks about haters and loyalty but we all know that was Bebe in high school so go off I guess honey


**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): i love how shes censoring middle finger but not the word fuck lmao

**OriginalKappa** (1): I hate songs about 'fake friends'. Is this a thing any real people relate to? Most of us are just worried about having no friends at all. Also if Gerald could just stop appearing on every half assed deep cut on every pop album that would make my life a lot better

---

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): go away gerald

**luigi\_is\_better** (3.5): F.G.E.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): Fuck Fg-eazy Features

**MissyBee37** (8.5): Yes! I love her songwriting here. There aren't enough songs about friends, and this is a relatable, fun song about how frustrating fake, flakey people are. I'm with you, Bebe! Catchy chorus, too. I could do without G-Eazy's verse but it's OK.

**PuggleMaster** (10): I know G Easy is bad and all, but i really like this.

**hikkaru** (4.5): can G-Eazy stop please

**therandomsinger13** (8.5): Production is great. Bebe is good. Get out of here G-Eazy you cheating jerk.

**1998tweety** (8.4): This is such an anthem, G-Eazy isn't awful but I'd prefer if it was just Bebe.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7.9): This song would be an 8.5 but G-Eazy brings this down. Everything else is good, but Bebe is more than capable of carrying this BOP by herself, like she doesn't need these fake bitches.

**PeachPlumParity** (7.5): This is a great song and I love the title/message. I took off a point because G-Eazy is shit though. At least his rap verse was related to the song.

**TheShineSoul** (7.5): This should be cringy but it somehow it works, even with G-Eazy and all.

**CarlieScion** (7): a bop but fuck g-eazy

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Bebe's part is repetitive and G-Eazy is... himself

**jjs33072** (5.6): G-Eazy feature is unnecessary.

**Me-Luigi** (8): bit repetitive but cute message and it's a good verse from gerald

**AnimationJava** (6.8): Bebe takes a break from talking about her relationship to complain about L.A.'s (and her personal issue) with fake friends, the lyrics are good but G-Eazy's rap and the instrumentals are both forgettable.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5.5): I don't know whether I like Bebe's parts on this song or not but they're okay enough for me to keep listening. G Eazy's part, though? Well, it's not quite atrociously bad, but you can't listen to it and wonder if him not having any real friends is a fault on his partHalsey made the right decision.

**tapdancingpig** (8): Good lyrics, and I think the small chorus actually fits this song. The utter lack of subtlety helps sell this one, though. G-Eazys verse is pretty solid, and also pretty polite.

**ulikejazz** (5): that feature dropped this from a 7 to a 5

**Shipsinker44** (6): Yet another Bebe song is out and i am tired. This song is okay, its a bit awkward but its a bop.

---

**lilacsweetener** (0): I've reached the point of frustration. It might not even be the worst song in the rate, but Bebe droning on about someone *else* getting too comfortable after two EPs of the same thing over and over...enough is enough. Zero!

---


**patronsaintofaspies** (8): A bit of a ballad right before we end All Your Fault, but to my surprise, I ended up really liking this. This actually touches upon themes I learned in my psychology class about how a relationship becoming less exciting over time can deteriorate communication between the parties involved so I can understand why Bebe's feeling anxious in the lyrics.

**tapdancingpig** (8): Easily my favorite feature on the album. Another trop-bop, and Bebe kills it (side note: whenever I see people talking about a Bebe song called Comfortable, I think of Sad from Expectations).

**Shipsinker44** (6): Bebe decided to finally give some other girl their time to shine <3 thats so sweet of her. We STILL have yet to see any Dua or Camila song be eliminated, and hint, they wont be eliminated next either! Would you like to guess who‚Äôs gonna be out next? No really go ahead, #42 will shock you!

---

**ItsJustSketchyy** (0): Stink is a disgusting word, I immediately picture a neckbeard Zara and I just can't.

----

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): "i dont wanna shower even if i stink" is such a relatable lyric for depressed people thanks zara baby

**therandomsinger13** (9): ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna shower even if I stink‚Äù Wow this is currently me doing the rate I procrastinated instead of showering. Zara redeemed herself and that‚Äôs one of the only reasons this is getting a nine.

**cyborglilith** (8.7): the first line is the most relatable lyric Ive ever heard

**TheShineSoul** (8.5): Queen of not showering.

**CanadianSkeleton** (8): ew at the first line tho

**1998tweety** (7.6): The opening line to this song is so gross. Little Mix outsold.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): What the hell is that shower line? Did a child write that down? The song in itself is alright, but it looks like Zara decided to copy Bebe's shtick of slightly above average songwriting coupled with a chorus that I'm not sure whether to call abrasive or not.

**dramiaa** (6): ...she should probably take a shower

**hikkaru** (6.5): Zara, PLEASE take a shower you smell like Post Malone took a bath in the sewers with Camila's family

**rickikardashian** (7): I know what homegirl was trying to convey with that I don't wanna shower, even if I stink, cause I don't wanna wash you off my skin, but damn bitch you just sound nasty

**Me-Luigi** (1): that opening line.. the lyrics... the vocal... it's not it zara,can't believe this was a single on Sweden, 1 point deducted because she didn't write it

**MrSwearword** (1): "I don't wanna shower/even if I stink" YOU MUSTY BITCH, GET IN THE DAMN SHOWER AND WASH OFF THE SEX MUSK

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT OPENING LINE LMAOOOOOO

**ulikejazz** (7): I mean, that first sentence is so.. off-putting, and the chorus gets a little scream-y for my taste. But other than that, this is cute!

**eklxtreme** (5): poor opening line and obvious filler :(

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (5): Ellie Goulding did it better. also sis, songs about bad hygiene is not the tea

**CarlieScion** (1): the opening lyric was a Choice

**chrisw99** (5): Would be higher if the atrocious 1st line wasnt there

**Raykel** (4): Sis please wash your pussy

shipsinker44: **strawberryswing1** (7.5): bit too long but the instrumental is really chill and nice

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): I mean it's okay but I'm going to remember what it sounds like when the reveal comes

**skargardin** (7): This slaps live but the studio version is not nearly as good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Like the guitar in this one, one of the better instrumentals on the album

**vayyiqra** (7): this is good as album cuts go I guess

**agentofscranton** (6): i forgot this song immediately after it finished

**JanuraryFourteenth** (5): meh

**OriginalKappa** (4): Becomes pretty abrasive when she tries to hit those high notes.

**PeachPlumParity** (4): Wow the intro before she started singing was really good but then the rest of the song happened

**tapdancingpig** (4): Eh. Some of these lyrics are bizarre, but other than that, I have no feelings about this one.

**twat\_brained** (4): This doesn't sound like the Zara I've been exposed to on the radio, I'd hoped the album was more boppy like the singles would've led me to believe

**jjs33072** (3.1): Better than half the album, but still just missing personality IMO

**frogaranaman** (1): I cant even come up with a good roast for this, the song just kinda does that to itself.

**Shipsinker44** (5): Were u surprised it wasnt a Bebe song? Because i was! Dont worry though, we will be coming back to Bebe soon enough today. For now though, we might wanna focus on Zara. This is not zaras worst song and actually in terms of energy, its fairly good at being upbeat and keeping your attention. Unfortunately, as soon as the song ends, its just completely forgettable.

---

**static\_int\_husp** (0): this ones just annoying

---

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Not really a fan of whoever Wizkid is and his feature, but I don't think it's as bad as I've seen some people claim it to be. This is one of my favourite deep cuts from this album, because of Zara's excellent vocals during the chorus-despite being just a bit danceable, it's quite the chill bop.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7.5): The song is alright but the switch in production to the trap beat in the bridge is soo much better than the rest of this. It makes me want a whole song like the bridge, with Zara over a trap beat. It would be amazing, a 9, but instead we get another song on this album with an acceptable rap feature. The song is lowkey a bop, but the bridge shows how much better it could be.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Zara Larsson makes music for those little shops that sell shitty stick figure t shirts on the boardwalks of beach towns

**vayyiqra** (8): okay this would have been a huge hit in 2013 [insert dated/flop/generic/etc. comment] and it's making me weirdly nostalgic but the breakdown is kind of mediocre idk

**frogaranaman** (4): I paused Father John Misty for this song which was a terrible decision.

**SpanKKy1** (1): zara is more nigerian than this wizkid flop will ever be

shipsinker44: **cyborglilith** (9): summer B O P

**eklxtreme** (9): idk if it's autotune but her chorus vocals are perfection and there's a rly fun vibe overall

**acedino** (8.5): Wizkids adlibs throughout ruin the song slightly

**therandomsinger13** (7.9): Sounds like Dame Tu Cosita. I like the weird vocals samples in the bridge.

**tapdancingpig** (7.8): I love me a two part chorus! WizKid has a great feature, and that bridge is the most brilliantly weird moment on the album.

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is okay, the bridge takes it down a bit.

**dropthehammer11** (7): the breakdown towards the end bangs

**pillsxpotions** (7): The feature kind of ruins this otherwise perfect song.

**tf2manu994** (6.7): the .7 is for the last minute

**twat\_brained** (6.4): Tbh dancehall doesn't really suit Zara. And WizKid doesn't add much to the song, truth be told.

**Gatyto2002** (6): No more Get on the bounce

**TheShineSoul** (6): Becomes boring after a few listens.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): IDK it's not very good

**MrSwearword** (5): too boring for derision

**jjs33072** (4.6): A bop

**Raykel** (4.5): This rapper is just purely awful

**ImADudeDuh** (4): why tho

**OriginalKappa** (4): Sounds amateurish, obligatory tropical track.

**Me-Luigi** (3): camila and bebe their trap pop is much better, that chorus is just bad, surprised this needed 8 writers and 4 producers, Wizkid is not good on it

**JanuraryFourteenth** (2): DRAKE

**PeachPlumParity** (2): Ok no what is this shitty drop with a rap verse and weird pitch changed vocals.

**Shipsinker44** (9): Oh my goosh, i love meant to be. Fortunately since i dont listen to the radio the curse of overplay never got me, and i started liking bebe around the time AYF part 2 came out, and Meant to be was instantly my favorite. I mourn the loss of this song, but i do undertsand how annoying its become for yall.

**letsallpoo** (5): Literally invented country music. I remember making fun of the chorus when we reviewed this for the Jukebox, saying how poetic it was to hear Bebe sing "If it's meant to be! Baby just let it be!" as she desperately releases a FGL collaboration to hopefully claw her way up the Billboard charts, but I kinda had to eat my words after this song blew up. I don't find it nearly as offensive as some of y'all do - it's a cute song, and their distinctive vocals go surprisingly well together - but I can't say I'm pressed (or surprised) at how low this is.

---

**CreepyMannequin** (0): ATROCIOUS!

**Glennishill** (0): Country music is a plague and Bebe is a carrier in this song.

**hikkaru** (0): The queen of country music has arrived, and she's here with an extremely boring and irritating song featuring Florida Georgia Line who serve grating vocals that annoy me to no end. The trapish/countryish/whatever production is bad and uninteresting and even as someone that barely listens to country, I hate the fact that this of all songs is having the most success and setting records atop the country charts. One of my least favourite hit songs of 2018 and definitely the worst in this rate imo.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (0): Sorry Bebe, but you can‚Äôt do country and Florida Georgia Line are those cousins you try to ignore at family gatherings so I‚Äôm giving this a 0.

**MissyBee37** (0): I fucking hate Florida Georgia Line.

**mudkip1** (0): no.

---

**AnimationJava** (8.5): This is Bebe's crowning achievement so far, her four week long Billboard #2. A song about letting go of fears/worries with a friend/loved one, I feel as though her role is minimized in comparison to the featured artist√≥ which takes away from the quality of the song IMO but overall it's still strong.

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Ok, I wish that a different song of hers was the breakout hit, but the song is pretty cute, and this is FAR from the worst country song on the airwaves (and it got Expectations made, so why not?). I prefer the radio edit with minimal FGL, even though they still sing the line that makes me want to die: Hold up, girl, dont you know youre beautiful/And its easy to see? Excuse me while I find a trash can to throw up in.

**twat\_brained** (7.4): I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this but I haven‚Äôt heard this on the radio in awhile and I actually kind of miss it. Whoever the vocalist for FGL is does NOT shine in the way Bebe does not do I think this song ticks the box for what is considered ‚Äúcountry" but it's far more listenable than what else is on the EP.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (4): Perhaps the most confusing song on this rate. I have kept listening to this to see what I could rate it but I don't know if I like it or hate it. I can't stand the guys voice, but I like Bebes vocals on this. I'm split on the production because hearing it by itself is bad but it becomes tolerable when they start singing over it.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Funny story. I first heard this song on my Spotify and I thought it was Original Pinoy Music because Bebe speaks Filipino at the end (also, it's exactly the type of sappy ballad you'd hear on Filipino radio) so when I recognised it was a fucking Bebe Rexha song I cackled. Her Filipino is...interesting. It seems that people are really fucking annoyed by having to hear a Florida Georgia Line song on pop radio. I am, too, to be fair, but I don't think this song is any worse than inoffensive if you ignore the hick accents. Actually, I'd give it a higher score if it was done by different people. Anyway, Bebe's a country queen, I suppose.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (2): Im getting serious flashbacks to when that one song they had with Nelly was on the radio and the fact that I have to hear this multiple times a week is enough reason to ban Florida Georgia Line from collaborating with pop or rap artists ever again

**frogaranaman** (1): This song sounds like what it feels like to watch a dirt-covered hillbilly straight couple that have a collective three teeth fuck in the back of their red MAGA pickup truck while the man is yelling at me about how gay sex is an abomination while he rams his penis into the wrong hole of his fourth wife's vagina.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): If you listen closely, you can hear the exact moment that Bebe realized this sound was far more profitable than literally anything else she developed on these EPs.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i actually love Florida Georgia Line kink shame me pls

**Shipsinker44** (9): Tbh this is a huge bop why is it so hated???/ why is it OUT??? Tasteless prevails again smh this couldnt even get a 7 average thats so sad yall hate bebe so much

**letsallpoo** (2): This song is so hilariously bad to me. "I'll never ever sing like Whitney.............*off-key yodeling*" - it's like she's proving to us why she doesn't. Anyway I couldn't give this a 1 because the chorus is cute and because I can always come back to the intro if I want a laugh.

---

**chrisw99** (0): Laughably bad

---

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Oh, hey, generic empowerment anthem! I heard this in a fast food restaurant once and I cringed, but now I actually like the fact that it also acknowledges people who are just...ordinary, not incredibly talented or anything. Sure, it's been treaded on before, but these things are presented as flaws so often so it's nice to see them pop up. The melody is also genuinely appealing, which is better than a lot of Bebe's other songs. I just try to pretend Lil Wayne's verse doesn't exist, though.

**MrSwearword** (10): despite Wayne being on this track, Bebe Rexha singing she'll take what she can get is the instance of self-awareness she's shown and I respect that.

**strawberryswing1** (2): i really can't stand when artists try to repurpose a classic old song to make an easy hit. the only reason this song is somewhat catchy is not due to any talent on bebe's part, *certainly* not on lil wayne's, but it is because whitney herself is a legend who should not be disrespected this way. i wanna give this a 1 but the chorus, thanks to whitney, is nice and catchy.

**OriginalKappa** (10): OK THANK YOU BEBE YOU MADE ONE GOOD SONG i mean it's not the best in this rate but it was one of my contenders for an 11. It's so upbeat, Lil Wayne doesn't try too hard but it's pretty much excusable and it's guaranteed to make me smile each time.

**rickikardashian** (8.9): Look, I can excuse bad grammar for the sake of the song if its necessary, but the fucking sound of *are* and *am* are the same. The double *are*s dont even sound all that good. Also most pretty kind of bothers me too. Also fun fact, Bebe used the term more prettier on her Genius explanation of the song which makes this even better

**PeachPlumParity** (8.5): Another good song ruined by a bad rap feature smh when will labels learn we don't give a shit which overdone rapper you put on a song it will still flop. Like honestly if Lil Wayne wasn't auto-tune wailing in the background like someone punched his babymakers I would have given this a perfect ten.

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): Im not a fan of Lil Wayne, and the title lyric is dumb, but this song is just so fun. It makes me smile so much. Its tinged with a little bit of loneliness, but it makes that optimism mean more. Ok, thats a bit of a stretch, but I really like this song, ok?

**twat\_brained** (6): Lil Wayne and Bebe Rexha are a terrible combination. I‚Äôm not impressed by the audible lighter noises nor Weezy shouting ‚ÄúTunechi" at odd points in the song. What makes it even worse is that there's real potential in this song but it goes right out the window with Lil Wayne's presence. Thankfully there's only three more songs to get through.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (3.5): "I'll never ever sing like Whitney". Lil Waynes on this is the epitome of an unnecessary rap feature in a pop song, and it makes it worse that its heavily autotuned to the point of it grating your ears. "The way I are" feels wrong everytime I hear because its grammatically incorrect and takes me out of whatever Bebe is trying to say.

---

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): The beat is nice but like, we can tell youre not Whitney, its okay, you dont have to mention it, also Im deducting two points for Wayne doing whatever he was doing

**MashLuke** (7.5): I used to think this was a mashup between Whitney and Timbaland

**RandomDKguy** (5): We love Just Dance Commercial

shipsinker44: **MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): woulda been a 10 if it was the Dance Without Lil Wayne version

**therandomsinger13** (9): Fun. Lil Wayne sure loves his auto tune.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): I think she should've gotten someone else for the guest verse, but this is rly catchy and should've been big

**PuggleMaster** (8.5): The solo version is a big 10, but lil wayne is SO bad on this it's tragic.

**dramiaa** (8): Yeah girl, you may never sing like whitney, doesnt mean you can get away with this  -cringy- song title. Too bad this song is actually good lmao (though lil waynes verse is almost unlistenable)

**misterralex** (8): The chorus is infectiously catchy

**static\_int\_husp** (8): As a solo song this would be favorite song of Bebe's two EPs. But Wayne does **not** fit in here.

**1998tweety** (7.7): I don't want to see y'all shittalking Lil Wayne.

**AnimationJava** (7.5): A kind of mesh of Whitney√≠s classic, this is Bebe√≠s first take on romance in Pt 2. It√≠s cute.

**Leixander** (7.4): i warmed up to this, hated it on release tho

**CarlieScion** (7): this couldve been good, but like without bebe and lil wayne

**luigi\_is\_better** (7): i didnt even get bothered by the title but her argument for it just doesn't make sense at all

**TheShineSoul** (7): A great generic bop, I like it and eventually Lil Wayne's verse grew on me.

**jjs33072** (6.3): Bebe and Wayne need to go to school to learn grammar but that's ok still a bop.

**hikkaru** (6): Bebe and this song are so milquetoast, she shouldn't have the right to quote one of the most fun songs ever.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): this had potential, but Lil Wayne is terrible and it's not terribly original

**vayyiqra** (6): this started off good but Weezy adds little to this. Timbaland is not shook

**rotating3Dtext** (5.8): lil wayne is grating and I don't understand why she uses grammar like that

**Banananaise** (5): jesus christ that rap verse brought this down a whole point

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this really couldve been good and then there was the fucking lil wayne feature

**Me-Luigi** (5): it's subtly trash

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): i was gonna let the pointless grammar change pass but the feature kind of ruined my sympathy

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (4): Worst Whitney Houston ripoff since 'Somebody'.

**dropthehammer11** (4): i love lil wayne but that was not good

**Glennishill** (4): I was grooving with this song but Jesus is Lil Wayne awful and out of place here.

**MissyBee37** (4): Ugh, I hated "the way I are" as a lyric when Timbaland did it and I hate it here, too, lol. The chorus melody is cute!

**animefangrant62** (3): lil wayne helped but bebe is still on the track

**gannade** (3): this is the most disrepectful thing to whitney after lordes stupidly insensitive bathtub instagram post

**ItsJustSketchyy** (2): Yeah that's gonna be a -6 for Lil Wayne's part alone.

**wailordfan\_** (2): This is just disrespectful putting Wayne on vocoder harmonies to a song dedicated to Whitney tbh.

**cyborglilith** (1): l m f a o at that rap

**frogaranaman** (1): I really didnt think this string of songs could get worse but it did.

**lilacsweetener** (1): There's just...nothing happening here? Sounds like an automated robot machine was designed to shart out generic chart tunes...

**mudkip1** (1): no.

**Needlesslyrics** (1): Lil Wayne sounds awful what the hell

**Shipsinker44** (8): This track is so heavily overhated, its such a cute song and actually offers some really nice and fresh sounding production. Its so happy and upbeat it just makes me giddy, if you ever have a sad day, this is the go-to song

**letsallpoo** (4): This is gratingly cheery, like a nursery school rhyme you'd find on Youtube with an obscene number of views. Camila's voice is particularly unbearable here.

---

**gannade** (0): kinda sounds like what kiely williams would make if she went latin

**MashLuke** (0): the grating kind of cute

---

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I usually take a liking to songs that have a catchy beat that have a focus to their rhythm, because I can always identify the sections of the melody I like the best and I can assign a pattern to them. While this song isn't groundbreaking or super special, it still fits that criteria, so I'm fond of hearing it.

**tapdancingpig** (6): Its catchy, but kinda repetitive and a little annoying... Ok, fuck it, its WAY too repetitive and annoying, and this is coming from a person who listens to Unlock It and I Got It on repeat periodically.

**AnimationJava** (6.5): Shawn Mendes's favorite song off the album, at least it's somebody favorite! Notably this is the only song in the whole album with Spanish lyrics. A cute song about infatuation.

**MissyBee37** (9): Cute, sunny, fun little bop. This song just makes me smile!

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This entire front side of this albums bops

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): A cute bop! The calypso in the background is great!

**twat\_brained** (8.6): For once I'm gonna say Britney did it worse; I'm totally feeling the island vibes here!

**1998tweety** (8.5): This song is so unfairly hated, sure its not a standout track but its groovy.

**cyborglilith** (8): < all these years

**lady\_sable** (8): this rlly cute

**PeachPlumParity** (8): Y'all haters swerve me, this song is a fucking bop and I don't care that it sounds like it came from the pixar movie.

**jjs33072** (7.2): A mini havana, just wish it was longer.

**dropthehammer11** (7): a b0p

**OriginalKappa** (7): I'm pretty sure you could add steel drums to literally anything and I would give it at least a 7 lol

**skargardin** (7): Cute bop

**TheShineSoul** (7): Initially I thought this was boring but it grew on me a lot. Fun, chill, summery bop.

**vayyiqra** (7): the steel drum here is weird also what is this song even about it's a weird metaphor tbh

**rickikardashian** (6.8): This sounds like the song Nicki made with Calvin Harris lmao

**eklxtreme** (6): the instrumental and the chorus are kinda cheesy, like they wanted to delve deeper into the aesthetic that Havana created

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): She stole the worst parts from The Chainsmokers song of the same name - bad chorus, lackluster vocals

**lilacsweetener** (5): Would have to be a 5H leftover...

**frogaranaman** (3): https://i.imgur.com/vxjy1mj.gifv

**Shipsinker44** (8): This was really cute honestly. Its not really a great song and i felt about as much emotion as zara gave off (none) but it was a cute listen and i would describe it as a scrapped song from Meghans Treat Myself album (coming 2019)

---

**patronsaintofaspies** (5.5): It took surprisingly long for a clear cut ballad to appear, but here it is. It's....kind of dull. I'm sad Zara didn't get the chance to prove herself with some sort of huge power ballad, although maybe Funeral fits that description, but it's not very good, either.

**luigi\_is\_better** (8.5): "dont you think i give a fuck about who you fuck" is iconique and im sure that y'all are gonna make this song dirty

**MrSwearword** (10): I'll grant her mercy for at least having a piano and pleasing vocals on this. Even Zara Larsson could do a sort of ballad like this correctly.

**CarlieScion** (4): This was a very emotional ballad up untill the "I hope you can't get it up"

**rickikardashian** (6.9): where did that random ass line about not being able to get hard come from?

**1998tweety** (8.3): This is nice, nothing too special though.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I know I couldn't escape this album without a ballad; at least this one isn't completely terrible

**Leixander** (7.5): cute

**CanadianSkeleton** (7): Poor lyrics but it was nice hearing a ballad after all of this repetition in the production

**eklxtreme** (7): cute but pretty generic

**Glennishill** (7): As good as it gets on this album.

**tapdancingpig** (7): Theres good stuff here, but this could have used a little tightening.

**vayyiqra** (7): too fatigued to come up with a witty comment

**TheShineSoul** (6.5): This is the weaker ballad on the album

**twat\_brained** (6.1): I wouldn't seek this out again but I don't entirely hate it either

**PeachPlumParity** (5): I was getting into it but then she repeated the song title a hundred times.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): This is one of the rare times that an f bomb makes a song worse

**jjs33072** (4.4): Love the lyrics

**OriginalKappa** (4): And here's the obligatory piano ballad that ends every modern pop album

**frogaranaman** (3): Im really confused about the direction the last half of this song took.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (3): Just boring

**cyborglilith** (2): y

**Me-Luigi** (1): I get it, a piano ballad to close the album, but it's basic, 1 point deducted because she didn't write it

---

**eklxtreme** (0): she could do a much better ballad but this is very very generic


---

**CarlieScion** (10): :emofish:

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): One of Camilla's biggest mistakes on this album was to group three of her ballads into the middle of the album, all lined up together, which takes away your appreciation of how good they are. This one is the first, so you can still like it for what it is; a decent ballad, though she may not have the voice to carry it.

**therandomsinger13** (8.3): Good. Bridge sounds a little off.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I really like it but the bridge really dragged the song down.

**ItsJustSketchyy** (8): Apparently I love ballads. This is news to me.

**MissyBee37** (8): Her lyrics are strong & heartbreaking in this pretty ballad. I don't love the ooh-ooh-oohs.

**PeachPlumParity** (8): This is a sad bop. But a bop nonetheless.

**skargardin** (8): The superior ballad

**strawberryswing1** (8): cute, and a good ballad, but not one i revisit if i'm not listening to the album.

**AnimationJava** (7.2): Consequences is lyrically strong & clear, talking about a past relationship that might have seemed like a lot of fun but took a toll on Camila.

**MrSwearword** (7): better production than vocals for sure

**jjs33072** (6.9): Love the lyrics, heart crushing.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): It's a nice enough ballad but I guess it's pretty boring tbh

**hikkaru** (6): token piano ballad

**letsallpoo** (10): This is a fun song! I love the horns! Leave Zara alone :(

---

**MashLuke** (10): this is sort of underrated. I really like the lyrics and the instrumental is so nice and smooth, it puts me in a good mood. It's relaxing and cute.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): With a title like this, I was expecting a pretty dull ballad or something similar, but I actually like the feeling of anxiety portrayed in this song. It's not as show-stopping as some of the other tracks, but it shows that she's still going strong in the middle of the album-which is always a good thing.

**vayyiqra** (8): at first I was thinking this was generic until the synth came in and it's just weird enough to make it work instead of being a Halsey outtake

**twat\_brained** (6.2): I'm doing that thing where I wait until the end of the song to write a comment but the problem with that is that I immediately start the next song so I have to think about that. That being said I've kind of become numb to the album so I don't really have anything to say that would add to most of the cuts anyway.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): why the fuck is one of those Otamatones sound like its in the drop ASDJVNADJVNCSLDAKVMNDASBVKNSA

---

**Me-Luigi** (9.5): this is actually excellent, ed sheeran's songwriting ability really shines here compared to the rest of the album and this should have been a single outside of Sweden

**eklxtreme** (9): love her voice on this. ed sheeran can rly help make a bop if he wants to

**MissyBee37** (2): I was into this song until the 1 minute mark when that farting horn sound came & ruined what could've been a pretty ballad. R.I.P. Also, Ed Sheeran wrote this??? I know popheads will disagree but I wish he'd kept it. I really hate the production here, but it's a pretty song underneath! I would've loved to hear it with just his guitar.

**Shipsinker44** (7): Surprisingly this was good which i wasnt expecting from the song title but i wish it was much more stripped down and‚Ä¶ well, not a love story tbqh. With a title like this i wanted something interesting

---

**animefangrant62** (0): I hate everything about how this sounds

---

**therandomsinger13** (9.4): Play this at my funeral.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ugh i wanted to make a joke about rather being at a funeral instead of listening to this album but this bops

**twat\_brained** (7): The way the verses have all this buildup only for the chorus to have every other beat reminds me a lot of "Heaven in Hiding" by Halsey. And I like the subversion in thinking that a song called "Funeral" would be sad, but instead carries optimistic connotations in a way.

**Me-Luigi** (6.5): this has the same producer as the excellent bebe bop (Not) The One but the structure of this song is just something I don't get.. the build-up to that slow chorus with questionable vocals.. why?

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): Ugh, I've recently undergone a funeral procession, so I don't really like hearing the symbolism here. That being said, I understand that this was done to bring attention to Zara's vocals here, although, honestly, they sound slightly off-putting to me. My main problem with this is that i'm not sure whether it's suppose to be a ballad or a banger.

**PeachPlumParity** (4): I can't believe they put all these filler songs in the middle so I have to listen to them all before I get to Symphony, the last decent song on the album.

**MrSwearword** (8): cute production and good thing this song is called "Funeral" considering this album has bored or repulsed me to death.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This is my favorite Arcade Fire album, cant believe she fit the entire thing on her own album

shipsinker44: **TheShineSoul** (10): LOVE THIS SONG, best one after Lush Life to be honest, this is underrated.

**1998tweety** (8.8): A power ballad.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.5): A GOOD song, the production works well with her vocals.

**vayyiqra** (8): edgy lyrics, about what I would expect from her tbh

**tapdancingpig** (7.7): Pretty good heartbreak song. There are a couple of things that annoy me, but its overall a pretty strong song.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): "throw us a funeral", wow dramatic

**eklxtreme** (7): kinda catchy but forgettable

**CanadianSkeleton** (6): This beat is getting redundant after 13 tracks of it

**OriginalKappa** (6): Melodramatic to the point of parody but it's still enjoyable.

**skargardin** (6): This album is just packed with forgettable bops

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): It's really overwrought and the chorus and verses don't match tempo which is weird

**frogaranaman** (3): I wish I was at a funeral instead of listening to this song.

**jjs33072** (2.3): Once again, I just don't like it

**Shipsinker44** (7.5): I like the song but the vocals and the background production and ESPECIALLY the adlibs are so awkwardly put together. Her voice saves it but this song couldve been so much better with a better producer there to just enhance everything in the song slightly and finetune it.

**letsallpoo** (1): those demonic "ahh" noises at the end of the song sound so terrible

---
**cyborglilith** (11): All These Years

---


**dropthehammer11** (10): I FUCKING LOVE THIS SONG. the guitar chords are beautiful, the lyrics are bittersweet, the vocals are beautiful

**1998tweety** (8.4): This is a cute song but I feel like it drags on a bit at the end, either make the song shorter or add something else. The lyrics are a mood though and its placed perfectly in the album.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): It's obviously not that boring, because if it was, that'd mean that Camila and her team would be stupid enough to turn off listeners two songs into the album. What elevates the song from being merely average, in fact, is the sense of nostalgia in it; I'm not talking about a stylistic throwback, but rather the effect this song has on the listener to convince them that Camila really is singing about somebody she knows from her childhood. It's still not what I'd have followed Never Be The Same up with, but it's decent and it serves its purpose.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Probably the least talked about Camila song besides Somethings Gotta Give, and with good reason - its quite boring and conventional.

**wailordfan\_** (6): Knowing the next two songs in the album, this seems like a really weird placement for this song, and walks a strange line between ballad and... something else?

**AnimationJava** (7): A ballad about seeing an old crush after a long time and realizing that a part of you deep down still feels for them. Lyrically strong, very soft, and vulnerable. Camila's emotion shows through in this song.

**OriginalKappa** (4): So popheads will trash Ed Sheeran constantly but give a pass to Camila who released this carbon copy of his worst stuff?

**frogaranaman** (1): ..*this* is what were settling for as a pop prophecy?

shipsinker44: **chrisw99** (10): Love the vocals at the end

**lilacsweetener** (10): Just works on every level, so satisfying and ends too soon, but still feels complete.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is highkey a ripoff of Biebers Love Yourself but its cute tho

**therandomsinger13** (8.5): Bridge is kinda nice.

**TheShineSoul** (8.5): I actually love this song, such a sweet and short ballad. She sounds great and the lyrics are sad and relatable.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): The calm vibe and sincerity sells me on this one.

**nahaalne** (8): Really cute but kinda generic tbh. Still love it.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8): Pensive bop

**ItsJustSketchyy** (7.5): I felt the instrumentals were slightly lacking. Just a little bit more behind her vocals would have been nice.

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Cute guitar ballad. The lyrics are the star here.

**jjs33072** (7.2): A calm, lowkey, chill song. Very nostalgic for me for some reason.

**eklxtreme** (7): pretty sweet song, but it sounds a lot like love yourself by justin

**ulikejazz** (7): i mean its there and its not BAD

**vayyiqra** (7): this is ok but needs a rhythm section

**JanuraryFourteenth** (6.5): This song sounds super familiar but I can‚Äôt quite place it, can y‚Äôall help?

**Banananaise** (6): ehhh i'm sick of this acoustic-plus-vocal-manipulation style

**CarlieScion** (6): is this thinking about you

**luigi\_is\_better** (6): it just sounds like a bad version of real friends

**PeachPlumParity** (6): It's slow but not in a good way like the trio later on, one of the weaker ones on the album imo.

**Me-Luigi** (5.8): kinda boOoroOoring

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): Vocals are not strong and this moves slower than a snail (plus in the outro she sounds like she's gonna sneeze)

**hikkaru** (5): This song is fine but it doesn't go anywhere at all

**MrSwearword** (5): I wonder how many times that pretty decent to good production were wasted using Camila's vocals on this album.

**PuggleMaster** (5): the harmonies at the bridge

**Shipsinker44** (6): I didnt have a comment for this song when i rated it and i dont really have one now except to say zara has a problem of either having too much happening in one song or not enough to make listening to her satisfying

---

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9): Look I know this stands for Too Good 4 Me, but what if it stood for Too Gorgeous 4 Me. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going with this. Also MORE TROPICAL POP

**twat\_brained** (7.8): That whole thing that Diplo started of musicians weirdly pitching their voices really gets on my nerves. The song would be much better for me if that wasn't there

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): This is the track I see people labelling as filler most of the time and, I must say, that's not an incorrect assumption. This is a decently crafted pop song when I listen to it but by the time I reach the second half of the album I can't remember it at all. Not very memorable.

**MissyBee37** (4): Holy, wow I'm promoting a *reputation* track? Who am I?? But seriously, this beat sounds just like "Delicate" but I like Taylor's version far better.

---

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): why did I think this would stand for "thank god 4 me"

**1998tweety** (7.8): Idk why but whenever I see this title I think it means Thank God For Me.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Thank God 4 Madonna

**PeachPlumParity** (10): This song is a bop

**TheShineSoul** (8): Such a great song, love the chill vibe

**vayyiqra** (8): okay I love this production, [sings] IDGAF

**eklxtreme** (7.5): it's basic but cute, that's Zara's music

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): A chill trop pop song. Its a lot of fun, and the hook is pretty sticky. Also: she goes for the Ariana-like head voice riffs at the end and I approve.

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): this album is so generic

**Me-Luigi** (5.7): one of the 'filler bops' on here, 1 point deducted because she didn't write it

**Glennishill** (4): I totally hate that pitched up vocal backing track. I thought dubstep trash went away like 5 years ago?

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (4): This is cute, but annoying

**frogaranaman** (3): Zara whenever she is presented with a song with above average production and songwriting.

**jjs33072** (2.6): Nothing here that I like or hate

**MrSwearword** (1): "OMG I'M LIKE SOOOOOOOOOOO HARDCORE BECAUSE I SMOKE AND DRINK LIKE A GANGSTER ASS BITCH WITH A GANGSTER ASS PUSSY" - this song and Zara's "aesthetic" without subtext.

**Shipsinker44** (7): My GOODNESS this is just so BASIC. Zara kills it sometimes with her production but a lot of the time we get throwaway tracks like this

**letsallpoo** (6): This is a pretty bizzare choice as an album lead. It's a pseudo-inspirational track that kinda serves second-half-of-the-album filler.

---




**MrSwearword** (10): credit where credit's due; it's a very good opener and the production compliments her limited studio vocals very nicely.

**frogaranaman** (4): Well, any expectations I had for this album just went out the window! Thanks for coming to my listening party.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I accidentally listened to this when I was rating Dua's album since I used the Spotify playlist, and I found myself actually really liking Zara's tone here-honestly, I'm not sure what the lyrics are about, but the way she sings them makes you think that you actually know her in real life and that she's your friend. It's a bit of a slow start to the album, but it's surprisingly good.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): I remember slagging this off upon first listen but revisiting it I realize the echoes are skinny and gorgeous to listen to

**CanadianSkeleton** (8): I honestly wasnt excepting this to be this good I was a bit biased against Zara

shipsinker44: **eklxtreme** (8.5): absolutely love her vocals on this


**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): A pleasant if forgettable opener

**PeachPlumParity** (8): This song bops but I don't know why it's so chill? I feel like it should be less chillpop and more of a bubble pop track.

**therandomsinger13** (8): Nice bridge

**vayyiqra** (8): nice opening as you may have noticed by now I love a good synth riff

**tapdancingpig** (7.8): Not particularly hooky, but Zara sounds great on it and its a lot of fun to bop to.

**1998tweety** (7.2): A decent opener but kind of forgettable.

**Glennishill** (7): Fine but repetitive.

**ItsJustSketchyy** (7): Pleasant chill bop.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs good

**static\_int\_husp** (7): generic

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This is the pop equivalent of a motivational poster

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (6.8): Delicate outsold

**Me-Luigi** (6.3): boring lyrics but interesting production from MNEK, 1 point deducted because she didn't write it

**TheShineSoul** (6): Kinda forgettable even when it's the opener of the album.

**jjs33072** (2.1): A poor opener, nothing really draws me in

**Shipsinker44** (7): ENDING THE DAY with Dua Lipa‚Äôs first song out in the whole rate! I dont really know what emotion im supposed to feel when i listen to this song but i dont care about it losing because while its a good song it doesnt do anything. Anyway, this closes off day ONE of the reveal. Lets hope Dua and Camila are able to put up a tough fight against powerhouses Bebe and Zara tomorrow!!!

**letsallpoo** (6): Definitely not my choice for the lowest Dua track, but this is certainly on the lower tier for her songs. The Eden metaphor is a bit heavy-handed, and it kills a lot of the momentum for the album.

---


**twat\_brained** (10): I like the biblical themes both here and in Genesis but here I definitely feel more convinced here because Dua is able to sell it more endearingly. Hopefully this is the best non-single of the rate.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): More biblical imagery here. It actually serves as quite the foil to Genesis, now that I think about it. It's the first straight-up ballad on this album, but that doesn't turn listeners off like it does with some other new and upcoming artists. Dua's vocals are gorgeous here and the imagery plays off.

**therandomsinger13** (9): Nice slow one so I can catch my breath from the last two. Duolingo is real speaking a language with these vocals.

**cyborglilith** (5.5): chanting is good for the soul

**AnimationJava** (6): Dua Lipa√≠s first stab at heartbreak, feeling sad and empty. Relatable. [a note from poo: who hurt you babe]

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7.5): Adam and Eve wishes

**wailordfan\_** (10): I feel like I'm one of the few who really LOVES this song.

**1998tweety** (8.6): A good ballad.

**TheShineSoul** (8.5): So underrated, such a great song.

**PeachPlumParity** (7.5): It's a good song but it's kind of .... boring at some parts and that makes it feel more repetitive than it should be.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Solid song but the vocals are nasal and the chorus is a little slow

**eklxtreme** (7): I love any song that shows off dua's voice but this one is also kinda boring

**Me-Luigi** (6.8): she has done better on this album, her voice doesn't really shine here

**jjs33072** (6.1): Love the continuation of the biblical imagery, but the production just doesn't do it for me here

**MrSwearword** (6): kind of a comedown especially from the last track that played. I mean it makes sense for Dua but like yeesh, album positioning issues...

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): And the filler begins

**vayyiqra** (6): eh this is so melodramatic and what's with all the Biblical metaphors anyway is she even religious probably not

**ImADudeDuh** (5): filler arrived

**tapdancingpig** (4): Eh. The first real ballad of the set kind of bores me. Also: I'm usually able to compartmentalize my technical vocal training when I listen to pop music, but her placement on her belts here...

**frogaranaman** (3): Im liking all this religious imagery because it reminds me to ignore the album.

**strawberryswing1** (2): how on earth did this make the cut

MissyBee37: Wowwwwwwww. If Day 1 is any indication, The Prophecy seems to be predicting Queen Dua. Damnnn. I can't believe she only lost one song!! I mean, I believe it because it's deserved. I definitely like her album far better than Zara's or either of Bebe's rate EPS, but wow. It's just surprising to see an artist go so untouched on Day 1! She almost kept her whole album!!
