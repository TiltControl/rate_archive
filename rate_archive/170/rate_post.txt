In 2020, Kehlani released their official sophomore album titled *It Was Good Until It Wasn't*, a darker, atmospheric project that describes some of the trials and tribulations in a relationship and the singer's personal life. Becoming their most commercially successful album to date, They wished to record a deluxe version of the album, but ultimately decided the extra songs that were recorded would be more fit for a completely new album. That decision eventually led to the creation of Kehlani's third studio album titled *Blue Water Road*. The album being predominantly produced by Pop Wansel, it turns out to be a generally lighter body of work - both sonically and lyrically - in comparison to its predecessor. Kehlani themself describes *blue water road* as "an emotional journey, a sexual journey, and a spiritual journey...like a glass house. It’s light, transparent, and the sun is shining right through it." The project starts off with the opener "little story" where Kehlani acknowledges the flaws they've shown in and a desire to continue  the relationship in hopes of no longer inflicting pain. Further down the album is the lead single *altar*,  an ode dedicated to the friends they have lost from passing away and have told the singer vulnerable and substantial lessons that have helped them throughout their life. Kehlani's described "melt" as their favorite song on the album, a passionate and endearing track to the singer's then lover and being in an all around more peaceful state of mind. The singer has described the passion that went into the song and *blue water road* verses how it felt righting such music in the past: "Once I unlocked the code that I wasn't loving from the place that I thought that I was when I was dating all genders and that I exclusively dating women and that just made everything so much deeper and more intense. It definitely reflects in the music because I'm listening back to the love songs and I'm saying some insanely, deeply romantic stuff". Whereas *IWGUIW* has Kehlani reflecting on some of the struggles they are undergoing from troubled relationships, *blue water road* has the singer finding peace and health with their current life.

# [Summer Walker - Still Over It](https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,q_90,w_1400/fl_lossy,pg_1/quxydhogqdyjlzzcx7fh/summer-walker-album-artwork)

Summer Walker has been garnering attention since 2019 with the release of "Girls Need Love (Remix)" as well as her debut album *Over It*. With the album backed up by famous R&B/Hip-Hop producer and Summer's then-boyfriend London On Da Track, *Over It* put the singer at the top of many people's radars, breaking R&B streaming records as well as winning Album Of The Year at the Soul Train Awards. In approximately 2021, Summer and London had a highly publicized break-up in the media, leading to controversy surrounding the child they recently had together, rumors of infidelity, arguments with the mothers of London's previous children, and far more. All this serves as inspiration for the making of Summer's aptly titled sophomore album *Still Over It*. The album is meant to be a story detailing the experiences Summer's had in the relationship with London, each song being aligned to a timeline from 2019 to 2021 as the album progresses. Take the opening track for instance titled "Bitter", where Summer addresses the threats and drama she's been involved in from the mothers of London's past children as well as how gossip sites have only propelled such drama ending with a note by Cardi B advising her to turn such controversy in her favor through the form of music. Later down the tracklist is the second single titled "No Love" where Summer describes that she wouldn't have let herself have emotional attachment in the relationship and simply have it exist for sexual gratification if she would do it all over again. Nearing the end of the album is the final song "4th Baby Mama" that has Summer putting London on full blast, addressing his lack of support during her pregnancy as well as addressing his lies for claiming to be in the studio. The album had massive commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 and becoming the first R&B album by a woman to do so in over 5 years. It also broke the at-the-time record for most streams in a single day by a female artist on Apple Music on its debut. All in all, the album left a lasting impression on several R&B lovers for being able to turn such negative emotions and events into one of Summer's greatest commercial highs.

# [Jazmine Sullivan - Heaux Tales](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/62053607aa22b64254b4686d/master/pass/Jazmine-Sullivan-Deluxe.jpeg)

Jazmine Sullivan does not really need an introduction when it comes to the modern R&B/Soul world. Making her mark as early as 2008 with arguably her most well-known single "Bust Your Windows", the singer has widely been praised as one of the best vocalists in the genre. With her last official studio album being the acclaimed *Reality Show*, she's been featured in projects of her other companions in the industry since then, ranging from working with Frank Ocean, Mary J. Blige, Bryson Tiller, and Pentatonix. However, it would take up to 6 more years for Jazmine to release her own material, that coming in the form of her 2021 [EP](https://twitter.com/jsullivanmusic/status/1347169173135388673?s=20) *Heaux Tales*. As described by Jazmine: "I wrote *Heaux Tales* to give voice to every woman... It's about ownership and confidence and also vulnerability and self-reflection... It's about women writing their own imperfect stories unashamed." Described as a concept album, *Heaux Tales* is as honest and raw as it can get, with nearly every song being supported by an interlude of one of the women involved in the project sharing a part of their story, regardless if it's viewed as a negative or positive part of their life. Its most notable track is the single "Pick Up Your Feelings" an empowered breakup anthem following the events of a lover cheating. The song won a Grammy for best R&B performance, marking Jazmine's first-ever Grammy win. Another noteworthy track is the final song on the standard edition and duet with H.E.R. titled "Girl Like Me", which expresses a mix of emotions - anger, frustration, pain - over a lover leaving them for someone that satisfies them more to their liking and wanting to change to not experience that same pain in the future. *Heaux Tales* became her highest charting project on the Billboard 200 and won many awards, such as a Grammy for Best R&B Album and Album Of The Year for both the Soul Train and BET awards. In addition, the project is featured on multiple year-end lists as one of the best albums of 2021 and has been described as Jazmine's best work to date, with publications such as Pitchfork, Vulture, NPR, and LA Times deeming it the Album of The Year. Thanks to passionate vocals and a versatile set of stories and relationships, Jazmine continues to make waves with the release of *Heaux Tales*.

# [Ari Lennox - age/sex/location](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7149VQZjrzL._UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg)

Courtney Salter initially caught the eye of rapper J. Cole when hearing some of the music the singer released independently. As a result, he signed her to his own record label Dreamville Records where she worked with a few other artists on the label, including J. Cole himself. It was there that she started to gain traction for some of her own music, more notably for the singles *Shea Butter Baby* and *BMO* from her debut album with the same name as the former single. It wasn't until the rollout of her sophomore effort titled however that she started to build up more traction on the charts. Throughout the record, Ari details the struggles of modern dating and likens them to the days when she first started dating. The singer has described the album as the following: "This is my *Eat, Pray, Love* journey. And it's my honest goodbye to searching for love. I got it right here inside of me. The end of searching for anything other than self love and family. Pouring into me and giving the greatest love to me." The opening track titled "POF" which portrays the feeling of remaining single and trying not to lower standards for the sake of simply having a partner. The album also spawns Ari's first solo single to chart on the Hot 100 titled "Pressure" which as been given a fair amount of acclaim, described by NPR as "a half-Motown, half-808s fantasia about being the center of attention during foreplay". While the album as a whole had the least commercial success out of all the projects on this rate, it was received rather well by music publications, some of which commended the choice of features of the record as well as Ari's ability to have a touch of old school, but still with a modern, fresh touch. If we look at the amount of attention Ari has received up to this point, one could argue this album is overlooked in the world of modern R&B. Even so, *age/sex/location* remains a noteworthy body of work with some of Ari's best career highs to date.
