**indie\_fan\_** (7): Lawd, finally this is out. This overstayed its welcome to me. First of all, [Mary J Blige offering herself as a guest feature for a (supposed) remix version of this song](https://twitter.com/maryjblige/status/1350223133538660354) then the remix never happening/releasing was my joker moment. Cause if that happened, I woulda very likely given that at least a 9. Someone else here pointed this out as well, but I always felt a bit uncomfortable with some of Anderson's lines, which in turn causes me to doc some points here.
 
---
 
**frogaranaman** (11): ‚Äúnow she wants to be a make-up artist??‚Äù LMFAOOOO
 
**lexiaredery** (11): a very good song
 
**apatel27** (10): Swear everything Anderson Paak touches turns to gold
 
**Awkward\_King** (10): ok jessie j more like jessie slay!!
 
**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Being a gold digger is valid actually.
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): jessie j sounds different here
 
**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): The groove and the vibe of this one is so dope honestly, Anderson does a dope job here too.
 
**seanderlust** (10): this is who i wanted to be in my early 20s but i had social anxiety
 
**soul-glitch** (10): Shit I‚Äôm starting to think you don‚Äôt even have a job ü§îü§îü§î
 
**Stryxen** (10): they're having a singing their heart out off
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): my favourite on the album, that chorus scratches a particular itch in my brain
 
**akanewasright** (9.4): ‚ÄúIf he want the pussy first he gotta CashApp me‚Äù and ‚Äúshit, I'm startin' to think you don't even have a job‚Äù are among my favorite lighthearted lines on the album
 
**Ambrosia42** (9.4): The Tale before this kinda spilled and sets the scene for this a bit. This song is such a jam and I appreciate the different perspectives and how it illustrates how sex and relationships can be a transaction of money and power even if being a heaux is not your official profession
 
**bespectacIed** (9): Fun, sounds 90s as hell. I'm cautiously giggling at anderson's verse
 
**bogo** (9): i really like how anderson .paak‚Äôs verse pairs with the rest of the song, it adds some conflict
 
**impla77** (9): For some reason, on Apple Music, it was saying I didn‚Äôt have permission to access this üò≠ Anyway, Anderson .Paak slayed, his verse is so funny
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (9): woah anderson good work
 
**CrimsonROSET** (8): for 25c a month you can keep a pussy moist somewhere in the world
 
**flava** (8): i get that a lot of this album is exploring ‚Äúmessiness‚Äù within relationships whether long or short term but do people like, like their spouse
 
**IIIHenryIII** (8): it sounds so fresh yet I could swear I've known this song my whole life
 
**noavocadoshere** (8): oh...it's anderson .paak. that's all i have to say about that. no surprise that jazmine did her thing here.
 
**ss2811** (8): love anderson on this its a different vibe to the rest of the album but i enjoyed it
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): anderson paak turns everything he touches to gold
 
**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I'm starting to think she's not just spending all this money on vaginal lubricant
 
**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): less voally impressive than the rest of the album but still cute.
 
**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): it ain‚Äôt about the MOney muh muh muh MONey muh muh muh MONey
 
**1998tweety** (7): ended jessie j
 
**bigbigbee** (7): Jessie J outsolHAHAHAHAH can you even imagine
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): Jazmine is so good that somehow the song with Anderson Paak is a low point in the album
 
**TiltControls** (7): I love paak, but this is the one song on the album I always kind of forget exists
 
**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): I love .Paak but this actually is one of the more middling songs on the album for me
 
**uiscebeathaoir** (6.7): I don‚Äôt feel this one as much as the rest of the album, but it‚Äôs still enjoyable. Anderson .Paak has a good verse
 
**Birdseeding** (6): First track that feels like it doesn't quite hold the same quality, but what an album start!
 
**Nagisoid** (6): I'm not the biggest fan of the chorus and the Anderson feature is nice but nothing special, the verses are cool though. Lyrics are weird but I can see what they are going for.
 
**ThickyIckyGyal** (6): it's pretty catchy but eh.
 
**Darkknuckles** (4): my least fav by far. Idk somethign about the chorus is annoying
 
**girlsuke** (1): this song is actually good but .Paak's verse seems colorist to me

**nt96** (11): story time! I used to work at a Dennys and one night it was a usual work shift until someone came in and a coworker noticed someone familiar, and so I checked for myself. It was Ginuwine!! Needless to say, I got a pic with him and I still have it. I also served T*kashi69 a few times but that‚Äôs a horror story for another day.
 
---
 
**akanewasright** (10): I looooove her phrasing on the prechoruses so much‚Ä¶ like that‚Äôs both fantastic songwriting and singing
 
**Awkward\_King** (10): https://domaingang.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/lady-gaga2-domaingang.jpg
 
**BeauMeringue212** (10): This is a really great opener for the album, I love the Erykah Badu influenced tone and rhythm of it
 
**bogo** (10): point of fiew
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): wasn‚Äôt this also the name of a crusty dating app? Lol
 
**JIRACHl** (10): my other 11 for the rate this is so good
 
**noavocadoshere** (10): idk how plenty of fish is doing dating app rank-wise, but big brain energy would've been using this song for a commercial. like, it's right there.
 
**seanderlust** (9.5): not ari calling out the hat trick :sob:
 
**Ambrosia42** (9.3): this is a vibe and the fish men are flopping
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (9.1): yup what's this "be sweet" line about?
 
**CrimsonROSET** (9): no coochie!
 
**Darkknuckles** (9): loved this song when i first heard the album
 
**Stryxen** (9): why did i not like this at first ?? so fun to sing along to and the instrumental is very very very cool
 
**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Not the coochie-less man üò≠üò≠
 
**welcome2thejam** (9): Misread the title and thought I was gonna get a song about computer documents
 
**flava** (8.5): kinda camp that Ari Lennox made a song to endorse the dating service that showed up in every main pop girl‚Äôs music video from 2010-2011
 
**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): point of fuck? oh, now I get it
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): you mean that application Meghan Thee Trainor used in her Dear Future Husband music video?
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): yeah you let his ass know
 
**soul-glitch** (8): So real
 
**Used-Rhubarb9105** (8): Love the beat also love how honest this song is especially for the modern woman/individual
 
**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): i know its a very very old expression but when i see ‚Äúplenty of fish in the sea‚Äù abbreviated like this i only think of that random-ass dating site that sponsored music videos 10 years ago
 
**ThickyIckyGyal** (7.5): i love the production and her flow over it too.
 
**bespectacIed** (7): These are bars
 
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): let ari say shit
 
**Nagisoid** (7): Cute song but I still think the title came from her misspelling POV and leaving that as the song's name
 
**ss2811** (7): nice start to the album
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): good opener and I like it but I don‚Äôt have anything deep to say about it
 
**RandomHypnotica** (6.3): there‚Äôs probably a rater reading this whose parents met on plentyoffish.com
 
**Olivier77777** (6): it‚Äôs ok
 
**Birdseeding** (5): Annoying retro production for a decent track
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): kept internally refering to this one as ‚Äúpiece of fuck‚Äù based on the title

**indie\_fan\_** (10): Man this was my 11 contender for a long while. It is just the epitome of loving and happiness and almost gives a floating type of feeling to me. One of my favorite Kehlani songs to date now.
 
---
 
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (11): god this song makes me cry - i hope someone loves me like this one day! these lyrics are just so earnest, and every single metaphor does a little funny thing to my heart. and i know we don't take visuals into account, but the music video for this was my fave thing in 2022 - it turns my face into the ü•∫ emote everytime i watch it. it's such a profound moment of queer joy for me (even though Kehlani and 070 have broken up), and i think i might have contributed like 100 views to that video idk‚Ä¶
 
**akanewasright** (10): This was an instant addition to my anxiety playlist. It‚Äôs just so soft and sweet and lovely. Possible 11 if it weren‚Äôt for Jazmine
 
**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Pooh ascend gif
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): i stop the world and melt with you!
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Kehlani‚Äôs vocals always flow like water and the way she just cascades around this song as she sings about melting into you‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs lyrical painting baby!
 
**girlsuke** (10): one of the best r&b love songs
 
**Nagisoid** (10): If the interlude for this song isn't I Melt with You I will be genuinely surprised
 
**Olivier77777** (10): best of the album would be 11 if On It and BPW didn‚Äôt exist
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): yeah this stretch is one of the most impressive in terms of recent releases
 
**sarcasticsobs** (10): lol I shouldn't be allowed to hear this right now. Literally a 10 because it's making me feel things (and the main one is jumping off a bridge!)
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (10): WHILE I HAVE A FEAR OF MELTING THIS SONG WARMS MY HEART AND HELPS ME OVERCOME THIS FEAR LIKE THIS IS JUST SUCH A SWEET ADULT CONTEMPORARY SONG IDK WHY KEHLANI MAKES ME SO HABBY BUT THEY DO!
 
**welcome2thejam** (10): If you catch me eyes closed, slowly phasing in and out of reality then don't disturb me, I'm just listening to melt, off of Kehlani's 2022 album blue water road
 
**seanderlust** (9.7): lovely
 
**cremeebrulee** (9.6): https://twitter.com/decomposespree/status/1520222352033820672
 
**uiscebeathaoir** (9.5): this actually sounds like it‚Äôs melting. But in a good way
 
**1998tweety** (9): ascending a bit
 
**CrimsonROSET** (9): I had a silly comment for this but I don‚Äôt know if this song is about losing your individuality with a relationship but that is the vibe I got with it, being afraid that you start losing yourself in your partner and together are seen more as ‚Äòa couple‚Äô than two individuals who are together and that‚Äôs such an interesting take in an album that is mainly about love but it also just comes out of nowhere and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just projecting or if that was the intention
 
**impla77** (8.8): had to listen to this a few times to really get the metaphor.. but yeah this is pretty good
 
**apatel27** (8.5): its cute. the strings are nice
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): her vocals are so good here
 
**Stryxen** (8.5): gorgeous chords, it really does sound quite liquid but like a thick viscous liquid. Don't ask me to elaborate
 
**TiltControls** (8.5): just gorgeous
 
**Ambrosia42** (8.2): lovely
 
**bespectacIed** (8): When the strings come on the song just elevates, that's a SZA 101 lesson
 
**noavocadoshere** (8): 100% understand why this is kehlani's favorite.
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): such a pretty song, Kehlani has a knack for pretty songs
 
**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This song makes me feel so cozy ü•∫
 
**Darkknuckles** (7): very chill bouncy melody.
 
**ThickyIckyGyal** (7): almost me when listening to this.
 
**IIIHenryIII** (6): now this is a good use of strings but the song is not helping
 
**ss2811** (6): its okay but i dont revisit it much
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): her ryo feat. hatsune miku slay
 
**Awkward\_King** (5.5): uhhhhhh uhhhh uhhhhhh uh ice be like fuck that wasnt very good

**indie\_fan\_** (10): This song was already great with the two of them together then the sax was just what this track needed. Still crazy that this was never made an official single; it did very well on the R&B charts and they even performed it together at the Soul Train Awards so I just assumed a video was coming at the very least
 
---
 
**bogo** (11): i heard a saxophone and my body started floating
 
**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Ari being on three of these albums‚Ä¶queen of the rate kinda.
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): scared that the Kevin Samuels mention has the white twentysomethings of popheads googling him and winding up on some Lipstick Alley threads slkdklslkd
 
**girlsuke** (10): Ari is just perfect
 
**Nagisoid** (10): The saxophone here???? I ascended omfg, and the beat is so good and when Ari comes in it's something else
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): the way I've only ever heard "disloyal" used as a word, queens of expanding my dictionary!
 
**soul-glitch** (10): I ain‚Äôt taking your shit todayyyyyyyy
 
**Stryxen** (10): GIRL‚Ä¶ the amazing. I'm gasping for air‚Ä¶.
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this goes SO HARD and I love how progressively throughout the album summer becomes more independent and confident in herself and telling him to fck off. Ari also delivers a fantastic verse
 
**welcome2thejam** (10): Oh wow, this really unfurls into a gorgeous song
 
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): coffee shop slayage??? this is so good, their voices go together perfectly. and when the sax hits‚Ä¶ woah.
 
**noavocadoshere** (9.5): you've got ari and summer, and somehow the saxophone managed to be the unexpected star. a team of all-stars here.
 
**seanderlust** (9.5): we get ari and summer AND a sax solo? we are truly blessed
 
**Used-Rhubarb9105** (9.2): Both their voices sound so good on this track, I love the jazzy vibes! Potential to be a classic song
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (9.1): OMG ARI LENNOX GET DA FUCK OVA HERE I LOVE YOUR WORK!
 
**1998tweety** (9): jazzy vibes ate
 
**ss2811** (9): they work so well together
 
**Ambrosia42** (8.6): ooh it even gets a lil jazzy
 
**flava** (8.5): when Ari Lennox comes in after the instrumental >>>
 
**ThickyIckyGyal** (8.5): the sax, u get me? and i just love the way ari came on it.
 
**bespectacIed** (8): My girl being in 3/4 of the albums in this rate yasss, kehlani you missed out... Love the sax, okay collab, ari's verse is the highlight
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Wow Ari Lennox really gets around‚Ä¶ your move Kehlani. The percussion really helps this one stand out.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): thank god for ari lennox
 
**uiscebeathaoir** (8): I can‚Äôt believe Ari Lennox isn‚Äôt my favourite part of the song. Sorry Ari - saxophone is new best friend now
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): the production is giving Sade or waiting in a fancy elevator
 
**Olivier77777** (7.6): funny I wrote sounds like an Ari Lennox song and yeah she‚Äôs on it
 
**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): Very smooth lounge music. With a sax solo. Yeah, I‚Äôm okay with this.
 
**Birdseeding** (7): The saxophone and Ari are the saviours here.
 
**CrimsonROSET** (7): checks notes no it seems like you‚Äôve been taking his shit for a while actually
 
**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I want to like this sax but it's kinda putting me to sleep
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): this vibe shift between the last song being about wanting to stick with someone no matter what going straight into a song about being done with a man‚Äôs shit, lmao
 
**IIIHenryIII** (5): thank you Ari for giving me hope. I‚Äôm looking forward to listening to you.
 
**Awkward\_King** (1.5): im so sorry I DONT KNOW WHY I LOVE ARI'S ALBUM SO MUCH AND HATE HER OTHER FEATURES HERE

**BeauMeringue212** (10): The beat, the Maxine Waters sample, a symphony about bad sex? Iconic. Was a close runner up for my 11
 
**bespectacIed** (10): Excellent "lead single" to the deluxe. Shame we are not rating Issa Rae's intro, that was a David Fincher-esque twist, I gasped!!!

**Ambrosia42** (9.1): The tale before LMAO. And then this song is unfortunately relatable
 
**CrimsonROSET** (9): monique heart reclaiming my time dot png
 
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): i was expecting a sad song with that title but I prefer what I actually got.. like damn she burnt that man thoroughly.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9): when she belts ‚Äúcoulda stayed my ass at HOME‚Äù I transcended
 
**IIIHenryIII** (9): for the other girlies

**1998tweety** (8): me when the enemy gets away with 2 hp

**indie\_fan\_** (10): And here‚Äôs to another artist being added to the earliest exit leaderboard hooray!!!! Yeah y‚Äôall really didn‚Äôt seem to agree as a whole what Summer‚Äôs best song was, partially considering how this almost crosses the average controversy score. That aside, lemme talk about the song itself. I still find it funny how so many people still be thinking london produced this album when summer legit says here ‚Äúyou claim you at work, but them other ü•∑s say they made the beats, so how that add up?‚Äù There‚Äôs not much else I can say here that the rest of the comments didn‚Äôt say, but everything about this song was so well done - that Profyle sample was PERFECT - and it‚Äôs without a doubt my favorite album closer in the rate.

**BeauMeringue212** (10): I remember just gasping when I heard this the first time, she came for his neck and then spun round to come back for his mom lmao. It's the perfect track to end on (before Clara's Prayer as more of an interlude), as just a stark and honest assessment of the shit he put her through
 
**bogo** (10): has anyone checked on london after this, like is he still alive cause i‚Äôm pretty sure summer straight up murdered him here

**impla77** (10): Now THIS is confessional
 
**JIRACHl** (10): ended that man with ease
 
**oscarbrierley1** (10): an assassination, she starts going in and doesn't stop for the full run time.
 
**seanderlust** (10): BRINGING HIS MOM'S PARENTING SKILLS INTO THIS
 
**soul-glitch** (10): Heartbreaking and real
 
**ss2811** (10): this one is so good she really came to end london on da track
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): DRAGGGGGG HIM like can you give a song that starts with ‚ÄúI wanna start with your mama she should‚Äôve whooped your ass‚Äù anything less than 10? I would like to shout out ‚ÄúHOW COULD U MAKE ME SPEND MY WHOLE FUCKING PREGNANCY ALONE.‚Äù I love this as a final say on the album. I feel like summer has been criticised in the past for being insecure and having low standards and this song does truly show growth in herself like good 4 u
 
**uiscebeathaoir** (10): I only ever listen to this in the context of the album, but that‚Äôs only because it works so well. It‚Äôs such a cathartic closer
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (10): pre-lude goated
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): wow this guy sounds like he he really sucks if i was summer i would‚Äôve made this track 20 minutes long dragging his ass
 
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.3): GET HIS ASS
 
**Ambrosia42** (9): Heavy on the CONFESSIONAL
 
**Darkknuckles** (9): she really eats the mom up on this and speaks her peace. I love that.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): she couldn‚Äôt get London on da track cause she murdered him
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): oh this was ANGRY and I liked it
 
**ReallyCreative** (9): this title is insane... and this man produced half the songs on this album I CANNOT
 
**Stryxen** (9): i love ciara‚Äôs prayer btw. I AM A QUEEN !
 
**welcome2thejam** (9): Incredible opening line, she takes her first shot with a rocket launcher
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Really like how the album opens with that voicemail from Cardi advising her to put her pain into her music, and then it comes full circle on this track. Sometimes I think that raw tracks with a ton of personal details are, well, uncomfortable, but I get where she‚Äôs coming from here. Now please go feed your baby something.
 
**CrimsonROSET** (8): why are you dating someone from hhh summer
 
**Nagisoid** (8): Great chipmunk soul sample and lyrics, really like the outro a lot as well.
 
**Used-Rhubarb9105** (8): A great diss track
 
**Birdseeding** (7): However outdated the production style, at least this has some sort of direction. There's power in the lyrics for once, but why can't Summer put that in her voice, too?
 
**ThickyIckyGyal** (6.5): damn.
 
**noavocadoshere** (6): "telling people that i'm your queen, but all you mean, is just of R&B." gotta say, i do love a humble brag in the middle of calling someone out. this probably would've had more of an emotional impact like, a few tracks ago. goodness gracious, give us some slack and cut some tracks.
 
**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.5): Somehow the Prelude version is much better than this
 
**Olivier77777** (5.2): album could‚Äôve ended at Closure‚Ä¶too much mediocrity at the end
 
**IIIHenryIII** (4): I like the piano though

indie_fan_: # Still Over It

indie\_fan\_: Popheads and tanking the most commercially successful album in the rate, what else is new? Look let's be real for a sec, who expected the most laid-back type of album in the rate that focuses more on the songwriting than anything else to do all that well on a subreddit called r/popheads? Summer's style of R&B is not particularly the type of R&B this subreddit chases after and if you ask me, idt any of her other projects woulda done much better here. Still, part of me is a bit bummed about how this album performed in this rate. The general consensus seemed to be that it was too long which definitely makes sense as it's the only hour+ long album in the rate. For me, this album is the pure definition of "you had to be there to enjoy it the most". i mean, the ig lives, the gossip pages, the highly publicized split between Summer and London, pretty much everything that inspired the making of this album is something you kinda had to witness it to really get into this project IMO. It was quite a lot and this album essentially summarizes all that as best it can and considering its length, i feel it does a damn good job. If it‚Äôs one thing Summer shines in it‚Äôs songwriting which I think really shines through in the best moments of this album.
 
nt96: Summer is literally around the corner and what do we do? Tank the one person named after the damn season! I don‚Äôt think she had a chance against these girls. Overall, I feel the greatest weakness this album had was its consistent laidback vibe especially towards the middle which may have bogged down the album a little. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs a good album and Summer put up a good fight.

**Key\_Establishment\_42** (9.767): This album made me a fan the 1st time I heard it. One of the best R&B albums to come out in 2021.
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (9.222): this is one of my favourite releases this decade and I‚Äôve just liked it more and more with time. Summer definitely shows growth from both a musical and personal perspective on her past records and there‚Äôs some great (funny) drags in here. I also enjoy that the tracklisting tells a narrative story.
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.667): introspective indie pop
 
**sarcasticsobs** (8.428): I don't know if I just wasn't fully paying attention to Summer the first couple of times I heard her, but I really, really loved her vocal timbre here
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (8.311): no u!
 
**BeauMeringue212** (7.761): Summer is messy as hell, but damn if she didn't make a great album out of the mess. The track order really makes it feel like a timeline of the relationship and eventual breakdown, her debut is a classic but I think she one upped it with this album
 
**jaztinax** (7.733): summer‚Äôs voice is so pretty that if it was a person, it‚Äôd have pretty privilege. which is why it was kind of hard to score these songs bc even though the mid ones sounded so good bc of her voice. her melodies compliment her so well too. definitely an album i will be revisiting more!
 
**impla77** (7.733): This album has a few too many songs but is still generally good
 
**uiscebeathaoir** (7.689): Unlike the other albums in the rate, this is best listened to as an album. Some tracks definitely work better as album tracks rather than individual songs and the whole thing is more than the sum of its parts. That being said, the parts are pretty fucking good
 
**cremeebrulee** (7.672): https://twitter.com/UncleRichardJr_/status/1432409120708067331
 
**welcome2thejam** (7.611): The sparser tracks had a bit of an uphill battle, but overall I think it's super effective in being the bitter breakup album. Summer had a clear tone of worn down and fed up that shone through and gave it emotional weight
 
**oscarbrierley1** (7.556): Lyrically scathing, tells a realy clear story. has some really high points, but probably could be four or five songs shorter. will be ignoring her problematic covid opinions for the rate.
 
**thedoctordances1940** (7.411): There are definitely some really good songs here but there's also some clear filler and when the album is already so long it does take away a bit from the overall experience but the low points are still generally alright. But yeah as a whole I do like this album enough, though it's probably my least favourite in the rate.
 
**ReallyCreative** (7.222): I don't know about this one. It's pleasantly produced, has some good beats, but Summer really struggles to set herself apart from the rest of the pack. While the drama surrounding this album is enticing, I just don't think the music itself has much of a punch
 
**Used-Rhubarb9105** (7.222): The storytelling on this album always get to me. I think Summer really spoke to her experience whether right or wrong in an authentic way
 
**TiltControls** (7.083): Think it maybe could've been cut down a bit, but it's a solid album for the most part
[/r/popheads/comments/12wksmu/confessional_rb_rate_reveal_day_3_hurry_and_pick/jhfo9th/]

=====

indie_fan_: **Ghost-Quartet** (6.833): Summer has been on my radar for a while (she‚Äôs one of the biggest names in r&b after all) but every time I‚Äôve tried to listen to one of her releases I‚Äôve kinda gotten bored. So with that in mind, I liked this a lot more than I thought I would!
 
**DirtyRat583** (6.806): worlds first neverending album
 
**bespectacIed** (6.750): Ok, I just gotta say it, I am not the biggest fan of Summer. Here's the thing, she is a good artist, she makes songs for idle listening, she targets feelings and vibes ... but her songwriting is often toooo prosaic and dry to me... I can't latch into her songs too much... No I am not explicitly making a SZA comparison but yall get the gist! Perhaps her type of confessional songwriting is what makes her appealing and popular but yeah her music still hasn't caught on me fully yet... ((I did all that typing instead of just saying I find her mid))
 
**Verboten\_Prince** (6.611): This album isn't bad and Summer has a beautiful voice, but it kinda sits in that easy listening vibe for so much of it, if you're someone like me who prefers music a bit more hard-hitting, then this album is a slog to get through
 
**OliviaGodrigo** (6.389): her debut album is so much better
 
**flava** (6.111): I‚Äôm torn on this album, I mean telling by my assumed lower average it is clearly the album I think is the weakest here, but it‚Äôs probably the album I‚Äôd want to come back the most out of these four which is kinda weird.But this album is a fascinating disaster, overlong and boring at spots sure, but pretty fucking juicy at others, and probably has the best moment in the rate with 4th Baby Mama. But I want to hear Summer explore and diversify as an artist more because I think she might have something special within her, even if this wasn‚Äôt it.. But this ultimately is a messy break-up album that captures passion, jealousy and a very unhidden insecurity from Summer which feels relatable as much as she doesn‚Äôt want it to be, I do wish the emotional logic felt more robust, and she explored more of why she stayed with him after he cheated on her like 4 times (that she knows about). it‚Äôs still memorable
 
**Nagisoid** (5.889): I get that this is supposed to be a loosely story-based album that's like a sequel to her first album, but given that I've never heard it, I'm probably missing out on some context. I am aware that this is about her less than amicable breakup with London the producer, but everything else seems muddy. Anyways, I sadly have to say this was my least favorite project in the rate, and it was not even really close. It's too long and too many songs feel undercooked. Not only that but I find it really hard to tolerate the prevalent hate in a lot of these songs, like I get their point but it still makes me uncomfortable. There are great songs I will definitely revisit later and others I hope to never hear again in my life. A very mixed bag, for sure.
 
**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.889): I was very tired and sleepy whilst listening to the album for the rate, and can I just say - this album works great as a sedative. No offence.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (5.750): this album was very boring overall, sorry
 
**Birdseeding** (5.111): 5 Just an all round weak experience, sadly. The singer is mediocre, supported by excessive autotune that's neither musically beneficial nor interesting. The production is soporific and outdated. The melodies and lyrics trope-filled repetitive clich√©. I do understand London on da Track is a major asshole, but his touch is desperately missing here.
 
**IIIHenryIII** (4.222): why is this so long? Sorry to whoever likes this, but this ain‚Äôt it. Listening to it felt more like a task than any other bad albums I‚Äôve dealt with doing rates.

babadork: My theory as someone who gave it a mid score is that London is such a 0 that he drags the album down from it being about him. I didn't follow any of the gossip when it was happening, but I now hate him from listening to the album a ton of times.

i appreciate your analysis and i totally agree! i didn't expect this to perform great on this sub bc the album is quite down tempo so with that in mind i'm glad it got an average over 7 but still..... the fact ex for a reason was one of the higher rated songs shows this sub will always gravitate towards bops haha

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): the lyrics really tug at my heartstrings - the desperation was delivered with Jazmine's vocals too.
 
**girlsuke** (10): this hits hard.
 
**IIIHenryIII** (10): I‚Ä¶
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): sighs, I should call him (i don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúhim‚Äù to call)
 
**jackisboredtoday** (10): call it the lost 11 because i was SO close to 11‚Äôing this, it‚Äôs just pitch-perfect and heartbreaking with one of the best vocal performances of the decade so far
 
**RandomHypnotica** (10): :floating:
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): any track that just let's Jazmine do her thing is always a winner
 
**sarcasticsobs** (10): :(
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this song combined with the tale right before it is the most soul crushing moment in this rate
 
**thedoctordances1940** (10): Just incredible, the dreamy production is incredible and god her voice is just stunning. Feel like this one will be a bit robbed for some reason though
 
**uiscebeathaoir** (10): the reverb is a literal tear jerker
 
**welcome2thejam** (10): Frank Ocean ass instrumental (complimentary)
 
**BeauMeringue212** (9.8): whew
 
**Used-Rhubarb9105** (9.7): Excellent vocals and song writing here
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (9.5): slow bliss esp live
 
**bespectacIed** (9): Real and raw but the songs the critics hype in this album are my bottom tier songs lol, a testament to how good this project is
 
**CrimsonROSET** (9): you might win some :pensive:
 
**soul-glitch** (9): Yeah I‚Äôve cried to this
 
**impla77** (8.3): Don‚Äôt really love the chorus, but I love the repeating riff in the background
 
**Birdseeding** (8): This just builds and builds. So fascinating
 
**Darkknuckles** (8): a sad song but i cant listen to it too much without being sad.
 
**Nagisoid** (8): Lyrics are amazing and her voice really stands out here but the extremely stripped back instrumental loses me.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I know this is a favorite but it‚Äôs just a bit too bare bones for me even with her amazing vocals
 
**Stryxen** (7.8): pretty but never been my fav :?
 
**noavocadoshere** (7.5): this is the weirdest thing, but jazmine's voice is so good that it actually brings the song down??? like it's gorgeous but feels v. clinical over the raw emotion and vulnerability that a song like this usually has.
 
**ss2811** (7): this one is so deep lowkey
 
**ThickyIckyGyal** (7): i really love the instrumental/production.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6): In order to prove her versatility she had to prove she could be mid too
 
**Awkward\_King** (5): i prefer jazmine when she's more r&b/neo soul than straight up ballads, i think a lot of the time my favourite part is how she sounds against the music so the stripped back tracks just kinda... miss for me! as objectively mobing as they are i've never found myself wanting to listen to this
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): this song has never clicked and t do anything for me and is sandwiched between two amazing songs which makes it worse
 
**flava** (2): I guess when the album is mostly built upon short stories that aren‚Äôt really interconnected, it doesn‚Äôt help build this up (nor further explore it) when the only thing towards building it is a spoken-word interlude, but that doesn‚Äôt feel like enough to make the patheticness of this song work, because there isn‚Äôt really any exploration of why she cheated

**indie\_fan\_** (10): so there seemed to be some discussion about how this wouldn't do too well from being an acoustic guitar based song ~~as well as the blatant misogynoir that comes out the sub every time H.E.R. is mentioned~~. But as y'all can see with where this placed that was not too much an issue lmao. I always loved this song [and then i heard this interpretation of it and its potential connection to the first bodies as a loop of sorts](https://youtu.be/kNPF4wrnjIo?t=906) and it gave me an even bigger appreciation for the track.
 
---
 
**bespectacIed** (11): Already have my clown makeup and heavy artillery ready. This is gonna be disrespected, isn't it... But i really dgaf, this is my absolute favorite song on my 2021 AOTY.... Yeah this is the ultimate pick-me anthem, but I SEE THE VISION, yall just don't get it. First of all, great H.E.R. feature, she sounds immaculate. More importantly, Jazmine putting a cynical view of heaux culture at the end of the very album that rationalizes it, is so fucking bold and deliberate and lowkey genius. This is aCkShuAlLy not an anti-hoe anthem, this is a thinly-veiled, ironic critique of how women can't win in a misogynistic society that boxes women into hoe or saint and pits them for men's ever-changing attention... But also it's a lament on how women are forced to conform and often flip-flop between both archetypes because it's either that or be lonely in a cruel, superficial world... No I am definitely not wearing a tinfoil hat typing this! I just love this song so much, thee perfect little R&B song.
 
**thedoctordances1940** (11): I'm not entirely sure what it is about this but this song has always just been really special to me and my favourite on the album. The guitar is gorgeous, it has some of Jazmine's best vocal delivery on the album and it just has a really bittersweet vibe to it that I absolutely adore
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): ‚ÄúI made a profile on Tinder‚Äù, babe you already lost </3
 
**Darkknuckles** (10): This song grew on me, especially after reading the lyrics. Tho there is some pick me energy ngl.
 
**frogaranaman** (10): why do people hate H.E.R. I don‚Äôt get it
 
**girlsuke** (10): a collab i never knew i needed.
 
**IIIHenryIII** (10): well, I did, I finally listened to a H.E.R. song
 
**ThickyIckyGyal** (10): love the production and the collab was perfect. and again the runs and harmonization!! amazing!
 
**Ambrosia42** (9.8): this song is so real omfg and their voices are insanely good
 
**sarcasticsobs** (9.8): :( mood. Bridge vocals insane
 
**ReallyCreative** (9.5): so many good duets in this rate
 
**cremeebrulee** (9): misandry definition video walked so this could run
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): best HER song
 
**oscarbrierley1** (9): popheads favourite h.e.r. can't wait for it to be tanked.
 
**ss2811** (9): this one is amazing and on repeat
 
**Stryxen** (9): this animal crossing 5pm guitar
 
**TiltControls** (9): I don't replay it as much as the other album tracks, but it's a really great vibe
 
**CrimsonROSET** (8): actually throwback to my therapist telling me to catfish people on tinder
 
**Nagisoid** (8): H.E.R.'s voice is beautiful but I don't like the muffled vocals that come in during the beat and some layers of the mix could have been done without.
 
**welcome2thejam** (8): Really good pairing
 
**noavocadoshere** (7): H.E.R sounds so out of place here, lol. anyway. once again, the singing is great, the singing is SINGING, but i need the rawness, vulnerability, like give me a few raspy voice cracks.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): These two are so talented. I wish this song was more interesting.
 
**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): Would‚Äôve probably given this an extra half point if there were some actual drums (i still like the song tho)
 
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): jazmine is sistar and h.e.r is aoa
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): love the lyrical content and vocals, production and melody leaves a little something to be desired for me
 
**Awkward\_King** (3): i feel bad tanking this bc the popheads whites are going to be horrible to HER as is but this has really never done anything for me, jazmine's vocals are amazing but you can say that abt every song in her discog

**indie\_fan\_** (10): I mean pretty much everything about this song has already been said at this point. Being honest for a moment, I really did not like this song the first few times I heard and tbh I can‚Äôt remember why or how. Cause hearing this now it‚Äôs really one of her best songs. Perfect single choice, not to mention the video itself is a nice tribute to past soul icons before her.
 
**nt96** (10): This song was one of few songs in this rate that had that rate winner energy, so seeing this miss the top 5 hurts.
 
---
 
**babadork** (11): Pretty much every time I opened the playlist for this rate I ended up listening to Pressure at least once
 
**akanewasright** (10): THEE serve. I‚Äôd heard and liked a few songs from Ari before, but this one‚Ä¶ This is the full package. Visuals, music, vocals‚Ä¶ Everything came together. Basically a perfect song, and one I could easily 11 if it wasn‚Äôt against Jazmine
 
**Ambrosia42** (10): i mean it‚Äôs a hit
 
**Awkward\_King** (10): honestly everyone remembers where they were when this song came out.. when it went number one,. when it won every grammy.... when it won every oscar..,. a moment
 
**bespectacIed** (10): 11 contender. It hurts to only give this a 10, I was obsessed with this song for such a long time, the repeated ^pressure gets me every time. She looks so scrumptious in the mv, love the Donna/Diana/DC homages, reminded me of Keri Hilson - Pretty Girl Rock haha. I can't gush over this song enough it's so irresistibly sweet and sickening
 
**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I love it when artists incorporate ‚Äúbop it‚Äù style language into songs about sex. It gives me very funny mental images.
 
**bogo** (10): that "PRESSURE!" hook is so addictive
 
**CrimsonROSET** (10): you better not be pokemon ability that causes you to use 2pp instead of 1 when you get there
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): when this wins the rate, or AS7, or Veteredemption‚Äôs Day in 2028 omgggg
 
**Darkknuckles** (10): this got me into aris music
 
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): god this is so fabulous!! i also want to steal all of her dresses in this vid.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): my ex-boyfriend would really understand this one ;))))))))))))))
 
**girlsuke** (10): this song slapps and was in my feels when i heard the JD producer tag at the beginning, felt so nostalgic
 
**JIRACHl** (10): should've gone mainstream the gp would ate it up üòû
 
**soul-glitch** (10): The music video is so aesthetic btw
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): easily my most listened on this album, it‚Äôs so catchy and groovy ugh strong 11 contender
 
**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): this should have been a bigger hit!
 
**seanderlust** (9.5): Paramore outsold but this is also very good
 
**plastichaxan** (9): I usually don‚Äôt like when song have like words/sentences repeating over and over in the background but I‚Äôll overlook it here cause it bops
 
**ss2811** (9): this song is effortlessly so fun
 
**ThickyIckyGyal** (9): probably have heard this song way too many times. i'm almost tired of it lol but love the oldie vibes so so much.
 
**TiltControls** (9): this track is so much fun to listen to
 
**Used-Rhubarb9105** (8.6): Love the mordernisation of an older sound
 
**Olivier77777** (8.5): I like this retro vibe
 
**Stryxen** (8.5): one of the best hooks but i don‚Äôt think this is quite as amazing as i have hyped it up to be on revisit
 
**Nagisoid** (8): Would be so much better if it wasn't as repetitive, especially that hit hat gets tiring quick
 
**noavocadoshere** (8): it's a fun, solid three minute track.
 
**welcome2thejam** (8): The combo of warm and relaxing and extra raunchy got me in a tailspin
 
**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): so catchy
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (7.5): the cut sounds too clean and precise to warrant the crackle that keeps popping up. it's a fun effect but the cut needed something else...a dubby kick drum or big 'ol horn perhaps instead of this thing that highlights the fragility. look, if i want crackle I'll just buy a vinyl for like $60 on discogs or put on some burial. the digital recordings is incomplete with surface noise
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): this song kinda shrunk over time
 
**Birdseeding** (6): there's such a thing as too carnivalesque
 
**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Do I get what they're going for with the production? Absolutely. But in practice I feel like that build-up is blue-balling me every ten seconds

It wasn‚Äôt that close for a couple ballots (20+ points apart iirc) But it got VERY close with the last few ballots. Just to show that every single ballot matters! Also ‚ÄúNo dick making me stupid‚Äù is one of the best opening lines on the album.
 
**nt96** (10): last Ari song out and narrowly missing top 5?? Some of y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt going to jail, y‚Äôall are going to PRISON. Maximum security, ALCATRAZ, RIKERS üëè ISLAND üëè. Pls DM me your addresses so I may send FBI agents to conduct a federal investigation on your taste, thx ‚ù§Ô∏è

**plastichaxan** (11): You did not waste my time Ari I will defend you by myself if I have to
 
**sarcasticsobs** (11): Oh my GOD the beat change into the chorus. Then the chorus itself? Magnifique
 
**bespectacIed** (10): BOPPPPPP. Very 2004-2006 slutpop. No dick making me stupid...I'm wide open, sesame... she's just like me
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SqUhkC7xyRc
 
**girlsuke** (10): she really is one of the best vocalist of her generation. This song is actually my 11
 
**oscarbrierley1** (10): yass motown banger. wish it would waste my time a little more and have a bridge.
 
**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Yeah this one is sick. I love this one so much. I was gonna ask why this one is so good and it turns out MNEK co-wrote it so you know it's gonna be good.
 
**Stryxen** (10): this gets the ‚Äúi wagged my finger along‚Äù seal of approval
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): high re-listen factor. Also NO DICK MAKING ME STUPID
 
**welcome2thejam** (10): Fun as hell, also "sock it to me" is such an inherently fun phrase I'm up for adding it anywhere
 
**Ambrosia42** (9.5): sexy, fun bop
 
**Awkward\_King** (9.5): if i had sex everytime i had time to waste i wo
 
**uiscebeathaoir** (9.5): it must be really fun to hate this song with its title

**ss2811** (9): love this one such a strong single choice
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (8.9): she's so ruthless for dis; im so glad she's saying no to da boyz
 
**noavocadoshere** (8.5): no sample of missy's sock it to me here, nothing, nada. of course, there wouldn't be but it'd be nice to dream y'know?
 
**cremeebrulee** (8.4): oh i can blame my stupidity on that? bet
 
**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Good song but more importantly I just discovered that on Genius I can just click the next song on the tracklist instead of Googling ‚Äú(Ari Lennox song title) lyrics‚Äù every time. Love that for me.
 
**Nagisoid** (8): The rough production here is definitely wasting my time, but the song itself isn't
 
**ThickyIckyGyal** (8): love the production, lyrics and the background vocals. so good and a vibe.
 
**Darkknuckles** (7): never fully connected but shes a bop
 
**IIIHenryIII** (7): I‚Äôm just grateful you‚Äôre not wasting mine

indie\_fan\_: I loved this album the first time i heard it and it probably woulda been my second favorite out of the 4 if i was rating on first listen. But I do have to admit it‚Äôs grown off me a bit. Some of the bonus tracks I feel coulda been kept on the album over others. Even so, it‚Äôs still a very well done album and shows ari at some of her biggest strengths as both a singer and songwriter. The old soul styles of music she incorporates here and modifies with a modern touch really make this project shine. For being the least popular artist out of the 4, I do like that she still did well for herself.
 
nt96: By far, my favorite album in this rate and a phenomenal, heavily underrated album. Ms. Lennox understood the assignment to a T and we thank her for it. A perfect melange of new-school/old school r&b, soul and some quiet storm thrown in there for good measure.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.100): great great great album, a lot of humor and heart
 
**oscarbrierley1** (9.033): she slayed every song. the only downside is a lack of bridges and overall slightly short songs. love away message as a concept, like a pre deluxe to get fans excited for the full album.
 
**uiscebeathaoir** (8.833): From the moment I first heard it, i was an Ari Lennox stan. It has bangers, bops, jams, top tier vocal performances, saxophone, killer beats, great songwriting - and not a single skip (except for Away Message, which definitely brought my average down)
 
**BeauMeringue212** (8.487): a lot of albums are overly long these days, but a/s/l is like the perfect length and really stays on message I think. It really does feel like a very millennial pov on modern dating, with a good mix of positive upbeat sexy bops with the frustrated "men ain't shit" tracks lol
 
**sarcasticsobs** (8.200): Been putting this off for so long and for no reasons other than having poor memory and it getting lost in my 259 "to-listen to" playlists. Glad the rate got me off my butt to listen
 
**welcome2thejam** (8.200): A warm, comfortable album overall. Nothing crazy, just quality stuff that ups the mood
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (8.013): why do you want my asl is this AIM?! am i playing that 3d tank war game?!
 
**bespectacIed** (7.867): An easy listen. Ari really embraced contemporary RnB in this one, to a fault almost, cuz some songs kinda blur together haha
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.767): She‚Äôs the least famous in the rate but I hope she just gets bigger and bigger because she‚Äôs bringing what she needs to the table.
 
**DirtyRat583** (7.593): you set her up putting the album after jazmine because this album is BEAUTIFUL but it doesnt hit the same :((
 
**TiltControls** (7.567): 31/unknown/dreamland
 
**Nagisoid** (7.533): Ari has my favorite voice out of everyone in this rate, it's really pleasing and comfy. This album is pretty consistent as well except for bonus tracks and Hoodie, maybe? Either way I'd say it's largely skipless. This album is pretty soulful and always cheers me up a bit, so that's a plus as well. My second favorite from this rate, I'd say
 
**thedoctordances1940** (7.380): was really hoping I'd like this more than I did like it is good, I was just expecting a little bit more tbh
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.300): this has some really fantastic highs, and some pretty forgettable lows. Key word there is forgettable and not bad. That being said, there‚Äôs only a few duds for me hence the average over 7.
 
**jackisboredtoday** (6.880): This album is nice but I will be much more of an Ari stan if/when we do the prequel rate with Shea Butter Baby
 
**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.800): There's a couple of tracks I really like here (especially Waste My Time and Mean Mug) but there's also a few tracks here that don't leave much of an impact on me. Still a pretty good album.
 
**Key\_Establishment\_42** (6.753): The songs came off very shallow compared to "Shea Butter Baby" and "PHO Ep"
 
**Birdseeding** (6.267): 7 I'm a huge fan of Christmas albums and listen to every new one obsessively. I should love this album because it truly feels like a Christmas record: a little too twee, musical theatre influences, a little jazzy. But the overstretched vocals don't hold together as well as they should, and what could be cosy comes across as silly on what's otherwise a fun production.
 
**flava** (6.100): so my introduction to Ari Lennox was her guest feature from the JID album last year where she was given very little to do except sound nice but ultimately given nothing else to do besides that. So I‚Äôm glad to hear on her own music she does occasionally do exciting things
 
**jaztinax** (6.053): confessional r&b but the only confession she has is how horny she is and she‚Äôs so real for that
 
**IIIHenryIII** (5.567): I wasn‚Äôt expecting much from this after listening to Heaux Tales, but I‚Äôm impressed at how it was able to not keep me so bored. I‚Äôll be paying attention to Ari from now on. It looks like she has potential.

**nt96** (10): one of my top contenders. I love the sample and how slightly eerie it sounds, honing it‚Äôs regrettable theme quite well
 
---
 
**Verboten\_Prince** (11): My favorite song in this rate by FAR omg. As someone who generally prefers more upbeat songs to more chill songs, this stood out to me instantly. It makes me feel like a bad bitch
 
**akanewasright** (10): for the first few times I heard this song, I mostly thought of it as a transition song to get into up at night‚Ä¶ but now I realize it‚Äôs just a stone cold banger
 
**Awkward\_King** (10): she's so mother literally. i bet her childs first word wasnt even mommy or mama it was just mother
 
**BeauMeringue212** (10): catchiest track on the album, beat is ridiculous
 
**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Me after I impulse buy a pack of Zebra Cakes at the grocery store and proceed to only consume garbage for a full two weeks.
 
**CrimsonROSET** (10): bedrock
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): finally this album wakes the fuck up!!!!!!
 
**Olivier77777** (10): love this track
 
**oscarbrierley1** (10): the only song on the album that i listen to regularly.
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): me regarding grad school
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): SO FUN
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (10): THIS SHIT IS SO BOUNCY IM LIKE A BALL
 
**Ambrosia42** (9.6): The sample hits and it‚Äôs a jam
 
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): the beat is so good and Kehlani sounds amazing here
 
**impla77** (9.5): love the transition from verse to chorus
 
**1998tweety** (9): the bop has arrived
 
**Darkknuckles** (9): What a bop, its just an easy listen and gets you to groove.
 
**jaztinax** (9): sample!!! flow!!! bop!!!
 
**ss2811** (9): this hits so hard
 
**Used-Rhubarb9105** (9): So much replay value
 
**welcome2thejam** (9): Killer beat, fantastic transition into the next track too
 
**sarcasticsobs** (8.9): Boppin' my head. Like the reflection in the lyrics
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): ngl I much prefer kehlani‚Äôs more upbeat songs idk if that‚Äôs an unpopular opinion. She just carries a faster beat so well.
 
**IIIHenryIII** (8): these drums slap
 
**plastichaxan** (7.8): Gagged me a bit at the beginning ngl
 
**bespectacIed** (7): bop
 
**Nagisoid** (7): "Don't want no Rest Stop" didn't raters get rid of that quickly in 2018 Indie Pop?
 
**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): it has some really nice little atmospheric things but idk it just doesn't really do much for me
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This is a promising track but the way it fades out at the end makes it feel a bit like an intro to ‚Äúup at night‚Äù
 
**noavocadoshere** (4.5): how is this a snoozzzefest? how? my score is for the slick rick sample that's distinctive enough, but still fresh here.
 
**ThickyIckyGyal** (4): wish i never either lol but fr the beat is ok but eh.

**indie\_fan\_** (10): The only song on the project where Jazmine sings about her own experiences and man it is absolutely one of my favorites on here. I‚Äôm glad it performed the best out of all the deluxe tracks as it really is a powerful track and one of her most personal songs. [Fun fact that this song was almost given to Jojo](https://youtu.be/DNjRiVaofvI), which as much as I love Jojo I‚Äôm so glad Jazmine kept this.
 
---
 
**oscarbrierley1** (11): vocals for days, bridge gave what needed to be gave, old style r&b at its best.
 
**bespectacIed** (10): MY FAVE ON THE DELUXE. Jazzy's Tale is a required listening, the rawest interlude in the entire project. I am a sucker for vocal gymnastics and Jazmine is the go to girl for this. The runs, the harmonies, the power, this is REAL MUSIC good lord
 
**bogo** (10): hey why the FUCK is this only a bonus track it‚Äôs soooo good
 
**CrimsonROSET** (10): fuck men!
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): ‚Äúi know you‚Äôre no good but I just keep hanging on‚Äù - me doing rates
 
**Darkknuckles** (10): what a mature topic and i sadly relate so hard.
 
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): If I delve into this too much we'd be here all day, so I'll just say that I relate to this a little too much for my liking and I hate that.
 
**girlsuke** (10): the vocals!!!
 
**IIIHenryIII** (10): I've never been through what she's singing, but somehow her delivery makes me relate to it? What?
 
**impla77** (10): Woody to Young Xehanort: ‚Äòyou don't know nothin' 'bout love‚Äô
 
**JIRACHl** (10): listening to this was a motherly experience
 
**Nagisoid** (10): So powerful. You can just feel the passion in her vocals. Relatable lyrics as well.
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): VOCALSSSSSSSSSS
 
**akanewasright** (9.5): the tale right before this üò¢ also this is one of her best vocal performances on an album full of vocals most people would kill for
 
**ThickyIckyGyal** (9.5): really had me feeling this in my soul as if i've ever been in this situation lol.
 
**1998tweety** (9): ascending
 
**Birdseeding** (9): She is a master of so many different styles and switches between them effortlessly
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): why was this just a deluxe!
 
**jaztinax** (9): i hope my ex‚Äôs ex feels this way because i just want the satisfaction about being right
 
**Ambrosia42** (8.5): the tale beforehand is so real, and then her voice sounds incredible here like all of her songs
 
**TiltControls** (8.5): me looping my 11 almost 200 times
 
**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): This one is really good, love the groove on this one. So dope.
 
**ss2811** (8): top tier
 
**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Wow she's really feeling her inner Aretha! I mean she isn't hitting all of the notes but she's got the spirit!
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (8): yup
 
**welcome2thejam** (8): These harmonies are just unfair
 
**noavocadoshere** (7): heaux tales original run was so compact and tight that i'm actually gonna be sad if i end up not enjoying any of the deluxe tracks (or mo' tales).
 
**uiscebeathaoir** (7): Holding You Down already did this basically
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): I mean u can kinda tell it‚Äôs a bonus track
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This is the weakest track on the album for me, it‚Äôs the only one that doesn‚Äôt feel like it brings anything particularly fresh or new.

**indie\_fan\_** (11): The most 11s on a deep cut for this rate! Fun fact that this was the winner for the first 9 ballots of this rate. I think I shoulda just cut the rate short at 9 ballots‚Ä¶ well.
 
**nt96** (8): this one‚Äôs pretty fascinating. Painting a story of someone hoping to find their millionaire and live in luxury. Lyrics like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping these titties will get me out the city‚Äù really underscore that sense of desperation in leaving the life of poverty. Very beautiful song.
 
---
 
**akanewasright** (11): I heard ‚Äúto be honest‚Ä¶ Money makes me cum‚Äù and expected anything but the song that came next, which is one of the most empathetic songs I‚Äôve ever (?) heard. It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúPart of Your World‚Äù for gold diggers - it lets you in on her motivations in such a way that‚Äôs so full-hearted, you can‚Äôt really help but finding yourself feeling things.
 
**cremeebrulee** (11): not only did i feel this in my soul, but she sounds IMMACULATE on it. the harmonies on the "on the other side" at the end woah...
 
**IIIHenryIII** (11): I can't get enough of that intro. I needed a whole song of her just singing ooohoohhh
 
**Stryxen** (11): good heavens
 
**Ambrosia42** (10): I feel like this is the other perspective to the ‚ÄúGold Digger‚Äù type of song, where it really humanizes this archetype of a woman who just wants a guy for money. For a lot of men, that is all they are bringing to the table anyway! And it‚Äôs a bop
 
**BeauMeringue212** (10): they need to make a new non-racist Gone With The Wind movie just based off this song
 
**bespectacIed** (10): I'm amazed by how Jazmine made admitting to wanting all the superficial things in life so poignant and kinda sad. Like yeah all these shiny silly shit women want are all rooted from life-long loneliness and deprivation, we support bimbo rights and wrongs
 
**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Money can‚Äôt buy happiness but it can buy lots of things that will make you happier.
 
**CrimsonROSET** (10): while i cannot say i have ever struggled monetarily the feeling of just wanting to leave to find somewhere that life can be better for you is something i relate to a lot
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Nobel Prize in Economics maybe?????
 
**Darkknuckles** (10): so close to getting my 11. What a fantastic song discussing a topic i dont see too often in songs.i wanna find a sugar daddy now.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): ‚ÄúFast Car‚Äù for the Instathot generation (complimentary)
 
**girlsuke** (10): SAME!!!!!
 
**impla77** (10): The way this swells, it sells the desperation
 
**JIRACHl** (10): this is for the broke bitches and rexhars only
 
**noavocadoshere** (10): hey...i DO go to work for a job i don't care nothing about! i WILL go to atlanta and find me a rapper! i DO wanna live on the other side >:(
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): capitalism queen
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): I agree where is MY MILLIONAIRE relatable queen
 
**welcome2thejam** (10): Calling up every jukebox musical writer to tell them an incredible "I Want" song is just sitting there for the taking
 
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): she's just like me‚Ä¶
 
**TiltControls** (9): sugar daddy fast car
 
**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I‚Äôve heard too many songs that are just about wanting money and expensive things, I appreciate Jasmine adding this extra dimension of melancholy and fantasy as a means of escape
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): she was so real for this
 
**Used-Rhubarb9105** (8.7): Such good storytelling
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): Yasssss! Capitalism <3 Hahaha
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): ok girl i wanna be rich too youre not special
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (8): this one is radio ready

**Olivier77777** (7): reminds me of Famous
 
**ss2811** (7): another super deep one

**Birdseeding** (10): Wow, the collision of the gospel and the thoroughly modern singing, virtuoso switching between R&B, soul and rap is truly fantastic. Mind blown!

**TiltControls** (10): cant wait to also 11 this in winners/all stars
 
**uiscebeathaoir** (10): The hook is so instantly iconic its hard to believe there was a time when it just didn‚Äôt exist
 
**welcome2thejam** (10): Ladies, if I call you up just to say "Ding dong" and then hang up, you better get that trench coat ready
 
**BeauMeringue212** (9.7): Sommore had a bit in a comedy special of hers about how she let this guy she was seeing away with murder because he had a big dick and fucked good and this song is like that put to the best music possible
 
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): me @ Omar Apollo
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this is for those who give the good dick
 
**noavocadoshere** (9.5): paying a man's rent and letting him borrow my car...it better have the midas touch, i'll tell you hwhat. this song is so difficult to dislike. the production alone! like, i'm bouncing, i'm vibing but i'm also clutching my keys close to me and rebuking the idea of giving a man anything.
 
**ReallyCreative** (9.5): a hoe anthem to end all hoe anthems

**indie\_fan\_** (9.8): And here‚Äôs your runner up! Yeah people really championed this to pull an upset win and while it did put up a good fight (the smallest gap between this and PUYF was about 20 points i believe) it still ended up with a couple tankers. Nevertheless, beautiful song and Kehlani did well choosing this as the lead single for the album.
 
---
 
**Ambrosia42** (11): omg i might have cried a bit
 
**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Ugh absolute slay of the century. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs winning but I‚Äôm hoping for second place!
 
**impla77** (11): this is where the lush instrumentation really hits for me
 
**Nagisoid** (11): I'm putting this song's instrumental on an altar, beyond perfect. Breathtaking vocals and the progression through the song is extremely satisfying. Please don't let this be robbed just because people disliked this album!
 
**OliviaGodrigo** (11): i would give jazmine my 11 if this weren‚Äôt in the rate. but holy shit is this song amazing. what a beautiful approach to singing about loss and grief.
 
**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): This one is just really great, what can I say honestly. The chorus bangs.
 
**welcome2thejam** (11): If you catch me serenely floating in the air on invisible waves then don't disturb me, I'm just listening to altar, off of Kehlani's 2022 album blue water road
 
**1998tweety** (10): ended that fad BANKS
 
**akanewasright** (10): this is the right brand of romance that gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling that even my very single and touch starved ass can appreciate
 
**Awkward\_King** (10): god this is actually one of the most beautiful songs of all time like... how did she create this, its so calming
 
**BeauMeringue212** (10): loved this ever since it dropped as the first single, the lyrics are really beautiful and heartfelt and the reverb-y aquatic sounding guitar really goes well with the beachy/water motifs of the album
 
**bogo** (10): this is like the coziest song ever it feels so warm
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): wouldn't even be upset at this pulling off a win, it's their best song in years
 
**CrimsonROSET** (10): the girls who get it get it
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): i think this is gaining hype to win, and deserving winner tbh! it‚Äôs so precious and dreamy
 
**Darkknuckles** (10): what a sad song. Losing someone is so hard and this encapsulates that feeling.
 
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): literally so pretty‚Ä¶ I adore the meaning of the song and how personal it means to Kehlani.
 
**girlsuke** (10): this is such a healing song, a beautiful song about grief
 
**IIIHenryIII** (10): see? it‚Äôs not that difficult to make a good song
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): I am not a heaux that begs for bannering because thats corny but I do want a special comment section if this does end up winning the rate despite Kehlani having the lowest album average
 
**jaztinax** (10): a vibe and a half
 
**JIRACHl** (10): this is a clear stand out. everything about this song is perfectly done
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): oh this is just perfect from the way everything blooms with the chorus to the outro
 
**sarcasticsobs** (10): Love the chorus
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this does truly ‚Äúslap‚Äù and is a beautiful song lyrically
 
**thedoctordances1940** (10): they just hit the slay button
 
**ThickyIckyGyal** (10): the production, amazing. the lyrics, amazing. the way it's sung, amazing. i can almost feel myself out in open air with the wind in my face esp with the chorus, feels so good.
 
**TiltControls** (10): If Jazmine weren't here this would've been such a great 11
 
**uiscebeathaoir** (10): if this wasn‚Äôt the best song on the album, Kehlani would have failed the assignment
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (10): KEHLANI MEETING ME @ THE ALTAR!?!?!?! PFFT IN MY DREAMS! INSTEAD I'LL JUST DANCE TO THIS TASTY BOP LIKE ALL DA LADIES N' ENBIES DO IN THIS BANGER. ALSO LOOK AT THEIR HAIR! "THAT HAIRCUTE LOOKS A LIL' GRIMES INFLUENCED...JUST A TAD KEHLANI!"
 
**bespectacIed** (9.5): Too beautiful, I get why this was the lead. I dunno why I hear this super faint reverb on her vocals, I love it
 
**ss2811** (9): a truly beautiful song
 
**Stryxen** (9): very good. I love the progression and it sounds deliciously earthy
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): what can i say im a sucker for a good church related sex metaphor
 
**DirtyRat583** (8.2): sources are telling me this will win. im hoping the sources are telling an april fools joke (can u guess when im filling this out)

indie_fan_: **Birdseeding** (8): Gorgeous, the album is hitting its stride in a huge way
 
**flava** (8): this has a really great chorus, and I fear it‚Äôs wasted on verses that can‚Äôt match it
 
**frogaranaman** (8): good meet meet @ ft
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I didn‚Äôt love *While We Wait* or *It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt* but when they released this song it really made me excited for *blue water road*, so pretty and it really builds up in the second half.
 
**soul-glitch** (8): so pretty
 
**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): i know people love this, but i've never really got it. like its good, but not amazing to me.
 
**noavocadoshere** (6.9): i don't hate altar, and it's one of the more fully fleshed out songs here. but it still hasn't grown on me.
 
**lexiaredery** (5): there's something about this that I don't really like. Shame because I want to like it a lot more
 
**Used-Rhubarb9105** (5): I don‚Äôt think I connect with this song very much

**Overall Average**: 7.752 **// Average Controversy:** 1.755

indie\_fan\_: As someone who's generally more into the hip-hop side of r&b, IWGUIW hit with me rather quickly. It took me a bit longer for this album to sink in, but now having listened to it quite a few times I can indeed say this is another great project from Kehlani. Really captures that sensation of feeling at peace and overall has a very calming and serene style of production. Doesn't contain the same highs that I feel their last album did, but you can clearly tell they're at a much better place.
 
nt96: Easily the prettiest sounding album of the four, I absolutely love the breezy feel this album gives. I don‚Äôt listen to Kehlani that much but thanks to this, that just might change!

**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (10.000): OMG I LOVE KEHLANI THEY'RE JUST LIKE ME!!!!!
 
**ReallyCreative** (9.275): Really surprised by how much I loved this, dare I say a more cohesive album than Heaux Tales? Maybe not when including the Tales themselves, but Kehlani put a lot of work in and it really shows for me. Easily my favorite album from her.
 
**sarcasticsobs** (9.008): Their voice just makes me :)
 
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.925): one of my 2022 AOTYs, and I'm so glad we get to rate it. if any albums have the ability to make me ascend it's this one!
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.708): has some weak moments but also some standouts
 
**jaztinax** (8.625): as someone who didn‚Äôt resonate that much with IWGUIW when it came out, i was scared that kehlani was losing me, but wow this album reeled me right back in. love how the album is made to be listened to in order and in full, so it becomes a whole experience. not a single skip!!
 
**welcome2thejam** (8.417): Great pop & b album, consistent the whole way through. Honestly underrated it a teensy bit in my 2022 AOTY rankings
 
**BeauMeringue212** (8.233): I'm a big Kehlani fan, and while I love a lot of tracks on this and to hear her in a more positive space, I feel like as an album it lacks the highs of IWGUIW
 
**impla77** (8.167): This album takes a little bit to get into its groove, but the latter half of the album doesn‚Äôt have a single miss!
 
**TiltControls** (7.917): The title of this album really fits the vibe. Feels like I'm floating when listening to most of these songs
 
**thedoctordances1940** (7.883): I think I listened to this when it came out and didn't really care for it but coming back to it (and probably giving it a bit more attention) it's really good actually! Not perfect by any means and has a few slip-ups, but generally very consistent and their vocals are really good and a few really good highlights here
 
**DirtyRat583** (7.842): this is the most consistent album ive ever heard in my life
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.583): no matter what happens here, Kehlani will always be a rate winner (SZA and Tinashe FLOPPED!)
 
**oscarbrierley1** (7.583): something about this album doesn't connect with me as much as the other albums in the rate and other kehlani albums, but i can't really explain why. i think its a combination of me not liking kehlani's voice as much as the others and the production being too bright and summery for me.
 
**Birdseeding** (7.417): 8 This really is a fantastic album, queer, varied, literate and of an appropriately concise length, in an age where seemingly every half-baked demo gets into some of these releases.
 
**bespectacIed** (7.333): Her most personal alb- (sniper laser aimed at my chest). I liked this album a lot. Probably my least favorite of the 4 but still beautifully made. Back half is great cuz it's where the songs with more substantial beats come through. I get the intention of the chill, subdued songs but I'm a simple man, I wanna bop
 
**uiscebeathaoir** (7.250): The least consistent of the albums, but when it hits it really hits
 
**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.042): This one's a pretty good album. Kinda loses its steam in the last three or so tracks but there's some dope tunes on here. Even the Bieber collab is amazing. Very enjoyable.
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.958): this is an enjoyable, vibey listen and does have some great highlights. I do think it‚Äôs a bit too ‚Äúvibey‚Äù for my personal taste however for me to rate it higher.
 
**Nagisoid** (6.917): I don't really get the hate for this album? Yeah it falls apart big time in the ending section but aside from that it's well done. Kehlani has a beautiful voice and the arrangements here have a great pace and variation to them. Sure there's the Justin Bieber jumpscare but we can ignore that, he ended up getting what he deserved in Men's Ult anyways. Chill but with a structure and backbone to it. However, there are some... non-wise production choices that makes this a hard listen at times. Third fave from this rate.
 
**flava** (6.542): it‚Äôs decent but kinda forgettable, I do wish Kehlani was more consistent cause they do have a lot of fun songs cuts and features
 
**Key\_Establishment\_42** (5.375): "It Was Good Until It Wasn't" was such a great project that this was underwhelming. Too poppy for me.
 
**IIIHenryIII** (4.500): Well, I gave it a try, but this ain‚Äôt my cup of tea.

**nt96** (10): a masterclass of vocal power that can only be performed by a masterclass vocalist.
 
**indie\_fan\_** (9.5): So. where‚Äôs that pretends to be shocked gif again? (Side note can y‚Äôall believe Normani almost had this song?) While this wasn‚Äôt the winner at first, soon as it got to the top spot, it stayed there for the entire time and the gap between the top 2 just got bigger with each ballot. It also helps that it‚Äôs the least controversial song in the rate (only song in the rate not to get anything lower than a 7!). I woulda given this a 10 but the Soul Train performance blows the album version right outta the water. Either way, congrats to Jazmine on the rate win!
 
---
 
**1998tweety** (11): mother did what she had to do here
 
**BeauMeringue212** (11): there were so many 11 candidates in this rate and I didn't want to go straight for the obvious one, but this song is just a straight up classic and every time I relistened to I couldn't not choose it. In a confessional r&b rate this is the most passionate and emotive vocal performance imo
 
**CrimsonROSET** (11): I‚Äôll be honest I did this rate to be on the right side of history on this one
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): my most-played song on the album. great groove to it and jazmine‚Äôs vocal runs are great as well. love the ‚Äúno fucks given‚Äù energy on it, great kiss-off track
 
**DirtyRat583** (11): the harmonies??? marvellous song
 
**ignitethephoenix** (11): so true!!
 
**jaztinax** (11): serve of the century. jazmine really put her ev-er-y-thing in this
 
**JIRACHl** (11): song of the century right here actually
 
**mysario** (11): admittedly the Summer Walker album just kind of went in one ear and out the other but the second Bodies and this played, I felt ALIVE again
 
**ReallyCreative** (11): I just don't know how anyone can listen to this and not become a stan for life
 
**Ambrosia42** (10): her voice is just incredible
 
**bespectacIed** (10): Condragulations, queen. No kind of jinx will stop this win. Deserved? Indubitably. Flawlessly produced and sung, and encapsulated the thesis of the album. Personally, do I agree with the win? Only a little bit, cuz there are lots of songs in this album I'd put over this, but singles bias and critics' sway are unbeatable.
 
**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Hmmm I wonder what song is gonna win the rate?
 
**bogo** (10): gee i wonder what‚Äôs gonna win the rate
 
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): my toxic trait is that I think I can do these vocal runs flawlessly
 
**frogaranaman** (10): the gas line üíÄ
 
**girlsuke** (10): "where u at girl?!!! Pick up your hood feelings"
 
**IIIHenryIII** (10): pick up your 10, ma‚Äôm
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): more like pick up your WIG
 
**impla77** (10): go off sis
 
**Nagisoid** (10): I love the acoustic vibes and the soaring backing vocals
 
**noavocadoshere** (10): am i predictable to give this a ten? maybe. am i gonna do it anyway? oh yeah, it's wholeheartedly deserved. perfection from beginning to end. the only flaw this has is that the official version isn't the live acoustic.
 
**Olivier77777** (10): DAMN the voice
 
**oscarbrierley1** (10): still hits as hard as it did first time i heard it. spotify doesn't mark it as explicit for some reason. so iconic it transcends language.
 
**plastichaxan** (10): Sometimes the basic choice is there for a reason wow I almost 11d but wouldn‚Äôt be mad if it won anyway
 
**RandomHypnotica** (10): i mean, it‚Äôs the smasha for a reason
 
**sarcasticsobs** (10): Holy shit. 11 contenda
 
**seanderlust** (10): those vocal runs are immaculate
 
**soul-glitch** (10): Yesssss Jazmine singggggg
 
**ss2811** (10): this song is everything
 
**Stryxen** (10): weddings graduations funerals

indie_fan_: **akanewasright** (9.8): I think we all kind of expect this to win, and as much as my heart leans more towards other songs, it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ yeah? Why wouldn‚Äôt this win, it fucking rules
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (9.5): I‚Äôd be surprised if this doesn‚Äôt win lol this song is great but is just missing something~~~ for me to give it the full 10
 
**Used-Rhubarb9105** (9.5): If it was the acoustic version it would have been 10

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): ok yeah it‚Äôs exactly as amazing as everyone says it is

indie_fan_: # Heaux Tales
 
---
 
**Overall Average**: 8.488 **// Average Controversy:** 1.426
 
---
 
indie\_fan\_: Well to no one's surprise Jazmine undoubtedly swept here. If you ask me, I don't particularly think there was any way of having a modern R&B rate without Heaux Tales sweeping. I've expressed my dislike for sweeps before, but I suppose I can‚Äôt really talk too much since jaz was still my highest average here...that aside, this project officially takes the 10th spot on the leaderboard for Highest Average albums on the subreddit so far! Not to mention the only album in the rate to not have a single 0. I feel it‚Äôs kinda funny how leading up to the release of Heaux Tales, Jazmine strongly insisted how [this is a project/EP and not a whole album](https://twitter.com/jsullivanmusic/status/1347169173135388673?s=20) cause she felt nerves from putting this out. Flash forward two years later with a tour, first ever grammy, AOTY from both BET and Soul Train, having a deluxe edition released, this body of work recieved far more acclaim than Jazmine likely ever expected. Project, EP, album, whatever you wanna call it (fuck it i just consider the deluxe her 4th studio album since that‚Äôs a whole 45+ minutes even when excluding the tales), it really is such a well executed body of work. Jazmine prolly ain‚Äôt gon be dropping any new projects anytime soon but I‚Äôm cool with that as long as we continue getting music with this kinda quality.
 
nt96: Many of you predicted a rate sweep with this album and honestly I‚Äôm not surprised with that. What did surprised me was just how hard it swept! I was low key hoping Ari or even Kehlani would offer some competition but wow these girls just couldn‚Äôt put up a fight. Listening to this body of work, it‚Äôs easy to see why this album got so much acclaim and why it gave Jazmine her first, long awaited Grammy. Grammy and Rate Winning Singer/Songwriter, Jazmine Sullivan has nice ring to it. See you in Winners rate!

**Key\_Establishment\_42** (9.838): Perfect album. I loved it for how candidly she talked about women's business.
 
**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.808): In 2015 I got deeply obsessed with Jazmine Sullivan - Mascara, so honestly I was blessed with this EP, as it is ‚ÄúJazmine Sullivan - Mascara: The Concept EP‚Äù. Jazmine is such a great storyteller and listener, taking the multitude of black women‚Äôs love stories into this visceral, funny and unflinching project. Jazmine sounds incredible as always, but never rests on her vocal laurels only. She creates this fully-realized story that balances honesty and vulnerability. Chef‚Äôs kiss
 
**bespectacIed** (9.615): Unfair for the other girlies to be against in my opinion the best R&B project of the new decade so far. I'm kinda shy expressing my deep love for this album cuz what business do I, a gay asian man fr a third world country, have on basically the manifesto of the modern black woman??? But maaan, I just can't help but admire how well-done this album is, conceptually and sonically! Jazmine really turned "hoe culture" from something shallow into a humanizing, non-patronizing portrait of what black women go through in the modern dating scene... All the toxicity and depravity and longing to simply connect with someone, candidly and sometimes humorously portrayed. The "tales" interludes were a genius touch, they gave so much more context and gravity to the songs they precede. More than all that, this album's also simply full of fucking bops, ya know? The melding of early 2000s R&B/hip-hop with modern confessional neo-R&B was perfectly done. This gotta have a huge place in modern R&B canon in the next years to come; as a lifelong fan of the genre, i think it already has.
 
**ReallyCreative** (9.592): I mean... it's a classic
 
**Naay96** (9.462): in my opinion, heaux tales is the best album here üíú
 
**oscarbrierley1** (9.385): this is how you do a deluxe. you take what made the original great and turn it up to eleven. no skips all bangers.
 
**sarcasticsobs** (9.208): Philly forever
 
**Wane\_Confessional(no, not the Usher Kind)\_Lietoc** (9.146): more like gamer tales. the songs and beats are immaculate. the dedication follows in line with other artists and with much grace. album rocks. little to say besides that I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did
 
**impla77** (9.146): This album is sooo good. The stories leading into the songs.. the way Jazmine takes inspiration from them is a stroke of genius, everything about this album is next level.
 
**BeauMeringue212** (9.115): Can't really say enough good about this album. The song preludes add so much character and background to the songs and their pov, and Jazmine just sings the hell out of every track.
 
**TiltControls** (9.038): apologies to everyone else in the rate for Jazmine massively setting the standard for what a 10 is
 
**IIIHenryIII** (9.038): I feel sorry for the other girls, but Jazmine‚Äôs album is light years ahead of theirs in terms of quality. If it pulls out a la Renaissance victory, I won‚Äôt be surprised.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8.923): the smasha
 
**thedoctordances1940** (8.785): I sometimes forget how truly special this album(/EP) is, especially that final run of the main album. The interludes throughout work amazingly and helps pull the album together as a whole.

=====

indie_fan_: **uiscebeathaoir** (8.708): Not my favourite album in the rate, but definitely the best (if that makes any sense). This will be remembered for the rest of time as a classic of the genre
 
**Used-Rhubarb9105** (8.592): Honestly it was hard to be critical of this because Jazmine is a complete artist to me. She can express emotions while showcasing her technical vocal ability and stay current which is rare.
 
**welcome2thejam** (8.385): Been putting this album off way too long, hot damn that was good. Kinda like the project more without the Mo Tales DLC expansion, but all the songs here are good at worst. Strong sound, strong voice, strong storytelling
 
**JIRACHl** (8.269): she's sweeping this rate your honor
 
**DirtyRat583** (8.269): oh it is so good. oh she is so good. im a stan now
 
**jaztinax** (8.115): this was one of those albums i would occasionally play but i would rarely actually listen to the tracks, because i just loved listening to jazmine sing. overall a really solid r&b album.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.077): I said on Discord that I thought Ari had the best album in the rate but then when I relistened to this album Jazmine showed up at my house and dog walked me
 
**frogaranaman** (8.077): she looks mother on the cover (like she has kids)
 
**Nagisoid** (8.000): Very moving and touching album. The tales add a lot to the experience and even though we aren't rating them, they were very important to my enjoyment of the project. I really enjoy her voice and the way she knows how to use the backing instrumentation to her advantage. Probably my favorite album in the rate and it has no filler basically.
 
**Birdseeding** (7.692): 9 The real revelation out of these four, this is the true classic and one I immediately put on again after finishing the rate. So clever, so well-sung, so virtuosic in its breadth and generous songwriting. A work of musical genius!
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.654): this is an objectively ‚Äúgood‚Äù album, some of the songs just aren‚Äôt my style (mainly in the deluxe version) which is why it doesn‚Äôt rate higher. The songs I like I LOVE however. This album also has the best vocals in the rate jazmine truly did that for us.
 
**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.192): Yeah the songs here are great, and Jaz does a great job vocally here. Lots of lush harmonies. Great album.
 
**flava** (6.731): it‚Äôs decent and mostly memorable

TiltControls: Great job darius and cat with the hosting! Amazing banners and great shitposts (at least from the day I could make it)

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) have been updated!

## Songs

Congrats to **Pick Up Your Feelings** for winning the rate! Though it just misses the leaderboard, Pick Up Your Feelings still becomes the **33rd** highest rated song on the sub. 

It just places lower than Bj√∂rk - Joga and just above Kacey Musgraves - Merry Go Round

For the other 9+ songs:

* Altar: **190th**

 * Lower than: Lily Allen - The Fear / Clean Bandit - Rather Be (ft. Jess Glynne) (188th)
 * Higher than: Japanese Breakfast - Be Sweet (191st)
* Put It Down: **247th** 
 * Lower than: Taylor Swift - Enchanted (246th)
 * Tied with: Janelle Mon√°e - Screwed (ft. Zo√´ Kravitz) (247th)
 * Higher than: Kimbra - Cameo Lover (249th)
* The Other Side: **264th**
 * Lower than: Robyn - Call Your Girlfriend (263rd)
 * Higher than: Demi Lovato - Don't Forget / Stevie Wonder - Higher Ground / Lucy Dacus - Hot & Heavy (265th)


**Song Stats**

* **Pick Up Your Feelings** becomes the 30th song to join the 7's club! This list is for songs that managed to not get a score lower than 7 in a rate. [You can see the list of songs to accomplish this feat here](https://pastebin.com/KJ64aiUH)

## Artists

Kehlani's the only one that was previously on the leaderboard, though Summer and Jazmine both have a previously rated song influencing their placement (No Lames and Bust Your Windows respectively). Rankings out of 358


* 5th: The Supremes (8.500)
* **6th: Jazmine Sullivan (8.467) [NEW]**
* 7th: Lauryn Hill (8.463)

-

* 118th: Beyonc√© / Daft Punk / WJSN (7.726)
* **121st: Ari Lennox (7.725) [NEW]**
* 122nd: PVRIS (7.723)

-

* 232nd: OH MY GIRL (7.313)
* **233rd: Kehlani (7.310) [PREV 267th]**
* 234th: Dorian Electra (7.308)

-

* 243rd: Fall Out Boy / Niall Horan (7.283)
* **244th: Summer Walker (7.282) [NEW]**
* 245th: BROCKHAMPTON (7.271)

-

Feature changes:

(City Girls and Pharrell are credited on streaming so they will be credited here as well)

* Anderson .Paak: NEW -> 132nd
* SZA: 139th -> 139th
* Cardi B: 276th -> 273rd
* Pharrell Williams: 283rd -> 280th
* City Girls: 307th -> 284th
* Justin Bieber: 348th -> 350th 


**Artist Stats**

* Jazmine's incredibly dominating performance is enough to make her the sub's 6th highest rated artist!
 * Her addition in the top 25 knocks Run the Jewels off the list
* We have a few new artists on the no 0's list! Both Anderson .Paak and Jazmine Sullivan have avoided picking up any 0's on their tracks! Jazmine joins with 0 zeroes / 14 songs while Paak is at 0 / 5. [You can see the active and historic record holders here](https://pastebin.com/q80tmLeg)
* Though Justin Bieber technically has more people higher than him now, his average did actually increase. Now he's no longer the 7th lowest artist but the 9th!
* It's not leaderboard-worthy, but Jazmine's controversy is enough to put her in 12th for least controversial artists

## Albums

I know it seemed like a bloodbath, but all 4 albums placed decently well in the scheme of things!

(Rankings are out of 385)

* 9th: Frank Ocean - channel ORANGE (8.538)
* **10th: Jazmine Sullivan - Heaux Tales (8.488)**
* 11th: Stevie Wonder - Innervisions (8.487)

-


* 133rd: Missy Elliott - Under Construction (7.762)
* **134th: Kehlani - blue water road (7.752)** / Michael Jackson - Bad (7.752)
* 136th: Vince Staples - Big Fish Theory / PVRIS - All We Know Of Heaven, All We Need Of Hell (7.750)

-


* 163rd: Beyonc√© - Lemonade (7.666)
* **164th: Ari Lennox - age/sex/location (7.640)**
* 165th: Lana Del Rey - Honeymoon (7.663)

-


* 277th: Madonna - Like A Prayer (7.305)
* **278th: Summer Walker - Still Over It (7.303)**
* 279th: My Chemical Romance - Danger Days: The True Lives Of The Fabulous Killjoys (7.290)

-

**Album Stats**

* Heaux Tales becomes the sub's 10th highest rated album! (I know the original Heaux Tales is technically an EP, but the extended Mo' Tales version is not so we're using that one even though it's still refered to as just 'Heaux Tales')
 * It knocks Kelela - Take Me Apart off the top 25
* Like mentioned earlier, but Jazmine's Heaux Tales manages to avoid picking up any 0's! Heaux Tales joins the list of 23 other albums that have earned this feat. [You can see them here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard#wiki_no_0.27s)
* Heaux Tales becomes one of the few albums to avoid elimination on day 1 and even most of day 2!
 * Some previous albums that have done this include Dua Lipa - Dua Lipa, Lil Nas X - MONTERO, Janet Jackson - Rhythm Nation 1814, and Beyonce - RENAISSANCE (and some others I'm definitely forgetting)
* Heaux Tales places 2nd for longest streak of songs without losing its first with 31 (as many can guess, RENAISSANCE still has the lead with 33)
* By not making the top 10, Still Over It joins the list of earliest exits in 4 album rates. It ties with Charli XCX's How I'm Feeling Now which also had its top song place 12th
 * Worse performing albums include Christina Aguilera - Bionic (15th), Bebe Rexha - All Your Fault(s) (16th), Carly Rae Jepsen - Dedicated Side B (17th), and Drake - Views (25th)
* It's not a tracked stat, but BPW has the 8th highest score of songs that also placed the worst on their album
