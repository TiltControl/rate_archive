And here was have the first song out today. Definitely the most disliked song in this rate (with the most 0’s), nearly everyone found this to be a corny, boring and simple “we should all get along to solve the world’s problems” track that has not aged well and is the version of Charlie we would not like to see.

**fishingfor8** (6): “We are the world, We are the children, We are the ones who make…”

**ignitethephoenix** (4): I like the intentions this song has but this is so surface level and corny. This feels like it should have been on One Track Mind.

**sbuhj** (9.7): Like If You Leave Me Now, adding James Taylor turns this album from good to great. This song adds a classic feel and turns this album into one that is truely timeless. Not to mention how great of a message this song has.

**pisces\_king** (8.2): James Taylor is a legend, a little bit of a yawn though for me. But this is another reminder of Charlie being beloved by music's biggest names, which is not for nothing. In a way, this is Charlie's 'Where is the Love?'

**InfernalSolstice** (8): 5

**1998tweety** (7): Ok

**rickikardashian** (6.5): you got mad wrong if you think if you think I'll sit here while 2 white straight men tell me that we have to change to all get along together

**drewbarrymore2** (6): More corniness. Always a skip for me

**ManofOranges** (6): While a part of me wants to kind of hate this song because the message behind it is just so kitschy and naive maybe, I actually don't hate it. The main drawback here is just that it's boring!

**rotating3Dtext** (5.5): why can’t we just get along guys?? you ever think about it??

**runaway3212** (5.5): Very corny, but at least with a decent message.

**bbfan132** (5): extremely dull and inauthentic

**bespectacIed** (5): This is so cheesy and corny and cringe (the Three C's) but I give this props for ending bigotry while sneakily ending homophobia by sounding just like Macklemore - Same Love.

**bulforster** (5): Pleasant enough musically, but what a childishly basic analysis of the world's problems.

**fix-ur-acrostics** (5): Eh, I've heard this idea done better.

**hikkaru** (5): I can't at "why can't we just get along?" literally being the hook of this song :skull:

**jackisboredtoday** (5): ,2

**pjones3416** (5): instrumental sounds like animal crossing music

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (4): Meh. I appreciate the intention but a white man making a song about "why we can't just get along" in 2018 is so redundant. I kinda want to give this a 0 but I'll be nice in this rate so I am giving this a 5.

**oliveoilgarlic** (4): my dad would love this

**sweetnsoursauce1** (4): i hate to be that person hating on slow songs bc i do enjoy them but this is also boring

**vayyiqra** (4): This is really boring and more than a little cringe but also I love James Taylor unironically he's a woke king and deserves much better than this

**CritneySpearz** (3): maybe I just hate boomers, but it’s just cringey filler to me

**Leixander** (3): i am... disgusted

**PointlessBibliophage** (3): i'm sorry but yawn tbh

**skargardin** (3): This is terribly uninteresting but like, preach

**turtle-thief** (3): I adore songs about non specific change!

**ariiaaaa** (2): I didn't come here for True Colours, what is this nonsense

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1.5): meh. I feel like Charlie is kinda bad at conveying emotion in his songs? Like his vibe in this song doesn’t feel right, and this song has been done 1000 times. It’s just boring hollow snapping beat.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): this “we need everyone to be nice :-)” shit… i thought he left behind the cheesiness on Nine Track Mind?

**akanewasright** (0): “Why can’t we just get along” Charlie, you’re better than this. This is the only song in this rate that I would call “insufferable”. If Attention loses the rate, I’m gonna just say that it was punishment for this fucking song.

**DrunkHurricane** (0): Well boys we did it hatred is no more

**fadedblue09** (0): First of all, YIKES at this lyricism (is Nine Track Mind Charlie really dead?). Second, why does he insist on collabing with people who easily outshine him?

**followingfreeways** (0): sorry this is one of the worst songs ive ever heard and truly wish he never put this on the album!!!

**ggodisawomann** (0): this could've just not existed, thank you.

**hunnybee12** (0): bro why cant we all just get along, cmon pls bro

**nightjesus** (0): Charlie I don’t get along with this song lol. It makes me cringe. It’s such white boy pandering. I had to unsave this from my Spotify and I haven’t listened to it since it came out. I’m really sorry if anyone out there does like this song but I think it’s the worst song on Voicenotes by faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (0): i met james taylor once. he sucks

**TragicKingdom1** (0): tacky and boring

**wavingwolves** (0): ehhh this kind simplification of social issues can be sometimes harmful but it's always annoying. on top of that, this is definitely the weakest song on the album sonically, so... i have to give it a 0 because i don't want to hear this ever again

# Here is the first Weeknd song out for the day (unsurprisingly). A song that was 5 minutes somehow for absolutely no reason at all, this song was second last for the whole time while collecting scores. It also features a weird Future verse which some people did not like at all so this placement makes sense.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): I actually really liked this song at first however it’s like 2 minutes too long and doesn’t add anything new. 6 feet under should have been the only Future feature and this could have been scrapped.

**fishingfor8** (4): It's way too long. This portion of the album definitely feels a bit like filler

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this song goes hard doe

**fix-ur-acrostics** (8): This is one of those songs where if the individual parts are at 98%, it falls apart. I'd say we're at a solid 99%.

**vayyiqra** (8): The reasons I can't have you, are so easy to fix / I didn't really plan to, but I'ma do it for this this song is about the pandemic and Future said the answer is "fuck it mask on"

**wavingwolves** (8): future good

**pisces\_king** (7.8): Future definitely elevates this track.

**oliveoilgarlic** (7.5): um what are you talking about this is the only Future collab on this album

**1998tweety** (7): Ok

**jasannn** (7): Future's verse kinda kills the song.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): As much as I prefer the R&B side of the album, it’s really becoming a slog at this point. Future’s part didn’t really need to be super long.

**bespectacIed** (6): it's ok

**hunnybee12** (6): my life was exponentially better when i forgot the 7 song run from Six Feet Under to All I Know existed

**plastichaxan** (6): i wish i liked future more sometimes

**runaway3212** (6): Not good, not terrible

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): better than i remember it being but still one of the weakest songs here

**sbuhj** (5.3): In sharp contrast, not a fun song. Would not listen again.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): Having Future in this track is kinda ironic and contradicts what Weeknd is trying to do with the song lol.

**bbfan132** (4.5): future’s verse was odd and this was another unmemorable track

**sweetnsoursauce1** (4.5): fillerrr

**nightjesus** (4): I was really hoping a Future appearance would save this but oh my god this song dragged on. All I know was that I wanted this song to end lmfao.

**pjones3416** (4): future verse sounds really out of place :/

**TragicKingdom1** (4): why didnt they just expand future's part on six feet under and cut this from the album

**ggodisawomann** (3): dude fuck Future he's only good on Everyday by Ari. this song is SLEEP

**Leixander** (3): Future either ruins or completes a song, sadly it is the former here. Not to mention that the song is still on filler territory even without him.

**ManofOranges** (3): All I know is that I don't really like this one either.

**TiltControls** (2): All I know is that listening to this song is a bore

**ImADudeDuh** (1): please turn good by the end of the album again (I Feel It Coming is the closer so yeah it’ll be good)

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (0): Its too long for the lack of content, and I don’t like Future in this song. The Weeknd here is just really boring. And they CAN do good stuff together (six feet, lowlife) so this is an even MORE disappointing mess

Here we have another Weeknd filler track. Many agree this could have been scrapped and that it was boring and generic and forgettable. The one 10 being the highest score sums it all up that its very mid.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): This song is decent but once again it suffers as a filler track that wasn’t needed on here.

**fishingfor8** (4.5): more filler. This album could lose around 3 tracks and be fine, it really drags down the album total.

**kaanew** (8.5): an underrated bop

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.3): i need the clubs to open so i can slut drop to this NOW

**sbuhj** (8.2): A fun song. I'd listen to it again.

**pisces\_king** (7.7): Strong, not exceptional.

**1998tweety** (7.5): She's alright

**Leixander** (7.5): Pick up the phone,,, I got a question,,, If i die tonight,,, would you regret it????

**bespectacIed** (7): very beauty behind the madness

**vayyiqra** (7): This is fine but the last three songs have blended into each other and even with a break in the middle around the interlude, this album is so LONG wtf

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Oh great, another forgettable, disappointing chorus. I think the album is getting stale at this point.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): filler. FML >>>

**wavingwolves** (6): pre chorus more enjoyable than the actual chorus

**bbfan132** (5): boring filler, bad mixing, annoying guitar… could’ve been released as a deluxe track or something

**ggodisawomann** (4.5): sumn about this is just too noisy but I would otherwise like it more without the added pots and pans

**runaway3212** (4.5): I dislike the constant repeating of nothing.

**bigbigbee** (4): Sorry, the echo in the chorus really grates on me.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): oh no this album turned bad near the end (and no, its not because it was long)

**ManofOranges** (3): I honestly don't remember this song so it must not have been that good to me.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1.5): Stream Nothing Compares to You instead

## Charlie closes off his album with this ballad, which many people thought made sense as a closer, but also found to be boring, generic and annoyingly corny. Another song that makes sense as a bottom tier.

**fishingfor8** (7): somewhat melodramatic

**ignitethephoenix** (7): This song definitely makes sense as a closer, I just feel that slower songs seem out of place on this album in general.

**TiltControls** (10): Great ballad and a good way to end the album.

**sbuhj** (8.5): Interestingly, this album concludes with a jump from the most developed song to the song most like Charlie's previous album. Somehow, though, it works as a closer. It's a bookend to The Way I Am and a reminder of what it took to get to Empty Cups.

**1998tweety** (8): This works well as a closer tbh.

**kaanew** (8): not usually a big fan of his slower songs but I was too busy enjoying myself to notice.

**plastichaxan** (8): finally a song above a 7 in this album...oh wait

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): This is a cute closer for the album.

**pisces\_king** (7.1): Feels like first album Charlie again... emotional, soft, but I'm not 100% sold on the emotion. He's been through.. what exactly? The dog biting him to give him his iconic eyebrow gap? Definitely an effective ballad, though.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): Didn’t pay it much mind it at first, but then I realized if the 1975 did this song I’d probably love it lol. Especially the whole “gospel” element. So I can’t hate too much. A good album closer ngl 😶✨

**ManofOranges** (7): Kind of a weak closer in my opinion! Doesn't really do much for me. Has Charlie really been through it all? I don't think so!

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): this is gay lol

**wavingwolves** (6.5): this is kind of weak for a closer but it's a solid ballad

**followingfreeways** (6): eh

**ggodisawomann** (6): pretty song but I skip this nearly always. have to be in a mood for it.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5.5): idk how i feel about this as an album closer tbh

**akanewasright** (5): This song is about nothing. At least it sounds nice. It sounds like something Mariah would sing in the 90’s, except she would write better lyrics. Actually... can we get those two to write together?

**hunnybee12** (5): sounds like a glee cover of a Frank Sinatra song

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i get that this is an optimistic closer but like ehhhh

**nightjesus** (5): Charlie does need improvement in his song writing. I love the song composition and production but he really looses me in the lyrics. Ugh.

**runaway3212** (5): As corny as Change but with less heart

**bbfan132** (4.5): time to go to sleep

**oliveoilgarlic** (4): the only crazy things that have actually happened to Charlie Puth are that eyebrow scar and the time Stereogum printed that he said he was “hungies”

**bespectacIed** (3): Nauuuuur charlie baby why did u have to end a great album in a low note, this is sleepy

**CritneySpearz** (3): “I’ve been through it all” says the 26 year old millionaire… sure jan

**Leixander** (3): A very generic ballad attempt.

**skargardin** (3): please this is SO faux dramatic

**vayyiqra** (3): At least he had the courtesy to save the cheesy and dramatic piano ballad for the end because it would be unbearable anywhere else

**bulforster** (2): I was feeling like Charlie’s kinda turned over a new leaf and then guess who came back, the old Charlie.

**fadedblue09** (1): Thanks for ending this album with such a pretentious and poor attempt at introspection.

The Weeknd filler continues to be eliminated (as it should!). This is another track that could have been scrapped and as many people mentioned, Charlie’s song with the same name outsold drastically.

**fishingfor8** (8.3): Another low-key song that isn’t a standout on the album, but still a solid track

**ignitethephoenix** (0): This song is a filler / snooze to me. It’s just a whole lot of nothing and I don’t think I really listen to it ever (and the Weeknd is my most listened to artist so that says something).

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): this rate having two song's called Attention and they're both amazing

**fadedblue09** (9): The superior song named Attention song in the rate, and that’s on that.

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.5): it pains me to say this, but the other one outsold

**sbuhj** (8.5): Hmm, we're getting a better known Attention soon. I like this one though! This is a product of the EDM hayday, and it's a bit unfortunate this style fell out of favor.

**bespectacIed** (8): Charlie outsold omg i can't believe that I'm saying that. Still a solid song, the ooOOhs are so addicting. I just wish the chorus had more body

**runaway3212** (8): Charlie did it better, but still very great.

**1998tweety** (7): Charlie outsold

**hikkaru** (7): the other attention >>>

**jasannn** (7): It doesn't compare to Charlie Puth's but it's not bad.

**vayyiqra** (7): lo-fi chill hiphop beats to vibe to

**wavingwolves** (7): this is a little too muted but it's still good

**pisces\_king** (6.4): It works with the album's sound, but I don't love it.

**ariiaaaa** (6): not a fan of this one but its solid nonetheless

**bigbigbee** (6): A song that’s let down by its chorus; I find it so whiny! It’s not even the lyrics; the melody isn’t my style.

**rotating3Dtext** (6): not the best song named Attention in this rate

**rickikardashian** (5.7): the inferior attention

**bbfan132** (5.5): people think this sounds like thinkin bout you apparently ??? that song is beautiful, this is a boring filler track

**wardrum5** (5.5): this couldve been left off the album

**cremeebrulee** (5): i stan abel but charlie outsold

**fix-ur-acrostics** (5): The second-best song called Attention in this rate.

**ManofOranges** (5): The inferior song named attention in this rate.

**pat-rickstar** (4.5): Not as good as Charlie's.

**jackisboredtoday** (4.4): probably my least favorite song Abel’s made, this just lacks the charge of his better work & should’ve been left on the cutting room floor

**bulforster** (3.5): Sounds a bit like the Hills to me but without any of the grit, the instrumental is especially weak.

**ggodisawomann** (3): Puth very much outsold

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): Filler queen

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): this song is gross

**skargardin** (3): this is not on an "it's just there" level for me, it's barely non-existent. I just can't grasp any part of it. completely forgettable

**ImADudeDuh** (2): charlie is unbothered

Another of the filler cuts on the bloated Starboy, this song could have not been there and nothing of value would have been lost. There seems to be minimal effort from everyone in this song which makes it quite skippable and a bottom tier song.

**fishingfor8** (6): This is probably the most generic song on the album

**ignitethephoenix** (6): Look normally I vibe with sexual Weeknd but the thought of road head doesn’t sit well with me for some weird reason lmao so I don’t listen to it much and I just skip once I hear the first part. Also this song is kind of boring too.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): i can already tell you’re all gonna rob this song but the verses are some of the best stuff on this album

**wavingwolves** (8): kinda haunting

**pisces\_king** (7.6): Builds very nicely.

**Leixander** (7.5): I swear if I hear a James Dean reference in a song one more time... Meh lyrics aside, this still bops.

**sbuhj** (7.5): This ain't an ordinary life, but it is an ordinary song. At least it foreshadows Pray for Me.

**akanewasright** (7): Abel is clearly on autopilot here, but he sounds good, he’s good enough that his autopilot is still pretty good, and the producers fucking KILL it. Like, the song just sounds great.

**vayyiqra** (7): more lo-fi chill beats but it's still good

**1998tweety** (6.5): I sleep

**runaway3212** (6.5): I have a feeling he is trying to say that this is not ordinary life.

**bbfan132** (6): another filler track

**wardrum5** (6): the chorus is boring

**ggodisawomann** (5.5): this song has been recommended to me several times now and I STILL don't know what I think about it

**fix-ur-acrostics** (5): Is it just me, or does this sound awfully similar to Reminder?

**ManofOranges** (5): This song is where the lenght of the album really starts to hit me. I can the feel the end is coming but there are still a few more songs until we get there and it just feels like cmon now let's get this over with.

**oliveoilgarlic** (5): “heaven in her mouth but a hell of a tongue” top 5 opening lines of 2016

**fadedblue09** (4.5): The chorus is super repetitive and forgettable. Also the production is giving me a headache for some reason.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1): I love The Weeknd but the writing on this track is literally putting me to sleep

**bulforster** (0): The chorus is mind-numbing and I hate it.

Either you love this song because of Lana, or you hate it because of her. Or you are somewhere in between and wish this was a full song or wish it was scrapped completely. Interludes usually don’t fare well in rates so this placing makes sense considering all circumstances.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): although it is a interlude, I’ve always wanted more from this track. Like he got lana on the album but all we got was this song and some backing vocals? It’s nice and fits the tone of the album well however.

**fishingfor8** (6.7): They have good chemistry

**1998tweety** (10): Lana is queen. Periodt.

**bespectacIed** (10): it's so good, abelana has not made ONE bad song. Shouldn't have been an interlude. Gorgeous. And I know I shouldn't like this because it's a lana song ... but I love it, starboOOoy

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Am I still angry at Lana? Yes. Will I still give this a 10 because of her alone? Yes.

**gannade** (10): a reycist dolphin

**ManofOranges** (10): Wasn't sure if I should give this one a 10 because it's just an interlude but I decided fuck it because it's short sweet and to the point and I like it and that's all that matters.

**runaway3212** (10): 'I shouldn't cry but I love it' is the only lyrics this song needed to get my 10.

**SideBTrack8** (10): This would easily be my 11 if it was more than just an interlude

**plastichaxan** (9.8): the amount of times i have transcended with this why does miss lana have to be a mess

**wardrum5** (9.5): Full song please

**pisces\_king** (9.2): I looooove this interlude so so much. All I want is for it to be longer. Lana is wack as hell but this is such a hit.

**oliveoilgarlic** (9): slow dancing in a kitchen music

**bbfan132** (8.5): why is this one of my favorite songs on the album….. it’s an interlude 💀

**bigbigbee** (8): Had a hard time rating this one. It’s fantastic as an interlude when you listen to the whole album (the instrumental and Lana’s vocals are >>>>>>) but as a standalone song? I don’t think I’d listen to it. Not enough payoff.

**skargardin** (8): lust for life wishes it had the power this has

**vayyiqra** (8): I wish this were longer and/or that Lana and the Weeknd collaborated more I really like how their voices sound together and this is a vibe

**Leixander** (7.5): Could be great as a full song.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): even the least exciting of Abel’s duets with lana del reypublican (which, tbf this one’s just an interlude) is still decent. the chemistry is there

**sbuhj** (7.2): Uh, points for originality I guess? I mean Lana's style is never going to be my favorite but this is a successful interlude.

**timothy444** (7): It's called an interlude for a reason :kisskiss:

**TragicKingdom1** (7): i swear if a delusional lana stan gives this an 11...

**hikkaru** (6): when this gets entirely too high just bc of lana

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): this song reminds me of tumbleweeds? idk but l\*na sounds good😍

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5.8): cute but doesn't do much for me

**kaanew** (5.5): I cannot stan Lana for obvious reasons, but I love this lil interlude a lot so I’m adding five points back on.

**fadedblue09** (5): Lana’s falsetto was ugly but otherwise serviceable

**PointlessBibliophage** (5): we're gonna pretend this balances out all the 10s i gave her last month k?

**ariiaaaa** (4.5): I've never been able to vibe with Lana ever, I wonder about her interesting vocal technique sometimes, it sounds extremely headvoice-y and breathy

**akanewasright** (4): I used to stan this for the sole purpose of it being Lana singing high. Now... meh. Can’t wait to see what tracks it beats though.

**wavingwolves** (4): this sounds like a cheap mix... the mixing on lana's voice seems so off idk

**ggodisawomann** (3): Lana ain't for me so this interlude REALLY ain't for me

**nightjesus** (3): Lana Del Ray stans don’t at me pls.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): i’ve really never understood the purpose of this interlude in the context of this project but popheads will always circlejerk lana

**fix-ur-acrostics** (0): Look, I like the Weeknd, I even like Lana, but they have some sort of bizarre anti-chemistry whenever they work together.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): the vocals here are awful.

## Our losing bonus song is none other than Low Life! I think most people think it is a banger at first but wow does it ever drag. If this was like 3 minutes long it probably would be higher but for some reason the Weeknd and Future think we want to listen to 5 minutes of their music everytime they collab. This is basically All I Know and 6 feet under’s more popular love child.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): The original 6 feet under...well The Weeknd does the same flow here that he does in his song on Starboy although this song came out first. Future and him must have just churned out those song in the same session or something. Anyway, this song is fine just a tad too long.

**fishingfor8** (7): Wow Future is incredibly mediocre/bad for being so influential.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song screams freshman year college frat party to me

**fix-ur-acrostics** (10): The Weeknd is so good, he actually made me understand Future.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): I blasted this song at like 14, lol wtf. I loved it though, and it still holds up for me.

**kaanew** (9): an iconic banger

**1998tweety** (8.5): Poppy outsold

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Ohh I really like The Weeknd's vocals here. This song is probably much better than the Futre collabs on Weeknd's actual Starboy album.

**pisces\_king** (7.1): Future is good and overall decent.

**vayyiqra** (7): percocets (ya) molly percocets (percocets) / rep the set (yee) gotta rep the set (gang GANG)

**bbfan132** (6): decent track

**ManofOranges** (6): Meh. I don't hate it.

**fadedblue09** (4): Eh good performance from Abel but very boring.

**hunnybee12** (4): it's 5 minutes long but feels like it drags on for a lifetime

**CreepyMannequin** (3): Chorus is good but I do not vibe with Future.

**ggodisawomann** (3): Future..agh

**sweetnsoursauce1** (3): fuck me this was a drag to listen to

**wavingwolves** (3): this sounds like something else but i can't tell you what

**bespectacIed** (2): this is awful so I am just gonna link [this hilarious tweet about future](https://twitter.com/disgustinglyhot/status/1263522004365434887?s=20)

Okay personal note here, I don’t get why this is so hated?? Sure it’s not as good as Finesse remix but this being the second lowest bonus song is absolutely tasteless.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): An obvious capitalization off the success of the finesse remix, this song is still pretty good and they continue to have good chemistry, but it’s still pretty easy to compare this to the remix which is much better.

**fishingfor8** (8): Very overhated.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Cardi's "Your pussy basura / My pussy horchata" is a 10 alone.

**wavingwolves** (10): cardi and bruno work really well together

**pisces\_king** (9.9): I mean another WIN for this duo. It is VERY difficult for me to play this song without wanting to immediately play it again. I'm also obsessed with whenever Cardi sings.

**ManofOranges** (9): This song has grown on me a lot since it first came out. Didn't really care for it but now I kinda like it a lot? I'm not sure how often I'd seek it out but I'll certainly enjoy it when it comes on.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): They have better chemistry here than the Finesse Remix.

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): your pussy BASURA my pussy HORCHATAA

**ggodisawomann** (8): needs a little more climax but still a bop! if you disagree, your pussy is basura! (mine's horchata)

**oliveoilgarlic** (7): more music videos set in vaporwave taco bell please

**1998tweety** (6): Meh

**bbfan132** (6): i should like this more than i do but parts of this are kind of messy/disjointed

**bespectacIed** (5): so dry

**jackisboredtoday** (4.6): bad

**PointlessBibliophage** (4): this song doesn't

**vayyiqra** (4): I want to like this but also fuck off Cardi this would be good if almost anyone but her were on it oh I forgot she said "my pussy horchata" that sounds like a yeast infection waiting to happen wow I hate this

**nightjesus** (3): I feel like they could have made something so much better but oh well. I guess you could say I’m not pleased at how boring this

**sweetnsoursauce1** (3): i still hate this song

**fix-ur-acrostics** (2): This is just Finesse but worse.

**skargardin** (2): no

**CritneySpearz** (1): make it stop

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1): this is the same score I gave it in the rap girls rate. knockoff finesse just doesn’t do it for me 😶

Oh look, another Future track. Although this is the better one out of the 2, it’s a one note trap track which is not for some people (and 6 Inch by beyonce and the weeknd outsold).

**fishingfor8** (7.7): The Future part of this song is great

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): definitely the best Future feature on here although this song definitely seems like a watered down version of Low Life (which outsold completely).

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): idk what to say this is just great lol. I’m a whore for this type of Weeknd song 🥴

**fadedblue09** (9): The chorus goes HARD. I guess I’ll never get tired of trap music.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): this gets me so hype

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): stream the 2001-2005 acclaimed television series Six Feet Under on hbo go, hbo now, or hbo max

**1998tweety** (7): Who is the man in the background cause he's lowkey doing more here.

**ariiaaaa** (7): I gotta say, the change from Sidewalks to this was smooth as fuck

**bigbigbee** (7): Otherwise pleasant, so-so song that is elevated by the bridge.

**cremeebrulee** (7): six inch does the subject matter better tbh

**runaway3212** (7): Billie did it better.

**skargardin** (7): a lil messy

**vayyiqra** (7): dark trap bangers >>>

**rickikardashian** (6.7): the hook isn't good enough to be repeated that many times

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): the better Future collab in the main rate but still one of the more forgettable songs here

**bbfan132** (6): i don’t remember this but i didn’t dislike it so

**bespectacIed** (6): 6 INCH outsold, outimpacted, outeverythinged

**ImADudeDuh** (6): “She know her pussy got a fanbase” made me scream honestly

**ManofOranges** (6): I'm not really a fan of this one. I'm not gonna say that I actively wait for this one to end when it comes on or make some pun about how I go six feet under when I listen to it because I don't hate it or anything it's just like I listen to it and I'm like.... now what.

**sbuhj** (5.8): I feel like I'm listening to Sorry Not Sorry, early Lady Gaga, trap, and Jeremih all at the same time. Like what??

**nightjesus** (5.5): I like the bad bitch story but I just find a lot of the songs repetitive. I’m really disappointed because I mostly enjoyed this album in the beginning.

**wavingwolves** (5.5): yeah this is average

**pisces\_king** (5.2): Least favorite on the album.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (4): eh

**fix-ur-acrostics** (4): Well, it's definitely a Weeknd song.

**ggodisawomann** (4): Weeknd filler! why!

**Leixander** (4): Not remarkable in any way.

(1 x1) gannade

(0 x2) CreepyMannequin, static\_int\_husp

## One of the more controversial tracks here, Perm is upbeat and fun however some people find it a little too much to the point where it’s annoying to listen to.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I love the energy this song has. For some reason I feel like there’s something missing from it to make it an excellent song, so it’s not a song from here I intentionally come back to.

**fishingfor8** (6): Too obnoxious for me

**wardrum5** (9.5): I don't think I'd ever heard this even though I listened to this album when it came out but wow this should've been the single

**ManofOranges** (9): So, I think it's pretty clear that Bruno is just doing a James Brown impression but you know what, I'm not complaining.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): this is such an unconventional song done very well. great songwriting on this

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this has very hetero energy, which a lot of this album has, but its less fun

**kaanew** (8): love this song but I have to -2 for the whistles

**skargardin** (8): banger

**pisces\_king** (7.4): The James Brown is here!

**ggodisawomann** (7): this song wild from start to finish

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): This is campy as fuck omg. The energy, especially from a modern artist though, is great.

**nightjesus** (7): I mean some of the lyrics I’m kinda like ‘damn Bruno just let her be mad’ but then I remember to activate my sexy.

**vayyiqra** (7): in which Bruno Mars does his best James Brown, which is pretty good really

**wavingwolves** (7): the "activate your sexy" made this song lose a few points ngl

**rickikardashian** (6.8): i remember people were calling bruno mars a culture vulture when the backlash for the grammy win happened, and i still feel like that wasnâ€™t necessarily trueâ€¦â€¦. but i understand how they could think that from this

**1998tweety** (6.5): No this ain't doing it for me.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): the whistle noises and the third verse aggravate me a lil sry

**ariiaaaa** (6): it's annoying that I can't dislike this song more because "activate your sex" the worst line ever

**bbfan132** (6): this is technically good but i don’t know if i’d want to listen to it again… kind of faceless

**runaway3212** (6): Not my favourite

**Leixander** (5): you need to relax in tkb's voice

**sbuhj** (4.4): I know lots of people like this album, and more power to them. But I prefer soulful Bruno to the one whose self esteem is too high. The music in this song is too chaotic to redeem the song from the lyrics.

**bespectacIed** (4): great production but what a mess of a song

**bulforster** (4): The fact he shouts pretty much all the lyrics makes it come off uncomfortably pushy.

**fadedblue09** (4): Probably the most borderline annoying song on the album.

**pat-rickstar** (3.5): Not a fan of these lyrics but the instrumental redeems them a bit.

**PointlessBibliophage** (3): what is this song no

**akanewasright** (2): Man, I hate str\*ight people

**jasannn** (2): Why does he keep yelling at me? My only skip of the album

**gannade** (1): i wish i had another 0 for this

**CreepyMannequin** (0): I thought 24K Magic was bad but omg…..

**static\_int\_husp** (0): I think the reason I dislike the (non-ballad) album cuts of this so much is that they sound like really bad showtunes.

Here we have a more mid tempo ballad from the Weeknd. Although it sounds nice, it definitely is boring compared to a lot of other songs in this rate which is why it’s ranked here.

**fishingfor8** (7.8): Another song I like, but it's really slow and not a lot is going on.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This song is nice however compared to other stuff on the album it bores me a bit. I like how he switched it up with a more r&b type song here, it definitely shows his versatility.

**fadedblue09** (9): Yessss king. Slay me with those vocals.

**hunnybee12** (9): cute

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): the lyrics are cliche but his voice omg fuck me 😍

**pisces\_king** (8.4): Emotional ballad that is impossible not to sing along to.

**bespectacIed** (8): this sounds like a Loona/Odd Eye Circle song

**runaway3212** (8): It's simple, but nice.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): love the melody and the little fluorishes

**sbuhj** (7.8): This is some nice fresh R&B. Not trying to be too much, but also not quite enough.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): this is pretty standard but still well made and v enjoyable

**1998tweety** (7): She's alright, never thought I'd say this but Kesha really did outsell huh.

**ManofOranges** (7): I like the sentiment on this one.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): epic bridge but weak final chorus

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the bridge was good, but the rest was pretty meh

**pat-rickstar** (6): A Cyndi Lauper cover might have been better.

**vayyiqra** (6): I see your true colors shining through I see your true colors that's why I love you

**bbfan132** (5.5): i don’t remember this and i just listened to it

**bulforster** (5.5): Cyndi Lauper heavily outsold.

**CritneySpearz** (5): boring

**fix-ur-acrostics** (5): Feels like there could be more going on here.

**Leixander** (5): Quite meh. Should've been cut from the album.

**skargardin** (5): a mediocre end to an otherwise STELLAR first half

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5): sorry but this song if definition of filler

**bigbigbee** (4): I get why people might like this song, but I find it very dreary.

**ggodisawomann** (3): meh

If you had to pick another filler track from a 9 song album, this would be one of them. Although it’s not bad, it’s not for everyone and you have to be in the right mood.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This I think is one of my favourites from here personally. I love the ooo’s in the chorus and how smooth it is. The Halle berry voicemail is a choice (that I don’t hate but it’s kind of hilarious) but I don’t think it detracts from the rest of the song.

**fishingfor8** (8.3): You have to be in the right mood to enjoy this, still is really good though.

**bespectacIed** (10): "all the ishas waiting for me" kinda cringe line coming from bruno's mouth. But wow the vocals yet again, it's impossible to hate a song as well-sung as this. The Halle Berry voicemail, ico fucking nic

**hunnybee12** (10): toxic king

**ManofOranges** (10): I can see people possibly hating this one but I just love it! There's something about it.

**oliveoilgarlic** (9): THE HARMONIES !!!

**jasannn** (8.5): I GOT ISHAS WAITING!

**Leixander** (8.5): the breakdown around the second minute mark is amazing

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Bruno's vocals here are amazing. WAIT A MINUTE? IS THAT HALLE BERRY???????

**fadedblue09** (8): This track is very slick in its production. Wish the song itself was just as strong, but otherwise serviceable.

**runaway3212** (8): The call outro is a nice effect

**bbfan132** (7.5): first tiffany and heather and now alicia and aisha?? nice jam though

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): epic song progression only

**wavingwolves** (7.5): idk why but this title is so funny to me

**1998tweety** (7): I'm starting to get tired.

**nightjesus** (7): I always lmfao the voice mail.

**rickikardashian** (7): he’s talking about ayesha erotica

**skargardin** (7): serve

**vayyiqra** (7): more chad energy

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): I want to love this bc what a title, but tbh the song itself is kinda mid… love Halle Berry though

**ggodisawomann** (6.5): also cute live, studio did not outsell

**pisces\_king** (5.9): Fine, just fine.

**sbuhj** (4.2): What is that voice? Oh my gosh this is awful.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (4): i hate the spoken part with the voice mail and it drags sorry not sorry

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): I hate how his voice sounds in the verses. Idk like nothing in this song makes any sense but it do be vibey

**ImADudeDuh** (3): calling all my game grumps fans

**plastichaxan** (2.9): guess i'm not a lovely

## A Charlie Puth ballad? Time to give it a mid to low score since we are only here for bops. But jokes aside, this song does seem like another filler track on a strong album which is why it’s a day 1 song. It’s not bad at all but definitely not a standout

**fishingfor8** (7.4): It’s okay i guess.I don’t really know what to say for this one.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): This isn’t a bad song but it’s repetitive and a bit boring. This is definitely major filler on what has been a strong yet of songs so far.

**ggodisawomann** (10): I'm not normally a ballad person but this is fantastic. look up the scrapped MV for it on youtube. it's cute.

**ManofOranges** (9): A slower song, but there's nothing with that because it's still a serve.

**pisces\_king** (8.8): This is a slower one that really, really, works for me.

**sbuhj** (8.6): This song is kind of bland until the key change adds much needed flair. It's the first of the slow songs, and probably second worst behind Through It All. But this song is still really good, which is a testament to the strength of the album.

**akanewasright** (8.5): This is going to go out early because popheads hates ballads (and some of the lyrics do kinda suck), but I love it so much.

**hikkaru** (8.5): the bridge is so good

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This is lyrically one of his best songs on the album.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): I actually appreciate how straightforward this song is. Like it conveys its message so simply and it’s so pretty. Can see this playing at a wedding.

**rickikardashian** (8): charlie is man that ain't shit in this song honestly, but Im not looking for a moral compass in music and this bops

**turtle-thief** (8): I was surprised by how much i enjoyed that chorus, it's vanilla but very good vanilla.

**1998tweety** (7.5): Cute

**fadedblue09** (7): Feels like filler, but it's a decent one at least.

**followingfreeways** (7): its good but also...men asking us to be patient..funny

**bbfan132** (6): not bad, just kinda dull

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): this is. very corny

**skargardin** (6): i mean.. it sure is a song

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): not a bad song by any means but after such a strong intro it always was going to fall a bit flat

**jackisboredtoday** (5.4): i barely stuck through the end of this… i guess i’m impatient

**kaanew** (5): ...kinda boring. Sorry not sorry?

**oliveoilgarlic** (5): god the 80’s are all over this rate in general. he gave us cheesy 1982 AC radio hit with 2018 drums and the exact chord changes from Do Me Baby on this one. I would like it more if not for the electric piano but it gets a 5 bc I do not generally like cheesy 1982 AC radio hits

**vayyiqra** (5): Please let me be patient with this album because this is boring as hell

**wavingwolves** (5): a little too smooth, if that can be a thing

**bulforster** (4): Really doesn't sound like you're giving her any reason to be dude.

**CritneySpearz** (4): hmm this kinda just sounds… immature? Compared to the rest of the album.. Idk the lyrical content just doesn't seem to be up to par

**Leixander** (4): I get the vibe but zzz...

**runaway3212** (4): It's pretty standard music wise, but I just hate the lyrics, you don't deserve continious love and support for just promising to one day be 'what you need'.

**jasannn** (3): Too Whiny

**nightjesus** (3): I mostly love Voicenotes but this song just does NOT do it for me. Like end chorus is nice but it takes so long to build up to it and it’s only ten seconds long.

**pat-rickstar** (3): The instrumental sounds like Memories by Maroon 5... ew.

One of the more fillery tracks on 24k Magic (if you had to pick filler), for many people this song feels like a watered down version of other tracks on this album. A very sensible placing for this song for sure

**fishingfor8** (9.3): Really underrated

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): Look I know almost all these songs on here are about sex, but this is one of the most on the nose lol. It’s a catchy bop for sure, but definitely one of the weaker songs on here.

**runaway3212** (10): I adore this song

**bespectacIed** (9): Very 80s/early 90s classic RnB. I love it

**sbuhj** (8.4): He's really tip-toeing the line between objectifying women on this album. Better lyrics would boost the scores of every song on this album except maybe 24K Magic. But this song has some of the best music.

**wardrum5** (8.2): I kinda hate his voice

**glencocoisrealmate** (8): l7

**rickikardashian** (8): Girl I bet your momma named you good lookin', 'cause you sure look good to me is the cheesiest shit I’ve ever heard

**1998tweety** (7.5): Alright

**pisces\_king** (7.3): Feels very MJ.

**fadedblue09** (7): I love the harmonies but it's not very memorable.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): we gonna have some fun tonight 🥴

**vayyiqra** (7): yet another horny bop

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): …”your booty deserves a celebration”

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6.8): the chorus really makes this whole song

**bbfan132** (6): a filler track on a 9 track album? interesting

**ggodisawomann** (6): fun live but studio leaves sumn to be desired

**ImADudeDuh** (6): oh i really like the RIGHT NOW! RIGHT NOW!

**wavingwolves** (6): do y'all ever think about how straight besides meaning right/even/true can also mean heterosexual and what the implications of that? yeah me neither!

**fix-ur-acrostics** (5): Usually when artists rip themselves off, it's not on the same album back-to-back.

**ManofOranges** (4): The one true dud on this album for me. It just doesn't do anything that excites me.

**skargardin** (4): Versace On The Floor did what this does but a thousand times better

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): i never really understood the role this track plays in the album. it sounds like a combination of every other song on the album with way too much going on

This song you either love it or hate it. This song is pretty much an entire acapella inspired track and although they all sound great, it’s not some people’s cup of tea and can be boring which is why its out today.

**fishingfor8** (9): This is definitely the most out of place song on this album but fuck it, I really like it. It’s all acapella with Boyz II Men how can you hate that.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I’m a sucker for acapella music, so I’m obliged to love this song. But even with that, I think this song is gorgeous and a wonderful collaboration between Boyz II Men and Charlie. The harmonies and stripped back nature of the song work so well with the lyrics.

**ariiaaaa** (10): harmonies are my shit yes pls

**fix-ur-acrostics** (10): Seeing Charlie Puth and Boyz II Men on the same track is doing fucked up things to my head.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Where have Pentatonix been? They used to be at every award show and now I feel like I barely hear their mediocre rendition of Hallelujah anymore.

**timothy444** (10): Pentatonix but if they had talent

**sbuhj** (9.5): It's a risk to bring Boyz II Men on an album of this style, but it pays off. This is reminiscent of the 90s yet somehow fits perfectly. Charlie fits in nicely with the boys, and honestly this song has to be the reason this album is titled Voicenotes.

**pisces\_king** (9): Harmonies, harmonies, harmonies. This hits deep.

**bespectacIed** (8): This is a gorgeous collab. All of em sounded heavenly

**ManofOranges** (8): Nice harmonies.

**runaway3212** (8): I adore the vocal performances by both artists

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): this is good but boyz ii men kinda sucks lol

**skargardin** (8): stellar

**1998tweety** (7.5): A cute acapella ballad, we stan.

**akanewasright** (7): Charlie is vocally outclassed here, but DAMN this song is nice.

**bigbigbee** (7): It’s SO pretty but I just don’t connect with it :(

**ggodisawomann** (7): I skip this pretty often but ngl I do appreciate it sometimes.

**Leixander** (7): AND I KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHINING DOWN ON ME FROM HEAVEN

**oliveoilgarlic** (7): H A R M O N I E S

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): Bruno spends multiple songs on his album doing impressions of Boyz II Men and Charlie just goes out and makes a song with them

**bbfan132** (6): sounds like a basic mariah carey ballad from the early 90s… it sounds fine but it’s bland

**nightjesus** (6): Charlie is very good with vocal stacking. It’s nice. But I would have like a ‘Motownphilly’ kinda like collab. The harmonies are beautiful though.

**piccprincess** (6): I love B2M and really love this song but it just doesn't do it for me anymore

**wavingwolves** (4): acapella is really not my thing but i love he got boyz ii men to hop on this

**sweetnsoursauce1** (3.5): i'll give it points for great vocals but boring af

**bulforster** (3): Yes Boyz II Men's harmonies are iconic but I do kind of expect a song to have more to it than just that.

**fadedblue09** (3): Collabing with such legends can be a hit or miss, and in his case, it backfired HARD. It really exposed my issues with his music: he is clearly the weakest link in his own songs, and he doesn't seem to 'own' this R&B sound.

**vayyiqra** (2): Really boring and needs a rhythm section; waste of vocal talent

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1): I don’t really care for the Boyz II Men inclusion or the constant snapping, it’s so cheesy.

**pat-rickstar** (0): Sorry but I found this really boring.

Something something “ed sheeran sucks” - popheads thoughts on this song. Joking aside, this song has major fans and major detractors. You either love the rock style of the track or hate it, or are just feeling confused.

**fishingfor8** (6): People really thought this was going to be a big hit.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I don’t think this song is bad but unfortunately it’s not my style at all. I appreciate that they all decided to try a rock style song, definitely an very unique collaboration.

**1998tweety** (10): I swear to God if y'all drag this just cause it's Ed Sheeran....this is unironically really good.

**fadedblue09** (10): Probably going out first (cause it’s Ed Sheeran duh), but Bruno was lowkey the highlight of this song anyway.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): AHHHHHHHHHHHHH YAS!!!!!!!! This was honestly way better than it had any right to be.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): not surprised this flopped but it does rock

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.7): this deserved to have more success

**CreepyMannequin** (7.5): kinda bops not gonna lie

**CritneySpearz** (7.5): wait why do I kinda like this, even though the lyrics are trash...

**kaanew** (7.5): is this the most ambitious crossover ever?? Either way, I’m pleasantly shocked.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): this is some extreme boomer rock cosplay from everyone involved but so is Harry Styles and ppl like him in this sub… idk I think this is actually fun

**ManofOranges** (7): If I were a betting man I would bet that this song is going to be last place in the bonus rate, not only because it's a rock song but also it's by Ed Sheeran. I don't think it's abysmal though. I'd love to see mother go before this one, but I really don't think it will.

**bbfan132** (6): i expected this to be awful but it wasn’t bad? didn’t really hear a lot of ed, thankfully

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): For a hard rock song, this could have been stronger.

**wavingwolves** (5): i... don't know what to rate this i'm baffled by this song

**pat-rickstar** (3.5): As a member of this sub I feel obliged to give this a low score because it's Ed Sheeran, and it's just a weird song.

**ggodisawomann** (3): I hate Ed Sheeran AND Chris Stapleton lmfao

**hunnybee12** (3): no :)

**skargardin** (3): i don't want to get reminded of this project

**PointlessBibliophage** (2): yes i hate men how could you tell

**vayyiqra** (2): hahahaha ginger satan bad amirite but also this sucks and belongs on alternative rock radio in the 90s

Here we have another song that is carried by our rated artist but feels dragged down by the other artists on the track. People were very split on their feelings for this song so this makes it one of the more controversial tracks.

**fishingfor8** (10): Lol okay this song is great.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Bruno honestly carries this song with his chorus. Gucci is fine and Kodak is a choice, so overall the song I wouldn’t rate as high as it would be if it was just Bruno (which is an easy 10).

**hunnybee12** (10): timeless bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a bop yas

**pisces\_king** (9.2): This chorus is near perfect. The 'Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!' is iconic.

**ManofOranges** (9): I totally forgot this song existed and I wish I didn't because I really like it!

**skargardin** (8): bop

**wavingwolves** (8): we vibing

**kaanew** (7.5): it can get a lil repetitive but I love this song

**nightjesus** (7.5): The keyboard synths are nice. The lyrics are very simple. But everything else is really nicely put together.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): I learned not to be surprised with Bruno's collabs. I mean, he literally sang "bubble butt, bubble butt, bubble butt".

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): Kodak Black ruining everything what a shock😍 Three points off just for him

**vayyiqra** (7): this is awful it's so cheesy I love it and hate at the same time it would make a good meme

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): fuck Kodak Black but the rest of this song is pretty good

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6.8): i forgot i didn't hate this song, the chorus is 10/10

**fix-ur-acrostics** (6): This is just Young, Wild, and Free but worse.

**piccprincess** (5): the only good thing about this is the hook

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Bruno Mars on trap is so BAD.

**ggodisawomann** (4): I was excited for this when it (quietly) came out and was sorely disappointed

**bbfan132** (3): this honestly doesn’t work at all imo, bruno sounds off here

**PointlessBibliophage** (3): i'm sorry but this just annoys me

**1998tweety** (1): Gross

**oliveoilgarlic** (1): fuck kodak young MA is shredded

Our last song out is the single Reminder. Although it was very popular when it came out, this song is not popheads cup of tea which is why it is the last song out day 1.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Once again, I think that the Weeknd’s rapping tracks are great and this is another one of those. Weeknd fans who love the pop side of him will probably find it boring a bit but I think this is a classic from this album.

**fishingfor8** (8.3): GODDAMN BITCH I"M NOT A TEENS CHOICE

**cremeebrulee** (11): one of my favorite weeknd songs ever! its a bragging song at its core but i like that its softer than other songs of that genre

**gannade** (11): got a sweet asian chick she go lo meinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

**hunnybee12** (10): the kids choice award line >

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): goddamn bitch I am not a teen choice never gets old king shit

**ManofOranges** (10): This one is really a standout for me. It's got a certain feel, a certain relaxing but enthralling sound that just makes me like it. There a definitely a few duds in this album for me, but if there's any song that acts as a reminder that there are some gems as well, it's this one.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Okay this album’s slowly picking up. It’s a bit straightforward R&B compared to the earlier tracks, but that’s exactly what I want.

**bespectacIed** (9): The remix really elevated the song but this is already very cute. That lo mein part iconic

**kaanew** (9): “Goddamn bitch, I am not a teen choice” is historic

**wardrum5** (8.6): "God damn bitch I am not a teen choice" and "Hannibal silence of the lambo"

**wavingwolves** (8.5): got that hannibal silence of the lambo? yes

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): L O M E I N

**skargardin** (8): I absolutely LOVE the chorus, it's so smooth and sexy

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): this loses almost a whole point for the lo mein line alone

**1998tweety** (7.5): She's vibey..cute

**oliveoilgarlic** (7): you always know he’s gonna try to tear somebody a new hairline when the first thing you hear is Trilogy synths

**rickikardashian** (7): who told abel the asian chick line was good?

**runaway3212** (7): Simple, but pretty effective

**vayyiqra** (7): pensive

**pisces\_king** (6.4): Slow and not in a fun way.

**Leixander** (6): He was almost a Teen Choice with all those nominations though!

**nightjesus** (6): The lyrics! Aight. But it’s still just not interesting enough? It’s still super repetitive.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): the remix is better

**ariiaaaa** (5.3): nice upbeat-y ballad

**bbfan132** (5): this is sooooo boring and apparently it was one of the biggest singles? idgi

**bulforster** (5): The airiness is soothing but the two-tone sing-rapping gets a bit grating.

**fix-ur-acrostics** (5): Well shit, there goes the momentum of the album!

**ggodisawomann** (5): he serves so much sleep for me with the non-singles

**sbuhj** (4.8): I'd never heard the whole album before this rate, but I did NOT expect so much mid-2000s R&B influence. Unfortunately this song sounds like he added annoying squeeks to a Confessions reject.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3.5): i forgot how cringey abel lines were after tbbtm ahaha

**ImADudeDuh** (3): the only sweet chick that goes Lo Mein that I know of is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWLhrHVySgA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWLhrHVySgA)
