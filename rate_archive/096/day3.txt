edit: idk why this got downvoted i only said one word with an emoji. i know my comment will keep getting downvoted out of spite. there‚Äôs a lot of good r&b albums by both men and women that aren‚Äôt in the mainstream eye. like you said that people on this sub don‚Äôt know much about r&b so they chose what‚Äôs in the mainstream rather than looking for more options. that‚Äôs all i‚Äôm saying. back to my original comment charlie puth is pop. not r&b. when you listen to r&b regularly you know that he‚Äôs more pop than r&b and doesn‚Äôt have the r&b sound üòê like damn do people not know about 6LACK???? Usher??? Trey Songz????? BRYSON TILLER!!!! come on now. the ppl i listed are both old and new in the r&b scene

Balladphobia strikes again! This was originally doing pretty good (it made the top 5 at once point) but overall some people do not like this song at all probably cause it‚Äôs a sexy ballad.

---

**fishingfor8** (10): most of those late 80s slow jams retro songs can be cheesy instead of sexy but I think this really doesn‚Äôt come across cheesy at all. It‚Äôs classy but still fun and exciting at the same time.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): As someone who prefers bops over ballads, this song was never one I came back to much. Revisiting it though, it‚Äôs an excellent ballad and it is so smooth but with 80‚Äôs production to keep it interesting. Bruno sounds great here and I definitely would like to continue to see more slower/ mid temp R&B songs like this from him.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): The way this is literally both the entire Asian continent's national anthem for like three straight years. Makes me pull my hair whenever I have to listen to this. I can sing this on my sleep. I probably have. I'm content to never hearing this again because I've heard this song played in every music medium available for humankind at least a thousand times. But this is iconic and brilliantly-sung

**fix-ur-acrostics** (10): How the hell did Bruno Mars make Save the Rainforest synths sound sexy?

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): I love a 80s ballad? Kinda the best ‚Äúmock 80s song‚Äù on the rate. Almost my 11, and I‚Äôm a rabid Weeknd stan lol so that‚Äôs saying a lot.

**jasannn** (10): One of the sexiest songs ever created.

**ManofOranges** (10): Okay I just straight up am enamored with this one. It's got a groove, it's got a vibe, it's the moment now come on now. This might actually be my favorite song on the album over 24K Magic or Finesse simply because, while those are upbeat and fun, this song does what it was meant to do so well. This could've easily gotten my 11.

**skargardin** (10): this has soundtracked many of my late night drives oop

**TragicKingdom1** (10): this deserved a remix with female vocals so much UGH!

**wavingwolves** (10): i love everything about this

**oliveoilgarlic** (9): ok fuck you i love slow 80‚Äôs r&b

**timothy444** (9): The David Guetta remix is better but whatever

**sbuhj** (8.9): I like this song because it ended That's What I Like - both on the album and on the radio. The lyrics are unnecessarily explicit, but this is the most soulful song on the album and it gives me feels.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Zendaya ate this video up.

**bigbigbee** (8.5): One particular line docked this a half point for me: I just can‚Äôt stand ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just kiss ‚Äòtil we‚Äôre naked‚Äù.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): This is a generous score considering how my country overplays this song to death.

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): This is actually pretty sexy.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): i forgot how good bruno sounds on this. too bad the lyrics are dumb

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): this is a great ballad and i'm glad it got radio play in australia

**akanewasright** (8): I docked a point for the straining and another for some of the lyrics, but yeah, this is easily one of the best from the album.

**bbfan132** (8): i love how smooth this is! the intro is my favorite part for sure

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I really liked the throwback vibe of this. I feel like I need to be in a certain mood for me to listen to this song a couple of times though.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): he does not have the best voice for this but its still a bop

**ggodisawomann** (7.5): okay we love a slow sex bop

**jackisboredtoday** (7): the Boyz II Men influence is STRONG and I love that an old-school slow jam like this was on the radio in 2017

**Leixander** (7): rich people goals

**vayyiqra** (7): cheesy 80s ballads are the best

**runaway3212** (6.5): Just a tad too slow

**gannade** (0): absolutely awful. sex music for missionary position only

**pisces\_king** (0): No.

A fan favourite song, this made day 3 towards the end (although it almost missed it). This upbeat song was a nice change of pace for everyone although some people found a bit messy. 
---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a massively underrated bop. This was definitely a standout the first time I heard it and I still think it‚Äôs one of the best.

**fishingfor8** (8): I love this song, however the production on this is a major flaw and it's a mess. I still like it but the production is too glaring for me to let it go.

---

**1998tweety** (11): Hold awn...this is so vibey I was not expecting something this GOOD. I shouldn't be surprised considering this song is named after my good friend TheRokinRolla.

**piccprincess** (11): /u/therokinrolla

**bespectacIed** (10): The synths hello??? I am a simple fag, I hear synth pads, I ascend to a higher dimension. This is a vampire rave banger, this should be on the Blade remake

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I have a bad feeling this song is going out on the first day. If it does, this subreddit has no taste cause this is literally a Max Martin bop.

**hikkaru** (10): underrated bop

**wavingwolves** (10): great grinding music

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): wtf a bop

**pisces\_king** (9.2): The disco fantasy... this is such a hit. One of my favorites from his entire discography.

**Leixander** (9): Max Martin magic. I would love this more without the awkward sounding verse after the first chorus.

**nightjesus** (9): YES ABEL. SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

**skargardin** (9): boppy

**bbfan132** (8.5): a total bop, i wish more of the album was like this

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): A bop but I'm not really sure what the lyrics are about?

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): abel sounds so good on dance beats i-

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): the hook is kinda weak but that second verse is perfection

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.3): if this song doesn't make you want to dance you're lying

**ariiaaaa** (8.2): I absolutely love the synth and the rhythm and the jazz vibes here

**akanewasright** (8): GOD I love Max and Able as a team

**fix-ur-acrostics** (8): Does not remotely rock, but still pretty damn good.

**oliveoilgarlic** (8): as someone who regularly gets called a fuckboy I could not agree more

**vayyiqra** (8): This swung groove absolutely fucks and I need more of this retro sound

**ggodisawomann** (7.5): the synths in this are nice and this is a vibe tbh

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.5): bass has entered the chat

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): theRockin‚Äôrolla

**runaway3212** (7.5): I love how this song sounds in some parts, but other parts are a bit tiring

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): f

**fadedblue09** (7): A decent club banger, but I think it could‚Äôve been better. The song itself seems so flat for some reason.

**hunnybee12** (7): there‚Äôs just too much going on it‚Äôs overwhelming. Secrets is the same song but cleaner and catchier, no need for both

**ManofOranges** (7): It's got nice production (although, what songs on this album don't?) and that's pretty much all I have to say.

**bulforster** (6.5): I like these dance-y instrumentals but Abel doesn't seem to be able to find his footing over them that well.

**sbuhj** (6.5): Had potential, but the production was messy. It sounds like a failed attempt to mimick Daft Punk's style. I expect more from Max Martin. I gave my score a slight boost for Abel's varied vocal timbre.

A deep cut from the Weeknd‚Äôs album, we were both surprised but happy this song made it this high. It‚Äôs generic yet familiar and this song being here further proves that popheads loves the pop Weeknd more than anything.
---

**fishingfor8** (8.5): Bumbambumbamump

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This song and Love to Lay I could basically write the same comment for; pop filler that bops enough for me to like it but weaker compared to many other tracks here.

---

**plastichaxan** (11): idc if this gets eliminated before time it feels right to give it my 11

**1998tweety** (10): Immaculate, love the production.

**ariiaaaa** (10): YES

**ggodisawomann** (10): thanks to yetti for showing me this banger

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the production on this album is so interesting

**Leixander** (10): Obligatory "MJ is that you?".

**ManofOranges** (10): A more upbeat song, I'm digging it.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): bop

**wavingwolves** (10): yes! yes! yes!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I love it when Daddy Abel emulates his idol.

**jasannn** (9): These are the funky vibes that I came here for and it gets even better as the song goes on.

**runaway3212** (9): He sounds like MJ here at some points and that's definitly a good thing.

**sbuhj** (9): This is fun. I wanted more of this from the album. If you're gonna rip off Daft Punk, do it this way.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.3): his is one of the only Weeknd songs that ACTUALLY gives me Michael Jackson vibes. It‚Äôs super bubbly and catchy.

**bbfan132** (8): i love exploring random songs that i end up enjoying a lot - kind of one-note but i really liked the disco vibes here

**bespectacIed** (8): michael jackson bop

**fadedblue09** (8): Sounds like a watered-down version of the previous track but it‚Äôs not too bad.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): possibly the most MJ-derivative abel has ever been? (which is ironic because he was sued by someone else over this song lol)

**vayyiqra** (8): [2]

**pisces\_king** (7.7): Also fun.

**oliveoilgarlic** (7.5): is it just me that actually loves this?

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): catchy af beat

**bulforster** (6): B-tier Michael Jackson impression.

**nightjesus** (6): the heavy synth bass has be boppin. But look I‚Äôm not loving the bridge.

Our second Charlie scrapped album cut lands here. Looks like everyone had similar feelings about all the songs from him.
---

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): it‚Äôs decent but why the high school topic when you are 20 something years old? This might have been a bigger hit than I Warned Myself if that came out first but it definitely played compared to most of Voicenotes.

**fishingfor8** (2): I‚Äôve ranted about this song 2 or three times now but omg these lyrics are atrocious. You‚Äôre not a teenager Charlie, you‚Äôre in your mid 20s and you live in LA. Stop de-maturing (is that even a word?)

---

**ggodisawomann** (10): people shit on this but I love it! the opening notes are so catchy!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): The one song worth saving from this weird ass era. Charlie said ‚ÄúYour mom doesn‚Äôt know that we fo anal‚Äù and made it a fun bop.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): stream abba - does your mother know

**pisces\_king** (8.7): Really solid, though a little bit like frat boy who is good with moms? Drums are pounding but it works in this song very well.

**1998tweety** (8): Daddy singing a song about mommy huh

**kaanew** (7): a solid bop

**wavingwolves** (7): interesting

**TiltControls** (6): 1 for lyrics 10 for production

**vayyiqra** (6): weird lyrics but it bops so whatever

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): the lyrics and melody here feel real incongruent? It feels way too cheery for the lyrics and it gives the whole song a weird feeling i don‚Äôt like it

**nightjesus** (5): It kinda sounds like something that would be on Nine Track Mind. It‚Äôs okay. But it‚Äôs super safe. I can for sure hear Ryan Tedder‚Äôs influence.

**rotating3Dtext** (5): the lyrics are.. uh, ok

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Slightly bops better than the last, but it still makes me cringe for some reason. God, these songs are such a chore.

**bbfan132** (4): come up with something new

**rickikardashian** (4): the instrumental and production is trying the best to carry the song but these lyrics are the lamest shit I've ever heard

**fix-ur-acrostics** (3): Charlie Puth has shown that he can sound like a badass before, so why does a song explicitly about that sound so lifeless?

**skargardin** (2): charlie playing the bad boy.. i have to laugh

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1): I really don‚Äôt like this. It feels rushed  and it‚Äôs just so cliche? Also I don‚Äôt believe genuinely anyone‚Äôs dad is mad at Charlie Puth üò∂

**ManofOranges** (1): I hate this one. To me it just screams like "Yeah we have sex!" and I just roll my eyes so hard at it. Hard pass.

So somehow this was the highest out of all of Charlie‚Äôs scrapped singles. It‚Äôs probably cause most people didn‚Äôt hear it until now and were surprised it wasn‚Äôt awful (or at least I was). But overall everyone agrees that this was not the direction he should take and that we were getting bored of the same schtick but one that is less polished from him.
---

**ignitethephoenix** (7): This has potential to be better but something feels like it‚Äôs missing in the song.

**fishingfor8** (4): You can‚Äôt tell me that Charlie didn‚Äôt cheat on his gf, despite what the single cover says

---

**ggodisawomann** (10): this was my least fav of these 3 singles for a while but it grew HARD. Charlie's music style is really just...me. it's very much my kind of pop in every way and if you asked me to try to find things to dislike about it, I just...I can't.

**ManofOranges** (10): Absolutely delectable to the ear. Also it kinda sends me the way the cover for the single is Charlie admitting this song is based around something he's never felt.

**pisces\_king** (10): From the very first second I knew the first listen I would love this song and it has somehow not gotten old despite me having played it so often.

**bespectacIed** (8): the long note was cute

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Kinda funny that he had to make a disclaimer as a cover art just to tell people "THIS SONG IS NOT ABOUT CHEATING".

**nightjesus** (8): This isn‚Äôt that bad. I haven‚Äôt even heard it before. Oh god I wonder if his hair had something the lack of success. It‚Äôs a looooook. The end is cute. I‚Äôm sad this didn‚Äôt do well.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): the single artwork for this is iconic

**1998tweety** (7): Alright

**bbfan132** (7): i heard bad things about it but i didn‚Äôt mind it at all, kind of basic but it sounded nice

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): the single cover being a whole-ass disclaimer when the song isn‚Äôt even actually about cheating‚Ä¶ he really got scared by this song like How Long wasn‚Äôt his previous single huh

**letsallpoo** (5): the trap production sounds really out of place

**skargardin** (5): I can't get over this HORRENDOUS cover art good god

**vayyiqra** (5): this is okay but why is he so fixated on women's mothers these lyrics are weird

**wavingwolves** (5): okay but why the cover of this song is just a black background with "this song is not about a person, it's about a feeling i've never had" written on it? he's explaining himself and for what

**pat-rickstar** (4.5): How many songs about cheating does this man have?

**ImADudeDuh** (4): idk what ‚Äúno homo‚Äù for cheating is, but this cover art is my candidate.

**kaanew** (4): very underwhelming

**oliveoilgarlic** (4): I said STOP making the early 80‚Äôs AC ballads not put trap beats on them

**fix-ur-acrostics** (3): Okay, Charlie, you were already walking a fine line doing all the R&B stuff, you should absolutely come nowhere close to trap.

**fadedblue09** (1): Great, now he‚Äôs the one doing the cheating lol. Still as try-hard and cringy as ever.

Bruno‚Äôs biggest hit is the first song out of the top 10. I think most people were sick of how overplayed it was which is why it lands here. 
---

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I definitely get why this song went #1. This song highlights Bruno singing and overall vibe super well, and it‚Äôs a good blend catchy and sensual.

**fishingfor8** (7.4): How overplayed it was probably drags down the final score for me but i‚Äôm normally pretty strict on songs so a 7.4 isn‚Äôt bad.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): So fucking iconic. Also, so fucking **LOCAL** lol this is really the definition of a local song. This album deserved more number 1s other than this one.

**drewbarrymore2** (10): Julio, serve that scampi!!!!!

**followingfreeways** (10): i fucking LOVE this song its so fun i dont care if it was overplayed i will sing this every single time it comes on bitch!!!

**jasannn** (10): Another song of the summer 2017 even though the album was out for months.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): i say this too much but theory-wise the prechorus melody (jump in the cadillac) is one of the greatest moments in songwriting this decade

**skargardin** (10): the bops don't stop coming

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): another whole bop

**fadedblue09** (9.8): Ugh I wanna hate this for overplay but it's just so irresistibly catchy. I don't endorse the message of "sex by the fire" though.

**1998tweety** (9): I didn't like this at first but it was a huge grower.

**akanewasright** (9): This might be the one song from the album that I wouldn‚Äôt mind winning.

**bigbigbee** (9): People are going to mention that Youtube Poop ‚ÄúJump in the CAAC‚Äù. I was really burned out on this song‚Ä¶and then I watched that video, and now I can listen to this again. I can‚Äôt explain it. Power of humor.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I loved the Spider-Man parody version of the music video!

**gannade** (9): he snappt on this one

**pat-rickstar** (9): Slightly overrated? I still like it though.

**piccprincess** (9): pop it for me

**runaway3212** (9): Amazing

**timothy444** (9): Hated this at first but grown to love it!

**bbfan132** (8.5): a total bop but it was overplayed at one point

**pisces\_king** (8.1): Certainly a hit.

**ManofOranges** (8): This song is what I like, but it's not what I love.

**oliveoilgarlic** (8): you know he had to do it to em

**vayyiqra** (8): chad energy bop

**wavingwolves** (8): "you can be my freaka girl 'll be a fleeko mamacita" noooo stop bruno please

**ggodisawomann** (7.5): good but not as good as the radio wants you to believe

**hunnybee12** (7): it was so overplayed at the time & not enough time has passed for me to be able to appreciate it again sadly

**Leixander** (7): this was nice for a hot minute, then it got overplayed to a point where I wince whenever I hear the first few seconds

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I really don‚Äôt care for this song

**wardrum5** (5.5): Maybe because I heard it so much on the radio, but I have a hatred for this song. I can't call it bad though because it's not.

**sbuhj** (4.9): Terrible transition from Perm - wow. This song is not what I like. I never have, and having it played on the radio every 30 minutes for what felt like an entire year only made it worse. The bridge is the only good part of the song.

**PointlessBibliophage** (4): but unfortunately i don't byeeeeeeee

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): My controversial dislike üò∂ Not the worst song on this rate, but I find it boring, especially compared to everything else on this album. It‚Äôs just a little too douchey for me?

This song was almost out of the top 10 however it climbed nicely up to #9 towards the end. Some people find this song lyrically cheesy however the riff and chorus are infectious enough for it to land here.
---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): The first few submissions called this a bit corny (which it is) but Charlie pulls it off well here and I think the chorus is one of my favourites from this album.

**fishingfor8** (8): The song is good, but I really hate self empowerment anthems, even when done right. And some of the wording is kind of awkward.

---

**ariiaaaa** (11): THAT GUITAR RIFF IS A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE HELLO?!

**bigbigbee** (10): What an opening to an album! From the first riff, it feels like an announcement. Love the beat, too. I almost docked a point for the plain lyrics, but I gave it back when I thought about how much I enjoy the song.

**ggodisawomann** (10): deserved to smash

**ManofOranges** (10): It's a nice opener. Honestly compared to some other tracks in the album it's not legendary or anything but I still really like it.

**timothy444** (10): Perfect song but this reminds me way too much of the My Hero Academia OP in the first half of the second season. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7w5IMyJ3pM Seriously, every time I watch that show and this comes on I think of that Charlie Puth album starter and although both are bops, I prefer Charlie Puth mainly because it serves a better purpose of establishing just how perfect Voicenotes of an album over some kids fighting in some stupid sports tournament. Anyways, nuff said this song bangs!

**1998tweety** (9): Bop

**bespectacIed** (9): This is really sweet and nostalgic and it made me happy so I i'm giving a good score. But charlie's lyrics are very stepped up shawn mendes, I hope the rest of the album won't be. (spoiler, it kinda is)

**nightjesus** (9): This song is a B O P. The production is C R I S P. Vocals are great. The bridge is just A+.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): why does this sound like he's coming out

**pisces\_king** (8.8): Moody bass, shows off his range very well in a controlled way. Very smooth, effective track.

**sbuhj** (8.7): Full disclosure - I love this album. I own the CD. But for the sake of fairness, I'm listening to it from my computer speakers on the same Spotify playlist. This song sets the tone of the album right away. This is no Nine Track Mind. This is the way he really is and, hate it or love it, that's okay.

**bbfan132** (8.5): idk if this fits as an opener but i still enjoyed it a lot - he might be one of the artists who has improved the most recently

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): the riff carries the song but that's not a bad thing

**drewbarrymore2** (8): This corny ass mf...gotta love him tho

**fadedblue09** (8): Hmm...Ingrid Michaelson is unbothered. Wish the hook was as strong as the verses, but otherwise a decent opener.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): really appreciate Charlie's smooth vocals here damn

**wavingwolves** (8): yeah this goes off

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): Still confused lyrically, but its a bop production wise.

**runaway3212** (7.5): Never really understood the hype around this one, but it's still pretty good.

**akanewasright** (7): This song doesn‚Äôt deserve my love. But it has it anyway.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): the bassline sounds kinda corny?

**skargardin** (7): boppy if a lil corny lyricism

**fix-ur-acrostics** (6): It's got potential, but it's a bit too scattered for my taste.

**vayyiqra** (6): this is okay

**bulforster** (5): I like the groove the chorus gets into but the verses and that guitar line are jarringly rigid.

**followingfreeways** (5): i love this album but this just isnt a good opener imo..... like i understand why he used it but also i dont like this song

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): I feel like the whole song feels rushed (like speed wise) especially the verses which are are like way too fast.

The Cruel Summer of Voicenotes, this deep cut is a fan favourite for multiple reasons. It should have been a single and is one of the grooviest tracks here. Both of us are happy this managed to place in the top 10 as we think it‚Äôs sort of underrated overall. 
---

**fishingfor8** (11): This song is perfect

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is one of the best (if not the best) song on the album. The production is so groovy (again) and the vocoder effect in the background adds so much to the song. This is pop excellence and I hope everyone recognizes that!

---

**followingfreeways** (11): i cant explain it im just obsessed with this song and have been since the first time i heard it. the production, the lyrics, i just love it so much

**ggodisawomann** (11): easily the best song in this rate from a pop perfection standpoint. this should've been the next single instead of The Way I Am imo, and the lyrical switch up from girl -> boy is just...yes. yes. yes.yes yse.sy.se.y.

**TiltControls** (11): These 3 albums are very production-strong - the songs are often slick, cool, and polished. But I think if any song were to exhibit these traits best it's this one. Every part about it is fantastic

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This should've been a single cause wow this is too damn catchy.

**hikkaru** (10): should have been a single

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): Charlie Puth = Main Pop Boy?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Charlie said ‚Äúcalm your pussy down!‚Äù and he‚Äôs right!

**ManofOranges** (10): It seems that songs called Slow It Down just cannot disappoint.

**runaway3212** (10): Fun fact: I accidentally Pavloved myself into feeling anxious by listening to this song and I hate that because it's one of my favourite songs on the album

**skargardin** (10): jam!!

**sbuhj** (9.6): Somehow I believe this more than I believe LA Girls. This is the first instance where I feel like the sexual innuendos work for Charlie, and it works well.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Big bop, love the chorus.

**fadedblue09** (9): Whew the saving grace of this boring mess of an album. Not quite original, but you have to take what you can get.

**pat-rickstar** (9): Single material.

**piccprincess** (9): Charlie: slow it down / This song: Goes fast

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.8): a whole bop

**bbfan132** (8.5): i forgot about this song but i understand why i‚Äôve scrobbled it 28 times now - it‚Äôs not the most groundbreaking song out there but it‚Äôs effortlessly catchy and fun to listen to

**pisces\_king** (8.4): Back to sexy again. The chorus leaves something to be desired, which is disappointing because the verses are so good. Chorus is decent but doesn't make me go crazy.

**bespectacIed** (8): A song about taking it slow with a girl younger than him RIGHT AFTER a song about wanting his older lover to take him seriously, that's range! Vers king

**nightjesus** (8): The second verse damn Charlie ayyy. But again the production is crisp. It‚Äôs just a solid pop song.

**bigbigbee** (7.5): The lyrics dock this a full point for me, lol. LOVE the soaring instrumentals.

**Leixander** (7.5): This is a complete reversal of the previous song lmao. Kinda love him more for the audacity.

**akanewasright** (7): I really hate the ‚Äúoh no, I can‚Äôt control myself around this girl‚Äù trope, but the production on this is so silky smooth, I can‚Äôt resist.

**oliveoilgarlic** (7): 2008 radio/better now youtube 80s cover teas but the chorus is quality

**rotating3Dtext** (7): this is the reverse of BOY

**vayyiqra** (6): This is like a Discovery-era Daft Punk song but mid

So at the beginning of this rate, the song was winning it all and we were convinced it would stay in the top 2. However the genuine haters came along and it fell all the way to 7. Some of those people prefer Uptown Funk but others are just sick of Bruno‚Äôs throwback schtick overall. 
---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): The moment I first heard this song, I knew it would be a hit instantly. The build up in the pre chorus and chorus are immaculate and it‚Äôs still such a bop to this day. It hasn‚Äôt aged one bit and it will forever go off at parties.

**fishingfor8** (9): definitely the most iconic song on this list. Even though That‚Äôs What I Like had more commercial success this song definitely is the track that will be remembered.

---

**fadedblue09** (11): This track is the perfect representation of the album's mix of modern and throwback elements. You know a song is just that good when Kendrick uses it as a sample.

**fix-ur-acrostics** (11): This was actually one of the first songs that made me think 'Hey, maybe not all pop music is formulaic garbage!' so 11 it is.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): much better than uptown funk and one of my favorite songs of the decade. the vocoder and glittery synths are immaculate

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic, legendaric.

**ggodisawomann** (10): I put my pinky ring up to the moon every time I hear this

**hikkaru** (10): i don't know a more fun song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is the only song that says ‚Äú#Blessed‚Äù that deserves rights.

**ManofOranges** (10): Just an incredibly fun song. It's almost confusing how addictive and enjoyable it is.

**oliveoilgarlic** (10): picture this. you and your friends are all headed into a big city on a crisp Friday night in the fall. the plan is to hit a fancy dinner party and then stay out dancing till some ungodly hour of the morning. everyone is looking their absolute best, cocktail dresses and flashy suits, hair and makeup done to perfection, gold jewelry everywhere. you‚Äôre SO ready for whatever adventures come your way between now and when the sun comes up. that‚Äôs this song

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i must begrudgingly admit that this song deserves a 10

**rickikardashian** (10): if this or the finesse remix aren't the highest Bruno songs√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ jail

**runaway3212** (10): This song is an attempt to recreate Uptown Funk and I'm completly okay with that.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this is such a great comeback song

**skargardin** (10): such a CLASSIC

**wavingwolves** (10): this is one of the most enjoyable songs i know

**rotating3Dtext** (9.8): hashtag blessed

**hunnybee12** (9.5): a very obvious uptown funk remake. good thing i love uptown funk

**jasannn** (9.5): Uptown Funk 2.0

**pisces\_king** (9.1): Yep, this is it. This is so much fun. Yes.

**bbfan132** (9): this is awesome but some of the lyrics are cringy lol - i would probably give it a 9.5 if ‚Äúhashtag blessed‚Äù wasn‚Äôt there

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): Uptown Funks, better glittery younger brother. This song is just fucking cool.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): idc what anyone says this was a great lead single

**timothy444** (9): I swear Bruno Mars gets better with each album.

**wardrum5** (9): Why did I think I hated this? Maybe it was too overplayed

**sbuhj** (8.7): I guess this is what I expected after Uptown Funk. As a proud owner of Bruno's first two albums, this is not what I wanted. But hey, this song is pretty good. It's fun, good music, and doesn't feel braggadocious like a lot of the others.

**bigbigbee** (8): It‚Äôs hard for me to rate this because I heard it SO MUCH I can‚Äôt enjoy it anymore. At the same time, I do remember liking it a lot.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Uptown Funk's more egotistical, annoying younger brother. This is still a bop tho!

**nightjesus** (8): It‚Äôs an opener. It get you pumped. It‚Äôs time for Bruno magic.

**piccprincess** (8): what does putting your pinky finger up do? i never found out

**vayyiqra** (8): What a good intro it's such a goofy and fun bop and the synth line in the prechorus is great

**followingfreeways** (7): does it bop? yes. was it played at every single sports game and dance my senior year of high school? yes. am i sick of it now? guess

**bespectacIed** (5): I love bruno but let's not pretend that this release was universally loved. I personally hated this and I know many people became wary of Bruno's musical direction for the new album with this lead. Thank god the rest of the album pulled through, because this is lowkey trash except the chorus

**akanewasright** (3): I hate this song. It‚Äôs well produced and the verses carry a lot of it, but that chorus just feels so goddamn lazy to me.

**gannade** (2): everybody- streams uptown funk. bruno- but how can i make it bad?

**jackisboredtoday** (2): I never liked this song even when it was brand-new. It‚Äôs Uptown Funk with literally all the charm and groove sucked out of it. The hook feels overstuffed and tuneless and the verses feel like they‚Äôre trying so hard to seem effortless and it shows through. The only reason this score isn‚Äôt a 0 is that it gave us Kendrick and Rihanna‚Äôs Loyalty

**CreepyMannequin** (1): I‚Äôm the ugly ass friend.

Another fantastic boppy track from Charlie that the majority of people agree is one of his best. It‚Äôs not as iconic as some of the other songs in the rate however, which leaves it at a respectable spot. 
---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): For some reason this has never been my favourite single from the album, but listening to it again it‚Äôs an excellent song and definitely one of the strongest here. This song plays to all his strengths and has his strongest storytelling for sure.

**fishingfor8** (7.5): I like how it switches narratives for the pre-chorus and chorus and then switches back to Charlie. It‚Äôs just not as impactful as some of the other songs on this album

---

**letsallpoo** (11): i get called...white man's whore

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop

**drewbarrymore2** (10): I maintain that this sounds like doula peep's break my heart

**ggodisawomann** (10): I almost gave this my 11. really. the first time I heard this magnificent piece of pop perfection...I knew it was lover. the music video is, well, interesting, but this song is IT.

**hikkaru** (10): obviously attention slaps but this was the song that solidified charlie's redemption arc for me, certified BANGER

**ImADudeDuh** (10): when i forget to tell the subway sandwich worker if I want a 6 in or a footlong after explaining what sandwich i want

**kaanew** (10): honestly iconic

**Leixander** (10): I do wonder... jk kimora xox

**ManofOranges** (10): Yet another song that is just too damn good. I also just really love Charlie's vocals here, among other songs.

**pat-rickstar** (10): The final chorus is sooo good.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): possibly his best

**rickikardashian** (10): the first sign that attention wasnt a fluke and charlie indeed was an artist worthwhile

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): hehe long

**timothy444** (10): How long is this song? Clearly not long enough because I can't get enough of this bop! Daddy Puth does it again!

**pisces\_king** (9.6): Again, sexy, sexy bass. Holding that high note with harmony towards the end of the track? Golden.

**sbuhj** (9.3): Not as attention-grabbing as Attention (no pun intended), but the better song.

**fix-ur-acrostics** (9): It's really weird to me that this was the big single after Attention. 'Yeah bitch, you just want attention! Also, I'm sorry I cheated on you, please take me back'

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): I‚Äôve only heard this song on radio and it‚Äôs better/groovier in headphones? Fun.

**jasannn** (9): How Long ran so Break My Heart could run.

**akanewasright** (8.9): This is the lesser of the ‚ÄúAttention‚Äù trilogy, imo, but this is still a phenomenal song.

**bulforster** (8.5): The inflexibilty that holds him back on some of the other songs is actually working in his favour here.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): good song, but i've always found a knock off of attention. But considering Attention is amazing i'll take it

**bbfan132** (8): one-note but a fun listen

**bespectacIed** (8): Basing on Charlie's whiny songs, I am guessing 4 1/2 inches

**wavingwolves** (8): sounds like a fuckboy anthem but it's still a enjoyable one

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): Vampire Weekend‚Äôs How Long outsold but this is good

**bigbigbee** (7): Great verse and pre-chorus, boring chorus.

**nightjesus** (7): Not as strong as the others but it‚Äôs still pretty punchy and the pre chorus is still really wrong in song as well. Charlie‚Äôs definitely vocally talented with that strong ending to the bridge.

**runaway3212** (7): Not the best, but the base saves it.

**skargardin** (7): :flushed:

**TragicKingdom1** (7): basically attention 2.0 but catchier

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Love the funky guitar but again, another underwhelming song.

**vayyiqra** (6): kinda bops idk

Our second highest bonus song is this! The top 2 bonus song scores were miles ahead of the other bonus songs (i will apologize for putting anyone else who did the bonus rate through the rest of that). But most people agreed the Weeknd sounds great over Disclosure production however they song felt too long and simple for some
---

**fishingfor8** (10): Disclosure really has made some amazing songs with pop singers. I also love their songs with Sam Smith and Lorde.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this is excellence! I really want them to collaborate more as The Weeknd sounds amazing here, especially over their production.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Excellent

**skargardin** (10): the beat here is everything. I like it way more than some of the Starboy cuts

**pisces\_king** (9.5): I am obsessed with this song. This whole album is definitely worth some revisiting but this is a banger. The Miguel track is also fantastic.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): caracal was an underrated album

**fadedblue09** (9): Wow this is better than some of the dance-pop bangers on Starboy.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): oh this slaps

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): love this. Caracal‚Äôs singles were consistently great

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.8): i am not a fan of songs over 6 minutes but damn does this slap!

**kaanew** (8.5): I‚Äôve been missing out on this banger ohmygod

**bespectacIed** (8): bop. but can I just say how disappointing a followup Caracal was to Settle

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Phew Disclosure and Abel FUCKING DID that.

**ggodisawomann** (8): this is good

**oliveoilgarlic** (8): r/outrun time to shine

**vayyiqra** (8): disclosure good and this good

**nightjesus** (7.5): this was a lot more interesting to listen too then most things on Starboy and it‚Äôs like 7 minutes long.

**TiltControls** (6.5): Good, but could have easily been cut in half

**bbfan132** (6): this was nearly 7 minutes long and i don‚Äôt remember anything about it except for abel saying ‚Äúnocturnal‚Äù constantly

**wavingwolves** (5): i guess this exists

**ManofOranges** (3): Between this song and Magnets I just don't think Disclosure is for me. The songs are just too boring!

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1): The production is kinda not good? It‚Äôs too loud and makes him sound really muffled but like not in a good way. also this is long af.

And here we have our bonus rate winner! Both of us really thought Nocturnal would win however the length of that song affected its scores, which left this as the winner and the most liked bonus song. 
---

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): so when I originally came up with the bonus rate I just had Charlie‚Äôs scrapped project songs which were all mediocre however this came out just before I had to put the post up. And I was immediately hooked when I first heard it. A perfect summer song and also better than his other bonus songs here and you guys deserve to hear it so you have hope again in Charlie.

**fishingfor8** (8): I hadn‚Äôt‚Äô listened to this song until we were looking for songs to fill the bonus rate and I honestly like it

---

**1998tweety** (10): I love my friend NapsAndNetflix, I'm happy for him when good things happen to him.

**ManofOranges** (10): I'm not gonna beat around the bush. I love this. The fact that this is a song for a Scooby Doo movie soundtrack makes me laugh so hard but I'm not at all surprised. In my experience Scooby Doo just for some reason always has really good songs attached to it. Look at the hex girls songs! Or better yet, look at the soundtracks for the live actions movies. They're literally immaculate. So this song is really just par for the course.

**piccprincess** (10): I WOULD LITERALLY DO ANYTHING FOR LENNON I S2G WOMAN

**turtle-thief** (10): This song has no right being that good.

**pisces\_king** (9.2): I think this song is so undeniably catchy. This could not be more obvious or basic but this song does feel very summer!!!! I like it very much.

**bespectacIed** (9): this is nice and groovy. I don't know this girl but i am now looking üëÄ

**oliveoilgarlic** (9): this song makes me wanna roll down Ocean Drive in a cherry red convertible at dusk when the sidewalks are full and the neon signs are starting to come on and I‚Äôve never even been to Florida

**fadedblue09** (8): That moment when a kids‚Äô movie soundtrack is better than most of your album.

**fix-ur-acrostics** (8): A song for a Scooby-Doo movie? Now THAT's the Charlie Puth I know!

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): Scooby do be having bops üòç

**pat-rickstar** (8): I could take this song more seriously if it wasn't from a Scooby Doo movie.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): charlie really comes through with his duets

**vayyiqra** (7.5): this fucks

**kaanew** (7): a cute lil duo bop!

**nightjesus** (7): It‚Äôs a cute lil bop.

**skargardin** (7): this does bop

**wavingwolves** (7): wait there's a new scooby doo movie? and yeah this is fun and definitely feels like a soundtrack

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): this sounds fine but i‚Äôve heard it like 5 times now and i‚Äôve never retained a single note of it once the song is over

**bbfan132** (6): i have no thoughts on this

One of the least controversial tracks in the rate, many people think Charlie and Kelhani have great chemistry and that this track is one of the highlights of the album. A few people are wanting a bit more however, but the consensus is good.
---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Look I love Attention as much as everyone else who is a fan, but this song was always my favourite single and should have been as successful as Attention. It‚Äôs so groovy and Kehlani and him have very good vocal chemistry.

**fishingfor8** (8.8): The throwback vibe on the album is probably the strongest on this song. Kehlani is great and they have good chemistry.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Best song on the album, the way they both killed this. Kehlani is usually meh but she does well on other people's songs.

**akanewasright** (10): Pop perfection

**bespectacIed** (10): The song that made me realize popheads isn't being ironic with its sudden stabbing for charlie. This is fantastic. Great vocals and chemistry from both. Shaggy, messy haired charlie kinda made points to my loins

**ggodisawomann** (10): one of the only good things Kehlani has done since SSS! love this song

**hikkaru** (10): kehlani ate

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Her best feature

**kaanew** (10): a collab for the ages that‚Äôs always on repeat

**ManofOranges** (10): In spite of me loving attention a lot, this song is actually the one that inspired me to listen to this album in the first place. The duet here is just immaculate to me. Also shout out to the video, which also is just so good.

**oliveoilgarlic** (10): stream Kehlani‚Äôs entire discography

**pisces\_king** (10): This collab with Kehlani works. So. Well. I love it so much. The intro is incredible, bass is again giving us everything we asked for and more. Their interweaving adlibs at the end are chef's kiss.

**runaway3212** (10): Absolutely devine

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): greatest collab of 2018

**skargardin** (10): the way i mostly like kehlani on her features

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): we stan a video about bisexuality and Kehlani compliments Charlie beautifully

**timothy444** (10): It amazes me how every song that Kehlani is featured in is guaranteed to be amazing af. We had her in the girl on girl anthem What I Need, the only good Zedd song that was released last year Good Thing, but this song with Charlie "Perfect Pitch" Puth has got to be the best out of her collaborations. It's disco, it's nostalgic but the two voices together put together a fresh take on the duet. It's a masterpiece and it should've charted much higher everywhere!

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): A bop.

**sbuhj** (9.5): This is one of the best songs on the album. Kehlani is the perfect addition, and adds nice female balance. It's this album's We Don't Talk Anymore, and it lives up to its predecessor.

**bbfan132** (9): probably his best song, he should make more smooth synth funk tracks (kehlani is great here too!)

**hunnybee12** (9): kehlani kills

**TragicKingdom1** (9): his best song peridot

**wavingwolves** (9): groovy and fun

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Lol I wanna type a shady comment about how Kehlani is the sole reason I gave this a high score, but this is seriously a good effort from him.

**Leixander** (8): I love Kehlani but her voice didn't fit in with this kind of production imo.

**nightjesus** (8): I love this song. The opening is really similar to How Long a little bit. But Kehlani is so good on this song. And she was so cute in the videoclip. As was Charlie but he kinda blinded me in the sneakers ngl.

**bulforster** (7.5): This is a good Charlie Puth song that Kehlani doesn't fit that well into.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): I love Kehlani's verse here.

**fix-ur-acrostics** (7): Damn them some sexy chords

**vayyiqra** (7): I think I like the idea of Kehlani more than I like her music but this slaps a bit

**bigbigbee** (6): I wish I liked this more. I love Kehlani‚Äôs voice. But this just doesn‚Äôt measure up to most other songs on the album for me. 6 means I wouldn‚Äôt turn it off if it came on the radio, but I wouldn‚Äôt actively seek it out.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5.5): Kehlani is queen and kinda dominates this song. Kinda reminds me of How Long a little too much? Boring tbh

One of the Weeknd‚Äôs most well known songs, this track lands at number 4. Most people think this is an iconic track however the production and style of the song is not for everyone and many people prefer I Feel it Coming as the better Daft Punk collab.

---

**fishingfor8** (10): A real classic.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this was such a bold move for a lead single, but it definitely paid off. The Weeknd‚Äôs collaborations with Daft Punk are amazing, and their unique production definitely suited the feel of the song. I loved it from the instant I heard it and I think it has aged very well because of the fresh sound daft punk gave.

---

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): This is the quintessential male popstar song. A true image reinvention from Daddy Abel!!!!

**jackisboredtoday** (11): just flawless. I‚Äôve played this so many times and it never gets old. perfect nighttime music

**oliveoilgarlic** (11): everytime I‚Äôm driving and this song comes on I suddenly feel like this

**vayyiqra** (11): The most :pensive: synthpop song, a cautionary tale, sadboys unite, money can't buy you happiness. I heard this song played in a cafe a lot in 2016 or so and the synth line has haunted my dreams ever since.

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic

**akanewasright** (10): This is just the best instrumental ever.

**bespectacIed** (10): Yeah this is obviously gonna win and I can't be mad, it deserves to. The repeated final choruses hmmmm. He's really a motherfucking starboy. I am still waiting for my The Weeknd x Daft Punk full album.

**bigbigbee** (10): This song got popular when I had to commute 2 hours in a car each day, so I heard it a lot. I still don‚Äôt know really what it‚Äôs about (I am not really familiar with The Weeknd and I don‚Äôt tend to read lyric breakdowns), but I don‚Äôt really care. This song, the mood it evokes, is incredible and cinematic. ‚ÄúLook what you‚Äôve done‚Äù is a perfect lyric.

**bulforster** (10): Nothing else on the album even comes close to being this good.

**fix-ur-acrostics** (10): AH AH AH AH AH

**hunnybee12** (10): it‚Äôs so perfectly put together it sounds like it was created by an algorithm. thx daft punk

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I remember when everyone in r/popheads was rooting so much for this to be number 1 and when it finally got it, it was a great moment.

**Leixander** (10): This is a modern classic at this point.

**pat-rickstar** (10): Love the dark atmosphere of this song.

**pjones3416** (10): a classic

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): an actual cultural reset

**rickikardashian** (10): daft punk and the weeknd was an amazing mix I wasn't aware I was missing in my life till this came out

**runaway3212** (10): Daft Punk and The Weeknd have such amazing synergy

**sbuhj** (10): What's there to dislike? Daft Punk's production is so clean, the lyrics are great, it's such a good song. It won't get my 11 because of the ahs at the end of each line. I don't mind it in this song, but it's not a style that needs to be copied (@Kendrick Lamar).

**skargardin** (10): that was a classic for sure

**TragicKingdom1** (10): a hip hop song

**turtle-thief** (10): The Weeknd - Starboy (Bachata Version) outsold.

**wardrum5** (10): One of the decade's defining songs

**rotating3Dtext** (9): ah this song will always be associated with (southern hemisphere) summer 2016 for me.

**TiltControls** (9): Maybe a bit overrated sometimes, but still really good.

**timothy444** (9): not as good as I Feel It Coming but I love the dark late night vibe and tones that this song sets for the album

**wavingwolves** (9): the way i just found out he isn't saying "you talking money / need to urinate". still, "star trek groove in that wraith of khan" is his best lyric, i think

**bbfan132** (8.5): this is a nice opener but i don‚Äôt really love it as much as other people do? i wish it was a bit more interesting but it‚Äôs still a great track

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): i'm not as obsessed with this as most of popheads but still a good tune

**pisces\_king** (8.3): I mean, title track of what I think is his best album. Definitely got tired of it though and still kind of am.

**ManofOranges** (8): While I have to say that I don't really love this song a whole lot, it does have a certain appeal that I can't deny. It has a certain je ne sais quoi to it.

**ariiaaaa** (7.2): I don't know why this gives me MARINA vibes circa family jewels but it does

**fadedblue09** (6): It‚Äôs a hit and all, but it‚Äôs super one-note. Very underwhelming for a Daft Punk collaboration.

**ggodisawomann** (6): annoyed me from too much radio overplay

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): This is the typical Weeknd song, about cocaine and being rich. Not the best in his discography but it‚Äôs catchy af.

**jasannn** (6): I never got the hype. ha ha ha ha ha ha

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): abel sounds corny, daft punk sounds annoying, i never really understood why people loves this so much other than the beat

Our highest rated Charlie song is Attention unsurprisingly. There were a few points where I was unsure if it would be the top Charlie track but it pulled through at the end to climb to #3. It was only one ~~call away~~ point away from making the #2 but at last the #2 song had more fans towards the end to keep it at that position.

---

**fishingfor8** (10): This bassline is amazing. His vocals are restrained and crisp. I honestly believe this song paved the way for a comeback for songs like this. I don‚Äôt see Youngblood by 5S0S or Don‚Äôt Start Now by Dua Lipa getting big without this song. Maybe I am overrating it‚Äôs influence but I can‚Äôt think of any pop songs with such a focus on it‚Äôs bassline in the 2010s until this song came around.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): The way this song changed everyone‚Äôs opinion on his music. The production is masterful here (completely done by Puth himself!) especially with the bassline. But the song writing is also less cheesy and more mature and overall this is a very successful reinvention that I wished Charlie kept with.

---

**akanewasright** (11): This song is why I put myself through the rest of the rate. The way the song builds alone is worth a 10, but the hooks, the ad libs, the percussion, the fucking BASSLINE... there was never another 11 for me in this rate.

**ManofOranges** (11): I have been waiting to rate Voicenotes just so I could give this damn song my 11. Charlie knew exactly what he was doing when he made this song and it shows because it's just so good. Everybody and their mother have already lauded the bass line so I'm not gonna bother saying too much, but that bass really is the crux of the whole song. Whew that is some good shit.

**nightjesus** (11): I remember the first time I heard this song. It was when he just released this. The radio announced they were playing it. I groaned as I really didn‚Äôt like Charlie at that point. Then when it started I was like...okay...cool. Then the pre chorus began, I was like alright I‚Äôm listening. Then the chorus began. My world was shook. I didn‚Äôt know he could do me like that. I was stunned. I lost focus on the road for a lil bit. As soon as I got to work I downloaded the song and listened to it on repeat. When I found out HE PRODUCED THE SONG. Oh man. From that moment on I stanned. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

**rickikardashian** (11): still hilarious how the entire online music community switched up on charlie puth when this came. the bassline is good enough to forgive any sins committed by whoever came up with

**rotating3Dtext** (11): ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been runnin‚Äô around THROWING THAT TURTLE ON MY KNEE‚Äù. This song is now a classic tbh.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (11): this song is IT. have you ever witnessed pophead's do a 180 on an artist so quickly? As soon as that bassline kicks it you KNEW this song was it. also the fact it's apparently about Bella Thorne makes it all them more better.

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop, he ATE.

**bigbigbee** (10): Yes, it is extremely overplayed, but that bassline is incredible.

**drewbarrymore2** (10): Classic puth

**fix-ur-acrostics** (10): Overplayed to hell, but still killer.

**gannade** (10): im afraid bella won this round with bitch im bella thorne

**ggodisawomann** (10): absolutely beyond words incredible single. I knew when I first heard this song...this album was going to be everything I wanted in a pop album and I was SO correct.

**hikkaru** (10): one of the best hits of the decade period

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A literal cultural reset, a worldwide smash. I can‚Äôt believe this only peaked at 5 in the US

**jasannn** (10): When I first heard this song on the radio the summer of 2017, I initially called it off as it was the annoying "Marvin Gaye" guy. It slowly got stuck in my head all summer and became one of the best song of the summer.

**Leixander** (10): This managed to grab my attention and stop thinking of him as the See You Again guy, so it did work as intended.

**runaway3212** (10): Imagine in one song going from making 'mom pop' to respected music artist, Attention did that. Also the base is godly

**skargardin** (10): go off

**TiltControls** (10): The one good thing about the Meghan Trainor collab is that Charlie at least picked a love for bass

**timothy444** (10): The better Attention on this rate and also the turning point in Charlie Puth's career when we all thought he was going to release another Nine Track Mind.

**bespectacIed** (9): Deserves its hype. That bassline is cum

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This is the song that changed my perception of Charlie when this song was released. I am a bit iffy on the lyrics though but the production is just too catchy.

**oliveoilgarlic** (9): Bella Thorne found doing various publicity stunts in a ditch

**pat-rickstar** (9): I kind of got bored of this when it came out and got overplayed but now I like it.

**pisces\_king** (9): Several podcasts have lauded this track for being so sexy and I have to agree!

**sbuhj** (8.2): I didn't like this song when it came out. I still don't love it, but in the context of the album it has grown on me.

**wavingwolves** (8): this feels like almost the antithesis of somebody else by the 1975

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): I honestly didn‚Äôt like this much when it was a hit but the baseline grew on me since

**bbfan132** (7.5): the lyrics are kind of questionable but this song is too irresistible for me to tank its score

**vayyiqra** (7): kinda slaps ngl

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): he told Bella Thorne to eat shit, and we all sat there and watched.

**letsallpoo** (6): bella thorne really did a number on him huh

**TragicKingdom1** (6): hot take alert! charlie does not have the charisma to pull this off and the bassline isn't interesting

**fadedblue09** (4): Overplayed AF considering how mediocre it is. Also, the chorus is a super letdown.

**bigbigbee** (7.846): I feel like a shitlord for liking this album as much as I do, but I really, really love it.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.769): I had a feeling I would like the album in some way but wow, I didn't expect I would like the album THIS MUCH. Charlie Puth definitely had more potential than to be the white guy who plays the piano with no stage presence and Voicenotes proved that, especially on the production.

**kaanew** (7.692): This is my first full listen to this album, so I was shocked at how many songs I already knew and liked (the other two albums I‚Äôve streamed on repeat; figured I should get my bias out front now). There‚Äôs a few new additions to my Spotify likes now... better late than never?

**bespectacIed** (7.538): I don't mind Charlie, he seems like an unproblematic boi. I haven't listened to this album prior to the rate, so I was expecting white nice guy anthems. I didn't expect well-produced, sexy, slick, soulful, respectful to the genre it's inspired of, white nice guy anthems. A caucasoid pop boy like charlie had no business making non-mediocre pop music, I'm claiming him as an honorary POC.

**skargardin** (7.154): How Charlie lost the fire after putting out this album I will NEVER understand, it's so well put together and shows so much promise as to what he can do as a producer.

**wavingwolves** (6.654): this is so solid! it's a very straightforward kind of pop, which is really good when well made, but it does get a little too safe, same-y and predictable at times. nothing groundbreaking, but it's not trying to be that at all, it's trying to be enjoyable and it succeeds on it. also, i feel like if this was sung by a woman popheads would cream themselves over it.

**CreepyMannequin** (6.500): Excellent first half, but a let down in the second half.

**oliveoilgarlic** (6.462): definitely outsold my voicenotes but Wham! outsold this

**bulforster** (6.423): He has writing and producing a clean, polished pop song down to a science but there isn't a ton of personality behind it and while there isn't anything really awful, neither is there a truly stellar moment on the album for me. Often the songs feel too controlled and only really shine when he loosens up a bit.

**vayyiqra** (5.423): Like many of us I think I was sort of dreading this album being in the rate. I think it's clear that Popheads does not care much for Charlie Puth, and neither did I before this rate; not because I have anything against him (in fact I had never heard anything by him before now) but because nothing about him seemed interesting in any way. While this album is musically fine and probably the most R&B of anything here (the Weeknd being more synthpop and Bruno Mars being more funk) and his voice is alright, his lyrics are often really boring and leave a lot to want for. This isn't a bad album, but also it's far from a good one. I guess I could put up with it once because it's short.

**fadedblue09** (5.192): Okay, what does this album have other than the fact that it's an improvement upon Nine Track Mind (which isn't even hard to do lmao)? Anyway, I appreciate the attempt at R&B, but I don't think he 'owns' the sound and it all sounds like poor imitations of what's been done before. It's pretty clear he's going through a musical identity crisis (especially w/ those recent singles) and he needs to snap out of it if he wants to make something decent.

Our runner up is Finesse Remix! This song was as low as 8th at one point but eventually climbed all the way to #2 at the end beating out a bunch of Charlie songs, Starboy and 24K Magic. Almost everyone agrees that Cardi elevates this song (and it being one of the best things she has ever done) and it is one of the best remixes out there.
---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a perfect collaboration and remix. Cardi elevates this song easily (it‚Äôs also one of the best if not the best thing she has done) and it‚Äôs already a great song so this is just *chefs kiss*.

**fishingfor8** (9.5): Honestly my favorite Cardi performance of her whole career.

---

**bulforster** (11): It's amazing how much Cardi adds with just a verse and some ad-libs and since this is a men's rate I obviously have to give my 11 to one of the women.

**1998tweety** (10): Cardi ate this UP.

**akanewasright** (10): I fucking adore this song. Cardi B really adds a lot to it.

**bbfan132** (10): i love new jack swing so much - the original was already pretty great and cardi b was the perfect addition here. excellent remix

**bespectacIed** (10): The whiplash I got when this dropped, I still feel to this day. Such an amazing pop song. It's a perfect remix made more perfect by a perfectly 90s music video. The way I became a Cardi stan/believer during this era, I had so much hope for her lol (sorry mother nicki). 90s babies rise up!

**bigbigbee** (10): I think that Cardi improves this song, but I don‚Äôt know if I think that just because I heard the remix first. In any case, it‚Äôs not a significant enough improvement to score it differently from the original, and it‚Äôs moot because I think that the original is a 10.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is definitely a contender for my 11. The original is already a bop but Cardi definitely added new life to this song. This is definitely a remix track that wasn't half-baked for the sake of the charts.

**ggodisawomann** (10): I mean, less than a 10 for this is injustice

**hikkaru** (10): cardi ATE

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): Superior to the original. The energy in this is amazing. Cardi‚Äôs best song tbh

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a career highlight for cardi

**ManofOranges** (10): Cardi really does elevate this song so much, it's kind of amazing how much I feel like she adds to the song even though she only has one verse and then a small part at the end and yet I wouldn't have it any other way.

**nightjesus** (10): Her opening is I C O N I C.

**oliveoilgarlic** (10): everything about this is perfect

**pat-rickstar** (10): Whatever your opinion of Cardi she definitely improved this song.

**piccprincess** (10): this song is snatched af

**pisces\_king** (10): Cardi's presence here elevates the song from fantastic to impeccable.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): cardi adds the final touch

**runaway3212** (10): Cardi B at her best

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): both versions are 10s tho

**skargardin** (10): this is it

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): Cardi's energy just ELEVATES this song

**TiltControls** (10): Already a good song, but Cardi's energy really helps sell the old-school energy!

**turtle-thief** (10): This and the video were the perfect combo. Cardi and bruno just have it, also her ad libs make this song and her coming back for the last chorus is the cherry on top.

**wavingwolves** (10): this is a 10

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): cardi really completes it even if she doesn't do much

**fix-ur-acrostics** (9): That's not an accordion! I guess it's still good tho.

**kaanew** (9): I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to differentiate between the remix and original... both are bangers

**timothy444** (8.9): I'm docking a tenth of a point just because it has Cardi B in it. Shoulda collabed with Ava Max instead!

**gannade** (8.5): cardi ate it up

**Leixander** (8.5): A very good remix! Better than the original.

**sbuhj** (8.5): This is a very good remix. Cardi is at peak form here, and it feels like this is how the song was supposed to be. This doesn't fix the lyric issues of the original song (though Cardi has good lyrics), but it overall improves the song.

**fadedblue09** (8): This is still good, but I wish Cardi's contribution was more memorable.

**CreepyMannequin** (7.5): Needed more Cardi

**jasannn** (6): Another unneeded Cardi remix but not bad.

**PointlessBibliophage** (5): was this needed? cause like... i don't need it

**vayyiqra** (4): go away Cardi you suck

fishingfor8: # 24K Magic

---

**Overall Average**: 7.691 **// Average Controversy:** 1.859

---

**kaanew** (8.800): Full of bops, the production on this album is 10/10.

**bespectacIed** (8.500): Looking back, I was one of the many people who disagreed with this AOTY win over its stacked competition, but the thought of a filipino/latino artist beating popheads' precious, can-never-do-wrong little white girl gives me so much buzz now lol. This is a danceable, fun record, that I will always listen with a bit of cynicism due to bruno's culture vultureness

**rickikardashian** (8.480): Bruno really made the most out of a 30 minute ~~EP~~ albun

**wavingwolves** (8.450): in my experience, this is a great album to get ready to when you're in your friends' home and y'all are already late but still going out with a full face of makeup. just late night jams.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.400): I have been meaning to listen to this album FOR YEARS, and I finally did because of this rate. To be honest though, maybe I am not in a good mood to listen to this album but I feel like I need more time with this album. (Ajay teas). Anyways, it's so refreshing for an artist like Bruno to put out an album. The short tracklist definitely helped the album feel cohesive and straight to the point.

**skargardin** (8.400): Bruno's best album for sure but it's a low bar to be honest since his albums prior to this were all painfully mediocre. This was a step in the right direction and I hope whatever follows it is just as good.

**fadedblue09** (8.280): My favorite album of the bunch, even though I don't stan Bruno at all. The album blends throwback and contemporary elements well in its production and is full of strong hooks. If I had any complaints, I hope Bruno shows more soul and vulnerability in his future work instead of milking the same lyrical themes all over again. I believe he's capable of so much more than his current output suggests.

**hikkaru** (7.850): somehow this has some of the least memorable tracks in the rate despite being the shortest album by a decent margin but it is still quite good

**bigbigbee** (7.750): I wanted to score a lot of songs on this album higher because I think objectively this album is really well produced ‚Äì a masterpiece of its craft. However, what I realized upon multiple listens is that I guess this particular throwback sound isn‚Äôt my cup of tea. :/ Still a big fan of Bruno though, and I‚Äôll keep looking forward to his new work.

**oliveoilgarlic** (7.600): this is what you put on getting ready for a night out with the boys/girls/who the fuck ever anyways I love it

**bulforster** (7.250): This really feels like an album from a singles-focused artist since they're more than half the tracklist and by far the standouts while the rest of the songs breeze by and are a bit like empty calories to me. I do appreciate how light and fun the album is overall though.

**vayyiqra** (7.100): Popheads really bamboozled me with this album by convincing me that just because it beat Melodrama and was popular, therefore it must be bad. It doesn't seem to have occurred to anyone that maybe this album is popular and won awards because it is good. Even though I'm not a big fan of Bruno Mars, this is still a fun album full of bops and is a nice break after the morose style of Starboy (which, don't get me wrong, I do enjoy). There is nothing wrong with Bruno Mars and his ridiculous songs about partying and jacuzzis and whatever the fuck else Bruno Mars sings about here; you just hate fun. As for me, I love to see short kings winning. The absolute CHAD he is.

**Leixander** (6.500): Not a huge fan of this album sadly.

**akanewasright** (5.900): There are 10 vocal fans of this album on the sub, and like... more power to you? It‚Äôs not for me. I listened to it once for this rate and didn‚Äôt like it much. Drag me, I don‚Äôt care.

**CritneySpearz** (5.750): this is the album that beat DAMN and Melodrama for album of the year...? I now understand the outrage

**CreepyMannequin** (4.700): The first half is of the most agonizing listening experiences in pop music of the 2010s. The second half is average but comes as a very welcome surprise after ‚ÄúPerm‚Äù and ‚Äú24K Magic.‚Äù

**gannade** (4.150): this album has like no creative vision. everything is a throwback but with no artistic input.

And here we have our rate winner! This song was pretty much in the lead the entire time (except at the very beginning). I think almost everyone can agree this is the best song on the album and a perfect closer after the drag that is the middle of Starboy. 

---

**ignitethephoenix** (11): what a perfect closer. This is honestly one of his best songs of all time and it‚Äôs a classic is every way. Daft Punk‚Äôs production is once again top notch and The Weeknd‚Äôs vocals are at his best.

**fishingfor8** (8): This song is good. However, it feels too much like a straight MJ impression for me to be comfortable giving it a full endorsement. Plus 'I Feel It Coming' is an obnoxious double entendre

---

**bbfan132** (11): if this doesn‚Äôt win, i will be extremely confused‚Ä¶ perfect closer to this album and easily the best track here

**ImADudeDuh** (11): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITCH!!!!! THEY DID THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**pat-rickstar** (11): What can I say, pop perfection.

**PointlessBibliophage** (11): talented brilliant incredible

**skargardin** (11): This is the perfect marriage of Daft Punk's funky production and Abel's smooth vocals. I could listen to this endlessly.

**turtle-thief** (11): The only songs i feel will be seen as timeless as the years go by are this one and 24k magic, but IFIC has this inspiring optimism that i adore. It's like the I Gotta Feeling of the 2010's.

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop

**akanewasright** (10): THE ALBUM IS FINALLY OVER! That alone puts this song at a 7, but also this song is just really great. Daft Punk knocked it put of the park with the production here.

**bespectacIed** (10): Unpopular opinion, IFIC >>>> Starboy. What a joyful end to a dark album. The album is a 1-hour Kink.com edging session and this is the literal climax

**bigbigbee** (10): Almost got my 11. I LOVE this song. Hopeful and beautiful. I‚Äôm just realizing that it‚Äôs probably at least partially about sex? I‚Äôve listened to this song so many times but I‚Äôve never made that connection. I‚Äôve always just connected it with the feeling of anticipation you get, the one where you just FEEL like something good is on it way.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is such a perfect closer. This deserves Starboy's popularity.

**ggodisawomann** (10): anyone who gives this less than a 10 is wrong, always been a bop always will be a bop

**hikkaru** (10): another daft punk comeback when

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): My favorite of the ‚Äúradio‚Äù singles from this song. Everything is just right. Plus Daft Punk üòç

**ManofOranges** (10): I like how the album both opens and closes with the songs featuring Daft Punk. It certainly leaves an impression because both of the songs are very good. Especially this one in particular. Honestly something about this song, maybe the tone or the mood or something, feels so different from the rest of the album. Compared to the rest of the album, this song is an anomaly of happiness and optimism and I mean that in the best way possible. It's one of my favorite songs in this rate. This was definitely a close second or third for my 11 because I just love it so much.

**oliveoilgarlic** (10): orgasms AND emotional safety? sounds fake but I still love this song

**piccprincess** (10): I would like to feel it cumming

**rickikardashian** (10): Abel out the best songs in the album first and last and hoped no one would mind anything in the middle

**rotating3Dtext** (10): the lyrics are the biggest ‚Äòlmao‚Äô but damn is it funky.

**runaway3212** (10): Daft Punk just can't do anything wrong.

**TiltControls** (10): The better Daft Punk collab. I think the production is a lot smoother (though that might just be personal preference)

**timothy444** (10): The best song he's ever done, period. There's just so much funkiness going on here and combined with the disco and daft punk signature robot voices, all it equates to is a banger!

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i feel it coming ... this song winning the rate

**vayyiqra** (10): The Weeknd and Daft Punk can make as many funk-influenced songs as they want and I will listen to them

**wavingwolves** (10): chaaaarming

**fadedblue09** (9.8): Daft Punk‚Äôs superior contribution to this album. It‚Äôs very fun and funky, and has a summery vibe.

**sbuhj** (9.8): This album is too long, with too much filler, but what a relief to get this song at the end. This song has always felt like a breath of fresh air to me. One of his best.

**pisces\_king** (9.2): Such an iconic song! While not the title track, this feels like it embodies the ethos of this album and this era of The Weeknd's career.

**fix-ur-acrostics** (9): Could use more vocoder

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): i prefer this to starboy sue me

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): the song that finally made my mom decide The Weeknd was ok after all

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): the pre-chorus melody is so pleasing from a music theory standpoint i love that part so much

**bulforster** (8): Thank god Daft Punk come back as a reward for sitting through this slog of an album.

**hunnybee12** (8): it‚Äôs nice but gets too repetitive after a while

**Leixander** (7): The chorus gets too repetitive and feels awkward after a while.

**nightjesus** (4): I‚Äôve always found this song boring and easy. And in context with the whole album it‚Äôs more annoying because it‚Äôs still super repetitive. Ugggghhh.

fishingfor8: # Starboy

---

**Overall Average**: 7.260 **// Average Controversy:** 1.838

---

**bespectacIed** (8.500): Probs the best album in the rate. This album is a banger machine, albeit with many duds (i.e. the majority of the 2nd half, sue me!). I think this is an unpopular opinion but I can't say After Hours has topped this ... yet. Idk, maybe only equalled. Starboy just sounds so fresh to this day

**wardrum5** (8.306): Misogyny is okay when it comes from Abel :)

**gannade** (8.278): way too bloated but he snappt sometimes

**hikkaru** (8.194): a bit bloated but i sure am a whore for electropop abel

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.056): I remember loving this album when it came out. I even bought the CD to solidify how much I loved this album. However, re-listening to this album made me realize I only loved the first half of the album because the second half bored the hell out of me. I feel like I loved the album when it came out because it was refreshing that Abel is able to pull off the main pop boy aesthetic better than his male peers. Starboy still does show that he has the potential to be the main pop boy, which is why it was satisfying to see that After Hours strengthened him further as the MAIN POP BOY. Starboy has the highest highs, but it also has the lowest lows. I'll probably only revisit the album again for its stellar first half.

**wavingwolves** (7.972): abel be like "i don't like women who like me but i get infatuated with the ones i can't have easily but when my feelings are reciprocated i consider myself too fucked up to make it work and while i'm sorry i don't do anything to change it and on top of that my life is too difficult to have a real relationship when that option is on the table and it makes me feel isolated and bad so i use sex and drugs to deal with it" and i'm like yeah i feel you. this is a great album, even if a little bloated and unfocused at times.

**Leixander** (7.750): Love love love this album. It is like a perfected version of Beauty Behind the Madness, an album which I also adore. It could of course be better without some fillers, but the skip button is always there!

**rickikardashian** (7.600): It's a nice listen, but it's carried by the production because lyrically it's whatever and it relies a lot on less than decent hooks, which is alright just to listen to but rating it was hard considering that everything kind of mashes together

**TiltControls** (7.528): Starboy was a really weird album for me. For one, it could have easily been cut down a little. Another is that the tracks struck me as consistently great, but rarely fantastic. Not to say it's a bad album, but I feel only a few songs stick after a listen.

**vayyiqra** (7.500): This is an album I like but don't go back to much. I don't dislike anything on it, and there are a lot of great tracks, but everyone knows that's overlong and some songs are a bit filler-ish. It would be better and tighter as an album if it were shorter, but there are enough highlights to keep my interest the whole life, and the production on it is great.I also appreciate hearing the Weeknd open up on it and sing about personal topics even though it feels like every song on it is about cocaine. Also Daft Punk never miss. Overall this is quite a good late-night album to "vibe" to.

**bigbigbee** (7.333): Rating the songs on this album was a bit tough for me. Like many others, I do think that it‚Äôs too long and the songs start blending together a bit towards the end of the album‚Ä¶.but is that because THEY‚ÄôRE the filler tracks, or would I think that other tracks would sound like obvious filler if the album were shuffled around? In any case, the album ultimately IS ordered in the way that it is, so I didn‚Äôt worry too much; but I could totally understand if people had completely different opinions from me on what songs they‚Äôd cut if they had the chance.

**oliveoilgarlic** (7.278): could‚Äôve cut a few songs from the second half but god DAMN do I love this album! beats to drive through cities at night and feel dangerous to

**skargardin** (7.278): It's a good, albeit bloated album. Even if I've listened to this album several times through the back half just doesn't stick with me at all.

**fadedblue09** (7.128): This album is a very mixed bag. On one hand, you have the dance-oriented songs, which were mostly fun but some felt overproduced or just flat-out bad (looks at False Alarm). On the other hand, you have the R&B songs, which showed his soulful side but are sometimes one-note and generic. Also, there is NO reason for this to be long. You can literally cut ANYTHING and it's automatically a better album (even though I had some favorites, none of them were super essential IMO).

**akanewasright** (6.083): I never wanted to listen to this album. I knew there would be a few good songs, hell, maybe even a lot of great songs. But I just didn‚Äôt want to sit through all the filler, the filler that EVERYONE agreed was there. But because of the rate, I kinda had to, and like... yeah. Great highs, very underbaked lows.

**CreepyMannequin** (5.750): A strong start followed by a rollercoaster of tracks of varying quality, none of which reach the highs of the first two tracks.

**bulforster** (5.444): While Bruno has the standout tracks and I'd say Voicenotes is the best album here overall, this album... certainly is the longest.

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: I knew I should have given I Feel It Coming a 11 but I thought Starboy had more chances of winning so I gave it my 11. So glad I Feel It Coming won this rate!!!

Also glad Rockin' survived until the finale. I always thought it would go out on the first day.
