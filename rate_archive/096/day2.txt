Men's R&B Pop Rate: Day 2: Somebody Told Me You're Too Good To Say Goodbye
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/htl0xq/mens_rb_pop_rate_day_2_somebody_told_me_youre_too/

And it's day 2. Lots of ballads and filler are gone and after a fairly uncontroversial day we get to have some fun now. Welcome to the Men's R&B Pop Rate where we take a look at 3 albums from the late 2010s that blurred the gap between pop and r&b. The three albums are 24k Magic by Bruno Mars, Voicenotes by Charlie Puth and Starboy by The Weeknd.

Apparently it wasn‚Äôt good enough and r/popheads said goodbye.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): a nice ballad to close on! I keep being surprised at how well Bruno can do ballads even though I really shouldn‚Äôt lol. This song outsold Grenade and Just the Way You Are easily.

**fishingfor8** (7): Somewhat forgettable

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): I see him like singing this outside some girls window. It‚Äôs just good tbfh

**TragicKingdom1** (9): such an interesting throwback to 70s soul ballads

**wavingwolves** (9): a perfect song to sing while drunk

**jasannn** (8.5): A little cheesy but I love the vocals and the key change at the end. Is it a key change? I'm trying to learn to identify key changes.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): this might be the best closing track from the 3 albums

**pisces\_king** (8.1): I'm here for this ballad.

**1998tweety** (8): Sam Smith is shaking.

**bespectacIed** (8): vocals!!!!

**ManofOranges** (8): A nicer ballad and a fine closer. Also, everytime I hear the first note of the song when it comes on I keep thinking that it's 80s Mercedes.

**runaway3212** (8): A great song

**sbuhj** (7.9): I've tried to avoid comparing songs on this album to songs on his other albums. But this is clearly supposed to be the If I Was Your Man of this album. This song is stylistically more like his other albums, and as much as I like that, I don't feel like it fits on this album. And it's not original enough to be worth including.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): It's a sedated version of When I Was Your Man, but still fine.

**piccprincess** (7): why is this album so slow

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): can someone PLEASE tell me what song this chorus sounds like

**bbfan132** (6.5): a decent ballad but i wish it was more interesting

**Leixander** (6.5): Weren't Alicia and Aisha waiting for you though? This is too much emotion for safe. Jokes aside I love the way the song builds to the chorus.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): i have a hard time believing this song was written in the 21st century

**ggodisawomann** (6): dis okay

**nightjesus** (6): I mean it‚Äôs a nice closer. The pre chorus is cute. But it‚Äôs just too slow for me tbh. The end is alright.

**skargardin** (6): its alright..

**vayyiqra** (6): pensive

**oliveoilgarlic** (5): I have a soft spot for 70s soul style ballads but the amount of times I listened to this after my first gf dumped me over text in November 2016 has ruined it for me üòî

**akanewasright** (4): Is it tho?

**bulforster** (4): My balladphobic instincts are kicking in.

Somewhat surprised this made Day 2, it is a bit weak and I thought it would‚Äôve gotten destroyed in a rate with such consistency across the board.

**fishingfor8** (8.3): Doing this review reminded me of a couple songs I haven‚Äôt listened to in a while that I loved. The chorus is weak but overall it‚Äôs really solid.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I love the plucky guitar line this has. This is a cute song however I don‚Äôt think this one of the strongest songs here and can drag a little bit.

**ggodisawomann** (10): UNDERRATED BANGER. y'all need to mess with more LA girls

**ManofOranges** (10): Another song that is delicious to the ear.

**timothy444** (10): Usually album tracks are just filler but in this case who cares? This song is an absolute bop and much better than the entirety of Chromatica!

**oliveoilgarlic** (9): another perfectly crafted pop song but it doesn‚Äôt get a 10 bc it has always bothered me that the melody goes up when he says ‚Äúwhy the hell did I get caught up‚Äù instead of down. anyways the chord changes on the pre chorus are perfection

**sbuhj** (9): It's a little hard to take baby-faced, innocent Charlie seriously in this, but the song is funky and fun.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): this album is just so neatly produced.

**1998tweety** (8): Vibey, I wish the chorus had a bit more of a switch though.

**bbfan132** (8): who are tiffany and heather??? i like this track, a bit too basic but it‚Äôs pleasant

**bulforster** (8): I like this but outside of the chorus it's a bit sparse.

**nightjesus** (8): The thing about Voicenotes is that it‚Äôs crisp on production. Look I may be a little bias as I‚Äôm a sucker for 90‚Äôs Rnb and New Jack Swing but how can you not get sucked in by that pre chorus?

**runaway3212** (8): This song is good, but just cause of the instrumentals, the vocals are barely decent.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): how am i just now realizing how cheesy charlie puth songs are

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.6): charlie's vocals really are the high point here

**ariiaaaa** (7.5): KK Slider guitar vibes

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): i‚Äôm a sucker for LA themed songs so I‚Äôm going soft on this one

**pisces\_king** (7.3): The beginning is very Slim Shady vibes, which I like in that I recognize it, but not in that I give a shit about Eminem. The falsetto 'I miss my BABY' at the end of the chorus is great. Song feels a little like old Charlie besides the bass.

**Leixander** (7): Sounds great but the lyrics threw me off lmao. I can't imagine him as a womanizer for some reason. He can't really pull off the cool attitude like The Weeknd does. Sorry Charlie.

**akanewasright** (6.5): This song is underbaked compared to the three singles that surround it, but I still like it. I can‚Äôt help but love that guitar, and ‚ÄúI miss my baby‚Äù has stuck with me since the first time I heard the song.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): This reminds me of something that would be in a musical, but it‚Äôs not bad. The Greyhound lyric is too real üòî

**vayyiqra** (5.5): Well, I just got into town about an hour ago / Took a look around, see which way the wind blow / Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows / Are you a lucky little lady in the City of Light? / Or just another lost angel?

**bigbigbee** (5): Sometimes Charlie‚Äôs production is so good that I can overlook the ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù feel of some of his lyrics. This song is not one of those times. The ‚ÄúI miss my baby‚Äù is also annoying to me.

**fix-ur-acrostics** (5): What the hell is that guitar tone?

**skargardin** (5): eh

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Is this album gonna be a series of songs with disappointing hooks?

The general opinion on this one is that there‚Äôs a lot of wasted potential here. Kendrick and The Weeknd should‚Äôve given us something better than this

---

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I remember being disappointed at this song first because of the autotune on the Weeknd‚Äôs voice and kendricks feature. However this song has probably grown on me the most out of all tracks here. Kendrick snapped for sure and it‚Äôs definitely one of the more unique tracks here.

**fishingfor8** (5): The Weeknd with such obnoxious autotune is not a good idea. Kendrick's verse is pretty generic too

---

**bespectacIed** (10): kendrick's verse goddamnit. In 2:27 and 2:53 when his flow perfectly matched the percussive beat, my entire face literally melted

**bigbigbee** (10): Stands out from the other tracks on this album in a GREAT way. I always perked up when this came on when I was doing full album listens for this rate.

**ManofOranges** (10): Period.

**piccprincess** (10): anyone who disrespects kdot, I will FIGHT

**skargardin** (10): MAJOR bop

**runaway3212** (9.5): Just amazing.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): the guy who does uncredited vocals on the post-chorus sounds like a cross between sam smith and don toliver

**akanewasright** (9): This is easily the best deep cut I‚Äôve heard so far. Kendrick SLAPPED his verse, and The Weeknd didn‚Äôt do so bad either.

**pisces\_king** (8.8): Very strong, Kendrick brings something great to this that keeps the album from being too similar.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Loving the lyrics! Remove those extra vocals by Daniel Wilson and this is a 10.

**1998tweety** (7.5): Kendrick ate for once oh wow

**bbfan132** (7.5): don‚Äôt really have a lot to say about this lol - it‚Äôs a good track but it kind of doesn‚Äôt go anywhere

**oliveoilgarlic** (7.5): autotune Abel is not my fav but Kendrick‚Äôs verse and the other male singer who isn‚Äôt actually Sam Smith make this

**bulforster** (7): I don't quite get the point of the autotune and "say say say" is annoying but other than that a solid cut with a good Kendrick verse.

**pat-rickstar** (7): Say say say gets a bit repetitive.

**sbuhj** (7): Ugh, the warped vocal sound that's popular that I hate. Like if you're going to go for the Autotune sound, go all the way. Kendrick saved the song, and that's coming from someone who doesn't generally like Kendrick. Kendrick and the high parts got this song up to a 7.

**ariiaaaa** (6): I see summers, beaches, and I love it but the rap really adds nothing here

**Leixander** (6): Very underwhelming for a Kendrick collab.

**vayyiqra** (6): Sidewalk's for regular walkin' not fancy walkin'

**ggodisawomann** (5): I don't care for Kendrick so

**nightjesus** (5): I like Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs verse and the guitars are cool. But I dunno I feel like this album is dragging onnnnnnnn.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): this track is kinda boring other than kendrick‚Äôs verse

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5): another thats filler-ish to me

**wavingwolves** (5): it's fine but only that

**fix-ur-acrostics** (3): Wasted potential.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): the lyricism is boring and kinda surface level. Kendrick outshines The Weeknd on this one though. petty forgettable

I‚Äôm fairly positive at this point that Charlie has cheated or has been cheated on before. You don‚Äôt sing about a topic this much if you‚Äôve never experienced it.

---

**fishingfor8** (8.5): Honestly love it but omg Charlie sings so much about cheating.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Another great song, but at this point in the track list I feel like it‚Äôs getting a little stale thematically and there are other tracks that do this sound and topic better.

---

**CritneySpearz** (11): heard this song for the first time at his concert, instantly became a favorite

**bespectacIed** (10): girl i hear sumn and it fucking slaps

**ggodisawomann** (10): GOT ANOTHER LOVER YOU BEEN GIVIN IT TO

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://tenor.com/view/smoking-chill-head-bopping-gif-17396300

**nightjesus** (10): Better of the Somebody Told Me‚Äôs. Come at me.

**piccprincess** (10): an almost 11...

**Leixander** (9): love the "you're mymymymyiiiiiine girl" hook, but please for the love of god get a lyricist i am BEGGING

**ManofOranges** (9): Charlie writes so many songs about cheating and for what?! At least they sound good though.

**runaway3212** (9): I love the difference between the rest of the song and the first verse

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.7): amazing chorus

**bigbigbee** (8): I can‚Äôt explain why I like this song but I really do.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): Summer anthem? Ok I see you Charlie Petras.

**sbuhj** (8): There's already a song called Somebody Told Me and it's better than this one. The ooh ooh oohs work better on other songs on this album.

**1998tweety** (7.5): Alright

**bbfan132** (7): this was fun but not the most interesting song on this album

**wavingwolves** (7): still NOT better than somebody told me by the killers but it's a solid attempt

**pisces\_king** (6.8): Good, not great. Charlie can do a faster song like this, but the drums make it feel just a bit rushed and a little bit of an outcast on the album.

**akanewasright** (6): It‚Äôs produced well, but like... Charlie, it‚Äôs moments like these where we all believe that you‚Äôve never been in love before.

**kaanew** (6): I feel like people will disagree but this one... is a little bland?

**oliveoilgarlic** (6): the world is gonna roll me

**vayyiqra** (6): I've been listening to 80s music a lot lately and this sounds kind of like "Boys of Summer" but not as good but it's still okay

**pat-rickstar** (5.5): Charlie cheated on his girl in How Long and now he's upset she's doing the same? Girl...

**skargardin** (5): it's .... there

**fadedblue09** (3.5): I'm getting real tired of his whiny betrayed boy schtick. Anyway, this is super basic AF and he's just yelling the chorus.

Do people love or hate it? Seems like a bit of both which strands it in the middle

---

**fishingfor8** (10): This song builds so well. Really underrated.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): If this isn‚Äôt the most controversial song in the rate, I‚Äôll be shocked. When this song was released as a promotional single I remember how polarizing it was, and I think it still is amongst fans. You either love it or hate it. It‚Äôs definitely the most out there song he has made, with the processed vocals and the screaming and pounding in the chorus. I didn‚Äôt love it when it first came out and although I like it more now, it‚Äôs a track I rarely come back to.

---

**hikkaru** (11): this makes me go absolutely feral it better do well in this rate

**bespectacIed** (10): false aLAAURgHh. I love his abundance of energy, go girl give us everything

**fix-ur-acrostics** (10): Warning: Listening to this song may induce erratic behavior resulting in physical injuries and property damage. Listen to it at your own risk.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): if you didn‚Äôt hate this song the first time you listened to it, can you really love it?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the video is such a fucking SERVE

**Leixander** (10): The absolute ENERGY of this song!

**piccprincess** (10): the music video to this is literally god

**skargardin** (10): when Abel goes all ALAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARM... i felt that

**ariiaaaa** (9): we love a beach-y vibe in the awful time that is 2020, dear god this goes hard.

**bigbigbee** (9): Great song that immediately stuck out on first listen, but I docked a point because after repeated plays I got tired of it more quickly than I was hoping (mostly the verses; the pre-chorus, chorus, and instrumentals are all top notch).

**sbuhj** (8.7): Okay this song started off sounding life filler and then the chorus hit. I still have a lot to listen to on this album, but I bet this will be one of my favorites off the album. My new Halloween jam.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): i was listening at the supermarket and the whole time i felt like i was being chased by paparazzi 

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): this has such a good melody but jamie foxx focus vibes

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): this song feels so punk and the video is an instant classic

**plastichaxan** (8): i was scared i wouldn't love this anymore but i was wrong yup

**runaway3212** (8): Great energy and build up

**turtle-thief** (8): Dig the energy, i cringe a little at the chorus tho.

**pisces\_king** (7.3): Have to be in a certain mood to really get into it.

**rotating3Dtext** (7): for a long time I was ‚Äúmeh‚Äù on this song, but now I kinda appreciate it‚Äôs spooky (?) vibes.

**1998tweety** (6.5): This slaps...wish the chorus was better though.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): i hate the screaming of false alarm which is so annoying bc i love the rest of the song

**bulforster** (6): Sounds like a proto-Blinding Lights, the energy is here but it's not channeled properly. I feel like even just removing/changing those looped chants would make a world of difference.

**wavingwolves** (6): if you speak brazilian portuguese it sounds like he's screaming "vacil√£o" (slang meaning someone very... faulty) and it always takes me out bc it's so funny

**akanewasright** (5): This is a fucking weird song.

**ManofOranges** (5): I don't really like this one. Next!

**vayyiqra** (5): I do not like this song it is too chaotic and messy and weird and his vocals are shrill it's just odd

**bbfan132** (4.5): there are some cool ideas but the chorus is annoying as hell and the mixing sounds off

**nightjesus** (4): Oh I like the opening so far it‚Äôs got a cool beat. Look the chorus is different. And the end just cuts off like that with spooky music? Oh my god now there is another song bye.

**fadedblue09** (1): Holy crap that chorus is super BAD.

**kaanew** (0): I‚Äôm increasingly annoyed by each chorus. Issa skip for me.

Here we have another remix that no one asked for but it was given to us. Some people really enjoyed it (more than the original) but overall, people were very meh on it. 


---

**fishingfor8** (7): Not even close to the original

**ignitethephoenix** (3): Another unnecessary remix that no one asked for. Look I like upbeat songs as much as everyone else, but this didn‚Äôt need to be remixed into a upbeat David Guetta mix with all his tricks.

---

**1998tweety** (10): BOP

**ManofOranges** (10): I love the original, but I think I love this version even more. The extra elements that Guetta add just give it a little bit more of a groove and it elevates the song so much. The only gripe I have is that little breakdown but it doesn't make me not love the song. I'd give this an 11 if I could.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Actually an improvement

**pat-rickstar** (9): I still prefer the original but this gets an inflated score because most of the bonus songs are meh.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): not bad but why does this exist

**bbfan132** (7): kind of unnecessary and inoffensive but it‚Äôs pretty good

**oliveoilgarlic** (7): honestly this has the strongest Michael Jackson vibes of anything in this rate

**bespectacIed** (6): it's kinda funky but eh the original was gorgeous enough

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): this wasn‚Äôt really necessary but I don‚Äôt mind it? still sounds opulent. kinda seems like guettas best daft punk impersonation.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): why is this better than i remember

**vayyiqra** (6): this is a half-hearted Daft Punk LARP and it's okay

**jackisboredtoday** (5.7): i like the vocoder bit but giving this a dance beat kinda ruins the fact that it‚Äôs a slow-jam throwback

**CritneySpearz** (5): slightly better than original I guess..

**fix-ur-acrostics** (5): Honestly, this removes a lot of the appeal of the original. The reason Versace On the Floor is so great is because it absolutely shouldn't work. Adding funk to it just makes it generically good instead of weirdly good.

**ggodisawomann** (5): meh, I like Guetta quite a bit but meh

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5): why was this remix necessary it ADDS noting and takes away EVERYTHING

**pisces\_king** (4.2): This song is not good.

**kaanew** (4): no

**nightjesus** (3): I FEEL IT COMING on wait it‚Äôs Versace in the Floor? Wait what? Also I‚Äôm sorry but these bonus songs were....they were somethin.

**wavingwolves** (3): nooooooooooo

**skargardin** (1): I've hated this remix ever since it took over radio airplay from the original, disgusting behaviour

Might Not lands at #7. People liked the Weeknd‚Äôs part but did not care for Belly at all unsurprisingly. 
---

**fishingfor8** (10): This song is a huge guilty pleasure, it used to play so much on the hip hop station in my area so the explicit version just sounds weird.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): a bop that‚Äôs mostly carries by The Weeknd. Belly is fine (better than Nav at least haha) so this good workout playlist kind of song for me.

---

**wardrum5** (9.5): Belly gets wrecked on his own song lmao

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Ok Abel ATE here. It's almost as if it's his song.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this slaps already but it would be even better as a solo abel song

**kaanew** (8): they really didn‚Äôt have to go this hard!!

**ManofOranges** (8): Pretty good, I think.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): points mostly for abel‚Äôs part, ngl

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): such a fun and low-stakes track with a ridiculously good hook‚Ä¶ then Belly has to come in

**1998tweety** (7): Ok

**bbfan132** (7): i like the instrumental; better than several filler tracks on starboy

**fix-ur-acrostics** (7): I am extremely curious why this guy thought Belly was a good stage name.

**pisces\_king** (6.2): It's fine.

**oliveoilgarlic** (6): ‚Äúall i wanna do is forget about my past and smoke a little weed nothing too drastic‚Äù relatable king

**vayyiqra** (6): we support harm reduction

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5.5): started out pretty decent but got boring quick

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): This is my first time listening to a song from Belly and uhh.....I can see why he is not well-liked.

**ggodisawomann** (5): meh

**wavingwolves** (5): uhhhhhh

**ImADudeDuh** (4): This song always makes me thing of the billboard chart channel HRChart that was active from 2014-2016 before they left youtube and got their whole channel copyrighted to oblivion. It‚Äôs also very meh

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): I do not like Belly, but The Weeknd sounds good. That hippie line üíÄ Chile anyways so...

**nightjesus** (2): I might not make it through the song uugghhhhh.

Both of us really loved this song when it first came out but it definitely has shrunk a bit for many. I think the balladphobia eventually killed it

---

**fishingfor8** (9.3): This is my favorite slow song on the album. It really packs a punch even though the chorus is somewhat generic

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This was another one of my favourite non singles the first time I heard the album however I think it‚Äôs shrunk a bit for me since then.

---

**hunnybee12** (11): probably his must earnest & emotional song, makes me cry some nights...

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (11): I knew this was my eleven going into this rate lol, but this song is easily pop perfection. Just a sticky, good ass ballad. Reminds me of the stuff on My Dear Melancholy but more poppy (and that‚Äôs a compliment)

**jasannn** (11): A great simp pop song.

**ariiaaaa** (10): relatable

**bespectacIed** (10): This is really fucking fantastic Makes me ascend to a higher plane. Makes me wanna die for someone. The best song in the album tied with Party Monster. The vocals, damn it. Should have been a single. Should have been my 11

**fadedblue09** (10): Whew the vocal slayage. The highlight of the back half of this album, and possibly my favorite of the whole album as well? An 11 contender for me.

**Leixander** (10): Pretty sure this is not the first time he is talking about dying for someone in this album. It is true that this amazing chorus is to die for though!

**oliveoilgarlic** (10): meryl streep yelling meme EVEN THOUGH WE‚ÄôRE GOOOOIN THRU IT AND IT MAKES U FEEL ALOOONE JUST KNOW THAT I WOULD DIE FOR YOUUUU

**pisces\_king** (10): My favorite on the album. It's intoxicating. The beat sounds a lot like Worth It, but faster and sexier, and the chorus really sails over the track beautifully.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this slaps?

**wavingwolves** (10): this feels both sweet and desperate at the same time and i appreciate that emotional range

**ManofOranges** (9): Another nice song, not quite cream of the crop but good nonetheless.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): idk what the consensus is on this song but i love it and thats what is most important

**1998tweety** (8): Bop

**sbuhj** (7.8): Feels like Abel is mustering up some last bit of energy to finish off the album, and it's needed after the last song.

**vayyiqra** (7): This is good and chill and all but ngl I am kind of glad this album is almost over I need a change

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): the better of the two ballads here, but honestly both this and nothing without you feel inessential outside of needing a love song for the end of the album to set up IFIC

**bbfan132** (6.5): not a bad song but not really exciting either

**nightjesus** (6): It‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs easy to listen to but I‚Äôm kinda just over this album at this point.

**bulforster** (5): I can't figure out if I actually like this or if it just sounds better compared the the last few songs and I'm leaning towards the latter.

**runaway3212** (5): Maybe it's cause it's later in the album but I feel like there are more songs that sound exactly like this.

**ggodisawomann** (4): why does all of this man's music sound the damn same! I appreciate consistency but this is too muchhhhh. filler. he has a lot of filler.

A Max Martin collab, it‚Äôs a bop that suffers from high expectations set by other max and abel collabs. It scored decently though  mostly due to people loving the pop side of Abel.

---

**fishingfor8** (8.9): I always forget this song is on the album even though it's good. Save Your Tears is the obvious comparison though and that's a lot better.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): This song is 100% pop filler but I really love it. But compared to his other pop tracks it‚Äôs more lazy but it‚Äôs catchy enough for me to enjoy it.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Yassss another HUGE bop.

**fadedblue09** (10): And finally we have a decent dancepop banger.

**Leixander** (10): Hey king! You have done it again. Constantly raising the bar for us all and doing it flawlessly.

**ManofOranges** (10): It's a hit, your honor.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): what a great pop song!!

**wavingwolves** (10): that kick between the verses and the chorus is magical

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): kinda underrated tbh. this track do be groovy, and catchy.

**jackisboredtoday** (9.5): A

**wardrum5** (9.4): this could've been a smash single

**ariiaaaa** (9): B-O-P bop

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): an underrated bop.

**pisces\_king** (7.9): Very fun.

**ggodisawomann** (7.5): when this picks up, it gets really good and I enjoy it a lot

**sbuhj** (7.2): I got that summertime summertime sadness. Wait, wrong song. Unoriginal, but enjoyable I guess.

**bbfan132** (7): pretty good track but nothing special

**nightjesus** (7): I really enjoy the verses. But like the chorus is taking me a while to get into. I feel like it‚Äôs a song I can grow to love tbh. I really vibe with most of this song.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): what does this mean though

**oliveoilgarlic** (6.5): walked so In Your Eyes could run

**vayyiqra** (6): mid, kinda fillery

**bespectacIed** (5): Nice guy anthem. Cute production but the lyrics kinda miss sew genies thick

**runaway3212** (5): A bit generic, but has some nice moments

**skargardin** (5): max martin did not snap here

**akanewasright** (4): This is the weakest Weeknd/Max linkup I‚Äôve ever heard.

Body positivity for the win!!! This song was actually almost a top 10 song but fell hard towards the end.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A major bop! Probably my favourite non single from the album.

**fishingfor8** (9.5): straight cheese and I love it.

---

**SendMeYourSATScores** (11): the melodies in every single part of this song are freaking perfect only bruno could pull this track off so well i love this song üíï

**bespectacIed** (10): Cursory check at its hot 100 peak, this didn't even enter the top 100 holy shit? Probably my fave song in the album. This a ball of fun and groove. The VS Fashion show performance of this is so lit, made me love the song so much more (yes I'm gay and only watch VS for the bedazzled outfits and sickening wings)

**fadedblue09** (10): It's like the title track, but much smoother (and about as equally as good!).

**ggodisawomann** (10): BANGER

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I remember the performance of this on snl, ugh king

**ManofOranges** (9): This song kinda feels like what you would get if you took one of Bruno's more enthusiastic party songs and dialed it back a bit. It doesn't quite go all the way, still nice though.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): the production on this is so nice

**skargardin** (9): bopp

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): alex i'll take songs that should've been a big hit for $200 please

**1998tweety** (8.5): I like the verses but it loses some steam at the chorus.

**bbfan132** (8.5): super fun track, it doesn‚Äôt take itself seriously and you can just dance/jam to it

**oliveoilgarlic** (8): a bopppppp

**runaway3212** (8): 'Look out, I think Moto Moto likes you'

**vayyiqra** (8): woke body-positive king

**wavingwolves** (8): idk what anything in this song means but it goes off

**sbuhj** (7.8): And now the braggadocious comes in. I don't think that's really the right word. I don't know what is. There's a lot on this album that just doesn't hit me right and for some reason I can't put into words why. It's like, overly sexual in a cocky way?? I may not like the lyrics, but at least the music is good in this song.

**piccprincess** (7.5): chonkie

**pisces\_king** (7.2): On theme, on point, not quite a hit but enjoyable.

**akanewasright** (7): This song is RIDICULOUSLY well produced, but the chorus feels really lazy to me.

**nightjesus** (7): We stan body positivity.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): Ok, this song is stupid. But it‚Äôs fun? Kinda hate the word chunky though

One of the singles, the somewhat low finish is probably because of the emphasis on Abel‚Äôs hip hop side. This song would probably finish higher if this wasn‚Äôt a pop music group rating these albums. 

---

**fishingfor8** (10): 'i'm good i'm good i'm great' has been stuck in my head since this first came out. I think this song is one of his best examples of his signature dark sound transferring well to his new pop eras. The female and chipmunk voices at the very end of the song i really like as well.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Party Monster is another one of the few tracks on here where the Weeknd raps more than he sings. And I think he pulls it off amazingly. This is definitely a slapper and I like Lana‚Äôs part at the end of it as well (more so than stargirl interlude).

---

**bespectacIed** (11): How do I explain that I only gave this an 11 because Yves from Loona made a dance cover of this? Jk, this song is the best song in the rate. I don't think it's gonna win but idgaf. Party Monster is a master class in production, mood-building, and storytelling. Every line in this song is iconic. I know Lana only said two words here but this is the best Abelana collab

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): summary of 2016 popheads | nobody: weeknd: popheads: lana: paranoid popheads: OMG YAS KWEEN SLAY ME KWEEN MY WIG IS GONE!!!!!!

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): as someone who has conservative atheist family, i can‚Äôt think of an easier way to annoy them than by liking this chorus

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): ‚Äúdick game be the meanest‚Äù (oh hi Lana).

**wardrum5** (8.5): I don't like the squeaky baby voice towards the end and I don't know why so many songs do that

**pisces\_king** (8.1): Here's The Weekend's dark side that we are familiar with from After Hours, and it's really amped up.

**ManofOranges** (8): Really love the verses but I don't care for the hook that much. Nor do I really care for Lana's little feature in this song. It just kinda brings the momentum to a halt.

**oliveoilgarlic** (8): at the end of high school not long after this album dropped my friends and I snuck vodka into a school event and when I went to the bathroom I had this stuck in my head so my drunk ass started dancing in the bathroom stall to this song even though the bathroom was completely silent

**rickikardashian** (8): the lyrics are just alright but i love the vibe + the lana inclusion

**vayyiqra** (8): Cocaine is bad kids don't do it

**wavingwolves** (8): the outro goes off! and oh hi lana

**1998tweety** (7): This is alright, I like the ending.

**bbfan132** (7): the chorus sounds lazy at times but the song is decent

**bulforster** (7): I normally hate this kind of dreary song but his voice here has an urgency to it that keeps me engaged. It is a bit repetitive though.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): Macaulay Culkin could NEVERüò∂

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): i want to be obsessed with this song bc it starts so well but then it doesn't finish as strong

**sbuhj** (6.6): Gives me T-Pain vibes. It's a good song, but not very memorable or original. I had it at a 7 but then it went on too long.

**runaway3212** (6.5): It feels a bit repetive, but has some nice moments

**akanewasright** (6): I completely forgot that Lana was on this song.

**ariiaaaa** (5.5): this is a bold move for a second track and I'm here for it, but it kinda sounds dated

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Generic and super one-note. Also the vocal effects here are super grating.

**ggodisawomann** (5): I am sleep, I don't like the weird vocal effects at times. this really just sounds like a terribly generic Weeknd song with some bubble noises mixed in

**nightjesus** (4): It‚Äôs super repetitive. Like not in a good way. I got bored after the first verse. I hope this whole album isn‚Äôt about waking up next to bitches that he doesn‚Äôt know the name too.

More cheating, this time Charlie is the third person in the scenario. It plays a bit differently than his other songs, which I think might be why it finished a bit higher than some other Charlie songs. The production and melody also really helps carry this song this high, making it a favourite deep cut for most.

---

**fishingfor8** (10): You can‚Äôt convince me that Charlie has never cheated on someone he‚Äôs dating, he has too many songs about it.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Why did I only notice on this listen the song was about cheating....anyway I think it‚Äôs another great song and definitely quite a steamy song.

---

**sbuhj** (11): Starboy makes a strong case, but this song is getting my 11 for three reasons. First, it properly wraps up an incredible album. This is what all the development on this album was leading up to. Second, the lyrics, production, and style come together to perfection. The sexual innuendos work, the beat is strong, and Charlie's voice is strong but not overpowering. Third, this song has a seasonal feeling. I think about this song and listen to it every summer, and it gets me in the mood.

**bespectacIed** (10): This is so good, holy shit????? I am humbled by how good this album is, seriously. I was expecting mediocrity all throughout but he kept delivering. That bassline is killer. Highkey the best song in the album

**ggodisawomann** (10): so underrated.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): honestly what a great pop song

**TiltControls** (10): The fact that Charlie Puth can go from making 'sex anthems' like Marvin Gaye and then release something as smooth as this is still one of the most surprising (in a good way!) music transformations I've ever seen.

**pisces\_king** (9.8): Another major win for him is 'Empty Cups.' The chorus works so well in that it's not too heavy, well-paced and fits perfectly. The breakdown/bridge is wonderful.

**1998tweety** (9.5): This deserved more, big bop.

**bigbigbee** (9): It took people on r/popheads raving about this for me to realize that it was good. Thanks for showing me the light.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): bopping

**nightjesus** (9): I‚Äôm against cheating. But damn you can‚Äôt deny this song isn‚Äôt it.

**skargardin** (9): bopp

**akanewasright** (8.5): This is the best deep cut on this album by far.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): This is the only song of Charlie‚Äôs that I actually bought the whole ‚ÄúCool Player Boy‚Äù schtick. Should‚Äôve been a single lol

**kaanew** (8.5): this bass... whew!

**Leixander** (7.5): Another complete reversal from a previous song situation, this time he is trying to convince a girl to cheat on his boyfriend with him. Starts off nice but I am not a fan of the last one and a half minute.

**bbfan132** (7): cute little bop

**fadedblue09** (7): I guess it's decent? I'm just struggling to write anything at this point.

**ManofOranges** (7): This is a cute little ditty, that's it!

**runaway3212** (7): We're you not talking about how much cheating sucks?

**wavingwolves** (7): "turn on that television so no one can listen"? ok but what y'all watching? imagine having sex to the news or something

**hunnybee12** (6.5): the lyrics read like a bro country song idgi

**ariiaaaa** (6): I wanna like this song less than i do, the lyrical content is kinda...

**vayyiqra** (6): kind of slaps but dumb lyrics

**oliveoilgarlic** (5): I keep hearing Tonight Tonight by Hot Chelle Rae over this (also he lifted that ‚Äúhey‚Äù directly from Abel???)

**fix-ur-acrostics** (3): What kind of dumbass writes a song accusing his girl of cheating, and then follows it up with a song about a girl cheating with him?

Only 90‚Äôs kids can like this song (I guess)

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is absolutely one of my favorite deep cuts from the album. This is an excellent pop song and I love the story of him being with an older women (although he says it‚Äôs fictional and didn‚Äôt actually happen).

**fishingfor8** (7): I could see this playing on the sims 4 pop radio station

---

**bigbigbee** (11): Totally get why people wouldn‚Äôt like this. But to me, the instrumental is perfect. The offset downbeat (?) is perfect. It makes me nostalgic for something I didn‚Äôt experience, and it makes me nostalgic for my college years. No one is going to get this reference, but it sounds a little like SHINee‚Äôs Lovesick (v v v good).

**pisces\_king** (11): God this song is so next level. The pre-chorus is top notch, the chorus is perfect, the vocal range is amazing. He also is incredibly self-aware of his boyish demeanor? And yet his ability to still be so sexy? Boo-oo-Oo-OOY! WOOO-OOO-Ooo-O-oo! Vocal masterpiece with perfect production.

**runaway3212** (11): Lyrics on point with an amazing sound, especially the chorus is supreme

**followingfreeways** (10): if every song he made sounded like this he would be much bigger than he is. it's stupid good.

**ManofOranges** (10): So many 10s on this album. I'm confused why the title is in all caps!

**nightjesus** (10): The chorus has me damn boppin. This song is so good. The outro is such an ear worm.

**skargardin** (10): pop perfection i fear

**1998tweety** (9.5): Big bop, I will admit before listening I thought this would be about a MALE love interest so that was disappointing....

**wavingwolves** (9): hey this is great

**kaanew** (8.5): um, hello, bop alert, I majorly missed out on this?

**sbuhj** (8.2): Ironically, the lyrics are childish. However, he succeeds at his stated quest to get me to ask why he's writing a song called BOY. It's good music but not good lyrics.

**akanewasright** (8): A little overhyped, but a bop.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Wait, Charlie had a sugar mommy?????

**ggodisawomann** (8): the goat falsetto in this is real

**ImADudeDuh** (8): an overrated song on the album tbh. The outro also goes on a too long

**jasannn** (8): The funkiness is back after 2 snores.

**Leixander** (8): Charlie get a songwriter challenge...

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.9): this title in caps always makes me think i'll be listening to a kpop song

**bbfan132** (7): the verses are good but the ‚Äúborn in the 90s‚Äù lyric kind of throws me off lol, it sounds out of place

**bespectacIed** (7): It sounds fucking good but this may december love affair shit is kinda cringeeeee. That "You won't wake up beside me/'Cause I was born in the '90s" line made my balls shoot up from cringe. But again, this sounds gorgeous

**oliveoilgarlic** (7): Charlie Puth understands on some level the experience of a masc lesbian coming onto women who are like 30 and getting rejected cause she‚Äôs 21 and they‚Äôre femme4femme only and I respect that

**vayyiqra** (7): Only true 90s kids will remember being a boy in the 90s

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): ok this song is honestly kinda hilarious

**fadedblue09** (5.5): It's a bop, but I cannot take the lyrics seriously coming from him lol.

**TiltControls** (5): A common theme for Charlie Puth is fantastic production and really unremarkable lyrics and this song is the epitome of both

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3.5): It‚Äôs a bit boring, and the born in the 90s lyric got me cringing. It seems like something I would normally like but it feels really hollow and inauthentic. I don‚Äôt hate it but I don‚Äôt get the hype lol. The outdo is clean tho

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): this is kinda bad

Reminder remix lands here at 6. Pretty much everyone agrees while it‚Äôs not bad, it‚Äôs pointless and a remix that is not needed so it is not as good as the original.
---

**ignitethephoenix** (6): definitely an unnecessary remix. It‚Äôs not awful, but I rather just listen to the original. Thugs verse going into The Weeknd‚Äôs first verse is so weird, like it just is weird after listening to the original.

**fishingfor8** (4): This is incredibly pointless

---

**bespectacIed** (10): Mind-blowingly good. it's physically impossible to hate a thugger feature

**ManofOranges** (10): I like Reminder no matter what so this gets a 10 simply because I get to listen to Reminder again. But also the guest verses aren't bad at all.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): example of a remix done right

**1998tweety** (8.5): Better than the og

**pisces\_king** (8.4): This is literally the first time I have heard this. I did not know this even existed. Young Thug kind of gives us T-Pain which is fun. I like A$AP on this.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Didn't really change that much but didn't ruin it either.

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): Marginally better than original.

**fix-ur-acrostics** (7): Can't say no to Thugger.

**kaanew** (6): the original is superior

**skargardin** (6): um.. this exists

**vayyiqra** (6): pensive but not as good like most remixes

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): I like Rocky but this is a downgrade

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5.5): The original is unbothered‚ù§Ô∏è

**bbfan132** (5): meh

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): I knew Reminder would eventually get a remix but eh, this could have been better.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): they improved it a bit but not enough

**ggodisawomann** (4): no this didn't do it for me

**nightjesus** (3): I guess it‚Äôs okay but at this point all the Weeknd songs kinda just blend together.

**wavingwolves** (3): this didn't need a remix with othet rappers i'm sorry

**rotating3Dtext** (1): no

Our first Charlie song is out here (king of the bonus rate I suppose). Overall everyone feels like this is a disappointing lead single and feels incomplete even though there were good ideas in there. Also everyone was sick of the bad boy image and just wanted more fun and mature songs from him.
---

**fishingfor8** (6): This song was such a let down

**ignitethephoenix** (6): This being the lead single from whatever this era was such a bad choice. This is an okay song but it sounds more like a deep cut that a single. Also the gagging noises were a choice lol

---

**1998tweety** (9): Choke my daddy. This is decent but I hate how it edges you near the end and there's no chorus climax.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Oh wow apparently I missed the entire discourse around the "Bad Boy Charlie Puth" era that he scrapped. Kinda glad he dropped this but this song is really good though.

**ggodisawomann** (8.5): trying too hard w the bad boy image however it still goes awf. it ends at a weird spot though and could've benefitted from being longer

**plastichaxan** (8.5): where was this level on the album omg

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): I warned myself not to get too excited when this was a great lead single & he scrapped the album it was meant for after 2 much worse singles so the warning was right

**ManofOranges** (8): This song is like above average but it doesn't make me go "wow!" I will also admit that I don't like the choking sound bite, ya'll know the one. It's just like a disruption to the song.

**rickikardashian** (7.5): Charlie trying to go all dark is still confusing. Just accept your the boy next door looking guy with nice thighs and move on

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6.8): if this had a stronger bass or something in the background i'd be in love

**bbfan132** (6): lmao this is so tacky but i enjoy his voice so

**cremeebrulee** (6): that choking noise uhm is a choice

**kaanew** (6): overall not bad but the choking noise is a choice... it sounds more like a gag tbh

**pisces\_king** (5.8): I don't really know what this was.

**fix-ur-acrostics** (5): This is basically an entire song of buildup to nothing.

**oliveoilgarlic** (5): throwback to this sub suddenly lusting after Charlie Puth bc of this single cover

**skargardin** (5): an attention rehash

**vayyiqra** (5): this is okay but go away Charlie

**ImADudeDuh** (4): when someone tells me to do I Warned Myself in karaoke but expects me to do everything charlie does in the song https://tenor.com/view/rpdr-raja-im-not-gagging-drag-race-shade-gif-17394766

**wavingwolves** (4): this is so muted and it packs no punches... idk not a fan

**fadedblue09** (3.5): I‚Äôm using YouTube to listen to this (and the other bad-boy songs) cause I really don‚Äôt want this showing up in my Last.fm. Anyway, this is just so boring and overdramatic lol.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3.5): the throat noises...no?

**bespectacIed** (3): meaty okra

**nightjesus** (2): Charlie it‚Äôs okay to have other producers give their opinion. I feel like this song had potential. Why did he keep the choking gross sound oh god.

Definitely one of the more memorable tracks on the album. Also TIL it was supposed to be a country song at one point.

---

**fishingfor8** (9.9): The production is crisp, the verses are solid and there's a great outro to the chorus.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): before Blinding Lights, there was this song which derived inspiration from 80‚Äôs music through the samples it used. This one of the songs from the album I hoped would be a single (along with Die For You) and I‚Äôm glad it was chosen as one and got a trippy video.

---

**wavingwolves** (11): this is still my favourite track from him, one of my favourite songs from the 10s and definitely the best song in this rate. it never gets old, doesn't matter how much i listen to it, it's just THAT good. a perfect wholehearted banger.

**1998tweety** (10): Yasss keep giving me songs like these, they're so good.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Apparently this was supposed to be a country song before they reworked this. I would love to hear Weeknd sing a country-inspired song someday. This is probably the closest thing to it tho.

**Leixander** (10): The video being a short version of this song is a crime against humanity.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song to me feels like it's in the same vein as Reminder. It doesn't have much bombast to it and yet it grasps me all the same. The instrumentals on this one really stand out to me.

**bespectacIed** (9): banger

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Reading the genius annotations and this was gonna be a country song at first??? WTF

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): i was gonna say one republic outsold but this one kinda also slaps

**vayyiqra** (9): Can we get more funk guitar and nu-disco in this decade please

**pisces\_king** (8.6): Definitely one of the strong tracks on this album.

**oliveoilgarlic** (8): Abel and 80s pop references name a more iconic duo

**rickikardashian** (8): okay but the m this transitions? godly

**TragicKingdom1** (8): a bit overrated because the hook is kinda weak, the sample is awesome though

**bbfan132** (7.5): a pleasant track to listen to but i kind of wish it went somewhere; it‚Äôs pretty repetitive

**ggodisawomann** (7): mmm the intro...tea

**skargardin** (7): it feels like this could pop just a little bit more

**sbuhj** (6.5): See Rockin'. Literally the exact same comments minus the part about Max Martin.

**akanewasright** (6): There‚Äôs something going on here that just makes the whole song not fun to listen to. And like... it‚Äôs not like the song has anything else really going for it. The lyrics are pretty standard date for The Weeknd, and there‚Äôs not a super strong hook or anything.

**bulforster** (6): I have the same issue here as I do with Rockin', he doesn't seem to be able to get into the groove of the instrumental.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): do his vocals in the chorus sound super whiny to anyone else

**runaway3212** (4): This feels like a generic The Weeknd song

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): i have the weird feeling that every one of the tracks up to this point were promo singles

**fadedblue09** (3.5): This is just a sedated version of the previous track. The vocals were super bad here and there was too much unnecessary noise throughout.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): why‚Äôs he going so dEeP

I definitely wonder if it only placed this high because of the remix because from how I remembered it Finesse was not one of the popular ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù on the album. Still pretty good though. 

---

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Look like most other people, I prefer the Finesse Remix. This is still great but Cardi takes this song to another level with her intro verse and her doing the bridge.

**fishingfor8** (6.8): Cardi definitely adds a lot to this song that is desperately needed.

---

**bigbigbee** (10): I‚Äôm interested in seeing how differently the original and the remix score, since IMO they‚Äôre equally good. See my comments on the remix for more details.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is definitely the best song on the album. Glad it got the remix treatment though!

**ggodisawomann** (10): YES YES YES the original is good too! remix was a bit better but people really sleep on the original too much!

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): it sounds like this song is missing something.... hmmm i wonder what it needs

**skargardin** (10): it IS a bop but i'm so used to the cardi version that this just feels off

**1998tweety** (9.5): The song is still good on its own but wow it feels so empty without Cardi.

**rickikardashian** (9.5): after listening to the remix, this feels incomplete without cardi, but the bridge here sounds superior

**pisces\_king** (9.3): Remix is better, but this is the album's best (again, save for its remix).

**bespectacIed** (9): Belcalis made this a 10

**fadedblue09** (9): I still prefer this to the remix.

**kaanew** (9): love this song, with or without Cardi

**nightjesus** (9): This is my favourite song on the album. The Cardi version tho is perfection that I didn‚Äôt know I needed.

**piccprincess** (9): without cardi be a whole -1

**TiltControls** (9): Needed a little something else, like an up & coming rap girl...

**vayyiqra** (9): this is a bop

**wavingwolves** (9): the cardi remix is a 10

**bbfan132** (8.5): the remix outsold

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the fuck is cardi at? WHERE THE FUCK IS CARDI AT? CARDI?! YO CARDI?! Where this bitch at?

**turtle-thief** (8): I'm giving this 10 of a song an 8 cause it really feels empty without cardi. It's like listening to the original Cheap Thrills without Sean Paul, the energy just isn't there.

**wardrum5** (8): Incomplete without Cardi

**sbuhj** (7.9): Once again, the lyrics are a lowpoint. But the music and melodies are very good and each part fits well together.

**akanewasright** (7): I really like this song, but it feels so lifeless without Cardi.

**runaway3212** (7): Not bad just completely outclassed by the remix

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): Belcalis I miss you.

**letsallpoo** (6): this sounds so unfinished now

**ManofOranges** (6): I'd probably give this a 10 if the remix didn't exist. But the remix does exist and the regular version just sounds incomplete without Cardi.

**oliveoilgarlic** (6): it really did need Cardi and her energy

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): i forgot how much Cardi elevates this song

**fix-ur-acrostics** (5): It's fine, but I feel like it could use something else... Oh, I know! An accordion!

**hikkaru** (4): imagine listening to this version ever
