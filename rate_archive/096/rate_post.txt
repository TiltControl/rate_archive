Men's R&B Pop Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/gunubb/mens_rb_pop_rate/

What’s that? \*sniffs the air\* Is that another solo men’s rate? Men, on my popheads????

Yes! We are doing another men’s solo album rate, the first one since the One Direction Men’s solo rate last year at this time (we have rated multiple male led bands though since then so clearly we don’t hate men that much).

Welcome to the Men’s R&B Pop Rate, also known as that rate [u/ignitethephoenix](https://www.reddit.com/u/ignitethephoenix/) ‘s has been submitting various versions of for over a year and was finally popular enough to be considered in a rate cycle. I’m your first-time host, [u/fishingfor8](https://www.reddit.com/u/fishingfor8/) and joining me is the person who did all the actual work, [u/ignitethephoenix](https://www.reddit.com/u/ignitethephoenix/) (Note from ignitethephoenix: fishing actually did all writing on these albums below, I just made playlists and said that popheads hates men)

This rate consists of 3 fairly popular albums from the past few years that all have R&B influenced tracks and sounds, although they are considered pop albums overall.

Starboy - The Weeknd

Returning with a more polished sound and a new haircut, Starboy is the 3rd full album (and 6th official project) from Canadian artist Abel Tesfaye, also known as the Weeknd. Starboy is Abel’s acceptance of the limelight and is best seen through the heavy electronic and pop influences in this album. Helping him with his new sound is EDM producers such as Diplo, Daft Punk and Cashmere Cat, songwriters Benny Blanco and Max Martin and artists such as Lana Del Rey and Kendrick Lamar. Starboy is his celebrity debut, he is no longer the mysterious R&B singer from Canada that made him famous. His music, while still dark, has strong 80s influences and marks a new sound for him where he continues to embrace the pop music side that he started exploring on Beauty Behind the Madness. Starboy went #1 in 7 countries and gave us global hits in I Feel It Coming, Party Monster and the title track. Starboy cemented The Weeknd’s place in the mainstream and was a major landmark for music in the 2010s.

1. Starboy (feat. Daft Punk)
2. Party Monster
3. False Alarm
4. Reminder
5. Rockin’
6. Secrets
7. True Colors
8. Stargirl Interlude
9. Sidewalks (feat. Kendrick Lamar)
10. Six Feet Under
11. Love To Lay
12. A Lonely Night
13. Attention
14. Ordinary Life
15. Nothing Without You
16. All I Know (feat. Future)
17. Die For You
18. I Feel It Coming (feat. Daft Punk)

Voicenotes - Charlie Puth

Yea, no one expected this. After the release of his first studio album, 9-track mind, Charlie Puth had established his place as pop music’s good boy. Because of songs such as One Call Away and Marvin Gaye, Charlie had seemingly pigeonholed himself to be mom music for the rest of his career. That all changed with the release of Attention, the lead single to his second album Voicenotes. Attention introduced the world to a new Charlie. Driven by a killer bass-line and one of the best choruses that 2017 had to offer, Attention was a game changer for him. Despite several delays to the album, Voicenotes finally dropped in May 2017, to widespread critical acclaim and praise from the pop fans and critics alike. Debuting in the top 10 in a dozen countries, Charlie completely changed his image and established him as one of pop music’s most exciting and interesting hit makers through his involvement on all aspects of the album. With the help of songwriter Jacob Kasher and features from Kehlani, Boyz II Men and James Taylor, Charlie Puth gained the respect of the music world and left fans eager to see where he would go next.

1. The Way I Am
2. Attention
3. LA Girls
4. How Long
5. Done For Me (feat. Kehlani)
6. Patient
7. If You Leave Me Now (feat. Boyz II Men)
8. BOY
9. Slow It Down
10. Change (feat. James Taylor)
11. Somebody Told Me
12. Empty Cups
13. Through It All

24k Magic - Bruno Mars

24k Magic is the third studio album from Bruno Mars. Crafted from elements of r&b, soul, funk and new jack swing, Bruno managed to pull together one of the most successful mixes of modern music and retro pastiche in his 2016 album. The album took home 6 grammys at the 2017 awards show and continued Bruno’s streak as one of the most popular artists of the 2010’s. Assisting him on the album are longtime collaborators and friends, Phillip Lawrence and Christopher Brown, providing everything from production and writing credits or background vocals from Lawrence. The album is highlighted by very successful singles, That’s What I Like & 24k Magic as well as other songs like Versace on The Floor or Finesse. 24K Magic is all about a lavish lifestyle that none of us can relate to and yet somehow it works. In an era where music became much more mellow and thoughtful, it’s nice to have this brash pop album be this critically loved and successful. We also chose to add the Finesse (remix) to the main rate because of the song's popularity.

1. 24K Magic
2. Chunky
3. Perm
4. That’s What I Like
5. Versace On The Floor
6. Straight Up & Down
7. Calling All My Lovelies
8. Finesse
9. Too Good To Say Goodbye
10. Finesse (Remix) \[feat. Cardi B\]
