* Expect me to play random commercials as interludes on the plug.dj room. Be it a commercial featuring a musician like Taylor or Beyonce or a trailer of a movie to let my geek card out!

Thank god the song I gave my 0 to is out first. Lana’s songs would never usually bore me to death. This is an exception. My god, I could not even understand what she is singing about…..even though I had the fucking Genius lyrics tab for this song on while I am listening to the song! She sounds exactly like the shitpost link I attached. This song is way too long than it should be. I would think she already skipped to the second verse when she is still singing the first verse. LIKE FUCKING HELL LANA DELETE IT FAT!

Horrified reactions of this song range from **Reifiui’s** comment (“*I'm not sure what she was trying here but please never do it again*”) to **TeamAwesome4’s** comment (“*FUUUUUUUUUUUCK, LANA, PLEASE STOOOOOP! LANAAAA! STOP IT, PLEASE!*”)

**gannade**, a huge Lana (and Miranda) fan, feels bad for not liking the song, explains *“I feel bad for disliking this song considering it’s an artifact from Lana’s first album, but it feels like she’s just singing the same note over and over. She also took a page off of Ariana’s vocal delivery book because I can’t understand a single thing Lana is singing. And if you’re looking for a song about cocaine, Ultraviolence’s “Florida Kilos” is far, far superior.”*

**LandonKidatrea**, who gave a 0 to this song, shades on Lana on his comment on the song, saying “*In the sea of mediocrity known as “Born to Die, I have found Mariana’s Trench.*” (I feel like this comment is more appropriate for God and Monsters and not Yayo? Maybe it’s his formatting? I don’t know.)

**supper_rad** commented *“GAGA IS SHOOK”*. She gave this song a 2.

There are some people who are a bit more forgiving about this song but they still don’t like it. Take an example from **Luxmor** who said “*Not that bad, but quite dull. Maybe good for certain "situations", as it feels quite sensual, but overall a bit too dull for my taste.*” or **alternativeoxygen** who said “*I hate the instrumental for this song, but I appreciate the café lounge music aspect to this song.*” Café longue music isn’t supposed to put me to sleep but okay.

And there are people who are huge fans of this song, for some reason. Like **MrSwearword**, who said ”OK they might be the same melodramatic, Daddy-issue ridden song, but I still jam to it because the overdone production is beautiful.” And one of our biggest Lana stans as well as ‘Best Roaster of /r/popheads’ **throwaway963963963** loves this song to death, commenting “It’s really a shame that slow songs like these are instantly written off as boring. Lana’s voice, dropped to practically whispering at some points, with the slight cracks here and there, manages to exactly communicate that feeling of doting and longing.”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
People were really divided on this song, with much focus on Lorde singing the same lyric over and over again for the most part. Personally, it can be annoying however the production overshadows the lyrics for me, hence a generous score from me. 

Some short positive comments about the song includes a comment from **Awhile2** (*“the weirder the lorde song, the better“*), a comment from **Reifiui** (*“Lorde not even trying in the slightest is still perfection what a queen“*) and a comment from **julry** (*”the fact that this is Lorde’s worst song here and it’s still beautiful”*).

My IRL friend **mrsevans101** talks from a more technical perspective of the song, saying *“tempo and lyrical rhythm make me wanna rate it higher”*.

There are some negative comments about the song but I think we should take the word from the people who gave the song a 0. You have **SkyBlade79** who gave some constructive criticism of the song (*“I mean, I see what she’s TRYING to do, but it’s just so bad. The production is so utterly uninteresting for this type of song, and it’s like impossible to play without skipping through.”*) and then you have **throwaway963963963** who gave a really sarcastic and funny comment (*“Okay so repetition instantly makes you artistic now? It suddenly makes shit meaningful and cultured?? Okay then, qqqqqq. I’m so critically acclaimed. qqqqqqqqqqqq. Buy my albums on iTunes. QQQQQQQ see I have variety. God dammit Lorde.”*)

For some reason, two people decided to connect this song to sex somehow. **OberionSynth** says *“the title of this song sounds like cosmo sex advice”* and **LandonKidatrea** asks *“She’s talking about anal right?”*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comment:** 

*“I won't join your freaky cult, Lorde.”* –TeamAwesome4

I feel like I am like the one of the few people who loved this cover of Bobby Vinton’s song. Her vocals and the production are perfect and made me fell in love with Lana’s take on the song.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** is a fan of the song, saying *“LANA YOU NEED TO STOP LEAVING ME SHOOK WITH THESE STRINGS. This feels kinda more like an interlude but its still nice I guess.”* **batmanji** is impressed, commenting *“this cover captures Lana's style while still being true to the movie version, which isn't easy”*. (batmanji wrote a post here called [“Awarding-Award Winning Pop: A History of the Oscar for Best Song”](https://redd.it/5amlqq) which you have to check out!)

**witchyaf** is fair towards the song, saying *“a perfectly competent retooling of a popular song, and it has a nice lethargy and vibe to it. it's not fantastic, but it's good.”*

**gannade** is not impressed with the cover or any of her other covers for Lana’s other albums, saying *“I’m not convinced that Lana’s great at choosing her covers, as I prefer the originals and her style doesn’t mesh well with the songs.”*

Some negative comments come from **hellomochi**, who gave this song a 0 and left a one-word comment *“yawn”*. Another from **soeri** who said *“im increasingly impressed by lana's skill to ruin perfectly good instrumentals”*. Yikes. And lastly, **throwaway963963963** commented *“Insurance commercials have emotionally impacted me more than this.”*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*“Kinda wanna dress myself in a velvet dress and dance while drinkin expensive champagne”* –**BlasiFeelsSwift**

*“The theme I’ve noticed is that most of Lana’s songs sound like demented Christmas music playing from an old ivory gramophone into a broken home. This is no exception.”* –**joshually**

The duration of the song has been criticized by **Reifiui** (*“Could have gotten a 10 if it was shorter by like 1:30”*), **mirandacrosgrove** (*“unnecessarily too long”*), **supremeshieldon** (*“this song had no right to be this long I mean what even was that final minute?”*) and **batmanji** (*“ok so the song isn't terrible, but putting a 6 minute song at the end of a dragging album like this was an awful idea. I'm so tired”*). Although, most of them (except batmanji) gave nice scores to the song.

**soeri** is sorely disappointed, asking *“how the fuck do you follow masterpiece hypocrates w this boring ass track”* (Keep in mind she probably listened to the UK edition of the album where Fear and Loathing comes on after Hypocrates). **TeamAwesome4** feels like the song is mismatched, commenting *“Well, this was a whole song that had a tone not matching the lyrics. Kind of sad I had to sit through all of this song.”*

On the more positive side of things, **Verdantshade** praised Marina’s vocals in the song, calling the song *“One of Marina's more impressive songs vocally. A grower.”* **SkyBlade79** is another fan of the song and he says that *“This song is pretty good. I get some genuine feels from it, and it didn’t even feel like 6 minutes long; I thought it would just drag on, but it did well.”*

**witchyaf** explains why he likes the song in a more personal note, saying it’s *“another track that i'm honestly super into, and the lyrics speak to a lot of the anxieties i've lived through in my life so it hits pretty close to home for me, and i really love the slow build to it. i think marina really is at her best when she strips away all the affectation and is just honest.”*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Bonus Comments:**

*“Listening to this made me feel like I was going to have to submit my rate by November 2017. Never again.”* - **throwaway963963963**

*“Somehow manages to be even more boring than hypocrates! Marina truly outdid herself.”*–**huntyphobic**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #52 – Marina and the Diamonds – Living Dead (6.173973)

Controversy Score: 2.05986 / My Rating: 8

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NhF6zphSx8) (NSFW)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (10 x1): mother_rucker / (9 x5): sirgingerman, skiddos, Awhile2, Kaphox, Ventriloquy / (8 x5): DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, witchyaf, bluehxrizon, lordpraisewifi, Luxmor


**Lowest Scores:** (3.5 x1): TeamAwesome4 / (3 x7): MrSwearword, justiceisrad, soeri, MeerK4T, throwaway963963963, omgcow, mirandacrocsgrove / (2 x2): huntyphobic, alternativeoxygen / (1 x2): hell0kitt, joshually

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I honestly have no idea what this song is about. But it's a bop

I think the comments from **letsallpoo** (*"Great verses, lolworthy chorus"*) and **Verdantshade** ("*Repetition of words in the chorus gets annoying by the end of the song, which goes on for too long*") basically sums up my feelings towards the song.

**mother_rucker** is a fan of the song's style, commenting *"I'm ~living~ for these 80s synthpop vibes."*.  **Awhile2** is a fan too, saying *"i dont know what electroclash is but this sounds electroclash influenced and i like it"*.

Some people have criticized the repetition of the DEAD DEAD DEAD lyric. I think **gannade**'s comment on the matter is the best *"its quite the bop but i can only take her repeated chanting of dead dead dead dead dead dead so much."*

**skiddos** and **batmanji** really like the song but they have criticized the song's exclusion from the U.S. copies of the album. *"Marina why the fucc did u not include this on the US version"*, **skiddos** complained. **batmanji** would go far as to say the song is *"better than most of the album."*

**havanabrown** decided to use the opportunity to drag Marina, saying *"Doesn't stand out particularly much, sounds like most of her other songs"*. **OberionSynth** has a similar remark, saying *"every day i feel the same" same could be said about the songs on the second half of this album"* **throwaway963963963** decides to join them by saying *"Generic as hell. Marina and the Aluminum Foil."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Bonus Comments:**

*"I'M LIVING DEAD DEAD DEAD DEAD" - Marina stans after the rate* -**Reifiui** 👀

*"Basically, Marina decided to listen to Eurythmics’ Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This), and decided to make an electro remix of it"* -**Raicicle**

*2edgy4me* -**alternativeoxygen**

*"I swear this song added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood because the Draught of the Living Dead put me into a dreamless stupor."* -**joshually**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #51 – Marina and the Diamonds – Valley of the Dolls (6.178767)

Controversy Score: 2.137146 / My Rating: 9

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-TXJMKVa_g)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (10 x4): cameronw73, Reifiui, Kaphox, rudhira_kali_ca / (9.5 x1): soeri / (9 x3) DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, Verdantshade, noideawhatever

**Lowest Scores:** (3 x6): TeamAwesome4, huntyphobic, julry, whatsapilot, lexarqade, zombasteseses / (2 x1): joshually / (0 x1): havanabrown

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Reifiui** said this: *"I'm preparing my tears for when this gets knocked day 1 because my opinions suck.".* Well Reifiui, I hope you had your tissues ready then.

I am really sad that this song had to be out this early as this is one of my favorites from the album. I really like the dark, errie production here the most.

**BlasiFeelSwift** probably has an idea for a creepypasta based on the song:

>"I can see this used in the beginning of a scary film where two creepy twins are walking through a narrow dark corridor with their heads moving slightly to the left.

>The song is so real, everybody wears masla  [I think Blasi means masks?] and I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one afraid that one day you’ll remove your maks [Yeah I think he meant masks?] only to find out that you don’t remember the real you. You’ve faked it way too well and now you can’t come back."

**Verdantshade** complemented the production of the song, saying the *"Instrumentation is much more interesting than the rest of the album. Also really love the darker feel of the song."* **SkyBlade79** feels the same way, he *"like[s] the super-chill instrumental, and the lyrics are very nice. The highs aren’t very high, but the rest is great."*  **MrSwearword** feels like this is a song for Marina's fans, saying *"Lucid and full of depression. She knows her fanbase and made this song for them."*

There were a couple of unimpressed people with the song. **havanabrown**, who gave this song a score of 0, said it's *"So boring that I forgot I was even listening to it"*. Therokinrolla says it's *"The biggest dip of this album. Egh."*

**TeamAwesome4** decided to use irony as his critcism towards the song, *"For a song about downers, this meets every expectation."*. **Raicicle** decides to not only drag Marina, but also Melanie Martinez **AND** Demi Lovato, saying *"It’s usually a mistake to mine 1960s literature for lyrical inspiration, because it’s made the song sound like Melanie Martinez’s long lost poot sister."*

**Lowest Scores:** (3.5 x1): TeamAwesome4 / (3 x3): witchyaf, superr_rad, julry / (2 x2): MrSwearword, zombasteseses / (0 x1): chihuahuazero


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can't get over how the chorus always ended so weirdly for me. I feel like it deserved some rewriting because the "So why is my heart broke?" feels so abrupt and does not do things for me. Other than that, the song is alright.

**gannade** says the song feels like *"A second rate Video Games, but still a good song."*. 

**MrSwearword** feels differently as he thinks the song has not aged well, saying *"Over the years as I’ve listened to the album again, this song does not age well against other Lana songs."*

**havanabrown** feels mixed about the song, saying *"The high(er) notes are pretty but otherwise it's kinda dull"*. **huntyphobic** also feels mixed, saying *"The chorus makes my pussy pop while I cry, but you can keep the rest tbh."*

**chihuahuazero**, who gave this song a 0, offered a solution to Lana's problem in the song. *"We can rebuild him to be better."*

**soeri**, who is not usually impressed by Lana during this rate, was Shook. *"WHY IS THIS AMAZING ASS SONG ON SUCH A SHITTY FILLER-FILLED ALBUM"*

**throwaway963963963** really loved this song, calling it *"underrated when BTD is talked about, I thought it was a cover of an old classic movie theme when I first heard it."* **joshually** is very impressed, he *"love[s] this sultry cabaret-esque torchy ballad and its metaphorical use of excessive money to symbolize the fickle state of those who believe they are in a state of "wholeness", and the subsequent "brokeness" of the heart that results when the deceit and lies are exposed."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Bonus Comments:**

*"I like the brooklyn feel and everything else about it. Why is my heart broke?"* -**SkyBlade79**

*"I like this but i don’t know if it really deserves a 8 or if the wine is making me feel like it deserves a 8"* -**BlasiFeelsSwift**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #49 – Lana Del Rey – Body Electric (6.314384)

Controversy Score: 2.330346 / My Rating: 7

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NA86aAMvY)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (10 x4): sirgingerman, justiceisrad, letsallpoo, BlasiFeelsSwift / (9.5 x2): BionicFunhouse, , SkyBlade79 / (9 x6): Kaphox, noideawhatever, huntyphobic, OberionSynth, yatcho, candyninja32

**Lowest Scores:** (2 x1): zombasteseses / (1 x1): MrSweaword, soeri, TeamAwesome4, eykitsa / (0 x1): Mudkip1

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I feel like I am the only one who really likes the beginning of the song where she sang "Elvis is my daddy/Marilyn's my mother/Jesus is my bestest friend". It's honestly iconic to me. Other than that, the song is okay.

**Therokinrolla** complemented the song as *"perfectly sensual and the guitars actually slay"*. **havanabrown** said something similar, saying *"That guitar strum in the chorus gets me every time"*. **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** also feels the same way, saying *"I love that guitar riff, makes this song sound so sinister"*

**letsallpoo** declares "this [as a] Walt Whitman ANTHEM." although he adds "'drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight' is lowkey the worst line of all time"

**gannade** is getting some Halsey teas from this song, saying *"The verse’s lyrics remind me of Halsey’s “New Americana” in that it seems to just name drop old icons for the sake of it or to appeal to hipsters born in the wrong generation. The chorus is repetitive, and the production brings nothing new."*

**MrSwearword** really does not like the song at all, remaking that *"If it weren’t for “National Anthem”, THIS would win the crown of Lana’s worst song ever. If Elvis is your daddy, don’t open the bathroom door; if Marilyn’s your mother, that’s not candy in her hands; if Jesus is your bestest friend…he left and said he’s coming back someday. Lying ass."*

**TeamAwesome4**, who had the displeasure of listening to Lana most of the time for this rate, begged "LANA, PLEASE STOP BEING LANA. Adding a repetitive chorus onto your boring voice and songs, Jesus, please just stop!" 

Even one of our resident Lana stans is not impressed as **throwaway963963963** writes "You know when you meet someone really attractive, but then they start talking and it’s like..bye. That’s essentially this song and it’s lyrics.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Bonus Comments:**

"This is a song and it happens to be in Lana Del Rey's discography" -ExtraEater (He makes several comments like this to some other songs. It's just this one made me laugh out loud)

She's saying a bunch of nonsense, but it sounds so beautiful." -BionicFunhouse

"Jesus is my bestest friend." I thought the Pepsi thing was the most hilarious thing from this album. CLEARLY I was wrong." -LandonKidatrea

**Lowest Scores:** (2.5 x1): SkyBlade79 / (2 x2): joshually, booooam / (1 x2): Batmanji, huntyphobic 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The songs has a really nice production but nothing else about this song stands out to me at all. I am surprised this got a lot of love from some of the people who participated on the rate.

All three people who gave their 11s to this song gave their reasons why. **JoshuaReddit** simply stated *"These lyrics speak to me"*. 

**TeamAwesome4** said that *"This was much needed. In an album full of cynicism and fantasy, this song comes through saying "I'm comfortable being myself as well", which is something that really endears people to pop stars. Bops can only get you so far."* 

**soeri** has the most personal reason saying that *"this song makes me bawl my eyes out every single time. It reminds me of my friends (you say love is just not that easy), the way I abandoned religion (I'm sick and tired of all your preaching), my ex (you're the only one who can make me, who can break me, down into a young girl) and finally, myself (yeah, you played the martyr for so long, that you can't do anything wrong). It is absolutely perfect."*

**hellomochi** *"Love[s] the sad feels in this. It sounds like it could be the theme song of a 90s teen drama series (like Dawson's Creek)"* **BlasiFeelSwift** remarked that this song *"feels like that rant you always rehearsed in your head while you were sulking in your room when you were 16 because you just had an argument with you parents and they just didn’t understand. #TooReal"*

**MrSwearword** does not like the song but remains nice on it saying it's *"Boring, but she’s still vocally pleasant."* **SkyBlade79** complained that  *"The rhymes are so basic, and the chorus is just annoying. The production also feels basic."*

**Awhile2** deicdes to take the oppturnity to drag our fellow mod Commas by saying *"is it a coincidence that the worst songs on Electra Heart sound the most like katy perry? I’ll let /u/fuckupsomecommas decide."*

**batmanji** said *"this song will probably go out earlier than it should"*. Well, you're right.

Lana has this really weird obsession with the story of Lolita into her music. I mean, it's weird because the story is literally about a pedophile. Of course, the song does not directly tackle those really taboo themes. But when you directly associate the song with the novel, as well name the song after it, you're bound to have that negative stigma. I really wish this song is godawful so I could give it a 0 but the "HEY LOLITA HEY. HEY LOLITA HEY." lyric is very infectious that it's hard not to sing it out loud.

**alternativeoxygen** feels similar regarding the song saying  *"I'm sorry but this song makes me uncomfortable. I just keep thinking about the novel lolita"*

**gannade** says the *"song is typical Lana, with the hard beats meeting a rapid fire innocent childlike vocal delivery. It is catchy but it’s nothing new. And we know Lolita is one of your references, Lana. You don’t need a song telling us that."*

**throwaway963963963** is probably pretty ashamed about this song as a Lana stan when they said this *"Shoutout to all you Lana haters!!...I see what you mean."*

**soeri** feels *"too vanilla to enjoy this song. The instrumental is dope, though."* **witchyaf** said that this is *"the liveliest song lana's ever recorded. lyrically it's a bit............ immature, which i guess is the point, but meh."*

**SkyBlade79** likes the song and would call this song *"One of the best songs on BTD imo. It’s nice and upbeat, I absolutely love the production, and even though the subject matter is a bit, um, weird, I think the rest outweighs that. The chorus is soooo catchy and the drums go hard."*

**Look_A_Fangirl** said  *"This isn’t as bubblegum poppy as the name would suggest. Enjoyable as hell."* Lastly, **mahiro** complemented the production, calling it *"standout production on this one."* 

On an unrelated note, **Awhile2** and **MrSwearword** think alike on why Lana hasn't been hired yet to write a James Bond theme song. With **MrSwearword** perfectly summarizing their thoughts *"Exhibit A Lana needs to be commissioned for a fucking 007/Bond theme song already."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"This is a song about a certain subject."* -**ExtraEater**

*"tbh delete this."* **-superr_rad**

*"A problematic subject matter being discussed and makes me feel fundamentally uncomfortable."* -**joshually**

*"BOIIIIIIIIII I stan for this song so hard - if it doesn't make top 20 I'm banning myself"* That is **superr_rad**, who gave this song an 11. Uhhh, so, do you want me to ban you or something?

I have very few things to say about this song. It's so boring that this one was my contender for my 0. The demo for this song is way better than the final product. If we are scoring the song by the demo, I would have given it an easy 8.

I would never compare this to Taylor Swift's The Lucky One. So I have people writing that for me instead! **letsallpoo** just simply said *"Red did it better!"* My fellow Swiftie **soeri** thinks the song *"plagiarized the actually good "The Lucky One" by Taylor Swift-sus. i'd give it my 0 but i already gave it to off the races.".* (Should we tell them about how Taylor might have plagiarized Without You for Wildest Dreams? 👀 Or should we tell them that Born To Die was released first before Red? 👀)

**Verdantshade**, who gave this song an 11 admits it's *"Cheesy but I'm a sucker for romantic songs. Gave it my 11 because it'll probably be out on the first day."*

**witchyaf** really likes the song, saying they *"never actually heard this song before. it's pretty good, and surprisingly sweet and genuine coming from lana."* **SkyBlade79** also likes the song, saying it's *"A pretty good closer. It sounds like a great movie soundtrack."*

**huntyphobic** feels eh on the song, saying the song is *"Cute but it doesn’t blow me away"*

**Ventriloquy** noticed this song is *"a bit too similar to other tracks on the album."* **joshually** is not a fan of the song at all, commenting that *"Her falsetto makes me cringe so hard. "*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"That was a slightly pleasant way to burn 4 minutes."* -**TeamAwesome4**

*"This song is one synthesizer from being a thot banger."* -**chihuahuazero**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sadly, despite different deciminals of 9s for this song, it's out this early in the rate. This song is a grower for me, I used to perfer the cover performed by Jessica Lange in American Horror Story: ~~Glee~~ Freak Show but I very much prefer the original now because it's still Lana's song. Besides who the fuck would sing about Jim Morrison in the 40s? I know this shouldn't be a big deal but fucking Ryan Murphy and him trying to shove his Glee agenda on his other shows. I think we can all agree that Freak Show sucks.

On the topic of American Horror Story, **havanabrown** says *"Everytime I hear this song I think of AHS."* **JamesTheGent** says *"Jessica Lange did it better."* Maybe if Jessica Lange sings it without her bad German accent, then sure. **Luxmor** praised Jessica Lange's cover of the song, commenting *"Jessica Lange did a good cover of it! But the original still slays*." 

**julry** likes the song, saying the song is *"better than half the songs on the actual album"*. **Therokinrolla** says the song gives them chills, saying *""'God's dead, I said, "Baby that's alright with me.' Is yet another one of my favorite lines of all time. Seriously, gives me chills."*

**sirgingerman** is mixed about the song, saying it's his least favorite song from Lana but then adds that the song *"still makes me wanna get fucked by a drug lord in hell though."* **alternativeoxygen** felt like the song fell flat in some areas, saying *"this song kinda fails at being edgy, but the chorus is bangin."*

**MrSwearword** is not a fan of the song at all, saying *"When Lana songs miss, they miss HARD."* **TeamAwesome4** is sorely disappointed, asking *"Who let the most infamous under-singer in the whole business sing a song called "Gods and Monsters"? I saw this and briefly hoped it would have some kind of power to it, only to be disappointed."* **ExtraEater** feels the same way, saying *"a song called "Gods & Monsters" can be this boring. Just like how an album called Born To Die can be this boring after the first few tracks.*

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #44 – Marina and the Diamonds - Buy The Stars (6.50411)

Controversy Score: 2.240501 / My Rating: 6.5

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCjJyiqpAuU)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (10 x9): cameronw73, cloudbustingmp3, throwaway963963963, JamesTheGent, JoshuaReddit, noideawhatever, whatsapilot, Ventriloquy, eykitsa / (9.5 x1): rudhira_kali_ca / (9 x4): Verdantshade, Cryomatic, sjoors, alternativeoxygen


**Lowest Scores:** (2.5 x1): Look_A_Fangirl / (2 x1): joshually / (1 x1): MrSwearword / (0 x1): Vaktmeister

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow, so many tens for this song. I like the piano part of the song, as well as Marina's vocals. Sadly, the lyrics are very lackluster that it's hard to replay this song very often.

**soeri** is confused, asking *"did i have a regina spektor track in the queue? the fuck is this"* **MrSwearword** is really bored with this track, commenting *"Boring piano ballad that I forgave some tracks ago or something. MAKE IT STOP."* **TeamAwesome4** shades the entire song by saying *"This is white noise for nearly 5 minutes."* **Look_A_Fangirl**, a usual ballad fan is disappointed, commenting *"I love piano tracks and ballads, but I’m just not feeling this one. Also, who buys stars anymore."*

There are people who are more mixed about this song. **SkyBlade79** noticed something about how Marina sang the song, commenting *"The thing about Marina trying to make an empowering song is that she has the most pompous voice ever, so it all sounds sarcastic."* **hellomochi** thinks this is a beautiful song but noticed *"she's trying to be Florence Henderson here."*

**Verdantshade** said it's a *"Pretty song. Background vocals work very well."* **batmanji** likes the song, adding that *"it's a ballad but it's still upbeat. it has a simple production but all of the pieces work well together"*

**BlasiFeelsSwift** feels very emotional about the song, screaming *"STOP KILLING ME WITH THESE LYRICS PLEASE, WRITE DUMB LYRICS PLEASE".* **throwaway963963963** loves the song very much, advising everyone to *"Get on your laptop at 3AM. Pull out your tissue box. Whip out your earphones. And ugly cry for 20 minutes while playing this song on repeat."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"marina you can't buy stars wtf false advertising #JusticeForNASA"* -**OberionSynth**

*"Buy Emotion: Side B on iTunes"* -**mirandacrocsgrove**

*"Now I think about it, basically half of Marina’s songs are just variations on Forget."* -**Raicicle**

*"For my parent's anniversary gift one year, I convinced my brothers to go in on a certificate naming a star after them. Now I realize what a waste of money that was."* -**joshually**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I see that this cover of the song of The Replacements is part of the themes that Pure Heroine tackles on but this is honestly too boring. Lorde's vocals are nice tho.

**laalic**, who gave this song a 0 echos my opinion in a more harsher way by simply commenting *"PAINFULLY boring."*

**huntyphobic** said the song is *"a terrible way to end a great album"*. **Look_A_Fangirl** disagrees, saying that it's *"A great closer, bringing the slowness of the end to a final, more slightly upbeat note.".*

**TeamAwesome4** was shocked how dark this cover is but praised Lorde, commenting *"it shows Lorde has much more perspective than I gave her credit for throughout the rest of the album."* **havanabrown** likes the cover, saying *"its pretty to hear a more stripped down song with her voice"*

**ExtraEater** preferred the cover over the original *"but only because it doesn't have those country-esque guitar chords."* **sirgingerman** loves the cover so much that he says that *"She literally takes this song and makes it her own thing."*

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** praised Lorde's cover of the song, saying that *"the instrumentation sets up the moody atmopshere so well. A gem at the end of the deluxe"* **witchyaf** is surprised to discover that it's a cover because *"lyrically it sounds completely like lorde. i really like this song a lot. even though sonically it doesn't seem to change a lot, her voice and delivery are so engaging that i don't even mind. long story short: lorde is a next-level badass and we never deserved her"*

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #42 – Lana Del Rey - Bel Air (6.571233)

Controversy Score: 2.154096 / My Rating: 7.5

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCqRmx3Dnw)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (10 x5): Verdantshade, cloudbustingmp3, omgcow, rudhira_kali_ca, yatcho / (9.4 x1): BionicFunhouse / (9 x8): spacebabe27, cameronw73, Awhile2, SkyBlade79, hell0kitt, whatsapilot, PuggleMaster, alternativeoxygen


**Lowest Scores:** (3.5 x2): TeamAwesome4, ThereIsNoSantaClaus / (3 x3): havanabrown, throwaway963963963, 3rdattemptusername / (2 x1): zombasteseses / (1 x1): letsallpoo

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the disaster that is Yayo and how much of the Paradise EP is not even close to Born To Die's quality upon re-listening both projects for the rate, Bel Air is a beautiful song and what a better way to close the EP with this song.

**MrSwearword** said *"She might barely be singing, but it’s subdued Lana vocals that aren’t the worst thing ever."*  **joshually** likes the song, saying it's *"A gorgeous piano-driven sweepingly beautiful ballad, with haunting harmonies."* **rudhira_kali_ca** is completely suprised by the song and said *"it is absolutely goddamn beautiful."*

**gannade** simply said *"I forgot this song even existed."* **mother_rucker** thinks Lana not singing it would be a better song, saying *"The instrumentals are so lovely and I think it would be a better song without Lana singing at all tbh."*

**soeri**, who has been dragging Lana while listening to the album, feels very generous, saying *"i'm giving it a high score because finally this shitty ass album is over".* **TeamAwesome4** feels the same way, *"Thank god this last stretch is over."*

**SkyBlade79** likes the song so much he decided to rap the Fresh Prince of Bel Air theme song as his comment but with lyrics changed to how much he likes the song.

*"Now this is a story all about how/ my weave got flipped, turned upside down/ and I’d like to take a minute just sit right there/ I’ll tell you why I like this Lana song called Bel Air!
In big city vibes this song was born and raised/ but on the same time it’s subtle, unlike most of Del Rey’s/Chill to the max, but strong, yeah too/and the song is great for concentrating at school/when a couple of songs on BTD are no good/this harmony is great and gets me shook/and the orchestra instrumental, that’s great, textbook!/and that, my friends, is why I like the fresh song of Bel Air!"*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"hey shaun ross."*  -**witchyaf**

*"not as fresh or as prince-y as i expected"* -**OberionSynth**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #41 – Lorde - Still Sane (6.587671)

Controversy Score: 1.982713 / My Rating: 6

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jmJI3i3h2s)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (10 x): sirgingerman, JamesTheGent, Raykel, eykitsa / (9.5 x): witchyaf / (9 x3): justiceisrad, Mudkip1, mahiro


**Lowest Scores:** (2.5 x1): batmaji / (2 x1): joshually / (1 x1): Kaphox


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the song began with "Today is my birthday." I was expecting a lot. I ended up being disappointed. It's an alright song I guess but not something I would listen to very often compared to the other songs on Lorde's album.

**SkyBlade79** doesn't like the song and thinks *"The post-chorus is dumb, and there really aren’t any high points in this song"*

**laalic** likes the song but feels like *"something about it seems kind of unfinished."* **havanabrown** finds *"The vocals were a bit boring but I liked the xylophone thing or whatever that was"* **ExtraEater** feels like the *"song feels weird. The verses are meh but the chorus is perfect instrumentally and great lyrically."*

**sirgingerman** loves the song, saying it's *"Probably in my top 3 of favorite songs off here. The production is so simple yet so beautiful.".* **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** also loves the song and he loves the *"dark synth on this song, especially the hook. The alternating Lorde vocals on the verses fits really well too. The drums near the end of the song go pretty hard ngl"*. **witchyaf** is a fan, commenting *"i love the simple keyboard notes in the chorus, and how brilliantly she's able to dismantle the concept of her own fame."* **throwaway963963963** commented that *"even though it’s a vulnerable song, it defies the cliche by being positive and well-collected."* 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"All work and no play" is never something to aspire to. People are people, not labor."* -**TeamAwesome4**

*"I feel like I wouldn’t be “Still Sane” if I had to listen to this on repeat for a long time."* -**Look_A_Fangirl**

*"even my least favorite lorde songs are so much better than your fave's"* -**OberionSynth**

*"Like a mournful funeral procession... for her own career."* -**joshually**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #40 – Marina and the Diamonds - Sex Yeah (6.593151)

Controversy Score: 2.427162 / My Rating: 8.5

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8ZF_R_j0OY)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (10 x7): sirgingerman, TeamAwesome4, Kaphox, throwaway963963963, noideawhatever, whatsapilot, Ventriloquy / (9.6 x1): yatcho / (9 x5): soeri, Awhile2, ExtraEater, Cryomatic, timothy444

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As much I love this political bop and no matter how many of the comments about this song say that Marina is the queen of feminism or invented feminism, I feel like the execution of the themes Marina wanted to talk about in this song is not entirely perfect. I think **mother_rucker**'s comment on the song sums up how I feel about some certain parts of the song. *"I appreciate some of the message of this song, but I think it crosses into "policing women's sexuality" territory. Maybe I'm showing off my "ass-ets" because I want to, Marina."* Other than that, this song did a very good job calling out on the gender norms of our society so I can easily forgive the one huge flaw part of the song's message.

**Raicicle** is confused, saying *"he can’t really tell whether that intro is the best or the worst thing I’ve ever heard."* 

**BionicFunhouse** is usually a fan of* "social commentary, but I'm a little meh on this one."* **SkyBlade79** doesn't like the song at all, commenting *"She just looks like a complete preachy bitch on this song. It’s not unique at all except for the “society is so bad hurr durr”, and she really doesn’t seem self-aware."* **witchyaf** feels like the song fell flat in the message it's trying to send, saying *"i guess it's fun and marina's really good at that winking like, "let me say sex 75 times in the intro to grab your attention and then maybe actually attempt to make a point?" but i'm not sure that point ever got made."*

**spacebabe27** is mixed about the song, they* "wish the lyrics left a bit to the imagination because they are so overtly political, but the song itself is pretty good"* **TeamAwesome4** mostly loves the song, saying *"This song is goddamn fantastic, and would get an 11 from me if there was a better way of presenting "Cause all my life I've tried to fight what history has given me", because the melody starts dragging heavily there.*

**superr_rad** is a fan of the song, commenting *"Well, it's definitely Tumblrcore! But it gets extra points from my feminist ass"* **whatsapilot** loves the song, saying the song is *"calling shit on gender norms AND it’s catchy af. What’s not to love about this?"* 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"Makes me want to sing, dance and rejoin Tumblr simultaneously."* -**throwaway963963963**

*"This song mentions sex more then a popheads general discussion thread."* -**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**

*"sexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsexsex"* -**batmanji**

*"I wanted to give this song a 6.9 for jokes but it’s way better than that."* -**Look_A_Fangirl**

*"Really awkward to have this on blast when riding public transport."* -**Ventriloquy** (Well, try blasting out CupcakKe on public transport. Now that's really awkward.)

*"Beyond just being a bop i feel like this is one of the few songs on the rate that has a point to make besides "im sad" and "fuck me daddy", even if the chorus is just sex times 8"* -**yatcho**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #39 – Lana Del Rey - Carmen (6.645205)

Controversy Score: 2.022276 / My Rating: 9 (It's supposed to be 10, but it's too late to change my score now)

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq1b2txZNO8)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (10 x4): MrSwearword, soeri, noideawhatever omgcow / (9.5 x1): Therokinrolla / (9 x5): DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, Reifiui, throwaway963963963, mrsevans101, candyninja32


**Lowest Scores:** (2.5 x1): batmanji / (1 x1): zombasteseses / (0 x1): TeamAwesome4

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is simply one of my favorite songs on Born To Die that I don't know why the hell I only gave this song a 9. Oh well, I can't change the score now, even in my rate. Anyway, what makes this my favorite song on the album was the storytelling aspect of the song, backed with the dark, tragedy vibe of the production. Fuck, this reason alone is why I regret not giving this song my 10.

**SkyBlade79** commented that *"The tone of this song is so sad, and the production is real good on this one. Good, real good."* **Therokinrolla** loves Camen, commenting that *"When she changes voices in the chorus is so beautiful just omg pls slay me."* **soeri** is even slayed by the song, even saying it *"reminds me of Janelle Monaé's work in The ArchAndroid and the 2nd half of Electric Lady. Too bad it's in such a shitty album."* 

**Verdantshade** admits that *"While it feels like Lana re-uses the same formula for all the songs on Born to Die, it WORKS."* **Ventriloquy** expected more from the song, saying it *"Doesn’t go as hard as it could, the chorus is kind of a let down; lyrics are 👌 tho"*

**gannade** commented that Carmen is *"The weakest song on the standard edition. It doesn’t bring any new sounds to the table, and even worse, the song validates critics’ claims of Lana’s “inauthenticity.” It’s obvious that the Carmen in the song is really just Lana’s own persona, and she’s spelling it out for her fans. She crams a lot of her motifs in this song – red dress, New York, drugs, a girl that likes getting trouble, even a literary reference to A Streetcar Named Desire – all to no effect. A lot of Lana’s charm comes from the mysteriousness of her character; do you really know the girl in “Born to Die” or “Video Games?” Maybe you do, maybe you don’t, but you definitely know Carmen."*

**TeamAwesome4**, who gave this song a 0, is really annoyed by the song and the message of it. *"This is the first time Lana has any real sense of the gravity of anything, and it's far too sudden. It took me to a really dark place that I struggled for quite a while trying to get out of. If I never hear this again, it will be too soon. She mixes in terrible warnings along with the images of glamour and it gets horrifically muddled, at least in my mind. Given the context with the rest of this album, this song could be legitimately dangerous. Yes, I understand that it's trying to warn people about her situation, but you cannot have the chorus mention no negatives, and only talk about how people love her. When you take aim at real issues like this, you can't afford to be this sloppy."* **Look_A_Fangirl** feels similar, saying the song has *"Too many contradicting lines."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"Je suis très offensé que Lana s'approprie ma culture natale dans cette chanson"* -**Reifiui** ([Here is a conversation between me and Kaphox when I asked him for a translation of this comment.](http://i.imgur.com/U0Dko4I.png))

*"I used to knew a Carmen. She was a bitch. End of the story."* -**BlasiFeelsSwift**

*"This is a fitting tribute to Beyonce's cinematic debut masterpiece "MTV's Carmen: A Hip-Hopera", a modern urban remake of the tragic opera classic by Georges Bizet."* -**joshually**

This song is a bop and so patriotic. But is it just me when Lana sang "Hell yeah that guy can sing!", it feels super sarcastic? Just me then? Okay.

**gannade** finds the song *"A catchy and relaxing song, but it’s nothing that Lana hasn’t done before, or better."* **MrSwearword** says the song is *"A touch boring against other Lana songs but I still love this song quite a bit."* **letsallpoo** commented *"Possibly the most Lana song possible"*

**SkyBlade79** says it *"reminds me of closer with the lyrics but actually good"*. How dare he to associate Lana with fucking Closer?????  **joshually** has a theory about what the song is about and he says it's about *"A brutal thesis on the nuclear family and a moribund scrutinization of that ever elusive American dream and the resulting exposé of its empty promises, ugly truths and unpretty carnage."* Shit, stay woke up fam.


**soeri** says *"the instrumental is dope but the lyrics are so boring ugh"* **TeamAwesome4** also likes certain parts of the song but not the rest, saying "The sigh's on the chorus are great. The rest of it is not." **Verdantshade** has a similar opinion, *"Chorus is great. The rest of the song, not so much."*

This song is such a bop. I even like the breakdown on the bridge! When will your faves make a happy-sounding, upbeat song about being a loner?

**Luxmor** likes the song, saying it's a *"Very unique sound, super catchy, super fun, great overall."* **huntyphobic** loves the song, commenting it's *"Campy and catchy, I love this song"*.

Some people wished this song was on the standard edition. **superr_rad** said *"damn shame this wasn't on the standard version!"* **yatcho** thinks this *"song shouldve kicked out some of the filler on the main album."*

**hellomochi** pledges her loyalty to Lorde by saying *"It's a good song, but I'd rather be a member of The Love Club."*

**MrSwearword** feels like he heard a similar song from Marina about this, commenting *"WE GET IT MARINA. You hate TV/renounce all chances for fame in the U.S."* **spacebabe27** feels a bit confused on the song's production, asking *"why is the tempo so oddly sped up"*. **batmanji** has the same sentiment, commenting *"I really hate the beat in this song"*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"how do i leave the lonely hearts club plz send help"* -**OberionSynth**

*"Best way to describe this song is that it’s like a shitty Christmas. Unpleasant, but still festive."* -**throwaway963963963**

**Highest Scores:** (11 x1): Look_A_Fangirl / (10 x5): cameronw73, mother_rucker , OberionSynth, mirandacrocsgrove, eykitsa / (9.5 x2): soeri, skiddos / (9 x7): sirgingerman, BionicFunhouse, Kaphox, lordpraisewifi, Raicicle, lexarqade, alternativeoxygen

**Lowest Scores:** (3 x2): letsallpoo, booooam / (2 x2): mrsevans101, joshually / (1 x1): bluehxrizon
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Honestly, this is more of a feminist bop than Sex Yeah tbh. The song's proudction gives the feeling of conflict, which is a perfect for a song that deals the theme of a troubled relationship. The "Yeah, you may be good looking / But you’re not a piece of art" has to be the most iconic line ever.

**Look_A_Fangirl**, who gave this song an 11, asked *"WHY THE FUCK WASN’T THIS PUSHED HARDER AS A SINGLE!!!!!!"* [It was actually released as a single after Primadonna. It flopped harder than both Marina's and Carly's career.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_%26_Control)

**BionicFunhouse** loves how *"Marina is so sinister here, and I fucking love it. Probably my second favorite of the album."* **witchyaf** loves how *"slinky and dark this song is, like imagine a really cool future-tango choreographed to this, it's very confrontational"*

**Raicicle** commented that *"What this song and Primadonna prove is that Electra Heart was actually just better when embraced straight out mainstream pop, rather than care about the intricacies of the concept."* To be honest, I agree with him on this one. I'll get on that later on the final day of my rate reveal where I'll reveal the album's overall average. **mahiro** says it's a *"Solid track. I was expecting more, though."*

**TeamAwesome4** thinks the song's *"production is stellar, but I do not like the lyrics or vocals here."* **Verdantshade** doesn't like the song very much, saying it's *"Forgettable and goes on for a minute too long."* **Joshually** said this song *"is one of those obscure 80s that got away. And it should never have been found."* **SkyBlade79** felt a deja vu moment, *"I swear that I’ve heard this instrumental somewhere else (at least the start of this), but it was actually good in that other song. Sounds like one of Lana’s bad attempts at an upbeat song."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"The fact that she throws ice water all over a really hot guy in the video makes this all the more better."* -**sirgingerman**

*"sounds like something you'd hear at a strip club"* -**soeri**

*"the lyrics (like most of the album) are like something a fake band in a DCOM (Disney Channel Original Movie) would sing, but if it was PG13."* -**julry**

*"Great background music for when you’re living your BDSM fantasies"* -**Ventriloquy**

And this is how you close an album (well an standard edition album)! This is such a perfect closer because it ties the entire album together, even calling out some earlier songs in the album, with a subtle reference to Carmen. The song is perfect both as a closer and its own.

**gannade** basically wrote a thesis about the song, writing *"How has this not become a feminist anthem for our generation? “This is what makes us girls, we don’t stick together because we put love first,” Lana sings, as she reminisces about her heartbreaking teenage years with her best friends. “TIWMUG” is perhaps the only song where Lana alludes to her past, and she uses it to devastating effect to make an insightful point: women don’t let men get in the way of sisterhood. And even through all the romantic mess, Lana still remained friends with her girls. After all, this is what makes us girls, not what makes us women. Yes, it’s a strong contrast to her core persona, but it’s telling that this is arguably Lana’s most personal song on the record. Surprisingly poignant, “TIWMUG” is an anthemic close to the album that leaves us wondering: If this is what makes us girls, then what makes us women?"*

**Therokinrolla** commented *"/r/lanadelrey isn't a huge fan of this song according to my rate but why?? its actually excellent and "Wavin on a train platform, cryin cause I know I'm never comin back" is enough to give me a depressive episode. She is singing about how her parents sent her to boarding school to fix her alcohol addiction and it kills me"*

**TeamAwesome4**, who has been trashing Lana for most of the rate loves this song, saying that *""We don't stick together cause we put love first" is such a fantastic lyric, but the stuff in the verses are typical teenager stuff, not just girls. Otherwise, this song is spotless."* 

**mahiro** loves the lyrics of the song, saying *"man the lyrics in this one are so good, the production needs some tuning though."* **Ventriloquy** wished *"the chorus went in harder, but perfection nonetheless"

Apparently, some of the girls who participated in the rate were not really impressed with the song. **Look_A_Fangirl** simply said 
*"Stereotyped to all hell."*  **superr_rad** said  *"well i guess i'm not a real girl cause this song does not apply to me in the slightest lol"*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"“I listened to that Lana Del Rey record and the whole time I was just thinking it’s so unhealthy for young girls to be listening to, you know: 'I’m nothing without you.' This sort of shirt-tugging, desperate, don’t leave me stuff. That’s not a good thing for young girls, even young people, to hear.”"* -~~Lorde~~ **letsallpoo**

*"petty is what makes us girls"* -**soeri**

*"I was always irrationally annoyed at the part where she claims her friend used to say “Lana, how I hate those guys” like come on Elizabeth you aren’t fooling anybody."* -**throwaway963963963** 👀👀👀

*"I imagine being a drag queen performing dramatically to this song: removing my false lashes, rubbing the pancake thick make up off my face, wiping my lipsticks off the back of my hands, pulling my wig off, undressing from my extravagant outfit and untying my corset, and finally untucking my schlong, timing it perfectly to Lana saying "this is what makes us girls"."* -**joshually**

If you think about it, Diet Mountain Dew is basically Lana's Toxic because what this song and Toxic had in common is that they're about poisonous relationships. Anyway, I can see why this would be considered a filler of the album but this still bops.


**gannade** writes *"The first four songs off Born to Die are essential listens, then there’s “Diet Mountain Dew.” The melody is pretty and catchy, but Lana sings the entire song in her high-pitched Lolita style voice while the instrumentation is noticeably less elaborate and thoughtful as the previous tracks. The end result is monotonous and repetitive."*

**Therokinrolla** says this song is *"definitely weakest song on the album and only a 6.5? The "you're no good for me" is definitely irritating though."* **yatcho** says *"This is a really catchy song but suffers from the worst of BTD: cringy, nonsense lyrics sung in a somewhat annoying way."* **Raicicle**  isn't a fan of the use of the metaphors in this song, saying it's *"Potentially one of the most contrived metaphors written in pop music."*

**OberionSynth** says the song has a *"Catchy bridge, but lacks any standing overall"* **laalic** feels like *"The lyrics are repetitive but somehow it isn't annoying."* **TeamAwesome4** sighs in relief, *"Thank fucking god for this. I mean, it's not good, but at least it's different."*

**SkyBlade79** feels confused about the song's meaning, commenting *"I’m not quite sure what exactly she means by “diet mountain dew”, but I like everything else about this song; the lyrics, her voice, the instrumental."* **Verdantshade** says this is *"the banger of this album. Was hooked from the first time I heard it."* **julry** is very surprised, saying the song is *"so much better than I was expecting from the title."* **chihuahuazero** says this song is *"Lana’s best example of a hip-hop track."*

=====

SkyBlade79: This is really hard to say if we massacred Lana or not. At first glance, it would appear that we did, but when you look at it the majority of the songs are over 6, which is actually really respectful and something we don't see on the other rates.

amumumyspiritanimal: Yeah, Summertime Sadness was a huge song everywhere, and honestly it's a great bop, but Lana counts as a one-hit wonder in many countries. Born To Die for example charted in like 10 EU countries, and they weren't all top 20. Which is a bit sad, because Lana in small doses in amazing, just like the stuff she sings about.
