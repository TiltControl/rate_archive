1. **The scores will be revealed in order from lowest to highest.**
1. **Have a meltdown that your favorite song got placed way too low** in the rate and get sent to the asylum for insanity.

-------------------------------------------------

#[Marina and the Diamonds - Electra Heart](http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/17749/de297332.jpg)


**Marina Lambrini Diamandis** is a Welsh singer-songwriter. Describing herself as an “indie artist with pop goals”, she taught herself how to write songs. Marina chose her stage name as “**Marina and the Diamonds**” as a double word play with her real name since Diamandis is almost similar to Diamonds, as well as referring Diamonds as her fans.


After having some moderate success in the UK with her debut album The Family Jewels, she decided to try pushing herself more into the mainstream market with her second album called Electra Heart.


Electra Heart is a concept album about the titular character, whom she is created by Marina based on the archetypes of Americana girls during the 50s/60s. To accompany the album, she released a 10-part series of music videos called “Archetypes” starting with Fear and Loathing and ending with the unreleased titular track that wasn’t included on the album.  While the album received mixed reviews from critics, the album and the era helped Marina gain a lot of fans.


While Marina didn’t actually get to be on the mainstream market as she had hoped, she is definitely one of the biggest indie-pop acts in the indie music circle, with her latest album release FROOT receiving positive reviews from critics and fans.

#[Lana Del Rey - Born to Die: The Paradise Edition](http://cdn1.umg3.net/89/files/2014/06/Lana-Del-Rey-Born-To-Die-Paradise-Edition-1500x1500-2012.png)


**Elizabeth Woolridge Grant** is an American singer, songwriter and model. Originally aspiring to become a poet and dealing with problems with the release of her debut album, she respelled her stage name from Lana Del Ray to **Lana Del Rey** and changed her record labels to Interscrope and Polydor. She released her second studio album (her first album under major labels) titled Born to Die on January 27, 2012. The album deals with similar themes that Marina’s Electra Heart tackled on, although in a more somber, melodramatic tone.


Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics and her poorly-received Saturday Night Live performances at the time of the album’s promotion, Lana Del Rey has made a name for herself among the current listeners of this generation as well as having her own fan following.


Due to the success of the album, Lana decided to re-release the album titled Born to Die: The Paradise Edition, including new music that fared better with critics. She went on to create a short film titled Tropico to accompany the new material, which uses Body Electric, Gods & Monsters and Bel Air as musical segments.


Years after the release of Born to Die, music websites like Billboard, Complex and NME would later call Born to Die one of the best albums of the decade so far.

#[Lorde - Pure Heroine: Extended Version](http://resources.wimpmusic.com/images/2f6a8365/34eb/4d04/9c72/f5909e36a3c8/1280x1280.jpg)


**Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O’Connor** is a New Zealand singer-songwriter. Having developed interest and skills in drama, public speaking and of course music, she was signed by Universal Music Group (UMG) for development. Ella chose her stage name as **Lorde** because she found royalty and aristocracy a fascinating concept. She found the title “Lord” too masculine and decided to add an e next to it to make it more feminine.


After going through vocal lessons, learning herself how to write, she was set up to work with Joel Little. They would work on five songs for an EP, which took five weeks. This EP would be titled The Love Club. Lorde and Joel Little would later to create more music for Lorde’s debut album.


Royals, the lead single of the EP and the album, became a hit, peaking at #1 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart and it launched Lorde as an overnight sensation that she is today.  She would later release her debut album titled “Pure Heroine” on September 2013.


Unlike Electra Heart and Born to Die which both received mixed reviews, Pure Heroine received critical acclaim from critics, praising the album’s minimal production and songwriting, as well as Lorde’s vocal ability.


As someone young as Lorde who is able to win the Grammys, make great music that is very relatable to the millennial generation as well as being a great person outside of her music, it’s no wonder why she has a huge fan following.
