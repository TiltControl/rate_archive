[RATE RESULTS] Marina v. Lana v. Lorde: Day 2
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5h2vsb/rate_results_marina_v_lana_v_lorde_day_2/

Alright, so much has happened on yesterday's rate reveal!

Everyone thought Marina is gonna get slaughtered but it turns out Lana got slaughtered instead. And /u/batmanji made a potential new friend on the gym yesterday and spilled the tea. Will the long-awaited Marina massacre finally take place today? Will batmanji give us an update? Let's find out today!

I know I said I will start at 5 PM EST like yesterday but I needed more time to finish up the write-ups. So, we'll begin at 6 PM EST instead, so that's an hour from now by the time I created this post. I apologize if this causes some inconvenience.

I will be revealing 23 songs today. I'll resume the reveal from 33 and hit the pause button again at 11, just right for tomorrow where I'll reveal the top 10!

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: While I am still doing the write-ups, let's play a mini-game here while the rate reveal today goes down.

So, want to get my Electra Heart flair?

Just simply predict the songs that will make it to the top 10 by replying to this comment. Whoever has the closest answer gets to have my flair after the end of the entire rate reveal.

No ranking necessary. And you're allowed to edit until we reach #15.

And yes, you need to reply your predictions on this comment. If you comment anywhere else, it won't be counted.

EDIT: If you don't want the Electra Hear flair, you can give it to someone else. Just please PM on who you decided to give it to.

**throwaway963963963** asks me *"I can’t think of anything, Doc could you just copy somebody else’s comment here, it’s not like this song hasn’t dealt with plagiarism before."* I got you. Here's a comment from **superr_rad**'s comment! *"my favorite track off of 1989"*

Of course, a lot of comments I got regarding this song is about Taylor, ranging comments from "When will Taylor ever?" to "Taylor did it better!" To be honest, I didn't get the comparison until someone (I think gannade?) told me to listen to the Without You again. I did and I was like "Okay wow, now I get the comparison. Wildest Dreams jokes aside, this song has a really nice melody and it's refreshing to hear a song from Lana that sounds so happy.

**skiddos** says that he likes *"I like Wildest Dreams a little more."* **huntyphobic** doesn't *"even like her but Taylor’s cover of this song is better than the original tbh."*

In a non-Wildest Dreams comment, **Raicicle** says that *"This is a decent song, but Lana’s voice fundamentally doesn’t hold it up."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"Say you'll remember me, standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset..."* -~~Taylor Swift~~ **BionicFunhouse** and **havanabrown**

*"DAE WILDEST DREAMS???"* -**letsallpoo**

*"I sung the first part of this song in a summer camp karaoke class. I was a small, half-Filipino, middle school boy. With that out of the way, “the dark side of the American dream” describes Lana’s aesthetic accurately."* -**chihuahuazero** (Adding this because Pinoy Pride! Ayyyyy!)

Controversy Score: 1.908456 / My Rating: 10

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYSX51xBkos)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (10 x5): DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, JoshuaReddit, hellomochi, SpanKKy1, eykitsa / (9.5 x1): JamesTheGent / (9 x2): TeamAwesome4, mother_rucker  

**Lowest Scores:** (4.2 x1): mirandacrocsgrove / (4 x4): letsallpoo, Awhile2, MeerK4T, superr_rad / (3 x3): justiceisrad, havanabrown, throwaway963963963 / (2 x1): batmanji


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I never heard of a song that sounds so hypnotic as this. The "dreamy" production blends perfectly with the lyrics that is about people making up lies about themselves. It's just perfect.

**soeri** praised Marina as they think she *"does ambients SO fucking well. I don't know how she managed it, but she made a song that literally sounds like a dream. Probably cause she was slept on undeservedly #JusticeForElectraHeart"* **witchyaf** wasn't a fan of the song at first when the album came out *"but hearing it now it's really lovely actually."* **TeamAwesome4** really likes the* "rock aspect of this song brought out by the electric guitars, and it brings a needed change of pace."*  **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** loves how *"her voice mixed with the synths and strings, the production on this song is the best on the album."* **huntyphobic** thought *"this song was going to be terrible but then the chorus kicked in, I’m slightly shook tbh."*

The song reminds **Raicicle** about a certain artist, saying *"that Paloma Faith basically did this song first, but no-one actually cares about Paloma Faith."*

**havanabrown** is not a fan of the song, saying the song has a *"Bit of a generic beat, repetitive forgettable."* **letsallpoo** is not a fan of the song either, saying that "*The church bells are a nice touch but it makes me want to go into a state of dreaming."* **Awhile2** says *"this is like katy perry ballad levels of lame."* **superr_rad** says she *"would like this song a lot better if the pace from the first verse was consistent throughout the song :/"*


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"“I should do something like this for when I get on that Baz Lurhman soundtrack, right?”- Lana’s text to Marina after hearing this song."* -**MrSwearword**

*"relevant title, this put me to sleep"* -**batmanji**

*"stay woke y'all."* -**OberionSynth**

*"'Millions of girls float on that one quote' DRAG THEM MARINA."* -**Ventriloquy**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #31 – Marina and the Diamonds - Homewrecker (7.082192)

Controversy Score: 2.308076 / My Rating: 9

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgWgEoaAYDY)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (11 x1): Kaphox / (10 x7): sirgingerman, letsallpoo, cloudbustingmp3, supper_rad, lexarqade, BlasiFeelsSwift, alternativeoxygen / (9 x10): DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, FuckUpSomeCommasYeah, justiceisrad, skiddos, lordpraisewifi, noideawhatever, sjoors, omgcow, mrsevans101, eykitsa


**Lowest Scores:** (3.2 x1): Look_A_Fangirl / (3 x3): TeamAwesome4, julry, BearlyEvenAPun / (2 x1): mother_rucker / (1 x3): BionicFunhouse, Verdantshade, joshuaally



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People were really mixed with the song, especially in regards to the talking parts of the song. Personally, I really like the talking parts of the song, backed with a banging production.

**witchyaf** says they *"hate spoken word in songs but for some reason this one doesn't bother me too much."* Maybe it's because Marina is awesome????? **superr_rad** praises the song, saying she *"really dig[s] the persona she's taking on, and how the songs are adding to her depth as a character."* **hellomochi** lets out their hoe side, saying *"It's a fun upbeat song. Kinda makes you root for the homewrecker."*

**SkyBlade79** would have been a fan of the song, except there is a problem. He says *"I love the EDM influences and the choruses, and this would be my favorite track, but the second verse is SO bad and makes me cringe every time."* **gannade** likes *"the voiceover at first but it feels like half the song relies on the voiceover, which isn’t really music at that point."* **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** feels the same say, saying the song *"would be like an 8 but the voiceover parts kinda kill the momentum of the song."*

**Look_A_Fangirl** does not like the song's message at all, asking *"Why are we glorifying being a homewrecker, Marina, girl, that’s a no no."* **whatsapilot** says the song *"Starts out ok. Gets good in the middle. By the end I’m annoyed af and I just want it to fucking end."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comment:**

*"“Every boyfriend is the one/Until otherwise provuhn” Somebody call Yoda because the force was strong with that rhyme."* -**LandonKidtrea**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #30 – Marina and the Diamonds - Bubblegum Bitch (7.138356)

Controversy Score: 2.135584 / My Rating: 9

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG9HMazUe38)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (10 x8): Awhile2, Kaphox, throwaway963963963, whatsapilot, LandonKidatrea, hellomochi, yatcho, eykitsa / (9.5 x1): ExtraEater / (9 x10): DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, MrSwearword, sirgingerman, Reifiui, Verdantshade, SkyBlade79, Mudkip1, JoshuaReddit, lordpraisewifi, zombasteseses, 

**Lowest Scores:** (4 x3): gannade, SpanKKy1, joshually / (3 x2): letsallpoo, havanabrown / (0 x2): BionicFunhouse, PuggleMaster

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A perfect opener for Electra Heart. This pop punk vibe of the song makes me think Marina would do well in this specific genre. Can we expect the new album from Marina to sound like this?

**SkyBlade79** likes the song, saying it's his *"favorite song off of this album, and a great opener. Even though her trope of “sing the lyrics of the chorus ending on a low note, sing the lyrics of the chorus ending on a high note” gets old fast throughout the album, I think that it’s best used on this one."* **BlasiFeelsSwift** loves the song a lot, saying that *"The fast paced beginning is just perfect. It’s a really energetic and very catchy song. It makes you wanna dance around your crush’s house while chewing gum tbh (insert Nina Nesbitt’s Chewing Gum plug here). “Welcome to the life of electra heart” gets me every fucking time.  The production is really nice although I think that in 5-10 years it’s gonna make this song feel really weird. I really enjoy the way she sings the chorus and I don’t really know why. The whole song feels very short and rushed but like in a good way."*

Some felt like the song was better when it came out and it's not the same today. **laalic** says that *"When the album came out I was obsessed with this song but it got old pretty fast"* **spacebabe27** says the song 
*"Had a lot more impact when i was an actual angsty high schooler"* **witchyaf** still likes the song, saying it's *"a pretty good and catchy pop song, but i remember liking the sass and bite of this song a lot more when it first came out than i do now."*

**bluehxirzon** says the *"'i’m gonna be your bubblegum bitch' makes me cringe but other than that its alright."* **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** says he *"kinda like the pop punky feel but I can’t really get fully behind it."*

**superr_rad** says she *"found this a little underwhelming for an album opener. I can't even remember what it sounds like. Primadonna outshines it far too much for me."* **TeamAwesome4** says the song *"is a bit too in your face and obvious about it. The lyricism doesn't really match with the tone in my opinion."* **BionicFunhouse**, who gave this song a 0, says *"From beginning to end, this is probably the most annoying song in this entire rate."* 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comment:**

*"I thought she was predicting the future when she mentioned Lemonade, but then the following line went ‘here I come, straight to number one’ and I was like nah nevermind"* -**throwaway963963963**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be honest, I prefer this song over some of the songs in Pure Heroine. (Don't @ me). I love how this song's production is so simple yet it's so upbeat and does not come off cheap. I hope this is what Lorde's next album will sound like, especially she is close friends with Jack Antonoff.

**witchyaf** says that *"the really exciting thing about this song is discovering that lorde has the capability to do uptempo music and maintain her voice. this song is super fun, like i've even heard it play in a club before, and it's still extremely lorde. good for her, she's fucking limitless. am i turning into a stan? i didn't realize i liked lorde this much."* **Awhile2** says *"this beat bangs. Also this song makes me realize how amazing lorde x MIA would be."* **TeamAwesome4** fears that *"many people are gonna trash this song because it's Lorde being more pop-y and branching off from her own style and message. To me, both her style and message are things I don't particularly care about. This song is good."*

**LandonKidtrea** was confused, *"Woah. I thought I was listening to CHVRCHES there for a second."*

**ExtraEater** says this song is *"Definitely the worst song in Lorde's one-album discography."* **SkyBlade79** says that *"This like ACTUALLY sounds like a song That Poppy would do. Like, actually. That’s not really a good thing."* **Luxmor** says they *"appreciate the attempt and I can still bop to it sorta, but I really don't think this is Lorde's style."*

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #28 – Marina and the Diamonds - Teen Idle (7.205479)

Controversy Score: 2.494646 / My Rating: 8

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epe0PEPewHs)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (11 x3): JamesTheGent, rudhira_kali_ca, Ventriloquy / (10 x10): sirgingerman, Therokinrolla, cameronw73, laalic, noideawhatever, sjoors, whatsapilot, mirandacrocsgrove, BlasiFeelsSwift, eykitsa / (9.5 x2): throwaway963963963, SpanKKy1 / (9 x9): Reifiui, Verdantshade, cloudbustingmp3, JoshuaReddit, Luxmor, Look_A_Fangirl, omgcow, hellomochi, mrsevans101



**Lowest Scores:** (2 x1): TeamAwesome4 / (1 x2): mother_rucker, Mudkip1 / (0 x2): ExtraEater, julry

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**JamesTheGent** said that *"If this isn’t in the top 20 I’m gonna be the one feeling super super super suicidal." Please don't.*

While this song is a depressing bop, I really can't resonate with the lyrics here, even though I sort of went through the problems Marina (or her Electra Heart persona) went through in this song.

There are some people who do resonate the song, a lot.

**Luxmor** says this *"song that's far too relatable for me tbh. I haven't found another song that depicted this side of my teen depression quite as accurately and so beautifully. I think this is one of those songs you either absolutely love or don't care for at all, but I adore it."* **rudhira_kali_ca** says that *"Being a trans woman, the lyrics relate to me too well."* (Sending my love to trans people everywhere <3) **laalic** says *""This song is depressing and hits way too close to home...... I love it."*  **Look_A_Fangirl** is *"feeling this, it hits TOO many points with me right now."* **Therokinrolla** says *"The "super SUPER suicidal" section gets me every time. I love the build up of the song, the message is clear and effective and depressing af. It is one of the few Marina songs I personally connect with."* 

**throwaway963963963** says that *"It’s so incredibly honest and heart-wrenching. [I love it even more because apparently Lana once said she likes this song a lot, so it has holy blessing.](https://twitter.com/marinadiamandis/status/251025592265347072?lang=en)"* [(Marina and Lana had a picture together apparently.)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQCcz_lWwAEmnfY.jpg) **hellomochi** comments that *"She eloquently displays despair in such an upbeat song."*

**letsallpoo** remarks that the* "'Feeling super super super super suicidal" is a line that only Marina can really deliver. The ridiculousness of the statement would overpower the actual inherent sadness with any other singer, but Marina nails it. The song is just okay though."* While **lexarquade** finds the song* "relatable, I forgot how boring this song was."*

**MrSwearword** finds the song *"A bit too emo even if she’s secretly saying “Fuck you” to vapid teens."*  **soeri** isn't a fan of the production of the song, saying the *"noisy ass instrumental during the chorus [...] doesn't fit at all and it feels messy. The slower parts kinda salvage the song, but I still wouldn't listen to it on the regular."* **bluehxirzon** says he* "can kind of see why critics didn’t interpret this album the way she wanted it to be."* **Raicicle** says that *"Marina improved on this song an album later by writing Forget, which is basically the same verses with better production and an actual chorus."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"I always wanna get drunk and post angsty poetry to my tumblr while listening to this."* -**sirgingerman**

*"Wow ok this song is relatable I didn't expect to be having a crisis during this."* -**havanabrown**

**Lowest Scores:** (2 x2): throwaway963963963, joshually / (1 x1): eykitsa / (0 x1): booooam

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** has a huge feeling, saying he *"guarantee[s] [...] 5 people are going to make a comment saying "I wished I was dead while listening to this".* Alright Commas, let's see about that.

This is probably one of Lana's personal songs on the album as this song is more dramatic than usual. Yep, she is pretty dramatic in this song but when the song is about your dead lover, I feel like it's impossible not to feel like this.

**havanabrown**, who gave this song an 11 finds this an *"underrated song. So beautiful, heartfelt and emotional. God I love this song."* **omgcow** gets personal on why she gave his song an 11, saying *"God, where do I even begin with this song. This got me through two very painful periods in my life, the later of which isn’t even completely over. I tear up every time I listen to it. It’s so beautiful, “There’s no remedy for memory, your face is like a melody, it won’t leave my head” is such a great line, the whole song is written and sung beautifully."* 

Hmm, that is 0 so far on find the "I wished I was dead while listening to this." comments Let's keep looking.

**TeamAwesome4** is a fan of the song, saying that it's *"The first song on this album that I can enjoy start to finish."* **SkyBlade79** finds the song a *"Beautiful little songpiece. I really like the kind of desperate tone she uses, and honestly, this song still makes me a bit sad for the love I never had."* **superr_rad** finds the song *"beautifully sad. This is the first Lana song people should listen to if they haven't heard of her."*

Ohh yikes, that's still 0 so far Commas. Maybe we will finally see one comment from the people who are a bit mixed about the song?

**huntyphobic** thinks *"The ‘I wish I was dead’ line is extra, but aside from that it’s a good song."* **laalic** find the song *"Very sad, it's a pretty song but not all that memorable"* 

Okay, while huntyphobic's comment doesn't exactly say "I wished I was dead while listening to this.", it does however contain the "I wish I was dead" lyric, so that counts? That counts right? Okay, that's one person for Commas!

**booooam**, who gave this song a 0 says this song *"is everything that's wrong with LDR."* **ExtraEater** feels like *"This song just sounds wrong to me. It feels like I've heard this a million times in the album already."* **Therokinrolla** thinks this song is *"a weaker song of hers, its just really bland to me, too poppy"*. **witchyaf** feels like *"this is the song where born to die starts to take a nosedive for a while. it's just so......... forgettable. like listening to it i'm not miserable, but i'm definitely bored."* **throwaway963963963** is not really digging the song's overdramatic tone, saying *"I can imagine Lana grocery shopping like “Oh god, they’re out of milk! The petals of my waning heart crumble from neglect and calcium-deficiency. Death engulf me now! Woe is me.” So overdramatic."*

Yikes, that's only one person who said "I wish I was dead listening to this" in their comments. I looked everywhere even from the people who don't have their comments featured here. Nada. Sorry Commas.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comment:**

*"This song isn’t bad but Big Sean is the owner of dark paradises 👀."* -**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (Okay, I have no idea what he meant here but I added this anyway because I am sure people might get what he means here.)

[When will your faves have a white teeth fetish and write a song about it ??????](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sydlx/hey_im_lorde_ama/ce2h84x/?context=10000)

**Cryomatic** feels like the song *"feels sort of out of place in the album, but it’s otherwise a good commentary."*

**havanabrown** *"Didn't really think it was that special, kinda monotonous."* **TeamAwesome4** feels like the song is *"is the point where I'm starting to feel like Lorde is so "anti-fake glamour" that I have no real idea what she's for. Her whole reason to exist is her enemies."* **SkyBlade79** reminds him of *"of Mustang Kids by Zella Day but a lot worse. I don’t really get the whole “I am not a white teeth teen” thing, but I like the chorus."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comment:**

*"I feel so bad because Lorde was trying to make the fact that she isn’t a white teeth teen a major plot twist, but all it made me do was wonder why she’s so obsessed with teeth on this album."* -**throwaway963963963**

Wow, literally 95 percent of the comments I got for this song is about the "My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola" lyric. At this point, the ones I liked but don't fit well for the write-up are on the Bonus Comments section. And it's a lot. The song is a bop, despite its shock value on the opening line.

**Awhile2** says it's the *"first lana song i ever heard right here. i dont know what that says about me." huntyphobic says's Lana's "high notes leave me shook every time."*

My IRL friend **mrsevans101** feels a bit more mixed about the song, saying *"if lyrics weren't shit i'd give this an 8 for its style." gannade says that "She does a nice whistle in the bridge, and the opening line is ICONIC. Other than that, this song is forgettable."*

**rudhira_kali_ca** was off-guard by the opening, saying *"Ｌａｎａ， ｗｈａｔ ｔｈｅ ｆｕｃｋ． I was drinking hot coffee when I first heard that line and I burned myself laughing. Also, if your pussy actually tastes like that, you need to see a doctor."* **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** admits that the song has an *"Iconic line but I was highkey bored with the rest."* **bluehxrizon** is not a fan, mocking how Lana sang the opening line, *"**mahpussehtastelikepepsehcowla**… and people say ariana is the one who can’t enunciate."* 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"'MY PUSSY TASTES LIKE PEPSI-COLA' - Matthew 135:15"* -**MrSwearword**

*"Need I say more than the fact that she is the queen of vaginas."* -**sirgingerman**. (Um excuse you, CupcakKe is the queen of vaginas........REMIND YA. I AM KINDA. wet. RUNNING DOWN MY VAGINA.)

*"I can make so many jokes here, but the punchline is already there."* -**BionicFunhouse**

*"cola means butt in spanish which is fitting bc this song is utter shit. except for the instrumental."* -**soeri**

*"My pussy doesn't taste like Pepsi Cola, but I sing along with that line with a lot of conviction."* -**mother_rucker**

*"honestly I'd consider trying pussy if it tasted like Lana's. when will your fave describe their poonani like this."* -**batmanji**

*"queen of yeast infections."* -**OberionSynth**

This is probably Lana's radio-friendly song on the album. GET IT??? okay. :(

**gannade** praises the song, commenting *"Lana mispronounces “vitamin” to follow the song’s rhyme scheme, and makes it sound like the word was always supposed to be pronounced that way. Effortless queen."* **skiddos** *"love[s] it when her voice sounds soft and chill, yet the beat is poppin."*

**SkyBlade79** says that *"I get what she’s trying to say with this, but “now my life is sweet like CINNAMON” is such a dumb line."* **superr_rad** says the song's *"Points were deducted for that pronunciation of 'vitamin'"* **witchyaf** says the song has *"good old depressing lana, but in this case it's depressing because this song is so lame. the whole thing is just the same bland chorus."* **JamesTheGent** feels like *"this is the point in the album where everything starts sounding the same."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"fuck you lana learn how to pronounce vitamin"* -**Awhile2**

The lyrics "You're like my dad, you get on well / I send my best regards from hell" really impacted a lot on me because I have a complicated relationship with my father. Other than that, it's sadly not my top favorite songs on the album.

**Luxmor*** "cried listening to this more times than I'd like to admit... it's so sad and beautiful and far too often so RELATABLE, I adore it."* **laalic** finds this song his jam, commenting *"Unrequited love and daddy issues.. Everything my angsty ass could ever ask for in a song"*

**soeri** finds *"the acoustic is even better tbh. i still need that electra heart (unplugged) album bitch"*

**SkyBlade79** *"really like[s] the production, but that’s about it for this song."* **witchyaf** says *"the metaphor in the chorus is a bit much, especially when you consider the verses don't match it. the prechoruses are pretty cool tho."* **TeamAwesome4** says the *"Rhyming "role" with itself is lazy, but the rest of it is alright."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"is she rhyming “starring role” with “supporting role”? what a talent."* -**julry**

*"I'm clingy and emotional too, Marina, it's ok."* -**OberionSynth**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #22 – Marina and the Diamonds - Radioactive (7.364384)

Controversy Score: 2.225898 / My Rating: 8

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktvTqknDobU)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (11 x1): zombasteseses / (10 x13): sirgingerman, justiceisrad, cameronw73, letsallpoo, skiddos, witchyaf, Kaphox, cloudbustingmp3, mother_rucker, chihuahuazero, Luxmor, mirandacrocsgrove, eykitsa / (9 x10): Awhile2, havanabrown, Mudkip1, timothy444, JoshuaReddit, whatsapilot, OberionSynth, rudhira_kali_ca, Raicicle, lexarqade


**Lowest Scores:** (3 x1): soeri / (2 x2): Verdantshade, joshually / (0 x1): spacebabe27


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am going to start this write-up by featuring **throwaway963963963**'s comment, he feels like *"these tracks make me feel like making such an album wasn’t really the best fit for Marina’s artistic direction, as opposed to her other two records. It seemed empty and lacking passion."*

I completely agree with throwaway on this. I would be more forgiving if this was a song that Marina was featured in from some no name DJ. But the fact this is her own song, especially in comparison to the rest of Marina's discography (which is better imo) is just bizarre. I will get on how I actually feel about the album on tomorrow's rate reveal.

**MrSwearword** feels the same way, saying that *"This does not fit Marina’s style as a solo single. If this were some type of feature on a Calvin Harris or Disclosure or even Zedd track it’d make sense."* **Verdantshade** says the song has a *"Terrible beat and cheesy synths. Not what you want from Marina."* 

**TeamAwesome4** loved the production *"but the lyricism here is boring."*

**skiddos** loves the production, wishing *"she worked more with Stargate on the album; this is the ultimate bop." Therokinrolla thinks "this song is most interesting production-wise"*

**Luxmor** feels like *"This song is the eptiome of a fun catchy pop song. Fight me on this."* **Raicicle** says this song is *"probably the most overtly straight forward and poppiest track that Marina’s ever done, but it’s pretty damn good. Dance songs with a mandatory female vocalist tend to be a dime a dozen, but Marina’s voice is distinct and makes this nuanced enough compared to the rest of the pack to listen to."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"Why does she look like Rita Ora in the video? Have we ever seen the two of them in the same room together?"* -**letsallpoo** (I am more curious if we have ever seen Marina and [Hayley Atwell](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Hayley_Atwell_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg) in the same room together.)

*"yas slay me with these generic edm beats."* -**bluehxirzon**

*"'It seems like every song with the title "Radioactive' is guaranteed to be a bop!"* -**timothy444**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #21 – Lorde - No Better (7.557534)

Controversy Score: 1.605036 / My Rating: 6

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMTAUr3Nm6I)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (10 x5): cameronw73, laalic, noideawhatever, whatsapilot, hellomochi / (9.8 x1): mirandacrocsgrove / (9.5 x2): spacebabe27, mahiro / (9.1 x1): BionicFunhouse / (9 x8): sirgingerman, Therokinrolla, skiddos, ExtraEater, throwaway96396396,BearlyEvenAPun, LandonKidatrea, BlasiFeelsSwift

**Lowest Scores:** (4 x1): huntyphobic / (3 x1): eykitsa / (2 x1): lexarqade

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ehhh. I apperciate Lorde experimenting with a song like this but it's not something I would like to listen often.

**huntyphobic** was disgusted, asking *"Did the members of 21 pilots teach Lorde how to rap?"*

**MrSweraword** compares this to *"'22” by Taylor Swift but darker and with slightly better lyrics."*

Apparently, there are some fans of the song. **skiddos** is shook, saying *"Wow I've never heard this beforehand, what a bop!"* **TeamAwesome4** says* "This just sounds better than a lot of the album." superr_rad loves "the fast singing-talking whatever. its rad."* **SkyBlade79** is impressed, saying *"I like how this song has a faster instrumental that most of Lorde’s work."* **throwaway963963963** says this is *"The definitive Pure Heroine song to me. Snappy teenaged lyrics, Lorde’s low register, immaculate production, and an odd overarching sense of gloom and missing."*

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #20 – Lorde - The Love Club (7.69863)

Controversy Score: 2.070966 / My Rating: 10

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mB0tP1I-14)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (11 x2): julry, mrsevans101 / (10 x11): DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, gannade, soeri, skiddos, laalic, Cryomatic, cloudbustingmp3, JamesTheGent, Mudkip1, LandonKidatrea, hellomochi / (9.7 x1): mirandacrocsgrove / (9.5 x2): spacebabe27, ExtraEater / (9.3 x1): BlasiFeelsSwift / (9 x10): sirgingerman, justiceisrad, cameronw73, mother_rucker, batmanji, huntyphobic, hell0kitt, darbythefourth, OberionSynth, mahiro


**Lowest Scores:** (4.5 x1): TeamAwesome4 / (3 x1): letsallpoo / (1 x2): Kaphox, joshually 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I very much prefer this over White Teeth Teens, in which both songs deal with the same themes.

**SkyBlade79** feels the same way, saying *"This is the slightly better white teeth teens. I do like the vocals in the background."* 

**skiddos** says *"If I could give an 11 to each individual album, I think I would give it to this. This was the first Lorde song I'd ever heard, and I'm glad this was my introduction to her."*

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** loves *"how Lorde’s vocals are basically the beat for this song."* 

**julry** says *"this is my personal favorite Lorde song. pure magic. amazing lyrics. crying."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"Lorde goes from complaining about being poor to complaining about being rich and famous. Character development"* -**laalic**

*"I wish that I could stop being like the cool kids. Cause all the cool kids, they seem to be catty assholes."* -**LandonKidtrea**

**Lowest Scores:** (4 x4): justiceisrad, letsallpoo, havanabrown, Kaphox / (3.2 x1): MrSwearword / (2 x1): Look_A_Fangirl

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think this is one of the best songs from Lorde to date. Even though I am extrovert, I can somehow relate to the lyrics on this one.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**, who gave this song an 11, said that *"This [is] kinda became my new favorite Lorde song from this rate. I love the lowkey key production that grows and gets bigger with the drums, the background chorus, and everything about Lorde’s vocals on it. I know its not even on PH really but its such a great song."* 

**LandonKidtrea**, who also gave this song an 11, said *"Most if not all the songs in this magnificent album have clever, poignantly relatable and finely detailed writing. But this is the one that gets my 11 because Lorde’s singing is heavenly. Her best vocal performance in this whole album."*

**witchyaf** says *"this song both goes off and speaks really honestly about her anxiety about being recognized. it's a thought i've had about what i would do if i had a spotlight of my own, and she has taken a really mature and studied approach to it. this song both goes off and speaks really honestly about her anxiety about being recognized. it's a thought i've had about what i would do if i had a spotlight of my own, and she has taken a really mature and studied approach to it."* 

**SkyBlade79** finds *"This one is pretty good. I love the background vocals so much."* **throwaway963963963** says *"There’s a incredibly tiny part with synths or something right after “get me down” that makes me so excited every time it comes back. God, I love the detail in this album."*

**TeamAwesome4** feels mixed about the song on a personal level, saying *"As a performer myself, but also a bit of a narcissist, I both fully understand this and don't understand it at all."*

**MrSwearword** isn't a fan of the song, commenting *"All her life at 16, she’s fought a war/been through so much? KISS MY ASS, pretentious songwriting with decent vocal delivery."* **ExtraEater** commented that *"Even before Pure Heroine, Lorde still had lyrical prowess. But this song is kinda weak all things considered."* **superr_rad** says that *"if anyone says lorde doesn't have the range point them to this."* **Look_A_Fangirl** finds the song *"Rather bleak and boring, expected more out of a Lorde ballad."* **huntyphobic** had a journey with the song, saying *"I’ve been sleeping on this song, I never realized how good it is omg. Oh nvm that chorus is really bad lol."*

**Lowest Scores:** (4 x3): havanabrown, SkyBlade79, supper_rad / (2 x1): joshually / (0 x1): batmanji

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is one of my top favorite songs on Electra Heart. For such an emotional song, this goes super hard. However, the acoustic version >>>>>>>>>>>>> the original.

Of course, there were comments about how the acoustic version is better. **soeri** says *"the acoustic is better js imo tbh"* **witchyaf** says it's *"a good bop, but i like the acoustic version of it she posted on youtube a lot better honestly, it felt more raw and this one is a bit overwrought."*

**BionicFunhouse** is *"happy we did this rate thread, this song is damn good. I probably wouldn't have listened to this otherwise."* **laalic** loves "*how vulnerable this song is. Makes me want to poison my non-existent husband."* 

**skiddos** admitted that *"the beat is a lil too perky for the song, but at the same time it's really dope."* **TeamAwesome4** feels like *"These verses are goddamn fantastic, but the chorus isn't up to those same standards."* **throwaway963963963** says the song is *"Really emotional and well-written, but the production sounds like it was made with a hairdryer placed near a mic."*

**batmanji**, who gave this song a 0 feels like the song is *"where the album loses me every time. this song kills all of the momentum from Primadonna and makes the rest of the album a pain to listen to"*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"Is this what tumblrcore is?"* -**huntyphobic**

*"Sounds like someone punched Florence repeatedly in the head with her own machine then forced her to sing over a drum and bass track."* -**joshually**

Controversy Score: 2.085109/ My Rating: 10

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRzldFaiqeY)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (11 x3): Therokinrolla, mother_rucker, huntyphobic / (10 x18): DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, gannade, MrSwearword, sirgingerman, spacebabe27, justiceisrad, BionicFunhouse, cameronw73, letsallpoo, MeerK4T, witchyaf, Kaphox

**Lowest Scores:** (3.5 x1): SpanKKy1 / (3 x1): zombasteseses / (2 x1): soeri


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is like one of my favorite songs from Lana's discography. The way she sang "I am tired of feeling like I am fucking crazy." lyric melts me everytime.

**gannade** says *"If “Summertime Sadness” is a little too melancholy for you play as you cruise down the coast goin’ bout 99, then “Ride” might be a nice alternative. It starts off simple, without too much instrumentation or much of a beat, but the way Lana holds on the notes in the chorus gives the song a sense of freedom that’s difficult to describe. And that bridge is just flat out superb."*

**huntyphobic**, who gave this song an 11 is speechless *"The only word to describe this song is ‘Perfect’" mother_rucker, who gave this song an 11 as well commented "This song is so gorgeous and emotional holy shit"* **Therokinrolla** was deciding whether *"This and Ribs battle for my 11 but in the end Ride is such an epic song."*

**throwaway963963963** says the song is *"beautiful and well-realised as a concept but...I just can’t. Listening to it feels like it’s an hour long I’m sorry I just can’t do it, I have feelings too godammit."* **witchyaf** says *"this was my favorite lana track until high by the beach came. it's also one of the only songs on paradise i give a shit about. it's kinda spiritual, and definitely has an impact. the chorus is so beautiful and honest, and the bridge gives me goosebumps. hooking-up-with-a-daddy-biker anthem."* My IRL friend **mrsevans101** said *"if i could vote on the intro in the MV, i'd give it an 11."* 

**MrSwearword** says *"Even if she can’t sing this live, the song and video are life-affirming."* **superr_rad** feels like she has *"to be in a certain mood to listen to this but its solid!"*  **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** *"Feels [like this song is] kinda like a throwback. I didn’t really like the singing on the first half that much but it gets way better in the second half and the production is still really good."* **SkyBlade79** *"like[s] the humming in the background. But this song is kind of boring. 6/10 would not drive fast."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"Twenty one pilots did it better."* -**Reifiui**

*"Twenty One Pilots who?"* -**Look_A_Fangirl**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #16 – Lana Del Rey - Blue Jeans (7.838356)

Controversy Score: 1.963965/ My Rating: 9.5

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0OJbbmzkDE)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (11 x2): letsallpoo, batmanji / (10 x11): gannade, MrSwearword, cameronw73, llalic, Awhile2, bluehxrizon, mother_rucker, chihuahuazero, mirandacrocsgrove, yatcho, candyninja32 / (9.5 x5): DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, spacebabe27, Luxmor, Raicicle, BlasiFeelsSwift / (9 x12): sirgingerman, Therokinrolla, ExtraEater, MeerK4T, witchyaf, Verdantshade, OberionSynth, hellomochi, lexarqade, mrsevans101, alternativeoxygen, Raykel

**Lowest Scores:** (4 x1): soeri / (3 x2): TeamAwesome4, booooam / (1 x1): throwaway963963963

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The instrumental of this song is so sexy. And when she begins singing the song with "Blue Jeans/White shirt.", I know this song is gonna be good.

**batmanji**, who gave this song an 11 says *"this song is so sexy, the bass line slays me."* 

**witchyaf** loves *"the manic feel of the chorus compared to the slow pacing of the verses. i love the desperation of it. it's still, like, hung over and desperate, but that's kind of a look. this is definitely one of my favorite songs off of born to die/paradise."* **BlasiFeelsSwift** says *"This is the only reference to James Dean in a song I will accept. I like how desperate she sounds, he’s her world and she’s nothing to him, a really nice contrast tbh." Therokinrolla admits "Her very gritty voice takes a second to get used to but this song is almost perfection."* I think you could say the same for Perfect Illusion, right AutoMod?

**skiddos** admits that *"The SNL performance fucced this up for me, ngl."* **throwaway963963963** is not impressed with the song at all, *"Hold up, is this supposed to be word-play? That she was always born to be melancholy, like “Blue Genes”?? Seriously??? Either way it’s a garbage lowlight."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"Can your fave pull off the lyric “you’re so fresh to death, but sick as ca-ca-cancer?”* -**gannade**

*"For some reason I had this saved on Spotify. Not anymore."* -**soeri**

*"To be honest, the little Game Boy bleep 4 seconds in after five of the six guitar strums is the funniest thing about this song."* -**Raicicle**

*"I had an ex who was obsessed with Lana. He'd force me to watch her videos before he'd let me slip off his blue jeans. I went along with it because he was super hot. Oh I remember. I remember."* -**joshually**

**Lowest Scores:** (5 x2): skiddos, batmanji / (2 x1): throwaway963963963 / (1 x1): joshually


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, this is a song you can write about violence and war, without idk? Direct violent imagery? I think this is what makes Lorde unique to me. She is never there to shock you while dropping some truth dombs.........(Watch as Lorde 2 era is basically Ella's Bangerz era where she twerks at Taylor Swift in the 2017 VMAs. KAYLOR WHO?)

**witchyaf** feels the same way somehow, saying that "lorde really has a talent for effortlessly weaving metaphors together. this song also sounds dangerous and fun, and i think it would have made a good single in place of team." **SkyBlade79** says he *"forgot how good it is. The drums in the instrumental go so hard, and I love the gladiator theme."* **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** loves *"the dark synth on this song, especially the hook. The alternating Lorde vocals on the verses fits really well too. The drums near the end of the song go pretty hard ngl."*

**TeamAwesome4** said *"That [the] monotonous beat on the bridge is headache inducing, but the rest of it is alright."* **throwaway963963963** says *"This song is such an emotional rollercoaster because it keeps going silent, giving me hope that it’s finally over, before destroying it by returning with the beat."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"This song honestly makes me wanna take off all my clothes and set a bunch of Vikings on fire."* -**sirgingerman**

*"Lorde could punch me in the face and I'd smile and ask for seconds"* -**OberionSynth**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This song >>>>>> Primadonna tbh. 

The song reminds **MrSwearword** of Blank Space, commenting *"Subtract the vocal ability, subtract the lyrical depth, add Taylor Swift and you’ll figure out how “Blank Space” was made."* Wow okay. **Therokinrolla** says this is *"The iconic Marina song. I love people singing this song not actually understanding the significance behind it, I love the chorus, and I love her "rules"* **Luxmor**, who gave this song an 11 says *"This song is an ear virus. It will crawl into you and stay in your brain forever and make you pop that pussy like the heartbreaking hoe you really are inside. It's one of my favorite fun catchy pop songs ever and I will never not feel like dancing when it comes on. This better at least make the top 10 or I will RIOT."* (Uhhh, yikes) **bluehxrizon** *"love[s] the chorus. 2012 pop in a nutshell."*

**laalic** admits the song is *"Very catchy but a little bland."* **TeamAwesome4** asks us to *"Forgive my moral high ground, but this is literally a list of how to feel nothing beyond the physical (not a problem) and hurt people (here's the problem). Of course, she knows that, but knowingly hurting people isn't something to be romanticized."* **SkyBlade79** says *"This song is way too overrated. The only part I like is the “I la-la-love you”, and the production. The whole rule concept is so extremely dumb and the rhymes are far too predictable."*


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"Good song but the guitar sounds exactly like [a certain swedish BOP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjZwz3yxS9I)"* -Vaktmeister (Yeah, it actually does sound like it. Marina queen of plagriazing)

*"Is it sad I discovered Marina through the cover that Glee did for this song?"* -**Ventriloquy** (Yes)

*"An actual bop™ also the song whom of which it’s video made me realize I was gay LOL."* -**sirgingerman**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #13 – Lorde - Royals (7.906849)

**Lowest Scores:** (4 x1): hell0kitt / (3 x1): yatcho / (0 x2): Verdantshade, Kaphox

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I’m gonna be disappointed if the link isn’t related to the Bee Movie. Also this song is really good." -LandonKidtrea (Well, I got some good news for ya.)

Anyway, yikes. For a subreddit that loves Lorde to death, this is really shocking you put Royals this low due to the song being overplayed.

**Verdantshade**, who gave this song a 0 thinks the song deserved his 0, saying *"hearing it on the radio turned me off Lorde until earlier this year. Now that I know what I've missed out on, I have nothing to blame but this song."* 

**Therokinrolla** asks *"Her worst song on the standard edition album is the lead single?"* **havanabrown** says they *"don't get why this song was so popular like it's good but there's better tracks."*

**witchyaf** says if this song hasn't been overplayed so much, they would rate it a 10 or 11 but *"it's a brilliantly minimal song, and the fact that she managed to sell a song that sounds so different from what was popular at the time speaks a lot to her talent. i also love songs that are anthemic to their target demographic."* **soeri** says *"ella's flow is fire tbh. loses a 0.2 for overplay"* 

There are people more forgiving about the song despite how overplayed it was. **ExtraEater** hopes *"/r/popheads doesn't hate the good, but overplayed because this song is timeless and still worth a gold tooth."* **skiddos** says this song is *"A truly iconic part of 2013 - I also really really love the gongs in this song."* **bluehxrizon** shades Marina, commenting *"social commentary done right. take notes, Marina."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comment:**

"*‘we’re not caught up in your love affair’, Lorde mutters under her breath as Taylor hangs around her neck with one arm and rebukes a business executive on her cellphone with the other."* -**Cryomatic**

**Lowest Scores:** (4.5 x1): Raykel / (4 x1): justiceisrad / (3 x2): Cryomatic, booooam / (0 x1): soeri


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that I think about it, this song and Million Dollar Man basically deal with similar themes. Except this song is much better and I am glad this song performed higher than Million Dollar Man.

**laalic**, who gave this song an 11 says *"The BEST song of ALL TIME. Truly, there has never been another song on this level. The lyrics, her voice, EVERYTHING is PERFECT. Mozart WISHES he had this much musical talent. NO exaggeration, this song is LIFE CHANGING."* **Skiddos** also gave this song an 11, commenting *"Lawd I love this song so fucking much. The beat is fire, and her voice has more personality on this song  than on any of these other songs."* **chihuahuazero** also gave this song an 11, saying *"This song is underrated and it bangs. It’s a five-minute Lolita allegory with lyric-packed verses and the best of Lana’s high registry in her LDR era. Regardless of her true intentions, Lana pins down her character here to a T."* 

**BlasiFeelsSwift** also gave this song an 11, in a very long comment (which I have to trim down a lot) he says *"I love how she references all of this pop culture elements but in a really classy way. The tone of her voice, almost childish at some points contrast to the maturity of the subject of the song. So many daddy issues, so much sluttiness, so much sugar daddy vibes, just perfect. The way she sings “tar black soul” just like she’s over it but at the same time she’s so grateful somebody loves her, even if it’s just for her body/whatever."*

**gannade** says that *"Lana showcases her Lolita-style high pitched vocal, raising it especially high at the end of her phrasing of “I’m your little harlet, scarlet” to make for a surprisingly catchy listen. She juxtaposes her vocal delivery with her trademark string instrumentation, but also along with a pounding beat and a loud chant in the background. It’s a noisy song with a lot going on, but Lana pulls it off and makes it look natural."*

**witchyaf** is impressed, saying *"this song actually has some action to it, which is pretty cool coming from lana, because it maintains that sad girl persona while still kinda having a bop to it."* **SkyBlade79** finds this *"A very interesting and unique song! Reminds me of a fair, and her lolita voice is perfect. I love the images that this song makes you visualize. I think that this would be a great Harley Quinn theme."*

**Verdantshade** wasn't a fan at first, saying they *"Hated the use of the higher register of her voice initially, but the chorus is too catchy. Consider me converted."*

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** is quite freaked out, admitting that *"I think I found where Melanie Martinez came from and I have VERY mixed feelings about the baby talk, the productions good tho??? I really don’t know what to think of this song so i just gave it a 6"*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comment:**

*"Lana has reached new levels of baby voice, Britney is shook!"* -**huntyphobic**

I couldn't think of a better closer for Pure Heroine other than this. It's really cool at that the very end of the song, she sings "Let them talk" and when you're listening to the album in order, on repeat, it's Tennis Court, which the song begins with "Don't you think it's boring how people talk?". It's really clear Lorde really puts a lot of thought to the music she creates.

People noticed this too like **bluehxrizon** (*"its so cool how the album starts with “don’t you think that its boring when people talk” and the last line is “people are talking, let them talk” #art"*) and **alternativeoxygen** (*"I love how Tennis Court asks, "Don't you think how it's boring how people talk?" and this song answers, "Let them talk."*)

**ExtraEater**, who gave this song an 11, *"adore[s] the use of the postrock-esque guitar, especially since it goes well with the unique sound of the album."* 

**witchyaf** says it's *"another great honest song about feeling isolated, which is something that connects me to lorde a lot. she's so concise and well-spoken about difficult concepts to capture well."* **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** says he* "Love[s] this as an outro. The moody guitar is great and Lorde sounds really wearied which fits it being the last song on the regular tracklist."* **julry** admits that *"i barely have any comments on Lorde's songs, but that’s because they’d all be the same: they are amazing, works of art, I feel deep emotions"* **hellomochi** left a really personal comment on the song, saying that *"As someone who uses the internet to socialize and still feels so alone, this is a very relatable song."*

The song reminds **Verdantshade** of The xx, commenting that *"The sparse guitars remind me of the xx. Definitely an enjoyable song. The "let them talk" at the end is perfect."* **Raicicle** feels sort of the opposite regarding the xx comparison, saying he doesn't *"think the The xx-style guitars particularly do Lorde any huge favours, but the chorus has a wistfulness that she captures particularly well."* **throwaway963963963** feels like *"The song is even sadder to me when it comes on because it reminds me that the album is ending. I just wish it was more solid and was tweaked a bit."*

**huntyphobic** finds *"The instrumental cute but everything else falls flat tbh."* **joshually** is bored of the song, saying it's *"Too wordy and not enough catchiness, like trying to read the Terms of Service of a contract."*
