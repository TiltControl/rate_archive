how old is your old bed?

mgglite: I know this thread is almost a month old but hear me out bc thinking about this has kept me up at night

I misread your comment as "how is your old bed" instead of how *old* is my old bed and I was like well that's a weird question so I answered with the thing about the spring sticking out but like a week ago when I was going through this thread again I was suddenly not blind and read your comment properly and realized my reply didn't make sense in context and I spent the day thinking about it

So to answer your question that you probably don't remember the bed was more than ten years old

Apologies for this neurotic post

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #10 – Lana Del Rey - National Anthem (8.045205)

Controversy Score: 2.46015 / My Rating: 10

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls1YVhcLD2c)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Highest Scores:** (11 x3): Awhile2, sjoors, yatcho / (10 x28): DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, gannade, FuckUpSomeCommasYeah, sirgingerman, spacebabe27, Theronkinrolla, cameronw73, skiddos, llalic, ExtraEater, MeerK4T, Verdantshade, Kaphox, superr_rad, ThereIsNoSantaClaus, batmanji, lordpraisewifi, noideawhatever, huntyphobic, whatsapilot, OberionSynth, omgcow, mirandacrocsgrove, BlasiFeelsSwift, Ventriloquy, alternativeoxygen, zombasteseses, eykitsa / (9.5 x1): mother_rucker / (9 x8): Reifiui, Cryomatic, throwaway963963963, Mudkip1, Luxmor, hellomochi, PuggleMaster, candyninja32



**Lowest Scores:** (3 x2): TeamAwesome4, bluehxrizon / (2 x1): soeri / (0 x1): MrSwearword 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is probably one of my favorite songs from Lana ever. The talk-rapping, the production as well as its gorgeous music video is just perfect.

**gannade** says *"National Anthem” seems to be the most accessible song for listeners not already familiar with Lana. It’s quite obvious why – it effortlessly marriages Lana’s pop vocals with a hip-hop style beat. Her rapid fire vocal delivery, paired with her anthemic claim of “I’m your national anthem” and call-and-response whisper in the chorus, makes “National Anthem” the catchiest song on the album.*

**Therokinrolla** declares the song as *"one of Lana's best on her entire discography. Its so pure when she sings 'summers in your hair, baby heaven's in your eyes'" witchyaf says "this was my favorite song on the album when i first heard it, and it's still pretty damn good. this is kind of the peak lana attitude song, the "gangster nancy sinatra" as she would say. bop certified."* **Verdantshade** says this is *"The first song I heard by Lana. Surprised it wasn't a hit - the chorus is incredible."* **omgcow** says *"This was the first Lana song I ever heard, and it’s still one of my favorites. It makes me want to rock gently in a hammock while sipping an expensive cocktail, while my lover swims in the ocean nearby"* **Reifiui** is shook, saying *"Wow when Lana fucking tries she can do good music! Too bad she forgot to do that for the rest of the album."* 


**Awhile2** admits that he *"find[s] the “money is the anthem of success” part to be extremely corny but the rest of the song is just so perfect that its still getting my 11."* **letsallpoo** finds the lyrics *"terrible. At least the production is immaculate."* **SkyBlade79** doesn't *"really love the chorus, but everything else is great. Lana’s voice is like honey in the verses."*

**MrSwearword**, who usually rooted for Lana to win the rate, loathes this song, saying it's *"Lana’s worst song ever. It sucks, the video is stupid, in the words of you meme-vaping whores on Snapgram or whatever…I HAET."* **TeamAwesome4** says he *"finally pinpointed what I hate about Lana. It seems like she is incapable of singling about something without glamorizing it. There's never any hint of sarcasm or irony. In addition, I like melancholy as much as anyone else, probably more so, but it's only useful as a change of pace instead of being the pace itself."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"So nice of Lana to create the new American national anthem."* -**skiddos**

*"I know at the end of this song she's all sad and whatever, but this song kind of makes me want to find a sugardaddy since I'm broke and money sounds nice."* -**mother_rucker**

*"More iconic and a better bop than ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’"* -**huntyphobic**

*"Good thing I found this track, now I can finally stop listening to New Americana."* -**whatsapilot**

*"This song makes me feel uncomfortable, like I've accidentally stumbled somewhere into Darkweb and a couple of aryan race twin girls are creepily singing the "new National Anthem" in a monotone with their dead eyes staring straight into my minority soul. "* -**joshually**

*"blame Lana and this song for singlehandedly sparking the daddy craze of the 2010s because this song's aesthetic is so perfect"* -**yatcho**

**Lowest Scores:** (4 x1): SpanKKy1 / (3 x1): joshually / (1 x1): MrSwearword 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The best part of this song was its ironic production as the song is minimalistically joyful and warm but the lyrics, aren't exactly joyful and warm at all. Lorde pulls this off very well.

**Therokinrolla** is shook, commenting *"what a topic to sing about and what an execution(no pun intended even though I'm lying"* **BionicFunhouse** *"really[s] hope people actually listen to this one, Lorde's lyricism tells better stories than most authors. And then THAT BEAUTIFUL CHORUS KICKS IN AND I'M SENT TO THE MOON."* **witchyaf** says "*this song just lends itself to many strong visuals. i don't know why, but i adore songs that use a haircut as a metaphor, and "i live in a hologram with you" is one of my favorite lyrics i can think of. the whole song just feels magical and personal and introspective."* **ExtraEater** says that *"The lyrical strength of Lorde shines across the entire album, but it's particularly noticeable here. Also, the a e s t h e t i c ."* **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** says the song's *"production sounds almost like a movie score. It gives a really hopeless feel for one of the darkest songs on the album."* 

**SkyBlade79** says this is *"One of my favorite instrumentals on PH, and the pre-chorus and chorus is really good. However, I’m not a huge fan of the verses."* **TeamAwesome4** is confused, commenting *"I think I get it, but I don't know if I get it, but this song is just ok."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"If Lorde wants to keep it a secret that she has literally been sent from heaven she’s going to have to use a less suspicious stagename"* -**throwaway963963963**

*"I used to have this song as my alarm on my phone. I stopped that when I realized I would come to hate it."* -**rudhira_kali_ca**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I love how this song can either be applied to romantic relationships or platonic friendships. Either way, this song is about loving someone you're close with, either be your significant other, your best friend, your sibling. I never heard of a song like this where the song can be applied either to platonic friendships or romantic relationships. Lorde nailed this.

**letsallpoo** feels like the same way about this, commenting that he'd *"be fine with this song winning. It's such a beautiful depiction of intimacy--not necessarily romantic, but there's this powerful essence of peace and platonic love that only someone as young as Lorde can really tap into."* **mother_rucker** says they *"like to think this song is about best friends enjoying their time together. I think it's great that it's not necessarily about romantic love, depending on how you interpret it."* 

**witchyaf** finds the *"the whole vibe of this song is breezy and relaxed, and she sells it really charmingly. the instrumental is really cool too."* **SkyBlade79** loves the song, he *"like[s] the minimalistic style of singing, and the wild-sounding instrumental is really cool. And I like you, 400 Lux"* **Luxmor** *"absolutely adore[s] this song, it's like the best thing Lorde's ever done. 10/10, I've listened to this so many times and it's still amazing and so relatable. I was coming into this rate with Lorde as my underdog since Pure Heroine had the most music I haven't listened to before this rate but if this isn't top 10 I will riot. Bow down to the Lorde, bitches"* **hellomochi** comments that *"The chorus has such a bittersweet quality to it. It sounds like it could be on a soundtrack for a teen love story set in 50s suburbia."* **alternativeoxygen** *"Love[s] the double entendres throughout this song. She manages to reference drugs w/o being edgy!1111."*

**MrSwearword** comments* "So, an emo version of “The Lazy Song”? Interesting."* **Therokinrolla** says 
*"The production is stellar but that's where it ends for me on this song."*

**Look_A_Fangirl** finds the song *"A bit of led down compared to the opener of Tennis Courts"* **havanabrown** was like *"Gurl what the hell are you talking about you're lucky the beat is good."Reifiui says they "stan Lorde but eww there's so many bad decisions made in this song."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"god what a great song omg thank you lorde for making this."* -**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**

*"IF YOU DON’T LISTEN TO THIS WHILE DRIVING DOWN AN EMPTY ROAD AT 3 IN THE MORNING I CAN’T ASSOCIATE WITH YOU."* -**sirgingerman**

*"This song describes the suburban dream: WUUUHHHHHHHH, WUUUHHHHHHHH, WUUUHHHHHHHH"* -**ExtraEater**

*"Makes me lie awake at night, staring wistfully into the darkness, wondering if I’ll ever find someone who buys me orange juice."* -**throwaway963963963**

*"omg that opening got me so hype got me popping my pussy omg."* -**OberionSynth**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #7 – Lana Del Rey - Video Games (8.449315)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**spacebabe27** had a bold statement about this song. They said the song is *"Basically the Run Away With Me of this rate."* LOL, not even close.

I really can't believe this song actually led Lana Del Rey slowly into stardom considering the sound of this song isn't exactly radio friendly. Other than that, it's really good I like it. 

**Verdantshade** finds it shocking too, saying that it's *"As nice as the song is, I still find it hard to believe it was Lana's breakthrough song. Beautiful."*

**throwaway963963963**, who gave the song an 11 says this is *"Undeniably the sweetest encapsulation of a simple, domestic love story. Those opening bells immediately transport me to another world."*

**gannade** says this is *"My favorite love song to date. Avoiding the usual bombast of typical love songs, Lana understands that it’s all in the simple things. Lana croons that “this is my idea of fun, playing a video game,” accompanied by only a simple piano/strings accompaniment and a soft beat during the chorus. Isn’t that we all want, somebody who we can enjoy even when we’re just sitting at home doing nothing? The song is absolutely stunning in its simplicity, which highlights Lana’s own haunting vocals. It is no wonder that this was Lana’s breakthrough hit."* **witchyaf** says they *"like video games a little bit more than blue jeans. a lot of the time lana's slow-paced sad thing plays against her (see: all jokes about lana del rey), but this song really uses that to its advantage. it's slow, but it doesn't drag so much as float along."*

**havanabrown** *"used to hate this song but it's grown on me over the years."*

**chihuahuazero** says that *"Even though this is her breakout single, it’s a little too lowkey for me. I’ll attribute it to the fact that Emile Haynie didn’t produce this. Nevertheless, I respect how lush and devastating the chorus is, which saves it from the album’s lesser cuts."* **Awhile2** finds this an *"most overrated lana song. Really boring tbh."* **TeamAwesome4** says *"It might be your idea of fun, Lana, but I cannot sit through ballads like this much longer."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"I wonder which video games that person was playing. If it was Pokemon, I'll gladly take that man from her."* -**skiddos**

*"This is not how we play video games Lana."* -**Look_A_Fangirl**

*"I'd rather play video games than hear this song."* -**OberionSynth**

*"Queen of the video game industry."* -**Ventriloquy**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

"I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S SUCH A BIG DILDO." -soeri

"This was her biggest hit, right? Well, her biggest hit in the UK... she doesn't have any hits in the US." -skiddos

"'I know I've got a big ego, I really don't know why it's such a big deal though.' My existence summed up in one sentence." -TeamAwesome4

"The fact that this ended up being Marina’s most popular song is the reason why I feel global warming is probably for the best." -throwaway963963963

"I can’t be the only one alone in first thinking this song was about what it was like being a girl before the Madonna era" -JoshuaReddit

"I keep being reminded of the parody song “male prima donna" Kelly, Ryan and Erin sang on The Office. Which I also love!" -julry

"Queen of rhyming void with celluloid" -Ventriloquy

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"One of her most iconic lyrically but sound-wise its quite meh. I seriously love the lyric 'Primadonna Girl, yea, all I ever wanted was the world.' ME" -Therokinrolla

"i know it's a bit heavy-handed, but i like the lyrics in this song that make it clear that this character is meant to be a bit more tragic. i also just can't help but always bop along when i hear this song. also she goes through a carwash in the video so i always play that part when i go through a carwash lmao " -witchyaf

"The only song of hers I've heard before, luckily I like it. Although the verses are more interesting than the chorus." -havanabrown

"A bop but honestly kinda dull, especially for Marina's standards." -Reifiui

"The melody alone warrants this song at least a 7, this song is pop perfection!!" -superr_rad

"The production is amazing but the lyrics a bit lacking which isn’t the best, and it seems like the song ends on an unfinished note, which to be honest, bothers me." -Look_A_Fangirl

"Her rich vocals suit this song very well." -hellomochi

"For all intents and purposes, a perfect pop song. It’s Froot and The Family Jewels that will last longer for their focus on songwriting, but, if there’s one thing to remember of this era, it was this song." -Raicicle

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As much as I can stan Marina all I want during this rate, Electra Heart is probably my least favorite album from her. The songs are bops by itself but as an entire album, it's quite incohesive. With that, I am glad she followed up this album with the much better FROOT. If Electra Heart is the first album you hear from Marina, please don't make it your last. Listen to her other albums (The Family Jewels and Froot) which were much better than Electra Heart. I could go on further about this but I don't have much time LOL.

*"It really is an interesting album. The first five tracks I think are great, some exceptional, but there really are some low dips later in the album. I seriously like what it is trying to say, and I enjoy some of the sounds produced in this album, but on the first listen some songs do kinda merge together and you look back over the names and you are kinda like, "wait, what did that song sound like?" Luckily, I've listened to this album before."* -**Theronkinrolla**

*"This album made feel like my mental illness wasn't something to be ashamed of. Marina took mental instability and made one of the best indie-pop albums ever out of it. It holds a special place in my heart, although some songs haven't aged too well."* -**soeri**

*"I love listening to this album from start to finish, it's definitely an experience but individually most of the songs are just ok."* -**laalic**

*"The only album of the three to be full of bops, but unfortunately the album is nowhere nearly as consistent as the other two. I don't think Marina achieved what she wanted to achieve with this album. The album's still a lot of fun regardless."* -**skiddos**

*"Had an ex who loved this album. It doesn't bring back the best memories, but it's still my favourite Marina album."* -**Verdantshade**

*"comparison to BTD is apt, because marina tried really really hard to create this weird simulacrum of what Lana did with her image seemingly by accident. keep trying, marina."* -**julry**

*"This is definitely my favorite album of the bunch. I have a strong emotional connection to it and I honestly don't think any of the songs are actually even bad. Some are definitely on the dull side and there are a lot that I'd say are average, but overall I just connect with this so much and it'll always be in my heart. My... electra heart? :^)"* -**Luxmor**

*"Marina may not be able to compete with Lorde's songwriting or Lana's lush instrumentals, but she defeats them in straight forward pop songs that give you instant gratification.  The highs on this album beat the other albums. With that said it does have some trash moments"* -**alternativeoxygen**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comment:**

*"This album is Katy Perry for people who think that they are too cool for Katy Perry."* -**Vaktmeister**

**Storytime with ExtraEater:**

In Reddit headquarters, there was a woman. She was browsing /r/popheads while eating some lunch. Then, she read a comment praising Closer (ft. Halsey) and she spit out her french fry. The french fry landed on the ground. She picked it up and threw it away. The next week, a dumpster diver found the french fry in the dump but he immediately discarded it. Why? Because it was touching a wet diaper. This diaper was Electra Heart.

I remember hearing this song for the first time, intrigued by the world of Lana Del Rey. It's something I never heard of before that time. It's so unique compared to today's pop songs. I had this on repeat 15 times when I first heard of this by the way. This is truly a Lana Del Rey classic.

**gannade**, who gave this song an 11, says *"Every time I hear that opening sequence of strings, I get shook. Her vocal delivery in this song is flawless. The way her own voice breaks when she sings “all my heart, it breaks,” the way she elongates the last syllable of “I feel so alone on a Friday night,” the way she calmly states “choose your last words, this is the last time, cause you and I, we were born to die” as she accepts the inevitable – it never fails to melt my heart. And when your pair that with the lush instrumentation, it’s pop perfection."* **MrSwearword**, who gave this song an 11 as well says this is *"The first song from Lana I ever listened to/watched the video for on YouTube. I’ve been a fan ever since."* **SkyBlade79** also gave this song an 11, saying it's *"One of the best songs of the era in my opinion. An absolutely amazing ballad that gives me nostalgia no matter what. I love this song, everything about it, and I don’t think that I’ll ever stop loving it."*


**witchyaf** finds the *"the production is interesting, the chorus is dramatic, and at "come and take a walk on the wild side" when you hear her voice do something different from what it has been the whole time, it's actually pretty exciting. it's a good enough song, but i don't actively seek it out or anything."* **chihuahuazero** says *"This song is how I got into Lana Del Rey. The sweeping violins, forlorn guitar, and flittering flute all build up to the lonely Friday night. Only major downside was that she didn’t go with the more risque version of 'kiss me hard in the pouring rain.'"* **Luxmor** finds *"This is [a] song you show someone to introduce them to the music of Lana Del Rey. It's everything she is. Mysterious, catchy, a bit brooding, alluring, unique. It's the quintessential Lana song."*

**spacebabe27** calls this song a *"Pure melodramatic pop at it's absolute finest."* **skiddos** says *"The orchestration that starts off this song is amazing."* **havanabrown** says this is *"One of those songs that as soon as you hear the opening line you get excited cus of how good the song is"*

**Raicicle** says *"If Lana could vibe more with these trip-hop influences instead of being boring, that would be great."* **laalic** admits it's *"Not my favourite but definitely Lana's most iconic so it deserves respect."* **TeamAwesome4** says *"It's fine, I guess? Lana under sings everything."*
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"My favourite hobby is drinking wine and crying while listening to this song"* -**Vaktmeister**

*"Other super positive titles that were considered include, 'It’s Pointless to Exist' and 'Suffering is an Eventuality'"* -**throwaway963963963**

*"This song turned me into a sad gay."* -**huntyphobic**

**Lowest Scores:** (4 x1): throwaway963963963 / (2 x1): joshually / (0 x1): mother_rucker


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me speak in 1989 language. If Royals is the Shake It Off of Pure Heroine, then Tennis Court is the Blank Space of Pure Heroine. What those songs have in common is that SIO and Royals are lead singles and TC and BS are second singles. What I am trying to say here is that second singles are always better than lead singles. Not all the time, but always.

**Awhile2** says this is the *"best lorde single. Its a shame it got outshined by Royals and Team."* **witchyaf** finds *"this song [...] a great album opener. it has a mission statement and it's super genuine while maintaining a lot of mainstream appeal. the chorus hits with so much power, and the verses provide a great balance to it. this song is also a fantastic example of her lyrical prowess."* **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** says this is *"Pretty much my favorite Lorde song. It’s just a perfect opener to Pure Heroine because its everything I love about the album. The minimalist drum+synth based beat, Lorde’s lyrics and great vocal performance, and the way it sets up the type of unique album it is."* **SkyBlade79** says **"The “Yeah” sound is the best thing ever, I love all of the imagery in the chorus, and the production is great"** **Therokinrolla** says they *"would quote a lyric but they are all quote worthy."*

TeamAwesome4 comments "'It's a new art form showing people how little we care', Where's the sirens? Lorde is about to start dropping truth bombs all over this album, isn't she?"

**throwaway963963963** finds this song *"corny and uneventful to be an opener for such a terrific album."* **ExtraEater** comments, *"As great as it is, this hardly feels like an intro track. This entire album could've had a better tracklist imo."*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"Did she take into account no one in the U.S. cares about tennis outside Venus and Serena?"* -**MrSwearword**

*"Fuck I know I should be doing an e d g e joke on that song too but this connects with the angsty teen in me."* -**Reifiui**

Holy shit, this song just brings out a lot of memories for me. It was the summer of 2013, I graduated from high school (tenth grade, I studied in a Filipino school where back then, the tenth grade is where you graduate from high school. I believe this is no longer the case now as K+12 is now implemented in Filipino schools. Any pinoy popheads pls correct me if I am wrong). I nearly lost my new close friends I made from senior year becuase I was super clingy to them and it got annoying. I was super clingy to them because I never had a lot of close friends in school so when I found these friends and how we enjoyed each other's company, I felt so happy. Unfortunately, I took it too far by being super clingy to them. The entire summer of 2013 was me being lonely. The only people I can talk to was my parents and my best friend who did not study in the same school. Even then, those are the only three people I can talk to and I always end up being alone by myself. It was terrible. I listened to this song a lot during that summer because it captured how I felt that time. I was fucking sad and lonely. Luckily, after the end of summer, my close friends in school started talking to me again and my own version of summertime sadness was over. 

And that's why I gave this song an 11 So many memories associated with this song.

**Luxmor** finds *"The most iconic Lana song imo. It's just brilliant. The lyrics, the melody, everything about it is pretty much perfect. The height of Lana's career imo."* **gannade** loves *"The way she emphasizes the “oh,” and then pause, in “oh my god” and the way she whispers “1,2,3,4”… it’s EVERYTHING."* hellomochi "likes this better than the remix. Lana's songs shouldn't be remixed imo. It takes away the soul of the song." **Reifiui** wanted to *"make a shady comment trashing Lana in some way but this is great and I can't argue fuck."*

**SkyBlade79** says he *"actually prefer[s] the remix (don’t lynch me), but I really love this one too. The desperation in her voice is wonderful."* **skiddos** says *"The Cedric Gervais remix would get a slightly higher score from me."* 

**ExtraEater** thinks *"lorde could've done this better tho."* mother_rucker "just think[s] this song isn't that interesting. Don't @ me."**Therokinrolla** asks *"Why is this her most well known song it isn't even that great? I mean I love the whole tragic lesbian lovestory suicide angle thing but its kinda meh."*

**Bonus Comments:**

Not all the time, but always.

So does this mean Team is the Style of Pure Heroine and if so, the third and best single? **Fuck yeah.**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: #OVERALL ALBUM/ARTIST RANKING:

**My Average:** 8.369565

**Highest Averages:**

* **BlasiFeelsSwift** - 9.284783
* **sirgingerman** - 8.73913
* **spacebabe27** - 8.728261

* **zombasteseses** - 4.695652
* **LandonKidtrea** - 4.608696
* **soeri** – 4.6


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have to say that Born To Die is literally one of the best pop albums I have ever heard. I am just sad Paradise doesn't match to BTD's standards.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think I will just let **gannade**'s thoughts on the overall album fill in this write-up.

*"With her debut studio album, Lana Del Rey managed to succeed where few have: she created a fully-fleshed-out, fully-fledged, coherent persona that feels neither forced nor gimmicky. Her cinematic, 50s Americana style invokes a feeling of nostalgia for those that weren’t alive in that period, which includes Lana herself. And while she certainly isn’t the first artist to look into the past for inspiration, she’s one of the few to interpret it in such a dark, melancholy manner. Even more uniquely, she combines the anachronistic Hollywood nostalgia and lush orchestral arrangements with contemporary hard-hitting hip hop beats to create a sound that can only be described as ‘Lana Del Rey.’ “Blue Jeans” and “National Anthem” are perhaps the best portrayal of this juxtaposition on Born to Die.*

*The album isn’t without its weak spots. The majority of the Paradise EP and the bonus tracks are trite, redundant, and underdeveloped. But if the second half of Born to Die feels like a burden to listen through, it’s only because the first half already introduced us to Lana at her best. “Off to the Races” successfully and subtly invokes the themes of Lolita, whereas “Lolita” simply bludgeons the themes through our heads. Likewise, “Video Games” is a beautifully simplistic love song that feels warmer, more thoughtful, and more personal than “Lucky Ones,” “Without You,” or “Bel Air.” Album opener “Born to Die” finds Lana operating on all cylinders, combining lush instrumentation, haunting vocals, and tragic lyrics in one tour de force. And as sad and tragic as "Summertime Sadness" may be, Lana prevents it from ever feeling outright depressing, unlike "Yayo."*

*Lana’s themes and imagery has been subject to both praise and criticism. Fellow rate opponent Lorde offers only a surface-level criticism:  “…I listened to that Lana Del Rey record and the whole time I was just thinking it’s so unhealthy for young girls to be listening to, you know: “I’m nothing without you.” This sort of shirt-tugging, desperate, don’t leave me stuff. That’s not a good thing for young girls, even young people, to hear.” Sure, this is true for Lana’s lyrically weaker songs (including Without You), but Lana’s best songs are more mysterious than what Lorde gives it credit for. At her best, Lana only reveals parts of her persona, letting the listener to fill in the rest.  Perhaps this is why Lana has been described as nostalgic - she leaves an opening to place your own feelings and ideas into her own music, making you long for something that you may have never even experienced. While Born to Die may be bogged down by its filler, there is a reason this album survived the SNL backlash and stayed on the Billboard 200 for over 250 weeks. It’s influential, iconic, revolutionary, and above all, it’s good. While Lana will only further refine her sound in Ultraviolence and Honeymoon, the rough edges of Born to Die is what make it such a compelling listen. You're listening to the birth of a popstar."*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*"God, this was painful to get through. I'm sorry, this album is B O R I N G, save for the 2nd half of Disc 1. Disc 2 was a fucking nightmare. Your favorite track got my 0. Wouldn't listen to it all the way through EVER AGAIN."* -**soeri**

*""100% Lana's best work"* -**laalic**

*"Born to Die is really a great album, but Paradise is so lackluster compared to it. How did she manage to be that boring? Still, the album was unique, and it set a precedent for daddy dom weirdos all around the world."* -**Skiddos**

*"Even though Lana only gets better with each album, nearly all the songs on Born to Die feel timeless."* -**Verdantshade**

*"For such a large album, I have to say BTD is super impressive. I honestly love so many songs here and when i started I was like "oh shit am I being super biased here or what???" because there's so many good songs here, but then I remembered it makes sense since there's also many more than in the other two. Overall, another one of my favorite albums ever and if Marina gets robbed like she probably will, I hope at least Lana Del Slay can take the title. (Unless 400 Lux wins, but that won't happen."* -**Luxmor**

*"to me, this is the worst of her discography, not that it’s that bad, but UV and Honeymoon are better. Somehow the paradise EP feels worse when you tack it on the end of this."* -**julry**

*"I was going to comment on more of the songs but honestly most of what I was saying was either a repeat or a continuation of something I said before (much like every song sounds like it’s just repeating or continuing a song that came before it) so I’m just gonna lay it all out here. Seems to me like this album’s theme is “Imagine how good this album would be if LITERALLY ANYONE ELSE were singing”. Lana sounds like a drunk woman singing along to the classical music playing in the hotel lobby. Listening to this album was like trying to swim through liquid cement. It’s honestly not fair comparing this hot piece of garbage to Pure Heroine and Electra Heart. It wouldn’t even be fair comparing her songs to ASMR videos."* -**LandonKidtrea**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"I C O N I C GOAT best ever, if u don't like then get out fat."* -**Therokinrolla**

*"im so glad i've listened to most of these songs already or i would have the most depressing hour long adventure through this album."* -**OberionSynth**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Storytime with ExtraEater:**

Lana was sitting sad in a retirement home and she was just about ready to die. Suddenly, an old Lorde entered her room looking sad. "So, you're going?" 

Lana nodded reluctantly. In a no longer honey-sweet voice, she said, "Yes, but first I have to tell you something."

Lorde slowly approached her when Lana pulled out a knife and stabbed in her in the shoulders. "What are you doing, Lana?" 

Lana clinched her fists. "Choose your last words, this is the last time." 

Lorde screamed in agony. "What do you mean?"

"Cause you and I, we were born to die."

And they died.

I don't think she is underrated, Swifties are still huge about her (like me, peep me for that dedicated stan award y'all). She just hasn't done anything this year to be excited about.

But I'm still fucking pumped for TS6. The gap year really adds to the excitement.

**Lowest Scores:** (6.5 x2): TeamAwesome4, SkyBlade79 / (5 x1): Look_A_Fangirl / (2 x2): MrSwearword, joshually

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Reifiui** says that *"Bitch if this isn't top 10 I swear I'm gonna... Be kinda grumpy a bit and then get a glass of water, I guess."* Guess what? Not only this went to the top 10, it's also at the top of the list!

Wow, you guys really like this song to death. Which is very understandable. The fear of growing up is scary and you guys have a really personal attachment to the song due to that fear. With that, I am very happy to see this song take the #1 spot.

**soeri** says *"This is the song you'll cry to while remembering your high school friends, your youth and graduation. Getting old is scary, yes, but this song never will."* **Skiddos** comments *"Yeesh she's such an amazing songwriter, to think that she was only 16 when the album was released!"* **Cryomatic** says that *"the intro, the intimate prose, the pulsating and building instrumental, the climax – everything is just perfect."* **throwaway963963963** says *"Pop songs about relationships that aren’t romantic are treasures. The structure and pacing are mindblowing, and I love how it’s so calm yet tragic at the same time."* **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** loves "how different this song sounds then the first few songs. It almost reminds me of something on Emotion. Sounds almost retro." **rudhira_kali_ca** says "This song almost brings tears to my eyes. While "Royals" brings me back to autumn 2013, this brings me back to my childhood, before depression was a thing for me." ExtraEater calls this song "The infinitely better Stressed Out"


**TeamAwesome4** says "It is scary getting old, but this song lacks a lot of punch to make me feel anything more than agreeing with her thesis statement." **SkyBlade79** says "this might just be my upbringing without any like super great friends in my life ever, but I really never got why people are so attached and emotional song. It’s not bad, but you people love it more than I can fathom." **joshually** is disappointed, commenting *"This song has been major hyped in /r/popheads. I’m coming into this with extreme prejudice. It's not an offensive song per se, but there's nothing about it that catches me, nothing I can truly relate to. Maybe I need to be a white teenage girl?' -*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

"it does feel so scary getting old :(" -superr_rad

"Makes me feel nostalgic about the friends I never had." -huntyphobic

**Lowest Scores:** (6.5 x1): mother_rucker / (6 x2): MrSwearword, letsallpoo / (5 x1): joshually / (4 x1): booooam

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I feel like this song is such a "underdog unite!" anthem and I love this so much. 

**BlasiFeelsSwift** feels the same way, commenting *"I love the idea of this brotherhood of teenagers against the common enemy."* **skiddos** calls *"this is her catchiest song yet."* **spacebabe27** says *"This song is better than anything ever released by Marina and Lana (Except for Ride)"* SkyBlade79 loves the song, saying *"This is probably my favorite song off of PH, and the lyrics are perfect to form an image in your mind’s eye."* TeamAwesome4 says "The chorus is golden, perfect, and pure." **hellomochi** says *"The almost acapella intro hooked me from the start. The imagery in the lyrics, coupled with the laidback beats, just lured me into a dream-like state."*

 **witchyaf** *"like[s] this song a lot, especially listening to it now with the lyrics in front of me, but something about it never felt like a very strong single compared to the rest of her catalog. it's still amazing, just not quite as amazing as the rest."* **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** feels like he "actually remember[s] this one being more overplayed then Royals for some reason. It’s kind of a Royals pt. 2 though but with a heavier beat and a different view on similar themes." 


**mother_rucker** is not impressed, commenting  *"Girl, you were like 16 when this song was written. How old were you when reveled without a care?"*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bonus Comments:**

*"I Can't Believe It's Not Max Martin!"* -**letsallpoo**

*"I thought we were on each other's team" ~Lorde before Lana killed her."* -**ExtraEater**

*"the girl that wrote this song is now in Taylor Swift's #squad just sayin"* -**superr_rad**

**Highest Averages:**

* **booooam** - 5.5625
* **Kaphox** - 5.125
* **MrSwearword** – 4.8
* **joshually** - 3.1875


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow, it's impressive how this young New Zealander can be this talented on her debut album. While I am more in favor for Lana and Marina, to deny's Lorde's insane talent especially in her songwriting is sinful. I am very excited where Lorde takes us next with her new record. Low-key hoping it's like the sound of The Love Club with the lyricism of Pure Heroine. 

*"Okay this album is basically perfect and might dominate but it doesn't get me a sassy as BTD does. and thats okay bc this album is legendary."* -**Therokinrolla**

*"I didn't realize how much I loved this album until this rate."* -**BionicFunhouse**

*"The musical equivalent of a palate cleanser after having to listen to 23 fucking LDR songs. Not sorry."* -**soeri**

*"A great album. Pretty much all of her songs are whining about something but I love whining so I don't mind."* -**laalic**

*"Pure Heroine is a minimalist pop masterpiece. I think Lorde left a great impression with this one album."* -**Skiddos**

*"The album I'm least familiar with, so I was a bit generous with the scores. However, it is an extremely enjoyable listen, and incredible how a 16 year old wrote it."* -**Verdantshade**

*"Memes can't express how much I love this album."* -**Vaktmeister**

*"I wasn't a huge fan of Lorde before this rate tbh, but after listening to all of this I really changed my mind about her and realise she has a lot more to give than I first thought. There are a lot of songs I'll be adding to my playlist from this album now and I have /r/popheads and this rate to thank, so thanks guys! And even though she's going up against two of my faves, I still wish Lorde the best here, because she's also really great."* -**Luxmor**

*"literally the only bad thing about this masterpiece is that it has so many fewer songs on it than Boring to Die "* -**julry**

*"This was the first pop album I could say that I love after being anti-pop most of my life and it has a special place in my heart."* -**rudhira_kali_ca**

*"Best album of this rate, easily. Lorde’s lyrical prowess is a thing of beauty. She paints such a finely detailed picture of being a teenager in today’s world, without drowning the listener in exposition. The lyrics and instrumentation work together and create an immersive and relatable listening experience. Pure Heroine is the definition of atmospheric."* -**LandonKidtrea**

*" Every song on this album has a lyrical highlight. Even the ones I didn't like. Even though I gave Born To Die a higher average, I enjoyed this album the most"* -**alternativeoxygen**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Storytime with ExtraEater:**

Critically acclaimed and well-received by some non-music fans I'm friends with, who said, "Oh wow, I really love those lyrics. Also, she sounds like that girl who sang Royals. Except, you know, better.

If you start an albums with high AF expectations, you will come out with low scores, but if you just let yourself enjoy the songs you will love it more.

deleted: I adore the album. Also, I don't rate the albums in rates as I would irl, I rate them in respect to the other songs in the rate. Which is why most of the scores I have to Lorde were a nine or higher, I felt as though they were that score in comparison to the other songs in the thread (i.e. Bubblegum Bitch).

joshually: Do I need to reexamine Lorde? Everyone here gaggin and salivatin like cray over her. 



She just didn't do it for me. It was my first and only time listening to PH and I just wasnt moved. I absolutely love Royals and its melodic catchiness and verse prechorus chorus movement. Maybe I'm just too much of a mainstream traditionalist?
[/r/popheads/comments/5h9zq7/rate_results_marina_v_lana_v_lorde_finale/dayvlzw/]

=====

mirandacrocsgrove: to be fair, this sub is composed of people born probably in mid - late 90's where Lorde's lyricism deals with the fear of getting older, being aloof, shy or awkward and overcoming them, and her experiences as a teenager herself which greatly resonates with a lot of us.
[/r/popheads/comments/5h9zq7/rate_results_marina_v_lana_v_lorde_finale/dayvq4j/]

joshually: Oh goodness. I'm literally twice the high school age and it was a bleak and dreary point in my life I'm not sure id want to revisit. 


But 


that's what it was. Listening to PH kept me thinking about and vividly visualizing high school and hangin at the quads, waiting in the hallways between classes, that despondency and urgency of the moments after school, the lame cliques, that uneasy uncomfortable awkward feeling that just constantly pervaded your every breathe every move every thought and every action and I just didn't like that. 


Self reflection. It ain't pretty.

NapsAndNetflix: Father, but more realistically Confident. You?
[/r/popheads/comments/5h9zq7/rate_results_marina_v_lana_v_lorde_finale/dayvqq1/]

=====

deleted: Father was my 11, especially having never heard it before.

My general thoughts are the following:

Miley's album wasn't as bad as I thought. About a third of it was solid, amazing bop material, the other 2 thirds was total ass.

Selena had the most well rounded album, but the extra tracks were kinda unneeded, and the singles were probably the best out of them all, and I think every song on that album got a 7 or higher.

Demi's good songs were FUCKING AMAZING. But her mediocre songs were total trash. So, all in all, as albums go, Revival>Confident>Bangerz, but I hope Father gets the top spot, with maybe Confident in the top five, but the rest occupied by Selena.
[/r/popheads/comments/5h9zq7/rate_results_marina_v_lana_v_lorde_finale/dayvxhr/]

=====

NapsAndNetflix: I hate to break it to you but I don't do *well* in rates and I'm pretty much the same.

Bangerz was really awful imo apart from the singles.

Selena's album was a lot of filler but also a lot of fun.

Demi stole my wig or whatever it is you guys say.
