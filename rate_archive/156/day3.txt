**RandomHypnotica** (10): I think what makes this track work so well is that Superorganism‚Äôs persistent maximalism actually makes *sense* here. The camera flashes, champagne bubbling and other noises here add to the whole ‚Äúchasing the glamorous life of fame‚Äù shtick, and the fact that the verses are fairly lowkey in contrast help to keep it from being too much to handle. Plus that hook is undeniably catchy.

**Uberpigeon** (10): one of my more embarrassing tens but it's unfortunately a huge banger

---

#Fame Monsters

**akanewasright** (10): This is like the one spog song I‚Äôll claim

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): People who tank this album you WON‚ÄôT be famous because you‚Äôll just blend into the mob.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): they just pick bangers for rate trailers it‚Äôs true

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this should have been the music playing while Dream did his face reveal

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): picture this. High school Dachi, aged 16, all social awkwardness and nerdiness. Living a free range kiwi childhood, wandering the beaches of my hometown with my school friends, grabbing frozen cokes at Maccas and being nuisances at the kids paddling pool. I did alright at school, but at that point I had kinda resigned to being average and all because I could not figure out how to push my grades past the basic passing grade. I would spend a lot of time at my best friends house, where we‚Äôd go with her family to the local Chinese restaurant and get all you can eat plates and bring it back to hers. I spent a weekend at hers that I still remember as one of the happiest in my life - I‚Äôve talked a lot about my complicated feelings on dating your best friends brother but for that weekend it was the best decision I ever made because the dynamic just worked and at that point, her brother and I got on like a house on fire. We went to their Nan‚Äôs, ate a killer pineapple cake, wandered through stores and the beach, and it was one of the only times where I‚Äôve felt truly free and like I was living life to its full potential. How does it relate to this song? Well, being me, I listened to a lot of music. I was obsessed with this song, 50 scrobbles obsessed according to my last.fm, which isn‚Äôt a lot but it was saved to my phone pre-last.fm so I‚Äôve likely listened a lot more. When I hear this song, I remember being 16, feeling free, and being truly happy. Maybe there‚Äôs a fair amount of rose-tinted glasses involved, but if I had to pick the best year of my life, it would be 2018. 

 And of all the songs in this rate - this song was the only one that I actually listened to in 2018. I knew MGMT from the Oracular Spectacular singles, and my brother owning Congratulations but I hadn‚Äôt heard a peep from Little Dark Age, and I wouldn‚Äôt discover KKB until 2019. So, if I had to pick the one song in 2018 Indie Pop that 16 year old me would love, and the one that I‚Äôm most nostalgic for, it‚Äôs this song. It‚Äôs very much a product of its time, and I‚Äôm not sure if I would‚Äôve liked it if I‚Äôd listened to it for the first time doing this rate, but god does nostalgia make everything seem better.

**fadedblue09** (10): From the title alone I knew this was gonna be some pretentious commentary but it actually bops so I can overlook it

**nt96** (10): Total Drama teas

**pig-serpent** (10): A song that is both trying too hard and not trying hard enough, it melts into itself with a hypnotic beat, perfect hook, and some nice surprises to keep you on your toes.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): they were the first influencers. superinfluencers if you will

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): wow they wrote a catchy hook for this one (and it worked on me!)

**welcome2thejam** (10): Was my second favorite song at the time back in 2018, behind the band whose recent rate trajectory is honestly their ceiling: Snail Mail

**apatel27** (9.5): All I wanna do is *cha-ching*

**destroyallhumans2** (9): slaps live

**frogaranaman** (9): this makes me feel like I'm in a greenscreen music video walking in place while someone animated in me walking thru Hollywood Blvd.

**homestarguy** (9): Funny this song came out very shortly before TikTok blew up lol.

**Roxieloxie** (9): this hook is actually really good

**jman457** (8.6): Party in the USA‚Äôs cooler older bisexual sister

**1998tweety** (8.5): ended Kanye

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): everybody wants to be famous and everybody wants to love you!!!!

**flava** (8.5): glitchy lovely ditty that references my favourite lonely island song. What more could I ask for?

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This is kinda interesting because I feel like we don‚Äôt often hear indie pop songs that are this explicitly pro-fame, but the message is appropriate considering this was their first song after they low-key sold out (what exactly were they doing on the Lego Movie soundtrack?). But also if we start naming indie artists who sold out then we‚Äôd be here all day, so.

**starla\_** (8.5): classic, one of the defining songs of 2018 for me

**imbaby122** (8.3): this song would be really good in a mash-up with ch-ching by chairlift (opinion not at all influenced by ch-ching sound effects)

**camerinian** (8): uh oh guess who forgot about the chipmunk voice on the bridge? The rest is still a cool vibe though

**jasannn** (8): an even edgier version of tongue-tied

**just\_thonking** (8): Can't believe this is the first song I knew from this rate cause I heard it back in 2018

**Stryxen** (8): I seriously love this song but god I would be LIVID if this is the highest song from this album

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): This is the theme song for TDI in an alternate dimension

**heysoupie** (7.9): iphone commercial fodder but in a fun way

**freav** (7.5): total drama island

**seanderlust** (7.5): everybody wants that familiar froot moment

**TiltControls** (7.5): Okay this grew on me a little

**runaway3212** (7): this video is literally what happend to charli d'amelio

**vayyiqra** (7): The beginning of the infamous Superorganism "quirky indie pop" arc is arguably on this track. Hardly the most original concept, but here the "disaffected bored girl intoning mildly cynical lyrics" trope is working better here than it does on many other songs by this band. It's way too busy (why do you have cash register samples? are you trying to be Pink Floyd) and their use of annoyingly pitched up -and- pitched down vocals is not great, but it's got a good chorus I guess.

**impla77** (6.3): doesn‚Äôt excite me

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6): it's like Royals but passed on via Gartic Phone

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): it feels like they‚Äôre progressively getting more high the more the track goes on

**reput4tionera** (6): i think this is too millennial for me

#We live in a society

**NFLfreak98** (5.5): ghost-written by AJR?

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (5.5): This is arguably the closet platonic idea to what Superorganism could/should/would achieve. It's both so goddamn annoying and yet entirely admirable: the truest example of the "shrodenginer's 0/11" paradox I have found my mind ending up rating at. when such a case happens, you slot a 5.5, indicating "well it exists" and it broke my scale. Like Orono is totally genius here and clearly understood "this is a good lyric I should keep it". it's the one perspective on this album she has any real legit ability to convey and make me lean in. everything about the instrumental is either the worst or best tribute to MIA you will ever hear. it has removed any of the political aspects of MIA's pleasure though, completely streamlining it into a late 2010s "shrug" about social media and streaming. it nails chill vibes but is designed for people who are deeply afraid to admit "Mac DeMarco's 2 had ideas". like I just have to commend absolutely next-level decision making to arrive at THIS piece of mid. admirable beyond belief. they deserve all the money in the world for this.

**plastichaxan** (5): I want to be more famous than everyone so what now

**freeofblasphemy** (4.5): Thank you for the insight on society, Superorganism

**indie\_fan\_** (1): It just sounds like the entire song is flat-

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): when people told me this is considered to be the best song on the album i thought they were playing a prank on me. i can not fathom how anyone can get even the slightest amount of enjoyment out of this its on the same level as annoying as dance monkey

**bogo** (0): this is literally just a generic radio pop song but with annoying synths slapped on it to make it even more horrible. you really can't get that much less inspired than this.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the PERFECT opener, instantly nails the 80‚Äôs aesthetic, between the aerobics core fitness instructions, and those delicious delicious synths, it‚Äôs a wonderful introduction to the album.

**Uberpigeon** (10): This song is so unique and fun and I thought it would do a lot better than it did. I guess it didn‚Äôt work out enough.

---

#Ready to have some fun

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): We hate exercising! Relatable kings!

**bogo** (10): this is wii fit core i love it

**camerinian** (10): very glad to be in a relationship where both of us are mutually lazy and only work out to justify eating literally anything at any time

**cremeebrulee** (10): "welcome to the shitshow" omg they predicted the reveal

**flava** (10): this is just such a fun little bop about some guy who is completely oblivious to why the relationship never worked. With the female vocals sarcastically taunting Andrew like a jazzercise instructor from the 80s with what he believes was the reason the relationship is falling apart, and she might be superficial, but she's also doing something that makes her feel good while he isn't. Before she ends it in the same way she would end one of those 80s exercise videos. All while being filled to the brim with sticky hooks and lovely little instrumental moments like the descending synths. Excellent little song.

**homestarguy** (10): me and who???? (‚óï‚Äø‚óï)

**runaway3212** (10): just such a banger

**sage** (10): imagine the rest of the album slayed like this.

**Stryxen** (10): this album is so gay they cannot have recorded this without passionately making out for hours before and after

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): there‚Äôs no reason a song about breaking up with a girl because she does too much exercise should bop this hard

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (10): I remember hearing this on KCRW and having no clue who it was but def vibing to it. For someone that really does not buy into the mgmt worship, truth is that they know how to make sick af pop that also belongs in the DDR machine at nickel city with perf "sad face but uwu" delivery. forreal tho, Left MGMT does an aching mumble slog of a reading here that just happens to sell this. that shit YEARNS while the soundscape stays unwieldy playful.

**freav** (9.5): this is just mujer robusta by sinergia

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): I‚Äôll be real‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt expect this to slay so hard but I‚Äôm moving and dancing to this! The vintage home workout video vibe is an inspired choice and the little samples that peep in and out add a lot of flavor. I just wish it was a tad bit shorter because at a certain point it just stops getting fresher.

**NFLfreak98** (9.5): it turns out 80s workout videos were kinda bangers?

**moonagenightmares** (9.3): she‚Äôs goals

**akanewasright** (9): something something that new shapes Video with clown music

**apatel27** (9): It's funny because indieheads don't work out

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Cheeky

**starla\_** (8.5): a fun lo-fi bop

**jman457** (8.3): This reminds me of AHS: 1984 intro in a good way

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): very cool opener

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.2): Jane Fonda in the 80s anthem

**a-man-with-a-perm** (8): can you imagine the levels of ironic snark you receive in the first message if you matched a member of MGMT on Tinder

**CrimsonROSET** (8): we love a sax

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): this feels like an argument that would happen on a flight that an extremely online Twitter person would recap in a long Twitter thread to the delight of other extremely online Twitter weirdos

**destroyallhumans2** (8): have you heard of the nineteen eighties?!

**imbaby122** (8): me on leg day (when i wear my 10 pound boots around campus)

**vayyiqra** (8): This intro makes me think "lol this is practically a Magbay song, if Popheads dunks on this I'm calling bullshit" and that's exactly what I predict will happen.

**jasannn** (7.5): why is this giving sonic?

**pig-serpent** (7.5): This feels like it's supposed to be a parody of 80s workout nostalgiabait, but at the same time it's trying to have its cake and eat it too.  As a result, it's not and interesting enough subversion for me to care about a topic that I have very little interested in to begin with.  At least musically I think it works decently well, and thats the main thing that counts.

**impla77** (7.3): think they‚Äôre incompatible

**reput4tionera** (7): this ran like one minute too long

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): The FitnessGram Pacer test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter Pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal *boop*. A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound *ding*. Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.

**welcome2thejam** (7): I hope no one will ever ever say this about me

**whizzer0** (7): omg is this a sax album let's see if my theory that any pop song is made better with a brass section holds

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): an attack on soul cyclists across the nation

**plastichaxan** (6): Okay I see where the gay allegations come from also this is kinda imprinted in my mind cause two of my friends forced me to listen to this album on vinyl after I told them I didn‚Äôt want to, making it the second album I listened to in vinyl

#It didn't work out

**freeofblasphemy** (5.5): Ending your opening song with ‚Äúokay we‚Äôre done‚Äù would be a power move if the song was better

**Awkward\_King** (5): "maybe im in a movie" yeah girl its *Men (2022)* good luck in this rate

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): giving WE lyrics vibes and KKB instrumentals

**heysoupie** (5): pretty bland

**TiltControls** (5): There are parts I enjoy this and others where's it's just too much for me to want to process as a listenable song

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (2): what the actual fuck

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I think at some point in everyone‚Äôs life we‚Äôve all thought about what we would say to our future selves, and KKB sums it up well here, particularly the feeling as you reach your 20‚Äôs and you‚Äôre still trying to find out who you are, and who you *want* to be, but time continues to move on whether you‚Äôre getting to the person you imagined or not. This is some of sarah‚Äôs best lyricism imo, and i‚Äôm glad to see it get the respect it deserves!

**Uberpigeon** (10): First of all‚Ä¶ WHY are you fuckers calling this a glee song. When I first heard this song I thought it was genius and I think it's the best lyrical content in KKBs whole catalogue. I guess the song didn‚Äôt do too badly but the doo doo doo production didn‚Äôt seem to resonate with everyone!

#Future Nostalgia

**akanewasright** (10): This dumbass growing up song that makes me wanna cry

**apatel27** (10): Can I give a second 11? This is such a beautiful track

**celladonn** (10): this is making me burst into tears lol

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): so sweet, the MIDI renfaire music works tbh. Also when it started the ‚Äúdo-do-dos‚Äù made me think ‚Äúglee vibes‚Äù which is so cursed I‚Äôve been on this sub for TOO LONG

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): imagine if your future self lived in Australia‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd be time traveling to take my tasteless ass out

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This really foreshadowed the fairytale-like sound and positive themes they‚Äôd go with their next EPs. I‚Äôm smiling.

**homestarguy** (10): We love introspective Chamber Bleep Bloops

**plastichaxan** (10): The opener of my breakdown playlist if you see me looping this among other songs mind your business<3

**reput4tionera** (10): try not to cry challenge (impossible)

**sage** (10): best song ever

**Stryxen** (10): FutureMe.org u will always be famous. when my letter from 2018 comes next year u better believe this will be on loop. I used to be fine/ because you always seemed so far away/ but now I feel our paths getting closer each day/ its rather strange.

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): the first half of this is the Pet Sounds-ification of KKB

**heysoupie** (9.4): how do you know i‚Äôm such a nostalgic bitch

**pig-serpent** (9): I love how triumpant and epic the instrumental of this song sounds.

**TiltControls** (9): Pondering the future/past is an easy way to get a great score from me if done well and KKB do a great job here

**freav** (8.6): doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

**imbaby122** (8.6): dear future self is my mom still alive and if not why are you still alive????

**bogo** (8.5): they got an orchestra for this how can i not give it a positive score

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Don‚Äôt let the existential dread set it. Don‚Äôt let it set in.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): kkb at the horrid first minute store

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i didnt come into this rate expecting kkb to give me a existential crisis

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): dear future self it is time for your daily remembering the past and cringing session. yes honey

**welcome2thejam** (8): Feels like a reverse graduation song, like she's staring down the cover of Bonito Generation

**jman457** (7.7): If grimes guest stared on Glee and did a cover of a Megan Trainor song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.7): reverse Hold the Girl. why is the background giving Glee Don‚Äôt Stop Believin' though

**1998tweety** (7.5): Dear Future Husband >>>>>

**jasannn** (7.5): disney parade music

**Awkward\_King** (7): this is the kind of corny kkb song that im like.. ok... you can stay

**CrimsonROSET** (7): the marching drums bring this down but i really like the themes/lyrics, also that transition is pretty sick

**frogaranaman** (7): I would not listen to my past self

**runaway3212** (7): a bit meh compared to some of the other songs here

**cremeebrulee** (6.7): these lyrics are too good to be wasted on a song that sounds like this

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6.5): "But now I feel our paths getting closer each day" : (

**impla77** (6.3): first half has some annoying glee like backing, second half very final fantasy. Think lyrics are clever

**thedoctordances1940** (6.2): gleecore (derogatory)

**vayyiqra** (6): Oh god, my future self? He's like 45. I think this song, and album, hits best when you're like 20 and unsure of yourself. I'm already the age of the future self I'd be thinking of back then, so it's not hitting the same. Nice concept though.

#Living in the present

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (6): Here's a great vocal and lyric performance with a mid instrumentation. baroque steven universe ass shit? no.

**zukomu** (5): I love the sounds they‚Äôre playing with in this song, I just wish it was better

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I honestly think this song is the highlight of the EP, even more so than Only Acting. There‚Äôs just a magic here that was captured so well, and sarah is so right, I *do* know how it is, as you get older and you drift apart from people you thought you‚Äôd be friends with for your whole life.

**Uberpigeon** (10): the little non-album track that could! So happy this song got its dues, I only really discovered it this year and it‚Äôs such a fucking banger I‚Äôm really pleased it made it so far.

---

#Knows how it is

**reput4tionera** (10): yeah i do know how it is ur so right sarah

**impla77** (8.7): I do know how it is

**freav** (8.5): i do know how it is

**celladonn** (7.5): girl... i do know how it is

#show me that you're super in the know

**apatel27** (11): You Know How It Is The Best Song Here

**destroyallhumans2** (11): perfect perfect perfect

**nt96** (11): the fast-paced sugary/gritty sounds got my attention but it was the lyrics that hooked me because I know the feeling all too well. I was gonna give Hot Pink my 11 but this one couldn't leave my head and ultimately won me over.

**Awkward\_King** (10): ive not given this enough credit i really love this wow

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I may prefer bleepbloops but guitars can be slay sometimes too!

**camerinian** (10): kkb just doing straight up fuzzy indie rock really tickled me when i heard this the first time and I don‚Äôt quite know why

**homestarguy** (10): Shoulda been on TnP. An absolute slapper and a half. That guitar solo. :)

**imbaby122** (10): ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bunch of crap. You don‚Äôt wanna know how we feel, because when people ask you to ‚Äúexpress your feelings‚Äù, they don‚Äôt mean your actual feelings. They mean the feelings that they want you to have, because people can‚Äôt deal with dark or scary, or weird. They want you to smile and say: ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine, everything‚Äôs great‚Äù, because then they can just go on with their boring lives, and never think about you again.‚Äù - Miles Hollingsworth III


**runaway3212** (10): YASSSSSSSSS

**Stryxen** (10): EEEEEEEE EEEE EEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

**welcome2thejam** (10): The unrivaled smasha, I used to think it was too short, but actually the perfect length to repeat again & again to get that brief guitar solo serotonin boost

**jasannn** (9.5): more sonic music

**TiltControls** (9.5): GUITAR SOLO!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): hypno you‚Äôre right this one is great

**vayyiqra** (9): After nitpicking fuzzy guitar KKB for this whole ballot so far suddenly I love the fuzz. Idk, this is good. Almost surf-rock with the drumbeat. The "two-minute ditty" thing works here too because it wouldn't be good if they made it longer.

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (9): sarah can you tell me wear you got your pants from Im trying to pull off some sick fits and I think those pants are exactly what I need here tbh. sarah, you can take your time Im patient. I know you prolly didnt tell the other guys in KKB (who dont slay as hard in their fits) bc you wanted to keep winning) but PLEASE make an exception for me.


**heysoupie** (8.5): i don‚Äôt mind these vocals. I like the idea of a kitschy indie band that doesn‚Äôt have weird baggage (cough- Weezer-cough)

**seanderlust** (8.5): added a point because the guitar solo rips

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): omg a guitar

**starla\_** (8.5): this sounds like Alvvays

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): wait... this is kinda better than like almost everything on the main album

**freeofblasphemy** (8): FUCK YEAH GUITAR SOLO

**jman457** (6.7): bops a bit

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6.5): not even filling the kettle correctly in the song art wtf


**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): this would be so much better if the production wasnt drowning out every single instrument

**CrimsonROSET** (4): is this bubblegrunge

**flava** (2): please stop with the mixing like this, it just sounds wrong and textureless. I‚Äôve heard punk songs with better balance. I actually really liked how this song just cut loose, and the electric guitar just shredding. But this just sounds wrong

#Does not know how it is

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): me to KKB and TDCC - no, I don‚Äôt know anything

**1998tweety** (6): no i actually dont

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): I don‚Äôt know actually but I sure hope it isn‚Äôt like this‚Ä¶ is she in a different room than the microphone?

**1998tweety** (9): pretty

**imbaby122** (9): kinda epic lookin

**vayyiqra** (9): A very cool kind of propulsion where they shoot out jets of water and also bioluminescent? As a man of science with an interest in animal physiology that does rule. I'm not that big on invertebrates overall but these are pretty cool. Being a whole animal that's a colony of organisms also gives us some intriguing ideas about how multicellular life evolved from single-celled organisms. Scientifically, these are really interesting.

**whizzer0** (9): fucking love the existential romanticism of the ocean. google dictionary plugin coming in handy here. also these things look so cool I mean what a colour scheme

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): wait these look kinda sick

**akanewasright** (8): oh these guys, they‚Äôre cool

**seanderlust** (10): pretty cool letter! also the literal middle of the alphabet i think

**reput4tionera** (9): it‚Äôs a fun looking letter

**vayyiqra** (9): Not the most aesthetic letter but to its credit it is very dependable, almost always represents the voiced bilabial nasal (IPA: /m/) like it says it does, with only rare exceptions like showing where nasalized vowels are (which is more often done with N). Since this is an almost universal phoneme in all human languages, the Latin script needs a simple letter for it, and M "does the job".

Also I'm not sure where to put this but I wanted to mention that I've been listening to these albums and rating them at the same time as playing IFComp entries and rating them with a near-identical rating system so I apologise if I accidentally confused any and said Superorganism had a sweet story but failed to do anything interesting with its interactive component

**RandomHypnotica** (11): oh Time Today, my poor little meow meow‚Ä¶ This was the song that really made me fall in love with KKB, and how fitting that since the time we rated my previously most listened song in ratemas, this has overtaken it to become my most played song on last.fm with over 600 plays at the time of writing. Finding this song at a time when I had just finished Uni, and had just started a job, and the lyrics just connected with me so strongly. My job was casual, so I was able to allow myself plenty of time to do things that I wanted, while still being able to sustain myself, but all that time just felt so‚Ä¶ meaningless, i could do so much but I no longer had any clear goal to work towards. I had all this time and nothing to put it towards. And what I love about this track is what I love about the whole album really, it‚Äôs bleak and clearly comes from a state of disillusionment and depression, but there‚Äôs a pervasive sense of optimism running throughout, this bubbly infecitousness that just won‚Äôt go away, and listening to this song just makes me feel so‚Ä¶ complete. I‚Äôm glad to see it made Day 3, but I did wish it had gone a bit higher (and I wish there was at least another 11 :( )

**Uberpigeon** (10): Ah‚Ä¶ Hypno‚Äôs poor little meow meow. Lyrically this could have been in bonito generation but the gloomy production gives it a certain deeper ominous feeling to it. They really nailed the feeling of doing nothing all day while thinking about all the things you could be doing. Mood!

**Stryxen** (10): ugh she was kicking her legs in the air and giggling while writing this. every time I have a day off this is always on loop if you get it you get it if you don't you don't

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): ended Pink Flop

**TiltControls** (10): Almost gave this the 11, but something else won out. There are so many fun touches in the song that make it memorably despite the short runtime

**welcome2thejam** (10): Sarah's voice & the instrumental & the melody are all gorgeous, love the bright sheen covering over what's bubbling under the surface

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): waking up to this is a religious experience

**jasannn** (9.5): I feel like one of those cartoon suns smiling and singing with the main character

**heysoupie** (9.4): I should play myself this song on days I feel like everything is overwhelming

**cremeebrulee** (9.3): something fun something for the october time

**runaway3212** (9): my god this song is good

**slimboyfriend** (9): so much time to be depressed

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): is this jazzy? it feels jazzy but also idk if its correct to say its jazzy

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): me when i skip uni

**imbaby122** (8.5): this is the college experience (plz help me)

**pig-serpent** (8): The best of the cutesy, dreamy songs on this album.  While the darker side is the far better collection of songs, credit where credit is due.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): oh this isn't really as good as i remember

**camerinian** (7.5): there's the bones of an absolute bop in here, it's kinda mixed like ass though


**impla77** (7): perfectly pleasant song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): ~~dont you know im still standing better than i ever did~~

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (7): the whole ARG thing for the music videos is brilliant. i feel it sarah. i feel all the books and tapes (too many tapes) in my little world. I have all the time today!


**a-man-with-a-perm** (6): I got so much time today after working 9-5....

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this song has a big nostalgia vibe for some reason? like this is peak frolicking music

**freeofblasphemy** (5): Just sounds like a million fuzzy dream pop songs

**starla\_** (5): this is noisy but not in the best way

#Procrastinators

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): me when I lie to myself

**sage** (10): best song ever

**vayyiqra** (10): "Ah, I do have so much time today" I think, aware I do not and will waste at least half the day dicking around before doing anything productive, because I have severe ADHD and it's awful.

**jman457** (7.3): cute

**1998tweety** (6): 1:45am

**akanewasright** (9.1): music to skip through a field to, lyrics to think about skipping through a field to but thinking it might be a hassle to leave your bedroom to get there and you don‚Äôt remember if you took your allergy meds and it would be kind of silly to skip through a field (but you would also have fun) so you just stay inside and think about the work you‚Äôre not making any progress on‚Ä¶ to

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): me doing this rate on the Saturday extension period (update: I am now completing this rate on my phone as my internet died on the Sunday extension deadline so this whole song is tragic tbh)

**Uberpigeon** (10): A total smasha!!! This is the one deep cut that really slays and for a while it was their highest song which was funny.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): I‚Äôm genuinely shocked that this managed to make it as high as it did, and at one point it was definitively the top MGMT song in the rate‚Ä¶ I guess all it takes to make popheads enjoy MGMT more is make your 80s bop about suicide

---

#You got that one thing

**apatel27** (10): Why does every indie artist want to kill themselves

**Awkward\_King** (10): clitoris

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶this might be the clit of the album low-key.

**cremeebrulee** (10): mgmters tossing their 11s to this album as if that one extra point will do anything

**starla\_** (10): I love the 80s

**Stryxen** (10): collapsing on the floor dramatically‚Ä¶ over and over you die just to feel alive :coversface:

**welcome2thejam** (10): Very solid til it hits the second half, where it becomes incredible

**thedoctordances1940** (9.6): like this is just such a fantastic song it sounds incredible but i feel like this will be robbed for some reason

**impla77** (9.5): production is so good especially distortion at end

**moonagenightmares** (9.5): this sounds straight out the 80s and its like the only type of 80s pop music i love

**imbaby122** (9.1): the most 80s 2020s song. and that‚Äôs saying something

**1998tweety** (9): this bops

**a-man-with-a-perm** (9): Just when you think the album is slipping away from them, on comes this banger

**runaway3212** (9): the one thing left to try to save their average was make good music and it worked

**vayyiqra** (9): love when songs are about depression but they bop, that's my vibe, that's what I'm into

**whizzer0** (9): wow this really slaps

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (8.7): Again, another unusually excellent when he said ‚ÄúI might just fuck us over‚Äù like he dropped a campari, gin, and tonic-I felt that. excellent reverb on the cut even if we're maybe moving for a little too long. that drum machine got funk in it.

**camerinian** (8.5): actually this New Order tribute band made some points

**fadedblue09** (8.5): not sure whether the song is actually good or the fact that it follows 2 atrocious songs but w/e

**jman457** (8.5): I really liked this, catchy but not vanilla

**seanderlust** (8.2): well. i'm shaking my ass and crying.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/525740962727723009/1024290577887543346/FA3E7A27-BB58-4F54-B0CC-626568E87BAA.jpg

**homestarguy** (8): What Ned Fulmer said before having that affair.

**pig-serpent** (8): So I was wondering who the female vocalist on this is because it sounds kind of Tegan and Saray but also a little like the B-52s?  But apparently there isn't a female vocalist on this song, it's just the lead singer playing with pitch effects, so that's cool.

**reput4tionera** (8): oh this was a slay

**plastichaxan** (7.5): Why can‚Äôt I hate in peace

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.1): they could never be Amerie

#Oncelers

**flava** (7): this one starts of fairly strong but tapers off as the song goes on into something less memorable

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Relatable but I was listening to it and kinda forgot it was playing

**freav** (6.5): also a big grower for me

**nt96** (5): sorry but this is a bit meh for me

**Roxieloxie** (5): i changed my score for this one 3 times

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this is a foster the people song

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): ngl we just heard this in the listening party and I forgot how it sounded already

**freeofblasphemy** (4.5): Writing memorable songs?

**heysoupie** (4.3): really don‚Äôt like the 80‚Äôs synths paired with the annoying vocals

**Uberpigeon** (10): This song is so bright and glittery and fun and the biggest pop moment on the album.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): This was probably one of the last songs on the album to grow on me, I can appreciate it now more for the blissful, ‚Äúsweep you off your feet‚Äù-type beat that it is, but I think this is a totally fair placement for it.

---

#Feeling the same way

**TiltControls** (11): Me hoping for a joint 11 with someone

**apatel27** (10): The better SOPHIE track

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): In my feelings right now‚Ä¶

**celladonn** (10): This might actually be my fave on the album

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song is just so fucking cute like it just nails the magic of the stage before a relationship [when u just have a mutual crush with someone aaaaah.....](https://c.tenor.com/9B186mdFdcgAAAAC/crying-meme.gif)

**just\_thonking** (10): Me explaining why Lover is a bad album

**pig-serpent** (10): My favorite song on the album, the production is immaculately warm and the chorus is catchy and comfortable.  A warm and fuzzy love song.

**plastichaxan** (10): This song makes me feel like the main character I am sometimes I put it on the bus when I‚Äôm by the window seat to feel something

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): after the peanut bagel line I imagined this song in EEAAO and it might have fit quite nicely in a scene there. do people make amv‚Äôs but for live action

**akanewasright** (9.5): *that‚Äôs my girl we codependent, if she with it then I‚Äôm with it*

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): Me when I realize a bunch of other bozos are assigning numbers to songs

**imbaby122** (9.4): no actually it is just me because all my experiences are completely unique and no one understands me i‚Äôm so esoteric

**camerinian** (9): Sophie made some great points here

**homestarguy** (9): One of the two distinct highlights on the album. Delightful early-CHVRCHES-esque synth pop tune.

**reput4tionera** (9): once i heard this song playing in my campus bookstore

**slimboyfriend** (9): so do the bagels have like peanuts encrusted in them or are they plain bagels with peanut butter on them or are the bagels baked with artificial peanut flavoring or

**Stryxen** (9): amazing just not really my favourite, when i was first getting into this album i always considered it the worst ‚Äúme‚Äù song on here and i do love it now but still‚Ä¶ yeah

**vayyiqra** (9): Synth 80s whatever idc I like this

**welcome2thejam** (9): LEG revolutionizing the way we pronounce "hot" & "not"

**freav** (8.8): everytime i listen to this i then get "make them gold" by chvrches stuck in my head, a less good song than this but still pretty good

**moonagenightmares** (8.5): this brought me back to my tumblr days

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (8.5): do da major key 360 twirl! it's an incredible sound, amongst a wildly digital wooze that evokes the hellfire of logging on. did they choreograph dance routines for this? i hope they did.

**jman457** (8.2): RIP SOPHIE

**fadedblue09** (8): Oh I hear something

**freeofblasphemy** (8): I love that this is like halfway to coldwave

**impla77** (8): well crafted pop song

**starla\_** (8): a cute bop

**whizzer0** (8): It's impressive that a second collab between LEG and SOPHIE could be the most generic pop song in either's discography. Fortunately, it makes up for it by being pretty much a perfect pop song, and all the more heartwrenching now in the context of Two Ribbons.

**1998tweety** (7.5): boppy a bit

**a-man-with-a-perm** (7): it's kinda sweet but it's just fine as a song tbh

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i‚Äôm not like the other girls

**frogaranaman** (7): this sounds so much like another artist (positive) but I cannot pinpoint which one, it's driving me insane

#Peanut Bagels

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): me seeing roxie's average for LEG realising im not alone

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): it‚Äôs ok but i feel like they could‚Äôve done so much more with this

**sage** (6): its like cute

**heysoupie** (5.2): feels very of a specific (LMFAO-influenced) time to me

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): who the fuck eats a peanut bagel

**Roxieloxie** (4): i think i hate their voices

**runaway3212** (3): it's not good

**Uberpigeon** (10): It‚Äôs been so funny to see everyone hate every single song until this comes on and then be like ‚Äúwait‚Ä¶this is actually?? GOOD???‚Äù. This was always my favourite from the album and it‚Äôs been cool to see everyone appreciate it, not what I was expecting but it bops and I'm happy it got so far!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): I genuinely cannot believe that Superorganism made it to the Top 10 (barely), and I think it‚Äôs only by virtue of having a relatively normal song at the end of their album, that made people all the more generous with their scores. If only they‚Äôd had more of this on their album.

#masochism is COMING

**CrimsonROSET** (9): my time

**Awkward\_King** (8): My Time

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): my time

**imbaby122** (9.7): sky ferreria reference.

#Night Owls

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This the best closer in the rate and I‚Äôm so serious. Granted I gave two other closers 10‚Äôs but this is a stronger 10.

**bogo** (10): why couldn't the rest of this album be like this song? it's genuinely really good, it has actual good production, vocals, and lyrics and it's actually a bop! what the hell were they doing on the rest of the album?

**cremeebrulee** (10): the "wake up wake up" ad libs are cool i just wish this song had like . just a little more going for it

**flava** (10): not every album is smart enough to be this cyclical, ok but this has an insanely gorgeous groove and momentum that makes up for it being a bit repetitive

**pig-serpent** (10): Spectral and Exciting, this song sounds like adventure

**runaway3212** (10): best closer in this rate

**Stryxen** (10): LOVE IT. a victory lap of maybe the worst album i've ever heard

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this album is weirdly obsessed with Amouranth

**welcome2thejam** (10): Nine straight songs of us asking "can you guys please just be normal for once" and they finally said okay

**zukomu** (10): I‚Äôve soured on a lot of the album overtime but this song still rules imo


**homestarguy** (9.5): It‚Äôs giving 2012.

**1998tweety** (9): when i did this rate

**camerinian** (9): after an album full of assaults on the senses, it‚Äôs so good they did pull back and just gave us a hell of a jam to finish off. Always down for a breakbeat bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): this kinda gave Magdalena Bay their career

**indie\_fan\_** (9): I LOVE the production from this one and at least the closing track is the best song from here

**moonagenightmares** (9): the exact moment i started thinking the song was getting repetitive it switched up thats so neat

**nt96** (9): the night owl in me is shaking his ass

**impla77** (8.7): surprised I like a computer bad song this much

**jman457** (8.7): A catchy tune

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Ended on a decent note at least

**freav** (8.5): pretty good closer congrats

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): night owl anthem!!!

**akanewasright** (8): wtf this almost passes as a normal song

**destroyallhumans2** (8): honk shoo honk shoo

**just\_thonking** (8): That's my time!!!

**starla\_** (8): I'm a morning person but this song is good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): congratulations superorganism it only took you the entire album to do it but you finally made a song that‚Äôs actually pretty decent

**NFLfreak98** (7.7): god why was this a vibe? could it have sounded like this the whole time?

**plastichaxan** (7.3): Ah the two genders, Curious camgirls and cruel and kind cherry boys (I‚Äôm both) (Extra points for the wake ups in the background that was fun)

**a-man-with-a-perm** (7): maybe I like the aimless web surfing

**reput4tionera** (7): ok this wasn‚Äôt bad

**vayyiqra** (7): Very nice of them to end this by-now almost unbearable album with a song that I like for once, it has a good beat and catchy melody, although they were evil for having a sample of the exact same sound as my alarm clock. The jumpscare every time! At least this shit is over with now. I love when songs end with birdsong at least, that's a good bit though.

#In The Night Garden

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (6): night time can have a 6 for being bafflingly competent, as a treat. like this is still colossal cringe, and all the shit they do on the tiny desk only makes me wonder if this project is actually a Portlandia sketch come to life. tragically, its not. I desperately wish Superorganism had some kind of Andrew WK meta-ARG at play here, but they're not smart enough to do that.

**heysoupie** (5.8): fun but minus points for mouth noises (yawn) + alarm

**sage** (4.4): oh hell no

**freeofblasphemy** (1.5): Why would I want to hear an incessant alarm clock at the end of an art pop albm

**RandomHypnotica**: While it was never my favourite project in this rate, I always found this album to be a fun, quirky little experiment, that didn‚Äôt always hit the mark, but still showed promise and potential. I certainly didn‚Äôt expect some of the most intense hate I‚Äôve ever seen in rates, but it‚Äôs not *entirely* undeserved‚Ä¶ although they managed to still do remarkably well considering
**
Uberpigeon**: As much as I‚Äôve been making fun of this album and band‚Ä¶.. I do actually like this album. I think it's just crazy maximalist fun. They were doing the MOST they could, maybe too much, but it‚Äôs a really cool (ok‚Ä¶Maybe not cool) and unique album. Prawn.

**Stryxen** (9.250): black country new road

**altleftover** (8.550): 9 Weird sound soothes my brain

**apatel27** (8.450): As weird as the conception might have been this is a great album

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.300): I like annoying music

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.050): Nothing that could be said about this album is more accurate than u/awkward_king calling it the hyperpopified version of the Juno soundtrack. This band was simultaneously behind its time and ahead of it. They‚Äôre almost quirky enough to be the twee B-52s but they lack the energy for that

**pig-serpent** (8.000): An album that barely missed my top ten to 2018 and has held decent play since then.  When their quirky indiepop brand hits, they're doing it better than anyone else.

**nt96** (7.900): this is the heaviest *xd iM sO qUiRkY Ive ever heard.

**imbaby122** (7.860): regardless of any missteps this album took, i appreciate superorganism‚Äôs experimentation and playfulness. it kept me engaged throughout, and the album never had any snoozefest moments, which definitely deserves some credit. at the same time, some tracks feel a little messy, like ideas were just thrown at them without much editing. i loved the sticky but unconventional melodies of songs like everybody wants to be famous and something for your m.i.n.d. the sound bytes throughout were cheeky and fun. overall, superorganism creates a unique sound that feels distinctly them, which is only fitting for a self-titled album.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.800): say what you will say about this album but at least it kind of nails the psychedelic vibe it's going for (unlike mgmt)

**moonagenightmares** (7.780): i usually like this album but i go through weird phases where i cant stand it

**jman457** (7.710): A great little debut of cathcy songs. Also the song they did for the lego movie 2 slapped

**frogaranaman** (7.700): polycule music

**flava** (7.650): a challenging little glitchy project touching on disaffection in our modern era in an interesting but not really unique way. There personality, vision of pop and experimentation all seem to just integrate really well together though. Much better than

**TwoAmeobis** (7.260): This was really novel back in 2018. It's still fun now but I don't love it like I did back then

**starla\_** (7.150): Average 7.2. The first half of this album is chefs kiss. The back half drags a bit.

**freav** (7.020): this album is incredibly frustrating for me! it lies WAY too close to music i really really love such as the go! team, and as such i am inclined to mostly like it, but it's always slightly off, it feels like an idea of an album, like you have the cool sounds with no soul underneath to elevate them, idk i just want to listen to sukpatch

**jasannn** (6.950): this album is trying too hard to be quirky

**dream\_fighter2018** (6.900): this album has some really good highs but it gets a bit monotonous at point. A lot of the songs don‚Äôt compliment Orono‚Äôs voice either, some of these songs are going a bit too hogwild to suit her bored and detached delivery. They should‚Äôve gone neo psych or something.

**welcome2thejam** (6.800): Most of the the song opinions I had when scoring these tracks last year went the other way this time around. Some high highs, middling mids, and a few low lows

**whizzer0** (6.500): Another album that's been hyped but I've never gotten round to fully trying. Honestly, I didn't love it. Despite a strong first half, the second half felt somewhat whatever despite a lot of fun ideas and experimentation.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.450): yeah idk i don't really care for this album or the group in general

**zukomu** (6.400): I remember loving this album when it first came out and there are definitely still moments on it that sound fantastic but I just don‚Äôt love it the same way I used üòî

**plastichaxan** (6.280): It‚Äôs fine at best, the last few tracks really save this album, I wanted and tried to like it hence my average but wasn‚Äôt too successful hence my average

**fadedblue09** (6.050): Where do I start‚Ä¶.this album was certainly a trippy, bizarre experience. There are actually two songs that I enjoyed here, but the rest of the songs made me just go WTF for all sorts of reasons. I can at least give them credit for being memorable, which is more than what I can say for some artists here.

**TiltControls** (6.000): There are way too many songs where the start is good and then it just erupts into a mess of sound effects and noises. There are definitely a lot of parts where good stuff shines through. I just don't really love the stylstic choices personally

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.750): this album is the epitome of the ‚Äúnot me being goofy‚Äù meme

**cremeebrulee** (5.550): [teenager teenager i'm gonna grow up and be a teenager](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/872172420910444585/1017262223380455475/soop.png)

**NFLfreak98** (5.420): this album answers the question: what would it sound like if clairo hosted yo gabba gabba?

**just\_thonking** (5.300): Ranges from cute and catchy to downright awful

**sage** (5.080): this isnt nearly as bad as i thought it would be but its not like remarkable by any means its literally so same-y, also so many annoying choices were made in these songs that did nothing but make them worse

**akanewasright** (4.650): This sounds like someone heard an indie fan talk about how ‚Äú[insert artist] was great, they had ideas‚Äù and didn‚Äôt consider that they meant ideas that aren‚Äôt completely stupid and ugly

**vayyiqra** (4.100): Trying my best to be nice to this band and not quirkyphobic, still, I get the overwhelming feeling this album is just not very good? It's full of annoying moments, baffling (over)production choices, mediocre songwriting (especially the lyrics, which try to be #relatable to #millennials or something but really aren't) and overall a "too many cooks" feel that makes me think having 10 members or however many they have this week was not a wise move. The recurring thing that I think when I listen to this band is "yeah this would be okay at a college battle of the bands concert that costs $5, or on college radio that plays a lot of amateurish local indie, but for a proper band to have in a rate this is kind of embarrassing". You know, the kind of band you see because your friend is in it or something, but you don't really like them, you're just standing there at their show sipping your drink to be polite and show up to support them. I tried to like this! It had a few good songs, but overall this is at best mid and I see why so many raters found them extremely annoying. I might give them another try sometime but it doesn't bode well that their next album is I hear much worse.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.200): no exaggeration this might be the worst album i‚Äôve ever heard in my life

**freeofblasphemy** (3.100): A boring earache of an album

**indie\_fan\_** (3.050): I am very much Jade from Victorious right now in that one episode when those girls finish their karaoke session and she's like "Yeah! We're clapping because it's over!"

Uberpigeon: #Wane and Bogo's Power Hour

**bogo** (3.100): this honestly might be the most annoying, painful, infuriating album i have ever listened to this. this album is absolutely devoid of any new or interesting ideas, so to compensate for this the album is completely plastered with these excruciatingly irritating synths that are like fucking nails on a chalkboard, in addition to some of the most baffling production choices i have ever witnessed. but wait, there's even more to this shit sundae, because this album also has the most incredibly idiotic and LoL So RaNDoM XD millenial-core lyrics of literally any album. these lyrics are fucking shit. seriously, the fucking charly bliss record with a song about pissing yourself on a trampoline has better fucking lyrics than this trash. that's how much of a failure this album is. oh, not to mention, the vocals! there's actually two vocalists here: there's the main vocalist, orono, who sounds like she'd rather be doing anything but recording this mistake of an album, and there's also this spoken word guy that shows up from time to time who sounds like a side character on some 2010s nickelodeon show that got bad reviews and was canceled six episodes here. anyways the only tolerable track on here is the final track, which is actually quite great. everything else is a complete fucking waste of time and the band should be ashamed of themselves for making this shit.

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (2.790): In 2004, Lawrence Bell of Domino Records banked the entire fortune on Franz Ferdinand. Domino was not a Tier 1 indie and they were flopping hard. the internet was going to kill their label if they didn't get whip smart fast enough. I bring this up because FF killed it for Domino and then the label signed Arctic Monkeys and then were pretty much a Tier 1 indie within 2 years. When you get to that level, you have to keep pace. You will inadvertently enter bidding wars for artists that produce albums that sound like "the next big thing some teenagers want" in a time when 5-album contracts make no goddamn sense and streaming, playlist slotting, and the endless chase for "vibes" reign king. Superorganism's Superorganism is unfortunately all of that. It is also my first-entry ballot for *****"worst release on a tier 1 indie in the last 5 years"***** after about 3.5 CD car ride listens, several online chats, and glossing anything I could try to pin down with this group. I kept screaming at my CD player as this played, which I can only assume is "not a bug, but an earnest feature" of this asinine nonsense. And I do sorta get it, I likely heard some of this in my previous college life from housemates who listen to this kind of nonchalant, puppy dog brain pop. I also always rolled my eyes at this kind of stuff--like really it was there to pep you up at best but it can't do much more than that.(n) It is wild that a group of EIGHT people (THREE of which are gone and some of them had allegations in their own Australian scene long before they became this) who all sorta contributed in various capacities came together to create some of the most appallingly stupid, bleakly unfun uptempo pop music of the decade. How they make Low's Double Negative look happier (despite being 10x as bleak) is a legitimate colossal achievement. You straight up have to be so bad at your job to do that. The chief driving force of how such a thing could happen is the colossal levels of clutter. It seems like there was no proper leader or savant guru that was taking control and saying "cut back here". Just a guiding force to "be happy" and "write overblown synth n' hug it all out bullshit that makes Animal Collective look like they never took acid". I'd argue this is the case, because 2022 interviews have suggested all these 8 people had in common was: they liked weezer and thought Orono's delivery was good (it is earnest and honest. her lyrics are almost genius, she deserved better instrumentals. she seems VERY present and honest idk i like her work here). none of them had the na√Øvety or savant needed to track into a cohesive vision; they just rather keep building Frankenstein monster tracks of miserably bright puke over e-mail. (n) What is notable about it all, is that they do have an earnest "teenage" (calvin harris of K records definition) euphoria and energy here. it's easy to accidentally get swept up into it. It probably explains the staggeringly stupid amount of coverage this group got for their novelty factor: FACT mag spreads and Frank Ocean playlist inserts? where was this level of attention for Foodman, Fire-Toolz, or Machine Girl--artists that have legit forward thinking internet sounds? I digress. (n) Maybe though, Superorganism is forward thinking, or at least represents real glimpse into what future 2020s music trend will come if we don't fund regionally accessible art programs (rip art schools that gave us Roxy Music) or even provide grants like what LEG got. By that I mean I foresee privileged kids (aka those who live) in developed "above the brandt line" countries that can use the internet and laptop technology to connect online to make things they want. In theory, this sounds utilitarian af tbh--consider that the concurrent 2011 rnb rate is sorta doing this but with singular mavericks 7 years removed from this. Then you realize "these kids likely don't really know their pop history. they don't really crate dig. they just vibe, vape, n' tik tok". a world apart in knowledge and ethos. even as internet music nerdom is overtaking internet music gatekeepingdom, I do worry that long tail dynamics and online tribalism will create a possible loss of big brain pop knowledge and information seeking of out-of-comfort-zone soudns. Whether western, eastern, southern, or northern, this will happen with these types of groups. And in return, we'll be offered only the most shallow of rewards there. the lack of regionality in these sounds is   also of concern. To me, its not a matter of when another "Superorganism" comes: we're gonna get like another 15-28 albums like this by the end of the decade. I truly only hope they don't flop as bad as this.

**vayyiqra** (9): Very cool language, always liked the simplicity of its phonology and how unique it is, being in a family of its own (though it has lots of Chinese loanwords from centuries ago but they're almost unrecognizable by now). The way its grammar is nothing like English's is interesting though also a big challenge I find. It's also cool how they have a writing system that's three (or four counting romaji) different writing systems all at once; it sounds so chaotic but they make it work okay, even though it takes forever to learn. I have to give credit for that. A language I would like to learn a lot, but doubt I will ever master because of how unlike anything else it is, but still very cool. The only nitpick I have is that it's hard for it to borrow words from other languages that have a lot of consonant clusters, but that's not their fault.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): a top tier animal

**vayyiqra** (9): Frogs are pretty cool; they have many uses in biology as model organisms and not just for dissections. They're good for developmental biology because of the way their cell divide in a pattern that makes it easy to see the layers of tissue form as they grow into an embryo. Not as cool as a zebrafish, but still cool. Also I am a neuroscience guy and many discoveries about how conduction in nerves and neurons works were done with frogs. Scientific lore says that Luigi Galvani (the dude who did a lot of work with electricity, he's what "galvanized" is named after) first thought of this key concept behind how the nervous system works when he saw that frog legs would twitch when a thunderstorm was coming and the air was full of electricity. You've heard about Newton's apple (no it did not really land on his head btw, that's just a comedy bit) and Benjamin Franklin's kite, so where is the recognition for Galvani's frogs, huh? Also frogs are just inherently funny and make for a lot of good memes.

**1998tweety** (8): theyre cute

**whizzer0** (7): everyone else in my demographic seems to love frogs but they're overrated i'm sorry they're just not that exciting I feel like most of the appealing traits assigned to them are just manufactured and don't inherently have anything to do with frogs like you can just put googly eyes on a bucket hat or a chair it's okay it doesn't need to be frogs BUT that said I did spend some time yesterday rescuing a frog from malevolent felines so I guess I technically have a pet frog now which means I probably shouldn't be too harsh on them?? idk I feel way more conflicted about frogs than any song on this rate I think I just associate them with upsetting imagery from this one tv show and so I'm like idk idk about frogs but sure if you like frogs go for it

In the 90s we talked a lot about saving the whales and that was for a reason you know? Biologically I admit I don't find them that interesting in terms of their anatomy and stuff but they are quite majestic animals and I would definitely go whale watching if the opportunity came up. They're also very important to ocean ecology because when they die they sink to the sea floor where their bodies become food for a ton of organisms way down there in the benthic zone. Always kind of wanted to try whale meat after reading as a kid about Moby-Dick and books like that from the age of sail when hunting them was a common thing but conserving them is more important. Also how can you not be in awe of the size of the blue whale, the largest animal alive today, the absolute unit?

**Awkward\_King** (7): slayyyyy

**CrimsonROSET** (7): why do whales swallow so many things in pop culture is it about Jonah

**reput4tionera** (7): slay

#Whale whale whale... what do we have here

**whizzer0** (7): I have no strong feelings about whales

**fadedblue09** (3): insert Demi copypasta here

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): whales are smug

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this song is just so perfect in it‚Äôs delivery, it feels equal parts nostalgic and whimsical, and is a beautifully bittersweet moment, a lot of people mentioned how calming this is for them and I can totally understand that feeling.

**Uberpigeon** (10): A part of me thought this would be KKB‚Äôs highest song, but alas. A sweet and boppy number that can do no wrong!

---

#Me & Michael (Phelps)

**Awkward\_King** (11): this is the first song on my anxiety playlist and probably one of my favourite songs ever. i dont know precisely what it is, i think it might be the whole thing. the melody is so calming, the lyrics are hopeful and honest, i also love the little glitchy bits at the end they are a nice touch without being excessive or taking away from how relaxing the rest is. it feels like such a signature kkb song

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (11): i wish kkb would do something like this again - their best work hands down. there's just something so sweet and nostalgic about this song, and it has made me emotional so many times. words can't describe how much i love this song.

**akanewasright** (10): This was a friend of mine‚Äôs comfort song, and I feel like I stole it from them

**apatel27** (10): Just keep swimming

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This almost makes me want to go to the pool but then I remember all the poop and pee.

**camerinian** (10): lush

**homestarguy** (10): Shoutout to the word ‚Äúdetritus‚Äù and this beautiful chorus.

**plastichaxan** (10): I don‚Äôt know a more :floating: song and honestly that‚Äôs just one of my favorite feelings in thr world so

**reput4tionera** (10): me every monday and wednesday (im in club swim at my college)

**runaway3212** (10): I love swimming

**sage** (10): i get the feeling .... I ALLLLLWAYSSSSSSSS HAVEEEEE BEENNNNNN SWIMMINGGGGGGGGGGGG

**Stryxen** (10): this was gonna be my 11 for the longest time. One of my all time favs and i could not describe the things this song does to me and my heart

**vayyiqra** (10): Something dream pop shoegaze jangle pop. Whatever it is, idc what you call it, they perfected it on this one (1) song, whatever genre they were aiming for on this album. No one can deny they nailed that vibe here. I want a whole album of "Swimming"s and then I'd lose my mind over this album the way its evangelists do. Sadly this album doesn't give me that, but I do love this song.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Old vacation videos aesthetic

**imbaby122** (9.5): this song makes me believe i can survive without texting my mom every 5 minutes. which is a very dangerous idea to put in my head bc i definitely can‚Äôt.

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (9.3): omg sarah do NOT go swimming omg Sarah I own that photo of you! Oh wait it's this one. This is again, one of the other more memory-leaning/damaged tracks that always knocks me on my ass. this is capture tracks core but boy pablo'd and better.

**fadedblue09** (9): makes me emotional, idk why

**seanderlust** (9): sarah shouldn't go swimming so soon after EATING this hard

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): her florence and the machine slay

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.3): me when I lie and say I love the beach

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this does feel like drifting in water, it‚Äôs so slick and smooth

**freav** (8): well yeah its great

**nt96** (8): what I do when im in the pool

**heysoupie** (7.8): accidentally became the soundtrack to my mental montage of a day spent on a boat in the Mediterranean during a destination wedding a couple weeks ago #takemeback

**impla77** (7.8): really poignant lyrics, just very nice to listen to

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**starla\_** (7.5): this is nice

#Drowning

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6.5): can't relate, can't swim

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): I think this song is kinda boring but I like that she says ‚Äúdetritus‚Äù lol

**jman457** (5.9): it was a bit one note

**freeofblasphemy** (5): Feel like this would be so much better with a different vocalist

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I was underwhelmed by this when it came out and I kinda spilled

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): i cant swim

#Michael Angelakos

**bogo** (11): funnily enough it wasn't until [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7nRorYvy-Q) was posted in discord that i started considering this my 11 but after that i kept getting the chorus stuck in my head and kept thinking about those two cats and it made me happy so i had to go with this as my 11.

**frogaranaman** (11): hi Mike ily

**akanewasright** (10): *that‚Äôs my girl we codependent, if she with it then I‚Äôm with it*

**Awkward\_King** (10): getting a picture with my fave prophet

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I thought this was a cover for a long time because I thought the music video was a meta reference.

**celladonn** (10): it's the smasha

**cremeebrulee** (10): hypno and passion pit omg

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Me: your music saved my life. Them: https://youtu.be/jPx_ZWKYRCE

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): those darn cats‚Ä¶ little rascals‚Ä¶ sweetheart, babies

**heysoupie** (10): as someone who carried a(mostly unrequited) torch for a m*n named Michael for YEARS, I feel a little weird about this song. But it's so good. :\

**homestarguy** (10): me and me???? (‚óï‚Äø‚óï) (I‚Äôm Michael)

**jasannn** (10): I know it‚Äôs gay but this is what I imagine having a bestfriend is like

**just\_thonking** (10): They were just really good friends who lived together in the same house and never got married

**moonagenightmares** (10): i love how this was originally ‚Äúme and my girl‚Äù but then they were like everything sounds better gay so they just made it gay. they were so right for that

**Stryxen** (10): they have no idea what horror they unleashed upon the world when they released this (me feeling rlly gay)

**welcome2thejam** (10): Everyone deserves the kind of happiness I feel when that cat goes w√∂√¶o

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): i‚Äôm being queerbaited so hard rn

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (9.5): End of every blog radio on Sirius xmu on demand in 2018 ended with the start of that DUN DUN. God I love this one, solid as it comes.

**flava** (9): they seem like great friends

**imbaby122** (9): friends? lovers? siblings?

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.7): I love Passion Pit erotica

**apatel27** (8.5): How many comments are going to say gay

**camerinian** (8.5): this sounds like the end credits theme to a buddy cop movie but the twist is that Michael is actually a snarky talking dog and they refuse to get along and bicker on the job until Michael gets his paw grazed by a bullet and then while he's in the hospital they learn what brought them both to the force and they end up super determined to take down the illegal gambling ring or something cos it's a family film and they can't be like human trafficking or anything super dark

**starla\_** (8.5): is this homosexuality?

**a-man-with-a-perm** (8): solid as they come

**destroyallhumans2** (8): music video is peak

**nt96** (8): is this a gay fanfic

**runaway3212** (8): gay people!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): gay gay homosexual gay

**vayyiqra** (8): Can't wait for a raft of "who tf is Michael" comments (I'm in the "who tf is Michael" camp myself, I know it's a random name, but still don't get what this song is trying to say. What is his relation to the narrator? And more importantly, no one ever asks "how is Michael" :pensive:). Anyway good song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Really picks up after the first chorus but not a huge fan of the verses

**freav** (7.3): need this so bad

**reput4tionera** (7): this was fun

**seanderlust** (7): e bugs

**slimboyfriend** (7): Jackson? Tyson? Jordan?

**thedoctordances1940** (6.1): it's fine but it was slightly ruined for me by somebody in front of me screaming the chorus very loudly when i saw them in concert and that's all you hear in my video recording of it

**CrimsonROSET** (6): and they were roommates

#Michael Bubl√©

**impla77** (6): doesn‚Äôt really stand out

**freeofblasphemy** (5.5): Keep wanting this to be a banger but alas

**plastichaxan** (5): Sorry gay people this is so boring

**pig-serpent** (4): I do like this prettier style of synthwave overall, but every band that was actually around in the 80s wrote this exact song but much better.

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): maybe the 80s revival was a mistak

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I‚Äôm glad to see this made it as high as it did, the moment those 3 synth chords come in you know you‚Äôre about to go on a RIDE, and this track doesn‚Äôt let go. I love all the little flourishes throughout the track, the lyrics feel so abstract yet specific, and it‚Äôs just an absolutely fantastic synthpop song.

**Uberpigeon** (10): I‚Äôm glad this song got its dues because it goes HARD. It‚Äôs like driving under neon lights at night wearing sunglasses and then crashing your car and snapping your neck in a really cunty way and ascending to heaven in a sax solo

#[Platform](https://gfycat.com/earnestvioletcrustacean)

**amr** (11): I have so many words for this song and entire album in fact but whenever I try to get them out I feel like crying...sorry!!

**cremeebrulee** (11): i was going to 11 LDA, but this song legit gets my heart racing like... it makes me feel like i‚Äôm in falling in love but also simultaneously in a high speed car chase or something idk!!! i've only heard it for the first time a few months ago but i would already die for it

**impla77** (11): vibes are immaculate

**just\_thonking** (11): God this song makes me go feral. It starts at a 10 and only gets better

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (11): Saintly 11 dispatched to the nearly six minute queer co-dependency bop that's really about loving one's self (but also def your friend). Not a second is wasted in the lyrical observations nor the ethereal bleeding heart brooding of this one, which wisely limits its anthemic nature to stay vulnerable and personable. When the chorus comes up, it is bloody brilliant, the kind of electro banger that sorta feels like it was dreamed up watching a bunch of Steven Universe and shipping some Gems, AND then sonically imagined to include a cowbell-type percussion, bussing bass, and a "strong salad" worthy flow; its oozing for a kiss! It confidentially swoons, damnit! Then that last 100ish seconds of ooos and "NO HESITATION AT THE TRAFFIC LIGHT" thumps its way to the tear ducts.  I'd sample parts of I'm All Ears to it on trains up to school and was always aghast at the majesty and construction of this one. It's been three and half years since and I can assuredly say this helped push a coherent baseline and framework for pop music I enjoy.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This immaculate, atmospheric pussy popper‚Ä¶

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): When these two little British pixies tell me ‚Äúu got this‚Äù it‚Äôs weirdly motivational

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): i am so fallen rn...

**imbaby122** (10): i actually felt my body levitate off the ground woah

**jman457** (10): This was immaculately produced, felt like going on a journey

**runaway3212** (10): I love them when they're barely singing

**Stryxen** (10): something I hate about this song is "when I climb the steps to the street" because I live really high up and don't have any metro in my city so I can never do this and thus can never really feel the song. And I really wanna feel that lyric cos she delivers it with so much conviction but it really is just saying she's walking on to the street. I could relate to that, I've been on streets before‚Ä¶ but it's not the same .. i want to climb UP to the street. Cos otherwise this song could be about me. Anyway. God that chorus is insane the synth line is simply gorgeous AND danceable. Ughhhhh the bridge‚Ä¶ I think they caught it on camera‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. One of my all time favs but it is always below donnie darko unfortunately. Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): "you got this" *proceeds to slay*

**vayyiqra** (10): "I cross the gap between the platform and train" Nobody knows what this song's lyrics mean, but it's evocative.

**welcome2thejam** (10): "We got this" might be the best singular moment of the rate

**whizzer0** (10): let's be real it's a 1000 and arguably the greatest song of all time

**freav** (9.5): this is quality stuff! i love their voices so much too

**plastichaxan** (9.5): Kinda need to go on dates specifically to relate to this song unless I‚Äôm misinterpreting it in which case I‚Äôm just dumb and just want to go on dates haha<3

**thedoctordances1940** (9.3): this song is already great and then the final two minutes are just incredible

**NFLfreak98** (9.2): just sounds so so nice

**bogo** (9): love the twinkly, sparkly synth sounds here they're pretty

**freeofblasphemy** (9): This is just so wonderful

**akanewasright** (8): the quasi-housey production is doing a lot of legwork here‚Ä¶ but man those legs could choke me

**CrimsonROSET** (8): let‚Äôs ride

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): yeah the ending is pretty cool but it really didnt need 4 whole minutes of buildup just to get to that (EDIT: ok nvm i relistened to it maybe the buildup slayed after all)

**reput4tionera** (7.5): i don‚Äôt rly have thoughts on this song so im gonna tell y‚Äôall about a candle i got from target. it was $12 for a THREE WICK CANDLE. it‚Äôs cinnamon beignet scented and its fucking amazing but they have a bunch of other fall scents and most of them are rly good it was so hard to choose one

**a-man-with-a-perm** (7): I want to like this song so much, to be enthiastic about it as much as others but it never meets that ethereal mark for me

**homestarguy** (6.5): I enjoy the sound of this one, but the songwriting just doesn‚Äôt grab me.

**starla\_** (6): this is fun

#[Train](https://gfycat.com/untimelyfairicelandicsheepdog)
**flava** (5.6): im so sorry uberpigeon, I gave this so many plays to try and hear what you hear, love your league plays but I don't love this song. There isn't really anything bad about it, it is a fine listening experience. Just nothing comes together or sticks out. Even the saxophone sounds flat

**heysoupie** (5.6): I really don‚Äôt find anything memorable about this song. It feels formulaic.

**Awkward\_King** (4): fun fact i saw this song live with benji 3 years ago! we were not together however

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I feel like this would be better if it weren‚Äôt indie? Like if they just upped the tempo and had the singer get on support and not do the bananas/avocados voice then it would be a bop. There‚Äôs potential here because some of the production and melodies are really pretty but they‚Äôre tragically misapplied.

**fadedblue09** (1.5): Very annoying vocals and instrumentals

**Roxieloxie** (1): they sound like theyre trying to do an impression of halsey in the mall in every single song

whizzer0: > Nobody knows what this song's lyrics mean, but it's evocative.

it's about opening yourself up and being vulnerable no matter the risk and later songs on the album deal with the consequences of this decision, crossing the gap means stepping out of the liminal space of uncertainty and falling for a concrete plan

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Unfortunately, this song never really stood a chance. Some early ballots proved that the song was going to be to divisive to be a rate winner, and while it had an impressive climb back up (check the rank graph for this one), it never quite made it to the top. But what a DESERVING winner this would have been, SOPHIE really pulled out all the stops for that chorus here, it feels so incredibly cathartic, mixed with the undeniably british ‚ÄúHAAAWT PIIIINK‚Äù, this whole song is just serving cunt.

**Uberpigeon** (10): Oh‚Ä¶ Oh‚Ä¶. Oh wait a minute?? I love this song but for a long time it was not even cracking the top 10 and I think that would have been really shocking and gagworthy. Oh well, it DOES deserve to slay after all.

I was playing this album (and Two Ribbons) on my radio show last Friday and talking about how cool it was they got Sophie on this track and how the lyrics are about gender roles and stuff and this song is a banger. One time I played this for my friend and she was like "ahhh wtf is this" but also liked it. That's the vibe.

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (10): An incredible snapshot of a time n' place--like they just come out the gate en media res and immediately warp themselves into a whole new form. I want to say this was in XMU rotation through july 2018. It may have been the closiest SOPHIE was ever broadcast outside Blog Radio hosts.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Alright really listening to this again for the first time since finally hearing SOPHIE in TWOE rate and once those electronic elements came in I jumped cause "wait a second I recognize that production!"

**zukomu** (10): This is my first time listening to this band but oh lord I love this, this fucks so hard

**apatel27** (9.9): It's a good track but vastly overrated by the pots and pans crew

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i adore this song but also hate certain lyrics

**impla77** (9.3): Production is amazing, but that is kinda given

**jasannn** (9): I immediately recognized the SOPHIE imprint even as a casual fan of SOPHIE

**whizzer0** (9): This was the first song of theirs I heard, originally on Lorde's "Homemade Dynamite" playlist. I actually didn't love it and it put me off SOPHIE for a while. But you know what, I've come around on it; it just needs the right mood. Also, the music video is great.

**a-man-with-a-perm** (8.9): it's a 9 but all the momentum of this banger slightly skids off the track when the synths come in at the end and they both repeat hawt pink with the delivery of a local band

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): the production is giving Sophie but the vocals are giving ‚Äúwelcome to my kitchen‚Äù. I feel like this is one of the songs that will grow on me so I‚Äôm giving it an 8 just in case it does.

**freeofblasphemy** (8): I love how this doesn‚Äôt use ‚Äòweirdness‚Äù as a means to an end

**cremeebrulee** (7.2): i don't dislike it but i don't fully love it either idk... i know this is like Thee LEG Entry Point ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, but i've heard it like twenty times at various rate reveals over the last two years and it has never encouraged me to check out any of their other work. the production isn‚Äôt anything i couldn‚Äôt get out of SOPHIE‚Äôs solo work and the lyrics are too esoteric personally but i‚Äôve sort of accepted that this will be their best performing song

**runaway3212** (7): so true do main pop rap girls yass

**1998tweety** (6.5): doja ended ha

**heysoupie** (6): HaWAT pANK love the SOPHIEness of it all but the affected pronunciation‚Ä¶the vocals‚Ä¶just‚Ä¶don‚Äôt work for me.

#7 in the stink

**homestarguy** (3): ‚ÄúHot Pink?‚Äù More like ‚ÄúSong Stinks.‚Äù

**TiltControls** (3): She's stellar but I don't know if Sophie's production works here for me.

**flava** (2): there are two parts to this song, one that is fairly conventional synthpop and the other that wants to reach out and touch hyperpop styles and flavour. All while being quintessentially British. On there own i might like either. Put them together and you get a song i find highly irritating and frustrating. The transition is extremely jarring. And the pots and pans style production just doesn't fit for me. Where every twist and contortion just makes me dislike the song even more before returning to the synthpop side that's become less flavourless. Definition of worse than the sum of its parts, and those parts weren't too good to begin with

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Imagine my disappointment when the killer instrumental intro track ended and I heard this singer‚Äôs voice and realized what I was in for with the rest of this album. I‚Äôd give them credit for the message of the song, which is something I really relate to, but honestly I read the lyrics and I don‚Äôt think that they convey anything at all? Big disappointment and missed opportunity. It‚Äôs saved by the candy-like synths on the chorus but wow I do not miss this era of abrasive SOPHIE production.

**indie\_fan\_** (1.5): First 45 seconds was nice and it just went down for me after that

#I don't know what to say to you

**frogaranaman** (0): this just sounds derivative sorry y'all

**Roxieloxie** (0): i fucking hate this so much oh my god i havent felt pure rage for a 0 in such a long time, the longer this goes on the more murderous i become

Uberpigeon: #you made me reach the character limit

**CrimsonROSET** (11): originally i was just gonna say ‚Äòhot pink‚Äô and let the song speak for itself but then i realized i could just use this as my only acting comment pt. 2 because likely they‚Äôre gonna end up next to each other in the rate and hopefully this one is further SO let‚Äôs talk about noise and relief! idk the technical terms for this but i‚Äôm putting ‚Äònoise‚Äô as tension and ‚Äòrelief‚Äô as lack of it, for example in this song the ‚Äònoise = tension‚Äô comes from the hard drums, the crashing noise of glass and the weird siren in the back, they come in for the chorus that is very simple and so you can still make apart what they‚Äôre saying as more elements come in. more than that, it resolves back into smoothness, but that doesn‚Äôt mean hints of it aren‚Äôt still there. the percussion is still a good point, and the hihat contrasts the glass shattering. more than that, the next chorus switches things up with instead a baseboosted bass and a change of verse, it‚Äôs not the same noise even if the motif of the broken glass is still there and for the third chorus once more it changes, but there is always a moment of relief (even when it goes from the second chorus straight into the third, the ‚Äòbridge‚Äô section serves as the relief that will draw us out to the end of the song). If you look at Only Acting, it similarly follows noise and tension rules for the first segment BUT after the first part of ‚Äòrelief‚Äô it‚Äôs all tension until the end in varying levels- almost anxiety driven, you just want it to end and things keep coming out of nowhere and screaming in your ear that were never there before, it isn‚Äôt building or equaling out, it‚Äôs just noise. Relief only comes on the next song (which i really like) but as a stand alone, it ends in tension, in anxiety, while this one ends also building to the next song BUT with that tension fully resolved and ready to move on. It‚Äôs like if a rollercoaster where it goes up and down, but there‚Äôs always an ending period to calm your heartbeat, while Only Acting launches you to the moon and says ‚Äòwell gravity (another song) exists to bring you down so we don‚Äôt got to do it‚Äô anyways the point is I like Hot Pink.

**Uberpigeon** (11): This had a strong lead at the start but ultimately didn‚Äôt make the cut. What a tragedy! This is for sure THE fan favourite LEG song and a transcendent experience. Go see the girls live and this song pops OFF I will tell you. I'm glad it at least was their top song!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Unfortunately this is the end of the road for LEG, but it‚Äôs still an impressive feat for a relatively niche act to get an 11 minute song to the Top 4 of a rate with 2 other popheads faves (and superorganism i guess). When I first heard this song, I was a bit hesitant for the length, and I was admittedly a little underwhelmed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?‚Äù, I thought as the song was ending. But then I listened again and I was eagerly anticipating each section as it came. And then I listened again, and again, and again because I *got* it. The build is absolutely fantastic, and every second of guitar noodling, synth pedalling and chord changes is completely essential, there‚Äôs such a driving force behind the track that makes it feel like a whole journey, it‚Äôs an almost trascendental religious experience listening to this song, and I‚Äôm glad that it got as much love as it did.

#length-appropriate comments 

**Stryxen** (11): saved writing my comment for this song to the very last so i could use all my leftover writing energy on this. and i have nothing, i have exhausted myself talking about the dozens of songs i would potentially call my favourite song ever across these albums and yet here I am with my absolute favourite, that easily shines among all these masterpieces, and i don‚Äôt know what to say. It‚Äôs just insane. Lemme try. The entire 11 minutes is the climax of the album, while this song has its own peaks and valleys, it is the peak of the album in intensity, incorporating all the lyrical concepts and instruments used throughout melted into one slow burn epic. The build ups and the concept and the raw emotion and catharsis, amazing, really feels like the end of a whole era. My favourite part of this rate by far has to be ‚Äúbut I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ and I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù it resonates with my soul, like accepting the end has arrived, like accepting you‚Äôve failed and have disappointed others. but not yourself. I don‚Äôt know what this song is about other than just being about donnie darko? but i have loved this song since i first heard it and can find every emotion in it and i‚Äôm still finding new attachments to it, they were on fire in this era. DONNIE DARKO‚ÄôS AT MY WINDSCREEN SCREAMING STAWP THE CAURRRRR STAWP THE CAURRR PLEASE. But I can‚Äôt. And I can‚Äôt. Cause the beating‚Äôs just get older and we‚Äôll never grow them out cause the hand that does the dealings is the one that feeds your mouth. Oh my god

**vayyiqra** (11): "George Walton 4 years ago First off, it‚Äôs weird. Second listen, it‚Äôs got me totally hooked. It‚Äôs a really nice way to spend 11 minutes" So true, shoutout to this guy, dude rocks. I think Popheads talking about this song is part of what made me want to listen to this album. Donnie Darko is an old favourite movie of mine that I loved when I was literally "I'm 14 and this is deep" phase, and it's held up fairly well - it's confusing at first but it's got some interesting things to say about fate and predestination, mental illness, religion, all my favourite stuff. It's got cool aesthetics, it's not quite horror but it's a fall and Halloween movie, it's got a lot of clever quips, it fits the Let's Eat Grandma vibe perfectly. I love very long songs that use their time well and it's "earned" or whatever and that are repetitive in a way that's enjoyable. The rhythmic and catchy feel of this song is so hypnotic and engrossing, I love this. "Let's eat" they say? Yes, they ate on this indeed.

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (10): once on a train ride up to school I had to sit with people and we all traded what our major was and they asked if I had seen donnie darko. no i don't like bro cinema. end of that story. Anyways, LEG didn't have to do this; like no one said "okay the teens got their grant money to make a 12 minute cut". This is a song that goes nowhere. It practically stays in the bedroom in a diary. Yet from there we go everywhere. Donnie Darko encapsulates the bleeding heart MO of I'm All Ears far better than it intended. Pretty much any sound the duo had touched shows up here, spread out through a multilayered, just bleakly honest heart-to-heart about self-worth and mental demons. Everything shines, even if the disco floor feels damn near empty when the four on the floor comes in and we have a brutal monologue of cathartic, pained imagery. It has to survive though, I suppose it holds on tight because we do as well.

**freav** (10): god the way the song just explodes in the "DONNY DARKO'S AT MY WINDSCREEN" part

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): a moment‚Ä¶ rosa and jenny were truly in their bag when they wrote this. the moment the instrumental ascended‚Ä¶ oh my.

**seanderlust** (10): of the long songs on this album this is my favorite by a mile

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): Donnie Darko is at my windscreen, screaming ‚ÄúStop the count, stop the count‚Äù because if you‚Äôre reading this, this song was just probably robbed


**welcome2thejam** (10): A spiritual experience

**whizzer0** (10): No but really it's a 10,000 also this was insane live

**TiltControls** (9): it's long but maybe it can impossible soul its way to the top

**a-man-with-a-perm** (8.5): It could honestly go for another ten minutes and I wouldn't be bored of it...noine noine noine...auld langs soine

**moonagenightmares** (7.5): you will never be impossible soul

**frogaranaman** (7): this song is Benji in audio form

**imbaby122** (7): i don‚Äôt think any song is meant to be eleven minutes long. bitch i‚Äôm from the streaming era and i have 5 daily hours on tiktok you know my attention span isn‚Äôt that long!!!!! update: mega synths were added to the mix im not bitter anymore. still too long tho. i shouldn‚Äôt be able to live react in my comments.

**pig-serpent** (6.5): The slower part of this song doesn't do much for me and the build up is far less satisfying than Cool & Collected's.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I could have watched an episode of Spongebob in the time it took me to score this‚Ä¶ two actually since I listened to it twice to be fair. There were several points where they could have ended but they kept going and the impact was the same. It was pretty though.

**heysoupie** (5.9): forgettable except for the vocals are slightly less grating than in other songs

**starla\_** (5.5): the chord progression on this kind of annoys me but it's not a bad song

**fadedblue09** (5): Idk how to rate this‚Ä¶.on one hand, it has some of the album's highlights but at the same time also has elements that represent what I disliked about this album.

**impla77** (4.8): bit long for me and I haven‚Äôt watched Donnie Darko

**homestarguy** (0): I ain‚Äôt listening to all that, I‚Äôm happy for u tho, or sorry that happened

**Hulnia** (0): see i love long songs if they can keep it interesting but this just can‚Äôt with this. it‚Äôs just kinda an empty boring mess tbh

RandomHypnotica: I absolutely love what Rosa and Jenny have captured here, this album is truly such an experience from start to finish, it feels like one long lucid teenage fever dream, flashing through glimpses of every emotion imaginable, and capturing such a unique atmosphere so perfectly.

Uberpigeon: This is my favourite album in the rate and I‚Äôm salty that it didn‚Äôt sweep the whole top 10. These girls just GET it. The moody teen quirky girl angst vibes are IMMACULATE and that‚Äôs just what you need sometimes. I was rooting hard for my Norwich girls and they did well‚Ä¶ but suffered quite a few robberies. Hurts my heart to see them miss the top 3!

**plastichaxan** (9.982): Life changing album in a different way, this album really just gives me a new song to obsess over every single time and now it‚Äôs all slays

**just\_thonking** (9.409): Over this past year this album has gradually risen to be one of my favorite albums (and highest album averages) of all time. It's just banger after banger. Every song blossoms in such a satisfying way and I love their delivery and the layered instrumentals and the lyrics and the melodies and the album cover and yes even the interludes!!! Also Let's Eat Grandma is a goated artist name

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (9.291): 2018 will go down as the best year Transgressive Records will ever have as a record label. They put out SOPHIE & then were gifted this absolutely bizarre dance and proggy pop wonder of co-dependent, vaguely homoerotic bops, that was made by two otherworldly talented teenagers. The duo simply were just overflowing with a litany of ideas, house/indie gtr oriented/PC adjacent pop that was lusher than lush. It never felt too decadent or indulgent, but just rawly earnest and of themselves. there's a sense that these two women were made for each other and only to work with each other and use their music to find a better, more confident version of themselves in the process. this album simply cannot be recreated, no one should try to do recreate that B-side. it's too good. Still, it feels like a gargantuan, going-to-be-memory holed anomaly. Such is a rarity in pop of outlier albums that capture the end of two femme's second decade and the new pains and quirks that arise from their observations. we could use 15-28 more of these kinds of albums.

**Stryxen** (9.091): i‚Äôm all tens

**apatel27** (9.036): A grower to say the least. Lots of people know Hot Pink but the rest of the album is so good especially the middle stretch

**vayyiqra** (8.909): My favourite album in this rate, one that got a lot of hype in 2018 and won me over. I really like this band and how they're such good friends, and respect how young they were when they made this. To a great extent I like this because it happens to fit my specific tastes ("synthpop but kind of artsy" is my favourite genre) but also I think it's quite an impressive achievement for only the second album made by a couple of teenagers. Songwriting is wise beyond their years! Also loving the very long tracks on this, I love when pop songs aren't afraid to stretch out and take their time as long as it's done well. Overall this is my favourite album by them although all of their albums are worth checking out if you like this.

**whizzer0** (8.818): Disclaimer that this is the only album on here I've heard in its entirety before and it's also one of my absolute favourite albums of all time so it probably has a bit of an advantage. Um, but it deserves it. It's one of the greatest albums of all time and manages to capture late-teen emotions dialled up to one hundred. You don't just listen to this album; you live it.

**bogo** (8.773): i've never really heard let's eat grandma before this rate so this album was a very pleasant surprise. the songs on here are all slow burns but they build and build to these huge satisfying climaxes. the lyrics to this are also super heartfelt and hard-hitting. lots of good ideas, which we love

**freeofblasphemy** (8.682): Had heard this a couple times way back when but didn‚Äôt really take the time to properly appreciate it. However, my love for the new one made me eager to revisit it, and it‚Äôs phenomenal. Ambitious and emotionally resonant in a way modern dream pop rarely tries to be

**freav** (8.664): probably the best record of the bunch, just very high quality pop music, insanely consistent too, i could see it growing on me even more as i get more familiar with it

**jman457** (8.609): Tbh before this I have only heard the Sophie songs, but this whole album is great

**thedoctordances1940** (8.609): honestly such an underrated album, consistently great, two incredible songs and like no real lows outside the interludes

**nt96** (8.591): Of the four albums, this one was the most surprising. There were some moments that were okayish here and there but the highs of the album really manage to keep it together. A nice mix of synth pop and experimental glossy sounds.

**cremeebrulee** (8.482): i'm actually PISSED i haven't listened to this fully until this year because this album is actually incredible‚ÅâÔ∏è i've never really seen other songs depict platonic & romantic relationships the way rosa & jenny do here (and on two ribbons)‚Äî it's so artful & accurate and just hits right were it supposed to. plus this album just *sounds* amazing throughout. i was not prepared to become a grandmahead but it seems like i must...

**akanewasright** (7.909): just a couple of codependent besties, what‚Äôs not to love?

**welcome2thejam** (7.818): Everything except the interludes ranges from very good to absolutely incredible, and at least a cat was involved once in the meh stuff

**pig-serpent** (7.773): I liked this album a lot when it came out but pretty quickly everything but HAWT PINK and It's Not Just Me fell out of my rotation, and I'm happy I had a reason to come back to it because those aren't the only two good songs on here.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.727): me trying to take in this album as much as possible *morphs into a creature covered with ears*

**imbaby122** (7.682): i was familiar with let‚Äôs eat grandma going into this rate, having listened to their 2022 lp. i love their characteristic synthpop style, and i was anticipating that going in, especially after hearing whitewater. but god am i glad that wasn‚Äôt the case. being a pophead, i‚Äôm obviously thrilled with the sophie production on hot pink, which is my favorite track on the album and of the rate. though most of the album sticks to synthpop, i appreciated the dabbles into hyperpop, ambient, and stripped-down music. which is not to say every track landed with me. some felt dull. some were wayyyyy too long. but overall, the top notch production, vocal performance (although i can see why some people might hate it), and variation make for a great project.

**starla\_** (7.409): Average 7.4 I like Two Ribbons more but this is a really good album as well.

**TwoAmeobis** (7.155): Love the ambition of this album

**sage** (7.009): i was expecting to not like this at all based on the few songs i heard before (other than hot pink) but its actually pretty decent w a few great songs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.636): please ignore my average for this album this is very easily a 7.5 and the two terrible interludes are dragging it down

**NFLfreak98** (6.582): very very cool album, even if some of the shots they take end up missing me personally

**TiltControls** (6.318): My average would be so much higher without the interludes

**flava** (6.100): an album of highs, lows and mids. Didnt hate it but there were enough clunkers to make me not come back to it. Also those interludes were sure something

**moonagenightmares** (5.736): the interludes and length of some songs weigh this down

**fadedblue09** (5.273): I'm so sorry but these women have the most grating vocals I've heard in a while??? The surprisingly mellow direction of the album just magnified this issue for me, which is disappointing because the album actually has a couple decent bangers in the front half. Also shady as it may sound, my favorite tracks here are the ones where they do not sing at all.

**frogaranaman** (4.545): the way LEG makes some mind bendingly good music and some of the most boring shit I've heard in ages

**RandomHypnotica** (10): And so, the villain of the rate is finally out in a very respectable 3rd place (the highest it‚Äôs gotten in a rate‚Ä¶ so far). Considering the comments on the lowest scores, I think this would‚Äôve potentially won the rate if it wasn‚Äôt for the indieheads exchange‚Ä¶ and *this* song already being rated twice before this, because it‚Äôs exactly what the core of this rate is all about, dark synths and depressing lyrics that make you MOVE

**Uberpigeon** (10): I really thought everyone would be sick of this song appearing in rates but apparently not. Congratulations mgmt for making the top 3 but you will not be beating the bonitos!

---

#Third time's the charm?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPbVRpRgHso&t=37s

**moonagenightmares** (11): ‚Äúi grieve in stereo, the stereo sound strange‚Äù is one of the best lyrics of all time fr

**NFLfreak98** (11): i could bop til the day i die

**apatel27** (10): Insert whole chorus in caps here

**bogo** (10): eternal halloween banger right here

**celladonn** (10): perfect song honestly

**cremeebrulee** (10): why don't we ever use the phrase pop perfection for this!!! this song HITS like a good horror movie‚Äî its got the perfect amount of sinistry and memorability and i would‚Äôve 11'd this if i didn't currently have worms for brains

**CrimsonROSET** (10): now it‚Äôs time for a breakdown *grieves in stereo*

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): truly heartbreaking how amazing this song is

**destroyallhumans2** (10): mmm yes gothic perfection, not even mad tiktok got to it

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): knee slapper. That bridge is legendary. Songs about cancel culture usually suck and are annoyingly over the top but I think this is artistic in the way that it presents the issue not as one of wokeness but of human hysteria and the desire to find a common enemy on both sides. Plus it actually tries to paint a picture which puts it above so many other songs that are critical of society. Good job, MGMT

**flava** (10): might have underrated this one in AS5 a tiny bit. Or maybe the way it fits within the album makes it stand out so much more. But this just bops so much harder than I remember it bopping back in February. Its tight hooks and sharp lyrics just resonate with me more now. The nervous energy that infiltrates the listener as it seems the world is falling apart.

**frogaranaman** (10): do the Tiktok rate

**homestarguy** (10): Screw the unneeded hate, this is a modern classic and all of you haters are on the wrong side of history with your blatant lies.

**jman457** (10): sorry MGMT anti‚Äôs this is an immaculate pop song

**just\_thonking** (10): The non-LEG 11

**reput4tionera** (10): i am not a mgmt stan but i can gatekeep this song bc i was obsessed w it when it came out. fuck u tiktok

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I feel like it's been long enough since All Stars that I can openly stan this song again. It has a perfectly bouncy yet ominous vibe and resonant lyrics

**seanderlust** (10): god I love the ambiguity of the lyrics

**Stryxen** (10): playlist of this album into Renaissance . When is someone releasing an age of Enlightenment album

**thedoctordances1940** (10): it's just amazing brilliant i love it

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): Miku outsold MGMT on their own song

**vayyiqra** (10): this is goth

**welcome2thejam** (10): Apologies in advance when this gets sent to All Stars again

**imbaby122** (9.8): tiktok is sucking every last drop of blood out of this song. beating a dead horse. wringing it dry. too bad it‚Äôs still good!!!

**indie\_fan\_** (9.8): Runs a tad too long, but beautiful track nonetheless

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (9.2): chillwave goes brr and we get a stupid as fuck but stupid fucking good pep talk bop

**1998tweety** (9): tiktok music

**a-man-with-a-perm** (9): going away and coming back with silly little goth haircuts, god bless those boys

**akanewasright** (9): The MELTDOWNS if this wins‚Ä¶ or misses day 3‚Ä¶ those would be iconic

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): so 90s-core of them

**starla\_** (9): chiptune vibes

**freav** (8.5): used to think this song was lame but turns out i was the lame one

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): one of the biggest earworms in the rate

**whizzer0** (8): oh it's not a sax album but this is a cool song anyway

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i dont have tiktok

**heysoupie** (7.4): didn‚Äôt realize this was MGMT the first million times i heard the clip on TikTok

**pig-serpent** (7): The pointer in my mind called "Little Dark Age" is pointing a memory address that stores "Instant Crush" by Daft Punk...  Anyway, the cicadiay synths in the first verse sound cool but they mostly fade into generic synthwave by the end.

**slimboyfriend** (7): slow it down and reverb it

**camerinian** (6.5): maybe if we rate this another six times i‚Äôll finally decide how I actually feel about this song

**impla77** (6.5): have heard the chorus from Tik tok and honestly that‚Äôs the best part

#Dark and twisted

**DaHumanTorch** (6): can't wear depeche wig and be depeche

**sage** (5.9): musically its like fine but it drags so much and the chorus is absolutely fucking unbearable, the vocals are so shit like it sounds like they think theyre saying something so important and thats the worst type of vocals

**freeofblasphemy** (5.5): I like when he says ‚Äúi breathe in stereo‚Äù

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): hatsune miku outsold

**TiltControls** (5): still don't entirely get how this made it into AS5 over a bunch of other stuff in the rate

**fadedblue09** (3): Apparently I've rated thsi before and until now, I still cannot remember a single thing about it

**plastichaxan** (1): sorry I've been hurt enough by giving mgmt songs a 6 and they they do too well and i regret not fully tanking it... Never again

**runaway3212** (1): BOOO we hate you tiktok

**static\_int\_husp** (0): Yes I am still holding this grudge. Yes I also genuinely do not like this song. Their voices are so muc worse here than the rest of the album.

Uberpigeon: # Little Dark Age

---

**Overall Average**: 7.329 **// Average Controversy:** 1.944 // [User Averages](https://paste.ee/p/MSk5F)

---

RandomHypnotica: I have a lot of strong feelings attached to this album, it‚Äôs one of 2 that I was listening to a lot on an overseas trip (the other being Clarence Clarity‚Äôs THINK: PEACE), and so it takes me back to a very certain mood. I think that there are a few *very* obvious weak cuts here, but overall it‚Äôs easily my favourite sound MGMT has made so far, and I really hope they further explore it.

**altleftover** (9.550): 9.5

**Stryxen** (9.300): awesome, this isn‚Äôt my fav here even tho i have been stanning it so vocally on the discord lol, but it‚Äôs still virtually flawless. such an amazing reinvention of mgmt and haters are literally so boring sorry

**moonagenightmares** (9.100): MGMT WE FAWKING LOVE YOU

**zukomu** (9.000): One of my favourite albums of all time, just straight bangers front to back (except Hand it Over imo)

**cremeebrulee** (8.970): my poor meow meow... my baby my little baby who hurt so much but treats people with nothing but kindness forgive me for not being able to do more... i tried my best i really did..

**bogo** (8.900): this is a very good album

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (8.740): "psychyacht bummer" still feels like the only descriptor I could give the strangely pertinent Little Dark Age. MGMT has a knack for detail and 70s AM pop egging psychedelia that they understand how to weave a more bummed, but sociable vibe out of. It's why Little Dark Age never quite sounds overcluttered while containing an excess of ideas; they have a process that isn't built around dipshit naivety but earnest well-refined instincts of being in the grinder for a decade plus. Their fan base sorta sucks and I think they overpraise these guys too hard, but this is an excellent work that I almost never plan to return to in SPITE of practically 2 comically perfect batshit homeruns and some brilliant camp and real cunning sound design. Perhaps too frontloaded? No. Just a riveting pop album that hopefully opens kids up to more sounds.

**NFLfreak98** (8.580): Side A is one of my favorite halves of any synthpop album ever. It falls off a little after that but it's still just such a well-produced album that every song ends up sounding so good

**starla\_** (8.550): Average 8.6. Oracular Spectacular is one of my favourite albums of all time but I'd actually never listened to this before today. It's so good!!! I love the lo-fi, 80s inspired sound. It sounds like a warm spring day.

**flava** (8.550): yeah this album is just so much fun. Filled to the brim with tight and catchy hooks, personality, flair. And most importantly a texture that helps it stand above most other 80s synthpop throwback records. So glad I found something in this rate to love because I fear for the other albums

**apatel27** (8.450): Bit too moody

**TwoAmeobis** (8.160): The comeback I always wanted from MGMT

**freav** (8.100): used to think that this album declined a lot in the back half, still think it does, but not as much. really good stuff

**just\_thonking** (8.050): Insanely frontloaded but good

**jman457** (8.010): A great return to form making trailblazing bangers

**welcome2thejam** (7.700): It's so easy to see MGMT as just living a Strokes-esque existence of constantly struggling to follow up their enormous debut, but there's some strong stuff here that stacks up well, so good for them

**frogaranaman** (7.700): my mom likes this album which makes it hard to be mean to it because she does not like much music!!!!

**whizzer0** (7.600): I enjoyed a MGMT track from a previous rate so I was intrigued what I'd make of this. Turns out I liked every single track! I probably wouldn't have tried this album otherwise, so it's cool to find out about it.

**vayyiqra** (7.500): Lmao, it will never not be funny to me how much this group makes Popheads seethe. It just feels so random to me, they're two dudes who like keyboards and psychedelic drugs, kind of hipster but overall fairly harmless. "Time to Pretend" is a banger, not my preferred winner but I wasn't mad. Anyway this album was shilled to me as something I'd like because synth and yeah it does that, has a darker feel to a lot of it than their older music (which makes sense since it's heavily inspired by the "doomer" era of politics over the last decade) and some good songwriting. I don't love everything on it and don't know how much I will go back to it but I see the vision, you know, where the praise for it came from when it was released. Good album!

**thedoctordances1940** (7.330): I liked this a lot around when it came out but now whenever i return to it i realise i don't really like half the album, but the stuff i do like is really good, just a very mixed bag

**imbaby122** (7.230): i love an 80s revival moment. which is why i really wish that mgmt leaned into that sound throughout. the most characteristically 80s, corniest, synthiest songs on the album were the best tracks, and when mgmt strayed from that sound, the album completely lost my attention, or was just straight up bad. there are so many great tracks on this album, which makes me more disappointed because it truly had the potential to be my favorite album in the rate. now that i‚Äôve dragged the album, i‚Äôll say that mgmt does 80s revival incredibly well. it leans into the camp factor on some tracks, on others the spooky darkness of 80s synths, and sometimes it‚Äôs straight up groovy. it just works. this album is a great example of how to do 80s right in this oversaturated 80s revival market.

**nt96** (7.140): I'm not too crazy about MGMT and I've never really cared to listen to their music. This album started out pretty strong but I felt it really sputtered in the end. It's ok but it was nothing groundbreaking nor anything different from the millions of synth pop stuff that calls anything with a cheap synth retro.

**akanewasright** (7.100): honestly the first few songs of the album were way stronger than I‚Äôd thought

**dream\_fighter2018** (6.400): maybe I‚Äôm just ageist but it feels like no group that has been active for over ten years has ever accurately nailed the political protest album. Often they lack nuance, eschew interesting or complex music and lyricism for on the nose messages, or just feel out of touch. MGMT has moments where they truly nail the perfect political song - and then there are moments where they toss out any nuance to complain about phones like old men. The neo psych instrumentals are quite nice and are the best part of the album by far, although one song sounds too much like a sucky Tame Impala song.

**TiltControls** (5.750): This album isn't even that awful. But there's just nothing grabbing me in the slightest (except maybe When You Die). I wonder if this wasn't MGMT if I'd appreciate it a bit more since I really loved their stuff from Oracular and I miss the brighter sounds on it (especially the vocals).

**freeofblasphemy** (5.700): Time to pretend this album isn‚Äôt boring

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.500): what if this was a single I would cheer

**pig-serpent** (5.000): The worst kind of album to rate, in that I find it unremarkable and uninteresting, but I can still recognize the little hints of talent and goodness thrown in to the point where it's nowhere close to being bad enough to have fun tanking it.  I thought this band used to be interesting too, idk what happened here.

**fadedblue09** (4.750): I do not have any strong hatred towards them like some raters do, but after listening to this I might as well have. I'm really shocked how middling and forgettable this was. Say what you want about Superorganism, but at least they sounded like they were trying. This whole album  just went out one ear and out another. And to think I was actually looking forward to this. Consider me disappointed.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.450): something that tends to happen to me quite a lot is that i‚Äôll listen to a band that‚Äôs very highly acclaimed in online communities, ones where almost everyone agrees on just how talented and underrated they are, and yet when i listen to them i am absolutely *baffled* at what their appeal is supposed to be, and mgmt is not an exception. i had a deep hatred of all their hits from the oracular spectacular era (expect to see me give time to pretend a 0 in the upcoming winners rate) and it left me very wary to check out this album, even with it supposedly being their best, as a result. while i will admit there are a couple great songs on here (and by a couple i mean just she works out too much and me and michael), pretty much every other track suffers from the same reasons i dont like their other work: its just not very interesting to listen to and im not a big fan of their fusion of psychedelic rock with more poppy hooks. one the bright side, at least i can say it wasnt the worst album in the rate!

**plastichaxan** (3.750): This album bored me quite a lot I can‚Äôt lie, I tried to find stuff to like but I guess MGMT just isn‚Äôt for me

**akanewasright** (11): remember 2012 when lana &  marina and the diamonds ruled the internet what a time

**celladonn** (11): Amazing and shocked by how well these songs go together. Not many mashups sound so spot on.


**dream\_fighter2018** (11): omg i remember this was iconic on tumblr 6 yrs ago


**fadedblue09** (11):I love both of these songs, but this mashup takes it to a whole new level. Sensational üòç

**pig-serpent** (11): this is the most nostalgic thing i remember this from back in high school  üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠


**rotating3Dtext** (11): Quanto mais o tempo passa melhor esse mashup fica

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): When the two songs you think aren't alike AT ALL actually sound awesome together.

**apatel27** (10): marina is the best by far!<3 thats why its her voice singing the whole time^_^


**Awkward\_King** (10): this is the ""sarah bonito i am free on th-" GUNSHOTS" meme format as a song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): these are my favorite songs so listening to this makes me so happy :)


**bogo** (10): Tell me I'm your national anthem been with Lana since the beginning and this is truly beautiful


**cremeebrulee** (10): PROOF that they need to collab. This is the most angelic mashup I've ever heard


**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): lana and marina songs are literally  made for each other


**destroyallhumans2** (10): People who say their voices don‚Äôt go together can sit down. This is a perfect example of harmony of talented artists who happen to be very good friends.

**frogaranaman** (10): I love marina and lana so much. this is incredible!


**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Marina has the voice of a million angels I am just being introduced to her music. I've been a fan of Lana for years. Marina is EXCELLENT. I'm impressed. üíé


**homestarguy** (10): You have made, in my humble opinion, a musical perfection. Your channel must receive many praises but you have given the world a wonderful hybrid beauty with this.


**plastichaxan** (10): DEUSAS CANTANDO AMEM !!

**reput4tionera** (10): HINOOOOOOOOO MINHAS DUAS RAINHA

**sage** (10): My two favorite female vocalists along with Hannah from London Grammar. Great mix

**seanderlust** (10):Mariana would be a GREAT collab but so would Evina/Mareva (Marina and evanesence). Both collabs NEED to happen !!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): and once again, Only Acting falls short of victory. I have to say, I‚Äôm impressed that it managed to make it as high as it did, and even take the lead a few times, I assumed that it would be a lot more divisive for‚Ä¶ well obvious reasons. But for better or worse, this is easily *the* defining track of Time ‚Äòn‚Äô Place, and one of KKB‚Äôs career highlights, it was the perfect stepping stone for the band to take to transition to a more ‚Äúserious‚Äù sound, and the glitches absolutely feed my brain endorphins.

**Uberpigeon** (10): This was once my favourite song of all time but I‚Äôm glad it didn‚Äôt win. That would be so predictable! Maybe the whole gimmick of the song with them going all crazy in the middle hasn‚Äôt aged totally well... It‚Äôs a little corny now but at the time this song absolutely blew my mind. Pop band go scary noises????!!! Cool!!!!

#Oscar Winners

**akanewasright** (11): This chorus is straight up MAGIC, like they *nailed* this melody. It has the classic kkb flair to the verses and a truly *delicious* chorus melody

**celladonn** (11): It just absolutely rules. Bops so hard, rocks so hard, so unsettling and scary.

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): this is a bit gremlin. A bit unhinged. Quirky to the third degree. Musical chaos that black midi has been unable to replicate.

**fadedblue09** (11): I gave this a zero before what am I doing

**pig-serpent** (11): This song is my music taste in a nutshell.  Cutsy vocals, the best hook KKB have ever written, a dive into noise rock, a great guitar solo, loud abrasive noises, trolling the audience by refusing to play the chorus again, and a spooky outro puncuated with a loud drilling sound.  I wish they made a full album like this.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): Idk if the song is about social media or what but this is what having social anxiety and not knowing wtf you are doing feels like

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): god this is just so cathartic to listen to‚Ä¶i know this probably wasn‚Äôt kkb‚Äôs intention when making this but i‚Äôve never heard another song that better represents how it feels being neurodivergent and having to act ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in a public setting, the yelling section in the middle representing trying to push away your true thoughts from everyone and the ending where it just completely loses all form and coherence, for when you *finally* get home and can drop the act, and just vent out all the frustrations you have trying to put up an act for a world that claims it supports you but will mock you behind your back for acting even slightly out of line. in a way i feel like the radio edit almost ruins the song by removing the glitchyness at the end and taking away the song‚Äôs biggest point, it‚Äôs not supposed to be a normal pop song, its *only acting* like one to distract you from what‚Äôs underneath. i know this is gonna get haters because of the ending and i get that, i‚Äôd be lying if i said i wasn‚Äôt part of that group at first too, but its rare to find a song that conveys its own meaning so well just by instrumental alone.

**apatel27** (10): God it's so good. From the opening riffs about imposter syndrome to not being able to process your emotions and the amazing breakdowns within the song. This is nothing like anything else KKB have made yet at the same time it's the best thing they've ever made.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is the ""sarah bonito i am free on th-" GUNSHOTS" meme format as a song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I mean I kinda hate it but it‚Äôs perfect.

**bogo** (10): more music should sound like someone just unleashed the wrath of a vengeful god

**cremeebrulee** (10): you‚Äôre not gonna get the song the first time you hear it . after the second and third time, you‚Äôre gonna be like woah what is this? it sounds nothing like anything that‚Äôs in the rate right now

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I love twee music that features the sound of a dial-up internet router exploding

**destroyallhumans2** (10): all the crab are in their seats

**frogaranaman** (10): someone is gonna say this outro gave them nightmares

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I‚Äôve told this story like eight times on the Discord but I saw KKB at a hole in the wall venue with a friend a little bit after this song came out and when it came on the place just EXPLODED, everyone started screaming along and jumping up and down. Pure joy. I also have a bias for this one because it‚Äôs the centerpiece of a playlist I made for one of my OCs, Poppet my beloved one day I will tell your story.

**homestarguy** (10): The absolute genius of this one. The absolute headache I have after I listen to it.

**plastichaxan** (10): They put their whole KKBussy into this this is truly one of my favorite songs ever ugh why can‚Äôt I have like 5 11s

**reput4tionera** (10): the first time i heard this song i thought my phone broke

**runaway3212** (10): most normal kkb song

**sage** (10): best song ever

**seanderlust** (10): "The idea is that you can‚Äôt put "Only Acting‚Äù on a playlist because this section will ruin the whole thing; it‚Äôs an anti-playlist song." well guess what mimi

**slimboyfriend** (10): Meryl Streep could never and I dare her to try

**Stryxen** (10): just perfect. They had possibly the catchiest hooks ever, embedded in the most meticulously crafted indie rock instrumental i've ever heard with ridiculously charming lyrics and Sarah's vocals tying it all together. And then they take it to the next 3 levels and fuck around with very thought out and expertly organised chaos to really make you FEEL the performance with your WHOLE body AND soul. High concept

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): everyone talks about their glitch moment but the way the instruments come in one by one at the start is so pleasing to listen to

**welcome2thejam** (10): Two perfect song climaxes consisting of an eight second guitar solo and the Batman Arkham Asylum fake glitch, wowza

**zukomu** (10): this song sounds like how I feel on a good day

**camerinian** (9.5): throwback to the plug party (rip) for the top 100 of the year and the mass dislike bombing at the three minute mark

**TwoAmeobis** (9.5): Radio edit probs gets a 10 from me

**imbaby122** (9.2): fun fact actually really really sad fact this song was directly pulled from my deranged brain.

**jasannn** (9): it might be too glitchy for its own good sometimes

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): yeah the noisier parts are really good

**jman457** (8.5): Hey, I remember this song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): this is a High School Musical song

**heysoupie** (8.2): I‚Äôm so confused about how to rate this song. Because I really like the chorus and the guitar solo & the lyrics. The vocals are less grating than on other tracks. But I HATE random screaming (even hints of it!) and the disconnect between the intro and the ending, while clearly deliberate‚Ä¶are just annoying imo. The weird skipping section always makes me want to check to make sure my music is working‚Ä¶and the ending static noise is just unpleasant.

**freav** (8): this song tires me honestly but these melodies are still great

**moonagenightmares** (7.5): removed a point because of that disaster ending

**starla\_** (7.5): this is noisy but in a better way

Uberpigeon: #Razzie Winners

**TiltControls** (7.5): It's been some time since IH exchange but I still think this would've been 2 points higher without the ending

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.2): when I'm driving and start losing the radio signal

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): my laptop lags so much that i checked if spotify broke my computer again when the last minute hit....

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (6.9): The glitch does not work if you listen to it on any format that isn't digital and I listened to it on tape. God still one of the stupidest fucking things this group has done. Like okay guys, cool you used a song as a trojan horse to suggest some sort of quantum time break that's akin to watching Don't Touch Me I'm Scared. It's a shame  though bc the noise break is also indulgent bullshit. smh would not scale at the noise fests lemme just say.

**impla77** (6.7): damn kinda turns into a horror movie soundtrack

**flava** (6.5): rating the radio edit cause the start-stop is irritating and uninteresting

**1998tweety** (6): please no loud glitchy noises

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6): sowing: yes YES YES!! HAHA. reaping: well this sucks

**vayyiqra** (6): How does this song begin so amazingly and then get so awful? It's not even the CD-skipping ending, though that's bad too; the screeching and squelching around 1:45-2:05 is much worse. What a waste of an amazing opening verse and prechorus. They should've stuck to the indie pop sound with clean guitar chords. Too much fuzz on this album. More fuzz is not more better. I'm sure this song's abrasive elements are a high-IQ representation of a mental breakdown or something, but that doesn't mean I have to like it! Sad.

**indie\_fan\_** (5): It was all fine until the damn track starting taking a dive into the dark web

**freeofblasphemy** (2): Cool transitions but the production is just really off-putting, especially the ‚Äúskipping‚Äù section. Actually, fuck it. This song it‚Äôs up its own ass and I hate it

**CrimsonROSET** (0): ‚Äòoh but you gave this an 8 in indieheads exchange‚Äô well today we teach about rating on a curve. IE was filled with music I would never ever go back to, so in comparison, this was good because the earlier parts i could stand in comparison to the end that completely throws it off! But now rating it not only with the rest of the project but in comparison to other albums that I would come back to, no I don‚Äôt like it! the ‚Äònormal‚Äô parts feel underbaked compared to the instrumentation in the rest of the record and the ‚Äònoise‚Äô has no release/normalcy so i only really see it as noise!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I always knew this song would do well, largely by virtue of just being uncontroversial in an album (and rate for that matter) full of divisive front-runners, and I‚Äôm really happy to see it win! It wasn‚Äôt ever a dominating lead, but at a certain point it just got into first place and‚Ä¶ never really left. I can *strongly* relate to that feeling of just wanting to sleep and stay dreaming so I don‚Äôt have to face the real world, and stomach all the anxieties, stress and pain that comes with it, and Make Believe perfectly captures it. A deserved winner, and *finally* we can say‚Ä¶ Kero Kero Bonito rate winner!!!

**Uberpigeon** (10): A winner I would never have predicted but in hindsight it makes sense‚Ä¶ After all, this song DID change my life when It came out. A screenshot from the video was my facebook wall banner for ages. I think everyone can agree this is an uncontroversial highlight from Time ‚Äòn‚Äô Place so it just kind of wormed its way into first place.

#Believers

**heysoupie** (11): I think this is the only song I knew from KKB coming into the rate. I was expecting to give it a 7 & I am unsure if‚Ä¶it‚Äôs better than I remembered it or if so many of the rest of the songs in this rate (sorry, LEG) are just so bad that this one is great in contrast.

**homestarguy** (11): Hooh boy. Never had an easier 11 to pick for a rate yet. I think this is the best song they have ever recorded to date. Every second of it: every synth flourish, the driving poppy drums and bass, the rush of overdriven guitars in the second verse, Sarah‚Äôs sweet voice‚Ä¶it‚Äôs an absolute triumph of a song and I am constantly seeking other songs that scratch this particular itch. Shoutout to z from crying btw, another great band.

**jasannn** (11): this song got me through post-graduation blues

**reput4tionera** (11): hearing this song in 2018 rewired my brain chemistry

**seanderlust** (11): this sounds like the theme song to an 80s sitcom. also I really love the lyrics.

**slimboyfriend** (11): this is one of those songs about growing up that hit me so deep that it gives me this unique sense of melancholy. It's like your child singing to you about how growing up sucks because adulthood suffocates your imagination

**welcome2thejam** (11): Only now am I finding out that the second verse doesn't start with "And though this song / is pretty boss," I was always like "hell yeah it is!"

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is like if an algorithm made a kkb song and its perfect

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Hell yes I love not thinking about reality so much.

**bogo** (10): this song is friend shaped

**frogaranaman** (10): very good live

**plastichaxan** (10): This is the only song I‚Äôve had as an alarm that I can‚Äôt seem to get tired of I think that‚Äôs impressive

**runaway3212** (10): god I love kkb

**sage** (10): the synth part at the end

**Stryxen** (10): relentlessly packed with the catchiest hooks ever it‚Äôs almost unfair to songwriters everywhere that they used up every single possible melody on this one song. Also the synths running all over this are very pretty and magical, that‚Äôs all i have to say about that

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): all their life they tried to make believe. instead they made bops.

**vayyiqra** (10): One of the catchiest choruses on this album. I know the point of this album is not catchy choruses, but still.

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (10): Make Believe still stands as the perennial top shelf KKB cut (for a band that does have at least half a dozen or so). Perhaps because more than anything else, this functions as a fantastically bittersweet admission of finding one's self in isolation and dreams, away from it all. The video of Sarah sorta just wandering around an empty mental hospital complex/light show is VERY endearing and heartfelt; you lose yourself in your insanity as much as you come out finding a new version of you there; i see myself there. Make Believe additionally features a fantastic, by-the-numbers, outro that feels like a culmination of side A's greatest strengths: genius streamlined shoegaze reverb being applied as a baseline for gorgeous synth amongst other bells and whistles. it amounts to a significantly wistful yet aching moment of pop honest and bliss nothing has topped. I'm always moved to tears.

**impla77** (9.7): quite existential for such an upbeat song

**destroyallhumans2** (9.5): me every waking moment

**freav** (9.5): this one is undeniable

**imbaby122** (9.4): kkb mental illness tune. turn this shit up!!!!!

**celladonn** (9): what a lovely bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is the kinda thing people love about KKB, they take these ordinary experiences but infuse them with such a sense of cheeky wonder.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.8): aww <3

**1998tweety** (8): hold awn this bops

**CrimsonROSET** (8): see the noisier stuff works well here because it‚Äôs actually used as tension that is alleviated!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): maladaptive daydreaming anthem

**fadedblue09** (8): Cutest instrumental in the rate

**flava** (8): kinda hits, the whimsy seems more resonant here

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.8): Weezer outsold

**TiltControls** (7.5): The production is some of the most fun in the rate, I just wish there weren't so many parts where to vocal doesn't match the energy

**jman457** (7.1): It had a cool ending

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this is just only acting 2.0 but without the glitches

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6.5): hey that sleeping, dreaming part is pretty catchy

#Wishing it was all a dream....

**freeofblasphemy** (5.5): Some good melodic elements here but there‚Äôs also just too much clutter that keeps it from true greatness

**starla\_** (5.5): this is okay

**pig-serpent** (3): Whoops I didn't pay attention to this.

RandomHypnotica: It‚Äôs hard for me to pin down exactly what my favourite album of all time is‚Ä¶ but this is pretty damn close. It came out at the exact right time to connect with my life, and I think my favourite thing about the album, and the way it explores so many different times and places of life, and how much of a struggle it is in general, there‚Äôs this underlying sense of optimism and hope that shines through, and this album just constantly makes me feel like everything will be OK.

Uberpigeon: This is one of my favourite albums ever. It made a huge impact on me on release and I still adore it. I‚Äôm a sucker for light girly vocals over messy loud production which this album has in spades, and I love the stories sarah paints with the plain yet vivid lyrics. Like‚Ä¶ this album really do be about times and places. Everyday life vibes for a regular girl like me. I go to the dump. I sleep. She‚Äôs just like me. SHES JUST LIKE ME FR!!!!

**reput4tionera** (10.059): this is genuinely my favorite album of all time it saved me during 2020 and just goddamn there is no album like it

**sage** (10.024): band of all time

**apatel27** (9.706): My favourite album of 2018; Over Daytona and Dirty Computer. There's just something amazing about it and it hit landed at the perfect time. Post Uni still feeling aimless, this album was practically my mindset turned into an album and has been on repeat for the past 4 years.

**Stryxen** (9.588): kkb was one of the first artists I ever really STANNED. This is possibly my least favourite album of theirs? And its flawless? Perfection? It was there for me in a very rough time and even listening now oooh it's bringing stuff back and making me feel a little emo lol. I'll be worse when we rate bonito generation . f11sh bowl

**homestarguy** (9.412): KKB has become one of my favorite groups over the past year, and while I greatly enjoy each major project and side-project of theirs so far, I keep coming back to TOTEP and TnP due to its introspective and noisy takes on their electropop sound. I'm so sad I missed out on seeing them live as a full band during 2018/19, and I hope they tour in that way again someday soon.

**plastichaxan** (9.324): Truly invented both concepts, life changing album fr

**bogo** (8.882): i think this is when kkb really came into their own artistically, like yeah bonito generation is a fun lil album but this album here takes the fun cuteness cuteness of that album and applies it to really cool sounds and styles. the noisy pop-rock on here is a blast and i wish they would do more of this from time to time.

**welcome2thejam** (8.765): Doing this rate & rating Civilization earlier this year firmly established KKB as a current top tier favorite band for me. Just too much good stuff in their discography

**nt96** (8.647): after hearing Civilization (with another album being right around the corner), Time 'n' Place provided a nice change of pace trading their usual synth heavy, bubblegum soundscape for something that's grittier, more rock-adjacent yet spacious. Dig deeper and beneath their whiplashed glitchy collages and airy guitars, their colorful trademark sound is still there.

**imbaby122** (8.635): kero kero bonito does a great job of characterizing existential doom through sound in time n place. the soundscape of this album is like if someone plugged an amp into my brain when i‚Äôm up late at night thinking about the universe and my purpose on earth and humanity. it‚Äôs properly messy, dreadful, relatable, and, at times, hopeful. not to mention that kkb knows how to write an earworm in any genre. every element of production feels purposeful, and contributes to the theme of existentialism just as much as the lyrical content. i think that‚Äôs where kkb excel, in being able to imitate feeling through sound, and they were certainly successful with this project.

**altleftover** (8.124): 8.5

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.059): KKB once made a long list of inspirations for this album on their subreddit. Among that list was Sh≈çso Strip. The point I'm trying to make is go listen to Sh≈çso Strip. Sh≈çso Strip!!

**TwoAmeobis** (7.735): Twee noise pop KKB is best KKB

**cremeebrulee** (7.688): i‚Äôm like the fakest KKB fan ever since i only really like Civilisation üíÄ this album was okay. i love the straightforward indie rock half of it, but the dreamier middle stretch bored me a bit. i just prefer sarah‚Äôs gentle voice against something more robust ig. it doesn't seem like they plan on returning to this sound, which is fine i‚Äôm more partial to their recent stuff anyway‚Ä¶ but if they ever want to put out an album full of only acting's and flyway‚Äôs, i would be here for it

**vayyiqra** (7.588): Ah, KKB discourse, quickly becoming our least favourite topic. I'm sure we are all sick of KKB evangelism. I'm sick of it, and I was part of the problem ! We have now rated the album that KKBists are most noisy about, and also it's KKB's most noisy. :joy: No really, this isn't my favourite by KKB (I like Bonito Generation much more, do the rate next month) but I see the vision on this one. It's good, I liked it enough to see them on the tour for it, I love some songs on it. I'm not losing my mind over some of it, including a low score for one fan favourite song that my hosts are going to hate (you have been warned upfront) and am kind of glad we're getting the KKB discog speedrun over with soon. Good group, lots of great material! I just don't connect with this one as much as some fans do, which is kind of odd because I am a very depressed man much of the time. However the fuzzy grey distorted sound of a lot of this album isn't my thing. I like when KKB do their faux-Jpop-bleepbloop happy thing more, that's all. Still I respect what they did on this album and the more mature songwriting themes.

**freav** (7.582): well written record with some incredible songs, but i never really want to listen to it for some reason, i find it oddly exhausting and im not sure Sarah's airy vocals go well with this

=====

Uberpigeon: **WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (7.459): KKB still strike me as a frustratingly good pop act. One not really worth fighting over (y'all don't need to rate their whole catalog in the span of a year, that's just frivolous) nor taking for granted (these albums are bolded for vaguely understandable reasons), but also one that really really demands that you enjoy pop to sick twisted degrees I can't always do. On Time 'n' Place, the band made a bold leap out of just making top notch fun pop and actively trying to world build and sonically time travel to a new zone. The result was an (at times heartbreaking beautiful) album that sounded like it belonged on Polyvinyl in 2018, which is about as backhanded of a compliment I can muster. In the 4 years since, I've given my tape (not the best mastering job there imo) a handful of listens that don't always exactly convey to me why I bought the album (it was a $5 pick up so actually, I do know). KKB's notion of the 90s is a little more inspired and cunning than most other retreads, enough to move them out of landfill writ large, and into post-modern meta commentary. But its when they rlly dip into assclown twee or dipshit noise, they start to break the magical weirdness that is holding it up. idk how to describe my gripe--its a little bit a "show not tell" thing with some production choices and instrumentals & some other energy, but I do find the KKB trio to be of fascination. they still have a bonafide, "lore-worthy & obsess over" masterpiece in them. at least the bonus EP did help to flesh out just how brilliant a stray deep cut can catch can my attention. a good, not great group that long term will be recognized for singles, not albums.

**whizzer0** (7.412): I've heard about this album a lot and it really seems like something I should like. Well, I did like it, although there wasn't a track that particularly stood out to me. Maybe that would change on repeat listens.

**TiltControls** (7.382): It's a fine album. Good even! But I much prefer the sound they went with on Bonito Generation over this. In the end some of the tracks just blur together a little too much for me. Still, there's some great stuff in here so I can appreciate the new direction a little

**thedoctordances1940** (6.888): my main issue with this album and a lot of kkb in general is that i just can't get myself to really enjoy the vocals. Luckily they still have some great ideas on the production and instrumentation side of things so that i don't completely dislike them

**just\_thonking** (6.794): I have finally listened to enough KKB to conclude that they are in fact overrated. Also why are the extra songs better than the actual album

**jman457** (6.788): This kind of underwhelmed me. This sub hypes up KKB a lot, but this bored me, some interesting production choices but it felt very one note

**dream\_fighter2018** (6.765): hey, remember when this album was in a twee rate?

**fadedblue09** (6.588): Well who would've thought the album I was looking forward to the least somehow ended up being the most enjoyable? And they turned one of my previous 0s into an 11‚Ä¶.ugh their minds! There are several songs that I still couldn't vibe with, but even at their worst their sound and aesthetic constantly engages me, which is more than I can say for the other 3 artists.

**pig-serpent** (6.529): This is the album where KKB started to lose me.  It has some of their best songs but a lot of the dream pop direction they went in was just in one ear and out the other for me.  I haven't particularly liked anything they've done since.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.524): unfortunately the rest of the album never gets anywhere close to the highs of only acting but its a solidly enjoyable indie pop record with some nice experimentation. the non-album songs included here are also nice inclusions but drag my average down a little

**frogaranaman** (6.412): a/s/l?

**starla\_** (6.235): Average 5.9. I like Kero Kero Bonito but they're very hit or miss for me. They're also one of those bands that I can't listen to for long without finding them irritating, thanks to Sarah's very one note delivery. I enjoyed the b-sides and EP cuts more than the actual album, which wasn't my favourite.

**NFLfreak98** (5.929): One of the most confounding albums for me personally. I've listened to it a couple different times since it came out and it always strikes me how almost exactly half of it is really good and the other half they took good songs and decided they would rather them not sound good

**zukomu** (5.882): This album has some incredible peaks and some ridiculously forgettable valleys

**freeofblasphemy** (5.118): I love KKB but I really dislike this album. The bonus tracks are good, though

**flava** (5.059): I don‚Äôt really get KKB‚Äôs brand of out there indie pop that always seems too childlike for me to like. Just a really odd group that I think won‚Äôt be for me, no matter how much they change up their sound because that core aversion will always be there. I hate the faux-happy attitude, or how anything is mixed. Basically i hate the aesthetic of this album. sorry

**moonagenightmares** (4.665): it all sounds the same

=====

pig-serpent: This rate was actually a lot of fun, despite the results.  It was nice to have a reason to go back to some old favorites I haven't played much in recent years and I had a few discoveries in the one album I hadn't listened to before.  We were overdue for this rate and I'm happy that it's happened.

=====

RandomHypnotica: Thank you so much to everyone who participated in the reveal! I'm so glad to see KKB finally get a much deserved rate win, and I can only hope this doesn't negatively affect their performance in cyberpop next month...

In other news, the winner of our prediction game, with all 5 songs correctly guessed, and 1 with a correct placement (plus the closest average guess for the winner) is... /u/CrimsonROSET!!!

lemme know if you want gold or nitro

TiltControls: Great job with the rate Hypno and Benji! I only made it to the final day, but there were some fantastic shitposts and the banners were amazing!!!

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) have been updated!

## Songs

Congrats to Kero Kero Bonito for the top 2 sweep! We'll see if they can keep up that momentum for cyberpop (spoiler: I'm guessing they won't), but even if not it's still a great showing to take the podium! **Make Believe** becomes the 510th highest rated song across all rates on the sub. 

* It ties in score with Frank Ocean's Bad Religion, Lady Gaga's Just Dance (from 2009 Year End Rate), and Green Day's American Idiot. It was slightly outscored by Paramore's Ignorance and Lorde's Team and did slightly better than Michael Jackson's Bad and Kendrick Lamar's u.

No other real records tonight but do want to mention a couple of untracked ones.

* Across every song to make the top 5 in a rate, LEG's **Hot Pink** becomes the 2nd most controversial song to make it that high. It's only beaten by another SOPHIE production: Vroom Vroom in the 2016 EP Rate (2.931 to 2.731). 
 * For anyone curious the top 5 is rounded out by Selena Gomez's Hands to Myself (2.727), Harry Styles' Sign of the Times (2.704), and Carly Rae Jepsen's Call Me Mabye (2.510) [from the 1 year anniversary rate]
 * If the criteria is limited to songs to place in the top 3 then **Little Dark Age** would be 7th in that stat
* **Sometimes**, though controversial, just misses the top 50 and becomes the 51st most controversial song ever rated (shut out by iLOVEFRiDAY's MiA KHALiFA)

## Artists

Placements for the artist averages are out of **342 artists**. KKB has an existing placement, but the other three are new to the board. MGMT has previous scores with Little Dark Age (x2) and Time to Pretend affecting its placement.

-

* 139th: Lil Nas X (7.636)
* **140th: Kero Kero Bonito (7.634) [PREV 89th]**
* 141st: SEVENTEEN (7.626)


-

* 163rd: Bridgit Mendler (7.559)
* **164th: MGMT (7.557) [NEW]**
* 165th: TLC (7.549)


-

* 182nd: Charli XCX (7.480)
* **183rd: Let's Eat Grandma (7.475) [NEW]**
* 184th: Madonna / Marina (7.472)


-

* 313th: Usher (6.662)
* **314th: Superorganism (6.632) [NEW]**
* 315th: GoonRock (6.628)

-

## Albums

(Note these are including songs on the album, so the extra KKB songs are not counted)

* With a 6.632 average, Superorganism's album **Superorganism** becomes the 13th lowest rated album of all time. It scored slightly better than Katy Perry's Prism and Selena Gomez and The Scene's Kiss & Tell.

 * For the other three:

  * Let's Eat Grandma's album ties with Kelis's Tasty, scores below Billie Eilish's WWAFAWDWG and higher than Ed Sheeran's x

  * MGMT's Little Dark Age scores below Camila Cabello's Camila and above BROCKHAMPTON's Ginger

  * Kero Kero Bonito's Time 'n' Place ties with Hannah Diamond's Reflections, scores below J Balvin's Vibras and slightly above CHVRCHES' Screen Violence

* It's not leaderboard worthy, but another shoutout to **Superorganism** to getting the 13th lowest 11 split for an album rate, only getting 6.90% of the 11's in the rate (leaderboard cutoff is Solange's When I Get Home with 6.70%). It also becomes the 12th most controversial album ever rated (cutoff is Ava Max's Heaven & Hell at 2.320)

whizzer0: somehow it only just occurred to me that Ultra Red by October came out in 2018 and I'm going to tell myself it wasn't included because it would be unfair on the other albums and not because nobody's heard of it. but *holy shit* if y'all like any of the albums on this rate you will adore that album. anyway sorry I'm a bit late and commented too much but thank you for hosting and thank you to everyone who voted correctly!
