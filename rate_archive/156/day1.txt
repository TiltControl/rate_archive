**RandomHypnotica** (8): OK I genuinely didn’t realise this song was as hated as it was… i’ve always found it to be a charming little song, and the imagery of waiting for a godzilla attack is done really well and quite unique, but a lot of people didn’t enjoy the “wetness” of the song.

**Uberpigeon** (8): Wow people really didn’t like this one huh. I like it, I think its cool.

---
#Inklings

**Stryxen** (10): come on splatoon

**nt96** (7): what in the drunken Splatoon Crossing

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): why did this turn into a splatoon song midway through

#Loves mud


**impla77** (9.2): I guess I love just another song about Tokyo

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): I thought "I can’t hear this song over my boyfriend playing video games" then realized it was only the music… anyways sing it Toad!!!

**runaway3212** (8): she was hated by some but I understood her

**jman457** (7.3): This took a left hand turn half way through, and I kind of liked it

**imbaby122** (6.3): right what’s all this then

**1998tweety** (6): their one miss

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6): wuh...why does the Genius for this mention Pearl Harbor? Completely unrelated wtf

**CrimsonROSET** (6): day out in tokyo I wrote you a letter

**pig-serpent** (6): Instead of feeling like a break from the main album, this interlude feels like filler.

# I guess this is just another song about Tokyo...

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.5): they deadass just ripped off a kkb song

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Sounds too wet and the middle part of the song sounds like it’s mocking the first part

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): interlude energy (affectionate)

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I guess this is just another song about Tokyo ~~(except this one’s probably gonna go out first)~~

**plastichaxan** (5): zzz


**sage** (4.7): okay

**starla\_** (4.5): annoying

**heysoupie** (4.2): irritated by the fading in and out and the weird noises in the end. Feels like hanging out with a toddler. Chaotic.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Uh…okay here’s the point where I can’t really dispute the people saying this album is annoying

**amr** (3.5): the first bit of this song is some of the best music they've done on this album and then they ruin it with...whatever that is

**indie\_fan\_** (3.5): What in the random video game sounds???

**TiltControls** (3.5): If this song stopped after the first minute it'd probably be double this score

**bogo** (3): what are these synths

**homestarguy** (3): John Philip Sousa rolling in his grave.

**welcome2thejam** (3): There's potential in the hazyness but boy is it not realized

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): girl what

**camerinian** (2.5): they probably should have just pulled off the band-aid and called this “interlude”

**cremeebrulee** (2): i'll just use this as a catch-all for my low scores on the album but these songs try so hard to sound quirky by throwing a hundred different noises over some boring, monotonously delivered chorus and it mades it difficult to just find something redeemable or worth relistening for

**fadedblue09** (2): Was Donald Duck featured here

**freeofblasphemy** (2): It’s like everything unbearable about theater kids in one song

**vayyiqra** (2): It might be that it comes after a song I have a seething hatred for but this is stupid and the droning guitar, wacky noises (is that a fucking frog? what?) and chaotic vibes of this song are actively pissing me off. Even worse this song is supposed to be about the climate apocalypse, hardly a wacky topic, but they approach it in one of the worst ways I've ever seen (saying "Tokyo" a lot does not tell me anything), and I'm a stan of a woman who made an album where the goal was to "make climate change fun". Superorganism more like super annoying! aha gottem

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (1.6): oh good its that FUCKING one guitar riff and reverb nonsense. AND THEN THEY ACTUALLY DO THAT BABY BABBLE ARGLE BARGLE BRIDGE?! christ its like they want me to punch my speakers.

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): is this their attempt at Long Season peepeepoopoo section

**akanewasright** (0): why does this just steal ideas and samples from their other songs and do them worse

**flava** (0): this is the part of the album where you need mind-altering substance to not 0 it

**just\_thonking** (0): God I can barely sit through this

**reput4tionera** (0): the song was going so well until That happened

**seanderlust** (0): why is donald duck featured on the back half of this track

#Kitty Girls

**a-man-with-a-perm** (10): hey it's a cat purring and a jaunty victorian beach tune, sue me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): idgaf this is hilarious. The only ASMR I can tolerate

**freeofblasphemy** (10): Purrfect

**jman457** (10): Im a cat person sorry

**just\_thonking** (10): purr

**nt96** (10): A nice homage to the Tasty intro. Love it

**plastichaxan** (10): helping my girls (2)

**seanderlust** (10): cats purring is honestly one of the most soothing sounds for me so this is an easy 10

**zukomu** (10): meow

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Maybe I should have done VGI because these instrumental interludes are slaying me

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (8.4): it's really funny how just adding some asmr stuff & being very earnestly in fucking around on the organ actually is a good interlude that brings us into the god tier final 25 minutes

**vayyiqra** (8): Not sure we needed two minute-long interludes this close together on this album but sure, organ, why not.

**cremeebrulee** (7): bananas in pyjamas ended ha

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): wedding music

**destroyallhumans2** (5.5): another interlude, but bonus points for kitty

**akanewasright** (5): huh

**bogo** (5): this cat asmr makes me uncomfortable

**celladonn** (5): cat purring and licking asmr

**imbaby122** (5): i miss my cats 😿

**pig-serpent** (5): I'm not sure if I like the way that growling tickles my ears or not.

**starla\_** (5): yet another interlude

**Stryxen** (5): this is just so funny to me like what were they thinking. I can’t hate it even if i try

#DeadBananas In Pyjamas

**Awkward\_King** (4): this is pleasant

**CrimsonROSET** (4): meow

**slimboyfriend** (4): I didn’t sign up for cat asmr

**welcome2thejam** (4): Bro how do I score cat ASMR

**impla77** (3.7): got asmr from cat purrs

**camerinian** (3): uhhhh

**runaway3212** (2): I hate asmr

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): I’m sorry but the cat sounds are making me so uncomfortable. I know it’s an interlude and I shouldn’t be mean but the cats… the cats!!!

**flava** (1): now why does this exist but more aggressive

**frogaranaman** (1): what

**homestarguy** (1): Gets saved from a 0 for being a recording of an actual cat, which is kinda cute.

**Hulnia** (1): ew

**moonagenightmares** (1): ?

**reput4tionera** (1): oh these noises are nasty

**Roxieloxie** (1): can i have another 0 on this album i hate this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): what does this even add to the album other than setting off my misophonia

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3EMq1Muo-w

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): arguably the worst cat related media to ever exist and I watched Cats (2019)

**Uberpigeon** (10): If Sometimes has million number of fans i am one of them . if sometimes has ten fans i am one of them. if sometimes have only one fan and that is me . if sometimes has no fans, that means i am no more on the earth . if world against the sometimes, i am against the world. i love sometimes till my last breath.. .. Die Hard fan of sometimes. (I UNIRONICALLY LOVE THIS SONG. I THOUGHT IT WAS A CUTE AND FUNNY AND CLEVER AND KITSCHY ADDITION TO THE ALBUM.)

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): look you either get it or you don’t idk what to say

#Camp(fire) Queens

**apatel27** (10): It's cute

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh god take me to the Kero Kero Bonito campfire singalong please!

**cremeebrulee** (10): manifesting extremely negative and wicked energy toward popheads rate community. i have spent 2 months secretly thinking terrible thoughts about the popheads rate community in the hopes it will cause them grievous or fatal harm for eliminating this on day 1. my “popheads rate community manifestation journal” is now 54 pages in length

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): elephant 6 vibes, sorry it’s just so funny

**freav** (10): the only song on the album to truly understand and embrace twee, and it is a beautiful thing, im a sicko for that parallel minor chord change too

**homestarguy** (10): POV: You are at the world’s most blessed campfire

**reput4tionera** (10): this song will probably be first out but it’s so campfirey and fun y’all hate fun don’t you

**runaway3212** (10): WE ALL LOVE IN A YELLOW SUBMARINE HEY

**sage** (10): this always makes me wanna cry for some reason

**Stryxen** (10): this is gonna be bottom 5 and for what?? Just because it sounds bad doesn't mean it IS bad

**bogo** (9): idc what y'all think this is charming as hell. yes it does sound like a campfire singalong, that's a feature not a bug. what's your point here

**zukomu** (9): sure, why not?

**TiltControls** (8.5): It feels a little thrown together, but I think it works perfectly with the song

**plastichaxan** (8): This is gonna be so robbed knowing popheads ugh

**welcome2thejam** (8): Works best live when you're part of the gang vocals

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): KKB does the Beatles on a toy piano

**vayyiqra** (7): I get it, it's ironic. It's singing about the happy days coming soon, but the album is not happy. Doesn't make the song good, but I like the concept. I dig it. Nobody asked for a KKB acoustic singalong either but here we are. It's not that bad. If it had different lyrics it'd be unbearable, but the faux-60s sunshine-pop-but-not-really sound is alright here.

**imbaby122** (6.5): i would never bet on my fuzzy hot pink 6 inch platform boots…

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): this isn’t a Britney cover wtf

#Sometimes... life gets you down

**jasannn** (6): it gives me annoying aunt who wants to know too much about your life

**pig-serpent** (5): It's a cute diversion from the album but like

**thedoctordances1940** (4.9): ew

**jman457** (4.8): This was kind of cheesy

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): sarah come home

**seanderlust** (3.5): this borders so closely on "don't be depressed :( be happy! :) smile! :)" territory

**a-man-with-a-perm** (3): did Noah and the Whale write this

**camerinian** (3): weird amount of inspiration from kids’ music in this rate

**CrimsonROSET** (3): imagine there’s no heaven

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Camp counsellors attempting to entertain children at a bonfire

**Roxieloxie** (3): why the fuck did they go full house

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): huh

**indie\_fan\_** (2): middle school campfire ass song

**fadedblue09** (1.5): Oh no guys why the sudden acoustic moment

**flava** (1.5): it’s nice they broke their aesthetic for a minute or two, but this pub singalong moment doesn't capture the warmth the best of those do

**Awkward\_King** (0): if kkb sung this song live i think id throw a tomato

**dream\_fighter2018** (0): this is a primary school singalong song. Super cacophonous, and annoying as fuck.

**freeofblasphemy** (0): You know that scene in Scrubs where J.D. imagines Dr. Cox picking up Colin Hay’s guitar and smashes it to pieces?

**impla77** (0): sounds like something I sang at primary school

**moonagenightmares** (0): ok…

**NFLfreak98** (0): nice of them to put a song from their friend's bedroom pop quartet on the album but maybe next time they can do their own promotion

**starla\_** (0): interludephobia

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (0): Irrational Hate 0 rewarded to Sometimes, the kind of cut that makes SuperOrganism's horseshit bombast look legitimately earnest. Again, when this album is presented as a twee, I often refute it, because KKB feel too advanced in their sound palette, topics, and strive towards meta. This here is the kind of thing that sorta kneecaps the righteous flow of the album for camp's sake. no guys, you don't have to waste your time with this. don't. stop it. get help. go to K records and record with calvin if you want to earn doing this kind of shit.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): contrary to popular opinion, I think the dissonance between the lyrics and the chaotic production here is cool! It feels like the acoustic equivalent of a panic attack, but if panic attacks made me dance.

**Uberpigeon** (8): im relaxing instead of making a thoughtful host comment today

#Streaming RELAXER by alt-j!!

**altleftover** (10): I crashed when I first heard this song in the car

**frogaranaman** (10): the way I can't relax during this song

**fadedblue09** (9): This is very WTF but I would be lying if I said some parts didn't go off

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I like the dramatic irony of this song and how they tell you to relax whilst assaulting you with stressful noises, it’s nice sonic storytelling.

**Stryxen** (9): this album is really so feel good, idk why the idea of this going out day 1 is already making me kinda sad 😭 it doesn't deserve this set up

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): im having a hard time explaining why im giving these a good scores at this point but idc they're valid

**welcome2thejam** (8): For some reason her voice really works for me here

**plastichaxan** (7.5): Don’t tell me what to do

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): the studio must’ve not been as soundproof as they thought

**homestarguy** (7): I think Timothy Leary would likely approve.

**celladonn** (6.5): i like the contrast of the disorienting and stressful sound with the lyrics about relaxing but I still find the sound disorienting and stressful

**freav** (6.5): nothing verses with a formulaicly cool chorus

**impla77** (6.3): another more chill song

**imbaby122** (6): the vine boom would fit right in on this track

**zukomu** (6): mid song, good advice imo

#You need to calm down

**NFLfreak98** (5.3): the vocals tell me to relax, everything else about the song tells me to have a panic attack

**a-man-with-a-perm** (5): Stolen Frankie Goes to Hollywood valour

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Oh god this album is kind of fumbling the bag at the finish line.

**bogo** (5): meh. not as atrocious as the rest of the album, still not good.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this isn’t relaxing

**runaway3212** (5): girl I hate her

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): Frankie Goes to Hollywood found with their wigs tightly in place

**starla\_** (4.5): this song feels unnecessary

**reput4tionera** (4): how is this album so overstimulating yet so boring

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i dont think i can relax when you’re playing car alarms and tires squeaking in my ear and giving me mini panic attacks

**seanderlust** (3.5): sound effects here feel like 745 sticky by 100 gecs but way less fun

**camerinian** (3): it’s actually a very funny bit to tell me to just relax while the beat makes me feel seasick

**vayyiqra** (3): ENOUGH CHEWING SOUNDS. I thought this was going to be an almost okay song but this is yet another bullshit song full of quirky guitar riffs, random samples of noises, bored vocals, meaningless lyrics, it's very far from helping me relax. I am very keyed up! This album is getting on my nerves a lot! Haha they made a reference to drugs haha so random XD

**freeofblasphemy** (2.5): Uhhh I’ll relax when this is all over

**Awkward\_King** (2): this one sounds like you pitched down a kkb song (derogatory)

**heysoupie** (2): I HATE when songs have sirens/honks/etc. I wasn’t even driving when I was listening and I STILL jumped when the honking happened. The whole vibe of this song is like when you’re really stressed and someone tells you to calm down. It doesn’t work. It makes things worse. Is that the point? I also am so grossed out by the liquid/mouth noises.

**TiltControls** (2): I don't think I can while listening to everything going on with this song

**akanewasright** (1.5): This is mostly fine but I *hate* when people used car horns in songs, ESPECIALLY since it pans between the ears… like that stuff triggers a bit of a fight or flight in me

**indie\_fan\_** (1): The lyrics scream out "happiness and joy" while the production screams "despair and agony"

**just\_thonking** (1): I can't relax with all those car horns going off

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (1): don't fucking tell me what to do if all you know is how to play ONE guitar note in that same fucking tuning. this entire album seriously devalues the guitar down to one godawful sound. pathetic. HATE THE CAR SOUDNS HEAR AS WELL. AGITPROP EVIL.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): let me pretend to be shocked that an almost entirely instrumental, early vaporwave-esque meandering 4 minute track is the first MGMT cut

**Uberpigeon** (0): This song is such a slog to me. The only days this got away from were day 2 and 3.

**starla\_** (9): this is like Ariel Pink without the MAGA bullshit

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): is this lounge

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (9): BIG city nights getting woozy out at my house boat baybee! like forreal I'll take this "almost white dub instrumental" that helps turn around the near-rut caused by James. this is the sound of a comf isolation.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): It’s kinda giving, like, Ewok acid trip, but I’m into that

**imbaby122** (8): groovyy

**welcome2thejam** (8): I have entered a digital world where interludephobia is non-existent

**jman457** (7.8): This just feels like a lazy sunday

**moonagenightmares** (7.5): not bad for a mostly-instrumental

**Stryxen** (7): a relative miss

**freav** (6.9): yeah the album gets less exciting here, this tune is better than i remember though!

**freeofblasphemy** (6.5): Fuck I kinda embrace how willfully limited this is

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): this could have been fleshed out into a better song but the vibes are neat

**impla77** (6.4): vibey little instrumental

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6): Producer: look fellas this is a MGMT album ya need at one least one song that might piss them off but like, subtly

**akanewasright** (6): This could’ve been shorter, but it’s nice

#They can't keep getting away with it!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): More like the slay that got away. Some nice instrumentation tho.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): it’s kinda giving water level

**destroyallhumans2** (6): kinda gets away too much

**homestarguy** (6): The “Shaggy, that isn’t weed” moment of the album.

**reput4tionera** (6): i am not trying to tank this album i swear to god it is just not clicking for me. i understand that it is good but like at least it’s not superorganism

**vayyiqra** (6): It's like fine but it doesn't go anywhere. This one really -is- unearned!

**plastichaxan** (5.5): Okay this is actually one of the best here maybe they should sing less

**heysoupie** (5.2): sounds like my seasonal affective disorder :\\\

**flava** (5): this mostly instrumental track doesn't really do much for me

**thedoctordances1940** (4.8): coming back to this i'm liking this a lot less than i remember and i really do not know why. Like it's got a really nice psychedelic chillwave vibe essentially which i feel like i should really like but I just don't particularly like this

**celladonn** (4): Song That Doesn't Slay

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): katy outsold

**runaway3212** (3): this is like an interlude that's 4 minutes long

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): ??

**Awkward\_King** (1): why exactly

**fadedblue09** (0): Listening to "James" made me go "could they get any more boring?" and then this song came right after. Kudos for proving me wrong i guess

#Boss Babes

**runaway3212** (10): tree paine ily

**imbaby122** (8): my manager was great this year. and it’s a 10 if my job promotes me to manager next year

**vayyiqra** (8): Here I'm taking this word to mean "the act of managing an organization itself" in which case that's boring but very important. I get that manag-ers- are often obnoxious dicks or just incompetent, but that's a flaw that's inherent to any position of power. Still without being managed well we couldn't get much done and that applies to any organization, not just businesses, so I have to give the concept of management a good score out of respect for that. Having a feeling it will be tanked though because of bad associations and I get that.

**Awkward\_King** (6): i have complaints to make

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): kinda sucks but also, try doing stuff without one

**reput4tionera** (6): yass clairo

**1998tweety** (5): what

#See me in my office.

**freav** (5): not a fan

**frogaranaman** (5): my manager is actually pretty cool

**heysoupie** (5): have you ever taken a management class? Like…i wish i could get the hours wasted reading Wall Street Journal and taking Meyers-Briggs tests back.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I’ve been lucky to have good bosses in my life but not everyone is.

**jasannn** (4): i like my new direct manager but not a big fan of the general manager

**a-man-with-a-perm** (3): booooooo why are there some many of you and why is our front-line staff so understaffed??? you asked us for feedback on what our business should do in future and acknowledged the phrase 'the best' being in big writing but not 'more pay' that was equal size and right next door

**pig-serpent** (3): My bosses have all been pretty good but in general management kind of sucks and I'd never want to do it.

**whizzer0** (3): oh my god just let people do things (okay but at least I can see the idea here a little more than cannibalism and self-titled albums)

**amr** (2): neutral really

**dream\_fighter2018** (2): I am unmanageable

**Stryxen** (2): the clairo song is good. managers….. vomit emoji

**TiltControls** (2): I had to take a couple MGMT courses... sorry managementees but I was not a fan

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): do you think people will look back on this time and think that we lived in the dark ages?

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**nt96** (7): I was lied to. The Dark Ages did in fact, have sunlight

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6): well aktshully recent historiography doesn't designate the time period as the Dark Ages anymore and it's quite a Western-centric phrase and uh...idk I thought the medieval n early modern history students were nerds compared to us modern history students. Total jocks.

#Pox-Ridden Peasants

**bogo** (5): overrated age in history

**frogaranaman** (5): pov you don't know history and are without electricity: this is literally the dark ages rn

**jasannn** (5): idk history

**jman457** (5): it really fell off; Renaissance outsold

**welcome2thejam** (5): Eh, I've seen darker

**celladonn** (4): overhated but they still flopped

**destroyallhumans2** (4): too dark :(

**imbaby122** (4): i used to be obsessed but ewwwwwwwww

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): seemed bad, but idk I wasn't there

**freav** (3): scary

**pig-serpent** (3): "The ‘Dark Ages’ were between the 5th and 14th centuries, lasting 900 years. The timeline falls between the fall of the Roman Empire and the Renaissance. It has been called the ‘Dark Ages’ because many suggest that this period saw little scientific and cultural advancement. However, the term doesn’t stand up to much scrutiny - and many medieval historians have dismissed it."

**Stryxen** (3): I fell asleep in history during my medicine in the dark ages chapter

**seanderlust** (2): there was very little slay from this period. except the slaying of dragons. but dragons are really cool so we kind of lost out there.

**slimboyfriend** (2): When I think of the dark ages I think of Europe suddenly getting really dumb and forgetting how indoor plumbing works and just living and eating and breathing in their own feces for like a thousand years

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): people died

**vayyiqra** (2): While not outright repulsive like some things here, most historians today I think would argue the concept of "the Dark Ages" is quite bogus and doesn't make much sense, and is something that we came up with in the modern era to smear this time in history as having nothing interesting happen during it. The modern belief that the early medieval period was nothing but ignorance, violence, disease and so on isn't accurate and also is rather Eurocentric (mainly it exists because of classicists hyping up the Roman Empire and thinking that after it fell Europe must have become a shithole). Bad concept, not very useful. Just call it "early Middle Ages" or something.

**whizzer0** (2): whenever I see some medieval-based media I am thinking "you could have set this in literally any other time/space period and it would be way cooler"

**akanewasright** (1): not a very nice time to live

**apatel27** (1): Islamic Golden Age outsold

Reading about many historical famines where this happened (a lot of them seem to be in Russia and China) was quite harrowing! Also if you must, at least don't eat brains, you can get an incurable prion disease and will die.

**SPrawnxen** (10): such unbelievably high concept experimental art pop

**FreePrawnAnyone** (9): rock lobster levels of camp

**Prawnaway3212** (9): i love crustaceans

**Prawnderlust** (8.5): ok I don't know what i'm giving this yet but the spotify animation of a prawn driving a jeep gets my 11

**Prawn-serpent** (8): I have a friend who was obsessed with this song and mentioned it to me a lot.

**Prawnchaxan** (8): Finally some good food

**impPrawn77** (7.6): fair assessment tbh

**destroyallPrawns2** (7): i wish i could be a lil tasty fella

**Prawnson\_Marguerite** (7): being a rock lobster outsold

**thisusernameisntPrawn** (7): is this chiptune

**jPrawn457** (6.8): A lovely little tribute to shrimpy

**imPrawn122** (6.5): how many prawns do you have to eat before you make your skin turn pink

**Prawnrinian** (6): children’s music rate when

**cellaPrawn** (6): a bit overly quirky

**Prawnsoupie** (6): fun. Reminds me of that “snail time” video. Really appreciate that they pronounce the word “prawn” as one (drawn out) but relatively normal syllable. Cannot imagine how hideously LEG would pronounce it.

#Prawn

**thePrawndances1940** (5.4): ok

**a-man-with-a-Prawn** (5): God the Superorganism formula gets exhausting after this point

**aPrawn27** (5): You will never be KKB

**homestarPrawn** (5): You tellin me a prawn fried this song???

**PrawnControls** (5): with a little altering this could be a parappa song

**akanewasPrawn** (4): I feel like I’d like this more if it wasn’t taking up 3 minutes of my time… like this could be a goofy minute-long interlude and I could see myself giving it a 7 but it stretches the joke too far

**BleepBloopPrawnFan** (4): Wtf is a prawn? *Googles* Oh this bitch is ugly.

**Prawn\_fighter2018** (4): this falls apart as soon as the chorus hits, if that hadn’t happened I would’ve honestly 10-ed this.

**Prawn4tionera** (4): i am not enjoying this album

**Prawnzzer0** (4): is it me or has this album kinda dropped off...

**Prawnfreak98** (3.7): i feel trapped

**Prawna\_** (3.5): I'm allergic to prawns

**PrawnOnMeByA-ha** (3): if you told me that this was a viral video a random person on youtube made in 2011 when “l0l so rAnDoM XD” humor was still a big thing i’d believe you

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (2.5): oh christ on a cracker here's a total dead end of an idea, even with her "packing a fat lipper" on the bubble sounds. fizzled bubblegum bass with the vaguest itches of dub. it keeps rushing for the most goddamn annoying chorus it can warble. it just lingers in a cracked out drug state that is anything BUT bliss. Orono's no-frills mumble bleh style just cannot sell this bop. to top it off, the video is too flippant and again, finds the band driving me MAD with their 2k10s era cartoon network "shit for brains" aesthetic. its cuts like this that make me thank god mag bay arrived to salvage extremely online music and music videos. i went and watched the tiny desk for just a hot second and the image of all EIGHT of their lil' bodies squeezed in to that desk hurt me. they are all flight risks

**CrimsonPrawn** (2): like I love nihilism but I’m allergic to seafood

**Prawn\_thonking** (2): Corny and dumb

**Prawniqra** (2): HOW MANY SHRIMPS DO YOU HAVE TO EAT? I can't shake the feeling this band is like "what if KKB and trying to be wacky and Very Online, but more indie, but much less good" and them having a song about crustaceans is not helping with that impression you know? I said that KKB seems to think "things being fuzzier makes them better" on Time'n'Place but Superorganism's "things being wackier makes them better". Repeating "prawn" a lot and sampling a nature documentary or something, how outré of them! End me. Thank the good lord above this album is short, I can't take much more of this.

**welcome2thePrawn** (2): How many prawn do you have to eat, before you make your skin turn like a bluish-grey or white

**Prawngo** (1): this literally sounds like something ajr would make

**Prawnofblasphemy** (1): Ugh fuck this

**Prawn\_fan\_** (0): I cannot find a single thing redeemable about this song, just pain

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): it was really generous of the queens rosa and jenny to give the leggers a new ringtone… also the fact that this outlasted several FULL songs in this rate, iconic

**Uberpigeon** (7): this other stupid ass song tanking legs average i love it

---

#Sneakers
**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Sneaking around on your tiptoes ass music.

**indie\_fan\_** (5): This is very much giving Tom & Jerry Tip Toe Music

**pig-serpent** (7): Cartoon walking music

#Hotline Bling


**camerinian** (10): wait is this the smasha

**cremeebrulee** (10): it's more like missed call (87) (i have helicopter parents)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): iconic dipshit glee music. The Mark Mothersbaughprint. So this is Devo by proxy

**Hulnia** (10): so true

**plastichaxan** (10): I need to help my girls

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): more like Missed Call (10) because once my mom starts calling she just doesn't stop

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I’m on Neopets.com, I’m playing in the Fairy Caves

**Stryxen** (9): genuinely really good…and yes it's better than Whitewater… I really think this can get the win I'm just not 11ing it cos that would be too easy an 11 win lol

**dream\_fighter2018** (8.5): setting this as my ringtone

**fadedblue09** (8.5): A breath of fresh air after two vocally grating tracks

**akanewasright** (8): Fuck it we love being put on hold


**freav** (8): true

**freeofblasphemy** (8): Ding ding fun!

**heysoupie** (8): it’s giving GBBO

**nt96** (8): Laughing and not being on call

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (7.5): this is the definition of a "fun" interlude! now that's an idea executed. is it needed? not terribly. but its fun! they made me a ringtone. sweet.

**Awkward\_King** (7): this is great bc it means snakes and ladders is ending

**just\_thonking** (7): Why are we even rating this

**Roxieloxie** (7): this is the best song yet

**runaway3212** (7): wii music winning another rate???

**jman457** (6.7): This was pretty, but also probably could have been better if were an intro of a longer song

**bogo** (6): it's only a short interlude but it's cute

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): please don’t put numbers in your song title you’re setting yourself up

**seanderlust** (6): feels like being on hold but in a slay way

**vayyiqra** (6): Interludephobia do your thing I guess. This is fine but also it's 47 seconds long, so why is it here? To be quirky I guess? Pizzicato strings are almost a universal trope for quirky; that must be it.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5.5): cute ringtone

#Cold Callers

**starla\_** (5.5): she's an interlude

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): yeah not much going on here is there but i don't really want to properly tank it so my average for leg still remains good

**Uberpigeon** (6): I would make a joke about hypno and creme being small, but I’m gonna be the bigger person here.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.4): yeah this is far and away my least favourite song in the rate, it’s just absolutely boring, if I was going to give a 0 this rate it would’ve been for this song

---

#6'

**runaway3212** (10): when you're [insanely low baritone]

**Stryxen** (10): this is so hopeless and melancholic but it kinda fills me with hope and i love it . Like the song version of staring at the wall in silence for a few days and then feeling better

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bfyS-S-IJs

**flava** (9): I guess it would be easy to write this off as "successful act complains about success" but, maybe somewhere in its soothing atmosphere comes some comfort from having a community around you. A comforting feeling that MGMT can only find themselves recalling

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Genius.com seems to think that this is about being famous but honestly I think it works better just as a metaphor for a state of being… like I sure as hell know what it’s like to feel small and resigned to helplessness and this really captures it.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.8): this song is the argument against Everybody Wants to Be Famous

**starla\_** (8.5): this is a ballad sung by men...out on day 1 I fear

**jman457** (8.2): Im a slut for some strings

**bogo** (8): this is cute

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I’ll probably revise this comment before the rate is due because it’s clearly about feeling inferior and not setting high expectations and this whole rate is very introspective but all my brain can think of is big spoon little spoon

**seanderlust** (8): I know that "famous people complaining about being famous" can feel like an overused concept for music, but I feel like this song articulates the downside of being relatively obscure and hugely popular in a way that makes sense and in a way that a lot of people can empathize with

**freav** (7.5): you can hear the grandaddy influence here and this is not as good as them but I'll take it

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (7.5): Rating this against Tame Impala, I dubbed it "better kevin parker stuff". def would rather listen to this than the kevin parker catalog. It's a comedown cut  that just casually sets things up for a stupidly pleasant "by-the-books" back half. Again, I get the sense that Left and Right MGMT seriously have a sturdy grip on exactly WHAT they want to do; just makes me feel like a lil' blip even with corny ass horsehit lyrics. I have to applaud that even if it ain't grabbing me like others.

**1998tweety** (7): ive been big and small and big and small and big and small again

**vayyiqra** (7): bet this 1) ballad 2) with two men singing 3) and acoustic guitar 4) that sounds like a Beatles song 5) will do amazingly on Pop heads dot com


**freeofblasphemy** (6.5): This album needs to vibe out more like this does

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6): When you're 5ft 11' on a dating app

**destroyallhumans2** (6): for all the short kings out there

**just\_thonking** (6): Me when I'm small

**reput4tionera** (6): cute

#5'11

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.5): do NOT give men an acoustic guitar.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): “when you’re small you’re not very big at all” every 60 seconds a minute passes

**akanewasright** (5): there’s a joke here but I don’t feel like making it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): this one is sadly like a very boring version of a better Grandaddy song, but stream Grandaddy - Sophtware Slump

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): there’s a temptation to make a Hypno short joke here

**homestarguy** (5): This is a fetish thing, right?

**imbaby122** (5): kinda chill in a boring way

**impla77** (5): this song taught me big is the opposite of small

**TiltControls** (5): The production and lyrics are good but I just wish that the vocal had something to match that

**welcome2thejam** (5): Little Dark Side of the Moon

**fadedblue09** (4): Pretty sure Piglet from Winnie the Pooh has sung a song like this and I'm also sure he did it better

**heysoupie** (4): what it sounds like in my brain when I realize I am TOO high

**pig-serpent** (3): "Something" by The Beatles meets "In the Meantime" by Spacehog only far worse than either of those songs.

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): im small and petty and scoring this boring ass song very low also on a totally unrelated topic I love eating rice

**Awkward\_King** (2): they really going hit miss hit miss

**TheQueenofVultures** (1.5): really puts things in perspective

#4'11

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): and that’s what music is supposed to do!

**Uberpigeon** (6): Titling their song this is just ASKING for it. This one actually surprises me whenever I listen to it that it’s kind of boppy, and who doesn't love a bit of nihilsm? Well, A lot of people, it turns out.

---

#Carers

**flava** (11): somewhere in the cute sneeze sample. The psychedelic freedom that comes from this song is beautiful as Orono almost mournfully sings nobody cares before it becomes an anthem. Nobody cares indeed

**camerinian** (10): this is one of the best spots on the album where the ideas actually seem to really coalesce into a brilliant space. All the **zany** percussion elements really do clash with the lyrical conceit in the best way, like yeah fuck it, build the song around a sneeze, who cares. The vocals kicking in on the second verse with the softer production is a hell of a moment too.

**freav** (10): look all the other bands got some 10s from me so here is my treat for the organism

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): raters to Superorganism ha ha got em

**nt96** (9): the reason why my rate ideas keep flopping

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): this is joyful nihilism

**starla\_** (8.5): I love this but don't really have anything to say about it

**Stryxen** (8.5): an aimless meandering mess (complimentary)

**imbaby122** (8.1): baby sneeze at the end was traumatizing (i work at a carousel museum)

**1998tweety** (8): me to my sister when she tells me a random BTS fact

**celladonn** (8): something oddly comforting about this

**pig-serpent** (8): *Frankjavcee voice* I do

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.5): a collection of sounds!

**Awkward\_King** (7): this is better than the baby queen song i hate to say it

**destroyallhumans2** (7): good messaging!

**homestarguy** (7): Me when someone on here says “Little Dark Age” stinks.

**plastichaxan** (7): Can’t wait for all the comments of people saying the title is about this album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LQoN7DtLX8

**CrimsonROSET** (6): honestly this is actually a technique I use really often because I have had my super anxious main protag eras of ‘but what will they think’ and I then I realized everyone just wants to get to the next day so this song would have been helpful if it sounded different

#Nobodies

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This really hits when I’m feeling moody, but unfortunately I feel good today.

**seanderlust** (6): you know that piece of fashion advice that's like "look in the mirror and take one accessory off before leaving the house"? I feel like some songs on this album need that. there's so much going on and it doesn't feel super cohesive

**jman457** (5.8): I kind of dont care for this song

**a-man-with-a-perm** (5.5): did...they sneeze on me?

**freeofblasphemy** (5.5): Definitely more interesting than the first couple tracks but still feels bored with itself

**reput4tionera** (5): i don’t care for this song lol

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): but who asked?

**vayyiqra** (5): That's quite enough chewing sounds! Why is this band always eating celery or something? This album must be a nightmare for anyone with misophonia. Anyway this is mid and kind of boring so someone insert a "nobody cares about this song" joke here. Pitchfork called this brilliant, I don't care about their opinion so whatever but that was surprising because I don't see anything that stands out about this song other than the novelty factor.

**akanewasright** (4): I can hear the potential but [keala settle outsold](https://youtu.be/RGZNejHu9E0)

**runaway3212** (4): this is sooooo fucking true omfg follow me for more life insights

**TiltControls** (4): there's an easy joke to make here

**impla77** (3.4): this hurt my ears

**bogo** (3): congratulations, guys, you made a song that wasn't totally unbearable! this still isn't good at all, the sneeze in particular is dumb

**indie\_fan\_** (2.5): Well they were right at least

**cremeebrulee** (2.3): [i'm trying not to make the obvious joke here](https://i.imgflip.com/1je75f.jpg)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): the drop in this is actually painful to listen to


**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (2): Again, I don't think Orono is at any fault on this album. Her "im inspired by pavement" delivery is by-the-books but endearing. It deserves instrumentals that don't sound like cartoon network ad bumps that play during the umpteenth marathon of Teen Titans Go. There is SO little meat on the bone with this cut; it just flops around in wonky dipshit vibe mode. This is a fact made more apparent when about 85 seconds into the song it decides to (save this shit for the sneeze enthusiast forms) fucking sneeze on me (AND DOES IT AGAIN)--a kind of sound system test that more or less indicates that all this band CAN do is make "diy" shite sound colossal (and tacky!) on a sound system but actively don't have songs; they shoulda just shatted on me tbh. when orono talks about "growing up" I too, want the superorganism audience to grow up, go to bandcamp dot com, and purchase literally any tape from Orange Milk or Hausu Mountain. those guys make wild ass pop.

**Stryxen** (10): an entirely failed experiment but the nerve this takes… wow

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): it is :)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): When you listen to this album, drop the irony poisoning, and let yourself appreciate it for what it is.

**celladonn** (9): this has such a cool warped sound and captures a specific feeling really well

**flava** (9): waking up to a cool little experience as the lead singer takes us throughout her day featuring interplay from some British life coach or something. Somewhere in the glitches and contortion there is empowerment as the song breaks at the sides trying to free itself from the dullness that depression can give you

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): I do tell myself that

**whizzer0** (9): why is this so fun

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is very stimulating

**impla77** (8.1): love glitchy chorus

**nt96** (8): another "I'm 17" comment?

**jman457** (7.8): its a bit catchy

**imbaby122** (7.7): ok so this is just a kkb variant

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): A great mission statement for the album, sonically it’s a bit grating but it works great in context.

**homestarguy** (7.5): I do dig those slinky guitars. Absolutely goofy vocal samples lol.

**starla\_** (7.5): this sounds like the Avalanches

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): this is like a quietly menacing Saturday morning cartoon block

**jasannn** (7): sounds like psychedelic trip scene in a movie

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6.5): that's a sludgy sticky opener huh? Stick some bored vocals over the top and you got a mid opening track

**TiltControls** (6.5): When everything comes together for the chorus the whole song kinda falls apart for me. The verses are killer though

**seanderlust** (6.2): I think I get what this is going for but tbh it feels a little scattered. sampling tony robbins in the middle of this song is hilarious though

**camerinian** (6): i kinda like this as a sonic thesis statement for what Superorganism are, but it’s also such a proof of concept, like concept art that you keep as a bonus for the diehards, maybe not a career opener

#See: Thread Title

**CrimsonROSET** (6): what the fuck


**heysoupie** (5.5): i don’t think i’ve ever heard this band but at the same time if someone told me i’d listened to them a lot in the past (maybe even on purpose.) i’d probably also believe that. The epitome of mid & yet I feel obligated to rate it higher than mid on the previous tracks because the vocals are…less grating.

**pig-serpent** (5): Honestly a pretty mediocre album opener but it has a few hints of what makes this band good.

**Roxieloxie** (5): i mean i guess the vocals are better than leg 

**vayyiqra** (5): The whiplash between LEG and this song is very funny! I need to turn this up because it's weirdly quiet. Ironically it has alarm clock sounds yet it's the least rousing thing ever. I guess the singalong chorus is okay. This is the first time their chewing and crunching mouth sounds show up I think and sadly it's far from the last. KKB did the "alarm clock waking up opening track" concept way better on Bonito Generation (I am once again asking you to do the rate next month) but this is bearable I guess. Not an all-timer by any means but a workable ditty.

**freeofblasphemy** (4.5): So i guess I had heard this a few times before? Uh, it’s pretty annoying

**cremeebrulee** (4.3): this is dall·e generated, i don't know of what but . a human did not make this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this is what i’d imagine being high on lcd feels like

**NFLfreak98** (3.5): kids variety show-core

**reput4tionera** (3): kind of hated the low pitched voice

**bogo** (2): no it's not, go back to sleep orono

**indie\_fan\_** (2): Jesus that "IIIIITTTTSSSSSSS AAAAAAALLLLLLL GOOOOOOOD" is extremely unpleasant

**moonagenightmares** (2): this is an awful opening

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (1.8): I put the CD in my car and I try my damndest "okay let's see what they achieved". What I hear is a piece of barely functional, witless pop. The intro is a samplepedia clusterfuck of nonsense that conforms to by the numbers xmu-core pop. that's fine. Orono clearly has an unfettered one-take magic energy to the delivery, but I feel like KKB already made a better version of this song's lyric set up. And then we get to the chorus and I sorta realize "wow, this is painfully online Animal Collective for kids who are too scared to hear Strawberry Jam" christ its not psychedelic; its sonic terrorism. As the song goes on, the other brief moments of strange haptic ephemera only help to reinforce that they don't have this vibe locked down, they're just painfully online

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): up until the rate, this was the only song I didn’t have saved from TnP, it never really connected with me, mostly because of the last half, and I didn’t quite get what they were going for. Revisiting it now, I can appreciate it more, but I’m still not particularly upset or surprised to see it finish up here.

**Uberpigeon** (8): Yeah I get why this didn’t do well. It’s an decent closer for the album but it’s not a big grand finale like donnie darko and the noisy section isn’t anything crazy.

---

#Well Rested

**bogo** (10): yeah just add a noisy guitar breakdown in there, why not. embrace the chaos kkb

**pig-serpent** (10): Oh another one of the boring song HAHA JK LOSER IT'S ONLY ACTING AGAIN ENJOY YOUR NOISE ROCK (No seriously I do enjoy the noise rock, I think KKB is much better at it than anything else they've done even with as much as I love their earlier pop songs like Flamingo and Trampoline I just want them to make a full album in this lane please.)

**plastichaxan** (10): I don’t know how to explain that this has latina ballad vibes for a moment but also it’s such a powerful closer wow

**reput4tionera** (10): hearing this song for the first time was a TRIP

**Stryxen** (10): this was my 5th most played song of 2021. I don't know what that was about

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): Sarah’s sweet airy singing against what sounds like the gates of hell is so me vibes

**homestarguy** (9.5): Civilisation 0.5

**runaway3212** (9): more like rest flop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this song is amazing but when i was listening to it on youtube and the song ended it immediately cut to the AAA insurance rickroll ad and that was quite possibly the funniest moment to ever happen to me while doing a rate

**impla77** (8.7): love a two parter. Gets scary😮‍💨

**starla\_** (8.5): I love cling clang noises

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): incredible how Sarah Bonito still has a career in singing after she transformed into static noise on this song

**jman457** (8.2): I like the off nature of this song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.2): sleep is for the weak

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): who else is gonna give you this fantasy

**seanderlust** (8): the back half of this where it feels like distorted found footage of a tomodachi life song absolutely rules.

**vayyiqra** (8): Here the random fuzz and bleeps works really well. Why does it work for me here but not elsewhere? Idk. Maybe it's the pan flutes. I love when KKB use those, don't ask me to explain why; I already said in my comment for "When the Fires Come". The ending of the song is underwhelming but since the point of the album is leave you in a :barrelcat: state it does work for that.

**zukomu** (8): I like it when there are a lot of sounds

**thedoctordances1940** (7.3): it's not far from great but there's something missing

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.2): nctcore

**1998tweety** (7): this is WILD

**celladonn** (7): the way it cuts out like that at the end i'm shaking

**imbaby122** (7): this sounds like background music for one of those freaky youtube videos that are usually staged but you still feel like you definitely shouldn’t be watching it and are too scared to sleep with the lights off afterwards

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): the intro has me feeling like I’m walking into a mysterious man’s cottage for a curious quest

**cremeebrulee** (6.3): you know i see the vision but this could go a little harder ngl. here's what i'm thinking: we're at this isolated rest stop but how about we can amp up the apocalyptic vibes a bit? of course, you need more runtime to explain that so maybe we can add like 4ish minutes to really flesh that out... and maybe sarah could sing in japanese for a bit in the beginning. oh oh oh and then maybe add some running water at the end just to really top it off!! that would really push this to an 11

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Funny how the last song was called “Swimming” and now the mix is drowning.

#Rest stop the count

**freav** (6): i think the gimmickier aspects of the record are not super for me

**freeofblasphemy** (6): There’s so much to potentially hate about this song and it seems designed to frustrate, which is hateable in its own right. Nonetheless, I begrudgingly admire it’s audacit

**welcome2thejam** (6): Did Superorganism write the second half

**akanewasright** (5): I have 14 plays of this song and I still do not know how I feel about it

**CrimsonROSET** (5): where’s the radio cut

**TiltControls** (5): is this rest stop located in silent hill?

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (5): mid ending. feels incomplete. i can respect the mission but no.

**Awkward\_King** (4): sure

**indie\_fan\_** (4): Girl you coulda just cut the song halfway through

**fadedblue09** (3): Is that a helicopter…Cher Lloyd did it better i fear

**heysoupie** (3): stunned that this song was full length when i revisited for the 4th? 5th? time? bc it is not memorable to me. I think i block it out bc of the annoying random sounds every time.

**just\_thonking** (3): Why not just make an actual song instead of more gimmicky stuff. It was tolerable in Only Acting but that's because there was a good song attached to it

**flava** (2.5): bold choice of the band to make the closer to include sounds that make me think i’ve accidentally walked into a construction yard

**moonagenightmares** (2): they were doing good for a whole minute. what happened

**Roxieloxie** (2): oh

**a-man-with-a-perm** (0): just keep on driving, this sound clash is roughhhhhh

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): this album has good stuff, but cuts should've been considered

#Beyonce

**CrimsonROSET** (10): sadly I could never but I always find it gutsy

**runaway3212** (10): Beyoncé - Beyoncé her best

**nt96** (9): there are many iconic self titled albums!

**seanderlust** (8): it's always risky making a self-titled album. nobody wants the album named after the band itself to be bad.

**Stryxen** (8): I'm always a little sceptical but they mostly end up slaying

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): were invented by beyoncé

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Great way to make an artistic statement, especially when they’re bad

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**a-man-with-a-perm** (7): Fine if it's your first release, outright baffling if you're a few albums deep. But, like, you have all the time in the world to make your first album - come up with a title! A good one! Make a statement!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Not very adventurous but usually a safe bet.

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): usually solid albums, but really annoying to refer to in conversation.

**frogaranaman** (7): self titled albums ONLY work in two instances - the debut album (establishing a sound, narrative, and personality to attach to the name) or near the end of one's career (establishing a closing to the narrative of your work). anytime in between is a cheap cop out

**destroyallhumans2** (6): for the number of self-titled weezer albums

**fadedblue09** (6): very original

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this score represents how many self titled albums weezer has made

**thedoctordances1940** (6): one point per self titled weezer album

**plastichaxan** (5): Mixed bag

**vayyiqra** (5): They're boring and I tend to not care for them but they are good for a debut album I guess? It depends.

**akanewasright** (4): can be cool, often meaningless

**bogo** (4): they usually can be more creative

**freav** (4): loses one point for every self titled weezer album

**Uberpigeon** (7.5): As their viral hit I thought this would go a lot further but you guys were NOT having it 💀. I thought this song was so cool when it first came out, the skip before the MIND part still hits!

**RandomHypnotica** (7): I would say i’m surprised this is their most viral hit, but it honestly sounds like a tiktok trend before it was a thing

---

#Megaminds

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Me when I do five minutes worth of Duo Lingo lessons once every two months.

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): something good for your album

**frogaranaman** (10): shoutout blonded radio

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is a “you had to be there” moment, like, this blew everybody’s mind and looking back I’m not really sure WHY; I think we were all just charmed by their eclectic sound and style, they felt really fresh back in the 2018 pop scene. It’s a fantastic debut single because it tells you everything you need to know about them… they just wanna make weird sounds that boggle your mind, and they did that! The little pause before the word “mind” in the chorus is possibly the highlight of the album.

**runaway3212** (10): incredible

**Stryxen** (10): i just love it. In a very different way to the rest of the songs i adore in this rate but I seriously adore this song

**starla\_** (9.5): slide guitar is my favourite noise

**Awkward\_King** (9): pharmacy play this whenever i pick up my meds

**destroyallhumans2** (9): legion season 3 FTW!

**imbaby122** (9): iconic tiny desk concert. my band director showed it to our class. he was kinda cunt. when he crossed his legs both feet touched the floor.

**pig-serpent** (9): I always thought this was just a better It's All Good, although I'm not sure how similar they actually are.

**seanderlust** (9): that full stop before "mind" was stuck in my head for a while

**TiltControls** (9): I don't know what it is about this one over the rest of the tracks on the album, but they struck gold here

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.2): I love M.I.N.D.in.a.box

**heysoupie** (8): gen z beck; detracting points for mouth noises

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): m-i-m-i-m-i-n-d

**jman457** (7.6): I liked the story with this

**freav** (7.5): spongebob beat

**homestarguy** (7.5): Make way, I’m in my Dr. Pepper mood.

**jasannn** (7.5): tik tok song???

**welcome2thejam** (7): Nice try, but the only four letter acronym for me is D.A.R.E.

#Minding their own business

**impla77** (6.1): doesn’t do much for me

**thedoctordances1940** (6.1): i appreciate that it's trying to do something a bit off beat but i just don't really find it that interesting

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6): hey it's another edition of Royals through Gartic Phone

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): this is black eyed peas on ambien

**NFLfreak98** (5.5): My Internal Neverending Despair

**plastichaxan** (5.5): I wish this rate had been done before cause I believe I would’ve liked a few of these songs way more when it was first pitched

**just\_thonking** (5): The album really takes a dive starting here

**sage** (4.2): that sample is so annoying

**akanewasright** (4): huh

**CrimsonROSET** (4): what is mind an acronym for

**flava** (4): this is the part of the album where you need mind-altering substances to enjoy it

**reput4tionera** (4): i only knew the tiktok part but this was unpleasant

**whizzer0** (4): I liked this at the start but the chorus kinda grated.

**freeofblasphemy** (2.5): This is like outsider music except bad

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (1.5): the enemy of quickscoping is the dreaded lag. and that absolutely asinine skip they keep coming back to completely DETERIORATES the cut. just such a colossally broken, frownie face inducing instrumental. Orono is not a bad lyricist, again doing a semi-inspired scenery-chewing character sketch shenanigan that deserves half a point. it also just deserved a competent song. Imagine you were sent this instrumental and told to sing over it. Could you do it? I would have sent a trojan virus back tbh.

**bogo** (1): this song really annoys me because the stops make me think my spotify crashed. it's also just plain annoying too

**Hulnia** (1): ew [2]

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (0): the hook would kill off a 1900s victorian child

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): im so fucking tired

**vayyiqra** (0): Just horrendous, unbearable bullshit. It's like an AI was trained to write a Superorganism song that was scientifically engineered to piss me off. The vaguely political "society, man" lyrics that don't really mean anything or have any deeper critique, with pointless references to mental illness (what is the point? is the ironic-sounding "something for your mind" some weird antipsychiatry propaganda? because that's what I took it to mean) are bad enough. We then also have to have this band's favourite tropes on top of that: irritatingly repeated phrases, dumb-sounding pitched-down vocals, more goddamn chewing noises. There is nothing good about this song. One of the worst songs I've heard in a rate all year, irredeemable trash, I hate this lmao.

=====

vayyiqra: After seeing my ranting angry comment I wrote late at night, I tried once more to find what this song's lyrics are even about and if the band has ever said so, and all I got was this:

>And then the song, which is based around a sample, is pretty simple. It doesn’t have a specific theme, it could be about anything. So I was like, “Cool. I’m going to write about anything – and everything.” I didn’t really have a specific theme in mind or anything.

Thank you Orono, very helpful!

**Uberpigeon** (8): This song taught me what a superorganism is. Popheads hates learning and hates edutainment.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): I hear the most annoying parts of superorganism on display here, the song feels like it lacks any real substance, the incessant pitched quotes in the background feel unneccesary, and there’s just so much going on to the point of absurdity

---

# O... O... O... wait a minute why is there an O in the title

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): why did they suddenly decide to hate vowels aside from o

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): literally what was the point of them removing most of the vowels of the title if theyre gonna keep the O in. sprorgnsm you will NEVER be thnks fr th mmrs by fall out boy

# I can no longer tell where one score section ends...

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): This makes me feel like a super villain on a made-for-VHS educational children’s program, wish I had more to say about it but I just think this song is so fun.

**1998tweety** (10): this chorus fucking bangs omg

**Awkward\_King** (10): the kids just cant handle experimental thats their problem

**jman457** (10): This was a trip, and catchy

**pig-serpent** (10): This band's definitive statement.  I would like them equally as much if they showed up, dropped this track, then never released anything again.


**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): “it is no longer clear where one human ends and another human begins” i didn’t sign up to hear about an Indie Human Centipede situation

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): We love a self-titled track!

**moonagenightmares** (9): i appreciate how bonkers this is

**welcome2thejam** (9): Superorganism is like those teams of misfits in movies that form a band and have their first big performance at the fundraiser to keep the community center from the hands of greedy land developers, and this is their big song, except when they play they get booed off stage and the place gets bulldozed the next day

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): lemme pause the roast session for 3 minutes this kinda bops

**flava** (8.5): when you have to be a superorganism

**starla\_** (8.5): what's this band called, sproahgunsum?

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.3): this sounds like the Magic School Bus being assimilated into the Borg

**akanewasright** (8): okay I can kinda get behind this

**apatel27** (8): Does this count as a title track

**heysoupie** (8): fun

**Stryxen** (8): Spa orgasm 😱😱😱😱😱

**imbaby122** (7.8): hey don’t speak for me i want to be a microorganism surely they don’t have all that much to worry about

**camerinian** (7.5): i wanna be a soup

**freav** (7.2): good pop song

**impla77** (7.2): Weird in a good way

#... And another begins

**CrimsonROSET** (6): super orgasm

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): and is the superorganism in the room with us right now?

**homestarguy** (6): This is their whole shtick turned up a bit too much for me in one track lol.

**reput4tionera** (6): this song was fine

**a-man-with-a-perm** (5.5): oh this is a downer after the heights off the last song - couldn't keep their hands off the bad mixing for two minutes

**whizzer0** (5): Ah, the rare self-titled title track. It's fine but a little underwhelming.

**plastichaxan** (4): I was really liking this for a minute then and they said nope let’s ruin it

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (3.3): holy shit guys, it sounds like a swamp of barely cohesive, cluttered samples all rushing to take control of the palette and failing. all the while, orono sounds like she is mumblibng her way through wishing the band makes a cohesive song.

**fadedblue09** (3): now wth

**Roxieloxie** (3): everytime i get ready to be like 'this album is not as bad as everyone was claiming it was' do some weird shit and i really start considering if this rate was a pysop

**vayyiqra** (3): Yeah this sucks, the haters were right. I thought the band's name was because they're a whole made out of many parts, but now I'm not sure they're that clever and they just thought it sounded cool and came up with that explanation afterward. The spoken word part does in fact say that, but also it's almost impossible to tell what the narration is even saying, so that doesn't work. This has all the band's tropes I can't stand: weirdly pitched vocals, bored-sounding chanting kind of vocals, noisy production that sounds like my headphones are broken, annoying overuse of repetition, and worst of all the gibberish lyrics.

**bogo** (2): is this supposed to be funny or creepy or something because it just makes me incredibly uncomfortable, especially the "now you're part of the only thing alive" and "you are me, and i am you" lines

**freeofblasphemy** (2): No


**amr** (0): those drops in the later part of the song made me wanna throw up I can't imagine the damage they'd have done if I listened to this on 100% volume

**runaway3212** (0): more like floporganism

**sage** (0): childrens choirs should absolutely never be used in music. literally the worst sounding thing ever they fill me with rage

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): always had a bit of a soft spot for this track, even if it’s the less superior song about longing after a man on this album. That plinky little piano mixed with the earnesty of the lyrics is just very sweet

**Uberpigeon** (6): I gave this a 0 and then I realised it was actually kinda nice. I love the trumpety sounds in the background

# James Earl Jones
**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): It’s so chill but also so slay.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is literally the last MGMT song i would've guessed was written on acid

**runaway3212** (10): my god I would like to fuck James

**akanewasright** (9): okay slay it French horn

**starla\_** (9): more men

**Stryxen** (9): catcry

**flava** (8.5): I knew a James in school, he was a snob and I hated him

**jasannn** (8.5): why is this name plural? is it plural for Jam or Jame? I have never met a Jam or Jame before.

**1998tweety** (8): goated discord user

**Awkward\_King** (8): i had a crush on a family friend called james when we were kids. hope youre doing ok dude.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): hilarious Magnetic Fields/Gothic Archie’s cosplay. Stream “All the Umbrellas in London” everybody

**freeofblasphemy** (8): SO FUN WHY ISN’T REST OF ALBUM LIKE THIS?

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): not ANOTHER pop song name dropping James Dean 🙄

**freav** (7.7): james

**a-man-with-a-perm** (7.5): who's laughing now when this makes day 3

**camerinian** (7): the production on this is such a vibe but I can’t get over the fact that the singing voice sounds like the Flight of the Conchords’ impression of David Bowie

**destroyallhumans2** (7): i wish i had a reliable pal named james

**homestarguy** (7): Shoutout to the French horn at least

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): jessie!

**vayyiqra** (7): "“James” is a tribute to Andrew and Ben’s close friend James Richardson, the guitarist in MGMT’s live band." Oh that's nice. : ) What a wholesome song- "In an interview with Q Magazine, members Andrew and Ben revealed that “James” was created after dropping a “micro-dose of acid” with Patrick Wimberly (Chairlift) for creative inspiration. It turned out to be a fuller dose than expected, as Andrew recalls: “I spent hours screaming at the top of my lungs about Pakistan." What?

**welcome2thejam** (7): Beautiful instrumental on the chorus especially

**jman457** (6.9): wait is this album queer coded

# James Corden

**reput4tionera** (6.5): the album is kind of blending together for me

**Roxieloxie** (6): who the fuck are all these men

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (6): This got a sonic boom remix?! cool. Cutely heartfelt lyrics for a streamlined cut. this is where we get into that delirious range of "post-captured tracks chill vibes core" that really just pervades to a nearly worthless degree. "muzak for the kimpton hotel vibe generation" still sums up my gripes with this

**seanderlust** (5.8): I tried to come up with a joke comment about singing this to a celebrity named James but the only ones I could think of were Corden and Franco so uh...i'll just leave it at "bop"

**thedoctordances1940** (5.3): just kinda a little bit boring

**impla77** (5.1): hope James liked this,that’s the important thing

**CrimsonROSET** (5): James and Michael solid as they come

**imbaby122** (4.7): dull. lacking flavor.

**heysoupie** (4): ominous, don’t like the vocals

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): No MGMT, don’t go into the Tame Impala neo-psych cave… MGMT NO!!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Imagine if your famous band friends wrote you a song, but then it sounded like this. I would just smile and nod.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): i hate songs that have vocals like this, its so monotonous its almost painful to listen to and the instrumental being pretty uninteresting doesnt do it any favors either

**fadedblue09** (1): I have never heard a song so aggressively boring in my whole life (edit: nvm see my comment for Days that Got Away)

**pig-serpent** (0): I hate the bassy drone of nonsense on this song.  If I was James I would be insulted by this tribute.

**plastichaxan** (0): This is a lot about what I hate in ~~men~~ indie music I was so bored

**Uberpigeon** (7.5): me when no one was giving us any ballots

**RandomHypnotica** (6.3): easily the weakest closer in the rate, and a really disappointing finish to the album for me, it just feels like nothing ever happens until the track is suddenly over for me, learning this was a single was a genuine surprise. It was also surprising to see just how many fans this had, but still not quite enough to get a male ballad to Day 2.

---

#Handing it to them

**a-man-with-a-perm** (11): Just ascend when the backing vocals come on the chorus, beautiful track

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): They’re talking about your elevens, people.

**Stryxen** (10): UGH I wanna 11 this so bad but this is just like top 200 favourite songs ever for me and there are multiple top like 20 favourites in this lineup >:( which door do we open… perfect closer tk one if my favourite albums ever

**flava** (9.5): and the album ends in a dreamlike fashion. Still reeling from the fact that the impossible happened in November 2016 making direct references to his presidency. It's the kinda song that feels like lying in bed tired but unable to fall asleep. But does seem to be optimistic for the future, unwilling to give into nihilism. Even if the hopes that those in power will just "hand it over" hasn't aged the best...

**moonagenightmares** (9.2): im sitting here after listening to the album in full for the first time in years and thinking how its just SO fucking solid. MGMT COME BACK

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): why is he fucking a sofa

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Honestly this was a really nice chill out song to end the rate on

**freav** (8.1): good use of "album closer chord progressions"

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (8.1): a subtle brilliant, but not outright excellent closer. the reverb and ghostly voices give it the UMPH a pleasent yet "by-the-books" instrumental you'd find at the H&M for yacht members. it can hit ya in valley heat on a drive home from work, I'll admit.

**starla\_** (8): I'm not sure what this song is about but I'm enjoying it

**impla77** (7.8): chill vibe, tight production

**homestarguy** (7.5): It pretty, what can I say?

**jman457** (7.5): If the Beach boys made a new-wave song

**CrimsonROSET** (7): fuck trump

**heysoupie** (7): groovy

**imbaby122** (7): chill in a less boring way than the last track

**cremeebrulee** (6.6): me @ SZA's second album

#Handy J's

**reput4tionera** (6.5): i did not expect this album to be over with this song

**seanderlust** (6.5): they've said that this is about the donald trump presidency, but i'm unclear exactly what is being said here. from interview tidbits I can tell they weren't happy about it, but what exactly do the lyrics mean here

**vayyiqra** (6): why does this album go from sounding like 1985 to sounding like 1970 at the end anyway good album!

**akanewasright** (5): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/873/344/ea4.gif

**runaway3212** (2): this is such a snooze

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): resident sleeper

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): yeah I get the hate for this one, the message is *extremely* unsubtle and very boomerish, and the instrumental just feels like a b-side from Random Access Memories, just very ok.

#That's our lamp!

**homestarguy** (9.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clVsLNJIahs

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (9.4): When indieheads rated this, I think either a) people missed the camp or B) people fucking hated the camp (kappy legit said "how about u write a song about time spent getting some pussy"; well put king). This is perhaps the "rosarch test" cut of the album, which legitimately determines if you A) get the weirdly bummed out tropical bliss vibe of LDA and B) dont mind that these assclowns keep writing dumb fucking pep talk cuts that sorta lowkey rip. I don't need another goddamn song about phones dude (wet leg's edition to this cursed canon is true 0 territory), but somehow this sonic palette just slaps. No band could ever make another slapper about *nancy comic voice* "phones, phones, phones" but rock on mgmt!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): We love looking at our phones! Relatable kings!

**bogo** (9): this would get a 10 if the lyrics weren't kinda stupid

**moonagenightmares** (9): the chorus makes me ascend into a higher plane of existence, unfortunate that the verses dont do much for me

**runaway3212** (9): yass phone critiques

**imbaby122** (8.7): ooo another chronically online anthem <3

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes groovy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): this could easily be insufferable and kind of is “what if phone too much” but it’s mainly focused on his own flaws so it’s kind of charming. Also they clearly well-studied 80s goth rock and 80s post punk to really break out a reggae influenced cut lol

**flava** (8.5): normally I'd be opposed to these types of technology is evil type songs but I've been addicted to my phone a lot recently so maybe it's good I hear this, also the criticism seems to be pointed just as inward as it is outward which is so much better than what Steven Wilson does. Plus the inclusion of the Spanish guitar was pretty cool

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.3): yasss Tramp Slamps

**freav** (8): i agree with this

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): the message is if you drop your phones and start talking with people you might also go all “Introducing Me” on them. maybe phones are good

**jman457** (7.2): dragged a bit

**destroyallhumans2** (7): too relatable :(

**heysoupie** (7): i feel attacked by this song

**nt96** (7): sounds like a Wham! reject

**Stryxen** (7): phones bad :gasp:

**vayyiqra** (7): Oh it's the "phone bad" song. As I said in my comment on some Superorganism song, that concept of "what if internet but too much" is hardly original but at least there are songs about that which are good. This one is good, that other one is not.

**impla77** (6.6): not exactly a hot take but nice music

**starla\_** (6.5): /r/phonesarebad

**cremeebrulee** (6.2): if u don't want me on my phone how am i supposed to listen to ur music ben and andrew . yeah that's what i thought

**camerinian** (6): having spent the last two hours lying down in a park punching numbers and stupid words into my phone in order to get this rate in on time I feel very attacked

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): TAYLOR SWIFT LAMP???

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Love the sonic textures of this but the lyrics and melody are kinda nothing

**reput4tionera** (6): i just listened to this song and do not remember what it sounds like

**TiltControls** (6): I know it's not what it means, but when I look at this all I can see is That'S our LAMP

**akanewasright** (5.5): The way this isn’t the most insufferable version of this rough message in song form by a longshot ☠️ at least this has some sweet drums

**freeofblasphemy** (5.5): wow he’s just like me

**seanderlust** (5.5): okay...I agree that phones are ultimately detrimental to the mental health and well-being of people if used too much but like. this feels a little too much like boomery "go spend time with a real person!!!" griping for me.

**a-man-with-a-perm** (5): This Sucks Lame Ass Moops Poop

**pig-serpent** (5): Tropical island vaporish synthwave is a great idea.  This execution of it is a little boring but they'll get points for trying!

**welcome2thejam** (5): "Oh, so this is about phone addiction" -man looking up the lyrics on his cell phone

**CrimsonROSET** (4): PHONE BAD

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): this is just boring and reeks of a “phone is bad” fantasy utopia where we’re all interconnected by the power of not having a phone.

**plastichaxan** (3.5): This isn’t an acronym for Taylor Swift Loser Around Many Popheads???

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.5): SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!! NO ONE CARES IF YOU THINK PHONES ARE BAD I DIDNT DO THIS RATE TO LISTEN TO WHITE MEN SINGING A PHONES BAD SONG

**Awkward\_King** (1): somehow the swifties gonna see taylor swift lamp and think she's featuring mitski on midnights good lord

**Hulnia** (1): phone bad 😕😡🙄

Uberpigeon: Well... That's a wrap for day 1!

Superorganism suffered the most causalities, with a tragic THREE songs remaining, and MGMT aren't off the hook either losing over half their album too.

Let's Eat Grandma  and Kero Kero Bonito manage to get away with only losing two songs each! Stay tuned to see how the rest shakes out. We will be starting ONE HOUR EARLIER tomorrow!
