Hello everyone, your [days of longing](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/292042312958083075/972534015271788544/unknown.png) are FINALLY over, and we are finally here to host the best rate featuring this specific set of albums from the year 2018 EVER!!!!

I’m u/RandomHypnotica, and between myself and my lovely cohost u/Uberpigeon, we’ve kind of got a chokehold on the popheads indie rate market, and we’ve finally joined forces to bring to you this incredible lineup of 4 amazingly haunting, catchy and incredible albums. 

If you’re new to rates, here’s a [short video to introduce the rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ1SDlLZcpM), and without further ado, let’s get into the albums in the rate!

> Dear future self, it’s me again, the girl you buried way back when

In early 2018, Kero Kero Bonito were niche internet favourites, known for their infectiously bright and bubbly electronic songs, and their combination of [wild samples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKl9yh5QToY), [delicious beats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aQBkCrpWOg) and also some good old fashioned [meme fame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY-FJvRqK0E). They had a reputation as a carefree and energetic group, which made it all the more surprising when in February, they dropped the lead single off their upcoming project, [“Only Acting”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sepcj45774I). The song starts out familiar enough, with Sarah singing some whimsical lyrics over a drum beat and a bassline, but then the chorus comes in with a guitar and you realise it’s a rock song, a first for the band. Then, the real chaos begins, with the second verse turning into a cacophony of noise and distortion, and you realise just how different this sound is. One week later, the band released the TOTEP EP, a 4 song project that introduced fans to this new, darker, grungier sound.

A few months later, the band dropped another surprise single [“Time Today”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WqcPYOr--g), a song off of their new album “Time ‘n’ Place”, which would be coming “soon”. A few months and a [handful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuG-B35IOvA) of [singles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQsI_HEcrbI) later, the band surprise dropped Time ‘n’ Place on October 1st, an album full of entirely new sounds for the group, from noise pop, to shoegaze, to dream pop and indie rock, the album manages to carry a great sense of cohesion through it’s shifting sounds, and the bleak yet optimistic tone of the lyrics throughout the album make this one of my personal favourite albums of the year.

Kero Kero Bonito are no strangers to rates, having been in various grabbags over the past few years, before finally being rated earlier this year in 2021 Electronic Pop. They have yet to nab the rate win however, will this finally be the opportunity for them?

**[Let’s Eat Grandma - I’m All Ears](https://diy-magazine.s3.amazonaws.com/d/diy/Artists/L/Lets-Eat-Grandma/leg-lp.jpg)**

> Oh…. Oh……… Oh wait a minute…

After debuting in their mid-teens with 2016’s *I, Gemini*, British pop duo Let’s Eat Grandma devoured expectations by releasing their sleek career-defining electropop album I’m All Ears. 

Jenny and Rosa, only 19 at the time, elevated their hodgepodge homemade proggy “experimental sludge pop” sound into a dark glimmering atmosphere of pop. The girls actually had a budget this time, thanks to a grant from a music funding charity, and they put those pennies to work! 

The late, great, and forever iconic SOPHIE features in the album, as some PC music heads will already know. She helped produce the striking hyperpop smash Hot Pink, perhaps the duo’s best-known song, as well as the most bagel-heavy track on the album: It’s Not Just me.

The whole album storms with the angst of late teen/young adulthood in the best way possible. The girls capture these feelings and moments with the absolute sincerity that only pretentious art kids can (compliment). It’s a modern classic of indie pop and I’m so happy it’s getting the highest honour of music: Featuring in a popheads rate. I hope you all love it as much as I do!

**[MGMT - Little Dark Age](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a788b9f99fd21624ededd01/original/original/Little%20Dark%20Age.jpg)**

> Go 👏 Fuck 👏 Yourself! 👏

Indie rock duo, and enemy of popheads, MGMT, have had an interesting career. A hugely successful debut album (the only one in this rate) with 3 iconic singles. (that they hate)
MGMT’s Kids was THE zeitgeist of indie pop rock. Then they released an amazing flop album. Then a weird and bad flop album. Then a long hiatus.

During this hiatus, the band attempted to write new music with a similar method to their debut, however, this proved to be a fruitless endeavour. Inspiration finally struck when the band started working with Patrick Wimberly, one half of the former indie pop duo Chairlift (I suspect you probably recognise [the other member](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VsL8zCdYVk)), who encouraged the band to explore new directions and pushed them out of their comfort zone.

And so, on one beautiful day in 2018, they dropped the title track to Little Dark Age. [Everyone loved it!](https://i.gifer.com/5sax.gif) Fully embracing the poppy roots that they had tried to hate for so long, MGMT returned to great acclaim with a fresh gothic-tinged indie pop album. And it deserves the hype! This album has it all! 80s throwback bops, queerbaiting, misogyny, fitness instructors, and men!

**BONUS RATE**

Since this is the “brain off” cycle of rates, we’ve decided to have a little bit of fun with the bonus rate, and taking inspiration from the bonus of the 2015 Alt Pop Rate, we will be rating a list of topics/animals/concepts/characters inspired by the artists and albums in this rate!

**Kero Kero Bonito**  
- Frogs  
- Japanese  
- [Kero from Cardcaptor Sakura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipIJKI4FAdA)  
- Clocks  
- Maps  

**Let’s Eat Grandma**  
- Grandmas  
- Grammar  
- Cannibalism  
- Interludes  
- [SCP-1048-A](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1048)  

**Superorganism**  
- Ants  
- Siphonophores  
- Whales  
- Supergroups  
- Self Titled Albums  

**MGMT**  
- Management  
- Initialisms  
- Disemvoweling  
- The Letter M  
- The Dark Ages  

This bonus rate is **optional**, and you can complete as much or as little of it as you like. You may NOT assign an 11 or 0 to any of these.

---

#The Rules

* Listen to every song listed below and assign each of them a score from **1 to 10**. Decimals are allowed, but refrain from going past one decimal place - 7.5 is fine, 7.75 is not!
* You may give **ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11**. These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track! You do not *have* to give these scores, however, if you do, they can only be used on songs in the main rate, NOT the bonus rate.  
* **Rate all forty-eight (48) songs!** If you skip any, your ballot won’t be counted (We will let you know if you do so you can remedy that).
* We ***highly recommend*** that you add a comment to your song ratings! It makes this a lot more fun for the reveal, plus if your comment is good enough you might even be lucky and end up featured on a banner in the reveal thread! 
* To leave a comment, add a space after the score and then type to your heart’s desire, like this:

 >    I Will Be Waiting: 10 us waiting to receive our ballots

* You may also add comments for whole albums! You can do this by adding a colon to the album title in the rate form, like so: 

 > Album: Time ‘n’ Place: KKB more like KK8

* **Please use the pre-prepared link to submit your scores!** Note that if you're trying to access on a mobile device or on the new reddit layout it may not work - as such, we have made it so the link will take you to old.reddit.com, and you should use a computer to send in your scores if possible! If it still does not work, a pastebin with the submission form is at the bottom of this post and may be copy/pasted into a DM if need be!
* If you desire to change any scores after you’ve already submitted, simply message either of the hosts (u/RandomHypnotica, u/Uberpigeon) and we'll be glad to help!
* We will be keeping an eye out for sabotage, and there will be a minimum average enforced for the albums. If you truly do have very strong opinions on a song or album, leave a comment explaining why and things will go over much more smoothly.

##At this stage, submissions are tentatively **due on October 7th!**, with the reveal scheduled for October 14th-16th. If you need an extension or have any questions, feel free to ask any questions in the comments, PM either of the cohosts or find us in the [popheads discord server!](https://discord.gg/3GXVe6QQ)
