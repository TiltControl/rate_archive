**RandomHypnotica** (10): when the album first dropped, this was one of the tracks I first fell in love with, and I think a large contributor to that was seeing someone on the KKB sub say that this song was basically [this image.](https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/685/7c4/7343fd9716941c5ca9622cdc0569f7cabb-19-lisa-simpson-sensory-deprivation-tank.jpg) The synths here are both cool and warm, comforting and distant, and i adore the lyricism that highlights the sentimentality we create with our silly little possessions, and the kind of sadness that comes when we have to get rid of them, most times because something in our lives has changed, whether it’s moving, something being replaced or maybe someone passing away, there’s an inherent sadness to something someone purchased with the full intention of being used getting discarded.

**Uberpigeon** (9): I love this kind of mundanity that kkb like to sing about. But unfortunately a song about going to dump is never going to go over well in a stacked rate like this. Goodbye dump!

---

#Dumpster Divers

**reput4tionera** (10): i need to take the trash out

**runaway3212** (10): I love odes to the UK

**seanderlust** (10): reminds me of 21/04/20

**Stryxen** (10): I have a lot of love for this one. Perfectly captures the wonder and joy in the little things of every day life while simultaneously delivering a dreamlike but documentary-style narration of what I interpret as dropping off their emotional baggage and weight and aiming to reach happiness in this every day life. Or maybe its not that deep. Either way I have cried to this.

**apatel27** (9.5): Dumps are a depressing place to be yes

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (9.4): Never bought into dubbing KKB as twee, they simply were too advanced in production techniques and pop prowess; they understood that it'd be a fucking pigeonhole, right? their savant naiveness they convey is just a little too eye-winking Anyways, Dump is what happens when you try to make trip ho--err downtempo, but for gamers. It's a lowkey stunner, with its own cold swagger sashaying through the fog of bodies, places, and liminal spces.

**homestarguy** (9): Excellent use of different variations of what I call the “KKB arpeggio” (real KKB-heads know what I’m talking about). That little breakdown at 1:05 is so sick.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): dump more like bomp? bop. it's a bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): The ambient noise at the end of the track gave me chills and I have no idea why, really like this one.

**heysoupie** (8.5): also pleasant, but definitely a strange reminder of how you can’t really throw things away because there really isn’t an “away” for our capitalist trappings :\\\\

**imbaby122** (8.2): kkb supports my hoarding habit like it’s so silly to throw stuff away!!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): It’s a song about garbage but it sounds so nice!

**bogo** (8): somehow sarah makes a simple song about a dump sound so dejected. doesn't stop it from being a bop though

**celladonn** (8): Damn I wish I was taking a somber stroll through the dump rn!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): emo Marie Kondo anthem

**nt96** (8): what I do when I'm on the toilet

**slimboyfriend** (8): forget the mall kids, the dump is the place to be!

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): thank you hypno for putting this on my floating playlist like a year ago

**jasannn** (7.5): the instrumental is hardcarrying as a kirbybop

**jman457** (7.5): pleasant but inoffensive

**destroyallhumans2** (7): perfectly captures the vibe of the dump, perhaps too well

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): is this where Björk was throwing things off a cliff

**vayyiqra** (7): Definitely one of the goofiest KKB song names, which is saying a lot. Nice song, bad name. Love the ride cymbal on the drums!

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6.5): cool stuff, I like this one

#Trash Talkers

**thedoctordances1940** (6): where this belongs lol lmao

**flava** (5.5): it just kinda meanders and floats about cutely without a hook before ending

**CrimsonROSET** (5): the nursery rhyme melody doesn’t work because some of these lyrics are really clunky, so it doesn’t feel like it just flows on top of it, it’s more like you’re trying to speak in sing-song voice

**freav** (5): it's okay!

**impla77** (4.5): teaching the important junkyard etiquette

**starla\_** (4.5): a bit boring

**cremeebrulee** (4): i will genuinely forget sarah is british and then out of nowhere she’ll say something like “lorry” and it brings me back to reality

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): was that it

**pig-serpent** (4): The part where this album gets boring and I stop paying attention to it :/

**zukomu** (4): I forgot this song was playing while I was listening to it, it just faded into the background of my brain

**freeofblasphemy** (3.5): Sarah’s such a lively vocalist why does this so sound so lifeless and drab?

**camerinian** (3): like an AI generated KKB song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.9): audience.gif

**moonagenightmares** (2): total snooze

**Uberpigeon** (7): longsongphobia was kind of right here this is nowhere as good as the OTHER long song and maybe the only weak moment in the album.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): this is the one song on the album that I just can’t ever really seem to connect with… I understand the vibe that they were going for, but I think the length to get to the build is too extreme here and underwhelming.

---

#Cool

**whizzer0** (11): Because I know it's gonna get overlooked but this song has been my life for a long long time.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): album highlight

**plastichaxan** (10): My God this song just brings out every emotion that I have ever repressed in my life and I was raised catholic while being gay/nonbinary so there’s A LOT of that

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): my anxious self also wishes

**starla\_** (10): if I was a teenager when this came out I would be crying to this song like daily

**Stryxen** (10): MEEEEEE i’m a mess too.. This is actually cutting me right to my core,,, last minute 10 omg

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (10): I had completely forgot about the nine minute stunner. Sonically, it hits a WILD "post-Bends, pre-OKC AKA 'Alanis Morisette'" era Radiohead guitar clapback crossed w/the 2112 quiet gtr part noodling. Like forreal WHAT THE FUCK WERE THEY DOING HERE? This shit opens a whole new rift in the sonic fabric and brings in a new vulnerability. It sprawls through electronics, pianos, mantras, and big honking anthemic drums; It earns that sprawl because again, Jenny and Rosa are insanely good (cathartic) enunciators that CONVEY desperately dreaming to evade insularity; not escape it outright, but evade it for one glimmering moment amongst that crowd. So so so rare is it that you get a song like this. It's beyond ballsy and it just puts so much of the rate to shame.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): cool

**destroyallhumans2** (9): yeahh, this is me

**freeofblasphemy** (9): This is true post-rock

**pig-serpent** (9): The guitar gives strong classic rock vibes, which is always cool.  I think I like this a lot more than the other long song on this album.

**freav** (8): takes a bit to gain steam but it's absolutely worth it at the end

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): they really made it just interesting enough for a 9 minutes song… no more no less.

**vayyiqra** (8): Why do they love the ampersand so much? Is it because they're British? What else are they hiding? How can something be both antiseptic and infectious at the same time? Those are opposite things. Is that the point? Anyway this song doesn't really go anywhere and definitely doesn't need to be nine minutes long but I like it and never get bored during it. Something something Talking Heads joke, same as it ever was.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Somebody bring back Big Suit Kermit, his job ain't done yet

**jman457** (7.7): this was good track, but gave a little too much deadhead vibes

**akanewasright** (7.5): this drags just a touch but it’s a cool concept executed pretty well

**indie\_fan\_** (7.5): it was mostly a 5.5 until those last two minutes or so started hitting

**impla77** (7.3): really great in parts, especially chorus, very atmospheric

**1998tweety** (7): i think this is good

**jasannn** (7): instrumental saved it

#Collected some low scores

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6.5): coooooool and like 15 minutes long - doesn't need to be

**seanderlust** (6.5): the guitar towards the end is nice but it truly does not need to be this long

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i like what they were going for but this could have been 3 minutes shorter at least

**reput4tionera** (6): why is this song so fucking long

**camerinian** (5.5): wow so nice of them to promo Winners Rate 3 by quoting rate winner Talking Heads and their hit song Once In A Lifetime, which can be scored now in Winners Rate 3, currently open and accepting ballots

**homestarguy** (5.5): There’s a good 4.5-minute song in here, you can cut the rest.

**imbaby122** (5.3): 9 minute long song = time to proof read my comments for 2 minute long kkb songs. maybe play a bit of mario kart. respond to some texts.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I don’t think that this is bad at any point, in fact it’s good at several, but it’s so long it’s hard for me to experience any emotions by the end of it. If they cut out the middle four minutes it would be great.

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): you make me feel so… sleepy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): i can see why this is the least streamed song on the album

**sage** (4.1): shmimimimi shhhmimimimi shdhdhhmimimi

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I’m longsongphobic for this one and I’m not ashamed.

**heysoupie** (3.9): reminds of tegan and sara in that the lyrics and music would have spoken directly into my angsty teenage soul. Doesn’t really do it for me as an adult.

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): the breakdown in this kinda sounds like Led Zep

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): the climax of the last half is not worth the horrors of the first

**runaway3212** (2): everything about this song is horrible except the slay outro

**Roxieloxie** (1): this had no reason to be 9 minutes, could've been an easy 2 keep it pushing

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): When I saw kkb live it was at a festival at 11am and despite KKBbeing amazing the crowd weren’t happy. And neither were the raters when they listened to this song apparently! I think it’s cute!!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): I’ll be honest, i mainly included this just because I wanted the rate to have a number of songs that was easily divisible by 3, and I was fully expecting this to be the first song out, but instead it survived several actual album cuts… it’s cute, it’s fun, it’s fine, but it’s not very much more.

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (8): reall cute video!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Meh. It lacks seasoning.

**CrimsonROSET** (4): we’re going on a trip in our favorite rocketship going through the sky (for actual notes why is her voice so low on the mix)

**Uberpigeon** (9): The intro to this goes so hard it gets in my head all the time. And I don’t care what KKB claims. I KNOW TOTEP stands for the one true ep. There’s no way that just ACCIDENTLY gets on the ep packaging…..

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): I always found this to be a bit of a strange opener for TOTEP, but it grew on me when listening to it more for the rate. I still am dying to know what TOTEP means though.

---

#So True

**reput4tionera** (10): the way this ep isn’t even called the one true ep… what is the name…

**sage** (10): i didnt like this for the longest time but now its one of my favs by them

**homestarguy** (9.5): This EP is mad underrated.

**imbaby122** (9): i like when the universe chooses my life for me she’s just helping me out bc she knows i’m indecisive

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): dunno how I just didn't listen to TOTEP until today but this is slaying

**starla\_** (8.5): groovy

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.1): cult leader vibes (yassing)

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (8.1): this could have been on the album

**jman457** (8): I liked this

**pig-serpent** (8): Really the only song on Totep that lived up to Only Acting for me.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Wow they got on the same shit MGMT were on

**flava** (7.5): yeah the brief drill sound almost ruined it, but there’s a sweetnes here that didnt get completely ruined

**impla77** (7.4): nice production

**freeofblasphemy** (7): Fun! Unlike the album!

**runaway3212** (7): kinda meh

**Stryxen** (7): good but never clicked with me

**TiltControls** (7): why does the opening sound like fuzzified Like A Virgin

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6.5): like the creeping synths - more could have been done with it though

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): They’re talking about bimbofication.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this is fine but there was one time where it just made me deadpan to my screen for like five minutes

**freav** (6): eh

**vayyiqra** (6): The opening of this makes me think of "Policy of Truth" by Depeche Mode lmao (do the Indieheads synthpop rate btw). It's not bad. I'm not big on TOTEP but it has good songs. (Also I like the cover.) This is not one of the best songs on it though.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i was so bored

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (2.5): me looking for a clue to solve the mysterious drop in quality

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I feel like the bridge is really the only thing holding this song back for a lot of people, which is a shame, because I think that the chorus has a really pretty melody, the track is generally pretty relaxed (comparatively speaking), and it’s just a very easy, pretty listen. This also feels more relevant after the last couple of years…

**Uberpigeon** (9): This song beat TSLAMP so phones are officially GOOD! Hooray!!!!

---

#I love my puter. all my raters live on it

**camerinian** (11): I thought I might branch out for my 11, but fuck it. This song had an absolute stranglehold on me in early 2018. That chorus melody, despite it seeming so simple, spent a lot of time rattling around in my brain, and the comforting vibe is just so immaculate. This track also hits very different post-covid, like there was once a time where you could have positive feelings about sitting behind a screen and connecting with people that way. It is kind of wistful and innocent in that sense, and I really don’t think there’s gonna be an appetite to make more music anytime soon with that concept. It just clicks so well and it take me somewhere gorgeous. Although maybe i shouldn’t be giving my 11 to a song that pronounces it “jif”

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I thought I was stockholming myself into liking this album but I actually think it’s just good.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh this is the terminally online album of the rate isn’t it

**runaway3212** (10): this sounds just like a snow patrol song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): Black Mirror is shaking!!!

**imbaby122** (9.2): 8 hours and 57 minutes average screen time this week… this song is for me.

**a-man-with-a-perm** (9): Just great pop music, never outstay its welcome and really touching

**apatel27** (9): Fuck parasocial relationships, all my homies hate parasocial relationships

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): One of those songs where the lyrics don’t really make any sense but they sound pretty and fit the vibe so it doesn’t matter.

**Stryxen** (9): Music

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): this album is weirdly obsessed with Amouranth

**welcome2thejam** (9): Two of the first three songs off this album dropped a bit on re-listen, but this one grew big time

**whizzer0** (9): more songs about the internet pls

**starla\_** (8.5): emo

**TiltControls** (8.5): Maybe I just don't have the something for my mind to comprehend the Superorganism, but this sounds so much more fluid without random sound effect breakdowns

**impla77** (8.1): interesting lyrics, great production

**homestarguy** (8): This chorus is ascendant even if the rest of the song doesn’t quite live up to it.

**celladonn** (7.5): don't like the way she pronounces gif. Yes I know it's the correct pronunciation I just don't like it.

**jman457** (7.4): This one is for us chronically online folks

**NFLfreak98** (7): The Good One

**pig-serpent** (7): A nice song but forgettable compared to the rest of the album.

#Do some self-reflection

**vayyiqra** (7): Is this like an "internet bad" song? "Phones bad"? "Online dating bad"? Maybe, it's been done and made better points by other artists, but it's not awful. It doesn't have much new to say, but it's not horrid. I like the bass? Idk.

**plastichaxan** (6.5): I wish I liked this more

**reput4tionera** (6.5): this was my fav so far until the pitched voice. i am a hyperpop enjoyer but i just cannot vibe w it

**moonagenightmares** (5.5): she said jif…

**freav** (5): music that does not really exist

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): did they really unironically include the word ‘gif’ in a lyric

**freeofblasphemy** (5): It’s like…there are ideas? But they’re not executed particularly well

**cremeebrulee** (4.6): i want this album to pull a reverse beths so bad

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): i thought i hated it turns out i just mildly dislike it!!!

**bogo** (4): okay, i see they've gone from super annoying to just completely boring now. also fuck you it is not pronounced "jif" i don't give a fuck what the creator says i will die on this hill

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this was mostly just a whatever song to me until the bridge came in and those vocals ruined it

**zukomu** (3): Ah yes, Silly Jeff, that classic character

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (2.7): by the books xmu core that's just got a thumping mid bass, that ONE bloody fucking guitar lick that keeps showing up throughout the album, and a vomit hodgepodge of bird sound, reverb, and a kids chorus that sounds like it was recorded at gun point. this came out on the same label as Max Tundra, and he did NOT ask the smelly Superorgranism kids for a remix with his 2k22 reissue...read the room at just how bad they flopped. max tundra doesn't even wanna be associated with 'em.

**akanewasright** (2): this is just boring… honestly that’s disappointing for them

#Let's Eat, Grandma!

**apatel27** (10): Grammar is fun

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I have lost a friendship before because I’d always correct their bad grammar

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): I’m an English major, I have to have a fastidious obsession with grammar and sounding smart while using words incorrectly.

**frogaranaman** (10): something I'm bad at

**runaway3212** (10): we love knowing which words go where

**Stryxen** (10): i was such a grammar nerd in primary I have to do this for my inner 9 year old

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): my best subject in grade school

**vayyiqra** (10): Grammar is very cool, it's a trait of all human language and the complexity of it is unique to us and believed to be at least somewhat innate (many would argue, it's a classic debate in psycholinguistics and so on). The diversity of how grammar works while still having some near-universal features is neat as hell. You may be thinking of grammar as boring because of the way it's taught in English classes but it's a lot broader than stuff like where apostrophes go; it's literally all the rules that languages use (spoken or written). Without it, we would find it very hard to communicate. Yes, nobody likes grammar pedants (and a lot of the stuff they say isn't even true) but let's ignore them. Linguists aren't very interested in grammar being right or wrong, just how it's different.

**1998tweety** (9): serve

**just\_thonking** (9): In the descriptivist sense grammar is a slay. This is an anti-prescriptivism safe space. Prepositions are things we can end sentences with

**nt96** (9): iz gud 4 u

**fadedblue09** (8): I probably should give this is a higher score since I'm majored in linguistics but honestly eh

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I like it but it doesn’t like me

**heysoupie** (8): v useful but hate how its weaponized as though its some kind of morality/intelligence test in the US

**jasannn** (8): me likey

**pig-serpent** (8): i liKe grammEr! but ru1es wERe made t0, be broken yo[

**slimboyfriend** (8): I like to feel better than everyone else, and grammar lets me do that

#Lets Eat Grandma

**a-man-with-a-perm** (5): sucks but is necessary

**akanewasright** (5): Necessary, but we hate pedants

**freav** (5): lets eat grammar

**whizzer0** (5): grammar achieves the perfect equilibirium (I tried three times to type this correctly I give up) of being both over and underrated I think we should just collectively just shut up and move on from it except linguistics is really cool

**bogo** (4): english grammar rules make no fucking sense lol

**flava** (3.5): useless skill

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Passive voice is stanned by us.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): overrated

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (1): boo hiss

**imbaby122** (1): boringgggg

**plastichaxan** (1): Fuck grammar

**reput4tionera** (1): you will pry all lowercase out of my cold dead hands

**seanderlust** (1): literally made up. no i will not correct my grammar, facebook commenter. language is made up, nothing is real, have a glass of wine and calm down.

**thedoctordances1940** (1): fuck prescriptivism, grammar is useless, just say what u want smh, as long as you can be understood it matters not how it's said

**Uberpigeon** (8): Jaime don’t listen to those raters sweetie your rap was lovely! (this is my least favourite Time ‘n’ Place song.)

**sage** (10): jamie verse is so bad its good

**destroyallhumans2** (8): the rap at the end makes me feel things

**homestarguy** (8): Jamie got bars

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): if this gets tanked due to misandry..

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): They were ringing the dinner bell at the beginning of this song because it’s time to eat.

**imbaby122** (9): i really don’t want to believe the consequences of my choices are that substantial that’s scary.

**akanewasright** (8.5): idk I like it when kkb get to be silly little guys! Like

**camerinian** (8.5): crazy how excited I was to hear a different voice on this album

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): I think my score is this high cuz of the nasty guitar at the end lol

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.3): the less I know the better

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (8.2): This is funk music, but it's not quite by white people so it can't be labeled "white boy funk". It also keeps slinking around, brilliantly mutating


**runaway3212** (8): I just love her voice

**vayyiqra** (8): Needed something a bit less grim at this point in the album. Good breather song. "An absolute bop of a bassline" says Genius.com. Funny thing to call a song that's basically about existentialism, but it doesn't quite lie either, you know? Nobody asked Jamie to quasi-rap but whatever, ignore, please ignore,

**jman457** (7.6): liked the scratchy guitar

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i need a whole song thats just the janky guitar in this

**welcome2thejam** (7): Move over Marvel, it's time for the Bonito Multiverse

#Multiverse Of Midness

**freav** (6.7): this is a bit like a bonito generation song but less endearing, nice solo

**starla\_** (6.5): I like the fuzzed out guitars in this

**celladonn** (6): fun lyrical concept but the song isn't a fave

**heysoupie** (6): i guess it’s fine

**a-man-with-a-perm** (5.5): man there's even a guitar shredding in this one

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.5): tw// men

**impla77** (5.4): Instrumental in middle cool, rest I can leave

**CrimsonROSET** (5): sarah bonito played life is strange once

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): The switch in sound to a slightly more funk/soul influenced vibe is greatly appreciated but the actual song itself is kinda unremarkable other than that and the fact that it contains white rap.

**freeofblasphemy** (4.5): That guitar freakout does a lot of heavy lifting in turning this from a painfully boring song into just a kind-of boring song.

**pig-serpent** (4): On no this album is boring again.

**fadedblue09** (3.5): probably the first miss of the album, this sounds aimless

**Uberpigeon** (10): On it’s own, maybe this isn’t a great song. But when taken in the context of this being the opener of a KKB song… a band known for making yassified cbeebies music… it hits different! THIS is how you let people know that shit is about to go DOWN and it’s iconic for that.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): A great opener, that feels like it perfectly tells you exactly what the highs and lows of this album are going to sound like, the fuzzy guitar and glitchy synths with Sarah’s vaguely depressing yet bright vocals crashing in, and then going into the spacious, floaty outro just hits right to me, but I can see why some felt it was underdeveloped.

---

#Out Out (Feat. Charli XCX)


**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): what is the title, it’s a word I am unfamiliar with. Is it the green stuff Porter Robinson was lying on?

**homestarguy** (10): This is blatantly Scott Pilgrim-core, and you know what? I’m more than happy with that. Bread does indeed make you fat.

**reput4tionera** (10): my mom hates this song

**Stryxen** (9): was my least favourite for a while but WHO am I kidding??? Perfection

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (9): A lot of Time 'n' Place sounds like an alternate path Lush didn't take after Split. I love when Sarah has that moment of living and dying in time and space and she just goes One two three four five six miles away!!/I wonder if they notice over there?" just a brilliant delivery. great flow for the track

**welcome2thejam** (9): Is this Bubblegrunge!?

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): bill wurtz ass song

**impla77** (8.8): nice bombastic start

**bogo** (8.5): damn they just come right out of the gate swinging here, no warnings just BAM punk rock. gotta respect it

**plastichaxan** (8.5): They made a song about where popheads should go omfg

**seanderlust** (8.5): the lightning count is so cute omg

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Fuck the outdoors but this is a pretty good intro!

**fadedblue09** (8): best opener here so far

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): if the outside sounded like this i'd touch grass more. unfortunately it doesn't so i'm here doing rates on reddit <3

**runaway3212** (8): such a pretty opener


**slimboyfriend** (8): Not what I expected to hear after pressing play on a KKB album

**imbaby122** (7.8): this song sounds like listening to a video game soundtrack while ur brother is practicing with his band in the garage… i like.

**jasannn** (7.5): jump scare of an opener

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Hell yeah punk rock KKB!  Tbh it doesn't feel like a complete song but it's still really good.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): i dont think sarah’s voice really meshes well with rock music like this but if you take her out of this its an absolutely killer punk song

**heysoupie** (6.8): I go back and forth w/ finding the vocals annoying and charming. They always come across as a bit of a shock on this track.

**jman457** (6.7): alright start to the album

**1998tweety** (6.5): the graphics are good there

**camerinian** (6.5): they truly did have me in the first half, not gonna lie

**celladonn** (6.5): Cute little noisy rock moment i guess

#Outsiders

**frogaranaman** (6): where most of y'all should go

**vayyiqra** (6): It's KKB and it's distorted and the bleepbloops are minimal. This lets you know this is a serious album. No fun KKB!

**a-man-with-a-perm** (5.5): some Scott Pilgrim vs. the World soundtrack shit

**freav** (5): i love the fuzz but this isnt too strong of a song

**freeofblasphemy** (5): This just really annoys me

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): George Michael massively outsold

**starla\_** (5): introphobia

**CrimsonROSET** (4): this is a good intro to what we’ll see in the album because it’s a hot mess

**thisusernameisntlong** (2): I didn't like this when I first heard it so for years I thought the opener was Time Today because it was the first song on my playlist. Time Today is a slay opener and I still don’t like this so I'm not holding back introphobia

#Leave her alone

**Awkward\_King** (10): sarah bonito i am free on th- GUNSHOTS

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): Sarah Bonito I am free to cash you ousside on Thursday if you are free howboutdah-

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): the B-Side to swimming, written when they were touring the album, it’s another KKB song where you get exactly what the title implies. The synths here remind me a lot of the snow world from Mario 64 for some reason, but it’s just got a really pretty vibe.

**Uberpigeon** (8): I cannot remember which song is called rest stop and which song is called the open road for the LIFE of me. In Fact i didn’t even know they were separate songs until I was talking to my lovely cohost about “the bonus track that got added into the album” because I thought that’s what happened. But no. Rest stop was always there and it is not the open road. So confusing!

---

#No hesitation at the traffic lights

**reput4tionera** (10): me when im driving

**runaway3212** (10): DRIVING!!!! THE WIND THROUGH YOUR HAIR!!! DRIVING THROUGH HOUSES TEARING WALLS DOWN! I LOVE DRIVING!

**Stryxen** (10): so awesome and THE best song to listen to in the rain at evening. makes me feel like a main character with my own soundtrack

**imbaby122** (9.6): no more songs about driving please - sincerely, a 19 year old without a license

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): imagine having money to travel

**welcome2thejam** (9): Unintentionally very funny coming right after Rest Stop

**starla\_** (8.5): this is better than most of the actual album

**Awkward\_King** (8): me when there's no cars

**cremeebrulee** (8): open road ahead i sure hope so

**homestarguy** (8): Definitely a song worthy of B-side status, but UGH the sound they had at this period was perfect. Love the Bomberman 64 menu-ass keyboard on it.

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (7.8): again, its just very decent shoegaze that sounds like Lush. this is a good thing.

**freav** (7.7): this is better than many songs of the album

**1998tweety** (7.5): me driving home from the florence concert at 1 am

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): i love the synth in this that sounds like the sound effect that plays when you find a hidden object in an i spy computer game

**impla77** (7.4): this is a cute song

**heysoupie** (7.2): sounds like christmas

**freeofblasphemy** (7): Okay why couldn’t the album be more like this

**vayyiqra** (7): Oh yeah this song exists. I don't listen to it often but it's alright. It's fuzzy but in a way I like. This is okay. The key to making a KKB fuzzy indie pop/rock song that is good is to have some melody, you know? Add a little synth too, it's not KKB without that. It's just weird. They are not a rock band, they can't rely on nothing but guitar.

#I'm About To Crash

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): It’s nice bloops and bleeps but I can see why it was a B Side. No really good hook.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): why are you trying to make em proud go see the open road by yourself

**a-man-with-a-perm** (5.5): this is stolen valour from a Goofy Movie

**jman457** (5.4): glad this is a b-side

**pig-serpent** (4): Oh it's the boring dream pop of the album, just not on the album cuz even the band realized it was boring.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): this shows my issue with connect to KKB’s music outside of noise pop. this doesn’t sound like anything to me, just very slight

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): This was left off the album for a reason and we should have respected that by leaving it out of the rate

**Uberpigeon** (10): This instrumental intro beating out so many other songs is the haunting revenge of the other LEG songs that got tanked. Hahahahaha!!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): The fact that this managed to place in the top half of the rate is genuinely hilarious, iconic and also kind of deserved? This is SUCH an epic album opener. Sure it doesn’t exactly stand up on it’s own, but god it gets me HYPED.

---

#Well...

**bogo** (10): please don't let this tank, this is a great instrumental

**plastichaxan** (10): This is gonna be so robbed being an amazing instrumental I hate it here

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): banger opener honestly would be a slay if it outlasted like half the Superorganism album (I hope it won't but it'd still be funny)

**thedoctordances1940** (9.4): being a bit kinder to it cause it's just an instrumental intro track but it sounds amazing and deserves better than only beating out like 5 superorganism songs

**cremeebrulee** (10): this came on shuffle when i was driving once and my sister asked me to stop playing grimes in the car

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): video game instrumental vibes and I am living

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): combatting introphobia one song at a time

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): god this intro is fucking perfect, so dark and mysterious while sounding epic at the same time. i don’t normally give intro tracks like this 10s but how can i resist when it sounds this amazing

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): this epic EBM/orchestral SERVE!!! they should score a movie (maybe they have idk)

**seanderlust** (9.5): it's just an instrumental opener, but god what a banger of an instrumental opener it is


**flava** (9): ok a really good swampy mix gives this a very gothic feel to it. Inviting you into the darkness that may or may not murder you and leave your body in a swamp

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Love the horror movie soundtrack vibes and really love that it doesn’t overstay its welcome! Under two minutes, slay!

**just\_thonking** (9): Every album should start by making u feel like you're about to watch a blockbuster action movie

**starla\_** (9): introphilia

**vayyiqra** (9): Suddenly all goth and spooky! It is definitely fall now. Mom come pick me up I'm scared

**whizzer0** (9): SOMETHING SPOOKY ABOUT TO GO DOWN

**imbaby122** (8.7): yassified halloween theme lowkey. john carpenter count your days.

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): okay I’m listening

**freeofblasphemy** (8): I like when intros go hard

**1998tweety** (7.5): its actually clear

**reput4tionera** (7.5): this would be a sick stadium show opening song before the act goes on

**sage** (7.5): cool intro

**TwoAmeobis** (7.5): I'm here for the darkwave, just wish it was a full song

**a-man-with-a-perm** (7): hey it's an instrumental opener but it gets you ~ excited ~

**CrimsonROSET** (7): we love an intro that doesnt disclose its an intro

**destroyallhumans2** (7): misleading intro but very slay

**freav** (7): cute

**heysoupie** (7): *adds to Halloween soundtrack*

**RandomHypnotica** (10): balladphobia strikes again :( . There’s something really gorgeous about the piano playing with the sound of light rain in the background, the girls vocals are absolutely piercing in the right way here, it’s haunting and tragic, and just gorgeous.

**Uberpigeon** (10): You lot are so nasty for leaving this song so low. I thought popheads were supposed to love Ava!!!!

---

#A lot of you guys have been asking about my hairstyle and why I chose to cut it this way. I wanted to show that doing something daring and unique is okay. The Max Cut represents strength, confidence, and being comfortable in your own skin. Setting trends, not following them❤️

**akanewasright** (10): The tampon lady could NEVER

**runaway3212** (10): ava max could never slay this much

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): BleepBloopMusicFan try not to reference Mother Ava Max for this song’s comment challenge: FAILED.

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): the best ava we've rated this year

**letsallpoo** (7): MAX?

**1998tweety** (6): Max >>>

**TiltControls** (4): Ava Max could do Donnie Darko but LEG couldn't do So Am I

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): ava studied the number ones blog to pick a song to sample in her next boring hit

**cremeebrulee** (6): damn pushing her album out to next year has hit her hard huh

#Kings and Queens

**bogo** (10): while i can't quite personally relate to this song, i nevertheless find the lyrics about trying to help someone who's struggling with their mental health to be completely heartbreaking and affecting.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): why am I crying

**flava** (10): such a sweet and lovely ballad, maybe this band doesn't my bullying


**Stryxen** (10): i can’t even describe how amazing this song is

**vayyiqra** (10): Can relate to this song being about how hard it is trying to help someone with mental illness because that's literally my job. I like doing it but it can be stressful sometimes. I have a belief that piano-heavy songs either are awful and pointless or they're great so this is the latter.

**whizzer0** (10): I realised recently that this song is a follow-on to "Rapunzel" from their first album, reinterpreted through the lens of IAE, and I think that adds a lot to both songs. They have a lot of interesting connections like that - notably Sax in the City seemingly being from the perspective of someone witnessing Falling Into Me and the Sleep Song/Donnie Darko/Levitation trilogy, using powerful ways to represent the powerlessness/recklessness/distance of youth/adolescence/adulthood respectively.

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (9.7): One insanely potent variable in the LEG soup is their affliction for adele style confrontational piano pop. Ava is but a mere stopgap on our journey to the final chamber of I'm All Ears. It's an aching look at a companionship of sorts--someone hurting and someone unable to help--turned into a fictive character sketch. Jenny aces that pain to the point you look out your window and you think of your own Avas and "where are they nows?". :,

**freav** (9.5): this is just gorgeous

**impla77** (9.3): love these lyrics

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): LESBIAN RIGHTS!!!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.7): Max if she met an actual misfit who feels so dark and twisted that it would be impossible to pretend to relate

**seanderlust** (8.5): i was going to make an ava max joke but this is honestly too lovely

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): finally, some good fuckign food

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): [man](https://preview.redd.it/a604rad7j4651.png?auto=webp&s=63112b65e516d3e19dcbd05489d09967a2d73dce)

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): it's very pretty but it gets a bit lost in between the two long masterpieces it's surrounded by for me

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Sad rain music good

**jman457** (7.5): This ones for the theater kids

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6.5): God they're so sweet and sentimental

**reput4tionera** (6.5): okay piano ballad!!!

#Salt

**frogaranaman** (6): damn why are these songs so long

**homestarguy** (6): This is pretty.

**sage** (6): cute

**starla\_** (5.5): a nice ballad

**imbaby122** (5.4): and when we needed sophie the most she vanished 😭

**DaHumanTorch** (4): tones and i if she covered sara bareilles

**heysoupie** (4): I know this song is heavy but listening to it feels like going to a poetry open mike where people are reading intensely personal poetry and its just not…good.

**fadedblue09** (3): Not another acoustic song….this album has been really disappointing so far I'm sorry

**sage** (11): one of my fav songs ever, im so glad i got to see this live

**reput4tionera** (10): me when i went to my local movie theater to see bodies bodies bodies and there was only one other person in the theater

**Stryxen** (10): deserved to be on time ‘n’ place i fear a perfect mix of dump and make believe and would slot so neatly in the middle. But i also really like it as a closer so the ep treatment is fine too

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): weirdly not the first song called Cinema that we rated this year

**cremeebrulee** (9): trying to make some comment about movies by weyes blood here to sow discord between benji and hypno but i am flopping

**homestarguy** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiEeIxZJ9x0

**runaway3212** (9): cinema flopping irl but slaying in this rate

**welcome2thejam** (9): Indie pop sounds good in a place like this

**akanewasright** (8.5): that random Cecile Believe riff… love it

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this still feels like such an un-kkb song but i enjoy it a lot, i wish i liked it more as a film student. "distracted in the dark" is such a great line

**starla\_** (8.5): I love the sample

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.4): Sarah Bonito I am free to swap Letterboxd profiles on Thurs-

**1998tweety** (8): ascending a bit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Oh yeah!

**celladonn** (8): this one's for the girlies that love going to matinees by themselves and being the only person in the cinema and genuinely enjoy their solitude but also have a deep well of loneliness and melancholy within them

**CrimsonROSET** (8): good on you sarah, go treat yourself

**destroyallhumans2** (8): cinema is to cinemas what dump is to dumps

**imbaby122** (8): my favorite thing about the song is, like, it feels like a song.

**plastichaxan** (8): This is disco

**vayyiqra** (8): The best song on TOTEP and main reason I go back to it, this feels a bit like the concept of "what if the stage/screen metaphor from 'Only Acting' but more chilled out and not deranged" which works better for me. It's nice. You ever go to the movies alone? I used to all the time, it's a vibe but it does feel lonely sometimes.

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (8): sarah i love films. omg they really just made a downtempo pop EP lol.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): hits a bit different during a pandemic

**freeofblasphemy** (7): Not a lot to say just glad to have KKB bounce back

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): short but sweet little tune, i wish the part where they sampled the lady singing lasted longer


#Taylor swift in Amsterdam

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.2): stream cinema by the marias instead

#Tina Taught Me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): overhated!!!

**fadedblue09** (10): They always slay

**plastichaxan** (10): They kinda eat sometimes but popheads are not ready

**seanderlust** (10): rating this as rate interludes which is how I was introduced to the greatest song ever made (rich bitch juice by alice longyu gao)

**Awkward\_King** (9): interludes are a thing that can be so personal

**apatel27** (8): Everyone needs a break

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): well that’s a tough question

**nt96** (8): I like em, other people however have the attention span of goldfish. Can't relate lol

**jman457** (7.8): screw y’all interludephobes

**1998tweety** (7): theyre fine

**CrimsonROSET** (7): Tina taught me sweetie

**destroyallhumans2** (7): some interludes should just be songs

**freav** (7): this is the interlude score

**bogo** (6): they can be great if they're properly used but most of them are just fine

**reput4tionera** (6): mixed bag

**vayyiqra** (6): A good interlude can be nice to break up two songs in a tracklist so they fit better together, or lead into the next song. A lot of them are pointless but when used sparingly they're good.

**whizzer0** (6): I'm All Ears is one of very few albums to use interludes effectively, but a good interlude is good, although now that I think of it it doesn't really use them effectively because I'm not really sure what they add to the album beyond pacing reasons (except whitewater, whitewater is great and should have been as long as donnie darko)

**cremeebrulee** (5): "when are we gonna have an interlude rate??" were you not here for BCC

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): depends on what context they’re used in, some feel very necessary and some don’t do anything at all. A random indie rock album doesn’t need interludes, something political or electronic might greatly benefit from them.

#The Cat's Pyjamas

**flava** (5): interludes are usually bad but they can be good sometimes

**heysoupie** (5): can be good but often just annoying

**imbaby122** (5): meh. can live with em and can live without em.

**jasannn** (5): sometimes good but most of the time pointless and feels like the artist is trying too hard to see credible

**pig-serpent** (5): There are some cool ones

**TiltControls** (5): it can make picking a 0 easy at least

**just\_thonking** (4): Usually don't add much to an album, but can sometimes be really good. Also can we please stop rating them

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): I like them if they're done well

**a-man-with-a-perm** (2): Oh, hello, you're early, We weren't expecting you today, but since you're here, Please, sit, would you like a cup of tea? There you go. Now, it will be a full house today. And many are unaware that you are joining. Not to be alarmed, I'm sure it'll be fine. However, the extroverts like to be entertained. And I was told you don't talk much?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): pointless 90% of the time especially when theyre in a rate and fuck up the averages of otherwise good albums (cough cough im all ears cough cough)

**welcome2thejam** (2): History's greatest monster

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (1): Just being realistic here.

**frogaranaman** (1): the way interludephobia is gonna extend right into the bonus rate

**Stryxen** (1): phobic

**runaway3212** (10): SUPERM MY BESTIES

**Stryxen** (10): boygenius rate omfg

**a-man-with-a-perm** (5): you get all hyped for a supergroup and most of the time they're pretty sucky n gimmicky

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I think this is fair since these tend to have like a 50% success rate.

**destroyallhumans2** (5): make the group smaller please

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): eh.

**imbaby122** (5): i don’t think i’m familiar with enough supergroups to give this a fair rating

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i like the concepts of supergroups more than the execution of 99% of them

**thedoctordances1940** (5): they usually suck let's be honest

**welcome2thejam** (5): Usually never quite as good as you hope

**jasannn** (4): super M ok. GOT the Beat bad.

**vayyiqra** (4): Eh they're often cheesy and forced but there are some good ones I admit. Can't think of any offhand but I know they exist.

**akanewasright** (3): usually kinda disappointing!

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): nice in concept but in execution… yikes!

**Awkward\_King** (2): wtf was mcbusted why did that ever happen

**flava** (1): when you put the best of the best together, you will get less than the some of their parts if they have no chemistry

**freav** (1): most of the time they suck

#Why is everyone talking about coldplay

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): We love Coldplay.

**bogo** (10): i love coldplay

**cremeebrulee** (10): chrue this can't be an indie rate without coldplay in it

**TiltControls** (10): wow I love coldplay

**flava** (9.5): not my favourite coldplay song but up there

**jman457** (8.8): great Coldplay song

**nt96** (8): my favorite Coldplay song

**welcome2thejam** (8): Join us at r/indieheads for Coldplay Wednesdays

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): fuck yeah I love Coldplay

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): ehh there’s better coldplay songs

**akanewasright** (5): brandy outsold coldplay

**freav** (5): i wond be brainwashed into thinking coldplay is good

#Grandfather Clocks


**jasannn** (10): beautiful and informational

**runaway3212** (10): also just so slay telling me the time



**vayyiqra** (10): Can't really say anything against clocks, they're boring but overall quite reliable pieces of technology (aside from the odd power outage) that do one thing and do it very well. I need to use the 24 hour clock a lot for my job (it's in healthcare) and accurate timekeeping is important for it. Also transportation would be chaos without clocks. The only bad thing about them is I guess when the glow from them keeps me up at night but that's not a pressing issue. Compared to sundials, clocks own.


**apatel27** (9): Tiktok

**Awkward\_King** (9): but i prefer when they're broken

**celladonn** (9): If you want to find out the time it's always a good idea to consider the humble clock!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): honestly, I like knowing what time it is


**1998tweety** (8): theyre fine


**slimboyfriend** (8): They all feel mystical somehow

**a-man-with-a-perm** (7): there's like a weird amount of people today that cannot tell the time on a normal clock???


**heysoupie** (7): useful but stressful

**seanderlust** (6): there's a lot more information I need to rate this. for example, is it perhaps a once-stopped clock that is ticking on?

**whizzer0** (6): okay so time is overrated as shit (is shit underrated? idk) but clocks make a cool/scary ticking noise so that's a point in their favour

#Cuckoo Clocks


**Stryxen** (5): meh. Digital: 7 Analog: 3

**thedoctordances1940** (4.3): old people need to stop complaining about some young people not being able to read analog clocks... like it's a system that has no benefits over digital anymore

**just\_thonking** (4): Helpful but don't like being reminded about the passage of time. Aesthetically speaking though, analog >> digital

**rotating3Dtext** (4): flops that remind you that you’ll die

**CrimsonROSET** (3): my therapist has a clock right behind the patient seat and I swear it’s there to bring out my anxiety

**imbaby122** (2): no. i don’t like time. clocks make me anxious

**pig-serpent** (2): Time does not exist.  Human beings were never meant to quantify the earth's cycle around the sun with little numbers.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): time keeps moving when I don’t want it to? Cringe

**frogaranaman** (1): passage of time. Don't like that. shooting the messenger in revenge

**plastichaxan** (1): Time should not be a concept like

**reput4tionera** (1): hate the ticking noise

#So Armani I'm Magnifique

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): they put crack in this album i am convinced

**runaway3212** (10): them singing like they actually can sing for the first time on this album

**whizzer0** (10): I think this is still my most listened? Easy to overlook on such a packed album but this one possibly has the most in it.

**plastichaxan** (9.8): This is such a cinematic journey wow what a moment

**imbaby122** (9.7): every layer added in the outro scratched my brain big time

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (9.5): Some of the brilliance of I'm All Ears comes down to the fact that Jenny and Rosa write songs that keep sounding like they NEED each other to a degree that suggests co-dependency. They're clearly in a sync and mindset with each other, but this isn't quite as simple. They need each other bc capitalism is bad and they can actually write abstract, oblique sketches of a distraught frustration with the privilege around them; what they find themselves entangled in. also, we're in that weird gray zone where radiohead and muse mend together and somehow THIS comes out?! its baffling but I'll take it

**sage** (9.4): wait this is so good maybe i did too much on them

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): their Reputation era slay

**CrimsonROSET** (9): what a fucking ride

**destroyallhumans2** (9): the ENDING AGHH!!!

**Stryxen** (9): oh she's a rapstress… she raps

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): this is foreshadowing Donnie Darko

**welcome2thejam** (9): Just when I got my fill of moody & introspective from the Trip Hop rate

**apatel27** (8.5): Fuck consumerism, all my homies hate consumerism

**freav** (8.5): this goes so hard, these triplets wow

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): I really hope they like Sinéad O’Connor

**starla\_** (8.5): I love the foreboding atmosphere on this track

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): honestly these lyrics are a bit concerning but i pretend not to hear it . yass we love codependency!!

**vayyiqra** (8): Why she green? No really I have no clue what the lyrics to this song mean but it's a jam. Something about capitalism bad? Environment good? Yeah I'm into it.

#Praying to God it turns out that it wasn't true

**heysoupie** (7.7): I think I really like this song. It’s sexy, it’s dark, it’s dramatic. But I really can’t get past the childish vocals. Like, can you imagine how amazing this song would be if the vocals were…different? Like, what if Romy sang it?

**jman457** (7.6): I liked it but felt a little long

**celladonn** (7.5): Parts of this are really really good but other parts drag a bit

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): One of my favorites on this album, I just wish it had a bit more momentum in the third verse. Like it just kinda keeps getting louder but not in a compelling way, it’s just getting lost in noise.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i think i’ve officially gone insane, this the beginning of the song reminds me of say it aint so and i cannot explain why

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6.5): a bit like a Bond theme in some places


**impla77** (6.3): I like instrumental but lyrics bit try hard. Outro so good tho

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This isn’t bad at all but I struggled a bit to get through the full runtime.

**frogaranaman** (5): I fucking hate this game

**homestarguy** (5): Ugh, this song (and most of this album) is such a needless slog. Luckily I think the sound of it is nice.

**reput4tionera** (4): personally was not a fan

**jasannn** (3): I’m getting bad flashbacks to listening to Wolf Alice in 2021 indie rock rate earlier this year

**camerinian** (2.5): the least this dirge could have done is have the dignity to just feel like it goes on forever, not to actually do that

**Awkward\_King** (1): id rather be playing snakes and ladders

**fadedblue09** (1): Their vocals are actively grating my ears

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Putting this in my “The artist is bullying me but they served so it was necessary” playlist.

**bogo** (10): GO 👏 FUCK 👏 YOUR 👏 SELF! I'M MEAN! NOT! NICE! YOU SAID IT TWICE! YOU SAID IT TWICE!

**cremeebrulee** (10): the "i'm not nice i'm mean and i'm evil" delivery is almost as believable as when some of you guys say you're in your harsh raters era

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is such a petty dipshit song but I love it lol

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): why are they literally me

**homestarguy** (10): “I’m not that nice” followed by that dissonant acoustic guitar lick….dat’s the good stuff.

**NFLfreak98** (10): when i die it'll be somehow related to AJR i just know it

**Stryxen** (10): :gun: :exploding_head: you die :scream: and words don't do anything :pointandlaugh:

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (10): Captured Tracks sound gets absolutely deliriously pissy to beyond transcendent results. what the hell kind of gas station pills fueled this absolute knockout of a vulnerable yet unhinged delivery? any other band of the MGMT caliber would have likely fucked this up, but (left or right?) MGMT singing guy hits a spot I gotta empathize with. I'd still shake his hand. Hell, I'd run a tik tok dance comp for this cut. And ONLY this cut.

**moonagenightmares** (9.7): so true

**jman457** (7.7): like the sentiment of this song

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Musically this sounds the nicest out of any song on the album but it could really stand to be catchier and have better vocals.

**reput4tionera** (7.5): this sounds like a bleachers song if jack antonoff was a little quirkier

**akanewasright** (7): the MGMT hater crew when this album goes out in its entirety:

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): this sounds like a showtune

**runaway3212** (7): this is so camp

**vayyiqra** (7): Why so aggressive? I think the narrator of this song is just taking out his own issues on you, the listener. Seek therapy, bestie. I am concerned for your mental health.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Verses are cute but I wish they’d punched up the chorus a bit

**freeofblasphemy** (5.5): I like when he says “go fuck yourself”

**Uberpigeon** (10): This is just a straight up banger that I kind of forgot about until revisiting this album for the rate. I love these few straight up rock smashes that kkb threw into this album!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): a lot of you said this is what bubblegrunge should be, and honestly i hear it. The lyrics have that trademark KKB childlike sense of wonder and innocence, but the dirty instrumental and the hints of sadness in the lyrics feel like a perfect match.

---

#WTF is Bubblegrunge?

**Stryxen** (9): why are birds not in the bonus rate. I demand a recount of the bubblegrunge birds bonus poll i was not satisfied getting paradise cityd

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): bubblegrunge

**bogo** (8): could this be considered bubblegrunge, cause i feel like this is closer to what bubblegrunge sounds like in my head than actual bubblegrunge lol

#Vote for pop punk rate

**cremeebrulee** (10): I LOVE INDIE MUSIC WOW!!! FUCK RATCOM!!!!

**reput4tionera** (10): kero kero bonito punk icons

**welcome2thejam** (10): Making a note to put this on repeat during takeoff next time I take a flight

**plastichaxan** (9.5): The transition from Only Acting to this kinda underrated

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this is the peak of the album for me, it deals with themes of bringing back youth and innocence but having that slowly leave you. It also is my favorite song sonically kinda, probably because it’s where the instruments are the most pronounced

**destroyallhumans2** (9): birds!!

**homestarguy** (9): Really think “You Know How It Is” deserves to be on the album here instead, but this is still so pretty.

**jasannn** (9): indie art hipster


**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.7): avril should've done something like this when she was in her weeb era

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (8.6): again, time 'n' place really was a process to allow KKB to use sounding like a lost 4AD/Creation records act. There's nothing inherently flawed with this approach to rock, and I love the little bells and whistles here. but forreal, KKB sound like they were meant to be on Ivo's 4AD unironically.

**imbaby122** (8.1): “the early riser gets the bird” - my very clueless but very lovely 16 year old sister

**runaway3212** (8): more like fly away silly kero kero bonito not knowing words (i am very smart)

**slimboyfriend** (8): is this existential


**impla77** (7.8): nice transition, quite catchy

**heysoupie** (7.7): very pleasant. It’s like a Mary Oliver poem set to indie pop.

**akanewasright** (7.5): tfw you start tearing up over a silly bird migration song about death

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): Lenny Kravitz outsold

**freav** (7.2): very good song, something doesn't click that much on the sonic level though, maybe i do hate shoegaze

**pig-serpent** (7): I like how the punk and the dream pop play off each other in this one.

**TiltControls** (7): like a dragonfly

**starla\_** (6.5): this is fun

#Fly 🪰

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is nice but it gets a little lost in the album.

**frogaranaman** (6): the Life of a Bug

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): don’t have any thoughts on this, head empty

**vayyiqra** (6): Here the "what if KKB video game music but fuzzy guitar" concept is working much better for me. Not bad!

**a-man-with-a-perm** (5.5): well hey it doesn't outstay its welcome

**camerinian** (5.5): student radio filler type beat

**freeofblasphemy** (4): Again what exactly is separating this from any other generic sugary electropop act?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is probably my 2nd favourite song from the album, and easily an 11 contender, I’m so upset it placed this low, it has everything that an amazing LEG song needs, a crazy catchy synth line, some abstract dream like lyrics painting vivid imagery, and a strong sense of security and reassurance in another person, it’s just a gorgeous gorgeous song.

**Uberpigeon** (10): Hypno is wrong actually this song isn’t about another person it’s about waiting for a change to appear in your life whatever that may be! And I think that kind of existential anxiety is a cool song topic!!  This one was mega robbed and you should be ashamed. I will be waiting for a rate that doesn't leave me disappointed and hurt.

---

#I Will Be SLAYting!

**apatel27** (10): ✨✨outro vibes ✨✨

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): When this song waits until Day 3 to go out YAAASSSS.

**seanderlust** (10): that build!!!! let's eat grandma just broke the dam of positive feeling hormones in my brain.

**Stryxen** (10): ugly sobbing no u don’t understand i crode

**TiltControls** (10): LEG's songs work best with a ton of wistful longing and this song is another great example of it

**homestarguy** (9.5): The Vibes are literally strong on this one.

**plastichaxan** (9.5): Even when I can’t relate to a song (I hate waiting) they make it so slay ugh

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (9.1): Again, the one lady has a god tier flow under a throbbingly feminine and unabashedly anthemic buildup that hits me RIGHT in the q-zone. I WILL KEEP WAITING for u!

**camerinian** (9): songs about waiting for someone are like a shortcut for my brain, like it's really hard to fuck that sentiment up for me

**freav** (9): this is so cute

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): "I hate fucking waiting" - Britney Spears

**vayyiqra** (9): They did the KKB "what if you're young and uncertain about yourself" thing but made it all synthy so I like it better.

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): Ah what a joyous and yearning number

**jman457** (8.4): loved the synth in this

**CrimsonROSET** (8): music to write fanfiction to (compliment)

**imbaby122** (8): drop wasn’t as exciting as i thought it would be

**a-man-with-a-perm** (7.5): well that was just lovely to listen to

**starla\_** (7.5): teenage angst

**heysoupie** (7.1): i like it but it has a bit of a synthpop mumford & sons vibe

**1998tweety** (7): me when the first bus drives past me so I have to wait for 20 minutes

#I Will be Hating

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): still waiting for the slay in this song

**impla77** (6.5): just fine

**reput4tionera** (6.5): these are starting to blend together

**runaway3212** (6): it starts and ends slay but the middle part really drags

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i will be waiting (for this song to get good)

**jasannn** (4): I’m not a big fan of only having one full song between two interludes especially if the song was boring.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Great instrumental but oh god I can’t with these vocals.

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): the first or so minute is fine but slowly it gets worse and by the time it hits the outro i hate it, i wish i liked their vocals more.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): seeing this *just* miss Day 3 is tragic, i love how rather than focusing on the obvious aspects of seeing someone you love in hospital, it’s all about the mundanities, the stuff that you can’t help but focus on in times like that, because it’s easier than thinking about the possibility of losing someone.

**Uberpigeon** (10): This is a standout of the album to me. The lyrics hit me like a big smack to the face. It's such a sad tender song that could ONLY have been made by KKB and I adore it.

---

#Brought Yoghurt

**apatel27** (10): :(

**Awkward\_King** (10): kkb songs that hit u like a punch to the gut gotta be one of my favourite genres

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh

**reput4tionera** (10): this song is so fucking sad

**runaway3212** (10): so insanely beautiful

**Stryxen** (10): [yeah… lol…]   (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/848639677392879677/1021371147339694151/emoji.png) <- benjypno please format this correctly. you know what to do. I love you thank you

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): STARDEW VALLEY???

**homestarguy** (9.5): Wouldn’t be out of place on Belle and Sebastian’s “Write About Love”

**plastichaxan** (9): More like crying hours haha

**imbaby122** (8.9): bright and sunny song about the most mundane hospital visit ever. sounds about kkb.

**heysoupie** (8.3): i want to like it, i like the story/feeling of the lyrics but the synth riff is just too much (if it were guitar instead, i’d probably bump it into the 9s…)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.2): Sarah Bonito I am free for lunch on Thursday are you available to grab yoghurt plea-

**akanewasright** (8): I *hate* going to hospitals and nursing homes to visit people so much… this feels really eerie to me in that way

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): omg that’s when I visit my grandma

**vayyiqra** (8): I just had a death in my family a week ago and spent part of the last week at my dad's house trying to console him so this is kind of raw right now. When this came out it was also around the time my grandmother died. Lot of death in my family over the last few years. My uncle is dying right now too. I can deal with death, but sometimes it's a little tough. Send me :hugging: emotes please.

**freav** (7.7): i didn't remember this song at all but its very fun

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): It may be a different sound for KKB but the bleeps and bloops are still here! (But we want to rate Bonito Generation)

**bogo** (7.5): ed sheeran found dead in a ditch

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): this deep in it sounds like this album is about death

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Sweet story behind this one but I’m kinda getting fatigued at this point in the album so it’s blending in to the background a bit.

**impla77** (7): perfectly charming

**starla\_** (7): cute bop

**camerinian** (6.5): I always perceived this album as being a really big departure from their super literal and simple past songs, but like no it's straight up just songs that are exactly what the title says, but now it just has distortion pedal

# Hospitalised

**WanePoptoc2k18Edition** (6.5): just very by the books lowkey annoying shit. needs a max tundra mix/master to fix it and POP not FLOP

**a-man-with-a-perm** (6): I'm kinda thankful for all the short songs because eeesh sometimes the formula of these songs get a bit repetitive

**freeofblasphemy** (6): Picks up towards the end at least

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i think i’d like this more if the production didnt sound so muffled

**zukomu** (6): I don’t remember anything about this song but I quite enjoyed it I think

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): what happened during this song

**jman457** (5): Kind of boring

costalhp: These rates are so chaotic, at least when using reddit on my phone. Too much information, no wonder why not that many people join them.    
    
i give this rate a 3.5, just cause i love MGMT and this is my favorite album by them.
