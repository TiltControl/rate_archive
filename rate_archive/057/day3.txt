QustoMar: the point of that rate (which u can vote for [here](https://reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/a81ioq/rate_suggestion_voting_thread_january_april_2019/ec78pqe)) is to show that kpop can produce, full, quality, albums that r just as good as the singles

=====

Neferpitta: They are pretty rare in kpop, the only other full length albums I can think off where all the tracks are top quality are IU's modern times and Red Velvet's The Red. Maybe T-ara's absolute first?

=====

Nadismaya: Give my girls SNSD a chance and just rate the singles. Their albums are inconsistent unless we include their Japanese albums but that wouldn't be fair for a K-pop rate (and besides Pink Tape is going to win it anyway).

**selegend** (8): This, oddly enough, was the song that made Popheads interested in LOONA - the very last reveal for OT12. It's distractingly erratic, and at times flashy in all the best ways (except JinSoul's oddly-produced rap verse).

---
**1998tweety** (10): A very solid finish to the groups solo songs. Egoist is another one in the long list of bops, but this one is at the top of the list. The chorus toes the line between upbeat and sensual perfectly. I love minor details like what almost sounds like a high pitched scream. Against JinSoul's bit is great.

**AroMorbid** (10): My bias has my favorite solo song and it's not because she is my bias, but because this song is so complex and has a great message

**gannade** (10): this is honestly my favorite music video of all time. Just amazing, serves aesthetic for days

**Hyperion2589** (10): The alto vocal just fits the dark concept perfectly.

**lexarqade** (10): Ugh ending with another perfect song... We really didn't deserve this

**lilguavachan** (10): we love a moody dark pop bop

**nihilistickitten** (10): a flawless bop

**bespectacled** (9.5): This is the most creative and fresh-sounding solo of the twelve, and I'm happy they saved it for last. I'd die for jinsoul but I would've given this song a 10 if not kinda ruined by her unintelligible rapping

**arrivederci1** (9): the drop right after the first chorus had me on the floor

**jonnyd86** (9): similar vibe to Eclipse where i loved it from the first tone.. i must admit i do kind of go back and forth between loving and hating the whistling but obviously its doesnt detract that much from the song from me as i still rate it very highly overall.

**maybe9** (9): oliviaaaaaaaa

**amandapearl2** (8.6): Olivia’s voice is so deep and a little husky, it’s really beautiful. I love the lyrics of this song, the “Love myself today, let you go today” is so good. I do think Jinsoul’s rap doesn’t quite work, but it’s not bad persay. I would have preferred a 2nd verse with Olivia though. Still a great song overall and an excellent end to this journey.

**kappyko** (8.5): snapped!!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Another song that’s good but doesn’t do as much for me. I love the dark, aggressive of it though, it’s something you don’t hear a lot of from girl groups. [There is a special version of this song where JinSoul raps in English](https://youtu.be/2JZM167HEyk?t=116) but be warned, it’s pretty bad. It just goes to show that just translating a song doesn’t instantly make it work, the cadence of the rap works best in Korean.

**Luxaria** (8): Girl power, love yourself Olivia, you can do it. SOLO who?

**GroceryStore** (7.5): Best rap break/A little overrated by most fans

**dynamicity** (7): Really nice moody verses with great production but the chorus feels lacking and messy.

**musicalpets** (7): these songs are all missing ONE THING but i cant figure out what it is and i think its the fact that these choruses are so anti climactic but in general theyre good but definitely missing that

**wugggs** (7): really addicting chorus

**satanicyoona** (6.5): idk what brings me back to this song all the time, maybe it's jinsoul

**RReg29** (6): solid enough
[/r/popheads/comments/a8ysq8/the_kpop_girl_groups_singles_rate_day_3_fool_me/ecf7209/]

=====

QustoMar: tbh this could rlly be my fave Loona solo, if it wasn’t for Jinsoul’s rap (and Jinsoul is my #1 bias of Loona)
[/r/popheads/comments/a8ysq8/the_kpop_girl_groups_singles_rate_day_3_fool_me/ecf79eq/]

=====

angusaditus: Reminder that if Apink had been in this rate they would have snatched the #1 with I'm So Sick

**selegend** (10): The 80's throwback synthpop track includes hauntingly nostalgic vocals from Yves. This was what really caught my attention to LOONA as a whole, and I'm sure the same can be said for many American fans.

---
**1998tweety** (10): I do not remember this bopping as hard as it does. I adore the chorus especially the bits with the weird vocals. Def adding this one to my playlists.

**amandapearl2** (10): Another 10 because it has been my favorite song since it dropped. Like of all music. There’s something about this melody and the lyrics that I find so inspiring. The lyrics about finding a new me within me, I dunno it just really hits me.

**AroMorbid** (10): I loved this song instantly from first listen. Those "bite bite bite" voiced bits really elevate this song

**GroceryStore** (10): Favorite solo song and member

**heeyeon** (10): i would give this an 11 if i could

**Hyperion2589** (10): Soultronica invented.

**lexarqade** (10): Eclipse is probably gonna win but this is my FAVOURITE loona solo. She did THAT.

**lilguavachan** (10): it's in competition with kim lip's, haseul's, olivia hye's, and jinsoul's for my "if i could give it an 11 i would", and i couldn't even tell you why i love it. it's just so... moody

**llehuty** (10): Synth heaven and powerful lyrics make this a modern classic.

**maybe9** (10): such a BOP PRODUCTION

**minsiii** (10): pure emotion GODDESS

**nihilistickitten** (10): BEST track of all of LOONA wish I could give a twelve

**RReg29** (10): perfect synths and vox, lordy

**vodkainsipido** (10): #WHY CAN I NOT GIVE THIS AN 11

**minibjork** (9.5): i'm in love w/ the 80s synthpop sound omg

**arrivederci1** (8.4): can get a little boring if you listen too much but it's still solid

**dynamicity** (8): Yves' voice is a bit too weak to carry the minimal verses, but when the instrumental swells in the chorus the song becomes breathtaking.

**jonnyd86** (8): this song grew on me, the melody is an earworm and the synths are top notch

**wugggs** (8): sounds like it could be on the soundtrack of The Wedding Singer and I mean that in the best possible way

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Objectively this is a very good song but it never quite did much for me. It just feels… thin? The choreography is iconic though.

**musicalpets** (7): this song is missing something too but i cant put my finger on it tho it sounds like dua lipa so i bet my ass this sub will love it

**selegend** (7): A doo-wop bop with one of the most memorable K-pop choruses I've heard in a while.

---
**1998tweety** (10): Chuu is so so cute ughh. This was the Loona song that really got me interested in the group. The song flows so well and the chorus is an explosion. The key change at the very end is everything and you guys better give this a high score since I know you're always talking about key changes.

**bespectacled** (10): Tied with Eclipse for the definitive best loona solos, periodtttt. Pop gay perfection. Chuu is a top 5 female vocalist in kpop right now.

**chenle** (10): i'd die for this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Is there any word for this other than iconic? I feel so sorry for Chuu because she’s never gonna be able to sing this live because it’s like, humanly impossible to do in one take, but she delivers fireworks in the studio. I know that there’s some debate over whether this song is truly a gay anthem and I’m here to tell you that it is, BBC just can’t confirm it because of homophobes but Chuu confirms it in interviews because she’s a lesbian icon. [Love will win bitches!](https://twitter.com/loonabeingays/status/979533315190542337?lang=en)

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): if this one doesn’t win the bonus rate, fuck sub lives, kay? an 11

**Luxaria** (10): A win for the gays, good music and a good MV. I love this whole song and it has been added to my rotation.

**maybe9** (10): i luv Chuu

**minsiii** (10): WHITNEY CHUUSTON

**musicalpets** (10): first time ive listened to this song and im absolutely in love

**Neferpitta** (10): This would get my 11

**SirFluffyButt13** (9.8): Easily the best of the solo songs in my opinion

**arrivederci1** (9.6): u atek mi hart

**amandapearl2** (9.5): THIS ONE’S FOR THE GAYS. I LOVE this song so much. It’s upbeat, fun, and so cute. The choreography is some of my favorite, I love dancing along during the chorus. The chord progressions are fun and complex, and Chuu is a great performer and vocalist. This is the perfect song for her.

**AroMorbid** (9.5): Lesbian icon! This song has so many parts and all of them so good!

**Hyperion2589** (9.5): Not the most favourite song in terms of variation musically, but so much emotion in the vocals.

**dynamicity** (9): The most pleasing voice in Loona with a (literal) girl crush song? Very nice. The harmonies in the prechorus and descending chromatic line in the chorus are pretty awesome.

**lexarqade** (9): Come on miss vocals!

**lilguavachan** (9): ended twice [2]

**nihilistickitten** (9): super cute

**RReg29** (9): great stuff!

**GroceryStore** (8.5): Best bridge

**satanicyoona** (8.5): "gay rights!" - chuu, 2017

**three-stacks** (8): With a lot of LOONA's individual singles, I feel like I've heard some version of them before, and I guess that's because their A&R team are really devoted students of pop and it shows. So while this song feels familiar, Chuu is such a strong vocalist that she simply owns the tune. I'm a big fan of the bridge - the choir-like background harmonies are such a classic pop trope, but it doesn't seem as played out here as it normally would.

**PostDebut** (7): BRAVE SOUND... AND GOES A LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS

**jonnyd86** (6.8): i actually really prefer Girl's Talk the b-side to this, Chuu puts in a hell of a performance here but I just think the song is kinda meh

**wugggs** (6): Chuu can sing but this song is not really compelling for me

**selegend** (9): The song everyone expected to win, the very reason we even have this bonus rate - I don't blame you guys for clamoring for this to be rated for so long - it's nothing short of pop perfection. I don't really listen to this much, but every time I do, I'm taken to another world.

---
**\_xSyracuse** (10): never forget the song that single handedly made me stan kpop

**amandapearl2** (10): because I cannot give a bonus track an 11 haha. This introduced a new style for LOONA, and in my opinion a perfect style. Everything about this is truly fantastic. Sultry and ethereal, there’s not a single thing I don’t like.

**bespectacled** (10): I'm biased coz she's my bias, but no one should disagree that Kim Lip is the all-around most talented member of loona, and she proved it in this slick, sexy pop/RnB perfection. I'm forever whipped for this girl.

**BiPolarBear17** (10): This masterpiece, which would have been one of the easiest 11s of my life, being relegated to the bonus rate is an unspeakable travesty.

**Hyperion2589** (10): Take me away into the Loonaverse dreamscape.

**lexarqade** (10): The song that brought the gays to Loona and rightly so. She KILLED this!

**lilguavachan** (10): if i could give this my 11 i would, if only because it was the one that introduced me to loona, along with singing in the rain

**maybe9** (10): legendary STAN LOOΠΔ

**Qwilphish** (10): we all know this is the winner

**three-stacks** (10): I'm not just giving it a 10 because it is by the best performer in LOONA, probably in K-Pop, possibly the world. The song has a very throwback R&B quality to it - it's really not that far away from That's the Way Love Goes - but the synthesisers add a modern twist to a winning formula. It's the same thing that makes my other favourite (Bad Boy) so good - forward momentum driven by strong, dark instrumentation. Along with that, the entire vibe of the song plays into the huskiness of Kim Lip's vocal tone, BBC is really, really good at picking the right songs for their idols.

**wugggs** (10): this song is THAT BITCH

**1998tweety** (9.5): This is nice, its very chill but the chorus is something you can def dance to. The production gives off a bit of a retro vibe which I love

**AroMorbid** (9.5): I didn't buy into the hype of this song at first, but then, it finally hit. Pop perfection. Also, I love the way Kim Lip says 'Eclipse'

**arrivederci1** (9.1): everything so perfect

**Banananaise** (9): honest to god changed the entire gotdang game

**jonnyd86** (9): from the first note of the first verse and the booming percussion i knew i loved this song.. the hook only cemented that

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): A slick and sexy r&b jam that kind of leaves me tepid? Like, LOONA tepid, so I’m still super hype, but I just don’t find this one as interesting as some of the other LOONA solos. It’s a little too straightforward, it just doesn’t have as many tricks up its sleeve.

**Johnnytoby** (8): :^(

**nihilistickitten** (8): legit AF

**RReg29** (8): shout out to a fantastic looking vid

**dynamicity** (7): This song isn't the most interesting in the world, but the production is just so lush that I can't help but get absorbed in it.

**minsiii** (7): everyone but me thinks this is their best song huh...

**satanicyoona** (4): i'm so sorry to do this to the gays but if anyone should be our representative, it's chuu. again, my apologies miss kimberly lippington.

**selegend** (10): If I had a second 11, I'd give it to this. It samples Missy Elliott's "WTF (Where They From)" and uses that sample as the basis of the track. The funky production includes a ridiculous undulating bass and some 90's hip-hop elements. The lyrics discuss falling so hard for someone that they've got you stuttering (dur dur dur dur).

**raicicle** (10): almost as good as ah yeah

---
**edmiliballs** (11): song of the CENTURY

---
**1998tweety** (10): I think this was one of the first EXID song I heard, I feel like it takes everything the group does well (slightly weirder and more experimental sounds), and blends it with upbeat and dance-able rhythms.

**40073521** (10): I would give this 11 if I could.

**agentofscranton** (10): hani's mwoga mianhande made me straight

**bluepupz** (10): I can't put my finger on exactly why I love this song so much but I just do

**Chubiski** (10): they finally let LE go off on the verses!! Solji/Hyelin sound great on the chorus

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the CHORUS! disco goodness!

**Johnnytoby** (10): How does one NOT slut drop to this

**lexarqade** (10): YES! FUCK IT UP! This song is like Up&Down on steroids and I LOVE it. EXID at their absolute peak, if they manage to top this I would be shocked.

**lilguavachan** (10): ended blackpink

**maybe9** (10): anything missy touches is gold

**MrSwearword** (10): it's like K-Pop with slight nudisco flair. Slay.

**Qwilphish** (10): Missy Elliot Kreygasm

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): Yeah this was originally going to get my 11. This song is fucking captivating. It grabs your attention with a little help from a Missy Elliot sample (it’s a sample of the mhmhmhm from WTF btw). The song then just keeps building and building until it fucking SOARS in the chorus. This song plays still with the classic EXID formula of back and forth but it works so well that you might not even really notice it at first. Also this song is fucking perfect for trying to scream the lyrics while dancing terribly. It’s a fun fucking song and it’s backed by some great vocals, a good sample, a fun beat. I fucking love this song. (I called it “all that secretly matters today” when it dropped and ranked it at #7 in my year in Kpop list last year, I think I’d rank it higher now) Also shout out to the video for being a e s t h e t i c (no shout out to the almost seizure inducing stuff tho, but just remember, it will never be as bad as T-Ara’s Sugar Free)

**skargardin** (10): HUGE BOP THIS IS IT!

**Hyperion2589** (9.5): Everything is superb but just felt short without a full length bridge.

**cyborglilith** (9): BOP

**isntit\_isntit** (9): I'm still on the "justice for every night" team, but DDD is a banger too

**Kromorei** (9): Iconic bop. The content LEGGOs were starving for. The EXID chorus is as always amazing.

**Luxaria** (9): If Ariana Grande and Janelle Monae collabed this would be the result. You're lying if you think otherwise. EXID has really matured into a good sound.

**popularsong** (9): this song feels a bit more like return to their roots but still fresh, i love it

**Qustomar** (9): im a new fan to exid so pls don't tear me apart, but this song feels like Up & Down but improved, in the best way possible lol

**gowestyoungkanye** (8.8): this is sexid. this is exid doing exid best. thank god.

**dynamicity** (8.5): Another Missy sample, another bop. The bridge is weak but the sassy verses and simmering prechorus more than make up for it.

**arrivederci1** (8.4): I think hani's vocals really shines here

**c0ns3rvative** (8): Love this track's composition and how they play around with the sample against the vocal motif before letting it fade into the back of the mix. Both the bass and the bass synth sound great and everything else is classic EXID

**jamesfog** (8): Chorus is much better than the verses, seems to be a trend in their songs

**jonnyd86** (8): straight sassy

**Mudkip1** (8): this song is braver than the us marines

**Neferpitta** (8): Finally EXID releases something exciting which doesn't sound like a rehash of Up&Down, and in traditional EXID fashion they are here to remind all men that they are worthless.

**nihilistickitten** (8): their best track

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Well, if I'm going to see another title with multiple capital Ds, I'm going to get pretty darned confused. Not that there's anything wrong with DDD, though; it's much more straightforward pop than EXID's previous songs in this rate, but the slight change in musical style makes it all the more enjoyable, especially with the solid hook that goes 'Why don't you treat my baby?'

**PostDebut** (8): The Missy Elliot sample and "Why don't you sh*t, my baby" threw me off at first lol. It's funky and fun, would deoldeoldeoldeol again.

**ttandrew** (8): bop

**wugggs** (8): a solid EXID release and I really like Hani on this track unexpectedly since I prefer her lower register

**amandapearl2** (7.6): A return to their sexy roots. LE’s rap shines.

**kappyko** (7.5): Although the chorus doesn't hit as hard, it fits the vibe unlike the weirder parts of other EXID songs. Songwriting on "DDD" is refined, production is pretty on point, the humming over the dopey house beat is fun, it's just not a personal favorite.

**original\_doll** (7.5): I love half of this song but find part of it to be really grating...

**RReg29** (7): the hot butts helped the pain of those verses…the chorus lifted this one bigly

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): That “dr dr dr dr” hook is soooo grating, which is a shame because the rest of the song is pretty great. Idk what’s up with EXID and slipping in one or two elements that spoil the track but it’s been a theme.

**MissyBee37** (5): I want to like this song but those guttural noises really grate on me.

**satanicyoona** (5): MmM HmM HMM HMm

**tinnnn\_lv** (2): pretty generic again sigh

**franch** (0): sorry i find this really annoying

**selegend** (10): Hani's fancam was a MOMENT in Kpop history and so was this song. This is so iconic that it was recorded in three languages and is still being promoted as a single today. The hip thrusting is a move for the books.

---
**onceberry** (11): One of the greatest pop songs of all time, period

---
**40073521** (10): The song the started EXID

**BiPolarBear17** (10): We love a classic.

**Hyperion2589** (10): How the public slept on this song until 8 months after release is simply criminal.

**Kromorei** (10): Hani please (censored) me.

**lexarqade** (10): When will your faves get saved from the brink of disbandment from a sexy fancam... Hani is TOO powerful anyway this shit slaps

**lilguavachan** (10): i've never listened to EXID before and oh... a bop...

**Neferpitta** (10): The original viral fancam song, it singlehandedly saved EXID's career and brought them all the way to the upper echelons of the girl group rankings when they had previously resided quite close to the bottom. The song is undeniably great so thank god that's what was playing in the fancam, although the equally great 'Every Night' might have brought them similar success.

**Qwilphish** (10): A viral hit for a reason -timeless bop

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): 위 아래 위 위 아래 위 아래 위 위 아래! I remember when this song was the talk of the fucking town. So long story short for you kids, a fancam (literally a fantaken video) of Hani performing this song brought it into stardom. Now when I say Hani, I mean it was focused on her, it wasn’t just her. But anyways, this song fucking smashed in some circles due to this. This led to EXID getting popular initial. I mean, between the fancam being damn good and the song being catchy/fun it’s not hard to see why. The song itself has a nice little structure where you go back and forth between the members. Like in the first verse you go from LE killing it with her rap to Hani getting soft with it. And then that fucking pre-chorus kicks in and it’s like WOAH. Another thing that kinda helped this song was the “point” dance. In this case it was the open and down movements followed by pelvis thrusting, idk if that’s what you wanna call it, but that’s what I think of it as. Even boy groups got in on the fun with this song (which btw, nother semi-oldie kpop fun fact, boy groups and girl groups covering each other’s’ songs, dances and all used to be a super popular thing) It’s just a fun song to make you get up and move. Also, the video is fucking cool with all of its bright colors.

**1998tweety** (9.8): A stellar track. The chorus is such pop perfection.

**agentofscranton** (9.5): for the longest time I thought that Le was saying we at it

**Johnnytoby** (9.5): Woke

**gowestyoungkanye** (9.2): remember when hani’s pelvis saved this group

**c0ns3rvative** (9): EXID's powerful vocals and fierce charisma let them pull off this brassy style better than almost anybody else. Catchy hook, great interplay between the siren sample and the percussion, amazing vocal work and anthemic choruses & bridge

**dynamicity** (9): A thumping bassline, annoyingly catchy sax riff, and LE's wonderfully distinctive vocals come together with a triumphant chorus to create one of Kpop's best hits.

**Nixon4Prez** (9): There’s a reason this song is what blew EXID up

**popularsong** (9): an iconic slap! all praise hanis fancam. why isnt Lady on the rateup though :(

**three-stacks** (9): Legendary.

**tinnnn\_lv** (9): interesting song! the intro and the chorus have such different feels

**wugggs** (9): Up&Down was THAT bitch and she got the recognition she deserved in the end

**amandapearl2** (8.6): The fancam that started it all. Fun, catchy, and sexy in equal parts.

**bluepupz** (8.5): I originally only knew the beginning part with the hip thrusts - I was very surprised when the rest of the song didn't sound like that lol

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): My knee-jerk reaction to this song was to give it a bad score but I’m glad I marinated in it for a little bit because after a few listens I started to really love it. I think the chorus and the verses are disconnected but both are good on their own.

**maybe9** (8.5): its so goofy but so good, and the drop is SO GOOD

**tapdancingpig** (8.4): Ok, that beat is perfect.

**chainedapart** (8): Thank Cthulhu for that one fancam, or else we won't have EXID today.

**Chubiski** (8): the song that saved EXID deserves its acclaim

**jonnyd86** (8): great hook and A+ pre-chorus. LE kills it (no surprise). Solji's soaring adlibs at the end are maybe my favorite moment

**ttandrew** (8): iconic

**arrivederci1** (7.9): the chorus is great but some of the verses let it down

**minibjork** (7.5): 12 leggos make some noise!!

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): It's nice to see folks over at South Korea like sax sounds opening their hits, too. Together with a very catchy refrain of 'We at it/we we at it', EXID delivers a funky song that blends Western and Eastern sounds in a pretty swell manner. It's not super unique, but it's a nice introduction to the group in general.

**bespectacled** (7): Don't really like this song but props to this for propelling EXID's career to main girl group status

**minsiii** (7): sample on point

**modotrising** (7): This song is so iconic.

**nihilistickitten** (7): cool funky production

**Qustomar** (7): WHY DONT YOU KNOW DONT YOU KNOW DONT YOU KNOW the song that truly started it all. i think this song is a great thotty bop, but i don't feel it's that good so just a 7. however, know that i will do that hip thrust like all of you when this comes on, ALWAYS

**RReg29** (7): the short sax riff is annoying but there are some fun sections in this one. Great chorus vox.

**jamesfog** (6): This sounds cheap? But the chorus is pretty good

**kappyko** (6): Okay, so what do you think you're Elvis or something

**original\_doll** (6): I know it's iconic but tbh I don't think this song is that great

**rotating3Dtext** (6): my head hurts

**Luxaria** (5): This is a weird MV omg.

**satanicyoona** (5): ty god hani

**MrSwearword** (3): more displeasing qualities than good

**Mudkip1** (1): this makes me uncomfortable

**cyborglilith** (0): what in tarnation

**SirFluffyButt13** (0): I do not know why but I just couldn't really get into the music of EXID. Just nothing really flowed well and none of their voices really stood out to me. I tried to not make the results for them terrible or anything. Night Rather Than Day was like the only good song to me. This song was the worst out of every song I listened to on this rate. Just nothing about it sounds good to me what so ever. I am really sorry if this was someones favorite :(

**Overall average**: 7.236 **// Total points:** 1157.767 

---

**1998tweety** (9.200): EXID is def one of the best groups out there. They take risks and experiment with their sounds while still keeping a wide appeal. 

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8.750): MY GIRLS! I fucking love EXID. Seriously, they’re my favorite K-Pop girl group at this moment (or well since GG went a little downhill and pretty much disbanded except for the small unit, and 2NE1 disbanded). They just make fun music. Shout out to their B-Sides for always being great and the few songs that weren’t included here (Especially Every Night) are great and I suggest checking them out. Also, if anyone is curious my bias is LE. 

**onceberry** (8.250): They have the BEST album tracks in Kpop tbh most of these title tracks don't even compare! The Ah Yeah mini is one of the greatest pop albums of all time 

**You_Will_Die** (7.917): I really like EXID, I can hear who sings what easy and they got some killer vocals. Even if the chorus don't really seem to fit the versus at first you quickly get used to it. 

**bluepupz** (7.667): Most of their songs took time to grow on me. It seems that they really like short repetitive phrases (can sometimes get old), and making their verses/choruses sound very different. Not related to their music but their MVs are so cheeky and irreverent and I love that 

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.583): I definitely like the EXID's production more than BLACKPINK's, but I kind of miss the energetic outbursts and the uniqueness of individual song from the latter group. EXID might not have that special spark, but they do deliver a little more consistently, serving tracks with a solid RnB influence that I definitely enjoy. The second group in the rate gets another thumbs-up from me! 

**modotrising** (7.217): As opposed to the last group, EXID hits all my marks. And their vocals are god tier. 

**Chubiski** (6.500): LE is the only real rapper out of all these groups, plus Solji and Hyelin have legit vocals 

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.417): Personally I only really liked one or two of the EXID songs in the rate, but I really appreciate that a group from a smaller company made it big like this. I also already had one of their albums saved to my library for some reason but I never listened to it. 

**kappyko** (5.833): Are there any other girl groups indebted to a producer like EXID? Well, asides from the entire generation of Brits working with Xenomania... I ought to get to that, but Spotify and all... 

**franch** (5.150): i just want this to be better 

**cyborglilith** (4.667): Not for me.

**selegend** (10): [Blackpink - Playing with Fire (2016)](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9e/a6/f5/9ea6f5673def1946df68deb630768c06.jpg)

**raicicle** (8): okay lisa when she starts the second verse truly truly snapped hardcore

---
**nihilistickitten** (11): literally unskippable iconic classic BEST track

---
**bespectacled** (10): How this didn't become their biggest song, I still have no idea.

**bluepupz** (10): Hands down my favorite BP song, and one of my 11 contenders. That piano riff is so good

**c0ns3rvative** (10): Iconic follow-up single... the percussion is super crisp & punchy and rightly sits right at the top of the mix all the while the ultra-melodic vocals, synths, sparkly samples and seamless transitions carry the rest of the track

**cyborglilith** (10): this is their best song

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): tbt to when this dropped and i was liek :o cause HOW DID THEY HAVE SUCH A GOOD FOLLOW UP TO WHISTLE LIke when rose does the thing befor ethe chorus, whcih is so good?? a legend. ugh its so fucking good and yall are gonna kill it. bad!

**heeyeon** (10): @yg make more songs like this for bp pls and thank

**jamesfog** (10): Top 3 BLACKPINK

**jonnyd86** (10): fantastic melody and the hook/instrumental are catchy as hell. not really a weak part in the whole thing.

**Kromorei** (10): What a giant fucking BOP. This is the song that got me hooked on BLACKPINK.

**Luxaria** (10): Rose stan coming through lads, I love this tune and the dance is good, the rap is good, the vocals are good.

**MrSwearword** (10): I'm calling this their GOAT because nothing else measures up and it has the most going for it.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): Yeah this is probably my favorite BLACKPINK song. So, this of course was their second comeback after Square One, and after the hype of that I was craving more. Sure, it didn’t fully fill my BLACKPINK craving of two great songs, but I feel like this song all on its own makes up for it. The song is just that fucking good in my eyes. First off, it’s fucking catchy. Second off, it somehow managed to combine both the badass and soft sides of BLACKPINK. Third off, even after all these years when listening to the song I still catch myself doing some of the “point” dance moves from the chorus. Also, the video is fucking stunning and I wanna steal Lisa’s fur coat.

**tinnnn\_lv** (10): a masterpiece!! was a really cohesive song

**1998tweety** (9.7): Finally, a song that snatches me completely.

**GroceryStore** (9.5): Absolute banger, genius production

**WeirdSignal** (9.5): the blackpink peak right here

**wugggs** (9.5): Also one of my all-time favorite Kpop songs. Piano riff is simple but incredible, and they sound great here.

**Akastavo** (9): some people say it generic i still really like it

**Hyperion2589** (9): Let down by the ending, lack of final chorus was anti-climatic to an otherwise banger song.

**MissyBee37** (9): Lisa's raps are fire. That is all. Actually, so are Rose's vocals.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): This was the first BLACKPINK song in the rate I liked automatically after it initially came up on Spotify. The production and transitions here are fantastic, and while Playing with Fire isn't an intense opera like Dua Lipa's Hotter than Hell, it more than suffices as a commendable Eastern version of said track.

**Qwilphish** (9): subtract 1 for terrible vocal inflections

**SirFluffyButt13** (8.7): My second fave BLACKPINK song just behind Forever Young. I wish Forever Young would have been on this rate so bad!!!

**amandapearl2** (8.5): Their best track, sounds the least like a 2NE1 reject and the most uniquely BP. The chorus is so catchy, the rap is enjoyable, and the choreo and styling goes really well, everything just works.

**AroMorbid** (8.5): A grower!

**Neferpitta** (8.5): Ugh I love Jennie's deep voice so much. This song is amazing and Lisa is allowed more than 10 seconds to go off.

**arrivederci1** (8.3): such a powerful song even if it's not upbeat like boombayah or aiiyl

**dynamicity** (8): This song sounds a bit generic on first listen, but the catchy hook and spot-on vocals make it a winner.

**lilguavachan** (8): i wish we got more of that piano in the beginning but it's a bop nonetheless

**PuggleMaster** (8): I don't remember anything from this but the production

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I love the drop and chorus in this, they have this sort of cyber-supervillain feel to them that’s really cool. The bridge is a bit of a letdown though. BLACKPINK are also toned down a little bit here, which is when I think they’re at their best. The track is unfortunately a little meandering and rests too heavily on the drop, which holds it back from being really great.

**popularsong** (7): actually had a cohesive melody there somewhere? i liked how they utilized rose's voice. probably the song i had on repeat the longest

**Qustomar** (6): i just got to a stage with this song where i don't feel like immeadiately skipping it, thats a plus!? woo!? but just the whole song sounds the same, without any sort of progression or journey somewhere, it just stands still

**RReg29** (6): not shab at all

**tapdancingpig** (6): Kind of generic, unfortunately.

**Nixon4Prez** (5): Not particularly catchy and the production is eh.

**ttandrew** (5): cute

**maybe9** (4.5): snooze fest 2011 zedd boo

**kappyko** (3): I don't fuck with this mindless grooving. Tries to accommodate their coolness with more pop aspirations but instead traps itself into this tedious constant stimulation. It's not quite as fun as "Boombayah" to justify its loudness and ends up irritating.

**Overall average**: 7.178 **// Total points:** 1148.517

**MissyBee37** (9.583): My newest favorite artists & my latest obsession. I looooooove BLACKPINK. I love everything about their sound & style and the way the members gel together as a group with balance yet distinct and complementary personalities & roles. I love the way their name and style represent both edgier & softer sides of who they are. They have brought so much joy, sass and pure fun to my pop listening in a year when so many artists are far too chill for my tastes. Lisa especially is such a stellar talent & triple threat, nailing vocals, rap and dance. Please, for the love of all music, YG, give me more BLACKPINK! 

**franch** (9.517): they're in yr area. 

**agentofscranton** (9.500): it’s so infuriating that they literally only have 4 more songs to their name other than these – fuck YG for wasting their talent 

**Glennishill** (9.417): BLACKPINK are just terrific. They have killer vocals, visuals, dances, raps and songs. The only bad thing about BP is that they only have 9 songs period. 

**1998tweety** (9.067): BP produces stellar bops, even though we might not get many. 

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.083): I'm still never going to unhear it as 'BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA, YUH', but even if the group's song production was a little too obnoxious for me at times, there's no denying how talented its members are, or how fun their small discography is to bop to most of the time. I'm interested to see more from them. 

**bluepupz** (7.450): I wish I could have more songs to figure out if I like them because so far they tend to be hit-or-miss with me. I do also love Forever Young though! 

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7.417): BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA, Look I knew going into this BP was going to be one of my higher rated groups. Because I fucking love BP. I’ve been following them since before their debut and they constantly just serve bops. Here’s to hopefully some more music in this coming year and here’s to hopefully some American success. Also, if anyone is curious my bias is Lisa. (And here’s to hoping that the new songs aren’t just the same old nine song in English) 

**Chubiski** (7.000): “2NE1 but pretty” - YG 

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.500): Seems kind of unfair to include BLACKPINK’s entire discography in the rate. 

**modotrising** (6.333): Scores might be a bit low because their style doesn't quite do it for me, but it is unapologetically theirs and I respect that very much. 

**You_Will_Die** (5.167): I kinda like the songs on the first listen but grow tired of them super quickly, lose interest second time. It's kinda like when you don't know how a movie will go it's more interesting, but as soon as you know it grows boring rewatching. I don't enjoy the music itself really, it's just surprising with 3 or 4 different genres in the same song.

**selegend** (5): Loud, annoying, and the bridge is so lazily stuffed with Michael Jackson references that it's cringe-inducing. But I love the "baby, baby, baby, baby, baby..." part, especially when Wendy wails "YOU MAKE ME CRAZY... HEY!", and it's definitely an earworm.

**raicicle** (8): irene snapped

---
**tinnnn\_lv** (11): THIS IS SUPER LIT the vocals the dance. reminds me of a korean bang bang

---
**c0ns3rvative** (10): One of RV's best tracks, there's so much about this production that could have easily become a messy hodgepodge in lesser hands but SM managed to make it really unique and goofy without any element sounding offputting. The transitions are seamless and the contrasting tempo between the vocal motif and percussion on the chorus is a total earworm. Even the MJ tribute verse is oddly endearing, especially as it fakes you out halfway through but just keeps going

**Johnnytoby** (10): A Classic.

**maybe9** (10): LIVING

**minsiii** (10): WHO THE HELL COMES UP WITH THESE BEATS AND MELODIES???? MAN!

**Qwilphish** (10): THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF PERFECTION

**1998tweety** (9.6): Somehow RV manages to pull over so many weird and crazy concepts so well. A song called Dumb Dumb sounds like something you'd find on a 6ix9ine album (RV sweetie I'm so sorry...), but instead we get a fun bop which is so wild and all over the place. Even the brass instruments peeking in at bits add so much to the song.

**wugggs** (9.5): Incredible

**Akastavo** (9): really grown on me

**Chubiski** (9): michael jackson tribute song with amazing energy. every time you feel like it’s about to end it takes it up another notch

**jamesfog** (9): I love Ariana Grande

**Luxaria** (9): This is a bop- there are dance breaks in all the right places. Plus, Irene's rap is amazing.

**popularsong** (9): that song is just so colorful just like the music video for it super fun to listen to and super catchy

**RReg29** (9): ambitious and good

**amandapearl2** (8.8): Talk about choreography! This is the high energy song I love. The distorted blatty trumpets get my all kind of excited.

**bespectacled** (8.5): This song's catchy and fun as fuck but seriously, dumb dumb into the room (i know you want it) dumb dumb all over you

**franch** (8.5): more repetitive than the super cute i want

**kappyko** (8.5): ohhh now we on the good rv shit ydig? "problem" with a sugar rush and a hint of EDM i just realized its a michael jackson rap lmfao

**Kromorei** (8.5): Rookie but if Rookie was good.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Dumb Dumb is absolutely, very gloriously catchy, and I can already tell what a scalding callout it is without knowing what Red Velvet is complaining about foe the most part. But, honestly? The song is a little too repetitive for my tastes, especially considering the chorus consists of one word said over and over.

**Qustomar** (8): i like this song but listening to it without the music video, the verses do almost feel a little barebones, and the chrouses feel shouty which im not the biggest fan of. but these r nitpicks on a really good song lol

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8): If you don’t like this song I am legally allowed to call you Dumb Dumb. Bombastic Velvet is back. This is another sound that is just in a way loud. Also the saxophone here is a really nice touch. Anyways here’s another comeback I remember. One thing I wanna point out that idk how many others will, is that on the live stages for this, during the last chorus they use fucking slap bracelets in the choreography. Which, that’s genius. Anyways, back to the song. Look this song just keeps going and going until… the bridge. The fucking MJ reference hole bridge. The entire bridge is like a giant “How many times can we drop MJ song titles in a rap?” competition. And that uhhhhh it’s jarring. I’d admit. Especially for those of you on a first listen. Heavily takes you out of it. I’ll admit, I despised it at first too. But it comes back around with an even more explosive last chorus that kinda makes up for it. Anyways, Dumb Dumb is iconic.

**ttandrew** (8): fun

**bluepupz** (7.5): Oh man the repetitiveness of the Dumb Dumb kind of kills me - otherwise, the power vocals and arrangements in the rest of the song make up for that

**gowestyoungkanye** (7.4): i hated dumb dumb then i watched like, 50 2x speed dance red velvet compilations and i had to hear dumb dumb like 50 times and now i love it :mood:

**jonnyd86** (7): downgrade because maybe the cringiest of RV's raps. hook is an earworm but almost in a bad way? my fav song is the half step Dumb dumb dumb part

**Neferpitta** (7): That Michael Jackson rap is not the gag and it went on about 8 bars too long

**dynamicity** (6.5): I'm sorry Irene stans, but her rap does not fall into the category of "not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good ya know?".

**grenjarl** (6): the chorus is weak for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Accurate title.

**Hyperion2589** (4): Very diatonic, lacking any sort of catching melody, especially in the chorus.

**MrSwearword** (4): they're committed but this got on my nerves

**selegend** (4): The song doesn't really allow any of the members to shine (except Chuu). The video was truly a moment for LOONA fans though - seeing the girls & sub-units come together for a vibrant and vivid video. Also Chuu's high note... whew

---
**AroMorbid** (11): My 11 goes to Hi High because it is a full throttle of sounds, cosmic wonders, and cuteness. It's an instant cheerer upper! LOONA is my favorite Kpop group and I am so happy to have come across them

**skargardin** (11): welp, i guess i’m about to stan loona

**tapdancingpig** (11): This is probably one of the catchiest songs in the rate.

---
**Akastavo** (10): solid gym song in a weird way

**bespectacled** (10): Such an explosive official debut (my favorite debut of a girl group in recent memory) wtf why did this not reach stratospheric heights :(((( Chuu's insane note was for naught

**BiPolarBear17** (10): This is such a brilliant combination of all the different sounds the three sub-units went for, and I genuinely don't think they could've come out with a better single than this as their official debut.

**cyborglilith** (10): that BRIDGE

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Read my [+ +] review I talk for like six paragraphs about this song.

**Hyperion2589** (10): Who needs drugs when you have LOONA to get Hi High? Name a faster paced song.

**kappyko** (10): runner up soty 2018 lbr

**lexarqade** (10): Perfect debut song but WHERE IS XX

**lilguavachan** (10): yes. just yes. [2]

**maybe9** (10): the hype queens made a hype bop, shocker

**Neferpitta** (10): This is quintessentially Loona - driving verses which manage to show off each member's charm, biting lyrics ("Love is even more cruel than college entrance exams"), a great breakdown which doesn't kill the momentum of the song, killer high notes from Chuuriah Carey and, most importantly, an infectious chorus. Stan.

**popularsong** (10): perfect debut, just leaves you feeling happy and light, chuu's high note takes me to a new dimension

**SirFluffyButt13** (10): Best song off of ++ and really shows the full group well

**franch** (9.8): HI HI HI HI HI HI HI oml the saccharine overload is my absolute favOriTe

**1998tweety** (9.7): Again getting some GG vibes from this but its fine cause it bops. I guess this was the group's first official single. I like the sound direction, its a good blend of the member's solo tracks and the current sound of kpop. The part of this track that stands out the most for me is the bridge into the last chorus. The multiple "Hi"s sounds great as the instrumentation changes.

**arrivederci1** (9.7): everything about this song is so fast. One of the fastest paces of any song I've heard and so energetic.

**Qustomar** (9.5): i cant help but love 8-bitty anime theme song like production in kpop so this song gets a love from me. one of the my all time fave loona songs love love love we r hi high now bitches, watch out. though i wish favorite wasnt released as a sorta single with video treatment, so this song couldve gotten all the hype and anticipation that was wasted on favorite

**Johnnytoby** (9.1): Its ok

**amandapearl2** (9): YES now this is what I’m talking about. After favOriTe’s release I was really worried, but they redeemed themselves! I love almost manic pace of the instrumentals, this song builds until it’s racing at a breakneck pace for the rather ambiguous finish. The choreography is so adorable, there are so many cute little bits that gives each member a moment to shine. Also Olivia’s killing part before Chuu’s spectacular high note. I love it.

**jamesfog** (9): This is a rush

**Kromorei** (9): This is it. The best song LOONA has made. It took them long enough. This song is catchy as shit.

**minsiii** (9): hope this song gets them to the top

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I have to confess that I don't really get 'stan LOONA' memes even after participating in this rate, but Hi High is the closest I've ever got towards falling into the group's bandwagon. While LOONA relies pretty heavy on bubblegum pop influences, Hi High is the best song in this rate that exemplifies the subgenre's euphoria, and it's more than a little impossible to miss a second of this absolute bop.

**ttandrew** (9): bop

**agentofscranton** (8.5): chuu’s high note is the first time I understood what it really meant to be scalped

**bluepupz** (8.5): The background synths here are great and it sounds like a fun, happy song

**chainedapart** (8.5): One of the best rookie group songs this year (though (G)I-dle had my vote in MAMA 2018)

**jonnyd86** (8.5): also a little too Gee for me to rate too highly but this does a bit better of a job IMO, the hook is catchier as are the verses

**Nixon4Prez** (8.5): Chuu’s high note is everything

**Qwilphish** (8.5): i can't believe LOONA literally invented the Hi-Energy genre

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): tbh I like their aesthetic

**c0ns3rvative** (8): Just as impressive as the other Loona singles in its instrumental quality but I do wish that the production was slightly more balanced with a beefier bass, the track can get fatiguing at the chorus when the low end gets buried beneath all the different synths and "high high" chants

**Luxaria** (8): Not as good as favOriTe but I like it. Bigger fan of LOONA as a whole than the subgroups.

**WeirdSignal** (8): super sugary, but still has that loona feel

**GroceryStore** (7.5): Solid debut, not their best by far

**edmiliballs** (7.4): not my favourite but i love the chorus

**MissyBee37** (7): Super cute.

**modotrising** (7): This song really grows on you eventually. The intro synth is so good but then it goes kinda generic. It does subvert some tropes, though. Lightly. Can't wait for them to do a darker concept.

**RReg29** (7): dose synths doe

**original\_doll** (6.5): at first I didn't this song (and video). over time it grew on me a little but for the amount of hype pre-debut this was disappointing

**tinnnn\_lv** (6): this is cute!!

**gowestyoungkanye** (4.5): this was disappointing and i am still traumatised by it

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.2): maybe my expectations were too high for this one but wow this is just eh

**nihilistickitten** (4): just too much

**wugggs** (4): missed the mark for me - really wants to be as good as Girl Front but misses the mark - tragic chorus IMO and those weird AnimalCrossing-esque garbled sped up vocal clips interspersed are cursed

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (2.5): I JUST WANNA FULLY LIKE ONE LOONA SONG UNIVERSE, I WANNA BE ONE OF THE COOL KIDS. I can appreciate the wordplay of Hi and High but just ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. It’s just hard to like the song when it’s annoying. Who knows maybe I’m still overly burnt out on the concept in literally all forms. Is this what being into kpop for 4 years, especially during the “cute girl group boom” does to you?

**dynamicity** (2): I can't find much to say about this song other than that the entire mix is shrill as fuck.

**MrSwearword** (2): the chorus is fucking annoying

**selegend** (10): Yes, it's another schoolgirl anthem, but the girls fulfil its innocence so well. Amazing music video too.

---
**1998tweety** (10): Another mega bop, something Twice is known well for at this point. The chorus is of course the part that stands out the most. I'm glad Tzuyu (my bias) got it.

**agentofscranton** (10): an iconic music video - thank u, next wishes it could be the what is love? video

**Akastavo** (10): one of my favorite songs as well

**AroMorbid** (10): Is this my favorite Twice song? I want to know...

**bespectacled** (10): A one-two punch of Twice title tracks with heart shaker, after being indifferent about this group. After the banal and sugary themes of their past songs, this song showed Twice's cynicism with love without sacrificing their brand signature and I lived for that. Plus the mv is so goooood and (is sana) gay

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): A monster bop, it’s both the best Twice song and video. Also let’s throw choreography in there too, drawing a question mark in the air? Brilliant. The chorus neatly plays to their strengths and the “call and response” structure of it makes it super easy and fun to sing along to. It lets us get an easy catharsis, neatly conveying the emotion of the song in one wonderful shout and then riding those emotions out for all they’re worth. This also might be the tightest rap verse I’ve ever heard in a song. Also, LGBT+ queens! I sometimes roll my eyes at music videos that are just movie references because they don’t adequately tie the story of the film into the message of the song, and this is the best execution of it I’ve seen.

**Hyperion2589** (10): What Heart Shaker should have been, added the missing bass and tempo variation.

**jonnyd86** (10): i love the soft tones to this song, i think its just such a pretty song which fits thematically. i think the verses are actually among Twice's best melody wise, Chae's rap break is among her best and affirms that she NEEDS MORE PARTS JYP

**Luxaria** (10): This is a banger - Jihyo is my number one in this group and she does so well. It's really a song that showcases all their talents well. (Finally

**Nixon4Prez** (10): Objectively the best Twice song

**Qwilphish** (10): Probably one of the most memorable kpop videos in a while

**SirFluffyButt13** (10): All the girls slayed in this song but Dahyun especially came in and stole this one.

**tinnnn\_lv** (10): ! honestly my favourite song out of this group. it’s like all of their previous songs but done right. the mv, the transition of the song and the dance. rly cute

**arrivederci1** (9.6): actually has a lot of emotion behind it

**MissyBee37** (9.5): Cutest love song ever? That's a tough call, but it's one of them.

**Qustomar** (9.5): if you tried to imagine what the new Twice song will probably sound like, a song like What is Love would immediately pop into your head. What is Love is quintessential Twice, it's kind of a sum up of all their singles prior into one song, and i see it as one final bubblegum-flavored song that is now being followed by gradually more mature sounds and concepts (DTNA is slightly more mature, BTZ is bubblegum asf but has the mature video, and Yes or Yes features the bubblegum production but with their deeper vocal registers and a much more mature styling)

**chainedapart** (9): Controversial group with a rocky start and ups and downs, but now has mastered their craft I guess. Yes or yes isn't here, but would have given that a 10.

**grenjarl** (9): can't put my finger on it but absolutely love the song

**Kromorei** (9): Dahyun actually ripped my wig off here. They finally gave ChaeDahMo lines!

**amandapearl2** (8.9): Another great Twice title track. This music video is my favorite of 2018. I love the references to all of the famous movies, it’s so fun (and a little gay, yes please). This song has you bopping along.

**edmiliballs** (8.9): absolutely adorable with a stunning m/v to boot

**kappyko** (8.5): dictionary definition for "love" here please add

**WeirdSignal** (8.5): the mv is super cute

**dynamicity** (8): Heart Shaker release version. The instrumental here is much fuller and more balanced, which makes the listening experience much more enjoyable.

**maybe9** (8): bop chorus zzzz verses

**popularsong** (8): lacks the catchiness of previous titles a little i didnt return to it as much as for TT and heart shaker but still very solid

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I wanna know what love is too

**Neferpitta** (7.5): This MV made me rewatch the Princess Diaries, thank you Twice for doing me a great service.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Throwback to when we rated 'What is Love?' by En Vouge! Just kidding, practically nobody remembers that rate. For TWICE's final entry in this rate, their version is fine enough - it still lacks any special elements that make me fall in love with TWICE, but it's decent enough for me to lean positive in my opinion of them.

**Johnnytoby** (7): Queens of gaybaiting

**nihilistickitten** (7): cute but childish

**satanicyoona** (7): best title track so far don't @ me, it's their most solid track and the rap section is actually enjoyable since it's so cute

**c0ns3rvative** (6): Another fairly standard TWICE song with a sugary melody and repetitive vocal motifs. I quite like the sense of bittersweet wistfulness that seems to pervade the soundscape - makes the track pop a little more compared to most of their previous material

**MrSwearword** (6): moreso plain than anything outright terrible

**RReg29** (6): not shab but that “I WANNA KNOW’ gets pretty annoying after a while

**wugggs** (5): Disappointing, but not quite as disappointing as Heartshaker was. At least it's cute

**shekeepsreceipts** (4): listening to this song feels like a sugar overdose

**BiPolarBear17** (3.5): The limp, dead arm move they do in the chorus is pretty representative of the song quality.

**gowestyoungkanye** (3): chewy in the suit is the stuff of lesbian dreams.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (1): You know I kinda liked this song when it first dropped. Now I don’t Holy shit they were trying so hard with this song it hurts. It’s almost embarrassing. It’s the same shit different all over again. Wait a minute… WHAT IS LOVE IS TRYING TO BE CHEER UP. Cutesy af? CHECK. Video that references a bunch of movies? CHECK. Well shit… that explains it all. Except part of me gave this song a chance. Oof.

**selegend** (9): Would be so much better without that distorted man voice in the instrumental, still a bop though.

---
**Nixon4Prez** (11): God this song is good

---
**1998tweety** (10): A true summer pop in every meaning of the word. This song encapsulates the fun and bounce we want in summer music, while also staying true to RV's sound and image.

**agentofscranton** (10): the summer bop 2017 needed but not the one we deserved after we made shape of you so successful

**arrivederci1** (10): what's not to like honestly?

**bespectacled** (10): New red velvet wetslicks fruit spritzers

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): upvote if seulgi sniffing the pencil

**Hyperion2589** (10): The best summer bop from RV, syncopation, great flowing melodies, perfectly quirky and upbeat.

**jonnyd86** (10): the backing track is weird but in the best kind of way. the hook is one of the catchiest of the past few years.. pure summery greatness, and Wendy absolutely slays at the end

**kappyko** (10): This would be my 11 had I never listened to Girl Front thats all i can say rn im skipping it to get to twice faster

**Kromorei** (10): I wanted to give this an 11 SO badly. It's so fucking good.

**Mudkip1** (10): i love this song so much

**PuggleMaster** (10): Probably my most played RV and personal favorite tbh.

**Qustomar** (10): POP PERFECTION !!! imagine the rpoduction of this song, but Katy Perry is singing it (in english of course), and this being released during the Teenage Dream era or smth. it would be a fucking SMASH HIT

**Qwilphish** (10): LITERALLY REVIVED SUMMER AFTER SISTAR DISBANDED

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): lollllllllllll Power Up WISHES. You can imagine the minute this fucking dropped it hit every kpop summer song playlist. It’s refreshing, it’s fun, it’s summer. But then again, this was a special summer comeback so that was supposed to happen. This is the “Red” side at some of its finest. Red Flavor manages to capture the favor that made Red Velvet stand out in the first place. Red Flavor is just a fun song. Also, it has a fun dance. You can bet your ass every time it comes on I’m up and moving because it just makes me want to. (Except for like rn because I’m not alone and also writing this) Anyways, paired with a slightly odd but fun video, (it’s only odd because of the blue oranges… you read that right) it brings the song to a highlight with main focus being on the dance and… FRUITS. (Seriously, when will your favs interview fruits)

**skargardin** (10): talented, incredible..

**three-stacks** (10): THE summer bop (to end all bops). The greatness of this song is encapsulated in the ending bridge leading into the final chorus and then the coda to end the song. It's a picture perfect study in tension and release, from the subdued, bare bridge, building with just handclaps into a triumphant Wendy-led outro - beautiful stuff.

**ttandrew** (10): iconic

**wugggs** (10): quintessential summer song, this song IS Red Velvet

**Johnnytoby** (9.6): Ugh bop

**edmiliballs** (9.5): eternal song of the summer

**original\_doll** (9.5): 👑 Summer Queens 👑

**amandapearl2** (9.4): I love everything about this song. The harmonies, instrumentals, visuals, choreo, everything. Another song with an awesome killing part from Wendy. It’s the perfect summer song.

**lilguavachan** (9): queens of fruits and flavor

**nihilistickitten** (9): strange but fabulous BEST bridge on this whole list

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Well, hey, here's a song I clearly remember hearing all the time on television back when my grandma still lived in a house where I watched it regularly. The chorus is anthemic yet again, much like this rate's best songs, and although the song's a different flavor (heh) of pop music than what Red Velvet debuted with, it's still a top-tier girl group single.

**RReg29** (9): well, that’s some good shit right there, aside from that lower pitched vocal sample

**dynamicity** (8.5): Another irritatingly catchy hook with a great chorus to boot. Wendy's bridge and outro are things of beauty.

**maybe9** (8.5): tame, but still a bop

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): that weird voice that says ‘red flavor’ is killing me

**Akastavo** (8): very warm jolly song

**Chubiski** (8): yeri’s rap is so cute

**cyborglilith** (8): love the bridge, hate the distorted man sounds

**Luxaria** (8): A cute concept I can get behind and Wendy's belt isn't out of place here. Although I'd say Irene's rap kinda is.

**minsiii** (8): satisfies my HUNGER

**bluepupz** (7.2): I hate the garbled deep vocal effect thing that they use in the background

**popularsong** (7): p safe compared to their other songs but still very catchy and upbeat

**satanicyoona** (7): the bridge is a little eh but overall it's pretty good

**tinnnn\_lv** (7): weird mv but the song is really good!

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): overrated

**GroceryStore** (6): Not my cup of tea

**MissyBee37** (6): That background "red flavor" noise ruins this song for me. It is, otherwise, quite fun. Much like a certain new song that's ruined for me by a high-note scream...

**c0ns3rvative** (5): My opinion on this has definitely soured over time, both the main sample and the DJ Mustard chanting on the last chorus are super obnoxious and they didn't nail any of the transitions. Irene's rap is pretty trash too sorry girl

**MrSwearword** (5): fails to live up to the two maybe three highlights thus far

**Neferpitta** (5): Idk why but this just annoys me. It's as basic as a girl group summer comeback can get.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I don’t really like it when Red Velvet go for a “refreshing” concept. There just isn’t really anything interesting here. The melody isn’t quite catchy and the rap verse feels like something they felt they were required to do rather than something that enhances the song. The score would be lower but the bridge is actually really nice, the more melancholic vibe with heavier vocals make the song far more listenable.

**Meepmeepmusik** (0): I have a strong hatred for this song. It irritates how the intro is the chorus, and the chorus doesn't really sound like a chorus, so whenever I hear the chorus it sounds like the song is restarting and ... idk I just ... no

**selegend** (8): This song is like a lollipop, and that gorgeous hook is the bubblegum in the middle.

---
**\_xSyracuse** (11): An absolute religious banger. The use of silence snatches my eyebrows clean off and and the harmonies sent me to nirvana. And to top it off, the intro to the song snaps my neck in seven different places. When JinSoul said "Hey Boy," I felt that on a spiritual level.

**arrivederci1** (11): Everything was so perfect about it. The strings at the beginning, the rap, the vocals. It's an artwork and masterpiece

**lexarqade** (11): Come ON. This song is fucking perfect and there is no better followup to GF than this. People with taste will give this their 11.

**modotrising** (11): This song... is it. Her class... her style... loona stans won here.

**Qwilphish** (11): THE VIDEO, THE STRINGS, THE ART i can't explain how amazing this song is. Everything is PERFECT. Hey Boy intensifies

---
**AroMorbid** (10): Odd Eye Circle is great cause their vibe is different than even more Girl Crush I've heard

**bespectacled** (10): The strings!!! The vocals!!! Jinsoul's baffling eyepatch!!! It's funny how the opening lines were "hey boy, you wanna play?" but they absolutely didn't come to play in this song

**Hyperion2589** (10): Summer Unit, Hot Unit. Sizzling.

**kappyko** (10): AND THEN THEY DO IT AGAIN THE MADWOMEN JUST BREAK INTO MY HOUSE ALREADY

**lilguavachan** (10): yes. just yes.

**maybe9** (10): sexy sexy sexy

**minsiii** (10): pop perfection god damn

**original\_doll** (10): art tbh

**Qustomar** (10): this song is 100% my favorite loona song, it's so gorgeous, and the perfect culmination of the Max & Match album which is my all time favorite kpop album

**GroceryStore** (9.5): Shoutout Uncover and Chaotic, all 9.5

**wugggs** (9.5): OEC fed us so well

**amandapearl2** (9.3): I didn’t think OEC could top Girl Front, but wow they did. This is one of my favorite LOONA music videos, the choreography is awesome. I love the slightly more mature edge, this is absolutely my aesthetic in every way.

**dynamicity** (9): The striking staccato instrumental hook ties this song together and drives it forward nicely. The chorus is a winner too.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Read my [+ +] review.

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): when you see those uniforms and hear those strings you know this is gonna be some broadway shit you hate and yet.... i love

**jamesfog** (9): Oh wow a bop

**Neferpitta** (9): Making me enjoy R&B - loona did THAT

**nihilistickitten** (9): really grew on me

**1998tweety** (8.7): Another great song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Aw, come on, why do they pronounce it as 'secret love' instead of 'sweet crazy love'? The latter is literally the title! Girl Front was decent, if unremarkable, but Sweet Crazy Love made me warm up a little more to LOONA's music; the song's nothing groundbreaking, but it's a sure pop hit after two good ballads and one average song. I was still expecting it to be a little more...manic after the title, but maybe I was assuming too much.

**Akastavo** (8): smooth track

**bluepupz** (8): I don't know how else to describe this but smooth, honestly

**Chubiski** (8): I knew it would be good from the orchestral intro

**MrSwearword** (8): doesn't have enough of a WOW factor for me, but this isn't bad

**rotating3Dtext** (8): I don’t like it when they say it’s a sweet crazy love

**RReg29** (8): another fun one (and a nice looking vid too)

**tinnnn\_lv** (8): felt it was very popish but nothing special

**jonnyd86** (7.5): love the hook and the strings

**Kromorei** (7.5): Finally a LOONA song that doesn't put me to sleep. Their subunits just suck.

**grenjarl** (7): chorus saves the song

**popularsong** (7): for some reason i don't listen to it as often but it's good

**ttandrew** (7): cute

**c0ns3rvative** (6.5): More nice production and stacked harmonies but not particularly memorable. Big fan of the subtle pitch shifting on most of the vocals, matches really well with the ethereal harmonies

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6.5): Well it’s better than Girl Front, but it still doesn’t fucking make me wanna yell “STAN LOONA ODD EYE CIRCLE” from the rooftops. This is probably the strongest LOONA subunit song to date imo. Also check out that Love Cherry Motion shoutout, I don’t remember that song being so bad but whatever. (I might have missed other loon solo song shoutouts but I had to take a call lol)

**Luxaria** (6): OEC is defo my fave but Girl Front is way better than this.

**selegend** (10): Sounds a bit too much like EXID's "Are You Hungry?" thanks to Shinsadong Tiger, but I'm sure this will be remembered as a classic for this generation of girl groups. Everything about it just screams "hit".

---
**1998tweety** (10): Honestly this was the first Momoland song so I, and many others, thought this was their debut. Although it does bear a huge amount of similarities to Mi Mi Mi by Serebro, the song is still a bop and a half. The production and chorus in particular are infectious.

**\_xSyracuse** (10): even if sung by a somewhat problematic group, Bboom Bboom snaps my spine clean in half

**arrivederci1** (10): This is just a solid bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song is singlehandedly responsible for making Momoland into an internationally known group and their very inclusion in this rate over more established groups like Lovelyz or Oh My Girl. (I’m not at all bitter.) Does it live up to the hype? Kinda, I guess. It’s definitely fun and I can totally see why it was a hit, and why they’d make the followup single a carbon copy of it. The weird thing about “BAAM” and “BBoom BBoom” is that I’m never quite sure which one I like more, usually it’s just the one that I listened to last. I think it’s because both songs, while a lot of fun to listen to, aren’t super memorable outside of select parts. There are things that I think “BAAM” does better but “BBoom BBoom” set the blueprint, so deserves prop for that. I like the verses of “Boom BBoom” better and it and will always have that part where they go “boom boom” which is what I think really sells it. It also has the better choreography, that “stomp side to side” move is genius and that move where they sway side to side with their ands in place and then send it up to their ear and then twist it around and push their arms out on “touch” is straight up one of the best moves ever put into a Kpop choreography. It’s instantly memorable and super fun to do. Also Jooe’s “GREAT” is iconic. All in all, good job.

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): the rap break is wack but this was one of my top songs this year tbh

**Hyperion2589** (10): Just makes you want to dance with the groove. One of the most iconic beat drops and unconventional bridges to a song.

**Kromorei** (10): Amazing meme bop.

**letsallpoo** (10): this is genuinely one of the weirdest songs from this year. it's like trance saxobeat but it WORKS

**lexarqade** (10): A. Fucking. BOP! Literal perfection and I am so glad they skyrocketed into popularity with this. Literally the kpop song of 2018.

**maybe9** (10): what instrument is that, i need one

**Neferpitta** (10): An utter bop. The kind of song that is annoying to listen to now because I overplayed it so much when it came out.

**tinnnn\_lv** (10): isn’t this some mimimi song lmao but if it is a sampled track they did mimi i justice and took away all the cheesiness but maintained the catchiness

**rotating3Dtext** (9.8): I’m having a sensory overload

**bespectacled** (9.5): A high score considering I'm from a country that overplayed and over-memed this song to death. Of course I hate it now, but when it was good, it was REALLY good

**Qwilphish** (9.5): the snares ssssss too much

**Akastavo** (9): too catchy

**cyborglilith** (9): why is the title like that

**dynamicity** (9): An obnoxiously catchy pop number with a top-notch chorus and an expertly timed trap break. My only gripe is the irritatingly loud and ever-present snare that you can't ignore once you've noticed it.

**gannade** (9): the bridge slaps

**jamesfog** (9): That hook is great

**Luxaria** (9): Hello Korea's entry into Eurovision (side note: I'd kill for a K-Pop showcase at Eurovision). I was kidding when I first wrote that down but now I'm 100% serious, this slaps and WOULD WIN.

**minsiii** (9): such a mood lightener damn

**nihilistickitten** (9): undeniably catchy

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I was shook when this came on on our playlist, simply for the fact that I've heard it a million times before. I guess this was a hit in Asia! Though MOMOLAND doesn't seem to have much to offer otherwise, BBoom BBoom is one of the strongest EDM-inspired tracks in the rate, succeeding perfectly in delivering the sorts of hooks that are catchy enough to make you forget you're listening to a song in a foreign language you don't know how to speak.

**RReg29** (9): GREAT!

**vodkainsipido** (9): honestly nearly perfect

**bluepupz** (8.5): This is an earworm, plain and simple. The brass is great, though I could do without the jarring rap breakdown at 1:38

**Qustomar** (8.5): this song may not be the best, but there is a certain, "number one hit", factor to it you can't describe

**skargardin** (8.5): the bops just keep coming aah

**three-stacks** (8.5): Fuuuuuun.

**wugggs** (8.5): I do resent Shinsadong Tiger for recycling the beat/intro from EXID's NyamNyamJeopJeop on this song but I can't deny it's an absolute banger

**AroMorbid** (8): Viral and fun!

**Chubiski** (8): it’s like 3 generic 2017 songs melted into one, but surprisingly it works.

**heeyeon** (8): for the chorus, the rap break can go

**jonnyd86** (8): a song that even after you are sick of it you can't help but bop to.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8): Okay so I have one problem with this song and this is maybe a unique problem but hear me out… Whenever this song starts I always think it’s gonna EXID’s Are You Hungry until the beat kicks in. Anyways it’s hard for me to believe that this was literally this year, it already feels so old. Tells you how long of a year it has been. Anyways this one first came to my attention after music shows and the energy exuded from the girls on music shows while promoting this song. But other than that, I only knew MOMOLAND as the JooE group. Now for those that don’t know why this is, two words, TROPICANA SPARKLING. That’s right I got to know this group through a fucking advertising campaign one of the members was in because it was a fucking meme. Anyways, this song bangs. Maybe goes on a bit longer than it should but oh well. It’s a fun time to attempt the dance and fail.

**ttandrew** (8): iconic

**kappyko** (7.5): im biased bc its one of the first kpop songs i cared abt but its also good okay. the video with them taking a bff test is s ocute. the mixing kinda hurts my ears though is that just me? a part of the percussion is too high pitched and it kinda feels like tinnitus but i never had this problem before so im chalking it down to fatigue. where my asians that actually live in asia gang. + FILIPINO GANG YAAAS

**BiPolarBear17** (7): When this was first released, one of my friends adored it and took it upon themselves to learn the choreography. Cut to a few months later, it comes on and I look at her expectantly, but all I can see is her soul slowly departing from her body as she sighs disappointingly, and I think that's an accurate enough representation of how I feel about this song now. A great fun catchy track that has just been overplayed into the ground, so I'm giving it a nice score even though I'm ready to defenestrate myself every time I hear those opening guitar strings.

**grenjarl** (7): can't stand the rap which sadly brings the score down

**MrSwearword** (7): right idea sound wise, but lacks proper oomph for full marks

**popularsong** (7): they won i guess. very catchy. rap break sucks

**amandapearl2** (6.5): I’m not on the momoland hype train. This song is fun, but I don’t really get why it’s as popular as it is. For the viral hits on this list this is my least fave.

**c0ns3rvative** (6.5): Outstanding eurodance production derailed by the worst rap ever, everyone go listen to the rap removed version

**GroceryStore** (6): Heard it way too much, but initially liked it

**WeirdSignal** (6): it's alright, got a bit old eventually

**modotrising** (4): I actually don't mind this song, but I like it only because I already like Me Me Me. It annoys me that this song depends on my love of the other one.

**PostDebut** (4): Mi Mi Mi outsold

**satanicyoona** (4): GREAT!

**chainedapart** (0): Nothing against Momoland but their producers ripped off a whole song (Mi Mi Mi - Serebro), not just chords/lines/but the whole song, and they called them out for it too. Other artists rip off several songs too, but not to this extent..

**selegend** (10): Honestly, I always thought that the best part of this was the killer instrumental, and it wasn't until this rate that I learned that the instrumental is from a [$5 Future Bass sample pack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i3ImYBBxvY&feature=youtu.be&t=30) that itself samples [Streamers by Wave Racer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LSm6pUdldk). So the producers of "Girl Front" actually sampled a sample, and added a different sample in the post-chorus (which you might notice was also used in [(G)I-DLE's "$$$"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypspani4FcM)). But what makes this track more than just some samples is the everlasting bubblegum flavor left by the girls' sugary vocals and that monstrous hook. CoOoOoOoL!

---
**BiPolarBear17** (11): Hopefully other people have gotten their essays out to explain why this is a modern day masterpiece because I'm struggling to put it into words that do it justice. All I can say is that every time the chorus hits, my 2 remaining brain cells get knocked right out of my skull.

**GroceryStore** (11): Greatest girl group song I ever heard. Play the MV on a loop, with a 4K screen attached to my tombstone for eternity

**Hyperion2589** (11): There's simply no other pop song more addictive than this one.

**kappyko** (11): The song that made me realize that the K-pop girl group format was maybe one worth looking into? It's unmatched in pure energy and synergy, all of these girls are fucking great alongside this propulsive beat

---
**agentofscranton** (10): odd eye circle is my favourite LOONA subunit entirely because of this song (that and Max and Match is a perfect album)

**AroMorbid** (10): This song hypes me up! So excellent and fun to sing along with.

**bespectacled** (10): To me, this cemented odd eye circle's status as the best sub-unit. This sub-unit had the perfect amount of talent, swag and good song selections that I could see them being strong enough to debut on their own. This is an extremely brilliant and refreshing song and I feel bad not giving a fuck that it was sampled from a youtube video without explanation lol. (P.S. This is still not the best OEC song though, it's Loonatic, which is an 11)

**jonnyd86** (10): pure ecstacy from start to finish.. the hook is A+, the menacing drop the first time you hear it is a WTF? moment but it works, and also gives the song a bit of an edge.

**letsallpoo** (10): a fucking masterpiece and if this isnt the highest loona song then i will be contacting the authorities

**lexarqade** (10): I just wanna say the months leading up to this were so insane. Like, we got the triple threat of Eclipse/SitR/LCM, then we go insane over the teaser, we discover the demo song and freak out, and then everyone collectively shits themselves over the song/MV and flawless mini. Baby I'm FOOL.

**maybe9** (10): why i stan LOOΠΔ, its a hype bop

**MrSwearword** (10): like if Super Mario Bros got a KPOP makeover soundtrack wise; I'm in favor of this

**Neferpitta** (10): The way all three of them reference their solo songs in the same verse? That's the genius that should inspire you to stan loona.

**nihilistickitten** (10): BEST track addictive AF

**onceberry** (10): Would have got my 11 if Up & Down didn't exist

**Qwilphish** (10): DO I NEED TO EXPLAIN

**WeirdSignal** (10): where the oec solo stans jumped on smh

**wugggs** (10): Miss Kimberly Lippington really snapped here

**jamesfog** (9.5): YAS! We love a modern bop. This, New and Eclipse are the only LOONA songs I come back to. Sorry LOONAtics!

**three-stacks** (9.5): Deceptively simply, but full of really pleasing melodic choices (like the vocal ornamentation in the "Cools" and the "WoOoO", and the dissonance on the "neoro gadeuk" line in the chorus).

**bluepupz** (9): Starts off strong and stays at that upbeat level of energy, which is great!! I don't like the low-pitched garbled transitions at 1:08 and 2:10, though

**cyborglilith** (9): bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Read my [+ +] review.

**Luxaria** (9): I think Odd Eye Circle might be my favourite sub group

**minsiii** (9): OEC are in line to dominate the dance music genre of kpop JEEZ

**popularsong** (9): just a really good upbeat song, probably oec's best

**1998tweety** (8.9): This sub-unit is working a lot better for me. The chorus has a lot more punch and is way more memorable.

**amandapearl2** (8.9): I love everything about this. I love how high energy it is, the choreo is excellent especially on the chorus, and I love the chord progressions throughout.

**Qustomar** (8.5): love this song but lowkey finding out how much of it is the same as its sample ruined it a little. BBC got SCAMMED !!!

**c0ns3rvative** (8): Nicely balanced, full production and 3-part harmonies throughout with some really interesting production choices to boot. The contrast between the rapid-fire synths on the first verse and the piano on the second verse in particular sounds fantastic. Not a big fan of the vocal sample though

**ttandrew** (8): bop

**dynamicity** (7.5): This song has a really interesting melody that never really goes where you expect it to. It makes the song exciting but can also feel a bit annoying at times.

**Chubiski** (7): the “I’m with you” sample throws me off

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): The memes aren't living up to the hype all that much so far...Girl Front is an alright song, but I can't help but be a little bored by it. I've tried to warm up to the track, but I'm just not big on LOONA's dynamic here, or how disappointing the hook is: it's basically just an extended 'oooooo'. It definitely doesn't make for bad listening, and it's still above average, but I'm craving for more.

**RReg29** (7): fun little bop

**Kromorei** (6.5): The difference between the snoozefest of 1/3 and this is insane. It's still boring and not a standout, a trend with LOONA.

**satanicyoona** (6.5): stan loona

**grenjarl** (6): singers are good, but instrumental is weak

**tinnnn\_lv** (6): hmmm 6

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (5.5): Oh hey this is not super cutesy subunit. Or so I thought…. Look, this song feels like it’s kinda trying in some areas to be badass (the drop, the rap) but it just… falls flat. Overall, it’s a meh song. I can’t really see myself revisiting it. But I wouldn’t be too pissed if it came on. Like I probably wouldn’t change it if I wasn’t paying attention. Also, the video is really fucking vibrant, I like all the colors. Also come thru converse crew. (Also depending on where this places in the rate, take note the desert in this video is the same one in the Ice Cream Cake video, which I probably will (have) talked about more there.)

**gowestyoungkanye** (4): when the best members have one of the worst songs..... thats real sad huh :/

**kappyko** (9.714): can you tell i skipped most of these songs to get to the other ones quicker? but i've listened to several of these songs before, especially red velvet and blackpink, but loona remains the only ones im confident enough to evaluate without having to look 

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.214): Read my *[+ +]* review. 

**onceberry** (9.157): They will be the first artists to perform in outer space, mark my words! 

**1998tweety** (8.971): The sub-units can be hit or miss but when they all get together they make magic. I'm looking forward to what the whole group will do in the future. 

**franch** (8.757): STAN LOONA oh my god i never got around to listening to this and i almost took my 11 back from my first love 

**cyborglilith** (8.643): As much as I hate the phrase sTaN lOoNa, I admit that it's good advice. 

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.286): I can actually see why LOONA appeals to a ton of people, even music fans who aren't big into K-Pop. Every member seems to have an interesting, engaging dynamic, and the mythology behind the group is really interesting, especially compared with some other artists in this rate. Their group songs don't do much for me, though. I was expecting pop perfection from how much folks spam 'stan LOONA', but I only got above average music. 

**bluepupz** (7.886): I was pleasantly surprised by how many of these songs I liked. I still think their MV theories/universe and all that are too complicated for me, but I like the range of styles they've tried. 

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.100): Eclipse outsold 

**You_Will_Die** (4.286): Not a fan of them, had a hard time to differentiate singers from each other. Songs mainly follow the same format in the same pitch with the same instruments. 

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (3.357): Kpop sin of the year, I have yet to find what everyone sees in LOONA. It’s a cool concept I’ll admit, giving all the girls solos/subunits then debuting as a full group. But besides that, the music just hasn’t been too big on me. Sorry Orbits.

You_Will_Die: Having one song that is slightly different when the ratings has 7 songs for some reason even though the group is small compared to the others does not make it better. My head almost hurt during the majority of their songs, this was a rating thread and I did it honestly.  I really don't like them.

**selegend** (9): Would be a 10 without the synth that goes up and down throughout the WHOLE. SONG. The synth is off-beat on the last chorus, and I can't help but notice that every time I listen. Still, the production is spectacular, and I feel like this firmly established TWICE's lyrical and musical sound since then.

---
**Glennishill** (11): One of the greatest kpop songs ever. It’s fun and catch with an insanely great dance.

**Neferpitta** (11): A modern Kpop masterpiece. This will be remembered in the same breath as the likes of Gee, Roly Poly, Ring Ding Dong etc.

---
**SirFluffyButt13** (11): Literally one of the best songs ever created. I found out about Twice this year on September 30th when a tweet talked about how all throughout October they would be living that music video. Just everything about this song is amazing and the video amplifies it to a level I cannot even put into words. Not finding Twice sooner has became one of the biggest regrets in my life. It has literally changed my life and has made Twice like one of my all time favorites. Easily the best K-pop group out there in my opinion.

**1998tweety** (10): Obligatory 10. This is probably Twice's most iconic track and deservedly so. This song is super memorable and catchy.

**Akastavo** (10): one of my most listened to songs of all time

**arrivederci1** (10): one of my favourite twice songs ever

**bluepupz** (10): Also just iconic, tbh

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): had we done this rate before i'd ever listened to Red Velvet, this would've been my 11. won't be mad if it wins, it totally deserves

**Hyperion2589** (10): Super catchy chorus this time backed by great harmony and a lot more dynamic instrumental backing track

**Johnnytoby** (10): ughhhhh Yes

**jonnyd86** (10): there's nothing i dislike about this song. i love the prechorus BANG and the actual hook is perfection, something about turning a text emoticon into a concept for a song is ingenious. simultaneously asian and cutesy as well as clever.

**MissyBee37** (10): Cute, cute, cute. A super fun crush song.

**WeirdSignal** (10): I don't see Twice topping this tbh

**wugggs** (9.8): Incredible, but missed 0.2 points because of the constantly repeating up and down synth drone throughout the whole song that once you hear, you'll never un-hear it

**BiPolarBear17** (9.5): The TT jumped out

**dynamicity** (9.5): Far and away Twice's best song. The warm and bouncy instrumental makes the song feel like a dance-floor jam and fireside listen at the same time.

**amandapearl2** (9.1): The song that really cemented Twice as the top girl 3rd gen group. This is the epitome of catchy. The dance is easy to learn, it’s fun and cheesy and perfect.

**c0ns3rvative** (9): Easily the best TWICE song, the heavy dance synths add really nice rhythm & texture and the big sliding sine synth in the left channel is one of the more unique production choices that I've heard in pop. My only real complaint is that the pre vocals sound so processed to the point of being inhuman

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): the only good twice song, goodbye

**GroceryStore** (9): I don't think they can ever top this song

**kappyko** (8.5): why isnt k/da in this ratae i like the uk beat also dont ever talk to rai about this song

**AroMorbid** (8): I'm pretty sure this is their biggest song and while I like it, there are so many other great Twice songs I enjoy more

**bespectacled** (8): A cute song destined to be their biggest hit the second the rhythm kicked in but it's kinda annoying now

**Luxaria** (8): I love their voices, they all have their own perks. Also Dayhun's rap in this one is cute. Also: TWICE, Queens of picking MV concepts solely so they can all dress up however they want, even if they aren't connected. Disney Stans welcome.

**popularsong** (8): had it not been for the annoying wooooooo sound going up and down in the instrumental driving me nuts would be one of their best

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8): Look it’s the only other TWICE song that matters. But I’m going to ruin it for all of you wooooooooooo ^wooooooooooo wooooooooooo ^wooooooooo that’s the slide whistle like sound all throughout the background of the song kids. Enjoy it because now you’re never going to unhear it. Anyways this song is just cute fun in the not overly cute style TWICE has somehow never lost from debut except for like 3 songs but still. Like it’s still cute but not like overly in your face. IDK how much sense that makes, someone might disagree, idk. Anyways what makes this fucking memorable of course is the match point move of the TT under their eyes upon the line “I’m like TT”. Okay that’s all.

**Kromorei** (7): I'm so tired. Maybe it's because of overplay but this song is actually so unlistenable for me right now.

**minsiii** (7): this is the song that got me into kpop but reflecting back on it it isn't their best song

**Qustomar** (7): POP PERFECTION until you hear that slide whistle sound which ruins the song completely. before the slide whistle discovery, this would have been a 10, maybe even 11, but ugh that sound ruins the entire song :(

**ttandrew** (7): bop

**MrSwearword** (6): good beat that's wasted on a confused sounding song

**nihilistickitten** (6): good chorus

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): It’s not a Halloween song. Just because it has a Halloween themed video doesn’t mean it’s a Halloween song. This is a pretty important song for TWICE’s rise to stardom but I actually think it’s one of their weaker title tracks, the chorus and hook aren’t quite the ear worms they want to be and the verses kind of get lost, which is a shame because I think they’re the best part. I think it’s because those synths overwhelm everything, it makes it hard for me to really latch onto any other element of the song because they just feel soupy. It has some neat ideas that later TWICE songs would do better, “Likey” in particular really feels like a more refined version of this.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): I'm sorry, guys. This is a decent enough song. I had no clue what TT meant until now...apparently it's supposed to emulate the T_T emoticon. Well, my classmates sure didn't understand the intent, then; the Filipino word for dick is...titi, so my classmates kept on singing this as 'just like titi' for months and it was disgusting. So, I hate this.

**RReg29** (5): pretty KIDZ BOPish but has a few decent moments

**tinnnn\_lv** (5): not too bad, a good pop song but falls flat for me

**franch** (4): back to repetitive-annoying

**lilguavachan** (4): i mean... it's a fun song but it's not a good song

**Qwilphish** (4): I will never understand to universal love for this song

**maybe9** (2): Peek-A-Boo is the halloween song, this is yuck

**selegend** (10): This is truly the peak of their sound. It's scathing in the way it discusses the lack of transparency and humanity social media has, but the message is so eerily masked by the cheerleading vocals and the house instrumental.

---
**agentofscranton** (11): it's just pure joy and happiness in just over 3 minutes, what's not to love? plus dubchaeng's rap break is one of my favourite musical moments

**cyborglilith** (11): It's just impossible to stop singing this once you start, even if you don't know Korean.

**impeccabletim** (11): WOO! A FUCKING SERVE!! I even got my cousin’s boyfriend to do the dance. That’s how you know it’s catchy. I have zero regrets.

---
**1998tweety** (10): I forgot just how big of a bop this was. Extremely catchy chorus, a surprise pre-chorus when it felt like we we're going into the chorus, the trap influenced rap verses. This song has it all.

**AroMorbid** (10): My favorite? Is it my favorite? I don't know. I love Twice!

**gannade** (10): a guilty pleasure

**Glennishill** (10): I absolutely love this banger.

**Hyperion2589** (10): Great variation in rhythm between different lines distributions, catchy but not overly repetitive, and a dance break in a Twice song huh.

**Johnnytoby** (10): 👍

**jonnyd86** (10): i likey the guitar at the beginning, i likey the chorus, i likey the rap break, i likey the pre chorus, i likey the dance break, i likey it all

**Kromorei** (10): I'd pop my cherry to this song. It's so fucking good.

**letsallpoo** (10): a harrowing depiction of our relationship with social media wrapped up in a upbeat bop. if you gave this less than a 10 you are obviously stupid and should not have done this rate

**onceberry** (10): BB CREAM PAPAPA

**Qustomar** (10): POP PERFECTION

**three-stacks** (10): Plays to all of TWICE's strengths - sweet without being saccharine, playful without being childish, catchy without getting too annoying (yes, even the BB Cream part).

**wugggs** (10): Their best release to date, quintessential Twice

**Neferpitta** (9.5): This comes close to but doesn't quite reach the catchiness of TT, but makes up for it with its poignant lyricism.

**amandapearl2** (9.3): Sweet, pretty, and lovely. This song is so adorable. Like the musical embodiment of a pretty girlfriend.

**Akastavo** (9): me likey likey

**chainedapart** (9): Can't go wrong with a bop with easy to remember lyrics and choreo

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): A common thread with TWICE songs for me is that I generally find them grating and insufferable on the first listen but then get over that and just have a fun time. This song can also put an end to all of those “What are some songs that sound happy but are actually sad?” threads. Despite the bright melody and annoyingly catchy refrain of “ME LIKEY LIKEY LIKEY,” the instrumental is always a little bit heavier and darker in a way that is just out of step enough to be a little unsettling, and the girls give surprisingly nuanced performances.

**Luxaria** (9): The prechorus (or hook or whatever the "bb cream up ba ba" just elevates this song, feels less repetitive than Knock Knock or Signal which makes it so much more attractive. Also the rap bit is a good break and actually helps build anticipation for the final bit, which is rare in K-Pop, which seems to like to throw in raps wherever sometimes.

**minsiii** (9): look I know it's just an earworm to most people but like SNSD's gee there is something very subtle going on that pushes it beyond

**modotrising** (9): I have no clue why I love this song so much but I do.

**Nixon4Prez** (9): I <3 dabhyun

**popularsong** (9): feels like a quintessential twice/bep song. catchy and fun. the rap part actually fits in and even feels like a highlight

**Qwilphish** (9): so fun so great

**SirFluffyButt13** (9): I love Momo's cute little part in this song.

**gowestyoungkanye** (8.6): okay i have a TAKE on likey so settle in. likey is a good song, yall just don’t have taste. done! i really love the lipstick pa pa pa and rap breaks but like the rap break was too short which is real sad

**dynamicity** (8.5): Jay Park likey.

**maybe9** (8): its ugly, but fun enough where it gets a pass

**nihilistickitten** (8): their best track

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): it’s like, so sugary I have diabetes now

**c0ns3rvative** (7): Lots to like here, that initial horn is an instant earworm, the ethereal backing harmonies on the chorus sound fantastic and the overall production maintains a classy synth-driven vibe throughout. The little trap refrain is also surprisingly fun

**MissyBee37** (7): I want to love "Likey," but something about it is not for me. Yet it's so catchy.

**RReg29** (7): solid, catchy bop

**vodkainsipido** (7): i initially gave this my 0 but poo convinced me it wasn't that bad and honestly it isn't

**edmiliballs** (6.7): falls a little flat compared to most of their other singles but i can still enjoy it

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I originally gave this an 8 back when this was the only TWICE song not named Cheer Up I actually had the luxury of remembering, but after listening to this again, I can conclude that, egads, it's worse than I thought! The 'likey, likey likey' chorus is memorable, of course, but that doesn't mean it's not annoying as shit.

**tinnnn\_lv** (6): once again an okay pop song

**kappyko** (4.5): fart opening synths? children's vocals? weird hamtaro sounds? the ugly ass "mama" part? it shouldnt be good. good thing it isnt. i feel like im being yelled at as twice tease me. they do not likey likey me. we are all scum to our overlords, twice. god asave us all

**bespectacled** (3): Another corny cheesy song only saved by Momo's jaw-dropping dance break. Can they come up with something else, can they come up with something else.

**satanicyoona** (2.5): momo's bb cream papapa won't hide that ugly brass section

**MrSwearword** (1): just NO here...

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (1): Me do not likey this fucking song.

**Overall average**: 7.426 **// Total points:** 1188.206

**Glennishill** (10.000): TWICE are the goddesses of pop. It’s their world and we are just living in it. Every song is better than the last. Their members and videos are incredible and their dances are to-die-for. They are perfect bubble gum pop in a world currently obsessed with chillbops. 

**1998tweety** (9.550): Twice are known for their big bop singles. Although they can get a bit repetitive and stick to the same safe stuff, its good and thats what matters. 

**cyborglilith** (9.363): Why are all their songs except Dance the Night Away so irresistible? 

**MissyBee37** (8.938): I don't care for "Likey," the first TWICE song I heard, but I'm glad I wound up giving the rest of their discography a chance because I adore them now. Their first albums especially have a lot of filler IMHO, but their hits are sooo fun & catchy, and I adore their personality as a group. They're just so joyful & that bubblegum pop essence that I live for! 

**bluepupz** (8.037): I feel like it'd be fun if they tried out a new concept sometime, but for now it seems like they just stick to making really catchy pop, which I don't mind. 

**Chubiski** (8.000): i’ve never listened to their bsides but their singles are top tier. they may be formulaic, but it’s the same damn catchy formula that’s irresistible 

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.125): So if TWICE is the nation's girl group...I'm not sure what that says about South Korea. I like some of their entries here well enough, but all in all the group seems a little too cookie-cutter to me to make a lasting impact. After their fantastic namedrop on their first song, there are no special moments in their music that've shone out to me, and I'm just not super motivated to explore their work further. 

**franch** (6.812): sorry i don't get the hype 

**You_Will_Die** (5.938): What drags down the scores here are similar to Red Velvet, the choruses are soooo repetitive. I like the verses in most songs and the ones I put high scores are basically only carried there by their verses. 

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (3.250): TWICE TWICE TWICE TWICE... PLEASE MAKE A DIFFERENT SONG FOR ONCE

**selegend** (9): Fittingly so joyful it's incredibly eerie.

---
**bluepupz** (11): I knew going in that this was going to be hard to beat for my favorite. Something about this is so insanely addictive in the best way

**Luxaria** (11): A masterpiece. Catchy AF, Yeri and Irene killing it with their raps, the rest of them knocking out the park with their vocals. The extra effects throughout the songs oh my god. The MV is the best I've seen, Red Velvet could murder me and I'd be thankful for the time I got to spend with them.

---
**1998tweety** (10): Another track that feels like a good blend of Red and Velvet. The song stuck with me a lot cause of its super catchy verses and chorus.

**AroMorbid** (10): I love this song! It's got a great, consistent dark theme

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): invented satanism

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The song that got me into Red Velvet, and probably one of the best showcases of the strength of their concept. The creepy intro, the muffled bass and twitchy synths that permeate this track, plus there are so many fantastic details interspersed throughout this song! It creates this amazingly unsettling mood that drags the girls’ vocals down into a place that they might not otherwise go with a love song. The swirling sounds of the pre-chorus and bridge create this wonderful forward drive that makes it feel like we’re spiraling closer and closer to some sort of sinister climax. It starts to I would watch a full length movie of the music video.

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): UGHHHHHHH I WANT TO GIVE THIS AN 11 SO BADLY YOU DON’T EVEN KNOW BUT BLACKPINK IS ALSO AN 11 AND I THINK IT’S MORE LIKELY TO WIN SO I’M BEING A DUMB WHORE AND PICKING BLACKPINK WHICH IS REALLY A METAPHOR FOR RED VELVET’S CAREERS!!! like i said i get into kpop in like cycles, i don’t really follow releases then i watch one (1) good one and get obsesssedddd and peekaboo, wow. this song... it’s worth obsessing over. the mv is absolutely incredible in every single way. RED VELVET GAVE US FUCKING PIZZA DELIVERY BOY SERIAL KILLERS. ARE YOU REALLY GONNA TELL ME THAT’S NOT INNOVATION!! IT’S INNOVATION! ! IT’S PROWESS!! UGHHHHHH THIS SONG IS SO FUCKING GOOD AND THIS MV AND WHEN SEULGI’S LIKE ‘A FOX THAT WANTS TO HAVE FUN, THAT’S ME’ GIRL LET ME TELL YOU......DEAD. igh i know i should just give this an 11 god don’t ! me

**Hyperion2589** (10): Heaps of modal mixture and interesting chord progressions. One of the only times a minimalistic chorus that actually fits the thematics of the song.

**Johnnytoby** (10): Rip Jurina

**Kromorei** (10): Another stellar red velvet bop.

**maybe9** (10): i need Red Velvet to step on me

**Mudkip1** (10): wtf this SLAPS

**PuggleMaster** (10): queens of murder

**tinnnn\_lv** (10): not a fan of edm but really like this!! the mv was really cool and i can find myself definitely listening again

**amandapearl2** (9.7): Excuse me. This song is perfection. It’s just the right amount of weird. The rainbow styling is literally my favorite thing on earth, I am the biggest sucker for rainbow clothing. The choreo is amazing, and I love the drop into the really sparse chorus. The music video is perfection. Just everything is perfect. Also: Joy.

**jonnyd86** (9.5): love the frenetic energy of the hook, i think the rhythm of the verses is really catchy too.

**Neferpitta** (9.5): Where were you when Joy gave the straights everything they wanted?

**Qwilphish** (9.5): never has murder been so fun

**kappyko** (9): i forgot that i loved this

**lexarqade** (9): Queens of killing pizza boys

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Pikachu? Is that you? Seriously, though, Peek-a-Boo sure was a refresher. It harkened back to the sort of catchiness of Red Velvet's first few songs in this rate, while keeping the quality their last few entries lacked. The chorus here is the kind that gets stuck into your head the first time; it's accompanied by a beat any piano player could imitate, and it's fun as hell.

**PostDebut** (9): It kinda already sounds dated but it's still FINE FINE FINE FINE FINE FINE FINE FIIIIIIIIIIINE

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9): Did I think the song was going to be horror movie like upon first teasers? Yes. Do I still want Yeri to shoot me in the face with that crossbow? Yes. Do I still want Irene at all times to step on me, especially with this comeback? YES. Am I here for kidnapping pizza guys? I mean… if I can get free pizza outta it… Anyways this is one of those “Red Velvet” songs, you know where they combine both sounds. Yeah it fucking worked, this is a smash in my book. Another dance track, of course. All the girls get a chance to shine, it’s fun. Also this whole era (And the repackage) are fucking a e s t h e t i c. I’m here for badass pizza guy kidnapping RV. (Dumb dumb sidenote, I like to think in the video they are witches that kidnap pizza guys to get free pizzas. Also uhhh piano candle circle bullshit is their odd ritual (shout out uhhh one of the best scenes on tv this year btw, come thru blood ritual) that they do to summon pizza guys, other than like, ordering pizza.)

**Qustomar** (8.8): it's a cute song but is overshadowed by some other songs on the perfect velvet album, namely I Just (/r/popheads users would love I Just) and Kingdom Come

**GroceryStore** (8.5): Favorite concept

**wugggs** (8.5): Really good if not a little too sparse at times

**c0ns3rvative** (8): All the production elements here sound so purposefully placed. The percussion especially stands out with the massive kick only really being accompanied by some syncopated snaps and claps throughout the whole track

**edmiliballs** (8): i can't believe jake paul is fucking dead

**nihilistickitten** (8): quirky sexy kick ass

**ttandrew** (8): bop

**Akastavo** (7): not my favorite title track but still quality

**bespectacled** (7): I hated this so much when it came out but it's tolerable now

**modotrising** (7): We love a murderous lesbian cult!

**tapdancingpig** (7): Ugh, trop pop. I mean, I’m still bopping, but that doesn’t mean the genre is good again.

**dynamicity** (6.5): RV continuing their quirky cute and creepy Halloween concept. The song is a bit underwhelming but the instrumentation is delightfully unique, and the thumping bass drum in the chorus is perfectly done.

**popularsong** (6): its good but i feel like its lacking smth as a song. too monotone. the era was incredible though

**RReg29** (6): decent but that lead riff line gets old in a hurry

**MrSwearword** (5): an idea is there but aside from a plain chorus, this goes nowhere

**satanicyoona** (5): she's questionable..

**selegend** (10): Genius had a video of how the producers composed this song and how elated they were to finally be able to draw inspiration from 90's R&B for a modern pop song since there's little demand for that sound in the American market. I'd say The Stereotypes nailed that sound perfectly. The harmonies are gorgeous, and the random sound effects like the high heels and police sirens bolster the fierceness of the song. The English version isn't anything short of amazing either.

---
**0ut0fthew00ds** (11): the best K pop song of the year - such a smooth, timely sound

**Akastavo** (11): perfect song just perfect

**bespectacled** (11): An easy score for me to give due to these four iconic words: SHIJAKALKKE BAD BOY DOWN. This sexy badass concept is their best-executed concept so far (that we need more of in the future, we beg of you SM ent). The Stereotypes did what they had to do in this hip hop-inspired masterpiece. The production is so slick and crisp and it rode with the trap music trend without it sounding inauthentic. Best k-pop release of 2018 by a wide margin for me.

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): this is just SUCH a groovy little tune. perfect blend of that r&b vibe and those trap touches. the little siren in the chorus is a cute touch

**jonnyd86** (11): this song took me back to my upbringing with 90's R&B but with such a fresh take. RV at their best. perfection start to finish

**maybe9** (11): step on me PLEASE

**original\_doll** (11): can't even put into words how much I love this 😍

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (11): HELLO KPOP GIRL GROUP SONG OF THE YEAR AND MY 11. Yeah I knew when this was released no one was going to fucking top it, and literally no one has yet. After the fucking string of “Red” and “Red Velvet” comebacks I was fucking CRAVING for something more on the “Velvet” side and here we fucking are bitchesssssssssss. You can imagine that I might as well have fucking squealed when this released. It was literally everything I wanted and MORE. Alright let me break some shit down, #1 this is my most played kpop girl group song of the year, #2 it’s probably within my top 10 songs of the year and I didn’t even realize it until this point, #3 you all don’t want to know how often I end up with this on repeat. Okay so that out of the way, this song is fucking amazing. Harmonies? CHECK. Catchy? CHECK. A nice R&B beat? CHECK. Weird stepping noises in the chorus that shouldn’t work but do? CHECK. I think you guys get the point. I literally have nothing but praise for this song. It was literally all I wanted and more, which I’ve said like twice, but I have a point. Anyway, the vid is nice, some big ol a e s t h e t i c s, Irene slap me with your pigtails… Also uhhhh I may have ended up with this on repeat while reviewing it for this. Also uhhh the English version slaps minus the fact they changed the “Who dat who dat who dat boy” to “Who dat who dat who dat is” at the beginning, but that’s what audio editing software is for right lol.

**three-stacks** (11): The sum is more than the parts in this song - the parts being all very simple instrumental choices - a hi-hat roll, that relentless keyboard phrase, and the steady 808s jabbing underneath fading chords. This song just moves and grooves, and leaves you wanting more. It's also a very confident vocal performance - where the "Red" singles can occasionally sound like the rhythm and the range are pushing the group, this has them right in their comfort range and sounding their best. It's a truly timeless song.

---
**1998tweety** (10): A serious contender for my 11. This is my most played kpop song of 2018 and deservedly so. Switching to their Velvet side, RV delivers a sexy and seductive R&B track that leaves you captivated from start to finish.

**AroMorbid** (10): Super Catchy, very western pop. I could have seen this blow up in the States maybe.

**c0ns3rvative** (10): My all-time favorite k-pop R&B track, the synth lead is heavenly and the walking/siren samples really fill out the instrumental. The fact that the chorus modulates directly into the bridge is such a smooth touch and the vocal harmonies are killer as per usual

**Chubiski** (10): the details in this song, elevate this song

**cyborglilith** (10): deserves top 3

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song is so easy to listen to, it ended up being one of my top listened tracks of the year just because it’s so easy for me to put it on repeat. There are a lot of good things about this track but I guess I’ll single out the whistle sound, it’s a great little hook that shoots some energy into the song. I especially love the English version of this track, I think they did a great job translating the lyrics. However I will say… does anyone else hear those weird sounds during the start of the chorus? They sound like shoes or something walking.

**Glennishill** (10): If I had two elevens to give, this would be the other one. Bad Boy is one of the best pop songs of the year, period. The addition of an English version makes it even better!

**Hyperion2589** (10): Mature sultry sounding, has that calming effect.

**Johnnytoby** (10): wow ok

**Kromorei** (10): Everything about this song is perfect. I almost gave this my 11.

**Luxaria** (10): A close second in terms of songs on this rate (Forever Young is the 11 in my heart) but the harmonies in this song are honestly so good, what an incredible group of singers they managed to get. The Velvet concepts are my favourite (obviously) because they just have the right attitude to pull it off.

**MissyBee37** (10): If I only had two 11s... But I don't, so this is a 10 with an honorary (imaginary) extra bonus score because it's amazing and one of my new top favorite pop songs, period. Just perfect. The beat, the attitude, the vocals. Gorgeous chorus. Slinky & magical. Love.

**MrSwearword** (10): I'm actually pleased with this

**nihilistickitten** (10): their Best track

**Qwilphish** (10): KILL ME KILL ME KILL ME KILL ME

**ttandrew** (10): iconic

**WeirdSignal** (10): the rnb/trap beat is super sexy on this one

**wugggs** (10): Amazing, what else can I say

**arrivederci1** (9.8): i remember listening to this the first time and dyyyiinngg

**bluepupz** (9.5): This is the best of their "velvet" side imo

**chainedapart** (9.5): A group that grows with time, constantly topping their previous songs with a new release. (Power Up is the same level as Bad Boy, imo)

**dynamicity** (9): An expertly done retro R&B jam with a chorus that never gets old. 0 for the English version because "who dat who dat who dat IS" like what the fuck.

**GroceryStore** (9): Very good song/deserves all the love it got

**Qustomar** (9): listen to the instrumental please, which features random sounds like footsteps, shouts, police sirens, motorcycle revving, car horn beeping, etc.

**jamesfog** (8.5): I love Ariana Grande [2]

**kappyko** (8.5): grew on me so much

**Neferpitta** (8.5): I appreciate how half of Red Velvet's concepts are them looking incredibly bitchy/emotionless as that is also my state of being half the time.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Hmm...I like Bad Boy well enough, but I have mixed thoughts on how Red Velvet decided to execute the song. Bad Boy sounds far more RnB than the rest of the group's singles in this rate, and it fits much more into modern-day commercial RnB in the west at that; however, some sections of Bad Boy's melody are much better suited to a pop song than their musical surroundings. As a song on its own, Bad. Oh is fine enough, but I do wish they gave it a more lively, energetic remix exploring this.

**PostDebut** (8): WHO DAT WHO DAT WHO DAT BOY

**tinnnn\_lv** (8): did not expect the rnb chorus!!

**gowestyoungkanye** (7.9): tbh i kind of hated this at first but i’ll be damned if rv don’t always get me eventually in the end. also the all the looks with the pigtails.......whew

**BiPolarBear17** (7): Bad Boy always disappoints me in the sense that the groundwork had been laid here for a phenomenal track; unfortunately, they just settle for 'good'. The song takes its killer instrumental and ambience and just do absolutely nothing with it.

**edmiliballs** (7): it's fine

**satanicyoona** (7): very soothing, it's in my sleep playlist. overall very good, and the tiny details like the heels and the cop car sounds are nice to hear

**Meepmeepmusik** (5): The MV makes me feel motion sick

**RReg29** (5): just not my type of track

**franch** (4): this group is so polarizing to me

**selegend** (10): "Girl Front" was on top for like one day, otherwise Red Velvet was always on top with either this or "Bad Boy". Then "Peek-a-Boo" snuck its way into the top 3 on the last day of submissions, making a fully RV top 3. "Russian Roulette" sums up all the delights of K-pop: excellent vocals, an infectious melody, sugary sweet throwback synthpop production, and gorgeous visuals to match the metaphorical lyrics.

**raicicle** (9): This song marked the first outing into a more ambiguous territory between their 'red' and 'velvet' sides, and the effervescent joy of 8-bit and chiptune was a pretty genius way of playing it out. It's one of their sweetest outings for sure, but an absolutely inescapable hook with the iconic looks and visuals that accompanied the song makes it a cornerstone in the Red Velvet discography and difficult to deny even for the most sceptical of haters. It remains one of their most well-known and well-received songs for a reason, and a worthy winner indeed.

---
**gannade** (11): a major bop from start to finsih

**letsallpoo** (11): a fucking MASTERPIECE OH MY GOD

**PuggleMaster** (11): The song that turned me on to RV so many years ago.

**Qustomar** (11): purely an 11 because this song caters to a lot of my music tastes extremely well. i love the 8-bitty production, i love the brightness, i love that music video, i love that there's no unnecessary rap verse, i love that the line distribution was perfect, i somewhat know the chrous choreo, and i think this song, from beginning to end, is perfection !!!

---
**1998tweety** (10): This is actually my ringtone so I got a bit uneasy when the track started playing. One of the first RV songs I heard, I feel like this perfectly captures the group and is thus one of their most iconic songs. This song feels like the perfect in-between of RV's Red and Velvet sides (which we later see again on Peek-a-Boo). Def one of the kpop songs that will be looked back on in the future.

**Akastavo** (10): love the choreo love the chorus everything

**bespectacled** (10): My introduction to Red Velvet and I never looked back since. I love how campy and pastel-coloured the murder-themed video of this infectious bop was. This is their signature song.

**c0ns3rvative** (10): Such a great song. The stacked vocal chopping really takes center stage both by acting as a percussive driver on the chorus and as melodic backing on the pre & bridge. Add some more top-notch SM production and you get a smash

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the bop that got me to stan RV

**cyborglilith** (10): B O P

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Arguably the best “Red Velvet” title track? I think the coolest thing about Red Velvet is their unconventional subject matter and the way they blend innocence and femininity with undercurrents of danger and violence, and this song is the epitome of that. An icy, ‘80s inspired pop song with a lilting melody, it’s a ton of fun, but then the subject matter and music video give it such a different vibe. It frames love as something dangerous and not to be taken lightly, yet the detached ease with which they approach it gives them this tremendous sense of power.

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): you literally cannot convince me this isn’t the best mv of all time. except maybe peekaboo.

**grenjarl** (10): had stay not been here probably would be my highest rated song

**Kromorei** (10): I love the hell out of this song. It's catchy as shit.

**maybe9** (10): BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP

**MrSwearword** (10): very good for them

**Neferpitta** (10): It's refreshing to see a kpop group whose members are so open about wanting to kill each other.

**Qwilphish** (10): the song that got me into kpop

**\_xSyracuse** (9): the girls trying to kill each other in the music videos is actual footage of my last few brain cells during exam week

**bluepupz** (9): Catchy af. A great pop song in general

**jonnyd86** (9): Ice Cream Cake and Dumb Dumb's formula perfected.. the hook is great and the second hook (the ay la la la) is my favorite part.

**kappyko** (9): i think this was the FIRST kpop song i ever stanned like i know my blurb for loona's songle say something but nah this song i had on my bus playlist since 2016 i think? good shit

**Luxaria** (9): I like how all the Red songs have such a coherent sound. Also they make me wanna dance.

**modotrising** (9): This was the first gg song I listened to and genuinely enjoyed when I was getting into kpop a little while ago.

**amandapearl2** (8.9): Another fantastic music video, everything visually is on point. And the song itself is such a good pop song, fun and upbeat.

**AroMorbid** (8.5): Addicting

**dynamicity** (8.5): Unabashed ear candy that never tries to be anything other than stupidly catchy.

**Nixon4Prez** (8.5): Very Red Velvet in the best possible way

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8.5): You know uhhhhhhh I honestly think I might have hated this song at first (back when it came out) for being too cutesy. That’s right, the cutesy boom curse (It’s what I like to call the giant influx of cutesy concepts among girl groups for the past few years) stuck again with this one. But this one has enough charm that it sets itself apart from the rest of the cutesy competition. I like to think of this song has like a fever dream. Especially with the video, holy fever dream fuck. Like I kinda can’t believe it happened, but also like… I’m not upset about it. It’s fucking spunky and fun. Also guess what, the catch chorus returns. Heartbeatbeatbeatbeat <3. Quick note here bout the video, still love the whole Tom & Jerry vibe, still think they did Seulgi so wrong with her hair in this era.

**satanicyoona** (8.5): YO. this would be a 9 if it were the japanese version because that one SLAPS! it reminds me of a video game in some ways. it's just so much fun to listen to and pretend like you're a robot. beep boop.

**Hyperion2589** (8): Same as ICC.

**lexarqade** (8): Another one I wasn't totally sold on release. I enjoy it now but I still think it doesn't "feel" like a RV song.

**popularsong** (8): heart b b b beat. i love their red side its so up my alley

**RReg29** (8): catchy bop (killer vid!)

**ttandrew** (8): bop

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Is...is Russian Roulette a fan favorite? To be honest, I can't fins anything special about it. The titular hook is catchy enough for me to give the song a few replays, but, overall, it's not as infectious as Red Velvet's first singles; try as it might, Russian Roulette fails to live up to the suspense of its namesake game.

**Chubiski** (7): their vocals are filtered too much in this song

**minsiii** (7): the chorus melody is just a tad stale for me sorry

**nihilistickitten** (7): really grew on me

**tinnnn\_lv** (5): it was an okay pop song, but the mv was really cool! pastel murderers are my new aesthetic

**Overall average**: 7.812 **// Total points:** 1249.961

**1998tweety** (9.389): Another one of my favourite kpop groups. RV are always doing something interesting, whether its their crazy Red tracks, or their smooth Velvet tracks. While both are great on their own, the real magic happens when they successfully combine them. 

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9.111): Ah Red Velvet SM’s premier girl group nowadays. I remember when Yeri was added to the group. That was a mess. There were dozens of theories that SM was going to try the rotating group stuff like NCT with Red Velvet using the other trainees show in the beginning of the happiness video (Yeri is in there btw). Others were just pissed because at that point Red Velvet had already released 2 songs as 4. But you know what, she’s worked out for the better and helped form the group so much. Anyways sorry to make this a slight Yeri fest let me get back on track. Red Velvet to me has always been a more interesting group, they have their “Red” side (the fun songs like Rookie/ICC/etc.) and their “Velvet” side (The slow/smooth/sultry songs like Automatic/Bad Boy/etc.) and of course there’s the songs that are the mixes of the two sides. Personally, I’m more of a fan of the “Velvet” side, but I don’t mind the “Red” side (Except for like the past two comebacks as of current, RBB & Power Up). Overall RV are probably my 2nd maybe 3rd (depends on the day/mood) girl group in the Kpop scene right now. Here’s to many more years of Red Velvet and hopefully more Velvet songs. Also, if anyone is curious my bias is Irene. (Okay so I wrote this all before starting through RV’s song and uhhhhhhh I’m starting to think RV might be my favorite girl group) 

**40073521** (8.667): THIS IS TOO HARD. THEY ALL DESERVE 11. 

**Glennishill** (8.556): Red Velvet are one of the greatest kpop acts around right now. Their hits are all bangers and every one of their songs is slick and fun. 

**bluepupz** (8.278): They have such great songs, honestly. Some of their "red" songs can be a little too much at times, but overall their title tracks are fun and diverse! 

**Chubiski** (8.000): versatile queens who kill any concept thrown at them. too bad we’re only rating singles, because tbh their bsides are amazing and many are better than their singles. 

**MissyBee37** (7.833): I prefer BLACKPINK & TWICE, but there's a solid argument for Red Velvet being one of the most talented groups. Their vocals are all just gorgeous! I don't always love the songs, though. The songs of theirs that I love, I LOVE. But overall they don't hook me the same way my two faves do. Also it's not a single but go listen to "Bad Dracula!" One of my Red Velvet faves! 

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.833): I've heard Red Velvet's name many times before, as an Asian, and now that I've actually listened to their music, I can finally say that I completely get the hype for them. They exemplify some of K-Pop's best traits when they combine catchiness and innovation together, and most of the time they deliver pure pop bops. 

**chainedapart** (7.500): One of those groups that can sing about anything and get away with it. We had cake, fruits, emotions, pizza delivery, boys, games, and being dumb. 

**modotrising** (7.089): I don't stan but after going through this list I certainly should. Amazing vocals AND interesting music. 

**franch** (6.489): so polarizing. i love saccharine sweetness but only if dialed in exactly right, otherwise sort of grating. but oh my god happiness and ice cream cake are anthems. 

**You_Will_Die** (5.500): These are extremely hit or miss for me. Two thirds of them are super annoying and one third is super good. Common theme in those I don't like is that they repeat one phrase or word over and over again. Dumb Dumb it's mainly in the background and not the focus so I don't mind that. Bad Boy got to be the worst offender of this and also throws in random screams.

You_Will_Die: Hah as you have guessed we weren't, I just searched for it instead of opening the linked and listened to their new song instead. Was out of my imagination that the group could first release "Bad Boy" to follow it with "Really Bad Boy" lol. I still don't really like Bad Boy but my criticism was specifically for their new one. My bad.
