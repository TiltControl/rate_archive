nihilistickitten: What is a controversial score?
[/r/popheads/comments/a8evgb/the_kpop_girl_groups_singles_rate_day_1_walmart/ecb673o/]

=====

deleted: By 'controversial score', I meant a score for a song that stood out from other users' opinions. For example, if most users participating in this rate gave, say, Ice Cream Cake an 8 or higher, a controversial score for the song would have been a 1 or a 2. (I'm just using this as an example; I love Ice Cream Cake, and I hope it did well!) 

I'm not sure if you're new to r/popheads rates, but if you are, we actually try to measure how controversial a song is every time we rate one. Have you seen a small 'controversy score' section in each song's blurb? That's actually the standardized deviation of all the scores for each song. In other words, our controversy scores can help you know whether the scores every participant gave to one particular song were widely different, or whether most of us tended to agree on how good or bad a song was. Generally, a higher controversy score means that everybody's opinions on a song were more divided than average. For example, Starry Night by Mamamoo got a controversy score of roughly 2.4; the average controversy score in this rate was about a 2. That means that Starry Night was a pretty controversial song; people either liked it or called it one of Mamamoo's most boring singles. Meanwhile, Um Oh Ah Yeah had a controversy score of about 1.7; that means that in the context of this rate, it was a relatively uncontroversial song. That means everybody's opinions on the song tended to agree rather than disagree, although there were still a few users who scored Um On Ah Yeah much higher or lower than everybody else. 

Incidentally, this rate is likely to have larger controversy scores due to the large amount of users who participated in it. In fact, it seems like almost song has huge fans and big detractors; as of today, almost every song has an 11, and almost every song has a 0! Sometimes, when rates collect a smaller amount of participants, and when they happen to feature songs almost everybody likes, our controversy scores become very small. (Just recently, we had a rate where the winner managed to achieve a controversy score lower than 1!) Anyway, I'm sorry if I seemed like a total nerd here, but I hope I helped you out.

**selegend** (5): Pretty standard piano ballad - I can see why it's last.

---
**AroMorbid** (10): What a ballad. The melody is so clear and beautiful.

**Hyperion2589** (10): A technically amazing ballad with unique airy vocals.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I really like this one, I see a lot of people shafting it because it’s slower but I’ve always thought it was still a very solid song. That guitar twang that happens about a minute and a half in after the first chorus scalps me every single time.

**1998tweety** (8.4): This is ok but it feels very generic and a little boring.

**lexarqade** (8): A cute bop, Very relaxing

**minsiii** (8): arrangement is so good

**amandapearl2** (7.1): A ballad, but this one is really beautiful. Hyunjin’s voice is so soft and tender. She adds a beautiful and melancholic element to this song.

**Banananaise** (7): this is a lovely sweet smooth classic song which people overlook because of the whole fiasco with the music video

**Glennishill** (7): Fantastic chorus but the rest of the song is kind of boring.

**jonnyd86** (7): really catchy hook a beautiful performance by HyunJin

**MissyBee37** (6.5): I can't hear this song without hearing "Imagine."

**bespectacled** (6): Not just a fan of loona's ballads, sorry :/

**maybe9** (6): its pretty

**musicalpets** (6): her voice is similar to heejin wow they have a duet together and are indistinguishable wow

**RReg29** (6): solid

**heeyeon** (5): it's a cute song i just never go back to it

**Luxaria** (5): I feel bad for not liking this but it's weird and not my type. Probably could end up on a K Drama.

**dynamicity** (4): A ballad from someone who can barely even sing? Oof.

**satanicyoona** (4): refer to love&live comment, although this track is pretty so this score is actually me being generous

**nihilistickitten** (3): fell asleep

**wugggs** (3): Just a little boring for me

=====

banananaise: tbh i can't actually find a source for this so i might be misremembering it, but the original video was a 10 minute short film where half the song was faint and muffled, and people reacted badly to it. after a week or so they released a proper MV for it (along with an MV for the B-side), but i think the negative initial reaction to the film has kind of coloured how people feel about the song in general

**selegend** (6): You might be inclined to think this is a boring ballad from how this starts out, but it actually proves itself to be a jazzy track about consent. The lyrics are quite fitting for the maknae of the group too. "Hug now, kiss later" - me to guys on Tinder who rush too quickly.

---
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Although not necessarily LOONA’s most daring song, I honestly rank it as one of the best of the solos. It just delivers the fun, youthful energy that it needs to, I don’t think any of the girls displayed as much personality on their track as YeoJin did.

**Hyperion2589** (10): Another technically brilliant composition. One of the most well disguised key changes.

**kappyko** (10): frog goddess please let me give this a 11 pretty please

**lilguavachan** (10): ended twice

**minsiii** (10): LOONA

**1998tweety** (9.3): This almost feels ViViD 2.0. I liked ViViD so I'll like this too. The guitar solo was wicked.

**maybe9** (9): BUBBLE POP YASSS

**modotrising** (9): This song is just so cute and correct for this little girl. I love how it fits her. So creative.

**bespectacled** (8.5): i'm a sucker for horns on songs so I can't not love this song

**AroMorbid** (8): This song is super fun to sing along to. Not my favorite, but when I do listen to it, I turn up!

**Banananaise** (8): honestly the relief everyone felt when blockberry gave Yeojin an age-appropriate song

**amandapearl2** (7.3): Cute and Sassy, just like Yeojin. This is adorable and age appropriate. Another song with musical theater vibes.

**Luxaria** (7): the LOONA music team is desperate to get the most out of the orchestra they hired. I'm still not a massive fan of the cutesy concept.

**RReg29** (7): IU who?

**three-stacks** (7): Even when LOONA's songs aren't necessarily the type that I usually like, the composition is still interesting enough to get my attention.

**dynamicity** (6.5): This song is so cute it makes me want to scream. The big band feel works great in conjunction.

**musicalpets** (6.5): one of the cutest concepts but she or the song is missing something

**heeyeon** (6): the instrumental is amazing but yeojin's voice... im sorry

**gowestyoungkanye** (5): look these first few tracks are fives and i have like nothing to say about them

**wugggs** (5): Unexpectedly tolerable really cute bop

**jonnyd86** (4): the big band rhythm just isnt my style

**satanicyoona** (4): the cutest song i've ever seen, very catchy.

**selegend** (4): ViVi revives 90's bubblegum pop with this pure bop. My problem with this is that it doesn't flow as well as the other LOONA singles; not much about this really *sticks*.

---
**AroMorbid** (10): I've heard people say this song is too simple, but I never get tired of it. It brings a smile to my face everytime. Also, I want to see HaSeul rap more. She is so cute.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I talked about this one a lot in my [+ +] review (WHICH YOU SHOULD ALL READ) but I’ll go into a bit more here. This song is just sweet and cute and pure, it dukes it out with “Let Me In” for my favorite LOONA solo. I know from experience that I’m a silly, syrupy mess when I have a crush, and this song really speaks to that experience. And this sweet ‘90s style is the perfect vehicle for conveying it, it sounds earnest and pure without going too overboard. Also HaSeul’s rap verse? Fire.

**Hyperion2589** (10): Can never get sick of 90s music.

**lexarqade** (10): Very retro and miss Haseul Shakur on the rap! Ugh her MIND

**minibjork** (9.5): i love early 2000s nostalgia

**lilguavachan** (9): ended gfriend

**Luxaria** (9): This is my fave so far, the 90s concept is so soft and her voice is so nice.

**nihilistickitten** (9): best track from this subunit

**1998tweety** (8.9): This is a pretty chill cute bop. As always the production adds a lot to these songs.

**Banananaise** (8): this is a fun bop and HaSeul is good at rapping and i hate everyone who disagrees with me!

**maybe9** (8): ugh i love this song

**minsiii** (8): look I know it's not the most musically interesting song but the CHORUS DOE

**three-stacks** (8): The retro-future sound gave me Rina vibes, which I am all about.

**jonnyd86** (7): really catchy hook

**amandapearl2** (6.2): My least favorite of the solos. There’s noting wrong with it, I just find it a bit bland.

**dynamicity** (6): Poor ViVi couldn't even get a full solo song without HaSeul butting in because her own song sucked. She'd better guard her chin implant in case HaSeul tries to steal that too. Oh wait.

**RReg29** (6): solid

**satanicyoona** (5): this song makes me "uwu" as the kids say.

**modotrising** (4): Honestly all of these solos are so great this one feels a bit bland in comparison, but it's by no means bad.

**musicalpets** (4): surprisingly boring song tho i want the polo shirt she is wearing if anyone knows where i can get it

**wugggs** (1): Vivi honey you're precious, but no. The production on this is just bad

**selegend** (10): The orchestral arrangement is so breathtakingly refreshing. Our leader HaSeul delivers excellent vocals on this cinematic Disney-esque masterpiece.

---
**Banananaise** (10): WHY won't you let me give this an 11 this is la homophobie

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): HaSeul is my bias and she deserves more lines. I’m a theatre boy so this song really does it for me, I love the melodramatic epic ness of it.

**GroceryStore** (10): Most underrated song by the most underrated member

**lexarqade** (10): Ugh miss Haseul with the blonde bob... The video for this is breathtaking.

**lilguavachan** (10): if i could give this song an 11, i would. it's my favorite of the debuts of the loona girls

**minsiii** (10): STAN

**1998tweety** (9.4): I love this. I'm getting an anime vibed mixed with an Xmas/Disney vibe. Somehow it all works.

**arrivederci1** (9.2): literal art

**Luxaria** (9): I like this one, so orchestral. I feel like the instrumental slightly overshadows the vocals outside of the chorus but the Chorus is so good.

**AroMorbid** (8.5): LOONA songs have so many different parts and styles and this is a great example of it. Is there nothing they cannot do?

**Glennishill** (8.5): Very cool and fun!

**maybe9** (8): kpop meets 007

**Hyperion2589** (7): Can appreciate the musical sophistication of the piece, but just not my type of song.

**amandapearl2** (6.8): Another ballad. It’s quite beautiful and musically complex, but much like Sonatine, doesn’t register with me.

**wugggs** (6.2): Really cool vibe to this song

**bespectacled** (6): Gorgeous video location, song not so much

**musicalpets** (6): great song but sounds like background music

**nihilistickitten** (6): pretty but forgettable

**RReg29** (6): decent enough

**jonnyd86** (4): never really did it for me

**satanicyoona** (4): what does she want!! go away haseul!! /s

**dynamicity** (1): I've listened to this 3 times and can't remember a single piece of it.

**selegend** (1): [Blackpink - Stay (2016)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsPS5ubApoE)

**raicicle** (4): who asked

---
**grenjarl** (11): KPop needs more of these songs because this is one of my all time top 20

---
**40073521** (10): Their best song. It doesn't need the raps but I still enjoy them.

**gannade** (10): kpop ballads are da best

**Kromorei** (10): This song is cute and cozy and undeserving of the hate it receives from BLINKs and others.

**lilguavachan** (10): i'm just a sucker for a ballad, i'm sorry

**Luxaria** (10): Underrated chill bop

**Mudkip1** (10): oh they really won with this one

**agentofscranton** (9.5): rosé sounds fucking beautiful on this, if yg ever actually gets round to releasing her solo single, i'd love for it to be in the same vein as this

**1998tweety** (9): An interesting switchup from their previous singles. I love the more laid back feel to this track, the raps are top tier too. For once the chorus is my favourite part of the song, all the extra bits added in really make the song.

**PuggleMaster** (9): this was cute

**chainedapart** (8.5): Underrated

**Banananaise** (8): once i got into the whole campfire anthem vibe, i begun to really like this track

**bespectacled** (8): RIP lisa-biased stans on this obvious showcase of BP's vocal line. A cute break from their high octane first singles

**cyborglilith** (8): i cry

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): To be honest, we have to get more cute songs like this that aren't really tracks you bop to but aren't really ballads, either. Most of the time in Western music, songs with a similar vibe to Stay end up being tiring fluff filler or start sliding into classic bubblegum pop, but here BLACKPINK delivers a cute track that's actually worth listening to on its merits alone.

**AroMorbid** (7.5): Usually skip, but on the chance I don't, I like it

**MissyBee37** (7.5): Sweet, simple & pretty. I enjoy it as part of my artist playlist for them but I don't seek it out like I do their bangers, which I could play on repeat for hours. But I bet it's a nice moment live!

**jamesfog** (7): I like that it's something different from the usual

**jonnyd86** (7): enjoyable at times, a bit maudlin at others. the prechorus is the best part.

**kappyko** (7): I'm a slut for this Ed Sheeran pop. Really cozy stuff that I could see myself sending "owo" texts to cute boys to. My heart hurts

**nihilistickitten** (7): t swift k pop

**PostDebut** (7): Probably gonna be the least popular out of all the BP songs. People don't probably think of Black Pink when thinking about folksy acoustic-driven ballads but it's pleasant enough, shows that the girls are surely versatile

**tapdancingpig** (7): Really sweet.

**arrivederci1** (6.7): it's okay but nothing special about it

**bluepupz** (6): Gives me sitting around the campfire vibes. It doesn't really stand out that much to me

**Chubiski** (6): harmonica???? not my blackpink

**dynamicity** (6): The verses serve some nice vocals but the chorus falls flat, feeling underwhelming and campy.

**edmiliballs** (6): god this really does sound like a 2NE1 b-side

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Acoustic guitar rapping is an interesting idea and it works to show some versatility from BLACKPINK. I like the concept and parts of this song, but on the whole I don’t think it really has the punch it needs. The harmonica is the most memorable part and I don’t think that’s good. I also think it’s a bit weird to hear them randomly use the English word “felony,” it throws me a little bit whenever I hear it.

**Johnnytoby** (6): :/

**modotrising** (6): I didn't know this song and I actually really liked it! A surprising change of pace from all the other club bangers.

**RReg29** (6): not bad…would have liked to build somewhere but whatevs

**amandapearl2** (5.5): It’s a nice song, but rather boring. It’s nice to see BP attempt something different but I don’t think they quite pulled it off.

**c0ns3rvative** (5.5): Sonically pretty nice with the varied live instrumentation providing a folksy yet very contemporary soundscape. Nothing else about it does anything for me though

**original\_doll** (5.5): inoffensive but boring

**satanicyoona** (5.5): finally a bp song that doesn't sound like a cluster of random noises (sry teddy)

**Hyperion2589** (5): Can see what they tried to do with change up in style, but didn't like it at all. Chorus and verse felt incompatible with each other, especially hated the clapping backing.

**maybe9** (5): if youre gonna go sad, go full sad also yikes chorus

**popularsong** (5): it's nice but snnnzzzz i feel like it would be better if the chorus was less campfire song and more in line w the verses

**wugggs** (5): Although it is a good song, I don't think I like Blackpink in this style as much. Chorus is too dissonant with rest of the song for me.

**gowestyoungkanye** (4): ballads are disgusitng

**minsiii** (3): not as special as rest of the discography

**tinnnn\_lv** (3): alright but honestly abit of a snooze fest. not a fan of the vocals

**Neferpitta** (2): Whenever you hear a harmonica in a kpop song you should know to instantly turn it off. If, however, you chose not to you will be subjected to 4 minutes of the sort of bullshit tween-camp song you'd expect to find someone to have sung on their ukulele and uploaded to youtube to an audience of 50 viewers, complete with a chorus whose lyrics consist 50% of "lalalala" because they couldn't think of anything to say. Of course, that would probably be more enjoyable as you wouldn't have to hear the incessant cheery clapping throughout the chorus which feels like an insult to your intelligence trying to convince you it's a fun, happy song, when in reality nothing in recent memory has made me more want to kill myself.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (2): Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Look, I can see what they were going for with this song but just…. No. I get it, they wanted BP to have a ballad to show some variety but it’s not that good. If you want to compare it to the ballads of 2NE1 (Former YG girl group, the one BP technically replaced), it falls flat hard. I must admit the guitar in it is nice and the harmonica is odd but works. But the rest just no. Also, the fact they included raps in this song still bugs me. Like if any song doesn’t really need a rap in the K-Pop world it is usually the ballad songs, and this is one of those examples. But I can give props to the post-apocalyptic video, but I love all post-apocalyptic shit so. No surprise from me really.

**ttandrew** (2): no

**letsallpoo** (1): that harmonica gave me syphilis

**MrSwearword** (1): this is not a good ballad

**Qwilphish** (1): oh god that chorus is so bad against the intro verse

**Qustomar** (0): i have an aversion to slow acoustic guitar ballads, it's very hard for me to like them. many blackpink fans say that people don't like this song because it's a ballad, but i actually really like ballads, i just don't think this song is a good one

**selegend** (3): This suffers from having no melody. As usual, the vocals are on point, but the song just doesn't *flow*.

---
**Hyperion2589** (10): Perfectly captured the late night New York Broadway feel.

**lilguavachan** (9): taylor swift's welcome to new york is trembling

**maybe9** (9): a relaxed flight to new york with some dope rap breaks

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): yeah that was kinda funny

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): A song with a hook that goes 'hashtag New York' is supposed to be cringeworthy, but MAMAMOO makes shit like that work, and, honestly, at this point, I'm not surprised. For a track dedicated to such a bombastic city, the track is definitely more minimalist than expected, but MAMAMOO's voices help elevate New York up.

**1998tweety** (8.4): Probably their weakest song in this rate. It's nice but unfortunately not nearly as interesting as their other tracks.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): this starts off with so much promise but the chorus is kinda blah

**kappyko** (8): "BEYONCÉ?"

**Kromorei** (8): Pretty funky.

**dynamicity** (7.5): I could listen to Hwasa saying "less get it" on repeat for hours. The instrumental is the real star of this song, oozing funk with every note. The melody in comparison feels a bit uninspired.

**arrivederci1** (7.4): nothing too interesting about this

**Qwilphish** (7): Taylor is shook

**wugggs** (7): Good but some lagging parts for me, like the instrumental after the bridge

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): They sing both “hashtag” and “hands up?” They’re too good for us.

**amandapearl2** (6): A nice song, but utterly forgettable

**gowestyoungkanye** (6): let’s get it (my hot take is this sounds like early ariana grande)

**GroceryStore** (6): Completely forgot this song existed

**jonnyd86** (6): was never big on this song

**nihilistickitten** (6): jazzy

**PostDebut** (6): Concrete Jungle Wet Dream Tomato

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6): #NEWYORK. So this was a pre-release track, something MAMAMOO has just kept doing like since then. And honestly I don’t remember much about this other than lotta Moonbyul lines and literally the word New York every 30 seconds at least lol. Hell I even forgot it had a music video up until this point. (I’m rating this by watching the YT playlist btw)

**RReg29** (6): vox are still there but the song isn’t as good

**tinnnn\_lv** (6): honestly there seems to a trend their songs are starting to sound alike but vocals are good so 6

**bluepupz** (5): The song just feels like it doesn't really go anywhere. I don't like the instrumentation here

**lexarqade** (5): Was this even a single? It's a bit boring for my liking.

**Luxaria** (5): Uh nah, not working for me.

**MrSwearword** (5): oh jesus this is sort of painful...I mean it's not hard to have a better version of Taylor's Welcome to New York but oh my god no...

**minsiii** (4): a really eh song sad to say

**Nixon4Prez** (4): I feel like this song never goes anywhere

**Neferpitta** (3): This is tuneless.

**selegend** (5): Very standard bubblegum K-pop with little substance

---
**chainedapart** (11): Since there's no TFTMN/Memoria/Summer Rain in the choices, I'm giving my 11 points to Love Whisper.

---
**cyborglilith** (10): B O P

**original\_doll** (10): ahh this song is so lovely! Yuju's high note ❤️

**tapdancingpig** (10): Another delectable slice of 90’s teen pop. The random key change between the chorus and verse sold me on it.

**Hyperion2589** (9): Similar song as MGT but not as well polished or mixed, especially in the bridge.

**Johnnytoby** (9): I screamed Nako omg her impact I*zone won this rate truly

**1998tweety** (8.7): This sounds similar to their other songs [3]

**kappyko** (8.5): THEY LOOK ADORABLE IN THIS ART AND THE SONG IS YET ANOTHER BOP!!!! AAAAAAAAAA!!!! I LOVE IT

**bespectacled** (8): This deserved the success of MGT and Navillera!!! Their only title I like, tbh

**lexarqade** (8): This isn't a bad song, but I guess they didn't really have a choice after Korea shat on Fingertip. I just kinda wish there was more to it.

**Luxaria** (8): So I guess the electric guitar/dance break/key change is their thing?

**minsiii** (8): the chord progression is flames

**Banananaise** (7): produce 48 flashbacks

**jonnyd86** (7): Not my favorite of theirs but still a pleasurable listen. Once again Eunha's parts are my favorite. Banjjak Banjjak!

**Neferpitta** (7): Yuju has the most haunting thousand-yard stare I've ever seen.

**popularsong** (7): it's cute but... like navillera it doesn't have much going for it. classic gfriend song

**skargardin** (7): Cute bop

**bluepupz** (6.8): It's a cute song - nice high note at 2:59.

**gowestyoungkanye** (6.7): this also kinda bops but wow i just don’t like gfriend’s concepts at all

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Why don’t these GFRIEND songs interest me more?

**amandapearl2** (6.4): After Fingertip’s lukewarm reception I think they wanted to play it safe. And that’s understandable, but Love Whisper is a nice bside, but not title track material.

**c0ns3rvative** (6): Overproduced and overly cute with more pointless post-chorus instrumental breaks. It's always easy to appreciate their melodies and chord modulations but I'm not a fan of much else

**dynamicity** (6): This song starts out sounding like an APink b-side, but the key change in the chorus keeps things somewhat fresh.

**franch** (6): i like all of this well enough but it sort of all sounds the same

**maybe9** (6): would destroy with a better chorus but alas

**Nixon4Prez** (6): After Fingertip this feels like a bit of a regression

**RReg29** (6): decent but not up to the level as the previous ones on the list

**Kromorei** (5): Another boring bubblegum song that sounds like it could have came out of a Nugu group. Please stop.

**lilguavachan** (5): well i guess we're back to being cute which... i mean if it works it works

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Okay, I've tried to avoid this comparison before Love Whisper, except for that cheap crack in Me Gustas Tu, but this song is so mediocre and boring that I have to admit something: their music sounds like music you'd play at the credits scene of an Asian soap opera. I tried ignoring this before, because their music was generally good for the rest of their participance in this rate, but Love Whisper just...goes...nowhere. It really sounds like it was made to fill up space over a list of names.

**ttandrew** (5): cute

**onceberry** (4.5): I thought I hadn't heard this until I looked it up and saw it's the one where they dance on the water! THAT'S iconic but the song is forgettable

**nihilistickitten** (3): a little childish

**Qwilphish** (3): Half-Baked at going back to their old image

**wugggs** (3): Really bland and generic, too much of this sound in Kpop right now IMO so it was disappointing and felt like it lacked Gfriend's classic punchiness.

**BiPolarBear17** (2): They finally perfected the safe, soulless song formula they've been going for since their debut so kudos to them I guess.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (2): REMEMBER HOW WE CHANGED UP OUR SOUND? SIKE BITCH WE’RE BACK TO CUTESY SHIT. And with that I groan, ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I WANNA LIKE YOU GFRIEND I DO. But just… ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I suppose that’s really my general response to GFRIEND. There’s so much more potential they have in them, but they just keep coming back to this fucking same concept. Also, I literally only remember this song because of the man-made lake they dance in in the vid (and like one of the comeback stages, but also one of the members was like bleeding that stage). I had so much hope after fingertip and just like a touch it fucking disappeared with this.

**MrSwearword** (1): I THOUGHT THIS TEEN POP SHIT WAS ON THE FIRST TRACK MENTIONED AND NOT HERE AGAIN

**selegend** (3): LE's rap is amazing, but this sounds like three songs with an especially terrible  drop. Usually being cacophonous works for EXID, but in this case it doesn't. I love that the name pays homage to the Long Island Expressway though! (at least that's what it seems to me because the parent album is titled *Street*)

**raicicle** (7): bitch im madonna is SHAKING

---
**cyborglilith** (10): This sounds just like Bitch I'm Madonna.

**minibjork** (9): no offense but LE killed that verse. i can't stand the airhorn though.

**popularsong** (9): i actually love that its kind of like two songs mixed together? ik a lot of ppl wanted it to be more like LE's rap part / jeonghwas dance break but it reminded me of bitch im madonna too much. this way its more fun and i Love the chorus

**Qwilphish** (9): IGNORE THE AIRHORNS ITS A BOP

**1998tweety** (8.7): I was about to call this a step down from their previous songs and then the edm bit into the rap verse came in and wow it really elevated the whole song.

**bespectacled** (8.5): rihanna is shaking under her umbrella

**Kromorei** (8.5): This song doesn't even feel like an EXID song. That drop was DIRTY though. Liked it quite a lot even though it's noticeably not as polished as their other songs.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Alright, I know I should be talking about the actual music, but something I really like about L.I.E is the cover that accompanied it on Spotify. I don't know whether its a single cover or an album cover, but the artwork is really nice! As for the song itself, I'm pleasantly surprised with it. L.I.E brings back some of the energy from BLACKPINK I missed, and from what I've heard from EXID, it goes off harder than what I'd typically expect.

**arrivederci1** (8.4): hhhhhh LE's rap once again saves my soul

**Hyperion2589** (8): A bit repetitive at times but otherwise solid.

**Johnnytoby** (8): She's alright

**jonnyd86** (8): love the hook, vocal line shines and the drop is nasty

**lilguavachan** (8): a little more generic idk about this EDIT: oh wait the rap saves it nvm i like it

**PuggleMaster** (8): ok this is serving anime opener I live

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8): Oh boy, it’s a mess. I mean that in both the best and the worst way possible. EXID may be my favorite girl group here (and currently in kpop), but this song is just… it exists. Now I’m not gonna pan it too hard because fuck you guys I still bang to this. But it’s just a fucking diversive song. It’s loud, it’s messy, it doesn’t even know what it wants. It starts suddenly just to propel you right into everything. Of course, this song does give the other members more lines so it’s not really just the Hani and LE show (not like I’m complaining about it, because I love them both). But it comes at the price of a song that is overall a bit jarring. The main beat is jarring a bit. But the most fucking jarring part… THE PRE-CHORUS/CHORUS AND DROP. The fucking AIRHORNS that launch you into it are just like “Okay that’s odd hope this isn’t too bad.” And then it just is like “Welp.” I don’t think I had quite liked this as much as the others on first listen, but I didn’t fully hate it. It did grow on me, but I can understand those that still hate it. Also shout out to the music video for being chocked full of innuendos and LE fucking slaying my life.

**tinnnn\_lv** (8): this isn’t too bad, really like the change!

**onceberry** (7.5): Go to hell uwu

**edmiliballs** (7.1): needs more airhorns

**bluepupz** (7): Feels like two different songs are stitched together between the upbeat singing parts (I like these) and the more intense rap parts (not quite a fan)

**dynamicity** (7): The heavy sampling of Madonna here feels like a crutch for a missing hook, and the song isn't braggadocios enough to pull of the airhorns.

**grenjarl** (7): post chorus breakdown costs this 2 marks honestly

**jamesfog** (7): I'm not quite sure if this is good or bad

**wugggs** (7): Love Hani in the first verse + LE's rap, but the chorus feels like an anime intro and not in a good way

**amandapearl2** (6): A bit lighter their previous few songs, but I’m not a big fan of the dubstep-ish break half way through. The rap is a bit too hard and the chorus a bit too bright and they don’t quite work together. A really forgettable release for me.

**Banananaise** (6): did i just hear an airhorn in the background

**Chubiski** (6): oh god the airhorns

**maybe9** (6): CUTE BOP FINALLY but are you FUCKING KIDDING ME WITH THOSE AIRHORNS?????! M E S S

**minsiii** (6): I wanted to like it more but couldn't. :(

**original\_doll** (6): this is kinda messy...I mean I don't hate it but why the air horn??

**RReg29** (6): it’s okay

**c0ns3rvative** (5.5): Not really a fan of this cod reggae sound on the intro, it harkens back to debut 2NE1 and some other cheesy early 2nd gen tracks. The pre builds up pretty nicely but then the world's most disorienting siren sample leads into a grating synth line that I strongly dislike

**heeyeon** (5): the horn kills me every time, it's the most random shit and i love it (but i actually hate it)

**Mudkip1** (5): wtf are these airhorns

**Neferpitta** (5): The entirety of the (straight) korean male population beating their meat to Hani's fancam is what revived EXID's career and she's here to pay tribute to that.

**perfumevee** (5): There's something about this song I really didn't love and found a bit grating.

**tapdancingpig** (5): The girls have a sort of ballad here? Except it’s boring and then goes into that fart noise inspired breakdown every EDM song had in 2015 and 2016. Next!

**ttandrew** (5): kinda mess

**Ghost-Quartet** (4.5): The chorus of this song feels like it’s from a completely different song, and that’s the song that I want to be listening to. The drop and the rap verse are fine on their own I guess but they’re just distractions from the chorus and the bridge, which are the real highlights here. I wish I could give this song a higher score because the good parts are good but it’s just soooo disjointed.

**lexarqade** (4): This is just.... Idk it's not their best. Also the airhorns??? I'm mostly mad at this song because it cockblocked Luna's Free Somebody (one of the best kpop songs EVER) from ever getting a win

**Luxaria** (4): I need to know if it's just me but the backing track on the Youtube video is like, the same volume as the singers and it makes it uncomfortable to listen to.

**PostDebut** (4): This was weird, the Hotel Budapest video, the airhorns, an instrumental drop straight out of 2011, idk...

**gowestyoungkanye** (3): oh my god this is just straight up bad what the hell

**nihilistickitten** (3): those horns ruin it

**MrSwearword** (1): a somehow worse version of Bitch, I'm Madonna's beat' just made of NOPE

**kappyko** (0): the zipper/fart beat is ehh fine but the bizarrely saccharine pop portions are worryingly messy and incongruous. i understand theyre going for a maximal pop approach but it's not quite working all the way

**selegend** (8): I hated this at first, but it's so weirdly entrancing. That chorus is adorably delightful.

**raicicle** (9): this is GOOD whats not CLICKING

---
**\_xSyracuse** (10): this experimental banger deserved song of the year, and I will take this to the grave

**agentofscranton** (10): the 60s / super schoolgirls / sexy alien aesthetic of the video is a 10 alone

**Chubiski** (10): this would be an 11 if i could unhear “J Y P!” at the beginning

**chainedapart** (9.5): Controversial song because of the MV, but the lyrics, DAMN, I like this song.

**1998tweety** (9.4): Ok this is def controversial but I love this song. I know so many people hate it but its so different from Twice's other tracks which makes it stand out even more. They took a risk departing from their usual sound and it paid off for me.

**BiPolarBear17** (9): E.T. phoned home to ask for a new wig. It's a misunderstood goat, because despite it's glaring flaws, unlike every other track twice put out these past 2 years, Signal actually tried to at least do 'something', and I'll take it's highs and lows any day over the 'nothingness' of everything they've put out since.

**Johnnytoby** (9): hmmmmm

**llehuty** (9): Underrated little gem with a quirky instrumental that fits the alien theme

**Neferpitta** (9): People found it too repetitive/weird/oddly structured but I love it tbh.

**PostDebut** (9): I go from loving to hating this song constantly... Not gonna lie, I love it rn...

**Qustomar** (9): this song features a revamp of JYP's laate 2000s production, which many were not willing to embrace and appreciate, but i personally am a fan

**tinnnn\_lv** (9): i like this, the energy was much higher than the previous two songs plus the mv was really cute

**MissyBee37** (8.5): Unique song. The beat is so minimalist for most of it, in a good way.

**original\_doll** (8.5): I can't help but like this song lol

**amandapearl2** (8.1): Oh man, what a contested song. Signal was pretty widely hated when it dropped, by myself included. However. However, this shit has really grown on me lol. It’s catchy af, the dance is super fun, I love their styling. It also sounds really good in Japanese.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I remember hearing this for the first time and being like “wtf am I listening to” and hating it, but after listening to it a few times I actually really like it. It’s not an example of me forcing myself to like a song, it was the first TWICE song I ever heard so I didn’t have any kind of special attachment to it, I just think after the initial shock wears off it’s not actually *that* weird. The elements are almost intentionally grating, but in a freaky kind of way that’s actually really fun to bop along to and the antenna hands choreography is super fun. Uncharacteristically for TWICE though the raps aren’t that great.

**lilguavachan** (8): well it's their best song

**jonnyd86** (7.7): the atonal parts really do a disservice to some pretty parts melodically, love the harmonies in the chorus as well. but this song is kind of a beautiful mess

**jamesfog** (7.5): A noticeable step down in quality

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): alien music

**arrivederci1** (7.4): it's bad but good at the same time?? like i don't understand

**Akastavo** (7): would be a 10 if the song felt less dragged out

**dynamicity** (7): I still mourn the day JYP decided to ruin this absolute bop with that awful rapping hook.

**Kromorei** (7): A fan made youtube restructuring of this song made this a 10. However, this is not that. So it is a 7.

**SirFluffyButt13** (7): Felt like it could have used a bit more to the song but it is still enjoyable. Especially Nayeon and Jihyo's parts in the song. The *

**Qwilphish** (6.5): great instrumental terrible structure

**wugggs** (6.5): Hated it on release, and it really grew on me. still weird as hell but definitely boppy once it worms its way into your brain

**AroMorbid** (6): It doesn't the instant enjoyment I had with other Twice songs.

**maybe9** (6): its good, the instrumental is a 10

**nihilistickitten** (6): kinda cool

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I'm...not sure I get the appeal of TWICE so far, guys. Signal opens with a chant that clearly tries to be iconic, and to be fair, it gets into your head every now and then after listening to this song, but they're by no means the best starting lines to open a song with; in fact, they're a bit annoying. Then again, the chant is all I can remember about Signal; it devolves into a pretty confusingly generic pop song full of synths after that, and I can't muster up the will to pay attention to it and like it.

**RReg29** (6): bold but doesn’t quite completely come together

**Nixon4Prez** (5): It’s not as bad as people say but it’s still kinda bad

**bespectacled** (4): This song is a corny mess saved by a catchy chorus and a cute retro theme

**edmiliballs** (4): this entire track just feels bizarre

**grenjarl** (4): the background instrumental and verses aren't good on the ears

**kappyko** (4): nice synth selection and that is about it. nice doo doos

**Luxaria** (4): I just cannot like this one, it was actually one of the songs that stopped me getting into TWICE initially because it's annoying.

**popularsong** (4): i love disjointed songs but this was a bit tew much even for me

**satanicyoona** (4): she deserves much more

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (3): Alright I’m gonna pan this one a bit, but I’m also gonna praise it. Let me just start with one thing, to fully understand my praise, please listen to [this re-arranged version]( https://youtu.be/XLxh5G5hLx0). But let me start with the song as it is. A clunky fucking mess. Intro -> Rap Breakdown -> Verse 1 + Pre-chorus -> Chorus + Intro again -> Verse 2 + Pre-Chorus -> Chorus -> Dudududu + Chorus + MORE RAP BREAKDOWN.  Also I need to mention this is all really clunkily cut among the music. I can appreciate the fact Twice tried to do something different for once. But here it’s just… it’s shit. This is now how song structure should work okay. You do not jump from a fucking intro to a rap breakdown. The song had potential, okay it had it, and someone on the fucking cutting room said, “let’s not”. Okay now let me talk about this rearranged version, or how it should be. This version goes Intro -> Verse 1 + Pre-chorus -> Chorus -> Verse 2 + Pre-chorus -> Chorus -> Intro bit again -> OH HEY THE RAP BREAK DOWN -> Outro same sans secondary rap break. Which hey, holy shit it shines this way and is a solid track, but this isn’t the version we’re rating. So yeah, take the three and shove it somewhere dumb fucking producer that fucked up this song.

**WeirdSignal** (3): why didn't jyp just use the fantasy park version smh

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): connection lost

**PuggleMaster** (2): the intro is HORRID

**gowestyoungkanye** (1): i think the reason i hate twice so much is because their overly cutesy concepts just disturb me, especially cause tzuyu is like, REALLY young, and also their music is bad

**Hyperion2589** (0): Absolutely hate the spoken semi-rap portion. No catchy chorus to save this abomination.

**lexarqade** (0): Sorry, I have to do it. Twice songs are super hit or miss for me - when they hit, they hit big, but when they miss, they REALLY miss. I couldn't get through this song when it released and I can't to this day.

**MrSwearword** (0): this is Girls Generation/GEE levels of heinous. GET IT AWAY FROM ME

**selegend** (6): BBC needs to let this song die already. That intro is luscious though.

---
**Ghost-Quartet** (11): My 11! This track is absolutely beautiful. There’s a well-paced methodical feeling to this track, it’s carefully measured and gentle in a way that I think belies trepidation. This a song that moves forwards tenderly, step by step, until that chorus hits where the girls explode with energy as they describe their dreams. I know some people overlook 1/3 but I really think they have the prettiest voices in LOONA and that’s really on display here, they sound so sweet and really elevate the material. The music video is also a personal favorite of mine, it’s wonderfully aesthetic and the storyline really gets to me. Strange as it sounds the story of Vivi the android girl really resonated with me. I’ve always kind of struggled to fit in with other people, I see them doing things, and I want to interact with them, but for some reason I just can’t connect with them. I feel distant and robotic, like even when we do the same things it’s somehow not the same. So it always gets me when the breakdown of the song starts and things get all melancholy and Vivi realizes what’s wrong with her and makes the choice to unplug herself so she can feel tired and human, even if it means she shuts down. When that final chorus ends and HeeJin belts that big note and Vivi sprints off into the distance as the girls sing “you are the only one, you are my miracle” and collapses as those strings slide out… it’s such a euphoric climax. For those who are worried though, the special music video for “You And Me Together” (a cut from the mini-album) reveals that [the girls know that Vivi is a robot and plug her back in when she powers down.](https://youtu.be/2_r4kDUzslg?t=66) Fully expecting this to get chopped early in the rate because people don’t appreciate innocent concepts, but I really love it. Also, read my [+ +] review.

**Hyperion2589** (10): Light hearted cheery song guaranteed to lift your spirits up.

**maybe9** (10): SOFT AND DELICIOUS YES UGH I STAN

**lexarqade** (9): JIGEUM BO GO SIPEO! I love this song, it's so happy and was our first look at loona units. I can't believe this is like 2 years old jesus christ

**lilguavachan** (9): this went up to GFriend's cute songs and said, "i'm you but stronger"

**onceberry** (8.8): Magical

**AroMorbid** (8.5): One of the cutest song I've heard!

**kappyko** (8.5): The transition from GFRIEND to this is a slay because they exist in the same universe of cutesy maximal yet elegant dance pop and like fucking listen okay my ASS was beat to death by the cheery synths it does get a little tiring though

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Now, this is how you do a cute ballad that's still worth listening to even if you have no idea what the singers are talking about! Take hints, GFRIEND. Even going past the adorable refrain of 'With all my heart', LOONA's voices here are perfect for a simple love song like this; there's no belting here, just warm, fuzzy feelings. Love and Live strikes me as a kind of song you'd just like listening to, despite not liking one part of it even better than the others; in other words, it's good background music, and I promise I'm not saying this in a shady way.

**1998tweety** (8.3): This is a decent track but doesn't feel super memorable.

**bespectacled** (8): RIP loonetheworld concept, we're gonna watch a video on an apartment complex and a track-and-field and we're still gonna stan

**c0ns3rvative** (8): Surprisingly rhythmic and hard-hitting considering the overall sonic palette. There's an amazing syncopated interplay between the synth hits, bass and percussion on the chorus that drives the track forward perfectly. Some of the vocal processing sounds slightly sharp and overdone but it's masked well by the surrounding elements

**gowestyoungkanye** (8): i may have a policy about ballad-y songs, but this is a tune, certifiable, so you can have this loona 1/3

**minsiii** (8): loona 1/3 are so diverse in style!

**tapdancingpig** (8): Pretty cute.

**Neferpitta** (7.5): So this is who femmebot was about.

**original\_doll** (7.5): not their catchiest song but it's still good

**amandapearl2** (7.3): This music video is so precious. This is an enjoyable release, light and refreshing.

**bluepupz** (7): The synth is nice! It's very bubbly-sounding

**GroceryStore** (7): Forgettable

**jamesfog** (7): I expected more

**Meepmeepmusik** (7): Wow you guys really left off their best songs didn't you

**ttandrew** (7): cute

**popularsong** (6): it's cute and i love the instrumentals but it's a bit of a bore to listen through

**RReg29** (6): it’s okay

**jonnyd86** (5.5): hook is cute but overall the song is missing something. not quite catchy enough for me

**dynamicity** (5): The mix feels too treble heavy and strangely empty as a result. The melody isn't very memorable either - it doesn't feel like the song has a real climax.

**grenjarl** (5): song has weird pacing

**MrSwearword** (5): this is white fondant in music form; sweet but really fucking plain

**WeirdSignal** (5): this song is just average to me, hyunjins part is nice

**edmiliballs** (4.5): underwhelming

**Nixon4Prez** (4): nah

**Qwilphish** (4): This song made me uninteresed in LOONA

**\_xSyracuse** (3): sorry girlies but this is one of Loona's worst tracks

**Kromorei** (3): This sounds like it could be played in a WalMart at 3am. Really boring and nondescript, and it doesn't stand out at all. If LOONA wants to be treated like they aren't a Nugu they should make an effort to make better songs than elevator music.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (3): And here we go again with the cutesy shit. Save me. Okay, I had some sweet-tart like lego brick looking ass candies, and those were sweet, but not as sweet as this shit. Outside of the cute shit is it a bad song? Nah. It’s alright. Just feels like a TWICE reject tho. Like tell me you can’t see TWICE singing their little hearts out to this. You and I both know it works.

**satanicyoona** (3): i have nothing against this sub-unit im just not big on soft songs unless they're heartbreaking

**wugggs** (2): Not their best at all, vocals are struggling here and I can barely make it through the song tbh

**40073521** (1): It's so boring and forgettable

**Luxaria** (9): Honestly one of the best groups out there for managing to fit the raps into the song, especially considering the cuter concepts they go for. (Continues the trend of them all wanting to dress up differently and then having to create the whole MV around that, I love it)

**onceberry** (9): The verses are perfect

**jonnyd86** (8.5): a hook for the ages, im actually not a big fan of the Real Man dance break, but the rest of the song makes up for it. the Sana-Tzuyu-Momo prechorus sequence in particular

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Oh, I think this was a hit in the Philippines, too. I recognize the 'cheer up, baby, cheer up, baby' hook very well; I remember hearing it all the time not too long ago, although I swear TWICE's accents make it sound like 'come on'. It still sounds a little unfinished, but I'd be lying if I'd say it isn't a bop.

**Qwilphish** (8.5): i wanted to not like it, but its great

**Akastavo** (8): iconic song with iconic memes

**Hyperion2589** (8): Catchy chorus but otherwise another standard cute pop song.

**Johnnytoby** (8): :/

**MissyBee37** (8): The chorus is my favorite part of this song; definitely catchy.

**dynamicity** (7.5): Annoyingly saccharine, this song doesn't shy away from cuteness in the slightest. It's easy to see why it was so popular, with a stupidly catchy chorus and easily memeable lines.

**maybe9** (7.5): quirky, but a bop

**amandapearl2** (7.2): Their breakout hit. Sana’s “shy shy shy” in the pre-chorus is quite adorable, but it took me a long time to warm up to this song. It was not love at first sight.

**bespectacled** (7): Korea never looked back after hearing this bop and officially became twicenation. I don't actually like this song, but I give this is a decent score for the Chungking Express reference. Jeongyeon cosplaying faye wong might be my gay-to-maybe-a-bit-bisexual awakening

**MrSwearword** (7): not as horrid as I thought it'd be but against other songs/groups in the rate it barely has a place

**Neferpitta** (7): Falls a bit flat compared to their other stuff. The "real man" bit is kinda annoying too.

**wugggs** (7): a jam, but the lyrics are kinda morally reprehensible so it loses some points for me

**kappyko** (6.5): i like it but i dont

**minsiii** (6): instrumentation is super weak it the actual sung parts sound great

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I love TWICE’s whole “let’s give every girl in the video a completely different concept” thing, it makes their videos super fun to watch. Like, I love how they just kind of imply that one of the girls is randomly murdered. It’s crackers. In a similar vein I think the most interesting part about this song is the way the girls trade lines back and forth on the verses, I don’t know why but I think it’s super cool. The chorus itself is grating and the bridge… any mention of the phrase “real man” makes me roll my eyes.

**nihilistickitten** (5): not for me

**heeyeon** (4): i only listen to this for sana tbh

**Kromorei** (4): This song is highkey unlistenable trash.

**lexarqade** (3): This skyrocketed TWICE into fame which is unfortunate because I HATE this song with a burning passion, and also because they are absolutely saying Chore Up

**modotrising** (3): I have a lot of problems with Twice's first songs' lyrics but thankfully they fixed that with time

**original\_doll** (3): that chorus will forever sound like 'shut up baby' to me. I know it was their breakout song but it's just annoying to me

**popularsong** (3): ITS ICONIC BUT i absolutely despise it as a song. too cutesy and boring. feels like sugar crunching on my teeth in a bad way

**tinnnn\_lv** (3): sounds like the last song but done less well

**RReg29** (2): this is the type of track Dick Cheney’s plays at GITMO to torture prisoners

**satanicyoona** (2): this song is such a mess i want to cry

**gowestyoungkanye** (1): if i gave 0s this would be a fucking zero. this has literally no reason to be so popular. normally choruses are the redeeming parts of kpop songs, but this one is so GRATING. their voices sound wrong together it’s bizarre.

**ttandrew** (1): mess

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (0): To say I hate this song is somehow an understatement. How the fuck this one got big is still beyond me. It is just not good. You know the vision TWICE had with Like OOH-AHH? Yeah that was gone with this. I knew it the minute shy was dropped three times within like 10 seconds. And the chorus, oh god the real abomination. I will not churro baby. I will not cherub baby. And it’s not even like a pronunciation thing that makes me hate it. I get it, there’s certain sounds that are used to in the Korean alphabet, so it results in stuff like this, rookie, ya know. I get that. But this song is just annoying, and that fucking chorus is the binnacle of the annoyingness. I suppose the only redeeming thing is the fact the vid references a bunch of cool movies. But when that’s literally all you have going for you…. It’s not going to be a good time.

**selegend** (4): It's boring on the third try. Glad they decided to move on after this.

---
**\_xSyracuse** (10): they went OFF

**gannade** (10): i like the sudden change

**Kromorei** (10): Hyelin and Solji have to be one of the best female vocal lines in KPOP. Jesus christ. This song slaps so hard I don't care what anyone thinks, it's funky. Also Hani please burn that green wig.

**MrSwearword** (10): kitschy and cute

**PostDebut** (10): Yeah it's a total Up & Down ripoff but it's better???

**Hyperion2589** (9): Great 90 funk sound. Wish they went through with the "Everybody Dance Now".

**lilguavachan** (9): what the fuck why have i skipped over this girl group

**Qwilphish** (9): Nobody does sexy as well as EXID and this song is evidence of that

**1998tweety** (8.8): This sounds like the kind of kpop song that would make a crossover to the west.

**kappyko** (8.5): EXID channel late '80s/early '90s dance groove, with the right amount of attitude, vocal eccentricity, and, yes, cowbell. I don't understand the need for the pre-chorus but it's easily something that plays to their strengths. The pre-choruses are unfortunately a bit misplaced.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Haha, nice to see a song dedicated to the gayest colour in existence that isn't white (jokes). Hot Pink is probably EXID's best song in this rate, along with L.I.E. coupled with solid, funky production, the ever-catchy chorus of 'PINK HOT, PINK HOT' is a real easy way to get the song stuck in your head. Nothing special, but it's great.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8.5): Look I love this song too, but it just doesn’t bang as hard anymore. I don’t have too much to say about this other than that. But hey if the video for this didn’t start my “I am so fucking gay for LE” lifestyle idk what did.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): wtf this is catchy

**c0ns3rvative** (8): Great track, the cowbells and "work it out" refrain are very reminiscent of an early Neptures or Timbaland joint and the sax and bass lines do a great job rounding out the instrumental. I really dig the repeated "hot pink" refrain on the chorus too - provides a really fun basis for Solji to riff on top of

**dynamicity** (8): This song draws heavily from Missy Elliot and EXID's prior works to create a surprisingly compelling mix. Though Jeonghwa's verse drags a bit, the spunky rap verses and swelling chorus ("Everybody knows!") are enough to keep things memorable.

**Luxaria** (8): If I had to pick a GG to be in a gang with I'd pick EXID, this is very reminiscent of some type of pop from the 00s but I can't nail it down.

**minsiii** (8): wow they are high key weird. Love it!

**popularsong** (8): i dont dislike it like majority of fandom does and appreciate jeonghwas part, but i feel like the "pink hot pink hot" parts kinda lack that catchy oomph

**tapdancingpig** (8): I don’t know if that’s a sample there, but it sounds fucking awesome.

**vodkainsipido** (8): whew this was a banger

**wugggs** (8): Good but not their best

**jonnyd86** (7.5): catchy and the underlying rhythm is infectious (love the Run DMC Peter Piper sample)

**amandapearl2** (7.4): I really enjoy the 90s throwback sounds with the enthusiastic triangle and the “push push work it out” guy. It’s not quite as infectious as their breakout songs, but still really fun.

**chainedapart** (7): EXID's weakest song in this list

**jamesfog** (7): Is this song about they pussies

**lexarqade** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5PW7NlAlYE enough said.

**Mudkip1** (7): is it mine? is it?

**Neferpitta** (7): I think there's a euphemism somewhere in here.

**original\_doll** (7): I haven't listened to much EXID outside of up & down before now, and what I'm realizing is that some of their songs kinda sound same-y to me :/

**ttandrew** (7): cute

**edmiliballs** (6): alright they lost me a little with this one

**RReg29** (6): fun verses let down by grating chorus. The two main lead vocalists keep this baby afloat

**bluepupz** (5): Not a fan of that "push, push, work it out, never stop it girl, work it out" bit, and the production isn't my favorite. Also, the repetitive bit (Pink, hot) is my least favorite of all the times EXID has had a repetitive short phrase in their songs

**gowestyoungkanye** (4.1): i’m not feeling it. also while i’m thinking about it clc should have been in this rate.

**cyborglilith** (4): This sounds like a good Ariana Grande song, but I just wish that rap girl had a normal voice.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): This really feels like a retread of “Up & Down,” in a bad way. “Up & Down” teetered on the edge of being annoying but won out on being fun, while the elements of this are just grating. I also really hate that full stop in the middle, especially since the song continues without any real changes afterwards. I kept checking to see if the track had just restarted.

**Johnnytoby** (4): Probably gonna go on the first day skksksk

**nihilistickitten** (4): forgettable

**franch** (3): really can't deal with this cheesy "push work it out" stuff

**maybe9** (3): what a mess, it could've been so good, minus the weird cut away bridge and guys voice sample

**tinnnn\_lv** (1): sounds even more like the last one!!

I think the choreo for this  is terrible, but the song is pretty solidly catchy. I can understandably imagine that a lot of people don't like the rap parts though.

**raicicle** (8): wendy snapped

---
**agentofscranton** (10): ha penis

**bluepupz** (10): I initially was confused/didn't like this song very much, but it crept up on me out of nowhere and became one of my favorite Red Velvet songs. Wendy shines in that "Shine on me" part!

**franch** (10): god this song just makes me so, well, happy.

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): queens of controversy, that note wendy’s racist ass hits, and not having yeri yet

**Hyperion2589** (10): Absolutely love the tribal beats, satisfying harmonies through the entire song.

**musicalpets** (10): truly their best song

**PuggleMaster** (10): HAP PENIS!!!

**Johnnytoby** (9): Litty

**lexarqade** (9): A great debut but I cannot unhear "HAVE PENIS!"

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9): ARE YOU HAPPY HUH? Explosive. That’s the fucking song. Backed by an African music beat (SM’s description, probably, welcome to kpop we have odd song descriptions) and falling overall under the likes of europop, Happiness is a fun song that works as a debut. It’s loud/in your face/fun. And that’s what SM wanted to showcase with RV. (Seriously, what the fucking video, hits it right on) Apart from the fun of the song. There’s the bridge which Wendy fucking goes to town on. Say all you want about her, but you cannot deny that fucking bridge is captivating because she soars.

**edmiliballs** (8.8): B O O Y A H

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): now I’m definitely overwhelmed

**original\_doll** (8.5): booyah!

**1998tweety** (8.4): RV has come a really long way from this; wow it sounds so different from their current stuff.

**Qustomar** (8.4): ok so this song i always joke and tell myself that it's trash, but i can't help but love it, and ive accidentally listened to it on loop for so many hours, that this is my most listened to song on spotify. this song is truly underrated and was overshadowed by the use of red velvet by sm as their suicide soldier, for creating controversy to distract from other controversies going at sm

**arrivederci1** (8): shine on me let it shine on meeeee is iconic and wendy's vocals snatched everyone's wig

**dynamicity** (8): I'm sorry but this is still RV's greatest bop. Seulgi's tropical breakdown and Wendy's Bridge elevate the song.

**grenjarl** (8): A great showing of all members

**Mudkip1** (8): LALALALALALALALLAALALALALALALALAA

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): People talk about what unique structures K-Pop songs have, and I think Happiness is a weird, nice little example of that; it opens with 'Sometimes, you gotta be bold!' which sounds like a meme on its own, and then it basically turns into hook central, weird a weird, rattly bridge coming up every minute. Strangely enough, that's why it works; it's not a song I'd get used to on its own, but it's a great introduction to Red Velvet's song composition.

**amandapearl2** (7.6): Another one of my original kpop songs. Wendy’s “shine on me” is one of my favorite vocal bridges in all of kpop.

**Banananaise** (7.5): i will NEVER understand how someone can fuck up so bad that they not only accidentally put 9/11 pictures in the cute pop video but ALSO hiroshima/nagasaki pictures??? the video also fascinates me because Yeri wasn't in the group yet but a whole load of SM rookies (including Yeri) were included in the MV and there are a lot of theories about SM having planned for RV to be a 'graduation' type group with lots of members being rotated in and out

**c0ns3rvative** (7.5): Still the best tropical-flavored RV single, love contrast between the rather length build-up sections and the amazing sung harmonies on the chorus

**GroceryStore** (7.5): Hated it at first, grew to like it. Iconic intro

**jamesfog** (7.5): Ha penis

**jonnyd86** (7.5): BOOYAH! love the hook and the wholesomeness and the positivity of the song. the rapping is kind cringey but that's SM for you

**kappyko** (7.5): not quite as sugary as u would expect but it's a goodly tune yea yea yah

**Kromorei** (7.5): I'm honestly not a big fan of this song but it's still pretty damn good.

**bespectacled** (7): Their debut title is their weakest title so far, and I think that's beautiful

**Luxaria** (7): Here, the completely random belt from Wendy is so out of place but so good- I couldn't work out if I should mark it up or down.

**AroMorbid** (6.5): Not my favorite.

**Neferpitta** (6.5): This would be a mostly unremarkable debut if it wasn't for Wendy's iconic SHINE ON ME.

**Nixon4Prez** (6.5): Underwhelming aside from Wendy’s ‘Shine on me’

**Chubiski** (6): the bridge is so random but I guess they needed a way to show off wendy’s vocals.

**ttandrew** (6): iconic

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): Can you believe that there are people who hate Yeri for “ruining” the OT4 when they were putting out songs like this? What am I listening to? Is this what world music is? This is absolutely bizarre. I can’t say that it’s bad, it has some nice moments(the chorus is annoyingly catchy) but for the most part it’s just noise. What a weird debut song. Also, I’m not one of those “all Asian people look the same” types because I think that’s super offensive but I literally can’t tell the girls apart in this video.

**maybe9** (5): its basic

**MrSwearword** (5): more like blandness but whatever

**Qwilphish** (5): such a weird song, doesn't know what it wants to be. That bridge is iconic though

**RReg29** (5): nah, not quite

**tinnnn\_lv** (5): weird but the instrumental and production is really good!!

**wugggs** (5): just OK, I think they really improved later in their career and honestly Yeri would've shined on this song :/

**popularsong** (4): cute but doesnt have much else going for it

**PostDebut** (4): I kinda hate this

**heeyeon** (3): gets war flashbacks of joy's forced smile

**satanicyoona** (3): i've bopped to this too many times in the past 4 years

This still happens, anytime some in-SM "controversy" happens it seem pushes out RV and is like "GO! DISTRACT!" at first I thought it was a bit odd and then I started to see a trend... Seems to have slowed down within the past year (Except like maybe Bad Boy... which if we really wanna count that yikes...) but yeah.

**selegend** (4): If each of their singles were Starbursts, this would be the cherry flavor.

**raicicle** (8): im sorry but this is actually a good red velvet song despite what people say

---
**c0ns3rvative** (11): Amazing, the bassline is so beefy and becomes especially sickening when it doubles on the pre. The bridge is possibly the best one in RV's discography, the gradual stacking of the vocoder'd vocals sounds incredible and the other instruments - I want to say that they're live session instruments? - provide such a punchy transition to the last chorus. I don't want to see anybody hating on the lookie lookie motif either. Intellectuals only

**Chubiski** (11): lookiesus cleansed my soul and saved my life.

**wugggs** (11): hated this song on release, and now it's the #1 most played song in my iTunes library. Tough to chew on at first but wow what an absolute masterpiece

---
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): BOP BOP BOP

**kappyko** (10): best part of the song is the producer tag at the beginning no shit that is so hype omfg looky looky its good lol mud is racist

**Qwilphish** (10): the instrumental for this song is one of the best in kpop

**Meepmeepmusik** (9.5): yes, I am that bitch

**original\_doll** (9.5): only people with good taste can recognize how great this song is

**WeirdSignal** (9.5): LOOKIE LOOKIE

**arrivederci1** (9): used to think this was the devil's song but now i really love it and i always lookie lookie along

**dynamicity** (9): I could wax poetic about how incredible this instrumental is, but I will simply say that it perfectly complements the vocals, standing out in all the right ways but never too much.

**Johnnytoby** (9): its catchy I gues....

**maybe9** (9): the best prechorus in kpop

**popularsong** (9): say what u want but its a good song

**1998tweety** (8.7): This one is definitely gonna be controversial because of the chorus. What can I say its a huge bop. Sure the chorus is a bit annoying but the verses kill.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.7): This song really annoyed me at first but the more I listen to it the more I just surrendered to it and found myself having a ton of fun. Objectively it’s dumb but it succeeds in being overcoming that by being so energetic it transitions right into madcap, which is a great place to be. Also a very underrated music video by them, it’s perhaps the most crackerjacks that they’ve ever gone and it really intrigued me. [There’s a song on this mini-album, “Body Talk,” that is basically the best Red Velvet song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37GkANTikEw&frags=pl%2Cwn)

**jonnyd86** (8.7): the Korean R/L in the hook will always kind of make me snicker but the prechorus is near perfection, I love Yeri's nasally tone the second time around.

**bespectacled** (8): side-eyeing people who make fun of koreans' (east asians in general) pronunciation of the letter R

**Hyperion2589** (8): Another repetitive chorus, but way more catchy melodies in verses and pre-chorus this time.

**MrSwearword** (8): cute and weird but just a scoche meh

**Neferpitta** (8): I want to hate this but it's too catchy.

**satanicyoona** (8): this song gets way too much hate despite being godlike and its time someone stood up and did something about it.

**ttandrew** (8): underrated

**amandapearl2** (7.7): Talk about polarizing. I couldn’t figure out how I felt about this song when it first dropped. I’ve grown to love it of course, it’s fun and upbeat and maybe a little crazy but it’s part of it’s charm.

**Qustomar** (7.5): rookie rookie is not that bad, and i liked the monster in the video :( i especially love how much joy's parts shine in this song. rookie and signal i feel exist in the same universe of overly disparaged

**Akastavo** (7): the pre chorus is so good

**bluepupz** (7): I'm amused by how Rookie isn't pronounced properly at all during this. It's fun though

**lexarqade** (7): Oh the DRAMA when this was released... People really did not like this. I still think it's their worst title track.

**minsiii** (7): lookielookielookielookielookielookie

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Kind of a clone of Dumb Dumb, if I'm being honest, although given that, I'd easily prefer Dumb Dumb any day. This is catchy enough, and I like the niche of having an American-sounding intro at the beginning, but the hook is an earworm to an annoying degree and there's not much of substance here.

**Nixon4Prez** (6.5): I can’t tell if this song is brilliant or terrible or a bit of both

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6.5): This song… This fucking song… Oh boy where do I start. Okay so this one I know for a fact I fucking hated when it came out. I’ll start with that. Okay so yeah, when this dropped, I was pissed, they had gone full cutesy. But then it happened… IT GOT STUCK IN MY HEAD. Enter me listening to this song on repeat on because fuck everything right. Now I’ll be honest, I remember this comeback vividly because of the fact that the site design for the era had you play Where’s Wally with the girls to get to the teaser images. To say this song grew on me is an understatement. It was more like it attacked me and said, “LISTEN TO ME, YOU KNOW YOU WANNA, YOU KNOW THIS IS CATCHY” and it was right. It’s catchy all right. But does that mean it’s really that good…. Nah… it’s a bit of a fucking mess. But like in the best way I suppose, but also the worst way. Best way because while it’s messy, it works together (eat a dick RBB you wish you could this). But also in the bad way because holy fuck is it a clusterfuck if you are not used to it. So yeah, Rookie is a song by Red Velvet that exists, and it may be good or bad depending on your own thoughts.

**grenjarl** (6): again not a great chorus

**Kromorei** (6): Their worst song. ew. Boot.

**Luxaria** (6): I just... don't like it. (Seulgi wins in the MV though, wtf girl how can you look that good?)

**skargardin** (5): not feeling this one tbh

**gowestyoungkanye** (4.5): seulgi is powerful as fuck, don’t get me wrong, but she cannot get me to like rookie

**GroceryStore** (4): Chorus ruins the song

**RReg29** (4): way too grating

**tinnnn\_lv** (4): uhhh weird song but loved the bass in the beginning

**edmiliballs** (3.5): oh boy this really isn't it

**BiPolarBear17** (3): The really groovy bass and the lovely vocals in the pre-chorus are the only things that save this from being a 1.

**franch** (2): okay this is repetitive to the point of annoying

**nihilistickitten** (2): no thanks

**Mudkip1** (0): i found this annoying

**selegend** (9): 1/3 did NOT serve orchestral perfection to be robbed like this! The instrumental break is to die for. I hope we get more of this sound from LOONA in the future.

---
**minsiii** (11): SSSOOOO GOOOOOD STAN LOONA

**popularsong** (11): OOF i was so worried they wont do songs in style of let me in, good thing i didnt have to worry and 1/3 saved me. incredible fantastic showstopping never been done before

**WeirdSignal** (11): BRING BACK CLASSICAL LOONA 1/3 PLEASE

---
**\_xSyracuse** (10): the tango drop is latin influence done correct

**cyborglilith** (10): I'm wowed. This is magical.

**GroceryStore** (10): Beautiful harmonies/instrumental

**Hyperion2589** (10): Never heard something like this in pop, adapting a lot of classical music ideas. An adventurous piece.

**lexarqade** (10): The level of professionalism... FAR too much

**PuggleMaster** (10): This is the song that made me want to stan Loona so i hope it wins if RV can't

**original\_doll** (9.5): the orchestral parts of this are soo good and such a fresh sound in kpop imo

**Qustomar** (9.5): y is this song that makes me want to cry before the slut drop song on this rate :,(

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Read my [+ +] review.

**maybe9** (9): its gorgina also yes to the latin instrumental breakdown

**AroMorbid** (8.5): Definitely had to grow on me, but I like it

**kappyko** (8.5): GEtting my Disney princess fantasy to this

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Given that almost of us East Asian kids (tried) to pick up music as an extracurricular, it's no surprise string instruments would pop up in this rate, eventually! Though Sonatine falls a little short of being baroque pop (somebody submit it to indieheads) it's still an excellent blend of classic a new; two ballads in a row might be boring, but LOONA manages to pull off both of them very well.

**1998tweety** (8.4): A bit more interesting than the previous track, but this sub-unit has failed to really captivate me.

**arrivederci1** (8): the tango part is my favourite and bumped this score up higher because of it

**Neferpitta** (8): This is the kind of ballad I enjoy - still has an interesting instrumental and doesn't move at a snail's pace. Even has a little jazzy moment.

**PostDebut** (8): I never listened to LOONA before this rate and wow this song is pretty

**Qwilphish** (8): The strings and harmonies are so beautiful

**ttandrew** (8): bop

**bespectacled** (7.5): Ballads and slow songs are loona's weak points imo but still a cute song. Very holiday-y

**bluepupz** (7.3): Their voices blend together nicely here, and I'm a fan of the orchestral elements

**dynamicity** (7): This is a wonderfully cinematic song that swells to a satisfying climax. The tango-style break is a nice twist that adds some real flavor.

**Luxaria** (7): This is weirdly entrancing to listen to

**RReg29** (7): took a left turn there…I dig it

**tinnnn\_lv** (7): enjoyed this song !

**amandapearl2** (6.5): I know I’m in the minority on this one, but Sonatine never really stuck with me. It’s pretty, but not something I really seek out. While I really like the instrumentals, especially the tango influence, from an intellectual standpoint, emotionally it doesn’t affect me the way I’d like a ballad to.

**MrSwearword** (6): the harmonizing is fabulous but jesus fuck this is so bland

**wugggs** (5.5): A solid ballad that has nice buildup but again, vocals

**Kromorei** (5): LOONA 1/3 is probably my least favorite subunit. This song is so fucking boring. I feel like they want to make ballads or be emotional or something but this just doesn't work. It just manages to be boring. I actually had to lower my Love & Live score due to it being quite a bit worse than this.

**nihilistickitten** (5): pretty vocals but put me to sleep

**jonnyd86** (4): its a balladesque song but no one's vocals really blow me away so it doesn't really do it for me.

**gowestyoungkanye** (2): this, however, does not get a ballad pass because of the PIANO ugh loona’s individual singles are better than the group songs and it’s like how did you fuck up so badly

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (1): Andddddddddd it’s a ballad. Now normally, I wouldn’t make a criticism like this since it is a ballad, but… the fucking over-singing. This song feels like it should be a softer song and they just refuse to let you believe that with the vocals. I mean it’s fine once all the orchestra picks up, but in the start and many other parts of the song it is just annoying. So in other words, this probably works best as an instrumental, sorry.

**jamesfog** (0): This is so boring.

**selegend** (9): Basic but also tons of fun. I love the breakdown towards the end of the song.

---
**Hyperion2589** (10): Yes I am feeling the hype.

**maybe9** (10): MangoBanger

**Qwilphish** (10): Its such a good song - ughheuaflksdnja

**WeirdSignal** (10): mamamoos magnum opus right here

**BiPolarBear17** (9.5): A catchy, unapologetic pop bop! It's not exactly the usual sound Mamamoo lean towards, but that's not a bad thing cause this song well and truly goes off. The lyrics being confident and empowering is a super sweet added bonus.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9.5): Welcome to Res pulled a really dumb move when this comeback happened. Alright let me sum it up, I was pissed over MAMAMOO about some controversies they had. So, I might as well have told them to stick a sock in it for this comeback. Motherfuckers, I FUCKED UPOkay this song fucking BANGS/BOPS. It’s a fun fucking song and I was too busy being an ass to realize it. I now have seen the error of my ways and have seen the light. Also, the breakdown in the bridge on this reminds me of Taller Than You, another MAMAMOO banger. In that one they all rap about their height differences, it’s comical but I love it. Also the video for this one is really nice.

**1998tweety** (9): I feel like I have a bit of a love hate relationship with this song. I love getting the double rap verse from Hwasa and Moonbyul, but some parts of this song feel a bit weird like the bridge which is kind of out of place. Nonetheless its fun and stands out compared to other kpop tracks, something Mamamoo has always done.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): help me they all look hot

**Nixon4Prez** (8.5): Just a super fun song

**wugggs** (8.5): Really energetic and poppy, love Hwasa on this song

**bluepupz** (8): I love how self-assured they are in singing this, and the baseline is great

**gowestyoungkanye** (8): mamamoo if you’re reading this, kill me, my address is

**kappyko** (8): like it's okay but im getting a little nervous for non-mamamoo related reasons. an extra half point for the "how i roll" vocal section

**Kromorei** (8): They honestly kinda did that tbh!

**lilguavachan** (8): i wasn't immediately drawn to it like the others... but if this is their worst then damn

**Luxaria** (8): That rap break is so good.

**MrSwearword** (8): different for them and while not entirely bad, it falls short compared to other songs.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I like the lead-in to the song a lot, and the electronic beat all throughout is worthy of commendation, but I feel as if Yes I Am amounts to slightly less than the sum of its parts. Though catchy hooks make the track enjoyable, the robotic voice repeating the title is a little annoying, and overall, as a song, Yes I Am doesn't seem to fit a group performance as well as some of MAMAMOO's other hits. Sorry.

**jonnyd86** (7.5): this song grew on me.. i didn't like it at first because i thought the verses were kind of meh, but the hook is great.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I love a good robot voice interjecting into a song but it doesn’t elevate this one above just good.

**minsiii** (7): the rap sections carry the song HARD

**amandapearl2** (6.5): I completely forgot about this song. It’s fun and funky, but not an earworm like some of their previous releases.

**dynamicity** (6.5): While fun and topical, this song ultimately lacks the depth and soul of Mamamoo's other works.

**RReg29** (6): okay

**Neferpitta** (5): It has some fun verses but an incredibly grating chorus where the entire melody is confined to a single note repeated every few seconds.

**ttandrew** (1): yawn

**selegend** (5): Well first, it's tú not tu. Secondly, I can see this going down as a K-pop classic in the future even though it's not exactly unique or entrancing.

**raicicle** (10): classic

---
**Akastavo** (10): cute track

**Chubiski** (10): iconic song

**Hyperion2589** (10): One of the best song of 2015, perfect mix of modern and retro.

**Mudkip1** (10): i love how ive heard this before kpop twitter won

**original\_doll** (9.5): awe I really like this song! just brings a smile to my face

**amandapearl2** (9.2): Another song with a fancam that rocketed a group to stardom. Sugary sweet and totally perfect. This is everything I love in a kpop girl group.

**Johnnytoby** (9): The intro is so cringy pero the rest es bueno

**kappyko** (9): This sounds like what I imagine LOONA 1/3 to sound like lol it's catchy

**lexarqade** (9): When Yuju busts into that high note I feel my pussy quiver on god

**lilguavachan** (9): i mean, i usually don't really like kpop girl groups that are super cutesy but this is cute in that "opening of a slice of life show" kind of way

**minsiii** (9): so nostalgic for this song

**Qustomar** (9): i might just love this song because i am a stan of Into the New World, and while this song doesn't get to the full impact of INTW, it tries

**tapdancingpig** (9): This song sounds like a delectable 90’s bop.

**1998tweety** (8.9): I had this scored a bit lower but the bridge into the last chorus bumped it up hard. The thing I love about Asian pop rock is that they really pull out all the stops at the very end of the song.

**chainedapart** (8.5): A cursed song that gives the artists a higher chance of meeting the hard floor face to face.

**AroMorbid** (8): The only Gfriend song I had already listened to. Love that they used Spanish lyrics :)

**arrivederci1** (8): this song makes me want to dance

**Kromorei** (8): To be honest GFRIEND has always been a second rate TWICE to me. This is a bop though.

**Neferpitta** (8): It's cute, it's catchy as fuck, sometimes it doesn't have to be deeper than that.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Is this a Korean telenovela theme song? Well, it's funny to hear a Spanish hook on a Korean pop song, but, hey, globalism is the future, isn't it? Me Gustas Tu has one word suited for it in my book, and that's adorable. It might not be much more than your usual bubblegum pop single, but GFRIEND's sugar sweet delivery elevates it into a song that acts as the kind of track you'd listened to after a bad day in order to get fuzzy feelings. It's pretty average on its own, but GFRIEND does it just right.

**popularsong** (8): it just feels like a quintessential kpop gg song but in a good way, so cute. why isnt glass bead on thisss also

**RReg29** (8): inject that early SNSD into my veins. Good pop songwriting here

**ttandrew** (8): classic

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Why the Spanish? I mean, I guess you could ask why English, but why Spanish? Anyways this song is a lot of fun.

**jonnyd86** (7.5): what an earworm of a hook. verses are cute but slightly pedestrian. but man, what a hook. Yuju slays the high note too.. still gives me chills even after all these listens

**bluepupz** (7): I guess I'd describe this as cute and innocent

**cyborglilith** (7): basic

**dynamicity** (7): A nice song with a refreshingly sweet chorus. The verses plod a bit, but the transition from the prechorus to chorus is a thing of beauty. The synth riff after the chorus ruins the vibe a bit and the electric guitar feels a bit forced.

**impeccabletim** (7): Invented Spanish

**maybe9** (7): barebones bubble pop

**PostDebut** (7): Super Junior who? GFRIEND brought Spanish into kpop wbk. Latinas stay winning.

**modotrising** (6.8): I always laugh at the combination of cute girlgroupy sound with electric guitar and record scratches. A classic.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): they are so many… appreciate the use of spanish tho

**franch** (6): i like all of this well enough but it sort of all sounds the same

**jamesfog** (6): Sounds like it was released in the 90s and not in a good way

**Luxaria** (6): The K-Pop phenomenon of grabbing words from other languages to rhyme them kills me every time.

**tinnnn\_lv** (6): not a fan of the cheesy chorus but the dancing impressed

**wugggs** (6): This was a breakthrough hit for them but tbh it lacks the oomph they brought with Rough and Navillera

**gowestyoungkanye** (5): this sounds like the archetypal girl group song, donde es the boundary pushing

**GroceryStore** (5): Overplayed/Produce 101 ruined the song

**MrSwearword** (5): blerrrrrrrgh at how 1999/2000 teen pop level saccharine this shit is; bonus points for a Spanish title

**Qwilphish** (4): I can appreciate it for what it is, but its not for me

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (3): I took Spanish for half a fucking year and even I can tell you that that is not a correct sentence. On top of GFRIEND’s escurating painful “woooooo cutesy” concept and their formula where every song sounded the same up until about Fingertip, and my experience with Glass Bead (their debut song) which I hated. I never had a chance for liking this song and I still fucking don’t. All in all, it comes down to me hating super cutesy songs and the fact they literally barely switched it up upon the first few songs. By the year end shows that year I was fucking OVER it. (But hey at least there’s that nice guitar part in the bridge)

**selegend** (8): Recycling of songs [is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egqDPipqIAg) [nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnXXfYA91Y8) [new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twice_discography) in K-pop, but I understand the criticisms of such a practice. To me, however, BAAM feels like BBoom improved in every aspect - monstrous EDM production, stronger vocals, not blatantly ripping off other artists' songs... but it admittedly lacks the iconicness that BBoom bears. But where does BBoom BBoom land? You'll have to *wait and see*.

**raicicle** (6): bboom bboom is a classic but bboom bboom with more electroswing and the this is america flow is not

---
**1998tweety** (10): An attempt to recreate the success of BB (heck even the titles are similar, song structure especially the rap verse, etc.), BAAM missed the mark for many fans. Personally I love Baam even though it feels like BB 2.0. A bop is still a bop.

**\_xSyracuse** (10): i actually prefer this to Bboom Bboom so fight me, but its a hot bop + even more catchy than the preceding single. Now girlies lets try something more original and snatch my 11 next time

**Akastavo** (10): i just love the chorus and build up to it

**Hyperion2589** (10): BBoom BBoom 2.0 but even more catchy.

**Kromorei** (10): More amazing meme bop but both are 10s. I think I have like 200 plays of this i-

**maybe9** (10): turning a video game production into a bop, i stan

**MrSwearword** (10): very nicely done

**Qwilphish** (9.5): Just as good as Bboom bboom

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Look all I’m saying is that if Katy Perry released this music video, we would yell at her. Not a great use of your “BBoom BBoom” money. Also the song is slightly annoying to listen to because it’s so similar to “BBoom BBoom” that I keep mentally expecting the song to go like “BBoom BBoom” but then it proceeds with just enough minor differences to drive me up the wall. I think I like the chorus and beat of “BAAM” better and it has a better rap verse, but don’t quote me on either of those because I’ll probably change my mind. I’ll be gagged if this this places higher than “BBoom BBoom” though. [Also please play this during the rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFviEOIlae4&frags=pl%2Cwn)

**lexarqade** (9): Still a good song! Just not as good as BBoom BBoom.

**Neferpitta** (9): Different enough from Bboom Bboom for me to still enjoy it but admittedly a worse clone of their previous hit. I do possibly prefer the chorus on Baam though.

**wugggs** (9): Great song with an actual marked improvement from Bboom Bboom while still maintaining the infectious sound we fell in love with

**bluepupz** (8.5): Very similar to their other song but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The rapping feels a little bit less out of place than it did in BBoom BBoom

**jonnyd86** (8.5): Bboom Bboom part two but somehow even more refined and somehow has even more hooks (the song is literally a series of hooks) than Bboom Bboom.. i think the chorus is catchier (or is it pre-pre-pre chorus? whatever, Nancy and JooE's part) the drop is good too but i prefer BB's.

**Nixon4Prez** (8.5): Basically just Bboom Bboom but tweaked a bit. But I honestly prefer it.

**arrivederci1** (8): and this was just a lazy continuation of bboom bboom

**Banananaise** (8): it might be a blatant copy paste of bboom bboom but it's a good copy paste!

**Johnnytoby** (8): hmm ot actually boos and not a total carbon copy

**Luxaria** (8): Momoland gunning for France's vote in Eurovision. They even have the pandering stereotypes down.

**nihilistickitten** (8): guilty pleasure

**tapdancingpig** (8): This sounds like fun pitbull.

**dynamicity** (7.5): Following the same formula means it's still a winning song, but it lacks the spontaneous charm of Bboom Bboom, especially with the rap break.

**edmiliballs** (7): the most blatant ripoff but whatever it's still cute

**RReg29** (7): fun but not quite on Bbbom Bboom’s level

**You\_Will\_Die** (7): Overall I like them. Irritated on the loud highhat? Not sure what instrument in BBoom BBoom that goes in the background. It's way too loud and gives me a headache, otherwise the song would be 8+.

**franch** (6.8): is this endearing and cute or just sort of annoying

**AroMorbid** (6.5): Docked points for being a carbon copy of BB, but I still enjoy it

**cyborglilith** (6.5): Another meaningless dance song with a garbage rap. So innovative!

**minsiii** (6): not quite lightning in a bottle twice

**skargardin** (6): didn’t i just listen to bboom bboom? :thinking:

**c0ns3rvative** (5.5): Less percussive and compelling Bboom Bboom derailed by a slightly less awful rap, everyone go listen to the rap removed version

**amandapearl2** (5): The lesser bboom bboom.

**grenjarl** (5): catchy but not really a good song

**GroceryStore** (5): BBoom BBoom rehash

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Uh, what is this? After BBoom BBoom, I was expecting something super catchy all over again, and...uh...I can see why they only have two songs in this rate now. After multiple listens, I still can't remember much from BAAM. By far and away, it's the most generic K-Pop song from a girl group I've listened to.

**popularsong** (5): more of the same even if it doesnt sound the exact same like ppl say it does idc much abt it

**tinnnn\_lv** (5): an okay pop song but sounds similar to the previous one?

**Chubiski** (4): a disappointing rehash of Bboom Bboom

**gowestyoungkanye** (4): this is good but it’s just a rehashing of bboom bboom which everyone will comment but it is true and the mv being awful is like, you know, bad

**kappyko** (4): it's not as similar to bboom bboom as ppl would have u believe but the same tempo and constant throb of ejhhhhhhchhhh it's a little too sickening and not the right kind. the fucking rap verse is in the same place too ugh i just hope they have more tricks up their collective sleeve in the future this is bad lol

**WeirdSignal** (4): bboom bboom: zero sugar

**bespectacled** (3): A sloppy, grating, note-by-note copy of Bboom Bboom with a problematic music video? No please.

**heeyeon** (3): @shinsadong tiger you had ONE job, again the chorus is great but the fact that this song is basically bboom bboom 2.0 ruined it for me

**chainedapart** (2): They just altered BBoom BBoom chord progression in a few places. A rookie group doing the same style of song is normal, but to tweak one song slightly to make a new one is a bit lazy. Try dancing BBoom's choreo to BAAM's music (or vice versa) and it will almost exactly merge. (At least it's way better than BBoom).

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (1): Todd in the Shadows “THE FAILED FOLLOW UP” screen appears Like many more before and after then, MOMOLAND tried to find success in a song that sounded like their last one. But this one… it’s just not as good as BBoom BBoom. Also, there’s the fact it came a little too late. Okay so BBoom 2x was like first few days of January… This one was almost July… yeah by then BBoom BBoom was pretty far beyond old news, the kpop world had focused upon other groups. They stood no chance. But they also just couldn’t find the magic that BBoom 2x had. They tried to recreate the magic (they literally even released some of the moves from the BBoom 2x choreo but nope) but it just wasn’t happening. Sorry girls.

**modotrising** (0): It sounds similar to bboom bboom and it's not even better than the former. It feels like they're trying to make a second bboom bboom which I understand but due to that this song lacks any soul.

**ttandrew** (0): mess

**selegend** (6): Kinda forgettable in Twice's catalog, but also super super naughty.

---
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): God this song makes me want someone to break down my door and murder me. The thrumming beat of this song is absolutely thrilling and the girls sing with such bright voices over it it’s absolutely wonderful. TWICE are the queens of bubblegum rap, the rap parts of this song are so sweet. I don’t know who their rappers are but they’re often the highlight of the songs for me.

**Hyperion2589** (10): Love the upbeat tempo, real cute and fun.

**MrSwearword** (10): I'll be nice to them and guess this is their good song because the pace and delivery make sense for the song's production.

**SirFluffyButt13** (10): LOVE IT!!!!!!!! An earworm that just stays in your head.

**Qustomar** (9.5): i rlly love this song, it's so sweet and nice, but that feeling is mixed in with strange nostalgia and sadness that i can't describe. the song is cute and the most bubblegum pop Twice single, yet has that tinge of longing for something more, or for escapism or something, im unsure

**AroMorbid** (9): What a fun tune! I think this was my first time listening to it. It's been on heavy rotation since and I can't help, but sing "Knock Knock, Knock, Knock, Knock on my door!"

**heeyeon** (9): one of their best titles actually fight me

**Johnnytoby** (9): cute af

**Kromorei** (9): I'm no longer tired. It's like they suddenly learned how to make good music.

**letsallpoo** (9): this song is absolutely FILTHY

**RReg29** (9): now this on the other hand I can get behind!

**1998tweety** (8.8): I'm gonna get some flack for this, but KK hasn't captured me the same way other Twice tracks have. I know its a fan favourite but I just prefer other songs, sorry!

**Neferpitta** (8.5): This is pop perfection (as most of Twice's singles are) but it isn't dynamic enough for me to really love it. It still ends up in my head about once a month though.

**arrivederci1** (8.3): i hate the chorus but everything else is great

**Akastavo** (8): catchy and infectious

**dynamicity** (8): What it lacks in substance, it makes up for with a delightfully warm and comforting chord progression and melody.

**GroceryStore** (8): Solid song

**jonnyd86** (8): my favorite part of the song is the underlying rhythm.. it really propels it and keeps the energy up. it has a great hook too.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Knock Knock is probably TWICE's only song in this rate to come close to matching the quality of their first two songs; it's not great, but even if it does get a little too repetitive at times, the 'Knock knock knock knock knock on my door' hook is very, very fun and well produced, although confusing for people who want to type rate comments and count how many 'Knocks' they are. All things considered, I probably genuinely enjoy this song, unlike with TT and Signal.

**amandapearl2** (7): This song is cute, bright and fun, but not quite as memorable as their other titles.

**Banananaise** (7): this reminds me SO much of Kelly Clarkson-era 2000s pop-rock

**Qwilphish** (7): very forgettable

**wugggs** (6.5): Uninspired but still a bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): this doesnt really knock

**popularsong** (6): cute and upbeat but not much else going for it

**gowestyoungkanye** (5): so yall know how tzuyu’s name is actually pronounced chewy? we call my cat crunchie twozuyou aka the anglophone phonetic pronunciation of tzuyu for some reason. don’t know why.

**lilguavachan** (5): girl all of twice's songs sound like the start of disney channel shows that get cancelled in a year... idk...

**satanicyoona** (5): second best title track keep reading for 1st

**kappyko** (4): this is the music i expected to hear when listening to gfriend

**tinnnn\_lv** (4): this one falls even flatter

**bespectacled** (3): This is the poster song for everything I don't like about twice's brand. This song is so so so so corny

**maybe9** (3): its bubble pop done wrong

**minsiii** (3): a very forgettable song

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (3): Anddddddddddd back into cutesy hellscape we go. Satan, if you’re reading this, I know my hell if going to be a cute kpop song on repeat for eternity at this point, just make it at least a good one. I mean this is alright compared to some of the other TWICE songs but still not one I would ever actively listen to or uhhh even play in the background. Does that mean I fully hate it? Nah. It’s acceptable but just not for me at all. If you like it, good for ya.

**selegend** (0): This was the point at which I started to get bored of their formula.

---
**bespectacled** (10): I am not a fan of Twice's unrelenting (but effective and lucrative) brand of saccharine, childish hits, but this kinda turned the tide for me. This hit just oozes happiness. The pure celebration of love and infatuation in this song gave me so much love these girls.

**cyborglilith** (10): I used to hate this, but now it's an essential Christmas song.

**kappyko** (10): yea yea or no no what is it twice

**MissyBee37** (10): This song is so freaking wholesome & adorable. Warm & fuzzy goodness.

**popularsong** (10): im super excited for yes or yes bc apparently it has the same producer! love is timing

**Kromorei** (9): TWICE hit a stride. What a fun, catchy song.

**minsiii** (9): similar to Likey, something is very subtle with it that turns it from good to great

**RReg29** (9): fantastic…more like this and Knock Knock, please.

**1998tweety** (8.7): This is still good but it isn't as impressive as Likey which came right before.

**jonnyd86** (8.7): hook is infectious, love Nayeon's nasally tone, the half step prechorus is genius as well.

**maybe9** (8.5): category is denim

**amandapearl2** (8.4): Fun! Everything about Twice is so fun and bright. The ½ time pre-chorus is so good. I love the point choreography and the simple styling with jeans and white tees is perfect.

**Akastavo** (8): is sana gay

**Hyperion2589** (8): Needed some more bass to fit into the theme of the song.

**Luxaria** (8): I literally cannot stop myself dancing to this one.

**MrSwearword** (8): being nice again and commending them for selling...lovestruckness I suppose

**Qwilphish** (8): Is Sana Gay?

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Well, I don't think Heart Shaker really stands out amongst many songs in this rate that are of a higher quality (I'd call that the problem with TWICE, actually - I fail to see anything special about their music or group dynamic) but it is an enjoyable enough fluff track with a stellar hook. I like TWICE's synthpop influence well enough, although I'd like to see it actually go somewhere...

**three-stacks** (7.5): AKA TWICE's heat check.

**arrivederci1** (7.4): good but boring

**\_xSyracuse** (7): iissssss sana gay? yes or yes

**dynamicity** (7): What Is Love? beta version. The prechorus is great and the chorus is nice until the very end. The verses feel very bland though.

**Neferpitta** (7): It's a cute bop.

**Banananaise** (6.5): the random drum solo at 1:12 lmao

**Johnnytoby** (6): I'm not here for this

**Qustomar** (6): bland

**tinnnn\_lv** (5): not a fan of the cheesy and nasally ‘yeas’ but the dance was cool!!

**gowestyoungkanye** (4): i don’t know the name of the member who grabs tzuyu’s waist cause i only know the ones that were in the gashina video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNMjrbz89Hc, sorry, but that was certainly something i didn’t expect

**nihilistickitten** (3): a lot at once

**satanicyoona** (3): copy&paste jyp is at it again, pretty catchy though

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): I generally either really love a TWICE song or find it insufferable. This is my chief example of the latter. This song is just annoying. It’s overly cutesy even for TWICE. They usually have some kind of twist to their songs to make them more interesting, or sell the song through sheer charm and earnestness, but the weird ‘50s throwback sound doesn’t suit them at all so there’s not much they can do with it. It’s just kind of… a bad song, and the video/dance aren’t even that good to compensate. I’d like to point out that there’s a separate group called HIGHTEEN who released a song called [“Love Is Timing”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG8TAF211jI&frags=pl%2Cwn) (one of the lyrics from this song) earlier this year and it’s way better on every level with 1/100th the budget.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (1): Oh look they switched it up a bit for once holy shit. (Okay barely, they just made it retro, but with twice sometimes you gotta celebrate the bare minimum.) But that still doesn’t mean it’s good. Cause guess what. This is not good. I shit you guys not, I literally only remember one thing about this song. When it was released, in the comments on the Asian junkie article about it someone pointed out it sounds like they say, “IS SANA GAY?” and I got a kick out of that and it has just stuck since.

**wugggs** (0): Low effort, generic, an extreme disappointment coming from a group with the potential to release songs like Likey and TT

**bespectacled** (9): MAMAMOO in drag? Yes please

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Title of the song represents my reaction to hearing it. I had heard that “Piano Man” was their best song so when this started and I heard that funky bassline and those synths starting hitting and I started bopping I was like “UM oh AH YeH.”

**Hyperion2589** (9): Slightly abrupt ending to the song, otherwise a great track.

**lilguavachan** (9): synthpop queens

**Qwilphish** (9): top 10 transformations goes to Wheein

**three-stacks** (9): Peak Mamamoo - incredibly charming, and almost conversational in tone - members jumping in and out of each other's parts or harmonising in the background, the call and response phrases, and the ad-lib bridge, just great stuff.

**1998tweety** (8.7): This is cute. It doesn't do as much for me as some of their other songs but its by no means bad.

**arrivederci1** (8.5): i bopped to this so much when it first came out

**GroceryStore** (8.5): Banger

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): It's not quite as spectacular as Piano Man, but Um Oh Ah Yeh is definitely making me improve my opinions of MAMAMOO further; the song combines different elements very well, merging the cute production with energetic and entertaining performances from the different members in the group (I really like it when one of the girls almost says 'holy shit!'). This is just great pop.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Cute. I boosted it a point for the bridge.

**dynamicity** (8): Pure pop perfection, this song combines a compellingly simple chorus with Mamamoo's trademark funk and incredible vocals.

**jonnyd86** (8): love the hook and the harmonies in the second half of the song.

**kappyko** (8): Uh, er, it's... eh... (actually it's pretty good)

**lexarqade** (8): Such a feel-good song. One of my faves of theirs.

**Luxaria** (8): I like this one, the concept of the MV is weirder than a lot of the ones I've seen.

**maybe9** (8): ah yesss

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I like the chorus (also this is definitely lesbian)

**bluepupz** (7.5): Power vocals as usual! It's a fun song (I can't help but visualize their MV for this which was a lot lol)

**gowestyoungkanye** (7): literally all i could think about is that solar is wearing a replica of an outfit cara delevigne wore in the victoria’s secret fashion show (https://media.harpersbazaar.com.sg/2016/12/This-Is-Why-Cara-Delevingne-Turned-Down-That-Victorias-Secret-Fashion-Show-Invite-1.jpg) and that’s definitely wild

**Kromorei** (7): It's kinda meh but it's still good.

**nihilistickitten** (7): dig it

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): Oh hey I remember this comeback. I believe this was uhhhh my 2nd comeback with MAMAMOO. My first iirc was Ahh Oop!. Anyways this song is great. All of the girls get a chance to shine and it’s fucking catchy. The breakdown in the bridge is also amazing. Mostly because it’s so simplistic but yet fucking groovy. Anyways, I’m not talking much about the song itself here because I want to talk about the video. Aka amazing cross dressing the video. Seriously, I think I lost my shit laughing the first time I watched, it was so wild. And all of the girls were having a fun time with this.

**Meepmeepmusik** (6): Probably their worst title track :'(

**minsiii** (6): would prefer stronger verses

**Neferpitta** (6): It's a cute bop I guess. Wheein as a man turned me straight. Then Moonbyul turned me gay again.

**RReg29** (6): decent

**wugggs** (6): more generic that their previous sound but still solid vocal delivery

**tinnnn\_lv** (5): once again not my style but vocals to die for!!

**satanicyoona** (4): overall cute? but falls just a bit flat

**ttandrew** (4): cute

**cyborglilith** (2): I absolutely loathe song titles like these.

**selegend** (8): [Blackpink - Boombayah (2016)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RVXOHimQRA)

**raicicle** (7): the classic YG ‘edm rave anthem’ formula right down to the shouty coda, it’s not the best version of the formula (that goes to Bang Bang Bang) but you totally get why YG made blackpink debut with this

---
**0ut0fthew00ds** (10): incredibly listenable that distills Blackpink’s Song

**c0ns3rvative** (10): An iconic debut driven by booming percussion and melodic synths. The instrumental could have easily been veered into grating-and-overdone territory but everything sits nicely in the mix and the gradual vocal layering on the choruses adds some much-needed meat and texture

**franch** (10): my ideal k-pop song is a bop with occasional english words and singing the name of the band, so this is pretty much it for me.

**Hyperion2589** (10): Still my favourite BP song to date, and the best YG signature hype ending. Should have been the debut song.

**MissyBee37** (10): This song is everything I want in a pop song; it's fun, catchy and full of style. I love that this was their debut because it's an excellent way to introduce a group with an instant sense of the collective personality. I absolutely love Lisa's rap; "Middle finger up, F u, pay me," is straight badass.

**original\_doll** (10): still their best song!

**PostDebut** (10): I'm still shook this was their fucking DEBUT (best BP song don't @ me)

**onceberry** (9.3): Can we talk about that choreo with Rose sliding under the girls mmm

**cyborglilith** (9): anthem

**jamesfog** (9): Massive banger

**lilguavachan** (9): local queens

**Mudkip1** (9): love the production but they couldve kept the english rap bit

**skargardin** (9): MEGABOP

**1998tweety** (8.6): This is a great debut song. Its catchy, expressive, and has great vocals and rap verses. The one thing I'm not a huge fan of is the weird chorus.

**AroMorbid** (8.5): This song lets up

**Johnnytoby** (8.5): Their best video tbh

**agentofscranton** (8): boombayah my lord boombayah

**Akastavo** (8): good debut banger for the girls

**bespectacled** (8): Aaaah, the iconic tagline that started everything. This is a massive debut for them, although imo it aged somewhat badly

**Luxaria** (8): This is so punchy and it's a bit different from the rest of the GGs (until (G)I-DLE comes for them obvs).

**Nixon4Prez** (8): Best debut song on this list

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I had a hard time warming up to Boombayah because the production is a little too loud for me most of the time, but BLACKPINK's dynamic and energy makes this good enough as a crowd pleaser during concerts and stadium tours. By the way, I thought it was 'BLACKPINK in your alley, yuh' the first time I listened to this.

**Qwilphish** (8): GOAT rap from Jennie

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8): Oh man I remember BLACKPINK’s debut, and I remember liking this song more than Whistle. At its core Boombayah is a loud party song and I fucking love it for that. BLACKPINK were here to announce that they were fucking in your area and they succeed with on that with this. Paired with a music video filled with bright colors that pair with the fun vibes of the song, it makes for an overall solid experience. Though I can understand if some want to pan this song for being too loud, it’s quite repetitive and doesn’t have much substance, but it’s just a fun song, let it be that.

**tapdancingpig** (8): Ok, but who gave these girls to become the female Pitbulls?

**arrivederci1** (7.8): great debut for establishing their signature sound and overall concept

**bluepupz** (7.8): It's upbeat and energetic, which is fun

**jonnyd86** (7.7): the drop is great and the final third of the song is ecstacy

**dynamicity** (7.5): Origin of the fabled "Blackpink in your area," this frenetic dance number blends EDM with rap and an arabian sound to create a compelling club banger. At times though it can feel a bit too loud and repetitive.

**Kromorei** (7.5): To be honest even as a BLINK I never got into this song.

**Neferpitta** (7.5): Rose sliding through their legs is the most iconic thing she's ever done. It may also be the only iconic thing she's ever done.

**Qustomar** (7.5): it's a fun song, i like it a lot, but can i necessarily say Boombayah is anything better in terms of quality than average? not at all. and that's how i feel about most Blackpink songs, yes it's fine and good, but is it great? no

**amandapearl2** (7.1): Fun and energetic debut with a bad ass edge that had been missing from kpop girl group debuts. It’s not fully to my taste, it comes across a bit try hard and a bit cringe (please no OPPA!), but their sincere performance sells it.

**chainedapart** (7): Took a while for me to like this song

**kappyko** (7): If you Remember GoonRock You're entitled to a veterinarian's discount

**maybe9** (7): go off drop

**minsiii** (7): those adlibs doe

**vodkainsipido** (7): is this hip-hop

**wugggs** (7): I think Boombayah is emblematic of Blackpink's sound, but not the best they can do.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): YAH YAH YAH YAH YAH

**MrSwearword** (6): the dated as fuck production of 2012 club/dance on the chorus really holds it back from really popping off like it wants to.

**gowestyoungkanye** (4.4): listen. i fucking love blackpink. and probably this is a sacrilegious score (wait till you see what i give as if it’s your last lol) but holy shit, this song is annoying ashell. i love the music video’s neon dream colouring, but this is a dated edm song — DO i even have to say anything about ‘oppa!’???? i will sa lisa’s verse is absolutely legend (and bangs in the japanese version too) and ‘blackpink in your area’ whew, but other than that this song has like, 0 redeeming qualities also the choreo is stupid. on to the GOOD blackpink songs.

**Chubiski** (4): the prechorus is the only redeeming part of this song… can’t deal with the war cries and “oppa!” at all

**popularsong** (4): the oppas still bother me, teddy's production is as tired as ever

**tinnnn\_lv** (4): pretty basic, didn’t like the repetitive chorus

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Personally I feel like this song is just kind of… noise? I feel that way about most of BLACKPINK's songs but this one is the biggest offender… and it was also their breakthrough hit? I’m not sure what it was about this song that grabbed people. There are some fun lines (“click-clack, badda bing badda boom”) but it’s not my favorite.

**heeyeon** (3): this would've been a 1 if it wasn't for 'oppa!'

**nihilistickitten** (3): their worst track

**RReg29** (3): 2ne1 but, like, not as good

**BiPolarBear17** (2): Like all debuts, Boombayah served as an accurate representation of everything BLACKPINK was to become. In this case that being a bunch of 'pretty' girls playing dress-up in the wardrobe of their far-cooler big sister. The big sister in question shouldn’t even need naming, but I do wish that 2NE1’s legacy had amounted to more than just their scrapped old demos, originally left lying on the cutting room floor, being given to YG's cheap attempt at recreating the group. It should go without saying that this song is rancid; it's irritating for the sheer sake of it as an attempt to make itself into a kind of statement piece as much as a song. But the problem is, a statement piece - one that's a musical debut, no less - needs to be original, and needs to show off the talent of the group's members, and on both accounts Boombayah is a relentless failure.

**PuggleMaster** (2): This isn't good at all.........

**selegend** (8): It's a blatant rip-off of Robin Schulz's "Prayer in C" remix, but the girls' vocals are gorgeous. I *love* Wheein's delivery in this, especially in the chorus. And I love that Moonbyul finally got to sing!

---
**chainedapart** (10): Egotistic would also gain a 10, but I'll settle for Starry Night.

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): remember when mamamoo dropped this and i died instantly even though it sounds like that song waves by like lily wood and the prick or whatever her name was (ps, the follow up egotistic is their best song)

**Kromorei** (10): Probably the song I like the second most in their discography (rip egotistic).

**Luxaria** (10): Ooooohhh this low key production, I'm living. Clearly need to keep an ear out for their next songs.

**maybe9** (10): its a relaxed sexy mood, they took me there sis

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): very Light Years-era Kylie

**1998tweety** (9.5): At first I thought this was kind of trend chasing (which admittedly it is), but its actually pretty good. The progression from soft vocals at the beginning to belts right before the drop and paced super well. Moonbyul's raps, as always, are done well too. The guitar gives the track a bit of a latin vibe, but doesn't crowd out the song.

**Hyperion2589** (9.5): Love ambient sounding concept. Dare I say one of the most beautifully shot music videos.

**jonnyd86** (9.5): love the spanish guitars and the sultry verses. the hook and drop are great, i love the reverb on the yah yah yah's.. it really develops the atmosphere of the song.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9.5): HEY KIDS HEY KIDS, YOU LOVE PRAYER IN C? TELL ME! YEAH YEAH! ALRIGHT FOLLOW ME! I’m sorry every time I hear this song I fucking think of Prayer in C. It’s definitely better than I remember it being tho, I can say that. (Even if it almost Prayer in C) Anyways thanks for serving like always VOCALSMOO. Sorry, I slept on this and Yes I Am. (Also, can we talk for a second about how like pretty this video is, cause those beach shots are fucking amazing)

**wugggs** (9.3): Seriously an amazing new direction for them but not quite as good as You're The Best IMO

**dynamicity** (9): This song is just breathtakingly pretty. The vocal harmonies at the end of the prechorus and Moonbyul's verses give me chills.

**bespectacled** (8.5): Their first real chart hit, can't believe it took that long

**bluepupz** (8.5): This is different from their other songs but not in a bad way - I like how dreamy and atmospheric it feels at times. Also, the guitar loop is lovely

**original\_doll** (8.5): I like this song a lot, but I can't really unhear the similarity to prayer in c :/

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Oh, wow, is this the type of ballad that's slapped over electronic production just to make it sound a little bit boppy? Because Ienjoy that archetype if it's done right, and Starry Night is definitely a prime example of such an idea being executed well. It's a track that legitimately sounds like a starry, nostalgic sky.

**amandapearl2** (8.1): I like the sexy vibes in this song, it’s well balanced, not too try hard to be sexy (like another one of their releases). The choreography is really nice and the music video is stunning.

**Akastavo** (8): reminds me a lot of pop music here in the states

**AroMorbid** (8): Unfortunately, I didn't like Mamamoo's songs as much as I would have liked :( maybe some more listens will help, but Starry Night is a fun song

**c0ns3rvative** (8): Easily my favorite MMM single, this airy and ethereal vibe is a great change of pace compared to pretty much all their other productions and the vocals are characteristically fantastic

**MrSwearword** (8): again, different for them and not bad but yeeps does it fall short among greatness

**nihilistickitten** (8): pretty AF

**tinnnn\_lv** (8): the vocals aren’t so strong but i loved the change in concept and the song was really good!

**Nixon4Prez** (7.5): It’s good but it’s uncomfortably similar to ‘Prayer in C’

**Qwilphish** (7.5): The visuals are god tier but the song is missing something

**arrivederci1** (7.3): feels like im the only one who doesn't really like this

**lexarqade** (7): Prayer in C, anyone?

**musicalpets** (7): where the hell is egotistic i love me my fake latin pop!!! and taller than u!!! want my pseuddo hip hop

**PostDebut** (7): This is probably their most generic song out of the lot but overall Mamamoo have impressed me, this is still very solid.

**jamesfog** (6): This sounds like Prayer in C but not as good

**mssone1993** (6): where the fuck is egoistic??

**RReg29** (5): kinda boring

**edmiliballs** (4): i'm mad that this is one of their biggest hits because it's so disappointingly boring

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I’m not really understanding this track. Maybe it’s just my tepidness towards tropical songs in general but I’m not sure what exactly this track is meant to be? It sits at this weird mid-tempo that isn’t really either laid back or energetic, this is far too middle of the road to be anything interesting. It’s more boring than bad though, just too safe of a track.

**kappyko** (4): Milky Chance did it and we shrugged, Mamamoo did it and we kinda just tilted our heads in confusion

**letsallpoo** (4): ended robin schulz

**Neferpitta** (4): Last Dance/Prayer in C but everything is worse.

**Johnnytoby** (3): :[

**satanicyoona** (2.5): edm not for them

**onceberry** (1): That yayaya at the chorus gets them one (1) point

**ttandrew** (1): yawn

**heeyeon** (0): im sorry i just really hated this sound for them :(

**selegend** (6): [Blackpink - DDU-DU DDU-DU (2018)](http://www.tmz.com/2018/06/18/xxxtentacion-shot-dead-miami/) The song's rather noisy, but Jennie's rap was a huge highlight of 2018.

---
**franch** (11): this song basically ushered in my fandom for this generation of k-pop

**gowestyoungkanye** (11): maybe it’s ‘i waited a year for this and it was so fucking good’ bias, but i love this song. it’s exactly what blackpink is supposed to be. the go ahead and test me part? shivers.

**MissyBee37** (11): The song that made me fall in love with K-pop. It's easily my favorite song of 2018. This song is just pop perfection. The swagger, the confidence, the energy are all electric. I live for the beat! I can't even pick between Lisa & Jennie's raps because I love them both so much. The hook is undeniably catchy and just stellar. I love the chorus, love the bridge. There are no bad moments in this song. Also, it's maybe the only drop I actually like. Drops have always ruined songs for me before this one; but the lyrics are true -- this one bangs.

---
**0ut0fthew00ds** (10): one of the best k Pop songs of the year. The hook is perfect and gets stuck in your head forever. Also I heard this at a wedding and people went nuts.

**agentofscranton** (10): this was the song that got me into k-pop in the first place! i checked it out after watching the popheads top 40 video, heard the snippet of it and immediately went to check them out - now k-pop has taken over my life

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): wig evaporated

**gannade** (10): that drop in the last 30 seconds of this song is godlike

**impeccabletim** (10): Would have been an 11 if YG didn’t take so fucking long with their comeback smh.

**jamesfog** (10): So badass

**Johnnytoby** (10): Lisa deserves more lines

**tapdancingpig** (10): This song is like “Ready For It” if “Ready For It” was Korean and good.

**vodkainsipido** (10): the chorus has become an intrusive though since i discovered this song in late august, absolute masterpiece

**40073521** (9): Great song that filled the drought.

**bespectacled** (9): It's kinda boosted by the hype more than the quality, but it's still a well-produced earworm

**Hyperion2589** (9): Slightly boring chorus but a killer bridge. Point deducted for not having "Blackpink in your area".

**Kromorei** (9): I'm actually not too huge on the Jennie rap-breaks but this song still slaps.

**lexarqade** (9): After waiting so long I was kinda disappointed with this release but it is still a certified banger

**Neferpitta** (9): Jennie please step on me.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This song got dragged a bit too much, sure it doesn't live up to their previous songs, especially AIIYF, but its still a solid track. The rap bits in particular stand out. The video is so so good too.

**arrivederci1** (8.5): would have given it just an 8 but jennie's rap made me add on that .5

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8.5): A top 25 K-Pop song of the year for me. Of course, this is another fun party BP song. Hilariously I think I stayed up for this one, not sure if that was accidental or purpose tho. (Here’s where I note I usually pull all-nighters for releases I really give fucks about) And Jennie was right, “When the bass drop it’s another banger” This song fucking bangs. What really propels this song is the simplistic chorus with the drop. I’m sure there are some that are over it, but it works with this song so well. Also, the fucking breakdown at the end sends me every time, especially because the bass just really fucking starts booming. Also it has a fun little “point” dance for the chorus that makes it memorable.

**skargardin** (8.5): The catchiest track of 2018 without a doubt! I swear it always pops into my head at all times.

**AroMorbid** (8): Great great rap verses!

**dynamicity** (8): If there was ever a song that embodied "swag," this would probably be it. However, the meandering, melodramatic prechorus really drags down the momentum of the song.

**jonnyd86** (8): at first the song structure really threw me off, but i came around. the hook is top tier and Jennie's 2nd verse is one of the best girl group rap verses of recent memory. the drop at the end is classic Teddy, i'm not positive he knows another way to end a song, but it doesn't matter because it's so good.

**Luxaria** (8): Love two faced queens who brag about it. I need a club to play this, the dance break would kill me but it's what I deserve.

**maybe9** (8): a staple bop

**PuggleMaster** (8): Nibaqi airport lady likes this song so i like it too

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): what’s with this group and onomatopoeia

**kappyko** (7.5): minus a few points for the title not matching the amount of ddus in the title but i really like this and its everything i want from them. EDM drop is cool, rapping sounds rad with the polished production and everything falls right into place

**\_xSyracuse** (7): six of these points are earned from the rapping from Jennie and Lisa

**edmiliballs** (7): i'm very whelmed

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Gun violence anthem! Queens of having more money than us and therefore it being okay for them to shoot people, classist icons. I Love Noise.

**GroceryStore** (7): Pretty disappointing tbh, fire raps tho

**MrSwearword** (7): I don't like the Skrillex or some kind of just as dated production choice yet again but the building blocks are there

**nihilistickitten** (7): solid track

**Nixon4Prez** (7): Good, but starting to feel a little repetitive

**ttandrew** (7): bop

**wugggs** (7): Good, but lacking in a way that I struggle to verbalize. I want them to really rock the boat with their next single as Dx4 felt like more of the same (maybe a little stale).

**modotrising** (6.5): I think I like this song a bit more every time I listen to it. The melodic sections are rather pretty.

**Qustomar** (6.5): i can't lie and say i did not think DDU-DU DDU-DU DU was a hardcore bop when it came out, but listening to it months after, it really did not hold up that well. this song was my first introduction to the group, and one of my first ever songs at the beginning of my kpop stan journery, so i immeadiately became a stan of blackpink and thought this song was the peak of kpop or whatever. however, today the song just feels so much more basic, and when i listen to it, i just think about how much better things would be i were listening to "I Am the Best"

**bluepupz** (6.3): This has good elements to it, but I hate the last 30 seconds of the song...

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Sorry, twinks; I kept on hearing DDD-DU literally every time I went to gym last semester, and I almost failed my Physical Education class, so, yeah, bad memories taint my perception of it. (Before you freak out, I live in Asia). I actually do appreciate how lively the song is during some brief moments of it, though, s after due consideration, I will no longer roast it like I planned to.

**PostDebut** (6): If "Bitch, I'm a star, but not Patrick" and "Got more juice than Hi-C" were on the Korean version I would have given this an 11.

**Qwilphish** (6): Its fine, when i hit you with that is the only redeeming part

**amandapearl2** (5.1): Super catchy despite all of it’s problem areas. The instrumentals are way too harsh for me to really enjoy, and the choreography is quite bland.

**c0ns3rvative** (5): Very disappointing, nearly everything about this feels like an overly familiar and sterile rehash of previous BP tracks. The chorus drop has big kick hits but otherwise underwhelms with a sparse instrumental and clean-cut single vocal lines. The reverb on all the sung vocals gets old fast and much like the rest of the EP this track overall sounds far too loud and compressed

**grenjarl** (5): A shame Forever Young wasn't here as I believe it is a much better song

**heeyeon** (5): when will real choruses return from war

**minsiii** (5): prechorus and chorus Zzzz

**popularsong** (4): teddy im begging. the lyrics r annoying too and its so disjointed. jennies rap verse was kinda cool i guess

**letsallpoo** (3): this aged like ddu-du

**lilguavachan** (2.5): i feel like they have it in them to switch it up, but YG really wants them to sit there and release 2NE1 b-sides... a tragedy

**RReg29** (2): more like doo doo doo doo, amirite…too YOLO for its own good imo

**tinnnn\_lv** (1): honestly generic and just lackluster. the beginning seemed to have so much hype but it didn’t follow through

**BearsNguyen** (0): really liked it at first, but it got stale quick for me.

**original\_doll** (0): I've always thought this song was poorly mixed, and the chorus is kinda cacophonous and unpleasant?? like it literally gives me a headache to listen to
