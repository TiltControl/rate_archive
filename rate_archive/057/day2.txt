**selegend** (6): Why isn't Go Won on the XXL Freshman Class of 2018

---
**letsallpoo** (10): highkey the best loona song from this year

**maybe9** (10): she eats a pineapple and turns blonde, i stan

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The video for this is kind of the highlight here but outside of that this is just a slick song. I read that a lot of people kind of ranked it lower when it came out and were like “oh no LOONA finally released a generic song” but I personally find this song super interesting. It’s a bit thinner than some of the other tracks but it makes up for it in mood.

**lexarqade** (9): The instrumental for this is off the hook and I love it

**amandapearl2** (8.8): This one took me a minute to warm up to, but now I love it. It’s a lot softer than some of the other solos, but it has a unique style that is really cool. Plus this music video is so visually stunning.

**GroceryStore** (8.7): Grew on me a lot

**AroMorbid** (8.5): Soooo addicting and catchy

**1998tweety** (8.4): Its really hard to follow up Heart Attack and this song did not do a good job of that.

**Hyperion2589** (8): Lacking in some tonal variation but great in pacing.

**minsiii** (8): Very jpoppy

**nihilistickitten** (8): unique vocals really catch you right away

**jonnyd86** (7.8): i really like her vocal color, its really soft and cutesy but not overly sugary. i think the hook is really catchy

**Banananaise** (7.5): the speak-singy bits are cute ok

**kappyko** (7.5): clapped a little

**arrivederci1** (7.4): it's such an interesting song honestly but not my cup of tea

**modotrising** (6.5): This song is so odd... but it works

**musicalpets** (6): i like her voice but until she releases an RnB song i wont be pleased

**RReg29** (6): song isn’t totally there but another great looking vid

**wugggs** (3): Gowon sweetie I love you but whew this song is a chore to get through (the talk-vocals made me dizzy honestly)

**dynamicity** (1): Bleh. This song is getting a One and Only one.

**selegend** (10): It's interesting how different LOONA has become since 1/3. This is so unlike anything else in K-pop, remarkably so.

---
**lexarqade** (10): I remember when loona started and I was like "Damn this song and video is great! They'll never be able to keep up with this level of quality" and guess what Mimi? They did. Still one of my favourite Loona releases.

**musicalpets** (10): she really is the epitome of kpop

**1998tweety** (9.2): I love how jazzy this sounds.

**amandapearl2** (9.1): OH MY GOD YES! I love this song so much, the vocals are so fun and expressive, it reminds me of musical theater. I love that this is so different from a lot of kpop girl group songs, it’s unique and interesting.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I was kind of tepid on this solo for a while but as time has gone on I’ve warmed to its charms. HeeJin’s lilting performance really sells the piece and the background vocals are also super fun.

**GroceryStore** (9): The start of something special

**Luxaria** (9): Oh my god yes, if this was the first one released no wonder everyone was hyped. Jazzy, sounds vaguely French.

**minsiii** (9): OH MY GOD YESSS

**Neferpitta** (9): queen of france

**wugggs** (9): OH MY GOD YES

**MissyBee37** (8.5): Killer chorus!

**AroMorbid** (8): It has grown on me so much. I wouldn't actively look for it, but now I crave the "Oh my goodness."

**arrivederci1** (8): iconic and pretty solid song

**Banananaise** (8): does she say 'hey gents' at the start like some kind of classy escort

**bespectacled** (8): Didn't like it so much at first because it reminded me of IU's twentythree not in a good way, but it grew on me. Anyway, heejin is gorgeous so who cares

**Glennishill** (8): The chorus is K I L L E R but the rest of the song is just fine.

**modotrising** (8): This is the track that got me hooked into Loona so it has a special place in my heart. Heejin has such a characteristic singing style, full of charisma. Can't wait to see how she develops as a performer.

**maybe9** (7.5): bop instrumental

**jonnyd86** (7): love the sassy brass and the hook

**RReg29** (7): solid groove…I dig it

**dynamicity** (6.5): The most personality of the solos, but unfortunately the song lacks a real hook.

**Hyperion2589** (6): A great musical piece ruined by overly emphasised slurring vocals.

**nihilistickitten** (6): funky

**satanicyoona** (5): sAy Oh My gOoDnEsS!!1

**selegend** (7): A very by-the-books bop, it's also very interesting how much her singing and rapping voices contrast.

---
**bespectacled** (10): TENS TENS TENS ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ODD EYE CIRCLE (although this is the weakest solo from the trio). I was planning to give this a 9.5 but re-watching the video and seeing how gorgeous jinsoul was made me take it up a notch lol

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): i want to brag that i heard this song when it came out and got into loona before a lot of people, thanks, goodnight

**Hyperion2589** (10): Let this be a lesson in how to make percussive heavy music.

**lexarqade** (10): After Eclipse I was like "okay how could they top that" and bitch... This scalped me completely!

**lilguavachan** (10): i see what kind of serve that was, queen

**maybe9** (10): scalp me JinSoul

**AroMorbid** (9): I like to call this song a journey. Just when you think it's done, it rewards with more beats, vocals, and raps.

**GroceryStore** (9): Chorus does not get old

**1998tweety** (8.8): A bit more of am edm bop compared to their other songs. JinSoul slays her raps too.

**amandapearl2** (8.2): One of the best music videos LOONA has done, the song is really cool and has a great overall vibe. Jinsoul is absolutely captivating. However this chorus is a bit too dub-step for my taste so I can’t rate it quite as high.

**Luxaria** (8): I'm a sucker for the electronic production.

**minsiii** (8): SINGING IN TH-

**RReg29** (8): hells yes to this

**wugggs** (8): great but IMO not as good as the other OEC releases

**dynamicity** (7): The verses are a bit boring but the off-kilter tempo of the chorus is really an experience.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): My least favorite of the LOONA solos. Despite fantastic verses, the song just feels a little underwritten. The chorus just being the title and then some future bass wobbles is a copout. If you watch the full choreography on dry land it actually looks really silly too because she’s just kind of hopping around on the ground but wowza, the video is fantastic.

**jonnyd86** (6.5): i like the electro flourishes but the verses are kind of lackluster

**selegend** (5): This has an amazing amount of uniqueness and personality that is marred by that horrid drop.

---
**1998tweety** (10): Ok wow this song is that bitch. The first half of the song is magical but the switch is what sets this song as an indisputable 10. Blended 2 completely different styles perfectly is so difficult to do. The lower darker bit doesn't overstay its welcome which keeps the song moving.

**AroMorbid** (10): My favorite thing to do that involves is to watch YouTube Reactions to this song. I wish someone had video taped me. Without the different elements, this song is still amazing. It could easily be included in "Teenage Dream" for it's fun pop energy.

**bespectacled** (10): Miss chowwerry snapped on this one, and although we've rightfully left EDM beat drops on 2016, that beat drop/genre drop was KILLER

**Hyperion2589** (10): “The Drop”.

**jonnyd86** (10): the drop is so filthy, and the hook is super catchy.

**lexarqade** (10): Where were you when you heard that beat drop for the first time and how shook were you

**maybe9** (10): is that Girls Generation? that breakdown yusss

**amandapearl2** (9.8): It’s actually quite hard to pinpoint why I love this song as much as I do. Normally I would find this far too disjointed, but in this song the happy and upbeat verse and the drastic shift in the dance break works, somehow. This is also my favorite choreography for all of LOONA, there’s something about this song that just absolutely works for me.

**wugggs** (9.5): boppy as all heck and also that BREAKDOWN

**arrivederci1** (9.2): the DROP makes the whole song

**dynamicity** (9): It's a pop bop and then it's a drop bop. Spoop.

**minsiii** (9): slay slay slay

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.8): When I see people complain about the drop, I hit the gas. Seriously, this song is kind of genius partially because of how well it blends genres but also because of what a good statement it’s making about LOONA as a group. Choerry’s role in LOONA lore is to act as a bridge between the different subunits, the music video even shows her getting dragged from the world of 1/3 to the world of Odd Eye Circle. So her song starts off with the bubblegum stylings of 1/3, which then blends into the harsh electronic sounds of OEC. It’s a perfect representation of the musical evolution of LOONA, and also a full bop.

**lilguavachan** (8): it's a cute summery song

**GroceryStore** (7.5): Second best bridge

**nihilistickitten** (7): confusing

**RReg29** (7): another good one

**satanicyoona** (6.5): the second drop is the superior drop thank you

**heeyeon** (5): i still don't understand that breakdown... i just don't

**selegend** (10): The girls served GORGEOUS vocals in this. I hope we get to hear more songs like this in the future because this is truly unique ear candy.

---
**1998tweety** (10): I love Mamamoo's style so much. This jazz-ish song suites them so well. Moonbyul actually gets a respectable amount of lines in this which is great, she kills her rap verse too. Mamamoo as a group are known for their vocals as well so this type of song works really well.

**heeyeon** (10): this is mamamoo's best song i will die on this hill

**MrSwearword** (10): sorry what? I'm too busy getting my life to this.

**Mudkip1** (10): we love a high concept visual

**Qwilphish** (10): wow what a massive bop - + points for incorporating a piano into kpop

**RReg29** (10): fantastic vox with a vintage vibe

**tapdancingpig** (10): Damn, this is fucking different.

**arrivederci1** (9): look if u got piano in it then i like it. Chorus could have a little more oomf in it tho

**BiPolarBear17** (9): Jazzy excellence came through.

**Hyperion2589** (9): One of the more solid true Jazz kpop songs.

**lilguavachan** (9): jazz queens

**maybe9** (9): ok go off piano man

**Neferpitta** (9): Still Mamamoo's best single to date. They should go back to this.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): If there was ever an opening song in this rate that caught my attention immediately, Piano Man fit the bill. Almost a showtune in terms of composition, Piano Man makes use of rhythm in a way artists across the globe often forget to take note of; the group's members are campy here, but they perform every single part of Piano Man especially well, and all of those parts are sure standouts. What a bop.

**Kromorei** (8.5): Even though this isn't what I come to MAMAMOO for they still unquestionably snapped. Vocal LEGENDS.

**wugggs** (8.2): loved their earlier jazzy sound

**gowestyoungkanye** (8.1): this isn’t billy joel?

**bluepupz** (8): The jazzy swing is so fun here, and the piano frames their voices nicely

**minsiii** (8): they pull this off really well

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Weird Billy Joel cover, but ok

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I hate that kiss sound at the beginning, the sound of just a person’s lips is never appealing. Outside of that though this song is good I guess.

**amandapearl2** (7.1): I love the jazz cabaret vibe of this song, it has STYLE.

**dynamicity** (7): A textbook lesson on how to do retro sounds in the 21st century. Hwasa's sultry intro is the highlight.

**popularsong** (7): i dont listen to them anymore so no comments jus scores

**jonnyd86** (6): a great vocal performance but i dont find it that catchy

**kappyko** (6): I get it but I can't help but feel like there was much better on the soundtrack to *The Great Gatsby* (2013, dir. Luhrmann)

**Luxaria** (6): It's jazzy but forgettable.

**tinnnn\_lv** (6): not too bad but not my style

**Nixon4Prez** (5.5): A little too retro for my taste

**Chubiski** (5): this sounds like the asian songs my mom listens to

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (5): Ehhhh never really been big on this one. TBH I probably would have vouched for Ahh Oop! With Esna instead of this. But whatever. Anyways it’s funky, it’s fun. But I’m just not a big fan of it. I’m not exactly sure why but yeah that’s that. Anyways, you motherfuckers wanted a keychange?

**satanicyoona** (5): very sad their debut song isn't here but piano man makes up for it thanks

**FatbatwithaHat** (3): I liked Billy Joel's cover better

**ttandrew** (2): mess

**selegend** (9): Very plausible for GFriend's change in direction and ability to work with 80s synthpop.

---
**40073521** (10): THEIR BEST SONG

**agentofscranton** (10): I guess I'm a GFriend fan now goddamn

**Hyperion2589** (10): Continuation of Navillera. Also hands down the best music video outfit of any girl group in this era.

**lexarqade** (10): Korea let this flop and I will never forgive them

**lilguavachan** (10): they saw my last rating and said, "listen you fat homo, here's the bop you wanted," and then they flicked my vagina and whispered, "obesity" yadda yadda you know the rest

**GroceryStore** (9.5): Underrated/Best concept

**gowestyoungkanye** (9.2): THIS SOUNDS SO 80S THANK YOU GOD THANK YOU GFRIEND FINALLY

**chenle** (9): this song deserved better

**jamesfog** (9): This is great

**Kromorei** (9): Honestly their best song. It smashes and I want more of THIS sound from them.

**PostDebut** (9): Girl crush? Twice could never

**Qwilphish** (9): Tang tang tang pingertip

**RReg29** (9): oh baby that is funky af

**1998tweety** (8.9): OMG there is it!! The sound switch-up I was waiting for. The track sounds so so different from their other stuff.

**amandapearl2** (8.8): A super polarizing release for the fandom, I personally loved it. The “Tang tang tang” is such an ear worm. I think this still has that signature gfriend sound, but with just a bit of a mature edge that I love. The choreography is perfect, I love the styling, and the funky synths are awesome. It’s a yes from me dawg.

**jonnyd86** (8.5): i actually loved GFriend in this concept. Sin-B starts it off with the OW! and its off from there. the hook is super catchy, the verses have a great rhythm to them and the song is funky. i'd like to see them return to this kind of music but I don't think it'll happen since it flopped relative to their other stuff.

**maybe9** (8.5): its bad but in like a good way

**Neferpitta** (8.5): \m/

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Did somebody say fingerprint? Oh, no, wait, the song's called Fringertip. The crime writer in me is highly disappointed. Though this doesn't stand out as much as the glory that was Navillera, GFRIEND still does a much better job on Fingertip than you'd expect. The chorus here actually hits the mark pretty perfectly, and the girls don't sound bored here, making this a pleasant surprise for your ears. It's pretty decent, all things considered. I wish they had more songs like this.

**bluepupz** (8.3): The chorus is definitely my favorite part. I like how this sounds kinda different than a lot of their other songs

**\_xSyracuse** (8): Gmeh suddenly became Gwig tbh

**dynamicity** (8): The distorted funky bass really gives this song its soul. The catchy chorus and cinematic synths fill out the rest of the song and make it a fun listen.

**minsiii** (8): they definitely need to experiment in this style and concept more

**modotrising** (8): THEY SNAPPED

**three-stacks** (8): Props for trying something different.

**original\_doll** (7.5): I appreciate they switched up their concept for this one but ngl there is something about it that doesn't quite meet the mark for me. Still like it but it's one of the Gfriend titles I don't listen to as much

**kappyko** (7): Oh those horns made me doubt these girls but they CAME THROUGH AGAIN this comment is preemptive i know what to expect but their aesthetic is literally so up/down/left/right/center my alley oh its just good instead of great. bass is cool though

**MrSwearword** (7): it tries to split the difference between teen pop and Daft Punk to me and the results are mostly...there but needs tweaking

**nihilistickitten** (7): super nostalgic

**Nixon4Prez** (7): Somehow sounds very Gfriend and totally different at the same time

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): HOLY SHIT THEY DID SOMETHING DIFFERENT. When I say this is the first and so far, only GFRIEND comeback that impressed me, I fucking mean it. It was different, it was funky, it was fun. Also, the stage outfits were badass in a way. Anyways, this song fucking bangs. It’s funky as fuck and that’s what makes it great. It’s a stray away from their previous concepts and such and it worked imo. Also, the video has a cool video game like aesthetic going on, and as the local gamer it’s cool. (Also. there’s the space vibe and I fucking love space)

**edmiliballs** (6.7): it's not perfect but i like that they tried something different

**satanicyoona** (6.5): their best title track i rly hate kfans

**wugggs** (6.5): A step in a new direction for Gfriend but not really my favorite sound of theirs.

**bespectacled** (6): I feel bad giving GFRIEND so many 6's :((( They're just not my cup of tea

**franch** (6): i like all of this well enough but it sort of all sounds the same

**gannade** (6): sounds liek something from a video game soundtrack from 2002, not sure if im a fan

**popularsong** (6): interesting experiment but i don't feel much for it. i thought it was a good way to change up their concept without straying too far from the "gfriend" sound, but i never really come back to the song

**onceberry** (5.5): I wish they would try a concept like this again, this song just wasn't it

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I get halfway through this song before I realize that it’s playing. It’s not bad, listening to it closely it’s pretty nicely, but I dunno it doesn’t do it for me. It really develops a spark towards the end but even then it’s not enough.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): this sounds like cheap g-funk for an arcade game

**ttandrew** (4): eh

**tinnnn\_lv** (1): sounds like the last one!

**selegend** (8): A K-pop song with a guitar solo? Yes MA'AM. By the way, navillera means "fluttering", referencing Cho Ji-hoon's poem "The Monk's Dance". Queens of literature!

---
**agentofscranton** (10): GFriend was the only group I hadn't really listened to before this rate, but let me just say - I've truly been missing out

**heeyeon** (10): but more like a 10+, gfriend's music is right up my alley in general and they really did it with this one

**Hyperion2589** (10): THE best intro to a GFriend song and sneaky throw-off variation of the second chorus. Need I mention the electric guitar solo interlude?

**Johnnytoby** (10): The only good Gfriende song

**kappyko** (10): IDK IF ITS CATCHY OR IM JUST RELIEVED TO STAY AWAY FROM THE ONSLAUGHT OF EDM BUT I REALLY LIKE THIS STYLE OF OVERPRODUCTION THAT ISNT JUST DANCE TROPES REHASHED ITS LIKE LUSH ASS STRINGS (courtesy of garageband? who cares???) AND GUITARS WTF LITERALLY AHSWGJJAWKgKAKGK KJHAHAHAHAH

**lexarqade** (10): Their best song! I really wish they'd do something in this style again, Love Whisper was a bit too cute but this was awesome!

**MrSwearword** (10): cute enough for what it is

**Mudkip1** (10): this should be pokemon's next theme song or summ

**ttandrew** (10): iconic

**1998tweety** (9.3): Yeah they sound similar but its hard to fault Gfriend for sticking to this sound. They excel at it and it helps distinguish them from other groups. I would like to see them take a few more risks though (or maybe they do and its just their singles that sound the same).

**cyborglilith** (9): this is my favorite anime

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I'm not very familiar with any group in this rate at all, but from what I'm hearing on our server, most people agree that Navillera is a standout GFRIEND track compared to the rest of their discography. Though I've only heard all of five songs from them, I'm pretty sure they're telling the truth; there's a dynamic and passion here that most of GFriend's other entries in this rate lack, most noticable in the banger of a chorus which acts as a stark contrast to previous ones where their voices ended up blending together a little too sweetly. I'm ready to believe this is the best they have to offer, and if that's the case, then I guess I'm satisfied.

**wugggs** (9): An energetic, refreshing reboot after their GlassBead/MGT/Rough trilogy

**bluepupz** (8.5): The guitar in this is even better than in Rough. Love how upbeat and energetic it is

**Kromorei** (8.5): Those synths assaulted me. I enjoyed it.

**arrivederci1** (8): the scores im giving gfriend make me realise im actually a buddy even tho i've denied it so long

**c0ns3rvative** (8): Peak GFRIEND, even more produced than their older stuff but it nonetheless feels more cohesive with the post-chorus synth refrain beefing up the main instrumental sections and the funky electric guitar that appears sporadically getting its own bridge. Helps that the vocal production is louder and higher up in the mix, too, with some pretty sweet harmonies throughout

**grenjarl** (8): Strong chorus and well rounded song

**jamesfog** (8): This is also good

**jonnyd86** (8): love the prechorus and the hook. Eunha really shines in this song to me.

**Luxaria** (8): The chorus is a banger but I keep expecting it to turn into Cruel Angels Thesis which is distracting.

**nihilistickitten** (8): their best track

**Nixon4Prez** (8): sounds super similar to Me Gustas Tu but it’s like an improved version

**rotating3Dtext** (8): what’s a navillera

**RReg29** (8): can we extend that RIPPING guitar solo, por favor?

**WeirdSignal** (8): the chorus is so sweet

**amandapearl2** (7): Another gfriend signature sound, though for me personally I find it a bit too intense. It definitely was a smash hit though and had gfriend at the top of the charts for all of 2016.

**edmiliballs** (7): easily their best song

**modotrising** (7): Is this an anime opening? It should be.

**Neferpitta** (7): Gfriend go by the motto "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"

**popularsong** (7): love the more upbeat sound but otherwise it doesn't really stand out to me?

**gowestyoungkanye** (6.2): what does navillera MEAN is this another orange caramel catallena?!??!??

**bespectacled** (6): A very typical girl crush concept that sounds like a hit even tough I hate it

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): cheesy but not bad

**dynamicity** (6): A frantic number that attempts to evoke the same success as Rough but doesn't have anything that truly stands out on its own.

**franch** (6): i like all of this well enough but it sort of all sounds the same

**lilguavachan** (6): the background reminds me of playing ragnarok online, and i appreciate it. but the rest of it is just that same cutesy, aegyo thing i'm not a huge fan of

**Chubiski** (5): they replaced the violins with synths

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Who gave them an electric guitar? I admire them for trying something different but this song is a whole mess.

**tinnnn\_lv** (4): sounds like the first one

**Qwilphish** (3): Just Bad

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (3): REMEMBER THAT SAME VIBE/FORMULA/SONG CONCEPT WE’VE USED SINCE DEBUT? WE MADE IT RETRO AND IT STILL FUCKING SUCKS. I literally can only tell this one from the others by the fucking roller skates shown in the video. Look, I still don’t see the hype for the song and probably never will. But hey, yet again, the guitar in the bridge is nice. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m used to artists keeping same formulas (it’s kpop that’s just how shit works), but there’s a point where it stops being cute/cool/fun/etc. and becomes just annoying.

**maybe9** (1): bad

**selegend** (10): Yes, it's a copy of "Up & Down", but it's different enough to demand your attention, and it's less screechy. The bridge goes HARD.

**raicicle** (10): literally the best version of the same single EXID keeps releasing they’ve ever done, the way it goes from hani to LE in the verses? omg

---
**Kromorei** (11): Hani please step on me. This is the second best song in their discography but as I Love You is not in the rate this gets my 11 instead. Everything about this song is amazing but if I had to point out one thing it'd be Solji's ridiculous vocals.

---
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): it almost sounds like they're sampling the grindr notification sound i'm

**MrSwearword** (10): Mr. Saxobeat adjacent sound mixed with more Hi-NRG realness. Here for it

**popularsong** (10): an improvement from up&down that made it even more fun, probably my fav exid title track, im addicted

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): WHERE DO YOU LIVE? DO YOU LIVE ALONE? What a fucking way to open a song. Now I remember this comeback, I was fucking hyped. And you know what the song still gets me hyped. I mean the fucking back and forth in this song is insane. Like you thought Up & Down was good with the back and forth? WHEW BABY. Ah Yeah just fucking busted into the room to say HELLO. To say this song is badass to certain extent is not an understand. For those that don’t know “Ah Yeah” is basically a courteous Korean way of being dismissive to someone you don't want to answer. So basically, this entire song is telling creeps off. Amazing, right? Also, the video is a nice little fuck you too. Mostly because the video deals with the issues of censorship. The girls can be seen around different censored objects until the end when they unblur em to reveal that it’s all super safe stuff like a cute cartoon puppy and shit.

**wugggs** (10): Easily top 3 best/most impactful kpop songs of all time, fight me on this

**Hyperion2589** (9.5): Another banger of a song but just lacked that one more repeat of the chorus at the end.

**1998tweety** (9.3): Another song with a huge chorus, sonically its similar to Up & Down but different enough that it doesn't get repetitive.

**edmiliballs** (9): shinsadong tiger can remake this song as many times as he damn well wants

**minsiii** (9): objectively a BOP

**modotrising** (8.8): One has to love them calling out the industry's double standards and sounding cool while doing it. Also L.E. is the one of the best rappers in kpop and you can't change my mind.

**gowestyoungkanye** (8.7): the mv....these girls really came for men! we love them

**amandapearl2** (8.5): An excellent follow up to their viral hit. Also super fun, catchy, and sexy, but different enough from Up & Down to stand on it’s own. It’s really hard for me to choose which song I like more.

**arrivederci1** (8): I like up&down better better overall as a song but LE's rap saves my soul

**c0ns3rvative** (8): Almost comes across as too similar to Up & Down but there are enough unique production touches going on here to make it stand out. I particularly like the more pronounced contrast between the warbling, airy synths on the verses and the aggressively produced raps that they lead into. Flawless vocal work as per usual

**dynamicity** (8): Following in the footsteps of Up and Down, this song retains many of the same elements, but throws in a curveball with the tense back and forth of Hani's and LE's verses.

**jamesfog** (8): Very interesting song and video

**MissyBee37** (8): I didn't know this song before the rate but I was instantly into it. Catchy.

**Banananaise** (7.5): IREON SIGAN PPEONHAE, IDAERON BULPYEONHAE / JAKKU GEUREONGEOMAN MUREOBOJIMA / WEONHANEUNDAEROHAE, NANEUN GEUGE PYEONHAE / I SIGANI GA BEORIGIJEONE NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-OOOOOOOOO

**bluepupz** (7.5): Kind of a worse version of Up & Down for me. I don't like the random guy whispers at certain points, but I still like the song overall

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Ok, they really like saxophones. I do too, so I’m fine with this.

**\_xSyracuse** (7): Up & Down outsold

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): A good song, but it doesn’t really excite me? Like it’s high energy and fun, reasonably polished as well, but that doesn’t necessarily make it something memorable.

**Johnnytoby** (7): hmm

**jonnyd86** (7): Up & Down part 2, but i'm not complaining. doesn't quite reach the same heights but still a solid bop

**Qwilphish** (7): Its a good song but an Up&Down clone

**ttandrew** (7): cute

**Neferpitta** (6.5): Love the concept, but the song is a bit of an uninteresting effort to recreate Up & Down's magic.

**Luxaria** (6): EXID is the most aggressive GG.

**nihilistickitten** (6): gets stuck in your head but kind of annoying

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): There's some solid rapping here, but I don't really see why I'd listened to this over Up and Down; furthermore, as a crime writer, I think I have the right to be more than a little unnerved by the creepy whispering 'Where do you live? Where do you live?' at the beginning of Ah Yeah and all throughout the rest of the song. Why is he there? Decent, but not really what I wanted.

**RReg29** (6): we gotta do something about these HOT SAX RIFFZ tho

**Chubiski** (5): up & down pt 2

**Mudkip1** (5): wait til u see my dick imma beat that pussy up

**maybe9** (4): yikes that rap

**kappyko** (3.5): Okay, so you're a rocket scientist

**tinnnn\_lv** (2): sounds like the last one

**cyborglilith** (1): The rap girl's voice makes this unlistenable; also, where is the melody?

**selegend** (10): I used to not like this, but it's quite the perfect transition between Um Oh Ah Yeh and their jazzy *Memory* sound. Scientist Moonbyul with the biology, chemistry, and physics references in her verse. I love the Mr. Ambiguous and Piano Man references too. I hate that saturation filter that's used throughout the entire video though.

---
**MrSwearword** (11): how you're supposed to come correct in KPOP land. YAS GAWD, SLAY, etc.

---
**lilguavachan** (10): what blackpink should be doing instead of digging around 2NE1's demo vault

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): MAMAMOO is making use of its influences really, really, well so far, and I'm already half done with their songs in the rate! You're the Best definitely utilises its gospel touchings to the best of its ability; the girls singing 'Come on hey brother/come on hey sister' is a great hook to catch your attention, and overall You're the Best definitely sounds like it may have fit perfectly on Western radio a few years ago. I do wish the girls' voices were deeper, because it would suite the song better, but, hey, you can't have everything in life, can you?

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): You know what song doesn’t play? This song. This song doesn’t fucking play. Of course, it uses MAMAMOO’s classic funky grooves, but it builds upon it. If I had to use one word to describe this song, I would say energetic. The song just gets going and does not really stop. This is another one of those comebacks where I have vivid memories of it dropping, but I’ll be nice and not force you all through all details. Anyways, Moonbyul slays on this track. Okay okay… all the girls do, but fucking look at her go. Also, this is literally one of the most fun songs to sing in the shower. (Also, I remember dance moves from this one too so yeah)

**franch** (9.7): it's just SO WHOLESOME and cute aaaghh

**amandapearl2** (9.5): Mamamoo’s best song. Incredibly catchy melody and matching choreography that allows the girl’s bubbly personalities to shine.

**dynamicity** (9.5): Peak Mamamoo, peak Kpop. A staple summer song with Mamamoo's sass and some wild distorted brass sounds. This song also happens to be the proud owner of one of the best key changes in all of kpop (hey hEY HEY YEAH).

**wugggs** (9.5): amazing energy and a classic sound, a good melding of Old Mamamoo and New Mamamoo

**1998tweety** (9.4): Another big bop. I love every little bit of instrumentation in the background like the brass instruments. Moonbyul kills is as always, the chorus bops, what more can you ask for?

**edmiliballs** (9.2): they really hit their stride here

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): every mamamoo song sounds the same but that’s ok because it’s a good same. also the beret outfits gave birth to some baby lesbians, i can tell you that.

**jonnyd86** (9): love how sassy it is and the hook is sooo catchy

**RReg29** (9): oh, man, these vocals are killer. LOVE the swagger (these girls can GO for real)

**kappyko** (8.5): I like this a lot, a more upbeat take on their debut single

**minibjork** (8.5): something about mamamoo just radiants positivity

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): christina aguilera voice

**Hyperion2589** (8): A little weird given the different pop feel in the pre-chorus, and then a sudden key change back to jazz. Disliked the music video because of too many outfit concepts.

**Kromorei** (7.5): Maybe I'm just not sold on older MAMAMOO songs.

**Qwilphish** (7.5): The vocals go off

**bluepupz** (7): As usual I like the brass and jazzy vibes, but this probably isn't my favorite of their retro songs

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): A good song but I think it highlights the weaknesses of MAMAMOO’s old school sound, after a while it’s just kind of sound.

**Luxaria** (7): At least one of them sounds like Xtina, which makes me nostalgic.

**minsiii** (7): dig the melodic structure

**PostDebut** (7): I don't know what to say. All of their songs are competent, but they ain't clicking with me fully

**tinnnn\_lv** (6): because vocals

**Neferpitta** (5.5): A slightly less cute bop I guess.

**cyborglilith** (5): annoying

**satanicyoona** (5): how jazzy

**ttandrew** (4): eh

**selegend** (9): [Blackpink - Whistle (2016)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jil0WCh_UoQ)

**raicicle** (9): blackstink wins once again

---
**AroMorbid** (10): My first true exposure to kpop was earlier this year with this song. I could not stop listening to it

**BiPolarBear17** (10): Unlike the rest of their material, Whistle and Playing With Fire are fantastic tracks. They provide BLACKPINK with the opportunity to form their own identity as a group, allowing them to showcase their own unique charms and talents instead of chasing the coattails of their predecessors. In contrast to the track packaged alongside it, Whistle recognises that less can be more, as the primarily sparse instrumental, kitted with both whistling and bubbles bursting, makes for an always interesting listen. Whistle doesn't play it's entire hand prematurely either, enabling the closing chorus to be an absolute triumph once everything's finally brought to the table.

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): literally can there be a more iconic opening line than ‘make em whistle like a missile, bomb bomb’? NO. jennie’s rap is just... im on fire. this is the mv that made me fall back into kpop hell. the whistling in the chorus (padum??) is so fucking good. this is SO FUCKING GOOD thanks for lsitneing i’m doing this drunk

**lexarqade** (10): I vastly preferred this song to BBY when they both came out and tbh! It's still better!

**MissyBee37** (10): I looove the style of the verses. The way the melody slinks somewhere between a true vocal and a whispered conversation is so fun and fitting. I also love how the song builds, ebbing and flowing between an intimate near-whisper and the faster, more exciting bits (like the pre-chorus), just like the people in the narrative of the lyric as their attraction builds. The outtro with the sped-up beat is my favorite part, though.

**nihilistickitten** (10): sexy and iconic

**cyborglilith** (9.9): that RAP

**Johnnytoby** (9.5): Lisa slays

**bespectacled** (9): This is the superior blackpink debut song. More toned down and low-key than BBY but this definitely aged better.

**dynamicity** (9): This low key hip hop number blends a booming bassline (seriously, turn up those subwoofers) with memorable instrumentation and a catchy hook. The song swells to a satisfying climax when the moombahton beats kick in.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9): Now I’ll be honest I didn’t quite like this song that much when they first debuted after hearing Boombayah and getting fully sucked into that. But nowadays, between the two, this is my go-to. It’s a softer song but it still bangs pretty hard at the right time. I’d say this shows the “prettier” side of Blackpink compared to Boombayah which shows the harder side. Music video wise this one has some nice visuals but overall is more simplistic in a way compared to Boombayah. Also shout out to the Japanese version with the English raps. “When the sauce get to dripping I lick"

**wugggs** (9): One of my all-time favorite Kpop songs, it's unique enough to stand out but with a timeless, boppy sound... has aged really well.

**1998tweety** (8.6): I could basically repeat my comment for Boombayah over here, a lot of the same things I love but again the chorus is a bit too weird and kills the hype of the song.

**minibjork** (8.5): the switch up between the vocal & rap verses is still the best part of this song for me

**Chubiski** (8): amazing production!! they sound better rapping than singing.

**franch** (8): my least fav BLACKPINK song, but it's still a bop and i still love them

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Initially I didn’t much care for this song but the more I listen to it the more I come to appreciate the good parts of it. “Make him whistle like a missile… Bomb, Bomb” is ridiculously fun to say.

**Hyperion2589** (8): Not a fan of the minimalistic chorus but the liked the ending chorus with thicker instrumental. Wish they used that one for the whole song instead.

**minsiii** (8): the chorus SNAPS

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I like Whistle a little better than Boombayah, because a. there are no shrill plastic whistle sounds (thank God) and b. the more passive, sultry production over the stellar beat that accompanies it is a pleasant experience to listen to after the bombast of the previous track. Their rapping isn't half bad, either.

**tinnnn\_lv** (8): this is lit, loved how they incorporated the whistle and the breakdown before the chorus

**Qwilphish** (7.8): Hwi Hwi

**jonnyd86** (7.5): from the bridge on is my favorite part of the song

**kappyko** (7.5): please dont tell my parents i like blackpink

**SirFluffyButt13** (7.5): Jennie steals the show in this song like she does with every BLACKPINK song.

**Akastavo** (7): mixed feelings

**chainedapart** (7): Cringey lyrics, but nice MV

**Kromorei** (7): This is highkey their worst song. I really was not a fan of their debut.

**lilguavachan** (7): oddly, i kinda liked the acoustic version better LMAO

**Luxaria** (7): I just don't like this one as much, however BLACKPINK only puts out 4 songs a year so they are all good.

**Neferpitta** (7): It's cool but the verses could be a bit more interesting to make up for the sparse chorus. Also it's hard not to cringe a little when I hear "make em whistle like a missile" "every time I show up, blow up"

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): I don’t understand the ‘whistle like a missile’ imagery, but I like the bridge and prechoruses

**amandapearl2** (6.7): I like the sparse instrumentals a lot, and this originally was my preferred of their 2 debut songs. But as time wore on this has become quite forgettable. Beautiful music video though, probably my favorite of theirs.

**bluepupz** (6.1): This has such a wonderful bridge but I don't like how empty the rest of it sounds - it just feels like it's kind of missing something?

**c0ns3rvative** (6): This worked pretty well in its context as the B-side single that showed off BP's versatility but there's not as much going for it as a standalone track. The initial hook is pretty awful and the relatively bare chorus desperately needs some extra harmonics to fill in the space. Pretty awesome pre and bridge though - both the acoustic and electric guitars sound fantastic and Rose & Jisoo's vocal lines are very strong

**jamesfog** (6): I don't really use this song

**maybe9** (6): the whistle was bop material, everything else is flop material

**popularsong** (6): they stole the whistle song but at least they made it slappy i guess

**PostDebut** (6): kinda too lowkey and annoying at the same time? the melodic refrains are very nice though

**Qustomar** (6): i love everything but that chorus (okay the bridge is trash too tbh). i think this is what's called an anti-drop, and this song made me realize it's the worst. there's so much build-up in the pre-chorus for a gigantic, exciting, chorus, but then it just falters. it's such a blah song for me, but i cant say it's truly the worst, so just a six

**Nixon4Prez** (5.5): A little too minimalist

**RReg29** (4): whistle hooks should be banished to the outer realm

**MrSwearword** (1): christ, this is awful

**Mudkip1** (1): no

**ttandrew** (1): mess

**BiPolarBear17** (10): An absolute gem. Half the time it leaves me bawling my eyes out, and considering everyone else is going to rob it blind I'd be doing it a disservice if I gave it anything less than a 10.

**cyborglilith** (10): love the video

**Hyperion2589** (10): Masterful ballad with such dynamic chord progressions, modal mixture and key changes in music writing.

**Luxaria** (10): Honestly one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard- they are all such good vocalists.

**minsiii** (10): AND LIKE THEY ALSO NAILED A SLOW BALLAD SONG WHAT?

**modotrising** (10): Their soulful vocals... reveluvs won again. Those modulations... This song makes me want to stan Red Velvet

**MrSwearword** (10): at least they have the voices for a slowed down number

**original\_doll** (10): this song makes me emo 😭 their voices are so beautiful

**popularsong** (10): oof i was torn between giving this and sonatine a 11. haunting emotional didnt deserve to flop

**Qustomar** (10): anyone who doesn't like this song honestly does not have taste, im sorry but not in any way shape or form, ty

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): Fuck you guys, I love ballads (I’m only saying this because I fear it’s gonna flop). So this is one of the “Velvet” side songs. (Take note I fucking love the “Velvet” songs.) It’s an R&B ballad, it’s silky smooth, and I love it. Also I’ve straight up cried to this song like 5 times, it just takes me there. Also, if you all have a chance, check out the piano version of this that was included on the mini album (You know, along this, and two other remixes of it…. Don’t worry there was other songs, but I’m still pissed to this day that like half the mini album is 1 song and alt. versions of it.) The piano version is gorgeous too. Anyways, I wanna talk about the main focus point of this comeback, which is one fan theory. It has been a long-standing fan theory that many parts of the comeback were referencing the Sewol tragedy. (For those that don’t know, the Sewol tragedy was when the MV Sewol ship sunk with 304 passengers and crew dying, many were students from Danwon High School. The captain and three crew members were charged with murder, while 11 other crew members were indicted for abandoning ship.) Things like: - The paper boats used in teasers = the paper boats used for mourning - Yeri being blurred on the album cover = She was 18, about the same age of those that had died - The set of the MV looks like a boat - Joy is the sole survivor while the others represent those that drowned Look there’s a lot of stuff to the theory, feel free to look it up if you have the time. Which btw this wouldn’t be the first time SM has done this, the last time would have been with f(x)’s Red Light, but that was officially confirmed. I don’t remember if this one was ever officially confirmed, but I thought it should be know.

**WeirdSignal** (10): it's perfect

**Qwilphish** (9.5): velvety mmmmmmmmm the harmonies so good

**arrivederci1** (9.4): uuuunnndddeeerrraattteeeddd it's such a sad song and knowing the meaning behind it makes it even more sad

**1998tweety** (9): Finally we get to see the amazing versatility RV has as we hear the first song on their Velvet side. Although it doesn't pack the same energy as the earlier Red song, One of These Nights is a soothing ballad where RV can really show off their vocals.

**grenjarl** (9): a great ballad song

**jonnyd86** (9): RV shines here and I wish they'd do more ballads. that half key drop gets me every time.

**llehuty** (9): The depth of this songs and the places it goes are really magical.

**Nixon4Prez** (9): Criminally underrated

**ttandrew** (9): loves it

**AroMorbid** (8): First time listening, I think I could grow to really like this song.

**GroceryStore** (8): Best song vocally

**Kromorei** (8): Not what I come to Red Velvet for but it's still a very good song.

**lexarqade** (8): I absolutely hated this on release but now it's grown on me a lot.

**amandapearl2** (7.9): I am usually not much of a ballad person, but this ballad is special. The music video is literal modern art. It’s one of the most beautiful videos I have ever seen, period. This a gorgeous and rich song filled with meaning.

**bespectacled** (7.5): I wish Automatic was in this album instead so it's the slow RV song we can rate, but I still like it

**wugggs** (7.5): I'm not usually a ballad person but this song Goes There for me, big fan

**tinnnn\_lv** (7): i loved the violins in the beginning and quite an unconventional ballad.

**bluepupz** (6.8): A pretty ballad. Their voices sound lovely here but it's a little boring tbh

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): This song is fine but I think “Automatic” is better.

**kappyko** (6.5): oh what the hell is this

**c0ns3rvative** (6): Nice ballad! I like the really slow build that happens over the course of the track and the subtle delay on the vocals sounds great but I can't help but wish for a more stimulating vocal melody overall, this doesn't really show off their range

**jamesfog** (6): This sounds like a Christmas song

**RReg29** (6): an absolutely beautiful looking vid but this melody never gets off the ground for me (some of the chord changes are good, though)

**satanicyoona** (6): this is my favorite song of theirs to sing

**Chubiski** (5): an attempt to prove their versatility, which mostly works

**dynamicity** (5): It's pretty but it sounds like every other ballad.

**Neferpitta** (5): I hate kpop ballads ok.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Oh, come on, Red Velvet, you're supposed to be catchy. After MAMAMOO's ballads slash bops, I can't help but feel disappointed by One of These Nights. Red Velvet's vocals aren't suited for a slow song like this, and there's no exciting belting sections like all ballads need to have. Ultimately, the song fails.

**maybe9** (3): zzzzz ResidentSleeper you tried it

**gowestyoungkanye** (2): if i give rv something below a 3, it’s cause it’s a ballad. and to quote drunk me, ballads are disgusitng

**nihilistickitten** (0): because I never could get thru the whole song

**selegend** (10): Widely recognized as a masterpiece in K-pop communities - I'm surprised this didn't do better. This song is so epic it feels like a K-Drama in the best way possible - the expressive choreography, the strings, the GUITAR SOLO, YUJU'S BELT... just mind-blowing.

**raicicle** (10): this was my emo era

---
**ExtraEater** (11): OK I remember hearing this so long ago and thinking it's my favorite K-pop song and honestly it's still that good

**RReg29** (11): HOLY SHIT…this is phenomenal (and dat guitar solo!)

---
**agentofscranton** (10): i'm a sucker for some good strings mixed with a pop beat, and that guitar solo! wig!

**kappyko** (10): Idg why yall are trashing these elementary school students this bops and the guitar solo just added a whole point its fucking GOOD LOL

**letsallpoo** (10): this is better than anything the beatles have ever done

**Mudkip1** (10): bop

**Neferpitta** (10): What I'd consider to be Gfriend's masterpiece, both sonically and choreographically.

**popularsong** (10): def a highlight of their career and for a good reason. beautiful and magical

**Qwilphish** (10): THE DRAMA, THE CHOREO, EVERYTHING IS PERFECT

**tinnnn\_lv** (10): wow

**dynamicity** (9.5): The pinnacle of GFriend's trilogy, this song refines the sound of their earlier singles into a polished pop number. The vocals, orchestral elements, and electric guitar all blend together seamlessly to support the memorable chorus. This song sports one of the greatest endings in all of Kpop, with a nice bridge kicking off an electric (pardon the pun) guitar solo and Yuju's soaring ad-libs.

**Hyperion2589** (9.5): Love the mixing of violin and synth sounds here.

**cyborglilith** (9.2): bop

**1998tweety** (9.1): Before even going into this rate I already knew what Gfriend's biggest critic would be, their songs sound super similar. Personally I like to judge songs a bit more individually (especially since this is a singles rate), but I def get it if it lowers the enjoyment for others. With that being said I still think this is a great track worthy of a high score.

**GroceryStore** (9): Best choreo

**jonnyd86** (9): a great song start to finish, love the melodrama of it. to me, someone whose first language is english, the chorus is one of the most catchy fully Korean language hooks in kpop

**ttandrew** (9): classic

**lilguavachan** (8.5): i'm a sucker for strings that's what saving it EDIT: bitch is that a guitar solo????? oh my... wig...

**wugggs** (8.5): an eternal classic tbh

**amandapearl2** (8.2): The song that cemented gfriend as a top girl group. This song dominated 2016 and really defined the “gfriend sound”. Very reminiscent of early SNSD, the choreography, soaring instrumentals, and uplifting melody all work wonderfully together.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17570419-some-like-it-rough But for real I like this, it’s not super catchy but it’s got great energy, especially towards the end.

**jamesfog** (8): Ok this is good

**minibjork** (8): i need someone who knows enough about music theory to tell me why this song fills me w/ sentimental emotions wtf

**PostDebut** (8): I'm a sucker for anime soundtracks and jpop in general so this one ticks all of the right boxes

**bluepupz** (7.5): I like the guitar and other instruments in this

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): sounds like an anime opening or something

**Chubiski** (7): lowkey sounds like Me Gustas Tu

**Kromorei** (7): I mean it's catchy but it's still boring.

**Luxaria** (7): The electric guitar/dance break followed by the key change is a choice.

**maybe9** (7): how is this song both a zzzz ResidentSleeper but also a bop ???

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Hmm...well, I guess this is what I'd...typically....expect...from your average K-Pop song? I don't hate Rough, because I can obviously see that they were trying to make the song catchy, but it took a lot of spins for it to get into my head. Rough sounds like a demo with slightly upgraded production, because the song blends so well with itself and with the rest of GFRIEND's music to the point where hardly any parts of it stand out at all. It's decent, but not something I'd listen to.

**modotrising** (6.5): The drama of it all...

**franch** (5.9): i like all of this well enough but it sort of all sounds the same

**gowestyoungkanye** (5): i can verify now that gfriend sound like a worse cosmic girls

**MrSwearword** (5): this is a J-Pop song in a K-Pop frame and I take issue with that

**nihilistickitten** (5): not bad but would not listen by choice

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (4): Oh look… another GFRIEND song I’m still fucking OVER. Now this one is a bit better than Me Gustas Tu, (I’m putting that on the violins) but it’s still not amazing. I wanted to like GFRIEND then and I want to like them now, but I just can’t. They’re just not my cup of tea.

**Overall average**: 7.079 **// Total points:** 1132.660 

---

**1998tweety** (8.980): Going into this I had a feeling Gfriend was gonna get dragged the most. Their music is very anime which doesn't seem to fit most people's taste here. 

**cyborglilith** (8.740): all of these songs sound the same. 

**You_Will_Die** (8.100): Really fun sound. Uses a lot of strings combined with some epic high notes, cool guitar solos as well. 

**bluepupz** (7.620): A lot of their songs sound similar to me - and they fall into the category of "I'll enjoy this if I hear it but I wouldn't put this on a playlist or purposefully seek it out". I don't mind their style but it's just not the kind of music I usually listen to 

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.500): Out of all the acts in this rate who have more than two songs, GFRIEND is the one I'm least interested in checking out. There's something cute about them, and I actually don't dislike them all that much (Fingertip and Navillera? Both huge boos), but they don't seem to have anything special past their aesthetic. 

**modotrising** (6.660): I'd never sat down and listened to them so I was pleasantly surprised! 

**Chubiski** (6.600): before this rate I only listened to Me Gustas Tu because I watched their iconic performance in the rain 

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.200): I’m not sure why I don’t stan GFRIEND, because theoretically I should. They hit on a lot of marks for what I really like in a girl group, elegant, synth heavy, innocent concept, great vocals and harmonies, but for some reason their music just doesn’t do it for me. At least this demonstrates that on some level I really do care about music, not just image. “Time For The Moon Night” is probably my favorite song by them. 

**franch** (5.980): i like all of this well enough but it sort of all sounds the same 

**unabletoventure** (4.580): most of the songs sounded the same 

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (3.800): I want to love you GFRIEND, I truly do. You all seem like nice girls, and SinB always fucking reminds me of Jessica Jung (who I love) but all the cute shit just makes it hard for me. Crank out another Fingertip then I’ll reconsider.

**selegend** (6): Head-banging fun at best, cacophonous at worst. JinSoul's ad-libs make the nausea justifiable; the song kinda feels like if you've had too many drinks in one night.

---
**1998tweety** (10): Finally the whole group is together, this sound works so well for them. I'm not sure what the line distribution looks like but overall the song is great.

**AroMorbid** (10): The first Kpop song I wait in anticipation for!

**franch** (10): HOW DO I GET A SECOND "11" TO USE OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): this choreo is the reason i am gay. thanks for coming to my ted talk. an 11 contender if rv didn’t exist.

**Hyperion2589** (10): What preposterous idea of purposely creating dissonance, yet mind-blowingly satisfying.

**kappyko** (10): soty 2018 lbr

**lilguavachan** (10): oh thank god a bop to wash away the grime

**Luxaria** (10): This might be said a lot but but this is my favOriTe, absolute barnstormer.

**Qwilphish** (10): another iconic intro. OT12 T_T

**skargardin** (10): This is fucking wild and I LOVE IT

**bespectacled** (9.5): BBRRRRRRRAAAAAHH. A biting, "fuck-you" debut by a group that has already proven they could deliver any genre and concept well

**Akastavo** (9): love the beat

**arrivederci1** (9): didn't like it at first but now i bbbbrrrrrraaahhhh along with it

**c0ns3rvative** (9): Easily one of the rhythmically coolest tracks in recent k-pop history, the percussion line is super dense and harkens back to an era of western dance-pop that otherwise hasn't been explored too much in Korea

**Johnnytoby** (9): Love this Jessie J song

**lexarqade** (9): They really went "I wanna try something right now" and then snatched me! Justice for Haseul's lines though

**minsiii** (9): better mixing would put this at a 10

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): their powers combined...

**maybe9** (8.5): its a bop, but the verses are a little zzzz ResidentSleeper compared to the rest of LOOΠΔ's discography

**GroceryStore** (8.3): Probably their best instrumental, but the vocals let it down

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Read my [+ +] review, I talk for a while about this song.

**nihilistickitten** (8): sexy bad ass song

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): For the first time since BLACKPINK, I'm hearing an EDM influence in favORiTE. Barely three minutes long, the song might be a little too short for its own good. There's a lot of banger potential in this track, though the hook isn't really that suited for the girls' voices, but three minutes isn't enough to make sure every minute of the song shines. favOriTe is good, but it's also a disappointment.

**Qustomar** (8): i like favorite, but i hardly ever revisit it compared to many other loona songs; although, when i do listen to it i question why i dont listen to it more haha

**ttandrew** (8): bop

**WeirdSignal** (8): this song is janky in a good way

**jonnyd86** (7.5): this song grew on me from the first time i listened to or maybe its more accurate that the BRRRRRRRAHs were too undeniable for me to not enjoy this song. the prechorus is great too.

**Nixon4Prez** (7.5): BRRRRRAH

**three-stacks** (7.5): LOONA's Avengers moment.

**wugggs** (7.3): really solid full group debut but lacking

**RReg29** (7): rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrah

**bluepupz** (6.9): Kind of chaotic with how many elements are present at times. I like the build up that starts at 2:27

**unabletoventure** (6.8): the intro was special but a little disorientating

**amandapearl2** (6.2): yikes I HATED this song when it came out lol. I don’t like the music video at all, all of the attempts of sexy feel really forced and the choreography is really basic. I have since warmed up to the song, but it’s still my least favorite LOONA title by a long shot.

**heeyeon** (6): this song tires me for some reason lol, it's still alright tho

**Kromorei** (5.5): This barely feels like a song. The bit leading into the chorus is the only part I even really like.

**grenjarl** (5): the song flows strangely with lyrics too disjointed from background instrumental

**MrSwearword** (5): not my favorite but I mean it's semi-decent

**Neferpitta** (5): I quite like the instrumental on this but there's too much going on, someone's always singing and there's not really much room for the instrumental to breathe. It just feels a bit noisy and the vocals sound quite jarring at times. Can still bop to it though ngl

**popularsong** (5): it's fun but unbelievably noisy. the instrumental has way too much going on. probably their weakest group song

**dynamicity** (4): An interesting song with a wild prechorus to chorus transition and a seemingly endless array of unique synths. Unfortunately, it just feels messy and crowded, particularly in the chorus, where everything but the weak bass occupies the same space.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (3): You hear that noise kids? It’s a trainwreck. Look, I wanna like OT12 Loona but like…. This is a fucking mess. The only super redeeming things about this song are: the chorus but even then, it has a lot of flaws, and the bridge. But that’s it kids. It feels like they tried to combine like 50 different songs into 1 and this was the result. I guess you could say that uhhh this isn’t my favorite.

**letsallpoo** (1): imagine spending years on the most complex promo rollout ever only to properly debut with a cacophonous "call me baby" ripoff ugh their MINDS

**PuggleMaster** (0): a jessie J beat and a nauseating music video???? I think this 0 is deserved

**selegend** (9): This may be one of their best vocal performances. The coffee shop production brings this nighttime bop home. The instrumental itself is heavenly. Actually, that entire mini-album is perfection even though Solji isn't in it.

**raicicle** (10): EXID’s best outing from their normal formula

---
**heeyeon** (11): fight me

**minibjork** (11): i wish EXID made more songs with this jazz-y city pop feel. an underappreciated jam.

---
**BiPolarBear17** (10): Since their debut, EXID have been releasing stellar material left right and centre, but when their powerhouse vocalist, Solji, had to take a hiatus for her health, I think it was safe to say everyone was worried. Obviously worry was aimed at Solji herself (who is an angel and deserves the world), but also over how they'd survive musically without her. To make up for her absence, the group were forced to think outside the box for their music, and despite expectations they ended up releasing some of their strongest material because of it. 'Eclipse' and 'Full Moon' are remarkable EPs, and the lead single from the former, 'Night Rather Than Day' is a brilliant example of that. It's jazzy instrumental and groovy melodies make for a heavenly laid-back experience, and despite the song's more chill atmosphere it's hooks still stick with you. As this was the other contender for my 11, I hope this gets the justice it deserves.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): oh this smooth jam

**GroceryStore** (10): Their best comeback, I hope they do more songs like this and the album

**Meepmeepmusik** (10): Underrated bop

**MrSwearword** (10): anything funky/jazzy like this bodes well

**Mudkip1** (10): this is a vibe sisters!

**popularsong** (10): OOF EXID CAN'T HAVE A BAD SONG such a beautiful chill bop

**Qwilphish** (10): plays into their strengths w/o solji

**wugggs** (10): Perfection - a new concept and a fresh sound, plus Hyelin really came through with the vocals

**kappyko** (9.5): Oh, DISCO? I LOVE THIS! EXID have fun with restraint in a synth-y, funky, house-y jam that falls squarely between "Miracle" by Kimbra and "Make Me Feel" by Janelle Monáe in quality and sound. Hmmmm, a 9 and a 10.... carry the 10, add the 9, divide by 2, no, 3, no, 2, add 10 for austerity, clap your hands... it's a bop

**chainedapart** (9): Underrated song

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Probably the best EXID track in the rate, maybe it’s just my propensity for disco but this song is so slick and nice to listen to. I’ve had a rough relationship with the rappers in this group, I often feel like they’re out of place, but they really fit the groove of this song. It gets a little repetitive towards the end but it maintains a good energy and flow that keeps it interesting all the way through.

**Johnnytoby** (9): :,(

**lexarqade** (9): This is a slapper! Usually when they change up their sound the songs aren't amazing but this one is really good and works in the absence of Solji.

**lilguavachan** (9): what the fuck why have i skipped over this girl group [2]

**llehuty** (9): A major departure from their formula, but a very welcomed one.

**maybe9** (9): THE INSTRUMENTAL IN THE BACKGROUND YES missing a true bop chorus tho

**minsiii** (9): eargasmic everything

**PostDebut** (9): Screw everybody (including me) who slept on this jazzy bop

**rotating3Dtext** (9): funky?

**edmiliballs** (8.9): unfairly slept on

**1998tweety** (8.6): This song isn't bad but I've come to much prefer EXID's faster, dance-able tracks. Still, it is nice to see the versatility.

**amandapearl2** (8.5): A departure from their usual sound and rather polarizing in the fandom, this really works for me. I love the laid back vibe, a smart move since their power house vocalist Solji was sick at this time and couldn’t participate in this album.

**dynamicity** (8.5): This song may sound like elevator music, but it's damn good elevator music. Hani's "Butterflies in my mi-i-i-ind" line is a particular standout.

**original\_doll** (8.5): ooh nice, I like the retro vibe

**three-stacks** (8.5): Really strong single - great instrumentation, love the way it keeps changing in dynamics but manages to seem cohesive.

**AroMorbid** (8): This rate gave me an excuse to listen to EXID (& many other acts). I like their stuff, this was my favorite.

**bluepupz** (8): This is a fun and funky song. LE is great but the nasally phrase that she ends the song with (and repeats throughout) is jarring when everything else is so smooth

**Luxaria** (8): I like this one, a much more RnB type flow which works, the vocals really got to shine in this one while still letting the raps be free. A bop.

**jonnyd86** (7.5): groovy jazzy bop that didn't quite connect with the masses but I think its a solid song

**arrivederci1** (7.4): I like this song but there's nothing too special about it

**Kromorei** (7): It's honestly just kinda boring but still a nice song to play in an elevator.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): So, from what I've observed, modern Korean pop definitely carries very strong influences from American RnB, and Night Rather Than Day is a good example of that. It could pretty much be an album cut from a modern rhythm album today. The problem here is that the song's melody is nothing special to Western ears, and overall, Night Rather Than Day ends up being pleasant to listen to, but pretty disappointing, considering I like EXID's other spins on the genre much better.

**RReg29** (7): pretty fun one

**tinnnn\_lv** (7): i enjoyed this too!!

**ttandrew** (7): nice

**gowestyoungkanye** (6): it’s kinda a ballad but i’ll give it a pass

**Hyperion2589** (6): Just doesn't feel like a EXID song without Solji.

**jamesfog** (6): Ramen ramen

**onceberry** (6): Let's just say I'm so thankful we've got Solji back now

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (6): I uhhhh… I DON’T REMEMBER THIS SONG. It’s all a blur for me. (inb4 fake fucking fan) Look, I love EXID, but apparently this song just wasn’t it for me at the time. It’s a lot jazzier compared to their other releases and it’s not bad. But it’s just forgettable. I mean the saxophone in it is nice, but the rest is just eh. I don’t wanna be an asshole and be like “maybe it’s because Solji was out from this comeback due to health issues”, but like. You can’t deny she adds something to the group. Also, btw, the other day she got the all clear on recovery so congrats to her. Anyways, I think I’ll probably come back to this song. Reminds me of The Story of Light B-Sides (especially those from EP 2). Yeah, it’s a good song, but it’s just not their best by far.

**cyborglilith** (4): I can't think of any reason to listen to this song.

**Neferpitta** (4): This is... boring.

**selegend** (8): I prefer this one the most out of all of their weird, shouty Red singles. The dubstep production SLAPS!

**raicicle** (9): yeri snapped

---
**agentofscranton** (10): ice cream cakes are overrated they’re too cold and they hurt my teeth

**bespectacled** (10): This may sound like a reach but I'll never be not amazed by the garage rock / dubstep hybrid sound of this bop. We love a sexual innuendo-filled anthem!

**c0ns3rvative** (10): Remains as eccentric today as when it came out. The jarring contrast between the childish bell samples and the rest of the instrumental is killer, the distorted electropop synths sound great, and the crushed explosion sample that ushers in the chorus is an all-time favorite production choice, and the rapid-fire hats are bizzare but work so well

**Johnnytoby** (10): You dont know how many times I've screamed the end

**MissyBee37** (10): This song is delicious, pun 100% intended. Just pure catchy fun!

**PuggleMaster** (10): SO ICONIC

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): This song has literally convinced me to by ice cream cakes for my birthday since it came out. So, this was the first comeback with Yeri and I remember really being intrigued because the teasers fucking remind me of a horror movie. I mean, listen to those lalalalas’s and tell me they wouldn’t be out of place in a horror movie. There was also the slight pre-release “velvet” track Automatic which I fucking love, but we’re not rating that so back to ICC. ICC is bombastic. Backed by what I can literally call an ice cream truck music beat, and some dance production, this song flies from minimalism to full on fun time. Also that chorus is literally one of the catchiest kpop choruses to date that I know of. So now I wanna talk about the video, #1 cause I fucking love it, #2 cause I have shit to point out. So this video for the most part was filmed at the Four Aces motel set. If this set looks familiar it’s because it’s been used in plenty of other videos (MCR’s Na 9x, Halsey’s Bad At Love, LOONA Odd Eye Circle’s Girl Front, Lady Gaga & Beyonce’s Telephone (okay that was mostly the diner set in it, but still)). Anyways the video was uhhhhhh refreshing to say the least in a way. Look idk how much that makes sense but it probably would have made sense if you were there. Like, who the fuck wouldn’t wanna chill with RV in the desert. Also, it’s just a really pretty video. And to this day I still want one of those light up fur coats. Oh and sidenote, I HAVE NO GWANSIM IN THAT BAG

**tinnnn\_lv** (10): this is pretty lit, not gonna lie

**franch** (9.9): continuing the super happy vibe of happiness, just a little deduction for cheesiness. idk pretty close to a ten it leaves me with a stupid grin on my face. i love saccharine kpop so much.

**BiPolarBear17** (9.5): This slaps to the moon and back but I'd like to take this opportunity to say that Automatic is an 11 thank you good night.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): whew the creepy intro still snatches me

**Kromorei** (9): A BOP!

**minsiii** (9): so weird yet so wonderful

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Is this vore? I actually included this in my vore playlist as a joke without knowing how it sounded like. I wish I'd listened to the song back then; my playlist may have long faded from relevancy, but Ice Cream Cake sounds like a timeless bop. Maybe not understanding what the girls are saying helps, because I feel like the lyrics are probably gross, but this is easily the catchiest song dedicated to everybody's favorite desert since ice cream vendors hijacked Scot Joplin.

**Qustomar** (9): i cant help but feel like this is just a song taken from electric shock/rum pum pum era f(x), but this song is still a goddamn banger, i scream, you scream, gimme gimme that ice cream. shining moment is irene's rap, and the music video which is still the best red velvet music video don't @ me

**WeirdSignal** (9): sexual innuendos aside song slaps

**1998tweety** (8.8): A cute fun bop. This song is so energetic and has a lot going on. I like how wild the production is in this track, especially how heavily inspired by edm is sounds for a pop song.

**0ut0fthew00ds** (8.5): such a sticky chorus

**amandapearl2** (8.5): I love the subtle creepiness of this song. It’s creepy in the same way porcelain dolls are creepy. The styling is perfection. This chorus is one of my favorites and the point choreography is excellent.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I think that this song is where Red Velvet found their concept and showed that they had the potential to be a next level group. Red Velvet are one of my favorite girl groups because their songs are fun, but a little creepy and threatening. The girls have bright, sunny voices and sing cheerfully but those creepy descending “lahs,” discordant harmonies, and eerie chimes undercut things and give it a twist that makes it more than just the basic bubblegum song. I’m in love with their delivery of the line about the flavors!

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): I SCREAM YOU SCREAM

**arrivederci1** (8.4): it took a while (like 2 years) but this song really grew on me. I especially love Irene and Joy's rap

**gowestyoungkanye** (8.2): i’m into kpop in like, cycles? one of my mutuals on tumblr was posting gifs of their light up jackets in this mv when it came out and my gay ass was like :o and i stanned from then on. jk i forgot about them until russian roulette lol.

**Akastavo** (8): the intro scares me

**AroMorbid** (8): Haunting and catchy, one of the first RV songs I've heard

**Hyperion2589** (8): Kind of a safe song given vocal ability, not much variations, still catchy enough.

**jamesfog** (8): Is this a metaphor for they pussies

**jonnyd86** (8): great hook, love the spasmic percussion as well. once again the rap is mehhh but better than Happiness's

**Luxaria** (8): A much more coherent song than Happiness and the chorus is just so good.

**Neferpitta** (8): Irene is the best female rapper in Kpop. Exhibit A:

**nihilistickitten** (8): silly but likable

**popularsong** (8): iconique i scream u scream gimme that ice cream

**wugggs** (7.6): Didn't age super well but still a bop

**kappyko** (7.5): its not my favorite red velvet song at all even though their discog is impeccable this included so if it wins im gonna talk to rai abt problems at school. as for the song itself, the music box stuff is qt af n tha bro step/electroheavyshit is bonkerz it just doesnt hit that sweet spot as much as their other shit duz

**Chubiski** (7): irene’s pops nae rap is iconic. the whole song is lowkey about giving head though

**dynamicity** (7): A fun combination of spooky-cute and pure pop. I find this song a bit underwhelming after hearing the demo version though, which had dirtier vocals and harmonies that suited the song much better.

**Mudkip1** (7): what is this

**Qwilphish** (7): The song people refer to for weird ass red velvet

**RReg29** (7): fun shit

**ttandrew** (7): talent won

**bluepupz** (6.5): There's a lot going on, and I don't like the chorus that much

**\_xSyracuse** (6): + an imaginary 11 points for Automatic, which would've been my 11

**cyborglilith** (6): annoying

**Nixon4Prez** (6): this is frozen yoghurt cake at best

**heeyeon** (5): i know a lot of people got into red velvet because of this song, but my automatic supremacist ass can't relate

**maybe9** (2): yuck

**PostDebut** (2): Wow... this is just... unsettling

**MrSwearword** (1): this is such trash, ugh

**satanicyoona** (1): i'm so sorry the only good part in this song is irene&joy's rap bc otherwise it's just a mess pls forgive me

**selegend** (2): I hate how gassed up Grimes' contribution is to this. This was like the only K-pop GG song to be reviewed by Pitchfork, and they spent half the review talking about Grimes. For her 10 second DDLG uwu intro. Very much like "Gee" & "Very Very Very" but it doesn't go hard enough.

---
**Mudkip1** (11): wow talent aka grimes

**ttandrew** (11): incredible

**vodkainsipido** (11): i remember u/raicicle got me into loona due to the memes around the group and this was the first song i listened to and i was in absolute awe of it, the instrumental is probably my favourite this year

---
**AroMorbid** (10): 'Whistle' was my first kpop experience (apart from from cultural phenomenons like Gangnum Style), but this is the song that encouraged me to explore LOONA and Kpop in general. Will always hold a special place in my heart

**Chubiski** (10): Grimes is my favorite idol

**GroceryStore** (10): One of their most catchiest songs

**kappyko** (10): Kick me in the ass

**maybe9** (10): when its right, its right

**PostDebut** (10): My favourite part is when Grimes says "Uh Huh, Listen boy, my first love story"

**PuggleMaster** (10): iconic

**amandapearl2** (9.5): My favorite subunit. I love everything about this song. It’s so energetic! I love the bright synth instrumentals and Gowon’s rap interjections. The choreography is adorable and their yellow suits are just so cute. The music video is so aesthetic, I love the contrast of the dark story they’re telling with such a happy song.

**Hyperion2589** (9.5): Promised myself to give at least one song not a 10, this drew the short straw.

**SirFluffyButt13** (9.2): yyxy is the best section of LOONA hands down. Nonstop bops from all of them. Also rendezvous 18.6y is the best song off of yyxy.

**\_xSyracuse** (9): When we get Grimes ft. Loona I might legally change my name to the song title. "c" found dead

**arrivederci1** (9): i thought it was generic at first but now I listen to it more it has become my life source

**bespectacled** (9): this song blue-balled me so much, grimes' production on a loona track would've been epic. Still great though.

**edmiliballs** (9): deserves a ten but god that intro goes right through me every time

**minsiii** (9): most iconic opening line of 2018

**popularsong** (9): could do better without the intro lmao but otherwise a very cute upbeat song i can't get enough of

**Qustomar** (9): grimes is the greatest kpop idol to have ever existed, congratulations grimes, u did THAT

**rotating3Dtext** (9): is this lesbian

**WeirdSignal** (9): love how grimes appears for 3 bad lines lol

**1998tweety** (8.8): The Grimes feature on this track is so underused, at first I thought she did the weird edm bit in the bridge but apparently that's not the case. Chuu's vocals slay so hard on this. The one thing I don't like a whole ton about this is that it feels similar, especially the beginning, to GG's Gee which is a really hard song to match and I don't think love4eva does it.

**bluepupz** (8.5): I love Grimes' voice in the beginning! I think it sets the tone for the rest of the bubblegum nature of the song

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Read my [+ +] review.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Well, I've never listened to Grimes before. Apparently she only does the introduction, which is disappointing. Still, I'm shook that her voice is that high; I just can't imagine it tucking Elon into bed every night, if you know what I mean! Anyway, ignoring the sub's second favourite modern art pop act, LOONA does a fantastic job at delivering a hook-filled bop; I have no idea whether Grimes actually wrote this, but whoever came up with 'Come on, come on baby, tell me your story' is probably a bonafide genius.

**Qwilphish** (8.5): Hello, Finally introducing....LOONA. Are you girls ready... LETS GO

**jamesfog** (8): Maybe they snapped

**Kromorei** (8): Undeniably the best song to come out of a LOONA subunit. It's bright, energetic, cute, and is super catchy. Love the chorus.

**lexarqade** (8): Holds up spork Hewwo! (_) finawwy intwoducing... woona!!!! :3 Awe u gewls weady??? 0w0 weeeeeeeet's go!

**Neferpitta** (8): Loona's take on Gee/Very Very Very - probably better than the latter but not quite on the level of the former. I have to say I was a bit disappointed that Grime's input was limited to the saccharine intro yet she doesn't even sell that to me.

**gowestyoungkanye** (7.8): remember, elon musk stans loona

**dynamicity** (7.5): I was expecting a cool mashup of Loona's and Grimes' styles but all I got was a Loona song with a laughable attempt at some grunginess in the bridge.

**Akastavo** (7): bouncy track reminds me of hi high

**cyborglilith** (7): annoying bop

**jonnyd86** (7): a little too 'Very Very Very' for me.. the dance break at the end saves it for me.

**Luxaria** (7): Clueless is literally responsible for all of 2018 fashion choices.

**gannade** (6.5): grimes is a plague that doesnt shower

**Nixon4Prez** (6.5): cute but the synths get a little grating

**modotrising** (6): I've seen live stages for this and I very much the "trying to escape the system" vibes I got.

**RReg29** (6): it’s alright

**original\_doll** (5.5): that intro lol. the vocals in this one are kinda flat sounding and ngl it sounds a little unpleasant at times :/

**satanicyoona** (5.5): bop!

**MrSwearword** (5): bubbly but just does nothing for a while

**tinnnn\_lv** (5): interesting concept tbh this group but for the song it’s a 5

**wugggs** (5): wtf is the grimes feature here lol but at least it's catchy

**letsallpoo** (2): that breakdown is horrendous. the song was then further ruined when i read the lyrics

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (2): WE APPRECIATE GRIMES. But apparently BlockBerry did not because they only used her in the fucking INTRO for like 4 lines. You know what, it has just hit me what this song fucking reminds me of…. Very Very Very by I.O.I (Remember them?) Anyways, I remember when this dropped I scanned through the whole song to see if Grimes popped up again…. She didn’t, I was disappointed. That solid my opinion on the song. And even still that fact aside I don’t quite like it. Also, that fucking edm dubstep breakdown…. Those are old now.

**lilguavachan** (1): the rest of the song is great! so you might be wondering why i'm giving it a 1? grimes. i just can't stand that little demented jigglypuff and i was immediately over this song the moment she started talking. thank god she was only a small part, but a rotten apple spoils the whole bunch! fuck off satan! fuck off right now!

---
**1998tweety** (10): I know I've said it a lot but this is pop perfection. This is a really good debut track and has stayed as one of my favourite Twice songs of the years.

**agentofscranton** (10): momo's outfit and dance break in the mv is so iconic it hurts

**AroMorbid** (10): An anthem, I love dancing and shouting to this bubbly tune. My favorite?

**cyborglilith** (10): Of course I hate the title again, but this is still a major bop.

**Glennishill** (10): Incredible debut track.

**Johnnytoby** (10): I love the quack noises

**Luxaria** (10): Jihyo my vocal queen. Also the raps in this one are particularly good. (Do I have any idea what the MV concept is about? Nope. Do they all look banging? Yep.)

**MissyBee37** (10): I WISH I HAD THREE 11s. This song is just so f-ing perfect. It's sooo catchy & fun, the lyrics are adorable, the song is adorable. I love how happy this song makes me feel. I'm glad I have that "ooh-ahh" love!

**Qwilphish** (10): its so good i love it ttfealfea

**bespectacled** (9.5): An awesome, vocally-solid, overall great debut!!! I hope they don't JUST do cheesy, sugary songs in their next comebacks!!! /s :(

**Qustomar** (9): one of my favorite Twice songs, which now is forgotten because of Cheer Up being the era where Twice truly blew up :(

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (9): Look it’s one of only TWO good TWICE songs. Will this song get panned? Probably. Do I give a shit? Nah. TWICE had a fucking vision with this song okay. They somehow combined sweet and badass and it was nice. And then the cute plague hit, but I’ll get to that upon the other songs. Like OOH-AHH of course was their debut song. This came after the group was assembled via reality “survival” show Sixteen. Which I didn’t watch because I’m not a big fan of survival reality music shows. But anyways, this song ended up becoming one of my favorites because surprise… it got stuck in my head. I woke up with it stuck in my head one morning and just fucking broke. And yeah here we are. Also shout to the video, apocalypses are cool.

**tinnnn\_lv** (9): it’s such an unconventional song but it worked really well together!!

**amandapearl2** (8.6): What a great debut. Fun, cute, a touch sexy. We knew Twice’s brand from day 1. I love the choreography, it fits perfectly and the chorus is so catchy.

**dynamicity** (8.5): Still one of Twice's best and criminally underrated.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): This actually really warmed up to me over the course of trying to get used to TWICE's music (heh). This sounds like a theme song, but it doesn't emulate more boring girl groups like GFRIEND - this time, TWICE are the stars of the show, as hinted by the stellar bridge where they perform a memorable namedrop. It's a fun little ditty, and it's pretty cute.

**three-stacks** (8.5): The best of the debut songs on the list and the one that's also aged the best. It sets the stage for TWICE's dominance and their murderer's row of singles which followed.

**Akastavo** (8): the beginning of a superpower

**Neferpitta** (8): It's kinda noisy and has a lot going on but it still bops.

**wugggs** (8): one of the most solid debuts in kpop history

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): uwah!!

**Hyperion2589** (7): Other than the modal mixture at the start between major and minor keys, pretty boringly average. Nothing all that catchy.

**jonnyd86** (7): song is hard carried by the hook and dance break, verses are slightly grating

**Nixon4Prez** (7): Cute enough for a debut but not the best they have to offer

**popularsong** (7): solid debut momos abs saved my life

**kappyko** (6.5): sounds like a 2000s pop song kinda cute

**gowestyoungkanye** (6): you’re about to read a lot of twice hate, but this one’s pretty okay

**Kromorei** (6): I actually sorta hate 2016 TWICE. Like, a lot.

**RReg29** (6): it’s aight

**ttandrew** (5): cute

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.2): budget chiptune moment

**minsiii** (4): the bridge and second verse aren't very good

**MrSwearword** (4): mostly annoying

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): I think the video for this song is absolutely genius (let’s solve the zombie apocalypse by being cute!) but the song itself just kind of leaves me flat. Usually with a Kpop song you kind of understand the part of it that you’re supposed to focus on but nothing about this really grabs me. No part of it is especially distinctive, even after listening to it a few times I can’t remember what the chorus sounds like, the bridge is uninteresting, and the outro is uninspired. Also, I’m not gonna say that TWICE can’t sing because they clearly can, but this track is not a cute look for them. The flute is cute fantastic.

**maybe9** (0): what the actual fuck how is this song so audibly UGLY

**selegend** (7): The K-pop song heard around the world; it became Blackpink's first charting song in many territories. Yes, it is quite literally 2NE1 scraps. I have a lot of fun listening to this even if I don't think it's good or original.

---
**jamesfog** (11): The best K-POP song. Periodt.

---
**1998tweety** (10): The megabop has arrived. This was the first BP song that came out since I became a fan, and wow the release was everything. The music video and song were both so amazing, too bad we only got 1 track like this.

**40073521** (10): Just a fun song to dance and sing along to terribly. CALL ME PRETTY AND NASTY

**Akastavo** (10): pre chorus gets me turnt

**AroMorbid** (10): This song is the epitome of a perfect kpop song

**cyborglilith** (10): an anthem

**franch** (10): this probably was like a 9.5 but "BLACKPINK in yr area" is automatically a bonus

**Hyperion2589** (10): Absolutely love the retro style chorus.

**Johnnytoby** (10): Magic

**jonnyd86** (10): blackpink at their best and brightest. everyone puts in a performance, catchy from start to finish, the hook is undeniable.

**Kromorei** (10): Easily their best song and the one I cannot stop coming back to.

**MissyBee37** (10): This song is pure fun and I love it. The background vocals ("little bit of this" etc.) are one of my favorite details. Love the chorus. BLACKPINK in your area!

**PuggleMaster** (10): oh wow i love the chorus

**Qwilphish** (10): SUCH A GROWER UGHHH THAT BEAT SWITCH

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): Man, I wished my classsmates played As If It's Your Last more instead of DDD-DU or Boombayah. This is the first k-pop song I've heard that's actually close to perfection, despite some annoying production choices near the beginning. Almost every part of it is a hook, which is optimal for a foreign language song, and that ends up making the track sound really good to ears accustomed to Western pop music. I also like the fadeout where they repeat 'BLACKPINK in your area, yeah', all over again!

**dynamicity** (9): One of the best examples of the common split-song style popularized by EXID's Up and Down and SNSD's I Got a Boy, this song mixes dirty hip-hop/EDM verses with a polished pop chorus to create a winning sound.

**Luxaria** (9): Is Forever Young their better summer song about seizing the moment? Yes. Does this still make me dance hard? Yes. Also Lisa's rap. Yes.

**Qustomar** (9): woo my favorite blackpink song !!! i love this song but it's been difficult to listen to it after i had it on loop for 7 hours while playing the sims lmao. i think this song in particular owns bonus points, because this was the only song/era where i feel blackpink truly felt like themselves. as if it's your last is what i think blackpink should be doing, and what has suited them the most. their concepts like DDU-DU DDU-DU were more like roles the girls were trying to play, not truly them

**tapdancingpig** (9): Bright synthpop at its best. I was not ready to be so thoroughly snatched by that rap.

**three-stacks** (9): BLACKPINK's funnest and best song.

**tinnnn\_lv** (9): a bop !! so fun and bright.

**bluepupz** (8.5): Love the chorus and production! (probably because it's their most "pop" sound?)

**wugggs** (8.5): Really catchy, definitely a sound I want to hear more from them.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): ugh the verses are so good but the chorus is too cheesy

**c0ns3rvative** (8): Playing with Fire's more 80s-inspired, saccharine cousin. I could do without the moombahton kick on the verses and Lisa's rap sounds a little cheesy and underwritten considering that it's completely in English, but the instrumental build on the pre as well as the stacked vocals and twinkling samples on the mad-catchy chorus more than make up for it

**Chubiski** (8): this was the first and only BP song I heard in 2017 before I got into kpop, and only this year I noticed the moaning sounds in lisa and jisoo’s verses.

**lexarqade** (8): We love a 2NE1 leftover

**minsiii** (8): The energy is off the chain

**Neferpitta** (8): Lisa's head bob is the cutest thing ever.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): this sounds so happy

**RReg29** (8): now this is more like it…reggae verses are uninspired but that chorus is outstanding! Fun rap section and good pre-chorus builds, too

**edmiliballs** (7.5): the rap absolutely ruined this for me when it first came out but i've moved on and i can respect this for the bop it is

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This chorus feels like a weird Europop throwback, really reminds me of being in an Asian mall back in the day. Not as crazy about the rest of the song though.

**amandapearl2** (7.3): I really like this song, but I wish 2NE1 could have released it, I can hear CL and Park Bom so clearly in this song. Listening to BP is hard when you’re a blackjack. Lisa is very cute and charming in this song though.

**Banananaise** (7): at this point the 'Blackpink sound' begun to get kind of derivative tbh

**nihilistickitten** (7): really fun

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (7): AH YES THE REJECTED 2NE1 SONG. Look, there’s been 2NE1 comparisons since they debuted because hey it’s a YG girl group, there’s 4 members, harder concepts, etc. But this fucking sealed the nail in the coffin of fate. BP are/were the fucking replacement 2NE1 and what better way to show that than a song that might as well have been a 2NE1 song. Is there any official evidence? Nah but if you go back and listen to 2NE1’s work (especially the stuff from before Crush), this fits right in. I don’t wanna take away too much from BP because they do make the song work, but it’s just…. It makes me miss 2NE1. And not in a good way. I mean I still bop to the song, because it is a bop. But I just want 2NE1 back. (But then again 2NE1 was one of the groups that got me into K-Pop and Crush was one of the first albums I got)

**SirFluffyButt13** (6.2): Don't really care for this one which sucks cause I really like BLACKPINK

**bespectacled** (6): Blackpink's worst title

**maybe9** (6): good but forgettable

**ttandrew** (6): bop

**MrSwearword** (5): potential wasted on some Pitbull and/or Cascada sounding reject. iCannot, iWillnot, iRefuse, iShant

**Mudkip1** (5): oppa gangnam style

**popularsong** (4): somehow managed to be even more tired than boombayah. pls give them songs that dont sound so dated

**satanicyoona** (4): "you gonn finna catch me"

**gowestyoungkanye** (3): the fact i waited a year ish for this and it was hot garbage is ground sot sue yg right

**kappyko** (3): Not sure where the euro-pop singalong chorus came from logically, but I'm not convinced it was needed. Momentum is killed instantly and the rapping sounds out of place.

**\_xSyracuse** (0): my mamma always said if you had nothing nice to say, say nothing at all :)

**BiPolarBear17** (0): Despite not having the same ridiculous amount of unnecessary noise, you could take every single critique I could throw at Boombayah and they would all still apply here, which is an accomplishment, albeit not a positive one. You'd think considering the vast amount of time ratpink spend dungeon dwelling that they'd be able to return with quality, but alas, that's not the case.

**lilguavachan** (0): you know how people usually bash them as just a 2NE1 ripoff? this is what they mean. this is literally a 2NE1 song.

**vodkainsipido** (0): my initial comment was "3 this is fucking awful" but coming back to it, it's even worse

**selegend** (11): There's so much beauty in this work of art that it's almost indescribable to me. This was the song that got me back into K-pop after a few years of not paying attention to it. The song compares sex to an art practice, like pressing paint between sheets of paper.  It just exudes an unparalleled amount of spirituality - classy, sexy, and ethereal all at once, and this doesn't even account for how perfect their vocal delivery is. Solar's belts take me to CHURCH. Every knock and clap rips a clump of hair from my scalp.

---
**1998tweety** (11): An absolute masterpiece. The vocals on this track are incredible. The raps are amazing too. I love every single thing about this track, it just sounds so so good. The highlight though is the right into the last chorus. The pause followed by the extra instruments right before it starts really sends me there.

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): This song was a major serve. The chorus goes OFF, as do the vocals. The song is the perfect amount of feel-good, powerful, and fierce at the same time. Definitely my favorite of the rate!

**Meepmeepmusik** (11): Ugh I love Mamamoo. They can all step on me

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): What a fucking anthem. I don't even know anything they're saying and this still hypes me up for some reason. I don't even care if empowerment is what the lyrics are going for; I still love every bit of Decalcomanie. I especially love how it shows MAMAMOO's vocals, too; their performances are legendary on this track.

---
**bluepupz** (10): My favorite part is from 2:21, through Moonbyul's rap!

**jonnyd86** (10): Mamamoo at their best.. anthemic and they all sound amazing..the verses are edgy and sultry, the song really soars at the end and it's one of Moonbyul's best rapping performances. When I was new to the genre this song is one of the first songs that legitimized K-pop for me and Mamamoo showed me the breadth that the genre has to offer.

**minsiii** (10): fantastic fantastic fantastic fantastic fantastic fantasthicc

**MrSwearword** (10): shows up and shows out; slay

**original\_doll** (10): mamamoo giving great vocals as always! I love the switch-up from verse to chorus. it's kinda disjointed, but in an interesting and good way 🔥

**PostDebut** (10): That instrumental pause in the MV is fucking breathtaking (if a little on the nose with its imagery), otherwise an extremely solid pop song.

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (10): MAMAMOO IS COMING BACK FOR YOU, and so they did. I’d be lying if I didn’t say this would get my 11 if EXID and Red Velvet weren’t in the rate. This fucking song is literally one of the best kpop girl group songs of all time. First off, you having that clapping that kinda just draws you into the beat. Then that explosive chorus holy shit. I remember the first time I heard this (you know the day it released, so I know all about the whole MV controversy cause, I witnessed it.) I was blown away by that chorus. Simply, I feel good while listening to this song. Also, the rap here sends me every time. Like damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn. This song literally does not have to go this hard but it does.

**tinnnn\_lv** (10): i think it’s their best song and mv!!

**wugggs** (10): Incredible concept, impeccable delivery - vocals here are textbook and exemplary of their ability

**arrivederci1** (9.5): yyyyaaasss queens

**chainedapart** (9.5): Iconic, though the original MV was controversial.

**dynamicity** (9.5): Mamamoo's other greatest hit, this song somehow manages to have a big band feel with barely any real instruments in sight.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Oh wow these upbeat dance tracks really work for them. This does make me feel good!

**lilguavachan** (9): this sounds like the ending of a romcom... in the best way possible

**Luxaria** (9): Unf this just works so well, I really like their evolution.

**popularsong** (9): their best effort probably

**Qwilphish** (9): the Vocals JUMPED OUT

**rotating3Dtext** (9): omg

**tapdancingpig** (9): This song is delightful. It goes from bluesy to boppy, and I can’t fault it for that at all.

**Kromorei** (8.5): Bop.

**Hyperion2589** (8): Hated that the chrous and bridge completely overpowered the verses. Vocally brilliant though.

**maybe9** (8): its just cool, wish it had a better chorus tho

**Neferpitta** (8): I aspire to be a basic white guy love interest in a kpop MV one day.

**nihilistickitten** (8): a wild ride

**Nixon4Prez** (8): Still has a retro feel but it doesn’t stifle the song

**kappyko** (7.5): bonus points for best title in rate

**RReg29** (7): good stuff

**amandapearl2** (6.9): The chorus is great, really uplifting and catchy, but the chorus has a weird disconnect from the rest of the song.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): another one that suffered from being overhyped

**modotrising** (4): Everyone loves this song but me apparently. I just never got into it. Vocals are still on point though

**gowestyoungkanye** (2): i cannot get over the fact that this video is so rape-y and the song really just isn’t good

**ttandrew** (2): fine

**Overall average**: 7.069 **// Total points:** 1131.086

**1998tweety** (9.429): A vocal group if I've ever see one. The thing I love so much about this group is how much they standout compared to the rest of the kpop landsacpe. Don't get me wrong, they still make catchy tunes with mainstream appeal, but it always feels like they're going about it in a different on, putting their own unique spin on it. Their jazzy sound is a breath of fresh air in both the super bubble-gummy kpop space and the hip-hop dominated western scene. 

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.071): MAMAMOO is definitely my favorite group included in this rate. They utilize their jazz and soul influences very well, and the girls also have the vocals needed to top absolutely fantastic songs like Piano Man off. I might just check out a few more songs from their discography... 

**You_Will_Die** (8.643): Great voices that are really easy to differentiate, all four has their own speciality which creates great harmonies. Broad spectrum of song types as well. 

**ResIsByTheBatphone** (8.143): Oh MAMAMOO how I love thee. I mean it, they crank out bangers quite often. Seriously tho, their vocals are incredible. Especially live (check out the MAMAs performance from this year). Also, all of the girls bring a little something different to the table and it makes for a fun time. Also, someone tell Moonbyul I fucking love her. 

**franch** (7.986): delivers solid bops 

**bluepupz** (7.714): While I like their retro-sounding songs from earlier in their career, I find that I enjoy their recent songs like Egotistic or Wind Flower more. In general I love their voices and harmonies 

**Chubiski** (6.429): I respect their musicality but their genre really isn’t for me 

**modotrising** (5.786): I LOVE them as performers, but some of their older point songs felt too basic for me. Like they relied too much on perfect vocals to pull them off. Which is fine because they DO, but if on top of god tier vocals they had more complex music I'd love their point songs a lot more. They've fixed that this year imo. Their bsides don't suffer from this at all though, in general. Melting is fantastic. 

**onceberry** (3.286): Do blackface once shame on you, do blackface twice you can't get streamed again! I feel like they definitely smell bad :/

You_Will_Die: Basically the two groups I listen to are the two first to go out lol. Third is EXID which only has two left. So be scared if I ranked a song high, it means it will go out.

bespectacIed: Surprisingly good rate so far? I love that this sub is apparently full of reveluvs and orbits lol. Sumn predictable will win (probably TT or likey) but I'm still holding out for Bad Boy aka the best K-pop song of 2018 according to Billboard.

QustoMar: i think Girl Front is a cute girl but if an OEC track should win, it’s the marvelous Sweet Crazy Love

Luxaria: What is Love is better than both TT and Likey so let's hope that happens.

Bad Boy to win it though, I'll be mad if my 11 goes out anywhere below 1.

AroMorbid: Some of you have an unhealthy hate for Blackpink. It’s one thing to give them your zeros and it’s another to insult the girls and call them names. Stan culture man 🤷🏻‍♂️ 

Anyway, happy they made it to day 3 even if at this rate PWF will be out at #15

MisterrAlex: Some people hate Blackpink out of fandom for 2NE1 which sucks because they hate the girls because of YG mainly
