I think one of my only major problems with this album is how on the nose the lyrics are sometimes.. and I think that is entirely intentional since Kilo is a very kitschy artist I just think it doesn't quite work for me. Musically though,... yeah I see why I was so obsessed with this album goddamn

---

### a man after midnight

**Ambrosia42** (10): the throbbing production omg GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME. American consumerism and such

**cremeebrulee** (10): gimme gimme gimme

**plastichaxan** (10): Something about girls saying the word gimme so much in a song just makes it such a 10

**seanderlust** (10): this was one of my favorite songs in 2022. it's just such a banger from the instrumental to the verses to the gimmegimmegimmegimmegimme. were it not for [REDACTED SONG] that grew on me over the course of this rate this would be my 11

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): gimmegimmegimmegimmegimmegimmegimme

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): this could be a 10, but I'm not the biggest fan of the gimme gimme gimme

**lexiaredery** (9.5): gimme gimme gimme gimme more please

**JIRACHI** (9): gimmegimmegimmegimmegimmegimmegimmegimme HA HA HA HA

**Nagisoid** (8): Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Taste)

**moonagenightmares** (6): i think most of the song i meh but i love the gimme part

### lol

**welcome2thejam** (10): Love the weird attempt at a snooty laugh

**imbaby122** (9.5): everything about this song is genius but ha ha ha ha! is on another level. it‚Äôs camp. it‚Äôs threatening. it‚Äôs silly. it‚Äôs just so good.

**afs** (8): ha ha ha ha

### still in perfect condition

**beeozan** (10): this chorus reminds me of something that I really like but I can't put my finger on it cuz the slay is too distracting

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): We‚Äôre the ones being spoiled rotten by all the bops on this album (and in this rate)!

**CallMeIsmail\_** (10): incredible hook

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this cuntalicious crack-infused banger

**Mandeemoo007** (10): This beat reminds me of the stuff she was on on Big Fish Theory, but fully going all electronic, with the static and other noises, love it.

**popularsong** (10): "i aint shit but i can pay to fix it so exciting to be in the shop of my fantasy" part contrasted with the rest of the song showing how hungry everyone else is for that freedom of creation is so good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i want to be her

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song captures everything I love Kilo, there's a playful sugary darkness to her that is just so indulgent and fun

**runaway3212** (10): finally some relatable content

**Stryxen** (10): this song is the best on the album conceptually I think, it's where I started really getting into the very dense themes and such. And it slays a bit like yass vogue boots

**UselessTacooo** (10): she‚Äôs so unserious I love her

**phonethephoenix** (9.2): sooo catchy

**impla77** (9): oh me oh my

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): This goes absolutely HARD with good speakers/subwoofers, cuz the sub bass on this is absolutely WILD

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): its songs like this that make me worried that there's a finite amount of musical hooks in the world and that someday we‚Äôll run out, and i‚Äôm just shocked that anyone would have the absolute audacity to use so many of them in one song

**vayyiqra** (9): She was so real for making a third part as a followup to two interludes from her album from 2016, "Larks' Tongues in Aspic" shit üç¶

**vexastrae** (9): vince staples always broke again

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): So many of her cadence choices on this record just hit the spot for me. Like, so many "that's the ticket" moments

**DirtyRat583** (8.5): this song is pure power walk

**qazz23** (8): a good bassy sound with some squeaky synths

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): oh the animation meme community would eat this song up like CRACK

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): US Bank, why

**prettybirbkotori** (7.5): one of the noises in this made me pause and make sure my computer hadnt just short-circuited

**WaneClubtoc** (7.5): WE NEED TO GET HER OUT OF THE WINDOWS 95 ARCADE VISUALIZER WE GOTTA HELP KILO KISH!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): cardi b voice: money

**Uberpigeon** (7): an acceptable entry into the cheeky give me money type of girl songs

### out of date

**shipperondeck** (6.9): honestly it's mainly the vocal performance here that weakens the song

**oh\_crow** (6.5): Appreciate the cunt serving of it all, really reminds me of Vince Staple's Big Fish Theory that Kilo heavily features and sounds immaculate on

**xophrys** (4.9): the tupperware of pasta went mouldy while I was away

**bogo** (4): spoiled little brat outsold

Idk who Justin is but he ate here. I think I'd have liked if the album leaned into this sound more in general, but very pleasantly surprised w this making day 3!

---

### [do mouseketeers](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/14p1yf5/the_mouseketeers_rate_britney_spearschristina/)

**Nagisoid** (10): When Justin Timberlake gets OUTSIDE of the Mouseketeers rate before top 5 :naur:

**throwaway-7650** (10): the future mousketeers top 2/3/etc.:

**WaneClubtoc** (7.4): justin timberlake get back in those woods

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): justin who? timberlake? OMG DO MOUSEKEETERS RATE YASSSSS

### the consensus seems to be "i forget abt this but it slays"

**kindalikeyervajoina** (11): i listened to this album the most prior to this rate so most of its songs didn't hold up; not this one though, this just hits every time.

**plastichaxan** (11): This scratches such a specific part of my brain I can‚Äôt explain it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I‚Äôve said this before in rate comments but sometimes there‚Äôs a song on an album that I continually forget exists but is also a megaslay. So it‚Äôs like a little surprise treat every time I listen to the album. This is that song.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is just a smasha i dont even have a funny comment about it

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): WOWOWOWOOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOOW

**imbaby122** (10): i just don‚Äôt have words for how good these songs are. the harmonies in the chorus, the post-chorus, the instrumental bridge and the drop off before the percussion is added back in, and the percussion in general are particularly special. but literally everything is perfect.

**moonagenightmares** (10): the last minute is so godtier

**runaway3212** (10): but like wow what a moment

**Stryxen** (10): the ethereal dnb is so good impossible princess why do you have to be unrateable

**UselessTacooo** (10): i don‚Äôt know how organs fit into this arcade game world but I don‚Äôt care!

**welcome2thejam** (10): In space everybody can hear you scream this chorus

**Ambrosia42** (9.2): I‚Äôm not sure exactly what this song is about, but it seems to me like she is caught in a dream in the middle of some sort of disaster. She wishes to connect with someone outside of the dream, but she cannot, and she can‚Äôt right the ship to avert the coming crash because she is stuck in the dream. I think this could relate to a lot of American societal issues. It also has some of that same chaos that other songs here make me feel.

**qazz23** (9): love the percussion in this, also the screeching synths near the end

**impla77** (8.6): shuttlecraft in Star Trek (they inevitably crash)

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8.5): It's cool I guess

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): i kinda forget about this song a little bit but it is really good

**flava** (8): clipping could never

**prettybirbkotori** (8): oh the serve that is that outro

**vexastrae** (7.5): me when i lose my sense of spatial direction

**phonethephoenix** (7): a good song but not as strong as some others on the album

**sarcasticsobs** (7): I liked the percussion

### who the fuck is justin?

**freeofblasphemy** (10): YES! Absolutely everything this album does well at once. Pounding beats, yearning yet commanding vocals, unpredictable trajectory. Whoever Justin is (Bieber? Theroux?) they should be proud to have such a banger named for them

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Long? Vernon? Bieber? Timberlake?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): justin slayed

**ReallyCreative** (10): Justin snapped idk

**afs** (8.5): i need to see this justin

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): who is justin

**uiscebeathaoir** (8): okay by this point in the album i‚Äôve given up being confused by the song titles

### oh ://///

**vayyiqra** (9): Finding out Justin was her best friend who died before this album was released was so sad üç¶

The feature on this song adds so much to the atmosphere like their voice paired with Kilo's really makes the song that much more intense and fun. But I did not know this was a fan fave enough to make day 3 or be her third highest song I'm ngl

### real

**Stryxen** (10): EJJKEKEJJEJEJEHJWUUEHEBRBFSJAKJ;;&#&#(#)#*@;@8![√ó*;√ó;√ó&√ó&√∑,#&#:#:;@*]0][/>/<√∑&;√ó,??' !!!!!!!!!!!!! I BEEN RUNNIN RUNNIN RUNNIN I AINT SLEPT IN WEEKS

### brokeback mountain

**beeozan** (10): this is the biggest beat eva, the prodigy are shaking in their boots

**indie\_fan\_** (10): someone needs to make a cowboy bebop amv with this song as the soundtrack

**Mandeemoo007** (10): I love Jean Dawson so I am glad this is such a fun track

**moonagenightmares** (10): this was my favorite song from the album on first listen. the chorus is insane

**nt96** (10): This is Lola Rennt-core

**plastichaxan** (10): This song just gives me that buzz only hot girls will get it

**popularsong** (10): this was one of the first songs i heard and loved on this, the combo of jean dawson's sound and the electronic inspirations of the album are just so crazy arghhh

**ReallyCreative** (10): the genrefluidity serve

**shipperondeck** (10): i didnt know who jean dawson was before this song (i am now well educated) but a joint slay definitely occured here

**Uberpigeon** (10): this is the song that plays when the heroine goes to the club and takes a weird pill

**WaneClubtoc** (10): wow everyone is putting breakbeats underneath this stuff and it works.

**welcome2thejam** (10): That really fast moving dancing cat emote but it's wearing a cowboy hat

**Ambrosia42** (9.8): Some kinda drum n bass production with emotional strings and it just feels like this chaotic moment. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what it‚Äôs all about, but the title and lyrics remind me of the fast-paced rat race of American society and wrangling all the choices we have to make every day

**CallMeIsmail\_** (9.5): Great feature

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.2): chaotic in the best way possible

**CrimsonROSET** (9): 4aem for people who naruto run

**qazz23** (9): love the breakbeat and layered vocals

**vexastrae** (9): DRIVER STOP! I HEAR DRUM AND BASS

**thedoctordances1940** (8.7): never quite seen this as a standout on the album like so many others have but like it's still great

**imbaby122** (8.5): this song makes me feel genuinely uneasy and anxious which is so incredible because music rarely makes me feel that way. and it totally works with the theme of constant grinding with no sleeping and no end in sight.

**Nagisoid** (8.5): Palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, mom's spaghetti?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): this is such a mess (affectionate)

**sarcasticsobs** (8.3): 2-steppin' in my room rn

**UselessTacooo** (8.2): I‚Äôm starting to realize none of the lyrics going on make any sense she‚Äôs in her THIQUE bag

**oh\_crow** (8): Every song on this album reminds me of a pre-existing song but I can never remember the song in question. Anyway feel like she was in her Bri'ish Gurl era here

**TiltControls** (8): maybe it's just cause I'm listening to this coming off the anime rate, but why do the drums sound like they were taken right out of the Yu-Gi-Oh intro

**vayyiqra** (8): She said this album was influenced by Outkast and I hear it on this track because this sounds like what I would think "Bombs Over Baghdad" must sound like on a bad acid trip üç¶

**phonethephoenix** (7.9): like the runnin bit!

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): hmmm i wonder what king will possibly play as an interlude for this *(king note: kindly die hypno)*

**lexiaredery** (7.5): I like the backing vocals

### choices cowboy

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): I mean, the D&B/breakbeat elements are cool but I dunno about that chanting mess of a hook‚Ä¶

**JIRACHI** (6): she really didn't have to repeat the same thing three times...

**runaway3212** (6): choices for sure

**prettybirbkotori** (5.5): not crazy about this one

**uiscebeathaoir** (2): seriously considered zeroing this cause of how annoying i find the chorus but the rest of the song's fine and i just couldn't bring myself to actually do it

### country rate

**flava** (11): OKAYYYY

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The people want the fucking yeehaw rate! I want it! You want it! Kilo wants it!

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this isn't country it's cuntry

This song evokes something disgusting in me, just the beat when it drops does things to me. WOKE UP FEELING LIKE A SLUT YEAH I LIKE THAT it's such a banger, the song feels complete and yet it's barely two minutes long!?!? Which leads to a lot of plays. This deserved top 10 but I'll celebrate a day 3 finish!! I will be resisting sending this to All Stars for the rest of the year

---

### giggle

**akanewasright** (10): chanting ‚ÄúWOKE UP FEELIN LIKE A SLUT YEA I LIKE THAT‚Äù at the Philly Shygirl show was a life affirming moment for me

**cremeebrulee** (10): akane voice: WHORE MUSIC OMFGG

### WOKE UP FEELING LIKE A SLUT YEAH I LIKE THAT

**Ambrosia42** (10): THE SMASH omg this song is such a bop. She seems to feel empowered by her sexual encounters and she is proud of her sexual prowess and her charm, but she also seems to desire some intimacy that isn‚Äôt as fleeting, wanting the lover to stay so she isn‚Äôt alone. A very relatable vibe

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): It won‚Äôt win the actual rate but it definitely wins the ‚Äúmost fun song title to say‚Äù award.

**bogo** (10): now this is a grade a horny banger

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): classic Shygirl. Great chorus

**Frajer** (10): more people should be horny on main with a british accent

**JIRACHI** (10): i should call him

**lexiaredery** (10): Amazing

**popularsong** (10): the contrast between the melancholic hook and the faux-confident verses are sooo good ugh this albums 11 candidate

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Sometimes I wonder what my parents would think about some of the music I listen to

**shipperondeck** (10): the chorus is just mwah

**WaneClubtoc** (10): she fetched the trap cutters and saved america

**xophrys** (9.9): I thought she said something about Mordor but it was just something about being mauled and adored like so true

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): why she shlurinng her speech

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): Sevadliza saved this song fr

**impla77** (9.3): i didn‚Äôt become a little bit of a shlut, i became a TOTAL SHLUT

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I‚Äôm a shlut like you

**Mandeemoo007** (9): I love how innocent it sounds and then gets so dirty, funny story my friend was like wow this is a great at the intro and then the chorus came and he was like oh, oh, OH, haha

**prettybirbkotori** (9): try not to say mother challenge FAILED

**qazz23** (9): good vocal delivery, also like the use of guitar here

**vexastrae** (9): she did not lie this song is for the sluts!

**phonethephoenix** (8.8): hot!!!

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8.7): Very good but could have gone harder

**imbaby122** (8.5): bde but shygirl is feeling a little shy üôà a little timid even.

**Stryxen** (8.5): how did she make this and sudan still has the most audacious horny slut anthem in the rate

**bigbigbee** (8): yup! ‚Äúshlut‚Äù is going into my permanent lexicon.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): get at me in the comments but i like the first 30 seconds than the rest of the song

**Nagisoid** (8): Is sex therapy just death by Snu Snu or what

**oscarbrierley1** (8): woke up feeling like a slut is such a banger of a verse opener

**vayyiqra** (8): üò≥ ü¶ã

**afs** (7.5): very disappointed she didnt say shlut once (slut does not count)

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): A nice lil sex-positive bop. Prefer the remix though

**oh\_crow** (7.5): I only wake up feeling deeply tired and dehydrated pls dont flex on me like this shy

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Me waking up at 6:15 a.m. for work to this song with my oily hair plastered to my face and stank hot morning breath

### honestly ill celebrate that this got no negative comments only mid ones!

**DaHumanTorch** (7): the verses on this are SOOOO good but the chorus just refuses to fully click with me

**runaway3212** (7): she's just like me fr

**beeozan** (6): im totally ambivalent to this song

**welcome2thejam** (6): This song title is an umlaut away from being sold in an Ikea

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): why does this sound like a lil nas x song

This did so well! Idk why I didn't expect it to, but it was day 3 for the entire rate and even winning for a little early on. Unforunately all I can think about when I hear this song is how my boyfriend thought the second line where she says "just leave a shell" was "just lea michele"

### WE ARENT ON DISCORD THIS IS REDDIT YOU NERDS!!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): :woeis~1:

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): woe isn‚Äôt me

**seanderlust** (9.5): :woeis:

**impla77** (8.8): is

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): Woeis

### incredible song, very gender

**CallMeIsmail\_** (11): Incredible song, very gender,  shame about the rest of the album

**cremeebrulee** (11): idk how to explain why i like this other than it‚Äôs like music to time travel to

**akanewasright** (10): masterpiece, best song ever made

**Ambrosia42** (10): The bass here is just delicious and i like how it shifts a bit in the middle. The song seems to be about her gripping with fame and the things people want from her, and then when it shifts it turns into HER wanting something from a lover, and in either situation she is wondering, do you see it from my side? It‚Äôs just a gorgeous and gripping song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): ‚ÄúYou just love to hate, yeah, you do it so well‚Äù she‚Äôs looking the tankers directly in the coochie here.

**bogo** (10): this is so gorgeous it's heavenly

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): love how disjointed this sounds

**JIRACHI** (10): woe more like WHORE

**oh\_crow** (10): The atmospheric synth pads, the vocal chops, the gravitas of her voice, that silky smooth chorus, the pitched low rapper shy with the beat switch, the growl?? I didn't make it out alive

**plastichaxan** (10): The Bj√∂rk remix makes so much sense I fear for this one knowing popheads relationship with Bj√∂rk

**qazz23** (10): love the smooth sound of this, and a nice beat switch

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I feel cross-faded (complimentary)

**shipperondeck** (10): perfect representation of fuck it we club after heartbreak

**xophrys** (10): Shygirl is Cate Blanchett approved.

**moonagenightmares** (9.7): amazing opening

**imbaby122** (9.5): so quintessential shygirl. first and foremost, horny. but also the effortless combination of rnb, club, and hyperpop sounds. and the cunty rap verse. a fantastic album opener.

**lexiaredery** (9.5): absolute bop

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): mark lee:

**DirtyRat583** (9.1): beat dropped and i went okayyy

**Nagisoid** (9): Not the goose scream jumpscare in the beginning

**prettybirbkotori** (9): her sound is just so effortlessly cool

**UselessTacooo** (9): ouuuuu that breakdown is so good

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): one of my favorite scrabble words

**WaneClubtoc** (8.6): woof

**afs** (8.5): woaaaaaaaaaah

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): Excellent opener. The beat switch is very off-putting at first but obviously you get used to it on repeat listens.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): lavender town type beat

**phonethephoenix** (8): ohhh love this production

**Stryxen** (8): Woah! We needed the bjork version tho we needed the giggle

**vayyiqra** (8): We're off to a good start with this moody stuff ü¶ã

**vexastrae** (8): https://i.imgflip.com/4v58v5.jpg

**welcome2thejam** (8): This song is such a trip I'm just staring up at the light from my bed and i stg it's moving across the ceiling

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.8): i thought this rate is for girlbosses only why is there a man here..

**freeofblasphemy** (7): A good headphones test of a track. Audacious to open with but wish it felt like she was more of a factor. How about some screaming???

**Mandeemoo007** (7): I like the switch up in the middle, love Shy‚Äôs choruses, always so ethereal!

### yeah you love to hate... you do it so well

**uiscebeathaoir** (6.5): i really like the switchup half way through but she should have switched up MORE

**popularsong** (6): i really like the "when will you see it from my side? i can have it all, but i'm never satisfied" part but sadly not as much for the rest of the song

**runaway3212** (4): Sorry I really dont care for this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): woe‚Ä¶this song is not good

### i did not know this :thots:

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Apparently according to Wikipedia this samples Bunny is a Rider, which I find absolutely hilarious cause like‚Ä¶ The time between Bunny coming out and the actual album being released was so long that people just started sampling it in between??

This was always one of my favourites even before the remix but seeing everyone else fall in love with it with the Tinashe remix was so fun. Their voices go together so beautifully and this is the caprimami x alt club solidarity we deserve

---

### hypno listens to pasadena ONE time on call with you and suddenly he's a tinashe stan smh

**RandomHypnotica** (11): tinashe fits so perfectly on here it‚Äôs a wonder she wasn‚Äôt on it in the first place

### that moment when you, a queen, come across ano-[GUNSHOTS]

**1998tweety** (11): congrats Tinashe on your rate win

**phonethephoenix** (11): lovely!! great vocals and beat

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): ‚ÄúAll I do is look at you‚Äù - kids these days to their damn ephones and Nintendo Witches amirite??

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): hi tinashe

**JIRACHI** (10): Tinashe my robbed poor little meow meow i will never forget what they did to you in Caprimami333

**kindalikeyervajoina** (10): i gave my 11 based on personal preference but i have to admit this is the best song on the list.

**lexiaredery** (10): The solo version is an easy 10. The Tinashe version is good but I'm not sure she really adds anything

**Mandeemoo007** (10): I literally just want this song to be longer, so ethereal and fun.

**notarobot3675** (10): although I will admit while the remix is fab I prefer the OG

**plastichaxan** (10): Tinashe being in the best rates this year feels correct

**qazz23** (10): love the Tinashe feature

**ReallyCreative** (10): joint slay

**runaway3212** (10): This mega bop

**shipperondeck** (10): sooo pretty and tinashe was the perfect choice for a feature

**Stryxen** (10): they sound so twinkly and girlypop and LOL xD

**vexastrae** (10): this and boys a liar part 2 are literally twins like

**WaneClubtoc** (10): OMG TINASHE I LOVE YOUR ALT CLUB GIRL BANGERS ON 333!!!!

**akanewasright** (9.9): I‚Äôm gonna be real, it took Tinashe being put on the song to make it click for me. But my god is it one of my favorites now

**xophrys** (9.8): Okay rant: so I do think it is better with Tinashe just because her vocals are so much softer than Shygirl's who's has much more of a snap and impact when she performs ( I'm autistic )

**Ambrosia42** (9.7): Tinashe was a nice addition and the melody often gets stuck in my head. Their voices sound gorgeous over the glittery production even though the song is about limerence and unrequited feelings

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Tinashe must have magic in her fingers that makes any pop project better

**oh\_crow** (9.5): But you know what? The original is a 10 maybe an 11 I had that on repeat. That being said Tinashe sounds so lovely on this and her verse is excellent

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): 2:18 long? Oh, you absolute cowards, you're sick

**imbaby122** (9): oh my god the harmonies and vocals from tinashe elevate this song to a whole other level. i wish it was longer so it had more time to build on that atmospheric vibe.

**Nagisoid** (9): Why are these songs grindcore EP lengths

**oscarbrierley1** (9): the remix convinced me that i didnt like the album because of shygirls voice, tinashe just elevates the song so much

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): As someone who really enjoyed both 333 and Nymph, seeing these girls do a song together is a match made in‚Ä¶ Well, heaven.

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): i did not know there was a Tinashe remix, WHY didnt i know there was a Tinashe remix

**vayyiqra** (9): cute ü¶ã

**cremeebrulee** (8.3): oh tinashe almost undo‚Äôd this video huh..

**impla77** (8.2): pinkpantheress type collab length

**CrimsonROSET** (8): tinashe you‚Äôll win a rate eventually i promise

**DaHumanTorch** (8): tinashe elevated this song so much

**freeofblasphemy** (8): Bit of an unfortunate side effect of chemistry as good as Shygirl and Tinashe‚Äôs is that they can kind of blend together if you‚Äôre not paying attention. That‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm critiquing this mostly excellent song for being too harmonious

**popularsong** (8): i like the version without nashe a bit more ngl but same score either way

**bogo** (7.5): rating the solo version cause i'm too lazy to pull up the remix but it doesn't really matter because i'd give both the same score

**UselessTacooo** (7.2): you know what tinashe you get a pass

**afs** (7): tinashe let down

**beeozan** (7): oh Tinashe kinda served on this song

**flava** (7): rating the tinasheless version cause it is better

**IIIHenryIII** (7): now we just need a Rosal√≠a collab

**prettybirbkotori** (7): how is this shorter than the original?? give me more nashe!!!

### hell

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.7): boring

**kappyko** (6): This is so Frutiger Aero idfk what aesthetic are the kids talking about these days

**welcome2thejam** (6): Sounds nice but expected better out of this teamup

**thedoctordances1940** (5.7): i have no thoughts on this this is one of the most this exists songs of all time

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): I HATE THE TIKTOKIFICATION OF MUSIC!!! STOP MAKING SONGS THAT ARE LESS THAN 3 MINUTES LONG

**Uberpigeon** (5): baby booboo nursery rhyme sounding ass song. right after coochie too. ENOUGH!

Cleo is a song I think I like the idea of more than I ever actually liked it. And don't get me wrong I do like it, but in a rate where I truly love almost every song I really need to nitpick and I think I just always enjoyed the idea of "orchestric club old hollywood shygirl banger" more than I ever specifically enjoyed Cleo. Like don't get me wrong it goes hard... but so does the rest of her discog, and I prefer most of that. This sat quite comfortably in the top 10 for most of the rate, but never surpassed Firefly

---

### soooooooooooooo true

**moonagenightmares** (9.6): amazing closing

**vayyiqra** (9): Good closer ! ü¶ã

### orchussy (orchestra pussy not orca pussy)

**indie\_fan\_** (11): that violin intro + the last minute or so >>>

**oscarbrierley1** (11): feel kinda bad that she felt artistically limited during this era, but the song is such a banger. release the cleo era album now pls

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): Fuck me, this song is so luscious! The string arrangements are so plentiful, the way she manages to combine that with elements of house really tickles a special bone in my body. Great song.

**throwaway-7650** (11): throwback to me alternating between pink friday songs and this while I was doing that rate and using cleo as a ear cleanse between the skips

### LIGHTS ‚ú® CAMERA üì∑ ACTION üé¨

**1998tweety** (10): oh now this BOPS

**bogo** (10): this is the sexy dance song we all needed

**CrimsonROSET** (10): cleopatra- coming at ya- we dont have the rights we

**DirtyRat583** (10): i feel no shame listening to the edit. why would i want 40 seconds of violin? like pleek GET ME TO THE GOOD BIT!!

**flava** (10): ok but wasnt this even on the deluxe edition

**imbaby122** (10): call me CLEAUUURRRR (h2o reference). strings and club music are really a perfect duo. this song blows me away every time i hear it.

**JIRACHI** (10): this is the definition of a club BANGER

**Mandeemoo007** (10): sounds like Swish swish and candy had a baby

**nt96** (10): https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRr9UVg0eFZOEZ_1iZmJv8DoM24XDVZBngsiX5i_4afcPJntGxXEEpTaYn9hcR_OzxfBFs&usqp=CAU

**phonethephoenix** (10): oh the vibes are so good. lush and a bop

**plastichaxan** (10): Need someone to make me feel like this fr

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this was a really nice transition between her ALIAS sound and this album

**ReallyCreative** (10): Possibly my favorite song from this era, Shygirl really does well with the cinematic strings, and it's a wonderful showcase of her versatility. I understand why it wasn't on the album, but it's such a great song

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Oh lord

**shipperondeck** (10): been floating to this for like uhhh a yr now

**Uberpigeon** (10): LIGHTS CAMERA ACTION! GIVE ME THE SATISFACTION

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): i had not checked this song out before the rate and holy shit i should have. Shygirl with strings is so insane but so perfect and the outro where the beat and strings overlap is just so fucking incredible. If any Shygirl song wins i hope its this one

**UselessTacooo** (10): ngl the live at abbey road version is one of my most played songs ever

**welcome2thejam** (10): Oh wouldn't be surprised if we got another loosie victory on our hands. Uses that general house music sound and does an incredible job at it

**xophrys** (10): All I'm imagining is something refereeing to Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra as Cleo but like they do in H20 Just add water. Cleeoooo

**Ambrosia42** (9.6): It‚Äôs so cinematic at the beginning (mirroring the lyrics of the song) and then morphs into this cunty house song. Quite delectable

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): she came to fuck bitch..

**Nagisoid** (9.5): Shygirl can do Beethoven but Beethoven can't do Firefly

**WaneClubtoc** (9.4): lil less massive but rips

**akanewasright** (9): LIGHTS CAMERA ACTION üì∏

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): *Call me Ne-Yo, dressed in fedora. You can watch me come right at Yeah! I‚Äôm the winner of the rate.* This is so dumb I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶.

**Frajer** (9): all eyes on me the center of the ring just like a circus

**qazz23** (9): love the orchestral sound that leading to the bassy part

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): the orchestral diva house

### negative comments with an 8.5 score.... this rate is ACCLAIMED!!!!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): its a good song but it mostly just makes me want to listen to renaissance instead

**vexastrae** (8.5): IM A STAR ...... PLEASE IM A STAAAARRRRRR

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8.4): Mostly good but I'm not sure about the strings

**slimboyfriend** (8.2): come on teletubby teleport us to Chromatica!!

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): who said you‚Äôre supposed to go to church on Sundays

**impla77** (7.4): the instrumentation is nice, everything else falls a bit flat

**afs** (7): not sure it works together

**lexiaredery** (7): It's good but I've never really been a huge fan of this song

**prettybirbkotori** (7): i like this mellower direction for her but i do wish there was more to it

**runaway3212** (6): this is like fine

**Poydoo** (5.9): super generic drop

**freeofblasphemy** (5.5): Not very moved by this!

### u/buddhacharm get him!

**buddhacharm** (0): this song is kind of if you ChatGPT'd a house song with the worst vocals that Shy could offer

This has grown off me slightly by virtue of it being *the* song from the album, but it really is a smasha. It sets up the lyrical themes of the album perfectly being about identity and consumerism! We weren't rating the intro track but I love how it leads off of that too, just overall such a strong lead. I was surprised when this didn't end as the highest track but it still performed very well

---

### you be my american gurl.... american gurl

**IIIHenryIII** (11): Bonnie McKee is shaking

**imbaby122** (11): one of the most satisfying catchy melodies in all of pop music while still having insightful and intriguing lyrics. insane genius synth line. groovy baseline that keeps the energy going throughout the song. percussion (especially the drum line snare in the second verse) goes crazy. the bridge is ominous and ethereal and adds so much complexity to the song. the adlibs in the last chorus add so much to an already stellar melody (baby baby baby baby), i always have to sing them. and the outro. oh my god the outro.

**lexiaredery** (11): I can't get enough of this

**pheromenos** (11): no thoughts just good vibes

**Poydoo** (11): PLAY is also an 11 btw

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**Ambrosia42** (10): It really sets up the album and its themes quite beautifully. I love the melodies and lyrics and production. It‚Äôs a banger. I also have to mention that I love the arcade intro before this and the related outro

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I feel like this is most likely going to be Kilo‚Äôs highest song and I don‚Äôt know if I agree with that but also it‚Äôs perfect, flawless, and should win with a 12 average.

**cremeebrulee** (10): she is going to deliver on the american girl movie that‚Äôll come out a year from now

**JIRACHI** (10): when you serve cunt in an American way:

**phonethephoenix** (10): great lyricslly and a banger!

**plastichaxan** (10): I was so gagged and I‚Äôd heard the masterpiece that is REDUX like

**popularsong** (10): both it and nbpq are a masterclass in title tracks

**RandomHypnotica** (10): good news there are about 160 million of them

**ReallyCreative** (10): (in the cadence of MATERIAL GURL) AMERICAN GURL

**Stryxen** (10): girlypop horror coded even more than bloody future and pearl combined sorry

**throwaway-7650** (10): barbie is in theaters tmrw give it up for barbie you guys!

**UselessTacooo** (10): I‚Äôve never heard a song that makes me want to get up and scream as much as this

**vayyiqra** (10): One of the catchiest ditties she has ever written, I love the contrast between the cheerful sound of it and the serious themes in the lyrics üç¶

**WaneClubtoc** (10): OOOOKAAAAAAYYY LETTTSSSSS PLAY

**welcome2thejam** (10): Never been prouder of my country than when I'm repped by MY American Gurl

**notarobot3675** (9.9): this song was my life for awhile lmao

**Nagisoid** (9.5): The girl gamer representation we didn't know we needed

**CrimsonROSET** (9): no material girl reference docks it a point

**DaHumanTorch** (9): even obama's intern was gagging

**qazz23** (9): catchy chorus, love the background synths; a nice dreamy sound on the bridge too

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Spinnin' around in my desk chair and pumpin' my fists rn

**Uberpigeon** (9): ohh like the dolls

**uiscebeathaoir** (9): the last half‚Äôs a 10 no doubt, but the synthline‚Äôs overwhelming prominence in the first minute always kinda grates on me

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): H*rry jumpscare synths

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8.7): ngl I feel like this is a bit of a weak opening

**flava** (8.5): ok smasha alert

**vexastrae** (8.5): and when this song plays in the barbie movie bc barbie wants to find a lesbian partner :yass:

**afs** (8): gurllll

**freeofblasphemy** (8): New national anthem

**Mandeemoo007** (8): Nice intro to the album

**oh\_crow** (8): The instrumental is so claustrophobic it kinda swallows her voice, but that works with the message of the song and I really love the sound of this

**prettybirbkotori** (8): who else yassed

**runaway3212** (8): a bangerette

**seanderlust** (8): bonnie mckee outsold but this is great too

### darj's ballot was so positive and gave this a 3 and tanked it from 5th to 9th and it took me out 

**kappyko** (7): this still isn't incredibly catchy 2 me but it's a bop!!!

**bogo** (5): something about this just sounds flat to me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): not crazy about the vocals here

### ive heard so many other people who thought this why is there mass hysteria around kilo kish being a brit

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): ok so i was gonna leave a comment on here that said something like ‚Äúwhy is she calling herself an american girl when she‚Äôs british :/‚Äú but i looked it up on wikipedia and she actually is american?? why did i think she was british all this time what is it about kilo kish that makes her british coded in my mind

I remember the tectonic plates shifting when she performed this live, I saw her at the signing at Rough Trade in London the week before the album dropped and when this began.... oh I MOVED, physically. So so happy this made day 3 and comfortably as well, it barely left the top 10! We want a video Brittney

---

### freak freak freak nasty 

**Ambrosia42** (11): This one is so smooth and it feels like a love song about someone, but maybe some things aren‚Äôt actually going so great, but you just keep ignoring it because you‚Äôre so in love. It‚Äôs so sexy and sleek and I just love this song so much. It‚Äôs such a vibe and really takes me somewhere.

**UselessTacooo** (10): I have nothing to say besides LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**WaneClubtoc** (10): we are 14 cuts proper deep into da album and we get an electro tinged intro. #thankyousudanarchives. how did you know that I was having an electro summer? the rest of the cut is not rlly electro except in the choruses, but she really did throw me a bone. we gotta give this to breakdancers.

**Nagisoid** (9.9): Motherquake measuring 9.9 on the Freakalizer scale

**CallMeIsmail\_** (9.5): This is such a soothing song and the keys are entrancing

Kilo exceeded expectations here, I think many people saw her repeatedly as the lowest album in the echo chamber and thought she was toast but she always had solid scores from the majority! Even if she is going out the earliest she put up a good fight and this was a pretty tight three horse race album wise for sure. As for this specific song... I kind of wish it wasn't her highest, there's a point where all the crashing synth songs on this album sound the same to me and this is one of them I fear!! But she's still cute, I just wish there was more variety

---

### pour one out for kilo... and she still makes the top 100 album avgs lmfao

**akanewasright** (10): The best song ever made it‚Äôs true

**flava** (10): oh she came into this bitch with the intent of making the catchiest fucking song ever

**imbaby122** (10): healing my father issues one banger tune at a time. seriously that chorus melody goes so crazy it could get me institutionalized. especially after the key change omfg. i‚Äôm obsessed with this song.

**JIRACHI** (10): not apologising when you're wrong is kinda a huge red flag idk about this kilo...

**Mandeemoo007** (10): This is such a great track, chorus is ear candy as well

**oscarbrierley1** (10): sounds like the climax of a sci fi movie. love the filtered vocals in the verse. slay key change.

**Poydoo** (10): noooooo abulugiezen hair

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): God this one is so good! Love the sort of Oliver/Justice vibes going on here, love the chorus and hell yeah there‚Äôs a final chorus key change! Great tune! Probably my fave on the album.

**qazz23** (10): really catchy chorus (+ a key change at the end!), a definite highlight of the album

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Euphoric

**Stryxen** (10): this is making me realise I have a habit of adding sorry for no reason to the end of rate comments. Sorry

**thedoctordances1940** (10): some raters will have some apologising to do this rate...

**Uberpigeon** (10): the start of this song makes me feel like a cartoon burglar breaking into the museum and then i do cunty gymnastics over the lasers when the beat kicks in

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): when i‚Äôm listening to an album i love for the first time, there‚Äôs always one moment that makes me go ‚Äúyeah this is incredible‚Äù. the entirety of this song is this album‚Äôs moment

**vayyiqra** (10): Unapologetic about this being a BANGER üç¶

**welcome2thejam** (10): Dear lord it's the absolute smasha, runs straight through me like a freight train and I'm the one who says sorry

**shipperondeck** (9.8): real would love to kick ass to this

**phonethephoenix** (9.2): great hook!

**Nagisoid** (9): Wish she pulled a FIFTY FIFTY and removed the key change

**UselessTacooo** (9): so true

**afs** (8.5): she did NOT apologize!

**prettybirbkotori** (8.5): she ate this one

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): in my creme bag for this cause i think the key change is kinda unearned

**WaneClubtoc** (8.3): Im getting better at hearing music this song is proof

**bogo** (8): evil nirvana be like

**CrimsonROSET** (8): ok the lyricism here is most of the marks

**freeofblasphemy** (8): None needed

**IIIHenryIII** (8): sorry not sorry

**kappyko** (8): Insert reference to current event involving certain YouTuber

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Me when I make a mistake and I know I‚Äôm wrong

**impla77** (7.9): my cat when she broke my mug (i swear it was premeditated):

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): this song is so good up until the key change, then it‚Äôs like okay

**xophrys** (7.7): me at how low my scores are for Kilo

**runaway3212** (7): I will say this album is good but it only sometimes crosses into great

**oh\_crow** (6): A SONG! ITS OK!

**slimboyfriend** (6): the exclamation point is a little much

### corrupting the youth and not even for a song you like

**vexastrae** (7.5): kurp told me to say "this song is the clit" so uhhhhh this song is the clit ig ... yea

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this was the only song on the album i heard beforehand and tbh it kinda made me worried to hear the rest of it bc i heard everyone saying this was the best song on it and i kinda dont like this at all?? so i wasnt sure how much i was gonna like the rest of it if this was the best track

**throwaway-7650** (9.525): my fault this missed the 2022 AOTY TTPT... SORRY

**imbaby122** (9.313): first off, this is hands down my favorite album of 2022, and is probably in my top 10 albums of all time. kilo kish was a name i never heard before a popheads recommendation (except on reflection, in a childish gambino song), and the rave reviews really intrigued me. from first listen, the catchy hooks, irresistible synth lines, and the perfectly crafted production immediately stuck with me. i‚Äôm not an album listener, but i had this album on repeat for weeks. beyond the musical aspect (which i cannot emphasize enough how perfect it is) i think this album really connects on an emotional level with me because it really adapts with my mood. there‚Äôs a hopelessness in the lyrics and production that really resonates when i‚Äôm spiraling. but the catchiness of the uptempo melodies also works when my brain is empty. overall i am shocked that this album hasn‚Äôt become a popheads staple.

**welcome2thejam** (9.188): Enjoy if not outright love almost every song on this project, sticky, bouncy melodies piled on top of each other and super duper consistent in the best way. Definitely worthy of my AOTY last year

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8.925): 2nd best pop album of the decade so far, and the best that's in English. That said, I prefer it without the deluxe tracks

**Stryxen** (8.688): Loosey Lakisha

**IIIHenryIII** (8.625): holy mother, this is the main reason why I do rates, to find such treats like this one. Why don't people talk about her? She deserves more recognition. I‚Äôm in love with this album, and I can safely say I‚Äôm a fan of hers now. I just think her quirkiness looks kinda forced, but she‚Äôs fun.

**vayyiqra** (8.563): Got into Kilo Kish back in 2020 with *Redux* and it's still maybe my favourite work by her, but as a full album statement this really outdid her earlier work (which is not bad either). I played this album on my radio show and talked about the lyrical themes about capitalism, Society, video games, and so on and how as a multidisciplinary artist Kilo has the perfect background to make a concept like this. Also it's full of bangers. She is a great songwriter and glad this got some acclaim! üç¶

**nt96** (8.562): I can see this album being robbed, especially with the deluxe tracks. Overall, it‚Äôs the wackiest of the three, but I liked it.

**DirtyRat583** (8.544): kilo makes music like a gamer girl (is she a gamer girl?)

**popularsong** (8.438): fantastic work all around. love how it's great to listen to both as an entire album, and for the individual tracks, love the videogame sound, the collabs that actually feel thought-out and not tacked on, the lyrics and overall themes... just great. also i must say the deluxe cover is so much better!! i wish the album artwork in general used the same aesthetic as the moving videos on youtube

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.375): Kilo Kish would be like my dream artist who I wanted to exist when I was 13 years old. Not that I‚Äôm being overly negative here, I loveddd so many songs here! At times I don‚Äôt fully like her singing voice but when she does utilize it well on a good song she really knocks it out of the park.

**WaneClubtoc** (8.325): kilo kish is an ALL-CAPS girl with lowercase, intimate feelings...I think. or, shes just rlly talented, fetched the bolt cutters, etc. anyways something does happen where the first half of this album RULES and then the back half decides to pivot into RESPECTABLY MID alt radio. no clue how this happened for kilo but the package here still delivers.

**beeozan** (8.250): king you're so vgm-phobic for not including rate winner american gurl theme 8-bit edition

**Mandeemoo007** (8.250): Very fun album embracing the video game nostalgia!

**vexastrae** (8.250): the best thing about this album is that it actually succeeds in critiquing american society through the medium of a pop album which a certain few artists are not able to do i fear ... anyways this is my first kilo kish album and omg this is like really good !! i get that the compression and the mix might be a bit annoying and claustrophobic at times but i think it adds to the texture and character of the album which is this very rough yet colorful thrift store with lots of interesting and pretty clothes with all sorts of textures. i kinda went all over the place with my scores at first but even then they were all positive and i landed at a set of scores that i think sum up the album pretty well <3 also if i ever get around to hosting industrial hip hop rate im putting new tricks in the bonus rate :yass:


**JIRACHI** (8.250): I had so much fun listening to this. The production was next level and the arcade/8-bit sound throughout is so unique. Some of the songs felt too pop for me which is fine I just find them not as great as the other tracks but overall a very solid project.

**moonagenightmares** (8.169): this is one of my favorite albums forgive the gap in scores

**lexiaredery** (8.094): The start of this album I love so much and it barely even gets worse from there. I feel like the deluxe songs don't really live up to standard album but maybe that's just because the quality is so high.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.094): super underrated album, great from back to front, my average would be a lot better without the bonus tracks though cause they don't really add much

**afs** (8.031): this is probably the most memorable album of the rate, where kilo had a proper VISION of what she wanted. sometimes it was a bit too messy and sickly sweet for me, but mostly she did an amazing job!

**UselessTacooo** (8.019): I was literally attached to this album all year and then forgot it even existed

**cremeebrulee** (7.731): i‚Äôve been into kilo for a minute so i was following the rollout for this album pretty closely! as a debut, it definitely didn‚Äôt disappoint though i will admit i haven‚Äôt relistened to it since last year. i‚Äôm glad this rate gave me the chance to revisit since it still holds up! (also i can‚Äôt believe we actually got a kilo rate off the ground JDHSFKJDF)

**indie\_fan\_** (7.669): This was the artist i heard the least about, so the last thing i expected coming into this rate was liking this one the most of the 3, but that's exactly what happened. a few lows here, but the highs are fantastic and some of the best of the rate

**shipperondeck** (7.669): so glad we finally get to rate a kilo project omggg

**oscarbrierley1** (7.625): spotify has been recommending this to me for ages, they were correct its really good

**qazz23** (7.531): this album is full of catchy choruses with electropop beats, not too much variety but the highs are quite high; the overall quality does fall off towards the end though

**freeofblasphemy** (7.469): Refuses to not be noticed and more often than not, worth the attention

**kindalikeyervajoina** (7.194): this to me was the less embarrassing ancient dreams in a modern land.

**Nagisoid** (7.094): The sonic palette gets samey after a while and the lyrics don't really add up to a coherent whole with the album's theme (or concept?) but it's still a solid pop record. Would love to see her embark in a more rock/dance direction, for sure.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.688): fun! oddly enough i think the singles are some of the weakest songs here and it picks up steam massively with its deep cuts, so much personality and joy in here and i‚Äôm glad i got to listen to it

**flava** (6.656): an album I came into this rate expecting to hate more, but time has let this grow on me. I mean it isn‚Äôt top tier, but this album has a few smashas in it, but I did distinctly remember hating more songs last year

**oh\_crow** (6.656): I've enjoyed Kilo Kish as a feature artist. Her delicate voice always sat so well amonst other vocalists and dances around beats so skillfully. This album hasn't really upgraded me from a casual enjoyer to something more substantial. I like the direction and meaning behind the album but her very singular voice is lost amonst the maximalism.

**apatel27** (6.406): enjoyment while listening to this album üìâ

I could probably write an essay on how amazing this song is but at the same time I do not have the energy for that. I just think it's brilliant and sexy and genius. In an interview Sudan described this as paralleling her love for her boyfriend with his love for his car, and it melded into some mechanical threesome between them all. The interpolation of Fast Car by Tracy Chapman is genius and only adds to the song, it's a fantastic build, I just think the entire thing is... euphoric. I did not know this track was as loved as it evidently is, absolutely sweeping the 11s in the rate

---

### the tracy chapwoman that you are

**Nagisoid** (11): When Luke Combs covers this too and it charts on the Billboard top 10 OMGGGG

**nt96** (11): made me wanna call my scammers and harass them about their car‚Äôs extended warranty

**oh\_crow** (11): The most fun and natural build up to the most satisfying pay off in a song, it never loses its spark to me no matter how many times I listen. Obsessed with the beat, the signature violin woven into the instrumental, the fast car lyrics flipped from emotional to nonchalant, it has it all

**popularsong** (11): a journey of a song. i feel like nothing i say can really do it justice but it's perfect to me. the sounds like knocking on a door or a phone call incorporated into the instrumental, her ethereal vocals in the "i hope he understands me", the way the beat picks up for the car drive section, the fast car references... she won every grammy in my mind

**qazz23** (11): the highlight of the album, love the switch-up when the pulsating beat comes in along with the violin

**uiscebeathaoir** (11): this song just keeps getting better. the first couple minutes are so amazing, i‚Äôd be happy if they just repeated for 6 minutes. but nah, instead she just keeps moving the song in new places and EACH PLACE IS SO FUCKING GOOOOOD, it‚Äôs insane that a song that manages to cram this many 11/10 ideas into it exists

**WaneClubtoc** (11): hold on hold on hold on THIS is the saintly 11 on an album with like FIVE OF THESE FUCKERS. There's a lotta ditties about cars and in LA if you make an album you have to acknowledge car culture is some shape or form; sometimes it is as an actual song and other times its just how the song resonates on the asphalt under trap hi-hats and ethereal synths; also it can be a metaphor for fucking or something (Sudan Archives mentions sailor moon but how does she feel about the cars in utena?). Sudan Archives is clearly doing all three with a cut that gestures at Fast Car (correctly, not as a 1:1 standard like others by taking the main desire of its essential line and rewarping it into her own desire...this is prolly why Fast Car is actually the best song of the 80s-Present bc of how well it allows it conveys the open-heart nature of desire that beckons for others to call in their own ways...see jimmy o'rourke's cover) but also totally in line with Toro y Moi's late-career 8.4/10 masterclass Monte Carlo and also is a ditty about prolly banging in a car as some kind of liminal environment. The dream nowadays is getting just a reliable somewhat affordable used sporty car: a honda fit, a monte carlo, a chevy s10, etc. And getting the car you don't really drive out to the the dream, you just cruisin in that moment. There is a love song underneath all of this, one of a desire that can't speak to what happens in 2 years but is just here right now. And if you stay here right now, you will hit that dream moment, the bridge near the end where she makes a swag as a fuck beat that emphasizes just how INSANE her beat making skills on when she brings out the violin. I love ChevyS10 for how much it YEARNS like NBPQ and seems to encapsulate best how much of LA itself, as a dream and desire, is to the entire NBPQ experience. one of the best songs of the decade full stop for me.

**Ambrosia42** (10): This seems like a bit of a nostalgic moment about a love affair with some guy and cruising around in his car driving fast and being dumb kids. The production starts to go crazy and then it smooths out again and it‚Äôs just delectable

**beeozan** (10): sudan archives had telepatia in one hand and the orb in her other hand. she also had like 10 more hands and fused all the stuff she held and this bop was born

**cremeebrulee** (10): this being the song i clutched onto during my first listen of this album i was being so real

**CrimsonROSET** (10): charli xcx- WAIT NOO

**DaHumanTorch** (10): luke combs don't even think of touching this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): really breathtaking song, love all the phases to it

**JIRACHI** (10): thought ChevyS10 would be a cool ass looking car but it's so ugly help???

**mac\_million** (10): if i had another 11 it‚Äôd go to this.

**oscarbrierley1** (10): its long but worth it, it pops off after 4 minutes

**ReallyCreative** (10): I'm not familiar with this breed of car, but I know a bop when I hear one

**Stryxen** (10): a FAST CAR reference in this GAY ass song about CRUISING..?? whatever happened to class ?

**throwaway-7650** (10): MANIFESTING the 10 is for the 10+ average this is getting YUP

**Uberpigeon** (10): oh you thought this was a boring song?? they thought this was a boring song?? ohh that's fucking funny bitch that's fucking a BANGER...yyeahh... yeah... fuck 4th of july

**UselessTacooo** (10): I mean it‚Äôs in the name what else am I supposed to do

**vayyiqra** (10): [doing this rate after waking up in the late afternoon after a night shift and before another night shift] uh this is uh quiet storm! Wait no it's definitely not after that beat switch (can't even say that as a comedic bit) but whatever this song rules either way üéª

**vexastrae** (10): NOOOOO SUDAN dont go cruising in his huge pick-up truck your blind spots too big you wont see the child crossing the street in front of you SUDAN NOOOOO

**shipperondeck** (9.8): THE STRINGS THOOOOOO

**buddhacharm** (9.5): my Chevy once stopped in the middle of the freeway so I cannot in good conscience give this a 10

**imbaby122** (9.5): idk what a chevy s10 is. i don‚Äôt know what any car model is. i can‚Äôt drive. car imagery is lost on me. but that doesn‚Äôt matter to me as long as the music is good (charli xcx is still my number 1 artist).

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): see kids this is why you listen to an album twice before you submit a rate bc i had this marked down as a 6 originally and i literally dont even know what i was thinking with that score maybe i really do need to see an audiologist

**xophrys** (9.5): This the only one that got me to move when my feet were in agony when I saw her live.

**impla77** (9): fast car should‚Äôve won aw3 <3

**Mandeemoo007** (9): Amazing building up to the dance break towards the end of the track

**sarcasticsobs** (9): what the hell

**welcome2thejam** (9): The way the vocals

**phonethephoenix** (8.9): catchyyyy

**afs** (8.5): i wasnt expecting a chevys10 to be straight out of bro country but go secure girl

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): sounds like she‚Äôs singing ‚ÄúCruisin‚Äô in a shitty-ass car‚Äù at one point lol

**DirtyRat583** (8): it sounds like shes singing off beat in the beginning and its REALLY annoying. cut off the first 2 minutes and its a pretty good track

**freeofblasphemy** (8): The ‚ÄúFast Car‚Äù of the 2020s we need, but not the one we deserve

**RandomHypnotica** (8): the lack of a space is bothering me more than it should

**Poydoo** (6.4): I felt betrayed when she said "Chevy S car"

**bigbigbee** (6): Fast Car references A+ best song of all time

### cruising in my chevy s [score]

**bogo** (11): i don't have a creative comment for this song so i'm just gonna say chevys11

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): More like ChevyS10. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be the only one to make a comment like this.

**runaway3212** (10): more like ChevyS10

**IIIHenryIII** (7): more like ChevyS7

Awkward_King: ### gay (cant drive)

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7): I like the bassline but the rest of the song leaves me indifferent

**lexiaredery** (6): For the length of this song it just feels underwhelming on the whole

**prettybirbkotori** (6): the vocals arent doin it for me

**flava** (3.5): am i being long songphobic? Not really, this song just does nothing for me. I do really love the production on this, it‚Äôs pretty dreamy but everything on top of it just distracts from that, and then the song becomes a renaissance song, and not one of the better ones. The Fast Car interpolation is also underwhelming

**moonagenightmares** (1): snooze + too long = excruciating

**JuniorChemistry5036** (0): i liked this at the start but then it drags out for so long and like i get what she was going for with the chopped vocals but its just kinda jarring.

This was the first single to REALLY hit me, and while it is a bit wild I think it completely works! The bluntness of the first lyric really throws you into it and I adore the constant switchups in the song. For some reason I thought this was more divisive than it actually is, as it just edged above a 9 average! I JUST WANNA HAVE MY TITTIES OUT, TITTIES OUT, TITTIES OUT

### anime rate is over and we're still not free of hearing about it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): between the Sailor Moon shout and the second song in this album that has a beat that‚Äôs similar to Missy Elliott Pass That Dutch, Sudan speaks to my needs

**seanderlust** (10): "all she want to do is watch sailor moon smoke weed and stare up at the moon" SO REAL FOR THAT

**Stryxen** (10): insane .. who thinks like this? all I wanna do is watch sailor moon smoke weed and stare up at the moon. AND I just wanna have my titties out titties out titties out in the SAME song

**DirtyRat583** (9.1): "all she wanna do is watch Sailor Moon, smoke weed and stare up at the moon" and shes right to do so

**afs** (8): sailor moon??? anime rate is OVER

### stream the age of pleasure

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): nobody has ever or will ever serve so much cunt in one song ever again

**vayyiqra** (11): A couple of weeks ago I played this album on my radio show and talked about what she says about colourism and body image and also went a tangent about topfreedom and its legal history in Canada. So thank you Sudan Archives for this insightful and educational song that's also a banger üéª

**Ambrosia42** (10): She seems to be fighting against eurocentric beauty ideals and she declares ‚Äúi‚Äôm not average‚Äù like a mantra, driving home that maybe she doesn‚Äôt fit the racist beauty standard, but she is still gorgeous and unique. The production is exquisite once again

**beeozan** (10): Sudan Archives wouldve 11d Moonlight Densetsu in anime rate

**bogo** (10): where's the titty gif when you need it

**CrimsonROSET** (10): tumblr at the 2018 porn ban:

**Frajer** (10): hey it's the album title

**impla77** (10): There are a lot of things going on, which distracts me from rhyming Moon with moon

**JIRACHI** (10): Nicole Baige Prooks Queen yup Sudan knows what's up!!!

**nt96** (10): oh this devours

**oh\_crow** (10): decidedly above average.

**plastichaxan** (10): This song just feels like catharsis after catharsis tf

**popularsong** (10): strong 11 candidate between the punchy aggressive beat, her delivery, lyrical matter, the way the beat switches up from fast to a slower portion to picking back up again then a slow outro UGH she's not average!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): she‚Äôs just like me fr except i‚Äôm not brown or prom queen

**sarcasticsobs** (10): what the hell

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): album title drops don‚Äôt get enough credit, when they hit right they can be one of the album‚Äôs best moment

**UselessTacooo** (10): This was my introduction to Sudan and it hooked me in so fast. There is so much going on in the best way possible

**vexastrae** (10): janelle monae heard the end of this song and said "fuck the metropolis suite this is my album concept now"

**WaneClubtoc** (10): is this dilla time?

**welcome2thejam** (10): So many different parts and all of them slam

**CallMeIsmail\_** (9.8): Banger and the opening lyrics go hard as fuck

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): She is an absolute parenthesis queen on this album.

**Mandeemoo007** (9): Really fun track, great solo at the end

**phonethephoenix** (9): instrumentation rules

**Poydoo** (9): do anime openings rate

**qazz23** (9): the bridge is amazing; this track certainly better than "average"

**xophrys** (9): HR Disaster

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): lockdown has destroyed the concept of bras to me like i really do just wanna have my titties out

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): Damn this goes for it

**lexiaredery** (8.5): The bridge really makes it for me

**Nagisoid** (8.5): Queen coming for highest average she's so real

**imbaby122** (8): i always want to have my titties out so this song is relatable in that sense but also i am very average. as an average girlie i haven‚Äôt felt represented since detox‚Äôs verse in read u wrote u.

**indie\_fan\_** (7.8): normally this sort of outro wouldn't hit me the right way but i don't mind it here

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): a little bit above average actually

### titties... IN???????

**prettybirbkotori** (7): never thought repeatedly saying titties out would be a little anxiety inducing but here we are

**moonagenightmares** (6.5): the parts that made me think my laptop glitched made the score much lower than it wouldve been otherwise

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): This is‚Ä¶ a song. I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about this one.

**flava** (4): Sorry but if your song has a titties out section to it, and my shirt stays on then we have a problem

### no, titties out!

**DaHumanTorch** (11): I JUST WANNA HAVE MY TITTIES OUT!

**slimboyfriend** (11): I just wanna have my titties out!!!

**ReallyCreative** (10): the way this song was SO real even before she just repeated that she wanted her titties out, Shakespeare couldn't

**runaway3212** (10): I think we should get more tits out personally

This could very well go down as Shygirl's best song, and it was such a perfect lead to this album. The way it blends her hyperpop/heavy instrumental stuff with the beautiful, light garage production is actually so incredible and the hook is infectious. She had me from the very beginning with this single. It was winning for most of the rate, the psychological torture that was inflicted on me watching this lose was worse than what any prisoner of war has gone through and I'll stand by that. MY all stars winner

---

### "this is a pinkpantheress song" "this is a eurodance song" "this is a coldplay song" this is a SHYGIRL song!!!!!!!

**akanewasright** (11): god she nailed the garage-y sound so hard‚Ä¶ like releasing this as a lead single after establishing a specific niche in rap for herself was a *bold* move that paid off big time

**DirtyRat583** (11): truly insane song

**thedoctordances1940** (11): a song that kinda keeps getting better every time I listen to it like this is just so good

**1998tweety** (10): this ate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): If you tank this song you‚Äôre kinda supporting the alarming and devastating impact human-driven climate change is having on the population levels and diversity of many species of insects idk.

**bogo** (10): i love how this kinda sounds like a 2000s dance pop song put through a blender

**CrimsonROSET** (10): pinkpantheress songs evolve into shygirl songs if they go longer than 3 minutes

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): she‚Äôs so good at chorus melodies‚Ä¶. How have her and nia archives never collaborated I‚Äôd lose it

**IIIHenryIII** (10): owl city is shaking

**imbaby122** (10): the early 2000s of it all omg. my heart bleeds with nostalgia and love and emotion. i love when shygirl gets less horny and more vulnerable. i can feel the longing and sadness in the production and vocals and lyrics. perfect song.

**JIRACHI** (10): don't know how fireflies are related to this song but ATE ATE ATE!!! would've been my other 11

**Mandeemoo007** (10): I love the stuttering in the beat and in her voice at points. Fun track overall

**oh\_crow** (10): I dont know what she's saying for most of this song it all blends together into one swirling gorgeous electronic I don't know how to end that metaphor but I do know I want to absolutely lose my shit to this in a club

**plastichaxan** (10): I just think it‚Äôs the song ever

**prettybirbkotori** (10): oh this fucks this bangs this slaps this cums this other weirdly sexual verbs

**ReallyCreative** (10): imagine how gagged I was that my irl Shygirl stans all hated this song when it came out

**runaway3212** (10): This is really just so incredible

**shipperondeck** (10): idk this hits just right

**Uberpigeon** (10): the best song ever invented

**vexastrae** (10): she sounds so urethral ... <3

**xophrys** (10): I'm a bit bored of this song but it is still good.

**moonagenightmares** (9.8): the production is kinda giving european hit from the late 00s/early 10s

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): Floating but also 2-stepping

**Ambrosia42** (9.3): This was such a shift from her earlier releases when this single dropped. The production just sounded so much lighter. This song is in a similar theme of human connection, and I can definitely relate to ‚ÄúI guess I need to hear the truth this time, you kept me waiting on a lie, wasting all my time.‚Äù It can be nice to indulge in the fantasy of being with someone you desire, but it can become a bit of a trap when they are dishonest or misleading and you‚Äôre stuck constantly wanting something that will never go anywhere. Such a waste of time and energy!

**impla77** (9.2): ‚Äòwaiting on a lie‚Äô- raters when ratcom is inflicting psychological damage with revealing the rate schedule

**slimboyfriend** (9): for better or worse Shygirl is made or broken by her beats and this SLAPS

**Stryxen** (9): yes! yes yes yes yes!

**vayyiqra** (9): This is really good I see the vision with this one winning ü¶ã

**afs** (8.5): damn where did THIS come from

**beeozan** (8.5): that melody is boppin

**lexiaredery** (8.5): I just really like her voice

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): vibey!

**qazz23** (8.5): infectious hook, love the multiple vocals during the chorus

**cremeebrulee** (8): she‚Äôs cute, not my choice for a winner, but i wouldn‚Äôt be mad at shygirl getting crowned with this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): why does this sound like a pinkpanthress song

**welcome2thejam** (8): Very good, idk feels like a Eurodance song for a more intimate setting

### would you even believe your eyes

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.2): its ok i guess

**freeofblasphemy** (7): Has enough of an idea to make me smile while listening but not enough to keep it in my head after it‚Äôs over

**oscarbrierley1** (7): probably the worst offender of being a good song that doesnt fit her voice. its just not in her range.

**uiscebeathaoir** (7): okay by this point the album‚Äôs constant repetition is already getting old but those are some pretty synths

**WaneClubtoc** (6.5): is this ditty coldplay coded?

**flava** (5): put it in eurodance rate

**UselessTacooo** (5): is this a safe place? Sure it‚Äôs cute or whatever but it‚Äôs sooooo repetitive and the more I listen the more I am disillusioned with the song as a whole

### fad city... owl shitty..... no postal service rate in SIGHT

**Nagisoid** (10): Fad City beyond over

**RandomHypnotica** (10): washed owl shitty

### oh thats not- actually thats kinda sweet

**DaHumanTorch** (9): thinking about how when my mom was little she'd make rings out of dead fireflies and wear them

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.533): I remember thinking this album was fine last year. I think I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with this different direction for Shygirl as I was used to her old hardhitting style. This time around I really love all the different beats and melodies employed here.

**shipperondeck** (9.227): if im gonna be super honest i think this album blows the other two out of the water... is what i would say if i didnt start liking the other ones a lot more during this rate too. either way it's still my overall fave of the bunch

**nt96** (9.073): this is for the artsy little hoes who love the club vibes but stay home in reality. And I‚Äôm staying home.

**WaneClubtoc** (8.900): on nymph, shygirl fetches the bolt cutters. no fr though i almost dropped money on an import tape of this. deeply intriguing dark pop stuff

**vexastrae** (8.700): this album has grown a lot on me since i first listened to it on release day; i kinda felt lukewarm on it at first and left with a vague "ok cute" impression yet when i revisited it for the rate i was like "damn OKAYYY" like this actually bangs !! u/Awkward_King said that "if ALIAS and her earlier work is *sex* then nymph is very much the foreplay" and honestly i fuck with that statement a lot bc nymph feels very dark and sleek and sexy to me but also its very sensual and sweet as well ... shygirl restrained herself in a way that doesnt diminish her strengths but rather elevates them and thats what this album feels like to me. also the run from firefly to poison is absolutely amazing oml

**Stryxen** (8.633): this album made me hungry

**Mandeemoo007** (8.533): Not the album we wanted but it‚Äôs the album we got, wish it was longer

**kindalikeyervajoina** (8.420): she's cupcakke for gays whose beyonce is fka twigs.

**DirtyRat583** (8.340): shes the most unique one here and i appreciate her for that

**lexiaredery** (8.333): The atmosphere throughout this album continues to leave me absolutely entranced

**qazz23** (8.300): this album's a bit uneven but there is some good production along with the R&B/hip hop sounds; overall it's fairly catchy and the bonus tracks are good

**imbaby122** (8.200): the first time i listened to this album, i was a little early to music class so i went to the bathroom and pissed while listening to woe. i sat there for a bit taking in the shygirl sound, truly appreciating the club/hyperpop hybrid that she has truly mastered. i haven‚Äôt revisited the album since then aside from the tracks i playlisted, but i still feel the same way. shygirl makes slut music for the hyperpop girlies (becuase hyperpop is a truly unsexy genre) and that‚Äôs a niche that only she can fill imo. a great debut that makes me excited to hear more.

**vayyiqra** (8.067): Being I didn't like *Alias* (I know, I know) and was not into Shygirl before this rate, I was hoping I'd be turned around on this album and it worked! This album is the one I've heard the least and so I didn't retain much after rating (needs a few more listens to settle in) but nevertheless I liked it quite a bit! Very consistent and enjoyable work. :imthankful: ü¶ã

**welcome2thejam** (8.000): Super lush sound, probably a hell of a night time album, might improve even more if I hear it again under better circumstances

**Nagisoid** (7.967): Definitely the inconsistent one among the 3 that we rated. Very high highs and low lows, you know the drill. Fun club music with experimental undertones thanks to its production, Firefly specifically almost got my 11. Would've 0ed Missin U if it wasn't an interlude, however. Hope she doesn't get as robbed as the EP rate...

**JIRACHI** (7.933): despite this being my lowest average it was just as enjoyable as the other two. all of the 10s i gave in this were so close to being my 11s because they were THAT good. the slutty sexy tracks were the standouts for me but yeah for a debut album she absolutely tore.

**cremeebrulee** (7.820): i know people were disappointed with this on release, but i thought she was cute! it‚Äôs obviously my least favorite of the three, but it is the one that got my 11. there‚Äôs some rly good cuts here and it makes me eager to see where shygirl goes next.

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.780): I remember being extremely disappointed with this when it came out and I'm a little more fond of it now but not by much

**throwaway-7650** (7.767): inconsistent singles + pointless "interludes" aside, A+ album!

**oh\_crow** (7.700): I didn't know much about Shygirl prior to the release of this album, just that the singles weren't being received as well as some of her older material. I still haven't delved into that older material but I'm so glad I gave this record a listen when it came out. Nothing but unique and ridiculously catchy club bangers that would likely never be played at an actual club

**afs** (7.367): this is THE alt club album isnt it! even if a few songs seemed unfinished and sometimes too short, shygirl rocks this pseudogenre! not to mention she also deals with a lot of variety on here

**beeozan** (7.333): an album that might've slayed if I was at the hypothetical alt club but I'm too online to be at such a place and yall have to deal with my nerd ass opinions

**IIIHenryIII** (7.333): This is basically Renaissance a little bit deyassified, but it's still such a great album. I love the song transitions, even though they make some of the songs sound a little bit longer, thus making it kinda hard to distinguish them.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.887): I really love some of Shygirl's music but that's mainly when it goes harder. This very often goes for a more understated approach and I wouldn't say it's pulled off badly, at times it does go well, especially on Firefly, but I'm bored by it just as often. It's an album I'd understand if somebody said they really loved it but that person is not me

**flava** (6.700): came into this rate to save Shygirl, and I dont think I did that

**indie\_fan\_** (6.553): beautiful production overall. i think most of my issues for this record lie on where the album starts to get a bit more "out there" in its sound. just not really my style as it's rarely a sound i find myself enjoying personally. outside of that, lots of good tracks and some great highlights

**UselessTacooo** (6.447): tanking half of this album actually pained me because I am such a Shygirl fan this album was just half slays and half flops

**freeofblasphemy** (6.367): Maddening because there are flashes of brilliance and you can tell Shygirl isn‚Äôt shy when it comes to trying things out. But she lives up to her name when it comes to receding in the backdrop of songs that have a lot of gears but not a whole lot of movement. I wish it could be all ‚ÄúCoochies‚Äù I really do

**oscarbrierley1** (6.200): as an alias stan it pains me that i dont love this album. i think it comes down to me not really liking her singing voice and she sings a lot on the album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.667): i just don‚Äôt like shygirl as an artist very much, her voice always sounds bored on every track she‚Äôs on and it takes me out of her music even if it is technically good. it‚Äôs a snoozefest of an album that doesn‚Äôt make an impact for me at all outside of a few songs that are carried massively by its production rather by anything shygirl herself does on the track

**moonagenightmares** (5.627): i liked this so much more than expected

The world kinda stopped when she released this. It was an amazing choice for a first single because of the slow intro and how great of a re-introduction it feels for her second album! It takes your perception of Sudan being this earthly, orchestral singer and flips it on its fucking head. I was expecting this to win for most of the rate, even when Firefly was winning this was always just behind it and for a moment they were tying for number one. But ultimately a few mid scores dragged it below Selfish Soul and cost it the win!

---

### mothered... but not hard enough

**JIRACHI** (11): the best song in the rate period. this just does IT for me.

**seanderlust** (11): lovely concept for a song

**Stryxen** (11): it's so dynamic and dramatic and amazing musically and lyrically. she sounds like such a STAR. Probably my fav song from the last couple years.

**UselessTacooo** (11): The second I heard this I just KNEW it would lead to an amazing album. the way it blends art pop, r&b, pop , and a stadium style outro all together without sounding messy is a true feat for any artist, especially one as new as Sudan. Possibly one of the easiest 11s I‚Äôve ever given in a rate

**welcome2thejam** (11): Had this as my second favorite song of last year, and yeah, still deserves such a lofty position. So perfectly paced and built. The drum roll during "baby I'm the baddest" is one of the most dope musical moments of last year, the transition into the bridge kills every time I hear it, her voice straining not to run out of breath in the first verse, just that whole interlude... just a fantastic song, what else can I say

**Ambrosia42** (10): This song has such a unique sound. The production is so fresh and warm and the melodies are quite lovely, and it seems to touch on keeping a tidy home for your sanity but also taking care of a relationship with a person to make everyone feel comfortable and at home

**beeozan** (10): god this song is such a ~~twelve~~ ~~twenty~~ thousand out of ten from me but the lofiness of it all sometimes annoys me a bit. And being a slightly annoying perfect song isnt enough to cut it for an 11 in this album cuz the rest is also perfect

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I joked in the discord about giving this a temporary zero to try to get a Kilo song in first place for at least a minute but no I‚Äôm not risking forgetting to change my score later and having to (justifiably) go into hiding after the reveal.

**bogo** (10): there's a comfy serenity to this song that i really love it's like shelter from a storm. ofc it's also a major banger too

**buddhacharm** (10): me after purchasing a dryrack for my apartment:

**CallMeIsmail\_** (10): One of the best songs of the year and very nearly my 11

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song is so special to me ugh i love the idea of carving out a home for yourself like this is so 2022 creme coded ..

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i barely m- [GUNSHOTS]

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i can't believe nu-disco didn't exist before this thank you sudan archives for inventing nu-disco

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): what a great melody. And love all the production‚Äôs textures throughout

**impla77** (10): Me when I put my mug in the dishwasher exactly once:

**Mandeemoo007** (10): She popped off, weird intro, fun groove throughout, great ending

**Nagisoid** (10): Tom Nook was ended that day

**oh\_crow** (10): I really love this possessive cottagecore anthem. only bad bitches in her trellis, and baby? she is the baddest

**phonethephoenix** (10): oh the end for sure bumps this up to a ten! love the funk?

**popularsong** (10): the intro immediately sets the mood for the song, like you are alone at home and trying to put on appropriate music, then progresses to that gorgeous beat and her vocals kicking in... such a beautiful song. i also really love the "my mood's been real sloppy / i cry when i'm alone" part with how the instrumental corresponds with the lyrics

**qazz23** (10): sets the tone of the album very well; really good vocal delivery and chorus

**ReallyCreative** (10): Tradwife anthem

**runaway3212** (10): The Weekend by SZA and this are sister songs. The sisters hate each other they have a real succession type dynamic

**throwaway-7650** (10): ariana grande on opposite day:

**TiltControls** (10): I thought this was going to be about The Sims

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): if you wanna know if i feel at home with her, check my album average

**vayyiqra** (10): I was hooked from the intro and then once the groove came in it was over for me. this is ethereal funk ! üéª

**WaneClubtoc** (10): whenever I jump on the beds at the sleep train I'm kindly asked to be removed before then being escorted out by police for asking "WHERE IS ALL THE MONEY Y'ALL ARE LAUNDERING". but when Sudan Archives does it, she gets a music video with ~300K views

**shipperondeck** (9.6): always great when a song finally clicks

**imbaby122** (9.5): this song is for the cottage core girlies, the club girlies, the bad bitches, the welcome to my island enjoyers, and the mothers (both literal and spiritual).

**notarobot3675** (9.5): what an opener

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): what the hell

**IIIHenryIII** (9): thankfully it progressively got better

**oscarbrierley1** (9): a very stong opener

**vexastrae** (9): me removing the pool ladder in sims 3

**plastichaxan** (8.8): I cannot relate to this even a little bit but she‚Äôs so real for it

**afs** (8.5): home with the mother slayke

**bigbigbee** (8.5): This feels like one I‚Äôm gonna regret underscoring - and in fact, in typing this comment, I raised the score already by a bit

**DirtyRat583** (8.5): approximately half a Whole New World and it makes good use of the space!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): me in IKEA or something idk

**freeofblasphemy** (8): Overextends itself a bit towards the end, but still, grooves

**Poydoo** (8): is this cottagecore

**prettybirbkotori** (8): this is a good album opener i feel

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): me playing animal crossing: happy home designer

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The beginning is me when I scroll through the presets on my keyboard

**xophrys** (5.1): Fuck off Martha Stewart, Sudan Archives is the new Home Maker.

### for a period when home maker/firefly were top two flava was the lowest score for both i was pmsl

**flava** (4): I feel as though the slay intro is dampened by the fact that this song‚Äôs progression feels very awkward, somewhere between the clapping percussion  on the chorus that sounds a little bit too hollow and the chorus that is only catchy cause it‚Äôs beating you in the head with it, but I don‚Äôt really hate it either, just very underwhelming

God I'm so happy this is just the best song ever. Truly everything about it is perfect, a song I am so glad isn't any longer than it needs to be! It's an ode to natural black hair and self love and it is just so lovely, a perfect pop song. This was in third behind Firefly and Home Maker for like almost all of the rate so when it got a flurry of 11s towards the end and absolutely no one tanking it it soared into first and wasn't even close enough for me to fake it! Cannot wait to 11 this in winners

---

### i shouldve bannered this

**CrimsonROSET** (11): i feel like i would be on thin ice if i made any jokes about this song snatching my wig so im just going to settle for it being the clit of the rate

### i did banner this bc it was sweet

**cremeebrulee** (10): ‚Äúam i good enough am i good enough?‚Äù yes baby you are!!!!

### sudan archives we love you!!!!!!!!1

**beeozan** (11): anthemic club girl beat

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): next time some white pophead wants to hear ‚Äúpure pop‚Äù (coded to be white women synth pop) im giving them this. This is my pure pop

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): Idk what else to say except it sounds pretty and anthemic

**bogo** (10): üó£Ô∏è I DON'T WANT NO STRUGGLES I DON'T WANT NO FEARS I DON'T WANT NO STRUGGLES I DON'T WANT NO FEARS üó£Ô∏è

**DaHumanTorch** (10): just did the cuntiest irish jig

**flava** (10): ooh this is a fucking HIT, the kind of anthem you can just get swept away in

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): the intro makes me cry for some reason

**JIRACHI** (10): music that moves people... literally

**lexiaredery** (10): I love how this sounds

**Mandeemoo007** (10): Great track, love the violin throughout

**Nagisoid** (10): Stella Artois was so real for using this song in an ad

**oh\_crow** (10): This has such lead single energy, even tho I dont think it was, really feels like the centrepiece of the album. If I didn't have an 11 chosen this would be under strong consideration

**qazz23** (10): good bass and violin; there's plenty of change-ups for its ~2 minute runtime

**runaway3212** (10): Being selfish is underrated

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Brittney Parks you are more than good enough and you will always be famous

**sarcasticsobs** (10): what the hell

**Stryxen** (10): fiddle-playing jester vibes sudan always devours

**Uberpigeon** (10): her hair was cut off but her pussy was popping her violin was popping and she had about 10 layers of reverb and she made history

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): if this doesn‚Äôt win the rate, we should all take a long hard look at ourselves

**UselessTacooo** (10): at first I slightly tanked this but after I couldn‚Äôt get it out of my head for the rest of the rate I saw the light

**vayyiqra** (10): To whoever played this song in some reveal it worked you Sudanpilled me good work üéª

**vexastrae** (10): god i love this song so much

**WaneClubtoc** (10): gta v blonded radio type beat that self-adds itself to the game. really encapsulates LA late night "busting your ass thru" freeway driving with that shuffle beat n' blown out bass  and ethereal bisexual harmonies.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Finally a song for those of us who shy away from all difficulties at all times

**CallMeIsmail\_** (9.7): Love the melody on the hook and she uses her violin here incredibly well

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): this might be favorite song on the album

**phonethephoenix** (9.5): love these lyrics and delivery! catchy

**Ambrosia42** (9.4): Here it seems like she doesn‚Äôt want to follow conventional or eurocentric beauty standards once again. Maybe she wants to keep her hair natural, or maybe even cut it off completely, and I think it‚Äôs interesting that she frames it as ‚Äúfeeding her selfish soul‚Äù since I think it‚Äôs quite reasonable to base your hairstyle on what you want rather than what other people want. The production is quite lovely and energetic

**xophrys** (9.3): Brittney Buzzcut

**bigbigbee** (9): This song got the ‚Äúsong that we choose to play for promo during a rate reveal that I hosted somehow stuck with me long after the reveal was done‚Äù boost. It‚Äôs in good company with Superfast Jellyfish by The Gorillaz

**freeofblasphemy** (9): amazing (hair)cut

**prettybirbkotori** (9): i'm jammin

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): yeah she‚Äôs just serving massively here

**shipperondeck** (8.8): honestly im not sure why this is the one that is the most popular? but it's still good. jk i relistened while actually listening to the lyrics and i like it a lot more

**afs** (8.5): how can she be selfish when she's feeding us so generously like

**throwaway-7650** (8): me spreading malicious rumors as a intak akgae:

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): i gotta put myself first

**imbaby122** (7.5): thought this song was gonna be some representation for accidentally selfish ppl but it ended up being about very normal very not selfish behavior that society wants us to believe is selfish, let girls have hobbies!!!

### only negative comment being criticising it not being longer..... she ate

**popularsong** (7): i really love the lyrics, the chorus and the fading-out repetitive outro, especially tht little riff leading up to the chorus, but i feel like it ends too early

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10.000): I thought this album was ‚Äúcool‚Äù and overly long last year and couldn‚Äôt connect with her voice. Now this year I‚Äôm completely obsessed???? It‚Äôs so varied, funny, heartbreaking, clever like what the fuck!!! And the production here is truly mesmerizing, what a fantastic blend of art pop, R&B and electronic. And THE VIOLIN! Now the official instrument for hot girls (tho I guess this was also the case in the 2000s with Twista - Overnight Celebrity). This album really is that bitch whew

**WaneClubtoc** (9.873): We had been getting fund drive/promo for early sudan archives when I was doing college radio proper in 2019; the stone throw . The vinyl cover potrait of Silk still is one of the coolest things ever. I've always been a bit notorious though of being behind on Sudan, and in two contexts I've missed her (both at a festival due to a schedule conflict + bc i traveled to go to another festival). When I did finally hear Athena outside the singles and a couple cuts that didn't hit me at the time, I realized it had massive highs in between soft bloat. When I got Athena for $3 at a Permanent Records gig, the clerk told me "I used to work with her at another coffee job before she went to do her music full time". After listening again, Athena is capped at a B-level "great opening statement", that Natural Brown Prom Queen borderline renders inessential. NBPQ literally is a Greatest Hits compilation of completely new material for an artist who has two albums and two EPs to her number; there was no indication that Sudan Archives not just could mend hip-hop, rnb, and pop but do it with an underlying current of LA clubbery coming through to make a very situated, forward looking statement that resonates with THAT city and the Southern California region...it's likely the best LA album of the decade so far. She simply understand how to write songs, but these are the kinds of songs where her underlying violin shows up with no gimmick (and pushes her FAR beyond whatever strange pigeonholing that presented) as a flair for essential detail, and even in some cases it STILL  STEALS THE SHOW; which is quite the feat bc at this point it's just so inherently obvious that she's a massive fucking triple threat who yearns and desires and shifts like I do with her voice and wave of vibes! It is criminal that the audience for this is just...not here. In spite of the massive praise this has been given, this album is gonna crucially be cast around to one circle of internet weirdos and clubbers to the other. May it forever belong to those that need it most <3

**Stryxen** (9.867): how is this rate real HDRHRJRK

**UselessTacooo** (9.493): Still not over when she asked the crowd who was Irish and half of us screamed and she gasped while looking at her team saying ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think anyone would be Irish‚Äù, then proceeded to play an Irish Jig

**popularsong** (9.400): one of my most played albums last year and definitely my favorite here. i don't remember how i ended up even stumbling upon it, but i am glad that whoever was shilling NBPQ or ChevyS10 got to me that day because i was hooked immediately

**beeozan** (9.347): probably the best album of 2022 what is there to say

**throwaway-7650** (9.333): home maker is the song of all time I fear!

**nt96** (9.200): Sudan Archives is a heavily underrated force to be reckoned with and I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre finally rating her. Easily one of my favorite albums of the year.

**JIRACHI** (9.200): everyone who voted this rate to be in this cycle i love you because this album is one of the best things i have discovered honestly. not a single skip in sight just bop after bop vibes after vibes!!! you can shake your ass to every track and that is very much needed in music!!!

**vayyiqra** (9.133): Really liked this album, been listening to it a lot late at night. Wish I got into Sudan Archives back in 2019 when *Athena* came out but glad I found her now! I love the way this album blends genres together effortlessly with both insightful and quirky lyrics and also a lot of personality. Quite impressive for an album she made at home. oh yeah and the violin rules üéª

**Nagisoid** (8.960): I've heard this described as a modern answer to the Velvet Rope by Janet, and while that may be pigeonholing a bit, it speaks to the excellent quality in that Sudan delivered in this statement. Incredible arrangements, vocal performances and most importantly, variety, make this such an enjoyable and fun project. I'm excited to see what she does next and I have to check out her debut as well, it might even appeal more to me.

**qazz23** (8.833): a good mix of R&B and art pop with some hip hop and soul, it's a bit long but there's enough variety of sounds here that i didn't mind its length; love her vocal delivery, the production is amazing and the string sections are a nice touch

**oh\_crow** (8.700): On my initial listen to this album, many moons ago, I was impressed from the get go by the variety, the instrumentals that weren't afraid to switch up, the hook after hook laced through each song, the warm and grounded voice that steered a steady ship through changeable waters. Maybe I also thought it was a bit of an ambitious mess when I stepped away to see the full picture. But damn if this album didnt demand me to keep returning to it. To this day I feel constantly rewarded with every listen. I genuinely hope this rate nabs the NBPQ and Sudan Archives herself more fans and admirers. If a certain diva astride a disco horse hadn't dropped a slightly more immaculate record then Sudan would have my 2022 aoty in the bag. What a runner up NBPQ turned out to be though.

**welcome2thejam** (8.667): Wow the instrumentals on every song sounds wonderful, she's so creative, an album jampacked of gorgeous tunes

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8.633): The critics were so right about this one

**vexastrae** (8.633): you know that one lyric in that viral tiktok song with the two girls running towards the camera that goes like "im made of sugar spice kanekalon and cinnamon"? yea thats basically the vibe of this album. nbpq is very warm and homely in the way that vanilla and baked goods in the oven smell, like it just gets into you and passes over you like a warm orange blanket dappled in sunlight. the album can be a bit slow at times but it takes that time and build itself a world for you to live inside of <3 now i want homemade cookies. now i want little caesars. now i wanna watch one piece with u/TragicKingdom1

**shipperondeck** (8.300): big BIG grower for me

**DirtyRat583** (8.193): im impressed at how ridiculously consistent this album is. not good not bad a secret third thing

**freeofblasphemy** (8.100): Vibrant and personal from beginning to end. And Cincinnati connection!

**Mandeemoo007** (8.067): She really did that

**imbaby122** (8.000): the only album in this rate that is a first listen for me, and i can see why it was included. all of these albums are genrebending, but there‚Äôs something about a self-trained violin player from ohio making rnb, club, pop, hyperpop, rap hybrid music and blending it so effortlessly that is incredibly special.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.827): I really like the opening leg of this album but after a while it kinda loses steam. Still some very good stuff in the mix but there are a lot of tracks here and a lot of it is just good not great.

**afs** (7.800): loooove her production choices! though her lyrics can be a bit basic sometimes, she makes up for it with some confident, memorable vocals and all in all was prob my fav album of the rate

**cremeebrulee** (7.800): i‚Äôve listened to sudan prior to this and she‚Äôs always been pleasant, but i wouldn‚Äôt have called myself a fan or anything. this album *really* surprised me last year, i found it so endlessly captivating; it was definitely an AOTY contender. plus it was super incredible to hear live. i‚Äôm soooo glad we‚Äôre getting a chance to rate it, i really hope it introduces more people to her!

**indie\_fan\_** (7.373): this album was the most anticipated to hear as I've heard a lot of good things about it. pretty solid record overall. didn't have too many issues with this one as it's probably the most consistent of the 3

**oscarbrierley1** (7.333): kind of chaotic as an album, has its ups and downs

**lexiaredery** (7.300): Definitely my least favourite of these albums, It has the highlights to match Kilo and Shygirl but also a higher share of the less interesting stuff even if they aren't that bad.

**IIIHenryIII** (7.267): honestly, this one took a second listen to grow on me. It‚Äôs a really nice album, and I‚Äôm definitely adding it to my music library.

Awkward_King: ---

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.067): i had high hopes for this album because i heard a few sudan archives songs before and was into them but this album was just kinda all over the place to me, theres a lot of song on here that i think are *almost* great but one or two weird production choices hold them back for me and it leads to me just feeling kinda jaded with the whole album in general

**flava** (6.100): okay I‚Äôve really tried with this album, I don‚Äôt want to just randomly hate on it based on one listen in 2022 that didnt click, but maybe 2022 flava was right because this album is kind of a snoozefest for me, Sudan‚Äôs voice just never really clicked with me, her delivery never hits that inviting sensual vibe that others have managed to pull off. Nor does the confidence feel all that present on the more fun bops. But there‚Äôs also just a general lack of vulnerability or an emotional core, so this album is stuck in a nothing middle where there isn‚Äôt much wrong with it, but there isn‚Äôt much right with it too as it goes through different alt r&b textures and sounds that sound so tasteful. There are a few moments that do come alive and I see the vision, but those are just moments on an album with mostly middling songs and honestly, a quite frankly terrible pacing. I guess another aspect as to why this album doesn‚Äôt really hit is that the vocals are mixed in such a way that the lyrics are rarely emphasised, and it can really hit the fun factor this album has, like when she sings ‚Äútitties out‚Äù I just don‚Äôt feel it. Idk what else to add other than I‚Äôve heard others just do it better (especially in June of 2023). Very sleepy music

**moonagenightmares** (5.740): i didnt actively dislike this album but it wasnt really my thing

Congratulations to **Selfish Soul** for the win and Sudan for the top 2 sweep! Across all songs rated by the sub  Selfish Soul places 183rd.

**Artist Stats**

* Not much unfortunately, though Sudan just barely misses the top 25 leaderboard for artist averages!

## Albums

As always, I still have very little idea what I am doing with deluxe albums. Right now both Kilo's and Shygirl's deluxe tracks are counted as they are included on a version of the album with a 'complete' version (though Cleo is counted as a 'extra' song). If anyone wants to argue in another direction I'm always open to it!

(Rankings are out of 399)

* 35th: Sufjan Stevens - Age of Adz (8.242)
* **36th: Sudan Archives - Natural Brown Prom Queen (8.237)** / Marvin Gaye - What's Going On / Run the Jewels - RTJ4 (8.237)
* 39th: Amy Winehouse - Back to Black (8.235)

-

* 95th: Allie X - Cape God (7.896)
* **96th: Kilo Kish - AMERICAN GURL (7.893)**
* 97th: The Beatles - Abbey Road (7.891)

-


* 129th: Blondie - Parallel Lines (7.806)
* **130th: Shygirl - Nymph (7.805)**
* 131st: Phoenix - Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (7.802)

**Album Stats**

Unfortunately again, there's nothing really to talk of, but here's the 11 / 0 split

* Natural Brown Prom Queen - 38.2% of 11s, 2.2% of 0s
* AMERICAN GURL - 31.5% of 11s, 12.4% of 0s
* Nymph - 22.5% of 11s, 16.9% of 0s

deleted: I tend to lurk on these rates & get into the albums based on how their songs get ranked, so I‚Äôm now a Kilo Kish fan (Sudan & Shy I already loved)

I‚Äôm SHOCKED at Firefly coming third, good for her, I think I‚Äôve listened to that song twice & had Shlut/Heaven/Woe on repeat üòÇ

Y‚Äôall ever gone jogging at midnight to Home Maker? ü•µ
