This was always kind of doomed to first out (as you can tell from the graph KJDSJK). Unlike at least the Shygirl interludes which for me function more as short songs than interludes, this only really serves its purpose to transition the Kilo album.

---

### found themselves in the tv

**Frajer** (9): Spongebob when he made the commercial

**afs** (8.5): if this was fleshed out she wouldve won :pensive:

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8): It plays a useful role in the context of the album but is a bit whatever otherwise

**CrimsonROSET** (8): persona 4 plot:

**phonethephoenix** (8): nice interlude-type of song

**vayyiqra** (8): This is crunchy and metallic. I said what I said. üç¶

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): My best wishes to this inevitable day 1 casuality

**Poydoo** (7.4): hey hosts you forgot an interlude

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): experimental glitch masterpiece

### lowering their screentime

**beeozan** (7): doki doki act 3 type beat

**ReallyCreative** (7): well what was V.1

**runaway3212** (7): could never be me I lost myself in the PC

**Stryxen** (7): wait the experimental electroclash maximalistronica someone get hot like wow on the phone

**Ambrosia42** (6.8): The repetition seems to hint at how television can possibly lead to conformity or be almost hypnotizing, and it kind of reminds me of different news channels getting people outraged about all the wrong things or people seeking to imitate trends in popular TV shows and losing their individuality. All that said, it‚Äôs not the most interesting song.

**indie\_fan\_** (6.6): not that frequency effect at the start i thought i was losing my hearing or sumn for a sec

**imbaby122** (6.5): legit the only skip on the album and when i don‚Äôt have the energy to skip it i actually kind of enjoy it in the context of the album.

**WaneClubtoc** (6.3): sleeopy sidestep

**impla77** (6): pretty sure that happened to a kid in Charlie and the Chocolate factory

**prettybirbkotori** (6): sooo cool and conceptual (i did not understand)

**vexastrae** (6): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/896148582699266058/1130674017787990146/image.png

**JIRACHI** (5): interludephobia :(

**notarobot3675** (5): great interlude

**popularsong** (5): i love how creepy the song is but i feel like it drags on too long and loses the creepy factor eventually. i always liked the instrumental for reminding me a bit of drakengard ending e song though lmao

**sarcasticsobs** (5): A song, for sure

**welcome2thejam** (5): The one "eh that was okay" song of the batch

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Love Kilo and love this album but I think I‚Äôve seen a few 0‚Äôs for this song and I can‚Äôt fault them. I don‚Äôt hate it but it just kinda drags the album down for a few minutes.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): not the biggest fan of this one

**oh\_crow** (4): I swear I'm not interlude-phobic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): idk what you want me to say here. like yeah this sure is an interlude.

**Uberpigeon** (3): we could have done without this one gorge

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Guys I think she lost her face in the tv

**apatel27** (0): There's nothing here

**bogo** (0): she sounds like one of those talking dolls when they run low on batteries why did she do this üò≠

**qazz23** (0): too repetitive and the vocals are dull

**seanderlust** (0): is this a predictable 0? yeah but it still is my least favorite in the rate so

**shipperondeck** (0): i get the intention and execution but that doesnt mean i have to like the latter

**xophrys** (0): a child could write and perform better nursery rhymes than this ms.kish robinson

### girl this ain't the ring

**nt96** (7): this plays when I crawl out the TV like The Ring

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): she watched the ring ONCE

**Nagisoid** (3): OKAYYYYY SAMARA MORGAN

I didn't know how many people thought this sounded like a horror movie until this rate but damn aksdjks. I will defend this idc it's a banger

---

### got their degrees from missin university

**beeozan** (10): lavender town ass music idk why are we scoring this when its under 1 minute but its a bop

**plastichaxan** (10): Her having honey and missin u as songs this album‚Ä¶ Robyn was shaking

**UselessTacooo** (10): I don‚Äôt care that the crumbs of Alias are burnt and moldy I take what I can get

**WaneClubtoc** (10): even her interludes rule

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): this is goth

**qazz23** (9): wow it's a 1 minute song

**Ambrosia42** (8.9): The Sega Bodega production just absolutely eats, and Shygirl brings an appropriate energy that matches with the beat. ‚ÄúI just want a real man, a guy to hold me down and give me dick when he can, is that too hard?‚Äù Real.

**shipperondeck** (8.8): you really feel this one yk. you = me idk

**lexiaredery** (8.5): I'm not sure why this is included and It's Already Done isn't but I'm grateful that it is

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): catchy and love how it's a little off-kilter.

**seanderlust** (8.5): short song but such a banger

**bogo** (8): idc if it's like a minute long it's a banger deal with it. yes that is correct i'm giving this a higher score than most of american gurl so what

**impla77** (8): Sounds like a music box gone WRONG (which I kinda like)

**prettybirbkotori** (8): blackpink type beat

**Stryxen** (7.5): :p

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): i think this feels like a bit of a messier version of ALIAS cuts but it‚Äôs cute

**DaHumanTorch** (7.3): this snippet goes off, can't wait for the song to release!

### flunked out

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7): Shygirl's unwillingness to make full songs out of the actually good instrumentals on this album is very frustrating

**IIIHenryIII** (7): we could‚Äôve gotten such a brilliant hyperpop track with that intro‚Ä¶

**afs** (6.5): reminds me when i ran into my chimes in the balcony

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): i feel like this has the potential to be a full song, give it another verse

**Mandeemoo007** (6): Needed more

**ReallyCreative** (6): oh she's not long for this rate

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Throw me in with the interlude-phobia crowd this round I guess

**vayyiqra** (4): Well as a track this was weird and kind of a misstep I feel, but I support her anyway ü¶ã

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Okay good I needed something to make sure Kilo was my highest average album.

**CrimsonROSET** (3): glee anxiety music type beat

**oh\_crow** (3): Little Bit Shygirl came back with a vengeance, not at all sure what this adds to the album

**throwaway-7650** (1): girl... stand up

**freeofblasphemy** (0): No

### girl this ain't the ring

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): This shit sounds so scary lmao, sound like she‚Äôs rapping on a horror movie score or something

**Uberpigeon** (7): puppet from saw type beat

**vexastrae** (7): evil clown music

**Nagisoid** (2): Horror movie breakdown scene music

**TiltControls** (2): I feel like I'm about to get jumpscared in a horror game

**DirtyRat583** (0): haunted vibes + not even a minute long + ERECTION??? of ALL WORDS

**JIRACHI** (0): it's 3AM here with no lights the instrumental is scaring the fuck out of me i'm sorry i have to give this a 0

A cute interludey track! Don't have much to say about it tbh, it does it's job in the tracklisting and I enjoy it but it's not one I ever really wanna listen to on its own, so I see why it placed so low even if I don't think it deserves

The last three tracks on Nymph mark a real dip in quality for me tbh, like they're not the worst songs ever but they're just not even close to as good as the rest of the album. This song just kinda meanders for me, and I think Shygirl's voice just sounds hollow and echoey and it's weird. First flop song called Honey tbh

---

### comments that mention other songs called honey

**Frajer** (10): what was the last Robyn album called again

**bogo** (9): a worthy addition to the "slay songs called honey" club

**runaway3212** (9): if king doesn't play beyonc√© after this I hope he abdicates

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): worse than pure I mean poison but still good!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): We need a mini rate of song titles with the highest slay hit rate. Like put ‚Äú3 AM‚Äù in there too.

**Nagisoid** (8): Stream Just Like Honey by The Jesus and Mary Chain ‚ù§Ô∏è

**vayyiqra** (8): Not the most original song title but sure good ü¶ã

**Ambrosia42** (6.9): I like it, but it‚Äôs a bit forgettable and I fear Honey by Robyn and Honey by Katy B both outsold

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): this sits firmly behind halsey and mariah

**IIIHenryIII** (3): Maggie Rogers remains unbothered

**uiscebeathaoir** (3): in the Anthemic Indie Pop Rate i saw some people saying that there were no bad songs called Honey. yeah no

**cremeebrulee** (2): don‚Äôt name ur song this if you‚Äôre not gonna bring it wtf

### finger in my pussy like a honey stick

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the sound here is unreal. The new age synths against the slower breakbeat. The ATMOSPHERE

**ReallyCreative** (10): if she thinks that using a Kelela synth is going to be an instant 10 from me... well she's right!

**xophrys** (9.8): this, onto of a hill looking over a city just sort of like cleanses your mind ( I imagine I should do that though that sounds fun )

**WaneClubtoc** (9.4): i love that the entire rate is basically "what if you liked the last fka twigs album and also those late 90s albums where electronic got seamless mended into janet/ebtg/cibo matto...a lot of the shygirl album (and tinashe and twigs) have that playfulness and slick execution of the beats. its so great to hear this and totally just resonate off first listen!

**imbaby122** (8.5): i think this song is really underrated, especially because it‚Äôs so different for shygirl. the ambience is saur good, but it does drag a little bit.

**moonagenightmares** (8.5): was getting my kpop updates while this was playing and only belatedly realized she wasnt saying Unnie unnie

**afs** (8): yass buzz them bees

**Mandeemoo007** (8): Nice mellow breakbeat track

**qazz23** (8): love when it picks up about 2 minutes in

**phonethephoenix** (7.9): really like the production!

**JIRACHI** (7.5): this felt a bit empty for me but ate regardless

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): Production carries

**vexastrae** (7.5): we needed the kilo kish honey song so we could call this rate the honey rate

**CrimsonROSET** (7): !r1

**Stryxen** (7): swirly dreamy nightcore trip hop

**TiltControls** (7): r1

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.2): boring

**freeofblasphemy** (6): Sometimes a vibe can be just a little too vibe-y

**plastichaxan** (6): I know it‚Äôs a hit rate when my lowest score is a 6 but it still kinda feels wrong to give one in this rate plsss

**oscarbrierley1** (5): she is trying to be kelela but its more kelelnah. its such an interlude sounding so, i cant believe its almost 4 minutes

**thedoctordances1940** (4.8): so boring

**prettybirbkotori** (4.5): no amount of bass can distract from this song being kind of nothing

**akanewasright** (4): yeah this just brings the energy down a bit too much

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): music to fall asleep to

**UselessTacooo** (0): nap time!!!!!!!

### honestly i have honey and i dont hate it but it's never any actual use like i've actually gotten a code out of it like... once

**impla77** (6.7): honey has great PR.. like its lowkey nasty

**welcome2thejam** (8): Tally another for the songs about California list

### kelis - lil star

**plastichaxan** (10): If you don‚Äôt have star ~~quality~~ power get the fuck out of here

**ReallyCreative** (10): the versatility!!

**runaway3212** (10): I wish every song from now on was only about how much LA sucks I truly feel like it's where music peaks

**WaneClubtoc** (10): really good gorillaz knockoff. glossier vibes

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): wtf the outro is giving lil mariko /neg

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): oh, she knows how to win a popheads heart, just add some video games beeps and boops and you're good

**phonethephoenix** (9.5): i've never been to LA but this song does sound like it to me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Songs about the darkness of show business and Los Angeles are kinda overdone at this point‚Ä¶but we don‚Äôt care when they slay.

**imbaby122** (9): this is such a great song but it doesn‚Äôt feel as hectic as the other songs. but it‚Äôs marina deep cut energy is very appreciated.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): 2010s bubblegum vibes I love it

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8.9): Really nice song but I sorta wish it was a bit catchier or something

**Nagisoid** (8): Not the self own considering Kilo moved to LA

**nt96** (8): KKB-core

**Stryxen** (8): she was even in the 80s

**vayyiqra** (8): *[Ben Shapiro voice]* Kilo Kish *[which he mispronounces]* says that L.A. is a nightmare, yet she lives in L.A. I find this humorous. üç¶

**oh\_crow** (7.5): Wait this has a fun bouncy energy to it, totally get why it was relegated to bonus track tho

**JIRACHI** (7): LA is so overrated we need to stop singing about this shithole of a city

**Mandeemoo007** (7): Cute track, not my fav

**akanewasright** (6.5): oh okay we got something cute out of this

**Ambrosia42** (6.5): Seems like a song about making questionable decisions and making deals with the devil and such just to become famous, and then still not actually quite reaching that fame and fortune you wanted. Reminds me of a certain singer‚Ä¶

**moonagenightmares** (6): it was cute

**lexiaredery** (5.5): The production feels weird

**prettybirbkotori** (5.5): it was fun i liked the beat

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this sounds like one of the album cuts on teenage dream that makes people reiterate that that album is only good for its singles and nothing else

**UselessTacooo** (3.5): help I am trapped in a pool floatie commercial

### oh wa oh

**buddhacharm** (10): this is so 2022 Video Killed the Radio Star

She was a genius for this. And so many of you have such tiny brains. Tiny weenie petite tiny tiny brains. ALL NIGHT EVERY DAY ANYTIME THAT COOCHIE CALLS I BE ON MY WAY

# we love women!

**ReallyCreative** (10): do you think this is Cate Blanchett's favorite Shygirl song

**Stryxen** (10): the audacity had me so offended clutching at pearls on first listen then on second listen i was like oh okay lol

**vayyiqra** (10): *I was just sitting there, humming to myself. And I was like, ‚ÄòWouldn‚Äôt it be cool to have a cute song about coochie?‚Äô* sure why not ü¶ã

**vexastrae** (10): PILLOW PRINCESSES OF THE WORLD UNITE

**notarobot3675** (9.5): song of all time

**oh\_crow** (9.5): I thought this was the dumbest thing when I first heard it but actually I was on the wrong side of history. Maybe there's a coochie waiting for me after all

**afs** (5.5): coochie what? coochie where? ... coochie here! coochie THERE!

**popularsong** (5): this isn't shygirls fault but this blip-boppy sound was overused in kpop at some point (i.e poptime or kang daniels debut song) and mixed with the explicit lyrics it evokes some kind of evil feeling in me. the likes of which i last remember feeling when i listened to ice cream by blackpink

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): its like if you made brooke candy and hannah diamond collab on a song together but neither of them had any talent whatsoever. i mean brooke candy already doesnt have any so its not that far off

This track always felt like a pallette cleanser after how grand ChevyS10 is, and I appreciate it a lot as that! I did not know it was pretty unanimously seen as the weakest on the album :shakey: which is sad! But we move

---

### a 7.5 average already.... we copied having taste in this rate

**buddhacharm** (10): this FROOT looks...

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is shoegaze

**phonethephoenix** (10): love the backing track and her vocals

**Stryxen** (10): ohh me giving this just a 7 cuz I didn't remember this song from the title but it's THIS one. Yeah easy 10.

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): i gasped out loud multiple times the first time i heard this song. not giving this my eleven is genuinely hurting my soul

**beeozan** (9): days of the week in songs start to feel like a jumpscare

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this song is so wacky like who does she think she is remi wolf

**vayyiqra** (9): "Monday Tuesday need to get some sleep" so true! [I work nights] üéª

**vexastrae** (9): YOU CANT ERASE ME CAUSE YOU AINT ME!

**welcome2thejam** (9): What if relaxing river ambient music six hour Youtube videos went hard as hell

**Nagisoid** (8.5): TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY AND FRIDAY

**oh\_crow** (8.5): Headcanon that this is about her twin

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): me when king died his hair orange

**afs** (8): go FIX your notions

**bogo** (8): for only two and a half minutes there's an awful lot of song to this song

**IIIHenryIII** (8): it‚Äôs not a competition, but Billie definitely lost

**oscarbrierley1** (8): her flow is so satisfying

**qazz23** (8): the sudden üé∫üé∫!

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's crazy how this is my least favorite song from the album and still an 8

**UselessTacooo** (8): the production is sooooo good but it‚Äôs the only song on here I just don‚Äôt care enough to praise beyond that

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.8): Feels a little muted but the refrain is nice

**DirtyRat583** (7.7): the genius page for this song is painfully empty. anyway what does flue mean

**impla77** (7.6): there seems to be some struggle bars in this one but otherwise good

**Ambrosia42** (7.2): Seems to be about someone trying to copy her style rather than taking the time to develop their own unique identity. The production is quite interesting again, but the track doesn‚Äôt impact me quite as much as others

**freeofblasphemy** (7): Love the energy even it doesn‚Äôt feel fully realized

**Mandeemoo007** (7): Nice track overall, fun production

**popularsong** (7): the switch-ups in the beat don't quite land here for me but it's a fun song

### coochie out (song about pussy).. copyCAT out..... oh i see

**lexiaredery** (6.5): I don't like crowd noise in songs

**plastichaxan** (6.5): Feeling the need to apologize for a good score cause it just feels sick to give it to her but I don‚Äôt like this too much ouu

**prettybirbkotori** (6.5): fun production but slightly forgettable

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): i wish she‚Äôd copied good music here

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is not bad at all but it‚Äôs a bit of a cute next to gorgeous situation.

**imbaby122** (6): i want to love this song but something about songs with cheering crowds in them makes me feel a little icky. it always takes songs down a point or two for me.

**runaway3212** (5): This is kinda the flop of the album I hate to say it

**xophrys** (4.5): fizz on the scanner

**cremeebrulee** (4): wait i thought this was called broken nations this whole time . i was like woah that's kinda doing too much for this song

**flava** (4): im sorry is there supposed to be a song here

### how did this song get two renaissance comparisons im

**throwaway-7650** (6): HEATED out-monday, tuesday'd

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): why does this kinda sound like a renaissance demo

Her acronymising kind of into KO to suit the video game theme is singlehandedly both the corniest thing on this album and the most genius. I guess I can see why this was a little too sugary sweet for some people and that's why it ended as day 1, but I've always been a fan!!

---

## it kills me that vex changed their 11 from coochie (#41) to super ko love (#39)

**vexastrae** (11): this song was already a smasha the first time i heard it but just the other day i had an emotional episode where i was super sad and so i played this on repeat and all of a sudden i just said to myself "oh ... i get it now" ..... so yea this is my 11 <3 idk if kilo kish will win this rate and maybe i shouldve chosen a 'better-performing' 11 but fuck it i love this song too much <3

## knockout hit

**beeozan** (10): her mind expanded to galaxy levels when she named this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I‚Äôm not sure what exactly Kilo meant with these lyrics but I‚Äôm gonna apply a personal interpretation of ‚Äúfuck centrism‚Äù because‚Ä¶fuck centrism.

**Frajer** (10): Waller recruiting Peacemaker

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I honestly think the title would look more satisfying if it was spelled as kinda, like people normally do

**impla77** (10): love a good rhetorical question song

**JIRACHI** (10): oh this is going straight into my favorites playlist

**plastichaxan** (10): Need someone with money or connections to ~~get me to~~ write a sci fi musical with Kilo imagine the slay with this album like I see the vision

**RandomHypnotica** (10): disney radio core

**ReallyCreative** (10): such a fun bop

**thedoctordances1940** (10): kinda basic but kinda amazing

**imbaby122** (9.5): the most bubblegum pop tune on the album and the truest to the retro video game theme methinks. it‚Äôs not as complex as the rest of the album but the melody is undeniable, and it‚Äôs a welcome change in tone and pace.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oh i thought it was like super K.O. love as in someone‚Äôs KO move

**Nagisoid** (9): Future Pride Classics songeniality

**welcome2thejam** (9): Sorry gang, she just doesn't miss

**Poydoo** (8.6): that intro is sick

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): me when i love kappyko <3

**Ambrosia42** (8.2): The way the title and production remind me of a video game, but the title actually means ‚Äúsuper kind of love‚Äù is fun.

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8.2): It's cool I guess

**afs** (8): super KNOCKOUT love girl dont be afraid to say it

**freeofblasphemy** (8): This is what 80s revival should sound like

**Stryxen** (8): omg KO like anak ko by Jay som

**vayyiqra** (8): I love synths and vintage video games and synths that sound like vintage video games üç¶

**phonethephoenix** (7.5): the title is clever! i like the percussion

### low hit points

**shipperondeck** (7.5): as pophead's resident fighting game fan, i wish i could rate this higher, but...

**DaHumanTorch** (7): it's a fun and catchy moment but i've always felt like there was something missing here

**flava** (7): pretty solid synthpop

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): Rock n roll

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): she tried so hard to not call this song superlove and get the charli xcx/tinashe references thrown her way

**qazz23** (6): decent 80s feel to it, a bit generic though

**uiscebeathaoir** (6): i don‚Äôt mind listening to the song but it just doesn‚Äôt feel essential to the album in any way

**bogo** (5): this is electronic surf rock which should be cool but kilo somehow makes it boring

**popularsong** (5): this is the one song i don't really like on here, if i had to rearrange the tracklist i'd drop it. something about the chorus annoys me

**UselessTacooo** (5): total knockout (for this song because it‚Äôs boring)

**WaneClubtoc** (5): this is a killers song or something. sounds like 2√∂√∂5 alt radio

**prettybirbkotori** (4): ok this is just boring

**akanewasright** (3): yeah she lost me here

**runaway3212** (3): This is super forgettable

I didn't like this on release and I literally have no fucking idea why?!? Like I remember sitting down and watching the video and disliking it and like I have no memory of why but that was so insane of me bc this is phenomenal. Arca x Shygirl is a match made in heaven I'm sorry everyone else here is so tasteless

---

### cummers

**xophrys** (11): I like to think this is what my heartbeat sounds like at this point

**bogo** (10): sounds like a club that's slowly disassembling itself, it rules

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the beat and tempo is sooo good

**runaway3212** (10): this is super great

**UselessTacooo** (10): ARCA COME THROUGH

**vexastrae** (10): SHYGIRL AND ARCA YOU WILL ALWAYS BE FAMOUS

**welcome2thejam** (10): Swimming for hours in the deep sea type beat

**Ambrosia42** (9.1): The production and vocal effects and everything are stunning. Arca and Shygirl just seem to fit together really well and it has this mechanical, sexual vibe

**CrimsonROSET** (9): why cant i get into arca stuff this is great

**Frajer** (9): I should know by now  that all popheads rates are secret hyperpop rates

**lexiaredery** (9): This production has grown on me so much but I love it now

**qazz23** (9): good production all around, love the multiple layered vocals and synths

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Percussion got me doing karate chops in my room rn

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): if no one else got me i know arca got me can i get an am√©n

**impla77** (8.7): the only things coming for me are flies when i turn my ipad on in the dark

**afs** (8.5): considering the song after this is shlut i think i get this

**WaneClubtoc** (8.2): shygirl's talent is sounding like the matrix [super sexy edition]

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): ‚ÄúLooking for a diamond in the rough who‚Äôs that gonna be?‚Äù - me desperately trying to find a song to 10 on an album I dislike to raise my average.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I‚Äôm willing to give this song the benefit of the doubt and assume come really means come

**Mandeemoo007** (8): Love the Arca production on this one

**oh\_crow** (8): This feels like a good fusion between the various styles Shygirl utilises on this album

**seanderlust** (8): the drumbeat on this along with the pitched up vocals makes a really cool soundscape

**Stryxen** (8): great noise great scratching and squelching great moans

**Uberpigeon** (8): when this came out i did not understand it. i was like why the fuck is this a single what is this. its nothing..... but now i kind of get it.

**uiscebeathaoir** (8): is it just me or does she sound a bit like Bjork during the pre-chorus (which is what genius calls it, this song is formatted so weird I have no idea what bits which)

**phonethephoenix** (7.9): üî•

### november

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.3): I like the weird grunting in the instrumental but the rest of the song is too light and the glitches don't really work

**Nagisoid** (7): There's better Arca-produced Shygirl songs :shrug:

**prettybirbkotori** (7): sounds cool as always but lacks a purpose

**vayyiqra** (7): A bit repetitive toward the end but I like it ü¶ã

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): idk why this has always given me Kai Whiston vibes maybe it's the single cover, but like in terms of production this is so clearly Arca it doesn't even really sound like Kai Whiston. I really liked this song at first when it came out but idk it kinda grew off me, like the production is definitely cool but apart from that it's just quite boring

**imbaby122** (6.5): honestly this song has yet to really connect with me. i think the production is so incredible, very arcaesque, very controlled chaos. but the vocal effects and kind of off-tuneness throws me off.

**shipperondeck** (6.5): i feel like i have to give Something in this album a lowish score and this one sometimes hits my ears wrong and gives me a headache so

**freeofblasphemy** (6): I want to like this so much more than I do

**JIRACHI** (4): i really tried to understand this but it never happened... arca i'm so sorry

**beeozan** (3): today I woke up and decided to hate hyperpop actually. the way she sings the "can you follow me" hook is so good but the breathing all over is icky

**RandomHypnotica** (2.5): of the most energetic people in music come together to create music absolute boredom

**oscarbrierley1** (2): the production is so annoying

### hater!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**flava** (1): when i said I was saving Shygirl, what I meant was I am going to tank bad songs like this to tell Shygirl to stop making songs like this so she can do better in future rates

I just?? Don't like this at all!? I think lyrically it's very interesting but it feels much more like an interlude than a single with as big of a feature as Miguel should. It's just not musically anything I'm really interested in. Honestly expected this to be even lower sjkdjks but good for her!

---

### miguel's death fantasy must've come true bc where was he on this song

**Ambrosia42** (10): and then it fades into this song omg. American Gurl (song) is about identities and restrictions and then this song is about a fantasy of just killing all of those expectations and freeing yourself. The production and Miguel‚Äôs backup vocals are heavenly (or hellish?) and it‚Äôs just exquisite.

**cremeebrulee** (10): her giving miguel the taylor swift female feat treatment i was laughing so hard

**phonethephoenix** (10): extremely cool

**popularsong** (10): i like how it takes the message that american gurl kickstarts and takes it further, specifically to the side of creating art, and something about the solemn sound correlates with this feeling of exhaustion

**Poydoo** (10): It's a bit too short but it's kind of incredible

**qazz23** (10): i like the dark sound of this along with the spoken-word vocals

**Stryxen** (10): she is so me making everyone in the room uncomfortable by oversharing after 1 Gin and lemonade. thank you for this

**throwaway-7650** (10): huh. what if this is the fantasy shygirl mentioned in cleo

**vayyiqra** (10): "This is a real gloomy moody cut", I type about a song literally called "Death Fantasy", as though expecting otherwise from a song with that title üç¶

**WaneClubtoc** (9.5): miguel, kilo kish is not your wife. I, Miuguel Wifetoc, am a suitable replacement tho

**shipperondeck** (9.3): this song makes me feel like im floating (to my grave) (it's great)

**imbaby122** (9): this song is so depression induced girlfailure. iykyk.

**kappyko** (9): OMFG I GET IT....

**Mandeemoo007** (9): I wish Miguel had an actual part, but love his vocals throughout

**Frajer** (8.5): Miguel is making Little Mermaid noises

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): girlie be careful they will commit you for this

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): this is basically vaporwave, slays a lot, could just be a bit longer

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8.3): a bit TOO chill

**impla77** (8.3): personally a fan of keeping mens contributions firmly in the background

**DirtyRat583** (8.1): something something oceangate [note if im the only ocean gate comment thats like.... its current affairs people!! when i get a SHAME section because im the only one who did]

**afs** (8): we needed a miguel bridge!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Not my favorite song on the album but it‚Äôs definitely a better death fantasy song than that one by‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶*one Google search later* The Band Perry.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): i have those too girl

**IIIHenryIII** (8): Miguel shouldn't be treated like this

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Ominous!

**vexastrae** (8): damn girl i know i have writers block goddamn!

**welcome2thejam** (8): You've got guest ah's from Miguel, lighten up

### üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ

**beeozan** (7): thanatos ~ if i cant be yours ~ outsold

**CrimsonROSET** (7): mine involves cloud strife choking me out

**freeofblasphemy** (7): Great Miguel feature was favorite part was when he uh‚Ä¶uh..

**prettybirbkotori** (7): why do i hear lorde

**uiscebeathaoir** (7): i think, ‚Äúfinally Miguel‚Äôs about to take lead vocals!‚Äù and ten seconds later the song ends

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Very superficial complaint I know but this sounds like this is too early in the album‚Ä¶ Like this is the kind of track I expect to hear right before the dramatic climax song in the second half

**akanewasright** (6.5): this song being a single is so goofy bc you know they only released it because they got Miguel on it‚Ä¶ who‚Äôs barely even on the song

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Miguel in Death Fantasy is Beyonc√© in Pink & White

**Nagisoid** (6): Miguel saved this, not sure why Kilo was trying to do edgy whispery stuff

**oh\_crow** (6): Would have appreciated a bit more back and forth between vocalists, Miguel sounds smooth as hell tho

**runaway3212** (6): this does very little for such a title

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): miguel getting a featured credit on here is like janelle monae getting a featured credit on we are young

**bogo** (5): she should've given miguel a verse that man's voice does things to me and many other popheads

**Uberpigeon** (5): i have a deaf fantasy because i dont want to be hearing this song

**RandomHypnotica** (4.3): i wanted more HEALTH vibes from this

**oscarbrierley1** (4): saw miguel and i kinda expected more. i spend the whole run time waiting for something to happen

### my ass is not an accessorary

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): My AirPods when they to decide to randomly stop functioning for the first 20 minutes of my lunch break.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): take one thing off before you leave the home and she chose my WIG? the audacity

**ReallyCreative** (10): ok I don't actually remember this song being THAT good but she just doesn't miss!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): yeah she absolutely ate this up

**phonethephoenix** (9): hits!!!

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8.7): I'm enjoying how hard this goes

**afs** (8.5): tell him!!!!

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): this should've made the standard

**imbaby122** (8.5): i can see why this didn‚Äôt make the standard edition of the album, the melody doesn‚Äôt quite stick like most of the other songs do. but with that being said, i think it‚Äôs eccentric in the best way.

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): .np Ava Max - Not Your Barbie Girl

**Mandeemoo007** (8): Honestly nice track, wouldn‚Äôt have minded this one on the full album

**popularsong** (8): get him again for me

**runaway3212** (8): I fucking love this song

**vayyiqra** (8): She's right and also did you know she is very into fashion üç¶

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): but i want to wrap your legs around my throat

**shipperondeck** (7.8): a fun jam

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): make that very clear for your stans

**Ambrosia42** (7): This one seems like she is in some sort of relationship with a person who is obsessed with fame and money and fashion and they only want to be in a relationship in the dark, hidden away from other people. She feels like a disposable accessory that might not go with every outfit/situation rather than an actual equal human being. This one doesn‚Äôt have quite as gripping production and melodies, but it‚Äôs still good

### yeah i said it, accessorary

**freeofblasphemy** (6.5): Yeah I see why this was a bonus track

**Nagisoid** (6.5): The baby Jesus namedrop... she's so unserious

**qazz23** (6.5): kind of drags, some good backing synths though

**vexastrae** (6.5): FAME ..... MONAY ..... GAME !

**Stryxen** (6): no thoughts

**uiscebeathaoir** (6): Kilo Kish definitely has a lyrical style on this album, but here it crosses over into ‚Äúwhat the hell does any of this even mean?‚Äù

**cremeebrulee** (5.3): me when i see my sister wearing my earrings idk

**moonagenightmares** (5): it came and went

**UselessTacooo** (5): these deluxe tracks aren‚Äôt really it huh

**RandomHypnotica** (10): achoo

**welcome2thejam** (9): Me getting a vaccine every fall

**CrimsonROSET** (8): achoo

**afs** (7.5): cutting points because i literally have the flu

**bogo** (7.5): no one has to get into the flu if they get their flu shot every year like they should

### why does sudan reference having the flu multiple times on this album

**phonethephoenix** (10): excellent vibes

**throwaway-7650** (10): p!nk during her concerts:

**WaneClubtoc** (10): played this on the radio and was going awooga with the strings and the chorus' mantra. repeatedly throughout the album, Sudan Archives finds a way to naturally bring in her violin that conducts, not just plays; this might the pinnacle. Especially during it's last minute tempo shit and call back to the freeway. she knows that I that freeway!

**UselessTacooo** (9.2): I‚Äôm sure the ‚ÄúFLUE‚Äù is some complex metaphor but I‚Äôm too tired to break it down

**popularsong** (9): idk how to describe that violin-like sound both here and in loyal but i'm obsessed w it seriously

**Stryxen** (9): what a whimsical chorus

**imbaby122** (8.5): oh she would definitely be the coolest bitch in high school orchestra. first chair without try hard suck up energy. effortlessly talented and always outserving everyone in her all black concert fit.

**impla77** (8.5): one of the worse transportation options in the harry potter universe

**lexiaredery** (8.5): The horns throughout are nice

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I don‚Äôt how exactly to describe it but I really love the little high pitched bloopy noise in the instrumentation of this.

**Nagisoid** (8): Sudan we already rated Dance Fever sorry

**qazz23** (8): a good neo-soul sound with strings

**runaway3212** (8): I fucking hate the flue but this is a bop I guess

**seanderlust** (8): me when i'm not feeling like going into work EDIT nvm this is the chimney thing

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): okay honestly this is what i was expecting more of the album to sound like, r&b/club influenced music but with strings accompanying it, i think i would‚Äôve liked this album a lot more if more of it sounded like this since the few songs i heard from her before this rate followed that same type of vibe and i liked those songs a lot more than anything on here

**Uberpigeon** (8): what is the flue

**vayyiqra** (8): It has a shuffle okay it cannot be bad. the jazz influence rules üéª

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.5): Some interesting ideas but it doesn't really connect

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): That‚Äôs right we don‚Äôt

**vexastrae** (7.5): do you think the victorian children will be disappointed we havent found a cure for the common cold yet

**Ambrosia42** (7.4): I love the way her violin playing gets integrated into the songs and it never sounds out of place.

**buddhacharm** (7): oh so she's a COVID denialist... (/j)

**cremeebrulee** (7): her ass can rly fiddle woahh

**Mandeemoo007** (7): Very etherial intro, into a stank face groove which i love, this track especially reminds me of Sudan's older sound

**xophrys** (7): wish I could spell flute like this

**prettybirbkotori** (6): sometimes pretty strings are all it takes

**oh\_crow** (5): This is just a low point on the album for me, kinda a nice break after so many songs that are doing so much musically but not a favourite

**IIIHenryIII** (4): I‚Äôm not feeling this one

I really couldn't decide whether to use my 0 in this rate and this was my main contender, but I realised if I'm forcing myself I probably don't genuinely think it deserves one. This doesn't have the same eclectic instrumentation as the rest of the album, instead being kind of plodding, but I still enjoy elements. I JUST MISS MY HOMIE TK

---

### comments abt the song

**bogo** (10): love the section of this album where sudan makes some of the hottest songs i have ever heard

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): GRUNGE ANTHEM!!!!!!!!!! EDDIE VEDDER FUCK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**throwaway-7650** (10): I feel like this is madison beer shade

**uiscebeathaoir** (10): finally a song where sudan gets to shine vocally rather than just showing off her insane production skills (which tbf are still here, she can‚Äôt switch it off that easily)

**WaneClubtoc** (10): the beat on this is woozy, maybe not out of sync, but giving that as Sudan goes the fuck OFF about what she wants. this is big music

**shipperondeck** (9.6): i too am unfortunately attracted to gorgeousness and arrogance

**flava** (9.5): I‚Äôm sensing this is going to be day 1, but this is an excellent little slow burn

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): it‚Äôs really repetitive but in a way that it‚Äôs transcendent instead of boring

**Ambrosia42** (9.2): This one kind of relates back to ‚ÄúHome Maker‚Äù in a way I think. It seems like they‚Äôre both sexy and had something good for a while, but the feelings have gone stale and her needs aren‚Äôt being met. They aren‚Äôt making love anymore, and she‚Äôd rather be home and see her friends and family. This house is not the home she wants after all

**sarcasticsobs** (9): what the hell

**CallMeIsmail\_** (8.2): Really cool song but it's missing something

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Having listened to her two albums several times, yeah she deserves to have a bit of arrogance idk‚Ä¶

**freeofblasphemy** (8): sick

**Mandeemoo007** (8): Lovely track, very smooth track about being so horny

**phonethephoenix** (8): lovs how expansive this sounds

**qazz23** (8): nice laid-back sound with some good background instruments

**lexiaredery** (7.5): Good, but the spelling doesn't work for me

**IIIHenryIII** (7): that‚Äôs a vibe

**TragicKingdom1** (6): i'm rly boring not sure why she misses me

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): drags on, feels like its on 0.5 speed

**prettybirbkotori** (4): i just do not like her singing voice

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): it got better in the last minute but im gonna be honest i was so bored for the first 75% of this song

**RandomHypnotica** (2): sorry this makes me just sleepy

### what rate happened last month?

**CrimsonROSET** (10): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/442154440863252480/977012312407953438/All_of_one_piece.gif

**Poydoo** (10): not one piece üíÄ i trusted you

**Nagisoid** (8.5): The amount of anime references we should've sent her a ballot

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): And where was Sudan when One Piece went out at #64 in the Anime Rate?

### what is another word for penis?

**JIRACHI** (10): I JUST WANT THAT DEE EYE SEE KAY

**ReallyCreative** (10): I JUST WANT THE D-I-C-K

**oh\_crow** (9): Tonal whiplash between feeling homesick and pining and then just really wanting D-I-C-K but her voice and instrumental sound so sweet and soothing so it's all good

**popularsong** (9): the way the song goes from the "i want the whole view, its now or never, why cant i dream too?" to "i just want the D I C K" is iconic

**vayyiqra** (9): This cut is so late-night lofi beats (complimentary) coded idk ignore. oh lmao right this is the song where she talks about Initial D and then says "give me some D" üéª

**afs** (8): dicksickness :pensive:

**nt96** (8): if she wasn‚Äôt so concerned with the dick, she would‚Äôve enjoyed the anime rate

**bigbigbee** (3.5): it pains me to give a song that makes a dick pun on ‚Äúinitial D‚Äù and mentions One Piece a score this low, but the chorus of this has always grated on me

### who is dude's nemesis? 

**runaway3212** (10): My homie TK??? Sudan a secret rater?

**Stryxen** (10): I just can't take this seriously the double gut punch of spelling out D I C K in this emotional downbeat track and then immediately name dropping TK HDHRHFHDH.

**DaHumanTorch** (9.3): i just miss my homie TK ü´†

**plastichaxan** (9): This cycle has so much raters name drops but ‚Äúmissing my homie TK‚Äù may be the funniest one so far

**indie\_fan\_** (7.6): "i just miss my homie tk" hmm i wonder what most of the comments for this one will look like

**vexastrae** (7.5): this mans got little caesars some wine and one piece for date night and honestly? im kinda into it || OMG u/TragicKingdom1 GO CALL HER SHE MISSES YOU !!

**Uberpigeon** (6): hi tk girl i just saw tk

**cremeebrulee** (3.5): i do just miss my homie TK </3

### where should i go for dinner?

**welcome2thejam** (7): So incredibly smooth, this song is so big for those dudes who can only spring for Little Caesars

**imbaby122** (6): in the words of our generation‚Äôs great philosophic mind (some random person on twitter) little caesar‚Äôs is so good when there‚Äôs not some bitch in your ear telling you it‚Äôs nasty.

I think I just wanna like this more than I do. Like it's easily the most garage/dnb leaning song on the album but it feels too breathy and I think the production on her voice is kinda offputting?

---

### its JUST SMOKE DADADA DADADADA

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): pussy on fire emote

**phonethephoenix** (10): pretty and a vibe! great vocals and production

**popularsong** (10): listening to this late at night in the dark when theres less noise made me hear god i think

**runaway3212** (10): no because why is this album so inconsistent it's either the best song ever or an ALIAS reject

**xophrys** (10): I have a headache and this song is helping

**shipperondeck** (9.8): this song ü§ù tinashe song of the same name = being really good and also sounding like a literal wildfire

**Nagisoid** (9.5): Australia's National Anthem

**sarcasticsobs** (9): C'est magnifique

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): this made me learn shygirl‚Äôs name is Blane‚Ä¶ ok head warbler pop off

**Ambrosia42** (8.8): She seems to be comparing herself to a wildfire in relation to her passion and attraction to someone. Perhaps her attraction and feelings have caused issues in the past, as she says ‚Äúdanger approach, no warning signs, run with the wild fire.‚Äù Fire is often used as a metaphor for love and passion, and it‚Äôs apt because it just needs a little spark and then emotions can run quite wild. The production is quite gorgeous and it‚Äôs a lovely album closer.

**impla77** (8.7): shygirl caused the new york smog??

**imbaby122** (8.5): so vulnerable and shygirl‚Äôs most impressive vocal performance imo. i cant really tell whether there‚Äôs heavy vocal manipulation to give that vibrato but regardless it‚Äôs a sound shygirl should use more often.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wait how was this about a wildfire

**oh\_crow** (8): Very cool final track, the last third of this album feels incredibly scattered but this a nice and moody bookend

**qazz23** (8): like the dark sound of this, good vocal delivery

**vayyiqra** (8): Wow I love UK garage ü¶ã

**welcome2thejam** (8): Always a sucker for unleashing the strings at a good time

**WaneClubtoc** (7.8): rat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat! TAT TAT AT!

**beeozan** (7.5): wow ambient pop

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): i guess the album does finish on a relative high at least!

**vexastrae** (7.5): cute closer <3

**afs** (7): finally the sequel to say my name

**freeofblasphemy** (7): I like seductive drum ‚Äôn bass what can I say

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this one is neat, i like how spacey it sounds

### that scene in hunger games where the gamemakers manufacture a forest fire.gif

**Mandeemoo007** (7): Nothing special compared to everything else

**Stryxen** (6.5): GO BACK TO WEIRD EMO SECTION OF HYPERPOP BONUS RATE WHERE YOU BELONG

**uiscebeathaoir** (6.5): the only Shygirl song in the rate that I have no strong feelings about one way or another. still enjoyable

**CallMeIsmail\_** (6.3): boring

**cremeebrulee** (6.1): wildfire flames rising hit me like a bullet finger on the trigger, pull it, pull it

**moonagenightmares** (6): it picked up around the middle but the beginning and ending were really boring

**akanewasright** (5.5): it‚Äôs okay

**IIIHenryIII** (5): it‚Äôs not great, but it‚Äôs not skippable

**UselessTacooo** (3): firefly caught on fire and not in a good way

Not my fave track on the project, I much prefer the build to the actual payoff, so I agree with it being Day 1 but its nice to see other people fighting for it!

---

### will stay true to their besties

**1998tweety** (10): shes pretty

**buddhacharm** (10): so nostalgic for the COVID unemployment bonuses era...

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): love the beat to this one

**Nagisoid** (10): Every song should be government mandated to have breakbeats, this is just proof of that

**phonethephoenix** (10): the insteumentation rules on this album huh? anyway great lyrics and delivery too

**popularsong** (10): ik  ilook like a hypocrite for slamming selfish soul for being short but it works here!!! also leads up well to the next song

**ReallyCreative** (10): in this moment I am euphoric, enlightened by my own slaytelligence

**throwaway-7650** (10): EDD stands for everybody danced (& died)

**welcome2thejam** (10): Ugh those horns into the gorgeous synths I am ascending (literally, I'm scoring this song while my flight is taking off)

**UselessTacooo** (9.7): TELL ME YOUR DEFEATEDD AND ILL BE HAPPYYYYYYYYYYYYYY WITH THAAT

**Ambrosia42** (9): This one seems to be about being close with someone and doing a lot of things for them, but they aren‚Äôt appreciative and won‚Äôt return the favor or have your back in the same way. And it gets to a point where you wish the person would just be rude and mean so you had more of a concrete reason to end the friendship. The production builds up to something quite stunning at the end.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): The bridge is sooo good.

**bogo** (9): this song could make me levitate 10 feet into the air if i put my mind to it it just has that power

**CrimsonROSET** (9): always stand with the hoes

**imbaby122** (9): tell me you don‚Äôt want me and i‚Äôll be happy is such an insane line and so real.

**oh\_crow** (9): The way I transcend to I'M SO LOYULLLL to these HOOOOOEEES

**qazz23** (9): love the horn section and how it picks up at the end

**Stryxen** (9): catch it shygirl

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): eating dysfunction disorder

**shipperondeck** (8.2): it blossoms really prettily :D

**Mandeemoo007** (8): Love the ending climax to the track, but also a good cool down from the heat shes been putting out

**plastichaxan** (8): Playing at the alt club every night yup yup

**vayyiqra** (8): The drums on this are so understated yet also rule üéª

**afs** (7.5): edp ended

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Kinda weirdly abrupt ending!

**vexastrae** (7.5): this bitch unemployment needs to get off my back NOW

### these hoes aint

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7.4): This doesn't really do anything for me

**Poydoo** (7.3): these hoes ARE loyal

**runaway3212** (7): her talking about how she's loyal combined with how she's loyal she's so me coded

**prettybirbkotori** (6.5): double d is cool and all but i feel like eddy is the loyal one

**beeozan** (5): ok this second half is one of the rare moments in this album that dont work for me at all

**lexiaredery** (5): Nothing's really happening

**xophrys** (5): Me when Ed and Eddy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): its kinda a nothing song

**IIIHenryIII** (3): and that‚Äôs a skip

**moonagenightmares** (3): at least it was short

For as pussy as the both of them are this really feels like wasted potential. It's a very dreamy early 00s R&B track with modern production, but leans more cheesy for me than anything. Quite glad this just fell short of day 2

**RandomHypnotica** (10): sounds exactly like a crush feels

**ReallyCreative** (10): the collabpse...

**runaway3212** (10): Okay why did this slay so much

**welcome2thejam** (10): Now this is a teamup that hit its mark, beautiful track

**flava** (9.5): ok but why wasnt this on the main album

**shipperondeck** (9.5): the second half of this is just wow wow wow

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): we love a WRITER! stream NewJeans - ETA

**phonethephoenix** (9): nice song!:)

**afs** (8.5): crushed

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): this is a lot of falalalaing and its not even christmas

**Ambrosia42** (8.3): Not super catchy or anything, but the layered sounds are quite beautiful. The lyrics are pretty straight forward, but I don‚Äôt mind that at all. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a little crush / everything you do is just too much.‚Äù Like, that‚Äôs real

**bogo** (8): i'm floating

**Mandeemoo007** (8): Pretty track, prefer slutty  Shygirl though

**oh\_crow** (8): Beautiful, but maybe a little too straighforward to have landed on the original album. This instrumental is so so pretty and detailed

**uiscebeathaoir** (8): im impressed she managed to get such a good build into a sub 3 minute song

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Wait hold on‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm seeing colors‚Ä¶

**Nagisoid** (7.5): She wants to be Ethel Cain SOOOOOOOO bad

**vexastrae** (7.5): this is so serial experiments lain coded to me

**CallMeIsmail\_** (7): Probably the best of the more atmospheric songs so far but I'd still rather just listen to instrumental electronic/ambient music

**CrimsonROSET** (7): she dada my dada til i dada?

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): sorry, but there‚Äôs only one song worthy of that title, and it‚Äôs by MOTHER

**cremeebrulee** (6.3): it sounds like the beginning stages of a crush i‚Äôll give it that

**thedoctordances1940** (6.1): there are some clashes here that don't work but the underlying song isn't really bad

**freeofblasphemy** (6): Yeah whatever it‚Äôs fine

**UselessTacooo** (5): I feel like I‚Äôm in a dreamscape and it‚Äôs making me even more tired of the album

**oscarbrierley1** (4): i hate the melody on this, it sounds like shes off key half the time

### fine damn omfg ill check out erika's music

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Highly highly recommend Erika‚Äôs album ‚ÄúEssentials!‚Äù I checked it out a few weeks ago and it is an absolute chill bop buffet.

**kappyko** (10): Well it appears she did in fact be erika de casier

**qazz23** (10): love Erika de Casier, there's a dreamy sound to this and it really picks up in the second half

**xophrys** (9.3): love Erika De Casier just not on this song

**nt96** (9): free pillows and blankets for those sleeping on Erika de Casier.

**vayyiqra** (9): Very pretty! Getting very into *Sensational* lately ! rate when ü¶ã

**Stryxen** (8): we need the rochelle erika whoever else I can't rember rn rate

**imbaby122** (9): this is like so wholesome?? woah?! i really like it, the vocals are making me ascend to a different astral plane.

**sarcasticsobs** (7): Stream *Essentials*, you cowards

### vote 4 reality rumble

**prettybirbkotori** (7): of all the songs called crush i've heard... david archuleta's is still the best but this is ok too
