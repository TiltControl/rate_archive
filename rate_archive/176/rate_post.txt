2022 Alt Club Rate (Sudan Archives/Kilo Kish/Shygirl)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/13ydnm4/2022_alt_club_rate_sudan_archiveskilo_kishshygirl/

Hello popheads, or at least the 80 of you who actively do rates, and welcome to the [Alt Club Girls](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1003402543499575419/1113560825714716732/IMG_2189.jpg) Rate. Now you may be wondering "King, what is alt club?" and my answer to you is: I don't know. Alt Club is kind of just a genre I made up!! But club and dance music obviously has an extensive history and it covers a whole range of sounds, and these albums all solidly fit under that umbrella. One thing (for me) that unites these albums, other than being three of my favourites from 2022, is their maximalism: Sudan, Kilo and Shygirl are all mixed media artists who have a clear creative vision for their work and these albums and eras are what they created when they were free of any societal or genre confinement. 

Another thing the three of them having common is being black artists in alternative spaces, and how that reflects itself in their music. I think highlighting that they are black does a lot for representation and allowing people to see themselves in these genres, but on the flipside seeing someone only as a 'black artist' can be limiting, and these projects expertly break free of those labels and restrictions. These albums dance from genre to genre like they're going through themed rooms in a nightclub, and I'm so excited for everyone who loves them to get a chance to talk about them, and everyone who is unfamiliar to fall in love with them!

*- Selfish Soul*

One of the primary themes of *Natural Brown Prom Queen* is homecoming; Sudan (who now lives in LA) is originally from Cincinatti, Ohio (area code [#513](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv_F9SwoYhs)), and spends a lot of the album tackling the idea of feeling at home or belonging and the restlessness of feeling in between two places. On the albums lead single [Home Maker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z5-ejzOouw) she sings about how she makes her apartment and home studio feel more homely, and compares it to feeling at home with someone you love. In fact, this album was entirely crafted in that home studio over lockdown, with Sudan self producing almost the whole thing. The project is much more electronic than her previous album (the earthy [*Athena*](https://open.spotify.com/album/2Q37zGSPMHW0wck1cMtdbd?si=UqIlsADySKOiiipdhM8-HQ)) but is still rooted very firmly in the same sentiments and style, and of course the same brilliant violin work that Sudan is known for woven throughout.  

Another thread across the album is Sudan saying things that people are afraid to say, or doing things she might not be supposed to. [Milk Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fElHcuKeNw) gets outrageously horny, with Sudan singing "your finger up my pussy like a honey stick" over such ethereal production that the subject matter might slip right by you. Sudan tackles her identity as a black women throughout, writing about the colorism she faces being darkskin, or about how her hair ties into her self-worth and other's perception of her on [Selfish Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaY8kI0oEpA). Ultimately this album is a lot about her reinventing her image and putting her blackness at the forefront.

> If I wanted you there goes my end  

*- ATTENTION POLITICIAN*

If I were to sum Kilo up as an artist in one word it would be chameleon. Each body of work Kilo's put out, whether it be music, fashion or art, has been an evolution, but not along one linear path. *AMERICAN GURL* isn't her finale, it's just a representation of where she is at now. The album is the embodiement of a candy store or an arcade, where the album's narrative takes place, sickeningly sweet synthy chaos with deceptively dark lyrical themes of consumerism and tackling what it means to be American looming underneath. On the albums' [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_m12MnS85k) she sings *"In a locked box, in a locked draw, will I find me an American Girl"*, immediately jumping into the idea that as a black artist she doesn't identify with the idea of an 'american girl' that is presented to us, instead that her own american girl is locked up inside of her. On my personal favourite bonus track [Star Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftYSaaNOMzI), Kilo tackles fame and trying to make it in LA, and how endless that feels. Kilo ponders the idea that in such a capatlist world we consume so many different things, when you strip that all away, what of that actually is you?

The album couldn't be more of a 180 from her debut album six years prior, [*Reflections in Real Time*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5n9x1TanZHQSDd5Q0EOqlW?si=UlVpiZY4T2WBVAWI85kgag), an alternative r&b and indie album that is equal parts manifesto and intimate diary. Where in her previous work she opted for minimalism, now is the time for all out maximalism. The use of bright, campy consumerism and Americanism allows Kilo to reflect on fears that are both unanimous and extremely personal: Am I pretty enough? Am I good enough? Why can't I do what somebody else is doing?

[*"That's the theme of American Gurl — exploring that I am a product of my environment and these are the things that have been put on me in this time so far."*](https://www.okayplayer.com/originals/kilo-kish-american-gurl-interview.html)

> Yeah it's you that I'm thinking of when I'm feelin' hot  
> Your voice dripping like honey straight from the honey pot  
> Don't stop running on my mind, I can't get enough  
> Is it so bad to just like to be touched?

*- Shlut*

*Nymph* is actually a very different debut from Shygirl than what we could've got - she more or less made a record over lockdown, in a similar vein to her fan favourite ep [*ALIAS*](https://open.spotify.com/album/3lpcZOAsYJzvPepNSbzMSb?si=UgjC10aeRGKA2UArmIHdWA), but felt like it was too easy. *"If I don't give myself that space to myself, no one is! No one's gonna expect me to do anything else."*  and thank god she did give herself that challenge, because Nymph is the perfect evolution of Shygirl's character and sound. Taking strong influence from 00's garage and r&b, tracks like the lead [Firefly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEmWsCJzIs4) bring the sound into the 2020's with added hyperpop flourishes. Much like Sudan and Kilo, Shygirl is very much a sole visionary, but she has a star studded team of producers behind her to help bring her vision to life consisting of Bloodpop, Danny L Harle, Mura Masa and longtime collaborator and friend Sega Bodega. Album opener [Woe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNxTt8KS_2I) is a haunting telling of fame and expectations, with Shygirl singing "When will you see it from my side?". I actually saw Shygirl at the tail end of last year at Printworks in London, which if you're unfamiliar, was a sweaty, gay warehouse used for all kinds of raves and gigs, and I truly can't imagine a setting where Shygirl's music is better suited.

Shygirl also is on a mission to reclaim her own body from everyday misogyny, with [Coochie (a bedtime story)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsJi7OQBJYA) being a playful, nursery rhyme esque track about women's bodies and battling the idea that they are weird or undesirable. But of course the overarching theme and imagery of the album is that of a woodland nymph, inspired by romanticism work like Thomas Hardy's *Tess of the D’Urbervilles*. Nymph as a record is not an attempt to rebrand Shygirl's image, but add depth to it - she can be a provocative, industrial rapper just as well as she can be an ethereal, sensitive artist, and there's no need to limit herself to one or the other.

[*“When I think of a nymph, I feel an affinity to the ethos of that character – I have felt beguiling, fascinating, mysterious, supernatural and also part of nature. You don’t see people like me in these stories, and I have as much right as anyone else.”*](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/shygirl-interview-2022)

# Rules

Most of you know all of this, but if you don’t, **please** read this!! And if you then still have any questions about the rate process or the formatting of your ballot or anything, feel free to ask away :D 

- You must listen to and submit a score for every song, **ballots with missing scores will not be accepted and you will be asked to submit a score**

- **Each song must be scored between a 1 and a 10 (with exception of an optional 0 and 11).** Scores are allowed to one decimal point but no further, meaning you are allowed to score something a 5.5 or a 9.7, but a 5.42 or 9.75 *will* make the rate machine act all goofy so please don’t. ^(Also please make sure to use periods and not commas for any decimal places)

- Your **11** and **0** are reserved for one song each in the whole rate. You aren’t obligated to use either of them at all, but **they are fun to use**

- Please [*please*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RoxNxt6oI4) **use the message format linked in this post**, and if that doesn’t work, just use [**this backup pastebin ballot**](https://pastebin.com/Uu7wJrLy) and send it to me with that.

- If you want to change any of your scores after you submit them, **message me on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Awkward_King&subject=&message=) or discord (king!#2326)**. So long as it is before the final due date that should be okay :)

- **Your scores are not considered confidential**, you are free to talk about them once you have submitted them (you are also free to keep it all to yourself til your reveal) ~~meaning I am also allowed to publicly drag the bad ballots I get~~

- Including comments in your ballot is not mandatory, however if you do include any they **must be formatted like this**:

> FLUE: 10 me when i sneeze ✅

Any other formats will simply be rejected, such as:

> Ciara: 4**,** does anyone think capitalism is a good thing? i love ciara i think she's a really interesting artist ❌

> ATTENTION POLITICIAN: **(**9.5**)** what is joe biden's plan to fix this ❌

> Nike: 0 **-** he told me Nike just tank it (please don't tank Nike) ❌

- You can also leave album comments, but if you do, **make sure you put a colon at the end of the album title**, for example:

> Album: Nymph**:** for a shy girl she doesn't seem to be very shy

- Finally, and this one should be obvious, **do not sabotage/tank an album for petty reasons**. If you just prefer one album to the others that is completely okay! As long as your ballot seems fair and like you've genuinely given them a chance and justified your possibly controversial scores in your comments. I may ask you to provide further comments/raise your average if I think you are sabotaging, but that is only in dire circumstances.

---

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask!! Rate is \*tentatively* due on **FRIDAY 21ST JULY**
