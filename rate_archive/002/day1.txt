#notes

**a few people’s ratings were so far biased in one artist’s direction compared to everyone else’s that they weren’t counted due to fucking up all the ratings so badly**

^^looking ^^at ^^you, ^^Gaga ^^stans ^^:/

therefore, if your 11 and 0 don't show up, i'm really sorry, but I made a choice not to include your scores :( some of your comments might be included, though.

**also a few people were actually like, “man this Katy song is pop perfection, but I’ll give it a 6 because I fucking hate Katy”. smfh guys.**

last note: the highest and lowest scores shown for each song are the people whose scores were in the top 2 values for those categories. for example, if the highest scores for a song are 9 and 8, then all the people who gave a 9 and 8 will be listed.

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lOLLs9QxRY) - I can make no better joke than just linking the song tbh

The one positive thing about this rating is that despite being in 62nd place, out of 62 songs, this song still was over a point higher than Bad Blood in the last rating. However, it placed in the top ten most controversial songs, and it’s still really bad.

So… yikes... this song is just a complete mess. It’s probably the only song in human history to use the word “vag” and make a reference to Hooked On Phonics. It also may be the worst song Max Martin has ever helped produce? I’ll leave that call up to you.

I might as well get straight to your comments on this, because they sum this song up a lot better than I can. Wailordfan says, “This is literally garbage. Hot steaming garbage. I mean, it’s interesting to hear a song sung about a relationship that isn't sexual enough from a girl, especially from that time. It isn't a bad idea, but it seriously sucks.” It’s true that she had a lot of balls to release this song in the first place (get it?) but the song ended up really missing the mark. huntyphobic says: “This song is so bad that it’s still bad”. BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU brings up a valid point, the fact that the song reinforces toxic masculinity, which really just plain sucks. superr_rad agrees, saying “blehhhhhhhhhh subtle misogyny is still misogyny”. Finally, mother_rucker thinks that “It's an okay-sounding song, but it gives me a ‘guys shouldn't have emotions’/’being emotional is weak and feminine’ vibe and I hate that.”

**smh Kesha, you should be better than this.**

"The problem I have with the song is that it uses misogynistic language to describe that the man he dated is weak and feminine. It’s really disappointing. With that being said, the production of the song is fucking good that I have to consider this song a “problematic fave” of mine lol."

deleted: #61 – The One That Got Away (Acoustic)
Average: 4.780
Controversy score: 2.832

Highest scores (11 x1): NapsAndNetflix (10 x2): Kaphox, amumumyspiritanimal

Lowest scores (0 x3): spacebabe27, Wailordfan, Nerdy_boy_chris (1 x7): goldenretrieverz, lexfirth, letsallpoo, mustangs16, Raykel, PuggleMaster, mindnoises

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTNfPdqxuC8)

Katy’s voice just isn’t good enough to carry an acoustic track. At least not this one. Upon listening, lexfirth said, “don’t insult me like this katy”, while letsallpoo proclaimed, “does NOT have the range”. BionicFunhouse is much more positive about the song, but still manages to shade Katy: “Still lovely. She doesn’t sound like a mom screaming at her kids here :)”. NapsAndNetflix attempts to justify their 11: “just about any song in an acoustic rendition makes it better imo so this was a given”. *That’s* debatable. mother_rucker, despite being one of the most positive raters, gives a 6 and says “This song didn't need an acoustic version”. spacebabe27 was way harsher: “I don't have to justify my zero with a comment, this sucks”. 

**The rest of /r/popheads seems to agree there.**

This song is just not good, ughhhhh. The beat doesn’t really go anywhere, the lyrics are full of Bible references (which is fine, but you have to do that in an interesting way), the hook is weak as fuck. Overall a complete dud, and the only true filler song on the original Teenage Dream.

Y’all were pretty brutal about this one, and I’d say very accurate overall. melisanyans was unimpressed, saying “limp”. lexfirth gives it a solid 8, but also calls it “Rise (Demo Version).” NapsAndNetflix, who was already destroyed by the placement of their 11, didn’t really care much about this one and could “see the writing on the wall for how low this will place tbh”. MrSwearword accused the beat of being a knockoff “My Love” by JT and T.I., and gave it a ridiculously specific 2.3. OberionSynth liked the beat but thinks that the song “deserves a better vocalist”.

**Most succinctly, soeri uses their 0 and says, “No.”**

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: Igotchu:

"This is probably Katy’s most Christian song in this album. Lol. I had this weird connection to this song. One of things I relate about Katy is that we grew up in a strictly religious household and we both had this struggle before of living our lives as Christians or as secularists or both. I believe both Katy and I went through the secular life. If I recall, Katy said while she does not label herself as a Christian anymore, she does however believe there is a higher God somewhere. As much as I can act being an Atheist and say I don’t label myself to any other religion, I do believe there is some higher God up there too. We may never know."

Katy just can’t win with you people, can she? Her songs that are supposed to be inspirational are too boring, and her songs that are just meant to be fun, suck. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. This placed 2nd in the controversy rankings with a score of 3.119, which means that people typically gave it either an 8 or 2. You guys are all over the place, but the haters won.

This disparity means that there’s a very wide range in the comments for this song. First, the good: melisanyans was aware of how controversial it would be, but loved it, saying “Probably going to get last but I just love it so much. Katy Perry showing a little bit of personality, or love of cock, same thing.” chubs4life calls it a “guilty pleasure”. lexfirth calls it “Like a Virgin for the autotune era and I’m here for it”. NapsAndNetflix is amicable af: “It's pretty silly but there's worse out there.” OberionSynth has a similar sentiment: “This is my thot song, though I'll admit it isn't very good. The repetition of "cock cock cock" is something I only want to hear in my bedroom. Though I think the verses and bridge are on point, even though they're pretty ridic.” Nerdy_boy_chris is very positive about the song: “Wow Katy, this song is me. She's basically begging for the dick, which I can relate to. But the song is also good fun, and I'm sure it I'll be in my head forever.” huntyphobic says that the song is “Absolutely tragic but in the best way” Yay? Go, Katy?

Now for the negatives (and there were a lot of them). letsallpoo says that this song is “The main reason why critics didn’t take this album seriously, because Katy didn’t seem to be taking herself seriously.” MrSwearword likens the lyrics to Grindr messages (idk if that’s a positive thing to say or not). mother_rucker just says, “lol this song does not deserve to be on this album. or any album.” superr_rad just says [“NO”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMTAUr3Nm6I). Raykel analyzes the song in context of the album: “This is awful considering the song before this track is one of body acceptance and personal empowerment, but in this song she's calling a guy a chicken boy for not showing her his (pea)cock.” Despite a rating of 9, this song brings up bad memories for hellomochi: : “Super catchy even if it brings back a cringeworthy memory of when I used this to audition for a dance club (I didn't get in).” We’re sorry :(. Mudkip1 gives the song a 1 and says, “m e s s y song although my gay ass can’t help but shake to it”. Funny how people with nearly identical comments gave the song 8 and above.

**Best summary of this song? BionicFunhouse – 5 – “Hilarious and hilariously bad”.**

Compared to the last few songs, this one gets a decent bump up in terms of score. Nothing major like the last rate thread where Bad Blood and WTNY were just shat on and everything else was MUCH higher, but a bigger leap nonetheless. This is actually the least controversial song on Teenage Dream. Everyone can agree that it’s just sort of… there.

leafsnash61: “Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz”

Wailordfan: “The lyricism doesn't make sense. It makes more sense to say she is a pearl now, rather than she was one. She is being held back by a man, her clam, keeping her stuck behind him.”

hellomochi: “I get what she's trying to accomplish here but some of the metaphors don't work.”

**The most telling thing about this song is the fact that barely anyone commented on it compared to some of the other songs.**

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0)

Although I like this song just because I think the original is perfect, the general consensus on this song is that it’s simply unnecessary. Missy’s voice is autotuned af for no reason. They got rid of the G O D T I E R sax bridge.

whatsapilot basically completely sums up how I personally feel about the song, saying “I love Missy Elliott, but her appearance her just doesn't work for me. Overall, the remix is just not as good as the original for me. It’s not terrible, though, and I already love Last Friday Night anyway, so 8.5 it is” (I gave it an 8). soeri says “Missy Elliot deserved better” but superr_rad thinks that she was the one who dragged down the song: “Missy's feature is wack.” goldenretrieverz asks “WHERE THE F— DID THE SAX GO”. Don’t worry fam, you’re allowed to curse.

You know those people that think all pop music is manufactured, autotuned garbage? This is the song they’re thinking of when they say that. This song *is* better than Kesha’s other collab with 3OH!3 (god, what a fucking terrible group name), My First Kiss, which has an obnoxious video on top of everything else that’s wrong with the song. But that doesn’t really redeem it.

Even whatsapilot, Queen of Positivity™, says that “it’s *too* trashy, even for Kesha standards… But it still gets a 5 because, you know, ‘just show me where your dick’s at’”. soeri would have given this a higher rating “if it weren't for.... them” (It’s taking a lot of willpower to not just turn this write-up into a 3øh???3 roast sesh). Therokinrolla just says “fuck this shit”. batmanji just says, “kesh... no...”

This song is just *dripping* in autotune. The hook honestly gives me [history of japan](https://youtu.be/Mh5LY4Mz15o?t=6m3s) vibes. Despite that, I think the hook has a pretty nice melody. Your thoughts were all over the place for this one.

deleted: #53 – Dressin’ Up
Average: 5.556
Controversy score: 2.359

Highest scores (10 x3): OberionSynth, SkyBlade79, Ventriloquy (9 x2): FuckUpSomeCommasYeah, Kaphox

Lowest scores (0 x1): goldenretrieverz (1 x1): eykitsa

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_u6RCIfe80) 

Well, I finally had a song that I was in the “highest scores” group for, get eliminated. I love the hook, I love the general theme, the song is sexy af. My only problem, and it’s a big problem, is the first verse. “You want to pet my kitty / You’re such a dirty doggy” completely lacks subtlety and is just a generally wack line that always takes me out of enjoying the song. I think it could have been a huge single if that verse was changed – and if one of the Part Of Me / Wide Awake pair wasn’t made a single. I wouldn’t describe 2012 Katy as “overexposed” on the radio but it doesn’t help that both of those are fairly generic in theme. Dressin’ Up is slightly more edgy for Katy and I think would have been received even better by the general public. /rant

goldenretrieverz: “Throwin' Up.” damn. :(

NapsAndNetflix: “It's pretty sweet, but a forgettable pop anthem. The lyrics are less than stellar.” That’s fair.

MrSwearword: “5.8 - generous scoring for not kinkshaming the sexual roleplaying community.” She’s not just “not kinkshaming”, she’s openly praising the concept of roleplay, fam. But thanks for giving this your third highest Katy score.

OberionSynth: “Fell in love almost immediately. Probably the best song on the album actually.” High praise.

Nerdy_boy_chris: “I'm definitely putting this on my ‘Getting ready to get the dick’ playlist.” If I had one, it’d be on mine too.

**We’re done with the bottom 10! Comments? Questions? Suggestions? Concerns? Is my Katy bias *too* obvious? Also, now do you see how unfairly Gaga stans rated everything? She hasn’t had a song eliminated yet!**

Finally, the first Gaga song that gets eliminated. Money Honey is a song that continues The Fame (Monster)’s theme of celebrity culture and vanity. This song is actually a harmless bop but doesn’t really stand out on the album.

SkyBlade79: “such an average uninnovative song imo”

huntyphobic: “It’s kind of like just dance, except it’s bad.”

We’ve reached the most controversial song in the entire rate, guys. A typical score for this song was approximately either a 9 or a 2. Great job, guys. You’re so in sync with each other. This song, in my humble opinion, is such a disaster. The general concept of the song is fine. The idea of a song where she shames old men for being creepy sounds like quintessential Kesha. The only problem is she spells out “dinosaur” in the hook and the song has no structure and she does not have the range. Of course, you guys had a much wider range of opinions regarding this song.

Mudkip1: “MESSY AS FUCK”

whatsapilot: “I wanna hate this but I kinda love it help me”

hellomochi: “This song makes me laugh every time. Sounds a bit like Peacock.” Hey, that’s an insult to Peacock.

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: “This song is, my god, just bad. The production is also pretty bad in Max Martin and Shellback’s terms. Like for a producing duo that knows how to make bops, this song feels like it’s made by a producer who used Audacity to produce this song for a shitpost video. I don’t like to give songs a 0. But this song is just goddamn awful.”

Raykel: “Guilty pleasure.”

huntyphobic: “Oh my god this is so funny and bad im screaming!!!!”

marcryan: “I didn’t need a spelling lesson on dinosaurs”

MrSwearword: “kinkshaming Lana Del Rey and her fans for liking older men is petty as hell” – damn Lana fans, are you just gonna take that?

**Maybe Kesha should make a song where she spells out “this song sucks”.**

Songs from The Fame getting eliminated before songs from The Fame Monster is going to become a recurring theme. This one is decent but also has several issues. Maybe Gaga shouldn’t have sung “filter that, baby, bump that track” on the hook so many times, because the filter used on the hook is really annoying and weird. The Space Cowboy feature doesn’t help (also literally who is Space Cowboy?). This song is also basically a combination of three different hooks considering the second verse is repeated twice and the intro is repeated as the bridge. For the positives, that second verse is really cute. Also, she’s the queen of Beats product placement. Also, Flo Rida manages to not suck here??? His verse isn’t anything special, but it works very well for  a featured rap verse on a pop song.

Of course, it wouldn’t be a rate thread without everyone else totally disagreeing with me. TeamAwesome4 *hated* Flo Rida’s verse, saying “Had a decent thing going, then Florida’s biggest embarrassment showed up. Nobody overdoses on Starbucks. Idiot.” soeri adds to the Flo Rida hate: “Y'all remember the dark days when Flo Rida was a thing?” I hate to break it to you, but My House went 3x platinum and peaked at #4 *last year*. We’re *living* in those dark days. Raykel’s dislike of the song is due to a variety of reasons, and Flo Rida’s only a tiny part of their reasoning: “Dated. Bad rapper. And what is she doing with her voice? ‘I'm so stAaArstruck.’ It's like the autotune made her crack on purpose and it didn't turn out well.”

**leafsnash61 would be very disappointed to see all this Flo Rida hate.**

FWIW, Space Cowboy is like Avicii but slightly more relevant even considering his only other notable work was some throwaway shit with Chelsea Korka AKA 3rd place from a CW vanity project for the Pussycat Dolls *AND* "lead" singer of a failed group called Paradiso Girls.

[Listen here](https://youtu.be/pO007Bx1Uak?t=1m21s)

Not Like The Movies is a ballad about the kind of dramatic, “perfect” love you see in movies and how Katy hasn’t ever experienced that. It’s decent, but slow songs don’t really suit Katy. It didn’t make a good ending to the original Teenage Dream album. This is actually the first song to avoid receiving a 1 or 0.

lexfirth says something I’m unwilling to say but sadly agree with: “god her ballads are just ALL SO SHIT”. Awhile2 really likes a specific part: “7 - this song gets 2 points alone for the moment when the drums come in”. NapsAndNetflix says, “Almost got my 11. Almost. I genuinely can see no flaws in this song.” #yikes. batmanji, always happy to trash Katy, comes in with the bantz: “this song sounds like an adele reject, except they forgot to make the vocal range smaller for katy”. hellomochi drops some #realtalk: “When I saw the title, I was expecting the use of more cinematic imagery but it came up short - for some reason she used fairy tale metaphors. Hannah Montana's "If We Were A Movie" does it better (I'm serious).”

"An excellent closer to an album full of bops. I love the cinematic and dramatic vibe of this song. It’s too bad I see this song in a different way now than I used to when it came out. It’s such a sweet song about Katy and Russell Brand’s relationship. I am pretty sure their break-up actually really made me sad unlike other celebrity break-ups. RIP Perry x Brand.

In this song, Katy attempts to essentially write a diss track against ex-boyfriend Travie McCoy and describes how his drug use ended the relationship (thanks, Rap Genius, for this convenient summary I paraphrased). She sort of goes for a pop-rock, Kelly Clarkson vibe here? I actually quite like this song, but a lot of you didn’t, and I can still sort of see why.

gannade: “Katy can’t do pop rock like Kelly. Vocal ability not quite there.”

bruinbearr: “Emo Katy just doesn't work tbh”

Nerdy_boy_chris: “I'm kinda digging the actual rock vibes as opposed to pure pop, but I'm not a fan of the production on her voice”

> “C U Next Tuesday” is the name of this song for a reason – she’s calling who she’s talking about a “cunt”, if you turn the song-title into an acronym. Nice way to get around getting a Parental Advisory Explicit Lyrics sticker put forth on your album. Ke$ha is singing about this guy she’s upset with because he has a girlfriend already and keeps leading Ke$ha on.

I think this song is a weird closer to the album, although I guess I shouldn’t judge the Cannibal version the same way as Animal. I sort of do like the song, but the vocal effect she uses ruins it for me. The users of /r/popheads, likewise, had very different opinions on a) if the song was good and b) if the title was hilarious and endearing or the lamest thing ever.

goldenretrieverz: “2, I'd give it a 1 but bonus points for CUNT”

Highest scores (10 x3): MrSwearword, Awhile2, soeri (9.3 x1): spacebabe27

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mktlac3D7H0)

Brown Eyes is a pretty beautiful sounding song that I only just started to appreciate. Gaga sings about a former lover and the thing about him she’ll miss the most. It’s very rock-influenced – no synths. That means it’s a lot slower than most Gaga songs, and this turned out to be a controversial choice.

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: “Love me some slower Gaga but the lyrics are pretty bland. Thing is that this song was written in 2006 so Gaga probably is still learning her ropes on the songwriting department.”

letsallpoo: “Good at the time, but Gaga’s outdone this several times at this point.”

bruinbearr: “Foreshadowing to Gaga's Tony Bennett era. It was here all along, we should have seen it coming”

whatsapilot: “pretty boring and gets old really fast tbh”

> I Like It Rough is a song written by Lady Gaga and Martin Kierszenbaum, for her debut album, The Fame, sometime between 2007-2008. The song was first released as a bonus track for the Canadian/Australian edition, and later became a standard track on other releases of the album. The song was written about addiction and in particular being in love with people that are not good for you.

NapsAndNetflix: “Sounds like a rejected Britney song tbh”

Boys Boys Boys, which was supposed to be the 6th single off of The Fame until The Fame Monster dropped earlier than expected, is possibly the Gay Anthem to end all Gay Anthems. Most people were pretty meh on the actual quality of the song, though.

bruinbearr: “Awful verses, but the chorus almost redeems the song. Not lyrically. Just melodically.”

Nerdy_boy_chris: “My gay ass is SHOOK. How relatable”

Raykel: “I don't like it. It's tacky, she put no thought into the lyrics, "I like you a lot, lot / Think you're really hot, hot" and the "we love them" line is annoying. But somehow I fucking LOOOVE IT.” well that doesn’t really make sense but ok ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

TeamAwesome4: “This whole song seems like it should be Kesha’s, right down to ‘You taste just like glitter mixed with rock and roll.’” Yeah, that’s actually… very valid. I see it.

**The song in the link ⬆️  is better tbh.**

Average: 6.190
Controversy score: 2.317

Highest scores (10 x5): letsallpoo, NapsAndNetflix, mother_rucker, Nerdy_boy_chris, hellomochi (9 x3): mustangs16, ExtraEater, bruinbearr

Lowest scores (1 x1): MrSwearword (2 x1): eykitsa

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5Nvi99zq6E)

Maybe Katy should stop taking metaphors too far. Hummingbird Heartbeat is a song in which Katy talks about fucking a dude, and starts with the absolute bombshell of an opening line that is “You make me feel like I'm losing my virginity”. She also manages to use the phrase “let’s pollinate” and liken cum to honey. This is also made more unsettling by the fact that she’s singing about [this guy](http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2011/10/05/1226159/630909-russell-brand.jpg). Anyway, don’t let any of what I said fool you, this song is lit and it should be higher up. But on the other hand, ignore everything I say, as I am slightly biased.

Opinions were, of course, all over the place about this song.

chubs4life: “this should've been a single!” I don’t think that imagery would have gone over well on the radio, tbqh.

MrSwearword: “’some call it science/we call it chemistry’…it’s all science, bitch.”

mother_rucker: “"You make me feel like I'm losing my virginity" is an a m a z i n g first line.”

OberionSynth: “Lmao this is ridiculous” Yeah that’s pretty much the best description of it.

TeamAwesome4: “I can really get behind the production in this song, but I cannot stand the rest of it. Nobody should ever describe sex with the Birds and Bees metaphor trying to be sexy. The entire point of that is to avoid mentioning sex altogether, but she goes out of her way to talk about virginity, a topic that’s inherently sexual, in her first line. Also, Katy decided mentioning his honey in the chorus wasn’t frequent enough, so she decided to add another reference to his sticky sweet in the verses.”

batmanji: “sigh... katy loves taking the metaphors in her songs too far instead of actually putting emotional content into them”

**I could make another annoying and obvious joke about how I’m jealous of the dude Katy is with, but I’m better than that. Wait… I guess I’m not.**

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWrQz7Tw1Qs) 
In this song, Gaga sings about not wanting to sign a major-label contract that might be shitty and force her to only think about money when creating. It is definitely less of a danceable song than the major hits off of The Fame (Monster).

huntyphobic: “The autotune on this song is so messy, and the pacing + singing is absolutely tragic”

bruinbearr: “AGAIN WITH THE SHIT AUTOTUNE. It doesn't work for Gaga, that's Ke$ha's territory.”

MrSwearword: “a bit of a dip quality-wise, but has some interesting production”
