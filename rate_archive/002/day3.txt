Nerdy_boy_chris: “That sax solo is absolutely incredible”

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: “This is probably my favorite party song of all-time and I will never get tired of this song. This song showcases Katy’s sense of humor that is refreshing from other pop stars. The song’s iconic music video makes the song much better and more memorable for me.”

As soon as Commas reaches Top 15, we will be playing songs that are eliminated from there including the link Commas gave and other videos related to the song's title.

As soon as the rate reveals are over, we are gonna continue Straight Anthems Night!

deleted: so people have been intermittently asking us mods "how can I do a rate thread in 2017?"

and the answer is:

* make sure you're prepared with an idea of 3 albums that make sense to rate together

* don't use an album that you don't like, or you'll be heartbroken when it does better than the ones that you do

* be very active on the sub throughout this year
[/r/popheads/comments/5772nl/rate_results_teenage_dream_vs_the_fame_monster_vs/d8pkmrc/]

TeamAwesome4: Might I propose also being able to use 3 albums you hate to death?  That way, you won't care about results.  Also, comedy instead of drama.

bruinbearr: “Solidified her status as queen of the summer”

leafsnash95: “Massive feel good song. I love everything except for Snoop Dogg’s verse. Perhaps I’m going against the hivemind, but it’s a lazy verse. The song would be so much better without it. It adds nothing but run-time in my opinion. Does it stop me from singing it when I hear it on the radio? Hell no. As for the music video… ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)”

Therokinrolla: “okay this song has something about it that makes it super good. There is less autotune than most of her songs and the production is actually through the roof”

TeamAwesome4: “This song is like a cult. It’s fun while it lasts, but then it’s over and you think, who the FUCK would partake in that willingly? The very definition of a guilty pleasure.”

OberionSynth: “i'm a hoe”

whatsapilot: “almost all of these Kesha songs are meant to be fun, and this one does it the best. It’s one of catchiest tracks in the album, actually one of catchiest songs I’ve ever heard. If I hadn’t given my 11 to Lady Gaga, I would have given it to Take It Off. It was a pretty big hit but honestly it deserved better.”

SkyBlade79: “don’t like the male voice samples, but I love the production”

huntyphobic: “Honestly I love this song so much. That intro is amazing, it gives me chills every time I hear it, and the rest of the song is catchy as hell. I think I love this song so much because it combines Gaga’s fun pop sound with her strangeness.”

TeamAwesome4: “This production and pre-chorus absolutely give me life. Get rid of the verses, get rid of the chorus, get rid of the hook. Just give me more of that pre-chorus. Maybe my favorite 15 seconds of noise I’ve ever heard.”

marcryan: “This should’ve been released as a single because it has such an amazing beat and infectious lyrics”

Therokinrolla: “Teenage Dream's prettier but lesser known sibling”

NapsAndNetflix: “How was this not a #1 hit wtf world get your shit together this is a certified bop that is also really sad at the same time? The June and Johnny Cash line is one of my favourite lines ever and I can't fully explain why? Maybe just because I really like Johnny Cash and they were cute. Also the makeup on old Katy in the video lol”

bruinbearr: “Love the thumping beat, love the melodies, love the lyrics, love it all”

Nerdy_boy_chris: “Will be forever pissed that this didn't hit number one, as it is the second-best song on the album, #JusticeforTOTGA.”

amumumyspiritanimal: That's what I'm saying. Gaga's songs are nowhere near the emotional level of TOTGA(maybe except Til It Happens To You, or something from Joanne). Katy is just an icon. I mean the sub loves to talk shit about Roar, but it's still was a huge hit with a great commercial success. Call me stans when Gaga gets a 1+ bil video.
[/r/popheads/comments/5772nl/rate_results_teenage_dream_vs_the_fame_monster_vs/d8q8hm8/]

=====

deleted: Um, I don't 100% agree with that either. 

I love Speechless, and think it is an amazing ballad, and Swine, Gypsy, and Dope from ARTPOP are all amazing more emotional songs to me, and prefer listening to them then most of Katy's stuff. Katy has amazing singles, but her other stuff is pretty generic imo. Her singles are great, but I think Gaga's singles are just as good.

It also doesn't kinda help that Katy barely has a voice, Gaga could sing anything and I'd love it. 

But that's just me, I don't give Katy shit, even with a Taylor feud, but I don't love her really that much. Like, at all.

bruinbearr: “Honestly pop perfection.The precursor to RAWM”

whatsapilot: “this is pop perfection.”

hellomochi: “Perfect opening track. Perfect song with same name as album. Perfect song for summer. Perfectly evokes the nostalgic feeling of being a teenager in "love". Just perfect.”

Nerdy_boy_chris: “an iconic song and one of the best number one hits of the 2010s”

SkyBlade79: “it’s a classic”

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: “This is probably my favorite party song of all-time and I will never get tired of this song. This song showcases Katy’s sense of humor that is refreshing from other pop stars. The song’s iconic music video makes the song much better and more memorable for me.”

soeri: “The Quintissential pop song. The production is incredibe, Katy actually sounds good (sorrynotsorry) and the lyrics do a perfect job of conveying lighthearted fun and romance. When the 2000s become cool again, this will be the song edgy teenagers will go to to show how much better music was in 2009.”

mother_rucker: “It's the song that every other silly cute love song wishes it was.”

goldenretrieverz: “THE anthem. THE ultimate falling in love song. THE perfect pop song. When will some of these saxophone-ridden songs? Never. The 2010s just started and Katy already snatched the song of the decade.”

**The best song of all time makes a tragic early exit due to /r/popheads users' trash taste**

“Queen of saxophones.” - BreezySeason

Wow I’m so surprised this only got second. Really, I can’t express how shocked I am. (Forreal though, fantastic song and a fitting first loser for such an...interesting rate. If any song has the right to claim the title as the not winner of r/popheads’ first rate, it’s this.)

mother_rucker gives it their 11, saying it’s “the obvious choice but the only real choice.” KometBlu says, “That sax line works amazing as an intro to the album. They really fucked up by not making this the first single, a Till The World Ends tea.” At least that went top 10 hihi. breadvelvet has a confession to make: “the blaring saxophone actually turned me off the first time I heard it (something about the timbre feels off and a bit unnatural), but I grew to love it somehow. I think it’s definitely a ballsy intro track to the album and rousing, though I do wish the chorus melody moved around a bit more.”

>elxtreme just says “YES” and slaps down another 11. MrSwearword, on the other side of things, is shaking and crying once more: “THE MEMES IT CAUSED…THE MEMES…” angusaditus says he “loves it, but not that much,” and kickit gives y’all a lecture: “I don't see this song as the standout track /r/popheads wants it to be. I think anyone who wants to compare this to Teenage Dream or Blank Space or whatever is delusional and trying to pull an immaculate song off this great pop album and focusing on the wrong song anyway. I like this song, but I think it's sorely overrated.”

Regardless, TheAllRightGatsby calls it “the bop of a generation,” and jimmy345960 calls it “bae.” (???) Altiondsols throws a bit of shade, saying it’s “the only powerful opening track on any of these three albums.” Leave Moonlight out of this! JoeThaMo says, “Almost got my 11 but, just like with Bad Blood, it's gonna get enough attention from popheads even without my vote.” Well, you could say that again.

Nerdy_boy_chris: “Just a spectacular song, one of the best things Gaga's ever done”

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: “One of my Top 5 Lady Gaga songs and probably one of Gaga’s career-defining songs ever. What made this song memorable is its amazing production by RedOne as well as Gaga’s vocals. The bridge will always hype me whatever occasion it could be when I hear this song.”
