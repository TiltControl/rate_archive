[RATE] Teenage Dream vs. The Fame Monster vs. Animal + Cannibal
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/51ee8v/rate_teenage_dream_vs_the_fame_monster_vs_animal/

Welcome to the second September /r/popheads rate thread! Like [the previous rate thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/4xmic6/rate_1989_vs_emotion_vs_dangerous_woman/) by the GOAT /u/letsallpoo, we're going to all get together and score each song off of each of three albums (if you haven’t realized by now, I’m also copying /u/Altiondsols’s rate thread).

Rules are the same as the other rate threads, but here's a refresher:

1. Listen to the songs below.  Links provided whenever possible.

2. Rate each song from 1 to 10, 1 being awful and 10 being perfect.  You can also give ONE eleven and ONE zero, to your favorite and least favorite songs respectively (across your entire scoring, not per album).  If you want, you can leave comments alongside your scores, and they will be revealed along with the songs.

3. PM your scores to /u/fuckupsomecommasyeah (me), by September 30th, along with any comments you'd wish to add (not required but always appreciated).  You can copy and paste the lists into a Word doc/Notepad/whatever, add your scores, and send them to me.  Your scores and comments should *not* be considered anonymous.

4. The scores will be revealed in order from lowest to highest.

5. Everyone is perfectly fine because no one here has any actual emotional attachment to some silly contest like this, everyone acts like adults and no one cries when their ~~indie princess~~ fave completely tanks, we all get along with no issues whatsoever :) :) :)

The three albums we're going to look at this time around are:

**Katy Perry – Teenage Dream** (The Complete Confection edition)

vs

**Lady Gaga – The Fame Monster** (The Fame edition)

vs

**Kesha – Animal + Cannibal** (combined edition)

let’s get started, shall we?

#Katy Perry – Teenage Dream

Katy Perry, as you all know, is one of the biggest popstars in the world, and Teenage Dream was the album that solidified her status. During the Teenage Dream era, she became known for her [bright](https://popofcouture.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/td1.png), [candy-coated](http://static.idolator.com/uploads/2010/06/katy-perry2.gif) aesthetic. Teenage Dream’s sales, records, and certifications speak for themselves. The album has sold 3 million copies in the US and 6 million worldwide. It charted within the Top 40 of the Billboard 200 year-end chart three years in a row. The album earned Katy seven Grammy nominations, for which she was tragically snubbed. She also was the first female artist to produce five #1 singles from the same album (#JusticeForTheOneThatGotAway), and the first artist overall since Michael Jackson’s 1987 album Bad.

Katy would release Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection nearly two years later; the single Part Of Me debuted at #1 and went double platinum. It also features a remix of E.T. featuring Kanye West that had already been made for the release of the E.T. music video. (This is the version of the album that we will be rating!)

#Lady Gaga – The Fame Monster

Before she became the biggest star on the planet, before she fell from grace, before she broke tons of records and then her hip, before she became a jazz/rock/tribute singer/artist/farmer, before Applause, Bad Romance, Born This Way, and Just Dance took over the charts, there was a 5' 1'' singer with big sunglasses and even bigger heels singing her heart out at bars and [water parks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA8bt4xDqCo), trying to promote an album that debuted at #17 on the Billboard 200. We always joke that music was invented in 2009 with the release of The Fame, but for a lot of us - including me - that's really where our love for music began. Without Gaga, and without that album, I wouldn't have realized how great, how limitless pop music had the potential to be, and I certainly wouldn't be on this subreddit now if it weren't for that. Maybe those songs (yes, even Bad Romance) sound a bit dated now, but I can't help but smile when I relisten to The Fame and The Fame Monster and remember my days in middle school spending hours watching Gaga performances on YouTube, when she still had that disco stick and a decent number of straight fans. It really was an exciting time for pop music, and I can only hope to experience something similar again someday. (by /u/letsallpoo)

#Ke$ha – Animal + Cannibal

With the news of what Ke$ha endured during these years with Dr. Luke surfacing recently, it's hard to look at the Animal and Cannibal eras fondly. Those albums introduced us to Ke$ha, in all her glitter-soaked vomit-stained glory, whose public persona belied a legitimately talented and intelligent songwriter and singer who was secretly suffering at the hands of the man in charge of her career. She was a master of the trashy pop song, but she could also be strikingly sensitive - song like The Harold Song and Dancing With Tears in my Eyes come to mind. At the very least, those were the years where she was a constant on the radio and the charts, and with her current career in limbo, I still wonder what will happen next for her. Ke$ha truly deserved better, from all of us. (by /u/letsallpoo)
