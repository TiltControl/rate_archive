> The song is a hyperbolic, larger-than-life display of the “party girl” lifestyle… The hook implies that there’s a wrong, illegitimate way to party. Ke$ha will fight for the right to party correctly. This gets at the meaning of the first verse: causing a scene and pissing in expensive drinks is the right way to do it. “Keeping it classy” is not.

This song is basically the thesis statement or like, dissertation, of Kesha’s career. Singing about trashing it up at a party, I love it! My only problem is a couple lines make no sense (like “cigar in the caviar”) or are just nasty (like “pissing in the Dom Perignon”). Like I get the message she was trying to get across, but chill.
NapsAndNetflix: “This is a mixture of Avril Lavigne and HSM2 Fabulous, right?” Idk if this is a compliment or not tbh.

hellomochi: “I don't know what to say about it. Sounds like a generic "let's party" song.” Yeah sure, but it’s a p good one.

Average: 6.400

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQlIhraqL7o)

Well… due to the widely different opinions on this one, I’m not surprised it’s gone this early, though I am a bit sad. Firework is obviously meant to be an empowering and inspiring song, and people tend to think it’s either cute or really dumb and generic. It’s also famous for all the plastic bag line memes from pop music haters (come on, people. the metaphor is explained in the next line. it’s not *brilliant* writing but it at least makes sense if you literally listen to eight more words /rant). In the end, this song might be remembered solely for the video with the boob fireworks and it’s use at the end of The Interview. But it’s a decent bop.

batmanji: “https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNYaw4EJpZo”

NapsAndNetflix: “The plastic bag line is so bad but so good. The hype when she starts the hook with ignite the light holy shit chills”

huntyphobic: “Invented coming out”

soeri: “I am not a middle aged white mom.”

TeamAwesome4: “This song is the most mundane thing ever, fits Katy perfectly.” [bruh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKHhBGULeUw)

Man, there are a lot of songs already out that I think were gone too soon. This is definitely one of them. Blind is basically about an ex of Kesha’s that left her and her saying that he’ll regret it. Also, side note: fuck, it sucks so much that Kesha had to work with Dr. Luke so much.

MrSwearword: “singing so bad, I wished I could be deaf”

OberionSynth: “I'm getting Avril Lavigne vibes from this song and I'm not sure why” hmm, that seems to keep popping up when we talk about Kesha. 🤔🤔🤔

bruinbearr: “FUCKING love this song. It's such a great ballad (relatively speaking, compared to the rest of the album)”

**Can we talk about how the song I linked is basically exactly the same thematically but Victoria low-key did it better?**

So here’s the second song in a row about Kesha having [boy problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1LNQBX8JwE). Kiss N Tell is about her boyfriend cheating on her while she was away and her calling him out on his shit. God bless Kesha for saying he was “acting like a slut” lmao.

huntyphobic: “All of my hair follicles have been detached from my scalp after experiencing this dragging”

Therokinrolla: “killed by the pre-chorus in an otherwise super-bop and yet another song that rhymes secret with keep it”

TeamAwesome4: “I like to think of this song with Kesha as the “Girlfriend” that Avril Lavigne doesn’t like. Sonically, it feels like the most apt comparison I can make to another song, and no, that’s not a compliment. However, the message is better.” Man, the comparisons between these two just continue.

MrSwearword: “’listen to yourself, you’re a hot mess’ …she’s self-aware”

Finally, the first song from The Fame Monster is gone. I’ll let Gaga explain it herself.

> It is meant to mean two things: the first one kind of juvenile sexual provocative connotation is about oral sex, but also the monster in the song is fear of the truth. “Show me your teeth” means “tell me the truth” and I think that for a long time in my life that I replaced sex with the truth.

bruinbearr: “Sounds like something a gymnast could do a routine to. And not even a good gymnast.” How specific.

Mudkip1: “Y’ALL ARE FUCKING SLEEPING ON THIS SONG OH MY GODDDDDD” I just want to point out that these first two commenters gave the song a 1 and a 10, respectively.

whatsapilot: “terrible way to finish an amazing album. The "show me your teeth" towards the end is so fucking annoying, and the song is overall unappealing. Teeth is the only Gaga song that I actually hate, and possibly the only one I dislike at all.”

SkyBlade79: “it’s nasty in the worst way”

OberionSynth: “Yass, Gaga, I will gladly take a bite of your bad girl meat. This song is pretty repetitive but still good. I have to be in the mood for it. And by mood, I mean I gotta feel like a hoe.”

ThereIsNoSantaClaus: While we're waiting for #31, I have a pretty cool announcement for the upcoming December rate.

After a suggestion from /u/FuckUpSomeCommasYeah, the upcoming December rate is now going to be:

Kanye West - *The Life of Pablo*

Drake - *Views*

Chance the Rapper - *Coloring Book*

Frank Ocean - *Blonde*

All 4 albums have elements of both singing and rapping, of pop and hip hop and to some extent r&b, and with Frank in the mix there's not going to be a clear winner like some of the other rates.

December is gonna be certified LIT

kappyko: but what about the proposed ANTI/Lemonade/Blonde rate?? seemed most logical
 
dang it at least i only have to listen to one album

ready for D.R.A.M. Sings Special, Be Yourself, and Siiiiiiiiilver Surffffeeeeer Intermission to slay 😩👌

kappyko: eh, nothing on the schedule right now but i thought it would be a fitting trilogy of altr&b records, maybe fourway with Solange's record

not too mad but i'm scared kanye and probably chance are going to destroy him

are we including all the skits? this is gonna be fun
[/r/popheads/comments/56ip32/rate_results_teenage_dream_vs_the_fame_monster_vs/d8jrit5/]

=====

ThereIsNoSantaClaus: from what I've heard Anti and Lemonade are planned to be in the big rate against Glory and Joanne and KP4 but 2 of those aren't out yet so it hasn't been officially planned

and my current plan for skits/interludes is that they'll be optional for people to rate and if I get enough ratings i'll do a mini rate reveal of all of them before i start the real results

Average: 6.623
Controversy score: 1.737

Highest scores (10 x1): letsallpoo (9 x3): MrSwearword, batmanji, whatsapilot

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7FCgw_GlWc)

hellomochi: “This, "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich", "Money Honey" and "Starstruck" are homogeneous - they're all songs about celebrity and money. It's kinda hard to differentiate between them, although any of them could've been hits if released (applicable to all the songs on The Fame, imo).”

SkyBlade79: “I like the song even though the lyrics are very lame”

BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU: “This is what I think Paris Hilton imagines her music to sound like.”

Xerographia: “Great song! Kind of forgettable, but passable.”

**Why is the title track one of the worst songs on the album??? Also we just reached the top half of the songs in this rate, where this song does not belong.**

conspiracypizza: kesha's animal however, is a really good example of a solid title track. so is teenage dream, but in a very different way. Animal encompasses the albums entire message much better.

=====

conspiracypizza: damn. gaga and kesha dukin it outttt. funny how when everyone would compare gaga vs katy and when we vote, she really doesn't hold up as much. but i think this sub might be a *little* biased against katy. 
[/r/popheads/comments/56ip32/rate_results_teenage_dream_vs_the_fame_monster_vs/d8k3j75/]

=====

PandoraKris: I don't know actually. Katy's album has 4 songs less than both Gaga and Kesha after all.

But yeah, it's still safe to say that Katy got treated unfairly against Gaga here.
[/r/popheads/comments/56ip32/rate_results_teenage_dream_vs_the_fame_monster_vs/d8k64z2/]

=====

conspiracypizza: true. I think maybe katy's music simply doesn't hold up as well? i dont have much to back this however. you could easily make the same argument for kesha and gaga. but those two have very 80's synth dance vibes that are pretty timeless. I think another reason could be that gaga and kesha are much more creative lyricists, and they have a lot of songs with vastly different melodies and styles. whereas katy has a specific type of method, like commonly used vocabulary and melody structure that shows through when you listen to her tracks as a whole.
