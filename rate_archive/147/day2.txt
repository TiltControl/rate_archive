In another bit of a more experimental moment on the album, Domino's most noteworthy feature is the grinding, crunchy guitar/synth/thing (?) backing the chorus. I think it sounds pretty cool but it's definitely kind of harsh compared to not only the rest of the song where Mica's vocals glide across a smooth bass, but also the rest of the album. As such, it finds itself as the first cut of day 2.

---

#jessie j

**RandomHypnotica** (10): outsold Jessie J

**TiltControls** (10): jessie who

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): Jessie J outsold just a bit a I fear. Still really good.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.7): Jessie J outsold

**CrimsonROSET** (4): somehow jessie j outsold

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Jessie J is shaking (her head in disappointment)

#grimes

**jman457** (9.2): reminds of a GOOD grimes song

**just\_thonking** (8.5): so Grimesy it makes me want some spaghetti

**starla\_** (5.4): this is like an Art Angels reject

**apatel27** (4): Too Grimescore for Me

#magbay

**cremeebrulee** (10): hispanic art pop

**nicolas** (10): i love shoegaze

**qazz23** (10): love the distorted shoegazey sound

**Stryxen** (10): esta eliminacion... eso se llama latinafobia

**throwaway-7650** (10): [J.Lo voice] MI GENTE LATINO ("she speaks spanish?" - swifties)

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): a lot of the songs on this album have very clear verses and pre-choruses and then suddenly get extremely noisy for the chorus and i love each and every one of them

**wavingwolves** (10): second best chorus on the album easily

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): this is like a mix of Follow the Leader and You Lose! and it's great

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (9): i really want magbay to do more rock influenced songs like this and you lose, they just sound so good

**BaconShoes** (9): a bop

**imbaby122** (9): pre-chorus makes me want to rip stuff up with my teeth and tear shit apart idk

**jay?** (9): üíãüí£üòç

**notchickeninspanish** (9): The loudQUIETloud formula still works.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): is this city pop?

**fairytalehigh** (8.6): as far as existential bops with killer guitar lines go, it's definitely up there!

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): this had way more potential üò°

**MassiveThief** (8.5): The shouting and general noisiness is done so well

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): that distortion that kicks in 40 seconds in? hell ya. needs more of it

**bbfan132** (8): pretty song!! idk what else to say now

**bluetriangles04** (8): The back vocals here kind of remind me of the Fable games from my childhood...

**frogaranaman** (8): guitar line is wicked, sounds like mental health issues stemming from dad's classic rock playlist (why I love it)

**plastichaxan** (8): crunchy

**homestarguy** (7.5): A much better use of noisiness in the chorus compared to the previous track. That beat quiet but kinda goes??

**SmileAndTears** (8): love how gritty this sounds

#domiNAUR

**reput4tionera** (8): i kind of hate the distorty part but it still hits

**modulum83** (7.6): tsundere ass song

**fadedblue09** (7.5): mixed feelings throughout but it's catchy

**rslashpoopheads** (7): damn it all haha

**vayyiqra** (7): Okay I want to like this, but they're doing the distortion thing again and I don't think it's adding to the song here. I like the parts that don't sound like my headphones are glitching though.

**pig-serpent** (5): The writing on this one is unamusing and this album gets really old by this point, but I love the extra crunch that appears during the chorus.  I just wish it was used on a better song.

**\_\_Avaritia** (4.5): Nah I‚Äôm not about this noise pop drone rock vibe, sorry

**runaway3212** (3.5): stream Stray Kids - DOMINO

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): https://youtu.be/yPuI4l0jK7s

**astrologicalangel** (0): this is a recipie for sensory overstimulation

I really love this one, it was disappointing to see it being day 1 for most of the rating period and just barely scrape by into day 2 at the end. It's classic CHVRCHES with it being bright and synthy to a sickening degree. I personally find it sickening like yass bitch werk gagged but for a lot of people it's just too much and truly makes them sick to their stomach. The lyrics here are also a little on the nose, but idk man, that bridge part where the instrumental swells up with the synths and she goes HA! is just so irresistable to me. It really sucks because if it were up to me this would have easily made day 3, but so it goes...

#good scores

**omgthenerve** (11): good girls justify, but I don't

**apatel27** (10): Fight your fight

**BaconShoes** (10): the part where she‚Äôs like ‚Äúgood girls satisfy but i won‚Äôt, NOOOO I WOOOOOON‚ÄôTTTT‚Äù and then the production goes CRAZY omfg i love this song so much

**bbfan132** (10): i love how loud this chorus is, the maximalism is perfect

**bespectacIed** (10): EXQUISITE front half of screen violence pauses here. what a banger

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the most amazing chorus I've heard in a while. I just can't get enough of it

**jay?** (10): üíãüí£üòç

**pig-serpent** (10): Basically a perfect chorus.  The catchiest song on the album and the synth lick behind it is *chef's kiss*

**seanderlust** (10): "killing your idols is a chore...but we don't need them anymore" wow the kpopphobia :pensive:

**shhhneak** (10): She lived, she girlbossed, she died.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): you know what? yeah! fuck being a good girl! i wanna be evil! just like eartha kitt said which is why you should vote for the golden oldies rate next rate cycle

**throwaway-7650** (10): I insist on abbreviating death by a thousand cuts as "DB1KC"

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): nothing on this planet hits as hard as that "HA!" and scientists have proven that

**warjhybrid** (9.7): This just goes hard

**just\_thonking** (9.5): it's good, girls!

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): BANGER

**jman457** (9.4): a perfect little synthpop tune

**bluetriangles04** (9): I don't know how but this song is like the epitome of current stan culture. To make excuses for the actions of celebrities who don't even know us to our own death beds is something I don't think anyone should do lol.

**celladonn** (9): Such a great set of opening lyrics

**modulum83** (9): "killing your idols is a chore and it's such a fucking bore" is such an dope line

**rslashpoopheads** (9): RIP main pop girls

**welcome2thejam** (9): Tasty classic CHVRCHES synth, can't get enough of it

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): outsold the TV show (and i love the TV show, RIP)

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): I wish I knew what this chorus sounded like, oh well. Not a bad one.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): live slow die old

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Good girls do cry, lie, and die they just haven‚Äôt been caught.

**homestarguy** (8): Lauren is bitter as hell, and they give us a classic CHVRCHES banger here.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): maybe the most straight forward song lyrically but the way she goes ‚Äúits such a fucking bore‚Äù always gets me

**nt96** (8): omg is she implying she's a bad girl? Yasss live fast, die young, bad girls do it well!!

#this song is a chore. such a fucking bore.

**reput4tionera** (8): im not going to lie ‚Äúgood girls don‚Äôt die, good girls stay alive‚Äù is a clunky ass lyric

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): sounds like it's gonna be really good and then the chorus comes in and it's like fine but like... it's still good but could be much better

**fadedblue09** (7): decent but that muddled instrumental solo in the middle is unnecessary

**imbaby122** (7): recovering people pleaser anthem

**runaway3212** (7): better than that 5sos song

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I just love hearing the words ‚Äúcut my teeth‚Äù but the rest of the song is meh

**wavingwolves** (6.2): a tiny bit coldplaycore but i don't mean this as an insult

**CrimsonROSET** (6): wait weren‚Äôt you the final girl what do you mean you‚Äôre not a good girl

**frogaranaman** (6): the instrumental is giving it all but the lyrics are giving "Scars To Your Beautiful"

**vayyiqra** (6): Okay a song I more or less like. I'll take it. Ignore the clumsy lyrics, a lot of people begging you to ignore,

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): her voice sounds kind of weird and metallic to me.

**TiltControls** (5): Random pet peeve - if you're going to have similarly titled but unrelated tracks separate them on the tracklist!!

**2dina3dworld** (3): the first six lines of this are the best lines of the album, too bad the rest of the song is really pitchy and annoying

**you2009** (3): grating synths but quite catchy

**cremeebrulee** (1): this chorus is very annoying

Finally they lose something post-Gateway - and this is definitely the most deserving candidate in my opinion. This could have left yesterday and I'd be perfectly fine with it. It's definitely the weakest actual song across both EPs, and its placement reflects that.

---

#i throw my cellular device in the river

**Leixander** (11): Does anyone think global warming is a good thing? I love KKB. I think they're an interesting group.

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (10): time to ascend again!

**bbfan132** (10): i love how hazy and dreamy this is

**jay?** (10): gag

**notchickeninspanish** (10): Sitting with clear skin, listening to monks chant by a video game lake.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the ending of this absolutely goes the FUCK off like holy shit

**reput4tionera** (10): god this song is so good

**sage** (10): atmosphere slays

**Stryxen** (10): ‚ÄúWe pass down our wisdom/ After sunshine comes thunder/ The longer the drought/ The heavier the clouds‚Äù are lyrics that aren‚Äôt all that groundbreaking but they just mean. A lot. to me

**Uberpigeon** (10): this song made my soul pass

**vayyiqra** (10): That part with the spoken word vocals is so catchy even though I have no clue what the hell Sarah is saying at that part but I get the vibe as a whole is about the earth being flooded so that works for me.

**homestarguy** (9.5): They let Sarah sing in Japanese again!!! Also, Gus absolutely snapped on the synth solo.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): get in the ark Sarah

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): these results will probably have me going jesus send the flood

**apatel27** (9): The world does deserve to drown tbf

**bespectacIed** (9): morbid biblical shit in extreme synths yes pls

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): love the weird religious vibes to this one

**imbaby122** (9): do we think noah would listen to this on his ark hmmm

**modulum83** (8.7): the synth is doing things to me that i would get in trouble for if i talked about them

**jman457** (8.5): I really liked how this was Amazon rainforest meets gregorian chants

**plastichaxan** (8.5): beep boop

**BaconShoes** (8): this one kinda gives me super mario 64 vibes but in a better way than Every Rule by Charli XCX

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This album has an AESTHETIC and it pulls it off so well.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): solar power

**fairytalehigh** (8): not quite as cutting as the other songs but i really love the lyrics

**qazz23** (8): beautiful outro

**rslashpoopheads** (8): banger

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): cannot think of anything quirky to say about this one but it is really good. her airy vocal style really works with these concepts

**welcome2thejam** (8): When that synth comes screaming in, just absolutely mind-blowing

**frogaranaman** (6): Lewis and Clark upon arriving in Mississippi

**pig-serpent** (6): Ok the solo on this one is crazy.  I do mostly tune out the song until the solo starts, but still that solo is 11 worthy.

#hydrophobic

**TiltControls** (5.5): who ordered a dial up machine

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.2): the synth part near the end was neat

**runaway3212** (5): joni mitchell outsold

**wavingwolves** (5): surely a song

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): Honestly the instrumental is fine, Sarah‚Äôs vocals are really just not for me, and this song is emblematic of this. Oops.

**fadedblue09** (4): It's not terrible but I was exhausted by the end of it

**IIIHenryIII** (0): if it dries, I won't mind

Did you think they'd catch a break early on today? Nahhhh... we couldn't even give them that. It really sucks to see this album get bodied like this, but maybe the more universally liked songs can do something down the line...

---

#delightful!

**bluetriangles04** (11): This song is just everything I love when it comes to production. The running beat, the way the chorus hits so hard, and the echo effects on the vocals. Personally the lyrical content also surprised me on first listen, as for a while before this album dropped and even now, I've been having these hyper-realistic dreams where I wake up and think they actually happened to an extent. Lol last night I literally dreamt that I drove my car into a lake and when I woke up I thought I was literally dead for a hot minute.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): What is with this album and their choruses honestly they are so catchy and triumphant and so AHHHHH like how do you not scream your lungs out at this one?

**apatel27** (10): Scream that Chorus!

**BaconShoes** (10): makes me wanna scream along and throw ass

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): We love a petty ghost.

**Gonza\_90** (10): These violeeeent deliiiights

**IIIHenryIII** (10): violently delightful

**pig-serpent** (10): I find that the mood and atmosphere of this song are unparalleled.  The drumbeat is new territory for Chrvches and I wouldn't mind hearing more like it.

**shhhneak** (10): Shakespeare must be honoured to be on masterpiece.

**starlitsuns** (10): this has the same satisfying sense of euphoria that Asking For A Friend has, holy shit I wish I knew about this song sooner. the bridge needs to be sung at the top of one's lungs at a concert

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): excited for the new Westworld season even though the last one kinda sucked

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): lauren's immaculate vocals, the DRUMS, the backing vocals, whew... kinda a career highlight

**welcome2thejam** (10): Imagine starting off a conversation with "had a dream your father died" what do I even say about that

**bbfan132** (9.5): this is gorgeous, love the hazy big beat sound

**imbaby122** (9.5): thankful for the pop girlies who have trouble sleeping and write songs about it <3

**runaway3212** (9.5): me when im killing for the funsies

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): IF MARTIN DOHERTY WON'T SHUT THE FAWK UP :men:

**jay?** (9): YASSSSSSSS üíãüí£üòç

**MassiveThief** (9): The only thing that annoys me is how overbearing/constant the drum loop is... but other than that this slays. Vocals on the chorus especially hit so hard.

**TiltControls** (9): spooky

**warjhybrid** (9): Local NFT bro making one (1) appearance on this album, we love it

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): ok Dolores

**fairytalehigh** (8.6): i have a soft spot for martin's parts and his bridge here is excellent. man this is a heavy song though

**rslashpoopheads** (8): that's my drag name

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (7.5): the chorus carries

#they choose violence

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): not bad but this song seems so much louder the whole time compared to the other songs

**jman457** (7.3): drags a bit but it still bopped a bit

**seanderlust** (7.3): they're right - "violent delights" is a banger of a phrase

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): one of the better choruses on the album

**reput4tionera** (7): i love a good amen break

**modulum83** (6.9): the chorus is lowkey the most annoying part of the song

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): deducting a point for letting the m\*n sing

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): male vocals during the bridge? yep popheads is gonna hate this one

**CrimsonROSET** (6): is that a right or a priviledge

**wavingwolves** (5.5): "collect his funds, i'm the cashier / got a way with the words, william shakespeare" -  lauren, probably

**frogaranaman** (5): at least the production on this goes dummy

**homestarguy** (5): A lot of sound and fury signifying nothing for me.

**fadedblue09** (4): Unnecessary and annoying percussion drag this down

**vayyiqra** (4): I want to like this song but these lyrics are very not my taste. They feel weirdly basic and literal? Chvrches lyrics are normally almost the opposite of that and are often more like impressionist gibberish, which suits me fine. I do like the drums so there's that.

**plastichaxan** (3): how can you make a song with a title this good so boring :shakey:

This is a really cool sounding song, a highlight of the album's production for me. Maybe the hook was annoying for some people, but I don't really personally see why it ended up drawing as much ire as it did... 3 zeroes?! I think #26 is a bit too low for it and this elimination will definitely sting for some people.

---

#dreamcatching always with you :)

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): imagine 0ing this song

**troubled-paradise69** (11): I'm not going to lie. I cried the first time I heard this. Something about the lush production and the vocals really got to me.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): OOO-AH-OOH! I WANNA! SEE EVERY THING-WITH-YOU! NO STOPPING!

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (10): well, time to ascend i guess

**BaconShoes** (10): HELLO??? So good omg. When the bass comes in‚Ä¶ i die every time

**bbfan132** (10): ‚Ä¶.wow

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I love the song dearly but I cannot watch the music video with Matthew‚Äôs FNAF-ass jumpscares.

**bluetriangles04** (10): A potential 11 for me honestly, I love how dynamic the instrumental is and the chorus really sucks me in lol.

**Leixander** (10): very captivating, one of the few songs on this album in which i think the vocals match the production well

**Mudkip1** (10): my other 11 contender. the music video is one of my favorites ever

**nicolas** (10): genuinely to whoever 0ed this, i will be meeting you in hell, how on earth does it ever cross your mind that this is a 0 !!!!!! sleep with one eye open tonight

**plastichaxan** (10): imagine 0ing this like‚Ä¶ how sick and twisted do you have to be

**qazz23** (10): neat breakdown/change-up at the end

**RandomHypnotica** (10): that ai video is PERFECT for this song like wow

**reput4tionera** (10): SLAYYYYYYY

**sage** (10): 2nd part one of the best moments in any song ever

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): maybe it's the years of developmental brain damage from analog horror but i find this song very eerie and unnerving

**you2009** (10): the bit after the clock drop. stunning

**fairytalehigh** (9.6): OOOoouaAOOOOooh i wanna see it with YOUouuuouOOUUuuuuuu

**imbaby122** (9.5): this song starts out so asmr core just dreamy and trippy and peaceful but by the end‚Ä¶ absolute banger. insane breakdown.

**Uberpigeon** (9.5): OwO

**frogaranaman** (9): I just know this shit slaps live

**homestarguy** (9): A bop but that music video has haunted my nightmares‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

**Stryxen** (9): DREAMCATCHING ALWAYS WITH YO-OwO-U

**vayyiqra** (9): On a given day it's a tossup if the repetition of "oo-woo-oo" and "dreamcatchin dreamcatchin" is kind of annoying or really catchy. This caught me on a good day. Anyway, last month I went to see cherry blossoms for the first time in my life at a park in Toronto and they are really beautiful up close in a way that photos don't capture. I understand now why the whole country of Japan gets hyped over them blooming every year.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): another fun (slight) cacophony ending

**modulum83** (8.6): fuck yes some real EDM on here

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this song hadnt clicked w me until the video, the whole stretch of prophecy til this was all nice but kinda blended, but now this really sticks out on its own and its so brilliant

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I like the drums

**jman457** (8.3): The bridge/breakdown makes this

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): omg switzerland that's that country from that tyler the creator song

**celladonn** (8): Me when I'm listening to kpop girl group Dreamcatcher

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the video really got me to care for this song

**jay?** (8): üíãüí£

**welcome2thejam** (8): That oo-OO-oo vocal choice keeps me from loving it, but what a gorgeous soundscape.

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): i flip back & forth on this one... like this was the best song they did live‚Äî they brought SO much energy performing it, but it almost frustrates me that the studio recording doesn‚Äôt reflect that

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I get why people wouldn‚Äôt like this but I kind of dig it

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): the last minute is great, but the rest is just ok

**2dina3dworld** (7): hot bitches associate this with one of their ships

**TiltControls** (7): I like parts of it, but wish there was a proper vocal section instead of the whispering. Still pretty good though!

#insomnias

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this one still needs some time in the oven i think, add like a minute to really explode that build up and this is chef‚Äôs kiss

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This song is like a parabola‚Ä¶ starts weird, gets good in the middle, but then gets weird again at the end

**pig-serpent** (6): Another Mag Bay song with outstanding production but without the writing to back it up.  To be fair, the end of this song is still really cool.

**throwaway-7650** (6): BUT WHAT ABOUT DREAMCATCHER? insomnias stand UP

**runaway3212** (5): not bad but a tad boring, like this comment

**apatel27** (3.5): Can't tell what that thing that sounds like a poorly played strings is but goddamn it is annoying

**rslashpoopheads** (2): meh

**fadedblue09** (0): manages to be annoying despite being most of it being barely audible

**notchickeninspanish** (0): Absolutely not. The drums belong to a different song, the lyrics are at their worst on the album of all the non-interlude tracks, and the production is an ambient mess.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): god i really hate the way she sings this one and bridge(?) just sounds so disjointed and doesn‚Äôt fit in the song at all??? this is so ugly sounding i cannot comprehend how this is a fan favorite

This making day 2 was kind of a gag, but it's just so yass and slay so I'm totally here for it. A perfect introduction to the album and an incredibly pleasant listen on its own, but it's here where we mark the end of the instrumental tracks in this rate. It manages to outplace a few of the bsides on Nurture and a bunch of other tracks in this rate though so good for it!

---

#WE LOVE INSTRUMENTAL INTRO TRACKS

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): I don‚Äôt usually care that much for intros but this is just beautiful, like come on

**bespectacIed** (10): really weird how some random combination of cosine and sine waves propagating thru air makes me feel things, black magic shit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Now this is an intro track that makes me feel like I‚Äôm lying face down in some soft grass on a perfect spring day.

**DefaultPophead** (10): The most positive noise I've ever heard in my life. It makes me feel good and like I'll always be okay.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): not kidding, I legit thought this was the best track on the album when I heard it for the first time. I thought I was initiating one of the best albums I had ever heard all due to this fantastic intro, but that was not the case. I reckon it is a great album though. Also, does anyone else get a posing in bondage vibe from that shimmering sound (I'm not sure if that's the correct term)??? It sounds so similar from the one that starts playing after the first chorus in that song

**jay?** (10): üíãüí£üòç

**Leixander** (10): very beautiful, reminds me of Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence by Ryuichi Sakamoto a little bit

**MassiveThief** (10): Just stunning. One of the best instrumental in recent memory, and what an opener.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is so fucking pretty and really gets you in the right headspace for this album

**ricki** (10): instrumental solidarity

**skargardin** (10): If you told me that this was the overworld theme of any given JRPG I wouldn't have batted an eye tbh

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): beautiful

**throwaway-7650** (10): VOTE FOR VIDEO GAME INSTRUMENTALS IN MINIRATE VOTING!

**TiltControls** (10): sure it's another instrumental intro, but it just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside

**wavingwolves** (9.9): üò®üò≥

**jman457** (9.5): really beautifully juxtaposes nature soundscapes into a concrete musical identity

**akanewasright** (9): this is gorgeous

**bbfan132** (9): super pretty intro!! i love the mix of classical and electronic sounds

**CrimsonROSET** (9): warm! welcoming! like a big hug from someone you haven‚Äôt seen in a long time!

**fairytalehigh** (9): such a perfect intro

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This opens a portal to the Animal Crossing universe

**homestarguy** (9): A musical hug from Porter himself

**modulum83** (9): ren fair music played by cute little robots

**nt96** (9): I swore I heard this on the Wii

**pig-serpent** (9): Why are we rating this lol

**runaway3212** (9): me when im not dead

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): the intros/interludes/outros in this rate are top notch, this is gorgeous

**Uberpigeon** (9): thsi will be my highest score i fear

**vayyiqra** (9): It's short but also it's the most soothing sound in the world every time this comes on.

**welcome2thejam** (9): God what I wouldn't do to be lying face down in a field of grass right now

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): it's just the most beautiful thing i've ever heard you know

**fadedblue09** (8.5): just soothing

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): dreamy intro

**seanderlust** (8.5): this sounds like an instrumental from a peaceful town in a video game (high compliment)

**frogaranaman** (8): I wanna learn this on the piano

**apatel27** (7.5): Cute opener

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (7.5): it's short, but it's also really pretty

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): video game intro music

**indie\_fan\_** (7.5): Everyone gon‚Äô tank this since it‚Äôs a minute and a half, but this is still a real pretty intro

**celladonn** (7): This sets the tone so well

**reput4tionera** (7): very nice

**shhhneak** (7): This is cute. Sounds like the intro to an indie pixel game.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): introphobia

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): i like how much this sounds like it would play over the introductory shots in a disney movie and i fucking hate disney movies

**starla\_** (6.5): very lovely but still a short intro

**ImADudeDuh** (6): cute opening

**imbaby122** (6): this is the highest score i can justify giving a short song with no lyrics but it had me doing a little jig

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): it sounds like something that‚Äôd be in ocarina of time

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): It sounds like animal crossing music but in a fun way

**BaconShoes** (5.5): this sounds like background music in a video game intro cutscene or something idk‚Ä¶and not music i would choose to listen to outside of the game i fear

**oscarbrierley1** (5): introduces the album well, but I'm not listening to it on its own

**plastichaxan** (4): maybe i can‚Äôt combat interlude/introphobia on my own

As many of the comments have pointed out, here's yet another song about California. And something about dying there. We love a consistent song topic! This is a nice song but not one of my faves on the album, but hey, I'll take what I can get as far as CHVRCHES songs actually making it out of day 1. Unfortunately, this joins Good Girls and Violent Delights in not making it very far. With that, CHVRCHES has just three songs remaining.

#california gurls

**apatel27** (10): Fuck the Hollywood Dream

**bluetriangles04** (10): Welcome to the Hotel California... there's freedom in falling and failure, even living in the middle of nowhere it's easy to see the surrounding dread around California when artists that go there always end up writing songs about it being a dead end of sorts in their life, where they aren't able to escape. The lyrics on this one really stood out to me.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): best song "about" California ever

**ImADudeDuh** (10): erm, im in california and im alive?

**imbaby122** (10): i wanted to be mad at this song because there are too many songs called california but i‚Äôll let this one slide bc it‚Äôs just that good. no more california songs though!!! i‚Äôm putting my foot down!

**jay?** (10): YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSS ! üíãüí£üòç

**rslashpoopheads** (10): the last minute of this song holy shit

**SFbby** (10): Yes i would like to die in California please

**shhhneak** (10): Not an annotation on Genius listing artists who‚Äôve actually warned you about dying in California.

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): I too would die in California with them got damn house prices

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): note to self: do NOT visit California under ANY circumstances

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.5): definitely in like the top 3 best indie synthpop songs called california from albums with red covers. love them using more guitars recently

**seanderlust** (9.1): "well I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona!" - Lucille bluth

**BaconShoes** (9): THERE‚ÄôS FREEDOM IN THE FAILUUUUURE

**bespectacIed** (9): california the most OVERRATED place/inspiration/synechdoche of all time. music artists stop referencing it challenge. but tis a bop

**DefaultPophead** (9): I feel like this is the one I'm going to keep coming back to on this album.

**just\_thonking** (9): song is so good I am willing to overlook that live laugh love bridge

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona

**throwaway-7650** (9): she went 2 the skinny dipping (blonde girl) school of songwriting

**welcome2thejam** (9): Second pophead indie rate in a row I get to say this: disillusionment about California is practically its own genre. Think this one in particular does a really great job of putting such a glitz and glamour sound with the darker lyrics

**bbfan132** (8.5): this definitely feels like california sonically to me, fitting title

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I think this is the most relatable song here

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): anyone can die in any location actually, so, not sure what the point they‚Äôre trying to make here is

**starlitsuns** (8.5): lorde :handshake: chvrches :handshake: having songs about how california is not what it seems

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): guitars in my chvrches song?

**wavingwolves** (8.2): kind of ended grimes and also lana and also other people who have songs called california

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Now she does hate California after all.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): none of these songs are bad but they are just kind of samey so far

**jman457** (8): like the emotion in this

**reput4tionera** (8): this is like chvrches‚Äôs take on forever 21 pop but it works

**runaway3212** (8): dying in California sounds like a faith worse than death

#they died (in california)

**modulum83** (7.9): every song named "California" is always pretty solid but not quite as good as you hoped it would be, as a general rule

**fairytalehigh** (7.8): i like the song, but of the 2 alt pop icons of the 10s who released songs called "california" in 2021... gotta go with lorde on this one

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): Grimes outsold

**pig-serpent** (7.5): I find that the hook of this song is a little weak, but the atmosphere of this song is still great and the little guitar and synth licks throughout the song are immaculate.

**TiltControls** (7.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zU_QjjjyCs

**homestarguy** (7): Love the shimmering guitar touches, don‚Äôt really dig the verses, but a nice chorus tho.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): my friend has a playlist of every single song he knows titled/about california cant wait to send this song to him

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): omg they're in their rhcp era

**cremeebrulee** (6.3): please look at the ‚Äúno one ever warns you‚Äù genius annotation, i‚Äôm ctfu

**CrimsonROSET** (6): guess we DO hate california after all

**notchickeninspanish** (6): Obligatory outsold by Grimes comment.

**MassiveThief** (5): We're closing in on being able to do a rate solely of 'California' songs

**vayyiqra** (5): For the first time in this ballot I cannot thing of a single thing to say about a song and that's not boding well for the rest of this album.

**nicolas** (4): i was bored who else was bored

**Stryxen** (4): calif-yawn-ia

**frogaranaman** (1): the chorus of this sounds like a parody of CHVRCHES

This is definitely an underrated song on the album for me, but #23 really ain't bad for a song that is half instrumental. I can't help but get giddy when the vocals come in.. MAYBE IT'S A GIFT THAT I COULDN'T RECOGNIZE....... sage ur a real one for 11ing this.

#found the warmth of summer

**2dina3dworld** (10): banger closer

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): A lovely, sunkissed send-off to a lovely, sunkissed, soft, warm hug of a record. I too am trying to feel alive. Who knows whether said try will be successful?

**bespectacIed** (10): this album is flawless start to end, i'll always love porter for this catharsis of an album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QByczH5DCk

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this seems like the inverse of look at the sky in a way, about how things will be better in the future but then the future gets there and you just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt feel like things are better, but for different reasons.

**DefaultPophead** (10): I have found the warmth of summer in the songs you write, Porter.

**shhhneak** (10): TIL Porter Robinson is just a better LANY.

**starlitsuns** (10): fun fact: this is the final track that Porter made for this album and i think it is very beautiful as a closer. very euphoric to dance to live.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this album made me feel alive

**throwaway-7650** (10): add my comment to the "same porter, same" section

**TiltControls** (10): Another song I really wish I could've 11'd. Perfect closer to the album that doesn't get enough love. "Maybe I don't really need to feel satisfied. Maybe it's a gift that I spent all this time just trying to feel alive" was probably my favourite lyrical section of 2021

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): y'know i'm really starting to get the feeling that the modern trappings of life are holding me back and the only things that will ever truly give me a feeling of contentment in my life are seeking nature and loving the people around me. anyone else?

**vayyiqra** (10): Yeah I think I've made my point by now with every single comment I've written that this album is beautiful and makes me emotional and it's cathartic. Yeah, it's great.

**modulum83** (9.5): in a sometimes very cheesy and earnest album, this is the one song whose emotionality really got through to me. every theme in this album gets wrapped up here in a way that makes me appreciate what he was doing the whole time. great ending.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.4): i wanted to give this song a score of 3œÄ but i don't think i can so this is my score now

**homestarguy** (9): Takes a bit to get going, but an extremely satisfying closer. Love that Porter strips away the vocal effects here in spots, you know it means a lot to him!!

**imbaby122** (9): life changing tbh.

**wavingwolves** (8.6): #relatable

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): fantastic closer, just wish it was a little longer!

**jay?** (8.5): üíãüí£üòç

**apatel27** (8): This encapsulates lying down in a park after doing something stressful perfectly.

**bbfan132** (8): nice outro!

**bluetriangles04** (8): The albums in this rate seem to end on insanely high/optimistic notes. I feel like it's something that's needed on albums like this or Screen Violence which have a lot of lyrics asking indirectly about the meaning of life or carrying darker lyrics about the negative effects of the music industry. A solid end to a solid album.

**frogaranaman** (8): radical optimism is good sometimes

**IIIHenryIII** (8): we don't need to try, cuz this album exists

**pig-serpent** (8): Feels like a victory lap for the album.

#not satisfied

**jman457** (7.6): A nice little ending to the album, wish it were a bit more bombastic

**runaway3212** (7.5): not as good as I remember

**jasannn** (7): cute but it leaves the album on an unmemorable end

**reput4tionera** (7): i wish there was a more eventful ending to this album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): you know what porter? i‚Äôm *also* trying to feel alive

**rslashpoopheads** (6): go jump off a cliff or something idk

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): this album isnt bad but it has rotted my brain

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): this kinda falls flat for some reason, it‚Äôs trying really hard to evoke an emotional reaction but it doesn‚Äôt connect

This is such a triumphant track that fits so well with its placement near the end of the album. I personally adore Trying to Feel Alive as a closer but this would work very well as that too. I'm fine with it as the penultimate track though. The album's only collaboration finds itself placing a little middling in this rate, but I think I'd place it around the middle of a ranking of Nurture so that checks out.

---

#totally enormous!

**indie\_fan\_** (11): This how tf you use distortion to your advantage

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (10): beautiful

**bluetriangles04** (10): this is just a really beautiful song to me. the whole way through it's a very solid EDM sound already, but the lyrics and the vocals work super well on the track. The last time I heard about the Totally Enourmous Extinct Dinosaurs dude had to be on the Dillon Francis 'Without You' track nearly 10 years ago and the thought of it makes me feel insanely old for just a 19 year old...

**DefaultPophead** (10): A musical baptism.

**frogaranaman** (10): Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs is the best producer name of all time

**jasannn** (10): The closer that never was. It‚Äôs almost as good Goodbye to the Word.

**reput4tionera** (10): OH THIS SONG IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE

**starlitsuns** (10): okay most of the people I have read about crying to a track on nurture cry to this track. i kinda get it but i also have never cried to this track before.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): cathartic, incredible, [list of positive adjectives that sound cool and artsy]

**TiltControls** (10): my claim to fame for the future is having the 1st obsession for this track on lastfm

**warjhybrid** (10): God, the addition of TEED to this track just puts it over the top. Gorgeous production, amazing vocals. Stream Household Goods by TEED

**WillWorkForSugar** (10): was nearly my 11, it is so good

**RandomHypnotica** (9.9): I only know Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs from Garden, but that song and this are both bops so maybe I should explore more

**fairytalehigh** (9.6): i was just going to give this a 9 but then i remembered TEED's real name is orlando higginbottom

**imbaby122** (9.5): very euphoric and comforting. this song feels like the best hug ever.

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): Orlando Tobias Edward Higginbottom I mean Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs (TEED) cannot sing I'm so sorry to this man but pls shut up

**modulum83** (9.3): insanely good shit. feels like some final-battle fate-of-the-world movie soundtrack.

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Solid track, not something I would be bumping as hard to as with the other tracks on this masterpiece but it‚Äôs real good still.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the way this builds‚Ä¶.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): mmm, okay, this one gets it

**runaway3212** (9): I cannot this album is too good

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): every description on genius of his songwriting process involves him crying... he's just like me

**vayyiqra** (9): At this point in the album I'm not even thinking what the lyrics are about anymore. It's like this tweet I can't find by the electronic musician City Girl who said something like "Porter Robinson could be singing about literally anything and I'd still be crying to it".

**apatel27** (8.5): The way the track comes together is just üëå

**jay?** (8.5): üíãüí£üòç

**ricki** (8.5): this sounds so expensive

**jman457** (8.4): hyperpop meets cottage core

**bbfan132** (8): :) good song

**rslashpoopheads** (8): this feels very music festy

#extinct

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is the only place on the album where the vocal processing annoys me just a bit.  Still a good song.

**homestarguy** (7): Hmmm, this one sounds so substantial and I appreciate the variety of vocals, but it just doesn‚Äôt seem to fit with the rest of the album for me. Still pretty.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): one of the weakest tracks on the album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): it doesn‚Äôt really build up to much of anything

**cremeebrulee** (4.5): there's is SO much going on here like is he just sucking through a straw at one point

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Kinda dull and dragging

**2dina3dworld** (4): the bridge kills this for me

The pan flute here is amazing, truly the centerpiece of this song. I think as a whole the song feels a little sluggish, but I'll come back just for that aspect of the instrumentation honestly.

#britney spears global warming lady gaga tweet

**apatel27** (10): Fuck Climate Change deniers all my homies hate Climate Change deniers

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Smiling at the sound of this song and trembling in terror at the lyrics.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i fucking love this song, i love the flute, i love the message, i love how calm it looks until it all goes to shit just like we‚Äôre letting happen to the world.

**homestarguy** (10): Look, when the roasting climate finally consumes us, at least we had the privilege to listen to this song as a warning.

**notchickeninspanish** (10): Idk how this song is 'subdued' in the context of any album anywhere, but it works here and I'm living.

**plastichaxan** (10): Does anyone think global warming is a good thing? I love Lady Gaga. I think she's a really interesting artist.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the other 11 contender on this project for me, I truly love this song and I feel like it very much snuck under the radar at it's original release, it feels both familiar and foreboding, and perfectly sums up the Civilisation vibes

**reput4tionera** (10): i forgot i was doing the rate i was just like hmm i love this song

**seanderlust** (10): the instrumentals are cool and all but i really think my favorite part of this EP is the lyricism. like it's song after song about the destruction of humanity and i'm just like bopping along

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): i freaking loooooove electronic music with an aesthetic like this bleep bloop music should not transport me into fire emblem but it sure do

**Uberpigeon** (10): exactly

**vayyiqra** (10): I love songs with two weirdly specific niche traits: 1. songs with vivid post-apocalyptic imagery 2. songs that use pan flutes (even though on here it's synthesized but it still works) so I love this song because it improbably has both.

**bluetriangles04** (9.5): I really enjoyed this one when it came on, it just has this weightless feeling to it.

**Stryxen** (9.5): what i said for battle lines, just a tiny bit less

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (9): damn, this is already really cynical and pessimistic but coming from kkb it's like ten times darker

**imbaby122** (9): definitely top 5 song about climate change

**starlitsuns** (9): very atmospheric, Sarah's vocals really fit the track well

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): fires, rivers; needs earthquakes and hurricanes become the disaster Avatar in Civilisation 3

**welcome2thejam** (9): Shaking ass to the climate change song again

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): oooo this one is really pretty

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): Stardew battle music

**BaconShoes** (8.5): cute and fun lil song about the end of the world

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): that MIDI pan flute is so nostalgic, holy shit. it's giving golden sun

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): f

**modulum83** (8.3): bloons tower defense 6 type beat

**celladonn** (8): The lyrics and sound of this really paint a picture

#burn this song

**TiltControls** (8): shh, mag bay said to keep it quiet

**jasannn** (7.8): almost as good as the driftveil city music

**jman457** (7.7): I couldn‚Äôt decide if this was annoying or it bopped. Thats because it reminded me of toto‚Äôs Africa.

**bbfan132** (7.5): this is a cute song but not my favorite

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): this is the sound of the end of the world... - grimes

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I get this concept of this song (and I guess the album) however I just don‚Äôt care for it

**frogaranaman** (6): the panflute is queer coded

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this hits too hard as a californian

**MassiveThief** (5.5): That flute line gets annoying very quickly

**wavingwolves** (5.5): makes me feel like i'm inside a forever 21

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): Like the worst yoga session by the pond ever

**IIIHenryIII** (5): this song is annoying

**pig-serpent** (5): I remember this was the only song that stuck with me from this set when it came out, and now I'm not really sure why.  It has a cool dark sound and catchy whistle noises, but it's overall kind of boring and it's easy to see why it's not in my regular rotation anymore.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): they came but they didn't leave a mark

**runaway3212** (5): when the fire comes im gonna finally enjoy being warm enough

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): if you‚Äôre gonna make a song about climate change at least make it sound fun and sexy

Quarantine bop etc etc, although I find it kind of funny how many comments read this as April 20th, 2021 and not April 21st, 2020... it's the "weakest" on Civ II for sure, but when your competition is TPATC and Well Rested, it's hard to win... Still, a top 20 position is pretty good!

---

#animal crossing and bread baking

**2dina3dworld** (10): second best song of the album

**akanewasright** (10): I know this will be the first song out for Civ II, but... it‚Äôs just too accurate to my early lockdown experience. It‚Äôs such an accurate snapshot of the early COVID experience, and pretty perfectly captures the sense of routine that was developed in that time. This was by far my least favorite track on Civ II when it dropped, but 2 years out from the early days of quarantine, I hear this song and it takes me back to those days‚Ä¶  but not in a particularly good way. It can be easy to get nostalgic about the time of bread baking and Animal Crossing until you remember exactly how much you and everyone else really lost in that time. The line about the family promising to throw Eloise a normal birthday party another year gets to me in particular. This was a surprise 11 contender and one I‚Äôll be sad to see go

**bespectacIed** (10): will never not me tear up, idc. it's the mundane details of that era suspended in time that stings the most, but it's still oddly nostalgic? what a surreal, black hole time that was. sarah is always so good at honing in at the small things

**homestarguy** (10): As much as I wouldn‚Äôt like to relive those first uncertain months of Spring 2020 again, this song is just so pretty and forlorn at the same time. I hope Eloise got to have her party!

**Leixander** (10): maybe their cutest song, and that says a lot when the group we are talking about is KKB

**Mudkip1** (10): so good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song really captures such a specific Time 'n' Place (do 2018 Indie Pop in September ty) in the pandemic, when it still all felt a bit like a novelty, the toll of it all hadn't really hit us yet, we were still adjusting to all these new scenarios and restrictions, and there was this real sense of community to it, that we would all make it though this together. A very naive and innocent thought, in hindsight, but I really do love this track for that

**reput4tionera** (10): i hope that eloise is having an amazing day

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I love this song it's so cute

**runaway3212** (10): you know what fuck it im giving this a 10 too it's too perfect

**welcome2thejam** (10): A perfect encapsulation of the lockdown doldrums and just moving through all that, day by day

**apatel27** (9.5): A neat throwback sound

**wavingwolves** (9.5): true

**Awkward\_King** (9): this song rly magically captures lockdown so well i love it

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (9): a nice snapshot of the early pandemic

**BaconShoes** (9): ‚Äúi‚Äôm okay, you know, the usual kind of weird‚Äù so true

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): My American-centric ass did not realize this title was referencing a date for way too long.

**fairytalehigh** (9): the sound design on this is so good and the "happy birthday eloise" part is so sweet. really captures the weird mix of ennui and fear of lockdown

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This opens a portal to the Animal Crossing universe [2]

**modulum83** (9): bo burnham inside WISHES

**Stryxen** (9): ‚ÄúLast night‚Äôs pasta / In a tub‚Äù they will be analysing this song for decades in poetry classes

**throwaway-7650** (9): throwback to when I did a weed chicken (4/20 special) mukbang

**vayyiqra** (9): KKB captured what the worldwide lockdown was really like (uncertain, tedious, dull) better than most alleged "lockdown albums" you can't change my mind. And even better, they made it bop.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.3): cute!

**bbfan132** (8): this is v comfy

**imbaby122** (8): tbh a bit tired of covid content but this is very nice :)

**shhhneak** (8): is that‚Ä¶ a YY/MM/DD format?

**starlitsuns** (8): this is a cute little quarantine track.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): was definitely playing animal crossing that day

#people are dying, kim

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): cute little moment but it's just surrounded by 2 far better tracks so i kinda forget it exists

**bluetriangles04** (7): "I'm okay, you know, the usual kind of weird."

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre releasing a song about how happy they were the day after animal crossing new horizons came out and how they played it all night

**nicolas** (7): not too memorable compared to the rest of the ep tbh

**TiltControls** (7): yy/mm/dd > dd/mm/yy >>>>>> mm/dd/yy

**frogaranaman** (6): oh right it's pandemic music on the weed day

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this felt like it just existed and it seems like the weakest concept wise too

**IIIHenryIII** (6): the music video is more entertaining than the song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): if you go to the youtube upload of this song u/RandomHypnotica is the top comment

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): blaze it or something I don‚Äôt know

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.5): Nahhh my patience is just running thin at this point

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): gonna check my diary entry on this date and rate it based on that

**you2009** (5.5): a song that does its best to be a song but no matter how many times I listen to it I cannot remember a damn second of how it goes. great vibes though

**ImADudeDuh** (5): that was the day I listened to thank u next in full for the first time because I had to for the 2019 Ultimate Rate

**jman457** (5): just felt a bit boring

**pig-serpent** (0): This is cute I guess but it feels outclassed by the rest of the ep, and by extension everything else here.

This is soooo video game soundtrack... it sounds really cool but I honestly would say that I think it would be better as just an instrumental track. Sarah's vocals are all over the place and the song really lacks a solid, consistent vocal melody, which is a really important part of a pop song for me. I'd rather they just take that part out. The instrumental slays a lot though!!! With that, Civ I is gone, leaving just her younger, prettier sister Civ II remaining. Can it pull through for a win?

---

#gamers

**homestarguy** (10): This is the best multistage boss fight music ever recorded.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): video-game-boss-ass music

**vayyiqra** (10): This sounds like the score from a retro video game in the way KKB does best yet the lyrics are dark as fuck and that combo is intriguing. I read it as being about how climate change will lead to political crises. There could be a rise in xenophobia and refugees grow in numbers which is frighteningly plausible and could lead to the return of fascism. It just grabs you and starts the album so strongly; it's a statement that's quite striking coming from the group once known as the goofy flamingo meme band.

**BaconShoes** (9.5): i love the vibe here like i‚Äôm playing an old Sonic game or something idk, and then toward the end i just start ascending

**nt96** (9): Feels like I'm in Street Fighter

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): the top two comments on genius for this one are "this song makes me want to start a revolution" and "this song makes me want to play super mario 64 again" and like... yeah

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): the production sounds like a sonic the hedgehog 3 level, then the lyrics are about our late capitalist global hellscape. huzzah

**warjhybrid** (8.8): This sounds so much like a Pokemon Mystery Dungeon soundtrack cut, and I am here for it.

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Sounds dreamy and video gamey.  It's interesting and unique but unfortunately I feel like it's a fun curiosity at most and not a song worth revisiting too often.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): The ‚ÄúWar Never Changes‚Äù monologue, but if it had been for *Warioware* instead of *Fallout*

**rslashpoopheads** (7): it's bugsnax

**ImADudeDuh** (2): this all just sounds like a rip from a 90s SNES game from SiIvaGunner‚Äôs youtube channel

#anti-war

**apatel27** (10): Anti war anthem ftw

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (10): i never thought i'd see the day when kkb started singing about the evils of propaganda but i'm here for it

**bbfan132** (10): this production‚Ä¶. yes

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is kind of like the dullscythe of the ep

**Mudkip1** (10): this is a breath of fresh air after hearing lauren mayberry howl at me for an hour

**notchickeninspanish** (10): The transition at the end of this song is my Joker origin story.

**plastichaxan** (10): no this was so powerful i was shaking sisters

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this one wasn't an immediate favourite for me, but it finally clicked recently and boy is it great

**seanderlust** (10): I love this glitchy atmosphere with all the war strategy lyricism! sounds like being in the cyborgs' situation room when the robots rise up and try to defeat the humans.

**Stryxen** (10): stunning, fantastical production and incredible lyrics that establish the really impressive concept of the album. the instrumental seems quite silly at first but it perfectly complements the emotional story-telling. the vocals have an air of unbothered detachment while they present the plot almost like a documentary but it still makes me feel so much emotion. just. love this song.

**Uberpigeon** (10): I SEE BLOOD IN MY DREAMS!!!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Shaking ass to the war song again

**jman457** (9.3): Really digged the production

**bespectacIed** (9): post apopaloptic deep shit, lashawn beyond inspired this

**imbaby122** (9): i know this is on someone‚Äôs ‚Äúsoundtrack for the political revolution ü§©‚Äù playlist

**qazz23** (9): the final minute of this is so good

**reput4tionera** (9): this is ass shaking music

**Awkward\_King** (8): sarah bonito please i am free on tuesday PLEASE

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i hate how this song is still as topical as it was when it came out

**ricki** (8): bleep bloop music can be v fun

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): tussay, tussay, tussay

**you2009** (8): perfect song if not for the outro that makes U feel like U're being drowned in the primordial orange fanta from end of evangelion

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Had to elevate the song‚Äôs score when that divine ass breakdown hit, unfortunately

**runaway3212** (7.5): expensive af song

#does anyone thing war is a good thing? i love lady gaga i think she's a really interesting artist

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): music nerds will listen to an indie artist writing the most vaguely political lyrics of all time and act like theyre the next leader of the anarchist movement

**TiltControls** (7.5): a bit of a mess at times, but also kind of works?

**celladonn** (7): Very cool but can be a bit too discordant... love the outro though

**fadedblue09** (7): Is this meant to incite revolution?

**MassiveThief** (7): There are parts of this song that feel like they're trying way too hard to be weird, but there are still enough good parts to enjoy

**oscarbrierley1** (7): it starts off well but drags on and becomes repetitive in the second half

**thedoctordances1940** (7): has some funky moments

**ignitethephoenix** (6.3): the production is neat but I just the robotic sound of her voice, and the second half is just too incoherent and chaotic for my liking (especially the end).

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Even the least exciting song on this album still sounds pretty immaculate.

**frogaranaman** (6): what in the BLOPS

**modulum83** (6): kkb will go "how many fish do you have to eat before you make your skin turn pink? ^_^" one moment and then a second later be like IÃ∂ÕõÕñ Ã∑ÕêÃ≠SÃ∏ÕÅÃ≠EÃ∑ÃÄÃüEÃ∏ÕíÃ© Ã∂ÕãÃºBÃ∑ÃçÃ´LÃµÕÑÃ∞OÃ¥ÕòÃ§OÃ¥ÕóÃßDÃ∑ÃíÃ∞ Ã∏ÃíÃüIÃ∑ÕõÃûNÃ¥ÃèÕï Ã¥ÃâÕîMÃ∂ÕÇÃòYÃ∏ÃïÃ† Ã¥ÃìÃßDÃ∏ÃæÃüRÃ∑ÕòÃûEÃµÕãÃπAÃ∏ÕåÕâMÃ∑ÕåÃ≥SÃ¥ÕùÃÆ

**WillWorkForSugar** (6): this song is tiring

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): [The Art of War (Chinese: Â≠´Â≠êÂÖµÊ≥ï; lit. 'Sun Tzu's Military Method') is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (rough-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War)

**IIIHenryIII** (5): the end was the best part

**indie\_fan\_** (4.6): Sounds really promising in the first half, then goes downhill from there

**wavingwolves** (4.5): to say? to say? to say? to say? what about you saying NOTHING???.... sorry this song doesn't give.....

I was a little surprised to see this one excel in the rate, being the highest non-single from Nurture. But I do get that the lyrical sentiment resonates with a lot of people. For me personally, it's probably my least favourite on the album - sonically, it leans a little too hard into boring future bass for me to really care for it at all. But now we're in the 8.0+ range, so that's cool!

#MOTHERRRRRRR

**throwaway-7650** (10): bitches be like "MOTHERRR" and it's hatsune miku/some VTuber

**imbaby122** (9.5): THIS IS SO MOTHERRRR!!!!!

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): please put me in a special section with the other twenty comments that are just MOTHERRR

#drank from the mother lake

**astrologicalangel** (11): this song almost made me cry on first listen

**you2009** (11): shukran ya mama

**bespectacIed** (10): sobs were made. i'm a mama's boy thru and thru sorry

**bigbigbee** (10): I‚Äôm getting older and so are my parents. I can‚Äôt believe that there will ever be a time when I won‚Äôt have them with me. Listening to this song makes me feel a fierce gratitude and a desperate, painful ache and fear. Porter has a way of eliciting powerful feelings of happiness and sadness in the same song, and this is prime example of that - the happiness I feel when I think of my parents; the sadness I feel that these times will inevitably someday be over. Would have gotten my eleven if not for Musician.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): A fantastic song that reminds me to call my mom.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): sorry did you think we were done crying lets fix that

**DefaultPophead** (10): Probably the most underplayed on the album by me, but amazing and wonderful and gorgeous all the same

**fairytalehigh** (10): brb crying my eyes out

**frogaranaman** (10): will cry if this gets robbed

**ImADudeDuh** (10): wait a minute wait oh my wait please ohhh wow oh no wait WAIT please oh my god

**jay?** (10): guess who's back in the house converse click clackin about

**seanderlust** (10): hahaha cool cool cool I'm fully sobbing

**static\_int\_husp** (10): this gets a 10 because it makes me cry every fucking time I hear it

**Stryxen** (10): this song makes me wag my finger in agreement

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): god i get so emotional listening to songs about parents like this especially considering how complicated my relationship with my own mother is

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): if I was doing the comments yesterday I would've written something about Mother's Day

**vayyiqra** (10): This song's lyrics are so wholesome and make me appreciate my parents supporting me when I was mentally ill, as Porter talks about (side note: as well as depression I also picked up on that he's singing about OCD) and I need to tell my mother that and also talk to my dad more often too.

**jasannn** (9.5): main character energy

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): this album is fucking stacked with absolutely amazing songs (that aren't quite 10s)

**TiltControls** (9.5): Just a really sweet track!

**apatel27** (9): Beep Boops sound so good

**Awkward\_King** (9): mommy

**bluetriangles04** (9): huh? no i'm not crying... my eyes are just sweating there's a heat advisory hahaha...

**homestarguy** (9): This one is just so sweet, even if it‚Äôs not quite on the level of the other highlights for me.

**reput4tionera** (9): OH and finally if u wanna throw around midlife crisis fucking throw it at me - I‚Äôm getting older, I‚Äôm getting hotter, my tits are stunning, I‚Äôm in great shape, I‚Äôm dancing, I‚Äôm progressing and I‚Äôm living my best life - and that the tea

**starlitsuns** (9): mother is one of the two tracks that i cannot give a 10 to in a fair matter. it is very beautiful, it is just not worthy of a 10.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): in an unforeseeable turn of events, this song made me miss my mom

**welcome2thejam** (9): Here I go feeling melancholy again

**bbfan132** (8.5): very pretty song!!!

**celladonn** (8.5): going to go hug my mother

#mommy issues

**RoyalBloodFool** (8): Should be 10 but the crash on the left is just so annoying

**cremeebrulee** (7): probably best for my mental health that i‚Äôm doing this rate now and not two days from now when i move out of from my childhood home

**fadedblue09** (7): Sounds really sweet

**IIIHenryIII** (7): Darren Aronofsky outsold

**runaway3212** (7): pink floyd outsold

**jman457** (6.6): Florence and the Machine outsold

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): Sorry the lyrics are pretty sentimental yeah but the instrumental is a miss.

**wavingwolves** (6.1): porter robinson drank from madre lake to make this one

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): this song is an elaborate humblebrag‚Ä¶ like congrats on having a healthy relationship with your parents I guess :/

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): this production is just too much and detracts from the meaningful lyrics

**modulum83** (5): my relationship with my parents is not healthy enough for me to fully appreciate this

Following the album's great title track is yet another bop! As a lot of the comments mention, the highlight of this song is the key change - it gives it that extra oomph to bring it to the next level. It falls just outside of day 3, and I would have to agree that most of the magbay songs left are a bit better than this one.

---

#Dawn FM

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (10): god, the key change??? i mean granted it's not like this giant moment or anything but it elevates this from a 9 to a 10

**bespectacIed** (10): This song is so damn sexy, the prettier sister of the title track for sure. "Melancholy girls and nonbelievers, this is the dawning of the season" is such a cunty line I self-quote regularly. Favorite song on the album by a mile.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Listening to this while enjoying some legitimately nice Spring weather makes it hit even better. Can‚Äôt wait for it to be 100 degrees a week from now.

**homestarguy** (10): That key change and transition into ‚ÄúSecrets‚Äù are proof of God‚Äôs existence.

**jay?** (10): üíãüí£üòç

**nicolas** (10): the key change... everyone SHUT UP

**notchickeninspanish** (10): Idk why but this song feels like it's summoning a really sexy demon to me.

**qazz23** (10): neat key change at the end

**SFbby** (10): I was meh on this song initially, but it surprisingly went the hardest at their show, a real live performance glow-up

**throwaway-7650** (10): can never go wrong with a material girl reference

**welcome2thejam** (10): Starts off the best three-song stretch of the rate (and thanks to the transitions it feels like an actual trilogy!) with such a fine groove.

**cremeebrulee** (9.7): i normally hate last chorus key changes but i will give this a pass because it makes the transition into secrets incredible

**imbaby122** (9.5): so groovy and then they hit u with that key change so hot sexy

**sarcasticsobs** (9.2): it‚Äôs BASS time! key change! one of my favorite choruses on the record

**BaconShoes** (9): kinda funky, a bop. Is that a key change? Idk but it slaps

**fadedblue09** (9): Not a fan of the muffled vocals, but this is very slick and irresistible

**IIIHenryIII** (9): watch out, Carly! New disco darlings just dropped

**oscarbrierley1** (9): the bridge is transcendent

**ricki** (9): https://tenor.com/view/scarlett-johansson-dance-huang4evr-gif-23516847

**vayyiqra** (9): I really like the sophisti-pop sound of this but it frustrates me a bit that the lyrics are, as far as I can tell, gibberish. That one key change is pretty sick though; very well done.

**DirtyRat583** (8.7): its a fun little song

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Took that hoe The Weeknd‚Äôs shtick and made it theirs, did we have any choice but to stan?

**celladonn** (8.5): Such a good chorus and key change

**jman457** (8.5): Its fun bop that goes really well into the next song

**modulum83** (8.5): the transition to this song could kill a person

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): they took that outro and said "y'all motherfuckers want a key change?" (Yes)

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): this is very late day 2 vibes

**fairytalehigh** (8.3): i feel like the verses are a bit too slow, if only because the chorus is so fun

**bbfan132** (8): not my absolute favorite but i like the hook quite a bit! and it sounds v pretty

**bluetriangles04** (8): I love how smooth and playful the instrumental is, and the lyrical content just works with how magical it sounds too. The key change in the final chorus and the outro makes it sound really mystical lol.

**skargardin** (8): I still have no clue of what the Dawning of the Season refers to but it bops so go off i guess

**SmileAndTears** (8): hmmmm I'm not sure about that key change tbh

**Stryxen** (8): the chorus is so good, that like little drop into the first line... there is choreo being ographed in my head

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): by the time reveal comes school term should be over, dawning of the summer lets gooo

**TiltControls** (8): this reveal happening right before summer starts is peak timing

#autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place

**Uberpigeon** (8): the key change is... there

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.5): one of my least favorite vocal performances from mica methinks, kinda low energy, but we as a society love a key change

**shhhneak** (7.3): Melancholy Gwirl. Currently working on a Grammy meanwhile, pussy poppin' with ya man in Windows XP.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i love autumn too

**frogaranaman** (7): lingers way too long at the end. kinda like how winter lingered way too long this year

**pig-serpent** (7): Solid bassline and a good hook, but songs this short shouldn't be wearing out their welcome.

**reput4tionera** (7): dawning of the season more like yawning of the season am i right haha (i enjoy this song)

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): despite being a full song it kinda feels like an extended intro to ‚ÄúSecrets (Your Fire)‚Äù

**Awkward\_King** (6): key change so pussy

**rslashpoopheads** (6): groovy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): does anyone else think the beginning melody sounds like running up that hill

**apatel27** (5): Does the structure really have to be so basic? The transition was neat tho

**ImADudeDuh** (5): don‚Äôt care for ha

**wavingwolves** (4.5): the key change made me see what it could've been but wasn't which made me actively dislike the rest of the song for being so monotonous

**runaway3212** (4): when p4k said the perfect illusion modulation wasn't earned they clearly hadn't heard this yet.

This song truly did end up being the final girl... of day 2. Our last cut for the day is yet another blow at CHVRCHES - haven't they taken enough already? This is a big fan fave on the album and while I don't quite love it as much as some of the other bsides I definitely get the appeal, and it's a clear display of the album's theming which is cool to see. It would have been nice if they could have pulled through with 3 songs in day 3, but alas.

---

#the final girls (they survived yass)

**IIIHenryIII** (11): this is just perfection in the form of music; this is truly one of the best songs ever made. Her voice breaks my heart in this track, it's so full of emotion makes me believe in every single word she sings

**pig-serpent** (11): That guitar is a slay, but also, can we take a minute to shame whoever is saying Lauren Maybury needs to change her accent?  I can't imagine having that objectively terrible taste in women and that little shame about how terrible my taste in women is.

**apatel27** (10): After all the shit Lauren went through with being called a slut and asking for catcalling this is so damn sad

**Awkward\_King** (10): they kinda slayed w this one

**bespectacIed** (10): pretty girl problems. huuuge bop

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Feeling pressured to settle down, get married, and live that nuclear family life??? Couldn‚Äôt be me‚Ä¶

**celladonn** (10): Definitely the highlight of this album for me, everything about this is fantastic

**homestarguy** (10): Is it bad that the guitar-led songs are actually some of the best on this album??

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is the motherfucking smasha

**jay?** (10): üíãüí£üòç

**just\_thonking** (10): this song is pure exasperation. Also I love the Cure-like guitars

**Leixander** (10): love love love this one, the lyrics especially. the chorus is also perfect, lauren sounds like an angel. one of their best songs easily

**notchickeninspanish** (10): It took a few listens for the chorus to click for me in the context of the rest of the song, but whew.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is definitely my favourite track from the album but its also very IPR core

**runaway3212** (10): so fucking iconiccccc

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): haters will say this isn‚Äôt spooky enough but this could EASILY be a The Birthday Massacre song!!!

**seanderlust** (10): the build in tension on the postchorus...mwah

**skargardin** (10): smash!!

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): the way I scream this song

**throwaway-7650** (10): jenna ortega in horror movies/slashers for the rest of her career

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): these are some of lauren's best lyrics, which is a high compliment from me because i love her lyrics. anyways, gay people love horror movies so if this doesn't make day 3 during pride month that's really not slay nor is it yass

**warjhybrid** (10): The way this song just feels like it's ever-evolving, ESPECIALLY in the post-chorus. "DOES SHE LOOK LIKE ME"

**modulum83** (9.7): i love love love love LOVE jangly guitars holy shit

**Gonza\_90** (9.5): So true

**Stryxen** (9.5): me when my friend asks me what a synonym for last is

**wavingwolves** (9.1): slayed more than final girls by riley sager

**fadedblue09** (9): Sounds like straight out of soundtrack for a Netflix thriller series

**imbaby122** (9): ‚Äúi should quit maybe go get married‚Äù is so me at college after every minor inconvenience

**rslashpoopheads** (9): no items, fox only, final girl

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): one of the tightest choruses on the whole album, lauren really sells it. "i wonder if i should've changed my accent / tried to make myself more attractive / only time will tell" breaks my heart

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Where the album starts its slow decline, but this is a pretty good song for what its worth

**BaconShoes** (8.5): a smash

**bbfan132** (8.5): this is v pretty, i love how upbeat it is and the outro is cool

**bluetriangles04** (8.5): This whole album revolves around this horror film aesthetic that is so well done. In high school I took a dual credit for an intro to film class and talked about this trope of modern day horror films funnily enough... the "Final Girl" being the last victim left behind alive by the killer and having to deal with the traumatic consequences for the rest of their life. The front women of bands and even a range of female soloists are always the "Final Girls" in this aspect, where they are expected to give up their own lives to cater to the music industry

**TiltControls** (8.5): sigourney weaver queen

**DirtyRat583** (8.3): this is relaxing

**akanewasright** (8): why are these verses reminding me of an undertale fan song about the genocide route?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): can the interlude to this be final song

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): ‚Äúgo get married‚Äù is this the new ‚Äúgo to bed‚Äù

**jman457** (8): its a fun bop with a cute theme

**reput4tionera** (8): the way she says go get MARRIED is addicting

**shhhneak** (8): This horror movie concept is superior.

**nt96** (7.5): Jamie Lee Curtis

**frogaranaman** (7): kind of slay of them on the accent lines

**nicolas** (7): me when im playing in dead by daylight as meg thomas and im the only survivor left

**vayyiqra** (6): Definitely one of the stronger song on the album mainly because the chorus is really good. The verses have the same kind of clunky writing as a lot of the songs on here, where I feel bad because Lauren is saying something important but in a way I think is kind of clumsy. There. I said something nice about a song on this album. I feel so guilty tanking this album I am so sorry to Chvrches I am only doing what I feel must be done

#the stupid ppl that end up dying in the first act of the film bc they're having sex or smth

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (5): I kinda hate how this switches from minor to major in the chorus, it ruins the buildup of the song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): ‚Ä¶how is it that i feel no emotion whatsoever to this. somehow its so polished it rolls all the way back around to sounding incomplete

**2dina3dworld** (4): throw the bad 80s pastiche in! Now!

**starlitsuns** (4): the sound production is just overbearing, also the lyrics aren‚Äôt too memorable for me either
