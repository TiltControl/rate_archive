Our first cut for day three is one of the five remaining Porter songs. In my opinion this is just sliiiiightly not quite as good as the other singles that are remaining here so I'm not upset at this cut, but I mean I still gave it a 10 so...

---

#it will all be okay in the end

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): I really want to put an 11 for this one too, like the progression of this one is stellar!! My god. The breakdown here is just a chef‚Äôs kiss.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): IT‚ÄôS NO SURPRISE TO ME, I AM MY OWN WORST ENEMY.

**bluetriangles04** (10): there's something about this song to me that is just insanely nostalgic??? not to mention the lyrics are just a callback to where I am in life weirdly. "I don't know what's good for me"

**cremeebrulee** (10): maybe i should be nicer to myself üßçüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**CrimsonROSET** (10): queue this is my little box of self doubt liz phair clip

**DefaultPophead** (10): Legit no bad songs on this album. Already I feel this one being underappreciated.

**frogaranaman** (10): imposter syndrome is a bitch

**IIIHenryIII** (10): a solemn man: "a slightly better song could get an 11"

**imbaby122** (10): maybe i‚Äôm self-critical but that quality would give me a very good edit on drag race

**rslashpoopheads** (10): obsessed

**starlitsuns** (10): this gives the feeling of wanting to be something more again. i really do not have any other words to explain it

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this song hits hard

**throwaway-7650** (10): the best single isn't look at the sky... or musician... it's THIS! :noits:

**vayyiqra** (10): Already said this about "Look at the Sky" but that narration at the end is also my unironic daily affirmation. oh yeah and he's right about being too hard on yourself I do that a lot. Damn, Porter gets it.

**apatel27** (9.5): Believing in yourself is cool and good

**homestarguy** (9.5): What a freakin‚Äô groove, and the perfect time for a pick-me-up on the album.

**TiltControls** (9.5): I don't listen to this track enough, I forgot how fantastic it is! Could do without the interspersed voiceparts, but that doesn't detract from it at all

**jay?** (9): üíãüí£üòç

**pig-serpent** (9): This is a strictly better version of Sweet Time.

**Stryxen** (9): imagining myself in an edit to this 24/7

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): love the concept and execution of this song and i would love for more pop artists to cover these sorts of topics. also the ending bangs !!

**wavingwolves** (9): this is a 1975 song and you don't even really need to think about it to notice

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i hate the ending like ok motivational speaker im in therapy for a reason but otherwise this is brilliant

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (8.5): yeah this song really captures that feeling of just criticizing yourself for everything and feeling like a burden, damn it porter why do you gotta hit this hard

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): i think porter tackles the introspective themes of the album better on the other songs, but i love the production on this one

**bespectacIed** (8): camp

**reput4tionera** (8): slayed

**runaway3212** (8): who let magbay out of their cage

#this song is a burden

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): why does it sound like Little Simz in the end

**BaconShoes** (7): ok i liked this one more

**bbfan132** (7): once again, a well-liked single that isn‚Äôt fully clicking‚Ä¶ ugh! still good though

**welcome2thejam** (7): "Keep going, it will all be okay in the end." Honestly thanks Porter Robinson's inner voice, I really needed to hear that

**modulum83** (6.7): this is wayyyy too emo but i admit it also hits. points deducted for sampling the godforsaken School of Life youtube channel as the center of the song. fuck you.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i think i liked the sentiment more than the actual song itself

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I appreciate his messaging but these lyrics feel like a middle schooler‚Äôs poetry

**jman457** (5): I feel like this could be better

Nurture's lead single falls here, but making day 3 is still a pretty good run. I remember when this dropped way back in January of 2020, a pre-pandemic relic. It was a great introduction to the new album era and a very welcome return to Porter releasing music (under his own name).

---

#got their wish

**\_\_Avaritia** (11): So distinctly remember when this song came out and I went BALLISTIC replaying it (and became my top song of 2020), like I couldn‚Äôt believe this was the same Porter from that made Worlds. I knew back then this was going to be a record to look out for, especially when that fucking chorus hits like holy shit!!

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (10): endlessly bright and joyous

**bespectacIed** (10): this song is sooo suffocatingly positive, it's a nightmare to listen to at specific headspaces and points in your life (2)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yes I did. I wished for a great electropop album.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song is so gorgeous and would absolutely be my porter 11. perfectly encapsulates the feeling of watching your passion become more and more unfulfilling over time and not being able to reverse that feeling... i guess there‚Äôs sort of happy ending here, but i haven‚Äôt quite gotten there myself yet so this song just kind of makes me cry lol

**DefaultPophead** (10): Oh God, it's really going to hurt seeing this album receive any scores below 8...

**frogaranaman** (10): this came out when I was studying abroad in Madrid before COVID. the absolute chokehold this song had on me on my Metro commutes was UNREAL

**jay?** (10): WOAHHHHHHHHH üíãüí£üòç

**Leixander** (10): maybe men deserve rights too

**Mudkip1** (10): wait this slapped

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this track was always good, but the version in the secret sky 2021 performance elevated it to one of my favourites

**runaway3212** (10): the first tracks on this album slay literally so much

**starlitsuns** (10): i do not have many thoughts on this, other than that the music video is perfect for this. water karaoke? hell yes. this is a karaoke song now. i will not change my mind.

**vayyiqra** (10): When that lick comes in at the intro I feel such a sense of relief; it's not explainable. This whole album feels like a weight being lifted off of you. The piano and synth together are also transcendent. Yes I'm being pretentious; I do not care.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.6): my wish is for porter to win this rate against the odds

**homestarguy** (9.5): That Toby Fox-ian intro and groove is so infectious, and then how it morphs in and out of that anthemic chorus is pure bliss.

**apatel27** (9): Classic Worlds sound

**bbfan132** (9): this is really good, love the maximalist production and the beat

**CrimsonROSET** (9): if all else fails i bet he can make a killing as vocaloid

**imbaby122** (9): anthem for validation seekers

**jasannn** (9): Though the original fits the inspirational and calmer theme of the album, I much prefer the DJ NOT PORTER ROBINSON remix. It‚Äôs a lot faster and weebier and wouldn‚Äôt have sound out of place on Worlds.

**modulum83** (9): this is FUNKY

**pig-serpent** (9): I don't love the instrumental on this one but it's stupidly catchy sooooooooooooo

**seanderlust** (9): me when i make a wish with my fairy godparents and it isn't against Da Rules

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): no Porter, anime rate didn't get in the cycle

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): he really has a way with those giant skyscraping choruses

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): some of porter's songs kind of sound like walls of noise to me but i usually at least like the melodies they are so pretty

**wavingwolves** (8.1): üòïüôÅ‚òπÔ∏èüòüüò•üò¢

**bluetriangles04** (8): I really enjoyed the chorus on this piece, and the violin really worked well with it

**reput4tionera** (8): the anamanaguchi remix of this goes absolutely insane (the original is also very good)

**Stryxen** (8): wii sports resort island gyal

#..... did not get their wish

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): not a big fan of the vocal effect; honestly, that's my main issue with this album

**TiltControls** (8): Compared to the rest of the singles I think this is the weakest. Lacks a bit of the punch that the other tracks have. That said, it's still really great

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I like the message and the chorus is explosive, I just wish that the verses were more musically satisfying.

**jman457** (7.5): its a cute moment

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.5): i know why he edits his voice, but i do think i would've liked this one more without the vocal editing. just a little undercooked imo, but the instrumental progression is undeniably euphoric

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i feel like the verses to this are really weak and not really that memorable? but it still sounds really pretty

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): yer a wizard Aladdin!

Mercurial World's title track is the first cut out of a very resepctable 6/15 songs in day 3. It's definitely a song that I think a lot of people enjoy but nobody is really tripping over themselves to yass over it, so this is an apt placement.

---

#MERCURIAL GWORLS

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Outsold Madonna and the rest of the other pop girlies. Yeah I said it.

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (10): the first "actual" song on this album is also really fun and immaculately produced! plus the Madonna interpolation is perfect

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Now THIS is a title track. Encompassing the themes and the sound of the album perfectly.

**jay?** (10): üíãüí£üòç

**jman457** (10): this really feels like the comfort in a lie

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): one of my favorites overall, i loveeee how the production swells and retreats. and the material girl nod at the end is very slay and very yass

**vayyiqra** (10): Idk I'm tired but this is just cool; also the part with the Madonna kind-of-interpolation is neat.

**celladonn** (9.5): Slaps

**imbaby122** (9.5): what does mercurial mean it‚Äôs one of those words i always look up and forget immediately

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.5): and I am a Mercurial Girl!

**BaconShoes** (9): madonna who

**bbfan132** (9): this production is gorgeous

**bluetriangles04** (9): A solid title track! A good introduction to the incoming songs afterwards as well.

**fairytalehigh** (9): IMMERCURIAL BOYS, IMMERCURIAL GIRLS

**homestarguy** (9): Wait I thought the last song was the end??? Well, I‚Äôm glad they kept going.

**reput4tionera** (9): we love a title track

**skargardin** (9): I was today years old when I found out that the outro interpolates Madonna's Material Girl

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): for a title track this feels quite underrated

**thedoctordances1940** (8.7): very slay

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): MERCURIAL GWORL!!!!

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Love this one too, it feels like I'm being sucked into a universe

**Leixander** (8.5): the nod to the material girl at the end is so cute

**wavingwolves** (7.4): slaycurial yassrld

**frogaranaman** (7): this is good but is also one of those songs that just sounds like the Spotify algorithm at points

**modulum83** (7): we're spinning around, let it rain down, living in a society

#mercurial high has dwindled

**rslashpoopheads** (7): that prechorus is crack but the chorus ain't doing it for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): minus one point because she started singing to the tune of material girl at the end

**Uberpigeon** (7): ended madonna

**welcome2thejam** (7): That post-chorus explosion is such a joy to listen to, it's a great way to start the album

**pig-serpent** (6): A much better introduction to this album's style than "The End."  Sadly it also doesn't feel like it goes anywhere and just fizzles out at the end.

**runaway3212** (5): madonna is yass but this song isn't

**apatel27** (4): It's just a standard edm track with chiptune added at the end

After being a little worried for the album coming off of He Said She Said, this song came out of nowhere and really blew me away. It's really unlike anything they had done prior, which, as much as I love their general sound and style, was amazing to see since they tend not to stray away from what they've already established. The gothic rock vibes and that amazing production, with the theatrical hook, it all comes together to make a song that DESERVED BETTER! I get that it's a little long, it has a m*n on it, the vibe isn't for everyone... but wow I have to say that I expected and hoped that this would at least make top 10. It's not even the top song for CHVRCHES, which is surprising given that this was the big single and the only song of theirs to make the top 100 songs of 2021 list.

---

#Conscious

**moooo566** (11): this song is the one that turned me from a casual "oh yeah i like chvrches" person to a "holy shit i fucking love chvrches" person

**notchickeninspanish** (11): Absolute barn-burner of a track. Even without Robert Smith, this would be my 11, but the way he harmonizes with Lauren here is sublime. The song recalls some of the best moments of The Cure's discography, so his feature here is very fitting.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): the nerve of 11-ing a goth rock song in a rate devoted to electronic pop

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (11): this song is honestly like my CIA sleeper agent code word or whatever, when i hear those opening synths i automatically wistfully look off into the distance. also i saw this song live WITH robert smith so i think i would know what score it deserves better than you üôÑ

**warjhybrid** (11): CHVRVHES and Robert Smith team up to make the theme song of 2021. Absolutely gorgeous

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): I really don‚Äôt know what to say other than: chief, this is it. This is really it.

**apatel27** (10): Stan Robert Smith

**BaconShoes** (10): Robert Smith hops on the randomest songs üò≠ this is so good though

**bbfan132** (10): love the atmosphere here!

**bespectacIed** (10): collab of the year, like this was a slayage of epic proportions

**bigbigbee** (10): I was assigned the write-up for this for the [Popheads Top 100 Songs of 2021 list](https://itsrai.medium.com/the-top-100-tracks-of-2021-according-to-r-popheads-25-1-4c104eee06de). I won‚Äôt repost the whole writeup, but I will reiterate that I think that this was a notable and wonderful departure from CHVRCHES‚Äô signature brightness, and a fantastic use of a feature (I don‚Äôt know if the song works this well with another guest artist)

**bluetriangles04** (10): ROBERT FUCKIN SMITH???

**cremeebrulee** (10): they got me here i can‚Äôt help that i have a fear of drowning and a love of water metaphors

**frogaranaman** (10): they always teach you how not to drown, never how to üôÑ‚ÄºÔ∏è

**Gonza\_90** (10): This was one of my most listened songs of last year for a reason

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I mean...

**ImADudeDuh** (10): AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

**imbaby122** (10): conscious while drowning is the best way to describe me this past semester, very traumatic experience

**just\_thonking** (10): Lifeguards HATE this one weird trick

**MassiveThief** (10): Robert Smith sounds amazing and the chemistry between him and Lauren is awesome.

**seanderlust** (10): an easy favorite from the album. the urgency with which they sing this is compelling

**skargardin** (10): this song probably fulfills the albbum concept the best

**Stryxen** (10): i thought this was incredibly mid on release - but i really like it now, definitely a grower even though there are still a few vocal moments i find annoying. but that‚Äôs just chvrches lol

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): they should've named this "The Cure to Drowning"

**throwaway-7650** (10): 70 plays useless because of tags CATCH IT @ last.fm

**wavingwolves** (10): If You Push Me In A Pool Im Not Swimming Back Up Enjoy Yo Murder Case

**welcome2thejam** (10): God that chorus hook is something else, the perfect amount of anthemic.

**you2009** (10): don't get the robert smith hate he's amazing on this one

**celladonn** (9.5): yes Robert Smith slay

**homestarguy** (9.5): CHVRCHES but goth. The live performance of this with Robert Smith at the NME Awards is magical.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): a good song on this album omg

**Awkward\_King** (9): who asked for this man (song good otherwise)

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i mean, this was the song they needed right? Like ‚Äòhey we can still be taken seriously i swear‚Äô

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Robert Smith‚Äôs part certainly does exist on here‚Ä¶other than that it‚Äôs very good

**pig-serpent** (9): It's a great song, although I feel like it's a little overhyped because Robert Smith is on it, and honestly that's more than a good reason to overhype something.

**runaway3212** (9): the girl getting Australian accent lessons from the guy

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): i love robert smith but his placement here feels sort of unnecessary? lauren completely crushes the song and he's just like, there. still a banger though

**modulum83** (8.7): how to yass and slay

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Somewhat rockier and lightly produced than the other tracks and almost Evanescence-ish, I can see why it's a favorite.

**jman457** (8.2): the goths won with this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I really respect the fact that Robert Smith has kept the dream of the 80s alive by maintaining his signature look until present day.

**reput4tionera** (8): we love a long song

**rslashpoopheads** (8): contrary to popular opinion, I think this song is just pretty good

#drowned

**indie\_fan\_** (8): Robert brought this song down a number

**jay?** (8): the MAN? Not to be * that * kind of lgbt but he genuinely made me unhappy.. an unpleasant addition

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): this being the first time we're rating some part of The Cure in a main rate‚Ä¶ upsetting

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I‚Äôm imagining someone trapped in a room slowly filling with water frantically trying to figure out how to survive but Google is only giving them results for this song

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): can't tell if it's my inner contrarian speaking but i'm not hearing what yall are hearing...

**shhhneak** (7.4): A little overrated and emo for me.

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (7): it's good, but why is the outro so damn long? every time I listen to this song I think "oh, it's about to end now" and then I look over and there's still two minutes left. I already sat through all of parklife for the britpop rate, I don't need any more songs with unnecessarily long outros!

**plastichaxan** (7): people died‚Ä¶ they died like 5 minutes before the song taught them how not to drown

**TiltControls** (7): cure rat when

**Leixander** (6): honestly this is one of the most boring songs on the album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): how are you gonna get robert smith to collab with you and you put him on the most mid song of all time

**vayyiqra** (4): I have to be open here even though I never want to be Darjphobic but I must be a little right now: I don't like Robert Smith. I don't like the Cure. I've been trying to make myself like both those things for almost twenty years now, and I don't. Like the proverbial "fetch", it's not going to happen. I like maybe two songs by them. It's like when Lou Reed is featured on anything: it's neat that he's here because he's a living legend or whatever, but he doesn't add anything to the song. Some parts of this song are good but his part is bad and Lauren's parts aren't all that great either; the chorus is really boring. I don't think this is a good collab. :hanawinsCries:

**jasannn** (3): sorry to my discord besties who 10‚Äôd this but this is so boring and basic

**ricki** (3): i think it‚Äôs ugly sounding and i dont like the guy‚Äôs voice

**2dina3dworld** (2): how to squander a Robert Smith feature.

RIP. I think everyone expected CHVRCHES to perform the worst by a fair margin, but not even getting one song in the top 10 is... a lot. It's really a shame for me and the rest of the Screen Violence stans, but I must admit it's cool to see this song in particular get the top spot for the album. How Not To Drown was the fan favourite single, but I think this song is the crowning jewel of the album and deservingly has got at least some of her flowers in this rate. If it were up to me I'd have the song placing like 10 spots higher, but oh well.

---

#YOU STILL MATTER

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): The way I transcended after the drop‚Ä¶ now imagine that shit playing live and watching the entire arena go apeshit to ‚ÄúYOU STILL MATTER!‚Äù, that would be a sight.

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (10): this is the one song on the album I really like. chvrches are at their best when they're building to a massive climax, just look at clearest blue

**BaconShoes** (10): the way it builds up, it‚Äôs just so good omg

**bespectacIed** (10): flawless opener like this is soo classic chvrches from the ultra pristine bright synths to the cheesy lyrics lol it's like seeing an old friend

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Now one thing you can say for Chvrches is they easily have the best opening track in this rate.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i‚Äôm going to be very brave here and say that this album is not that bad, and this is proof of it- it has a concept but it can still be extremely diverse

**homestarguy** (10): Just classic CHVRCHES with a lovely vocoder flourish. Would fit right at home on The Bones of What You Believe. Criminally unloved!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this was my favorite on first listen; I just love the buildup. It starts so cozy and emotional, and then kaboom

**jay?** (10): üíãüí£

**jman457** (10): Great way to start the album

**Leixander** (10): chvrches and songs with great build up, a perfect duo

**notchickeninspanish** (10): If they could make an album that has this level of melodrama/production from front to back, I think it would win the rate for me.

**reput4tionera** (10): more like slaying for a friend ha ha

**runaway3212** (10): "I cheated and I lied, but I meant it when I cried" is a top 2 sentence in this rate and it's not 2

**shhhneak** (10): I‚Äôm CHVRCHES‚Äô friend.

**skargardin** (10): I feel like this is so underrated, like it feels quintessential CHVRCHES with the glossy synths, booming chorus and lyrical themes.

**starlitsuns** (10): the second half of this track is so euphoric, I could easily start screaming ‚Äúyou still matter‚Äù or ‚Äúhome // can we go?‚Äù in a car if i could drive <3

**Stryxen** (10): their best song and i will defend with my life . what a serve

**TiltControls** (10): now this is the chvrches I love

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): if there's one thing chvrches is gonna do it's make a song with a bonkers emotional climax... trust and believe

**wavingwolves** (10): üëâüëâIs there a safe way of putting an eggplant on your ass? Asking for a friend‚Ä¶.. üò¨üòâü§£ü§£

**just\_thonking** (9.5): only recently realized the double meaning of the title... like asking on behalf of a friend vs. asking for someone to be your friend

**modulum83** (9.5): YOU STILL MATTERRRRRRR

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): this is the strongest Lauren's accent has ever been in a song and it's amazing

**fairytalehigh** (9.1): gives me strong "now is not the time" vibes and i fucking LOVE that song. this makes me wanna go roller skate

**bluetriangles04** (9): The buildup for this song makes it honestly the best choice for an introduction to the album and the overall theme of it.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): the moments of quiet and the moments of an explosion of synths? WOW!!!

**nicolas** (9): there is pussy and cunt in this track

**pig-serpent** (9): This song has everything I love about this album, but it lacks one special moment to pick it up to a 10.

**SmileAndTears** (9): BOP

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): the Chvrches formula at its best

**apatel27** (8.5): What a drop

**imbaby122** (8.5): chvrches daily affirmations - repeat you still matter 100 times to a mirror

**jasannn** (8.5): This may or may not be getting a good score just bc it sounds like Clearest Blue which I discovered from watching Heartstopper

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): me trying to bargain info during dude's ratemas game

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): shes afraid of dying? so what? everyones afraid of that

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): a classic chvrches song in the sense that i feel whatever about it until the drop happens lol

**akanewasright** (8): oh this is good actually

**bbfan132** (8): nice intro!!

#None of it mattered

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i think this went on for about a minute too long. y‚Äôall could‚Äôve gotten a 10 from me chvrches!!

**Awkward\_King** (7): this song goes on at the same level for too long but the first half is slay

**fadedblue09** (7): Overstays its welcome but sets the album up quite well

**oscarbrierley1** (7): it's almost great, but something about it doesn't quite click for me.

**frogaranaman** (6): outro on this song is insane

**vayyiqra** (6): I like the Imogen Heap kind of vocal effect at the beginning I guess

**welcome2thejam** (6): Solid opener, takes us on a nice mix of places

**2dina3dworld** (4): did they let a high schooler write this for them

**Overall Average**: 7.558 **// Average Controversy:** 1.855

---

Well. That didn't go so well, did it? I mean, to be fair, 7.558 isn't a bad average, we have seen MUCH worse, and it's more of just a testament to how stellar the other 3 projects are, but it's definitely disappointing. I really love this album and CHVRCHES as a whole so it's sad to see them flounder so much and to see so much bashing of them, but so it goes. Getting to rate it at all should be celebrated, I think! Shoutout to all my CHVRCHES enjoyers, we suffer together! I recall a lot of questioning regarding this album's inclusion in the rate, with some people saying it didn't fit and wasn't up to the quality of the others. While I disagree with the latter, I can see where the former is coming from, but in the end it's just a silly song ranking numbers game. You can catch them on the "Earliest Exits" section of the rate wiki now though, so there's that!

**IIIHenryIII** (10.077): This is one my favorite albums of all time. It's also the album that turned me into a fan of the band. Before its release, I was just a casual listener, but everything changed after I heard this. It's full of beautiful melodies and clever lyrics. As a big fan of horror movies, I really appreciate the concept. Maybe that's the reason why I love this album so much.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.808): my absolute favorite album of 2021 from my absolute favorite band. even though i have never subscribed to the love is dead hater agenda, i was still so psyched to see them truly return to form and deliver a universally acclaimed album that checks off all the boxes. every song is great and in classic CHVRCHES fashion, the emotional arc of the album is immaculate. i kinda worry that this album will flop but it will NOT be by my hand!!! very high average approaching.

**krusso1105** (9.385): This was my favorite album of 2021

**bespectacIed** (9.154): despite the considerably weaker back half (still good tho) the spectacular, flawless front half still made this one of my fave albums last year. Return to form for THEE synthpop supremes

**throwaway-7650** (9.115): this was one of my AOTYs last year and doing this rate only solidified that, there's only one (1) weak song imo (the fact that it was the lead single... anyway) and the deluxe tracks actually improve the album as a whole. really hoping this album isn't trashed and my personal faves don't get too robbed (something other than how not to drown better make day 3!) I will hate popheads forever if screen violence pulls a planet her

**just\_thonking** (9.038): hold up is this my favorite Chvrches album ???

**shhhneak** (9.031): This album did not get the flowers it deserved from popheads! It‚Äôs such a bop-heavy project all worthy of day three. I‚Äôm sorry for the person I‚Äôm going to be if/when it gets robbed.

**moooo566** (9.000): every song on this album is such an anthem, it's really next level. i got covid seeing this live and i'd do it again.

**pig-serpent** (9.000): This is exactly the album I wanted Chvrches to make coming off of Love Is Dead.  Their songwriting continued to improve and get more consistent, but they also took out all of the bad mainstreamification elements and replaced them with horror tropes.  I mean I wasn't expecting the horror tropes but it was a very good call.

**indie\_fan\_** (8.938): I don‚Äôt I‚Äôll ever get the hate for this album. Then again, I haven‚Äôt heard any of their albums before this, so I don‚Äôt really know the fans‚Äô expectations

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.923): I still appreciate how they named the deluxe version Director's Cut, cool move

**sarcasticsobs** (8.800): the most consistent record for me

**apatel27** (8.731): Doesn't always hit the concept but damn it's a good album

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.615): Honestly this was my first CHVRCHES record, but even listening to their debut, it‚Äôs kind of clear that Screen Violence is a stand-out in every single way. And it‚Äôs a record that just seems to get better and better with every listen as well. I have a feeling that all 3 minus KKB records will probably land somewhere near each other in score - this one might just catapult the others though, even if I think it‚Äôs my 3rd favourite. There are some monstrous bangers here that I was extremely happy to revisit, and somehow the Director‚Äôs Cut is pretty good too? Either way wow this record rules.

**fairytalehigh** (8.569): probably the tightest CHVRCHES album--their first 2 are epic but sprawling, and love is dead is a mess. a fantastic return to form and one of my favorite albums of the year.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.515): On a personal level, I really overlistened to The Bones of What You Believe back in 2014, and then also did the same with Every Open Eye in 2016, and by that point I found myself so burnt out on CHVRCHES i didn't think I'd ever be able to enjoy them again... and yet, this album has managed to pull me in. It only suffers here because it's being compared to such monolithically incredible projects.

**imbaby122** (8.423): no surprise that an album written by an artist who wants to quit her career resonates with a college student who desperately wants to drop out. it‚Äôs a situation that definitely makes me feel like the protagonist in an 80s horror movie sometimes lol. beyond a thematic standpoint i loveee the way this album sounds. it‚Äôs the type of dark electropop that feels ominous and desperate instead of corny. for sure one of my favorite albums of 2021.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.108): insane how good this album is

**skargardin** (8.077): Such a return to form following Love Is Dead. It loses some steam to me toward the back-half but it's still really solid.

**modulum83** (8.023): not quite my favorite CHVRCHES album - every open eye has much more fun and catchy songs than this, frankly - but it's really consistent and there's a lot of thematic material to chew on that makes this a surprisingly fulfilling listen. it's never truly pop magic, but it's something intriguing of its own.

**jman457** (8.008): Ok l haven't been that moved by a Chrvches song since Bury it but this may be their magnum opus

**SmileAndTears** (7.992): You know what? Maybe I'm warming up to Chvrches after all. I blame Heartstopper and that scene with Clearest Blue. Or maybe it's just that this album is good, idk

**welcome2thejam** (7.846): A great return to form for CHVRCHES. Insane middle stretch.

**nt96** (7.769): I've never been a fan of Chvrches. Something about their sound always annoyed me, however that's not the case here. This was an enjoyable album with some great songwriting.

**bigbigbee** (7.654): I think that this album is actually really good! I personally think it‚Äôs at its best when it‚Äôs most pretty and melodic (Lullabies, How Not To Drown, California, Final Girl). I think the best stuff on this can easily stand up to their previous records, and while I get that this may not be for everyone who liked the other albums in this rate, I think it‚Äôs a great pop album and I think that her voice is special.

**MassiveThief** (7.423): I'm so glad I did this rate, because I thought this album was very mid when it came out and barely listened to it. But something clicked I guess, because so many of these songs are among their best. Just amazing production and writing, the only bad song for me is the lead single lol

**TiltControls** (7.385): A little bit of a step down for me from their previous work, but solid overall

**DirtyRat583** (7.208): this isnt as much of a slay as bestie Every Open Eye but it is still pretty good, and He Said She Said is an impeccable song

**oscarbrierley1** (7.154): this album kind of blends together for me. It's all fine, but there is only a couple of stand outs. I also kind of hate her accent on some of the songs (I'm scottish so I only feel half guilty about saying that).

**starlitsuns** (7.115): I really love the first five tracks off this album, but following How Not To Drown this album drops in quality quickly. I still love the concept of the album though, I just think it would do better as an EP which is a shame.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.077): i‚Äôm shocked that a lot of people don‚Äôt like this album?? maybe its not the most mindblowing music in the world but it‚Äôs still a solid pop album and theres some great bangers on here. easily the best work chvrches has ever put out and i hope they get even better from here.

**Stryxen** (7.077): really cool album concept, slightly underwhelming album

hikkaru: 
**Uberpigeon** (6.923): chvrches music sounds like you could just feed it all into an algorithm and just make ai-generated chvrches songs and you would not be able to notice a difference. There is never anything new or interesting or fresh or different from song to song. it's not bad music i just get very tired listening to a whole album of worse versions of The Mother We Share

**notchickeninspanish** (6.692): The back end kinda drags on, but the highlights are up there with the best music they've put out.

**starla\_** (6.646): (Average: 6.6)

**fadedblue09** (6.615): Despite this album getting my highest average, it still suffers from the issues I have with CHVRCHES in general (overproduction, etc.). Though I do find the concepts of the songs intriguing and at times it feels like a soundtrack to some modern psychological thriller on Netflix (in a good way).

**thedoctordances1940** (6.469): Yeah I just really don't particularly care for much of this album at all. How Not To Drown is really good but apart from that there's nothing I'd ever revisit

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (5.885): while the rest of the albums in this rate are all really creative and adventurous, this one just feels... really standard? like there's nothing that really stands out about this album, most of the songs kinda blend together and sound generic. oh well

**plastichaxan** (5.846): I don‚Äôt get how they fucked up such a good concept in the execution, I really like CHVRCHES but here I was disappointed, from the title of the album to the song titles this had such a strong concept and then all songs just blended together with most of them blending together in sound apart from a few, and the extra tracks being more interesting than most of the album‚Ä¶ idk this could‚Äôve been a really nice EP that ended up unrated as 2021 EPs did

**qazz23** (5.692): a lot of this felt generic and lacked variety, but the bonus tracks were good

**vayyiqra** (5.154): I dreaded rating this album. See, I love Chvrches. I gave them very good scores when we rated them before. I saw Chvrches in 2018 and had a great time. This year I could've seen them again and chose to pass on it because I don't like this album. This is the only Chvrches album I don't like. I even like Love Is Dead. The way I feel about this album is how many fans felt about that album, I guess. One problem is the horror aesthetic and theme. I don't like horror. It's not a genre I like, it's not my thing; it just makes me feel bad. I am also guilty of not trying to look at the lyrics on this album closely because of that, which is something I did for the other three albums. What I do hear of the lyrics is often not good though. (This makes me feel even worse because I know Lauren tried to put feminist themes into them and that's important to her and she has been the target of a lot of sexism.) Musically this album is okay but it feels like Chvrches on autopilot, like an AI was trained to write Chvrches songs. I love synthpop, but drenching everything in synth doesn't inherently make a song good and these songs are just mediocre. I hope I like their next album because they can do much better than this.

**frogaranaman** (4.462): I can put up with you liking this if you're hot enough

**LesApfels** (4.423): I'm sorry but basically all the songs blend together and it gets repetitive

**2dina3dworld** (4.192): I always discounted Chvrches because I thought of them as a second-rate Paramore (don‚Äôt ask). Turns out, I think I was right not paying them much notice. This album is so bland, so without character, without anything but some annoying synths and a singer who sounds objectively good, but ultimately really flavourless. It‚Äôs not a terrible album, just boring. There‚Äôs a couple of terrible songs, and a unredeemably terrible feature by Robert Smith that really makes him sound like a ‚Äòwhinebag‚Äô as Morrissey eloquently put it (obligatory fuck Morrissey), but ultimately, my reaction is just ‚Äúmeh‚Äù.

This is a cute little track. I wouldn't personally put it top 10 when the quality is so high among the best of the best in this rate but it's very fun so I can't be too mad. Better than CHVRCHES' best? i don't personally think so :(

---

#hysterical

**apatel27** (10): Funk based existential crisis is the best existential crisis

**Awkward\_King** (10): i love this song sm, the whimsical melody, the breathiness of the vocals sounds so good when mica does it, the kinda plodding 60s beatles esque rhythm, its like a psychedelic but you're wearing a blue suit

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (10): paranoid banger

**bespectacIed** (10): This encapsulates the album's overall lyrical theme better than the title track, I feel like. This is what got me i to magbay, such excellence

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I know this is gonna do significantly worse than the other three MagBay singles and that‚Äôs SO wrong. What a classic bop.

**frogaranaman** (10): this is so me and my friend when we're doing something hysterical (arson)

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): one of my favorite songs in the rate, love listening to this one it just has good energy

**homestarguy** (10): Ugh this was *this close* to being my 11. I absolutely adore this song, it‚Äôs yassified Doobie Brothers. An instant classic for me, personally.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): best song on the album? Not sure, but definitely one of the best choruses in history

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the best song on the album

**jay?** (10): üíãüí£üòç YASSSS

**nicolas** (10): the piano in the chorus just

**notchickeninspanish** (10): This isn't their best song, but I think it's their most even. The lyrics finally feel like they are punching up with the production.

**plastichaxan** (10): those little ‚Äúuh‚Äùs before the chorus live in my mind rent free

**RandomHypnotica** (10): raters at reveals being shocked at the results they made

**reput4tionera** (10): how do i spell extistenailism. extentsentialism. extenstential . how. extestentional . PLEASE HOW DO I SPELL THIS existentialism. ok auto correct understood now anyway this is existentialism if it served cunt

**Stryxen** (10): i just adore this song... probably my fav magbay, and is on my all time favourite songs playlist. campy synthy slay but also despair poohascend catcry lyrics

**TiltControls** (10): this is the best track on the album and I won't hear any word against it

**welcome2thejam** (10): A song about paranoia and anxiety + the biggest bop you got = the musical equivalent of drug commercials reading off terrible side effects while everybody's smiling and dancing

**modulum83** (9.7): hysterical us...suckin in cocks again

**BaconShoes** (9.5): a mood

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): this song is so catchy. I love the upward then downward Piano bit, it's so satisfying to me.

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): This is the yassification of yacht rock (complimentary). The beat of the chorus sounds just like What A Fool Believes, and I can hear some Steely Dan-isms in the lyrics.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.2): *love* the keys

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Why does this song remind me of a Persona OST track, is it the piano?

**bbfan132** (9): i love how sunny this is

**just\_thonking** (9): me when my us is hysterical

**rslashpoopheads** (9): feeling sane again üòå

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): as someone who stays checking the locks, I feel seen

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): cute! it sounds like itd be the main theme of a kids show that only lasts 12 episodes and is next to impossible to find any information about online

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): the quitting anthem

**throwaway-7650** (9): anthem for the perpetually paranoid people aka me #Area51

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): so much fun and very classic magdalena bay, could def fit in on a mini mix or day/pop

**vayyiqra** (9): This is kind of "Dawning of the Season Pt. 2" but a bit weirder. That's my (probably bad) take.

**celladonn** (8.5): Another great chorus

**jasannn** (8.5): i keep hearing meloxicam during the chorus and i get flashbacks to work

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): :mercurialkirbydance:

**fairytalehigh** (8.3): i, too, have done nitrous

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh i love a ping pong sample

**imbaby122** (8): anxiety anthem methinks

**jman457** (7.8): Like the strings in this

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Like the spacey dance vibes of this

#the opposite of hysterical

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): it‚Äôs cute next to gorgeous i fear

**runaway3212** (3): every day I thank god I am not in this couple it sounds like hell

**wavingwolves** (0): i can't for the life of me point out what is it about this song that i dislike so much but god when the chorus hits it makes me want to turn it off IMMEDIATELY

The second single from the album and a song I listened to a lot of back during the initial wave of the pandemic. I love the drop so much, it invokes Porter's EDM roots while staying true to the lighter vibe of the album's sonics and as someone that will forever retain the EDMhead gene deep inside me it makes me so happy. Seeing this make the top 10 is really awesome, since I could see people being turned off by that aspect of the song, but it seems at least most people enjoyed it. Just two left for Porter now, though..

#This song is comforting

**bespectacIed** (11): One of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Not to be emo, but there's nothing else to say tbh, this is THE literal ultimate song. The one I wanna meet death with. This is what finality and acceptance sounds like.

**TiltControls** (11): it's this. this is the comforting

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): When the beginning arpeggios start playing it is OVER for hoes like me, we are DONE.

**apatel27** (10): God what a track

**Awkward\_King** (10): i like

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (10): so, we all agree that's the second best drop of the decade, right?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): That drop‚Ä¶ Expensive. Pristine. Tasteful. Elegant.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): sorry did you think we were done crying lets fix that AGAIN

**DefaultPophead** (10): I find this some comforting. Like a nice scoop of ice cream.

**frogaranaman** (10): the synth chorus tickles a good part of my brain

**Gonza\_90** (10): The first time I listened to this it blew my mind

**homestarguy** (10): Love the callback to ‚ÄúLifelike‚Äù as warm welcome into the track and then‚Ä¶..it just absolutely ascends.

**pig-serpent** (10): What an incredible piece of music.  A perfect drop and a perfect chorus.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the other tough 11 contender that I had to leave behind on this album, this song is truly so beautiful and haunting and relatable and magical, there are so many amazing details here, but my favourite is during the outro, when the pitch shift on porter's voice is coming in and out constantly, like the cracks appearing in this false reality of happiness he's built around himself, it's so beautiful and when i first noticed it I absolutely bawled my eyes out

**skargardin** (10): the song title really spilled

**starlitsuns** (10): this section of tracks from sweet time to the end of the fucking album is so fucking emotional in so many ways and this track is somehow both the dance break and another catalyst for emotion

**vayyiqra** (10): You know what's comforting? This whole damn album I love this album it is like a warm hug in musical form.

**warjhybrid** (10): This is the kind of track that you just dance around your room to. Unmatched melody in the drop

**you2009** (10): just a perfect song with the most sickening drop I've heard in my life lol

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): the beat drop kinda ruins this one for me, makes it sound like a generic EDM song, but I also kinda really like the song that I can almost ignore it

**thedoctordances1940** (9.3): this album to me

**fairytalehigh** (9): my favorite fleece, a cup of coffee, cuddling with a sleeping puppy, my bed, dame judi dench in the film cats

**reput4tionera** (9): more sad oontz oontz music slay

**rslashpoopheads** (9): :)

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): this is something comforting

**throwaway-7650** (9): [DROP] (he detonated the yass grenade @ 1:20)

**welcome2thejam** (9): Just wanna wrap this song around me like a blanket

**DirtyRat583** (8.5): love me a good bussy bopper

**imbaby122** (8.5): too relatable. hits too deep.

**jay?** (8.5): üíãüí£üòç

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): the drop in this song is everything

**bluetriangles04** (8): when I heard of this idk why I was just immediately reminded of monstercat and the imprint it left on me as a kid hooked on EDM music

**jman457** (8): this blends the acoustics and electronic beats really well

**modulum83** (8): and we're back on track! this is some weeb shit that makes you feel like the protagonist or whatever those youtube playlists call it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): :catjam:

**Stryxen** (7.7): kinda hungry i love this album but i feel like i have to finish it before i get out of bed to eat, and as i said i'm very hungry

**bbfan132** (7.5): this is definitely comforting

**runaway3212** (7): I never cared for this but it's beautiful

#uncomfy

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I want to like this more because it‚Äôs a great concept for a song but the execution lets it down a bit‚Ä¶ like the ending is cool but it takes way too long to reach that point.

**wavingwolves** (5.5): not feeling comforted rn

What an outro this is.... I think the back half of Mercurial World isn't as strong as its first half - it's not bad, just not as memorable - but The Beginning brings us right back where we left off with Chaeri in being absolutely stunning. They set out to end the album with a bang and they succeeded, with this non-single reaching a very respectable #8.

#Enjoyed the show

**Awkward\_King** (11): i was undecided on my 11 for a while, mostly going between this, hysterical us and musician, but ultimately this is the song i enjoy the most, from the artist i enjoy the most, and i know it means something to me, so i wont regret it.

**WillWorkForSugar** (11): if this song came back for a last chorus instead of faking, it would be the greatest song of all time

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): The beginning of my serotonin rush more like

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (10): this kinda sounds like a rave at the end of time and I'm here for it

**bbfan132** (10): i feel like this is a song to dance to at weddings

**bespectacIed** (10): My fave thing about this album is how remarkably unromantic and jaded it has been entirely. Not something i'd expect from a synth/dream pop album for sure. Then they hit me with the most colorful, hopeful, life-affirming pop banger at end. Magbay cynic turned into a soft stan after this one

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Bold move to put the clit of the album right at the end.

**frogaranaman** (10): the way this song loops into the beginning of "The End" seamlessly looping the album.. should get their ass ate for that

**Gonza\_90** (10): A perfect way to end the album

**homestarguy** (10): Hey wait a minute‚Ä¶‚Ä¶this song is at the end of the album?????

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorite tracks, I think it‚Äôs a perfect closer and it‚Äôs absolutely jubilant

**just\_thonking** (10): So jubilant :)

**modulum83** (10): üíÉüíÉüíÉ

**nicolas** (10): in a perfect world this would win this rate (and fuck porter)

**oscarbrierley1** (10): this song is so fun, the piano is great.

**qazz23** (10): just a perfect closer

**RandomHypnotica** (10): SO IF YOU'RE FEELING LOW, SIT BACK ENJOY THE SHOW, LIKE A KALEIDOSCOPE

**rslashpoopheads** (10): banger

**sarcasticsobs** (10): THAT‚Äôs how you close, baybeeee

**Stryxen** (10): "you've made this moment . eternal" i could listen to that one line on repeat for ever and never get tired of it but then that BRIDGE????? oh. my. god.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): omg haha they're so goofy putting the beginning at the end and the end at the beginning üòÇ‚úå

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Shout out to butterflies in amber! A perfect song to close an album with

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): one of the most euphoric songs I've ever heard

**throwaway-7650** (10): mica says "matt" more times (3) than "beginning" (only 1)

**Uberpigeon** (10): i cant wait to hear this live

**welcome2thejam** (10): Guys help Magdalena Bay trapped me in an endless musical loop

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): this one is very much ‚Äúif you‚Äôre depressed, just don‚Äôt <3‚Äù vibes but it bops so idc

**imbaby122** (9.5): seratonin in its purest form. i‚Äôm giggling and smiling and and kicking my little legs. chanting ‚Äúso if you feel low, sit back enjoy the show, like a kaleidoscope‚Äù is self care.

**seanderlust** (9.5): upbeat ending! i love the circular beginning-end

**BaconShoes** (9): yas take us to the disco or whatever

**bigbigbee** (9): That plinky little piano is a great choice

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This album kinda drags in the home stretch but thankfully they bring it back to close it out with a banger!

**jasannn** (9): this is nu-disco?

**pig-serpent** (9): I was hoping seeing them live would make this group click for me, and at the very least it made this song click for me.

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): this finale did not have to snap so hard

**DirtyRat583** (8.5): THIS IS SO FUN OMGGGGGGGGG

**starlitsuns** (8.5): i love this as a closer and also the throwbacks to the intro of the album are clever. the fact that this album is a loop similar to what is described in halfway is also fairly clever. matt sleeps, matt wakes up.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): its just such a vibe

**TiltControls** (8.5): the beginning of the best album is coming up next song!

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): it's honestly just a *bit* saccharine for me buuuut i can't make the music not bop so

**bluetriangles04** (8): This song has this super optimistic/jivey feel after the whole album and I feel it's the perfect way to close it out.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): you know what, I‚Äôve been really harsh on this album, but this is a really nice cheesy closer that I will absolutely eat up

**IIIHenryIII** (8): if the end is the beginning, the beginning is the end or whatever‚Ä¶ they spilled. I never thought about that (am I the only one in the sub?), and naming the first and final tracks as they did was clever

**jman457** (8): Its not my favorite on here, but its still really good

**reput4tionera** (8): this is such a fun closing track

**runaway3212** (8): Dreamcatcher heard "save the best for last" and then they didn't but this song still slays

**vayyiqra** (8): Okay it's a neat gimmick, but am I the only one who doesn't get -why- the album is a closed circle or loop or ouroboros or whatever you want to call it? Anyway good album.

#Will not be looping the album

**apatel27** (7): I want to like it but why does it sound so 2014 indiecore

**wavingwolves** (5): what do you MEAN??? isn't the album is ending????? wait... omfg... it's switched..... woah

**jay?** (2): ... doesnt deserve an emoji

The biggest fan fave from KKB is out here, pretty apt at #7 for a 7 minute long song... This is a sprawling epic whose lyrical sentiment really resonates with a lot of people, and is truly a jewel on the KKB crown. Unfortunately the love isn't entirely universal, but it still has a really great average - the 6 songs above it are just too powerful. Will KKB be able to pull through with The Princess and the Clock?

#THEY WILL BE! WELL! RESTED!

**2dina3dworld** (11): Kero Kero Bonito‚Äôs Well Rested is a house song with pop trappings that calls to mind influences such as Depeche Mode, and Bjork. It‚Äôs bright, peppy, and bubbly, reflecting the more innocent and positive outlook that defines ‚ÄúCivilisation II‚Äù, despite the dreary subject matter that the album itself deals with. Well Rested itself is about the beauty inherent in humanity, framed as a rebuttal to the ideas and beliefs of doomsayers. It is a call to unity, one that would appear disingenuous or toxically positive if it was coming from anyone else but Sarah Bonito‚Äôs lips. The innocence, kindness, and whimsicality present in Kero Kero Bonito‚Äôs music mean that the kindness and call to arms in Well Rested come off as sincere rather than hollow or as a desperate attempt to curry favour. Sarah‚Äôs preaching, that may call to mind David Byrne‚Äôs preaching sermon in ‚ÄúOnce in a Lifetime‚Äù, stresses the importance of caring for the environment and looking after the planet we call home. The lesson in itself is simple - we need to use the love inside of ourselves to care for our environment. It is framed using the mythical figure ‚ÄúGaia‚Äù, who was the mother of the Titans, and the personification of the Earth itself. The idea is that if we show love to Gaia like she showed to her own children, and show that love to yourself, that when we return to Gaia‚Äôs bosom then we shall die happy and fulfilled. At its core, Well Rested is future-focused. It believes that things can get better, as long as we learn to love. Pitchfork said of the track, that the character Sarah was portraying is ‚Äúperhaps not convinced of her own words‚Äù. I would argue that it seems more like she's desperately trying to convince herself of her own words - that you can see the issues present in the world, and see the individuals trying to make a difference, and lift them up. It‚Äôs a highly optimistic message, but if anyone is to deliver it - then let it be from a band like Kero Kero Bonito, who have proven time and time again in previous albums, such as 2016‚Äôs Bonito Generation, that they can see the beauty in even the most mundane of things. Sarah Bonito, I love you.

**bbfan132** (11): what an outro, wow

**cremeebrulee** (11): others have said this better than i will, but in the midst of every other song penned about the state of the world, it‚Äôs refreshing to hear one that actually believes in the perseverance & goodwill of humanity (or even evoke half the sincerity that sarah does). this song feels uplifting & exciting for its entire runtime and over a year later, i‚Äôm still as obsessed as i was on my first listen. it‚Äôs one of my top 10 most played songs ever so it being added to the rate made my 11 choice very easy <3

**plastichaxan** (11): me singing we will be well rested on 2 hours of sleep at 4am giving this an 11:

**RandomHypnotica** (11): When I first learned KKB would be releasing a 7 minute long song I was VERY skeptical. I love them, and their recent output had all been great, but did they really have it in them to write something that would justify that runtime? And WOW did they make sure to nullify all my worries, because this track is easily one of the best they've ever written

**skargardin** (11): this is so monumental in the best possible ways!!

**throwaway-7650** (11): how not to drown my meow meow, I tried my best, I really did

**Uberpigeon** (11): popping my pussy to a 7 minute long environmentally conscious club post-prog apocalyptic sci-fi house track i know thats right!

**akanewasright** (10): Bowing my head in prayer to our goddess Sarah Bonito

**apatel27** (10): This is one of the best and most thematically sound songs KKB has ever put out. It has everything that makes KKB themselves in a 7 minute masterpiece.

**Awkward\_King** (10): WE WILL BE! WELL! RESTED! WHEN THE EXTENSION COMES! (thanks for letting me submit this late hikkstie)

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (10): not only is this a banger, but it's also an epic reminder that we can and will get through whatever life throws at us, a call to protect the earth, and a cool cult leader speech all in one. like i said in indieheads ult, I am here for kkb's cult leader era

**BaconShoes** (10): this song is insane. it‚Äôs so good. It‚Äôs a whole journey

**bespectacIed** (10): this is GRAND. Maximalist. Both in concept and in production. Deep existentialism is the vibe

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I want to join the KKB cult please God take me there.

**fairytalehigh** (10): the feelings of hope this song gives me y'all, priceless. i needed this, we needed this

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): if any of you fuckers give this song a 7 for the meme‚Ä¶ snipers on speed dial

**Gonza\_90** (10): I wan't to join this cult so bad

**homestarguy** (10): TAKE ME AWAY GAIA

**imbaby122** (10): this song is a gift. 7 minutes of ascension and pure bliss. combating eco facism and climate change denial while taking a hopeful outlook on the future of humanity. i also really love sarah‚Äôs speaking voice lol

**Mudkip1** (10): so GOOD

**nicolas** (10): me when i had a good night‚Äôs sleep before sufjan stevens‚Äô 2020 album ‚ÄúThe Ascension‚Äù was released

**notchickeninspanish** (10): Impossible Soul Jr. and the rightful winner of this rate.

**nt96** (10): Gaia will be main pop girl only when she requires it. Consider your faves lucky

**reput4tionera** (10): when kero kero bonito decided to make a 7 minute song they had me in mind. they were thinking hmm i think reddit user reput4tionera would love this

**runaway3212** (10): this expensive ass drop

**seanderlust** (10): i am ready to join your cult sarah bonito how do i sign up

**Stryxen** (10): perfect closer, summarises the entire album concept, lovely message of hope and such unique production!! The water running at the end is my TEARS of joy and relief!!

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Cult vibes but in a good way

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): don‚Äôt listen to this song when you‚Äôre holding in your pee

**TiltControls** (10): people being well rested? in this sub??

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): this is the sort of song that makes me absolutely sure i could never be a musician. this is truly next level stuff! the roll credits moment at the end was a collapse

**vayyiqra** (10): Thank god someone wrote an anti-doomer anthem. We needed it. Look, I get it. The future is uncertain and it feels like everything is irrevocably fucked, and it's scary. I worry about that stuff too. But in the end it doesn't get us anywhere and just makes us feel worse. Instead we should be thinking about what we can do that's practical and will help us. KKB both put this point into a song and made it a really good song too. It's cathartic and it's also right. The world is kind of fucked up right now. Climate change can't be realistically stopped and will have a lot of bad effects, and it's hard not to worry about it (or feel guilty that we will spared the worst of it in developed countries). But humans are the most adaptable species and we are not all going to die. I mean, we are someday. But not soon.

**warjhybrid** (10): An absolute musical journey. Love the anti-doomsayer lyrics.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Kero Kero Bonito puts out this ambitious, theme-heavy, incredibly special track, and all I have to say is that I think the wobbly little synth at 0:42 is neat

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): the ascension has come. it is this song

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Even I can admit this one‚Äôs kind of a banger, despite the fact that it‚Äôs 7 minutes long

**CrimsonROSET** (9): idk my sleep schedule is shit

**jay?** (9): hm

**jman457** (9): This banged a lot, felt like being in a crowded club

hikkaru: 
**qazz23** (9): nice dancey track

**you2009** (8.8): really hate the pissing in the river outro that goes on for a bit too long but I live for the rest

**modulum83** (8.7): solid but kinda overrated. that said it's really fucking cool to hear an environmentalist song that's genuinely optimistic about humanity's future

**just\_thonking** (8.5): well now I have to pee

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): the length is such a serve. It's such a late night club banger.

**frogaranaman** (8): the way this song is 20% of the length of this entire album

**Leixander** (8): not a huge fan of the outro, a banger nevertheless

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): im twerking

#tired

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): okay I wrote out initially how the vocal and production mix was bugging me so much cause the vocals were so much more quiet but on second listen, it‚Äôs not that bad. Definitely an EP highlight. Still hate the water running at the end.

**indie\_fan\_** (7.5): Enjoyable, but runs a bit too long

**wavingwolves** (7.5): i've never been well rested in my life so this song is offensive to me and my people (exhausted nation)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.9): there are parts of this that are 10 worthy but theres also parts of this that are like. a 5. so i cant in full conscious give this a high score when i only enjoy certain parts of it

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): great lyrical content, not that good musical content though

**pig-serpent** (6.5): More of the dreamy, video game vibe this ep has going for it.  I think there's a lot to like here, but most of it just isn't connecting with me.  I'm going to throw in an extra .5 for the awesome synthline that occurs around the 3 minute mark.

**bluetriangles04** (6): the end makes me want to pee LMFAO

**SmileAndTears** (6): gneh

**fadedblue09** (5): Tries to pull too many ideas

**ricki** (5): i hope longsongphobia hits this one HARD so the people hyping this up suffer

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this song could‚Äôve ended like 4 different times

This was a really interesting direction for magbay to go with the lead single for Mercurial World, and though it took a moment for it to fully hit when it hit it HIT for me. I love the more fully electronic vibe it goes for, and #6 is a really great placement for it. We're now at the top 5, and magbay now are equal with Porter for amount of songs remaining...

---

#pleek... pleek...

**akanewasright** (11): I just love this song. The beat, the pleading, the build, and the last minute of catharsis‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just brilliant. And while the last lyrics often get lost for me, ‚Äúbetter crucified than alone‚Äù is probably my favorite line on the album

**ignitethephoenix** (11): perfection

**jman457** (11): This belongs with Dancing on My own for sad songs that slap

**oscarbrierley1** (11): the bassline and beat combo creates an impeccable vibe

**pheromenos** (11): i don't know how this isn't universally the most immaculate moment of the album

**qazz23** (11): favorite off the album, love the distorted bit towards the end

**ricki** (11): me singing about the 8th member of kpop girl group LOONA <3

**SFbby** (11): The bridge breakdown is an ascension straight to heaven

**starla\_** (11): total euphoriaaaaaa

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): CHERRRRRRY PLEASE! YOU‚ÄôRE KILLLLLLLLLING ME!

**Awkward\_King** (10): wanna make out w a dirty guy with a scratchy beard whos name ill forget by 3am tonight but me and my friend will call james bc it makes telling stories easier to this song about being a bad friend to the people you hold dearest to you

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (10): so, we all agree that's the best drop of the decade, right?

**BaconShoes** (10): an absolute collapse. Takes me away

**bbfan132** (10): 2:55‚Ä¶.. yes

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This and Musician had a fight to the death for my 11 and I‚Äôm still not completely sure. This rate is too much. There‚Äôs too many high quality bleeps and bloops even for me.

**bluetriangles04** (10): MAYBE THE BEST BRIDGE/OUTRO IN THIS RATE

**cremeebrulee** (10): the music video for this makes me wish they went a more sci-fi/cult-inspired route for the rest of the visuals tbh! i'm hoping for their next project they explore this sort of darker sound and lyricism more, i would eat up an album full of like 12 chaeris

**homestarguy** (10): That slinky synth bass line does‚Ä¶things to me. THREE FOUR DOWN TO THE FLOOR!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the dark synth is the perfect juxtaposition to her vocals, this is flawless

**imbaby122** (10): if my severe mental illness was as slayyy and yasss as this song sounds maybe then i‚Äôd get out of bed

**jay?** (10): üíãüí£üòç

**just\_thonking** (10): God that drop

**modulum83** (10): this destroys me

**nicolas** (10): this song makes me wanna commit arson

**plastichaxan** (10): i would like two 11s please

**reput4tionera** (10): oontz oontz music but make it insensitive to your depressed friend

**runaway3212** (10): im gonna be honest I have no idea what this song is about but it sounds cool and vagely inspirational? idk I don't speak english

**seanderlust** (10): that build into the end is earcandy

**starlitsuns** (10): i have so many things i could say about this song but i have listened to this multiple times and watched my favourite football club then score a goal. thank you Magdalena Bay, please make your next album be about coincidences

**static\_int\_husp** (10): seeing this live really elevated the song for me because I never realized what the outro lyrics were ("Better crucified than unknown") and they're so good

**Stryxen** (10): chaeri... pleek‚Ä¶

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): who is Chaeri again?

**throwaway-7650** (10): :cherry: :cherryjpg: :crunchycherry: :crunchycherryfast: :chaeripls:

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): i want so badly to give this (the best song on the album) an 11 but i can't... chaeri pls üòî the way this song builds is mesmerizing and so so soooo good

**vayyiqra** (10): Giving this a 10 because of knowing what it's like to be so depressed it's hard to get out of bed. Also it's really good.

**warjhybrid** (10): Deep house like, incredibly warm and comfy vibes

**thedoctordances1940** (9.8): this is so :kirbyfaint: vibes

**Gonza\_90** (9.5): Cherry please

**fairytalehigh** (9): the second that beat starts, the serotonin SURGES

**frogaranaman** (9): wildly good song. makes me think about being insufferable on the internet

**ImADudeDuh** (9): i always think this is overrated until i get to the second chorus

**pig-serpent** (9): A normal, lowkey Mag Bay song until it decides to go ham.  It's the best on this album in terms of growth and development, as it feels like it has a clear sense of direction that most other songs on this album lack.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): animal crossing legends

**sarcasticsobs** (9): some real cool sounds kick in during the final chorus, especially if you play real close attention (i am not articulate enough to describe them)

**celladonn** (8.5): Love the pulsing beat

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Went onto Genius.com and learned that this song is about mental health while an ad of toilet paper curing the Charmin bear‚Äôs depression played in the corner, love the modern era.

**Leixander** (8.5): the instrumental here is just MWAH

**wavingwolves** (8.1): ok now who is chaeri and where can i get one so it can kill me too

**bespectacIed** (8): gonna pretend they're singing about loona choerry

**nt96** (8): nightdrive vibes

**welcome2thejam** (8): I love "bad friend" anthems. Wonder if that says anything about me...

#You're killing me

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): this is probably my least favourite of the singles, and it's certainly not a bad song, but it just doesn't hit the same as the others for me, and would probably be the only Magbay winner I wouldn't be satisfied with

**WillWorkForSugar** (8): i can never decide how i feel about this song

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): britney spears you‚Äôll always be famous

**jasannn** (7.5): good production but the payoff isnt worth the length

**TiltControls** (7.5): chaeri plz

**apatel27** (7): It has potential but not a fan of a drop build-up with no drop. It makes sense conceptually but as a song it's eh

**SmileAndTears** (6): ch6eri

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.7): i liked the ending when it got really loud and uhhh‚Ä¶not much else

**LesApfels** (5.5): Her vocal delivery never rises to the production's energy level

**2dina3dworld** (3): I originally had this a bit higher but I couldn‚Äôt justify the higher score in my head. The vocals are really giving ‚Äúgo girl, give us nothing‚Äù energy, the song itself is just as flat as Micah‚Äôs vocals, and it really goes nowhere. +1 for probably being a wlw anthem though.

This a fine song and that's it for me. I'll enjoy it if it comes on but there's so much better on the album! Personally I don't really get people calling this the clear SMASH of the album when Chaeri and You Lose! are right there... before this rate started I was definitely a little worried that this would win and I'd not be happy because there's other contenders I would prefer from all artists involved, including magbay, and thankfully my prayers were answered when this settled in at #5. Clearly there was enough people that feel similarly about it to me. With that, magbay is down to just one more song... will They Lose!? lettuce see..........

---

#THIS SHIT'S FIRE!

**BaconShoes** (11): SMASH HIT, PLANETS SHIFTED ETC.

**Gonza\_90** (11): Fantastic from start to finish

**ImADudeDuh** (11): this song will never fail to get me to dance just from the opening alone.

**imbaby122** (11): god was in the studio. god spoke directly to magdalena bay and was like. here‚Äôs the grooviest funkiest most danceable bass line ever. mica say unh right there. cut out the instrumentation here and then throw it back in. let‚Äôs make an outro and i‚Äôll just inject some divine heavenly essence into it. everything about this track is right there‚Äôs no other way to put it

**Mudkip1** (11): big bop. the way it transitions from dawning of the season??!? UNGH

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): That fucking orchestral hit I swear to God!!!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): the way the world shook when this released like

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (10): first of all: that is an amazing transition. second of all: more fucking amazing production, the string swells and synth hits and- HOLY SHIT I NEVER NOTICED THE SAXOPHONE IN THE BACKGROUND, THAT'S SO FUCKING COOL. uh, anyways, third: again, super fun! just a very good dance tune and I love the "now the place is on FIRE!" after the chorus

**bbfan132** (10): i remember hearing this on the radio and i got so excited lol‚Ä¶ thank you for the promo sirius xmu

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I mean Matthew summed it up. This shit‚Äôs fire.

**celladonn** (10): An 11 contender, it's actually insane how good this is

**cremeebrulee** (10): ‚Äúyou‚Äôre sick if you think this is the best song on the album‚Äù ah choo

**CrimsonROSET** (10): it‚Äôs insane how they captured lightning in a bottle in this song and the entire rest of the album can‚Äôt do it again, this combines the technology angle all their stuff takes (both new with the subject matter and old with the sounds they choose to put in their songs) while just effortlessly sounding cool

**exciting\_patient4872** (10): I would love for this song to win if my 11 doesn't!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I wasn‚Äôt obsessed with this when it came out but revisiting the album for the rate it really pops, the prechorus is one of my favorite parts of the whole project.

**homestarguy** (10): Just when you think this song couldn‚Äôt be more sonically perfect, Matt hits us with the Orchestra Hit?!?!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorite songs from last year. Just perfect vibes

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this song is already on another level, then the saxophone comes in and I‚Ä¶

**just\_thonking** (10): extra half point for that transition

**nicolas** (10): playing this as my house burns down

**notchickeninspanish** (10): The synth at the beginning is one of the best '90s throwback exercises I've ever heard.

**qazz23** (10): really good bassline and perfect transition from the previous track

**RandomHypnotica** (10): THIS TIME AROUND CAN PEOPLE PUT THEIR FUCKING SECRETS IN THE COMMENTS I AM BEGGING YOU'VE HAD 3 CHANCES IN THE LAST 8 MONTHS

**reput4tionera** (10): im pretty sure this was the first song they played when they opened for charli xcx and jesus christ the crowd was so dead they did not give a FUCK

**seanderlust** (10): this early 2000s instrumental over a new jack swing beat is like catnip for me. this is maybe my favorite track on the record

**skargardin** (10): This feels like straight out of a videogame OST. I also feel like this is the song on the album that clearly captures the loose internet age concept the best, even in its relative vagueness.

**starla\_** (10): absolutely addictive

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is truly one of the best songs in this rate. It's just so smooth and funky my god. And the ad-libs and breakdown of the post-chorus? Camp, but it works. Every time I head this song I just want to get up and dance like a maniac, it's so good.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): online anytime, getting lost again, worldwide a paradigm, do another rate

**Uberpigeon** (10): NOW THE PLACE IS ON FIRE!!!!

**vayyiqra** (10): This is a song I will bust out the ten-dollar words for and say it's immaculate. It's smooth as hell. How is it this smooth? How is it this catchy? Science cannot yet explain.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Heard this as a transition in a rate reveal and instantly fell in love. Just jampacked with fun hooks and interesting production choices and DRAGON FIRE!

**WillWorkForSugar** (10): greatest music video of all time

**jasannn** (9.5): although it would be a boring winner, it‚Äôs still a great song that has an incredible transition to an even better song

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.5): so freaking groovy and sexy... mag bay more like mag bae

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): the intro is giving Spice Girls - Say You‚Äôll Be There

**DirtyRat583** (9.2): every part of the song is placed in the perfect place

**fairytalehigh** (9.2): omg is this disco

**modulum83** (9.1): i too am online anytime

**bespectacIed** (9): hot

**bluetriangles04** (9): One of the best instrumentals in the album I believe? There are so many details layered on and added throughout the song that makes it continuously change form. Like the chorus lyrics contradicting each other and the song being a bit of a paradox.

**fadedblue09** (9): Oh I definitely see the appeal, the instrumental is very memorable and just a solid bop overall

**jman457** (9): This is H&m core in a good way

**pig-serpent** (9): While I normally prefer faster disco songs, this is probably the most a sultry disco song has worked for me, with a great vocal performance, a sexy bassline, and production that gets more and more interesting throughout the song.

**jay?** (8.5): üíãüí£

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): the power this song holds

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): really enjoy the ending cacophony

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): it is very good but also probably my least favourite of the singles i think. It did grow on me but now i think it's grown off me a bit again

**apatel27** (8): The second half of this track tho

**frogaranaman** (8): is the secret arson

**ricki** (8): https://tenor.com/view/scarlett-johansson-dance-huang4evr-gif-23516847

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): omg i love hypnospace outlaw üòç

#Keep it a secret

**throwaway-7650** (8): Secrets (You're Fired *from the top 5... hopefully I beg)

**SmileAndTears** (7): I never really "got" a lot of the singles from this album (apart from you lose). To this day i still don't know what to make of this song

**Stryxen** (7): if matt and mica guest judged drag race everyone would expect this to be the lipsync song but they would probably do killshot slowed + reverbed and have a shot of them politely grimacing at the choice

**LesApfels** (6.5): Everything is great except for the chorus

**plastichaxan** (6.5): this is not as good as i remember ouu

**runaway3212** (6): the secret is that this song isn't that good

**TiltControls** (6): just douse em with a fire extinguisher

**wavingwolves** (5.1): go_girl_give_us_nothing.jpg

**MassiveThief** (5): always felt somewhat overrated to me, just too slow of a pace

My own personal 11 in this rate and definitely one of my favourite songs from last year. Seeing it stay in the top 5 of the rate for the entirety of the rating period was truly great, it made me really happy as I have such a strong connection to this song. At a few points it snuck into the #1 spot but eventually ended up finding its way to #4 in the end, which I can't complain about at all. It would have been cool for it to pass a 9.0 average but oh well. With this elimination Porter is the final artist to be down to just one more song, joining KKB and Magbay both. Can he pull through with the win?

---

#Something good

**apatel27** (11): Euphoric chorus

**celladonn** (11): Ugh this is just gorgeous, musically and lyrically

**fairytalehigh** (11): the relief that crashed over me when i saw porter in 2021 and this song played and i hugged my brother and sobbed. the past 2-3 years have been a lot, y'all. tell your people you love them.

**seanderlust** (11): this was one of my favorite songs of 2021 because it brings me such a sense of peace

**static\_int\_husp** (11): The day is May 1st, 2021. I am sitting in a park, eating lunch before my second covid vaccine appointment. I turn this album on. This was the perfect setting to hear this album in, and full of hope, especially this song. I will be alive next year, and I can make my life into something good. Because the other thing I was doing that day, was finally becoming confident in the fact I am transgender. IDK exactly what did it, maybe Porter's pitched up vocals (which I'm still super envious of) set something off in me. This gave me a lot of hope for the future, which has so far been not that bad :-)

**thedoctordances1940** (11): genuinely just a perfect song

**vayyiqra** (11): I like to post random stuff to my friend and as a joke write "my daily affirmation", but this is my unironic daily affirmation. This is the perfect uplifting song I need when I'm depressed and want to hear something wholesome. Being able to sit outside in the nice weather lately and listen to this just HITS and I want to thank Porter in person for making this beautiful song. I wrote elsewhere that this song evokes what it feels like "to cry happy tears". And it does makes me do that, every time.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Why‚Äôd Adam McKay even bother to pay Ariana when he could‚Äôve just asked Porter to license this fucken masterpiece for Don‚Äôt Look Up (2021)? Smh.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this winning would be so pussy cunt pussy

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (10): god the chorus on this... it's just a really comforting affirmation. "look at the sky, I'm still here / I'll be alive next year" hits me right in the heart

**bespectacIed** (10): this song is sooo suffocatingly positive, it's a nightmare to listen to at specific headspaces and points in your life (1)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Do I know for sure that I‚Äôll be alive next year? No. But man it feels good to say out loud.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): he should not have been allowed to release this during the pandemic i swear this man is evil

**DefaultPophead** (10): I just honestly can't feel bad when I listen to this song. I feel like I'm playing Dogz on the PS2.

**frogaranaman** (10): came out truly at the perfect time. mental health was in SHAMBLES thanks to the pandemic and this song helped pick me right up to a better place. yea, it's Chainsmokers-esque, but I don't care it makes my heart nut

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Maybe if I stream this enough I can claim some of this energy for myself.

**homestarguy** (10): That piano hook‚Ä¶the self-affirming vocals‚Ä¶getting to belt it live with thousands of people at Red Rocks‚Ä¶:)

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this song is just pure joy

**jay?** (10): .....WTFFF YASSSSSS YAS YAS üíãüí£üòç

**just\_thonking** (10): this song sounds like what springtime feels like

**MassiveThief** (10): So painful to not give this my 11. The blast of happiness this song gives is unmatched.

**reput4tionera** (10): the bond between me and sad oontz oontz music

**runaway3212** (10): perfection

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): My runner-up 11. I feel like How Not to Drown is the song I listen to confront depressed thoughts at night, and this is the song that gives me a boost of pure joy in the morning. "I‚Äôll be alive next year, I can make something good" is the simple yet effective mantra I needed

**skargardin** (10): If the goal was to make people want to look at the sky with this song then god damn was he successful

**starlitsuns** (10): i'd feel bad if i committed the crime of not 10ing this. this song made me a much happier person as it did for so many others, finally having ourselves' lives realised as Porter told the story of finding himself again üåº

**Stryxen** (10): the first time i heard this... i knew i would cry but omg i crode

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): it's blue today!

**throwaway-7650** (10): LOOK UP IN THE SKY IT'S A BIRD IT'S A PLANE [YG outro]

**TiltControls** (10): What a great opener. Really sets the sad, but optimistic tone for the album

**welcome2thejam** (10): For me, this song is always gonna be linked to its release period. Just got my second dose, the vaccines were becoming more and more available, and it really felt like we were gonna come out of the other side: battered and in a lot of ways broken beyond repair but still through it all. Reality didn't match this imagination, of course, but listening to it still manages to give me that same sense of hope, even if its only for five minutes

**you2009** (10): placing this song at the start of the album was the perfect choice. being chronically depressed for like half my life and having a period of time where I was a bit averse to recovery cos I'd been convinced my illness was inherent to who I was, as I grew older it became important for me to engage with themes like this. you know? I don't care if it's corny but it really helped me to know as long as I'm alive I'll always have a chance at a better life for myself, even if I have to wait for it. so pressing play on this album for the first time and hearing these lyrics was very special for me. and lyrics are very much secondary for me! this is a beautifully made song regardless, very perfect electronic music. it's the combination that really takes it there for me

**Gonza\_90** (9.5): This is so beautiful

**shhhneak** (9.5): The random bike bells ruined an otherwise perfect song.

**fadedblue09** (9): This song is pleasant sounding, it makes me feel like I'm in the grassy area in the cover

**rslashpoopheads** (9): imagine my shock at discovering that his voice voice in Musician was pitched up the whole time

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): god im so mentally ill

**BaconShoes** (8.5): catchy bop

**imbaby122** (8.5): perfect addition to my ‚Äúeverything will be okay methinks‚Äù playlist <3

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I love the lyrics on here and how hopeful they are, it‚Äôs just a tad generic sounding to me

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): this is the one fan fav of the album that just never really clicked with me, I appreciate the lyricism and optimism on it, but it just doesn‚Äôt resonate with me the same way much of the rest of the album does

**wavingwolves** (7.7): capricornian (feels nostalgic)

**jman457** (7.6): Nice tune but feels like it plays into edm cliches too much for a super high score

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.5): Throw a pop girl on this and it could be a 2010s edm hit

**bbfan132** (7): this is pretty but it‚Äôs not *fully* clicking for me

**plastichaxan** (7): you got me there grass man i like looking at the sky

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): it's really cute, but just a bit forgettable. feels very owl-city-song-made-for-a-kid's-movie to me

**modulum83** (4.5): there's something really cloying, saccharine, and obvious about the lyrics of this track and the vocals really don't help it this time. i feel like this song is about to sit me down and go "LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR FEELINGS!" i love motivational songs as much as the next person but this is the motivational song for an MLP character

**Leixander** (4): hate the way the production sounds here, feels very generic festival edm etc. at points

**notchickeninspanish** (4): I thought we killed Owl City after Fireflies came out.

This is definitely my fave song on Civilisation and maybe from KKB overall, everything is immaculate from the production to the melodies to the storytelling, MWAH! I'm super happy we got to rate it here and that it did so well! Before the rate started I thought this had a pretty strong chance of winning - but top 3 with a 9.0 average isn't bad at all! Unforuntately for kkbheads it just barely comes short, but we'll definitely be seeing this again in All Stars so be sure to support it there, and also support Time n Place in the upcoming 2018 Indie Pop rate!

#ooohwahohhh

**homestarguy** (11): I‚Äôve run out of words how to describe how perfect this song is. I guess I would say it is the freaking cutest banger of a song ever made. The pretty bleep bloops lure you in for a synth-filled lullaby, only for this song to go amazingly hard for no reason other than KKB loves us. Giving this the 11 only because of how many times I‚Äôve replayed it and not gotten tired of it.

**Stryxen** (11): why this song has the ability to make me bawl my eyes out and twerk at the same time. idk. it‚Äôs just perfect, i think it‚Äôs about me tbh. magnum opus of a flawless discography.

**apatel27** (10): KKB reaches new peaks with every new release

**Awkward\_King** (10): god this song is so effortlessly incredible, like it just sounds like they struck gold and made the best song ever and it seems so easy

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (10): it hurt to not give this song an 11. there's something really mystical and beautiful about this song, it's like a long lost fairytale. also, it's a fucking banger! you've got the chopped up vocals at the beginning, the propulsive synths in the chorus, the motherfucking SYNTH SOLO? this song has everything. y'all suck for making me choose between this and you lose this was genuinely painful

**bespectacIed** (10): flawless in every way, yass storytelling

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Just gonna copy/paste my comment for Something Comforting - ‚ÄúThat drop‚Ä¶ Expensive. Pristine. Tasteful. Elegant.‚Äù

**bluetriangles04** (10): TECHNO BRAINROT

**cremeebrulee** (10): i will say i like this song until it starts doing better than well rested

**Gonza\_90** (10): This song is made with some sort of drug I swear

**jasannn** (10): it might just be because of the single artwork but its incredible how they made a song sound medieval and futuristic at the same time. This production never fails to get me hyped with every drop.

**Leixander** (10): OOOOOOO OH- HIGH UP IN THE CHAMBER-

**modulum83** (10): ooo whoa oh i look just like buddy holly

**Mudkip1** (10): so good

**nicolas** (10): owo

**notchickeninspanish** (10): THEY LITERALLY MADE SYNTH RIBBITS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS SONG I'M CRYING.

**plastichaxan** (10): this was a whole movie omfg

**qazz23** (10): neat synths and very dancey

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I ADORE when tracks tell a very literal narrative, and the fable like nature of this song works absolutely perfectly for the project, and on top of it all it's just a fucking BANGER

**reput4tionera** (10): i remember the day this song came out‚Ä¶ i lost my goddamn mind

**ricki** (10): everytime i listen to this i can only think of the person that described this as ‚Äúexpensive ass drop‚Äù

**runaway3212** (10): somebody tasteless told me not to 11 this so here I am

**seanderlust** (10): even if this isn't the allegory that genius thinks it is, this still a fun fantasy story

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Its whimsical and fun!

**throwaway-7650** (10): I don't recall this being a part of tiana's... lore?

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): the progression on this one is so good! i was not expecting such a huge chorus in those opening moments

**Uberpigeon** (10): this is like a porter song if it was good

**vayyiqra** (10): This song is weird because it's one of those songs that I love every time I hear it but when it's not playing I can't remember how it goes. Still great though. I have to admit I don't really get how it ties into the apocalyptic concept, but whatever.

**BaconShoes** (9.5): a smash. More of a catchy melody than the civ 1 songs

**celladonn** (9.5): I wish all fairytales slapped this hard

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): one of the best songs KKB has ever made, a beautiful allegory with a beat that just goes and goes. love that weird ribbiting synth that keeps popping up

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): so bouncy and fun

**starlitsuns** (9.5): really dancey and bouncy. I like this one. it is very pretty

**wavingwolves** (9.1): i ship princlock (princess and clock) <3

**bbfan132** (9): this totally bops

**CrimsonROSET** (9): pokemon type beat

**imbaby122** (9): the princess and the cock ha

**pig-serpent** (9): Squelching bassline, awesome drop... This is one one song on this ep that I feel encapsulates the vibe they're aiming for but also works as a conventional pop song.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): forever stuck in my head as PotC (Panic at the Cisco)

**TiltControls** (9): It's got a fantastical feeling to it that I really love!

**welcome2thejam** (9): Lovely tale, that soft outro wipes me out

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.8): the drops did something to me

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): it just goes ooo wah ooo and i'm suddenly blown away

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): Hated this one at first, but wow it's a grower!

**DirtyRat583** (8.4): this production is sexy

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Not as annoyed with Sarah‚Äôs vocals as I thought, mainly cos the melody suits her singing well + the instrumental bangs

**fadedblue09** (7.5): A rare case where the verses mostly save the song. Love the storytelling though

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I feel like this should be a Zelda theme

#I hate children

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): who's gonna be the princess to my clock

**jman457** (6.3): this just reminds me too much of a video game to like it too much

**frogaranaman** (6): Sarah Bonito is my favorite Disney princess

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Theoretically I should be all over this because I love fantasy and fairy tale themes in music and the sonic palate is nice but Sarah‚Äôs voice just doesn‚Äôt do it for me here. Her usual schtick isn‚Äôt working, I wish she‚Äôd gone for a more expressive approach.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): sounds like the title of a children's book

**Overall Average**: 7.953 **// Average Controversy:** 1.702

The last-minute addition to the rate, and I still stand by that being a very good choice. They provided some exciting competition and notched a song in the top 3 with a 9.0+ average, whereas if they were not here it would have just been a two-horse race after CHVRCHES flopped. I was never super into KKB but got into them a lot more with Civ II's release and have since gone back and enjoyed their various other projects. As a whole, this compilation is super consistent and a terrific display of what the group is capable of. Thanks for voting this into the rate overwhelmingly!

**RandomHypnotica** (10.086): KKB really knocked it out of the park with this one, I didn't expect to end up with an over 10 average initially, but I truly love all of these tracks so much, and they're all 11 contenders to me, so I'd be lying if I gave them anything less. They've really gotten a handle on what they want to do with their sound, and I'm SO excited for what comes next.

**notchickeninspanish** (10.000): This was my intro to KKB and what a powerhouse of an album. Definition of no skips for me. They've gained a new fan, and I want to fund whatever kickstarter video game I feel like they're going to inevitably sountrack.

**plastichaxan** (9.714): I have no words to explain the journey I go on with Kero Kero Bonito‚Äôs music and I think this was the easiest one to get transported into, it has a very visual element through the sound if that makes sense, and I love that they embraced this whole Civilisation concept and made some of their best work to date.

**2dina3dworld** (9.643): not my favourite album of the past year, but a great example of a concept album. Strong voice, strong point of view, and it‚Äôs by Kero Kero Bonito whose music is always quirky, interesting and full of kindness and belief in the goodness of the people. As an album, overall it‚Äôs a 10. But some songs don‚Äôt stand as well on their own.

**Stryxen** (9.571): every kkb project somehow exceeds the last, and they‚Äôve been at 10/10s since 2016, i don‚Äôt know how they keep doing it.

**vayyiqra** (9.429): I'm so glad we got to rate KKB and that it's one of their best projects. KKB being political was not something I expected to happen, but I'm glad it did because this EP is very good and also by far the best at making a statement about Society, which 3/4 of these albums try to do (Nurture doesn't really). One of their best projects and that's saying a lot. I always knew they had a lot more lyrical depth than they seemed, even in their early days when they were making kind of silly lighthearted music. They are a great band.

**apatel27** (9.357): They just keep getting better and better. People might not like their more recent stuff but the journey and story has been amazing

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (9.143): this is a wild turn. previous kkb projects had this sense of childlike wonder and optimism, but this project completely does away with that. it's considerably less bright and is quite cynical and pessimistic at times, which for kkb is shocking. but this feels super natural? like the project feels like kkb has grown up and is being exposed to the awful parts of the world and is trying to deal with them. it's also extremely majestic and otherworldly.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.071): among my favorite things are concept albums, fantasy settings, and electronic music, so this one was sure to be a hit with me. and a hit it was!! i'm not super familiar with KKB but i definitely need to get into them, because this is excellence. the writing is really strong and the production value is amazing, each song is atmospheric but still very accessible and dance-y. these songs sound like they're meant for the silver screen!

**cremeebrulee** (9.029): once i told my sister to listen to this ep and she was like "oh what was it called again" and i said "civilization but with an s" and then i watched as she typed "sivilization" into the spotify search

**nt96** (8.929): I'm glad we manag to add this album in cuz I loved it! This was short and sweet but did not spare any punches!

**welcome2thejam** (8.857): A fantastic turn and a natural next step for KKB, getting to show some different and exciting sides of them.

**throwaway-7650** (8.786): civ II is so much better than civ II it's not even funny atp

**bespectacIed** (8.714): Still cynical about its inclusion in this rate but ykw, i love KKB and this excellent mini has the most highbrow concept on the lineup... i had to unclench

**fairytalehigh** (8.700): KKB is a longtime favorite of mine. i love how this album bridges the whimsy of their early music with the grit of time n place.

**starlitsuns** (8.571): prior to this rate finally starting I had never listened to this before, so this album is by far the one I have the least knowledge about (even if I've listened to It's Bugsnax! probably 30+ times). still, I think this is a really good album, and I like the themes of a civilisation being wrecked by an apocalyptic flood.

**imbaby122** (8.429): this is such a solid album. every track is fantastic and adds something new to the sonic landscape of the album. i love that this is a pandemic/political album that isn‚Äôt all doom and gloom. it‚Äôs surprisingly unique. the production is so layered and expressive, and it shines on the closer well rested. civilization is a a clever and careful album that kero kero bonito clearly but a lot of care, passion, and emotion behind.

**modulum83** (8.329): i didn't pay much attention to this when it came out but this is unbelievably good. short length, no filler. every song is both conceptually interesting and full of really gorgeous and fun sounds. KKB have never sounded so mature and at the height of their powers.

**qazz23** (8.143): really catchy stuff

**skargardin** (8.000): This is still my favourite KKB project. I would gladly take a full-length project of this.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.929): I don‚Äôt see a Baba Yetu cover in this

**moooo566** (7.857): i do wish they used more of the heavier guitar and drum sounds they were using on time n place, in some ways this feels like a bit of a step back towards intro bonito and bonito generation - it's good but it feels like a missed opportunity to keep going somewhere even cooler

**krusso1105** (7.857): I have less of a strong opinion on this than the other albums but it''s pretty good

**jman457** (7.729): I like a lot of this but they seem a little too video gamey/kitchy to get into completely

**TiltControls** (7.643): Baba Yetu was robbed

**starla\_** (7.543): (Average: 7.5)

**runaway3212** (7.357): we love this album being in this rate

**thedoctordances1940** (7.229): yeah i just like civ ii a lot more than civ i so it ends up being quite a mixed bag for me

**oscarbrierley1** (7.071): I like the individual songs, but for me it doesn't really come together as a project. Like it doesn't create a specific atmosphere for me.

**just\_thonking** (7.000): This was kind of worse than I expected it to be lol

**rslashpoopheads** (7.000): I like a fair few KKB songs but this album doesn't really do it for me

**DirtyRat583** (7.000): very specific complaint but i feel the album (or at least well rested) would be much better if the vocals were more rhythmic

**frogaranaman** (6.286): I somehow got into the Circuit a la Ciudad show at Primavera this year lol, wicked stuff

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.214): Yeah I‚Äôm so sorry guys, I really can‚Äôt get into Kero Kero Bonito‚Ä¶ like I legitimately tried, and there‚Äôs some songs on here like Well Rested I actually loved, but it‚Äôs just not for me. And a lot of it is just due to Sarah‚Äôs vocal performances, and how it just never resonates with me (maybe it‚Äôs the accent?) Like I enjoy the instrumentals somewhat, but they‚Äôre honestly pretty meh-ish for synthpop, and I just couldn‚Äôt enjoy that much of this. Oh well.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.057): kkb said we live in a society /srs

**pig-serpent** (5.571): This ep has some pretty cool vibes but it's lacking in hooks.  I wish I still liked this band as much as I did when I first found them.

**fadedblue09** (5.286): Considering how much I disliked most KKB songs I've heard, this one was surprisingly bearable. There seems to be an underlying concept and storylines to these songs but I can't be bothered to care about them so

**shhhneak** (5.000): Not as annoying as I usually find Kicole Kaige Brooks from Atlanta Georgia to be but somebody has to come in last.

**IIIHenryIII** (4.643): I was very generous with my scores. None of these songs sound pleasing to me, but I was afraid my ballot would get rejected had I given lower scores. This ep is awful.

**ImADudeDuh** (4.571): This was definitely an EP that I had to listen to in order to do this rate.

They said it themselves... the aimed, they attacked, and they lost. Unfortunately for all the magbay stans out there they fall short by just a few points - and if not for one zero from u/letsallpoo they would have won! everyone say thank you to poo .. I know I am incredibly thankful bc we LOVE a Porter win!!! As much as I do really love You Lose!, I was kind of rooting against it for the entire time. It started off by floundering a little and not even being the top magbay song, but as the 11s piled in near the end it rose up, and even made it to #1 for a short time, but it just wasn't enough. We'll have to see how it fares in All Stars...

---

#Well

**runaway3212** (11): more like you win! ha checkmate haters

**2dina3dworld** (10): you win (the indieheads ult bonus rate and maybe this rate?)!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): actually, you lose!

**plastichaxan** (10): it would be kinda funny if this won right after "we are the winners" got last place

**qazz23** (10): wouldn't it be funny if this ends up the winner?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): please be runner up for the gag please be runner up for the gag please be runner up for the gag

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): really hoping this gets second place for the irony

**throwaway-7650** (10): we are the winners first out ->‚úÖyou lose! rate winner -> SOON!

**celladonn** (9.5): More like You Win! (the rate)

**rslashpoopheads** (9): rate loser

**TiltControls** (8.5): I can't tell if it'd be funniest if a song titled 'You Lose!' ends up winning or losing

**cremeebrulee** (7): this better lose

#You Win!

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (11): well this was really fucking painful to do. I debated for a long time whether to give my 11 to this song or the princess and the clock, and for a while I was actually gonna go with KKB, but... i had to go with this song, because it has something princess and the clock doesn't have: a massive amount of angst. okay, maybe P&TC does have a bit of angst, but like this song is fucking *covered* in it, and combined with a powerhouse chorus it's the perfect song to scream at the top of your lungs when you feel like absolute shit. or when you're feeling completely fine. tbh anytime is a good time to scream the chorus to this song it's really good. we love noisy bangers

**DirtyRat583** (11): a song that makes me want to scream (in a good way)

**jasannn** (11): Im typically not a big fan of shoe gays but the combination with the videogames sound somehow made it work. I barely knew what these lyrics were saying yet I was saying ‚ÄúSTREAM YOU LOSE!!‚Äù everyday on discord for months.

**jay?** (11): YASSSSSSSSSSSSS YAS YAS YAS YAS üíãüí£üòç

**just\_thonking** (11): I do lose! All the time every day as much as possible

**MassiveThief** (11): Feels like I just died and learned my life was a simulation while watching the end credits

**nicolas** (11): the reception to this song gotta be social experiment or something, i cant believe everyone here is unironically gassing this weezer for online nerds type beat boohoo the guitars sound more distorted than usual its 2021

**reput4tionera** (11): they were DERANGED for this!!! absolutely off the rails

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): This was already on track to top my spotify wrapped and I thinks its almost guaranteed at this point

**wavingwolves** (11): currently on my two hundred and thirty-sixth play of this song

**welcome2thejam** (11): Second favorite song of 2021. The time for grooves is over, now it's time for the biggest damn banger. This whole song, but that chorus especially, is an anthem in search of a mouth to shout it. Can't wait to see MagBay live to experience that rush with everyone else

**Awkward\_King** (10): the way mica and matt turned shoegaze into shoegays w this one

**BaconShoes** (10): YOU AIM, YOU ATTACK, YOU LOSE!!!!

**bbfan132** (10): i love how chaotic this is - also, it was amazing live

**bespectacIed** (10): Me to them because i want porter to win so bad. Probably will not lose, already sighing at the 372892632 rate references about it. Anyways, I'm gonna have to give this its due. Fantastic production, killer songwriting, especially the chorus

**bluetriangles04** (10): The distortion is insane on this and I really enjoy the buildup and the way it drops for the 2nd chorus.

**Gonza\_90** (10): chef kiss

**imbaby122** (10): video game soundtrack banger. maybe this will turn my gamer brother into a pophead!

**jman457** (10): Love a little guitar pop

**Leixander** (10): that brief transition to the last chorus is perfection

**starlitsuns** (10): if PHCJ is a Juice by Lizzo circlejerk then the pokemon channel in the popheads discord server is a You Lose! circlejerk

**Stryxen** (10): i can‚Äôt explain the way this makes me feel. I‚Äôve gone through stages of thinking this a bit overrated and then realised it‚Äôs absolutely not and is possible one of the best songs ever?? crazy . magdalena bay you will ALWAYS be famous

**thedoctordances1940** (10): the reception to this song gotta be social experiment or something, i cant believe everyone here is unironically gassing this weezer for online nerds type beat boohoo the guitars sound more distorted than usual its 2021

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): the secrets -> you lose! transition is insanity it's true

**WillWorkForSugar** (10): not my 11 but if it ends up highest rated i would not complain

**sarcasticsobs** (9.6): sensing that this may do well‚Ä¶


**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I didn‚Äôt love this instantly, but it has grown on me over time. Still not my fav track but it‚Äôs good

**modulum83** (9.5): MY LIFE IS LIKE A VIDEO GAME

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): gamers rise up

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): But we win!

**homestarguy** (9): Very MGMT-ish. I don‚Äôt love this one as much as others, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said it doesn‚Äôt go hard.

**SmileAndTears** (9): Love this sound for them

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Your favourite shoegaze/noise pop band? They could never.

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): the chiptunes here are everything

**ricki** (8.5): remind me to not be too salty when this wins, i do happen to really like this song

**frogaranaman** (8): I like how this makes me feel like I'm in an 8-bit game of terror

**nt96** (8): not bad for a Grimes song

**apatel27** (8): A bit too maximalist

#You Lose!

**oscarbrierley1** (8): mixed feelings about the crunchy filter over the chorus. On one hand it's kind of grating, but on the other it adds great texture to the song.

**pig-serpent** (8): Super basic opinion, but the chugging guitar is finally a fantastic break from the slower pace of the previous songs.  That said, the production doesn't hit right for me (like it did live) and the song is mostly boosted by being the first heavy song in an album that's only been lowkey until this point.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): This is the worst single from this album, which means it's still pretty good.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): so much of this is just noisy, but i like the parts that aren‚Äôt!

**indie\_fan\_** (6): That distortion is not very pleasant with high volume + headphones

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): I appreciate that it‚Äôs different than a lot of their other songs but unfortunately it loses the parts that I like about them, just not really a fan of this more faded out sound. Chorus is pretty though.

**vayyiqra** (5): I'm undecided about this song. I have no doubt it would go off live as many have said, but listening to it now, it feels kind of underwhelming. There are so many aspects to it I either like or don't like, and the noisy aspect isn't quite working for me. I get the appeal but also it grows off me the more I think about it. So I will spare you all and stop thinking about it.

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Shoegaze huh‚Ä¶.

**LesApfels** (4): It sounds like a discord rip

Coming in to this rate I was really afraid for what popheads would do to my poor meow meow album. Sure, it had a clear group of vocal defenders, but we are all familiar with the history of misandry in rates! Combine being a man with being the least popheads-relevant and making the most "edm" album here, it seemed like it could have been a recipe for disaster. But it's with an ear-to-ear smile on my face that I'm now saying that Porter Robinson is a rate winner and managed to take down the #1 most beloved album from last year with Musician. I've written at length at how much I love this song, the themes of burnout and feelings of inadequacy resonate with me a lot, but it makes me so happy to see that so many of you agree with me and have giving this song the crown in this rate. Can't wait for that #46 placement in Winners 3

#IT'S CALLING

**bigbigbee** (11): I first heard this song over a year ago and have played it more times than I can count since then. I still feel the same explosion of happiness whenever that intro plays - like, it‚Äôs an almost physical reaction in my chest. On an album that can be rather melancholy and introspective, this song is a full release of joy. A conviction that you‚Äôre on the right path. The power in realizing that you‚Äôre happy and saying it out loud. It feels like you can fly.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): I had no idea what to pick between this and Chaeri for 11. The tiebreaker was fighting misandry and weebphobia. Also, in a way this is like also giving KKB an 11.

**CaptainDaisyG** (11): Best song and video of 2021.

**CrimsonROSET** (11): fuck creative burn out and how it causes you to doubt your passions,

**DefaultPophead** (11): The winner is right here.

**exciting\_patient4872** (11): One of the highest certainties for Day 3 of any rate this year, in my opinion. Porter really won me over with this song when it first came out!

**frogaranaman** (11): happy to support Porter and KKB's joint win here!

**modulum83** (11): this song really hits different if you're a music major. if you know, you know. it's easy to feel doubtful about what your future holds, but it's songs like this that help me push through and believe in pursuing my dreams.

**nt96** (11): This was a tough decision. After going back and forth between multiple songs, I came back to this one the most. The lyrics really hit deep as some people have this dumb mentality that being a musician isn't a real job. Sure jan tell that the 50 year old bands you keep listening to on the radio.

**rslashpoopheads** (11): iconic

**SmileAndTears** (11): a slay and a half

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): screaming crying throwing up ect.

**akanewasright** (10): A song that works just as well for nice spring/summer walks as it does for breakdowns over being a useless artist who doesn‚Äôt know what to do with his life anymore, and whether staying on this path is even worth anything! Anyway Sarah Bonito yass

**Awkward\_King** (10): this song is daytime and joy and life

**b\_o\_g\_o\** (10): this samples an unreleased KKB collaboration? well now i really wanna know what that would sound like

**bespectacIed** (10): This was not one of favorite songs in the album at first because the meta-ness broke apart how flawlessly abstract this album is, but I kinda understand the intention now. Plus, how can I harbor even the slightest dislike to this song, it's so sweet and earnest

**cremeebrulee** (10): Its Something About That Song That Make You Wanna Get Up And Bust A Motherfuckin Move

**Gonza\_90** (10): If this song isn't top five, idk anymore

**homestarguy** (10): KKB stays winning!! This one was ascendant live, you can just feel along with Porter how much of a personal breakthrough this song is.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the best use of kero kero bonito in the rate

**imbaby122** (10): i should‚Äôve given this a 0 it‚Äôs too predictable for my favorite song on the album to be the most sugary popheads adjacent track

**jay?** (10): üíãüí£üòç

**notchickeninspanish** (10): It kinda sounds like the screams from It Takes Two are being sampled in the chorus? Either way this bangs.

**pig-serpent** (10): God I love that vocal chop so much

**plastichaxan** (10): my god does this stand out among this album

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this was the song that introduced me to the album‚Ä¶ mostly because I knew it techincally featured KKB, and WOW what an intro, absolutely amazing lyrics, the production is immaculate, another clear 11 contender for me, and if KKB weren't added it probably would've gotten it

**seanderlust** (10): "I burn up, burn out, I shouldn't do this to myself" SEND TWEET.

**starlitsuns** (10): porter singlehandedly described what it‚Äôs like to be a creator in a world where creators aren‚Äôt always looked at in a positive light, i love this man

**Stryxen** (10): this song feels so good when you leave the house for the first time in days and remember the sun exists

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): KKB's true winning song in this rate

**TiltControls** (10): this one actually took a little bit to grow on me, but now I've really grown to love it

**vayyiqra** (10): Even though I don't connect to it as strongly as "Look at the Sky", this is still an amazing song. Only Porter could make a song that's "your deepest insecurities (dance remix)".

**welcome2thejam** (10): To be honest I think this winning would make me even happier than my own 11 would

**you2009** (10): "you just face your fears and become your heroes"

**bbfan132** (9.5): i love this, the production is overwhelming but in a great way

**thedoctordances1940** (9.4): apart from porter straight up lying by saying music is easy to make, this song is amazing and would be a very worthy winner of this rate (even if magbay will obviously win)

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Like it‚Äôs kinda on the nose and in your face but it‚Äôs a good time so it‚Äôs like, fuck it right?

**reput4tionera** (9): porter and kkb can we please get the original collab im begging

**skargardin** (9): : "I burn up, burn out, I shouldn't do this to myself" - me whenever I'm forced to work overtime out of necessity

**throwaway-7650** (9): scratch my wind tempos comment ~~piano~~ -> *musician* era

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): the animated video is gorgeous; not a fan of the sample

**DirtyRat583** (8.4): going from worst to one of the best - he really focused his energy on this didnt he

**sarcasticsobs** (8.3): not super into the breakdown around 2:30, but the rest is real fun

**fairytalehigh** (8.1): love the lyrics but the production could go a little harder i think

**bluetriangles04** (8): the way Wind Tempos blends into this one was done so well honestly... burn out is a serious issue (says the college kid)

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): if you think about it, these lyrics are kinda about doing rates

**runaway3212** (8): great but overrated

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): really love the lyrics on this one, they're so simple but so sincere and powerful. and the bridge goes off!

**wavingwolves** (7.1): i switched on this song just like a

#burnt out

**apatel27** (7): It's amazing outside the thing that sounds like a squeaky duck

**ignitethephoenix** (7): let me not relisten to this again because I liked it less on second listen lol

**BaconShoes** (6.5): i was sort of feeling this one but idk this production is not my favorite

**jman457** (6.5): its fine on its own but it sounds like everything else thats on this album so far

**Uberpigeon** (5): i dont like the vocals im sorry

**fadedblue09** (4): I'm not fond of the overly processed vocal elements, it teeters on grating. Also is that a dog squealing in the background?

hikkaru: # Mercurial World

---

**Overall Average**: 7.896 **// Average Controversy:** 1.790

---

Voted the #1 favourite album of 2021 among popheads, named by many as "most likely to dominate the 2021 Electronic Pop Rate"... it ends up being very comparable to Nurture and Civilisation in averages (we will not talk about Screen Violence). While it did have a big chunk of day 3, it also has a few mediocre tracks that were early out on day 1. Ultimately though, it does not pull through with the win. Admittedly I was rooting against this album just a tad - I mean, it's always more exciting to see a less expected winner (especially since last time I hosted was the Midnight Sky win...) - but I do really like this album and it's so great that this subreddit has fully embraced this lesser-known duo that do nothing but put out amazing pop music.

**nicolas** (9.950): why did people continue to release music after this dropped i would be so embarrassed

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (9.500): i go back and forth on whether this album or SIMBI is my favorite album of 2021, but right now after relistening to this for the rate... yeah this is it. endlessly creative and fun album, near perfect

**RandomHypnotica** (9.486): I was at first a little bit let down by this project, compared to the absolutely amazing EP's magbay have put out prior, if only because I didn't emotionally resonate quite as much with it immediately. But on this revisit, I'm realising that so many of the tracks are incredible earworms, and they're polished to perfection.

**qazz23** (9.357): one my favorite synthpop albums of the past few years, every track here is catchy and the production is immaculate

**SFbby** (9.071): I can't decide if I like the studio version of the album or the live versions they play more, but the regular production of the album is absolutely phenomenal and it translates just as well in banger after banger at their shows. Also the transitions are A+++

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.036): my *second* favorite album of 2021 from one of pop's most consistent acts. seriously, just bop after bop after bop. i love the way they wear their simultaneously 80s/90s/00s influences on their sleeve, but twist and contort them into something super fresh and chic. it's so cool to see such a fleshed-out project from them after following them all these years!

**imbaby122** (9.036): this is THEE album for the internet era. from an aesthetic standpoint it channels the futurism of the y2k in a modern way (so obsessed with mica and her britney mic on tour). secrets (your fire) is the most reflective of the internet age thematically, but the thread runs through the album‚Äôs more potent themes of love, mental health, and existential crisis. i also love the video gamey elements of some of the songs. incredibly well-produced, incredibly fun, incredible album.

**just\_thonking** (8.964): love her!!!!!!!!!!

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.786): gonna be dancing to this on loop when I'm trapped in the void

**throwaway-7650** (8.750): I overrated it a bit in AOTY voting last year, hopefully popheads doesn't make the same mistake in this rate! CHVRCHES my meow

**jman457** (8.736): The best album released last year. Like legit just the most perfect pop album anyone could make make. Like they should be at least Charli xcx big

**starlitsuns** (8.721): this album didn't click for me until after the end of 2021 but it's already one of my top 5 2021 albums in regards to scrobbles. chaeri and you lose! have special places in my heart, and there are so many high points on this album for me.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.671): hasn‚Äôt gotten old to me yet, just some great hooks

**plastichaxan** (8.643): This fell of for me a little, and it‚Äôs still fucking great lol, I had forgotten how incredible these transitions are and how easy it is to get lost in Mercurial World looping the album over and over again

**fairytalehigh** (8.629): easily magbay's strongest work, and just a solid ass synth-pop album. it feels weird rating it because it's so cohesive, a consummate vibe.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.536): This is such an amazing album; however, the first half really carries it imo. The last 5 tracks are not bad, but they can't keep up with the previous ones. Anyways, the transitions are on another level here; dare I say, otherworldly. It was definitely one of the best releases of last year.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.421): This is a very good album, I like this album. It is not always amazing, some of the production can be a bit too washed out at times for me but like these are mainly very good songs so I can't complain too much

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.393): I already have a long ass write-up about this album for the Album of the Year series, but it seems like my feelings have not really changed at all about it. Sporting a relatively diverse pool of genre influences on their sleeves, Magdalena Bay‚Äôs debut is a sparkling, bouncy, catchy, danceable, and extremely well-executed debut record that seems to do the tasks that their influences (some of whom are in this rate!) do and then some. Magnificent production, very consistent, several highlights everywhere, just an excellent project all around!

**Stryxen** (8.350): most hyped release of 2021 did NOT disappoint, some all time fave songs on here thank you matt and mica

**modulum83** (8.307): it's hard to deny how solid this is - i love how many genres this explores and how well it executes all of them. that said, there's something about this that feels a little too...constructed? for me

**Mudkip1** (8.286): this album is so major, when i saw her on the carpet I was like 'oh slay.' STOPPP- i swear, i swear, like, ssl-big slay. wait like big slay? yeah big slay, you're killing it. stoppp it gurlllll...

**welcome2thejam** (8.071): Gorgeous is the best way to describe it. I adore her voice, love the production, some of the best hooks of the year came out of this, and it's a blast to listen to.

**Awkward\_King** (8.036): been a magbay fan since a little rhythm and seeing their come-up on the sub and in indie circles has been so slay!!!

**krusso1105** (8.036): This album really grew on me and probably is in my top 10 for the year.

**nt96** (8.000): Mag Bay has made some phenomenal songs over the years. Despite this, I've heard some comments regarding their new album being a bit overrated, and I can kinda see why. Don't get me wrong, this album is very strong and their singles bop, however I wasn't truly WOWED by it.

**DirtyRat583** (7.971): the groove is strong on this album and im absolutely here for it. beautiful album beginning to end, i will not tolerate hate towards it

**oscarbrierley1** (7.964): there is a reason that this was popheads top album of last year. It's great apart from a few just ok songs.

**skargardin** (7.929): I still prefer some of their other projects as a whole to this, but the highs are some REALLY amazing highs, like Chaeri, Secrets and You Lose!.

**bespectacIed** (7.857): My individual song scores may not reflect it, but as a whole, t think this is an excellent concept pop album

=====

hikkaru: **vayyiqra** (7.714): Alright, this is a weird album in a way. I like it. I see the appeal. Something is still not quite clicking with me and I don't know if it's contrarianism. On some level I bet it is. I like Magbay, they're talented, they're good songwriters, their aesthetics are appealing. I still don't quite get why the internet felt this was The Best Pop Album Of The Year without question, and maybe never will. It is very good, it's full of strong melodies and well-structured songs. It's amazingly well-produced and flows very well too. It has a couple of flaws which keep me from loving it on the same level so much of the rest of Popheads does. One is that it is kind of samey. This isn't that big a flaw though, because it's not a long album, so it doesn't drag. The biggest flaw is that the lyrics are not that good. They're okay, but for a lot of them I'd have no clue what they're about without reading what Magbay themselves have said about the songs. That isn't true of Nurture or Civilisation, so it's a drawback. This album also seems like it goes for a whole Concept about the nature of the internet and technology, and while it's an intriguing subject and these themes are there, they aren't explored very deeply. If you don't care about lyrical analysis and just want to bop to it though, it's a pretty amazing album with nary a bad song on it (ignore my 0 here I explain that elsewhere). A very good album, but still maybe a bit overhyped and I still would rather that Porter or KKB win the rate. But if this wins I won't be mad because Magbay deserve it for making a good album that appeals to almost everyone. Also, even though I have nitpicks with some tracks, at least half of this album is just fire.

**SmileAndTears** (7.714): There are a lot of bops on this album but I'm just not hearing what a lot of people are. While there are some amazing songs, I just dont think it's better than their past projects.

**starla\_** (7.707): (Average: 7.7)

**indie\_fan\_** (7.614): I think it‚Äôs a great album for what it tries to be, but it‚Äôs just not really for me.

**cremeebrulee** (7.529): magbay was one of the best concerts i've ever been to and seeing these songs live solidified how incredible of an album this is. if they dominate, it's well-deserved!

**frogaranaman** (7.500): buying this vinyl was one of the most painful processes ever because gay people can't help but own six copies of the same album

**moooo566** (7.286): i only knew like two magdalena bay songs before this, but ill be paying attention going forward! thanks, hosts!

**2dina3dworld** (7.250): it hasn‚Äôt even been a year and I think that it's already aged poorly. It felt like it changed the world when it came out, but now I‚Äôm very sure that I just got caught in the hype machine and I decided to be hyped and fixate on the three 10s on the album without realising that the rest of it is kinda average and samey sounding.

**TiltControls** (7.214): Doesn't match up for me against 'A Little Rhythm' but solid overall.

**shhhneak** (7.107): I want to love this because it‚Äôs on the precipice of shoegaze and synthwave but I‚Äôve fallen short again. I like their sound but their lyrics are immediately forgettable, if I can even parse them. At least their aesthetic is rad.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.857): I feel like most of Magdalena Bay's songs are on the cusp of being awesome but just aren't quite there. This is a really solid album though and the transitions make it a great start to finish listen.

**notchickeninspanish** (6.643): Great, uh, great production. Beautiful production. If they ever learn to write as well as they produce, I feel like this band would take over the planet.

**pig-serpent** (6.357): This album either has great production and meh songwriting, or great songwriting and meh production, with only a song or 2 managing to have both.  Especially by the end of the album, most songs feel like "generic Mag Bay song with a gimmick during the chorus" and the good ideas on this album should've been condensed into a smaller tracklist.  I've tried really hard to see what other people love about this album, and I can sort of see it and think this is a solid debut, it really doesn't have anything on Nurture or Screen Violence.

**apatel27** (5.893): As an album it's far more enjoyable compared to how each track is individually

**fadedblue09** (5.857): No shade but I think this should stick to making EPs for now. They probably have the most solid songs, but they also have a lot of awful or uninteresting songs and aimless interludes in almost the same proportion.

**LesApfels** (5.714): This album has never really clicked for me, but I gotta give it to them for how immaculate the transitions are

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.514): ive tried to put into words what it is about this album i don‚Äôt like and why i never got the appeal and i just cant find the rights words for it but i think after listening to it a few times my biggest problem is just that i‚Ä¶really do not like mica‚Äôs voice? i can‚Äôt even describe what it is specifically i dislike about it but whenever i hear her sing it almost immediately decreases my enjoyment of any song on this album. my good scores on this album are in spite of her vocals and not because of them. also musically i just don‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs anything particularly groundbreaking that hasn‚Äôt been done by other ‚Äúinternetcore‚Äù musicians 100 times before them so why they‚Äôre the ones in particular getting all the acclaim is just baffling to me.

**wavingwolves** (5.407): the transitions are the highlight of the album

hikkaru: # Nurture

---

**Overall Average**: 7.885 **// Average Controversy:** 1.788

---

Talented, brilliant, incredible, etc etc... even during the time of pre-release singles for this album I knew it was really something special. Porter isn't a sub fave by any means really, and probably had the weakest Popheads stock amongs this group (with Magdalena Bay's meteoric rise, KKB's immense acclaim among online spaces, CHVRCHES' long-standing fanbase over their decade-long career), but when I managed to get a rate idea in with Nurture included I was cheering, screaming, crying etc. I never really expected to be able to rate this album at all, it would be yet another niche fave that doesn't fit anywhere, so even just getting the opportunity to rate it was monumental to me. To have it actually perform fairly well and pull of the rate win? In a rate where the competition is 3 female vocalists? Truly a moment we must remember. On this day, misandry lost for once. This album means a lot to me (cough AOTY writeup post cough) and I'm so happy with how it turned out in this rate.

**sage** (10.071): perfect i would be dead without this album blah blah blah trauma dumping etc etc

**DefaultPophead** (10.071): This album is easily in my top 10 albums of all time. Revisiting it made me change my TTPT.

**starlitsuns** (9.929): okay, let me try to keep this as short as possible. but I discovered Porter in very late 2019 after finally listening to Worlds following seeing eight kajillion recommendations listening to a couple of Monstercat projects I really enjoyed and still enjoy now. my world had entirely been thrown apart with the destruction of my special interest in Star Wars when my expectations for the end of the sequel trilogy were laughed off. however, I instantly clicked with Divinity, and made it my first track I listened to as the New Year's Eve ball dropped to approach 2020. not even 2 months later, Porter announced Nurture and Get Your Wish was released. as Something Comforting was dropped right as I expected to spend my last two months of the semester at school and my mental health was instantly falling from a high not reached in a long time thanks to a fucking viral pandemic, I needed something to keep me going. this album became that something, and after 15 months of waiting, I made sure I was awake early before work to listen to the album that gave me so much happiness. I may not be the same person I was when I first listened to Porter following the destruction of my at-the-time very long term special interest, but it has been a very fun ride seeing Nurture come to life. I have so many memories from this album and the live show I went to that I can cherish for hopefully the rest of my life. so thank you, Porter. also since I have been really nice during this rate and not trying to promote the Worlds/Adventure/third album (aka Porter and Madeon rate) rate idea I am happy to announce that it should be coming back this next rate cycle! I finally have a third album I will be sticking with until the time this rate finally becomes more than just a ratecom fave, so if you liked Nurture, please consider voting and faveing it in the next rate selection cycle. üåº‚ù§Ô∏è

**vayyiqra** (9.643): All the details are in my comments but I love this album so much; it's so uplifting and pure. It makes me feel better every time I hear it; it's music that makes you glad to be alive. It's a masterpiece of songwriting. Porter is a genius musician and this was one of the best albums of last year, I understand why he's insecure about a lot of things but very few things that have come out in the last few years have moved me like this album did. It's beautiful.

**TiltControls** (9.571): One of my favourite albums of all time and I hope that Popheads will give it the justice it deserves. It's basically the equivalent feeling of lying out in the grass on a breezy spring day

**throwaway-7650** (9.500): god what a masterful album. I did listen to this when it came out and liked some songs but didn't go back to it, however as I relistened to tracks in preparation for this rate, I realized how impactful nurture is, both the lyrics and sonically. this is the album that deserves to be robbed the least tbh

**RandomHypnotica** (9.450): Without a doubt one of my favourite projects of last year, and it would easily be getting my 11 if not for KKB being here, there are so many songs that hit so personally to me, and porter has really struck a nerve with both the lyricism and production on here. Incredible stuff.

**frogaranaman** (9.429): I love you Porter Robinson

**bespectacIed** (9.357): Grew to be one of my most treasured albums ever, the impact this album had on me is irreversible and bone deep. Projecting much, but this is the embodiment of a terminally depressed person experiencing a split-second, fleeting sense of clarity and bliss

**thedoctordances1940** (9.114): An absolutely brilliant album and one that was so immediately impactful and influential. 2021 already saw so many electronic that were clearly influenced by Nurture, especially the whole nature vibes of it all and it's just something this album does so well. There are so many great tracks here as well and the whole feel good message of it all is executed perfectly. Just one of the best albums of 2021, not much more to say.

**fairytalehigh** (9.043): if you told me in 2011 that in 10 years, porter "100% in the bitch" robinson was going to release an electro-shoegaze album about self-reflection and mental health that would make me cry, i would've laughed in your face. and yet.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.929): As someone who still isn‚Äôt very sold on the hype of Worlds, this is a remarkable breath of fresh air, and a major, major improvement on all fronts. Nurture is best described as a warm, fuzzy hug, and it‚Äôs a record that I can come back to over and over and come out feeling significantly happier. Yes this record has a few duds, but they‚Äôre still fitting within the grand scheme of the record. And when the rest of the tracklist is this consistently bumping and fun and whimsical - who on earth cares? This style really, really suits Porter and I really want to see him grow in this direction.

**indie\_fan\_** (8.800): The album cover perfectly encaptures how the album sounds like, if that makes any sense

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.750): missed opportunity to rate this with Minecraft and mydreamfever in the "Touching Grass" Rate

**MassiveThief** (8.679): I honestly can't remember the last album I liked that was this genuinely positive. It was such a necessary album last year (at least for me), and it feels like a little treasure. Unbelievably consistent and Porter's production is nearly unmatched.

**nt96** (8.500): This was a fascinating album! I felt strange sense of nostalgia from some of the music cuz reminded me of the Wii, which is funny since that era was technically ahead of my childhood but I digress. This album is like a warm hug from an old friend.

hikkaru: **Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.464): came into this not knowing a single thing about him but damn if this album didn't win me over. it's a little inconsistent, especially towards the beginning, but he goes all in on this record and the emotional journey it takes you on is probably the best one in the rate. the deeply introspective lyricism and the hayao-miyazaki-meets-john-hughes-naturecore-nostalgiafest sonic aesthetic really just tug at your heartstrings. loved it.

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (8.464): the title and cover for this album are spot on, it's super nurturing and feels like a warm hug from nature

**bigbigbee** (8.429): this is one of my favorite albums ever. I mention this on Mother, but Porter has a beautiful way of holding happiness and sadness in the same song. it manifests differently in different tracks - happiness that one‚Äôs discovered hope to get through current bad times; the happiness of being loved and the sadness that it might be over someday; whatever the fuck Wind Tempos has going on.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.371): ngl, I didn't like this album on my first 3 listens. The intro was the only track I really enjoyed. Maybe I was disappointed because of the high expectations I had after listening to the intro. However, this rate changed my mind on it. It's a really good piece of work and I really like it. There are some tracks that are not it for me (yet), but most of the tracklist has grown on me. Look at the Sky for example was like a 3 before this rate, but now look at the score I gave it. I'm in shock! Anyway, great album. I forgot to mention that the live performance on YouTube is gorgeous. His visual effects team is top notch.

**Stryxen** (8.371): got into this album far too late and it simply blew me away, never expected this would put up such a fight for my 11s.

**imbaby122** (8.321): almost every song from this album made it onto my ‚Äúeverything will be okay methinks‚Äù playlist, which is a hard playlist for any song to make it onto considering my pessimistic nature. the production on every song evokes a feeling of comfort and better days ahead. i can already imagine putting this album on after a particularly rough day or a depressive episode. i‚Äôm impressed by any album that can channel an emotion so vibrantly, and nurture definitely achieves that. this is an album that i not only enjoyed, but am incredibly grateful to have listened to.

**apatel27** (8.321): He just can't miss

**skargardin** (8.286): The absolute standouts on this album are just so incredible, as is the overall vibe of the album. The production remains interesting and constantly keeps you guessing for what's next throughout the whole album. I really love the warmth the album gives off, even if some songs still have some room to grow on me.

**welcome2thejam** (8.143): Found myself raising a couple of scores from my ratings last year. Even at its saddest or most bittersweet or when it portrays such hard struggles, it's still has such an overwhelming warmth to it.

**wavingwolves** (8.136): good weeb music


**2dina3dworld** (8.000): I personally like my breakdown music to be less clean and/or more wacky. This doesn‚Äôt really do it for me, and I appreciate that it‚Äôs an album that means a lot of things for a lot of people, but I can‚Äôt connect with it at all and therefore, as someone who‚Äôs never been a fan of the clean progressive house sound, it just falls flat for me. The best parts are where it either leans into ambience, or decides to be ‚Äòmessy‚Äô in sound.

**sarcasticsobs** (7.800): shoutout to weebs. still hard to believe this is the same gut who made ‚Äú100% in The Bitch‚Äù back when i was in college

**modulum83** (7.650): i've got a complicated relationship with this album. i like it for the most part, but mostly for what it's trying to do than for what it is; porter robinson's songwriting voice is admirable but many times the biggest obstacle to my enjoying these otherwise great little EDM/electropop songs. when he managed to hit upon a truth of self-love and creativity that i resonate with, it's powerful, but all too often it's like watching your best friend trying to recite a motivational speech into the mirror when you're not supposed to be looking.

**jman457** (7.607): This was hyped a lot by this sub but tbh it felt a little too much in edm/pop cliche‚Äôs to really reach its true ambitions. A little more Aphex twin a little less Chainsmokers

**cremeebrulee** (7.507): popheads users bigbigbee tiltcontrols and hikkaru held a gun to my head and said you will like this album and you know what i will

**ImADudeDuh** (7.214): I was surprised that people weren‚Äôt lying and this did make you feel stuff a lot

**krusso1105** (7.214): I really liked this album overall and feel bad that the few filler songs tanked its rating a bit

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.107): maybe this is just because i was going through finals week and was super depressed through my first listen through of this album for the rate but like‚Ä¶i would be lying if i said i didn‚Äôt cry multiple times listening to this. it‚Äôs albums like this that remind me why i love music so much and why it means so much to me.

**just\_thonking** (7.071): Kinda hit or miss for me but it does nurture I'll give you that

**rslashpoopheads** (7.036): the highs and the lows

**DirtyRat583** (6.864): im not tanking this because its a man i promise. this album underwhelms me so much. it had potential but the magic just wasnt there like it was for mercurial world, for example

**notchickeninspanish** (6.714): This was a pleasant surprise for me this rate, as I hadn't paid any attention to Porter before this rate. One thing I really like about this album is there are some really cool experimental neoclassical touchpoints - Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Ryuichi Sakamoto - that I hear in the composition of these songs. It wasn't my favorite because Jesus Christ just listen to Civilisation, but it was the most interesting sonic palette to me by a significant margin.

**starla\_** (6.600): (Average: 6.6)

**qazz23** (6.214): some good standouts (Mother / Musician / Get Your Wish) but otherwise not varied enough and much too long

**plastichaxan** (6.036): I wish I could see what you all see in it, I really do, unfortunately it is not the case, I appreciate the album and a lot of its themes but musically it does nothing for me apart from a few songs I consider great, I‚Äôm glad it has its fans but sadly I‚Äôm not one of them.

**shhhneak** (5.950): The only album I haven‚Äôt listened to in this rate. It started out promising but then I zoned out by the end. There‚Äôs something very comforting about the blend of electronica and nature sounds.

**oscarbrierley1** (5.750): this album is half great, half random button presses. I dont get the super experimental songs they sound like someone messing around on a sound board to me.

**fadedblue09** (5.607): Very soothing and quite a different experience for an EDM album. That being said, a lot of these really sound like music for a certain‚Ä¶..demographic, for better or for worse, to the point it almost radiates a really cheesy energy at times.

**moooo566** (5.286): finally answering the question: what music would a person make if the only music they'd ever heard was jrpg intros and mid noughties ringtones (the default ones, not the cool ones you buy by texting a dodgy number you found in the back of a free magazine)?

enormously special shoutout to the legend /u/bigbigbee for helping me get the rank graphs in order with a reasonable amount of ease and swiftness, a lot of headache was saved bc I am NOT an excel gal in the slightest

TiltControls: Great job Hikk on the amazing rate!!! This was one of my most hyped ones of the cycle so I was a little sad I had to miss it for RL reasons but it looked tons of fun!!

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates are up! 

##**Songs**

CONGRATS TO **MUSICIAN** FOR THE WIN TODAY!! I WASN'T HERE FOR THE REVEAL SO I'M GETTING MY EXCITEMENT OUT NOW!!!

**Musician** places 226th across all rated songs in the database. Though number of 11's isn't enough to make leaderboard, it (and **You Lose!** which also got 17) would be in an 8 way tie for 44th most

Though the gap between it and You Lose! was close, it is only 21st overall in terms of lowest average separating first and second with 0.049 between the two songs (Concrete Angel vs. Stupid Horse in the Hyperpop rate had the same average difference separation, for reference)

For the other 9+ rated songs in the rate:

* You Lose!: 268th

* The Princess and the Clock: 325th

##**Artists**

Before getting into the artist averages we've got some artist leaderboard updates

* With a couple songs picking up a 0, **Magdalena Bay** loses their **no zeroes** status they maintained throughout the 2020 EP rate and the previous All Stars bumping the number of artists with this feat back down to only 13.

* After this rate **CHVRCHES** are now on the leaderboard for **most songs rated** with 49. This places them in 23rd and knocks Marina off the list.

Back to the averages, KKB and Porter both now have enough to be placed on the chart (though both artists have previous songs affecting their placement) while Mag Bay and CHVRCHES will be updating their previous scores. This ranking is out of 309 artists

* 69th: Christine and the Queens (7.875)
* **70th: Porter Robinson (7.873) [NEW RANKING]**
* 71st: Tyler, The Creator (7.869)

_

* 76th: Two Door Cinema Club (7.850)
* **77th: Kero Kero Bonito (7.839) [NEW RANKING]**
* 78st: Girls' Generation (7.835)
* **79th: Magdalena Bay (7.830) [PREVIOUSLY 103rd]**
* 79th: Dolly Parton (7.830)
* 81st: Arca (7.827)

_

* 204th: Taylor Swift (7.299)
* **205th: CHVRCHES (7.293) [PREVIOUSLY 223rd]**
* 206th: GFriend (7.290)


##**Albums**

Some more album stats coming too!

* **Screen Violence** unfortunately ends up in the **earliest exits leaderboard** for 4 album rates for just barely failing to crack the top 10. They tie for 6th earliest leaving with Doja Cat (from 2021 Ult), Halsey (2017 Alt), and Sly & The Family Stone (70's Soul) with all just barely missing the top 10.

Now onto the averages! (This is out of 338 albums rated - not including EPs)


* 70th: Green Day - American Idiot (7.955)
* **71st: Kero Kero Bonito - Civilisation (7.953)**
* 72nd: Lucy Dacus - Home Video (7.950)

_

* 81st: Erykah Badu - Baduizm (7.899)
* **82nd: Magdalena Bay - Mercurial World (7.897)**
* 82nd: Lily Allen - It's Not Me, It's You (7.897)
* 84th: Janet Jackson - The Velvet Rope (7.896)
* 84th: Allie X - Cape God (7.896)

_

* 89th: Wolf Alice - Blue Weekend (7.888)
* **90th: Porter Robinson - Nurture (7.885)**
* 90th: Robyn - Honey (7.885)
* 92nd: Tegan & Sara - Love You to Death (7.884)

_


* 176th: Hannah Diamond - Reflections (7.566)
* **177th: CHVRCHES - Screen Violence (7.558)**
* 178th: Lady Gaga - Born This Way (7.557)

Also the album sheet has been updated not to show non-album average if the album didn't have any extra songs included with it in the rate and now also shows what the overall rate average was so you can see how well it did in comparison to everything else (thanks to user MToms for the suggestion!)
