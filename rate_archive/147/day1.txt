Well was there any other option for this placement... I thought it would be fun to include this even though it's the most obvious target of interludephobia ever since it's... not really a song, just a cute little instrumental bridge between the two Civilisation EPs. I didn't want to exclude other tracks like The End and Lifelike since I think they're pretty important parts of their respective albums, so it would be a little weird to just choose one of these types of tracks to get rid of in the rate. But yeah, the obvious #48, sorry to KKB's average!

---

#Astute observation: this is an interlude

**2dina3dworld** (10): people who give 10s to interludes are so brave.

**notchickeninspanish** (10): This album did the impossible and made me love an interlude track.

**nt96** (10): Interludephobia is a bitch but so am I. This gets a 10.

**ricki** (10): interlude solidarity

**starlitsuns** (10): screw the interludephobes: this is perfectly fine

**Uberpigeon** (10): outsold missed call and the cats pajamas

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): yes this is basically just a transition but idc it's good, it sounds like I'm travelling through time, and it's gonna be last place anyway and I'm not tanking my kkb average for this

**plastichaxan** (9): combat interludephobia with your favorite yass sounds

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.5): like i said i cannot say anything bad about an interlude but this one is especially bangerish

**jman457** (8.3): screw interludephobia

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is so meta actually because this EP focuses on themes of apocalypse and the downfall of humanity… and what’s the greatest threat facing society today? Interludephobia.

**reput4tionera** (8): a cute little beep boop interlude!!! im not mad at a cute little beep boop interlude!!! no i am not!!!

**BaconShoes** (7): it’s pretty but yeah it’s just a interlude. Nothing amazing

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): fine but unnecessary interlude

**bbfan132** (6): giving this a 6 because it’s pretty despite it being a short interlude

**bluetriangles04** (6): it's decent for a short little interlude and I think it fits nicely in between the two tracks it kind of bridges together.

**welcome2thejam** (6): Not the interlude destroying my 9 average!

**starla\_** (5.3): a fun interlude

**rslashpoopheads** (5): interludephobia

**SmileAndTears** (5): I've had it with useless interludes/instrumental tracks. **Cardi B voice** What was the reason? WHAT WAS THE REASON?

**thedoctordances1940** (5): yeah idk it's just an interlude track it's like a cute little moment ig but not much more

**DirtyRat583** (3): giving this a low score because this is legitimately not long enough for me to give it a score (not just after 1 listen, too)

**Awkward\_King** (2): i like that they made a new song for this ep even if it was just a shitty transitional one kinda slapped on

**static\_int\_husp** (0): interlude phobia, this is the worst one

#Something else

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): You’re telling me this wasn’t on the Fez soundtrack?

**cremeebrulee** (10): bop!

**homestarguy** (10): This is what they play as you pass this mortal coil.

**throwaway-7650** (9): the way this is the only track I stream from the Civilisation album

**jay?** (8): move mojito

**wavingwolves** (7.8): slayed

**modulum83** (7.6): this is somewhere in between a cool vaporwave moment and a jingle for the next ride at Animal Kingdom

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): lowkey served more than the first 3 songs

**Stryxen** (7.5): i think the inside of my brain sounds like this

**bigbigbee** (7): I kind of like how this makes my brain feel

**fairytalehigh** (7): it sounds like booting up a beloved video game console. that said there's not much else to say here, we all know she's going day 1

**vayyiqra** (7): Okay it's just a minute of Super Mario 64 sounds but I like it ! Even though it goes nowhere but they had to tie together both Civilisations somehow so why not. This score is kind of arbitrary idk.

**jasannn** (6.5): i mean it does feel like im walking in a gateway

**TiltControls** (6.5): It's pretty. but also just kind of there

**frogaranaman** (6): drug

**seanderlust** (6): this sounds like a malfunctioning wii menu (complimentary)

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): Wait that’s it?

**CrimsonROSET** (5): she’s cute but what’s cute next to gorgeous

**IIIHenryIII** (5): meh

**ImADudeDuh** (5): remember that story about Radiohead play testing their instruments at the start of a concert and when they finished, the audience cheered cause they thought it was a new song? What if it was a song?

**imbaby122** (5): beep boop bop interlude

**pig-serpent** (5): This isn't part of The River?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): well

**bespectacIed** (4): 1st out me thinks

**runaway3212** (4): i am bored

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): eh it wasn’t really necessary

**oscarbrierley1** (1): gives almost nothing, I kept missing it when I was trying to listen to it to give it a score.

**skargardin** (0): I fear that this was really unnecessary

Another interlude cut, but this one is obviously a bit more of an actual song than Gateway is. I definitely appreciate how much this sounds like the original NES Zelda dungeon theme, idk if that was intentional (knowing them, probably) but it's the most noteworthy part of this song so that's all I really have to say about it! Interludephobia lives on and it's not really unwarranted here at all.

#Glass half full

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Some songs have bridges. This whole album has a bridge.

**nicolas** (10): deserves day 3

**RandomHypnotica** (10): we fucking LOVE crunchy glitchpop

**starlitsuns** (10): this quadruple of songs from you lose! to halfway is so euphoric, just nothing but absolute dreaminess all around

**throwaway-7650** (10): was going to say "this is ambient ASMR" but that's just The End

**bbfan132** (9): that second half is beautiful, i feel like i’m floating through some purple galaxy

**homestarguy** (9): Even though the band admitted it was not a direct influence, this is some Link to the Past-ass synth pop. Just flexing with those synth waves at the end.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): now why did they go so hard with this song honestly

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): meta tracklisting

**BaconShoes** (8): a cute lil song halfway-ish in the album

**ignitethephoenix** (8): honestly this is a pretty cool transition piece

**just\_thonking** (8): the drumming on this is so fun to watch live

**qazz23** (8): wow an appropriately named track

**reput4tionera** (8): ok interlude!!!

**Stryxen** (8): halfway more like totalslay

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): i will not speak ill of any filler tracks that exist solely to transition seamlessly from one song to another

**modulum83** (7.8): oh what i never paid attention to this song before but its kinda good

**jman457** (7.7): not the best interlude ever but love the beat switch

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (7.5): I feel like the song could've ended before the ambient synth stuff but it's still a good interlude

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): the LAYERS to the title of this track… there are two

**imbaby122** (7.5): existential af interludes

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): More like halfway between just a mehh song and an amazing song haha ha… ha.

**bigbigbee** (7): Do they actually sample Zelda music in this? It’s uncanny

**fairytalehigh** (7): get it guys it's HALFWAY through the album

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I wish I liked this more, but this is in the way of the amazing run of perfect songs on the album

**runaway3212** (7): you know what??? this is good

**static\_int\_husp** (7): I will be slightly less interludephobic b/c this kinda bops

**jay?** (6): 💋

#Half empty

**vayyiqra** (6): See it is called "Halfway" because it is the halfway point of the album. I am very intelligent

**welcome2thejam** (6): Oh sweet jesus, it's Halfway cause we're halfway through the album, isn't it?

**starla\_** (5.8): it's an interlude

**CrimsonROSET** (5): … cute!

**frogaranaman** (5): me with the score this song gets

**plastichaxan** (5): i don’t know how to rate this i’ve disagreed with every score i put before this comment

**shhhneak** (5): This interlude is unnecessary but I like the Stranger Things esque production.

**oscarbrierley1** (4): it's a little too long, but a cute transition

**cremeebrulee** (3.5): mid

**fadedblue09** (3): the first minute sounds like a demon incantation

**rslashpoopheads** (3): interludephobia

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): oh god im only halfway through this album? this is going to be painful to finish

**akanewasright** (2): This didn’t have to exist

**ImADudeDuh** (0): alright why does this exist lol

**TiltControls** (0): Why is the back half so ominous. I feel like I just got transported to Silent Hill

It's no surprise to see this so low, in fact I thought it might have had a chance to be beneath Gateway even... so at least that didn't happen? Half of this is just a keysmash and for some that's cool and fun but obviously it's generally not super enjoyable to listen to... I mostly fall into the former camp I just think it's neat but it's the obvious first out for Porter.

---

#kldfjhfkdhfdgfdjkgfdghfjkdghfjkghfjkdghfkd (complimentary)

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): A glitchy, fun, kind of danceable tune with several layers, but is still soft enough to fit with the rest of the tracklist. A banger and a half, honestly. Especially that ending!

**DefaultPophead** (10): Go off, Porter!!!

**frogaranaman** (10): yasss error sounds core

**jman457** (10): This looks like like a reddit username but it still bops

**RandomHypnotica** (10): if charli xcx did this you would all die

**runaway3212** (10): hyperpop

**starlitsuns** (10): this is a masterpiece in the art of meta music, seriously this explains creator’s block so well </3 also this is hyperpop, dullscythe and a. g. cook’s stargon live in the same plane of hyperpop, don’t change my mind

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i need help immediately but yassified

**throwaway-7650** (10): this song is the equivalent of a keyboard smash (NOT A DRAG)

**wavingwolves** (9.8): like on stardew valley????

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): :Dull:

**bbfan132** (9): i love the glitchier tracks on here

**bespectacIed** (9): this is crazy, metaphors and interpretations aside, this does sound cutting through something with a dull knife but in a slayful way

**fairytalehigh** (9): i know this is going to get shafted day 1 so i'm boosting it here, it's a clever and dope little interlude.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): king of hyperpop

**notchickeninspanish** (9): See, an album full of this would be EXTREMELY my shit.

**skargardin** (9): I don't really have any intersting to say here, I just think the production is super neat and whimsical

**TiltControls** (9): A really odd track that at times is the equivalent of a keysmash, but it actually works fantastically.

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): this is kind of like the battle lines of the album

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): pissed that this has the lowest amount of plays for the whole record on spotify

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (8): glitchy bangers!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): not my favorite instrumental on the album but i kinda still enjoy the choppiness of it, sometimes it seems like it starts and stops but tries again which is a really nice effect

**jay?** (8): 💋💣

**rslashpoopheads** (8): i am the fifth rider

**vayyiqra** (8): Yeah I get not liking this song because of its lack of rhythm (or words) but it is an alright interlude and the part near the end is very pretty. It grew on me after Starlit explained it can be interpreted as showing how frustrating it is to try to make a song and be creative.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): was a bit shocked to find out there was not a video where someone recreated this song using sound effects in Mario Maker

**modulum83** (7.5): porter takes on fennesz and OPN and comes out shockingly intact

**DirtyRat583** (7.4): this is literally just hyperpop

#jdskhgjkfhdjkghfjkdghjkfdhgjkfhdgjkfd (derogatory)

**nt96** (7): Title sounds like a Dark Souls weapon

**reput4tionera** (7): is this glitchcore omg

**indie\_fan\_** (6.1): Had to check if Tidal was broken

**Awkward\_King** (6): we cant make fun of anyone else for bleep bloop music when this is here

**jasannn** (6): I remember during the first month I joined the ph discord, I .nped this with the comment “is this hyperpop?” and I got 2 replies same “no it’s camp.” I then proceeded to google “what is camp?” and question myself.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): this is gonna sound fake but my phone is like two years old and lags a lot and i could not for the life of me tell if the song was really like that or if my phone was about to explode

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.5): this song slaps both ways: mostly in a good way but also it's physically assaulting my ears for a bit

**astrologicalangel** (5): this woukd be an excellent way to check if both sides of your headphones were working

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): When I saw Porter live this was the one song from Nurture he did not play. I wasn’t too upset by that.

**imbaby122** (5): pretty synths at the end but not a fan of what it took to get there… trying to keep up with this song hurt my brain

**homestarguy** (4.5): Seems disappointedly half-baked compared to the rest of the album, though the last minute or so if it is kinda pretty.

**seanderlust** (4.5): how do i throw ass to this

**Mudkip1** (4): great sounds, beautiful sounds

**pig-serpent** (4): I will admit it's a cool break from the more pop songs on this album, but also like...

**RoyalBloodFool** (4): The panning tickles my spine so good

**BaconShoes** (3): this one reminded me of trying to start a car and it’s just making noises and i’m not able to start it

**just\_thonking** (2): this does less than nothing for me sorry. At least it sort of builds to something

**ricki** (2): \*looks at watch*

**fadedblue09** (1): More boring than anything remarkable

**plastichaxan** (1): i don’t know why, this sounds like something i should like but… i do not? i don’t think it deserves a 0, there’s something about it i could appreciate, but it made me have a physical reaction to listen so idk it’s just a weird one

**ignitethephoenix** (0): this is not good even if the second half is better

**oscarbrierley1** (0): I get that there is probably some artistic meaning, but this is unlistenable to me. It's just so much, so repetitive and lacking in anything that I would want to return to. To be honest it's so bad it makes me laugh. I joked in an old rate that c2.0 gave me a migraine, but this genuinely gave me a headache.

**shhhneak** (0): this is literally Blessed Madonna

**Uberpigeon** (0): he didn't lie! this feels like a dull scythe penetrating my skull

Ahhhhh this one being the first CHVRCHES cut? That's so upsetting... it's not my absolute fave on the album but I think it's a super cool direction for them, that cacophony of the chorus instrmentation combined with the bombastic hook works so well for me... but clearly not most people :(

---

#I don't owe you a god damn thing

**IIIHenryIII** (10): saying this is my least favorite track on the album doesn't mean anything

**MassiveThief** (10): Jesus her singing has gotten better. Not that it was ever bad but WOW.

**runaway3212** (10): IVE BEEN SINGING THAT SONG!!! AGAIN!!! im deceased

**sarcasticsobs** (10): favorite instrumentals. that bass

**wavingwolves** (10): ok but imagine chvrches doing a nu metal project...that's what the people WANT.......

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): what's giving me nightmares is remembering this band's last album

**apatel27** (9): Maybe the numetal revival is a good thing

**BaconShoes** (9): “lullabies don’t comfort me” and then having this song right after is kinda perfect

**bespectacIed** (9): slayer

**CrimsonROSET** (9): women of indie rock was last month

**pig-serpent** (9): I got back and forth on thinking this chorus is awkward and cool, so I'm just going to say it's both.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): this one is sort of like violent delights but not quite as good. what a song to be second fiddle to, though!!

**plastichaxan** (8.5): i had dismissed the album by this point when i listened but this is good wow

**shhhneak** (8.5): “too metal for German radio.”

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): fuck this is so good? if this gets day 1 it really WILL be a nightmare

**jman457** (8): the best music of my nightmare

**throwaway-7650** (8): "too metal for German radio" - CHVRCHES' European (UK) label

**bbfan132** (7.5): not my *favorite* but still good!

**jay?** (7): for some reason this reminded me of the time i met a popular tumblr user, went to his house, and all they did was play an old ass resident evil game, smoked weed, and listened pvris the entire time

**reput4tionera** (7): this song is sonically so dramatic

**Stryxen** (7): not really a nightmare, quite a good song actually. I had a dream/nightmare last night that i was revealing a rate and none of the eliminations were uploading when i posted them. i should turn my computer off more often

#Poppy antis in the dark alt pop rate

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): Halsey outsold unfortunately

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i feel bad that we all bullied Chvrches about all their breakup songs that they made only one breakup song on this album, but also its kinda the worst song on the standard album so we kinda did the right thing?

**modulum83** (6.6): music to change your profile pic to a black circle and post "gone. don't call me." to

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): I really don’t exactly know what to think about this one, it’s a decent cut for what it’s worth but it’s definitely less punchy than the rest of the album. Hmm.

**celladonn** (6.5): I feel like I should like this more because I usually love when pop leans into heavier sounds but it's fine

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (6): this sounds like a rejected anime theme

**bluetriangles04** (6): Sadly I think the last portion of this album falters (before the bonus tracks for me) and although it's very much still solid CHVRCHES it also just has a certain forgettable sound.

**frogaranaman** (6): better beat than most the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): there’s nothing particularly wrong with this song but at this point in the album I’m getting kinda tired of songs that sound like this

**imbaby122** (6): i don’t like this song all that much but the bridge is a waking the witch reference so i cant tank the score in good conscious

**nt96** (6): Halsey wishes she could compete

**welcome2thejam** (6): Feels like a betrayal to not highly rate the song that actually feels like the end credits theme to a 2000s horror movie

**WillWorkForSugar** (6): i feel like this would be better if i hadnt just heard 8 chvrches songs before it

**seanderlust** (5.4): something about the chorus' vocal delivery here i really don't like. otherwise it's fine

**rslashpoopheads** (5): this song won't end

**vayyiqra** (5): Alright this isn't Chvrches' fault that I don't care for horror but the horror/nightmare/death theme on every song on this album is really not my thing and I have a feeling I'd like this album a lot more if they had gone with another approach.

**thedoctordances1940** (4.2): i just really don't like this at all, it just feels so devoid of anything interesting

**Leixander** (4): has good parts but i dislike the chorus immensely

**starlitsuns** (4): this just blends from Lullabies into something else, sorta boring in my opinion, not my cup of tea but not offensive either

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Unconvincingly dramatic, much like the Halsey song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): No song in this rate is bad enough to give a 0 to but many this somehow manages to be boring but also kinda annoying at the same time.

**homestarguy** (3): It brings me no pleasure to report this but: Halsey outsold.

**TiltControls** (3): the contrast of the vocals and production is the nightmare

**nicolas** (2.5): this sounds like a bring me the horizon song (derogative)

**2dina3dworld** (0): An agonising listen. The epic buildup is ruined by the two things. First, the vocalist can’t quite emote properly. Second, there’s like two things in the mix and one of them is just a wall of fizzy noise while the other are a bunch of drums working in slow motion.

This 30 second intro track that only exists as part of the album's looping gimmick making it past an actual, normal CHVRCHES song... you have to laugh... it actually is a pleasant listen imo, the bleepbloops that make up Mercurial World are truly giving it their all here, and the loopability and focus on transitions across the album is such a great extra part to it. Obviously it doesn't end up making it very far, but for what it is... I think it did well for itself.

---

#WAKE UP!

**akanewasright** (10): one time I quoted this stuff to a friend near-unprompted and they decided mag bay wasn’t for them

**homestarguy** (10): Alright cool, great album! Short and sweet!

**jay?** (10): 💋💣😍

**Mudkip1** (10): i have to give this a 10. letting it transition seamlessly from the final track into this is genius

**nicolas** (10): deserves day 3

**nt96** (10): I prefer tea but I appreciate your concern

**RandomHypnotica** (10): god this is just such a good fucking concept, and the transition is FLAWLESS

**ricki** (10): interlude solidarity

**sage** (10): if this was longer itd be like top 3 on the albjm

**starlitsuns** (10): this is such a fun little intro to start the album and set the mood for what's to come

**throwaway-7650** (10): wait. maybe we should reveal the rate in reverse order too. wait...

**jman457** (9.3): the perfect beginning for a pop record to dance to the end of the world

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (9): yeah it's only 30 seconds but it's a fun 30 seconds! plus the beginning leads into it and forms a loop which is always cool

**Uberpigeon** (9): we love a little spoken word intro

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): NOWHERE!

**plastichaxan** (8.5): this transitioning into mercurial world makes me want to combat interlude/introphobia

**fadedblue09** (8): very fun

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Kero Kero Bonito should sue

**ImADudeDuh** (8): its cute tbh

**imbaby122** (8): on its own it’s a cute existential ditty but that transition is otherworldly

**just\_thonking** (8): I love how the album loops

**seanderlust** (8): thank you mag bay! that didn't help at all.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): not really a song, but just so cute and whimsical. plus the transition to the title track, i mean 😳

**vayyiqra** (8): This is kind of fake-deep but also catchy, so whatever [note: that also applies to this whole album I guess].

**BaconShoes** (7.5): it’s cute how this works when you loop the album and stuff but it’s not a spectacular standalone song

**bbfan132** (7.5): v pretty intro!

**fairytalehigh** (7.5): don't you think how it's funny how the beginning is "the end"?

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): it’s cute !

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): existential and cute

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): yeah it's not much but i still really like it as an intro

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): No it doesn’t help me sleep at night and neither does this album because it’s difficult to fall asleep to bops.

**celladonn** (7): I always get KKB vibes from this

**IIIHenryIII** (7): outsold that black eyed peas song featuring JLo and Mick Jagger

**reput4tionera** (7): honestly for a 30 second opener it slayed

**modulum83** (6.7): welp, that's the end i guess. time to move on to the next album

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): it’s just an intro but the fact it loops is cool I guess

**apatel27** (6): It's a cute transition

**bespectacIed** (6): cringecore but weirdly works

**frogaranaman** (6): silly Magdalena Bay, this is the start!

**qazz23** (6): i wonder why the end is at the beginning (original comment lololol)

**skargardin** (6): I really like how it ties back to "The Beginning", or should it rather be how "The Beginning" ties back to "The End"?, much to think about. Cute little intro

**welcome2thejam** (6): Mica coming into your bedroom like https://imgur.com/a/wp70wkp

#I-N-T-E-R-L-U-D-E-P-H-O-B-I-A

**starla\_** (5.5): not much to say about this

**indie\_fan\_** (5): It’s a 30 second intro, tf you want me to say 😐

**MassiveThief** (5): MCR did this better on The Black Parade

**oscarbrierley1** (5): cute opening, but I never listen to it on its own

**static\_int\_husp** (5): interludephobia

**TheQueenofVultures** (5): Its an intro...

**TiltControls** (5): wait a sec

**wavingwolves** (5): cute and serves its purpose well enough but the best part of it is when it ends and transitions into the next song

**CrimsonROSET** (4): well what the fuck was phoebe bridgers smoking then

**pig-serpent** (4): It's a cute intro but I've always felt it's too KKB.  It makes people's first impression of the album "this is going to be a shameless KKB knockoff" which is inaccurate, and it's a disservice to the album.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): wow i can’t believe the album’s over already!

**notchickeninspanish** (3): The lyrics are giving back of a Dr. Bronner's bottle.

**rslashpoopheads** (3): introphobia

**shhhneak** (2.5): Beginning with ‘The End.’ It’s giving “let them talk.”

**runaway3212** (2): end me

**cremeebrulee** (0): ok i have to be a hater here BUT i think the loop from the last track is gimmicky and that whole “…what's the end anyway?” line is so corny. this needs to leave first i’m not sorry about it

**exciting\_patient4872** (0): A very underwhelming album opener. Also a very easy zero magnet.

This is such a lame closer for the album... it's probably the most guitar-driven song on the album, but they don't really make use of them at all. It's a weak instrumental accompanying a song that feels like it's building up to something only for it to end. I didn't score it negatively because I think it's like, fine to listen to, but it's the weakest on the album imo and I'd personally put it below Nightmares.

---

#You should, actually

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this is such a perfect outro for this album. It ends the emotional journey so majestically.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): some lines in this are just too relatable

**throwaway-7650** (10): if this goes out b4 HSSS I'm going to become the joker

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): their opening and closing tracks are always perfectly chosen. that last "i won't follow you... again" gives me chills, it's heart-wrenching

**homestarguy** (9): Guitar CHVRCHES sticking the landing on this album. What a sweet song.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): the fact that this is how a chvrches song sounds will always impress me. Plus the actual lyrical content is great

**RandomHypnotica** (9): this being the final track of the standard album reminds me a lot of Don't Ask ending the deluxe version of I Disagree

**reput4tionera** (9): we love a guitar ballad closer

**modulum83** (8.6): okay, yeah, i am also lost in nostalgia for my past.

**bbfan132** (8.5): i like the 90s indie rock sound of this, nice outro to the standard version of the album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): A Chvrches song with guitars??? Not sure how to handle this.

**wavingwolves** (8.5): a good closer argue with the wall

**jman457** (8.3): a good little end to the standard edition

**jay?** (8): 💋💣

**pig-serpent** (8): A nice way to ramp down the album.

#[softly] Don't.

**runaway3212** (8): nice but a bit forgettable

**BaconShoes** (7.5): kinda boring compared to everything else on the album, but still decent

**imbaby122** (7.5): usually i don’t like songs that kinda go nowhere but this one has the right vibe i suppose

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): then don't bitch!

**TiltControls** (7.5): there are some nice parts here (especially with the production omg), I just wish there was a bit more flair to the vocals cause it blends with the rest of the album

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Not a bad ending, just not as stellar as the rest.

**apatel27** (7): Guitars were a choice but I like it

**CrimsonROSET** (7): you know if this came out in like 2013 there’d be infinite ukelele covers of this

**fairytalehigh** (7): not "bad" per se but as the end to the standard edition, it's completely anticlimactic after the cathartic rager of "nightmares." also just the weakest track on the album in general

**bigbigbee** (6): I get why they picked a song like this to finish off the album (non-deluxe) - it feels like a more somber, low-key version of their signature sound (listen to the beat specifically for where I’m hearing this), but I personally don’t love this – I don’t think the melody is very nice and that’s what I think they excel at

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): appreciate the guitar work on this one

**starlitsuns** (6): this feels sonically different than the rest of the standard album but I think it fits as the closer, still not my cup of tea though, but I like it

**vayyiqra** (6): This track works better as a closer to the album because it's not quite as dark as the rest of the album although the clumsiness of the lyrics is still here but it's bearable.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): wasn’t this album supposed to be horror themed

**frogaranaman** (5): kind of just there

**nt96** (4): me when someone asks if they should give this a good score

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): this is bad i just feel bad abt how negative my scores have been

**you2009** (1): I don't know why this very not electronic pop song is in an allegedly electronic pop rate but it doesn't help that it's not very good either

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (0): I don't like this at all. it feels really underdeveloped and the drum beat makes it move really awkwardly. plus as the closer to the standard edition, it's REALLY unsatisfying.

**qazz23** (0): weakest track here, too slow and it just feels much longer than it is

#Screen Violence You Can't Sweat Out

**welcome2thejam** (5): If I attend this rate reveal and see one second of Brendon Urie I'm gonna lose my mind

This is pretty controversial and it's easy to see why... the vocal effect on Mica's voice is probably one of the most experimental moments of the album, and for a lot it doesn't quite stick the landing. I think it sounds kinda cool but I don't come back to this song much bc it's like... was it really necessary?

#Followers

**nicolas** (10): i will join your cult, mica tenenbaum

**RandomHypnotica** (10): those crunchy vocals make me ASCEND and that ending literally gives me such fucking chills it might be my favourite moment on the album

**reput4tionera** (10): somehow this was the song that convinced me to be a magdalena bayinator

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): feels otherworldly

**bbfan132** (9.5): this was awesome to watch live, the visuals fit the song perfectly

**fairytalehigh** (9.4): one of my favorites on the album, the psychedelic vocal effects + that monster bass really does it for me

**cremeebrulee** (9.3): a running theme with this rate seems to be that i really, really like songs that sound like they’re inducting me into a cult

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (9): whatever cult this is advertising sign me up

**bluetriangles04** (9): The instrumental for this one is so atmospheric and the chorus is its own little hypnotic section.

**DirtyRat583** (9): the bass in this song reaching deep into a soul i didnt even know i had

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): the vocal effect is not my favorite but i love a sort of psychologically disturbing pop song so as you can imagine i'm conflicted

**thedoctordances1940** (8.9): this song kinda sucks like the production is far too washed out even for this album's standards but also like that chorus is amazing and the melodies are amazing so i can't help but love it

**apatel27** (8): Really like how they layered this one

**BaconShoes** (8): seeing this live made me like it more

**imbaby122** (8): the way the vocals r processed scratches an itch in my brain especially when they’re isolated in the outro… i could listen to it on loop tbh

**jay?** (8): 💋💣

**modulum83** (8): haunted 2000s console game vibes

**rslashpoopheads** (8): you're so right, it's nap time

**skargardin** (8): but this isn't the Vocaloid rate??

**Stryxen** (8): "you took the bait" me sparking discourse when i send a fake 0 to the discord rates channel

**vayyiqra** (8): How did they get this bass to be this heavy I want to know the production tricks here because this is sludgy in the best possible way. It's the "When the Levee Breaks" of synthpop. Yes I really just said that.

**you2009** (8): mica tenenbaum U will never be hatsune miku

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): you heard them, follow your leader, Lord with an E

**starlitsuns** (7.5): this loses at least a point for the vocoder being so badly produced but otherwise Fantano had no reason claiming this was the worst track on Mercurial World

#Do the NSMPG rate

**sage** (7.2): if vocals were normal this would be great

**celladonn** (7): Their vocaloid moment

**plastichaxan** (7): camp

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): I love the synths and the outro, but it feels more like a mood piece than a fleshed out song

**TiltControls** (7): are my headphones are only half plugged in

**welcome2thejam** (7): Carly in the previous song, now Hatsune Miku, she's trying to pull off all the pop queens

**jman457** (6.7): the production was good, but I didnt like the overly autotuned

**jasannn** (6.5): the production is great but the vocal effects do get a little tiring and it doesn’t really go anywhere

**starla\_** (6.5): good but kinda forgettable

**astrologicalangel** (6): the computer voice is cool but the rest of the song is kinda boring

**frogaranaman** (6): cult members be like

**ignitethephoenix** (6): probably the biggest dud on the album for me. Sonically it’s the most annoying and doesn’t add much

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.5): Can someone PLEASE enlighten me on what this song even means, with the stupid Alice in Wonderland references and shit PLEASE I am BEGGING you

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): the image of mica ominously standing there with a bunny mask is burned into my brain

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): I respect this song but I am indifferent to the sound of it.

**homestarguy** (5.5): Definitely the most underwhelming track for me. Still a better CHVRCHES song than some of Screen Violence tbh.

**runaway3212** (5): this sucked at first but the second half kinda slayed. This album can't relate

**static\_int\_husp** (5): I'm trying to stay awake but ur not helping

**WillWorkForSugar** (5): the doldrums of the album

**pig-serpent** (4): Mostly boring song, but I really, really like that vocoder.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): This is their way of saying we should give our 11s to “Follow The White Rabbit” from Madison Beer’s ~~smash~~ ~~hit~~ album *Life Support* in [The Not-So-Main-Pop Girls Rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/v3c4th/notso_main_pop_girls_rate_ava_max_madison_beer/), which is accepting ballots now.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): honestly i have this on in the background a lot when i have spotify low while browsing online but listening to it specifically kinda boring but worse than Prophecy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): the vocals in this have the same exact quality as this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjmIz11a4NY

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): deservedly the least-streamed song on the album. ha!

**wavingwolves** (2): madison beer won this time around...

**CrimsonROSET** (0): oh absolutely not. I’ve done my best to not comment on

**seanderlust** (0): sorry this one literally gives me a headache. I think it's the tinny, robotic voice that is super high-pitched

Probably the weakest track on the album for me? It really just doesn't stand out in any way, and gets lost in the weaker back-half of Mercurial World. Seeing it among the album's lowest here is no surprise, though maybe with how expected a magbay domination was, seeing them lose 4 tracks already might be? I can't say it's not deserved, though.

#Not filler

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): “Fantasy” is a big theme amongst the albums in this rate, something I’m always a big fan of, and I think this track nails it in my favorite way. It’s like a dream come to life, creating another world through lush, indulgent synths and shamelessly romantic lyrics. It’s probably the most “pillowy” song in the rate, both in terms of sonics and subject matter, and boy is it comfortable to listen to. Also I really love how the prechorus has this subtle “call and response” aspect to it, that’s a neat touch that contributes to the sort of out-of-body vibe of the track. I was obsessed with this song when *Mercurial World* and after listening to everything again it still stands head and shoulders above the crowd.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): She’s so real.

**jay?** (10): 💋💣😍

**static\_int\_husp** (10): giving this a 10 b/c I'm in love and this is exactly how it feels to me

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): the strings i mean look at the material! very different for them but so hypnotic and beautiful

**Awkward\_King** (9): idk how but the chorus of this really vividly feels 90s to me, like the melody is mariah esque

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is so lush and dreamy

**qazz23** (9): has a '90s-ish r&b ballad feel to it

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): this song makes me want to go frolicking naked in a field

**jman457** (8.6): This feels so lush

**sarcasticsobs** (8.6): always a fan of video game sounds popping up

**BaconShoes** (8.5): i love the little bubbly noises

**homestarguy** (8.5): Sure, just make a great late-90s RnB track why don’t you!

**imbaby122** (8.5): mmmmm the buildup into the chorus and then the release… so satisfy. so calming. so enchanting.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): i love when rates get me into one of the deep cuts i had ignored all this time

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): I wanna take a relaxing bubble bath to this song

**nicolas** (8.3): ARE WE ALONE 😭 ARE WE IN LOVE AGAIN? 😭 WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? 😭 HYSTERICAL US 😭 SUCKING IN OXYGEN 😭 REMEMBER WHEN WE COULD SLEEP? 😭 I CAN’T SEEM TO SHAKE IT 😭 THE FEELING THAT I’M BREAKING 😭 JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING I COULD BELIEVE 😭

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Weird that this kinda bumps tbh tbh

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (8): this is really sweet but it's a tiny step down from the rest of the album, either that or my balladphobia is showing

**bbfan132** (8): not the most interesting song but i like the dreamy production

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i see why people didn’t like this but sometimes I like more slowed down bops!

**TiltControls** (8): is this a 'hero's journey' prophecy or more towards 'greek tragedy?'

#The prophecy is that this song is a day 1 cut

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): maybe the only song I would skip on the album, it honestly sounds little like it would be on positions, it's ok but fails to grab me

**celladonn** (7.5): Very dreamy

**frogaranaman** (7): genies be like

**notchickeninspanish** (7): Water drop sound intensifies.

**seanderlust** (7): mag bay can have one (1) ballad as a treat

**SmileAndTears** (7): it's giving but it's not giving enough

**starlitsuns** (7): this is the MW track that does not hold up on relistens. i wish this was not the case as it's the most accessible track.

**throwaway-7650** (7): it's pretty but something feels off, like if KKB tried a power ballad

**starla\_** (6.8): this reminds me of like early 2000s Mandy Moore

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): sounds like something they would play in the background of a sex scene in a Disney Princess movie if they ever had sex

**modulum83** (6.5): this is just a jessie ware song

**Uberpigeon** (6): i forgot this song existed

**thedoctordances1940** (5.4): nothing happens lol

**ImADudeDuh** (5): honestly i have this on in the background a lot when i have spotify low while browsing online but listening to it specifically kinda boring

**jasannn** (5): a massive lull

**rslashpoopheads** (5): snoozer

**skargardin** (5): I fear this is the one skip on the album

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): not the song I need

**cremeebrulee** (4.7): this just feels the auditory version of third wheeling

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): i dont know if this will make sense to anyone else but it sounds like a mariah carey song. but bad

**apatel27** (4): It sounds christmassy

**fadedblue09** (4): I was put off by this initially since I'm not a fan of Mica's vocals (and the R&B-ish vibes magnifies it) but I somehow warmed up to it

**reput4tionera** (4): call me a balladphobe but this song is a STAIN on this album

**akanewasright** (3): I used to have this on my anxiety playlist, but I realized it didn’t calm me down so much as bore me a little

**pig-serpent** (3): I've always found this style of RnB boring.

**wavingwolves** (2.2): even more go_girl_give_us_nothing.jpg

**DefaultPophead** (0): I'm so bored!

**runaway3212** (0): flop song

**sage** (0): sure its inoffensive but it literally feels like it never ends and repeats the same thing over and over

**vayyiqra** (0): Sorry Magbay, but I find this song is just too cheesy and boring. I could handle one or the other, but not both. I really don't like this and think the album would be a lot better off without it. It flows so much better without this song dragging near the end.

This ends up getting a little lost amongst the other bsides in this album. I think it's a good song with good melodies etc but at this point in the album you have to do more to stand out than be a cute bside! We've now cracked the 7.0 average though so we love that.

---

#WIDE AWAKE!

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): I LOVE THIS CHORUS SO MUCH my GODDD “PARALYSEDDDDD AND SPINNING BACKWARDS” KILL ME LIKE THIS PLEASE!!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): my only complaint is about how misleading this title is, I feel like punching somebody when this is playing

**throwaway-7650** (10): The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in **Rates** History

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): it's criminal this sub isn't a CHVRCHES fan club the way it is with Carly/Charli/Taylor and i mean that so so seriously

**welcome2thejam** (10): Think it's Lauren's voice on the chorus that really does it for me

**pig-serpent** (9): This is exactly what I wanted the token lighter song on this album to sound like.

**bbfan132** (8.5): muna if they went synthwave

**imbaby122** (8.5): this song is so relatable except for the lyric “wish i’d reached out to my mother more” because i have to actively fight not to facetime my mom daily

**jay?** (8.5): 💋💣😍

**modulum83** (8.5): love the Blue Nile influence on this

**BaconShoes** (8): doesn’t hit as hard as the other songs, but it’s still great

**bluetriangles04** (8): I really like how this one feels like a movie soundtrack in a way? I don't know exactly how to describe it, it just has this quality to it that I think fits in any 90s inspired movie or film aesthetic.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this was softer but i also like it? It’s giving concrete by poppy

**DefaultPophead** (8): Didn't really like this song but I absolutely loved, loved, loved the chorus so I couldn't give it a lower score.

**reput4tionera** (8): i have given so many 8s

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): "televize the great disaster" - D&D, before releasing Game of Thrones S8

**TiltControls** (8): I love the guitar line on this one

**akanewasright** (7.5): this piano keeps reminding me of this Christian pop song my mom used to play that was the Lord’s Prayer in a pop ballad

**apatel27** (7.5): It's vibes

#sleepy

**fairytalehigh** (7.5): not bad, just not particularly memorable. getting wedged between "good girls" and "nightmares" does it no favors.

**homestarguy** (7.5): Is this Undertale?

**jman457** (7.5): I wish the guitar hit harder

**wavingwolves** (7.1): lauren danganronpa player confirmed

**rslashpoopheads** (6): bawring

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): This is a Chvrches song that was written and produced for sure.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.2): well this does make me fall asleep

**oscarbrierley1** (5): so meh to me.

**Stryxen** (5): put me to sleep so forgot to write a comment

**runaway3212** (4): kinda meh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): yeah this is a lullaby alright

**vayyiqra** (4): Idk okay this is alright I'm trying here but lyrics like "we're better off inside of a screen sometimes" are making it hard.

**Awkward\_King** (1): girl shut up

**frogaranaman** (1): can't even sleep to this

**plastichaxan** (1): a lot of the songs in this album just blend for me, there’s nothing different or exciting happening in most of them, but this, this is just one of those forgettable songs made annoying… the lyrics save this from being a 0 but like…

This song is so cute to me, with the childlike innocence it displays being so fun and pure. But I can totally see how that would come off as more annoying than anything to a lot of people, which is why we are now here with this being Porter's second cut.

---

#Children

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): I really dunno what’s up with this one, it’s just fun and whimsical and childish but not to the point of infancy? It’s just nice.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Outsold the Sound of Music more like the von Flops family.

**DefaultPophead** (10): I feel like I'm running through a field of flowers with the sun shining across my sunscreened skin.

**frogaranaman** (10): Porter earned parental rights to my firstborn with this song

**nt96** (10): When the vibes of Studio Ghibli and Katamari Damacy collide

**RandomHypnotica** (10): invented the major scale what a king

**seanderlust** (10): eat shit julie andrews!!!!!

**homestarguy** (9.5): A cute little banger for Navi the Fairy!

**bespectacIed** (9): love the deliberate childlike innocence, i see the vision

**Leixander** (9): very sweet

**starlitsuns** (9): this is one of the two tracks that i cannot fully give a 10 to on this album. very enjoyable, just not enough going on to make it a 10 but it is also the second to last track on this album that doesn't provoke some sort of emotion from me.

**vayyiqra** (9): Every time I hear this I think "Animal Crossing type beat" (complimentary). Also I find it intriguing how Porter said the sound of the kids playing will be heard as different things and it depends on what your first language is. I hear "wait up".

**wavingwolves** (8.8): kind of ended twice - alcohol free like... whew

**sarcasticsobs** (8.7): really liking the (mainly) instrumentals on this more (i know there’s only been 3 so far, shut up)

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): outsold the Von Flopps

**apatel27** (8): Personally I hear 我要

**bbfan132** (8): :puggofast:

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh we love piano lessons

**jman457** (8): the acoustics in this are really nice

**modulum83** (8): makes me feel like an AI being powered on for the first time

**skargardin** (8): this cute little folktronica moment

**Stryxen** (8): yass-slay-werk-boots-wig-ate-snatch-yass

**throwaway-7650** (8): can we get DE-MI-LO-VA-TO as the shitpost pls 我要!

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): loving the more ambient and atmospheric moments on this album - he's captured a very specific nostalgia in his sound so well

**TiltControls** (7.5): really the only track on the album I'm sort of neutral on. I like it, but compared to everything else it doesn't match up as well

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): it's nice and good and i appreciate it being here as a literally regathering moment but on its own it's nothing amazing

**bluetriangles04** (7): every kid in middle school chorus shaking in their boots during SOLFEGE warmups... FUCK YOU MR. CHRISTOPHER!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Julie Andrew’s shaking

**IIIHenryIII** (7): shut up, Porter, you're saying too much. Ok, this is one of the cleverest songs I've ever heard, and he definitely succeeded at his job

**jay?** (7): i wish this song title ended with la-ti-K

#The Sound of Music (is not this)

**reput4tionera** (7): this kinda drags i won’t lie

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): it’s not ti it’s si

**akanewasright** (6.5): this isn’t an album highlight at all, but I needed to breathe a bit after musician, so thanks Porter

**imbaby122** (6.5): this song sounds like it would be featured on the soundtrack of a game i would play on my nintendo ds in 2009

**celladonn** (6): cute... a little too cute

**fadedblue09** (6): takes a while to get interesting

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): does anyone remember that one SNL sketch where the cast are impersonating artists doing covers of weird songs and Adele covers the theme from Miami Vice and the joke is that there’s no lyrics so she just stands there staring at you while you wait for her to sing, but she never does… yeah

**ImADudeDuh** (6): feels like a music for a montage of little robotic mice having their own society underground

**SmileAndTears** (6): welp. you cant always win, can you?

**cremeebrulee** (5.7): anyone else watch this [anime](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMThlOWIxY2ItYmY3Yy00NjY4LTkyNGEtNjlhYTlkMWI0ODQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1Njg5NTA@._V1_.jpg) as a kid

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): maria rainer outsold

**BaconShoes** (5): Sound of Music outsold i fear

**welcome2thejam** (5): Do you think Porter's lying in the Sound of Music field?

**oscarbrierley1** (4): the instrumental is interesting and quite catchy, but the only lyrics being scales makes me cringe really bad.

**Awkward\_King** (3): dont know how to score i find it pretty but also extremely cringy im conflicted

**Mudkip1** (3): wtf was this dhfhdhs

**rslashpoopheads** (3): do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-no

**runaway3212** (2): sorry I hate this song

**shhhneak** (2): fi-ll-er

This one hurts to see leave so early, but really I didn't expect anything different. Other than probably dullscythe it's the most experimental track on the album, on top of mostly just being instrumental. It has its fans, it even got an 11 assay (shoutout to star), and you can count me among that group. But unfortunately the detractors won and it finds itself as Porter's third song out in day 1.

---

#it's so holy

**starlitsuns** (11): okay. this is going to be a long winded wall of text (mobile reddit users i especially apologise to you for this, hikk i hope that this doesn’t break the spreadsheet holy shit). but when nurture first released in full i felt an instant connection to this track. the six minute length just captures so much, first the single piano note with one hundred different brief samples, just feeling like a long train journey viewed from the windows of the observation car. and then it suddenly stops into a piano solo before we get this beautiful sample of words that consist of “it’s so holy // so i dream of you” over and over again in different variations. (also fun fact: this part almost didn’t make it into the final version of the song, porter’s current-as-i-write-this fiancee rika had to convince him to keep it in there.) and just it’s so peaceful, it’s like a long cry you’ve held in for a while over something probably trivial to other folx but it just means so much to you. but i’m not done here. when i went to nurture live, my concert was held outside and there were lingering effects of a nasty cold front that had started the day before, mostly wind and some rain before the concert. when this track started playing there were some clouds moving through and around the four minute mark after porter had made some vocals it was like an offering to the nature gods because it started raining instantly. i used my shirt i had bought for the concert as a cover and kept dancing, holy fuck it was one of the most beautiful things i have ever experienced. the ten minute live version is really good without the added effect of rain, but i swear it was one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences that just i will always cherish because it made this track my definite 11. honestly when this goes out day 1 i will be very sad because of how much i cherish this track. so yeah, when this rate was announced this was already getting my 11. chaeri, you lose!, dullscythe, asking for a friend, violent delights, and musician, i am so sorry.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i’ve cried to this song what do you want from me

**DefaultPophead** (10): To be fair, I had to give one song on Nurture under 10 so that songs on other albums had a chance to be higher. EDIT: Never mind, couldn't do it. Other songs on other albums don't deserve to be higher. This is a 10. That piano ughhh

**homestarguy** (10): Please don’t tank this one, popheads :( It’s too pretty :)

**IIIHenryIII** (10): it sounds like freedom, like I'm running through roaring fields and there's no reason to stop or that I can't be stopped

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the most haunting breakdown of the year

**reput4tionera** (10): god this song is so pretty… it’ll hurt to see it go out day 1

**runaway3212** (10): more like w11nd tempos

**Stryxen** (10): follow the leader but fun and for the summertime!

**throwaway-7650** (10): need to get back into my piano era and learn wind tempos

**TiltControls** (10): It pains me that I can't also 11 this as it was one of my favourite tracks from last year. The moment the music stops and the vocals kick in... absolutely stellar

**wavingwolves** (10): the way this is by far the best song in this album... let's talk about it...

**welcome2thejam** (10): Gorgeous first half soundscape, and when it drops out to the lone piano? Just wreck me, my dude

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Porter confirmed king of Hyperpop. 100 gecs who?

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): i actually really liked this, i actually wish it was longer! i feel like it was just getting started

**vayyiqra** (9): What exactly is so holy? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter that it has one note repeating over and over either. It's so calming and the story behind how it was made is neat.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.9): porter is a god at just like producing gorgeous sounds and like making the best stuff ever innit

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): it sounds kind of like he's singing "it's so hoe-y"

**jman457** (8.4): a nice experimental little song; i expect this to have a high controversy score

**modulum83** (8.3): bro stop clicking your god damn mouse i'm trying to listen to the song!!

**celladonn** (8): I wouldn't listen to this outside of the context of the album but it is a bit of a slay

**frogaranaman** (8): I can mosh to this

**imbaby122** (8): i should hate this song (over 5 minutes long, hardly any lyrics) but it was surprisingly engaging enough to pull me into its little world

**nt96** (8): Nice to see that Aphex Twin volunteered to pitch in

**Awkward\_King** (7): i am aggressively neutral (relistening note: this kinda fucks like he just smashing that keyboard but go on king)

**bluetriangles04** (7): really beautiful composition here

**ignitethephoenix** (7): second half of this song feels like I just beat the bad guy in Pokémon or Mario (before the voice comes in)

#owowowowowowowow

**seanderlust** (7): the part where the vocals are like "owowowowow" sound like a small cyborg being dragged down some stairs.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Very solemn but the vocals towards the end ruined it for ne

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): this is the sounds my brain makes when i’m going through a mental breakdown

**indie\_fan\_** (6.2): This just a long ass interlude

**jay?** (6): ...it was cute but cute doesnt win rates. Gags do.

**apatel27** (5): Sometimes minimalism isn't the answer

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This starts off really pretty but I could do without the Vocaloid torture(?) at the end

**Gonza\_90** (5): Too slow for my taste

**ImADudeDuh** (5): the top comment on genius.com saying “this is so friggin’ unique” feels like it could be a drag

**rslashpoopheads** (5): cathartic but also I wouldn't listen again <3

**Leixander** (4): nevermind they don't

**Uberpigeon** (4): i just kind of found it boring im sorry porterpottys

**just\_thonking** (3): cannot believe this is six minutes long

**ricki** (3): \*looks at watch*

**oscarbrierley1** (2): it sounds like someone pressing random buttons on top of a meditation soundtrack. It's a no from me.

**shhhneak** (1.8): This made my cat hiss.

**DirtyRat583** (0): the first half is hyperpop without the hyper, like its just erratic sjrfgjdhgd-ing pretty much. the second half doesnt bring much to the table either. this song is 6 minutes long and none of them are good. i get why the album cover is him lying face down because i also want to lie face down after listening to this. no thank you, but i commend u for trying porter

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): This really doesn't go anywhere or do anything I found particularly interesting.

**2dina3dworld** (10): the piano sounds like All My Friends’s piano which sounds like Coconut Mall’s piano

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): All My Friends but make it weeb.

**bespectacIed** (9): tugged on lcds's wig a little bit. the piano solo is literal magic, it's enchanting.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): LCD Soundsystem could never

**bbfan132** (8): sonically, this is gorgeous… also, i love all my friends by lcd soundsystem

**pig-serpent** (7.5): I was going to make an "All My Friends" joke but everybody else was already thinking it.  Instead I'll just say that it gets a little grating by the end.

**jasannn** (7): I got flashbacks to the indieheads exchange rate with that one LCD Sound System song where the keyboard wouldnt shut up but got many users very emotional

**notchickeninspanish** (7): This takes the All My Friends piano riff to its logical extreme.

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (6.5): i love all my friends by lcd soundsystem

**cremeebrulee** (5.3): omg doesn’t this sound like all my frien— [GUNSHOT]

**BaconShoes** (2): This started like All My Friends by LCD Soundsystem except not as good, and then turned into a piano ballad with hyperpop vocals :/

For a song that was a lead single this is quite the underperformance, but when you actually listen to it it's not really surprising at all. I've come to enjoy it quite a bit, but it really is Love is Dead-core (aka Not Good) with how it manages to be both annoying and boring at the same time for a lot of people. I know that I personally was a little worried for how the album would turn out after this was the first taste of it, but I was happy to be proven wrong. I would not have it this low in the rate, but I definitely don't feel like I'm losing my mind with it being a day 1 cut.

#ashley tisdale

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I never thought Ashley Tisdale's song with the same title could ever be outsold, but they did just that

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): Ashley Tisdale's impact

**plastichaxan** (8.7): she's good but she's no Ashley Tisdale - He Said She Said

**imbaby122** (8): ashley tisdale outsold but this is good too

**wavingwolves** (8): ashley tisdale felt a slight rush of wind when this was released

**you2009** (8): ashley tisdale outsold [137]

**nicolas** (8): pretty good but ashley tisdale still outsold

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): at least it's better than Ashley Tisdale's

**seanderlust** (6.9): Ashley Tisdale outsold

**TiltControls** (6.5): it's no ashley tisdale

**cremeebrulee** (6): obligatory ashley tisdale comment

**skargardin** (6): the one instance where we can all agree on that Ashley Tisdale outsold

**Stryxen** (5): and *I* said ashley tisdale outsold

#He slayed she slayed

**bespectacIed** (10): pro4n4 anthem, lauren edtwt acc reveal when

**DirtyRat583** (10): this vocal melody has popped up in my head sporadically for MONTHS so well done chvrches I guess

**pig-serpent** (10): This song is about gaslighting, so I want to say gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss, but the girlboss is the one being gaslit and there's more manipulation and mansplaining than there is gatekeeping.  But there's no malewife either...  Hmmm.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): contrary to popular opinion I love this song

**apatel27** (9.5): Vintage Chvrches

**bluetriangles04** (9.5): I honestly wasn't a fan of the autotune in the pre-chorus at first, but as soon as I got over that hill this easily become one of my favorites from the album. I really adore this album for the way its able to tie in lyrics about toxic mentalities towards women and also keep the whole darker aspect going at the same time.

**just\_thonking** (9.5): this song doesn't hit until you feel like you're losing your mind, and then it's the best song ever created

**BaconShoes** (9): I FEEL LIKE I’M LOSING MY MIND

**bbfan132** (9): i remember this being divisive at first but i love how maximalist it is

**fairytalehigh** (9): "boys will be boys" found dead in a ditch

**modulum83** (9): kill all men so true

**notchickeninspanish** (9): The production reads as very 'this is supposed to be the lead single' but I love it in spite of that.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): saw lots of slander regarding this one but i get it so maybe it's a you problem idk

**Gonza\_90** (8.8): This song is better in the context of the album

**akanewasright** (8.3): I literally never remember any other part of this song but “I FEEL LIKE I’M LOSING MY MIND” is that powerful

**jman457** (8.2): solid synthpop tune

**jay?** (8): never ask a woman her age and never ask an indie artist why their parents names are blue on wikipedia

**reput4tionera** (8): this song rly reminds me of miracle but like if it was yassified

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Can’t help but roll eyes at some of the lyrics but it’s a killer chorus and kind of a banger still, so /shrug

**fadedblue09** (7.5): This is really catchy, even if a bit repetitive

**CrimsonROSET** (7): but what do YOU say

**runaway3212** (7): okay I guess

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): chorus slaps

#he flopped she flopped

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I don’t love the sound of this but I sympathize with hating mean people with insane expectations.

**Leixander** (6): sounds like one of the mid songs on their previous album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this sounds like it could be a eurovision entry for norway. i will not elaborate

**homestarguy** (5.5): Classic CHVRCHES sound, but I just never really vibed with this one even if the lyrics are very personal.

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (5): this just sounds like a generic edm song

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): wow that sucks girl

**oscarbrierley1** (5): sounds really dated to me, like 2016/17 vibes

**throwaway-7650** (5): their partner in crime - lucy dacus if you think about it tbh

**welcome2thejam** (5): Perfectly fine content, but some of these synths are non-nutritious and I'm meh on the repetitive chorus

**Awkward\_King** (3): i know she's scottish but why does she have to be so scottish about it

**MassiveThief** (3): Liked this when it came out but it's just soured on me. Feels like they tried way to hard be super trendy

**vayyiqra** (3): These lyrics are not good Lauren I am so sorry. I get you are trying to say something meaningful here but do not think this song is a good way of doing it.

**frogaranaman** (0): Fuck you Sirius XMU.

This one's super sweet, but I get why people don't vibe with it much. It's the most acoustic moment on the album and much more low-key than the bombast a lot of the other songs go for, it kind of sticks out in a way that for a lot of people isn't really good. I still like it decently but it's definitely lower tier on the album for me so I can't say I'm crying over its loss here.

#🥺

**akanewasright** (10): The moments where Porter stops the vocal manipulation on this album are so 🥺

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): At first I wasn’t a big fan of this song because I missed the bleeps and bloops…but it’s so damn pretty. Plus, thematically and aesthetically it fits perfectly on the album.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i have too many songs about crying in this album maybe my therapist isnt getting paid enough

**DefaultPophead** (10): This has got to be the most romantic song ever written. I'm so sad and touched and really really happy.

**frogaranaman** (10): this is a potential wedding song

**sage** (10): i cried each one of the first 50 or so times i heard this

**seanderlust** (10): ha-ha! porter has a crush on his girlfriend!!! (points and laughs)

**starlitsuns** (10): i have cried to this so many times. it opens so many emotions and also i am a hopeless romantic so it just makes it worse. fuck i wish i was in love.

**throwaway-7650** (10): the guitar-driven songs in this rate are good idk what to tell y'all.

**vayyiqra** (10): This is one of his prettiest songs and this line really hits: ""Don't think of the time that's left/You're spending it in your head" since I've spent two years feeling like I'm wasting my life, sitting all day doing nothing and yeah [gif of Andy Samberg saying "Alright, I'm gonna go cry"]

**wavingwolves** (10): 🥺

**you2009** (10): acousticphobia you are nothing

**TiltControls** (9.5): Like Sweet Time I like how restrained this is compared to the rest of the album. perfect wind-down after the other tracks

**bespectacIed** (9): tears were shed

**celladonn** (9): the way the pitch shifting drops out for "it's just that i love you" gets me every time

**homestarguy** (9): Porter got the whole homestarguy cryin’

**jasannn** (9): sad nostalgia :c

**pig-serpent** (9): Such a beautiful acoustic song.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): the moment when the vocal filter fades away so he can say "it's just that i love you"... that was history

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): man he really said y'all bitches gonna cry today

**jay?** (8.5): 💋💣😍

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): i like this song it is very cute and i can very easily see it being a 10 or people's 11s even but not really for me

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (8): do not rob this do not rob this do not rob this do not rob this do not-

**bluetriangles04** (8): coming after a song called "Something Comforting", this takes the cake for that concept lol. I feel like this should have been the last song on the album, no?

**imbaby122** (8): i’m so 😭 happy for you 😭 porter 😭 congrats on having a loving relationship i guess 😭😭😭

**reput4tionera** (8): i love ballads with heavy vocal processing… it’s so specific but they’re so good

**Stryxen** (8): screaming crying sliding with my back on the wall

**BaconShoes** (7.5): this was pleasant

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Sounds like something from *Adventure Time* but you know what, maybe that’s a good thing

**ricki** (7): adventure time music

#balladphobia

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): I don’t really like the stripped down instrumentation all that much

**jman457** (6.8): kind of cute

**apatel27** (6.5): It's cute and the piano guitar is neat

**runaway3212** (6.5): okay but what if phoebe did a cover of this I would be killed

**bbfan132** (6): kind of boring to me but it’s not *bad*

**IIIHenryIII** (6): it totally fits as the album closer, but it's not that good

**oscarbrierley1** (6): it gives background music, it's fine, but I don't really remember much after i listen to it.

**modulum83** (5.3): wife guy alert

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): I love a good love song but Porter’s are just such snoozers I’m sorry (part 2, electric boogaloo)

**cremeebrulee** (5): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FL6NmutXEAUdeRy.jpg

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i feel bad shitting on this one because it’s clearly very personal for porter but its also just kinda boring!!

**fadedblue09** (3): Idk I'm all for having a pensive moment but this feels hollow and unearned

**rslashpoopheads** (1): this is the exact moment in the playlist where I fell asleep

**Awkward\_King** (0): corny ass indie girl ballad ass song ass flop

Classic CHVRCHES through and through, so I do kind of see why this was left off the main album since it's so bright sounding and unabashedly like their older material. But as someone that can't get enough of the formula they've perfected over the years, I'll gladly accept another song in that vein. It's placing at #35 so clearly a lot of y'all don't agree... but this did manage to pick up a couple 11s so shoutout to them.

#SCREAMING CRYING THROWING UP PISSING SHITTING CUMMING

**shhhneak** (11): I’m at peace with probably being the only person to give this an eleven but it just clicks with me. I can’t not scream along with it.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): a serotonin injection through the ears

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the way they just casually released one of their best songs ever in a bonus track???

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): me when i'm in a bop making competition and my opponent is CHVRCHES

**bespectacIed** (9): banger... those irrestible synths

**jay?** (9): waitt gagged me a bit 💋💣😍

**runaway3212** (9): good

**Stryxen** (9): crying pissing sliding down the wall

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): me when im screaming

**TiltControls** (9): aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

**fairytalehigh** (8.6): crying, throwing up, etc.

**wavingwolves** (8.6): girl i'm screaming too!!!!!!!!

**bbfan132** (8.5): this bops

**just\_thonking** (8.5): ummmm misleading much? She is clearly singing here

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): this is just the forever of screen violence (NOT A DRAG BTW)

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): , crying etc.

**warjhybrid** (8.3): My favorite of the "Director's Cut" tracks.

**modulum83** (8.2): oh fuck this is literally just an Every Open Eye song!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): crying throwing up

**reput4tionera** (8): slayed

**starlitsuns** (8): definitely one of the brightest sounds productionwise on this album. I can see why it was cut but I like it

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): crying and shaking too

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i like this bc it sounds different to the last four songs

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Probably the best of the bonus songs, has a new wave tinge to it

**homestarguy** (7.5): Probably my favorite of the Director’s Cut tracks. Fairly catchy verses, meh pre-chorus, nice little call-and-response chorus. It’s nice!

**imbaby122** (7.5): i too no longer see the point in reading, i haven’t read a book for fun in 5 years but when i tell people that they act like i’m clinically braindead

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): relatable queen

#The library is open

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Does it really belong on this record? Feels like it doesn’t, I dunno, good thing they cut it

**apatel27** (7): Needs a little more oomph

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This kinda went in one ear out the other but it sounded nice!

**vayyiqra** (7): This is the song that sounds the closest to an old Chvrches song and I feel like pure shit just want those days back when I loved everything they did.

**BaconShoes** (6.5): i like the chorus, but the rest is kinda meh

**jman457** (6.5): this feels like a bonus track

**Uberpigeon** (6): this is a chvrches song

**skargardin** (5): this is very much a bonus track

**cremeebrulee** (4.3): the way this song could’ve been more interesting if she actually was screaming

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): gays whenever anything happens:

**frogaranaman** (3): "I used to read myself to death" well others will do that for you now!

**Mudkip1** (0): god her voice just isn't good enough to make me enjoy an entire album

This song is exactly that... sweet... I like the melodies on this one a lot, although I get that, along with Blossom, the vibes of it aren't for everyone. It's another slower love song but this one is a little more ... heavy. "Since I met you I don't wanna die no more" like oh......

---

#I don't wanna die no more

**DefaultPophead** (10): I feel loved.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh

**MassiveThief** (10): "I need a next life/'Cause I'm not satisfied to know you just once" is possibly the sweetest line ever written

**starlitsuns** (10): blossom feelings, but it doesn't make me cry 50% of the time so it is blossom lite

**throwaway-7650** (10): isekai anthem (*VOTE FOR THE ANIME RATE* I'm desperate)

**TiltControls** (10): I love how restrained this is in comparison to everything else. Another one of my absolute favourites.

**vayyiqra** (10): It makes me so happy how Porter said this about this song: "Rika and I have been together four years, and honestly it’s really time for me to propose. But I wanted to wait until after the pandemic." And then this year he did. :uwu:

**WillWorkForSugar** (10): this has such such sweet lyrics

**you2009** (10): more lyrics that really hit me. something I struggle with a lot is feeling like the world is too overwhelming. like I'll never be able to exist in peace cos I can't feel things a moderate amount. the line "the world is lucky to be your home" is what made me love this song so much. even if existing can be hard I want to believe I have the right to

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): my god if someone wrote this song about me you bet your ass these panties would drop immediately

**runaway3212** (9.5): ughh I love this album

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9.5): reading the genius explanation for this one actually kicked me in the stomach. porter don't make me cry at the popheads rate :(

**apatel27** (9): Beautiful

**bespectacIed** (9): so beautiful

**imbaby122** (9): if i were only scared of death when i had a life partner then i would live a peaceful life <3 where are all my unloveable girls at!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (8.7): girl, whoever you are, marry him already. If you don't, I will

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): very good song very cute but also kinda one of the weaker ones on this album ou

**seanderlust** (8.3): this is such a sweet ballad! it's interesting that it's glitchy and electronic enough to not really feel much like a ballad even though it very much is

**wavingwolves** (8.3): this is a 1975 song if you really think about it

**bbfan132** (8): pretty song yet again!! i don’t know what to say anymore sorry

**CrimsonROSET** (8): ukelele-core but like am i mad? no

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): LOVE the lyrics to this one but unfortunately the vocals are serving Chainsmokers

**homestarguy** (8): This wasn’t one of my favorites for awhile, but I do appreciate its place on the album as a more chill and contemplative track.

**jay?** (8): 💋💣

**skargardin** (8): the piano is very chefskiss

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): "I'm not just satisfied to know you once" ...

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): *peach voice*

#I'd rather die

**frogaranaman** (7): me at the candy shop

**reput4tionera** (7): this song is very sweet but it’s also kinda boring so

**jman457** (6.6): If this didnt have a m*le voice this would bop more

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.5): doesn't have the same oomph the other songs have

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is pretty but…the time could be sweeter this is just a bit boring.

**modulum83** (6): love the new imagine dragons single

**sarcasticsobs** (6): man i could not get into this one for some reason

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): I love a good love song but Porter’s are just such snoozers I’m sorry

**BaconShoes** (5): I feel like there’s always some constant electronic note being held throughout these songs that makes them sound less dynamic to me or something? Like it’s all kinda blending together and sounding the same despite the songs actually being pretty different :/

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): more like boring time i forgot about this song the second it ended

**pig-serpent** (4): This one has a promising start and overall it's still fine, but it ends up a little disappointing after the cool piano part.

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): ok girl too real

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Sounds a bit….heavy and dark compared to the rest of the album? Really out of place imo

**plastichaxan** (2): sometimes a song that is boring is worse

This is a cute moment, but I think this is about right for it in this rate where there's so many good songs. It's not a skip but when you're between YOU SLAY and SLAEYI that's a lot to live up to... and it doesn't even come close to the highs of those two tracks. Bye flop

---

#more like something for 10

**akanewasright** (10): Okay but this is a highlight once you get the vision… like tell me that two dancers doing a routine to this wouldn’t slay

**bbfan132** (10): so so good

**nicolas** (10): someone is going to be massively unfunny and give this a 2 right

**throwaway-7650** (10): banner me when this placement is Something for (Day) 2

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (9.5): yeah, everything on this album is getting high scores

**plastichaxan** (9.5): underrated and the way it transitions into chaeri come on

**rslashpoopheads** (9.5): 2

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): me submitting niche af rate ideas

**IIIHenryIII** (9): her voice somehow sounds gentler and way softer on this track, how's that even possible? (I know the answer btw)

**just\_thonking** (9): more like something for 9 hahahahahhahahahahahahahah

**vayyiqra** (9): This is one of those "cling-clang sounds" songs we meme about and those aren't always my thing but this is really good.

**welcome2thejam** (9): The perfect comedown after You Lose!

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): the production in this is so rich, i could listen to it over and over

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): I like this song on its own but the way it transitions into Chaeri…it took me there.

**imbaby122** (8.5): synthy and sweet and endearing <3

**MassiveThief** (8.5): I love how genuine the vocal performance is

**jman457** (8.2): Giving this a two would be a little mean but I want to for asthetics reasons

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Even if this song has kind of a dreary beat it still kinda bangs, so am I gonna complain? Yes, but should I? No.

**BaconShoes** (8): a nice little ditty but not as strong as the other album tracks

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I feel like I’ve been sleeping on this one for a bit

**jay?** (8): 💋💣

**pig-serpent** (8): Is it me or did this album just get a huge production boost?

**TiltControls** (8): including low numbers in your title is a dangerous game when it comes to rates

**SmileAndTears** (7.8): cute!

**homestarguy** (7.5): First non-amazing song on the album, but still sonically interesting. Another S-tier transition into “Chaeri.”

#Something for 2 like 2/10 am i right

**modulum83** (7.3): literally who are you. where is chaeri

**skargardin** (7): This is cute, really unfortunately sandwiched between two of the album's greatest highlights, which leads to me often forgetting that it even exists. I do like how they start to tease the transition to "Chaeri" throughout the song though it's such a cool element.

**Stryxen** (7): i love the lyrics on this, mica sounds emotionally restrained... but also quite vocally strained!

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): i do like the more rhythmic sound but it's just not quite as interesting as some of the others on the album

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i’m sorry but this just sounds really bland, especially in comparison for what we heard so far- some bleep bloops in the bridge won’t save you mary lagoon!

**reput4tionera** (6): ok this ones kinda zzz

**runaway3212** (6): more like something for 6! hate gottem

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): it sounds like it would be filler on 1989

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): the weakest track on here, the transition is cool

**frogaranaman** (5): idk go to a restaurant?

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): wait is this “She Used To Be Mine” from *Waitress*

**ImADudeDuh** (4): more like something for **4**

**notchickeninspanish** (4): I think songs like this one on the album show the vast difference between the quality of the production and the songwriting.

**wavingwolves** (4): any song would suffer from being put right after the SOTC (slay of the century) but this one surely suffers from a lot more than just it for being so dull

**apatel27** (3): Nothing of value here

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): shake some ass or sumt

**fadedblue09** (2): sorry but the avocadies voice gets super grating here

While Better If You Don't is a weak closer for Screen Violence's standard edition, Killer kicks off a really strong 3-track run for the deluxe edition. This track is very edgy in its lyrics and sound which suits the album and this song's title quite well. That synth in the chorus is just so ominous and ear-tickling, I think this is definitely better than some of the standard edition tracks.

#Entertained!

**fairytalehigh** (10): yasssss bitch i am entertained

**IIIHenryIII** (10): we all know the director's cut is always better than the theatrical release

**MassiveThief** (10): we love a pulsating dance beat

**skargardin** (10): this has some of the ominosity i wish was part of the album

**throwaway-7650** (10): if this goes out day 1 I'm going to become the ~~joker~~ **ki11er**

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): "are you entertained?" yea

**wavingwolves** (10): why was this jennifer's body soundtrack released 10 years too late

**seanderlust** (9.5): ooooooooh the transition to the chorus with the heavy synths is cool.

**shhhneak** (9.5): Kind of wish more songs had the electronic reverb on the vocals, especially with the electronic motif of the lyrics.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): killer track badumtss

**b\\_o\\_g\\_o\\_** (9): this is really good! idk why they cut this it's better than almost all of the standard edition

**jay?** (9): 💋💣😍

**Leixander** (9): i am thoroughly entertained

**reput4tionera** (9): c’mon autotune!!!!

**rslashpoopheads** (9): me when I see the 500th news headline about Elon Musk in a week

**imbaby122** (8.5): “i lost myself, my mental health, on a broken carousel” is about me at my place of employment (a carousel museum)

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): You put a pulsating beat under a synthpop song you have a recipe for success

**BaconShoes** (8): a bop

**bbfan132** (8): nice bonus track!! lazy comment, i know

**bluetriangles04** (8): "I TURN INTO A KILLER" me having my joker moment when my 11 leaves on day 1

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zHAlWEHrFcA

**jman457** (7.5): nice little tune

**akanewasright** (7): kirbystrut

**TiltControls** (7): they really went hard on the 80s horror vibe for this album huh

#Welcome to my twisted mind

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): like I see why people like this, I definitely don't think it's bad by any means but it just leaves me a bit unsatisfied ultimately

**apatel27** (6): Fairly basic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Is this the person who killed all the Final Girl’s friends?

**CrimsonROSET** (6): she’s DA JOKER BABY

**modulum83** (6): ugh this sounds like a 2000s teen movie soundtrack

**Uberpigeon** (6): gachalifecore

**vayyiqra** (6): These lyrics are so bad but this song is okay but also I just realized this whole album is just like Closer to Grey by Chromatics, which came out first and I didn't like that much either so that should've been foreshadowing.

**welcome2thejam** (6): Lauren goes full Joker

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Devoid of any conviction

**frogaranaman** (5): this is the weakest sounding murderer I've heard. who are you killing? ants?

**homestarguy** (5): It’s fine. Some good replacement-level CHVRCHES anthemic synths in the chorus, that’s about it.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): the only song on the album that I can say i don’t care for. It feels a little too heavy handed for the album and I wouldn’t mind if it just stayed off the album and leaked like 4 months later.

**Stryxen** (5): me accidentally clicking off survivor on dead by daylight

**notchickeninspanish** (4): Literally none of these deluxe edition tracks are worth it. :(

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Me after being welcomed to her twisted mind: damn bitch, you live like this?

**2dina3dworld** (1): I’m a twisted fucking cycle path

A much better closer to the album than the one on the standard edition imo. Despite being better, it sadly doesn't manage to escape day 1. In fact, it finds itself as the bitter end of day 1. CHVRCHES fans definitely will be bitter after seeing these results I fear - I know I am...

---

#Bittersweet

**bespectacIed** (10): too good of a bawp to not have been on the standard ver, could've been the prfect closer

**IIIHenryIII** (10): these bonus tracks came to cure the depression we get in when listening to the album; they knew it

**Leixander** (10): amazing closer

**shhhneak** (10): The universe where this is the promotional single for a BioShock movie >>>>>

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): THATS WHAT WE’VE BEEN WAITING FOR!! ITS WHAT WE WANTED ALL ALONG!!!

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): how did this not make it to the initial album?

**throwaway-7650** (10): probably CHVRCHES antis who finished the rate in ballot order

**imbaby122** (9.5): excessive autotune makes everything sound better when will the general public accept this

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): After listening to Mercurial World, I guess I gotta agree that nothing really ends

**apatel27** (9): Gotta love a bit of Drum and Bass

**Awkward\_King** (9): ok dnb yass

**bluetriangles04** (9): I think this is a better end (pun not intended) to the entire album. After a multitude of songs about negative experiences painted in a horror film-like medium, ending on a semi high note with a song talking about, after all of the prior experiences, seeking happiness and pleasure even until the bitter end just works well.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): i don't *love* the verses on this one but CHVRCHES have never made a chorus that didn't destabilize minor nation-states

**celladonn** (8.5): that chorus is explosive and I love songs that mention the singer's experiences at various ages

**rslashpoopheads** (8): bitter that this album ended!

**TiltControls** (8): It's not bitter, this is great!

#just bitter

**fairytalehigh** (7.9): sorta bizarre that both the standard and deluxe editions do not stick the landing. this one has a better chorus though

**thedoctordances1940** (7.7): placebo outsold

**wavingwolves** (7.5): this is a good title for a last song actually but better if you don't outslayed

**jman457** (7.2): Dragged a bit but it was fun

**BaconShoes** (7): bonus track for a reason

**bbfan132** (7): this is fine but probably my least favorite of all the tracks by them in this rate, it makes sense for it to be a bonus track

**CrimsonROSET** (7): a bitter end to the album in my opinion but i like the guitars!

**jay?** (7): 💋💣

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Okay I think I’ve pinned down my problem with this song and kinda the other songs on the album, there’s just so much empty space in the vocal line? Like why do they write melodies that pause and stutter like this, why does she let her voice drop out at the end of every line? I would like it more of the vocals were sustained because it would give the songs more drive.

**homestarguy** (6): I like the sound of this one, but again it’s just another meh/fine track. Definitely better than a couple songs on the actual album I guess.

**MassiveThief** (6): It's fine, but I kind of wish this album had a more epic/thematic finish. Like it's called 'Bitter End' but didn't sound like a closing track.

**reput4tionera** (6): the chorus is kind of the only good part

**Uberpigeon** (6): bitter end... girl i wish this album would end

**modulum83** (5.7): oh fuck this is literally just a Love Is Dead song :/

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): They’re bitter because of how these rate results are gonna turn out.

**starlitsuns** (5): this wasn't bad but the vocal production feels off. if it wasn't so distorted I'd probably like it more

**vayyiqra** (5): Idk okay I'm so tired it's 4:30 in the morning I never thought I'd say this but I almost don't want to hear a synth again for a little while after this. I'm just glad I'm done and don't have to bully Chvrches anymore because I swear they are really one of my favourite bands outside of this album Chvrches my poor little meow meow I am so sorry

**runaway3212** (4): Boring End

**frogaranaman** (3): apt descriptor for this album
