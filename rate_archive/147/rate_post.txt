Hello to all ONE MILLION of you popheads reading this! I'm one of your rate hosts for the month of May (again) and welcome to the **[2021 Electronic Pop Rate](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/551989842636963841/967313280660029510/2021ep.png)**! This subreddit has always been built upon an appreciation for bleepbloop electro/synth-pop so what better way to celebrate than to do a rate full of that!!! Let's take a look at the albums in question that we will be rating:


---

#MAGDALENA BAY – MERCURIAL WORLD
From humble beginnings with their various EP releases, including the acclaimed *A Little Rhythm and a Wicked Feeling* that we rated last year, Magdalena Bay really took the internet music world by storm with the release of *Mercurial World*. It’s made up of sprawling synthwork which lays ground for the angelic vocal performances - with synth-pop bliss being its base such as in the fan favourite “Secrets (Your Fire)”, but also having the occasional foray into more experimental sounds like the fuzzy, shoegaze-inflected “You Lose!”. It’s no surprise that *Mercurial World* ranked highly among many terminally online audiences, both r/popheads gays and RateYourMusic nerds alike. It was this subreddit’s #1 favourite album of 2021, but how will it fare in a rate setting?

1. The End
2. Mercurial World
3. Dawning of the Season

#PORTER ROBINSON - NURTURE
After a lengthy break left fans waiting with bated breath for years, electronic producer Porter Robinson took on a brand new direction with his sophomore album *Nurture*. He opted to do all of the vocals himself and put the majority of the album’s focus on being unabashed pop music, displayed clearly in tracks like the anthemic “Look at the Sky”. This decision allowed him to extend the reach of his audience, but none of the masterful production work was left behind as a compromise, as we can see in instrumental moments like the stunning “Wind Tempos”. Though perhaps not as well-established as an r/popheads fave in comparison with the other acts here, the album has its staunch defenders and managed to worm its way into both the top 25 albums of 2021 as well as onto the top 100 songs of the year list. It’ll certainly be interesting to see what happens to it here!

1. Lifelike
2. [Look at the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJBh_hj6DzE)
3. [Get Your Wish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SZEDBFPpgw)

#CHVRCHES – SCREEN VIOLENCE
About a decade ago, the debut of CHVRCHES saw the bleepbloop dance music of the time meld brilliantly with indie and more artful sensibilities. Through this they garnered a sizeable fanbase, but with 2018’s *Love is Dead* there was a bit of a stumble. The attempt at Imagine Dragons-esque radio success was not really a hit with fans, but thankfully *Screen Violence* brought back their immaculate quality while also branching out their sound to new areas. Keeping the abundance of synths but scratching off some of their signature sheen to reveal darkness while also incorporating rock sounds allowed them to explore a new, dynamic soundscape, and it might just be their best work yet. “How Not to Drown” is a collaboration with the legendary Robert Smith and has a gothic rock edge, while other songs like “Good Girls” hold onto the remnants of that brighter synth sound that all CHVRCHES fans have come to love. It placed in the top 10 of r/popheads’ album of the year list and proved to be a very welcome return to form, so I’m incredibly happy we’re getting to rate it.

1. Asking for a Friend
2. [He Said She Said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyyiJc0Wk2M)
3. California
4. Violent Delights
5. [How Not to Drown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U_LhzgwJ4U)
6. Final Girl
7. [Good Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du4kNAyjVCg)
8. Lullabies
9. Nightmares
10. Better If You Don't
11. Killer
12. Screaming
13. Bitter End

#KERO KERO BONITO - CIVILISATION
A new challenger approaches?!?!? If you recall the announcement post for this cycle’s rates back in January, you may remember that the only albums involved were the three listed above, but after the realization that Kero Kero Bonito’s compilation release for their *Civilisation* EPs would fit perfectly in this rate, and conducting a poll among the Daily Discussion readers and the popheads discord server, it was decided that they would be added here! After exploring the world of indie and noise pop in 2018’s *Time’n’ Place*, the group would return to their quirky electronic sound that they were initially known for across the releases of two *Civilisation* EPs while still keeping their indie flair. “The Princess and the Clock” is an immaculate electropop song that manages to tell a story in its lyrics, while moments like “Well Rested” forego the restraints of a typical pop song to create a 7 minute long fan favourite track. Both of these made it very high on our top 100 songs list from last year, and I’m truly so glad that despite not originally considering it for this rate, we managed to squeeze it in and give it a shot. 

1. Battle Lines
2. [When The Fires Come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEAuoJRVgE8)
3. The River
4. Gateway
5. [The Princess and the Clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncBPcx4RdbE)
6. [21/04/20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBBtYirVN_Y)
7. Well Rested

* **Comments are encouraged! (but not required)** and can be added to any song by simply typing after inserting your score, like so:

        Well Rested: 10 me after taking a nap

 * You may also leave comments for albums in the same way, by typing after the album title where it says "ALBUM:"

* **DO NOT SABOTAGE!!!** Rates are much more fun with truthful and honest scoring. Obviously you are allowed to dislike certain songs/albums, but in order to ensure a good time for everyone involved it is very much appreciated that if you're giving incredibly low scores you justify them with comments explaining why. If an artist/album average is very low without justification, I may ask you to reassess your ballot and provide additional comments. 

* If you have any further questions, or want to change scores/add comments at any point, feel free to send me a message here on reddit or find me in the [Popheads Discord](https://discord.gg/57C67VBs) @ hikk#1989! The server's #rates channel is always abuzz with rate discussion so if you're not there yet we would love to have you!
