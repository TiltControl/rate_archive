\# of ‘I’m Yours’ and/or Jason Mraz mentions: 19


---

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I don't care, I always found this charming. This song had really no chance, but I legitimately did not realize how hated it would be! I also didn't pick up on the I'm Yours stealing until ALL THE COMMENTS TOLD ME! Fun fact: Jason Mraz did comment on the similarities. According to multiple defunct links on wikipedia he said *"I heard the song, and it was just a tremendous, tremendous horror of a tune(...) I noticed a few similarities in the melody, but it wasn't enough to pick up the phone and argue with somebody about it. If anything, I just wanted my $1.29 back that I spent on iTunes".* Can't believe he spent money on this instead of just watching it live on Disney Channel!

**TragicKingdom1** (0): knockoff I'm Yours which is horrid in concept and execution

---

#Pleased to meet you!

**CarlieScion** (10): idk why this is hated it's cute

**cremeebrulee** (10): no this is not good but it needs all the charity it can get

**datosabona** (10): the saving grace of this trash movie

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): this song was so cute i was in love

**intheaftermath** (9): I am likely entirely blinded by nostalgia here but anyways... when I was 7 I went to Disney and my mom loved this one song so much she bought the Camp Rock CDs

**jaztinax** (9): was stuck between giving this a 7 or 9 bc i wasn’t sure if i liked it better than most of these songs here or if i’m so sick of the song that it gets bumped down a bit. but honestly it’s too iconic even if i am sick of it. and nick spending a whole tour singing this as fast as possible every night was a whole event in itself

**nightstar14** (9): such a cute moment

**Roxieloxie** (9): nick get behind me !!!!!!!!!!!!

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I heard that one line as “I like the sound of violence” and literally paused mid-walk in confusion

**ricki** (8): this song singlehandedly opened the door for shawn mendes into the industry

#First introductions at college

**1998tweety** (6): this was not needed

**bluetriangles04** (6): this is literally train AND CHEESE QUESADILLAS? WHY DID THE BEAT CHANGE LIKE THAT?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I mean this song kind of repulses me inherently but melodically it’s not that bad.

**missdarbusisaqueen** (4.5): You can couuuunt on meeeeee like 1-2-3

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): well…that was something

**shhhneak** (3.8): Jughead energy.

**jackisboredtoday** (3.3): this is bad but i would be down to rate one of Nick’s solo albums one day

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): Youtuber ass song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): ???

**Zypker125** (2.3): This song is justification for why I’m an introvert

**throwaway-7650** (1.1): + .1 points for the violin but I won't defend this. goodbye!

**AHSWeeknd** (1): The quintessential white boy song

**CrimsonROSET** (1): i assure you i did not ask for it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): I thought we were done rating The Vamps. Also this song is heavily lifting from Jason Mraz - I'm Yours

**flava** (1): Jonas Bros were a mistake

**frogaranaman** (1): no wait I'm sorry THIS is the AJR song

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): This is probably gonna be the first song out and it deserves it.

**vayyiqra** (1): What the hell are these lyrics lmao this is awful.

**agentofscranton** (0): ew

**akanewasright** (0): I remembered like 1/8th of the lyrics and was already prepared to 0 this… I forgot about “I like to use the word "dude" a noun or an adverb or an adjective” and how AWFUL he sounds on it

**anothertown** (0): i didn't know it, but i've been waiting 12 years to 0 this

**celladonn** (0): sorry this is insufferable

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (0): how did the camp star girl not get the ick from this 💀 singing about quesadillas and feet 💀💀

**ignitethephoenix** (0): Who wrote this and thought a moon looks like a toenail, and the all the bars about cheese were cute ?

**plastichaxan** (0): i hate this type of ed sheeran riptide by vance joy i’m your by whoever sings that type of music bye

**RandomHypnotica** (0): I entirely forgot about this song and I wanna go back to that

**runaway3212** (0): please dont ever do this to me again

**Saison\_Marguerite** (0): never mind THIS is the AJR jumpscare

**Stryxen** (0): ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

**thedoctordances1940** (0): what the fuck

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): ugh

#I won't hesitate (to mention I'm Yours)

**Alumineous** (7): Jason Mraz really should have stood his ground and sued Disney because the resemblance to I'm Yours is way too close to call it a coincidence.

**NecroDolphinn** (7): This song sounds exactly like Im Yours its uncanny

**thegolding** (6): I'm Yours.....

**diamondsandglass** (5): why is this literally just that Jason Mraz song?

**fadedblue09** (4): That pre chorus is suspiciously similar….has Jason Mraz tried suing for plagiarism

**jsonphile** (4): so I haven’t seen this movie is the scene like Nick Jonas tries to write I’m Yours by Jason Mraz because that’s literally what this song is. But worse.

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): is this not just I’m Yours by Jason Mraz

**2dina3dworld** (2): the lyrics are giving toxic creep, and this is also the same tune as I’m Yours

**nt96** (2): did they put a gun to Jason Mraz's head and forced him to write I'm Yours 2.0?

**SFbby** (2): Is this "I'm Yours" but without the nostalgia??

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): oh jason mraz they plagiarized the FUCK out of you on this one this is basically a straight interpolation LOL

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): Long, long before frivolous lawsuits and endless accusations of plagiarism became the norm in the music industry… even my little 12-year-old self knew this song was a blatant (and worse) rip-off of “I’m Yours.” I don’t even like that song! But I knew it didn’t deserve this!

**apatel27** (1): This is a Jason Mraz song

**Carnie** (1): what is this??? 💀💀 is this a Im Yours parody??

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): if you rearrange the letters in Nick Jonas’ name you get Jason Knic which is close enough to Jason Mraz

**welcome2thejam** (1): Jason Mraz could copyright strike this song and it would get a hit

**seanderlust** (0): this is i'm yours by jason mraz but worse

**bogo** (0): i'm not bothered by the weird and goofy lyrics so much as i'm bothered by the fact that this sounds like i'm yours by jason mras

\# of AMVs I scrolled through on Youtube before getting bored: 12

---

**ImADudeDuh** (8): This is probably the most "so bad, it's good" song in this rate for me. Everything about it is just hilarious. This obvious Hamilton-inspired faux rap that ends up sounding less like an evil villain and more like Gabbie Hanna. The way that these writers really tried to push the fact that the daughter of SLEEPING BEAUTY could be a villain (I haven't seen any Descendants movie btw). The fact that this was on the Hot 100 for 2 months? It's so ***CAMP*** and is so funny. I still can't bring myself to give it an ironic score higher than an 8, and I'm still having second thoughts about it. Another fun fact! The Singles Jukebox rated this song higher than BTS - Permission to Dance, Jesy Nelson - Boyz ft. Nicki Minaj, and Katy Perry - Firework.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): the fact that this was the strongest vocal take they got is hilarious. despite sounding like it was made in garageband i do think there is a good song buried deep inside here somewhere

---

#Yas queen!

**Alumineous** (10): This could work for Queen Maeve at one point in The Boys.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Okay I was all prepared to comment “Queen of Camp” but the more I listen…this is actually just straight up good.

**intheaftermath** (9.5): I love the fact that Audrey is the villain of this movie. I did not love when all 20 of the girls at my camp were convinced that they could belt this.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I was going to give this a 1 but the acting is so hilarious I have to bump it up to a FUCKING 8 cuz it makes me laugh my ass off

**thegolding** (8): the only good song from the third film

**vayyiqra** (8): The cover art to Descendants 3 baited me with the Grimes/Hana kind of aesthetics and it worked

**Zypker125** (8): This spoken-word-talk-chant-rap actually slaps?

**1998tweety** (7.5): its ok

#Belongs with Queen Elizabeth II

**fadedblue09** (7.5): A bit generic compared to the other picks but still far from the worst

**emayzee** (7.2): this sounds like a macklemore song

**nt96** (7): I just know Gabbie Hanna unironically sings this in the shower

**AHSWeeknd** (6): A trap ballad by Disney??

**babadork** (6): I don’t exactly like this, but I appreciate the attempt. The last minute is also kind of good.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): You’ll never be Raven Queen.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): Why does this follow the structure of an Eminem song LMAO

**jasannn** (6): that climax though

**jsonphile** (6): slam poetry queen

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): Eminem if he couldn’t swear

**seanderlust** (5.5): top 10 rappers eminem is afraid to diss

**bogo** (5): these movies seem like crazed fever dreams

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): this would be fine if the rapping weren’t so cringe

**welcome2thejam** (5): Live Laugh Love to Gaslight Gatekeep Girlboss pipeline

**bluetriangles04** (4): slam poetry rearing its ugly head back into this world isn't what I was really expecting in this decade

**DaHumanTorch** (4): i didn't know NF's wife made music

**datosabona** (4): girl what is this. . . .

**nightstar14** (4): put me to sleep

**PretentiousPegasus** (4): Sorry but the verses give Gabbie Hanna

**yearofthesoup** (3.4): I have no idea who this person is or why they attempted to steal Eminem's flow. I'm having so much secondhand embarrassment for this person (while also knowing that they're probably the kind of theater kid who likely loved performing this...cannot relate!)

**diamondsandglass** (3): what's this spoken word bs

**ignitethephoenix** (3): why is she not even singing half of the song

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): Lin Manuel Miranda you will pay for your crimes. Sarah Jeffery you will pay too

**runaway3212** (3): she has such a nice voice but my god what a song to use it on

**throwaway-7650** (3): this isn't THAT bad but... nvmind not defending this either

**jackisboredtoday** (2.8): I was expecting a campy fun villain song from this not awful raps and an attempt at forced emotion as if Skylar Grey tried to take over the eminem parts in one of their bland collabs

**anothertown** (2): girly lmao

**frogaranaman** (2): this is just Hamilton

**shhhneak** (1.5): you haven’t seen mean until you flop in a popheads rate.

**akanewasright** (1): Why is she channeling a more boring version of Macklemore?

**apatel27** (1): You're talking, how are you still missing the beat???

**CarlieScion** (1): the twenty one pilots of it all

**plastichaxan** (1): this gets good at one point but it’s kinda late for that

**RandomHypnotica** (1): is this madison beer

**Roxieloxie** (1): why the fuck did they set her up with the tyler Joseph ass flow. [Tilly outsold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG-ZI8D0A7g) but also how is this the biggest charting hit in this franchise???

**Stryxen** (1): pitchy . ugly

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i dont think this song has a single redeemable factor

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): my 0 keeps changing in this rate

**TiltControls** (1): I realize there's going to be over the top songs in this rate but this goes on even past that

**bigbigbee** (0): This is a Rosé solo

**CrimsonROSET** (0): that’s why they call it window pane

**MoonlightByWindow** (0): it gets worse the longer it goes on

**ricki** (0): halsey

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): If I had a nickel for every time I 0’d a song this year where someone tried and spectacularly failed to sound like Eminem, I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice. Omg I’ve always wanted to say that line!!

People with nostalgia for Austin and Ally that did this rate: probably 5?

---

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): overdone sentiment but it's kinda cute i guess

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Oh, Austin and Ally. You made so many songs and yet none of them were memorable enough for anyone to really remember them. This song isn't *bad*, it's just very nonessential to the canon of disney music. I don't even know what else to say here so I'll use the rest of this blurb to vent. While I was going through weeks and weeks of Billboard Hot 100 data, one video that would autoplay was some Billboard interview with YUNGBLUD and the video would always open with him shaking his ass to the camera while the interviewer would laugh and it has haunted me for several nights. So fuck that specific video, but meh this song.

---

#Love this song!

**followingfreeways** (10): my college roommate was weirdly obsessed with this song but now i get it because its a fucking banger

**bluetriangles04** (9): the anti-'love you like a love song'

**NecroDolphinn** (8.5): Austin and Ally had MUCH better songs but this one was good too.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): yeah this a fuckboy anthem LMAO Austin Moon was on his thot shit with this

**intheaftermath** (8): like, hey girl!!!!

**nightstar14** (8): austin moon ily

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i cant believe this is the only austin and ally song in the rate, they had so many hits on that show and deserved their own section in here!

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I like it better than the Teen Beach Movie song at least. I do find the premise of this sitcom cute.

**1998tweety** (7): idk what this is but its not a love song thats for sure

**CrimsonROSET** (7): should have been the intro song instead

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): "you're the only friend I'd take a shower for" lmfao i cant these lyrics are so funny

**Roxieloxie** (7): This is a song i remember from the show, its just not my favorite one i remember so i will be mad

**throwaway-7650** (7): the bridge just makes me want to stream boyshit instead

**vayyiqra** (7): Who is this guy this isn't bad

#Not a song I love

**runaway3212** (6.5): his voice is actually really nice but this song sucks

**datosabona** (6): it’s fine i guess

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Apparently this guy has gone full slut mode on his new tour… rate manifestation?

**indie\_fan\_** (6): There's far better songs that coulda been used to represent Austin & Ally, but that's just me

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): this show was a fever dream but in a good way

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): what’s aroace

**Zypker125** (5.8): Gets a point for culturally progressive iconism of being about friendship and not romance, gets deducted a point because this song is inspired from Ally, who Austin gets with during the next season anyways.

**LesApfels** (5.5): We could have rated so many more Austin & Ally songs

**babadork** (5.2): I only have vague memories of watching a few episodes of this show, but I feel like in those memories the music wasn’t this bad.

**AHSWeeknd** (5): a product of its time.

**anothertown** (5): perfect timing because i used to not know anything about this show, and as of the last couple weeks i now know about Raini x Ross shippers

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): No hetero.

**jasannn** (5): i watched all the seasons as a kid and i can’t remember any song from the show

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): I’m too old to see the appeal of this song and of Ross Lynch in general

**ricki** (5): do you think ross lynch knew back then that his future career would depend on women and gay men making him go viral every few months because they find him hot?

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): “You’re the only friend I’d take a shower for” ummm Austin you’re hot but I’m gonna need you to take a step back

**flava** (4): I’m crying, I can’t believe I finished the rate

**bigbigbee** (3.5): Wow, this guy sucks! And he  keeps getting worse the more he keeps talking. “I like that you don’t make me watch chick flicks” hm “You can punch me” hmmmm “I don’t speak girl, like HAYY girl” HMMMM “You’re the only friend I’d take a shower for” girl WHAT?

**seanderlust** (3.5): these lyrics feel like toxic masculinity

**akanewasright** (3): a billion hits outsold, double take outsold, Heard it on the radio outsold, SO many other Austin & Ally songs were actually good and successful and this was the one in the rate

**apatel27** (3): Is this One Direction

**nt96** (3): do yall really think guys just don't take showers?

**shhhneak** (2.9): The Ross Lynch propaganda in this rate needs to be investigated.

**Stryxen** (2): non event! Irrelevant

**frogaranaman** (1): this is so whiney

**yearofthesoup** (0): You're the only friend I'd take a shower for? what the actual fk? love preteen toxic masculinity

#You will never be Eureka, California native Sara Bareilles

**cremeebrulee** (3.3): sara bareilles sweetie

**jsonphile** (3): maybe it’d be better if it was a love song because love song is a million times better. And this is true of both the Cure song or the Sara Bareilles song.

**bogo** (2): sara bareilles outsold HARD, and with that out of the way i'm DONE, I CAN FUCKING GO TO SLEEP NOW

**ignitethephoenix** (2): where is Sara Bareilles when you need her

---

**ImADudeDuh** (6): That tiktok trend of people just telling a long winded story that never has a satisfying ending is the only reason it's in this rate and is also the bane of my existance. The song itself is a cute fourth wall breaking song but I still can't bring myself to like it.

**TragicKingdom1** (1): WOAT tiktok sound...make it stop indeed!!!

---

#Omg it's meta! Lol!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Omg this is so cute! Also ended Khalid a bit.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this does not have the right to be this good

**nightstar14** (10): this is what a musical is all about

**ricki** (10): im a musicals gal, what can i say, i love me a meta song

**Stryxen** (10): FUCK this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i dont think i’ll ever get tired of meta musical numbers where characters hate the fact theyre in a musical

**welcome2thejam** (10): Oh no my love of fun meta/fourth wall breaking things is making me want to watch Teen Beach Movie help

**babadork** (9): This might be too high, but there is a tap break.

**datosabona** (9): this is camp

**NecroDolphinn** (8.5): Ok but when you think about it, the line “am I real or just a prop” is super messed up because like imagine being moved without your control and questioning your entire identity and whether or not you even exist.

**apatel27** (8): Where is the creepy old man with a knife in the background

**bluetriangles04** (8): SOMEONE WON'T YOU MAKE IT MAKE IT STOP????

**jasannn** (7.5): why was there a week where it was just non-stop shirtless videos of ross lynch on my fyp?

**yearofthesoup** (7.4): Somehow significantly less annoying than the version used in all those agonizingly slow TikTok medical mysteries

**frogaranaman** (7): this song gives animated Disney film energy

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): the contestants on Total Drama World Tour trying to avoid elimination

#Make. It. Stop. MAKE. IT. STOP.

**throwaway-7650** (6.9): search up "make it stop, make it stop" pls I'm begging

**emayzee** (6.2): this song would probably make more sense if i had context of the scene

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): cute song in context I assume but also one that doesn’t feel like it has any use to me as someone who hasn’t watched this movie yet

**1998tweety** (6): erm

**akanewasright** (6): I’m giving this credit for being a good story idea, but good lord why does it sound like they sampled a royalty free guitar track…

**diamondsandglass** (6): Man or Muppet vibes

**PretentiousPegasus** (6): I thought this was the most boring song from teen beach movie

**runaway3212** (6): too meta for comfort

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Have they tried like staying silent for like a good hour and hoping it'll blow over

**2dina3dworld** (5): …yeah this is the worst song from the whole rate, it gives Clara vibes for some reason as well??? Idk how I brought Doctor Who into this but this song feels Clara-coded

**poppinmmolly** (5): this is probably better with the context of the movie but I haven't seen it so it's just weird

**Zypker125** (4.8): Every time I listen to Maia sing I can’t help but laugh at how she’s an Aussie through and through yet has to sing in the most American accent possible.

**AHSWeeknd** (4): Theatre kids blast this daily

**bigbigbee** (4): SHUT UP, PERIOD

**fadedblue09** (4): Insert low hanging fruit joke here

**jsonphile** (4): I hate musicals that feel the need to be like “oh isn’t it wacky that everyone’s singing?? Look we’re different from other musicals because we acknowledged it!” No you idiot that’s just how they’re telling the story. Do you watch a movie and think “wow it sure is weird that there’s a cameraman following all this action around?”

**nt96** (4): believe me I wish you would

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): Well they should

**Carnie** (3): "i cant stop singing" well can you please 🤣🤣

**jaztinax** (3): no help is this where that tiktok sound is from??? i’m traumatized

**Saison\_Marguerite** (3): I agree, make it stop

**shhhneak** (2.2): It’s giving Mona Pizza. It’s giving Ashley Song. It’s giving WarioWare.

**Alumineous** (2): That person is clearly the weakest singer in the movie. How she got past the audition is beyond me. But she’s probably a really nice person.

**DaHumanTorch** (2): oh they would've stopped singing real quick if i was on set

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): it’s definitely a song !

**ignitethephoenix** (2): why did half the songs in this rate go viral on Tik Tok

**intheaftermath** (2): not to be mean but Maia Mitchell's voice is so grating, especially in contrast with Ross Lynch's... it's like when Hamilton and Burr sing in Dear Theodosia and one sounds so soulful and dazzling with emotion and the other sounds like Bruno Madrigal

**missdarbusisaqueen** (2): It’s funny but gets old fast

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): YES PLEASE MAKE IT STOP

**RandomHypnotica** (2): MAKE IT STOP ALRIGHT PLEASE DEAR GOD

**TiltControls** (1.5): That's too bad

**bogo** (1): please, stop singing

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): stopstopstopstopstopstop please everyone is begging you to stop

**flava** (1): get that ukulele away from me

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): I have a degree in musical theatre and so I can say with authority that “self-aware” songs where people sing about how they’re singing are the lowest form of music.

**Roxieloxie** (1): ricki why were you willing to go to war for this to be included

**seanderlust** (1): I hear a ukelele and my fight or flight is triggered

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): truly responsible for one of the most annoying tik tok trends

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): I can close my eyes but I can’t close my ears

**vayyiqra** (1): Trying way too hard to be cute

**static\_int\_husp** (0): I wish they would!

Taio Cruz's Tiktok Account: N/A


---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I wanted to add this just because I think about how funny it was that Disney Channel really wanted this slightly more acoustic version of Taio Cruz - Dynamite to be a launch pad for one of their newest stars. Also, according to [this clip from the Disney Channel Germany youtube channel,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNnEsJ4cqoY) the context of this clip is that she plays this song at a house party? You are legitimately asking to be bullied if you pull out an acoustic guitar and start playing Dynamite.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): why did this song get such a marketing push during the show's first season when calling all the monsters was right there?? i do like how this builds on itself over the course of the song but a lot of the production choices are like an overproduced plus-era ed sheeran which does not work

---

#Aaaayo!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): she really outdid the original.

**imasalesman** (10): this sounds familiar but I can’t quite place it

**letsallpoo** (10): a cover of the greatest song of all time

**Roxieloxie** (10): bop!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): This works a lot better than it should because China Anne McClain is a good singer and sells the hell out of the track.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): hahahahahaha

**1998tweety** (8): ended BTS

**anothertown** (8): you had better sing!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I was not expecting this to be a Taio Cruz cover 💀

**NecroDolphinn** (8): Outsold the original

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): This is what Taio Cruz was bullied off of tik tok for

**yearofthesoup** (7.6): The original Dynamite reminds me of my college roommate. Specifically of this time she got so drunk at a toga themed apartment party when we were sophomores that when the party got tipped off that cops were coming to break it up, a D1 football player we didn't know at all scooped her unconscious body off a futon and carried her down the stairs and outside. She had no memory of this. So that should tell you that I have 0 knowledge of A.N.T. because I am an #oldhag. Anyway, this version reminds me of the Girl Who Was Infuriatingly Good at Everything killing it at your middle school's talent show. But I'm kind of into it.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): ok but what if I like this more than the original……

**Alumineous** (7): It's a cover of a song that I think we all heard way too much back in the day.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i thought this was the original for an embarrassing amount of time

**diamondsandglass** (7): pop music could always use more dramatic strings

**jaztinax** (7): she went kinda off

**LesApfels** (7): This cover was a really strange choice instead of another original song but go off Disney

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): doesn't beat the original but it's good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): I thought the whole thing would be an emotional acoustic cover and was like, not this

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): not me looking at this song title and going to type in "taio cruz ended her" as my comment and then it turns out to be a literal taio cruz cover

**thegolding** (7): Taio Cruz has been very quiet ever since

#BOMBED

**Zypker125** (6.3): The OG Taio Cruz song is an 11 but this is okay too I guess

**bigbigbee** (6): Not as good as the original and not as good as the Minecraft parody “TNT”, but I like the melody switch-up in the final chorus

**seanderlust** (6): BYE DID NOT EXPECT TAIO CRUZ HERE

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i mean yeah its a fine cover but why would i ever want to listen to this when the taoi cruz original is the best song of all time

**thedoctordances1940** (6): this is not a good cover

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): I can somewhat tolerate this

**agentofscranton** (5): i... do not remember this sounding like this

**followingfreeways** (5): my god. what is this

**vayyiqra** (5): lol what the hell

**welcome2thejam** (5): From the club to the concert hall

**babadork** (4.5): It’s not as bad as I would expect a child singing a Taoi Cruz song to be, but I still don’t want to listen to it.

**2dina3dworld** (4): Taio Cruz outsold

**akanewasright** (4): This arrangement is just not good at all… she’s got some solid riffs here and there though

**bluetriangles04** (4): nah I'm so not a fan of the production decisions here LOL

**bogo** (4): i'd say they ruined this song but tbh it was never very good to begin with

**datosabona** (4): 2010 club music and disney preteen covers are a match made in hell

**jasannn** (4): the dino might do what??

**jsonphile** (4): I don’t like the original song all that much. I didn’t like when glee covered it. (I don’t actually remember if glee covered it, I’m just guessing they did). So I’m definitely not going to be a fan of the Disney channel version of an already mediocre song.

**nt96** (4): its giving pop rocks

**throwaway-7650** (4): I thought this was so slay as a kid and was ready to give it a 10

**shhhneak** (3.7): lol

**cremeebrulee** (3.5): pleek

**jackisboredtoday** (3.5): vote for Men of 2010 so we can give a well-deserved rate win to the classic and impactful Taio Cruz original

**flava** (3): why does this even exist?

**missdarbusisaqueen** (3): Oh hey I know this song from somewhere /s

**nightstar14** (3): taio cruz didnt deserve this

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): This isn’t a song that needs to be turned into a Disney song

**RandomHypnotica** (3): of all the songs that need a cover… dynamite is not one of them

**runaway3212** (3): so much worse than the original

**static\_int\_husp** (3): I really do not like that Disneyfication of Taio Cruz

**TiltControls** (3): of all the things I was expecting, an acousticy cover of Taio Cruz was not one of them

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Wow this is terrible. The nostalgia filter is real

**Carnie** (2): the original is a 1 and this is marginally better

**fadedblue09** (2): Girl no

**grandmafriend** (2): pls stop with the covers omg

**intheaftermath** (2): what the hell

**Stryxen** (2): QAKjlfsjfkjsa:SKLAKSMCLAKMaldk:ak

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1.5): now…what exactly was Disney channel thinking deciding making China do an acoustic version of Taio Cruz’s Dynamite

**apatel27** (1): How can you ruin Dynamite? That's a near impossible task

**frogaranaman** (1): the sync licensing probably went fucking DUMMY on this song

**plastichaxan** (1): what the hell was that

**ricki** (1): the negative impact of glee in society

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Girl what is this.

**musical\_pyn** (0): I'm sorry this is worse in every single way than the original

**TragicKingdom1** (8): this was a late addition because i noticed how many episodes it ended up in. it bops but the most interesting thing about it is that it was sold by Max Martin associate Andreas Carlsson to both BTR and Play, a Swedish girl group who released their versions basically simultaneously. did they split the cost and just hoped nobody would notice? or was it an accident? legitimately fascinating music industry stuff

**ImADudeDuh** (0): Oh my god the opening vocals alone are worthy of a 0. But then the rest of the song keeps going and why are the vocals so AWFUL on this??

---

#I wanna be famous!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Their voices genuinely worked well together

**cremeebrulee** (10): superorganism IS OVER!!!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this has no right to be so good

**Roxieloxie** (10): there was a reason that i never pushed for this to be an inclusion despite how prevalent it was in marketing and in the show itself. Its not their best song,,, ill just say that. Hearing the rap unearthed something in me though i cant not 10 it

**bogo** (9): actually i really would not like being famous but thanks for the song anyway

**bluetriangles04** (8): they play Logan's rap in the outro to kpop trainees to prepare them for the future

**PretentiousPegasus** (8): i really thought Logan ate that rap as a kid lmfao. still a good song though

**1998tweety** (7): BTR you will always be famous

#Big Time Rush you will never be famous

**CrimsonROSET** (7): no i don’t x

**seanderlust** (6.5): is the bridge supposed to stress me out that much?

**runaway3212** (6): slay except for whatever that outro is

**jackisboredtoday** (5.7): the Total Drama theme outsold

**agentofscranton** (5): chad beverly hills by weezer

**akanewasright** (5): this sounds like it was written to not flatter the singers’ voices 😭

**intheaftermath** (5): it's just boring? Would rather stream 4*TOWN

**nightstar14** (5): weak track

**Stryxen** (5): muse core

**TiltControls** (5): At first I thought that ending would tank the song, but it's actually so hilarious it bumped it up

**vayyiqra** (5): Well it's better than "Rockstar" by Nickelback (very low bar)

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Hearing a pop rock song about how being rich and famous is a GOOD thing feels so wrong

**babadork** (4): Listening to this, it seems fair that Logan and James had to share John Lennon instead of getting their own Beatle in the movie.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): …Can I just have the money part?

**datosabona** (4): I’m sorry but the vocals on this are horrendous

**frogaranaman** (4): that rap at the end is a choice

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): You will never be Play bitch!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i get that btr was literally designed to be a parody of boy bands but this somehow sounds like a parody of a parody

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): These are the worst vocals in the rate, and this rate features Selena Gomez and Bella Thorne.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): this one sounds fratty also Logan please don’t ever do that again

**welcome2thejam** (3): This feels like the song the evil rival boy band is supposed to sing, did somebody give BTR the wrong sheet music?

**Zypker125** (2.8): The lyricist for this song needs to be fired for sheer laziness

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): you will never be famous

**apatel27** (2): Bad Message

**fadedblue09** (2): The delivery sounds too serious, sounds like it's trying to be satirical. Also I love Logan but wtf was that rap 💀

**ignitethephoenix** (2): girl it’s not that easy … I’m not rich, hot or a nepo baby

**jasannn** (2): that closing rap is 0 worthy

**jsonphile** (2): Kanye outsold?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): their singing is so flat WHAT is happening. Where did these bros get vocal training, Barstool Sports? 😭

**flava** (1): it was going ok till the “rap” verse

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): my brain turned itself off after something something limousine

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i originally stanned this ironically but an embarrassing number of scrobbles later it's officially unironic y'all. this is the most heavily EDM song in the rate and i think the dubstep weirdly works with the shouty chorus. the verses are kinda 2014 todrick hall'd which is camp for an actual disney song instead of a youtube video that's trying to go viral

**ImADudeDuh** (2): This is a just a slightly better 2NE1 song. Also, Who's That Chick was deemed more iconic than Rotten to the Core 34-28 according to our exit poll. Descendants keeps losing!

---

#It's good to be bad

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Dove Cameron been serving for a while now

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): LMAO YASSSS

**bogo** (10): i don't care if they're two entirely different genres this just feels like the spiritual successor to hoedown throwdown, both are life changing experiences

**cremeebrulee** (10): ok actually maybe that earthquake from earlier fucked with my brain because why is this kinda sounding good rn

**DaHumanTorch** (10): wait wait wait WAITTT what is this post-blackpink aespa'd diplo back when he was good and worked with m.i.a. esque collapse

**plastichaxan** (10): there's a joke to be made about some microgenre with this song but idk about genres enough to make it

**Stryxen** (10): annoying ass vocals. Rotten to the caurwrrrwwww. Beat’s a little bit cunty tho so I'm arbitrarily giving it a 10

**vayyiqra** (10): total banger

**bluetriangles04** (9): I never watched this series so imagine my reaction when this came on and it was fucking club music???? HUH????

**fadedblue09** (9): this is Catwalk music

**jasannn** (9): I can’t believe disney made a hyperpop song in 2015.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This is like if BLACKPINK songs were good

**runaway3212** (8.5): post-good

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): the verses are so slay, the rest is rejected SM demos

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is a Rusical song you can’t change my mind on this

**jaztinax** (7.5): i swore i heard “who’s the daddiest” lmao help. also wasn’t expecting that dubstep break omg

**NecroDolphinn** (7.5): This song invented Hyperpop and Deconstructed Club. Move over Arca.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): tbh this was kinda working until the bridge

**intheaftermath** (7): score's only this low because the Evie solo version is miles better. This song and the attitude behind it work so much better as a solo villain-moment song.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): wait…it's camp

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Because Disney villains have historically been queer-coded I’m gonna choose to accept this as a gay anthem

#Rotted.

**bookthieving** (6): i'm a lamborghini, i'm a hollywood star

**datosabona** (6): its giving disney merch at hot topic in 2014

**yearofthesoup** (5.8): Is this a Kesha (Ke$ha era) song

**anothertown** (5): blackpink could have ate this

**PretentiousPegasus** (5): I never watched this movie so looked up the YouTube video and it has almost half a BILLION views?!?? I had no idea this movie was that big. Songs okay I guess, but i wanted vocals and got none

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4.5): I hate this but I also want to hear Blackpink over the beat

**CrimsonROSET** (4): i’m always scared they’ll break into ‘it’s turkey lurkey time’

**nightstar14** (4): its catchy but i just cant

**welcome2thejam** (4): Sale on Disney merch at Hot Topic, theatre kids get an extra 20% discount

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3.5): the mid-song dubstep break down definitely happened!

**pleasegivemeasword** (3): there's no way this song wasn't made in 2015

**celladonn** (2.5): this almost gets to so bad it's good territory but it's still just bad

**flava** (2.5): cringe

**Alumineous** (2): Oh, hell no. That production is atrocious. But on another note, this is Homelander's theme song for sure.

**akanewasright** (1): Blackpink is thanking god they weren’t given this beat

**apatel27** (1): This was meant to be serious? Jeez...

**frogaranaman** (1): I feel like if you liked this song as a kid you got into k-pop shortly after

**missdarbusisaqueen** (1): I’m a little bit single, even when I’m not

**seanderlust** (1): hearing this is the emotional equivalent of rupaul when he's watching a lip sync where he's gonna send both of the queens home

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): this sounds like bullying waiting to happen

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): they think you’re Kelis??

**TiltControls** (1): Fitting name

**CarlieScion** (0): Drag Race final 4-recorded song from HELL

**outsideeyess** (0): this song is the reason i've never watched this movie

**ImADudeDuh** (5): They really tried to make their own wrap-up, "everyone's happy together" song just like We're All In This Together and they missed the mark so hard. If this wasn't played in every commercial for Camp Rock, I would not remember this song existed.

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): this is less annoying than We're All In This Together but i cannot stand the singing-in-unison finale songs. theyre like the dcom equivalent of dreamworks dance party endings

---

#This Rocks!

**shhhneak** (10): Deserved the same treatment as Glee’s Don’t Stop Believin’

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): I always thought they were singing "WE ROCK GOD" as a kid, and assumed this was a christian movie before watching it

**plastichaxan** (9): :camprock:

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): the chorus is a slay, but the verses… peloton

**1998tweety** (8): we do

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): why is this chorus kind of hitting

**jaztinax** (8): can someone send me to rock camp pls??

**jasannn** (7.5): Demi and Joe harmonizing is pure serotonin

**AHSWeeknd** (7): or at least they think they do

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): We’re some in this together.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): in theory i like these ensemble performances but literally the next song wipes this one out of the water


#Do you?

**nightstar14** (7): it was so much better when i was 9

**welcome2thejam** (7): That is as hard as the Disney Channel is legally allowed to rock

**Zypker125** (6.7): Paper scissors

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): [citation needed]

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): really just a vehicle for Demi and the Jonases

**fadedblue09** (6): Demi is hard carrying this

**ignitethephoenix** (6): as far as theme songs go, this is not one of the better ones, it’s just very basic

**Roxieloxie** (6): this is a little better than we're all in this together but ,, thats not a high bar

**vayyiqra** (6): Oh good a Camp Rock song that is kind of like rock music

**agentofscranton** (5): shein we're all in this together

**Carnie** (5): do you? snoozefest of a song

**diamondsandglass** (5): do you though?

**flava** (5): this song is both a 1 and 10 at different points

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5): Demi had to carry this

**runaway3212** (5): this kinda sucks sorry bestie demi

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): This high school show choir serve

**bogo** (4.5): haha get it cause the movie's called camp rock and the song is we rock hahahahaha omg it's so funny please send help i'm losing my mind

**akanewasright** (4): this… sure sounds like the lyrics were written by camp councilors

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I would prefer it if it was “we stop”

**ricki** (4): this is trying too hard to be we're all in this together

**thedoctordances1940** (4): no

**apatel27** (3): How are they still unable to make an ensemble song that sounds good

**frogaranaman** (3): the fact that some Disney exec heard this song and signed off on not one but TWO films for it is absurd

**jsonphile** (3): when I was young I went to Bible Camp at my church, and when I was older I volunteered at it. This sounds like the music they played, basically kidz bop church music.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): ouuu

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): even as a kid i thought this one was lame

**seanderlust** (2): the chorus is kind of giving kidz bop...sorry i really don't like this one

**throwaway-7650** (1.5): the mixing is atrocious... this is 0-worthy actually but I'll be nice

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): you don’t

**bluetriangles04** (0): who on earth mixed this??? it's like they're whispering

**DaHumanTorch** (0): can we as a society finally admit camp rock isn't good despise the jonas brothers' best efforts to carry it

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this legitimately might be my favorite boy band power ballad of all time. they're usually way too cheesy for me but it all comes together here for some reason

**ImADudeDuh** (3.5): This really sounds like a parody of boy bands in a tv show that only sing about their "girl" and repeat it a lot. Again, its ironic because they were a real band but this does not sound like they made a whole television program around them, let alone that they could attempt to make a COMEBACK IN 2022.

---

#Mr. Worldwide 

**agentofscranton** (10): wept

**Alumineous** (10): Holy shit, just keep doing the BSB (after Black and Blue) formula, it’s working because I dig this.

**bogo** (10): WORLDWIIIIIDE WORLDWIIIIIIIDE

**cremeebrulee** (10): this actually invented romance if u really think about it

**followingfreeways** (10): honestly a contender for my 11

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): yeah so who’s trying to think about ME worldwide 😡

**nightstar14** (10): it speaks for itself

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): i still remember the choreo for this one

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): This really solidified BTR as the greatest boyband of all time for me

**Roxieloxie** (10): WAIT,,,,, A MINUTE,,,,,, BEFORE YOU TELL ME ANYTHING,,, HOW WAS YOUR DAY ,, CAUSE IF,,, BEEN MISSING,,,, YOU!!! BY !! MY !! SIDE !!!! UGHHHHHHH

**runaway3212** (10): the best ballad to ever ballad

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): This is like, the ultimate boy group song. The corny but cutting sentimentality, the iconic chorus, the broad applicability, everything that a boy group song is supposed to bring, this does.

**musical\_pyn** (9): the white outfits in the airport is a core memory

**xxipil0ts** (9): Kendall and Jo deserved better

**shhhneak** (8.5): now THIS is the boy band energy I was looking for.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Just another bop about Tokyo…

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): im sorry the way they put her back into the show on the final season was BULLSHIT LIKE WHAT?????

**fadedblue09** (7.5): sounds like late 2000s Ne-Yo/Stargate songs, which is never a bad thing for me

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): pitbull found dead in a ditch

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): where's the mr. worldwide remix... snoop dogg you're over...

**1998tweety** (7): ended pitbull

**Carnie** (7): beautiful

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): they sing it so earnestly that i believe they actually are in love with me

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): wanting to tuck someone in… the freaky shit some people are into

#Missed her worldwide

**ricki** (6.5): this is the song the main character's fictional boy band sings on a sitcom

**apatel27** (6): They don't have the charisma to pull off a backstreet boys homage properly

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): mr worldwide BTR are not

**Zypker125** (5.5): This song would definitely receive a 3 point bump if I heard it during a wedding ceremony or marriage proposal

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this song is about pitbull

**frogaranaman** (5): they're just listing cities

**jackisboredtoday** (4.8): if they were gonna use this title they should have paid up for a feature from Mr. Worldwide himself aka pitbull on it… also they should have made it not a boring, lethargic ballad

**babadork** (4.7): I do not understand who they are remaking a Backstreet Boys video for. Maybe moms with enough kids that they have second-hand experience with two generations of boy bands? People the same age as the members of Big Time Rush would not be watching Big Time Rush.

**seanderlust** (4.5): overly sappy lyrics backed by an instrumental that sounds like late-2000s ne-yo refused to sing on it because it was too boring.

**AHSWeeknd** (4): The way they thought they were NSYNC

**akanewasright** (4): Y’all, you’re not getting

**jsonphile** (4): why does he sing the word worldwide like that?

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4): Pitbull outsold

**yearofthesoup** (3.7): A harkening back to the BSB era of boy bands. Not in a good way.

**intheaftermath** (3): the target audience for this song is definitely heterosexual teen girls. I am definitely not the target demographic here and it really, really shows. It's like how I feel listening to Christian Pop - it's just not made for me or anyone like me.

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Wow! It’s cheesy AND boring!

**welcome2thejam** (3): Dale!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.5): how does a song manage to be so boring and so annoying at the same time

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): you will never be Pitbull

**flava** (1): honestly C. Br*wn songs have aged better than this

**plastichaxan** (1): this is just boyfriend but worse

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): this is a Boyz4Now song

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): Bella Thorne is easily the least convincing effort of turning an actress into a pop girl in this rate and this song is the perfect example because Zendaya does pretty much the whole chorus except for Bella's "let me hear that" adlib. that being said it works as a combo against all odds

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I refuse to believe that this song wasn't made by people with the explicit goal of making the most annoying song of all time.

---

#We are watching!

**1998tweety** (10): no cause I was actually obsessed with this song when it came out and honestly idk why

**flava** (10): Nostalgia

**plastichaxan** (10): proto-hyperpop

**Roxieloxie** (10): yeah this is the best shake it up song

**vayyiqra** (10): We're fully into the electro-trash autotuned garbage part of the rate, and I am into it.

**intheaftermath** (9): I came really close to giving this a dangerously low score for the abhorrent vocals alone but honestly? The chorus is insanely good. It is docked a point for those vocals though

**thegolding** (9): never liked the show but this song is amazing

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): disney literally subliminally messaging people to watch shake it off

**cremeebrulee** (8.3): 👁 👁

**AHSWeeknd** (8): It sounds like the producers gave them a different beat while recording and switched it up on them last minute. Still a bop though

**bluetriangles04** (8): catch me on the dance floor when this plays

**ricki** (8): i auditioned to shake it up using this song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): who told bella thorne to sing like a creaky door?

**fadedblue09** (7): Sounds really dated and trashy but still has a charm

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): this has potential to be amaze unironically…

**slimboyfriend** (7): this is blackout-era Britney

**xxipil0ts** (7): Okay hyperpop

#I pretend I do not see it

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.5): the most mid song of the rate I fear

**akanewasright** (6): I remember seeing all the negative reviews for this on iTunes when I went to download it and thinking they were all boring for hating on such a great song… the boomers were right

**datosabona** (6): this sounds like a 14 year old's idea of club music. not good but i get where they're coming from

**nightstar14** (6): forgettable

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): In the pilot of this show a random kid at their school (probably becomes a side character later on) offers CeCe and Rocky two tickets to a Lady Gaga concert. This is a subtle reference to how all the music in this show basically tries and fails to copy The Fame

**Zypker125** (6): https://youtu.be/vjW8wmF5VWc?t=27

**bogo** (5.5): they sound very unenthusiastic

**LesApfels** (5): The production and mixing feel off

**PretentiousPegasus** (5): I'm glad we stopped pretending Bella Thorne could sing

**jaztinax** (4.5): is this piece of me by britney spears?

**anothertown** (4): the 2010s just swept through and kneecapped these soundtracks

**CrimsonROSET** (4): eurovision song

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiAWdaRGlIw

**jsonphile** (4): this is just a Kesha song without Kesha

**runaway3212** (4): maybe they spilled not letting them sing the intro

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Yeah… this is lame

**grandmafriend** (3.5): why does this sound exactly like the song before this

**frogaranaman** (3): this is miserable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): how did i actually enjoy this as a kid

**TiltControls** (2.5): It sounds like an early Britney song, but not one of the good ones

**apatel27** (2): Nobody is rocking out to this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Oh this song is an early 2010’s time capsule in the worst possible way.

**yearofthesoup** (1.8): They really wanted to make Bella into Kesha for children didn't they?

**shhhneak** (1.2): sigh

Raven-Symone: OUT

---

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): does anyone else think it's kinda wild that they greenlit a cheetah girls film after raven left? like no offense to adrienne bailon but i don't think the disney kids were really showing up for her

**ImADudeDuh** (5): The Cheetah Girls writers really decided that they're just gonna make a song about a noun and put "Cheetah" in front of it and call it a day huh? At least this is insanely catchy, but wow this is not memorable at all.

---

🐆💞

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): not to be shady but why is this better than every song that had raven on it

**xxipil0ts** (10): the rent was due but they PAID IT!!!

**intheaftermath** (9.5): "Cheetah Love Text To Speech" (derogatory)

**jaztinax** (9.5): the chorus is SO HYPE. only not a 10 bc raven isn’t in this

**runaway3212** (9.5): idc idc whenever somebody starts repeating words the song automatically starts to slay more

**Alumineous** (9): Big Little Mix vibes.

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): theres something so camp about them singing these lyrics without raven lmao

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is so cunty

**bogo** (8.5): okay but how does this cheetah love compare to muskrat love

**Carnie** (8.5): Why was this song chosen instead of dance me if you can??? @tk stop putting the worst songs in rates PLEASE

**apatel27** (8): So is this a diss track?

**datosabona** (8): this is getting the same score at cheetah sisters because in my mind they are the same song

**fadedblue09** (8): Still quite enjoyable, some choices in the bridge were not necessary though

**throwaway-7650** (8): purr ❤️💖❤️‍🔥😻

**welcome2thejam** (8): Cheetos mascot E rated fanfic:

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): the way they just sprinkled in a bit of Bollywood to cater to my tastes

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): serving little mix wings before they were even a thing

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): so British-coded; it’s their Spice Girls - Holler moment, and it’s giving discount Xenomania a bit. do the Y2UK rate!

**shhhneak** (7.5): I’m sorry but The Cheetah Girls have never been a trio to me.

#Cheetah Hate

**outsideeyess** (7): why does this sound like a neon hitch song

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): Just Cheetah Sisters again

**vayyiqra** (7): Being basic and liking an electro song rn

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): A Cheetah Bop

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I could get freaky to this in the club at age 11 I guess

**emayzee** (6.4): this is proof that raven carried the group

**CrimsonROSET** (6): there’s something so funny about this being here when its the only movie without the five

**nt96** (6): There's a new pet! (Ch-Ch-Ch-CHEETAH) Cheetah Pet®! The pottery that grows, it's fun and easy! Soak your Cheetah, spread the seeds, keep it watered and watch it grow! Cheetah Pets®, the pottery that grows!

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): They needed Raven to make a good movie

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): why does this sound like a britney spears song

**Zypker125** (5): We’re the cheating cheating girls….. Wait, that’s now how the lyrics actually go?

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (4.5): the intro is kinda giving Ayesha Erotica?

**anothertown** (4): one through five the "official kara dioguardi score range"

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): The Smithsonian says that adult female cheetahs are solitary creatures. Maybe if they were the elephant girls instead this song would sound better.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Maybe it’s for the best that they broke up after this

**missdarbusisaqueen** (4): this is the only cheetah girls song my mom knows. Cheetah Girls 3 is mid without raven anyway

**Stryxen** (4): i almost love this camp mess but then it just draaaaaags

**grandmafriend** (3.2): you really made me listen to the cheetah girls for the first time ever in my mid twenties - and for what?

**yearofthesoup** (3.1): Voices work well together but some should just not be highlighted this way

**flava** (3): yeah this is kinda grating and i'm not convinced that they are gonna hang out for more than a day, also kinda love how this comes right after cheetah sisters since they’re now raveless

**nightstar14** (3): did nothing for me

**Roxieloxie** (3): unironically why was this the song chosen to represent the 3rd movie. Like this is the least iconic song from that one, dance me if you can or one world were right there

**thedoctordances1940** (3): idk i don't think love between cheaters works out so often

**AHSWeeknd** (1): The best decision Raven Symoné ever made was exiting the Cheetah Girls

**DefaultPophead** (0): The only thing that could possibly make this song worse is a rap verse from Lisa.

I don't even have a joke, this song is just so boring:


---

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i was legitimately shocked to learn that some people (roxie) hate this during that one bonus rate because it's by far my favorite JoBros song. it's the best they've ever sounded imo and the shouty hook contrasted with the growly vocals really hits for me

**ImADudeDuh** (1): Fuck this song.

---

#West Coast Best Coast

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is actually so Corny of me but the first time i went to LA i played the worst sequence of songs possible which was lana del rey - west coast and then this

**jaztinax** (10): the JONAS soundtrack (both seasons) kind of slap

**nightstar14** (10): anything jonas brothers from their time on disney is perfection to me

**runaway3212** (10): maybe the jonas brothers deserve rights sometimes

**throwaway-7650** (10): hollywood is in L.A., coincidence?

**emayzee** (9.7): thank god none of the jonas brothers songs from their actual albums were in this rate bc then i'd never be able to pick an 11

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): yeah this is really good Jonas LA snapped with this

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): I wish they used this as the theme sing for Jonas LA

**1998tweety** (8): Hilary outsold

**datosabona** (8): when i was in elementary school and everyone would ask who my favorite jonas brother was i would say kevin because no one ever picked him and i felt bad but really i was a lesbian. anyways good song

**frogaranaman** (8): L.A. is not where dreams are made of, it is where dreams are profited on

**Roxieloxie** (8): This song was in the bonus rate of the first rate I ever hosted, and it went out first! I have softened on it as i've gotten older but i hated this song so much at the time because i resented Jonas L.A. , Live to party outsells this so hard, but its not as bad as i made it out to be so ill give it .3 more points than i did last time

**Zypker125** (7.1): Bumped my score down 2 points for praising Los Angeles, but it still hits

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): Sounds like any other JoBros song, in a good way

**seanderlust** (7): LA Baby sounds like a euphemism for industry plant

**Stryxen** (7): bop BUT hillary did it first. Remember that.

#Stuck in traffic

**TiltControls** (7): most songs can be so inoffensive that they're bad, but this somehow wraps back around to good?

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): i’ve never heard a jonas brothers song in my life but this is good

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Inferior song about dreams being made of things

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Hillary Duff is quaking

**CrimsonROSET** (6): you’re not even the best song about what dreams are made of in this rate

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): Jonas LA was such a flop lmao

**jsonphile** (5.5): okay half this song is just “yeah yeah” played over a four chord progression come on put a little more effort into it

**plastichaxan** (5.5): i almost gave this the 10 for what dreams are made of 😭 can you imagine

**akanewasright** (5): the way my parents HATED this show

**apatel27** (5): Drowning bad vocals with overtuned guitars seems to be a constant with disney rock

**bluetriangles04** (5): DREAM TOMATOOOOOO

**bogo** (5): idk i'm not feeling this one that much

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Boys, boys, I thought we've been over this with Alicia: "Where dreams are made of" does not make grammatical sense

**anothertown** (4): this was the worst era for me in my jonas brothers stan days i was embarrassed by every thing they were doing

**intheaftermath** (4): somehow, by some miracle, Brendon Urie did it better

**nt96** (4): is this where Lizzie McGuire's dreams are?

**welcome2thejam** (4): Call me when you do the song about how much you hate L.A.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3.5): I’m from Orange County and LA sucks, please stop romanticizing LA. It’s the worst.

**shhhneak** (3.5): At this point every song about LA sung by a man blends together.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): they weren’t even trying to sound unique

**Alumineous** (3): Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is a lot of nothing.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Not two bad songs with (basically) the same title in this rate…

**missdarbusisaqueen** (3): Nick Jonas always sounds like he’s dying

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): long song phobia

**yearofthesoup** (2.2): anyone who says "californ eye aye" deserves to be publicly shamed

**jasannn** (2): but who are dreams made of?

However, I do recognize that Meaghan Martin extracted every ounce of pussy hyperpop cunty synth girlboss pop music and put it into this one song. Yes Meaghan, you ARE too cool for me. I am so sorry I disgusted your eyes with my presence.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): "i can't help the way i am" me af. anyways this sounds like a demo and the really confused production makes it kinda unlistenable. lack of nostalgia strikes again!!

---

#SO COOL!

**DefaultPophead** (11): I'm not sure why I have no friends.

**1998tweety** (10): its kinda iconic how this girl was such a rat, she really flipped teams constantly

**agentofscranton** (10): disney channel really monopolised the market on the bitchy blonde teen girl anthem in the 00s huh

**Alumineous** (10): Shoulder! MORE SHOULDER!

**bookthieving** (10): the original shoulder shimmy choreo shin ryujin you're DONE!

**CarlieScion** (10): shoulder shimmies condescendingly across stage

**Carnie** (10): meghan jennette martin >>> demi lovato

**followingfreeways** (10): nothing made me feel more badass than shimmying my shoulders to this song on the playground.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): listen now that i’m grown up i know this is bad but it served so hard in my mind at the time so i’m gonna pretend i don’t know that its bad

**plastichaxan** (10): camp classic

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this sounds like a double take song

**ricki** (10): this is a sharpay song made without an understanding of subtlety

**shhhneak** (10): The director said “don’t start yet!” and she heard “cultural reset.”

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): stan Jessica from Until Dawn's cunt anthem!!!

**thegolding** (10): the gayest anthem after Fabulous

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): slay

**cremeebrulee** (9.3): how can u hate this and then stan sharpay the math is not mathing

**slimboyfriend** (9): this is camp… like literally and figuratively

**akanewasright** (8): this is horrible but I loved it as a kid so I’m forced to stan

**jaztinax** (8): this song is so camp

**vayyiqra** (8): I thought Camp Rock would have rock music in it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.7): apart from from the unispired lyrics, there’s a good song in here somewhere, I’m a sucker for this kind of overproduced pop rock

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): wait it's slaying a bit…

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): yes bully me girlies

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I can respect a cocky bitch.

**bogo** (7): is this the sharpay of camp rock

**fadedblue09** (7): love the concept but lacking in swagger

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): If Kim Petras made good music it’d be this

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Imagine a main pop girl just coming out with a song like this. Would she be canceled? Would she be embraced by her stans? I bet Beyoncé could pull it off. Imagine she made a song where she just calls all of us broke ugly bitches for 3 straight minutes, I don't think the world would be the same after that

#So coooool (sarcastic)

**datosabona** (6.5): sorry walmart sharpay

**anothertown** (6): this song could have been a serve with a real hook or better vocals or SOMETHING? the metronome that comes in at the end also made me go insane

**diamondsandglass** (6): Walmart brand I'm Too Sexy

**runaway3212** (6): she wishes she was you wish you were me

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): Right Said Tess

**CrimsonROSET** (5): eurovision song

**jasannn** (5): too pitchy

**welcome2thejam** (5): Is this the "camp" in Camp Rock?

**seanderlust** (4.5): i get that we aren't supposed to like this person but like...this is very heavy handed flskdjf

**AHSWeeknd** (4): oof some of these songs were disgraceful

**nightstar14** (4): that shoulder move and golden dress were horrendous

**PretentiousPegasus** (4): I hated that bitch Tess. truly a poor mans Regina George

**TiltControls** (4): I don't really like how it sounds, but I appreciate it as what I assume is a villain song

**Zypker125** (4): 2 Cool 2 Furious

**2dina3dworld** (3): I don’t remember this at all??? This was in the movie???? WHEN?

**bluetriangles04** (3): this song sounds like something that red dress girl would release

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Wannabee ass Sharpay clone how DARE you

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): YOU THINK YOURE HOT BUT IM SORRY YOUR NOT 😭 iconic but Tess was a little tone deaf ngl

**frogaranaman** (2): this is so annoying LMFAO

**jsonphile** (2): excuse me who is this weak ass Sharpay wannabe??? This song is ass and she straight up can’t sing. Is that the point of this song? Like I thought she was supposed to be like the star of camp rock that Demi Lovato had to take down but singing like this would make her immediately laughed out of camp, especially for trying to sing a song called “too cool”

**throwaway-7650** (2): girl at your big age

**IdiotBox01** (1): y’all are canceled for including this shit but not Supernova Girl

**Roxieloxie** (1): doing this rate is really pointing out how camp rock was just a mess.

**apatel27** (0): Jesus what in the tween hell is this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): discount Sharpay

**indie\_fan\_** (0): This needs to suffer is all I'm gonna say here

**intheaftermath** (0): I want to be able to rate this better because it's camp or something but it's so, so unlistenable. The autotune is nauseating and the synth sounds like someone is clubbing poor Hatsune Miku to death. Like I said, I want to love it for its purpose but they are just so, so far from hitting that mark. Anyways, stream Camp Star's Fire.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): this sounds like a song a queen on drag race would release after they get second to last place

---

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): i love how this fits a ton of real life pop song cliches but in the context of the show it's hilariously literal

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Listen, we've seen her beach house. We've seen her closet. We've seen that she's a world-famous pop star. We've seen her SECOND BEACH HOUSE IN SEASON 4 WITH AN EVEN BIGGER CLOSET!!! This song is FALSE ADVERTISING. Arrest her!

---

#Ordinary Joe

**Alumineous** (10): Woahoooooh oh yeah. Anyway, I love a stripped down song.

**CarlieScion** (10): i too, am, sometimes lazy #relatable

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): i get silly 😔🫶🤪

**plastichaxan** (10): she’s so normal!!! except she’s rich

**thegolding** (10): this makes me cry for some reason lmao

**agentofscranton** (9.5): finally an anthem for the silly people out there, we exist!!!

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): this is what louis tomlinson tried to do with just like you

**runaway3212** (9): I make six figures but im also just just like you

**shhhneak** (8.5): One thing Hannah’s going to do is elevate her middest songs with an immaculate chorus.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8.5): [i'm your basic average girl and i'm basic and i'm average and i'm girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE_AaXTfA2U)

**1998tweety** (8): omg shes just like me!

**musical\_pyn** (8): lmao ross lynch is in this music video???

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): She's just like me omg

**ignitethephoenix** (7.9): this is better than I thought it would be

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): H2O Just Add Water outsold

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): wait…so true miss montana

**diamondsandglass** (7): why is the chorus so much louder than the verses?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Disney Channel knew how to make being a suburbanite sound like the most dramatic thing in the world.

**jaztinax** (7): how does this song sound more dated than any of the songs from previous seasons

**missdarbusisaqueen** (7): It’s giving 2005 chick flick Avril Lavigne ripoff

**Stryxen** (7): i’m a creep i’m a weirdo

**emayzee** (6.6): something about the mixing of her vocals during "anything could hAaaAApen in this world" has bothered me since it came out

#I'm not like other girls

**bluetriangles04** (6): her worst included in this rate...

**CrimsonROSET** (6): miley’s first ‘this is my most personal album ever’

**jasannn** (6): too corny for me

**poppinmmolly** (6): cry on your yacht hannah

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): Gonna Get This feat. Iyaz robbed of the other  Season 4 spot

**cremeebrulee** (5.6): this song is a cry for help jeez

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Too much vocal processing for a supposedly vulnerable moment

**bogo** (5): FEEL THE RAIN ON YOUR SKIN NO ONE ELSE CAN FEEL IT FOR YOU ONLY YOU CAN LET IT IN NO ONE ELSE NO ONE ELSE CAN SPEAK THE WORDS ON YOUR LIPS

**intheaftermath** (5): maybe it's Montana-overexposure but there are so many songs even in this rate alone that cover the feelings of this one and execute it so much better.

**Roxieloxie** (5): i wrote a whole essay earlier about how i prefer the older hannah music but maybe its just those two albums. Honestly having that knowledge is kinda hurting this because theres 5 other songs on HM3 that have the same 'im just a normal girl :pleading:' approach and like ,, all of them are the same.

**yearofthesoup** (4.9): a preview of later Miley, vocally. Lyrically kinda cringe tho.

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): little too on the nose for me, unlike the masterpiece that is best of both worlds

**AHSWeeknd** (4): Suddenly she’s an R&B artist??

**nt96** (4): I'm suddenly reminded of Avril Lavigne's rock chick monologue. Is that weird?

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Ma’am no one who owns beachfront Malibu property is an “ordinary girl” I can promise you

**seanderlust** (3.7): why do I feel like these lyrics would get dragged if Hannah was a real-world pop star and we rated this in like jukebox or something

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Oh god it’s like she’s singing from inside my ear drums.

**flava** (3): miley, bestie, you were never an ordinary girl, and neither will I, stop trying to empower me

**Zypker125** (2.3): 🎵 'Cause I'm no ordinary girl 🎵 I'm from the deep blue underworld 🎵 Land or sea I've got the power if I just believe 🎵 'Cause I'm no ordinary girl 🎵 I'm from the deep blue underworld 🎵 Land or sea The world's my oyster, I'm the pearl 🎵 No ordinary girl 🎵

**akanewasright** (2): I know this is the biggest song from this flop album, but MAN I wish that damn Iyaz collab or the batshit Que Sera were the ones to get the attention

**apatel27** (2): Starting to think I'm not the target audience for this rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): corny and boring

**vayyiqra** (2): Ew 90s radio filler

**frogaranaman** (1): an "ordinary girl" in your million dollar mansion? fuck you

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): I guess she stopped having the best of both worlds?

**ImADudeDuh** (7): There's something hilarious about how dated this song is compared to everything else in the rate

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): i really need to know if the disney execs were genuinely like "hm yes Bella Thorne will definitely be our next star on pop radio!" or if they just felt obligated to give her songs because Zendaya was getting them. that being said this is legitimately camp

---

#TY BFFs

**letsallpoo** (11): ended PANNEDaya

**vayyiqra** (11): The hold that Bella Thorne's music has on me defies explanation. Science cannot answer this. It's garbage, but it is my garbage. I can't make it not go this hard.

**akanewasright** (10): Bella Thorne may not be able to sing,

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh my god…I…just…her mind HER MIND

**bluetriangles04** (10): everything about this song is INSANE. BE BE BE MY BFF.

**Carnie** (10): bella thorne deserves the career ari has

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this was my 11 when I thought we were rating the mash-up

**diamondsandglass** (10): this is, in fact, terrible, but it's also very nostalgic

**frogaranaman** (10): Bella Thorne saying "watch this 😏" then singing the worst song in existence

**jackisboredtoday** (10): I hate to give camp 10s but in this case I kinda have to because I’ve made this song into an inside joke with at least three different friends and none of us even watched the show it’s so bad and its a gift to the world

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): She definitely was struggling with all that spelling

**plastichaxan** (10): she has the mind of a mastermind

**RandomHypnotica** (10): is this what boomers hear when someone texts them LOL

**ricki** (10): the shake it up soundtrack paved the way for modern hyperpop

**seanderlust** (10): CAMP CAMP CAMP. idec if this came out this year it would be the highest placing hyperpop song on popheads' end of year top 100 tracks list

**Stryxen** (10): pussy.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): a mashup so terrible I have no choice but to 10. Also Gayle music

**throwaway-7650** (10): this + PRINDL sit at the same table of iconic disney acronyms

**missdarbusisaqueen** (9): the definition of camp. I feel like this could be a Charli song, the beat goes kinda hard

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): the remix of this and something to dance for is my jam

**slimboyfriend** (9): she knew what she was doing when she said “watch this”

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I guess Bella needed this one W over Zendaya in their solo careers

**fadedblue09** (8.5): My 12-year old self should've listened to this so that I knew what those acronyms meant

**Alumineous** (8): Okay, I’ll give Thorne a pass because she clearly cannot sing and was forced to sing alongside a person who actually could sing.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): u/songacronymbot

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): this is gonna get tanked but it’s camp asf and if Charli released it y’all would eat it up 🙄💅

**PretentiousPegasus** (8): its a fun bop but disney really mustve hated her making her spell all these words 😭

**Roxieloxie** (8): them releasing this in the era where adults really hated 'text talk ' was actually a intentionally provocative commentary on pop culture, in this essay i will

**welcome2thejam** (8): A few small changes and you can pass this off as some lost kinda quirky indie pop rock track from the late 00s/early 10s that's a clone of the Ting Tings/that one CSS "music is my boyfriend!" song

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): 2012 version of :bangbang: :cat2:

**emayzee** (7.5): the adjective of camp is thrown around so easily but this is camp

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): this is hyperpop

**TiltControls** (7.5): Is your child texting about Popheads Rates in secret? Use this guide to discover their text codes and keep them out of trouble!

**Zypker125** (7.5): Sweetie I’m so sorry that you’re gonna go out Day 1, my condolences my precious little daughter

**1998tweety** (7): its campy, not everyone will get it

**anothertown** (7): this really sounds like an ARK Music Factory joint and i like it for that. honestly if Bella hadn't gotten a deal with disney i feel like she would have signed with those jokers to make a song about bedazzling or sth

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): the way i still remember all the lyrics to this chorus even though i haven't heard it in several years yeah that's history

**agentofscranton** (6.5): very much a drag race verse extended into a full song

#IDGAF 

**followingfreeways** (6.5): this is so awful but it still gets in my head sometimes i cant lie

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): this is camp and the girls who get it, get it

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This is somehow the campiest song in the rate, on basically every metric. They don’t make them like this anymore, and that’s for a reason.

**intheaftermath** (6): i didn't know what an LMHO was when I was 10 and I still don't know now

**Rameare** (6): The mashup with Something to Dance For is a 9 tho

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I’ve been waiting for the uncensored “LMAO” version for years

**2dina3dworld** (5): this is genuinely a terrible song but it’s a 10 for pure enjoyment so I’m compromising by meeting both of those schools of thought in the middle.

**nt96** (5): I misread it as "Titty Lox"

**jsonphile** (4): if r/FellowKids was a song

**nightstar14** (4): interesting choice for someone who was also raising dislexia awareness

**indie\_fan\_** (3.5): No one will convince me that text talk sounds cool in a song

**datosabona** (3): IDK, my BFF Jill?

**runaway3212** (3): she's so quirky and new

**celladonn** (2.5): LOL

**AHSWeeknd** (2): The lack of conviction

**yearofthesoup** (2): Has a fun little guitar riff somewhere in there.

**apatel27** (1): Who even used txtspeak in 2012

**babadork** (1): WTF

**bogo** (1): it was dated on arrival and it's even more dated today

**flava** (1): I will never admit that A Dose of Buckley made any points, but if he did make a point it was putting this on his worst list

**grandmafriend** (1): wtf is this

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): a boomer wrote this

**shhhneak** (0): Bella Thorne after ruining OnlyFans income for sex workers:

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this is one of the few songs in the rate i could've legitimately seen smashing on pop radio in a just world. anyways i'm waiting for the drill song that reuses this sample

**ImADudeDuh** (6): This song was originally written as a demo for Kesha by Mike Posner and Blackbear. Wow.

---

#Woo Hoo!

**bogo** (10): oh my god the fucking blur sample is amazing, my life is better knowing this exists

**cremeebrulee** (10): damon albarn talking mad shit about songwriting as if he didn't plagiarize from btr

**fadedblue09** (10): Giving a 10 because this is the only song here where Logan wasn't done dirty

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Thinking about when Song 2 by Blur was the daily Heardle song and I was guessing this song for a good 3 tries

**Roxieloxie** (10): WOOO HOOOOOOOO the energy in my veins right now is indescribable oh my god

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): song 2 more like song who?

**bluetriangles04** (9.5): WOO HOO!!!!!!!!!! do I have to say more?

**frogaranaman** (9): literally how did they clear the "Song 2" sample I need to know

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): yes their 3OH!3 era 😩

**poppinmmolly** (9): Blur WHO???

**seanderlust** (9): snubbed from the britpop rate :(

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This bops so much harder than I remember

**bigbigbee** (8.5): That pre-chorus….MWAH

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.2): Damon Albarn is shaking

**apatel27** (8): Bropop suits them way better than everything else they've done

**celladonn** (8): I had such a visceral negative initial reaction to the song 2 interpolation but after reading that this song was originally going to be a Kesha song I warmed to it. I would love this if Kesha was singing it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): ~~Reminds me of a very dark era of music~~ nvm I changed my score I’m living for this now

**nightstar14** (8): the few drops of melanin jumped out here

**outsideeyess** (8): kesha writes bops, what can i say

**vayyiqra** (8): NO FUCKING WAY DID THEY INTERPOLATE SONG 2 BY BLUR FUCK OFF THIS SONG IS NOT REAL

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.9): Kesha washed them with her demo unfortunately

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): not the Blur sample with the generic early 2010’s beat … honestly I dig it

**1998tweety** (7.5): the down with webster energy oh wow

**Zypker125** (7.5): WOO HOO

**AHSWeeknd** (7): epitome of early 2010s music, but they made it work

**anothertown** (7): omfg not blur!! i didnt hate this tbh

**jaztinax** (7): wait this kinda slapped

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): so camp

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): BIG TIME RUSH HAD A SONG THAT SAMPLES SONG 2 AND I NEVER KNEW ABOUT IT UNTIL NOW??!?

#I don't feel heavy metal :/

**intheaftermath** (6.5): at least the chorus to *this* one is fun? BTR just seems so plain when compared with their contemporaries. I've never been a fan of One Direction but at least they had more soul than this.

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): this is a kpop song

**2dina3dworld** (6): sob what is this Blur interpolation

**CrimsonROSET** (6): the frat-brofication of btr

**missdarbusisaqueen** (6): Was not expecting a fucking Blur sample lol

**PretentiousPegasus** (6): I've never been a big fan of windows down, i think its the 'party people' line that throws me off. still ended blur with ease

**babadork** (5.8): While I complained about their other knock-offs, trying to make “Song 3” is genius.

**akanewasright** (5): I don’t know how I know this song but I had an involuntary shock reaction to this coming on

**slimboyfriend** (5): do u think Damon Albarn heard this and what does he think

**welcome2thejam** (5): Seems that invoking the powers of Mr. Worldwide gave them access to the most Pitbull-type beat I've ever heard

**nt96** (4): I know they did NOT sample Song 2 for this mid ass song

**jackisboredtoday** (3.7): not this sample…. and not it almost working until the godawful dubstep influenced pre-chorus….hopefully this at least helped fund an extra gorillaz video

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Gorillaz were robbed in High Concept Pop.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): their most competent song and 80% of the credit is due to Damon Albarn. I’m in my nightmare zone rn

**jasannn** (3): this is a bigbong song

**TiltControls** (3): why wasn't this in Indiehead's Britpop rate

**flava** (1): the flo rida, Nicki Minaj, smells like teen spirit and The Wanted mashup i never knew i never wanted

**RandomHypnotica** (1): … what the fuck

**runaway3212** (1): fuck this song

**Stryxen** (1): and they had to ruin a smash with the WOOHOO.. Be fucking for real

**jsonphile** (0): NO. No. NO. No I’m sorry why would you touch Blur - Song 2 like this??? Who thought this was a good idea?? And if Song 2 is supposed to be like a parody of grunge, is this song somehow a parody of…shitty boy band music? What a terrible song please delete

Drake Bell: **[CANCELLED]** and in prison

---

**TragicKingdom1** (9): "if you open up your miiiiind" is only one line long and yet its still one of the greatest pre-choruses of all time...that's artistry.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): First off, I just want to remind people that we were originally not gonna have this song in the rate because of the Drake Bell-ness of it all. However, enough people said that they wanted it in the rate so, we eventually put it in. So, don't cancel us! But this song is pretty classic for a 00s theme song. It's not a song I'd listen to often but it's competent. A lot of people did not like the vocals on this, and I can kinda see where they come from but it doesn't really bother me personally ~~especially compared to Drake Bell bothering me~~

---

#I Found a good song!

**Stryxen** (11): reading these youtube comments after not paying attention to disney for like a decade was 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫

**Carnie** (10): dan schneider is disgusting, drake bell is disgusting, josh peck is cringe, but here we are

**cremeebrulee** (10): we hate drake bell but unfortunately this is good

**grandmafriend** (10): drake bell is a pos but this song is too good!

**nightstar14** (10): too bad he sucks

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): this score is purely dedicated to my childhood hero, Megan <3

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): My favourite nickelodeon theme song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is kind of a wild theme song in comparison to all the others here and I love that

**ricki** (10): drake bell doesnt get t

**thegolding** (10): we really thought Drake Bell was going to be huge

**welcome2thejam** (10): Why does this have to be the power pop bop entirely inside of my wheelhouse. Hate this, an easy 11 contender if it weren't for the obvious terrible baggage

**bigbigbee** (9.5): biggest nostalgia-based score increase in the rate, hands down

**emayzee** (9.4): my favorite childhood theme song

**CrimsonROSET** (9): fuck drake bell

**followingfreeways** (9): just an absolute banger but an absolute bummer hes a pedophile

**TiltControls** (9): If only Drake Bell weren't such a POS cause I've got so many great memories of this show

**intheaftermath** (8.5): whoever wrote the harmonies on this deserves a raise

**nt96** (8.5): why must our childhoods be so tainted?

**2dina3dworld** (8): I hate that I genuinely enjoy Drake Bell’s voice because he’s so slimy and gross

**poppinmmolly** (8): I know Drake Bell is yikes but I really do like this song

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): He has the voice and criminal record of a true rockstar

**apatel27** (7): Thought this was foo fighters

**bluetriangles04** (7): never forgetting that scene where they don't carve a door out of the tree house and are just stuck there...

#Prison, honey

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): it’s not a bop but it’s not totally atrocious

**jsonphile** (7): you found a way to do what, drake? 🤨📸

**Roxieloxie** (7): this being the extended version lowkey kills it for me.

**shhhneak** (6.4): This gotta be one of the most annoying shows here but this kind of snapped in a U2/Dave Matthews/Goo Goo Dolls kind of way.

**plastichaxan** (6): Drake Bell you need to be dealt with

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I never realized how… Chad Kroger-esque Drake’s vocals were

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): i just dont care about this at all

**yearofthesoup** (5.4): Honestly ruined by Drake Bell's creepiness

**datosabona** (5): This was my first time listening to the full song and I honestly hate everything besides the chorus

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): he found a way (to go to jail)

**1998tweety** (4): no thanks

**Zypker125** (3): D&J were just before my time unfortunately

**AHSWeeknd** (2): This was way too overhyped

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Now HOW did I not notice until now that he has straight up buttrock vocals on this? Chad Kroeger sweetie…

**fadedblue09** (2): sounds like a Chad Kroeger reject

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Didn’t like this as a kid, still don’t like it now.

**vayyiqra** (2): This is going to get tanked because it's Drake Bell but also he is a bad singer

**akanewasright** (1): isn’t it nice when bad people make bad music?

**bogo** (1): fuck drake bell

**CarlieScion** (1): NO

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): misandry

**flava** (1): so glad the singer doesn’t actually exist and they got Chad Kroeger and a random guy off the street to sing it

**runaway3212** (1): fuck you drake bell

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): now find a way to make it good

**babadork** (0): I was all set to go with Bella Thorne for my 0, because that song is much more awful than this one. However, I feel very uncomfortable listening to this and want to get it over with as soon as possible.

**throwaway-7650** (0): I listen to singers I very rarely listen to people who can't sing

CAMP ROCK: *clap clap*

---

**ImADudeDuh** (7): This works better for me than We Rock because it's more fun. It's not a "let's be happy together!" song. It's a "FUCK YOU, WE'RE BETTER" song.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): slightly better than its most similar song (We Rock) but similarly annoying. i will say that it does capture "annoying theater/band kid jam session" which is probably what it was going for

---

#Turned on

**1998tweety** (10): me when someone asks whats the title track from BTS - Map Of The Soul 7

**CarlieScion** (10): CLAP CLAP CAMP ROCK!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): me about the oven everytime i leave the house

**intheaftermath** (10): now this! is real music! This song is so energizing!!! It's On!!! It's On!!! It is, in fact, On!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): would be an 11 contender if the whole song was just the guys rapping

**thegolding** (10): Demi and the other guys dancing a few minutes before this song will be written down on history books

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): CAMP ROCK!

**welcome2thejam** (9): Bleh at times, but I'll definitely come down on defending this. If this soundtracked the opening video package to some late 2000s NBA on ABC game, I would jam a bit

**akanewasright** (8.5): they went so hard for the theme song of one of the very worst DCOMs

**2dina3dworld** (8): this is the second song called It’s On I’ve rated this cycle… this is better than Korn’s It’s On ngl

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun! I know we only met, but let’s pretend it’s love!

**bluetriangles04** (8): ready or not here i come, i like your face do you like my song

**fadedblue09** (8): Mostly okay but this really shows that Demi is the only one who can actually sing here

**jaztinax** (8): camp rock totally won that one

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.8): but why are we not rating the Camp Rock chant

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): requesting Deja Vu by Beyoncé as a shitpost song because of this intro

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): eat tbh

**Alumineous** (7): I honestly expected more... I guess anger? given their cringey entrance.

**vayyiqra** (7): Oh no I kind of like a Camp Rock song

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I’m expecting to see that one marching video many times in the reveal

#Turn it off

**datosabona** (6.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8KyuPiLYFA

**apatel27** (6): The chorus is ripped straight from Shut Up and Drive but that makes it decent

**runaway3212** (6): hsmtmts outsold

**slimboyfriend** (6): idk at least Demi’s grown into their voice more

**shhhneak** (5.1): Disney Channel music videos during commercial breaks shaped my music taste for years.

**AHSWeeknd** (5): wish I could turn it off

**bogo** (5): i'd say they ended korn but that's a very low bar to clear and not that impressive

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): this is whatever

**frogaranaman** (5): this at least has the fact that it's funny in retrospect running for it

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5): DRUMS👹, a little guitar please 🥺

**nightstar14** (5): camp rock 2 was a flop

**Roxieloxie** (5): the actual war flashbacks i get hearing this song. Like this  song plagued us every commercial break. Its not terrible but it goes on for FAR too long.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): it's off

**flava** (4): Disney hire a proper mixing team

**Zypker125** (4): This song gives me “overly cheerful YMCA summer camp counselor” vibes.

**seanderlust** (3.5): what if this was a korn cover

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): This sounds so forced :\

**jsonphile** (3): maybe turn it off 🤷‍♀️

Terrible country songs that this inspired: at least 12

---

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Insane how she predicted 1. that country artists would attempt to infuse hip-hop into their songs in increasingly embarassing fashion, 2. that she would add a little hip-hop to herself in order to try to break from her old image, also in increasingly embarassing fashion.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): ice cream freeze is the superior hannah memetana song!!!!

---

#It's a hoe banger

**anothertown** (10): you had to be there i guess..

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Why does that crowd doing the call and response kind of sound like they’re shouting from Hades?

**bogo** (10): listening to this song at 9:45 pm is an indescribable and very special experience that almost completely broke me and drove me to tears. 10/10

**CarlieScion** (10): song demographic consisting only of people aged 5 or 82

**CrimsonROSET** (10): POP IT LOCK IT POLKA DOT IT

**nightstar14** (10): my hoe beginnings

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): i definitely learned the choreo for this

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): The ultimate status symbol in 2009 was knowing the choreo word for word and i havent been able to forget

**ricki** (10): taylor swift was on set when this was recorded and i just know she feared for her career at that moment

**Roxieloxie** (10): now this shit right here??? this is the hannah era I loose my shit for. I think the movie soundtrack and Hannnah Montana 3 are the ones I had the physical CDs for and I think it really shows in my scoring. I remember attempting to learn the dance for this but just giving up cause it was too many steps

**runaway3212** (10): is that character actress margo martindale?

**seanderlust** (10): iconic. invented line dances. boom clap boom dee clap dee clap.

**Stryxen** (10): https://tenor.com/view/hello-kitty-hello-kitty-dancing-hello-kitty-meme-hello-kitty-dancing-meme-gif-24009093

**throwaway-7650** (10): CATCH IT @ TAYLOR SWIFT

**plastichaxan** (9.5): Hoe down??? Someone help her

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): Sydney Sweeney anthem ❤️

**1998tweety** (8): yes we did learn the dance to this

**akanewasright** (8): idc it’s camp

**bluetriangles04** (8): BOOM DE CLAP DE CLAP! ENDED CHARLI!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): corny but I’m nostalgic [2]

**intheaftermath** (8): is this actually a good song? no, not really. am i nostalgic for when my kindergarten class performed this for our parents? it's a possibility.

**jasannn** (8): yeehaw?

**jaztinax** (8): to this day i still don’t know quite what “hip-hop it” means

**xxipil0ts** (8): You guys this is wild. An innocent celebration for my moms milestone 60th birthday has turned into an absurd political statement, which was not the intention. Please stop making assumptions. Much love to everyone ♥️ and Happy Birthday Mom!

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): the girls in middle school who memorized this dance were my American heroes

**Alumineous** (7): Hoe? In MY family friendly Disney Channel programming?

**datosabona** (7): was everyone else also forced to learn this dance at some point in their lives

#I'm ready to throwdown against miley cyrus

**bigbigbee** (6.5): My preferred brand of country is the type where the singer sounds like they’ve lived for 60 years in a town with a failing coal mine, but this is fun

**TiltControls** (6.5): when you and your friend are fighting over the same guy at the club

**AHSWeeknd** (6): All the annoying white girls learned the moves to this dance.

**diamondsandglass** (6): I vividly remember trying to learn this dance

**welcome2thejam** (6): Honestly, low bar but a million times better than I expected

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): god damn tiktok hits 🙄

**apatel27** (5): The dance doesn't make sense

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5): crowley corners kinda lit ngl

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): I tried to do this at a middle school dance and definitely deserved to be bullied for that

**Zypker125** (4): I’d be lying if I said I didn’t obey the lyrics like the sheep I am

**shhhneak** (3): “you get to 4 5 6 and feeling busted”

**frogaranaman** (2): OKAY SO!!!!!!! I got made fun of for an hour because I didn't know this song very well when it came on during a grade school dance party and it hurt my feelings

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Pop it, lock it, polka dot it, countrify AND hip-hop it?! Now that’s just excessive.

**jsonphile** (2): what is this awful mixing of country and hip hop? Mixing those two will never work. Look what you brought upon us Billy Ray Cyrus. God can you imagine what it’d be like if he was on a song that mixed country and hip hop? It would never work! It would be a total flop!!

**thedoctordances1940** (2): ☹

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): I’ll do the no-down

**yearofthesoup** (2): extremely annoying

**missdarbusisaqueen** (1.5): Again, iconic but grating. I loved it in 4th grade though, we all learned the dance lmao

**babadork** (1.1): I knew the song from jokes that Hannah Montana paved the way for bro country, but I had never heard the song to know they were true until now.

**DefaultPophead** (1): Almost was my zero.

**flava** (1): maybe i dont like country music after all

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): i-

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): surprisingly I found something I like less than Introducing Me

**2dina3dworld** (0): I hate this song in an anti-nostalgia way and I don’t know why. Something to do with my sister??? Idk my memory of being a kid is blurry but I heard this again and cringed so hard. Like this song sounds so obnoxiously brocountry while simultaneously making me feel like I’m being shouted at by my PE teacher for not being able to keep up. Bad vibes all around.

**fadedblue09** (0): The ancestor of Bangerz and Younger Now [derogatory]

**nt96** (0): this is the bastard child of Achy Breaky Heart

**vayyiqra** (0): I knew from the title I would hate this and I was right. This is unbearable.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Listen, I have no memories of this movie, but this song is sooo good. Maybe it's just because I like Grease so listening to a high school version of people pretending to be in the 50s is just charming to me. Also, "bubblegum, cherry pop, go to the hop" has been stuck in my head since the rate started.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): very blatant Grease homage/pastiche/rip but it's a lot of fun!! also the best drums in the rate

---

#Make me wanna roll my windows down and cruuuise

**babadork** (11): Did someone forget to tell Butchy’s pecs he was in a Disney movie?

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Love it. I always enjoy the aesthetic of a beach more than going to the beach.

**apatel27** (10): It's fun

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this does not have the right to be this good

**plastichaxan** (10): cruising???? wrapped in leather??? okay gay rights

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): Ugh Ross Lynch is so hot

**ricki** (10): there was no reason for every person in this cast to be insanely hot. i was 13 watching this with my dad and going through feelings i hadnt before

**Roxieloxie** (10): I wanted to be so mean to this but I cant lie that seeing the video for it in the movie made me really like. TBM came out in the void period where i was getting too old^TM for disney and also we didnt have cable, but i remember this from the trailers. I would've been obsessed with this if i heard it at the time

**runaway3212** (10): idc they went way too hard for what this movie

**throwaway-7650** (10): I can't take anyone who dislikes/hates this seriously

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.6): never seen this movie in my life but this slaps im afraid

**celladonn** (9): I've never seen this movie before but this did kind of make me want to watch it

**diamondsandglass** (9): this is so fucking cheesy I love it

**intheaftermath** (9): club penguin Teen Beach Movie Party my beloved

**nightstar14** (9): so fucking good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): wait this slays so much

**thegolding** (9): i'm gay I can't avoid thinking about a certain thing with the same name sorry. Def wanna go cruisin' with Ross lmao

**anothertown** (8): what ross lynch is doing in this song you can barely call singing. and yet his lack of breath control is startling

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): a bop i fear

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): is this the elvis biopic

**welcome2thejam** (8): Tearing up the sock hop with this ditty

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): desperately wish the song was a bit better because the sets, the faux-retro style, the choreography, everything surrounding this looks SO camp & fun

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): surfer bro music core but I'm not complaining

#Please STOP! STOP! the music

**1998tweety** (7): its too country

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): yeah the performance of this song made me fall in love with Ross LOL

**Zypker125** (6.7): This sounds like the most manufactured and processed Kidz Bop song ever and I can’t decide if that’s a bad thing or a good thing

**akanewasright** (6.5): The only part of this song that I remembered from watching this years ago was Ross Lynch inserting himself into the song and squeaking out “cruisin for some lOvin”

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): good god that first voice is absolutely AWFUL

**Alumineous** (6): You mean gay cruising, wait what

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Teen Beach Movie you seem very innocent but tbh I think you’re gonna get more than bruised in this rate.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): when you want to cover grease lighting but 6 year olds are watching

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): Florida Georgia Line feat. Gwen Stefani????

**followingfreeways** (5): this franchise is way past my disney days so i have never seen this movie nor do i have any nostalgic connection to these songs so i am sorry

**jaztinax** (5): what does cruisin for a bruisin even mean

**jsonphile** (5): look if I wanted to hear watered down 50s music I’d listen to Grease

**cremeebrulee** (4): im so confused are they looking to get hickies or something

**indie\_fan\_** (4): Junior Year of High School, our English Teacher had our group record a film based on stuff from the 1950's. I had to unironically say "Cruisin for a Bruisin" while wearing a leather jacket in 80 degree heat and slick back hair pretending to be a fan of Elvis. This song reminds me of that awful memory.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): I feel like I’d hear this in a Disney Parks hotel commercial

**bigbigbee** (3.5): I don’t think that the songwriter had a really firm grasp on what cruising for a bruisin’ means…it’s not really something that people try to do intentionally

**Ghost-Quartet** (3.5): This is Elvis pastiche and I hate Elvis, so

**frogaranaman** (3): yea there was a reason why I hated this movie's beginning

**vayyiqra** (3): Ew is this trying to be an unholy mix of rock'n'roll and pop-punk because this sounds like a song from Grease

**bogo** (2): somewhere chuck berry is rolling in his grave

**yearofthesoup** (1.2): Listening to this as a 31 year old feels very wrong but I guess good on them for not overdoing the tinkly piano parts.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): I was a theater kid but maybe we should invent time travel to go back and cancel Shakespeare so this song doesn’t happen

**flava** (1): this might’ve worked if any of them had a drop of charisma

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Very surprised to see this song so low. This was never my *favorite* song but Troy giving his all for this inner monologue/team hype song. It's a bit melodramatic, but it's a requirement for every Troy solo song to be as melodramatic as possible.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): if you squint your ears closely you can hear justin timberlake - senorita. we could've left this out tbh

#Head's in the game

**plastichaxan** (10): the way this was my least favorite song as a kid the misandry signs were always there

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): when his head in the game but heart in the song :(

**RandomHypnotica** (10): so many songs use bed squeaking noises, but how many use shoe sqeaking?

**runaway3212** (10): come through gay undertones

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): maybe its cause im doing this rate at 2:30 but this is doing it for me right now. I thought i was gonna give this one a lower score but the moment i heard the sounds of the shoes on the floor i knew it was over.

**welcome2thejam** (9): High School Musical talking about the importance of shooting the outside J while Steph Curry was still *in* high school... they truly had their head in the game

**emayzee** (8.9): i felt very seen bc this came out right when i was in the midst of my short-lived "sporty" phase

**bluetriangles04** (8.5): how straight can we make playing with balls challenge accepted

**AHSWeeknd** (8): The intro to this was peak Disney.

**akanewasright** (8): thinking of the Bella Thorne cover

**nightstar14** (8): this is why i am straight

**nt96** (8): the Timberlake energy of it all

**ricki** (8): i dont have enough time to explain but this song is actually a metaphor about queerness having to mask it from society

**babadork** (7.9): I’m definitely overrating this because I love a dance number.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): “why I am feeling so wrong? My head’s in the game, but my heart’s in the song” is honestly a top 10 lyric idc

**seanderlust** (7.5): yeah i love sports! the sports:

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): https://youtu.be/owBOHG8_s8g

**CrimsonROSET** (7): how’s your headgame

**datosabona** (7): corbin bleu’s armpit hair is forever seared into my brain

#Heart's in the song :brokenheart:

**jsonphile** (7): honestly not one of my favorite songs from HSM but please do yourself a favor and watch this https://youtu.be/HorRCT9gqio

**Zypker125** (7): They should make it mandatory to play this song during team warmups before a basketball game

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I was never a huge fan of this song because it’s about sports :/

**throwaway-7650** (6.1): finding out that zac efron was mostly lip syncing to drew seeley's voice in this movie destroyed me. in this essay I will-

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): Basketball vs Theater is the hardest challenge we've ever had depicted in cinema

**vayyiqra** (6): Bet Popheads will love this song about playing sports in high school

**yearofthesoup** (6): it's camp

**jasannn** (5.5): I wish we got more HSM3 songs instead of this.

**PretentiousPegasus** (5): snooze

**TiltControls** (5): It's catchy, but it's always grated on me a little

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): A song about sports, truly this will do well with the popheads crowd

**apatel27** (4): That has to be the most pathetic dance break

**intheaftermath** (4): it's so... squeaky...

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): didn’t you say 10 seconds ago musicals are lamest thing ever

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): ugh the dribbling as part of the beat…revolutionized pop but I just can’t vibe with drew seeley 😭

**flava** (2.5): this one just doesn’t sound good, even remotely

**bogo** (1): this sounds like it could be an NCT song and i mean that with the highest disrespect possible

**fadedblue09** (1): I hate sports

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): Always hated this one.

**missdarbusisaqueen** (1): No.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Fuck Harry Styles, unoriginal, ugly bitch.

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): the part that harry ripped off is great but the rest feels really cluttered. there's a lot of songs in this rate that have forced rap segments and this is the worst offender

#E to the X to the C E P, T to the I to the O N A L

**1998tweety** (10): ICONIC

**anothertown** (10): lashawna ball ofc

**nt96** (10): oh this is exceptional all right

**throwaway-7650** (10): I actually really liked the opening sequence of A.N.T. farm

**followingfreeways** (9): ant farm was on at the very tail end of my disney years so i didnt watch it a lot but i never stopped shaking my ass to this song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): A.N.T. Farm was one of the shows that came out right when I aged out of the Disney Channel demographic so it’s the last one I kinda watched, and I remember disliking the theme song. Listening to the full version back though, I’m not sure why because this is super cute and uplifting.

**intheaftermath** (9): I do not want to think about the ego boost this show gave me from being in the gifted and talented programming

**NecroDolphinn** (9): The scat version deserved a spot in the rate

**bogo** (8): i wouldn't say this song is exceptional but it's a good one

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this was in my head for weeks after i first heard it

**fadedblue09** (8): I used to think this was one of the most meh Disney themes so it's a surprise to hear the soulful, funky verses

**vayyiqra** (8): I love funk music

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): the spelling was a little overkill

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): why do you need to spell it out I thought these were super smart kids

**2dina3dworld** (7): this song used to give me a really  unjustified ego boost, individualism is a curse.

**akanewasright** (7): This is better as a full song than I’d expected

**bluetriangles04** (7): this show was kind of the end of an era for me, after this I didn't watch disney as much and anything post this is kinda past my age funnily enough

**TiltControls** (7): A new spelling queen?

#Except you

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): i was gonna make a comment for this but an earthquake literally just hit as i'm finishing this up so i forgor what i was gonna say

**grandmafriend** (6.8): cute!

**datosabona** (6.5): very repetitive and kind of boring

**frogaranaman** (6): I THOUGHT THIS WAS A DESPICABLE ME SONG

**jsonphile** (6): maybe exceptional is too long of a word to spell in a song

**Zypker125** (5.3): Contrary to its title, this song is very middling.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Exceptionally Evangelical apparently.

**diamondsandglass** (5): the production of this makes it sounds like a Target ad

**flava** (5): …not

**runaway3212** (5): kinda nothing

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): this should be really more captivating for a theme song I feel like

**welcome2thejam** (5): Good voice, decent sounding, the track itself doesn't stand out at all though

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): meh

**Alumineous** (3): All this showed me is that she definitely could do whistle notes if she tried because girl, I see the potential.

**Stryxen** (3): come on jess glynne

**apatel27** (2): It's gonna annoy me so much that I can't place where the chorus is ripped from (it's an Emeli Sande song)

#Traumatized by Pilgrim Harry

**Roxieloxie** (10): the night harrys home dropped i remember ANT FARM was trending and it was just after finished it and i spent like 10 minutes trying to figure out what I had missed

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): ended that poorly dressed man

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.1): harry styles is shaking in his ruby slippers

**plastichaxan** (8): Harry Styles you will be dealt with (hopefully not on Ultimate Rate)

**PretentiousPegasus** (8): China Anne McClain could build a House and make sushi or whatever but Harry Styles could NOT do this

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): can’t believe Harry Styles stole from this queen

**outsideeyess** (7): i love music for a sushi restaurant

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.5): exceptional >>>> music for a sushi restaurant

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Queen of having the ability to be sampled

**jasannn** (6): harry styles popped off

**nightstar14** (6): HARRY YOU AINT SNEAKY

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): If the hosts don’t play Music for a Sushi Restaurant after this is revealed I stg

Times when they said her name: uhhh...hmmm..... fuck, truth be told, I never learned how to count

---

**ImADudeDuh** (9): China Anne Mcclain getting 4 songs in this rate, which is more than Selena Gomez, is crazy. That being said, this is probably the most convincing/good villain song out of the 4 Descendants songs I have listened to. Maybe it's the sword sound effects, maybe it's China's voice herself, maybe it's that this isn't produced like absolute trash.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): WHATS IT! WHATS IT! SAY IT! SAY IT! this is the rotten to the core of the sequel

---

#Oh na na, whats my name?

**1998tweety** (10): we love priyanka, also the man who raps is HOT

**AHSWeeknd** (10): that Scottish part threw me off but this is overall really good

**Alumineous** (10): You better come through, China!

**fadedblue09** (10): Why is China not a main pop girl

**nt96** (10): I swear if this doesn't make it to top 5....

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): This needs to go top 10 because China ate this one DOWN

**Roxieloxie** (10): now this is a SLAY.  No one else could've saved this like it needed China and she did what she needed to do.

**runaway3212** (10): a girlboss with her malewives

**thegolding** (10): This is nowadays Gimme More

**welcome2thejam** (10): How many bad songs did I hear in the k-pop rates that tried for this exact sound and just got run out by Disney's Descendants sequel

**jasannn** (9): ateez-core

**vayyiqra** (9): this is future bass

**datosabona** (8.5): would have been much higher without the weird chanting

**Zypker125** (8.5): Descendants 2 was easily the best DCOM and I’ll die on this hill

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.2): you could tell me this was a kpop song and i'd believe you. and i'd eat it up. i wanna hear the ateez remix of this song now

**celladonn** (8): the scottish accent rap was kind of a serve i won't lie

**CrimsonROSET** (8): onana

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): yeah idc China absolutely mopped this

**jaztinax** (8): outsold riri

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): this franchise seems actively bad but China Anne did not have to go so hard here

**throwaway-7650** (8): love china but where are her SOLO songs... #misandry

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I was digging this until the rap. China sweetie you deserve better

**akanewasright** (7): This is just China Anne McClain doing a blackpink song… and honestly I’d rather listen to her than lisa so this gets a few more points

**apatel27** (7): The way they put Uma into it was cool

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is at least just as good as the Rihanna song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): are we gonna talk about Thomas Doherty’s arms in the video, or

**intheaftermath** (7): not as strong as other songs in this film but also not the worst. Have you ever heard China Ann Mcclain's cover of Poor Unfortunate Souls that was released for this film? Don't. It's THAT atrocious.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): NOT THE SCOTTISH RAP LMFAOOOO

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): China is so talented she deserves a bigger career outside Disney

**TheQueenofVultures** (6.9): oh na na

#You just can't take it, the day I made it

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): the way this was gonna get a genuinely high score until the rap came in… DCOMs shouldn’t attempt to pull off that kind of rap they clearly aren’t equipped for it

**jsonphile** (6): Uma is not an ominous enough name for a song like this

**plastichaxan** (6): Rihanna in that one song

**shhhneak** (5.5): Seeing the balding British guy from the new Gossip Girl in intense eyeliner was a major jump scare.

**slimboyfriend** (5): at least she can sing

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Blackpink have been trying to make this song for years….. I mean they actually HAVE made this song for years, but they tried to do it too

**yearofthesoup** (5): I have no memories of this song after listening to it multiple times.

**cremeebrulee** (4.5): if this outdoes the rihanna song i will be furious

**nightstar14** (4): calling all the monsters will never be topped

**bogo** (3.5): what the fuck is this series

**seanderlust** (3.5): finally, an answer to the question we have all been asking ourselves: what if BLACKPINK were entirely the same but LISA was a middle-aged Scottish man

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): I blame her parents for naming her Uma

**static\_int\_husp** (2.5): that rap is... interesting

**bluetriangles04** (2): these verses are ass im so sorry AND THAT CHANTING?

**flava** (2): please just stop, this isn’t even a Rihanna ripoff but a ripoff of a ripoff of Rihanna

**RandomHypnotica** (2): a shame she got amnesia so young

**ricki** (2): jesy nelson debut single

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): china anne mcclain should be glad she has a great voice because that’s literally the only thing saving this from being a 1

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): rihanna outforgot her name

**frogaranaman** (1): WHAT is with the pirate in the background of the album cover

**Stryxen** (1): ?

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): i could weirdly see phoebe bridgers covering this (or at least the first verse)

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Very ironic for a song like this to be so forgettable.

---

#NEVER FORGET

**agentofscranton** (10): it was really that serious like i thought my world was gonna fall apart fr

**intheaftermath** (10): I haven't watched this film since I was really little but the heartbreak was still there :(

**ricki** (10): The first taste of heartbreak and depression I experienced was when I saw Miley go into her closet and look through her old Hannah clothes as this was playing.

**thegolding** (10): it's been 11 years and this song makes me cry non-stop this is gorgeous

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I didn’t even grow up with this and I felt sad anyway so points

**shhhneak** (8): My graduation song was A Thousand Years I want a refund.

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): Last day of camp vibes

**xxipil0ts** (8): if there was anything disney did was that they made the finale for Hannah Montana as memorable as it is.

**grandmafriend** (7.8): is it even possible to not get nostalgic from this?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I love how much noticeably better her voice has gotten since the show started, like she served vocals when she didn’t need to

**bogo** (7): gonna be honest here, i probably won't do the same. but good job

**fadedblue09** (7): surprisingly decent

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): meh

**slimboyfriend** (7): I’m sure Miley was happy the Disney stuff was over, but this song makes me a little teary eyed because it’s like she’s saying goodbye to my childhood

#[note to self, remember to write something funny here later]

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): I’d rather have sung this in school assemblies over the Climb… at least this one wouldn’t require 400+ girls to do a sustained high note for fifteen seconds

**AHSWeeknd** (6): This soundtrack had some better tracks.

**frogaranaman** (6): obligatory emotional climax of the film

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I’m sorry Hannah but this is boring af

**nt96** (5.5): I don't know her

**jackisboredtoday** (5.1): this way

**akanewasright** (5): Wherever I Go was a better going away ballad I fear

**Alumineous** (5): This is giving me “A Moment Like This” vibes. So it’s shit! Also, hands up if your middle school used this as the graduation song.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Not this B grade graduation song fodder.

**Roxieloxie** (5): i didnt watch season 4 so this is doing nothing for me so im gonna have to be balladphobic

**Stryxen** (5): i’m probably not going to remember you

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): she’s giving vocal slayage but the song itself is pretty meh

**babadork** (4.7): I feel a little bad because someone probably has a comment about how they used to listen to this and cry when they were twelve, but this is boring.

**apatel27** (4): Insert nostalgia comment here

**missdarbusisaqueen** (4): I love ballads but this one is a snoozefest

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): snooze

**yearofthesoup** (4): ironically this song is wholly forgettable and I'm sure I'm not the only one who will make this joke

**TiltControls** (3): I wish I could say the same about the song when it finishes

**Zypker125** (2.6): After listening to this song, maybe it would be better not to be remembered at all.

**flava** (2): you need power for your power ballads, not Miley cyrus

**vayyiqra** (1): So boring

Music: in my soul

---

**ImADudeDuh** (8): It's alright.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): despite not having seen camp rock this definitely breached my consciousness back in 2008. it definitely bops but kinda feels like the same riff on loop for 3 minutes

---

#Let's play!

**ignitethephoenix** (11): classic! Also upon another relisten this is truly one of the best songs in the rate and would stand on its own as a normal Jo Bros track

**akanewasright** (10): Disney had a video of this song set to [Mickey Mouse clips](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqbqDx1WtOo) and I found these buggers too damn charming

**cremeebrulee** (10): me shuffling my 11s playlist <3

**nightstar14** (10): shane gray owns my ass

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): The absolute chokehold this had me in for years is insane

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me looping a song im obsessed with 200 times in a week

**Roxieloxie** (10): i love this song so much. Its so lovely, another 11 contender thats fighting for my heart. I remember how much id try and rig the pandora algorithm on my nook to try and get this to play all the time

**emayzee** (9.3): jonas brothers circa 2006-2009 > the beatles

**AHSWeeknd** (9): This is a product of its time but they always killed it

**ricki** (9): this is spiritually taking the place of drake bell's i found a way [edit: i later found out that IFAW was indeed in the rate]

**thegolding** (9): listening to the JB singing this song did things on my body ngl

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**bigbigbee** (8.5): Cheesy but they’re actually right about music…it DOES make you whole

**plastichaxan** (8.5): misandry cured for 3 minutes i could not believe it

**anothertown** (8): i have been known to bop to this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I also stan music as a concept.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): wish they were still making music this good

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): Joe Jonas is mine

**seanderlust** (8): so what you're saying is music make you lose control music make you lose control LET'S GO

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): Jonas Brothers’ haircuts need to be spoken about more

**Alumineous** (7): Okay, I warmed up to this song, it’s not that bad. But for having a rock father, he must be very disappointed in his nephews/sons.

**jsonphile** (7): this was my favorite song from the movie when I was a kid because this was the cool rock song 😎😎😎 Yeah. I thought the Jonas brothers were rock music.

#This shit better not get into my soul

**runaway3212** (7): jonas brother stop using your looks to get me to raise your

**slimboyfriend** (7): You can tell with the Jonas Brothers’ camp rock songs that they’re a little more experienced with recording a good song compared to……. Everyone else.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I’m embarrassed to say Kevin was my favorite… I give you all full permission to clown me

**babadork** (6.5): This is generic, except for that last little “yeah” at the end. I assume whatever Jonas made that noise deeply regrets it, but it’s great.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Catchy but the generic faux-emo vocal grunts are annyoing

**jasannn** (6.5): MEEEEWWWWWSIGGGG

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): extremely replacement-level Jonas Brothers single to fill the role of “song for a music-themed movie”

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this is in the wrong category this is a big time rush song

**nt96** (6): it ok I guess

**shhhneak** (6): They were lucky I found them cute.

**Zypker125** (6): This is what I imagine is the kids version of heavy metal

**bogo** (5.5): bless them they're trying so hard to hit those notes

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): at some point it started to sound like that video of 1d what makes you beautiful where it's edited to just repeat the "you're insecure" line

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): what in the AJR

**thedoctordances1940** (5): i mean i guess it's camp but also not

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): generic

**LesApfels** (4): Play something else

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): still better than most of the jonas brothers’ recent music

**apatel27** (3): It's noisy but not in a good way

**flava** (3): kinda hate all these real music songs

**welcome2thejam** (3): Jonas Brothers hard carry, which is a crazy thing to say, but wow these are some terribly generic lyrics

**TiltControls** (2.5): no <3

**intheaftermath** (2): This one commits the heinous crime of being forgettable. Could not even remember a line after listening to it for this rate.

**frogaranaman** (1): this is an AJR song before AJR was a thing

**Stryxen** (1): these vocals are horrific

**throwaway-7650** (1): the jobros should be grateful to drake bell for stealing my 0

Zypker125: Some thoughts on the Day 1 results:

* Was completely blindsided by Introducing Me being last place by that big a margin, I myself didn't like the song but I was sure that there were other songs that were going to occupy the bottom.

* I'm pretty shocked that Big Time Rush didn't completely tank in the results, I figured they'd mostly go out early Day 1 because "r/popheads hates male artists lolol" + "they give off One Direction boy band vibes and there's no way popheads likes that kind of music".

* I was also surprised TTYLXOX lasted that long, I was confident it was going to be last place (we'll take it though).

* So many of the songs I gave a 7+ were eliminated today and so many of the songs I gave <5 are still in the rate, I'm not ready to see my negative correlation with another rate.

* The Descendants slander in the rate was tragic, I guess it was to be expected given "new school Disney bad and old school Disney good lolol", but it still hurt to see, especially the slander of the talk-chant-raps.

* All the Victorious and Lemonade Mouth songs are still in, pog

* Gonna wrap this in a spoiler tag in case anyone wants to avoid seeing slander of their childhood: >!Praying now that most of the HSM, Hannah Montana, and Cheetah Girls songs go out on Day 2. Also I know that Gotta Go My Own Way is the likely rate favorite but uh, I gave it a 2 and wouldn't mind seeing it eliminated by some prayer of imagination, along with all of the HSM songs that have Sharpay in it!<
