#THIS RATE IS CLOSED. REVEALING 9/16-9/18

---

Hello, people born between 1993 - 2005. Welcome to the [Live Action Disney Channel/Nickelodeon Rate!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/396894460128133130/1004028893625335808/LiveActionDisneyNick.png) We are your hosts /u/ImADudeDuh /u/TragicKingdom1 and /u/napsandnetflix 

Disney Channel and Nickelodeon were fixtures for children’s entertainment since the late 1980s. Children from the 80s to the 2010s all enjoyed their programming, and kids today still enjoy it too (if their parents own the streaming service that acquired that channel anyway). But let me take you back to the early 2000s. Disney Channel and Nickelodeon often made tv shows and tv movies for kids, but around here, they realized they weren’t content with kids watching them on TV or owning them on DVDs. They needed them to also buy their CDs. And how do they attempt to do it? By filling their shows and movies with BOPS!

In this rate, we will be critically examining these songs designed to be appealing to children and/or launch their young actors into having a career in music that they can capitalize off of (you know, normal chronically online behavior).

The Rules ^TM which are copy and pasted from every other previous host. 

* **Listen to every song listed!** You can NOT skip any!  
* Give **EVERY song a score between one (1) and ten (10)**. Decimal points are allowed, but only to one place (ex. 6.4 is acceptable, but not 6.46).  
* You may give **one song a zero (0)** and **one song an eleven (11)**. These should be reserved for your favorite track and least favorite track, however it is not required to use them. **If you do use either your zero (0) or your eleven (11), it is strongly encouraged to leave a comment on the track.** It can be as short or as long as you want.  
* Please use the prepared link or the pastebin format to submit your scores! That is the only form of ballot we will accept. We spent a lot of time and effort on it, so please use it.  
* Note: if you're trying to access on a mobile device or on the new reddit layout, it may not work; we have made it so the link will take you to old.reddit.com, so you should use a computer to send in your scores (if possible)!  
* If you desire to change any of the scores after you have already submitted them, simply message this account and we will be glad to help!  
* If we believe your scores include any form of sabotage (which is pretty fucking weird since these are just songs from children’s television programs) we reserve the right to ask you to change them or your ballot will be denied. Sabotage will be defined as extremely low overall average(s) that show a clear bias against certain shows or the rate as a whole. If you truly hate the songs given low scores, we strongly encourage you to write comments on them. This indicates to us that you are not trying to rig the results, meaning everything will go smoothly. :)
* Your scores should not be considered confidential! Don't be afraid to share them. Campaign for your favorite song to get elevens or always bring up your “hot take” that *that* one song is actually garbage, so people shouldn't expect it to make the top 5.  

---

###Commenting Guideline

It is also highly encouraged that you add a comment to your song ratings! Do this by adding a space after the score and then typing to your heart's desire, like this:

> Freak the Freak Out: 10 #LetVictoriaJusticeSayFuck2022

Any format other than this is **NOT** good and we will be slightly annoyed if we have to ask you to change your comment format. This includes:

> Determinate: 10: Wen king of rap!

> Dynamite: BTS’s Dynamite is so much better! 3.

> Fabulous: I’m giving this song an 11 because im gay.

> About You Now = 10, she ended the Sugarbabes

> Windows Down (10) Windows down, A/C with the coolin system

If you’d like to comment on a franchise’s songs or the franchise as a whole, you can by adding a colon “:” to the franchise. It should look like this

> Franchise: Camp Rock: She’s really good!
