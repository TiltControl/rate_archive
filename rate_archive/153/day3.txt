Births to this song: at least 1

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): so this was definitely a rejected HSM Basketball song right? Then why was this so much better than Get'cha Head in the Game?? This was another song where that lawnmower move lived rent free in my head before understanding the concept of "rent".

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): i just know this was originally written as an HSM basketball song

---

#Unlimited joy!

**indie\_fan\_** (11): whooo chile this just unlocked some good ass memories I had buried deep within

**jackisboredtoday** (11): godly song from the most underrated of DCOMs

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A serious bop

**frogaranaman** (10): he was so real for this

**jaztinax** (10): corbin secured the bag with this one

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Corbin Bleu was, is, and will always be a king. He deserves his 300 Wikipedia pages. He was and is hotter and more talented than Zac Efron btw

**RandomHypnotica** (10): im POSITIVE this was just a cut hsm song that they turned into a whole new movie

**Roxieloxie** (10): THE SMASHA !!!!!! The way this song isnt even the movie but its just that good that I never questioned it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): what a fucking anthem

**thegolding** (10): Corbin Bleu (along with Ashley Tisdale) deserved the success Disney allowed other artists to have

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): cuz we in it to win it oh yeah!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): ok fellow half-Jamaican bestie, go off

**shhhneak** (9.3): A truly underrated DCOM. I thought I would have a career in jump rope that spring.

**grandmafriend** (9.1): absolutely underrated bop

**anothertown** (9): huge bop

**Carnie** (9): catchy as hell

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Oh now THIS was a bop. Better than almost every Zac Efron track

**welcome2thejam** (9): Cool bridge with the bucket drums

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): snapped

**emayzee** (8.6): a king

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): salt’n’pepa outsold

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): this song is still on my gym playlist LMAO

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): honestly slay

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wait this wasn’t in high school musical

**nightstar14** (8): early disney was so fucking good

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): The intro of this song reminds me of doing musicals in high school when the director would tell us to make crowd noises during the ensemble numbers and everyone would just kinda half-heartedly mumble except for one girl who would shout stuff like “whoo! yeah! haha! this is so much fun!”

**akanewasright** (7): Corbin Bleu deserved better

**bigbigbee** (7): I think this is an objectively good song, but I have like the opposite of nostalgia for this, since my sister played it NONSTOP when I was a kid and I became completely sick of it

#You're pushing it

**fadedblue09** (7): solid bop but gets repetitive

**intheaftermath** (7): I've never heard of this film but I'm 90% sure I avoided it at all costs when I was little because hating sports was part of my personality.

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): This man was a TRIPLE THREAT and fine as hell too he deserved more success

**xxipil0ts** (7): remember when the meme about this song was that it was about giving birth? no you don't.

**Zypker125** (6.7): That’s what I say when I masturbate

**missdarbusisaqueen** (6.5): This lives rent free in my head, 15+ years later

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I swear I hadn’t listened to this song in 15 years but somehow still knew all the lyrics

**bluetriangles04** (6): one year I was watching this movie replay on disney and my mom asked me if that was the "chicken boy" from high school musical because apparently his name is super close to cordon bleu which is some sort of chicken with cheese in it that people serve a lot at weddings???

**runaway3212** (6): this goes on for a tad too long

**TiltControls** (6): I don't know where I picked up this song since I never saw the show, but this occasionally pops in my head from time to time.

**apatel27** (5): Perfectly Servicable Song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Damn this song is actually pretty boring. Those weak ass woos…

**bogo** (4): i've heard this song at least three times by now in this rate and this is the worst version of it so far

**vayyiqra** (4): Hey this isn't the song from Scarface produced by Giorgio Moroder (which is a 10)

**CarlieScion** (3): i love autotune

**flava** (3): Usher would never

Hot 100 Peak: #123 (Bubbling Under)

Amount of solo Ariana Grande songs in Victorious after this: Zero (0)

---

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this was the first introduction to ariana's music career to a lot of people and i can definitely see how she got noticed: not only is she a better vocalist than everyone else in the rate, her one song sounds super distinctive compared to the club boom era electropop that everyone else did for years

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): Everyone always talks about how this song sounds like it wants to be Lady Marmalade so bad, but the production of this song is going for a more synthpop sound? It makes the vocals and the production clash imo. Still a good song because Liz Gillies and the other one's vocals are so good that even odd production choices can't sabotage it.

---

#It's giving

**datosabona** (11): jade west singlehandedly fueling my sexual awakening with this

**Rameare** (11): Liz Gillies' voice is incredible

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**agentofscranton** (10): when will ari start slaying like this again

**AHSWeeknd** (10): they gotta collab more, this was and is an insane bop

**Alumineous** (10): Hmm, I think we ALL sing. But everyone else is clearly better.

**apatel27** (10): It slaps

**babadork** (10): Arianna Grande and Elizabeth Gillies are really making the best of their one chance to sing they got this season.

**bogo** (10): this isn't just a yass grenade, it's a yass nuclear bomb

**CrimsonROSET** (10): you can tell they’re best friends

**indie\_fan\_** (10): The episode with this song was on was the first ever victorious episode I watched and all I could think off is "damn that Goth girl's a btch but she's a talented btch"

**intheaftermath** (10): saw an a cappella group perform this recently and the harmony is so good in person, i think i almost cried

**jaztinax** (10): the most iconic duo to ever grace the nickelodeon stage

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): YUP IT'S A SMASH

**plastichaxan** (10): Victoria Justice was over after this omfg

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): I wish Ariana would sing louder like this more in her own music

**throwaway-7650** (10): I feel vindicated as an ariana stan since when she was on nick

**xxipil0ts** (10): sumn sumn victoria shouldn't have been the lead sumn sumn

**emayzee** (9.5): no like can ariana please sing like this again

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): if you put me in a room and just played this with no context i would assume it's a solo ari song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Kind of crazy that Ariana Grande is only on one song in this rate.

**ricki** (9): Elizabeth Gillies please just give us a small musical career moment we need it

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): They are probably too young for this

**nt96** (8.5): Elizabeth Gillies you will always be famous

**Zypker125** (8.5): I’m required by law to link Ariana Grande’s concert’s version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_-WgONr8ZI

**nightstar14** (8): slayage

**frogaranaman** (7): kinda giving (it up)

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): the girlies ate with this one I fear but the production is just so bad

#Give up on your music career

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): why does ariana sound better here than she does on most of her other songs

**flava** (6): weirdly sexual for a song directly aimed at and sung minors

**anothertown** (5): there are like 2 different notes in this song

**runaway3212** (5): they're doing too much

**celladonn** (4): this sounds like Ain't No Other Man by Xtina except nowhere near as good

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): All of these *Victorious* songs were co-written by Dan Schneider but this is the only one where it makes me uncomfortable because the innuendo here is *thick* and not really appropriate for the then underage Ariana and Liz.

#Gitchie Gitchie ya ya da da

**poppinmmolly** (10): another 11 contender. Why on earth did they give Victoria Justice the lead and not Liz Gillies?? Also this song is giving a combo of Walk Away by Kelly Clarkson and Lady Marmalade.

**welcome2thejam** (10): It's Lady Marmalade

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): we love some real singer-singers here! And this song seems to have a bit of a Lady Marmalade interpolation

**ignitethephoenix** (8): someone do a cast comparison to the lady marmalade group cause I didn’t watch the show but Cat is definitely the Christina I guess

**jsonphile** (8): is this lady marmalade?

**vayyiqra** (8): yeah this is shamelessly just Lady Marmalade 2.0 but that's okay

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Gitchie gitchie ya ya da da

**Stryxen** (6): gitchie gitchie ya ya da da

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): is this the one people have been comparing to Lady Marmalade

**fadedblue09** (4): are they trying to sound like Lady Marmalade

**slimboyfriend** (4): it’s like Lady Marmalade mixed with Ain’t No Other Man mixed with Smooth (the grammy award-winning song by santana and rob thomas of matchbox twenty) and I like each of those songs more (except Smooth). I will admit that ariana did flex on this however

**yearofthesoup** (3.2): It's giving Toys R Us Lady Marmalade

**akanewasright** (3): this is lady marmalade without any dynamism or good songwriting, and with literal children singing it

**OliviaGodrigo** (0): Lady Marmalade deyassified

Its placement minus 10 (for the amount of studio albums Taylor has):13, oh my god her mind, its an easter egg


---

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this is so saccharine it hits me in the same way nightcore does but in a much more consistently good way. anyways we want this on self-titled (taylor's version)

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Even as a child who was gay enough to watch new episodes of Hannah Montana often, I didn't really care about the movie at all. Also, I can see a little bit of that T\*yl\*r Sw\*ft writing in here, but let's be real, this show always had songs that seemed like they could've been written by a teeange Taylor.

---

#Hannah Montana you will always find your way back home

**PretentiousPegasus** (11): Best song Disney ever made

**agentofscranton** (10): this is unironically one of the best songs taylor swift has ever written

**bluetriangles04** (10): little me hearing this song changed my life. this chorus is just straight up insane and I will never forget the performance scene where she's changing clothes mid performance HELLO???

**cremeebrulee** (10): YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR HAIR YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND THATS JUST THE WAY IT GOES!!!!!

**flava** (10): ok this is genuinely good, like seriously this fast-paced pop-rock bop is so fucking good

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I was so busy jamming out to this song that I literally walked right into a fire hydrant and had a huge bruise on my leg for a week but that’s MY fault, the song is innocent.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): yeah this still goes hard

**nightstar14** (10): she can do no wrong

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Top 5 Taylor Swift song, yes

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): I've been listening to this since moving back to college

**RandomHypnotica** (10): you know in retrospect, the taylor-print is kinda obvious

**ricki** (10): taylor knew she couldnt beat hannha... so she joined forces with them

**runaway3212** (10): idc im giving this a 10 too

**shhhneak** (10): This is what Taylor Swift thought she was doing in 2009.

**akanewasright** (9): something something Taylor Swift

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This is a bop but some people’s hometowns suck ass and they don’t wanna go back!

**jaztinax** (9): miss swift slayed with this one. also this song reminds me of the time in elementary school where we had this weekly gathering to sing songs. and when my year had it, the teachers would always pick songs from the 70s and 80s and when my year stopped having them, i walked past the year below me having them in the hallway once and they sang this song. and i almost cried out of envy because they got to sing hannah montana songs and i didn’t

**missdarbusisaqueen** (9): Taytay come through

**jasannn** (8.5): omg a key change about change. her mind.

**TiltControls** (8.5): I don't remember this one, but it's cute

**1998tweety** (8): thank god for google maps

**slimboyfriend** (8): Very Taylor Swift circa 2007

**welcome2thejam** (8): Nice slice of pop rock! Grew on me over its three minute span.

**Zypker125** (8): YES we stan Avril Montana

**plastichaxan** (7.8): drunk/high me somehow

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): this song predicted the “oh I’m no longer a bad girl” post-Bangerz Miley era

#Go home, you're drunk

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i dont think you can learn to fly miley

**frogaranaman** (7): this is camp but like as in camp counselor

**ignitethephoenix** (7): it’s fine? I blame Taylor for making it a very 2008 Taylor kind of song

**Stryxen** (7): you can change your hair and you change your hair and you can change your hair and you can change your hair

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): wow what a nice song i wonder what the songwriting credits look like

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Very cute message although I'm not fond of how it's presented

**nt96** (5.5): this is Unpretty but unyassified

**AHSWeeknd** (5): As much as Miley deserves to win more rates, these songs ain’t it.

**apatel27** (5): lmao they really tried putting a key change in this

**bogo** (5): this is significantly less interesting than hoedown throwdown

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): If you're from an abusive household this song reads like a threat

**yearofthesoup** (4.6): Mostly not memorable.

**Roxieloxie** (4): taylor was tired after putting everything she had into crazier its okay i get it

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): the lyrics are giving taylor swift

**vayyiqra** (4): This is just an Avril song (not complimentary)

Day when you'll be beggin' on your knees: 1

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Victorious's "fuck off" anthems were definitely some of the most memorable of the show. Beggin' on Your Knees is definitely a long lost Kelly Clarkson song. And idk why people hate the 'centipede' line, cause I think it works! I also love the bridge where she just straight up admits that she's being a petty af. Girlboss!

**TragicKingdom1** (9): a shouty chorus like this shouldn't work but it does! surprisingly, i think it comes down to victoria's vocals: she pushes her voice and adds a lot of personality to her vocal delivery

---

#Heads, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes

**1998tweety** (10): ICONIC, its giving cunt

**bogo** (10): fuck ryan or whatever the guy in this episode's name is, i hope he flunked all his classes

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): Taylor’s artistic inspiration for the “The Man”

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): The crawling like a centipede line kept this from being a #1 global hit

**plastichaxan** (10): get him

**thegolding** (10): this deserved to be #1 hit tbh

**Zypker125** (10): I’d go down to my knees and beg Victoria Justice to step on me if it meant I’d get to see her sing this song again

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The thing about these *Victorious* songs is that they *almost* sound like they could be real life pop songs but then they’ll throw an utterly bizarre lyric at you that reminds you you’re still in the Nickelodeon universe. Centipede?

**intheaftermath** (9): I applaud the use of the word centipede

**nightstar14** (9): #BeckIsHotter

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): we love deserved misandry

**jaztinax** (8.5): exterminated fuckboys for good with this one

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): YAS FEMINISM.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): a centipede??? what kinda kinky shit are you into tori

**AHSWeeknd** (8): if only they put this much effort into the intro

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This a bop but man you just can’t make the word “centipede” sound good in a song.

**bluetriangles04** (8): CRAWLING LIKE A GROSS UGLY FURRY SLIMY CENTIPEDE

**CrimsonROSET** (8): gaslight gatekeep girlboss

**datosabona** (7): I want to like it more but I’m always bored halfway through this song

#Begging you to stop

**welcome2thejam** (7): Would've loved to be in the editing room when they realized her "me" and "centipede" didn't rhyme

**seanderlust** (6.8): was kelly clarkson a cowriter on any of these songs? this and take a hint give BIG kelly energy

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.7): The centipede lyric is very camp tbh

**fadedblue09** (6.5): This is not the kind of song I'd expect to hear the word "centipede" from

**apatel27** (6): If only the lyrics went as hard as the instrumental

**frogaranaman** (6): yas dominatrix teas

**missdarbusisaqueen** (6): A lot of these just sound like Katy Perry songs from the teenage dream era (which isn’t a bad thing, I just never noticed it lol)

**runaway3212** (6): this is a bit too basic even for the 2010s

**Roxieloxie** (5): the 'crawling like a centipede' line haunts me to this day

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): She shouldn’t have gotten into that school

**jackisboredtoday** (4.9): full point & a half off just for the centipede line

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): human centipede origin story

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): why is this credited to the entire victorious cast when victoria justice is clearly the only one singing

**akanewasright** (3): This is so…….

Years I spent making Raven’s vision face: 13

---

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Early 00s Disney Channel theme songs really put something in the water. They were all so memorable! This one, Kim Possible, Lilo & Stitch, etc. They all had 50 seconds to capture your attention and get you hyped for hijinks and they worked overtime to make this song! This only loses 2 points for me because it is 50 seconds long and I didn't get to hear "yup, that's me!"

**TragicKingdom1** (8): there are a lot of parts here crammed into 50 seconds...and they all bop!

---

#That's so true

**anothertown** (10): The only song i know where the bridge comes before the chorus tbh that's excellence

**Carnie** (10): The best theme song of all time!! and thats saying something with all the theme songs in this rate. eddie's rap 😩😩

**jaztinax** (10): perfect theme song

**outsideeyess** (10): 51 seconds of pure bliss and nostalgia

**RandomHypnotica** (10): why was I such a dumb kid I thought the lyrics in the chorus were "it's the future *rockensee*"????

**shhhneak** (10): She was the triple threat capitalist it girl blueprint.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this is the best theme song in this rate and if you say otherwise you’re lying

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): obviously

**thegolding** (10): THIS IS A BANGER IN SPANISH TOO EL FUTURO VEO AQÚÍ

**throwaway-7650** (10): need a vision of future rate results so I know what I tank

**TiltControls** (10): I know I'm usually a intro anti in rates, but this deserves day 3 at the very least (and top 10 in a just world)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I like that.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i will need someone to look in the vault and find the full version

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Theme songs don’t hit like this anymore

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): smash

**nightstar14** (9): legendary

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): deducting 1 point because the song doesn’t include the Yep! that’s me part

**Roxieloxie** (9): thinking about when i was watching this in a group setting and my friend realized in real time that cory in the house was a spinoff to this

**yearofthesoup** (9): honestly a bop that gets stuck in my head like once a month / on second listen the little beeps etc are kind of grating

**flava** (8.5): that autotune might have taken years off my life, but it kinda slays at the same time

**jasannn** (8.5): short and sweet

**AHSWeeknd** (8): A forgettable bop!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I can’t believe that we’re rating a fifty second song and it’s probably going to be Day 3

**missdarbusisaqueen** (8): forgot how much of a banger this is

**plastichaxan** (8): bop

**slimboyfriend** (8): Where is the “Yup, that’s me!” at the end of the song??

**vayyiqra** (8): I love R&B beats and really love synthesized orchestral hits

**welcome2thejam** (8): Time to gaze into the future! I'll say... idk like 48th place?

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.5): this shit somehow goes even harder then I remember 😭 I wish it was longer than 50 seconds tho

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): my fave show back in the day but I don't love the theme song anymore

**1998tweety** (7): That's So Pooshnik >>>>

**jsonphile** (7): birdwatchers when they see a raven be like

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Go Ray!

**runaway3212** (6.5): the rap break is so bad it becomes good and saves the song

#Get your vision and your taste checked

**akanewasright** (6): this is very much “serviceable not great” imo… like it works for the show but idt I could hum it

**bigbigbee** (6): Probably the song in this rate that FEELS the most like “just a theme song”. I think it had potential to be a good song if it was extended, though - there are some really nice elements

**bogo** (6): speedrunning this playlist at 9:15 pm on the sunday this is due, this first intro is nice

**CarlieScion** (6): i wish it was longer

**frogaranaman** (6): the rap break 💀

---

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I mean, it is definitely a ballad* by Demi Lovato. For a song that's supposed to be very cathartic and is the climax of the movie, this is kinda limp?

**nightstar14** (9): i might be biased but i still love it so much

**akanewasright** (8): This is cheesy schlock but all of this just feels so *pure* and enthusiastic… I can’t help but love it as a bright spot in a pretty bad movie

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This was a MOMENT for the Victorious stans. The reveal in the show that ugly people can sing?? oh nevermind, it's actually Victoria Justice. Of course ugly people can't sing! But the energy she brings to this song is infectious. And it makes me want the Freak the >!HECK!< OUT!

**TragicKingdom1** (8): i used to adore this song much more but it's a bit of a shrinker? it still bops but definitely among the most generic songs in the rate.

---

#Super Freaky

**1998tweety** (10): the way she devoured those 2 fads

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Deserves to be in the top 3 but I fear Popheads’ tastelessness will pop out

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): “I’m so sick of it your attention deficit” please god let this not be ablest.

**frogaranaman** (10): the way this is actually such a fucking good pop song

**plastichaxan** (10): ugh banger I hate the storyline for this in the show cause Give It Up outsold but !!

**Zypker125** (10): The rate hosts are WRONG, this song would have definitely be worse if it used Fuck instead of Freak. Freak the Freak Out works as wordplay for this song so well and I won’t tolerate slander on it.

**apatel27** (9): outside the chorus it's great

**bogo** (9): my memories of this episode aren't the best but iirc, i think it's weird that this was the song that finally beat the spoiled sing off girls when give it up (the other song they tried i think) is much better, but tori's the main character so she's gotta be the one to save the day

**diamondsandglass** (9): I wish they were allowed to swear, the chorus would hit so much harder

**runaway3212** (9): iconique scene

**vayyiqra** (9): I'm sick of my attention deficit too! :hanawinsCries:

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I guess some Tori songs were good

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): this literally sounds identical to make it shine, but a touch better

**datosabona** (8.5): y’all were too mean to victoria justice. this slays

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): I think Victoria can sing

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): this two-part special…yup it was history

**nightstar14** (8): a really really fun song

**ricki** (8): Nickelodeon was putting on Hannah Montana levels efforts to make Victoria into the biggest pop star ever but the public was just not biting

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): this is good up until the first part of the chorus, which is so flat for some reason

#Swearing is so childish

**seanderlust** (8.5): #releasethefuckcut

**TiltControls** (8.5): We need the 10 year later explicit edition

**akanewasright** (7): imagine if Victoria Justice decided to hop on the Aly & AJ “make my old songs explicit for no reason” Train and release an explicit version of this… people would die

**fadedblue09** (7): A bop even if it sounds dated

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): me, a 21 year old, conversing with zoomers

**Roxieloxie** (6): i hate that this and beggin on your knees get so confused in my head

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): This hasn’t aged well honestly, some of the synth lines are compelling but this song is kinda about nothing? It’s just noise, fun noise, but noise.

**missdarbusisaqueen** (5): ADHD teas

#OMFG (Oh my freaking god)

**welcome2thejam** (8): Let them say Frick

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): fuck the fuck out

**CrimsonROSET** (7): let her say fuck nickelodeon

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): let her say fuck the fuck out!!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I don't really understand why they haven't put the first Cheetah Girls soundtrack on streaming yet, but this is a good song! A classic feminist anthem for kids. Nothing too wrong about it, but nothing super memorable about it either.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): this sounds like a legitimate r&b girl group song from the era which is impressive but also it would be kinda mid amongst those types of hits

---

#Bippi BOPidi Boo

**Carnie** (11): I rather rescue myself!!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): this honestly holds up today

**1998tweety** (10): now why did they eat this

**anothertown** (10): falling down an dying

**babadork** (10): They could probably raise enough to get the rights to this song if they sent an intern to check under some executives’ couch cushions.

**diamondsandglass** (10): everyone go listen to the Tata Young version of this rn

**intheaftermath** (10): it's 9AM and I have literal chills from the Cheetah Girls soundtrack

**jaztinax** (10): whoever knew of this song or found this song and decided to use this in this movie… you deserve 500 awards

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): This is definitely the best version of the song! But I have to resort to the original I5 one or the Play one because I refuse to listen to the live version

**outsideeyess** (10): UK won with this being on Spotify

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): life changing to childhood me

**Roxieloxie** (10): I DONT WANNA BE LIKE CINDERELLA SITTING IN A DARK OLD DUSTY CELLER WAITING FOR SOMEBODY TO COME AND SET ME FREE

**shhhneak** (10): Welcome to WatchMojo and this is our list of top ten songs that should be on Spotify but aren’t.

**Stryxen** (10): and why were they hiding this on youtube?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the way this is basically a Cinderella diss track if you think about it

**emayzee** (9.5): the fact that i can pinpoint the birth of my feminism to hearing this song

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): the live version slayed then didn't but I'll just keep this at a 9.5

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): May have invented girlbossery…

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I feel like Cinderella gets a bum rap as a princess archetype… it’s not a story about waiting passively to be saved, it’s a story about perseverance, not letting your circumstances drive you to darkness, and goodness being recognized and rewarded. This song is good though.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): it’s their best song!

**nightstar14** (9): iconic and was inescapable at the time

**jasannn** (8.5): this is a NewJeans song

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Pls watch the movie clip for this song because each outfit is horrendous in its own special way <3

**akanewasright** (8): this is basically “healthy messages for girls” in a radio ready package, but I can’t deny that it works and slaps

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): damn the Disney girls dissing their own, calling Cinderella dusty 💀

**poppinmmolly** (8): unironically I think this is what introduced me to feminism

**vayyiqra** (8): Idk why I like this

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): I'm genuinely shocked the camila cinderella movie didn't somehow find a way to cover this

**yearofthesoup** (7.6): Bit of a feminist anthem?

**bogo** (7.5): "i can slay" based on your other songs yes you can

#Cinderella (2015)

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this song is what caused the beauty and the beast reboot

**fadedblue09** (7): very smooth

**seanderlust** (7): "I can slay" okay sure but can you yass

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): I can slaaaaaaaaaaaaaay

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Cheetah Girls you’re right. You CAN slay

**welcome2thejam** (7): I assume Cindy got the last laugh by getting into Walt's frozen ear and keeping this off streaming

**grandmafriend** (6): can a song be more 2000s-girlgroup-ish?

**cremeebrulee** (5.8): it bops a little i just hate feminism

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): it’s there

**runaway3212** (5): me when I have never seen cinderalla

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): unrelated but can we talk about how hideous the outfits theyre wearing in the video for this are

**AHSWeeknd** (3): the minimal amount of effort put into this

**apatel27** (3): S.H.E did it better

**jsonphile** (3): can we as a society stop picking on Cinderella for “not doing anything” she was in an abusive home and yet still showed kindness to the smallest animals sorry she didn’t pick up a sword and go all girlboss on her stepmother

**Zypker125** (2.3): Even the social progressivity of the lyrics couldn’t save this song.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I was stanning this song despite being a Mexican and I think most people would understand being offended by this song, but idk those translucent bitches culturally appropriATE this up. This is basically Zac Brown Band - Toes but for gay people. Ryan put his entire ~~gay~~ obviously heterosexual ass into his performance for this.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): they ENDED fadbriella and troy!!!! this one is among the most nostalgic in the rate as a twink. also they should add this to the enchanted tiki room at disney world

---

#Caliente! Suave!

**1998tweety** (10): ICONIC

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the gayest song ever made.

**apatel27** (10): It's camp

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Culturally appropriATE.

**CarlieScion** (10): ... bop

**frogaranaman** (10): this is lesbian and gay solidarity

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This gave Rosalía her career

**intheaftermath** (10): Troy and Gabriella sing for pretty much this entire movie and their discographies combined don't even hold a candle to this song.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): omfg. if there's one thing that ryan and sharpay were gonna do, it was give you a PERFORMANCE

**plastichaxan** (10): yeah i feel latina

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me after taking 1 spanish lesson

**ricki** (10): The first time Ryan graced my gaze was the moment I was turned into a homosexual. I didn't want him, I wanted to be him. There was nothing I wanted more than to wear blonde hair and beret's on a daily basis. Disney could have tried everything they can to straightwash him but they know damn well they created the golden standard for flamboyant musical theater gay that only hangs out with straight girls.

**Roxieloxie** (10): im giving this a 10 because the enjoyment the lip syncing in the rain episode of suite life gave me with the jokes around this cannot be ignored

**runaway3212** (10): come through gay overtones

**shhhneak** (10): Brought camp into the mainstream again.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): exactly

**thegolding** (10): I think about this song every time I feel bad for being competitive. Sharpy invented my language

**throwaway-7650** (10): mi gente latino

**jasannn** (9.5): this is the energy I need in 2022

**jaztinax** (9.5): the latinification of sharpay and ryan

**akanewasright** (9): The way sharpay is a horrible dancer and still slays the house down

**ignitethephoenix** (9): my camp king and queen

**Stryxen** (9): lido pimienta is lucky we didn’t include this in HAP

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this is indistinguishable from an average spanish eurovision entry

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): was he her brother or her gay friend? I feel like I get a different answer each time I ask

**emayzee** (8.7): their roles in the spring musicale were being threatened. the social hierarchy at east high was being dismantled. ryan and sharpay had one disco ball, a staircase covered in glittery party city decor, and a dream.

**xxipil0ts** (8.5): there was not one single thread of heterosexuality in this

**bluetriangles04** (8): ARRIBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!

**indie\_fan\_** (8): woulda been a 10, but gringos tryna speak Spanish give me second hand embarrassment

**musical\_pyn** (8): the camera panning to people's exasperated faces as if ryan and sharpay aren't slaying

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): at this point Sharpay and Ryan are basically in a separate movie

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.8): Sharpay didn’t ask to be born Latina

#I'm calling ICE (I'm mexican, I can make this joke)

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.4): was aye que fabulosa sharpay easter egging fabulous ? #swiftiemoment 🤔

**CrimsonROSET** (7): e rosalia

**diamondsandglass** (7): this feels questionable

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I see they went to the Freddie Benson Escuela de Español

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I love rosalía

**nightstar14** (6): the Rs were definitely rolling

**2dina3dworld** (5): does anyone feel like this aged like milk

**nt96** (5): A rejected Grease song with some half assed Spanish words added for "racial inclusion". This was definitely made by people who would label me their "Latinx friend"

**thedoctordances1940** (5): oh that's already over

**flava** (4): bop to the top of day 1 hopefully

**bigbigbee** (3.5): Would have been a 10 if this had been What I’ve Been Looking For! AND BY THE WAY, THE FAST VERSION ATE KELSEY’S BORING SLOW ORIGINAL UP, AND I SAID THAT SHIT!

**jsonphile** (3): okay cultural appropriation aside this is just kinda annoying sorry. What I’ve been looking for is the far better Sharpay/Ryan duet in this movie

**yearofthesoup** (3): i cannot tell you how angry Ashely Tisdale's Spanish makes me feel

**fadedblue09** (2): I'm ready to have my gay card revoked 😍

**missdarbusisaqueen** (2): The chorus is okay but it’s lowkey racist

**vayyiqra** (2): This is triggering my fight or flight response for reasons unknown to me. Furthermore, it's just annoying.

**bogo** (1): everything i said about hoedown throwdown applies to this song except this time it's a very bad thing

**Zypker125** (1): It sounds like a Dora The Explorer song, and normally that would warrant a 10, but this song is THAT bad.

People who have those days: Everybody

---

**ImADudeDuh** (9): This song had a better impact on depression than that Logic song.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): despite Hannah Montana 2 being her best selling soundtrack i feel good about this being its only song in the rate? i feel like that one had a long string of singles/doubles but this was the only home run

---

#Perfecto!

**bookthieving** (11): this hits closer to home now than it did 15 years ago

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Some songs stand the test of time, this is one of those songs.

**akanewasright** (10): In another world this is a fan favorite kpop song

**Alumineous** (10): I really thought this choreo slapped.

**anothertown** (10): this is the archetypical, apex hannah montana song. this is the song that plays when hannah montana accepts her lifetime achievement bbma

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is literally one of the best songs to ever i was so close to 11ing this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): if a Hannah Montana song has to win I hope it’s this one

**emayzee** (10): something shifted in my brain chemistry the second i first heard that twinkly sound effect in the intro

**frogaranaman** (10): she lowkey sounded British in the bridge

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES 😔🎧🎆

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Miss Hannah Montana stepped on my neck here

**imasalesman** (10): iconic still

**jasannn** (10): a solid pop song. I had this on my regular playlist until it came on shuffle on AUX a little too many times.

**jaztinax** (10): so true bestie

**nightstar14** (10): perfect weddings, funerals, birthdays, sunday church, EVERYWHERE

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): The Hannah Montana 2 soundtrack was pop perfection, I’m so serious

**plastichaxan** (10): I wonder if she feels the same now that Emily Montes has released such perfect music

**runaway3212** (10): this final chorus iconic

**Stryxen** (10): then why is this pop perfection ?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): she said this one goes out to people who suck!

**throwaway-7650** (10): disney historians have noted that this song's chorus is actually the most impactful/slayful yass grenade EVER detonated on record

**grandmafriend** (9.5): everybody makes mistakes! everybody has those days!

**intheaftermath** (9.5): I had a Christmas ornament that played this song when I was little. I was also a perfectionist as a little kid. That Christmas ornament had a demonstratable impact on my sense of self.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): where was these songs during my breakdowns hannah

**seanderlust** (9): literally why am i paying for therapy when i could just listen to this when i'm having anxiety

**bluetriangles04** (8.5): nobody's perfect but nobody's releasing a song like this ever again EITHER

**flava** (8.5): love being empowered

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): you know you’ve made a banger when even my mom has nostalgia for this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Immaculate melody but for some reasons the vocals on the chorus aren’t completely working for me.

**CarlieScion** (8): why ruin a perfectly good song with a motivational speech

**nt96** (8): this was better than I remember

**1998tweety** (7.5): disagree! have u seen Park Jimin?????

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): The visual of Hannah in that weird purple blouse putting her hands on her hips and bopping them side to side is forever burned in my brain

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): very iconic but not among my favorites of Hannah's. Where is Rockstar? Where is I've Got Nerve?

**Zypker125** (7.4): Thx Hannah, I tell myself that every day as copium

**bigbigbee** (7): The chorus grew on me but I still think that the sing-talking part is the best by far (synths remind me of KARA’s Jumping or Step, two slay songs)

**vayyiqra** (7): This is kind of a banger, unlike all the other Hannah Montana songs here

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I don’t remember this song having so many key changes?

**welcome2thejam** (7): A 10 if after she said "it's just one of those days" she immediately launched into Break Stuff by Limp Bizkit

#take some antidepressants already

**missdarbusisaqueen** (6.5): iconic but the verses are kinda grating

**bogo** (6): how can you say that when fiona apple exists

**Roxieloxie** (6): Actually as we get further into this I think i was almost too young for the early hannah songs. Like they're iconic yes, i cant hear 'everybody makes mistakes' without going everybodyhasthosedayseveryoneknowswhatwhatimtalkingbout but they're iconic in an objective way and not to me if that makes sense, like they just never grabbed me.

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): outsold jessie j (or was it pink)

**jsonphile** (5): would be a bit higher if Miley could hit those high notes

**thedoctordances1940** (5): yeah i can tell

**TiltControls** (5): Miley, talking about her albums 6 months after their release

**2dina3dworld** (3): help I only remember this because of Tik tok

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): the proto hyperpop part slays but the rest…

**yearofthesoup** (3): v annoying (was this song explicitly designed to irritate parents?)

**apatel27** (2): I'm sure this would hit hard if I was a suburban tween and this was my first exposure to pop rock

**fadedblue09** (1): True, but there's no need to be annoying about it

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I don't give a fuck, MIRANDA ENDED THE SUGARFADS!

**TragicKingdom1** (9): yeah you're gonna get a pretty fucking good song if you just start licensing out actual pop songs

---

#MIRANDA COSGROVE SAVED POP MUSIC

**celladonn** (11): now why did this need to go this hard

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): this has unironically been in my playlist for the past month before this rate

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): Don't make me choose...

**2dina3dworld** (10): I think you could make Greep sing this and I’d still enjoy it. It’s one of those songs that sounds good regardless of who sings it

**agentofscranton** (10): when this wins both main rates this month omg

**anothertown** (10): absolutely everybody moved

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): We love a song getting two 10’s in one month!

**bogo** (10): once again, sounds like a legit pop punk song, if avril lavigne or paramore had released this it would've been a fucking SMASH- oh wait this is a sugababes song and it WAS a smash lol nvm

**cremeebrulee** (10): i’m not going to publicly admit the date i learned this was a cover

**CrimsonROSET** (10): song to break your bed jumping to

**frogaranaman** (10): Miranda Cosgrove made the best pop songs of all time

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): [If you want some vintage reactions to how people felt about this when it came out, check out the comments on this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlChjNqD3TE)

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): yeah she tore this up

**musical\_pyn** (10): Imogen Heap WHO?

**nightstar14** (10): invented rock music

**plastichaxan** (10): kinda set up the sugababes putting a cover that outsold their original here omg

**RandomHypnotica** (10): ok yeah this version outsold sugababes

**slimboyfriend** (10): for this rate and this rate only I am a Miranda Cosgrove stan

**throwaway-7650** (10): can't wait to give this a 10 again next week (do Y2UK!)

**TiltControls** (10): Can't wait til we get About You Now (instrumental version from iCarly for the Nintendo DS) so we can get the triple rep in August rates

**AHSWeeknd** (9): She killed it.

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): Only giving this a 9 because the Sugababes version is better and I’m giving that one a 10 in the other rate!

**thegolding** (9): Miranda ended Sugababes

**jaztinax** (8.5): she slayed with this cover though

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): a great song but why is this on the iCarly soundtrack???

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): Miranda serving taste, if you like this do the Y2UK rate (probably still accepting extensions)!!!

**1998tweety** (8): its giving Avril

**letsallpoo** (8): and the sugafads?

**Roxieloxie** (8): Not to be #American on main but like ,,, what do you want me to do, the chorus is so good

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): sugababes did outsell but a sturdy hook is a sturdy hook

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): pop queen

#British people

**runaway3212** (7): this is kinda filler but kinda slay

**Stryxen** (7): camp

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Slay Ms. Shay

**welcome2thejam** (7): It's a surprise Y2UK tool that will help us later

**Zypker125** (6.8): This is what would happen if you transformed the “fluff” fanfiction genre tag on AO3 into a full song.

**seanderlust** (6.5): the album cover saying it's the "COMPLETE ALBUM AT A LOW PRICE" is sending

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it's cute

**vayyiqra** (6): Wow 2000s pop-rock that is bearable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): this song gets a derf score

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): the lyrics in video description being only the chorus

**akanewasright** (4): I don’t think anyone’s quite gotten this song right tbh. I think on a songwriting level this is a decent tune, it’s just that each major version of it has problems. The sugababes version I hate the drums and the production on the chorus, and while I unironically like the production on this much more, it still has the weird drums in the verses, and… Miranda Cosgrove is not a great singer. The sugababes, even without mutya, can sing their asses off and riff well, and this just does not hold up compared to their vocals

**grandmafriend** (3.3): i feel sorry for the sugababes

**apatel27** (3): This didn't need tween rock treatment

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): ok yes I’m the host of the Y2UK rate where the other “About You Now” is but can we have an honest conversation?? Why must both versions have the ugliest, scratchiest synth line I’ve ever heard? Was it borrowed from a freaking electroclash or noise rock group?? What is happening?? Anyway I don’t really see it for any version of this song, honestly. And yes I’m very transparent that I put it in my own rate as it’s the Sugababes’ best performing hit and that people would be excited to 11 it. Happy for those who did lol

**intheaftermath** (3): I don't even know what to say.

**flava** (0): haha wouldn’t it be camp if someone 0’d the same song in two different rates

**TragicKingdom1** (8): i've always felt this was slightly overrated because it's kinda just another guitar pop song but naomi scott is a STAR and deserves a mcu role or something

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I don't really care about this one, but it's alright.

---

#Don't go! We love you!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): The collapse if she busted this out in Aladdin.

**throwaway-7650** (11): bridgit brought naomi scott with her to the mother lake too

**1998tweety** (10): she is in fact, so gone,

**agentofscranton** (10): furious that naomi scott decided to be an actress when she could've been the next big pop girl instead

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Naomi Scott deserves more recognition

**Alumineous** (10): The confidence, the vocals, just everything about this song is fantastic.

**datosabona** (10): slay

**fadedblue09** (10): Why am I suddenly emotional

**followingfreeways** (10): this made me question my sexuality as a young girl.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): yeah this is nothing short of a slay

**intheaftermath** (10): a lot of these songs have had some astonishingly horrid vocal performances. This is not one of hem!

**musical\_pyn** (10): Olivia Rodrigo WHO?

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): this song carried this lame movie

**runaway3212** (10): naomi scott i am free this friday night

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): queen elizabeth II on september 8, 2022

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): nemesis_lol had it coming

**Zypker125** (10): Got deducted a point since she proceeded to hook up back with her toxic ex-boyfriend at the end of the movie after singing this song, but received a bonus point for being a banger anyways.

**bluetriangles04** (9): the way she got all up on those tables in the pizzeria THAT SHIT WOULD NOT FLY IN 2022!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): where did she go

**jasannn** (9): I have no idea why they didn’t add a key change at the last chorus. they literally paused for it

**jsonphile** (9): this sounds like if kidz bop covered Kelly Clarkson but were actually good

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): she may have multiple critically panned high budget films, but she will ALWAYS be remembered for this

**Roxieloxie** (9): slay

**akanewasright** (8.9): I generally think the perfect pop chorus has a bit of a twist in the middle of it - like repeating a melody twice, then leading into something new, then tying it back to the original idea, and I think this nails it. I think the one thing holding this back for me is that I think this would sound better with a slightly bigger voice on the song. Like if they’d gotten someone with a slightly bigger belt… but I’m splitting hairs, she does an alright job with a very good song

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/227/571/157.jpg

**shhhneak** (8.4): This is just blatantly a knockoff of Since U Been Gone right? Anyways Naomi Scott I am free on Thursday.

**frogaranaman** (8): serving VOCALS OKAYYYYYY

**ignitethephoenix** (8): it’s weird hearing a very normal sounding Disney song haha

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): :((

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): ugh we needed mo to be the main singer of lemonade mouth

**jaztinax** (7.5): it’s giving walmart camp rock but i’m not mad about it

**bogo** (7): for the final time, legit pop-punk smash

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is like someone put “Ghost” by Fefe Dobson and “She Used To Be Mine” into rave.dj

**plastichaxan** (7): “she’s so gone baby this is me” oh she was warning us all along

#and STAY GONE!

**slimboyfriend** (7): omg it’s the tiktok song. I feel so old because I had no idea..

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I’ve heard worse

**yearofthesoup** (5.2): wait was this a tiktok song because why have i heard this a million times. if so, i'm shocked to learn that the original was not pitched up & that's just...what it sounds like.

**apatel27** (5): How much Kelly Clarkson did they listen to before making this track

**nightstar14** (5): forgettable

**ricki** (4): SINCE YOU BEEN GONEEEEEE I CAN BREATHE FOR THE FIRST TIMEEEEEE🎶

**Carnie** (2): this sounds like a parody of Shes So High

**cremeebrulee** (2): it’s been a while since i saw this but i distinctly /remember/ hating naomi’s plot in this movie so this song actively bothers me

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Just like the Cheetah Girls, I don't remember anything about this movie. I did not even watch the Lizzie McGuire show (i'm not a hag). However, I did know of this song as a child and I knew it was a bop. I think its because I would see the ending of this movie while waiting for it to be over so I can watch the show that's supposed to be coming out after. Anyways, this was winning for most of the month, and easily has the most 11s, and yet, we find this all the way down here. While most people dragged the newest songs because they had no nostalgia cause it was too new, it seems like this is the only song that was affected by no nostalgia because it was too OLD. Flop!

**TragicKingdom1** (10): weddings/funerals/etc. this is like erika jayne levels of pandering to the gays

---

#I've been dreaming of this

**CrimsonROSET** (11): i mean, why lie? This IS what dreams are made of. This is the peak of DCOM.

**IdiotBox01** (11): undeniable

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): This song and movie made me show early signs of homosexuality in my youth

**shhhneak** (11): Hilary Duff was the first artist I’ve ever stanned and it would sacrilege to abandon her now. She invented this genre. She is mother lake, mother goose, and mother to many of these girlies.

**thegolding** (11): I heard this song when I was 8 and I've been wanting to become a musician since then. Couldn't give this number to any other song since WDAMOF was completely trascendental in my life

**TiltControls** (11): If Popheads disrespects the original Disney queen like the last times we rated her I'm deleting the rate leaderboard

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**Alumineous** (10): I never really realized how much Hilary was a big part of my Disney childhood. She's iconic.

**anothertown** (10): will i ever get an answer as to why Haylie's vocals are in the movie version. the soundtrack version was fine !?

**bluetriangles04** (10): i too want to go to barcelona and meet a handsome man who tries to embarrass me publicly before his ex shows up to save me and my self-confidence leading me to realize i'm actually in love with my best friend but I guess my expectations are too high!

**Carnie** (10): duh

**cremeebrulee** (10): this movie RUINED MY LIFE!!!! i will never know happiness in this life until i make a pilgrimage to italy and make a wish at the trevi fountain

**fadedblue09** (10): Probably one of the first pop songs I've ever heard?

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This had more impact on the gay community than Stonewall

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): Hilary absolutely mopped Paolo with this 🤭

**nightstar14** (10): ICONIC

**plastichaxan** (10): can’t wait to give this a 10 in winners rate

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): why isn't this playing in the clubs i go to

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this will never not spark joy. one of the first pop songs I ever perceived, oldheads rights!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): EXACTLY!

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): i have no idea what is going on in this movie but hey now it’s camp

**throwaway-7650** (10): but where are these dreams made of... made?

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): okay does anyone remember that Tik tok trend of people showing off their babies to an acoustic cover of this song by a dude? Yeah. I got secondhand embarrassment seeing those Tik toks

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): anyone who gives this a low score is ageist against millennials

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): This is JOY!

**followingfreeways** (8): one of my favorite stories from my childhood is how my sister would cry at this song every single time the movie was ending and we didnt know why

**frogaranaman** (8): okay this is a serve inclusion

**jsonphile** (8): you’re an all star

**poppinmmolly** (8): the movie version is better than this separate studio version

**ricki** (8): the execution of this could have been better in literally every aspect possible but the cultural impact this scene had has yet to be matched by any other movie

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): She put Rome on the map

**vayyiqra** (8): When we were 12 my twin brother and I had a phase of ironically listening to Hilary Duff because we thought liking pop music was quirky and now I unironically like her so that's growth I guess

**yearofthesoup** (8): 0% surprised that I remembered Hilary Duff's vocals as giving so much more. And yet they're fine! It's totally a doable song for her & autotune. Also what a great repurposing of the absurd "Hey now" phrase from "Don't Dream It's Over"

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): this hits different in the movie

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): old people rights

**Stryxen** (7): fun!

#HAG!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This is cute but her voice…

**jasannn** (6): These vocals are horrid but I can’t help but smile when I hear this melody

**missdarbusisaqueen** (6): “Don’t Dream It’s Over” outsold. Also who’s the random vocalist at the end

**babadork** (5.7): It gets a 10 for fashion reveals, because those purple bellbottoms are really deeply ingrained in my memory.

**bogo** (5): very milquetoast bop. very safe and stale. utterly okay. totally fine. completely unobjectionable

**welcome2thejam** (5): Not a fan, but I recognize its iconicness

**akanewasright** (4.5): Hilary… just can’t sing huh

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Oh my god…she can’t sing.

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): the verses slay but this could be a minute shorter hence i lowered the score

**runaway3212** (4): sorry bestie, should've been come clean

**apatel27** (3): You know that kid who was too gassed by their parents as a great singer that decides to sing in public poorly?

**intheaftermath** (3): god, it's brutal out here

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): …this is what you were all hyping up?

**Zypker125** (2.6): This show premiered before I was born, I’m sorry guys it was before my time

**AHSWeeknd** (1): overrated tbh, she definitely outdid herself.

**CarlieScion** (1): idc she cannot sing

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): Come Clean is a 10

Time Miley Cyrus had to watch 2 drag queens perform this on television: 2:54

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Thank god they made sure that the theme song for their show about a pop star was a great song. And of course, there's the whole plot point about the show being technically exposed to everyone because she sings about how she literally has a secret life that she hopes no one finds out.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): i know it's like literally the first song she ever released but miley's vocals really cannot keep with this one to a distracting degree. these theme songs tend to have very repetitive and shouty choruses and this is the worst offender. that being said its still nostalgic so i can't tank it too hard

---

#Best of both worlds

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**akanewasright** (10): thinking about the first time I heard this song and was shocked when there wasn’t a key change until the last chorus

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): They slayed on this one.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): ashley o:

**DaHumanTorch** (10): 0:59 is me when *those* pics were taken last year

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Harry Styles when he does another interview being vague about his sexuality while he dresses in some ugly gender non confirming clothing

**jasannn** (10): me as a bisexual

**plastichaxan** (10): fun fact this is the beginning of my first mixtape I did as a kid with all music downloaded from like LimeWire or something similar

**poppinmmolly** (10): no notes

**RandomHypnotica** (10): she's just like me!

**ricki** (10): That riff guitar in the beginning activated my gay gene to run towards the TV

**runaway3212** (10): omfgggg she slayed down the entire house

**thegolding** (10): she made me a bisexual (tho mostly f*g) with this song

**throwaway-7650** (10): the most iconic TV theme song of all time PURR

**TiltControls** (10): I can't say I loved the show at the time, but there's something super nostalgic about listening to this

**shhhneak** (9.8): The way everybody knows this song from the first breath. They don’t make theme songs like this anymore.

**emayzee** (9.6): it wasn't a piece of tween media in the mid 2000s if there wasn't an orlando bloom reference

**seanderlust** (9.5): okay raise your hand if this song gave you unrealistic expectations of stardom when you were young

**bluetriangles04** (9): there aint no way this comes on and you aren't shaking ass ARE YOU KIDDING ME????

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): IS THAT ORLANDO BLOOM 😭

**jsonphile** (9): okay this kinda slaps harder than I remember - and that key change?? I’m ascending

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): 13 year old Miley had the 25 year old pop girls scared and shaking after this one

**slimboyfriend** (9): what can I say? A classic.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): the cupcakke remix of this from 2016 still lives in my head rent free https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiyxvs7IwEU

**Zypker125** (8.8): That key change in the last chorus is legendary. Also, obligatory YOU GET THE BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSST OF BOTH WORLDS

**grandmafriend** (8.5): would be a 10 if all the choruses hit as hard as the last one

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): me when i have to act polite in front of my family in public vs when i go online and rant about them to my friends on discord

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): why does this sound so much worse in the full version compared to the intro

**diamondsandglass** (7.5): defined a generation

**nt96** (7.5): A mentally stable human representing both Popheads and Indieheads [IMPOSSIBLE]

#Worst of one world

**apatel27** (7): Would Hannah disown all her previous music when she reveals herself to be Miley saying it wasn't authentic to her

**fadedblue09** (7): That chorus doesn't sound good as I remembered

**frogaranaman** (7): WHY the Orlando Bloom line, what was the idea behind that one

**nightstar14** (7): this song raised me but its far from her best

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): "You get the beeeeest of one world…"

**yearofthesoup** (6.8): ICONIC guitar lick, and Miley's transition to the chorus is chef's kiss but everything else is blah

**bigbigbee** (6.5): this one’s hurt by how much Hannah Montana I watched, I can’t separate this from its “opening theme”-ness in my mind

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): its a good opener for the show but as a standalone song i would probably not listen to it

**imasalesman** (6): I cried listening but it’s worse than I remember tbh

**intheaftermath** (6): I liked this when I was little but if the lyricism doesn't make Miley seem like an entitled little princess then I don't know what would

**thedoctordances1940** (5): this is the best of no worlds

**AHSWeeknd** (4): This could easily win the rate. But then there’s always those people who tank the popular songs, I may be one of those people

**bogo** (4): sorry what do i get now i didn't hear you

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Nobody would like this if it weren’t iconic.

**Roxieloxie** (2.5): Ill be honest i've never been that big on this one , like yes its /thee/ hannah song but i've just never enjoyed it much

**vayyiqra** (2): Pop-rock was a mistake

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Even back when this was airing, I just felt so drawn to this song, and I didn't even watched The Cheetah Girls franchise. That's the hold it had on me. Several people were dragging the random guy at the end, but honestly? He really pulls the song together too. Please stop being allergic to men in music for 5 seconds!

**TragicKingdom1** (10): they put their WHOLE cheetussies into this one!!! probably the slutboppiest song from disney girlies aside from He Said She Said

**jackisboredtoday** (7): I never watched this movie but it made it a dream of mine to see Barcelona in person that persists to this day

**Roxieloxie** (7): okay im docking points for the slur because i did not remember that being there, but this song right here??? do you know how bad i wanted to do study abroad in college so i could go to Barcelona and recreate this scene ( thanks covid)

**yearofthesoup** (7): Minor bop

the hosts seeing this song make the top 10: 😠😠😠


---

**ImADudeDuh** (5.5): This is just Fabulous 2.0 but with a bigger budget, and that's not a good thing! It's an above average song. Maybe it really is just the nostalgia talking, but all the personality that was in Fabulous that made it so good is taken down several notches in this song. Even while watching the admittedly impressive musical number in the movie, it doesn't make me like the song anymore than I do. :shrug:

**TragicKingdom1** (5): this is definitely an experience so i get the intense stans for it but as someone with no nostalgia for it (cuz i never saw hsm3 lol) it does not really work as a full song

---

#And you deserve it all too

**anothertown** (11): somehow heartbreak feels good in a place like this

**outsideeyess** (11): in the film it just hits hard

**RandomHypnotica** (11): The budget really came through here, this feels like the most realised vision of Sharpay yet, and everything about this song is perfection, it's theatrical, it's large scale, it's dramatic, it's flashy, it's camp, it's FUN, it's EVERYTHING

**1998tweety** (10): this was made for the gays [3]

**agentofscranton** (10): unironically one of my favourite sequences in cinema

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The production level Ryan Murphy dreamed of.

**akanewasright** (10): the ending of this song is how I learned what countries all the non American cities are in, and also what Bollywood is. We love education!

**Alumineous** (10): Shame HSM2 stained her personality, I honestly really love Sharpay and feel she's misunderstood. This does lack the personality of Fabulous, but I still love it all the same.

**apatel27** (10): Ryan carrying the song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This franchise is taking all my 10’s. Please stop I have other rates to feed.

**bogo** (10): sharpay is the gift that keeps on giving

**cremeebrulee** (10): this should win if rates were just

**CrimsonROSET** (10): sharpay just got the best songs idk what to tell you

**datosabona** (10): she deserves it

**frogaranaman** (10): she was so real for this

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The Bohemian Rhapsody of the live action Disney canon

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): …Gabriella never served more personality then she did here imo

**intheaftermath** (10): ily sharpay

**jaztinax** (10): this is what “fabulous” thinks she is

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the BUDGET came through with this one

**plastichaxan** (10): they wanted to recreate Fabulous’ impact and they were kinda close wow

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): A true girlboss. she didnt waste time chasing those crusty boys she had dream and ambitions and did everything in her power to achieve them

**ricki** (10): the budget of HSM3 was so high because of this scene and nothing else. disney knew to put the money in for the real stars of the franchise xoxo

**runaway3212** (10): Literally so much better than queen

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this entire sequence is the most camp scene of any movie ever made

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): at this point Sharpay and Ryan are basically in a separate dimension

**welcome2thejam** (10): In one number it feels like they spent the combined budget of the last two films

**jasannn** (9.5): they put that budget to work

**Roxieloxie** (9): the entire budget of the 3rd movie went to this scene

**seanderlust** (8.7): CAMP

**jsonphile** (8.5): maybe a hot take but honestly the best Sharpay song

**emayzee** (8.4): lea michele imagining herself as fanny brice for the last decade

**nightstar14** (8): ashley and lucas carried hsm on their backs

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): If Sharpay and Ryan are the villains why are their songs always the bops

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I thought this was annoying at first but I actually think it’s really fun - it has a GREAT sense of humor to it, especially the acting parts, and the ensemble nature of the song covers up a lot of the thin-ness of Ashley Tisdale’s vocals that kind of grates on me in a lot of these HSM songs. That being said: oh yes, the famous Indian city of Bollywood

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): was the sharpay movie a flop? like I don't remember it AT ALL, this scene is engrained in my mind more clearly than anything from that film

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): I don’t like most of the this song but it was saved by the random Chicago musical-vibes bridge (I’m rating the videos so if that isn’t in the original song then oh well)

**shhhneak** (7.4): They used half of their blockbuster budget on this number.

#You get what you get and you don't throw a fit

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): They might not have been the villains, but they were insufferable

**throwaway-7650** (7): ...I'm starting to think I'm not very much of a sharpay fan I fear

**vayyiqra** (7): I like that sing-talking thing idk

**diamondsandglass** (6): Fabulous outsold

**missdarbusisaqueen** (6): The chorus still pops into my head from time to time. Also I do not remember the MJ impression lmao

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): I still don’t know what Ryan was on the movies for other than being Sharpay’s gay sidekick

**fadedblue09** (5.5): the Candace Flynn is jumping out

**ignitethephoenix** (5): “im with her?” Can’t believe Hillary stole her slogan from HSM3

**flava** (4): this is just fabulous but they tried to make it good so it was bad

**thedoctordances1940** (3): I Want It All to stop

**Zypker125** (2.5): I cannot believe people unironically love Sharpay’s talk-singing (or anything about Sharpay as a character), the Tisdale stans must have worked overtime

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This song made me so gay.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): this is like if the phineas & ferb songwriters attempted to recreate paula abdul - opposites attract. extremely camp and easy to appreciate for that alone but i don't think it has as much replay value as other songs in the rate

---

#Ab Fab!

**frogaranaman** (11): THEE definition of Fab

**plastichaxan** (11): This shaped me and my taste in music I do not need to elaborate it’s pretty clear

**runaway3212** (11): she did not have to end literally everyone else so badly

**1998tweety** (10): this was made for the gays

**agentofscranton** (10): ashley tisdale can say the f slur

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Sharpay was Slayyyter

**akanewasright** (10): they made this movie for gay people

**Alumineous** (10): Okay, does anyone remember that iconic Sims 2 recreation of this scene because I watched that way too much as a kid.

**anothertown** (10): the way that sharpay transcended the uptight popular girl stereotype entirely by the power of her ruthlessness and desire. she wasn't driven by fear like many fictional popular girls are; everything she did was because she wanted it so bad. and that still hits!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Rich people made points in this song and this song only.

**bogo** (10): never mind this is giving the c word

**Carnie** (10): I dont want to give this a 10 because its wayyyyyyyyyyy too musicial theatre-y but ashley tisdale is THAT girl

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the placement of this song will show if we learned anything with the yass and slay rate

**flava** (10): THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF WHEN PEOPLE SAY CULTURAL RESET!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I am like other girls.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): excuse me, thank you 💅

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): excuse me? thank you.

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): This is what justin tried and failed to do with peaches

**RandomHypnotica** (10): somewhere out there is a closeted gay who knew the entire routine to this song as a kid.

**ricki** (10): Sharpay was always the antagonist, and that's fine, stop trying to turn her into the good guy. It's okay to like villains

**seanderlust** (10): i'm sorry, isn't sharpay supposed to kind of be the villain of this series? i am absolutely rooting for her. i mean, take the nu-metal out of XS by rina sawayama and you get this

**Stryxen** (10): i dont even like this that much i just love the idea of it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): turkey imported from maine like maine is known for that 😭

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I do my best to be as objective as possible when doing these rates, but well, everyone has their limits. This is mine. I can’t not give this song a high score, it turned me gay!!! This literally brings back memories of little kid me blasting this song out loud half because it annoyed my dad and half because I just loved it so much. It’s honestly such an integral part of my childhood, and I’m so happy this rate gave me a chance to revisit that!

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): do you know how long it took me to realize she was naming brands when she was asking for brands. I thought she was just naming random people

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): exhibit 367374 that the antagonist song is always better than the good guys song

**shhhneak** (9.5): High School Musical 2 is the superior HSM for many reasons.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): sigh this is gonna be the most boring rate winner ever

**bluetriangles04** (9): ACCORDING TO MWAHHHHH!

**datosabona** (9): troy bolton was the villain

**emayzee** (8.7): probably one of my favorite musical sequences in cinematic history

**jaztinax** (8.5): it is indeed fabulous with turkey from maine

**cremeebrulee** (8): absolutely… NOT!!!!!!

**intheaftermath** (8): I despise the production on this one... it sounds like someone trapped Ashley Tisdale and the band in an aluminum can (from Miami, I guess)

**thegolding** (8): Gabriella ruined this song. Truly a villain

**welcome2thejam** (8): Gonna do that weird Troy "yeah-hah-hah" if this wins

**xxipil0ts** (8): the wordplay for turkey tho???? unparalleled.

**throwaway-7650** (7.9): the "absolutely... NOT" sounds so much like candice flynn omfg

**babadork** (7.5): Needs more Ryan

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Ashley Tisdale could do a national theater tour with just her songs from hsm and he said she said and I’d guarantee you it would sell out

**missdarbusisaqueen** (7): It’s the definition of camp

**nightstar14** (7): sharpay is mother

#Being mean is not a personality trait

**TiltControls** (7): this is deyassified pg shoes

**yearofthesoup** (6.1): does anyone else hear a bit of a eurythmics (Sweet Dreams) interpolation at 1:15 when Ryan sings "summer like never before"

**jsonphile** (6): honestly a bit ehh on this one sorry Sharpay. Besides there’s a better version of this song in the very next movie

**apatel27** (4): Nobody drinks iced tea in England. Snarky comment out of the way, what have they done to her voice? It ruins the whole song

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): rhyming Turkey with turkey is fine but I draw the line at saying “moi”

**fadedblue09** (1.5): Getting ready to have my gay card revoked [2]

**nt96** (1): songs like this remind me why I was a Cartoon Network kid

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): Still don’t get the appeal of this one sorry

**vayyiqra** (1): Oh no it's this damn song. No.

**IdiotBox01** (0): the most vapid, unnecessary, lazy, forgettable song in a series full of lame songs

**Zypker125** (0): I never understood the “Mean Girls era” of idolizing these kinds of female characters.

Bobby 'Boris' Pickett?: JOBLESS

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Unironically, this is one of the best halloween songs released in the 2010s. Let's be real, it's Kesha - Cannibal, Fefe Dobson - Ghost, Fifth Harmony - I'm In Love With a Monster, and this. The lyrics are shockingly good for this rate.  "If you're only dreaming/why can I hear you screaming?" is possible the biggest mic drop of a lyric in the whole rate.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): the way this absolute slutbop was thrown into this soundtrack to make up for exceptional and dynamite...they knew what they were doing.

---

#Call me beep me, if you want to reach monsters

**AHSWeeknd** (11): An eleven. Literally is no one out there (except for someone) is bringing it this hard for the sake of pop-halloween.

**akanewasright** (11): The way this song had more cultural impact than basically anything else on Disney channel at the time…

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): This song is brand new to me lmao but I’m living! It’s so fun! China is such a good singer! I’m living tbh! New Halloween anthem for me lmao

**Roxieloxie** (11): its actually kinda insane How they managed to write a halloween song for this that is genuinely really good and iconic. Like Holiday specific songs are such odd territory because its mostly been done before and unless its like Iconic no one is really gonna care about it after that season is over. But no they did it here and its so good. Another flat out 11. I hope this wins

**1998tweety** (10): this is literally such a bop like

**agentofscranton** (10): angela from the rehearsal found dead

**Alumineous** (10): It says SO much when this is the only worthy Halloween song in the modern 21st century.

**anothertown** (10): this is what lady gaga had intended

**bogo** (10): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlPVR7TV4AIFvs-.jpg

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is literally one of the best songs to ever i was so close to 11ing this

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): “If you’re only dreamin’ / Why I hear ya screamin’?” is such a hard lyric I’m honestly shocked it came from a Disney Channel original song.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): ate

**indie\_fan\_** (10): The religious conspiracy theorist really did kill it with this song

**LesApfels** (10): The definitive halloween anthem

**nightstar14** (10): they play this shit at chuck e cheese for oct kids birthdays and its iconic

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): She released the All I Want for Christmas of Halloween and we can’t thank her enough for that

**plastichaxan** (10): lady gaga when she has a new makeup line to try

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the best halloween song disney ever made

**ricki** (10): we need more halloween classics

**runaway3212** (10): she did not have to go this hard

**shhhneak** (10): I can’t drag any girl trying to give us Halloween music.

**Stryxen** (10): halloween classic of COURSE

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): little known fact but china anne mcclain actually invented halloween when she dropped calling all the monsters in 2011

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): happy halloween

**throwaway-7650** (10): future U.S. spotify daily #1 on november 1, 2024

**vayyiqra** (10): Horror is my least favourite genre but I love shuffle beats so

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I don’t think any song with this beat has ever been bad, but this one is especially good

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): yup yup what an absolute smash…

**seanderlust** (9.5): (ben shapiro voice) dear liberals, if you're only dreamin', why i hear you screamin'? curious.

**bluetriangles04** (9): if you don't still bump this every halloween what's stopping you from doing so?

**fadedblue09** (9): Halloween banger

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): This is what Micheal Jackson told his director he was wanting to do with the Thriller video

**welcome2thejam** (9): We didn't need another Halloween club banger, everybody shakes it to the Monster Mash already

**Zypker125** (8.5): Everyone stop making Halloween songs, the magnus opus has arrived

**celladonn** (8): let's goooo halloween bop

**CrimsonROSET** (8): justice for the halloween rate

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is a Rihanna song if she started her career on the Disney channel

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): i won’t lie this sounds familiar but i think i used to just assume it was the fifth harmony song from hotel transylvania

#A room full of monsters and it makes me want to scream

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): they tried to bop

**apatel27** (6.5): oontz oontz

**Carnie** (6.5): 5h im in love with a monster >>>

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Okay Rihannita

**slimboyfriend** (4): paws up girlies!!

**TiltControls** (4): There's something here, but I just wish the vocals were just a tinge better

**frogaranaman** (3): this is Bad

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): This is annoying as hell and it feels like it should at least be catchy but it’s actually not.

What is T for: Troy.......

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This song made me so emotionally gay.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this was so dramatic and for what? for the serve, that's what. the chorus is the best vanessa has ever sounded

---

#Eating up the dramatics

**fadedblue09** (11): One thing I like about Disney is their ability to create bops out of emotional, character-building moments, and this song perfectly demonstrates that.

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): I was thinking of 11-ing Fabulous for the meme, but no, listening to this song hit me like a brick. I have tons of fun memories of listening and singing to Fabulous that I think back to all the time, but hearing Gotta Go My Own Way for the first time in years unlocked quite a few memories I forgot I had. I remember singing and belting and crying to this every time it came on, I remember trying to do both Troy and Gabriela's parts cause they sounded so good together in the bridge, I remember watching the silly pop-up bubbles with useless trivia, I remember it all. And I'm so glad, years after obsessing over this track, I finally have some way to show my appreciation for it!

**1998tweety** (10): its giving DRAMA

**AHSWeeknd** (10): My lorde, Vanessa Hudgen’s ballad solos were the highlight of every movie.

**akanewasright** (10): Hands up if you cried to this… 🙋

**Alumineous** (10): It's a really good song in the turning point of the movie, but... in some way, Gabriella was so boring that I don't think I would care so much if she left.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Kelly Clarkson possessed her body and soul for 3 minutes and 42 seconds.

**frogaranaman** (10): I DON'T CARE IF IT'S "BORING" IT MADE ME SOB WATCHING THIS LIVE!!!!!!!! I WAS AN ABSOLUTE INCONSOLABLE MESS

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): BUT WHAT ABOUT ME 😡

**imasalesman** (10): I cry everytime

**jsonphile** (10): some of you on this sub may be young, and not appreciate this song as much as you should. This song invented heartbreak and teenage angst. No song before or since has truly captured what it means to break up with a loved one. And that bridge? The duetting between them? “What about us?” “What about trust?” Words cannot describe the masterpiece this is

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the way i cry at this scene whenever i watch it

**plastichaxan** (10): gay ass song (in a straight way)

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): I've been singing this to my roommates when I leave for class this semester so far

**RandomHypnotica** (10): even as a kid i thought gabriella was dramatic af for this

**ricki** (10): gabriella was always so dramatic for no reason, i actually see myself in her

**Roxieloxie** (10): WHAT ABOUT US , WHAT ABOUT EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH !!!!!!!!!! WHAT ABOUT TRUST !!!!!! YOU KNOW I NEVER WANTED TO HURT YOU !!! WHAT ABOUT ME !!!! WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO !!!!!! I GOTTA LEAVE BUT ILL MISS YOU !!!!! SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**runaway3212** (10): She ate and left no crumbs

**shhhneak** (10): Shakespeare wishes he could’ve wrote a monologue like this.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): AND WHAT ABOUT ME?!?!?!?!?

**thegolding** (10): i'm the biggest drama queen because of this song

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): Troy is denser than a visual novel protagonist in this movie so anything bad happening to him is automatically a 10

**throwaway-7650** (10): rate winner

**jasannn** (9.5): don’t lie, you cried during this scene.

**anothertown** (9): vanessa explored the entire spectrum of human emotion here

**datosabona** (9): girl leave his ass !

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): It’s kinda tempting to call this overrated by nostalgia but listening to it, it really does hold up as a genuinely dramatically powerful breakup ballad.

**xxipil0ts** (9): #LetSharpayAndGabriellaDate2022

**agentofscranton** (8.5): vanessa hudgens honoring her filipino heritage with a melodramatic ballad for the ages

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): this… this was real heartbreak

**bluetriangles04** (8): I always wanted a 'T' necklace because of this movie when I was a kid but like... what would 'T' have stood for? tater tots?

**bogo** (8): again, this sounds like a legit 2000s adult contemporary ballad, like something you'd here on those 80s to now radio stations, and I mean that as a compliment

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is so dramatic but slay I guess

**jaztinax** (8): troy…………….. listen …………..

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): this follows the same format as a charity single

**CarlieScion** (7): WHAT ABOUT TRUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#Go your own way (away from me)

**CrimsonROSET** (7): troy bolton war criminal

**flava** (7): the wrong Vanessa got this song

**musical\_pyn** (7): I only hope to be as good of a parent as gabriella's mom pulling up the moment she hears her daughter in the middle of a break-up ballad

**nightstar14** (7): good but falls short compared to the other songs

**Stryxen** (7): vocals ate and then troy completely unprompted comes in and ruins it

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): this was the best Gabriela solo but her solos were always kinda the weakest part of the movies, this is just the one that didn’t drag too much

**seanderlust** (6): this screams "early 2000s michelle branch album cut that even her most die-hard fans think is pretty mid"

**yearofthesoup** (5.1): i strongly dislike VH's voice.

**welcome2thejam** (5): Damn... hope those crazy kids work it out

**apatel27** (3.5): This is the boring song in all the disney animated movies but somehow worse

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): Vanessa Hudgens is a good singer, I’m kind of stunned how drenched in autotune her voice is in 2007, for no reason tbh.

**missdarbusisaqueen** (3): WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO (this lowkey triggered my fear of abandonment LMAO)

**vayyiqra** (3): boring

**Zypker125** (2): In classic Disney tradition, Gabriella gets back with Troy 10 minutes after singing this song

I: wanna cry, can't deny, wanna run up and hide

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): The intro into the verses is legendary. The soft sung verse, and then at the perfect moment is just KICKS THE FUCK OFF! It just kicks off into the highest gear possible and refuses to stop for the rest of the song. And then we get the best white rapper since MattyB absolutely slaying the bridge.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): it's really funny that the plot of this movie is that this song becomes a radio hit because it's so bizarre, but the weird elements do entertain me greatly (even the rap)

---

#Turning the world into their dance floor

**1998tweety** (11): i mean come on now, this song takes you on a JOURNEY. We were out there with Lemonade Mouth since the start...anyone who gives this a low score is literally a HAG

**apatel27** (11): Go off Armed Sheeran

**emayzee** (11): bridgit mendler deserved an honorary PHD for this song alone

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (11): this song does not miss at all. it’s known as the BEST dcom song and that’s for a reason. Bridget, Hayley, and Naomi kill the song enough already. But without Adam’s rap this song would obviously not be as big of a classic. I will never forget being hyped asf at like 9 when I heard Adams “STAWP👹” for this first time.

**imasalesman** (11): bridgit please release another album…………….

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): random but when alien superstar dropped i for the LIFE of me thought beyonce spelling out u-n-i-q-u-e sounded like another song but couldn't place it... and that's when i realized it's the "you and me together" of determinate's chorus

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): invented music.

**welcome2thejam** (11): Wildest roller coaster of the entire rate

**xxipil0ts** (11): ed sheeran's rap debut was great

**akanewasright** (10): “push until you can’t and then demand more” CD Projekt Red to the Cyberpunk 2077 devs:

**Alumineous** (10): We really thought that rap was good.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): That one guy ended Fadinem.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this was almost my 11, it’s so fucking good

**datosabona** (10): adam hicks is out on parole so a lemonade mouth reunion is possible

**fadedblue09** (10): The chorus is just magic

**frogaranaman** (10): I can't believe how hard this goes

**IdiotBox01** (10): I’ve never seen this and so many things make zero sense-the piano at the beginning, the rap section, the crowd–but this bops

**intheaftermath** (10): I wouldn't say the story behind Lemonade Mouth is particularly enthralling but my god this song is still as invigorating as it was on first listen.

**nightstar14** (10): one of the best songs to come out of a DCOM

**plastichaxan** (10): okay maybe bridgit mendler could’ve saved pop i’m listening

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): this was my Rap God

**runaway3212** (10): she's spilling so much

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): god this is still so iconic, the beat drop at the beginning, the lame side stepping jump dance, wane’s rapping…chefs kiss

**thegolding** (10): This is one of the best movies Disney in general have created and this song is just.. wow

**throwaway-7650** (10): drank from the mother lake (aka bridgit mendler is MOTHER)

**Zypker125** (10): This is the one rap that I have fully memorized. *(Breathes)* Okay,it'sWenandI'mheaven-sentMusiclikeveteranRenegade,lemonade,useitinmymedicineGoaheadandtrytonamemybandbetterthanReasonwhythewholeworld'spickingusinsteadofthemPeopleneedabreather'Cause,they'refeelingtheadrenalineStopNowhurryupandletussingKnock'Cause,wecomingthroughyourhouseAndpeoplekeeponflyinglikealemonintheirmouthI'mtherealdeal,youknowhowIfeelWhythey'reinitforabill,I'mjustinitforathrillGetdownnowIain'tplayingaroundPutyourfeetupfromthegroundAndjustmakethatsoundlike

**bluetriangles04** (9.5): that guy rapping was just making up shit and I'm on board! a shame he would go on to commit armed robberies...

**NecroDolphinn** (9.5): Outsold Eminem

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): this went harder as a kid tbh

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Bridget Mendler please come back to music

**diamondsandglass** (9): I was so ready for the rap to be worse than I remembered, but it is actually pretty good I think

**flava** (9): that rap verse, king shit

**Roxieloxie** (9): slay

**seanderlust** (9): top 10 rappers eminem is afraid to diss

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): oh this smash.

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): What a bop. Hope Adam Hicks was collecting some pretty pennies in prison

**vayyiqra** (8): lol that beat drop after the intro

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I truly thought Eminem was a feature on this song when the rap came in

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): was that Eminem

#The lie detector determined, that was a lie.

**anothertown** (7): rate villain acquired

**jsonphile** (7): it starts off promising with a 2000s piano ballad sound but then immediately becomes an overproduced early 2010s David Guetta-ish mess. But that mess is also kinda a bop

**jaztinax** (6.5): i’m sure it’s iconic in someone’s memory but meh

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): i was actually feeling the slower intro more than the actual pop song that followed this time

**bogo** (6): who let G-rated eminem on this song

**Stryxen** (6): i wanna hate this but it’s unfortunately not bad

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Lmao I wish this was as good at it was in my memories

**CarlieScion** (5): kinda boring

**shhhneak** (4.9): What season is this Drag Race top 4 remix from?

**2dina3dworld** (4): this sounds like a very low budget 2014 kpop song

**yearofthesoup** (2.5): Okay the first 30 seconds are fine and normal. The rest of the song is a dumpster fire. Why didn't they just say "determine IT?" What do they think determinate means.

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): Look, is this the worst song in the rate? No. But it’s the one I want to listen to the least. This annoys me.

Ryan and Sharpay: NOT the leads in the spring musicAL

---

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I very clearly remember having a book of the Guinness World Records of 2007/8/9? and there was a full 2 page spread about how this song had the single week jump on the hot 100 by going from like 86 - 4. The record has since been taken over by ME! by Taylor Swift and Brendan Urie of Panic! At The Disco going from 100 - 2 in a single week. Thank you, Old Town Road. Anyways, FLOP!

**TragicKingdom1** (7): they put their whole wildcatussies into this and the result was still relatively mid. would i sing around if it came on radio disney? definitely. do i hope this is day 1? also definitely.

---

#Soarin' and Flying on the charts

**grandmafriend** (11): this song was a cultural reset

**yearofthesoup** (11): what a contrast from bop to the top. I have thee biggest, softest, most nostalgic spot for this song. I was a freshman in HS when the first HSM movie came out and therefore too old to be watching it earnestly...but you BET I still watched it "ironically." And I also memorized every song, and envisioned my irl crush and myself in the role of troy & gabriella, and bought the soundtrack "for my younger siblings" but listened to it on my ipod pretty regularly (in between Punk Goes Pop, etc.) Ooh, it just brings me back to that crush and that time in my life where things were so much easier in some ways (bills who?) but also so much harder (why was i friends with so many people who treated me like shit?) Sigh.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Trump and Hilary’s cover of this was iconic.

**akanewasright** (10): Maturity is realizing that this is one of the best songs in the movie and not just a boring ballad moment

**CarlieScion** (10): perfect

**Carnie** (10): tHeRes nOt a StAhHhRrR iN hEaVeN tHaT wE cAnT ReAcH

**celladonn** (10): the impact this had...

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is Thee only song ever if we're being honest

**CrimsonROSET** (10): SOOOOARING

**emayzee** (10): you know, songs like that they are stories that people can identify with. children were singing this song at graduations, at weddings, at funerals.

**followingfreeways** (10): iconic

**frogaranaman** (10): doing this during karaoke is literally the most killer experience

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I remember in grade 4 we were cleaning the classroom as it was the end of year and someone put the HSM CD on, And when this song came on the whole class was singing along (even the boys!). So this has done more to unite people than literally anyone else in my mind

**jsonphile** (10): masterpiece. This is where the movie all comes together. This is what it’s about, two people sharing their love of music and of each other to the world. Cinema truly peaked here, that is until HSM2.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): my fave troy/gabriella duet omfg also "you know the world can see us in a way that's different than who we are" just say you're a bi4bi couple

**nightstar14** (10): one of the best songs in the franchise

**plastichaxan** (10): this was my music to ascend to as a kid wow

**runaway3212** (10): troy and gabriella bi couple goals

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ughh im still such a sucker for this

**thegolding** (10): I still relate to every word of this song Troy(Drew) and Gabriella did this

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I'm mad at how sentimental this list is making me

**welcome2thejam** (10): If I saw a jock and a nerd on stage singing? Hell no, I'd pull a fire alarm and shut that thing down asap

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): I would 11 this if zac efron actually sang on the song at all

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.7): vanessa hudgens put her whole covid apathetic foot into this one

**bigbigbee** (9.5): me, a pretentious theater kid in 2006: “hey! That’s not what real auditions are like!”

**TiltControls** (9.5): this is pure cheese. I love cheese

**1998tweety** (9): its giving drama

**anothertown** (9): drew seeley kinda ate and for what. i hope disney gave him a decent deal

**datosabona** (9): WE’RE SOOOAAAARIIIIINNNNN

**jaztinax** (9): i love it but it’s also kind of annoying

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): Drew Seeley WE LOVE YOU

**Roxieloxie** (9): [why did they make this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZzUT_yAVuY). this is another ones of those that i start of thinking is overrated but the further it gets im fully sold

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): cute ending

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Zac Efron is 5’8” sweetie basketball wasn’t in your future anyway.

**jasannn** (8): so gay and straight at the same time

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): me as a child watching this movie for the thousandth time and still pacing around nervous af and wondering if troy and gabriella would make it to the audition...

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I should find this more annoying how so many kids kept singing this back in grade school

#This song won't break my soul

**Alumineous** (7): Damn, I have a soft spot for piano intros like that but… that fake Troy singer is a great singer trying so fucking hard to be average but is miserably failing.

**apatel27** (7): yeah idgi

**bogo** (7): oh this is much better. yeah i see why this was the big hit

**flava** (7): someone please get Zac Efron some vocal coaching stat

**seanderlust** (7): hey ariana, i see you're hanging out with zedd this weekend! what are you two planning to get up to? ariana:

**agentofscranton** (6): drew seeley singing like his life depends on it

**babadork** (5.5): I don’t know if this is an unpopular opinion, but I think this would have been better if Zac Effron did his own singing instead of the other guy.

**diamondsandglass** (5): the 'soaring, flying' part feels like an airline ad

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5): this kinda has Christian pop energy I’m sorry 😭

**Zypker125** (4.2): Troy & Gabriella were the most milquetoast couple in history and this being their hit song doesn’t help matters

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Christian pop, “You Are The Music In Me” highly outsold.

**vayyiqra** (3): There are some nice harmonies idk

**TragicKingdom1** (11): ITS THE FUCKIGN SMASHA!!!! i think this is the best all around song in the rate, its nostalgic, catchy af, the guitar pop production aged perfectly, miranda sounds great, ugh truly a perfect pop song. i have a feeling the theme songs will get largely shat on this rate but if anything is the exception it should be this

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I don't think anyone suspected that the theme song to iCarly, which Billboard called one of the [biggest hits that peaked at #100 of all time](https://i.imgur.com/CVTja66.png), to be the song taking the silver medal in this rate. It's a very fun and catchy song, that means... nothing? It's about wanting to change the world with all your fellow kids, but the show was about being a youtuber so? How did she intend to do that?

#Tuning in to iCarly.com

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): My ass is UP!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): :kirbyell: WAKE UP MEMBERS OF MY NATION

**frogaranaman** (10): when I heard this come on, I knew I was about to watch the most fuck shit for the next 30 minutes

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Hearing this on the radio once was literally the high point of my childhood, yes I made my family turn it up.

**intheaftermath** (10): I love everything about this song and it all works so well. It sounds fantastic. It's almost a Disney "I want" song in the way she references a dedicated fanbase that brings their best selves to her content and lets her take charge. also it has bells.

**nightstar14** (10): holds a special place in my heart

**nt96** (10): Sadly this is gonna be controversial due to a certain someone

**RandomHypnotica** (10): absolute ICON

**ricki** (10): in hindisght maybe icarly is responsible for the dire state of young teens trying to get famous online

**shhhneak** (10): This song uses the same trick as Christmas music to make it so earwormy.

**Stryxen** (10): high concept pop rock perfection

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): that's not drake bell that's just an uncredited backup vocalist we love a solo miranda smash!

**thegolding** (10): idk why the chorus is so powerful

**throwaway-7650** (10): me giving drake bell a 5 average in this rate is so funny

**anothertown** (9.5): right after iCharly ended they shot amanda costgrove like a lame horse. SAD. well theres other programs

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I hadn’t ever heard this as a full song…and it’s great! So cute and fun

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Classic but I'm so used to the TV edit

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): i dont think i’ve ever heard the full version of this before?? so it sounds a little off since im so used to the short version but it’s obvious still iconic

**bluetriangles04** (9): "wake up the members of my nation" miranda cosgrove 2024

**bogo** (9): amazing nostalgia but it's just not the same without the "in 5, 4, 3, 2..." at the beginning

**plastichaxan** (9): Bop but there’s something about intros having full songs that always throws me off it doesn’t work much for me

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): I saw a fan edit of an alternate Big Little Lies intro set to this and it gave me more serotonin than anything else I saw for months i am so sad it got copystruck… anyway this is a 10 except for the bridge where i actually notice drake bell

**Zypker125** (8.7): The President, the Senate, and the House should legally change the national anthem of the U.S. to this song

**jsonphile** (8.5): f••k Dan Schneider but this is a bop

**TiltControls** (8.5): The version that's this + Make It Shine would be an easy 10

**grandmafriend** (8.1): such a cute lil feel good song

**Roxieloxie** (8): IMTELLINGYOUJUSTHOWIFEEL

**runaway3212** (8): jesus be like

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): fun theme song

**welcome2thejam** (8): "So wake up the members of my nation / it's your time to be" that's what the evil sorcerer sings as they plot with their minions to take over the throne

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): she just strung some random phrases together and called it a song and you know what? She slayed

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): #YAS.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): oh i guess my very occasional watching of this show was enough to make this stick with me

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Jesus this music video just REEKS nostalgia. Remember when the internet was like *that*?

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.8): this is lowkey Christmas vibes

#Wake me up (wake me up inside)

**diamondsandglass** (6.5): I used to think this was a Hannah Montana song

**jaztinax** (6): i’ve never watched icarly so

**missdarbusisaqueen** (6): It’s always weird hearing the extended cuts of theme songs lmao

**seanderlust** (5.5): The air is drafty and the morning sun is muted behind clouds as I awaken to the sounds of the crackling PA system outside my window. Noise juts through the block I live on, as it does every block, as it has every day since the Cosgrove dictatorship began. “Wake up, the members of my Nation” steamrolls through my head, drowning out any thoughts I have. The national anthem does that - these things happen. As I put on my uniform and prepare myself for another 18-hour day in the grain mill, I glance to the right at the posters Public Security asked us to post in our homes. President Cosgrove smiling, holding a gun in front of her face. A show of leadership to some, a show of force to others. The caption reads “You know you won’t be free until you leave it all to me.” I think back on how quickly the takeover happened – she rose to power in an economic downturn, preaching from the pubs how “someday the world would change” for her, and it would “be so wonderful.” We all just had to show her what we could become. I’m not ashamed to admit I voted for her the first time – after being underpaid for years and two evictions, I wanted to believe the lie so badly. I close my eyes in acceptance. These things happen. Life quickly took a downturn after she assumed power. It started with a crackdown on dissidents, then a crackdown on anyone affiliated with those dissidents. Her speech later, the evening after the Raid – how she said “some things are meant to be” and talked about the lives that were possible. Now we can’t live life, we can’t breathe air – not smog-less air, at least. I let out a sharp sigh as I don my Cosgrove Cap and walk to the front door, muscles aching, hobbling on my bad leg. I must swallow my pain; I must give my best and leave the rest to President Miranda Cosgrove.

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Nickelodeon intros were mildly annoying

**babadork** (4.8): Ew, Drake Bell

**apatel27** (4): Wake up the members of my nation sounds so villianous

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): the pop-rock part of this rate really does not hold up when you’re unfamiliar with the songs

---

#I DO dance, especially to this!

**flava** (11): gay 11 year old me really put this scene on repeat because he couldn’t handle not giving this slay only one listen

**1998tweety** (10): this was made for the gays [2]

**agentofscranton** (10): these are the two guys going at it that harry styles was talking about

**AHSWeeknd** (10): one letter away from referencing a jazz classic.

**akanewasright** (10): they made this movie for gay people

**Alumineous** (10): Yes, let's fight toxic masculinity!

**babadork** (10): The CHEMISTRY

**bigbigbee** (10): the gayness of this song is great, but honestly even ignoring that completely it’s a full on banger

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I mean being an athlete is basically just slightly de-yassified dancing.

**bogo** (10): LETS PLAY BALL LETS PLAY BALL YO YOU'RE MY UNIVERSE

**CarlieScion** (10): homos

**diamondsandglass** (10): love that this is just attributed to Chad on Spotify

**followingfreeways** (10): this is for the girls and the gays

**frogaranaman** (10): they totally were fucking

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this queerbaiting anthem has done more for gay rights than anything Charlie Puth or Harry Styles has done

**jaztinax** (10): this is how you queerbait

**jsonphile** (10): it’s just so good. The banter between Chad and Ryan, the (very likely sexual) tension between them, the jazzy instrumental breakdown mid song, the fact that Chad is literally dancing while singing about not dancing, everything about this song is a 10

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): This song is hot. They were singing their asses off!!

**plastichaxan** (10): gay ass song

**poppinmmolly** (10): honestly an 11 contender

**ricki** (10): 🌈

**Roxieloxie** (10): I played softball as a kid and i also loved corbin so this was the dream. theres nothing more i can say about this song being gay rights than /u/moonlightbywindow so ill just leave it up to them. This is one of my favorite choreographed scenes in the franchise. Its easily a song that could've been cut and think the mood would've been conveyed arguably the same but it exists ! and they were so galaxy brain for that

**runaway3212** (10): Gay people were invented

**thegolding** (10): I know y'all agree but this song made us very horny back in the day. Taylor? Gabriella? We don't know, we want Ryan with Chad

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): masc4masc guys be like

**throwaway-7650** (10): deserves to place higher than fabulous, I SAID WHAT I SAID

**welcome2thejam** (10): Celebrating home runs by doing a Fosse neck around the bases

**anothertown** (9): all according to keikaku.

**celladonn** (9): gay subtext bop

**Stryxen** (9): LGBT

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): you know when people say “there’s no heterosexual explanation for this” in regards to certain moments in tv/movies/ect? this is what invented that phrase

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.7): god this was so queer coded

**apatel27** (8.5): Ruined by the rap

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Very funky and flavorful

**grandmafriend** (8.3): spoiler alert - he in fact DID dance

**bluetriangles04** (8): how camp is it to sing dance and perform a song about not dancing while doing the very thing you're claiming you can't do

**CrimsonROSET** (8): and people say disney doesn’t do gay representation

**datosabona** (8): everybody knows… everybody knows that he fucks you

**nightstar14** (8): the straights vs the gays

**yearofthesoup** (7.9): why is it so funny that corbin bleu was definitely thee dancer of the cast & sings this song

**seanderlust** (7.8): me yelling at the players at an actual baseball game: it's okay! you can dance!! you don't have to play this!!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I love NCT U

#Homophobes

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): okay Ninth Doctor

**Zypker125** (6.2): And from this song, thousands of Chad/Ryan shippers were birthed

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): what is even the point of this like you’re already went full on NCT

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): wow the impact when I don’t have nostalgia for a song. I don’t remember this one and Get’cha Head in the Game outsold

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Yes it’s bisexual or gay or whatever but it’s also a song where men sing about sports, so it’s starting with a handicap.

**intheaftermath** (5): it's like Chillin Like a Villain but worse

**PretentiousPegasus** (5): Now this might be controversial, but if you'd asked me to rate this in 2007 it would be even lower lmao. Probably bc baseball is like watching paint dry boring but this was always my bathroom break when watching the DVD

**slimboyfriend** (4): please not another sports song

**missdarbusisaqueen** (1.5): I hate this. But it’s also the gayest thing I’ve ever heard so extra half point

**vayyiqra** (1): What was the deal with that "hey batter batter" thing during baseball games anyway. It's an odd social custom, basically IRL trolling. I think it's obnoxious. So is this song.

ImADudeDuh: #https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXPC2HXjrYU

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): If you stan High School Musical, you should know that Ryan and Chad are gay for each other. My suspicions began from day one with the second High School Musical movie, where Ryan and Chad perform the duet “I Don’t Dance” together. The entire song seems to be tongue-in-cheek, with the lyrics being an obvious double entendre for homosexuality. For example, the lyrics frequently refer to ‘batting’ and ‘swinging’, with such terms as “I don’t swing that way” / “Does he swing that way?” now being common lexicon in Western millennial spheres. This song often comes dangerously close to outright borrowing this turn of phrase, with Ryan even outright singing “I’ll show you how I swing” (!!). In general, the song is centred on Chad’s refusal to accept that he “can dance” (i.e be bisexual) while Ryan repeatedly tries to convince him that he can and he knows Chad has it in him. Ryan sings “That’s what I mean / That’s how you swing” (!!) while Chad replies “You make a good pitch but I don’t believe”, with ‘pitching’ and ‘catching’ of course being slang for gay sex. By the end of the song, Chad is still insisting he “doesn’t dance” but no matter - after the baseball game, the two of them are seen eating lunch together in swapped outfits (as in, Chad is wearing Ryan’s shirt + cap and Ryan is wearing Chad’s shirt + cap with no explanation given for this whatsoever) while playfully flirting with each other. This is all set against the backdrop of Ryan being a confirmed gay character by Kenny Ortega, the creator of High School Musical. Ryan was always coded to be gay but Ortega didn’t think he would be able to get away with it on Disney, hence why he was never explicitly said to be gay. Why am I mentioning this? Let me set the scene for you. Assume that Ryan is openly gay in this high school (which he probably would be, or it would at least be an open secret due to his flamboyance). Openly-gay-theatre-kid performs a duet with basketball-jock, who insists that he can’t “dance” while said gay theatre kid repeatedly tries to convince him that he can. The lyrics in this duet are full of gay innuendos. Afterwards, they turn up to lunch together wearing each other’s outfits and resume flirting with each other. I’ll let you put two and two together. 

It’s also important to make note of the lyrics “I’ll show you that it’s one and the same / Baseball, dancing, same game / It’s easy.” The dichotomy between sports and performance is the overarching theme in all three movies, with main character Troy battling this dilemma in every movie (“My head’s in the game / But my heart’s in the song”). Indeed, this is an analogy for bisexuality - Troy constantly wavers between choosing sports (what’s expected of him by his parents and his friends and society in general, a metaphor for masculinity and heterosexuality) and choosing performing (what he himself feels drawn towards and enjoys doing, typically looked down upon for not being ‘alpha-male’ or masculine enough). At the end of the final movie, Troy realises that it is possible for him to do both sports and performance and therefore accepts his bisexuality: he is now free to enjoy the best of both worlds (no pun intended). So why is this relevant for this song? Well, it’s simple. Here, Ryan is encouraging Chad to accept himself and realise that everything is “one and the same”. Ryan, being both Sharpay’s brother and best friend and therefore spending a lot of time with her, is surely well-acquainted with Troy’s feelings, even through secondhand gossip and just being generally nosy. He is then able to recognise Troy’s internal bisexuality dilemma. Thus, he must see the same thing in Chad and is proactive enough to attempt to show Chad how coming to terms with it is not as difficult as he thinks. 

Again, if you stan High School Musical, it should be obvious that Ryan and Chad are gay for each other. But they’re not alone. Five out of the six main characters in the High School Musical trilogy are part of the LGBT community.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This song made them so emotionally gay.

Ok well, I guess I'll have to add something else since this is our runner up. I will say, it was very unexpected that this would climb up to be very close to taking the crown! Up until the last week, the runner up was always gonna be iCarly - Leave it All To Me AND third place was iCarly - About You Now until the last 2 weeks, so I was so upset that we didn't get both iCarly songs taking the podium while Take a Hint won. 

On the brightside, **HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL won the Live Action Nickelodeon / Disney Channel Showdown** beating out iCarly!

**TragicKingdom1** (9): honestly one of the catchiest and best produced songs in the rate? i could see omarion or someone making a hit out of it in like 2008.

#The type of guys that mean what they say

**Alumineous** (11): It's everything. Zac Efron just walking in an empty golf field. Skipping in the sunset. His CGI reflection in the water. All because his girlfriend left for her own happiness? Iconic overreaction. But also, it's also Shakespearean as well. Like, it's giving Hamlet's "to be or not to be".

**bluetriangles04** (11): THIS ICONIC SONG? THIS ICONIC SCENE? RUNNING ON A GOLF COURSE SCREAMING OUT, SLAPPING THE WATER??? WILL THIS GET MY 11? you can bet on it.

**jsonphile** (11): and after two perfect tens in a row, we now reach the 11 of this rate. From those opening drum beats, you know this is going to be a banger. And what a banger it is, filled with more teenage angst than a MCR album and the performance of a lifetime from Zac Efron. Everything about it and its scene is iconic, the black polo shirt, the green hills, the singing into the water and splashing it, the drum beat, the little guitar solo at the bridge, the background vocals singing “did you ever,” everything.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): this is kinda the clit of the high school musical franchise

**1998tweety** (10): its giving drama [2]

**2dina3dworld** (10): Troy is the honorary fifth member of the emo quartet

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The director yelled cut but he heard cunt and kept going.

**anothertown** (10): the thing about being there for this at any age older than 12 was the interplay between knowing how stupid it was, and buying into it completely due to how fully zac put his pussy into it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Motivational posters made some points.

**CarlieScion** (10): has anyone overlayed the images of troy in the desert w the i dont like sand-scene from star wars

**cremeebrulee** (10): my friend had the pen that sang this whenever u clicked it and it going off randomly in our classes was always the funniest fucking thing

**emayzee** (10): christopher nolan, steven spielberg, and james cameron can only dream of crafting a 3 minute scene like the one kenny ortega did with this

**frogaranaman** (10): someone's gonna tank this for "toxic masculinity" or whatever but you cannot deny how I CON IQUE this golf course choreography was

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): god Troy is so relatable he has a mental crisis every single movie

**ignitethephoenix** (10): ZAC EFRON MAIN POP GIRL

**jasannn** (10): wait, this breakdown is actually really good

**jaztinax** (10): it’s an 11 contender. it deserves all the 11s actually.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): troy is so bisexual vibes

**outsideeyess** (10): this could've and should've been #1 if Zac Efron released it as a solo single

**plastichaxan** (10): gay ass song part 3

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): a masterpiece. zac knew he had to turn down that record deal because he would be too powerful for any of the other pop boys to compete with

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I'd bet on this being top 5

**Roxieloxie** (10): this song singlehandly makes up for the fact that he wasnt singing in the first movie. like this shit is cinema

**runaway3212** (10): this is the gayest scene

**seanderlust** (10): rave.dj/Xcp9SZboB18KKA

**thegolding** (10): Troy deserved better friends and a better girlfriend

**throwaway-7650** (10): the troy solo we all deserved after the troy we had up until now

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): That breakdown will go down as one of the epic-est moments in Disney Channel history

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Drag Me Down wanted what this has

**shhhneak** (9.1): If y’all don’t play the Trisha Paytas cover during this reveal…

**Carnie** (9): the gay angst UGH

**datosabona** (9): oh to be zac efron prancing through a golf field

**nightstar14** (9): troy is so hot

**grandmafriend** (8.6): if i didnt have the legendary golf court scene in my head it would probably be a seven

**yearofthesoup** (8.2): ICONIC scene accompanied by the perfect music

**akanewasright** (8): the way thought this was the most serious thing ever when I was like 10

**bogo** (8): why was idioteque by radiohead the first thing i thought of when the beat came in what the fuck is wrong with me it isn't even remotely similar

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i don’t think i will

**Stryxen** (8): this gay ass performance

**missdarbusisaqueen** (7): I was kinda zoned out when the song started and after I heard the beat I was like “gimme a second I.” Also the bridge/breakdown is givingggggg something

**slimboyfriend** (7): and now a golf song

**welcome2thejam** (7): The image of Troy in the water made me laugh so hard I got a side cramp

#You're going broke

**Zypker125** (7): I’d bet on this song not making Day 3, tell you that.

**intheaftermath** (6): this one starts SO strong but absolutely loses all momentum after the 2 minute mark. The result is a really jarring piece of music.

**TiltControls** (6): Popheads Rate enabled gambling?!? Is this how we make money to bring plug back?

**vayyiqra** (6): Not sure why I kind of like this

**flava** (5): the guitars are so weak, pls stop

**apatel27** (2): There's no oomph to it.

**fadedblue09** (2): sounds fuckboy-ish

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): Difficult for me to muster up sympathy for someone who looks like Zac Efron.

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): shut up troy

**ImADudeDuh** (11): OUR WINNER!!!!! There was not a moment after What Dreams Are Made Of fell from the top spot that this wasn't winning. However, it got very close near the end of it's journey of losing but I'm so happy it still stayed on top! 

Even as a teen watching this, I was obsessed with this song, and when I eventually became chronically online, I learned I wasn't the only person! Every line hits so hard and Liz and Victoria do their absolute best to sell this song as much as humanly possible. It wasn't made for a kid's show since [the demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88b-QneTCLA) does say some curse words, but I'm glad this made it's way to Victorious! Insanely catchy, and it even sounds good in nightcore form!

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): this was clearly not written with a duet in mind because one of them is relegated to the upper register

---

#Took a hint, and gave this a great score

**2dina3dworld** (11): this has no right to go as hard as it does

**bogo** (11): the absolute power this song has, fucking ended those dudes. if give it up is a yass nuclear bomb this is a yass supernova

**DaHumanTorch** (11): this is literally one of the best songs to ever i was so close to 11ing this

**NecroDolphinn** (11): Gillies and Justice’s voices work so well together and the song is just perfect like I don’t know what the Victorious writers were on but they slayed very very hard.

**seanderlust** (11): they did not need to go this hard...imagine tuning into teen nick in time to catch the invention of modern music

**1998tweety** (10): nightcore bop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The fact of the matter is that Liz Gillies is the talent that makes anything gold.

**Alumineous** (10): Ngl, I never heard this before and holy shit, this slaps. But why did Liz have to take backing vocals, like I KNOW Liz can sing circles around Victoria, the fuck?

**bigbigbee** (10): Liz Gillies filming this scene was the same age (18) as IVE Jang Wonyoung currently is

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Outsold Meghan Trainer (but just a little because “No” is also a slay idc idc)

**Carnie** (10): we love liz gillies

**CrimsonROSET** (10): they peaked at this tbh

**datosabona** (10): invented rejection

**diamondsandglass** (10): you'd be here, and I'd be on a yacht OH

**flava** (10): very bad

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The best of the *Victorious* songs, wouldn’t be mad if this won.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): YOU ASKED ME WHAT MY SIGN IS AND I SAID STOP is an underrated iconic asf line 💅

**intheaftermath** (10): i love this song but the nightcore version will always have my heart

**jaztinax** (10): they invented feminism

**plastichaxan** (10): THIS FUCKS SO MUCH HOLY SHIT

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): my second choice for eleven, this song was life changing to elementary school me

**RandomHypnotica** (10): there's a reason this is the smasha

**ricki** (10): the same tension chad and ryan had in "i dont danc" is here

**runaway3212** (10): girlbossing before it was cool

**throwaway-7650** (10): the "bite me in the / ask" lines are genius wordplay actually

**welcome2thejam** (10): Flawless victory

**xxipil0ts** (10): pride month anthem

**anothertown** (9): why isn't liz the lead in any of these songs

**apatel27** (9): What's with the We Are Number One opening

**bluetriangles04** (9): this is literally the blueprint to meghan trainor's NO and you won't convince me otherwise

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): absolutely ate.

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): Feminism

**vayyiqra** (9): why is this so damn catchy

**Zypker125** (9): A 2010 kids show song sending better feminist messaging than most modern songs while still being a certified bop, no choice but to stan. Also, the Nightcore version of this song SLAPS (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW2ajAVyfA) and I’m not going to apologize for saying that

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8.5): ended men!

**frogaranaman** (8): oh they SLAAYED, ended men invented girlboss

**nt96** (8): ended men

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): These lyrics are insane for a kids TV show omg

**slimboyfriend** (8): I swear if victorious ran for three more years they’d end up saying ass, shit, fuck, pussy, dick, and c*nt all the time

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): “you asked me what my sign is and i told you it was stop” is such an underrated line in this

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): why are they talking about buying drinks arent they 16 … also censor of t*ts

**missdarbusisaqueen** (7): Love the message! I wonder if this is about Dan Schneider

#Thinks this song could use a mint (and some more rewrites)

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Yes it sounds very sassy I guess

**fadedblue09** (6): I love the message but this really could've been better

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): this feels like its not from a kids show but instead just a rejected demo from a pop singer who isn’t 16

**cremeebrulee** (3.7): some of this is good but god that chorus is so clunky it fucking sucks!!!

**Roxieloxie** (2.3): okay not to like make a comment that takes it too deep in a rate about pop songs from kids shows but I think because this is not one i really remember from the show Im just kinda weirded by it a tad. Like the best way I can describe this song is that all the 'kid friendly censoring' in this song feels like when tiktokers used to do the thing where they sung songs with the N word in them and so they'd just cover their mouth coyly and make a thing about it. LIke thats kinda what this feels like. and also like, them doing this knowing now that the writers were creeps, like the call is coming from inside the house honey.

**yearofthesoup** (1.3): This song gives me the ick

**shhhneak** (1): Take the hint that there’s far too many Victorious songs in this rate.

**Zypker125** (5.689): Never seen Lizzie McGuire, Drake & Josh, Jackson VP, JONAS, or Zoey 101, they unfortunately were before my time. Wizards of Waverly Place, Good Luck Charlie, and Austin & Ally were shows that I liked (not as much as Victorious, though). I enjoyed Princess Protection Program, it was a movie that knew what it was and didn’t pretend to be anything beyond it, and it was executed well.

**flava** (5.611): I’m so close

**apatel27** (4.111): Not really fair having a bunch of OPs here given they're only meant to be listened to for a half a minute.

**AHSWeeknd** (9.000): why am I such a simp for “yas” and “slay” music?

**fadedblue09** (8.875): People hating on this are giving me weird older sibling bully types. Just grow up amd accept that Disney got creative here and actually struck gold with this concept

**jasannn** (8.125): I like how their wigs got worse with each movie

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.125): Here’s the thing. The production on this is so crisp and slick these are practically k-pop songs in English. Also, things here are so over-the-top and full of commitment it’s gaudy and camp to the point where I’m entertained and enjoying myself. Not all the franchises have THAT!

**thegolding** (8.000): 9

**Alumineous** (8.000): I'm watching The Boys right now and honestly these songs could be character songs for The Seven.

**babadork** (7.750): I had been considering watching The Descendants, and this rate is a more acceptable reason than my love of the horrible Grinch musical Booboo Stewart was in.

**Zypker125** (7.700): IDC what y’all say, the Descendants trilogy was easily among the best stuff Disney Channel put out. Descendants 2 was the best DCOM as well. People might let dumb things like “overplay” overshadow their opinions, but Descendants truly worked. The premise of “main characters with villain origins” was an amazing launchpad for the stories that followed. Mal/Ben was the best-developed relationship of any relationship in live-action Disney/Nick.

**throwaway-7650** (7.125): shockingly not my worst disney average in the rate

**NecroDolphinn** (6.875): Having a cousin hyperfixated on Descendants means that every one of these songs is punched into the deep recesses of my mind even though I can’t remember a single plot point. It's very odd.

**welcome2thejam** (6.750): Alright which one of you fucked Jafar???

**OliviaGodrigo** (6.750): Dove Cameron probably has nightmares every day thinking about this franchise

**indie\_fan\_** (6.700): The issue with Descendants music for me is that they rely a lot on the context of the movie(s), more than the other franchises here imo. The first one I saw as a kid when it first dropped. Without the context... yeah.

**jsonphile** (6.125): despite me being way too old for Disney channel by the time this came out, I ended up watching all three movies because my sister said they’re a good time to make fun of. And yeah, they’re pretty dumb.

**bigbigbee** (6.125): I don’t have any true ill will towards the Descendants, and I would have eaten it UP if I were a kid when it came out. That being said, the series reflects Disney’s recent, annoyingly navel-gazing practices - obsessed with their own history and obsessed with growing and solidifying The Brand, which sucks !

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.500): Uh oh, this is the only franchise here I have no experience with

**plastichaxan** (5.250): Haven’t seen but wow they had a good song good for them

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.000): i know exactly nothing about this franchise

**Roxieloxie** (4.750): I watched the first one of these for the first time a few days ago and they really forced it to be a musical.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.500): the first descendants movie was the last disney movie i have memories of watching so i have a bit of a soft spot for it. the same cannot be said about the sequels…

**anothertown** (3.250): the only thing i know about this (movie?s? show?) is that one post about how they had a character for Dopey's son which means dopey has canonically fucked

**flava** (2.875): by this point in the playlist I was fully broken

**apatel27** (2.750): Disney used to be good at musicals

**TiltControls** (2.000): One of my old roommates knew someone who was on the cast. Whoever they are I feel for them

**frogaranaman** (1.750): this is just a BLACKPINK album

**babadork** (10.000): Wet Side Story? Butchy? Are we sure this is real?

**plastichaxan** (10.000): Now I ate this movie up I watched once and was hooked and I was too old for it but like ugh this slays I can’t believe my meow meows will be robbed

**nightstar14** (9.500): their best musical ever id say. ross lynch is so hot

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.500): maybe i need to actually watch teen beach movie sometime theres no reason for the music to go this hard

**apatel27** (9.000): Looks like a fun movie that overstays it's welcome

**anothertown** (8.500): the one disney/nickelodeon thing from the 2010s that i thought was good bordering on great. you have a premise that's so dumb it comes back around to being good. magical realism, the hallmark of every old classic DCOM. acting so inane that it fits the premise perfectly. awful songs i love to hear. proper big musical numbers. now that i'm thinking about it it might be perfect

**throwaway-7650** (8.450): this movie needs a broadway adaptation ASAP

**jasannn** (7.750): The second movie was so bad and a terrible ending that got rid of any character development that it didn’t make this rate.

**thegolding** (7.500): 9

**LesApfels** (7.250): Justice for Falling For Ya and Like Me

**AHSWeeknd** (7.000): I like the straightforward title. It really lets me know what I’m getting into.

**2dina3dworld** (6.750): very underrated, this movie was actually really good, and it feels like not a lot of people acknowledge that. Also Falling for Ya should’ve been in the rate.

**akanewasright** (6.250): I think I like the idea of this better than I liked the movie itself… like there are some good ideas that flop in execution

**Zypker125** (5.750): Teen Beach Movie had an intriguing “meta” premise that quickly showed it didn’t have much potential beyond the initial wow factor of its premise, and I think it’s reflected in the songs, which are mostly cookie-cutter “harken-backs” to prior decades’ songs.

**Roxieloxie** (5.500): You know my brother has been having a teen beach movie phase since we got disney plus which is interesting because when it came out, we didnt have cable anymore. Im still not sure what he sees in it but I think him constantly watching has been having an effect on me

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.000): the last DCOM i watched #yas

**fadedblue09** (5.000): The music here did not really impress me but I gotta admire Disney for pulling such a heavy concept for kids' movie standards. And the sequel was cute too

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.000): Not as exciting as you’d think for a beach-themed movie starring Ross Lynch

**thisusernameisntlong** (4.500): this has got to be the worst title for a movie ever like why would I watch a 2 hour beach episode

**bigbigbee** (3.750): person whose conception of 50s nostalgia was informed completely by a local community production of Grease in which they censored all the swears

**missdarbusisaqueen** (1.750): I enjoy this movie but not the songs tbh

**Roxieloxie** (10.333): I mentioned it already in my comment for Jump In but like [2] Representation^TM

**AHSWeeknd** (9.000): First woc to get a show on Disney since Raven. Actually, I don’t know if that’s correct.

**thegolding** (8.667): 5

**agentofscranton** (8.333): there were episodes in this show where it was legitimately one of the funniest shows I've ever seen

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.033): i loved ant farm a lot more than a normal kid growing up should tbh

**throwaway-7650** (8.000): curse the dynamite cover for ruining the 10 average

**akanewasright** (7.333): this show was genuinely pretty terrible a lot of the time, but China Anne McClain was a GODSEND of a Disney star, so the songs are generally pretty alright

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.833): this is like the last disney channel show i watched before i got too old rip…i remember i was mad asf when they cancelled it.

**Zypker125** (6.700): This was surprisingly a show that I watched a lot in my childhood, even if I don’t remember much about it. All I remember was that my tween self was very mad at the fact that Olive and Fletcher got together a mere 2 episodes before the show ended and we didn’t get to see more of them (still mad about it today tbh)

**bigbigbee** (6.667): China Anne McClain can actually sing which was a nice break from a lot of this rate

**OliviaGodrigo** (6.667): I wish we could’ve rated Unstoppable

**fadedblue09** (6.333): I used to think this series was about a bunch of insect nerds or something

**welcome2thejam** (6.333): Think this is the only franchise here that I knew absolutely nothing about except the name (edit: WTF is Austin & Ally!?)

**plastichaxan** (6.333): Okay I felt I was too old for this when it aired and watched glee instead?? ctfu

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.000): wack farm

**thisusernameisntlong** (10.333): Mickey Mouse was created so that this slay could eventually happen

**throwaway-7650** (10.333): best DCOM ever. bridgit mendler is MOTHERRR

**Alumineous** (10.000): You know, I honestly appreciate Disney making a movie about friendship, hardship, trying to find your own identity, and working hard to achieve your dreams. Yes, it's a rip off of the Breakfast Club, but I don't mind it. And the songs are so meaningful and well crafted.

**datosabona** (10.000): best DCOM of all time. no skips

**agentofscranton** (10.000): deserved the sequel that camp rock unjustly got

**Zypker125** (9.933): Easily the best live-action Disney soundtrack and it’s not close for me. I wasn’t too big of a fan of the movie itself, but the songs have stood the test of time.

**fadedblue09** (9.667): The way I watched this movie on TV by accident, and ended up being pleasantly surprised. The plot has enough mature undertones despite being a kids' movie at its core. Definitely an underrated modern classic from Disney.

**akanewasright** (9.133): idk if this movie actually holds up, but it was one of the first Disney Channel things I watched where pretty much all of the characters had pretty big problems to sort through, and I think that’s neat. Also Bridgit Mendler is just a treasure of a vocalist

**frogaranaman** (9.000): this was the last great Disney movie

**OliviaGodrigo** (9.000): That one guy from Dog with a Blog was completely useless

**Roxieloxie** (8.900): we love lemonade and gay people

**PretentiousPegasus** (8.667): tbh I dont get the hype around lemonade mouth this was one of the more boring DCOMs. songs were good though

**thegolding** (8.333): 10

**AHSWeeknd** (8.333): a Disneyography highlight

**bookthieving** (8.333): outsold the breakfast club

**plastichaxan** (8.333): I wish I’d seen this but it didn’t air much and when it did I didn’t want to watch for some reason but it slayed

**jsonphile** (8.167): so I had never seen this movie or heard any of the songs but…these songs are actually good? And they aren’t just relying on nostalgia for me, they’re actually pretty solid songs?? I eventually decided screw it I’ll watch the movie and it was pretty decent, way better than any other Disney channel movie I’ve seen. Definitely  made the right choice of songs here, these three were the best. Also, put Naomi Scott in more musicals where she isn’t singing boring ballads like the snooze fest of a song they added in the Aladdin remake.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.000): oddly most of my nostalgia from this movie comes from a lot more recently in my life, because in high school the senior class was able to pick any disney movie they wanted in our final week and this was the one we picked, and it made me remember just how much i loved the film as a kid

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.833): this raised a whole generation of gay kids

**TiltControls** (7.667): Another show I never caught, but had some really strong songs. I hope Bridgit Mendler is out there using her degrees for good use cause I would love a comeback!!!

**welcome2thejam** (7.333): Wait what Determinate seemed like the obvious climax song how did they get to an arena, how are there more songs after, this rate is making me look up the plot to Lemonade Mouth smdh

**jaztinax** (7.000): i have never seen lemonade mouth or known any songs from it… and i’m lowkey mad about it because everyone seems to love it so much. tell me i’m not the only mid 20s disney girlie who has this experience. tbf everyone my age was completely over disney by 2009 and i was still holding on until 2010

**apatel27** (6.667): What a wild cast. The lead singer dropped out of the limelight, came back to make an alt pop banger, then dipped again. The rapper was arrested for robbing a bank, the guitar player is a lesbian pop icon and the bassist is a disney princess.

**anothertown** (6.000): i didnt know there was a white boy rapper in this

**missdarbusisaqueen** (5.833): Another one I pretended I was too old to enjoy

**cremeebrulee** (5.667): this movie is genuinely so overrated. determinate slayed i'll give it that

**ricki** (5.667): "i love all disney channel movies from the early 2000s to early 2010s equally!!" [later that day] "i dont care for lemonade mouth"

**throwaway-7650** (10.000): shamlessly giving these the 10 average they deserve

**Hulnia** (10.000): lol this is the only thing in the rate i’ve actually ever seen and i think it shows

**plastichaxan** (9.750): Kinda a show for hyperpop girlies if you think about it

**cremeebrulee** (8.675): this is not the clit of the rate but it's definitely an erogenous zone

**fadedblue09** (8.625): As a kid, I never got to watch a lot from this series because the premise did not really appeal to me (I hate dancing!!) But listening to the music convinced me that I was probably wrong. Can't wait to revisit this when Disney+ launches in my country.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.500): this show is uncomfortable to watch

**Alumineous** (8.500): But like, this show was kinda underrated? On another note, I have flashbacks of that debit card episode to this day. I can accept Disney painting false hopes of fame, but instilling bad financial habits? TOO FAR.

**OliviaGodrigo** (8.000): The Shake It Up soundtracks were like the Disney Channel version of drag queen music

**AHSWeeknd** (7.500): Zendaya been killing it

**thegolding** (7.250): 5

**akanewasright** (7.250): this show sucks ass but these songs (mostly) aren’t bad

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.250): this show was my shit.

**Roxieloxie** (7.000): this is literally proto hyperpop, ill never forget the sound of bella thorne singing getcha head in the game

**missdarbusisaqueen** (7.000): Okay so I hated this show but I bought the soundtrack “for my sister” and would bop to all of the songs. Some of them still live rent free in my head

**Zypker125** (6.750): Despite being a show that was around my time, I never really got into the show. The premise never hooked me and the fact that one of the two main characters is a complete bumbling idiot was a major detractor for me. Despite those misgivings, I definitely had a childhood crush on Bella/Cece, and it’s fun to see Zendaya’s “origins” here given how much of a star she is now.

**anothertown** (6.500): the two completely different paths these girls took. that's culture!

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.500): Anyone else thought it was weird that Zendaya and Bella were rookies on the show but every song they danced to was sung by them? Things to think about

**2dina3dworld** (6.300): I used to want a pair of docs in every colour like Zendaya. The show itself I wasn’t too jazzed about, I just really really liked Zendaya

**frogaranaman** (6.250): this show was so bad that it became good. beyond camp. this is horseshoe theory I think

**nightstar14** (5.750): a fever dream

**LesApfels** (5.000): Justice for Fashion Is My Kryptonite

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.875): why are we not rating the ttylxox/something to dance for mashup that wouldve been such an easy 10

**jaztinax** (4.250): this aired just when i stopped watching disney and i’m kinda sad about it tbh! i think if i decided to pay attention or it came out earlier i would’ve loved it. but i still kept tabs on bella thorne and zendaya so i feel like i lived through this era even though i didn’t watch it???

**plastichaxan** (9.750): Second best Nickelodeon show when they crossed over with iCarly?? That was my multiverse of madness

**Zypker125** (9.250): This was THE Disney/Nick show of my childhood. I had a huge crush on Victoria Justice growing up, the songs from this show were my favorite, and I fell in love with the premise of the show. On rewatch, I’d honestly say that even without nostalgia, this show still holds up as one of the best of its time. The ensemble cast is really well-developed here, unlike many shows that fall victim to “ensemble characters that are clearly here for B-plots only”, most of the ensemble characters in Victorious get enough focus and direction to be memorable. The show has really stood the test of time and I would pay an unhealthily high sum of money for a reunion movie.

**datosabona** (8.917): If you ignore all the weird sexual stuff it’s good actually

**jaztinax** (8.833): besides zoey 101, this is the only nickelodeon live-action show i’ve really paid attention to, but i’m really glad i decided to watch it! knowing victoria justice from zoey 101 helped a lot, and i became such a huge fan of ariana immediately. the soundtrack is top-notch

**throwaway-7650** (8.667): everyone discussing which disney franchise will win... disney this disney that blah blah blah here comes victorious with a steel chair

**AHSWeeknd** (8.500): Nickelodeon had a nice little Glee on their hands and ruined it

**nightstar14** (8.333): probably has some of the best music in a tv show

**welcome2thejam** (7.833): A lot of these songs blend together, but thankfully that sound is generally solid

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.750): omfg another hit in my household…JADE AND ANDRE YOU WILL ALWAYS BE FAMOUS

**apatel27** (7.750): Easily the strongest songs of the bunch here

**TiltControls** (7.583): I never watched the show, but these tracks are probably some of the strongest in the rate as a whole

**flava** (7.417): look i haven’t watched a single episode of Victorious, but I did watch the Quinton Reviews videos so I feel like I’m an expert, and I just have to say, Elizabeth and Ariana ate Victoria

**frogaranaman** (7.333): I feel like they should have collabed with Ned's Declassified

**2dina3dworld** (7.167): went through a Victorious phase in 2021. Only 11 years too late, I don’t remember ever seeing this on tv when it was originally on

**thegolding** (7.000): 6

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.667): Which of these songs comes from the episode where Tori gets incarcerated in an Easter European prison?

**anothertown** (6.583): Avan Tudor Jogia (/ˈævən ˈdʒoʊɡiə/;[1] born February 9, 1992) is a Canadian actor. He first received recognition for portraying Danny Araujo in the television film A Girl Like Me: The Gwen Araujo Story (2006). After moving to the United States in his late teens, he landed various television roles within series such as Caprica (2009-2010).

**Roxieloxie** (6.383): doing this realized I really only care for 3 victorius songs ( and the 3rd one is not in this rate)

**fadedblue09** (6.250): Among the Nick series I watched extensively (iCarly, BTR) I always had mixed feelings towards this show because I always felt its humor was…unnecessarily crude and dirty? And its creator's current reputation doesn't help (Dan Scheneider you will be dealt with)

**cremeebrulee** (6.033): i did not care for this show too much so these songs were either surprisingly good or some of the worst i've ever heard

**OliviaGodrigo** (6.000): This show is wildly unfunny and overrated but I have to give 10s where 10s are due

**jsonphile** (5.833): I don’t really remember Victorious, I was just starting to age out of the Disney/Nick phase of my life when this show was on so I only saw a few episodes, but the people on the show were clearly very talented. It’s a shame most of these songs were kinda underwhelming, I don’t know if maybe there would be other songs I’d prefer or if all their songs hover around a “meh”.

**akanewasright** (5.500): this show has rancid vibes I’m sorry, I’m sure it was fun and these songs were good if you grew up with them, but this feels just… bad

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.417): the 15 hour victorious youtube video series really painted me a much more negative view of this show than i wouldve had otherwise

**Roxieloxie** (10.000): Im giving this section an entire 10, the nostalgia is fucking hitting right now. Suddenly im 10 again, one direction is just some british fad that'll die out before 2012 ends. ITS THE ONLY LIKFE YOU GOT SO YOU GOTTA LIVE IT BIG TIME.

**cremeebrulee** (10.000): i gave this a higher average than house of balloons

**pleasegivemeasword** (9.180): I think one of the first CDs I bought was the big time rush debut album... i don't know if that makes me look old or young in this sub but regardless they made my childhood

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.900): i tuned into them too late so i have no nostalgia here but these songs are fun…

**fadedblue09** (7.600): One of the Nick series I watched a lot back then, though I was unable to give the guys a chance music-wise. Also Logan was my favorite guy here but why does he get the awful parts in the songs 😭

**thegolding** (7.000): 4

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.500): why is every big time rush song in this rate either the best song of all time or the worst song of all time

**AHSWeeknd** (6.400): This used to be such a fun, semi-unbearable show.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.400): This is the best boyband I’ve rated this year… yeah I said it……. oh wait I just remembered we rated TXT uhhhh this is the SECOND best boyband I've rated this year!

**jaztinax** (6.200): i always knew about them but i hadn’t heard a single song by them until this year and doing this rate is the first time i listened to more than one song by them, so… it was a journey

**throwaway-7650** (6.000): are we sure BTR didn't ever LARP as why don't we?

**indie\_fan\_** (5.600): I remember really liking BTR but looking back maybe it was just because I was an easily entertained kid.

**plastichaxan** (5.460): Kinda not good but I remember thinking they were hot so I kept watching

**babadork** (4.960): I know more about Big Time Rush than before I started this rate, but I understand much less.

**Zypker125** (4.880): I was thinking that calling them “the Nickelodeon ripoff of One’s Direction” would be derogatory, but on second thought, that’s literally what they are, so

**welcome2thejam** (4.200): Deserves 75% of the misandry about to be thrown their way

**thisusernameisntlong** (3.200): I’d rather listen to the losing band from Lemonade Mouth

**jsonphile** (2.600): I swear I tried to give these guys a chance but I just could not enjoy any of these songs. Maybe it’s because I’m not a huge fan of boy band music to begin with, so this made-for-kids version of boy bands is just not going to work for me.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1.500): no

**flava** (1.000): well this was fucking garbage

**thisusernameisntlong** (10.000): I vaguely remember this show but I never remembered Demi Lovato being in it despite her character being the lead and me already knowing her from Camp RocK? Anyways this show is very fun

**plastichaxan** (8.250): I stopped watching Disney by this point kinda but I remember the songs

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.000): I still miss Tell Me Your Love Me-era music, sob

**jaztinax** (7.750): now that we know what demi was going through, this show makes me so sad. this also marked the end of the 2000s disney channel magic as it didn’t fully capture the essence that made all the other disney shows before great, but i still enjoyed it at the time. and i just love that it’s basically a children’s version of SNL

**thegolding** (7.500): 8

**Roxieloxie** (7.500): i will never forget buying the pilot of SWAC on itunes and then learning that now that itunes store had HD as a format and that i bought a version that did not work on my ipod

**throwaway-7650** (7.500): they're responsible for *so random!* #OVER

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.500): this and so random were such classics omg

**Zypker125** (7.500): This was the part of the Disney era that I had unfortunately just missed out on, which is a shame. The show’s premise really clicks with me and I’m sure I would have liked this show when I was younger.

**AHSWeeknd** (7.000): Could’ve been Demi’s Mary Tyler Moore Show moment… honestly I think it was

**2dina3dworld** (7.000): Chad Dylan Cooper was the best Disney character ever tbh

**RandomHypnotica** (6.400): i think this was the first sign of disney starting to slip

**missdarbusisaqueen** (4.750): I literally didn’t know SWAC had a soundtrack

**Alumineous** (4.000): To this day, I still wonder what Mackenzie Falls would look like as an actual show.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.750): this is kinda embarrassing to admit but i preferred the so random spinoff to this

**RandomHypnotica** (7.650): more like *camp* rock am i right

**plastichaxan** (7.583): The first one being actual camp!!! We don’t talk about the second though

**Alumineous** (7.500): First, I never went to camp in my life so my image of camp was pretty much this movie for my childhood. Two, the choreographer has a weird thing about joints. Like, the shoulder dance and Joe and Demi overextending their knees.

**nightstar14** (7.333): my personal favorite Disney original

**cremeebrulee** (7.233): i don’t think i ever finished watching camp rock LMFAO i genuinely have no nostalgia for this

**ricki** (7.167): you can see the camp rock songs were done with less love than HSM and Hannah Montana

**fadedblue09** (6.917): revisiting this made me realize that only one cast member can actually sing here

**Roxieloxie** (6.667): camp rock sure was a mess huh

**akanewasright** (6.417): these movies were plain awful, but the first one had a decent tune or two

**2dina3dworld** (6.250): Yeah, this is *Camp* Rock

**AHSWeeknd** (6.000): that first movie was great

**anothertown** (6.000): thank you rate hosts for not including gotta find you

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.000): I think we’re all really good

**OliviaGodrigo** (5.833): If we’re being honest, the only thing Camp Rock was good for is the memes

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.500): i think i only watched the first movie? i was never super into camp rock/the jonas brothers ngl

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.167): more epic than the Iliad

**TiltControls** (4.917): I'm sorry, one of the Jonas Brothers' voice (idk which one) I cannot stand

**Ghost-Quartet** (4.417): I never liked Camp Rock as a kid because it had the word “rock” in a child and as a young gay I felt like that was something I had to reject but listening to these songs back that was such a wild stance to take because this is barely rock, they just have a guitar sometimes.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.417): how are you gonna make a movie about a music camp and make the music bad

**Zypker125** (4.333): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyMrkO_kI88

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4.250): I went to the Tell Me You Love Me tour so anyone who is not Demi here is so whatever vibes to me

**jsonphile** (4.167): okay so can we all admit that this is just a bad high school musical? I don’t know why, but the HSM soundtrack has aged surprisingly well but this just sounds so much worse. I saw the first movie as a kid but I have no fondness for this anymore. And it doesn’t look like the sequel is any better

**throwaway-7650** (3.600): deserves to get a lower average than descendants

**apatel27** (2.750): Who even greenlit this idea. None of the songs are good and from what I've seen the movie itself is horrid.

**Stryxen** (2.667): like 12% pure uncut rock

**frogaranaman** (2.000): I FUCKING HATE THIS FRANCHISE SO MUCH!!!!!!

**TiltControls** (9.250): Okay I know I said my Disney Channel phase ended around Hannah Montana/HSM but my Nick phase must've lasted slightly longer cause I've got good memories of this show

**fadedblue09** (9.000): This is probably the series I've watched among all these. However, I watch iCarly for laughs and not bops, so we'll see how it holds up.

**Alumineous** (8.500): Okay, Canadians. This was the peak of the YTV era, wasn’t it? Anyway, it’s so crazy how this predates YouTube personalities, Vine stars, and the desire to be Internet famous.

**Roxieloxie** (9.500): Im so happy this was included!! Jump In, like arguably all the black shows ( or movie in this case) all have a special place in my heart just cause it was easier to convince my parents to be more lenient on what i could watch on tv if i could point and be like 'theres a black protag!' So I had this on dvd and rewatchted it alot. I watched it earlier this spring for the first time in years and honestly it still holds up. Its like a very typical dcom and the plot is kinda (hsm 1 but its not a musical) but Its very sweet and short and the ending is so sweet.

**plastichaxan** (9.917): Best Franchise ever ~~even with the Olivia song ruining my perfect 10+ average~~

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.708): literally the best movie series ever and troy’s conflict between deciding whether to go for basketball or performing (then he realises he can do both) is literally a metaphor for bisexuality…#SAWRY

**RandomHypnotica** (9.667): I'm sorry. It's a rate, i get it. I respect it. But at the same time, like, even if all the other franchises flop, like, yeah, people are gonna be upset. Which is terrible. But, like, inevitable?

**ricki** (9.250): I still believe we should have done the high school musical rate over the indieheads exchange

**jaztinax** (9.167): a true cultural reset, as in the actual definition of it. imagine a world without HSM??? can you???? exactly

**throwaway-7650** (9.167): HSM:TM:TS you will never be HSM (or glee)

**AHSWeeknd** (9.167): Talented, brilliant, incredible, show-stopping, k-totally unique

**thegolding** (9.083): 11

**emayzee** (8.942): this franchise was my marvel

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.817): this series was my childhood I still remember the excitement I felt when I got to see the third movie in theaters and I'm surprised I didn't give any of these songs my eleven

**agentofscranton** (8.792): what i've realised doing this rate is that high school musical was a study in how to take sports and make it gay as hell

**anothertown** (8.750): idk. i think these movies re-coded my DNA

**frogaranaman** (8.750): they put their whole pussy into this franchise

**cremeebrulee** (8.708): this is honestly a tier above everyone else, this movie aged amazingly and i have sm fondness for it still

**datosabona** (8.708): when will women in their late twenties release the death grip they have on this franchise

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.583): This is the latest show in the rate that I watched. Not only that, but I really enjoyed it as a theater kid myself lol. To me the music holds up in terms of melodies and production. And yeah the cast was really lightning in a bottle. The sequels are fine, some weird autotune that ruins it for me. Maybe the technology wasn’t as good in 2007 or something.

**akanewasright** (8.500): The best trilogy ever, SUCK IT STAR WARS

**jasannn** (8.250): iconic, high budget, instantly memorable

**welcome2thejam** (8.250): This series came out when I was a teenager, so while I still haven't watched a full movie, I learned a ton about it through cultural osmosis and watching clips. It's the one franchise in this rate I have solid nostalgia for.

**jsonphile** (8.125): okay so this was my childhood right here. If someone said I was biased towards these songs and my rate shouldn’t count I would understand but I’m trying to be fair here. Granted, yes the songs here probably would be a 6 or 7 in a rate against “real” music but we’re rating on a Disney/Nickelodeon scale here. And some of these songs I both ironically and unironically bop to. Also, should’ve been more HSM3. Can I have this dance, Scream, boys are back, are all great songs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.917): literally the best movie trilogy of all time dni if you disagree

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.750): HSM2 is the best one, I am not going to argue this

**bigbigbee** (7.542): I remember when I was 12, in art class, the teacher let us play music when we were painting and drawing. One day, one of my friends said “Let’s play High School Musical!” and another “cool” boy rolled his eyes and said, “Let’s NOT and say we did.” That was maybe my first exposure to the concept of “cringe”: that some of my interests were apparently uncool. I actually had a HSM-hate phase around then; I won’t blame that on that boy, but my thought that I needed “real, grown up” interests is related. Anyway, despite being prime age for it, I’m not really nostalgic for this series. I think it holds up, though - the music is catchy, fun, and funny. But I think the vocals are very thin and have an “autotuned” feeling that can be grating. (See also: the A Chorus Line revival) But it’s still a ton of fun, and I look back on this series fondly now!

**2dina3dworld** (7.417): oh lol I lost all of my friends in primary school because I didn’t like HSM3. Anyway, HSM2 was the best movie of the three, easily

**TiltControls** (6.500): Like Hannah Montana, this came out a little past my Disney Channel age. I remember HSM being everywhere for a while. Heck, even my middle school did a stage adaptation of it! While I don't look back on this one as fondly as Hannah Montana I can't deny that there are a ton of great tracks across the series

**OliviaGodrigo** (6.500): Why did Monique Coleman get 0 songs

**apatel27** (6.208): The first one was definitely a moment, still haven't watched the 2nd or 3rd one in full.

**Stryxen** (5.583): i can’t watch high school musical 1 because the music is so bad it makes me cringe,, i don’t get it!!!!

**fadedblue09** (4.958): A couple of hot takes: one is that this franchise has been hit by the Seinfeld Syndrome to me: I get that it's iconic but I just find its takes on highschool tropes too straightforward compared to later Disney releases. My other hot take is that most of the songs here suck and do not work out of context, and a lot of songs are just really awful to leasen to.

**Hulnia** (4.500): why do these songs go on for so long?

**Zypker125** (4.100): This franchise and its songs are the definitions of unflavored yogurt. Hell, even Troy and Gabriella are so vanilla that they’re an offense to the flavor of vanilla. Sharpay is also probably THE most overrated character in the history of fictional media (news flash, just because you like Ashley Tisdale doesn't mean you have to like Sharpay).

**missdarbusisaqueen** (4.083): for someone with a HSM themed username I realized that I don’t really like the songs from it

**ricki** (9.500): If I were the other disney girls i would have been so jealous of Miley because Disney was putting in their ALL to build the strongest foundation for a pop star in history.

**throwaway-7650** (9.300): miley cyrus is THEE it girl of our generation purr

**nightstar14** (9.125): the start of my pop obsession

**RandomHypnotica** (9.125): why were we discussing the cultural impact of glee vs undertale when this trumps everything

**thegolding** (9.000): 8

**jaztinax** (8.813): my holy grail, the beginning of it all. my disney channel obsession, center of my childhood is all thanks to miley and this show. hannah montana would be nothing without miley and that’s a Fact.

**plastichaxan** (8.662): Who else wanted to be an international popstar with a secret identity and ended up just being queer :person_with_hand_raised:

**OliviaGodrigo** (8.500): The Hannah Montana songs feel like the deep cuts section of Miley’s discography. It’s so far ago that I forgot it ever happened given how active and famous Miley still is lol

**jasannn** (8.438): honestly the start of my gay awakening

**akanewasright** (8.000): This is generally a truly horrible show with a handful of decent jokes/episodes, but MAN they nailed most of the soundtrack

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.438): the irony of the music she made under miley stewart being better than the music under hannah montana

**TiltControls** (6.375): Hannah Montana came out right at the end of when I was the prime age to watch the disney channel so at the time I don't think I looked upon it too fondly, but in hindsight it was a super solid show overall. Kind of nostalgic for it now compared to some of the other shows on the list I hadn't seen a single scene from.

**jsonphile** (6.313): I did watch some of Hannah Montana and knew a handful of her songs, so it surprised me that I only recognized 3 songs here (BOBW, hoedown, nobody’s perfect). But the other songs were also generally pretty good, her music has aged surprisingly better than I would’ve guessed. Except hoedown that’s still terrible sorry.

**Roxieloxie** (6.300): I think my sweet spot for hannah is like parts of HM2: meet miley cyrus/ The movie soundtrack/HM3

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.875): I was… pleasantly surprised by how rock-y these songs are? I forgot this was the sound of pop in the 2000’s… I miss it

**indie\_fan\_** (5.725): I have no nostalgia glasses on for this section because I never watched a full episode of Hannah montana

**flava** (5.688): it seems the nostalgia glasses were glued to my face for this section of the rate

**Zypker125** (5.175): NGL I never watched this show, just a 10-minute compilation video on YouTube of all the times Miley revealed she was Hannah Montana (let’s be real, those were the juicy parts).

**frogaranaman** (5.000): honestly slay

**babadork** (4.963): I didn’t expect to be this opposed to the music of Hannah Montana.

**AHSWeeknd** (4.875): She snapped, not too hard though.

**2dina3dworld** (4.750): I hated Hannah Montana as a kid because she liked boys and played “adult” by trying to be mature and responsible and seven year old me found that so boring… I’m still the same thirteen years on

**fadedblue09** (4.563): It's pretty well known that I'm not a big fan of Miley, so I knew this was gonna be a tough challenge going in. And unfortunately, it looks like I was proven right. Most songs were just meandering and did not really suit her vocal tone, and a couple songs here were just downright unlistenable. I respect what she did for a lot of kids but it's just not for me

**apatel27** (3.625): I'm sure if I had some deepseated nostalgia or this introduced me to pop it would score higher but it's just not good.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3.563): i also never really watched this show apart from a few episodes LMAO so not a whole lot of recognition/nostalgia here

ImADudeDuh: # The Cheetah Girls

---

**Overall Average**: 7.274 **// Average Controversy:** 2.012

---

ImADudeDuh: I have never seen a single minute of the entire Cheetah Girls franchise outside of watching commercials for Strut.

---

* \#11: Strut | 7.965 | 748.7
* \#18: Cinderella | 7.753 | 728.8
* \#27: The Party's Just Begun | 7.470 | 702.2
* \#43: Cheetah Sisters | 6.986 | 656.7
* \#65: Cheetah Love | 6.198 | 582.6

---

**Carnie** (9.900): the best western girl group of all time

**jaztinax** (9.800): the cheetah girls were truly a perfect group in the sense of how inspirational they were for young girls like me. they were the absolute, ultimate goal and i’m still mad i never got to be in a girl group like this, even if it was just for fun

**thegolding** (9.600): 10

**agentofscranton** (9.400): there was a character in these movies called Drinka Champagne and I don't think that gets talked about enough

**emayzee** (8.760): in my mind this is not a trilogy and the first two movies are the only ones that exist

**OliviaGodrigo** (8.400): They taught me feminism

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.200): if Disney+ Turkey had 2 and 3 I feel like I could’ve given them a higher average because these are good

**fadedblue09** (8.100): Can't remember if I watched a Cheetah Girls movie, but their stuff holds up well. Really enjoyed their soulful vocal flavors

**plastichaxan** (8.100): This was so latina why didn’t it air in Disney LatAm that much it’s giving racism they kept playing HSM everyday why not this for a change

**Alumineous** (8.000): I always had a low opinion of the Cheetah Girls, but after hearing these songs… They definitely have some pipes. I might need to check this series out.

**bookthieving** (8.000): the cheetah girls get a +1 boost for being the only concert i had gone to before college

**throwaway-7650** (7.900): a franchise I knew nothing about until this rate

**ricki** (7.900): fuego deserved to be in this rate but idk if anyone other than me actually knows that song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.700): i dont think ive ever actually seen any of the cheetah girls movies but i played the ds game religiously so i think thats enough for me to say this is nostalgic

**nightstar14** (7.200): idk why i never got into this franchise

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.200): Okay, story time! So the Cheetah Girls had a concert at our local park (sans Raven, so I wasn’t *as* interested but I still went), and on the way me and my parents stopped at McDonalds. Suddenly my dad starts looking at this car full of women and tells me “I think those are the Cheetah Girls.” I did not believe him, but he decided to do a very embarrassing dad thing and yell at them “HEY! ARE YOU THE CHEETAH GIRLS??” I was mortified, but all they did was stare at each other and awkwardly laugh. Come concert time, and I’m like 95% sure those WERE the Cheetah Girls. So uh… yeah. Sorry Cheetah Girls if my dad made you uncomfortable. I hope you at least enjoyed your Big Macs.

**Roxieloxie** (6.800): My scores for this kept going down but that wasnt intentional. I think alot of my personal faves werent in here but that makes sense

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.400): never seen this but these songs are fun

**apatel27** (5.800): Get what they're going for but it's just so safe

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.660): I saw the first movie when I was a tween and enjoyed it. Unlike Taylor Swift, I DID listen to 3LW so knew Adrienne and Kiely from that. But again I dislike Raven’s singing and the production is so bad to me that my minimal nostalgia can’t save it.

**jsonphile** (5.600): I like these songs more than I thought I would. Didn’t like all of them, but I never watched/listened to cheetah girls as a kid (I’d say because I was a boy, but I did watch Hannah Montana), so pleasantly surprised that 3/5 songs were pretty good.

**Stryxen** (5.000): literally who are these ladies. Never heard of them. Industry plants

**flava** (4.900): it’s kinda funny the cheetah girls named themselves after an animal that can run really fast but will die if it does it for longer than like 30 seconds

**frogaranaman** (4.600): I don't think I was allowed to watch this series as a kid

**Zypker125** (3.920): If I called the Cheetah Girls “discount Spice Girls” I wonder how many Redditors would awaken from the grave

**AHSWeeknd** (3.000): This franchise was Disney’s attempt at making Raven Symoné into Nicole Scherzinger. I swear I don’t hate them, it’s just so phoned in.

ImADudeDuh: # That's So Raven

---

**Overall Average**: 7.519 **// Average Controversy:** 1.792

---

ImADudeDuh: I remember I was traumatized by the cow episode and I think they had a clip show episode where there was a scene that was like Raven was in a display of a stomach and that also scared me, I don't think I ever saw that episode.

---

* \#21: That's So Raven | 7.616 | 715.9
* \#30: Some Call It Magic | 7.422 | 697.7

---

**RandomHypnotica** (10.000): genuinely one of disney's best shows, it has held up SO well

**Carnie** (10.000): BEST disney show of ALL TIME! no questions. when she ended racism with that baby cam in chelsea's hat??? if boyz in motion was in this rate it would be OVER for the other girlies

**Roxieloxie** (9.500): Raven is kinda a mess but what wlw isnt [*canned audience laughter*]

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.500): i think i was too young to really remember this show that well which is a shame because from what little i remember it was really fun an enjoyable, not to mention how amazing the music in this rate from it is

**throwaway-7650** (9.000): That's so ravennnnnnn! Love her. 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪

**anothertown** (9.000): lesbians iykyk

**emayzee** (9.000): truly the best disney channel show ever

**jaztinax** (8.750): hannah montana was my introduction to disney channel, so this show came afterwards for me, but i fell in love with it just as much as i fell in love with the rest of disney channel at the time. unfortunately i didn’t get to experience it in real time, but raven was such an it-girl for me when i first started getting into this + the cheetah girls. a true gem in the 2000s disney world!

**TiltControls** (8.000): One of the only shows on the list with multiple songs I actually watched regularly back in the day. That theme song still pops up in my head from time to time

**thegolding** (7.500): 10

**AHSWeeknd** (7.500): Raven Symoné you will always be funny

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.500): i actually didn’t grow up with this but from what i remember…raven chelsea and cory all girlbosses

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.500): It's been YEARS since I've seen Raven… but from what I remember it was very good

**plastichaxan** (7.500): I don’t have that much nostalgia for this but now that I think about it it didn’t air much in Disney LatAm hmmm

**akanewasright** (6.750): this was not a music show, and it was before I started watching Disney channel, but I’ve watched a little on Disney plus and it really holds up pretty well from the bits I’ve seen. Raven Symone is a pretty fantastic comedic performer

**welcome2thejam** (6.000): Only show here I've actually watched full episodes of, shoutout early teenage crush Chelsea

**frogaranaman** (5.500): the way I don't remember most of this show

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.250): I was young enough to know this show and watch a fair share of it. I liked Raven well-enough but I kind of hate her singing voice? So this will not bode well for me and the Cheetah Girls.

**apatel27** (4.500): As iconic as the OP is, That's So Raven was never a music show afaik so this was always at a disadvantage

**Zypker125** (3.700): As a diehard Ravenclaw member I feel personally attacked

TiltControls: There is no update post today due to both What Dreams Are Made Of and Strut not even making the top 10 OR an 8+ average. Thank you for your understanding

Anyways you should all go do the [Video Game Instrumental Rate](https://redd.it/wqr7y2) that is open right now
[/r/popheads/comments/xhqua3/live_action_nickelodeondisney_channel_rate_reveal/iozxqmn/]

=====

TiltControls: ...jk

Thanks to Dude, TK, and Naps for hosting! These results are failing to process in my brain, but it was a fun rate and a great reveal!

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates are up! 

## Songs

* Congrats to our winner **Take a Hint**! With an 8.500 it becomes the 3rd lowest rate winner overall, beating only The Feels and Rolling in the Deep's scores

 * Across all songs it places 1047th and ties ABBA's The Winner Takes It All, Kylie Minogue's Aphrodite, Shygirl's SLIME, and Billie Eilish's NDA

* **Introducing Me** just barely makes it into the top 25 most controversial songs! Unforunately this also spells the end for All Stars 3 Closer, leaving only two other versions in the song on the leaderboard.

* **Introducing Me** also lands on the most 0's leaderboard, also in 25th! Its collection of 17 ties it with a slew of songs including Britney Spears' Private Show, The Chainsmokers' Closer (2016 EP Rate Version), Cashmere Cat's 9 (After Coachella), and 645AR's Sum Bout U.

## Artists

* There's a new artist in the no 0's range! Despite a song from her series (and her RL person) picking up a few 0s, there were no 0s given to a song sung by the artist **Hannah Montana** herself. As such, she joins a list of 13 other artists who have yet to pick up a 0. 

 * This includes fellow ratee **The Jonas Brothers** who managed to keep their 0-less streak going yet another rate (though the individual brothers definitely picked up a few). They tie Erykah Badu for longest active streak of no 0's picked up at 17 songs each.

* **Big Time Rush** ends up on the most controversial artists list, sneaking right in to 10th place. They knock Kiiara off the list

* **Ariana Grande** ties Nicki Minaj, for most appearances in rates. This is her 20th rate across all that we've done.

A ton of artists getting their first leaderboard appearance so this list is going to be a bit long. Ranking is out of 333 artists
