---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Listen, this song had me hooked on it for like 10 years. This is such a ??? concept for a song, especially for a CHILDREN'S SHOW, but it is just the hookiest hook in the whole rate. I made my own choreo to this song as a child which I still remember to this day. Sorry, to people that find it weird that someone would make a love song dedicated to the brother of their best friend, but maybe loosen up a bit and just enjoy the bop?

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i love her vocal orgasm on this one but i do find it funny imagining her trying to perform it live

---

#Help me best friend's bro, I'm stuck

**1998tweety** (10): whore anthem

**anothertown** (10): :slamming my hands on the podium at the democratic national convention: BFB! BFB!!

**bogo** (10): i can still remember tori singing this while it's pouring down rain

**followingfreeways** (10): another contender for my 11 what a BANGER

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is literally a kesha song

**Roxieloxie** (10): this song was in an episode that had a plot irrelevant to this so i dont even know why they pushed this as a thing. But this song right here???? gave me such unrealistic expectations about love. I didnt even have a best friend at the time let alone one with a brother but i was so sure this song was going to be relevant in my life. I made up a whole choreography to this song. This is another 11 here

**akanewasright** (9): what the hell is this JDJDHDHD

**Alumineous** (9): I actually really like this song. But damn, I find it hard to listen to this song because it sounds like a gay porn plot.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): performing in that rain? Literally could not be me

**babadork** (8.9): “And you’d know what I mean/If you weren’t RELAAAATED” is one of the best moments in this rate.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This is the kind of song that could only be sung by a child actor.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): yeah I’ve been there done that 😔

**plastichaxan** (8.5): this has happened to me but like with their dads

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): I wanted a friend with a hot brother back in the day but they were all either significantly younger than us or ugly as sin.

**TheQueenofVultures** (8.5): Maisie Peters is a plagiarist

**nightstar14** (8): not a big fan of the BFB thing but its a bop

**ricki** (8): jessie's momhas got it going on

**runaway3212** (8): she really gave it all

**apatel27** (7.5): Just fuck him already

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): a Katy Perry song

**AHSWeeknd** (7): The fact that they used to make episodes centred around the songs written for the show then couldn’t figure out an episode for this and just stuffed it into a random one.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Sigh whatever happened to ovaries before brovaries??

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): the fact this was a song airing on nick is so funny?

**Zypker125** (7): But what if your best friend is your mom?

#😐😐😐😐

**bigbigbee** (6): imagining anyone saying “you’d think they were hot if you weren’t related” about any member of my family immediately wipes the smile off my face. song’s fun though!

**bluetriangles04** (6): growing up all of my best friend's brothers were pretty fucked up so I never understood this song 😭

**jaztinax** (6): this song is a little too straight for me

**seanderlust** (6): this is fine but I think it doesn't have the staying power that other victorious tracks here do...it kind of sounds at points like either the singer or some of the synths are out of key?? or at least a bit pitchy

**vayyiqra** (6): RIP Dachi :pensive:

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Tori why

**welcome2thejam** (6): My Best Friend's Brother has got it going on

**shhhneak** (5.1): HOW DID THIS REACH BILLBOARD TOP 100 DJKDDKSK

**intheaftermath** (5): definitely the dud of the Victorious soundtrack. It sounds more disjointed than most and why... why does it matter that he's your best friend's brother? That's still allowed? it's legal???

**slimboyfriend** (5): this song feels so horny

**TiltControls** (5): The one sort of miss of the Victorious tracks

**jackisboredtoday** (4.6): musically most of this is serviceable but these lyrics…. oof

**fadedblue09** (4.5): The song title is already weird and lyrics did not help at all

**frogaranaman** (4): why is this sung so incestuous ????

**missdarbusisaqueen** (4): This is one of the songs I listened to in secret when I thought I aged out of Disney/Nick lol

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): i literally do not remember this song at all…and for good reason

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): family friendly Pass This On

**throwaway-7650** (4): why there a camp rock song in the victorious section

**jsonphile** (3): chanting “B!F!B!” is one of the worst choruses I’ve ever heard.

**OliviaGodrigo** (2): is this about Frankie Grande?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): oh this singing is absolutely dreadful

**2dina3dworld** (1): anything about banging your best friends brother is just… yeah nah for me. I’ve been there, done that, and my feelings on the topic are complicated but any song about dating your best friends brother just automatically turns me off

**CarlieScion** (1): help

**Stryxen** (1): :/

So Far:So Great


---

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): Demi's 3rd starring role (I also count As The Bell Rings along with Camp Rock) needs a memorable theme song and she makes a very optimistic song about fame ~~especially compared to their later work.~~ The chorus and verses are very fun and bouncy, and the "ba ba bada da" is catchy af. However, the bridge really stops the fun of the song to give them a deep introspective moment and kinda kills some of the fun. Still a good song though. YEOWWWW!!!

**TragicKingdom1** (6): i get the concept but its trying too hard to be quirky

---

#So Great!

**2dina3dworld** (10): SO TRUE!!!!!

**ricki** (10): this went #1 on the ricki mp3 billboard chart once i was able to find the full version. before that i would just replay the theme over and over again on youtube

**runaway3212** (10): demi lovato i just stan your voice

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): the subtitles on Disney+ can’t figure out the right spelling for the “yow!” in the end

**anothertown** (9): gigantic bop i loved this song

**plastichaxan** (8.5): me with the rate ~~except for the nick jonas song~~

**bluetriangles04** (8): whenever I watched sonny with a chance to go to sleep this loud ass intro would ALWAYS wake me up but its good so I didn't complain

**CrimsonROSET** (8): only so far

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): Demi is just such a good singer 😭😭

**jaztinax** (8): the go-to pick me up song of my teens

**nightstar14** (8): i lovedd demi at this time so i ate this song up

**poppinmmolly** (8): if you asked me to rate this in 2009 it'd be my 11

**PretentiousPegasus** (8): Its a great song, a shame Sonny with a chance was kind of the flop disney show of that era

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): the verses definitely outsell the chorus

**welcome2thejam** (8): It did not need that final "yow!"

**1998tweety** (7): iconic

**akanewasright** (7): this is the musical equivalent of the way too big smile Demi faked throughout their early years at Disney ~~but it works here I think~~

**bogo** (7): HOLY H3CK

**intheaftermath** (7): I think I Mandela Effected myself into thinking there was a Club Penguin party for this show???

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): it's fun

**shhhneak** (6.5): This show was so underrated, I must say!! Demi could’ve been an incredible comedic actress but her potential was wasted.

#So-so

**datosabona** (6): demi lovato’s vocals in this fill me with a primal anger

**frogaranaman** (6): some of these skits were SO funny

**AHSWeeknd** (5): This ain’t it

**CarlieScion** (5): boring

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This is a weirdly long two minutes

**Stryxen** (5): meh and forgettable but a welcome relief after camp cock

**throwaway-7650** (5): literally so unremarkable? I have no idea what to comment

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Even when watching Disney Channel as a kid, this was not one of my favorite theme songs…

**Zypker125** (5): Kinda underwhelming for a Disney theme song, ngl.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): this is so generic and forgettable

**Alumineous** (4): Does she REALLY have to end every song with yeaHH!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): So far, so mid (my laziest comment yet?)

**vayyiqra** (4): This is not great

**apatel27** (3): LOUD LOUD LOUD

**missdarbusisaqueen** (3): I love Demi but it’s grating. The bridge slaps tho

**yearofthesoup** (2.6): Pretty annoying - "let's have Demi yell while becoming the musical embodiment of that weird in-turned knees dance"

---

**TragicKingdom1** (6): i'm glad Zendaya realized that this kind of electropop is completely overwhelming to a vocalist like her, but i wish she didn't realize that acting was a better path for her because Replay BOPPED!

**ImADudeDuh** (5): get rid of the electro dance production and change like 4 nouns around and this could work as a Hunger Games movie song.

---

#Dancing for this!

**diamondsandglass** (11): still goes hard as hell

**1998tweety** (10): the way she ate Bella up Im sorry, this is a HIT

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Been killing it for a while

**Alumineous** (10): Obligatory Hunger Games vibes.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this was my 11 when I thought we were rating the mash-up

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I feel like I can fly rn

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): zendaya i love you

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): a mashup so terrible I have no choice but to 10. Also Maxipad music

**throwaway-7650** (10): going to pretend this is the mashup so I can 10 it

**fadedblue09** (9): Zendaya's vocals have this inexplicable magic quality to it

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): Zendaya was like 14 and already a triple threat god her power 😭

**musical\_pyn** (9): rina's new album is sounding really good

**plastichaxan** (9): omg she’s not the same without going into TTYLXOX in that mash-up

**vayyiqra** (9): Zendaya is Meechee

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Why does this make me wanna cry oh my god

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): wow zendaya has come a long way

**bluetriangles04** (8): these singles are the impetus for K-Pop albums including solo songs of their members and you can't convince me otherwise

**CrimsonROSET** (8): jeff probst voice: worth dancing for?

**missdarbusisaqueen** (8): Omg it kinda reminds me of that pitbull/Christina song

**Roxieloxie** (8): im just giving this the same score i gave something to dance for

**seanderlust** (7.8): someone with a better musical ear than me, does this chorus have the same chord progression as ava max's so am i or am i tripping?

**Carnie** (7): this doesnt hit the same without ttylxox in the mashup

**intheaftermath** (7): TTYLXOX and Something to Dance For are enjoyable on their own but the official mashup really elevates them. The piano under the remix should've been in the original.

**ricki** (7): i still haven't recovered from people comparing the vamps - can we dance to this

#I'll remain seated tyvm

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): TTYLXOX’s boring twin

**datosabona** (6): i thought i had been listening to this for a while and when i checked spotify only 90 seconds had passed

**ignitethephoenix** (6): the mash up outsold greatly

**nightstar14** (6): she was cute but i think i was too old to enjoy this

**PretentiousPegasus** (6): I thought this song was boring as hell as a kid and would want to skip to the TTYLXOX part of the mashup but its not as bad as i remember

**Stryxen** (6): not as good as i remember it being

**xxipil0ts** (6): it's just so weird for me that songs like this are on zendaya's discography alongside songs about drugs in euphoria

**Zypker125** (6): The vocals aren’t as powerful as they should be, but the beat and instrumental go hard.

**shhhneak** (5.9): I can see who the triple threat carrying this show was.

**jaztinax** (5.5): the best song from shake it out on this rate but the production/track is so annoying omg

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): it's cute but zendaya can do better (me talking about tom holland)

**agentofscranton** (5): can you believe rocky from shake it up is like the most famous woman on the planet rn

**akanewasright** (5): This is like that song from the Lizzie Maguire movie y’all hype up except Zendaya can actually kinda sing

**bogo** (5): this chorus has the same rhythm as ava max - so am i and i can't get over that

**frogaranaman** (4): Zendaya bb you can do better

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this needed to be at least 10% faster

**outsideeyess** (3.5): it's too earnest to like ironically

**apatel27** (3): Cascada but make it corporate America

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): This melody is so nice now WHY is there a weird scratching sound in the background the whole time??? Seriously it single handedly makes this song one of the most unpleasant songs to listen to in the rate. Zendaya I’m so sorry.

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): Zendaya got ate up by Bella Thorne which accelerated the end of her music career

**grandmafriend** (2): its like a really bad eurovision song for someone who cant actually sing

**runaway3212** (1): no thank u

SNOOP DOGG????: Yes!

---

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i adore most of this chorus but the "boy-boy-b-b-b-boyfriend" is pretty tacky and drags down the rest of the song

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this sounds like a fake boy band from a children's live action program........... ok but like one that only shows up for one episode and doesn't leave an impression on the viewer. And fun facts! This song is most known for it's [Snoop Dogg version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUOdO5dqPeU). And, this is one of the most successful songs in the entire rate, spending a total of 11 weeks on the Hot 100, the LONGEST of any song in the rate besides Breaking Free, which ties it.

#My BF <3

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): I kinda watched BTR as a kid but I wouldn’t say I have any strong nostalgia for it so I didn’t even remember this song until I accidentally clicked on it a while back while trying to find the Ariana Grande song of the same title, and wow it hit me like a wrecking ball. This is gonna sound weird but this song is like… gender affirmational for me. I tend to project vicariously through songs and there’s something about the specifically male perspective of this song that I relate to in a way I don’t often find; when I hear this I’m just like “wow I’m glad I’m a boy.” Which sounds kinda lame because I’m cisgender but as a gay guy I’ve always felt kinda alienated from that aspect of my identity so it was nice to have a little something to latch onto.

**jasannn** (11): this aged so well.

**akanewasright** (10): Thinking about the time one of my friends made me fill out a Google form with the question “you’re looking for a boyfriend I see that” and my response was “wait fuck I know this song”

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-boys!

**bluetriangles04** (10): IDGAF! this song is AMAZING and I would 11 it if I had an extra one...

**cremeebrulee** (10): need me a freak like this

**frogaranaman** (10): I have never heard a more perfect song

**nightstar14** (10): im trash for this

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): you have to be a real fun hater to dislike this song

**Roxieloxie** (10): THEE !!! SONG !!! TO END ALL SONGS!!!! HAVE YOU EVER HAD THE FEELING!!!! YOUR DRAWN TOO SOMEONE !!!!!!

**runaway3212** (10): me when im looking for a boyfriend

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): look i dont care that the snoop dogg version isnt the version we’re meant to be rating, because that one is 10x more iconic than the original already is. i mean, a nickelodeon song with a SNOOP DOGG feature? how am i supposed to not love that

**emayzee** (9.5): those slumdog millionaire and twilight references hit me like whiplash

**Alumineous** (9): Okay, after 2 meh songs, this is decent. Heavy BSB vibes.

**anothertown** (9): yup this is the ONE!

**ricki** (9): ended mustin

**fadedblue09** (8.5): the prechorus is heavenly, but the actual chorus is kinda lame

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): will go feral for kendall

**1998tweety** (8): god i wish that were me

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this snapped in the most generic boy band kind of way

**celladonn** (7): this sucks but i am bopping

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): God all these songs are unlocking so many memories for me

#Justin Bieber - Boyfriend

**AHSWeeknd** (5): why did all of these franchises dabble in R&B??

**CrimsonROSET** (5): i’m not x

**diamondsandglass** (5): pretty obnoxious tbh

**bogo** (4.5): JUSTIN BIEBER CAN SUCK IT. this song isnt good but my point still stands. (also why do they reference slumdog millionaire, what child would ever understand that reference)

**intheaftermath** (4): this is like a very weak and pathetic version of RV's Power Up. If you're going to be all pixelated video-game-core with your music then actually GO FOR IT

**jsonphile** (4): this could’ve gotten a ten if it was the snoop dogg version

**plastichaxan** (4): every time i learn more about the straight world i feel worse for women

**thedoctordances1940** (4): i think i liked this as a young'un

**vayyiqra** (4): no thanks but good luck with that

**throwaway-7650** (3.5): the ~~twinkz~~ boyz would release this song [derogatory]

**seanderlust** (3): bye this sounds like a the ready set unfinished demo

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): extra points for each g in Snoop Dogg

**Zypker125** (2.4): Hosts forgot to add the MV for this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEen7iZ8ROA Thank me later

**Stryxen** (2): almost cool but it just somehow… sucks…

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1.5): the big time rush guys are dull as hell here but get a small bump due to camp Snoop Dogg appearance. I could have lived without the Slumdog Millionaire reference

**apatel27** (1): I've heard this song before on tiktok but thought it was an SNL parody

**flava** (1): this song inspired justin bieber’s entire career, no idc if it came out after Bieber

**shhhneak** (1): This sounds wildly dated, even for this rate.

**welcome2thejam** (1): I took a sip of water just so I could spit take at "ft. Snoop Dogg"

**TiltControls** (0): There are some bad songs in the rate, but I don't think anything skeeves me out quite like this

Hmmmm: I got nothing


---

**ImADudeDuh** (9): While So Far So Great is a very optimistic song, this song's optimism feels more precarious. I don't think I can totally call this optimism. It feels more like they see the path ahead of them and they are preparing themself to face the challenges. The production of the song really adds to the anxiety of it too, intentionally or not. I really questioned if we should include this but after listening to it, I do feel glad that we did.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): this got a giant marketing push behind it and i kinda get it because it basically soft launched their Unbroken era, but on the other hand i'm not surprised this has been forgotten despite being another serve from Demi

---

#Sunny disposition 

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh it’s “Sonny with a Chance” as in sunny with a chance of rain like the weather oh I JUST got that!

**fadedblue09** (10): an 11 contender. Honestly displays more emotion and personality than most of Unbroken

**runaway3212** (10): thank u next could never

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): not the British guy disappearing right before and no one caring

**throwaway-7650** (10): poot had a point here

**Zypker125** (10): Memes aside, this is genuinely one of my favorite songs of all time. The lyrics are amazing (especially given Lovato’s later trajectory with Disney and life), the melody and vocals are synergized perfectly, the beat and instrumental go hard, and it has arguably my favorite chorus in all of pop. The song captures the perfect intersection of “dance pop banger” and “sentimental emotional piece” that I feel like pop music really can achieve that other genres can’t reach. To me, this is legitimately the epitome of pop perfection, and it would have received an 11 had arguably my favorite song of all time not been in this rate.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Inspired by Robyn

**akanewasright** (9): the way I squealed with joy when I found out that this song was on iTunes… what was wrong with me?

**datosabona** (9): actually a really fun song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): this is just a good Demi Lovato song. it would be a 9 without some weird autotune choices

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**followingfreeways** (8): i dont remember this song at ALL idk if that means im getting old or what but this is super cute

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): eat

**bogo** (7.5): haha that's not the expression, silly!

#erm actually, the phrase is "me myself and i"

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.5): sounds so good but what is this roller rink ass beat she sounds like she’s singing in a submarine 😭

**jaztinax** (7.5): this is so dated omg but i can’t help but like it

**seanderlust** (7.3): you can also make a frozen yogurt shop stop just with your attitude it seems

**anothertown** (7): you know, they tried something. what was it? i don't know

**frogaranaman** (7): who gave them the right to go this hard

**nightstar14** (7): not a standout track from this era

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): further proof demi was the best vocalist of the disney ex acts

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): what the fuck does this mean

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I feel nothing but I’m tapping my foot I guess.

**bluetriangles04** (6): if its broke DON'T FIX IT!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): me and my broken heart

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is just depressing to listen to now

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): This chorus deserves a better song :/

**cremeebrulee** (5.2): this is a victorious song (derog)

**apatel27** (5): Sounds more like the opening theme than the actual OP

**yearofthesoup** (4.9): Corny as hell but otherwise a standard Demi song of the era

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): the upload i listened to for this sounded like it was recorded underwater and i think that added to the experience

**Alumineous** (10): We all hate you Jamie Lynn, but damn, Zoey 101 made me want to live in a boarding school or be in residence so goddamn badly.

**Carnie** (10): jamie lynn SUCKS but if im gonna be perfectly honest, this is better than about 98% of britney's discography

**cremeebrulee** (10): zoey 101 absolutely does not hold up but idc its like my emotional support preteen drama

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i campaigned for this to be added because zoey 101 was my favorite of the early nick shows like it’s so slay

**IdiotBox01** (10): the bass line is seriously amazing

**jaztinax** (10): the best nick theme song tbh

**nt96** (10): Despite me not watching this show that much then, every time I hear this I get flooded with childhood memories, including some I've never experienced

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): It’s a bop but what kind of school was this honestly.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This had a chokehold on me as a child, won’t even lie, but now that I’m older Jamie Lynn Spears just makes me feel kinda icky so I had to dock a few points for that.

**missdarbusisaqueen** (8): I felt bad giving it such a high rating, then I remembered that Britney wrote it

**plastichaxan** (8): I was so scared I’d have to give this a 10 but couldn’t because my girl Britney but they really stopped putting effort into this after the intro for the show huh

**Stryxen** (8): this is making me anxious somehow

**throwaway-7650** (8): jamie lynn spears is on thin ice but this song is alright I guess...

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): if you didn’t want to go to pacific coast academy as a kid, were you really a fan?

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.5): I wanted to shit on it because it’s Jaime Lynn but it’s kinda a bop

**AHSWeeknd** (7): that one vine of the microwave hitting 1:01 and the first “oooh” playing for one second makes this song so much more iconic.

**DaHumanTorch** (7): FUCK jamie lynn but this is a bit of a classic i'm so sorry

#I'm not gonna follow your ass anywhere, Jaime Lynn Spears

**fadedblue09** (7): generic but has enjoyable moments

**poppinmmolly** (7): oohh ooo

**Roxieloxie** (7): *oooooo*

**runaway3212** (7): fuck jamie lynn ofc but this song is pretty cute

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Now THIS one took me back

**bogo** (6.5): this is a little fun. jamie may or may not be a horrible person but this is a decent song

**jackisboredtoday** (6): The complete lack of emotion in these vocals… I can see why she wasn’t the star of the family

**letsallpoo** (6): this is a vanessa carlton song

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): i haven’t even seen a clip of zoey 101 let alone a full episode, but i like how this sounds kinda…grunge?

**nightstar14** (6): cute but i dont care for it

**outsideeyess** (6): why is it so slow

**slimboyfriend** (6): jamie lynn you will never be famous (credit: some gay on twitter)

**intheaftermath** (5): so I wasn't allowed to watch this as a kid for some reason? So I put on the Official Video to try to get an idea of what this show was about. It was... well, Dixie D'Amelio was there for some reason? wth is this. anyways the song is mid

**akanewasright** (4): I can’t hear the opening without thinking of the [Rina Sawayama - Comme des Garçons edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheadscirclejerk/comments/hjymih/comme_des_gar%C3%A7ons_rina_sawayama_feat_jamie_lynn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

**apatel27** (4): She sounds so bored

**seanderlust** (3): the "are you ready" in the first five seconds gives me "a little bit alexis" which honestly i'd rather be listening to

**Zypker125** (3): Every rater should be obligated to watch this MV before rating this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfRvE_FdHwg

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): glad that this song sucks so that i can tank it for reasons not exclusively related to jamie lynn being a piece of shit

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): the most unexcited singing ever

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Yeah this is a cute Olivia Rodrigo song. I wouldn't call it bad or anything, but it does feel a bit out of place in the rate. But hey, Olivia is arguably more famous than 5/6 of the HSM cast so she deserved a song on here at least.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): sorry but olivia deserved representation in the rate and this is her most notable disney song! i think its cute but she obviously topped it several times over

---

#Good enough 4 me!

**agentofscranton** (10): the way this eats up her entire actual discography

**AHSWeeknd** (10): She should invest more in some semi-orchestral production

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The crusty old people are going to tank this and it’s so sad.

**runaway3212** (10): also a slay idc about the haters

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I can't believe she was already writing songs about Joshua Bassett

**throwaway-7650** (10): and if I say this is better than half the OG HSM songs in the rate

**emayzee** (9.5): now why is this better than half of sour

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): not only does popheads have balladphobia, but Olivia Rodrigo runs the real risk of getting the “overrated woman” treatment where people turn on her as her sophomore album looms. So, I’ll say this is really pretty! I love a good piano ballad. She sounds great here.

**diamondsandglass** (9): why is this a scrambled version of the previous song

**fadedblue09** (9): More listenable than most of the old HSM songs and more mature than most of SOUR

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): Honestly I created this account thinking I would stan her, but half of Sour turned out to be boring so I’m just stuck with this

**vayyiqra** (9): "Why does this sound like Olivia- oh"

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): oh olivia sweetie… you don't stand a chance here

**yearofthesoup** (8.7): OR has the most gorgeous voice

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): unfortunately this is pretty great

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I suppressed my inner stan and I still think this is genuinely good

**1998tweety** (8): this is cute but not her thinking she can sit with all the top girlies here....minus 1 for the obvious payola!

**bluetriangles04** (8): a star is born!

**Carnie** (8): olivia, what are you doing here? i didnt know the tiktok sound came from this lmao

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this truly could be a deluxe song on Sour

**missdarbusisaqueen** (8): Impressive! I hadn’t heard this even tho I was really into SOUR last year

**plastichaxan** (8): Olivia Rodrigo you will be dealt with

**poppinmmolly** (8): I didn't realize this TikTok sound was an Olivia Rodrigo song.

#god its brutal out here

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): actually this was kinda worse than i remember lol….. if you saw me defending this in the discord no u didnt

**bigbigbee** (7.5): aim higher.

**followingfreeways** (7.5): yeah its good but as a hsmtmts stan there are so many better songs. Stream wondering

**intheaftermath** (7.5): It's a really nice song but I don't think it accomplishes what a good Disney Channel Song should. It has nothing in it that really ties it to HSMTMTS (my god). It's clearly intended for radio/streaming consumption. It sounds like something I'd get a Spotify ad trying to convince me to listen. The lyricisim is just so generic that it's almost uncanny.

**bogo** (7): hdksjd i forgot htmtmts existed, olivia jumpscared me

**letsallpoo** (7): suddenly hearing olivia was like getting a jumpscare

**outsideeyess** (7): wow Disney letting her write her character's songs... loco

**ricki** (7): well\_i\_guess\_theres\_room\_for\_everyone.gif

**thegolding** (7): she really gives Gabriella vibes

**welcome2thejam** (7): yeah this is what i expected pre-breakout Olivia Rodrigo to sound like

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.8): I see the appeal but it’s probably because I didn’t grow up with this song, but it’s a little too downtrodden and not campy enough for the HSM franchise imo

**anothertown** (6): a sara barellies song

**apatel27** (6): Not too shabby for a first major song

**CrimsonROSET** (6): who invited you go away

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This kinda goes on for too long… like she made her point halfway through she could have just stopped.

**jaztinax** (6): i’m sorry but some of the hsmtmts originals are so forgettable although they’re pretty decent otherwise

**jsonphile** (6): a nice enough song. Obviously this girl went on to much bigger and better music than this

**nightstar14** (6): might have rated this low bc its missing the nostalgia

**PretentiousPegasus** (6): Is it a good song? Yes. and in any other rate, it would score high but it just does not have the iconic news of the rest of the songs

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): all I want is live laugh love

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It’s like *technically* good, like she’s a good singer and all, but there’s not really any personality to it, especially compared to, like, EVERY OTHER HSM song here

**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): SOUP

**akanewasright** (5): I like Olivia but she’s done this song before and better

**Stryxen** (5): good verses but the chorus falls flat

**thedoctordances1940** (5): All I Want is for this to stop

**CarlieScion** (4): no

**shhhneak** (4): All I Want you could never be I Want It All.

**TiltControls** (3.5): I loved SOUR, but sorry Olivia this just isn't it

**Roxieloxie** (3): well

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): this is like a song I don’t like from Sour

**Zypker125** (2): Rodrigo’s songs in HSMTMTS were the blandest of them all. Like literally any other song in the album was better.

**frogaranaman** (1): whose idea was it to put this song in here

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): girl why the fuck are we rating this

**LesApfels** (0): One of these is not like the others

Amigas Cheetahs: OUT


---

**TragicKingdom1** (7): cheetah love kinda does this song's whole thing but better

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I was getting stuff done for the rate, and then I realized I still haven't written anything for the song, and I think that says a lot for this song.

---

#Sisters!

**jaztinax** (11): this song is the sole reason i wanted and still want to be a cheetah girl. this song is so perfectly, stunningly crafted like there isn’t a single reason to dislike this song??

**bogo** (10): i cannot believe the effort that was put into these children's TV songs, it's breaking my brain

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): You don’t know the meaning of the term “cultural reset” if you weren’t there for this.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the CLASSIC

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): what is going on in this scene

**shhhneak** (9.7): Did more international outreach than the United Nations.

**emayzee** (9.3): PUT THIS BACK ON SPOTIFY NOW

**1998tweety** (9): its giving drama

**jsonphile** (9): okay so if we’re going by the “Barcelona mix” in the playlist this is a 9 but the linked YouTube version is like a 6. I’ll be nice to the cheetah girls here and rate the better version

**missdarbusisaqueen** (9): you can really hear Max Martin’s influence on this one LOL. Also this is definitely one of the more memorable CG songs, besides Cinderella anyway.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): that guitar solo into the chorus changed 7 year old me’s life

**plastichaxan** (8.5): i thought this would be amigas cheetahs i feel robbed

**intheaftermath** (8): oh it's good but is it "Amigas Cheetahs" good?

**nightstar14** (8): i desperately need all their outfits

**runaway3212** (8): this kinda bad but also incredibly slay

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): They're what fifth harmony thought they were

**throwaway-7650** (8): purr 🐈🐈🐈🐈

**anothertown** (7): this doesn't hit like the original

**bookthieving** (7): i'm rating the og version idc

**celladonn** (7): this starts off bad but i was enjoying it by the end

**CrimsonROSET** (7): not the barcelona mix

**ricki** (7): cheat on her???

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I really want to go to Barcelona, and I think I can trace that desire all the way back to this movie

#sis.... this is not it

**fadedblue09** (6.5): It's another vocal serve, but kinda all over the place

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): The chords in the chorus sound way off in this version and idk why

**nt96** (6): "Cuz we are sisters we stand together" lol tell that to 3LW

**Roxieloxie** (6): have you all seen the clip of the original ending of TCG 1 , im convinced when they scrapped that they made this song

**seanderlust** (6): sorry i really don't like their  voices on this one

**welcome2thejam** (6): Maaan, this was solid but after that riff I honestly wanted to see them rock

**apatel27** (5): Raven drags this down so much

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5): love that this is the song they sing after they disrupt all of Manhattan with a fancy dog falling into construction ☺️🫶

**Zypker125** (5): This song would probably be a hit amongst 60+-year-old women, but I don’t think I’m the demographic for it

**vayyiqra** (3): "Barcelona Mix" what is it with this group and Iberian culture anyway, was there a movie set in Spain or something

**AHSWeeknd** (2): half of them can’t sing 😭

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): I thought this would be iconic but this is some awful production and mixing. Like why does this sound so bad??

Ended: Your fave

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I can't explain, but they put something in this song. it's so fucking good. When she hits that high note for "chILLIN," Ariana could never. Plus, the fact that the choreography is just a few shuffles, leaning back, and looking left and right, what the hell was that? Idk but this was still catchy as hell and I think I've moved into unironic enjoyment.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): akanewasWRONG on this one cuz its the smasha!! the way this was the blueprint for Future Nostalgia and y'all slept on it smh. this song briefly made me consider that sofia carson could have a music career which is extremely impressive.

---

#Chillin' ft. Lady Gaga

**intheaftermath** (11): In a perfect world, Ways to be Wicked would be here to receive a 12. But it's not, and here we are. This song delivers everything one could ask for in a Disney Channel song. It's catchy enough that it's enjoyable alongside non-franchise pop but flamboyant, theatrical, and self-referential enough to be distinct within the movie's plot. Sofia Carson delivers a stellar vocal performance, as always (stan Evie). Everyone here sounds like they're actually enjoying themselves (or at least enjoying performing on a cast album. It's a special type of infectiously fun.

**MrMushrooms** (11): You need to give this song the 11s that it deserves

**1998tweety** (10): this BOPS

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I’m like “maybe I should watch these movies” but then I realize they’re probably not as good as the music

**Alumineous** (10): Another Homelander theme song. But I have to admit, it has city pop vibes, especially that slight horn sound in the background.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Okay I know all of the Descendants songs are getting tanked and I at least get why with Rotten to the Core and Queen of Mean but like this is just a normal, good song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Something that really changed my perspective on music was someone saying “why does every song have to be about dating” and I was like… yeah? That’s kinda true? People write off character songs from children’s films as cringe or whatever just because they have silly subject matter and unusual delivery but that’s really the only “flaw” of this song, which is smooth as hell and a ton of fun.

**poppinmmolly** (10): this has no right going this hard

**runaway3212** (10): haters can back tf off

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): is this city pop

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): This is the only track in this rate that sounds remotely like an actual pop song

**fadedblue09** (9): Has nore personality than a Future Nostalgia track

**throwaway-7650** (9): 10 if if dove cameron sang this instead of sofia carson

**jasannn** (8.5): so safe but so good

**LesApfels** (8.5): Stream Chillin' Like a Snowman https://youtu.be/zVd23SeZRMo

**DaHumanTorch** (8): dove cameron soundalike idk her name telling me to not be myself was oddly validating

**nightstar14** (8): michael jackson died for this

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): Sofia Carson is one of those celebrities who show up to every red carpet and you just wonder how she got an invite. Stream Two Tears in a Bucket, we need to give those shows a reason to keep inviting her!

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): whys this a bop (minus the speaking parts)

**ricki** (8): currently making a "how twice would sing \_\_\_\_" video to this

**Roxieloxie** (8): i was googling Lisas' verse in Ice cream to make a joke about this being bad but while i was waiting for the page to load this started bopping, like its easily the only other good song here.

**vayyiqra** (8): I love K/DA - "Villain" featuring Kim Petras and Madison Beer

**welcome2thejam** (8): Screw you all for making me listen to this early due to the discourse and getting it stuck in my head for weeks

**bigbigbee** (7.5): Oh this is what the writers of BTS Dynamite were listening to

**jsonphile** (7.5): best song from this franchise. Although the fact that they sing “once you catch this feeling” sounds a lot like “when I get that feeling” from Marvin Gaye’s Sexual Healing which is not a song I want to think about with a kids movie

**bogo** (7): watch this somehow end up in day 3 just because it's the same flavor of synthpop this sub usually eats up (note: i hope this doesn't happen)

**missdarbusisaqueen** (7): I miss when this kind of pop music was all you’d hear. Ah, pre pandemic times

**slimboyfriend** (7): this one sounds like an actual song

#Rate villains

**yearofthesoup** (7): Honestly awful lyrics but the rest is fine.

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): she sounds like Addison Rae

**bluetriangles04** (6.5): I get that these songs are written for movie/show purposes but I hate speaking parts with a fucking vengeance

**datosabona** (6): tjmaxx pop

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): what does this even mean

**Zypker125** (5.8): https://youtu.be/RX2eLus9qvk?t=79

**CrimsonROSET** (5): the instrumental for this? insane

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): why does this sound like a beat carly rae jepsen would hop on

**TiltControls** (4): The song becomes a lot more enjoyable if I don't pay attention to how annoying the lyrics are

**RandomHypnotica** (3.5): i hate this phrase with a burning passion but the song isn't *that* bad

**flava** (3): I don’t know who’s singing what and idc but that attempt at falsetto, the forced campness, the shrillness. Just end it

**frogaranaman** (3): this sounds like a Future Nostalgia cut

**akanewasright** (2): For two summers, I did lighting for a local dance studio. This was honestly a great way to make a little money, but it meant that on tech rehearsal day, I had to sit through some numbers over and over again while adjustments were made. Chillin Like A Villain was a song the for upper elementary dancers, which is the age when coordination *starts* developing in girls. This basically means that the dance teacher thought could be meaner to this group and ask them to redo numbers a lot. So yeah, I had to watch/listen to this a lot, and the more I heard this, the more I just grew to utterly hate the vocalist’s performance

**apatel27** (2): This was inspiration for the English BTS songs

People who can recognize Jordin Pruitt by a picture of her: 3, and that's generous

---

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this deserves to be in the conversation of feel good 00s songs like Unwritten and A Thousand Miles. The weird electronic bridge was not neccessary though, which is a very contentious verse in this rate! Lots of people loved it and others hated it.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): i really appreciate the chill vibe of this one compared to like 80% of this rate where its like max intensity the whole time

---

#Jumping for joy

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Wait this is really good, it makes me wanna cruise with the windows down. Hope it doesn’t get dirty for being from a lesser loved film!

**Stryxen** (10): i have no idea what this is but this is a bop.. The bleep bloop moment and the hooks on hooks on hooks	. slayed!

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): brought out my rope from the basement jk I don’t have one but I regret it now

**agentofscranton** (9.5): little pruittster since read it and weep in '06

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Jordan Pruitt had a song that charted on the Hot 100. It wasn’t this one, but still not everyone in this rate can say that!

**cremeebrulee** (9): jordan pruitt deserved better ngl

**Roxieloxie** (9): Im probably giving this a higher score because i watched jump up recently and its kinda comical how they movie uses the instrumental of this as tradition/ambient music like any chance they get. Like itll be the most dramatic scene of the main character realizing that he needs to re evaluate his priorities and then all of a sudden this garrageband ass beat comes in.

**jaztinax** (8.5): real question, where is she now?

**1998tweety** (8): ate

**intheaftermath** (8): I enjoyed this as a song, but much like All I Want, it felt a bit too generic-pop for a good Disney Channel song. Who is this about?

**missdarbusisaqueen** (8): God I love this song. Her story breaks my heart, I hope she’s doing alright these days.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): A bit funky (in a good way)

**anothertown** (7.5): lesser bop

**fadedblue09** (7.5): uplifting bop but why do I hear Cassie - Me&U in this

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): honestly…. Not bad

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): the keke song from this movie would be a 11 contender (stream it’s my turn now!) but this is cute… and used WAY too much in the movie

**yearofthesoup** (7.1): I have 0 recollection of this song but I can totally see how Jordan Pruitt laid the groundwork for Olivia Rodrigo

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): her voice is so pretty, the song itself is kinda mid tho

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): oooh i like this one too

#Ain't got rhythm

**plastichaxan** (7): I do not remember this at all wow

**vayyiqra** (7): I like when it goes beep boop

**CrimsonROSET** (6): don’t tell me what to do

**datosabona** (6): it was fun for a minute and then it just kept going

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): Does anyone remember when she auditioned for The Voice and only Xtina pressed the button? I was so embarrassed for her

**Zypker125** (5.2): Low-key an earworm, but still too low-key for me

**akanewasright** (5): This is perfectly nice but I’ve played this song three times within 30 minutes trying to remember what it sounds like, and I’ve failed

**bluetriangles04** (5): spaceship beep boops had their hand in every piece of music back then it was INESCAPABLE!

**bogo** (5): no, i don't think i will

**followingfreeways** (5): i feel like ive never heard this and now listening to it i dont like it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): wait wtf i used to love this song as a kid how did i never realize it was from jump in

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): “Jordan Pruitt” I don’t know who this is. It’s the most un-stage name I’ve ever heard. That’s the name of a girl who lives in an Ohio suburb and gets sucked into a Multi-Level Marketing scheme for leggings

**runaway3212** (4): this goes on wayy too long

**apatel27** (3): This is ad music

**AHSWeeknd** (2): So out of an album that had a Keke Palmer song y’all chose some random white girl song?? This setup 💀

**welcome2thejam** (2): Briefly interesting at the bridge, but zzzz otherwise

**flava** (1): this sounds like baby’s first song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Holy FUCK! That guitar hook is so good. This was always one of the catchiest songs from HM and I especially fell in love with it even more over the tiktok trend of it last year. I can not believe that this is going out in the bottom half of the rate? This is one of the most robbed songs in this rate in my opinion.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): 11 contender alert! i know that pop radio was allergic to every song in the rate but it's still baffling this didn't smash anyways (although it does have a billboard hot 100 top 10 to its name, sweetest pie can't relate)

---

#THIS IS THE ONE!

**followingfreeways** (11): the best hannah montana song ever made

**musical\_pyn** (11): this is just the perfect match between disney cheese and genuinely good melody/lyrics

**nightstar14** (11): this song seriously changed my life

**poppinmmolly** (11): i truly and wholeheartedly believe if you gave this to a pop girly in 2009 it would have SMASHED.

**ricki** (11): giving this my 11 to represent my actual 11, Rock Star

**akanewasright** (10): okay so true story: I got into Hannah Montana because [this Mickey Mouse edit](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dWLnLELOqlc) was on Disney’s website, and gay little me was obsessed. I got my mom and sister to watch the movie on Netflix one day (like pre-Orange is the New Black Netflix streaming), and then we started watching the series. This was also my first Disney channel show so I kinda have this song to credit for me getting into this at all. This is for baby Akane

**emayzee** (10): jake ryan tanked jesse outsold

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): [We rated this in The Popheads Jukebox years ago and it got a 9.4!](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/c5ku9e/the_popheads_jukebox_week_123_taylor_hannah_and/es2eqqd/) Hopefully it can repeat that feat here, because it deserves it. I said this then and I’ll say it again now: “Songs like this are so powerful they can only be handed to young women because anyone else would be vaporized by the sheer power of this much sincerity and unabashed love.”

**jasannn** (10): country-pop perfection

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Miley would never reject a man for collecting beanie babies btw 💋

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): It's no surprise pop punk started declining in popularity after 2009, those men knew they couldn't compete with this masterpiece and top 10 hit (!!)

**Roxieloxie** (10): My favorite Hannah song, like no question. I hear this and suddenly im back in my old parents bedroom jumping around trying not to get tangled in my headphones. While my sister is on the bed mimicking me going 'he's got something special' If i dont end up 11ing this just know it was one of the hardest decisions of this rate cycle. Like the love triangle in this season wasnt even good enough to warrant this song and yet. ugh!!!!! music!!!!

**slimboyfriend** (10): I stopped watching Hannah Montana after this song came out because I KNEW there was no way she could top this song and also I was going into high school and didn’t want to get bullied

**bluetriangles04** (9): the one point off is for something missing in the chorus but don't get me wrong THIS IS A MAJOR SLAY! it just could have had a more fulfilling chorus...

**IdiotBox01** (9): it pains me to give a tiktok song a high score

**jaztinax** (9): i have a very poorly edited music video of this out somewhere with kevin jonas being the subject for the song. luckily my channel was taken down due to copyright.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Wait this song is actually great? The things I learn revisiting my childhood

**1998tweety** (8.5): its giving Shania

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): Hannah Montana - He Could Be The One (Lyrics) "Smooth talking So rocking" [Tiktok Song]

**datosabona** (8): the way i was devastated when she picked Jake over Jesse

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): good for her

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.5): this one would be higher but I sung this solo in a talent show  as a kid… I cannot sing for shit and the thought of me soloing this in front of all my classmates is stomach churning

**missdarbusisaqueen** (7.5): It’s giving Shania

**CrimsonROSET** (7): lets go girls

#This is a 1

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.8): this is like fine but I don't get why people love it so much

**bogo** (6.5): miley's really channeling the spirit of shania twain here

**Alumineous** (6): Who approved this album art

**anothertown** (6): ice cream freeze was right there

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This song could be the six.

**frogaranaman** (6): this one sounds more like a Taylor Swift writing credit than "You'll Always Find Your Back Home"

**seanderlust** (6): me in high school when a man paid any amount of attention to me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i get this song stuck in my head sometimes and its never as good as i remember it being

**grandmafriend** (5.8): the verses hit so hard but the chorus is a disappointment

**intheaftermath** (5): I've seen too many memes of the "He" in this song being Jesus and now I can't hear it as anything but Christian

**nt96** (5): not me

**jsonphile** (4): it starts off with a pretty solid guitar riff, but it just gets kinda annoying after that

**runaway3212** (4): more like he could be the four

**thedoctordances1940** (4): this song is not the one

**welcome2thejam** (4): Always such an interesting yet frustrating thing to have so many good parts but then stumble hard at the chorus

**yearofthesoup** (4): Seems like an appropriate anthem for Southern girls falling hard for crusty boys on the football team of their high schools who will end up being divorced fathers of 3 before turning 25

**Zypker125** (4): This is NOT the song for the lesbians on r/popheads lmaoooooo

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Yeah I get it you're horny

**Stryxen** (3.5): forgettable

**apatel27** (3): Only the country rock aspect stops this from being pure genericness

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): im dying at [this video](https://youtu.be/X9pl-jkFhXo?list=TLPQMTEwOTIwMjLk-Jb9J9KGuw&t=192)

**vayyiqra** (3): Was going to ask why Miley sometimes tries to sound vaguely yeehaw, then I remembered who her father is and that she is literally from Tennessee

r/Popheads members who would bring a book to a karaoke bar: probably more than you'd expect

---

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Listen, they really knew what they were doing with the opening of this trilogy + spin off movie + disney+ series being called "Start of Something New." The scene of Troy and Gabriella singing this was very cute, but the actual song? It's alright. It's not incredible but it's good.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): another hilariously on the nose song. i vibe with the more jazzier production but it's not a standout otherwise

---

#Start of something great

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): My balladphobia for this one has thankfully left me over time.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): my cousin performed this at karaoke with his fiancee and it was so fucking adorable but maybe it was because i was tipsy

**emayzee** (10): zac came into the recording booth that day ready to give the performance of a lifetime only for them to use his voice for the the 15 second intro and drew seeley for the rest of the song

**jaztinax** (10): zac’s baby voice is so cuteeee. i’ll never understand why they let him sing bits and pieces bc it was really weird to let him sing something but dub him for the majority of it

**plastichaxan** (10): the international implications that this had

**RandomHypnotica** (10): two complete strangers really met and did *that*

**ricki** (10): do you think zac and vanessa knew they were actually building an empire when they recorded this scene?

**runaway3212** (10): they really did not have to give this much

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Let me just say, Gabriella brought a whole book to the party. Like sis, it’s loud and dark, there’s no way you’re reading that mess. It’s honestly probably a way to get guys to not hit on her, and if that’s the case then she might as well wear a chastity belt cause that book’s doing the same thing.

**grandmafriend** (8.9): it WAS in fact the start of something new

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): that was a classique

**akanewasright** (8): not my favorite but still a song I’d sing along to

**anothertown** (8): Zac efron vocal jumpscare

**apatel27** (8): It's cute

**bluetriangles04** (8): she read books, he played basketball... can i make it anymore obvious?

**frogaranaman** (8): LMFAOO THE WAY THAT IS FULLY NOT ZAC EFRON, HOW WERE WE ALL SO FOOLED

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Lady Gaga tried to recreate this magic with “Shallow” and she failed!

**jsonphile** (8): a solid start to the franchise. Quickly establishes our two main characters, and how neither of them are really into singing, but as the song goes on they discover they do have a passion for it they never realized, and have great chemistry with each other

**nightstar14** (8): the perfect way to start the franchise and set up troy and gabrielas chemistry

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): Ctfu that Zac Efron was so bad at singing that they had to hire someone else to do it for him

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): basic but sweet

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): cute beginning

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Aww they’re in love

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes fine

#Start of something POO!

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): how was Zac Efron the only cast me ever to get away with getting a voice double

**jasannn** (7): This sounds like a Meghan Trainor x Charlie Puth duet.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): the worst of the hsm songs here but still a #SLAY

**intheaftermath** (6): on further listening, this sounds a LOT like What Else Can I Do

**Roxieloxie** (6): its just not as amaze when stacked against the competition

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): tbh now that im listening to all the songs by themselves for this rate im realizing that most of the music in hsm1 actually kinda sucked lol

**TiltControls** (6): It's a cute start

**welcome2thejam** (6): I assume this is an actual song in the HSM universe, but I find it much funnier to believe that it was a karaoke machine that only played original songs

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5): picks up at the end but does not hit the same as it did when I was a kid

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): start of something mid

**yearofthesoup** (5): It seems criminal to put Vanessa Hudgens on this track because Drew's vocals are genuinely good imo

**missdarbusisaqueen** (4.5): Troy and Gabriela are so boring. Justice for sharpay!

**CarlieScion** (4): this kinda blows

**vayyiqra** (4): Why did this begin like a Sarah McLachlan knockoff. Cursed. Anyway, it's okay but dull.

**bogo** (3): y'all it's 10:00 pm you gotta give me something interesting or i WILL start to fall asleep

**flava** (3): they made karaoke look straight and i can’t forgive them for that

**Stryxen** (2): girl... Find the note

**thedoctordances1940** (2): Start of hopefully looking for a career not in music

**Zypker125** (2): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bzFbTFIttA (Get it?)

T R U E J A C K S O N V P: that's me

---

**TragicKingdom1** (10): this song is simply euphoric to me. it basically has three separate choruses and they're all so different but work so well together?? songwriting expertise

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I an very conflicted with this song. On one hand, the verses and post-chorus are very meh to bad. However, that chorus? Magic happens there. I never thought spelling out 13 letters would actually work in a song but they pulled it off. So sad to hear that she later died in an accident on the Metra Train. Hopefully she doesn't get disrespected in an viral tweets in the future :/

---

#More like True Jackson VIP

**static\_int\_husp** (11): nothing but respect for my queen Keke Palmer

**1998tweety** (10): this chorus is literally a Tinashe song, Im ascending

**2dina3dworld** (10): I used to want to be her SO BAD

**agentofscranton** (10): that chorus is pure euphoria - also justice for keke palmer's love you hate you from flop nickelodeon movie rags!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): BECAUSE SHE DID WHAT SHE HAD TO DO

**Alumineous** (10): Ugh, I fucking loved this show. Keke Palmer is just iconic and amazing.

**anothertown** (10): SOO true

**bluetriangles04** (10): T R U E J A C K S O N V P!

**Carnie** (10): is it crack that she put in this song?

**nt96** (10): this show is so underrated and Keke ATE THIS UP. A heavy 11 contender

**RandomHypnotica** (10): for such a strange show this theme song was fucking amazing

**Roxieloxie** (10): [3] True Jackson was actually so iconic to me. I had like 3 years where i wanted to be a fashion designer cause of her.

**plastichaxan** (9.5): now this is an intro that slayed as a full song zoey 101 take notes

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): girlboss anthem

**CrimsonROSET** (9): honestly loving this show as much as i did made me realize maybe i wasn’t straight

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I remember when this show was premiering my siblings put it on tv so we could make fun of it but then we all ended up loving it, the vibes were just so good and this theme song was a huge part of it. It just makes me feel so, well, fresh and cool! I do have to dock a point though because it is very obvious that the chorus is just a copy and paste job, which kills the momentum.

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): It’s no Love You, Hate You but it will have to suffice

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): game changer

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): had no idea this was called change it up

**Stryxen** (9): excuse me maam

**vayyiqra** (9): This rules

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): DOLCE AND VERSACE GOT NOTHING ON HER 😤

**frogaranaman** (8): SLAYYYYYYYYY

**runaway3212** (8): where is fashion is my kryptonite

**seanderlust** (8): songs that kamala harris lip syncs in the mirror when her approval rating improves by a percentage point

**welcome2thejam** (8): Ooh, this one ended up being fun

**missdarbusisaqueen** (7.5): Omg those SYNTHS

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): STAR QUALITY

#Change the station

**akanewasright** (7): Excuse me ma’am, not to be disrespectful or rude but could you please take post down. That is my sister who was killed by a metra train. And it this post is very disrespectful. Idk who you are or if you even know her but I need you to take this down please.

**yearofthesoup** (6.9): keke exudes charisma!!! but this song is bland.

**bogo** (6.5): i vaguely remember this show? song definitely rings a bell, plus it's also neat

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): never seen true jackson vp either but this is cute

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): CustommADE?? CUSTOmmade??

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): keke palmer is a queen so let me give her some pity points

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): why does the bass riff kinda sound like the home depot song

**Zypker125** (5): I have NEVER heard of this show/song before, and NGL, I kinda wish we replaced this with another song (Take On the World, L.A. Boyz, Better in Stereo, and Leave It All To Shine snubbed).

**jasannn** (4.5): chorus is sparkles but the rest of the song sounds likes a mess

**outsideeyess** (4): i love keke but this is like seven different songs in one. stream Twerk N Flirt instead

**apatel27** (3): Can they chill with the vocal processing

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Featuring WALL-E???

**fadedblue09** (3): This is a mess. Starts off as an Ava Max song then morphs into being a Ciara throwaway

**flava** (2.5): so this is my Keke was referenced on My Jeans

Amount of comments surprised at Selena’s vocals here: 5

---

**ImADudeDuh** (9): It's crazy to imagine that Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato both had only one collaboration together, and it's a theme song to a movie that is probably one of the least memorable 00s DCOMs (Disney Channel Original Movie) that stars some of the main Disney Channel stars of the time. However, it's a very cute song! I like the chemistry they have together and the music video was also very fun. We were so happy that day.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): "we write the same song in a different key" the jokes write themselves folks. i think disney and nick do this kind of pop/rock cut super well on average but this does not do much to stand out from the pack. i do find it impressive that they managed to make demi and selena sound so similar on this

---

#Anything but ordinary (complimentary)

**nightstar14** (10): i wanna go back to this era so badly

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIjcUNQpgbs

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): This is the best song in Selena's entire discography AND the best song in Demi's entire discography

**ricki** (10): https://i.imgur.com/dOmT3lc.png

**celladonn** (9.5): this is so fun and suits their voices so well

**Alumineous** (9): How's Selena? ... Ask Taylor.

**flava** (9): outsold Kelly

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): I wish we got more Demi and Selena duets they sound really good together

**jsonphile** (9): is this song just Disneyfied Avril Lavigne? Yes. Does this song kinda slap? Also yes.

**Roxieloxie** (9): i had a people magazine issue dedicated to their freindship that i remember spending an entire night reading

**Zypker125** (8.3): This is off topic but I remember reading a fanfic on FanFiction.net with a Demi/Selena pairing that got around the “no real people fanfiction” rule on the website by classifying the fanfiction under this movie and then changing Demi’s and Selena’s last names so that it would be “legal”. I read all of it, 10/10 would read again. https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8367060/1/Dismiss-Your-Fears if anyone is interested

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.1): a simpler time

**1998tweety** (8): iconic collab

**CrimsonROSET** (8): she’s just like me fr

**fadedblue09** (8): Not as messy as I would've expected

**slimboyfriend** (8): I can barely hear Selena over Demi’s powerhouse vocals and I think that’s a good thing

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Selena does a pretty good job of keeping up with Demi here. What happened?

**yearofthesoup** (7.3): Like, kind of fun?

#One.... and just more of the same

**bluetriangles04** (7): LOL!

**Carnie** (7): a demi and selena collb shouldve been a bop but hmmmm

**LesApfels** (7): https://youtu.be/wTPw0YeQs5A

**runaway3212** (7): two queens coming together to midimize their jointslay

**shhhneak** (7): Can I be vulnerable for a second? I miss the Selena/Demi friendship so much.

**vayyiqra** (7): I've been complaining about Selena and Demi's pop-rock eras both being bad but then ironically I kind of like this song

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): would be coming for the most talked about #28 debut in history if these two dropped today

**jasannn** (6.5): little me was living when he found out his two favorite pop girlies were collabing

**outsideeyess** (6.5): let loose and L.O.L.

**intheaftermath** (6): vacation bible school vibes... the father, the son, the princess in witness protection

**poppinmmolly** (6): I liked this back in the day but it doesn't hit the same

**Stryxen** (6): it would be funny to give this a one. But its alright :/

**thegolding** (6): it's crazy to think they were besties lmao

**bogo** (5.5): yeah i'm getting a little tired of the pop-punk songs

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): They’re both so quirky!!

**plastichaxan** (5): hmm

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): so crazy cant take them anywhere

**AHSWeeknd** (4): Hoping they don’t collab again

**akanewasright** (4): I can’t see Demi Lovato and Selena Gomez in the same room together without thinking of the time a friend of mine forcibly exposing my and another friend to the Demi/Selena/Miley/Mandy saga [through this video](https://youtu.be/TrdSwZuzMrY) at like 2 AM

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Putting Demi and Selena on a track together and choosing to frame them as vocal equals… this era of Disney was wild!

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): don’t care for the song but this movie was so camp

**apatel27** (2): She's so crazy!!! Can't take her anywhere 🤪

**IdiotBox01** (2): this sounds like a lame parody of pop punk

Dance moves I still remember from this: 7


---

**ImADudeDuh** (9): If there is ANY song in this whole rate where the choreography had such a grip on me, it is this one. That being said, this song is a bop too! Its a nice wrap-up to the first movie and gives the 2 leads and 2 villains a song to settle their differences. Fun fact: many people don't know that this song was originally written to be a song meant to bring together the democrats and republicans in this country, and in this essa-

**TragicKingdom1** (3): probably the cheesiest song in the rate and way too repetitive to like ironically

---

#Comrades

**agentofscranton** (10): people died

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Sadly this may have invented Glee.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): if this rate was a book and i was like ‘what is most fitting to win this rate’ this would be it

**jaztinax** (10): yooo the way this song modulates so effortly between male verse - female verse - chorus

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): literally gives me instant serotonin rush and takes me back to happier days <3

**MrMushrooms** (10): If you didn't spend hours trying to learn the choreo, I'm sorry but you're a liar

**plastichaxan** (10): forgetting the choreo to this made me sad

**runaway3212** (10): this choreo the entire world was gagged

**thegolding** (10): the best closure of a musical since We Go Together in Grease

**throwaway-7650** (10): elementary school co-ed gym glass anthem

**TiltControls** (10): There's something so cheery about listening to this. A little too fake-cheery, bit cheery nonetheless

**Zypker125** (10): DESERVED all the overplay and I won’t tolerate any slander. Giving me Frozen Let It Go vibes

**jsonphile** (9): an absolute bop that remains one of the best closing songs to a movie ever and will stay stuck in your head for years. Misses a 10 because let’s be real the verses are kinda forgettable, but that chorus? Immaculate

**welcome2thejam** (9): Scored high because this is the platonic ideal of the Disney Channel song, for better and worse

**1998tweety** (8.5): iconic

**emayzee** (8.3): when the cast was on good morning america my mom let me go into school late so i could watch them perform this on tv

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): this song is where I remember just how corny hsm is, it sounds like the arthur theme (although that bops)

**yearofthesoup** (8.1): put a finger down if you probably still know the choreo to the chorus to this song. its so corny but like. in a good way.

**bluetriangles04** (8): I still haven't had creme brulee to this day and maybe I should change that... sharpay you lucky dog

**CarlieScion** (8): clap clap

**frogaranaman** (8): cheesy but if this didn't teach us a valuable lesson about the power of friendship

**ignitethephoenix** (8): corny as hell but I’m nostalgic [infinite]

**nightstar14** (8): typical musical song but its soo good

**nt96** (8): Popheads you will be this united

**akanewasright** (7.5): I had to do this song in middle school choir so it’s been ruined for me a little… but not that much

**apatel27** (7.5): This is a bollywood number but without the good singing or the choreo

**jasannn** (7.5): Chosen Family by Rina wishes it could be this

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Glee wishes they had this sort of an iconic moment.

**intheaftermath** (7): yeah Sharpay still carries this one

#Centrist anthem :eyeroll:

**anothertown** (6.5): dry ass song

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.5): they tore up with this corny ass shit !

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): were you really a disney kid if you didnt try to learn the choreo to this song?

**flava** (6): i mean it is iconic, but iconic doesn’t mean good and those handclaps torture me

**Roxieloxie** (6): shout out to CHAI who had the indie kids at the mitski show so confused when they started singing this

**seanderlust** (5): took a point off because I was listening to this and got distracted with something else and then came back and was like "...oh, this is still going, huh"

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): A cheesy ensemble ending song is terrible, but like… inevitable?

**bogo** (3): ~~i'm gonna go ahead and guess most people enjoy this movie for its plot because almost all of its songs are NOT giving~~ never mind the songs after this all gave significantly

**fadedblue09** (3): There were no chemistry in their harmonies sorry

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): My mother was abusive, but I made her listen to this song, so maybe we’re even.

**missdarbusisaqueen** (2): The theme song of March 2020

**vayyiqra** (2): Why does this feel so low energy

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): stop flexing your undeserved happy ending

**Carnie** (0): since when did the US ever help out another country? this is a capitalist anthem. its giving gal gadot singing imagine. and we are not supporting

**PretentiousPegasus** (0): Hate to tank the HSM franchise average but this song has been traumatising me for the past 16 years with little sign of stopping. Was forced to sing this at assemblies every week in primary school for like 2 years straight in 2006-2008 and now a school I work at has this as their bell in 2022. It's Inescapable and it's inexcusable.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Is this a theme song to a children's show? Yes. Could I imagine hearing this in a club full of adults high on different drugs? Also yes. Selena Gomez was not involved in this show at all, and yet she put everything she can in this song. The second verse where she goes "break it dowwn, break it dowwn"? Ugh, that is so good. RuPaul stanning this makes sense and is one of the smarter decisions he made in the past decade.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is the slayest song selena gomez has ever released tbh

**fadedblue09** (10): Probably the best electropop song on this list

**jackisboredtoday** (10): hold up why is this better than almost anything Selena put out after scrapping Bad Liar/Fetish

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): I will not delete my account this time

**plastichaxan** (10): SLAY

**throwaway-7650** (10): selena singing the theme song was unironically great promo

**vayyiqra** (10): I genuinely love a lot of Selena's music and feel Popheads is way too hard on it. This is goofy, but also idc it bangs.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): Selena invented Hyperpop ☺️💅🫶

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): YUP YUP SMASH ALERT

**Stryxen** (9): and when are we rating nadia oh

**thegolding** (9): Selena ended David Guetta, DJ Snake, Tiesto and so on

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.7): This would fit right in on Stars Dance

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): This is such a banger that I can see why someone who’s not aware of the children’s show would want to see full grown men in wigs and panties lip sync to this on drag race

**agentofscranton** (8): i still cannot believe this was actually a drag race lipsync song like lmao??

**akanewasright** (8): Selena kinda ate here

**CrimsonROSET** (8): if you think about it shake it up was basically euphoria for teenagers

**datosabona** (8): personally i think we should bring overproduced autotuned messes back

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Why does she begin this by saying “this is the remix” when this is the only version of the song?

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): camp autotune

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): this is so much more repetitive as a full song

**Zypker125** (7.5): I don’t know why they chose Selena to sing this instead of the two leads but I’m going to laugh at the salt in the comments anyways.

**emayzee** (7.4): i remember this being better

**bluetriangles04** (7): selena staying EMPLOYED!

**bogo** (7): florence + the machine outsold, sorry. at least you outdid taylor

**nightstar14** (7): thank you selena

**runaway3212** (7): selena being here for some reason they really did not have faith in the stars themselves

#Shut it down (condemned)

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I’m sorry, I REFUSE to believe it’s “When the kick hits the floor.” Why would they repeat “floor” like that? It’s “When the kick hits the four” and I will NOT accept otherwise

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): tik tok of that girl walking

**seanderlust** (6.3): aggressively 2010s but like. not in a good way

**PretentiousPegasus** (6): This is the first time i'm hearing this song in full i guess its cute?

**jsonphile** (5): I like Selena Gomez more than most artists on this list but this isn’t her best work

**missdarbusisaqueen** (5): I never understood why Selena sang the theme for this lol. She’s a queen but they had both Zendaya and Bella singing so its confusing lmao

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this sounds like a cascada song

**TiltControls** (5): It sounds fun, but I'm just not a fan of Selena's voice here

**welcome2thejam** (3): Whatever the opposite of a club banger is

**Roxieloxie** (2): this was bad even then

**shhhneak** (2): I’m surprised Selena hasn’t scrubbed this performance from YouTube as well.

**frogaranaman** (8): SELENA GOMEZ SANG THIS???? I THOUGHT BELLA THORNE DID

**poppinmmolly** (7): didn't know Selena Gomez recorded this

**intheaftermath** (7): how did i not register that Selena Gomez sang this??? I named my club penguin character after her!!!

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): this was selena?

**apatel27** (5): Why is Selena singing this

BTR stans after seeing this placement: Uh Oh Ohh Ohhhhhh

---


**ImADudeDuh** (10): The perfect opening to a bunch of silly antics, this is kinda the only good Big Time Rush song in this rate! Something about the maximalist pop rock production and the hooks really got me, well, hooked. Also, I'm sorry but it is absolutely sending me that Big Time Rush declares that their fame feels so massive that they feel like **they will never die**. Damn, just go "oh oh ohh, ohhhhh" and cash the check.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): the opening "uh-uh-oh" for best moment in the rate tbh?? something about this one just hits every time

---

#We've finally hit the big time

**2dina3dworld** (10): this song is so overplayed tbh… it’s good but if I have to hear it one more time, I’m gonna go back and irrationally hate tank it

**agentofscranton** (10): james ate this up actually

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): We love…men???

**bluetriangles04** (10): this is your INTRO??? ARE YOU SHITTING ME??? ICONIC.

**Carnie** (10): that autotuned uh ah oh in the beginning is 😩😩😩😩

**fadedblue09** (10): my favorite Nickelodeon series theme. Almost my 11 too.

**Roxieloxie** (10): thinking about how they said got an LLC called BTR but the btr stands for bough the rights

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): MORE LIKE BIG TIME RATE WINNER!!!

**throwaway-7650** (10): the jobros are dead... 1D is dead... but we're still standing

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Sometimes theme songs suffer when what’s intended as a short snippet gets expanded into a full song… this one does not.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): this is so slay wait

**ricki** (9): that chorus actually caused and earthquake

**welcome2thejam** (9): You get one, BTR. Wait did he just sing "we can't die?" Is Big Time Rush immortal???

**plastichaxan** (8.8): that oh oh ooooh-oooh lives in my mind rent free

**anothertown** (8.5): pure uncut rock!!!!

**bogo** (8.5): it's been a very long time but i can still recognize that OH OH OH-OH OH from a mile away

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): good asf theme song

**bigbigbee** (8): I liked the Vamps and I like this

**Rameare** (8): I forgot how good this song is

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I can’t take that “OH OH OWOH OOOHHH” seriously anymore

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): this feels like it should be like 5 bpm faster

**1998tweety** (7.5): iconic

**akanewasright** (7.5): I’ve literally only heard the part of this song that was in the vine, the rest was so weird to hear 😭

**Alumineous** (7): Not me singing the Hannah Montana theme song lyrics to the melody.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): WO O O O OAH

**intheaftermath** (7): eh-eh-eh-eh-eouh

**nt96** (7): cant think of more perfect beginning when this gets robbed

#Uh-oh

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): Its iconic as a theme song but definitely bottom tier of BTR discography

**runaway3212** (7): this sucks but my goodness the nostalgia

**Zypker125** (6.2): I was thinking that calling them “the Nickelodeon ripoff of One’s Direction” would be derogatory, but on second thought, that’s literally what they are, so

**AHSWeeknd** (6): I wonder if One Direction ever thought about making a self titled song

**apatel27** (6): Is that the Hannah Montana transistion sound

**vayyiqra** (6): Why is there so much discourse about these guys, they're okay

**nightstar14** (4): catchy bc it was the theme song but as a whole song it lacks

**jsonphile** (3): look it’s good for a meme but god is this annoying

**shhhneak** (2): This is the point in the rate where my knowledge falls off completely. See <3

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): I want those “oh oh ohs” to go to hell with The Saturdays’ “na na nas” in “What About Us”

**flava** (1): I never knew production could sound this… wrong

Their outfits in this scene: HORRIBLE

---

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): i feel like the chorus was originally written for a very different song and they added on like five club boom cliches in the production phase to make it appeal to the kids. and against all odds, it worked!

**ImADudeDuh** (4): Idk, this is meant to be the big song that they perform at the end of the movie and by the time they get to Madison Square Garden but this song is just, worse than Determinate in every possible way? I can't imagine listening to the Lemonade Mouth soundtrack and determining (lol, that was actually unintentional) that your favorite song is Breakthrough.

---

#Here comes the SMASHA

**Alumineous** (10): This is the blueprint for how groups should balance their vocalists because no one outshined each other. Kiyoko

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I might need to watch this movie???

**bluetriangles04** (10): this is WAY TOO GOOD omfg. should have been a smash hit.

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): I always forget that Hayley Kiyoko is former Disney star. I’d rather listen to this song 13 times than listen to Panorama again

**runaway3212** (10): all these songs literally pop perfection like twice wish they could do it like this

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): they are so good that I can believe that they can perform MSG

**Zypker125** (9.8): It says something that despite this song easily being my least favorite of the Lemonade Mouth songs, I still gave it a higher rating than 90% of the songs in the rate.

**Carnie** (9.5): digital bop

**1998tweety** (9): ended TWICE

**fadedblue09** (9): Feeling really nostalgic rn

**frogaranaman** (9): GODDDD they slayed. it's insane

**Stryxen** (9): twice sweeties i'm so sorry but... they ended u

**Roxieloxie** (8.7): slay

**akanewasright** (8.5): this isn’t the best song they had, but it‘s still so iconic

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): not the best lemonade mouth song but still top tier, their power. Adam also eats yet again.

**jsonphile** (8.5): should I watch this movie? The music is surprisingly good. Even the corny rap verse is kinda fun

**TiltControls** (8.5): These rap sections are so corny but so perfect with what the song's trying to do

**nightstar14** (8): so so good

**vayyiqra** (8): CLOCKS BY COLDPLAY ?! Oh it's not but it still bangs.

**grandmafriend** (7.2): wait hayley kiyoko is a disney girl too?!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this would blow up on tiktok today

#Oh no here comes a break-in

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): the raps in these songs are kinda giving kpop rap because of how shoehorned in they are

**yearofthesoup** (6.4): honestly i kind of feel like if this had a better beat it might be a good song but the current one just kind of grates

**AHSWeeknd** (6): they phoned it in with this

**bogo** (6): ugh it's 12:11 a.m. and i'm running out of shit to say, fuck i've got so many more songs to listen to

**cremeebrulee** (6): can this man stop RAPPING PLEASE…

**intheaftermath** (6): it's fine, but lacks the punch the other Lemonade Mouth inclusions have

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): you just KNOW that in canon there are fans that consider this a sell out song

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Well 75% of it is good

**welcome2thejam** (5): If Determinate is Disneyfied indie pop rock, this is Lemonade Mouth's sellout era

**apatel27** (4): Their sellout era

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): how many robbery jokes are there gonna be

Do I have to be afraid to put my dreams in action?: No!

---

**ImADudeDuh** (8): The song is a nice moment for Tori plot-wise, and the song isn't bad itself! Its another theme song so it has to be catchy and it does it's job.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): this one is complicated to me because on one hand i think the chorus is possibly top 10 in the rate but it stands out as being so much less memorable overall than every other Victorious song here. still well above average for a theme song though

---

#Shine bright like a diamond

**Zypker125** (11): I think this might be my favorite song of all time. It’s the perfect storm of everything, it came out at the perfect time in my adolescence, the lyrics are PERFECTION and had a huge inspiration on me growing up, the upbeat melody and instrumental always magically uplift my mood, etc. Add on to this the fact that Victorious was my childhood and I had a big crush on Victoria Justice, and everything comes together for a song that really has a place in my heart that I doubt any other song will be able to claim. Even when I wasn’t actively watching Disney/Nick, this song was always in the back of my mind, especially when I watched those wedding proposal videos on Youtube (ex. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIo79flCfME) that further added to the magic & nostalgia of the song. There are very few things I’ve wanted to do more in life than give Make It Shine my 11, and now I finally get to do it. Thank you, u/ImADudeDuh, for making a dream of mine that I’d never thought I’d get to see come true.

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Ugh invented shining fuck the Sun.

**bogo** (10): YES, PUMP THE NOSTALGIA DIRECTLY INTO MY VEINS

**diamondsandglass** (10): Victorious songs are universally classic, fight me

**emayzee** (10): i won't take any victoria justice slander

**nightstar14** (10): tori deserved her flowers for this one

**plastichaxan** (10): Okay this works better as a full song than other intros here except like True Jackson

**Roxieloxie** (10): I had this song on my ipod so like +8 nostalgia

**runaway3212** (10): she had no right to slay this hard

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.9): every time i hear this song now i just think of that reaction meme of the girl with red hair that's supposed to look like cat valentine getting her ass beat

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Best song from this series idc

**CrimsonROSET** (9): ok but leave it all to shine???? Where is that

**frogaranaman** (9): these lyrics are so true

**jaztinax** (9): she ate

**TiltControls** (9): The version that's this + Leave It All To Me would be an easy 10

**nt96** (8.5): I think ALL MAKE IT SHINE

**2dina3dworld** (8): the instrumentals should not be that far forward in the mix

**flava** (8): my little brother loves this song rn, so I can’t be mean to this because I love him

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): the other verse is not HALF as good as the one in the intro im sorry!

**Carnie** (7.5): not bad but its disappointing as a theme song compared to the rest in the rate

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): you don’t HAVETOBEAFRAIDTOPUTYOURDREAMINACTION

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): not my fave theme song but it's good

**musical\_pyn** (7): justice for victoria justice

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): actually this is a lot nicer than i remember it being lmao

**vayyiqra** (7): This rate is kind of backloaded, we had to wade through a lot of crap to get to the okay stuff

#You can't make me

**AHSWeeknd** (6): She was so annoying

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): They hype this up on the show but it’s kinda middling.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): she sounds like she’s singing on a Samsung Smart refrigerator

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): Still ctfu that they had Liz Gillies and Ariana Grande on the cast and they made Victoria Justice the Nicole Scherzinger of the Victorious cast

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Oh my god that autotune is SO bad how did I never notice it

**apatel27** (5): Safe standard theme song

**IdiotBox01** (5): he was a boy, she was a girl

**seanderlust** (5): the producer credit i fucking HATE IT HERE!!!!

**akanewasright** (3): [cursed blunt rotation](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/851835432886599761/1016839260592156692/IMG_8146.png)

**celladonn** (3): this really shouldn't be as boring as it is

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): this sounds not very good?

**Alumineous** (2): Okay, I had a long ass comment on why I hate this song so here’s the short version. She basically did nothing. She just got lucky and somehow she’s seen as aspirational. It’s weird to sing a song about working hard to fulfill your dreams when the catalyst for her success was taking her sister’s position in a performance. It’s just exacerbated even more when Tori is considered “the best” when she’s worked the least.

**cremeebrulee** (0): girl shut up

---

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): this is kinda just bet on it lite

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Hmm, maybe there was better songs from High School Musical 3 to put in this. The big opener for the theatrical release and it's... probably not meant to be listened like this?

---

#NOW!

**cremeebrulee** (11): that was fucking cinema!!!!!

**agentofscranton** (10): there are parts of this where zac sounds exactly like andy samberg

**bogo** (10): let's play ball let's play ball yo you're my universe

**CarlieScion** (10): GOD i saw this in theatres and the HD shots of sweaty boys playing basket ball confirmed my bisexualtiy so hard

**frogaranaman** (10): THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL CANNOT BE DESCRIBED

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): TROYYYYYYY 👹 but fr I remember seeing this in theatres for the first time as a kid and being absolutely awestruck…my nostalgia blinders are on heavy rn

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the TROYYYYY is literally so camp omfg

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): senior year has bangers i said what i said

**runaway3212** (10): every other cheerleading squad wishes they were them

**seanderlust** (10): "history will know who we are" my guy it's high school basketball

**throwaway-7650** (10): this is kind of the jopping of HSM if you really think about it

**welcome2thejam** (10): Bro how is High School Musical hitting 3 for 3 in sports-themed bangers

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**anothertown** (9): troy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! right now i can hardly breate

**datosabona** (9): anyone who gives this a score below a 7 probably says some corny shit like “i hope they do the thing and score the points” during a major sporting event

**emayzee** (9): peak zac efron

**intheaftermath** (9): I knew there was a reason HSM3 was my favorite as a kid. I've always thought that HSM was a wildly overrated franchise and I think my opinion of it would be much higher had the music been as strong as it gets in HSM3.

**jaztinax** (9): zac efron truly peaked in hsm, like he genuinely will never do better than this. not even the greatest showman

**jsonphile** (9): the first HSM movie to be released in theaters, and this was the first thing we would see. And what a killer scene to start with. An absolute bop that shows how much bigger, grander, and more cinematic this movie would be

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): this scene was my sexual awakening but the TRROOOYYYYYYYYYYYYY takes it down a mark.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): the fact that the dramatic slomo is in the song as the bridge is so… much

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): I’m clearly a sucker for songs that are exactly like this

**followingfreeways** (8.5): its just about the way gabriella stands up screaming in the middle of this game

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is a slay but a little bit all over the place.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): definitely a getcha head in the game 2.0 but with budget

**jasannn** (8): troyyyyyyyyy

**musical\_pyn** (8): TROYYYYYYYY

**nightstar14** (8): HSM never missed its crazy

**Roxieloxie** (8): SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEEN

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): The Boys Are Back outsold

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.2): time is waiting, we've only got 16 minutes to save the world

#Never.

**2dina3dworld** (7): this seven is solely for the chorus

**CrimsonROSET** (7): gabriella-ex-machina

**Stryxen** (7): the drama wow… too bad i couldn’t care less about this man

**akanewasright** (6.5): omg I love high school musical 3! The boys are back, night to remember, just wanna be with you, right here right now, scream… now or never? Uh… the part where she yells “Troy” is cool ig

**AHSWeeknd** (6): ooooh dramaaaaa

**bluetriangles04** (6): didn't know super junior was in this rate

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Hmmm…

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): literally every other song in hsm3 is better than this

**Zypker125** (5.3): The hosts put the wrong Now Or Never song in the rate, here’s a link to the correct one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ8MFfg3DHA

**slimboyfriend** (5): the chorus is the only notable thing about this getcha head in the game ripoff

**yearofthesoup** (4.9): HSM3 was so weak and this song just feels like a desperate attempt to recycle stuff from the first 2 movies :(

**fadedblue09** (4.5): mess

**apatel27** (4): This sounds like a SNL parody of HSM

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): they should’ve sang all throughout the match it would’ve been an easy stomp

**vayyiqra** (4): Okay that's enough sports

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): You can hear them trying to recreate the magic of the previous films but it just isn’t there.

**missdarbusisaqueen** (1): Bland af, I don’t even remember this song

People who call it magic: Some

---

**TragicKingdom1** (10): to those not in tune with the Discord rate community, I was fully convinced this was the theme song of the show until like a month before this rate started because of how it basically serves as a plot summary. i think this song has some of the most well aged production in the rate and Raven goes OFF with the vocals. the bridge is pretty cheesy but i actually think it works and elevates the song? it adds heart!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is like The Best of Both Worlds, where if it exists in universe, this is kinda a big arrow trying to expose the secret that they try to keep hidden throughout the show's run. However, the actual song does feel more like a "real song" compared to most of the other songs in the rate. Feels a little generic but it's still good.

---

#It's magical

**agentofscranton** (10): picture the scene, 2009 - little 12 year old me starting high school with his dumb new little phone. it's the first class of the day - science. the teacher is doing teacher stuff talking about mitochondria or something, then out of nowhere - music. it's coming from the pile of bags in the back corner of the room. it's my phone. it's the only song in my phone. it's some call it magic by raven-symone. everyone stares at the bags, they don't know the song they're too dumb and tasteless. someone says it sounds shit. the teacher doesn't hear it because he's like 40. i have to sit there for three minutes waiting for the song finish as everyone stares. it finishes. nobody ever finds out that it was me with the gay little song on his gay little phone.

**CarlieScion** (10): bratz-core

**Carnie** (10): My girl Chelsea, my boy Eddie ✊✊

**celladonn** (10): bop, i love raven's vocals here

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I can see this one faltering because of its, um, *campy* lyrics, but I have such fondness for this era of commercial tie-in [“image songs”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_song) that were just fun little bops about your favorite characters. I feel like these have become less common in recent years (although fandom artists have never stopped churning them out) and I miss the unapologetic sincerity of them… like not every song HAS to be broadly applicable and radio friendly, it’s okay to have songs about your girl Chelsea and your boy Eddie helping you navigate your psychic visions!

**imasalesman** (10): this song is a literal masterpiece

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): If you did shrooms you could relate to this song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I do not at ALL remember this, but it's genuinely an amazingly solid 00's R&B track

**Roxieloxie** (10): Okay so to this day im not sure how i got it but i had this thing called a VideoNow as a kid that was basically a mp3 player but for videos  and i had this tape/cartridge thing that had this song on it and so i watched the music video for it alot. The song is also just really good in general.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): it’s giving a bit of disco

**shhhneak** (10): Everything you could want in a song: belting, harmonies, monologuing, laughing at your own jokes.

**missdarbusisaqueen** (9.5): Cute bop, I just love this song

**fadedblue09** (9): wholesome and soulful

**runaway3212** (9): yass come through spoken word artistry

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): how have i never heard this before this is so fucking good

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): why do i have no recollection of this song

**jasannn** (8.5): we love lore

**anothertown** (8): not this compilation having "She's No You (Neptunes Remix)"

**followingfreeways** (8): i dont remember this song at all for some reason and it's a banger?

**intheaftermath** (8): I love Raven's vocals on this one but it's lacking something... could it be nostalgia, considering I was not born when this show premiered? probably.

**Stryxen** (8): wait smash this is so pretty and i love the synths running all over the place

**throwaway-7650** (8): did wizards of waverly place ever reference this show?

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This is so cute

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): it’s cute!

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is corny as hell but it’s a bit of a serve… so it all works out

**jaztinax** (7.5): raven really served in this though

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Others call it witchcraft

**CrimsonROSET** (7): maybe its magic, maybe its maybeline

**flava** (7): so did we ever get an explanation as to why Raven is able to see into the future or was it just some random thing that happened to her

#Burn the witch

**slimboyfriend** (7): I was wondering if this was a cover, but then the lyrics started getting super specific

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): i call it good aim

**vayyiqra** (7): Way better than the band Magic! (low bar)

**1998tweety** (6.5): not the spoken part...

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I think I would really like this if its lyrics were less specific to the show. I really liked music like this when I was a kid. It’s a very nostalgic sound for me. (Miracles Happen from The Princess Diaries soundtrack-esque)

**ricki** (6.5): well idk raven, what else do you call being able to see the future? intuition? luck?

**yearofthesoup** (6.5): I didn't remember this song. I still don't remember this song. It isn't bad. I like Raven's vocal showcasing. The dramatic syths are SO of a specific era.

**babadork** (6.2): If the song didn’t explain the plot of “That’s So Raven,” it would be much better.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Good chorus, bad verses, unnecessary spoken word, all coming out to a 6.

**bluetriangles04** (6): the spoken part in the bridge ADSKSDSALKDS

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): so true queen you kinda do have a special gift !

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it's cute but

**nightstar14** (6): she tried it but it was boring

**TiltControls** (6): I mean I'm not up to date fully on That's So Raven lore but I'd count psychic prophetic visions as magic

**bogo** (5.5): this is basically just the musical version of a sparknotes plot summary

**frogaranaman** (5): this absolutely is a song of its time

**Zypker125** (4.1): Did the Disney execs listen to this and then come up with the idea for Wizards of Waverly Place

**apatel27** (4): Is this a show finale song or something? It feels like it but apparently it's not

**welcome2thejam** (4): Weirdly tries to have it both ways by only vaguely referring to the plot so it can fit on Disney radio or something, but also just straight up says the two friends' names, not to mention the spoken word bridge. Raven's fun and holding her own, but the song's holding her back

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): A very cute instrumental that reminds me that we neEED BRIDGIT MENDLER TO MAKE A RETURN TO MUSIC. PLEASE BRIDGIT, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE THAT SMART ANYMORE. PLEASE JUST MAKE A SONG, ANY SONG, I DO NOT CARE. JUST COME BACK TO MUSIC AND MAKE ANOTHER WATER-THEMED POP SONG LIKE ATLANTIS OR DIVING PLEASE PLEASE I AM BEGGING ON MY KNEES FOR YOU.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): cute sentiment but i don't think this was the right direction for bridgit's music (which they thankfully recognized immediately)

#Hanging loose

**1998tweety** (10): BOP

**2dina3dworld** (10): okay Good Luck Charlie was my favourite show as a kid, and I do think it’s because it was “grown up” than the other shows without having those terrible cringe romance subplots (watching Spencer get beaned was also satisfying)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Bridgit Mendler PhD snapped here

**fadedblue09** (10): I always had a soft spot for Good Luck Charlie because it was a breath of fresh air compared to the other Disney sitcoms at the time (no teen idols, prodigies, wizards, etc.). And the wholesomeness of this bop captures that fact well.

**frogaranaman** (10): Charlie is a queer icon. I will debate this

**musical\_pyn** (10): more like bridgit mothe-ler

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the absolutely wild trajectory of every person in this show

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): good luck charlie was kinda the best show ever

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): anti-abortion lawmakers be like

**thegolding** (10): I love Bridgit's voice so much

**throwaway-7650** (10): bridgit/good luck charlie you will ALWAYS be famous

**Zypker125** (10): This is legitimately another one of my favorite songs of all time, and probably the song with my favorite lyrics of all time. The lyrics are uplifting, meaningful, and effective, and who cares if they’re a little cheesy? This is THE song that I go to to make me happy. Would have gotten my 11 in any other rate had my favorite song of all time not been here.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): ‘good luck charlie’ is still a common term in my family and i fully blame this song

**intheaftermath** (9): stream Hurricane

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): Atlantis is not even in Bridgit’s top 10 most streamed songs on Spotify so I see why she quit music

**plastichaxan** (9): rating the spanish version which is superior <3

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.8): Bridget we miss you

**akanewasright** (8): this show was good and I will ignore all evidence to the contrary

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): Bridget eats ofc but the song itself is just too on the nose. Like yeah Charlie is a baby!

**slimboyfriend** (8): Ok Bridgit… I see u…

**flava** (7.5): this song is in the rate to inspire people to keep on going

**jsonphile** (7.5): between this and lemonade mouth maybe Bridgit Mendler should’ve had a bigger pop music career

**IdiotBox01** (7): almost as good as Girl Meets World but not quite

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): SMASH SHOW!!! also did anyone else used to hardcore sob at the good luck charlie christmas special where teddy and her mother get into that argument on the street or was just that my mommy issues

**poppinmmolly** (7): Good Luck Charlie was the last Disney Channel show I watched before I decided I was too old for Disney Channel (I was 17 in 2010 lol)

**Stryxen** (7): this being directed at a literal baby is soooooooo

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): she don’t miss

**welcome2thejam** (7): This is how I realize that I thought the cast of Good Luck Charlie was instead in Dog with a Blog

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): Cute! Like a baby!

#Bad Luck 

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I am hanging in there… for new music Bridgit! Where the fuck is it?!?!

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): Bridgit has genuinely achieved everything that I could imagine a person wanting to accomplish… disney stardom in both acting and singing (sometimes better songs than this), going to MIT and Harvard Law…. genuinely what is left for her to do

**bluetriangles04** (6): the lyrics to this one kinda hit me like the ones in the fairly oddparents intro where they just run from sentence to sentence; BURNT TOAST, RUNNING LATE, DAD JOKES

**bogo** (6): me when it's 12:45 a.m. and i'm trying to get through the rest of the rate

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Maybe one day she’ll come back to music

**runaway3212** (5): this is so faux inspirational im gagged

**yearofthesoup** (4.3): extremely vanilla

**apatel27** (4): You must've had a horrid childhood to make a pump up song for a baby

**nightstar14** (3): idk i liked it as the theme but not as an actual song

**missdarbusisaqueen** (1): Sorry, I heard that guitar too many times

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): You know its a problem with a song when you listen to it twice in order to specifically get your opinions together for the song and make a nice writeup for people who are watching the reveal of the rate, and then you realize "oh, it's over and I didn't pay attention to it... again" because yeah that just happened with this.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this bops mildly but it feels weirdly low energy for a party song? i feel like it would be much better at 1.25x speed

---

#The party's hereeeee

**agentofscranton** (11): the little acapella section before the final chorus? that's REAL music

**nt96** (11): oh your faves are fucked now

**Carnie** (10): I remember watching the movie when it premiered and the opening scene was this bop, whew I was so hyped

**cremeebrulee** (10): i hold this song in such high regard because my parents walked in on my sister and i watching this music video on tv and they cancelled disney channel the next day

**throwaway-7650** (10): oh maybe I do know this song from my childhood

**emayzee** (9.4): i will forever be chasing the euphoria of seeing this on disney channel in the summer of 2006

**bogo** (9): this could actually be mistaken for a song by a "legitimate" 2000s r&b girl group and i mean that as very high praise

**fadedblue09** (9): Some rough verses but otherwise very enjoyable

**intheaftermath** (9): this is a Chanel "Chuchie" Simmons stan account actually

**jaztinax** (9): you want a workout? learn the choreography. you’re welcome. the acapella part always gives me chills too omg

**runaway3212** (9): me doing this rate

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): bop

**1998tweety** (8.5): omg this sounds so mature

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): When it’s a three day weekend and you can spend the next 48 straight hours in bed.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): its party time

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Fun fact: After hearing this, Lorde removed the line “I’m kinda over being told to put my hands up in the air” from her song “Team”

**Roxieloxie** (8): I was about to say that this wasn’t hitting but then the acapella part came on and the memories of me feverishly tapping my DS screen to get the beat of this song perfect on the level came flooding back to me

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Yes I think I will party

**welcome2thejam** (8): Definitely the makings of something super strong here, but not quite there

**yearofthesoup** (7.8): This went unexpectedly hard. The rap is a little cringe but the harmonies are so angelic.

**nightstar14** (7): we need new girl groups like this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): when they said “acapella now bring it in” and then they went into acapella…their brains are so massive

**vayyiqra** (7): Does this sample a more famous R&B song from the 90s or does it just sound like one

#Crashing the party

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.8): this song is so loud LMAO, my AirPod Pros did not consider this song when they were being produced

**apatel27** (6): It was good then it just kept going and going and going

**flava** (6): it’s serving Y2UK

**bluetriangles04** (5.5): kinda reminds me of a JT cut?

**AHSWeeknd** (4): This proves “Cheetah Girls” was a concept better on paper

**Stryxen** (4): i see the vision but meh

**Zypker125** (3): Yeah, this music is way too much “early 2000s” for me

Taylor Swift?: WRONG GRAMMAR

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): The DRAMATICS that I sang whenever I would sing along with this song. This is totally a cheesy love ballad but goddammit this song just hooks me in and makes me feel so happy.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): i could legitimately see goodbye lullaby era avril doing this which is wild because avril was still ostensibly pop/punk when this was released. "YEAH you" and "OH sure" catch me off guard every time

---

#*Insert a good movie here*

**bigbigbee** (11): when I started this rate, I listened to this song and I was like “aww! I remember this from the show! A cute 8” and then I streamed it 10 more times in a row and reconsidered my score

**missdarbusisaqueen** (11): All the feels

**slimboyfriend** (11): I will NEVER be ashamed of getting caught listening to this as a full grown man

**akanewasright** (10): The way I didn’t like this at all as a kid… what was I doing

**anothertown** (10): i say this about a different song everyday but this is the best hook ever written methinks

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Just a little bit of Avril running through her veins with this one…

**CarlieScion** (10): youuuuuuu'd be here by now

**Carnie** (10): the best hannah montana song. i think this is the song taylor swift spent her entire career trying to write

**emayzee** (10): megan thee stallion herself said this is the best hannah montana song i don't make the rules

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Low-key this song has some of the best-written lyrics in the rate, they do a great job of distilling down the essence of a romantic film and using it as a cudgel to hammer in Hannah’s discontent with the way her own life doesn’t follow the same picture perfect narrative conventions. Cuttingly relatable.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): hannah was in her bag for this one

**jasannn** (10): Hannah Montana honestly outsold Taylor Swift and Kacey Musgraves here

**jaztinax** (10): the cutest love song tbh

**Rameare** (10): I'm obsessed

**RandomHypnotica** (10): if I was a movie it would be a terrible movie

**thegolding** (10): I swear this starts playing on my head radomly throughout the day

**throwaway-7650** (10): catch it @ taylor swift

**flava** (9): Miley Cyrus does sing like a sick child but she still gave it her all

**musical\_pyn** (9): I'm so glad at least ONE popstar knows how to use the subjunctive mood

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): Kim K to Ray J

**poppinmmolly** (9): no notes

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): outsold taylor tbh

**1998tweety** (8.5): ended fadlor

**xxipil0ts** (8.5): me on my solo day out thinking i'd be in a meet cute with someone on my local bookstore when we both touched the same copy of hamlet

**nightstar14** (8): invented love

**yearofthesoup** (8): feel like this song felt kind of dated even when it was new, but like, i low key feel like it could be a legitimately good song if Miley sang it in her adult register &/or if it was covered by a ~serious musician~ oddly the one that comes to mind if John Mayer (probably the twinkly guitars and mid-aughts vibes sound like his early work

**Roxieloxie** (7.9): This isnt me docking it because its not the corbin version but i think because thats the one that was on my cd its the one im the most nostalgic for. The chorus of this one really contains my love for this one

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): corny but I’m nostalgic

**runaway3212** (7.5): the production is so bad also taylor outslayed x

**Alumineous** (7): Classic Disney delivering false hopes to young children.

**bluetriangles04** (7): if we were a movie we would be one of those made for TV ones where they place the lovable main characters of a show in a different country and come up with a load of bullshit to throw them into to be resolved within an hour and a half

**CrimsonROSET** (7): roll credits!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This is my favorite chorus to sing out of all these Hannah songs

#*Insert a bad movie here*

**TiltControls** (6.5): well you ended up getting one I guess

**bogo** (6): i actually think this song is kinda bland but it gets an extra point for being grammatically correct UNLIKE A SIMILARLY TITLED SONG BY AN ARTIST WHOSE NAME SHALL NOT BE MENTIONED

**fadedblue09** (6): Cute but forgettable

**plastichaxan** (6): would be a netflix original that becomes a meme

**thedoctordances1940** (6): you are

**nt96** (5): If I was in a movie, I'd make damn sure my music wouldn't be so…..bleached

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): if this song was a movie i’d change the channel

**Zypker125** (4.3): If I was a movie I’d be the first Star Wars prequel because that movie was a disappointment to my parents

**AHSWeeknd** (3): Back then Miley had no idea what it meant to sing on key

**vayyiqra** (3): Does this interpolate "Fireflies" (joke)

**welcome2thejam** (3): Two thumbs down

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): then you’d be a bad one

**apatel27** (1): It's a decountrified Taylor song (yes I know the irony of this)

**frogaranaman** (1): I fucking hated this song SO MUCH!!!!!! it literally ruined my life for like three weeks

Extended Version: Never happening


---

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I can not give a song less than a minute long more than an 8. That 50 seconds is alright but it's also not as good as I remember.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): it's cute and i love how weirdly influential it is on billie eilish and i assume others but it's barely a song so i cannot rate it higher in good conscience

---

#Oh, oh, oh, it's magic!

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**2dina3dworld** (10): Harper was a first crush of mine

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): They ended JK Rowling tbh as they should.

**Carnie** (10): this couldve been an 11

**frogaranaman** (10): Harper Finkle did more for fashion than [insert the random white person y'all are focusing on this week]

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): SMASH SMASH SMASH SMASH BEST SHOW EVER BTW

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i fully believe that selena's pop career only took off because of this theme song

**runaway3212** (10): selena I love you

**Stryxen** (10): this is bad. This is pure nostalgia and the only song i care enough to vent nostalgia for

**throwaway-7650** (10): selena having 2 hit theme songs... queen!

**anothertown** (9): i think this deserved an extended version

**thegolding** (9): she used to sing high!

**akanewasright** (8): iconic

**bluetriangles04** (8): YES PLEASE!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): where is she

**datosabona** (8): why isn’t there a full length version !

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): it’s so good but criminal it’s not a full length song

**ignitethephoenix** (8): ate

**nightstar14** (8): thank you again selena for another iconic theme song

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): We needed the full 3 minute version on streaming but we never got it. We need Everything Is Not What It Seems (Selena’s Version) right mfin now

**PretentiousPegasus** (8): I wish they'd kept this version instead of changing it to that one with the magic snow globe thing

**yearofthesoup** (8): a bop of a theme song

**cremeebrulee** (7.2): this runtime ended pinkpantheress

**AHSWeeknd** (7): The remix really did the damn thing

**missdarbusisaqueen** (7): Bad Guy influence?

**slimboyfriend** (7): does this not use the same beat as the intro of Donatella by Lady Gaga

#We're all gonna pretend we didn't see this

**Zypker125** (6.4): No one’s gonna pay attention to my comment, so I’ll do a secret confession and confess that I was/am a hardcore Justin/Alex shipper and I read a shitton of Jalex fanfiction. Anyways moving right on

#It "seems" that this song is garbaj

**apatel27** (6): It's a cute jingle

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): they way this is one of the better Selena Gomez songs for me. I love “Bad Liar” but I’m really not a Selena Gomez person

**fadedblue09** (6): cute interlude

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i think this is one of those theme songs where a full version wasnt really needed…like it accomplished everything it needed to do with the 60 second version used in the intro and everything else added to the full version just feels unnecessary

**TiltControls** (6): I'm not the biggest fan of Selena's music from this era but this works as an opener

**vayyiqra** (6): I thought I was going to have to give out pity comments about Selena in this rate because a lot of her old music is really bad but this is alright - wait why is this 50 seconds long

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Whoever approved rating the short openings against all these full-length songs is a meanie… this is not fair to them

**agentofscranton** (5): stream only murders in the building on hulu

**bogo** (5): it is an okay show theme

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This is pretty middling but [an extended version leaked online a while back and it goes way harder.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlmAO-koYWA)

**welcome2thejam** (5): Gravity Falls S02 E11 outsold
