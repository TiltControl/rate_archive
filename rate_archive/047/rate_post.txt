The Mid 2000s Dancepop Comebacks Rate: Blackout vs. X vs. Confessions on a Dance Floor
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/8vjcbl/the_mid_2000s_dancepop_comebacks_rate_blackout_vs/

Late night. A dimly-lit club.

It’s Gay Night™. Hundreds of homosexuals, their queerness ranging from high enjoyment of same-sex intercourse to exceptional musical preferences, have flocked to the club. You’re standing by the bar, drink in hand. Maybe it’s the alcohol or, perhaps, your old and tired ass, but it seems like everything tonight is a bit lethargic and sluggish, as though the dancefloor were covered in invisible slime. The eardrum-shattering bass and the twinkling neon lights put you to sleep. You try counting your fingers. Yep, there’s still 10 of ‘em. It’s not your third appletini.

Someone in your proximity yawns loudly. “Oh no ^(flo should have won)”, you think. It must be your straight™ friends, who agreed to assist you tonight. You turn to the side.

“Karen-“

“It wasn’t me!”

“I… Nevermind. Please, be honest with me… is everything alright? Are you having fun?”, you ask, trying to fake a smile.

Karen smiles back, equally insincerely.

“Oh yeah, totally! Now excuse me, I need to go to the bathroom. Makayla, can you?...”

As they disappear in the slowly thinning out crowd, you still can make out a faint “I can’t believe I sacrificed Ed Sheeran karaoke night at Brenda’s for this snoozefest!”. The blood starts boiling in your veins.

“It’s all your fault.”

Your livid gaze wanders in the direction of the stage. He’s still there – a singer of supposed Tumblr fame, hip with all the youngins, whose name you have already forgotten. You observe him, as he sways awkwardly by the microphone. Beyond question, it must be the constant stream of monotone lyrics that come out of his mouth that put the dancefloor to sleep. “Yaaaaas”, screech the few underage gays, who pierced through the crowd, hoping to reach the lifelessly wobbling body. “I can’t believe this is gay culture now”, you sigh with a sense of malaise.

“I wish actual talented, critically-acclaimed performers, such as Madonna, Kylie Minogue or Britney Spears were here”.

Now, you will never be able to explain what happens next. Maybe it’s Friday the 13th and your mom says the same thing, cause this is some Freaky Friday shit. All you know is that you will never forget the sight of a falling floodlight and the sound of screaming teenagers.

##[Britney Spears – Blackout](https://s12emagst.akamaized.net/products/1927/1926539/images/res_81265a91f535b2712e32461ad4af0f50_full.jpg)

The lights turn to a very slutty shade of purple. You see the microphone transforms into a huge-ass strip-club pole. And who is it that slides down the pole?...

*It’s Britney, bitch.*

The Gays shriek in awe, some of them already turned straight. Britney works it so hard, your appletini turns into a [bitchtini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4E36Opq89w). She moans “*Gimme more*!” repeatedly over the iconic Danja-produced beat in an almost sexual manner, but you, an Educated Gay™, already know the sad truth behind these lyrics – Blackout is a reminder of a sad episode of Britney’s life, showing how fame can destroy and dehumanize. She then proceeds to address the media again in *Piece of Me*, her robotic vocals, as it were, mocking the criticism of her being an empty doll and not a competent artist. The following AutoTune-soaked songs, *Freakshow* and *Radar*, elevate the crowd into a state of transhumanist euphoria, until Britney finally shouts “Let me *break the ice*!”, reminding everyone that, in fact, it was her who invented anime. You can literally see the ice shattering in your glass – but wait – the glass seems to be breaking as well! Is it the speakers? Is it *her power*? No. It’s…

##[Kylie Minogue – X](https://images.genius.com/fa6978e16758c5b7d069c1ae076a7679.1000x1000x1.jpg)

A giant, gleaming white spaceship hovers over the stage. It positions itself gently in mid-air and, quite ungently, lands, squashing Brit and all that was left of her Glory. The Gays shriek in dismay, but then another joyous (and thirsty) squeaking emerges, as some of the more observant homosexuals notice that the DJ has been replaced by no other than Calvin Harris.

*How do you describe a feeling?*

The airlock unseals, revealing a petite, and yet undeniably majestic, smoke-soaked silhouette of the Queen of Australia. The Gays are ecstatic.

*I’ve… only ever dreamt of this…*

…you think, as soon as Kylie utters these exact words. “I am shook, I love mind control now”, you shout, as Kylie inquires her lover to tell her how he feels *in her arms*. In another attempt to understand the biological complexity of the hoo-mans, Kylie sings her glam rock anthem *2 Hearts*. You can’t help but shout “*Wow!*” along with her. Your unconscious bopping seems to actually not the result of telepathy – you’re legitimately thankful for her triumphant return to the music industry after surviving the deadly threat of cancer (yes, that’s exactly what you thought). After convincing everyone to stream her album on Spotify in the sultry *Speakerphone*, the crowd goes crazy, as the club is filled with what seems to be a Sophie track. “*Nu-di-ty*”, repeats the glitchy voice, as if it were to announce something. Kylie tears off her avant-garde spacesuit. Her body starts to transform and warp. You can’t believe your eyes – [Kylie was an alien all along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8oHKAUmMdM)! Or was she? Nah, it’s just…

##[Madonna – Confessions on a Dance Floor](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-E2Yc9LFL._SL1425_.jpg)

*Je suis désolé…*

*Lo siento…*

*Ik ben droevig…*

*Sono spiacente…*

*Perdóname…*

Words of regret and compassion fill the club. Is she sorry for murdering Kylie? Is she sorry for mentally scaring all the twinks on the dancefloor? You aren’t sure. What you know for certain is that these are the words of pure apology, almost god-like in their clarity, and that your pussy is now quaking in a very remorseful, ascetical manner.

*Gomenasai…*

*Mujhe maaf kardo…*

*Przepraszam…*

*Sli'kha…*

*Forgive me...*

“What are you apologizing for?...”, cries out the crowd. Madonna lifts her head up ever so slowly and, her lips curled in a devilish smile, says: “You’re right. [I still hate those fucking hydrangeas.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qlXMA0v-WA)” Suddenly, the club erupts with a bouncy disco beat of the Guinness World Record-awarded *Hung Up*, the song that certified Madonna’s legendary status. Obviously, the glitzy pussy-poppery doesn’t end at that – you can’t help but bop to the Donna Summer-inspired *Future Lovers* and *Forbidden Love*. “I love you!”, you shriek in an awed exclamation. “*New York* is not for little pussies who scream!”, replies the Queen, and, somehow, you love her even more. The show ends with *Get Together*, an ecstatic anthem, and you end up achieving transcendence.

The next morning, you decide to cut down on your drinks.

So, now that I caught your attention with this messy write-up, I'd like to thank /u/whatareblackhole and /u/sh-ether for proofreading and overwhelmingly positive feedback! Also I wanna thank /u/kappyko and /u/mudkip1 for the inspiration... I probably should've let you know first. ~/u/awryj

These three albums are one of our absolute favorites and I can't stress enough how important they are to us. We can't wait for you to listen to them all - for some of you it will be just another revisit, and for others - the first time ever, and that's what we're the most excited about. Their sound is timeless and incredibly influential; all of these albums have influenced the modern PC music scene to an extent (especially X)... Also we feel at least 20% more gay listening to them. So what's not to love? Even if you're into pop punk or indie, give them a chance! ^(Your bussy will thank you later.)

Anyway, without further ado, we invite you to the...

##THE MID-2010S RULES COMEBACK

hey kappy i hope u dont mind but im gonna rip these off from ur post ok [thanks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNrZCaZKH-0)

* Listen to each song and **assign each a score between 1 and 10**. Decimals are fine, but **please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two decimal spots.** What is wrong with you? Don't give a 6.75, that's just ridiculous.
 
* There is a **minimal average of 4.000** and a **maximal average of 10.000**. No excessive stanning.

* **Yes, you have to listen to every song**.  I will not accept your ballot if you have a score missing. That's because it will crash the program. It's exhausting when I'm putting in all the scores in last minute and somebody decided not to rate "Why Should I Be Sad" because they were so bored with the album they forgot to put something in for the last track!

* Your scores should **NOT** be considered confidential. How have you not figured this out by now? It's a rate! They will be revealed!
 
* You may give **ONE** song a **0** and **ONE** song an **11**. By one, we mean that this is **one song total**, not one song per album. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; **excessive sabotage ruins rate results**. It's *annoying*!
 
* You **can** change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM either me or /u/sh-ether again afterwards.
 
* The program makes things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on our part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to **use the pre-prepared link, found right here. PLEASE USE THAT**. You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores.
 
* If you don't follow the format, we'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions. And I will present your username in large, bold text making fun of you every single time a song is revealed. We'll also probably/definitely ask you to fix it on your own if the issue seems like it's going to take a long time to correct.

* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!

* If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!
 
* If, after submitting your scores, you change your mind about a certain song, I WILL change it up until I stop accepting scores.

**This is the ONE AND ONLY correct format:**
 
>I Love New York: 1 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? 
 
**These are INCORRECT, in fact, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:**
 
>I Love New York:1: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? 
 
>I Love New York: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?  1

>I Love New York: 1/10 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?
 
>I Love New York: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little b1tch? 
 
>I Love New York: 1-What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? 
 
>I Love New York: 1 (What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?)

**You can also comment on albums by adding a colon after the album title!**

>Album: X: Help I am American and I do not know Kadie Meringue. Who this

**NOT LIKE THIS**

>Album: X Help I am American and I do not know Kadie Meringue. Who this

im too lazy to come up with more examples but u get the gist

* **Bonus tracks CAN NOT GET 11s OR 0s.** If you want to do the bonus rate, **rate ALL of the songs**.

thanks kap

ok thats it

do our rate

the bonus rate too
