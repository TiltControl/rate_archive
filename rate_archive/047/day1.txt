this is the goofiest song on confessions, and contains the infamous lines 'other cities make me feel like a dork' and 'just go to texas, isn't that where they golf?' 

my favorite comment was 'Is it ironic? Is it post-ironic? Was Madonna being a dumb bitch? We will never know' from a discarded ballot

**new yorkers:** 
---
**IaEStI** (10): serving attitude...I love the chorus and the instrumental
 
**MrSwearword** (10): sanction me or Crimea river, I like this song a lot even with all the numerous lyrical fuckups committed in this song. THE 29TH GREATEST MADONNA SONG EVER
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): When she called us ‚Äúlittle pussies‚Äù... ugh her mind
 
**jamesfog** (9.5): https://media.giphy.com/media/wN0IH6JXKpNdu/giphy.gif
 
**tapdancingpig** (9.4): So do I! The lyrics are fun and the beat slams.
 
**technoprayers** (9): who doesn't love New York, especially after hearing this song
 
**whatareblackhole** (9): This one is fun! I love the attitude. It kind of sounds like it could be on Born This Way since, you know, Gaga literally created New York. ;)
 
**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): I mean I love new york too but does she really not like any other city?
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): I've love-bopped, I've hate-bopped, now I've cringe-bopped.
 
**lady\_sable** (8): some of the lyrics are. questionable. but it bops so eh
 
**twat\_brained** (7.6): Before Taylor Swift and Jay-Z and Alicia Keys we had this. At least those have better lyrics than some of what I hear in this.
 
**chipsi1** (7.5): LMFAOOOOOO
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (7): I kinda think the dumb vibe is good. It's the REAL darker shift bc of how it resets the mood so suddenly
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): what are these lyrics
 
**RomanOrgy69** (7): This song really pains me. The music and production are just so good, but the lyrics are just so awful‚Ä¶ Plus, I think it kind of disrupts the flow of the album.
 
**vayyiqra** (7): okay these lyrics are basic af but still the production is fire so it's listenable nevertheless taylor remains unbothered
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Here‚Äôs a fun fact about Madonna, in 1982 she was cast in a Broadway musical called *Rock and Roll! The First 5000 Years.* She dropped out after the first rehearsal, and everyone in the cast thought she was crazy for giving up the opportunity. She went on to become one of history‚Äôs biggest pop stars, and the show closed after nine performances. Also people from New York need to calm down about New York, I‚Äôm a theatre person so I have to hear it constantly and it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ no way the city is that great.
 
**stardustanddinos** (6.5): Sounds like something a New Yorker would sing. And I don‚Äôt say that in a good way. The marks are for the production, not the lyrics. :P

**pussies who scream:**
 
**PuggleMaster** (6): Get off my street x20
 
**QustoMar** (6): years b4 i truly started listening to music, i was listening to the confessions on a dance floor album on the computer in my grandma's living room and my little young wig was SNATCHED by this song, bc born and raised in new york. this song has really not held up since then tho, it's very awkward to listen to it and hear lines like, "I don't like cities / But I like New York / Other places, make me feel like a dork / Los Angeles is for people who sleep" the production + chorus is nice though
 
**skargardin** (5.5): Guess I‚Äôm getting off the street
 
**Omgcow** (5): I, too, love Tiffany Pollard
 
**static\_int\_husp** (5): Not great. Repetitive amd lyrically bad compared to the rest of the album. I also automatically mark down songs with cop sirens in the instrumentals. Shit's annoying.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Honestly? This may be the most maligned song on an otherwise fantastic album, but let's give it credit. It's funny! Hilarious, even. If you analyse the melody really carefully, it's actually a rock and roll song tucked into electronic production, which may have worked with better execution. But the real hilarity of this song is in the lyrics: it's like Madonna thought 'hmm, how can I make the gays scream and quote me on r/popheads?' and wrote a song about New York in thirty minutes. It's bad, sure, but would you honestly skip this legend of a tragedy? (Maybe I'm going too far, but you know what I mean.)
 
**letsallpoo** (3): it's been waiting for you
 
**rickikardashian** (3): Madonna googled ‚Äúfamous cities‚Äù and searched for words that rhymed with them, just so she could brag about new york, like any person that lived on new york ever does
 
**evilqueenlex** (2): rhyming New York with dork should be a crime tbh, the lyrics in general are too laughable to take seriously lol
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (1): i also love new york but i hate this song
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (0): The more I listen to this the more I hate it tbh. It's just kinda flat out obnoxious
 
**popiquin** (0): Some of the most bizarrely awful lyrics I've ever heard from any artist. Madonna may not feel like a dork in New York, but she certainly sounds like one on this track. brb going to texas to golf
 
**RoiduLames** (0): The lyricism... I have to laugh
 
**Sayaam** (0): I don‚Äôt know what possessed her to do this

Is this really the worst song on X? It's certainly the least X-esque one - if by X-esque we mean: experimental, cutting-edge, sexy, alien. *Cosmic* is very personal, considering the events that preceeded the release of the album. The mid 2000s were a moment of reflection for Kylie, who at the time was diagnosed with [breast cancer](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/13/article-2690489-1F9C702100000578-785_634x415.jpg). The metapoetic aspect of the song is a nice surprise which cannot be found in any other album in this rate and even though this song placed low, it's still very dear to my heart.
 
**astral queens:**
---
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): A beautiful way to end the album, a nice mid tempo ballad that manages to be slower and emotional without feeling out of place with the rest of the solidly dance pop album. I love that weird spoken bridge, her voice is so soothing. I always feel so calm and light when I listen to this, her voice and the message are beautiful. It‚Äôs a tender exploration of what it‚Äôs like to find love not just in the romantic sense, of finally opening yourself up and being free to express yourself as you‚Äôre truly meant to, and in the process finally being able to feel the universe.
 
**technoprayers** (10): Lovely closer, really fell in love with this
 
**whatareblackhole** (10): Awh, I love this! This is a nice neo-soul closer. Fuck the haters, I like this one.
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (9): I enjoy the emotionality here and simple the ballad really is
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (8.1): cute sentimental ballad
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Seeing the album end with this kind of ballad-stripped down, lowkey, and lacking in many of this album's signature production elements-is a little disappointing, but what this song has going for it is that it's not without its charms. From Kylie's cute lampshading to the soft, warm ending, it's this song's plain attractiveness that prevents me from giving it a low score.
 
**RoiduLames** (7): Really nice track, but it just felt kind of weak? Especially considering its following Nu-di-ty which has such a strong stage presence so to speak
 
**vayyiqra** (7): ok first of all m e t a secondly this is a weird ending to a dance-pop album but i don't hate it

**earthly flops:** 
 ---

**tapdancingpig** (6.8): Perfectly pleasant, but a little boring. There‚Äôs not really a big hook here, but I like the lyrics a lot.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (6.5): For a song called ‚ÄúCosmic‚Äù, I wasn‚Äôt really expecting a ballad
 
**teenage\_meme** (6.5): okay, there were two songs on this album i didn't really like. all the rest was bomb tho
 
**twat\_brained** (6.2): Pretty meh closer honestly
 
**IaEStI** (6): she's heeereee
 
**MrSwearword** (5): WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON...OK it's not that awful but get this 90s Kylie mood out of my bangers.
 
**Omgcow** (5): Chill, but in a boring way
 
**fifthchevron** (4): She's trying but just doesn't have a good voice, sorry.

**survivorjdmarina** (8): rap queen

**fifthchevron** (7): queen of...unsafe sex anthems?

**MeanToBeIconic** (7): this song is so nasty it's hard to take serious lol

**tapdancingpig** (6.5): That was... huh. I think she made a good choice in leaving this song off the album. It‚Äôs not bad, but it feels really unfinished and dated (of course it does, it‚Äôs an unreleased demo).

**RomanOrgy69** (6): I can see why this was scrapped

**saucymac** (6): what the fuck is this lol

**Sayaam** (6): More appropriate for a Step Up soundtrack than Blackout

**tevinterimperium** (6): A more polished version of this song would be an absolute banger

**vayyiqra** (6): apparently this song is about the withdrawal method which is hilarious but it's not that great itself sorry

**whatareblackhole** (5): I know I listened to this‚Ä¶.but I don‚Äôt remember it

**rotating3Dtext** (4.8): uhm, her voice?

**Banananaise** (4): this sounds like a discount gwen stefani reject

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (4): i literally understood nothing

**static\_int\_husp** (4): There's a reason this track was unreleased.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3.5): I was listening to K-pop the entire weekend I was finishing this rate and it took me like a good thirty seconds to realize I wasn‚Äôt still listening to it when I heard this track. Is it just me or can anyone else not understand what she‚Äôs saying here? This is just a demo, right? Her vocals sound especially childish here and it‚Äôs kind of weird. I don‚Äôt hate the song though, it‚Äôs certainly got a good beat, but I dunno. It kinda feels like it‚Äôs going for that sort of playground chant type thing that Gwen Stefani did on ‚ÄúHollaback Girl‚Äù or Christina would later do on ‚ÄúBobblehead‚Äù but it just never quite goes all the way there.

*Nu-di-ty* is a total oddball of a song. It's wonky, it's robotic, it's sexy but also... kind of hilarious? The Japanese influence, the sing-rapping, the gender-bending use of Autotune and the artificial sounding production of the song make it a (possibly?) direct influence of today's PC Music, similarly to other weird, cutting-edge electropop anthems of the mid-2000s pre-PC era like [*Pop the Glock*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RA-lXK0c0g) by Uffie or [*My Egyptian Lover*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPUaKcuU0Zc) by Nadia Oh. tl;dr if you are a sophie stan and gave it anything lower than an 8 you are cancelled

**everybody take it off!** 
---
**hikkaru** (10): this song is so weird and i love it... the fucking elephant trombone makes me lose my shit every time lskdjfklsdjfl
 
**MrSwearword** (10): Oh wow, the predecessor to If U Seek Amy and just as much of a banger.
 
**RoiduLames** (10): Absolutely loved the production in this song! Really fun and creative, almost feels like it belongs on Blackout!
 
**teenage\_meme** (10): this is one of the coolest songs i've ever heard!
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): invented PC Music
 
**evilqueenlex** (9.5): maybe I‚Äôm just a slut
 
**jamesfog** (9.5): Invented PC Music, sit down SOPHIA
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (9): Horns and horniness. Not just for Jason Derulo!
 
**tapdancingpig** (9): Wow. I definitely understand the PC music (specifically SOPHIE) comparisons here. Be right back, I‚Äôm putting this in all my playlists.
 
**vayyiqra** (9): wtf is this it's fucking bizarre but i like it tbh this is better than PC music
 
**whatareblackhole** (9): Time for her Blackout moment. I like this one. It‚Äôs slutty and fun. Take shots to this.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I really like how‚Ä¶ I dunno, robotic this track sounds? There‚Äôs something about the autotune and the way that she demands to see nudity it‚Äôs almost like she‚Äôs an alien or something that genuinely has no clue what nudity looks like and is ready to explore it. But like, in a sexy way, I‚Äôm into it.
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (8): This is the most electropop bop on the entire album and I love it for how quirky and weird and just plain fun it is.
 
**Omgcow** (8): This is weird and I love it
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8): I love SOPHIE and Charli XCX üòçüòç
 
**technoprayers** (8): it reminds me of a Blackout song a bit which is probably why I like it

**GlialUreterostenosis** (5.5): This can't not have been a rejected track from Blackout.
 
**IaEStI** (4): Australia can keep
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (4): ...sigh...I think people like this because it's the most direct flash forward to PC music on this album, and in the rate as a whole. I appreciate that fact, but, honestly? Give me Charli over this any day. The lyrics make this sound more gross than delightfully trashy and the production leaves something to be desired. It's not without redeeming features, but it's nothing more than a baby step towards the experimental pop of today.

honestly i find this song forgettable even though x is in my top 5 kylie albums, and i'm not surprised to see it leave on day one. awryj agrees

**weather forecast sunny:** 
---
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this was so wholesome I love you Queen Kylie ‚ù£Ô∏è
 
**rotating3Dtext** (9.8): so pleasant
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9): There‚Äôs a lot to appreciate about this song but I‚Äôd like to give a shoutout to the tight, clean production. It‚Äôs tasteful and subdued, while still managing to create this incredibly sense of expansiveness. This song makes me feel like I‚Äôm soaring through space in the universe, it makes me feel cleansed. It‚Äôs especially powerful considering Kylie‚Äôs battle with breast cancer in the years leading up to the album, supposedly she wrote the lyrics for this song while still in recovery. She whispers out that damn bridge with such awe and confidence, Kylie has so much life inside of her it‚Äôs inspiring.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Blind Melon outsold
 
**Humantrashcan** (8): This gives me vibes of like that Miranda Cosgrove song made for Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs
 
**IaEStI** (8): the whisper part kinda creeps me out lol
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (8): I like this! It's cheesy and dumb, but it' cuter for it
 
**technoprayers** (8): I was a bit bored by this one but the chorus is great, saved it from being a seven
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (7.5): I don't fully know what a glitter drop is but I do know that I love my optimistic icon
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Oh, nice, another track that I'm not sure what to think of again. It does sound quite lovely to my ears, but I can't help but feel like this is a slightly more boring retread of the sounds Madonna explored in Ray of Light and Music. Then again, this is probably an unjust comparison, so don't come for me.
 
**skargardin** (7): Damn cute
 
**survivorjdmarina** (7): I love Whisperlie
 
**tapdancingpig** (7): Cute, but not great.
 
**vayyiqra** (7): this sounds like the most generic early-2000s soccer mom driving in a minivan alternative radio hit but i'm not mad about it tbh
 
**whatareblackhole** (7): This is cute!

**thunderstorms:** 
---
**chipsi1** (6.5): Yes Less Rain
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): Store brand William Orbit
 
**twat\_brained** (5.8): "How I Roll" 4 years before it came out. I give credit to Kylie for her forward thinking. Sadly, "How I Roll" is a bottom 4 Femme Fatale track and this is a not very good tune compared to the rest of the album.
 
**hikkaru** (5): this just sounds kinda corny
 
**Joebiekong** (5): It overstays its welcome.
 
**RoiduLames** (5): Really simple and smooth chorus, but something about the verses really put me off
 
**fifthchevron** (4): Cute but inconsequential
 
**Sayaam** (4): Personal but not a solid song for me

**evilqueenlex** (10): yeS
 
**MrSwearword** (10): this is a straight up banger.
 
**hikkaru** (9): another song on this album that doesn't build up to much of anything but has really great production
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Oh, man, I can see how this album inspired P.C Music now! Kylie's accent here is campy in the right way and all sorts of amazing, and the song is a really fun example of sing-talking in general. The beat is excellent and it makes the track sound both posh and carefree.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Confused sexy robot Kylie is one of my favorite Kylies. If I‚Äôm not mistaken this is one of the most minimalist tracks in the rate, I like how jittery and stilted it is because it frames sexy in an unusual context.
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): Kesha‚Äôs inspiration? Kylie‚Äôs ‚Äúrapping‚Äù is a lot lighter, but still fun and synthy.
 
**technoprayers** (8): I thought I would be turned off but I like it a lot
 
**vayyiqra** (8): another fire BEAT this album made me at least 150% gayer and i'm not even gay to begin with, this is kylie's impact
 
**whatareblackhole** (8): Oh, this one‚Äôs good! I like the attitude and the beat. Wig!
 
**twat\_brained** (7.7): The semanticist in me is mildly perturbed at the decision to make the title three words when "heartbeat" is one word. What doesn't help is the empty space after the second chorus which briefly confused me into believing the song was finished. In fact the whole song seems sparse at certain points.

**IaEStI** (3): nothing about it interests me, and the pauses aren't helping
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (1): This song honestly just never CLICKED with me? I found it kind of repetitive and not in a fun way. It may also be that I was just mad after coming off the amazing run of 2 Hearts through Sensitized

I'm a Kylie stan but GOD IS HER VOICE NASAL HERE. It's a cute song but that fact alone makes it one of my least favorite Kylie songs ever. It might be my least favorite one, actually. ~~we don't speak of [beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Wk8S1k8PA)~~
 
**star-struck:**

---
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): lyrically one of the most interesting on the album, it actually took a while to grow on me
 
**rotating3Dtext** (9): a vibe
 
**IaEStI** (8): that chorus is so good, but the breakdown left a lot to be desired
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8): Wow this is a bop!
 
**vayyiqra** (8): can't help it i love electro bangers with intergalactic themes
 
**whatareblackhole** (8): I like this! This one‚Äôs fun. The latter half of this album is improving greatly.
 
**twat\_brained** (7.7): I'll be honest I wasn't really listening to the lyrics I just think the beat's cool
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I think people hate this because it's the third 'soft' sounding song on this album, which is understandable. It's something of a step down in originality, but I still think it's a decent lullaby to listen to. I wouldn't skip this song, even if I'm not a huge fan of it.
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (7): I love it when I listen to it, but I often struggle to remember it
 
**MrSwearword** (7): I'll be very nice and describe this as unusually lively.
 
**tapdancingpig** (7): A little bit more pop-rock than the rest of the track list, but it‚Äôs a fun little song.
 
**technoprayers** (7): a nice song but nothing too special

**star-crossed:**
---

**Itsafudgingstick** (5): It's kind of a basic pop song by Kylie tbh. Like I don't really see much special in this one
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (3): The most obvious filler on the album, I‚Äôd rank this as one of Kylie‚Äôs worst songs. (Ignoring her first few albums, which were too naive to be truly counted.) It‚Äôs not awful, but like, it‚Äôs kinda bad. It‚Äôs damn near tuneless, the chorus just kind of meanders all over the place and never quite finds its way to anything satisfactory and that droning noise that runs throughout the recording is super annoying and it‚Äôs literally the first thing we hear. Also surprisingly generic for the album.
 
**RoiduLames** (3): The instrumentals on the chorus are really loud compared to her and seem to drown her out a lot, which is fine if you‚Äôre dancing to it but Im not so it loses points here

**fifthchevron** (10): The summertime classic no one will ever know.

**RomanOrgy69** (10): WTF? Why wasn‚Äôt this put on the album, it‚Äôs better than 50% of the actual album!

**Joebiekong** (9.5): Who did that rap verse?; that cost the song 0.5 points.

**teenage\_meme** (9): I LOVE THIS ONE! it's the perfect summer song, it feels like sunshine and lemonade and sitting by the pool with cool sunglasses on :)

**tapdancingpig** (8.4): Honestly this seems like a 2001 self titled track. I think this is my favorite of the batch so far, partially because they found a way to make Early Morning good (sorry!).

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Why was this unreleased? This is one of the smoothest tracks Britney has in the rate. The lyrics are a little weird but I really love the ‚Äò90s hip-hop/r&b vibes, Britney pulls them off surprisingly well. The version without the rap verse is kinda better though.

**Sayaam** (8): A cute girl but wouldn‚Äôt have fit on Blackout

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): queen of self-awareness

**Banananaise** (7): this is surprisingly good? i think the use of a completely generic and anonymous rapper helps

**MeanToBeIconic** (7): The solo demo for ITZ is better

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Rap feature is not good. Rest is okay.

**rotating3Dtext** (6): that rapper...

**vayyiqra** (4): wtf this is awful it doesn't even sound like a britney song but some low-tier r&b crap that briefly peaks at #87 on the hot 100 and is promptly forgotten about

**whatareblackhole** (4): :eh:

**skargardin** (10): This track doesn‚Äôt nearly get talked about enough, LOVE IT
 
**RomanOrgy69** (9): I think this is the most underrated song on the album.
 
**tapdancingpig** (9): I started smiling when the bass came in and never quite stopped. Fun lyrics, great beat, and a good hook
 
**technoprayers** (9): a nice closer to an album full of bops and tea.
 
**whatareblackhole** (9): Another chill bop. I really, really like this one, and would give it a 10, but I would have loved for this album to have ended on a much punchier beat. Either way, it‚Äôs a sublime way to close.
 
**IaEStI** (8): she's the garden; guess I'm the snakelor
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (8): swanky groove, I'm with it
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8): Different than the rest of the album, but good.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): It‚Äôs a decent closer for the album but on the whole I would have liked something more.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): Life is a paradox
 
**teenage\_meme** (7.5): i love the production, but there are so many cliches in the lyrics i'm convinced katy perry ghostwrote
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (7): Well this was actually a pretty strong ending. The metaphors were a little tired but they did give some cool imagery so props for that
 
**MrSwearword** (7): a bummer way to close an album but not the worst song ever.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Ooh, we have a bit more cowboy Madonna again as the album closes, apparently. This is classically Madge in both lyrics and sassiness, even if it's not the best of songs, so by definition, it's not terrible despite how plain it is compared to the rest of the album.
 
**PuggleMaster** (7): I'm so glad this album is over
 
**vayyiqra** (7): marina diamandis meets depeche mode i'm into it

well not high at all (in the rate) huh

**highlight:** 
---
**QustoMar** (10): i like that this song is an introspection on her fame kind of like her album ray of light, "It's funny, I spent my whole life wanting to be talked about"
 
**whatareblackhole** (10): Emo-donna really chilled this album out here at the end, and I‚Äôm loving it, especially when considering the title of the album and the timing of the album‚Äôs release in her career. This feels like the first real Confession, and Madonna really sells this one.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I always loved this song for the subject matter. Ambition is both one of ny greatest strengths and my fatal flaws, and I can't deny that there's a part of me that wants to be hugely successful and famous as an author. I know the dreams end up going to my head, though, so this is a bit of a snap back to reality, courtesy of Madge.
 
**rotating3Dtext** (9): truly dance music
 
**twat\_brained** (8.7): I don't remember getting this far into the album, I usually tuned out after Jump. Is anybody else strongly reminded of "Die Another Day" at the bridge? I don't really get what the song's meaning is though.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): it slaps and it‚Äôs cute
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (8): Interesting production, although the lyrics are a little on the nose for me
 
**MrSwearword** (8): this is a case of blase but fitting in with the rest of the album so well I can't knock it that hard.
 
**vayyiqra** (8): kinda basic lyrics that said queen of self-reflection and synthwave
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7): [Am I the only one who can only think of this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmRmK3ncsv0&frags=pl%2Cwn)
 
**tapdancingpig** (7): This is probably my least favorite on the album, but it‚Äôs still really good and has some of the best lyrics.

a thought-provoking album closer, but it's still our first out song from blackout 
 
**depression? i don't know her**
---
**technoprayers** (11): This track is so underrated, the production, the lyrics, everything is just spectacular omg
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): after a run of filler we FINALLY get another good song on this album, and what a song it is! it's honestly a discography highlight for Brit imo; the production is interesting, but so are the lyrics and her delivery which is what most of this album lacks. the album would live up to the hype if more of it had this level of perfection to it
 
**evilqueenlex** (9.5): BRITNEY LET‚ÄôS GO
 
**twat\_brained** (9.2): I get what she's saying and I empathize with her; it's like a spiritual successor to "Lucky", she's got all this fame, glory and support, even though this was the height of the Britney hatejerk. My heart weeps for Godney here.
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (9): A cute, mature, clean ending to a dark and chaotic album. Closes well
 
**mudkip1uwu** (9): dae pharrell ruined sweetener !/1 ?!?
 
**QustoMar** (9): a whole entire diss track to Kevin Federline, plus the media a lil bit, i LIVE. it's a nice, soft, closer to Blackout after all the intensity of the previous songs
 
**fifthchevron** (8): It disturbs me when women say they were restricted/controlled upon leaving a relationship. Don't ever limit yourself for some guy. Particularly not the Kevin Federlines of the world. This is probably the most specific/personal lyric she's ever done too, with the most overt references to her actual life and fame. I think it's a good album closer, there needed to be a personal moment to reflect, but it's not a downer either.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): A touch of pathos for the album that I really appreciate, especially to close things out. I wish they‚Äôd trusted her a bit more, stuff like the ‚ÄúBritney let‚Äôs go‚Äù refrain detract from her performance. Cliche as it is I think a stripped back track (or even one that starts production heavy and slowly strips the elements away until it‚Äôs just Britney) would have made a fantastic end for the album. I know they weren‚Äôt really out to make alb ballads with this album but this was just begging for a more serious arrangement than it got. The finished product is good, but I just think it could have been better.
 
**IaEStI** (8): grew on me a lot
 
**kanyewestrep** (8): Pharrell is the fucking man!
 
**Leixander** (8): a good closer to the original version
 
**RoiduLames** (8): We love her Blackout-version of a ballad!
 
**teenage\_meme** (8): honestly one of britney's best album closers
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): What a weird, fascinating end to the album! This is a throwback to 80s radio, and while it goes against all of this era's themes, it ends up being a pretty good softer end to Blackout, and a fantastic diss against Britney's ex (I screamed when I read on Wikipedia that it was inspired by him).

**i'm a sad girl:**
---
 
**jamesfog** (7): Pharrell, producer of Sangria Whine and The Light Is Fading... it's a no from me dawg.
 
**Omgcow** (7): Still good but not GREAT like the rest of the album
 
**Sayaam** (7): Not the dud everyone makes it out to be
 
**survivorjdmarina** (7): ‚ÄúBRITNEY COME ON‚Äù is the only part I remember tbh
 
**vayyiqra** (7): this is kinda weird and that synth is wacky but nice very smooth R&B vibes i feel like i should listening to this from a highrise luxury apartment in miami at night
 
**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): britney let's go
 
**chipsi1** (6.5): don't tell anyone how i live but this song isn't all that
 
**lady\_sable** (6.5): this one's a little. weak.
 
**whatareblackhole** (6): This is a weird closer. There‚Äôs so much power in this album, especially in the beginning, and then it just kind of tapers off. This is the cringe version of ‚ÄúPiece of Me‚Äù ‚Äì I know what it‚Äôs trying to accomplish, but I can‚Äôt entirely get behind it.
 
**MrSwearword** (4): because this is a horrid way to close an album as pretty consistent as Blackout.
 
**tapdancingpig** (3): What a missed opportunity. I like a lot of Britney‚Äôs other work with The Neptunes, but this just falls short. First of all, after an album of pure bangers, this ends the album with a whimper (and not a sexy whimper that‚Äôs really a bang, like Perfect Lover). Second, although I usually love switching up sonic pallets a little during albums, I don‚Äôt want something WILDLY different at the very end. The track kind of goes nowhere. Urgh. I hate thinking about this song. I‚Äôm going to listen to Perfect Lover again to make this go away.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): retro but not in the same way the original was and i love it

**Joebiekong** (9): The fading effects and cymbals are just a little too loud. Plus the ‚Äúyoull wake up someday‚Äù part isn't that good.

**survivorjdmarina** (9): doesn‚Äôt slap like the original but it‚Äôs still great!

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Good, but can't beat the original with the ABBA sample throughout the song

**MeanToBeIconic** (7): Eh, not Alessos best. You just can't remix this

**vayyiqra** (7): much as i love this song i hate remixes and find they're almost always useless and worse than the original nevertheless this is okay in a "if i were high on MDMA at an underground club this would be boppable"

**tapdancingpig** (6.8): Look, I really hate remixes. But this one... is ok. I was about to give this a 2, but then I heard digitalized version of the ABBA sample, and that part is worth a lot more than a 2.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): It‚Äôs certainly different, but I don‚Äôt know if I like it. The original was already pretty perfect, and adding effects and pauses and breakdowns and things doesn‚Äôt really do anything for me.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.2): hey they play this at my gym

**evilqueenlex** (5): this remix makes it boring

**RomanOrgy69** (5): I‚Äôm not sure what the point of this remix was. It made the song sound a lot more dull and lifeless.

**whatareblackhole** (4): This is so unnecessary and BAD.

#mushrooms on pizza are amazing though (this remix is not)

deleted: # #28: Madonna - Push

The second song on Confessions to be inspired by the Middle East, *Push* is a real overlooked gem of a song. The hypnotic strings, the build-up of different vocal effects, the twinkly bells - they all make for an amazing ode to someone who Madonna considers a source of inspiration and motivation. Is it her lover? Is it her family? Is it God? We don't really know. *Push* surprises the listener with its expression of gratitude and selflessness, especially considering Madonna's famous no-fucks-given attitude.

**Humantrashcan** (10): THIS SONG PERSONALLY RAISED ME, I submitted this wrong the first time and didnt put a score to one of the songs and decided I was just not gonna do it but tbh I only resubmitted it so I could give miss Push the 10 she deserves.
 
**tapdancingpig** (9.5): My kind of repetitive hook. One of the more unique beats on the album.
 
**chipsi1** (8.5): WIG
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): the interesting production saves this tbh
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Nice, the production on this track really feels alive but Madonna manages not to get lost in the mix. The album really started picking up on the back half, didn‚Äôt it?
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): A cute little anthem, and a personal thank you from Madonna that makes you think of her more innocent hits like Cherish and Open Your Heart. I feel as if it can apply to multiple people, such as her friends, family, children, and, yes, even her fans. It's a great penultimate song for sure.
 
**MrSwearword** (8): again, not bad per se, but it's a stacked cast.
 
**Omgcow** (8): Living for the sudden shift to this international vibe
 
**RoiduLames** (8): Nice production and she had a pretty cool flow(?) going on at some points all combined with a smooth prechorus(?) makes this a highlight of the album
 
**technoprayers** (8): another nice bop on the album that‚Äôs really groovy
 
**whatareblackhole** (8): This is fine. I got kind of bored while listening to it, but it‚Äôs cute.
 
**evilqueenlex** (7.5): Finally, something other than trancelike EDM
 
**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): First Whisperney, then Whisperlie, and now Whisperdonna
 
**twat\_brained** (7.4): Disregard my earlier comment, I am indeed familiar with this. Is this dedicated to her fans or to Guy? It makes more sense to me if it was her fans. That glass percussion brings back memories.
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (7): Probably my least favorite, but doesn't detract much from main flow of album
 
**PuggleMaster** (7): I like it, but it's missing so OOMPH
 
**vayyiqra** (7): this album is repetitive as hell that said its formula works so well i'm not mad also lol @ the wubwub

Donna Summer might have been a legend of disco, but did she come up with a hook as genius as "in the evidence of its brilliance"?? I don't think so. Future Lovers is somewhat of a more spiritual version of Kylie's [*Light Years*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNNAkCyCyBw), both clearly inspired by *I Feel Love*. Unfortunately, all that love wasn't enough for this anthem to pull through... what a shame.

**futuristic:**

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i feel love 2: electric boogaloo
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (10): Donna Summers who
 
**RomanOrgy69** (10): I can‚Äôt hear this song without thinking of that iconic disco ball stage entrance
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): >listens to I Feel Love once
 
**Sayaam** (9): One of her most ~cool~ songs
 
**skargardin** (9): Listening to this album is a religious experience, I‚Äôm crying
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): PC Music sounded great in 2005!
 
**teenage\_meme** (9): not a fan of the spoken intro, but otherwise, this is my favourite on the album. i'm a sucker for a beat with those quick little pulses!
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (8.5): If you haven't yet I HIGHLY recommend checking out the version of this that she performed on the Confessions Tour where she mashes this up with I Feel Love; it's an experience.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Here it comes! I know you've missed it, guys! Are you ready?, it's time for yet another example of psuedo-mysticism from Madonna herself! Okay, okay, I don't think the introduction really means anything, but true to the refrain, this song is brilliant; it shows that Madonna doesn't have to stick to her Ray of Light persona to wow the gays with how enlightened she is.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Sounds like watered down SOPHIE, a decade ahead of its time
 
**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Something pretty new! I appreciate the disco influence. Every time the album veers into repetitive synths, something comes along and saves it!
 
**twat\_brained** (8.1): What does the lyric "In the evidence of its brilliance" have to do with the song? Why is it repeated so much throughout the song? I don't exactly get it. I'm reminded somewhat of "Ray of Light" when I listen to it. Most of the song just feels like noise for the sake of noise.
 
**MrSwearword** (8): yes, this is famous for a well received mashup of this and I Feel Love by Donna Summer at the tour...however, on its own, it's great but doesn't measure up against the greats on this album.
 
**rotating3Dtext** (8): sounds sooo mid-2000s "futuristic"
 
**technoprayers** (8): its really nice but not as good as the first three holy bops
 
**vayyiqra** (8): more weird electro bangers being served up by queen madge, this is like if ray of light and daft punk had a baby and i'm for it
 
**whatareblackhole** (8): Okay, I originally didn‚Äôt like this one, but when I started thinking of Madonna as a cult leader, especially on the disco crucifix from the Confessions tour, I started loving it so much more.
 
**stardustanddinos** (7.5): I love how different the structure of this song is.

**stuck in the past:** 
---
**Banananaise** (6): nothing says sexy like "administration, bills and loans"
 
**evilqueenlex** (6): this track didn‚Äôt make me forget my problems
 
**hikkaru** (6): Not a huge fan of the spoken parts :/
 
**IaEStI** (6): the repeated part is more irritating the more i listen to it
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (5): She says she‚Äôs gonna tell me about love but then like‚Ä¶ I had to go to both Genius and songmeanings.com to try and figure out what she‚Äôs talking about on this track. I think it‚Äôs something about spirituality? It‚Äôs giving me *Ray of Light* vibes but club music isn‚Äôt necessarily the best vehicle for any message with nuance and this is just incomprehensible. It‚Äôs kinda pretty I guess, the ‚Äúin the admittance of its brilliance‚Äù is memorable but overall it‚Äôs kinda eh.
 
**mudkip1uwu** (5): listening to these long ass songs that drone on for years just make me think of all the people complaining about mitski's short song lengths on Be The Cowboy. and i have to laugh because i'd much rather listen to her concise, direct songs rather than this.
 
**Omgcow** (5): This feels like loading screen music for a futuristic video game
 
**RoiduLames** (5): I liked some of the ascending background vocals but yikes the lyrics
 
**popiquin** (2.3): The album takes a dark turn into mediocrity as Madonna is drowned out by overwhelming synths for the better part of the track ‚Äì and when she isn't, she's obnoxiously whispering to me about love and I just tune out.
