Do you know *that guy*? The one on the train, who takes his phone from his pocket, opens the YouTube app, types in "hottest trap compilation 2018" and plays it out loud? This song is actually dedicated to *that guy*. Actually, this write-up is dedicated to *that guy*. I hope you're reading this. Fucking. Stop. Do you even have any dignity left? Do you know what that word means? Are you physically able to realize that people want to be left alone because they spent 3 hours travelling and now they're going to suffer for 3 more because you felt the irresistible urge to play Post fucking Malone for everyone to listen? Oh fuck now that kid started crying. I hate you. I hate you so much. The song's cool tho

#Spotify Premium

**Itsafudgingstick** (10): I guess since I mentioned them in my Toy Soldier comment, Imma just point yall to the Fanny Pak performance of this on ABDC

**MeanToBeIconic** (10): EXPERIMENTAL and funk as fuck y'all this is good stuff

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): why üëè wasn‚Äôt üëè this üëè released üëè a üëè single? üëè Madonna fell in love with this song and for that it garnered significant media attention. Talk about missed opportunities.

**MrSwearword** (10): FANTASTIC & WELL CRAFTED.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): that little voice reminds me of die antwoord. great song tho

**Sayaam** (10): Such a dark track, she needs to work with Bloodshy & Avant again

**Humantrashcan** (9): EYE CON IQUE

**Leixander** (9): Chill bop!

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): tbh this song feels like it isnt mixed properly BUT its a banger so

**rickikardashian** (8.7): This is so Gaga circa-The Fame era, and Gaga wasn‚Äôt even a thing back then. Kylie has been drawing the path our main girls followed and never asked for anything in return. Kylie was the unseen Messiah.

**Banananaise** (8): tfw you grab your mini boombox and rock hard like a cinderblock

**RoiduLames** (8): Once again the production (specifically the vocal effects) really helped elevate the whole track!

**vayyiqra** (8): i have no idea what this song is about but the production is fire also lady gaga? i don't know her telephone number

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): This is just Madonna's Impressive Instant but less weird, still a bopthough

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): The electric keyboard sound before and after the chorus is great

#Dailymotion

**twat\_brained** (7.5): I spent the past two minutes checking to see if she gave credit to whoever Missy Elliott sampled for "Lose Control". She didn't. I'm disappointed. -1 for that

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I get that this is a fan favorite but personally I‚Äôve never been a huge fan of it. I think ‚ÄúNudity‚Äù is basically the better version of this track. She low-key predicted the streaming era though.

**Joebiekong** (7): In comparison with Blackout, this doesn't make you want to dance as much.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): Yeah, I don't know whether I like this or not either. Sometimes I think it's a fun bop but other times I find the hook lazy and uninspired.

**tapdancingpig** (6.5): These vocals seem overly processed, and I‚Äôm a Charli stan. I wish there was a better hook, because the setup is a lot of fun.

**IaEStI** (6): the harps are very misleading...I feel uncomfortable

**YawnMendes** (6): Listen to Sing Sing by GAZ

**whatareblackhole** (5): Drop your socks, y‚Äôall! Not a fan of this one. The lyrics are so weird. Oof.

**PuggleMaster** (4): this sounds really dated

**fifthchevron** (2): Does this song have a pulse?

#the type of fun i‚Äôm getting into

**chipsi1** (10): aa

**mudkip1uwu** (10): this album is just bop after bop

**RoiduLames** (10): From my first listen to this album a couple of years ago this has always been my favorite song and high key nothing has changed

**tapdancingpig** (10): Yeah, this song is obnoxious. But let‚Äôs not pretend that you don‚Äôt dance your goddamn ass off every time you hear it.

**lady\_sable** (9.5): this should've been a single binch we were robbed!!

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): Getting Nadia Oh and early Gaga vibes from the production

**QustoMar** (9): very underrated, i bop to this song 24/7, and i love the bridge with people talking about britney and somewhat subtly continuing the thread of the album being, a big finger, to the media

**skargardin** (9): This shit goes harder than I remember omg

**technoprayers** (9): why wasn't this a single, this is one of the best songs on Blackout

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I like this but it's even better mashed up with "Do You Wanna Come Over?".

**teenage\_meme** (8.5): YE SMASH ON THE RADIO BET I PENNED IT

**IaEStI** (8): her pronounciation keeps the song interesting

**MeanToBeIconic** (8): I liked this A LOT when I was younger, but the Sean Garrett production was REALLY not amazing looking back lol

**vayyiqra** (8): i think the toy soldier is a penis? no really the production on this is fire

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): A fun lil bop

**Banananaise** (7): bitch me too.gif

**fifthchevron** (7): I'm not one for the spoiled brat tone but I like the energy and the militaristic beat.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Something about this song sleeves me out. I think I‚Äôm reading into it too hard but I‚Äôm kind of tired of the image of the soldier as the paragon of masculinity and the metropolitan man as shameful and undesirable. It‚Äôs a super galaxy brain take but there it is. I get what she‚Äôs trying to say here I just wish she‚Äôd phrased it a bit different, lyrically and musically. One half of me loves how it sounds but the other half of me is completely annoyed by it. It‚Äôs fun in a trashy kind of way, her vocal performance is kind of grating and every single musical effect they layered onto it is obnoxious (those synths? please) but at the same time that‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ kind of the fun part.

#sick of toy soldiers

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Britney's southern drawl really makes this song; you feel as if this is shade directed toward Kevin Irrelevantline and her complaints manage to be at least somewhat entertaining. Despite those positive qualities, however, it sadly doesn't come together as a wholly satisfying track.

**MrSwearword** (5): the pacing is sort of giving me Daft Punk vibes, but then again, they'd never allow this much vocal fuckery on one of their songs.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.2): literally does anyone remember what this sounds like when it's not playing

**whatareblackhole** (4): OOF, this shit is truly annoying. I don‚Äôt like the lyrics, I don‚Äôt like her vocals, I don‚Äôt like the production‚Ä¶I get the idea, but it just doesn‚Äôt read well to me. ‚ÄúA really bad ass solider‚Äù is such an intensely bad lyric.

**Itsafudgingstick** (2): I feel like the only time I've come close to really vibing with this song is when I watched Fanny Pak perform to a mix of this in Season 2 of America's Best Dance Crew

**Lowest Scores:** (1 x1) MrSwearword (2 x1) TragicKingdom1

**fifthchevron** (9): The second verse though, the tea is scalding...I love that the song is super dramatic too.

**lady\_sable** (9): she said fuck!! britney said fuck!!

**MeanToBeIconic** (9): Glad this is unreleased (wrong image to paint) but a wonderful peek into the process

**whatareblackhole** (9): LOL I loved this stupid bop

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): slutty bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Unironically I kind of love this? The sort of delicate, spidery vibe of it really does it for me, she sounds like an evil queen or something taunting the hero. Reminds me of [Janet‚Äôs ‚ÄúSon of a Gun.‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA5nMf5Pngw&frags=pl%2Cwn) The Disney-esque instrumental breakdown has potential but the actual orchestrations are kind of tinny. I wish they‚Äôd just gone full drama with this because it doesn‚Äôt go *quite* far enough to pull off what it‚Äôs going for but it‚Äôs still a really neat idea. The part where Britney goes down to the literal lowest note possible for her is a bit rough but I appreciate the intention.

**vayyiqra** (8): well this is certainly dramatic i like it better than some of the album tracks in fact

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): This sounds like a cousin of an In The Zone track. I wish this got finished, really. It‚Äôs got good bones, but it would need work before it got released.

**RomanOrgy69** (6.5): I can see why this was scrapped as well

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Production is interesting, but her delievery is not quite there.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (4): that explosion fucking shook me

**Sayaam** (4): A mess from the tacky intro

**evilqueenlex** (3): sounds cheap

**MrSwearword** (1): this is probably some secret Original Doll scrapped track. Whatever it's scrapped from, it deserved this because eww this is trash too

You'd think the Ray of Light era would have ended by 2005? Ha. Madonna returns to the theme of spirituality and she does it in style. Although different than most songs on Confessions, the rapid, trancy feeling of the song blends quite efficiently with the rest of the album and is undeniably one of the most interesting CoaD deep-cuts, and, perhaps, songs in her entire discography.

---

#Now I know you fear God

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): highkey the best song on the album! the drama! the production! the MMMMMMMMMMM

**IaEStI** (10): dEpTh

**Leixander** (10): The middle east influence in this is so good.

**MeanToBeIconic** (10): This was the longest grower for me, but it was SO fucking worth it. This song makes me feel invincible tbh

**RoiduLames** (10): By far and away the best song on this album and honestly I feel like it has such great lyrics

**shether** (10): my wig is travelling to israel as i type this

**technoprayers** (10): this holy serve. Mother Madge snapped with this one

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is the shot of energy I needed in the album, this song is great. The beat is fantastic and the sample of her friend singing makes this track very distinctive on an album where the songs really blend together. Madonna finally places herself front and center in the mix and she actually starts making sense for once, reminding you that this is her album, not just a tapestry of club sounds.

**Itsafudgingstick** (9): Ugh this song is just so beautiful, from the start with the chanting to the amazing "chorus" (it's really mostly humming but it's just perfect). This definitely goes with Paradise (Not for Me) as far as extremely unique tracks that sound absolutely nothing like Madonna has ever done in her career.

**tapdancingpig** (9): Awesome sample to theme a song around. It works amazingly well, despite/because of it‚Äôs odd ideas.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): catchy but weird

**stardustanddinos** (8.5): This is one of the most beautiful songs on this album. The Hebrew chanting interspersed with such uplifting lyrics! Severely underrated!

**teenage\_meme** (8.5): i like this song if only for breaking up an album that was getting monotonous! it's sick on its own too :) also, doesn't the "mm-mm-mm" sound like the one she does in 'frozen?'

**MrSwearword** (8): atmospheric but isn't able to stand with the other songs on its own

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I...I just don't know how to feel when Madonna gets all mystic and stuff. I've forgotten where this sample is from, but it obviously falls into this category, and while I get hints of sincerity from Madonna I also feel strange about hearing a rich white woman get into this sort of shit. Anyway, despite my personal complaints, the sample here is great, so I'm giving it a fair amount of points.

**survivorjdmarina** (8): diversity queen

**whatareblackhole** (8): This sounds like a Ray of Light remix. I‚Äôm into it.

**chipsi1** (7): what was said

**RomanOrgy69** (7): A spiritual bop, I stan!

**twat\_brained** (7): I'm not religious so I have no strong opinion towards this. I give her credit for taking an artistic risk with having someone sing Hebrew on the track.

**vayyiqra** (7): this is weird i guess this is her kabbalah phase at work anyway it's a bop so i guess i love israeli folk music now??

**PuggleMaster** (6.5): This song isn't AMAZING but it's a welcome improvement over the others

#I'm an atheist and a freethinker

**popiquin** (4.3): WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS

**MariahGr8rThnJesus** (4): - this is the point where the album stops dead

**tapdancingpig** (11): Perfection. First of all, this is the best Britney has ever sounded. This track, her other co-writing credit, is easily the most unique on the album. How many synthpop club songs featuring flamenco guitar do you know? It‚Äôs also the climax of her obsession with the word ‚ÄúBaby,‚Äù and oh boy, what a climax it is!
 
**Omgcow** (10): I sometimes see this one ranked on the lower end of Blackout and I will NOT stand for it
 
**tevinterimperium** (10): I love how she says "baby" a million times
 
**twat\_brained** (10): You know people sometimes track the number of times someone drops an f-bomb in a movie? Someone should do that for however many times Britney says "baby" during a song. I bet BOMT has more "baby"s though but probably not by much.
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.5): I know Womanizer is a ripoff of this song instead of the other wayaround but I heard Womanizer first so I'm biased against this
 
**Leixander** (8.5): That infectious guitar!
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (8): I think it's charming! It's great fun
 
**RoiduLames** (8): We love a Spanish guitar! This is low key such a sultry, sexy like woman-on-a-mission track, its so good!
 
**saucymac** (8): the chorus saved this song,
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8): Ooh La La found dead
 
**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Good, but a little to repetitive
 
**auxjuan** (7): Is it just me, or does this sound exactly like 3?
 
**evilqueenlex** (7): I might be tripping but the melody sounds like Womanizer
 
**fifthchevron** (7): Something about her vocals here don't do it for me, and the editing with her laugh is sloppy. I always felt like this belonged on an earlier album.
 
**IaEStI** (7): definition of front-loaded
 
**MrSwearword** (7): at least boring album cuts here have some liveliness to them.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): The Gary Glitter sample makes me feel pretty queasy, but as a song in itself, this is quite alright. It's a different style of danceable pop than most of the other songs on the album, but this is chic enough to hit the mark for sure. Really a grower on your ears.
 
**i'm child-free thanks:** 
---
**chipsi1** (6): baby (x231212)

**vayyiqra** (6): this song is not the oxygen that i need in fact it is in need of some iron itself because it's a little anemic but it's not bad i guess
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Kind of sounds like a budget ‚ÄúWomanizer.‚Äù Pretty generic all things considered, it kind of sounds like every other song on the album just got thrown into a blender. You can clearly hear hints of ‚ÄúHot as Ice‚Äù and ‚ÄúRadar‚Äù to the point where I keep waiting it to transition into those.
 
**QustoMar** (5): the song that really fights the claim of blackout having no filler. it's just a very basic song that could've been left out and not detract anything from the album
 
**whatareblackhole** (5): Next.

**MrSwearword** (10): TRIGGER MY TIMBERS, BITCH

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): dancing is now my only friend

**MeanToBeIconic** (7): haha I love the goofy hip hop middle

#pull the trigger, piglet

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Mm, I see why this wasn‚Äôt on the real album. It‚Äôs fine but it‚Äôs kind of, like, almost paint by the numbers? It feels like a really lazy attempt for Madonna to expound upon the themes of the album (she‚Äôs literally just listing things) and I‚Äôm glad she realized it.

**RomanOrgy69** (6): It‚Äôs alright, but it‚Äôs not great and doesn‚Äôt fit in with the rest of the album. I can see why it didn‚Äôt end up on the actual album.

**Sayaam** (6): A mess

**vayyiqra** (6): this isn't terrible but the lyrics are dumb and her vocals have too much rhotacism i just can't fuck with this :/

**PuggleMaster** (10): Wow this is really good wig
 
**whatareblackhole** (10): Oh, I love this one. This is probably my favorite on this album. It‚Äôs so wonderfully breezy and she sounds so confident on it. Plus, the lyrics are adorable.
 
**jamesfog** (9.5): Jordin Sparks is shook
 
**teenage\_meme** (9.5): this song is SO CUTE ____
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I really like this song but I‚Äôd never seen the music video before and wow it‚Äôs bad and doesn‚Äôt match the tone of the song. It‚Äôs too cheap and sexual for such an elegant track. I‚Äôd also like to give a shoutout to [the weird version featuring MIMS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv3yl6Kks7M&frags=pl%2Cwn) It makes sense for her to have someone to play off of and MIMS‚Äôs voice honestly sounds nice, but then he delivers a really bizarre verse about how he won‚Äôt stop cheating on Kylie, but like, tries do redefine what he means by cheating? It‚Äôs odd.
 
**IaEStI** (9): I love it...I'd give it a 10 if it was a bit less soft
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (9): I like the groove and vocals
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): a nice dabble into R&B, i guess
 
**technoprayers** (9): oh shit Kylie, I see you girl and I'm here for it
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Aww! This is a cleverly disguised 90s-esque love song and the way Kulie executes it is just adorable. It's one of the best 'softer'-sounding tracks on this album and I'd consider it one of my favourite songs on here, too.
 
**twat\_brained** (8.1): Are we sure this isn't "One Step at a Time" by Jordin Sparks? I haven't heard that song in years, but the similarities are unmissable.
 
**Banananaise** (8): did she just say DJ got me feeling like a dick or
 
**vayyiqra** (8): lowkey bop also lol@the abrupt ending
 
**evilqueenlex** (7.8): almost an eight, almost.
 
**tapdancingpig** (7.1): The hook is a little stickier, but it‚Äôs still falling into the category of ‚Äúcute, but not great‚Äù
 
**fifthchevron** (7): Nice, should've been a single.
 
**Omgcow** (7): This sounds so much like One Step at a Time by Jordan Sparks
 
**Sayaam** (7): An acceptable offering
 
**survivorjdmarina** (7): It‚Äôs cool I guess
 
**saucymac** (6): who was this song originally for, because this is NOT a kylie sounding song
 
**MrSwearword** (5): why does this sound like Cassie or Amerie said no to this
 
**RoiduLames** (1): This song sounds like its trying very hard to be a Mariah Carey Charmbracelet-era song but really failed, definitely my least favorite on the album

**Leixander** (10): My favorite on the album, has a perfect catchy chorus
 
**Omgcow** (10): I knew like 2 seconds in that this was going to be a complete bop
 
**twat\_brained** (9.2): The strings just give me so much life but Kylie also sounds great here and overall makes for a good slowburner on the dance floor.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): One of my favourite Kylie songs that I've heard so far! I wasn't expecting a song like it on this album, but I really enjoy the orchestral elements-they make the song sound grandiose and elegant. The title really fits in with the song's vibes-this is a track you're supposed to sense and feel.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): WHAT is that sound
 
**Banananaise** (8): (background voice) whOOH
 
**vayyiqra** (8): why does this sound like a perfect pastiche of late 90s alternative queens it's making me nostalgic tbh
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (7.7): she's a cute girl
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Kind of gives me Madonna vibes? The vaguely (I think) Middle Eastern production and random hooting are definitely things that Madonna would do. I like how it expands on this idea of sensation that follows throughout the album, she can never quite find the words to describe what she‚Äôs feeling but she makes sure to let us know that she‚Äôs feeling them, and that her body is fluent.
 
**IaEStI** (7): great chorus, beautiful chorus...the outro elevates the song but I wish it was used at 1:00 too
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (7): Cool sound, but meh delivery
 
**whatareblackhole** (7): A cute lil ‚Äújust OK‚Äù bop.

**MeanToBeIconic** (9): I love the sample!!! Get's my hearbeat GOING

**RomanOrgy69** (9): Why wasn‚Äôt this also put on the album? Were Britney and her collaborators smoking crack at the time? What would make them to cut this?

**static\_int\_husp** (9): That Eurythmics sample is still incredibly fresh.

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): Wow the Eurythmics sample is actually really good!

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): omg what is thisss

**Sayaam** (7): The worst track on Blackout still slaps

**vayyiqra** (7): i legit love eurythmics so this is a jam that said it adds little to the original sample

**fifthchevron** (6): The sample is good but there's not much else here

**tapdancingpig** (6): This one is... interesting. I mean that both genuinely and sarcastically. I kind of with Britney straight up covered Sweet Dreams instead of doing this song, because the parts I like about the track are the parts that are closest to the original (with the exception of the rapping, which I like, and the vocal sample, which I do not).

**Banananaise** (5): not even this sample can save this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I‚Äôm of the opinion that you shouldn‚Äôt use a sample if you‚Äôre going to get overwhelmed by the sample. Madonna used a sample of ‚ÄúGimme Gimme Gimme‚Äù on ‚ÄúHung Up‚Äù to great effect because the sample meant something there and the resulting song was at least as good as the source material. Here the ‚ÄúSweet Dreams‚Äù sample feels misplaced because that‚Äôs just unquestionably a better song on every level. Vocally, musically, thematically, it‚Äôs just stronger all around, so when Britney chops off a little piece of it for her own usage on a fairly generic club track here you start to wonder why you aren‚Äôt just listening to the original.

**evilqueenlex** (3): not a good enough use of a Eurthymics‚Äô sample

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): this is an example of bad sampling

While it's a well-established fact that Godney invented dubstep, she didn't do it in 2011 with chart-topping classic "Hold It Against Me," but instead with "Freakshow" back in 2006. The dubstep is subtle but makes a lasting impression - it adds a gritty texture to this dirty sex jam that's makes the song playful despite its short length. Britney herself even seems to have a particular affinity for "Freakshow" - she included it in her Circus and Piece of Me tour setlists. Buy your tickets today! (thanks poo!)

#Yo tonight I'm bout to mash
 
**jamesfog** (10): Underrated bop, created dubstep
 
**lady\_sable** (10): i can't believe that this song was released in 2007. like you could tell me that it came out a few years ago and i'd be like "yeah sounds right."
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (10): I love Dubney, and this is SO cutting edge. Bit sized edge on the album
 
**mudkip1uwu** (10): BOP
 
**Omgcow** (10): Invented dubstep
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): One of Britney‚Äôs cowrites. So ahead of its time, it‚Äôs my favorite kinky bop.
 
**whatareblackhole** (10): WIG! This is the shit I‚Äôm here for. This is a good length and has a fun beat and some truly stupid lyrics. I liiiive for this. I feel like I would hear this at a high school Halloween party in 2008.
 
**Joebiekong** (9.8): This used to be the best song when I first heard the album but it has slipped dramatically by 0.2 points.
 
**fifthchevron** (9): I love verses set out like this, what are they called? It's kind of a basic, straightforward "Fuck me, I'm famous" song but it still works well enough. Again, more fun creative decisions in warping her voice to that deepened tone which is surprisingly effective. The song is called "freakshow", obviously freaky shit should be happening!
 
**RoiduLames** (9): This song is a bop no matter what you say and we love a freaky b****!
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): Oh ok now I know what American Horror Story S4 was based off
 
**teenage\_meme** (9): literally every day i think about how britney used dubstep in 2007
 
**evilqueenlex** (8.7): Britney invented dubstep?
 
**chipsi1** (8.5): wig
 
**twat\_brained** (8.4): Ended Ryan Murphy before Britney revived him for her Glee tribute episode
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (8): Literally invented dubstep, wish this was way longer
 
**rickikardashian** (7.8): I used to watch AHS: Freakshow on school with my tablet, and no one ever cared about it considering everyone would watch movies on class with their tablets lol, but the one time I got caught by a teacher doing it was when I was watching the episode where Dandy was bathing wearing only underwear on a bathtub full of blood, and to this day I wish they would have caught me watching gay porn, because it would have been ten times more easy to explain.
 
**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): at the start i was like "what, black mirror"
 
#Make dem other bitches mad
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Apparently this is Britney's favourite Blackout deep cut, huh? It's a little more delightfully trashier than all the previous songs, somehow-must be something in her vocal performance, but, eh, it's not for me. I can still bop to it well enough, though!
 
**QustoMar** (7): obviously it invented dubstep but other than that it's whatever
 
**technoprayers** (7): another cute girl but the beat kind of annoys me
 
**vayyiqra** (7): was not expecting to like a song that literally begins with wubwubwubwub

Someone has set their radar on you... and it's not Britney. *Like a Drug* is a song of a sexually depraved drug-addicted fembot and I've got some news for you - fembots have feelings too. She admires how delicate and fine the lover is and lets him know that KYLIE. WANT. MORE. Her cooing and heavy electro instrumentation is a well-established duo and, in a way, it finds itself somewhere between Blackout's eroticism and Confessions' retro chic.
 
---
 
#I want more
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (10): How can you NOT love this electro-gold????
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is miles better than the album opener
 
**rickikardashian** (10): This was perfectly constructed for the chorus to transport you a music video. The whole atmosphere is perfect. I want to live here forever.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): I WANT MORE!
 
**twat\_brained** (9.1): That bass drum is immensely enticing. In fact, the whole song is incredibly fun! My dark horse for Miss Songeniality.
 
**hikkaru** (9): The chorus is kind of underwhelming tbh, but the production is so good
 
**Sayaam** (9): The best part is the hook that comes after the chorus
 
**vayyiqra** (9): that intro is FIRE holy shit this synth i'm even willing to overlook the basicity of the love=drug metaphor
 
**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Great hook, great production, fun lyrics, great pop song.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8): The song title definitely applies to this song
 
**IaEStI** (7): very one-note
 
**MrSwearword** (7): slightly boring but the beat is pretty decent.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I usually don't like drug metaphors in pop music, but this is pretty okay. The drop is hard-hitting, and it sets the album's robotic atmosphere well enough.
 
**RoiduLames** (7): Despite the lyrical clich√© this is a really solid track! Loved the production and background vocals on the chorus!
 
#Don't do drugs kids:
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This is kind of a letdown of a second track. I think that comparing love to drugs is kind of played out in music and this isn‚Äôt the song to bring new life to the phrase. There‚Äôs that one synth thing that keeps playing that I think is supposed to be the song‚Äôs ace, but it does nothing for me.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): lycandrock lycandrock
 
**whatareblackhole** (4): I‚Äôm giving this a 4 because that‚Äôs one point for every person that helped write this rather clich√© and boring track. This is not good so far, Ms. Minogue.

Personally, this song was an immediate standout from the album but I knew that it wasn't boppy enough for Top 10. I am glad it reached Top 20 though! I absolutely love how hypnotic and nostalgic this song is. Because, to be perfectly frank, it's a banal song. *Once upon a time, there was a boy and there was a girl* - Avril is shook, can you make it any more obvious? And yet, the banality of this song is what makes it charming. Madonna takes the trope of a modern Romeo and Juliet meeting at a ball and transforms it to a transcendental anthem full of vocoder, Daft Punk-inspired, sweeping synths and pulsating techno basslines. *Forbidden Love* makes me feel things.
 
---
 
#I love love
 
**MariahGr8rThnJesus** (11): - this song is my god
 
**MrSwearword** (10): I live for very well done album tracks like this.
 
**QustoMar** (10): almost got my 11 bc it's almost as good as hung up. idk how this wasnt a single bc it's a very beautiful song but still is a major bop. i feel like its extremetyl underrated as well, and tbh all songs on confessions. it's so often named as one of madonna's best albums yet a lot of the individual tracks aren't praised, which makes some sense since this is meant to be listened to as one whole cohesive unit, but still u kno
 
**RomanOrgy69** (10): I love how celestial this song sounds. It‚Äôs so beautiful.
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): Still as dancey as ever, but the off key horns and vocoders are a nice touch. A totally hypnotic bop. A highlight of the album.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9): the way this goes into Jump makes it even better than it already is
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): sexy chill electro bop
 
**whatareblackhole** (9): A chill dance bop! I‚Äôm really here for this especially after the attitude of I Love New York and the pulse of Let It Will Be.
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (8.5): This song is just so soothing, also I live for the transition into Jump
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (8): a very nice trance cut. Incredibly mature for Madonna
 
**technoprayers** (8): another lovely track on the album
 
**vayyiqra** (8): still feels like i'm in an exclusive nyc lounge in 2000 and i'm not mad
 
#Kissing? Ew
 
**twat\_brained** (7.9): Is this what Madonna was singing in her head when she made out with Drake in front of thousands of people? The vocoder is cool though
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Okay, can I be honest? I like the Forbidden Love from Bedtime Stories way better than this one. I like how Madonna ripped herself off, only she can do that (sorry, Gags) but the previous Forbidden Love had this smooth and refrined quality to it while I just see this as a normal track from Confessions.
 
**RoiduLames** (7): Cher vocal edits come through!
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.5): I could see someone falling in love with this song, but it doesn't do much for me.
 
**PuggleMaster** (5): This is so boring why is this album so long omg
 
**evilqueenlex** (4): too much of this sounds the same
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (4): [The eleven o‚Äôclock song in the musical *Zombie Prom* is called ‚ÄúForbidden Love!‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddQa1_XQ9xw&frags=pl%2Cwn) I love that show. Don‚Äôt like this song though.

2 Hearts is a really divisive song among Kylie fans. The biggest criticism of it comes from the fact that it was the lead single for X and its burlesque aesthetic suggested a more alternative, Self-Titled/Impossible Princess-esque direction of the album. On the other hand, thanks to the promotion efforts, the fans were blessed with the amazing music video with Kylie at her Nicole Kidmanest, performing as Marilyn Monroe from an alternative reality where she became a glam rock star in the 1960s. Another thing worth noting is the coolest use of a telephone beep ever.
 
---
 
#WHEN I FEEL HEAVY METAL (WOO-HOO)
 
**jamesfog** (10): Classy bop
 
**Leixander** (10): Classic.
 
**rickikardashian** (10): This sounds like every songs that plays on the background of a stripclub scene on a movie about a girl that got bored of her old life and decided to go to stripping, but while being there she realized all the other girls hate her and the boss won't let her have the main stage, until one day she does it because one of the girls gets sick and the public goes crazy for her and she becomes the main thotty in the place, but eventually falls in love with one of the guys on the club, that is also an undercover cop.
 
**saucymac** (10): this song is so sexy.
 
**Banananaise** (9): for the longest time this was just some song with a weird single cover on my hand-me-down ipod nano, only now do i understand... two hearts ARE beating together
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9): What a brassy, sexy opener for the album. There‚Äôs a sense of gravity to this track with that low thrumming piano and the rise and fall of the music, it‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ down and dirty and slutty. I‚Äôm living. Kylie throwing herself all over the piano in the music video is exactly what I feel like whenever I hear this song. There‚Äôs so much style to this song that Kylie could easily have gotten lost but she owns this track like a champ, her vocal performance is impeccable. I love that siren-call high note that she slams after every refrain of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in love.‚Äù Also Kylie looks beautiful in the video, she looks like Nicole Kidman in a Marilyn Monroe biopic.
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (9): Can I just say how much I freaking love how Kylie's voice is dripping pure sensuality here? It made me straight for a hot minute
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (9): I REALLY love this always did. It's so funk-ay. I love Kylie when she plays with unusual sounds
 
**stardustanddinos** (9): Amazing opener.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): That piano riff gets me every time
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (8.3): we love a glam rock chanteuse
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): 1-800-273-8255 but Logic's WOOs are replaced with Kylie's
 
**rotating3Dtext** (8): WOOO
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): Cute. The ‚Äúoohs‚Äù after each ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in love‚Äù really help the song.
 
**vayyiqra** (8): was not expecting a shuffle beat but this goes hard tbh
 
**twat\_brained** (7.3): Feels very burlesque to me.
 
#WHO CAN RELATE? WOO
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Hmm...I'm not sure what I think of this. It makes for an entertaining glam rock song, but I can understand the mixed critical reception; the production doesn't really sound steady enough, and that criticism also applies to Kylie's voice. It's a captivating track that's unfortunately not executed as properly as I hoped.
 
**Sayaam** (7): Her worst lead single and album opener - I get she was going for something different, but it was the worst possible track to represent the album
 
**static\_int\_husp** (7): Honestly, feels a little short
 
**QustoMar** (6.8): it's a nice song but i feel like there are a lot of half-fleshed out elements and nothing full
 
**chipsi1** (6.5): uhm hehe
 
**evilqueenlex** (6.5): this sounds really 2007
 
**fifthchevron** (6): It's fun and her vocal is surprisingly strong.
 
**IaEStI** (6): not enough "woo"
 
**MrSwearword** (6): this Kylie does burlesque number feels weird as shit for an opener.
 
**RoiduLames** (6): Really vibing(?) with the ‚ÄúWhoo‚Äùs throughout the chorus!
 
**teenage\_meme** (6): i really didn't like this song, aside from the ufo sounds, which made me nervous for the rest of the album. luckily i loved it!
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): that sound effect in the background sounds like someone is trying to call me mid-song dfhgoldfh
 
**whatareblackhole** (6): Oooh, a weak opener‚Ä¶openers really set the tone for me, so I‚Äôm not starting on a good note. This is fine, but‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not a fan.
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (5): an insta skip. Not the comeback single you‚Äôd hope from someone who released ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Get You Out of My Head‚Äù just 6 years ago
 
**PuggleMaster** (4): I have a feeling I'm not gonna like this album

Shoutout to kanyewestrep, I'm still shook he didn't give this Danja-signed anthem a 10! It's weird seeing that *Nu-di-ty*, a nearly identical song (I'd even serve a hot take and say sonically similar) so low and *Get Naked* so high, at least comparatively - and don't you interpret this as a shade, because I love *Get Naked*. The distorted beat reminds me a lot of Timbo's *The Way I Are* (unfortunately Britney didn't commit any grammar crimes here, which can't be said about Madge) and that is absolutely an advantage since even my stuck-in-the-80s mom slutdrops to that song. Anyway, all in all, I am not at all mad that *Get Naked* made it to Top 20. ~~That's also what Nu-di-ty deserved~~
 
---
 
#Binch my panties are already gone:
 
**fifthchevron** (10): Ultimate hoe anthem? I had a music video envisioned where she throws a sex party in the room from the horror movie 1408. I think the highlight here is the risks Danja took; who would've thought a droning male vocal would work for such an effective hook? The lyrics detail Britney and her man being too drunk to get sex happening, so the droning evokes a drunk guy wailing about how big his dick is with no intention of actually "taking it off" as Britney pleads him to. Also "I'm not ashamed of my beauty" at at time when the entire world was calling her fat and ugly was a nice fuck you moment along with "It's Britney bitch".
 
**Joebiekong** (10): The best producer-computer voice rap-bridge in a song ever.
 
**Leixander** (10): One of the first songs that got me hooked on this album.
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): my favourite pushup jam. I do 140 pushups to this song on repeat üò©
 
**MrSwearword** (10): I'm such a mental skank stripping to this song.
 
**Omgcow** (10): Danja snapped on this one
 
**QustoMar** (10): the most dark and sleazy song on blackout which is again, coul
 
**Sayaam** (10): Her weirdest song, her very own Impressive Instant
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): This is where the album goes from great to an important part of pop history. The weird duet is one of the most immediately memorable on the album. Who can refuse her whispers?
 
**twat\_brained** (9.7): This is the kind of song where it very much feels as long as it is but it's also really easy for me to get lost in the instrumental and just feel EVERYTHING Britney and her studio personnel have to offer on here.
 
**jamesfog** (9): I'm horny
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Desnudate (Get Naked (I‚Äôve Got A Plan)). One of the better songs on the album, there‚Äôs this underlying theme on the album of Britney kind of stumbling around a club blackout drunk and I think this song in particular really captures that. It reminds of those scenes in a movie where somebody is fading out in the middle of a crowd and everything starts stretching and distorting with the way all of these weird effects and vocals keep swirling around the track. Most noticeably the pitched down vocals of that dude are really effective in giving Britney something to play against. In fact, my biggest criticism of the track is that Britney gets really outshined by all of the elements around her.
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (8): Love this, but ESPECIALLY when it comes on in my sex playlist. Keeps things from getting too serious
 
**rickikardashian** (8): This feels like a song that would play on The Robot world, after the AI‚Äôs made humans slaves after they became too powerful for us to control, in the hottest club in the most expensive floating land, with them all grinding slowly as they whip caged human everytime Britney says ‚ÄùGet Naked‚Äù
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8): Gimme More‚Äôs younger sister tbh
 
**vayyiqra** (8): uh-huh yeah I'm bringing sexy back YEP
 
**chipsi1** (7.5): i read that the autotuned moans were supposed to be sexy. they are not.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): wow i wonder what her plan is
 
#Ew, gross
 
**whatareblackhole** (6): Oh, this was boring. This one really dragged for me. But I like Brinty calling herself a top, that‚Äôs iconic.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (5): No, let's save that for when we're selling real estate.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (0): i plan on never listening to this ever again
 
#**kanyewestrep** (5): production handled by DANJAHANDZ
 
**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): i would like this more without the guy
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I don't feel as if there's enough Britney on this song...it's mostly just that weird distorted voice that repeats the chorus for who knows how long. It's not like Britney singing it would be any better, but, IDK, there had to be a solution that'd lift this up from slightly above 'meh' level.
 
**RoiduLames** (6): This song would be so much nicer if he just never said ‚Äúeh?‚Äù ‚Äúahhh‚Äù its literally so annoying
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (4): Okay honestly I love some parts of this song but Danja coming in at random moments just takes me out of it. Is this how Ari fans who hate Pharrell felt when they listened to sweetener?
 
**mudkip1uwu** (2): i hate the sample or whatever that is

to be fair, you need a very high iq to understand hot as ice‚Ä¶is it an oxymoron? a metaphor? a certified banger? this blackout deep cut was my favorite song on the album when it first came out. now i have a newfound appreciation for perfect lover and heaven on earth but hot as ice is still fun, and in my personal top half of blackout.
 
---
 
#Twice as nice:
 
**Joebiekong** (10): The best example of lyrics rolling off the tongue.
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): is ice hot? I expect a scientific shitpost in the plug right after this song gets played
 
**MrSwearword** (10): the replay factor here is insane.
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): One of the stickiest hooks and best beats on the album. I almost gave it my 11, but that honor has to go to...
 
**IaEStI** (9): living (leg)end britknee
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (9): Queen SNAPPED, serving VOCALS
 
**technoprayers** (9): This song is also another bop that is in my top tracks of Blackout
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (8.5): I still don't know what "cold as fire, hot as ice" really means, like are you saying you're lukewarm britney? But it's easily one of the standouts of a top tier album and is near the top of her best deep cuts.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Huge improvement over the past couple of songs, that's for sure! This is a song full of contradictions, from the title itself to the way it goes-it's a wild, energetic ride from start to finish, and all the different sections of the melody accompany each other very well.
 
**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): i love this quirky song
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): Wow the production is pretty slick...
 
**twat\_brained** (8.3): She means dry ice right? Or is she referring to diamonds which have been heated up? +1 for the sexy riff though
 
**fifthchevron** (8): It's just...so weird? I like it, but what the hell is going on here? Throwback to when idiots thought she was singing "Make him come in my mouth/Making my new baby"...
 
**Omgcow** (8): Definitely in the lower half of the album for me but I still love it
 
**skargardin** (8): Katy is shook
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I like that weird operatic sounding trill that sounds off throughout the song. I wish that they‚Äôd given Britney a second pass at the vocals here, she‚Äôs clearly having a lot of fun but her vocals are *very* nasal and underwhelming here, which is a shame because I think it cheapens what‚Äôs otherwise one of the best written songs on the album.
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): It'd be a 6 if it wasn't for the backup vocals
 
**vayyiqra** (7): weird as this song is like we don't need another song with ice in the title also it just makes me think of icy-hot but anyway this kind of bops reminds me of early Madonna
 
#Cold as fire:
 
**whatareblackhole** (7): This is pretty clich√© and the lyrics are nonsensical. I would love to dance to this if I were wasted.
 
**QustoMar** (6): tbh it's kinda a filler song and there is not much to it except for the iconic line, living legend u can look but don't touch. other than that it's defo one of the weakest blackout songs
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): invented oxymorons
 
**mudkip1uwu** (5): this is kinda grating
 
**kanyewestrep** (4): production handled by DANJAHANDZ
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (3.7): the ugly Ice song on the album
 
**RoiduLames** (2): The vocal effects/background vocals in the chorus... I have to laugh, they‚Äôre so annoying and jarring. However, her vocals at the beginning of the song are cute so extra point for that

letsallpoo: I was surprised to see the mixed reception for this one... and then I wasn't.

Further proof of a deep generational chasm that divides /r/popheads into two camps; the twentysomething pop sophisticates with 15 to 20 years of top-shelf pop consumption to their name, and an unruly kid crew with Ariana Grande flairs and tributes to Charli XCX in their profiles. It's not that the latter generation is a lost cause entirely, but they've clearly never heard a "Britney" ‚Äî that is, they've never encountered a voice quite as distinctive as Britney's. "But I know Britney! Circus was the first album I bought!" First off, ask for a refund. And no, you don't know Britney, you know a very stilted and subdued version of the iconic performer.

The Britney of "Hot as Ice" is Britney as Britney is intended to sound. She very skillfully vacillates between a range of tones; she nasally, then guttural, then grainy, then nasally again, then delicate. (And yes, that's how she's supposed to do it.) She's sultry. She's goofy. She's sounds slightly absurd. She's fully engaged. She's expressive in ways that "technically superior" vocalists just aren't. She is brilliant. You have no idea how brilliant she is.

This is the probably purest attempt Britney has made to harness some of that ineffable charm that made her early work so irresistible. I adore it.

**MeanToBeIconic** (8): Cute little Keri Hilson number

**survivorjdmarina** (8): serving Ariana Grande on Bed teas

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This feels‚Ä¶ fresh? It could easily have been released by any of the modern indie-isa pop/r&b girls that people fawn over these days. I actually like a lot of the unreleased *Blackout* tracks more than some of the ones that made the final version. They had this very sleek, theatrical feeling to them that maybe wouldn‚Äôt have fit the finished album very well but still made them good songs.

**rotating3Dtext** (7): surprisingly nice
