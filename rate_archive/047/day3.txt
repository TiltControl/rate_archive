eight people forgot to rate this **official** remix, and i will never get over it!! learn to read fatties!!! also don't know what freemasons ever did to you besides sneaking into your house at night and cutting up all your wigs
 
---
 
#I read the intro post
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): gay
 
**fifthchevron** (10): I actually prefer this to the original...it feels more complete.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I‚Äôm not a huge fan of remixes but I absolutely feel that this stands up to and possibly surpasses the original version of this song. I heard this version of the song first and so the original was kind of a letdown, and though I‚Äôve come around on it, I still think this is the #1. It trims away some of the scope of the original, but in doing so streamlines it and makes it a laser beam of energy, a bolt of pure Kylie. I also adore that artsy perfume commercial-esque music video they shot for it, the swirling images of Kylie absolutely capture what the song feels like.
 
**IaEStI** (10): should've been the original
 
**MrSwearword** (10): OF COURSE THE GAY REMIX IS USED FOR THE VIDEO AND ENHANCES THE SONG.
 
**skargardin** (10): It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs worse so..
 
**teenage\_meme** (10): it sounds almost just like the original, which is good, because that means it remains perfect :)
 
**whatareblackhole** (10): WIG! This song was already great, and now it‚Äôs even better!
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): This is actually better than the normal version omg
 
**chipsi1** (9): wig
 
**jamesfog** (9): Album version is better
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): i enjoyed the naked men in the music video thank you u/awryj and u/sh-ether god bless
 
**RoiduLames** (9): I do have a strong bias against remixes, but this one was actually really quite good!
 
**rotating3Dtext** (9): i like it a little less than the album version
 
**Sayaam** (9): The rave beat is a really interesting take on the song even though it takes away from the ethereality of the original
 
**tapdancingpig** (9): I actually really like this remix. The remix and the original bring out different things in the song, which is the one reason remixes should exist. I rated the original higher because it‚Äôs still a remix.
 
**Leixander** (8): wow the video for this üò≥üò≥
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (8): It's still good! I just really prefer album cut
 
**evilqueenlex** (7): and now I‚Äôm in Forever 21
 
**technoprayers** (7): I thought I wasn't going to like this but wow, it's good, still prefer the original
 
#I listened to the 8 minute mix for no reason
 
**vayyiqra** (7): kinda pointless but whatever go off honey
 
**twat\_brained** (6.7): A bliss to listen to albeit at the expense of adding nothing to the original recording
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Not sure what this remix is for. The One could have benefited from a remix, since its one main flaw was rough production, but I can't find anything especially unique about this other than some extra rap verses. Not a fan.
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (3): I'm not usually a fan of remixes unless they bring something fresh and new to the song, which this didn't

the real 11 on blackout thanks for coming to my ted talk. I want to live in a world where perfect lover was the winner of this rate.
 
---
 
#Pop perfection:
 
**tevinterimperium** (11): Everything about this song is amazing. The way she says "I love it" leaves me wigless everytime I hear it.
 
**fifthchevron** (10): So slick and effortless. The pause for "....I love it" is EVERYTHING. A lot of pop stars try to be sexy but Britney...no trying needed, she's almost too good at it.
 
**Humantrashcan** (10): I accidentally forgot to do this song which is CRIMINAL as its the 2nd best non single here.
 
**IaEStI** (10): more like "Perfect Song"
 
**jamesfog** (10): Perfect Song
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I remember being literally shook when I heard the transition from ‚ÄúOoh Ooh Baby‚Äù to this song. I was in the grocery and when that aforementioned transition happened, I literally shook my head to one of the oven toasters on sale on an aisle. So yeah. Literally shook.
 
**Omgcow** (10): One of her best for sure, the ".... I love it" at the start of the second verse is one of my fave moments on the album
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): The real ending of the album, fight me. It‚Äôs hot, breathy, and a hell of a lot better than the actual ending of the album, which I do not talk about.
 
**evilqueenlex** (9.5): this is CORRECT.
 
**twat\_brained** (9): To me this sounds like a Get Naked retread. Now Get Naked fucking slaps so I'm not complaining but nonetheless I get what people are saying when they call Britney's music samey.
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (8): Honestly this song makes me feel things, primarily being in the mood to grind up on my nonexistent man
 
**vayyiqra** (8): this goes hard from the outset also wtf is this breakdown at the end did Britney invent trap beats? the answer is yes, omg her mind
 
#Imperfect lover:
 
**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): Whisperney?
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): Sounds like an In The Zone reject
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (7): It's REALLY sexy, but somehow manages to avoid making an impact really
 
**RoiduLames** (7): We love a sister who knows how to breathe!
 
**kanyewestrep** (6): production handled by DANJAHANDZ
 
**whatareblackhole** (6): I feel like I‚Äôve already heard this! Honestly this just sounds like a conglomerate of every other song so far, especially lyrically. It‚Äôs Ooh Ooh Baby ‚Äì Reprise, let‚Äôs be real.
 
**MrSwearword** (5): the chorus is a letdown but if a mere letdown is the problem on a Britney Spears album, that's a fucking miracle.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Yeah, I think this is the worst song on Blackout. I usually remember all of Britney's deep cuts after a few listens, but this never stuck out to me at all, which is bad-every track on an album as iconic as Blackout should at least try to be memorable.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Oh wow a filler track. I have nothing to say about this one, it‚Äôs pretty messy.

Britney brings mid 20th century warfare technology to the dancefloor with her double release *Radar*. Apparently, she believed it was a guaranteed hit and initially planned to make it a single, but *Break the Ice* was chosen instead - and you can see why. Even though *Radar* is nothing short of a bop, the uneven mixing and janky sounding production do sound oddly dated. Even though it might be somewhat of a subpar release as far as Blackout-era singles go, *Radar* made it far in the rate. Kylie's radar < Britney's radar y'all
 
---
 
#TARGET ACQUIRED. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
 
**IaEStI** (10): the anthem of horses everywhere...the bridge earns it a spot with the 10s
 
**jamesfog** (10): A Circus single bop
 
**rickikardashian** (10): Real talk, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything that radiates the confidence this does. The determination, the security on Britney‚Äôs voice, this is the mood I wish i had all the time. Before every date, job interview or court case, you have to give this a listen.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (10): The first three songs on this album are probably my three favorite Britney songs tbh
 
**technoprayers** (10): "I'm getting you so hot so hot" feed me mama
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): so good it made it to 2 albums oop
 
**twat\_brained** (10): This song coupled with Britney's invitation to Christian Audigier's 50th birthday celebration gave us the greatest stan account in existence. Neyde will forever be on my radar
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9.8): I miss u/throwaway963963963
 
**Leixander** (9.5): Even got mentioned in Necki Menij, wow.
 
**chipsi1** (9): wig
 
**Omgcow** (9): So nice she released it twice
 
**RoiduLames** (9): This song‚Äôs lyrics remind me of someone I like right now so thats a plus, also she loses a point for being in another album too
 
**lady\_sable** (8.5): ok this is a banger but like...britney did it have to be on two albums
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): This is actually the first Britney song I‚Äôve ever heard lmao
 
**tapdancingpig** (8.4): Sometimes I resent that this was also put on Circus, that it got the single treatment when some of my favorites didn‚Äôt. Sometimes I roll my eyes at this song because I overplayed it for a hot second. Then I hear it again and it‚Äôs like I have no free will.
 
**fifthchevron** (8): I really hate the chorus but the verses are so suave and sexual. Whew. The Circus Tour performance of this was everything.
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): Just good enough to justify the whole 2 albums thing
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Despite it getting a lower score than both, I feel as if this has better production than the preceding tracks-not in terms of sonic quality, just in terms of being clean enough to stick onto Britney's next album. Heh. The flirtatious lyrics are understandably a bit too robotic-sounding for some, but personally, I love them.
 
**whatareblackhole** (8): I love how this is on Blackout and Circus lolol she wanted to make sure we HEARD IT
 
#TARGET MISSED. MISSION FAILED.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Britney also included this on *Circus*  because she believed in it so much as a single and I don‚Äôt get why she stanned this song so hard. It‚Äôs not a bad song by any means, but the sort of sing-songy melody kind of makes it sound like something kids would chant on a playground. Britney sounds like she‚Äôs having a good time and her vocals are pretty powerful for this album though, so it‚Äôs still on the higher end of *Blackout* but it definitely gets overwhelmed on *Circus*. And does it sound like she‚Äôs saying ‚Äúoperator‚Äù to anyone else?
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (7): Never my favorite. Good production but so eh
 
**QustoMar** (7): tbh the most overrated song on blackout. 7 is still a kinda high and good score, but a lot of elements don't really sit right with me w/ radar. i adore good, shrieking, autotune, but in this song there is a lot of autotune but it just sounds unintenionally rough, i guess that's kinda foreshadowing for britney jean. and i love abrasive, ear attacking, production, and this song has some but again it doesn't feel like that was intended
 
**saucymac** (7): lmao this song does NOT hold up
 
**vayyiqra** (7): finally sort of see why all the gays lose their shit over this song also +1 for use of the word edginess a decade before it became a meme
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (6): It fits so much better here than on circus, but ultimately is still fairly average as far as the rest of Blackout goes
 
**kanyewestrep** (6): i think this ones a bop
 
**Humantrashcan** (5): this would've been like a 7 if they didnt force it onto Circus.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (2): pull the trigger piglet
 
**MrSwearword** (0): BRITNEY'S. WORST. SONG. EVER. The fact this shit was ported to Circus and it was STILL a 4th single should've been a clue that maybe this song shouldn't have happened. It deserved to tank at #88 on the Hot 100.

If you took the raw Femme Fatale deep cut "Trip to Your Heart" and threw it into the dark, sensual, convection oven of Blackout, you'd be rewarded with "Heaven on Earth," a gorgeously unsettling roast of a song. Britney literally invents ASMR on this track, as her leathery whispers detail every part of you and your world that she wants to explore. The interplay between the song's outward brightness and its dark underbelly is its highlight - especially with how the whispers tinge her melodious lyrics with a sinister edge - and at the end, when the twinkling instrumental is enveloped by discordant noises, it's clear which side has prevailed. (thanks poo!)
 
---
 
#I stan Belinda Carlisle:
 
**teenage\_meme** (11): i've been obsessed with this song since before the album came out, finding a leak on my newfound friend youtube (can you imagine??!). it's so atmospheric; her slow, drawn-out vocals on the pre-chorus mixed with the staccato countermelody going into that blissful starry chorus, oh my god. the extra beat in the second pre-chorus before everything stops and she breathes "yeah?????" the little twinkles throughout, the unexpected harmonies, the spoken lines. it's a swirling euphoric pop galaxy. as the song says, "fell in love with you and everything you are."
 
**fifthchevron** (10): This has to be one of her most beautiful, delicate vocal performances. I'm strongly reminded of Kylie's music, but Kylie could never deliver such emotive or expressive tone. Lyrically, it has a soft darkness to it as well with slightly unsettling lyrics like "Fall off the edge of my mind" and the whispers repeatedly asking "Would you catch me??".
 
**Leixander** (10): Your touch, your taste, your breath, your face, your hands, your head, you're sweet, your love, your teeth, your tongue, your eye, you're mine, your lips, you're fine... You are Heaven on Earth.
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (10): Those synth pulses and strangely evocative lyric, with Britney singing in an unusually compelling way make this a career highlight imo
 
**Omgcow** (10): The bridge is, in fact, heaven on earth
 
**QustoMar** (10): this is such a nice futuristic love song u kno, it just has a very strange placement in the tracklist. this pure love song about the innocent love britney has for her man, is in between a femme fatalle song, and a song about britney's strip club adventures. it really should've been right before why should i be sad but hey. heaven on earth also kinda fits in more with some songs off of cirus like, unusual you or shattered glass, rather than blackout. heaven on earth is p great
 
**Sayaam** (10): Gives me depressed Donna Summer
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): I‚Äôm a bit mixed on the droning club aesthetic of this album but I think it really works here to recreate the euphoria that Britney is describing. She gives probably the best vocal performance on the album here because it really plays to her strengths. She doesn‚Äôt need to do anything particularly impressive vocally for this track, her nasal voice is a surprising asset here because it helps her sound very girlish and sexy at the same time, if that makes sense. There‚Äôs almost a hint of innocence to her delivery that really makes her sound lovestruck. And I adore that bridge where she keeps answering herself and bouncing between lines, it sounds heavenly.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): this honestly is one of her best album cuts
 
**lady\_sable** (9): one of her best deep cuts
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): kinda broke the flow of the first 4 songs, but still a good one
 
**RoiduLames** (9): This song is really smooth and kind of beautiful but it doesn‚Äôt feel put of place in the album!
 
**tapdancingpig** (9): A little repetitive, but really sweet and fun. It‚Äôs easy to see why this was Britney‚Äôs favorite.
 
**vayyiqra** (9): holy shit that intro this is the peak of eurodance club trash and i love it
 
**rickikardashian** (8.8): I‚Äôm loving how this is still very boppy, maximalist and thotty, but still cute and delicate. This is for people like me, whores that are very sweet and believe in true love which manifests in sucking dick on the first date
 
**MrSwearword** (8): it's a cute song, but this could've improved Femme Fatale or one of Britney's other worse albums. It feels slightly misplaced here.
 
**RomanOrgy69** (8): A beautiful love bop!
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8): Wow Britney is really serving Whisperlena tees here
 
**twat\_brained** (8): That does NOT sound like Britney. Aren't we supposed to get Myah Marie'd at Britney Jean? Why now? Apart from that the production absolutely SLAYS but in any case, this loses points because it's the first song on the album that doesn't sound like Britney
 
**whatareblackhole** (8): It goes on a little long, but I like this song! It‚Äôs a strong follow up to the opening run of singles.
 
**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): it's weirdly ambivalent between sexy and cutesy
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): This is a really cute song! It's not as spectacularly astounding as the previous ones, but on a pretty dark album like Blackout, it helps to have a track like this that brings us back to Britney's bubblegum days. Her voice even resembles the old days during some points in the chorus.
 
**technoprayers** (7): she's a cute girl, a really cute girl but gorgeous devours cute
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): belinda carlisle shook
 
#Black Mirror? No I don't listen to emo anymore
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): it'd work better if it was less cutsey

Who needs Van Halen, when you've got good ol' Madge? *Jump* is nothing short of a disco anthem, directed to those who need and deserve a change in their lives. Inspired by her own move to NYC, the song's snappy drums and funk-inspired bassline encourages the listener to take the world in their own hands and *sway, swing and bend until they make it their own*. Who can do it but you?
 
---
 
#JUMP MOTHERFUCKER JUMP MOTHERFUCKER JUMP
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (11): Here's where the album leaps back up to some of Madonna's best work for me; a big part of Madonna's image has always been success, as we'll explore again in the next track, and coming from somebody as awesome as her, this track rocks; it inspires me to get motivated, achieve my dreams, and never look back at my previous life. It's such a euphoric song that does make me want to jump, funnily enough, so I'm giving it full marks and more.
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (10): I'll just shout this from the rooftop: this song deserved SO much better from the GP. It's such a danceable song but also really inspirational? And it's one of the few songs that I can listen to forever without tiring of it.
 
**MrSwearword** (10): THE 7TH GREATEST MADONNA SONG EVER
 
**Omgcow** (10): So far the singles are so much better than the album tracks. Also this was in the iconic soundtrack to my favorite movie, The Devil Wears Prada
 
**RomanOrgy69** (10): This is my second favorite, after Get Together
 
**rotating3Dtext** (10): iconic stuff. invented parkour
 
**twat\_brained** (10): It would not surprise me in the least if rates in sore feet spiked in the mid-'00s thanks to the release of this song thanks to people jumping around to this song.
 
**skargardin** (9): We love an empowerment anthem!
 
**tapdancingpig** (9): One of my favorite hooks on the album. The album has kind of lived in Madonna‚Äôs mid-range, so some lower notes are a nice addition.
 
**technoprayers** (9): every song titled Jump is a bop
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Eight tracks into the album and Madonna finally serves another bop! Queen of keeping us in anticipation.
 
**mudkip1uwu** (8): i love tyra sanchez
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8): jump in a car, and jump out!
 
**vayyiqra** (8): another fire beat and the lyrics are a mood somehow?? relatable queen
 
#You make me wanna jump-jump out the window
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (7.7): the weakest single on this album tbh it's just kinda flat compared to the others
 
**fifthchevron** (7): Devil Wears Prada, anyone?
 
**IaEStI** (7): meh
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (7): Good energy, but just doesn't really have the commitment the rest of the album does
 
**whatareblackhole** (7): I wasn‚Äôt super impressed with this one. I like the lyrics a lot, but the song as a whole didn‚Äôt really wow me.
 
**evilqueenlex** (6.7): the same but better than the last two tracks especially for that lyric ‚Äúthe more that you wait, the more talent you waste.‚Äù

#I can't believe a 2012 song was released in 2005:
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (11): THE. JUPITER. PAD. PULSING. Is a straight shot to heaven with every beat you GUYS I can't. This is a perfect pop song. Deserves Hung Up's legacy
 
**RomanOrgy69** (11): One of Madonna‚Äôs best songs, hands down.
 
**whatareblackhole** (11): Oh fucking wow. This was released in 2005 and it hasn‚Äôt aged one minute. This song is a SUPER bop. I can just imagine leaning against a wall in a room full of people and we‚Äôre all sweating, but I have my eyes on one person across the room and this whole song is the journey across the room to get to them. It‚Äôs dark, it‚Äôs hard, it‚Äôs vulnerable‚Ä¶it‚Äôs so many things. What an excellent follow up to the first track.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): perform this on tour again challenge
 
**fifthchevron** (10): Puts me in a trance, it's so dreamy and otherworldly.
 
**Humantrashcan** (10): This is peak mid 00s dance, this is like iced coffee always there for the gays when they need it.
 
**MrSwearword** (10): Deserved way better in that it undeservedly flopped and never made the Celebration/greatest hits album for that year. THE 4TH GREATEST MADONNA SONG EVER
 
**Sayaam** (10): HER BEST SONG, if I had an extra 11, it‚Äôd be for this
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): pussy tremble
 
**vayyiqra** (10): wtf this album is amazing how have i been sleeping on it for so long
 
**rotating3Dtext** (9.8): has what I call a "hairdresser's ambient music" vibe but really well done
 
**twat\_brained** (9.3): The tempo does weird things at times but other than that this absolutely bangs even though there's like 16 lyrics lol
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): >listens to Music Sounds Better With You once
 
**stardustanddinos** (9): AMAZING.
 
**technoprayers** (9): Its so energetic, we loves it mama
 
**popiquin** (8.6): Okay I claim to be a pop music expert and yet I have never listened to this album in full... I'm genuinely shocked at what great tracks I was missing. The core strength here is that synth and it just never stops pumping. Almost perfect, save for that weird choppy part around 3:20.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): This scored pretty damn high in PopJustice's last third of Madonna's discography rate, and it damn well deserves to score just as high in this rate, too. Madonna calls back to her more introspective lyrics with an euphoric style of production that just blows me away.
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): Solid. The beat is the star of the show. The melody feels really... classic somehow. I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs repetitive and I like it.
 
**Joebiekong** (7.5): I don't like the difference between the lyrics/boring vocal delivery and the dancy prod.
 
**Omgcow** (7): This feels like it would play in an H&M commercial and I mean that in a good way
 
#I hate people:
 
**chipsi1** (6): girl...
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Love the verses on this song but the chorus is a major letdown. Reminds me of Kylie‚Äôs song ‚ÄúIllusion‚Äù from *Aphrodite* (the bridge especially) which I kind of prefer.
 
**RoiduLames** (4): As one of my friends once said ‚Äúwith Madonna you get a couple good tracks and the rest are sh*t‚Äù and it rings true so far with this album

**whatareblackhole** (6): :thumbsup:

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): This feels unfinished. There‚Äôs no real bridge or anything, there‚Äôs just electric noise and then they repeat the chorus and then it just ends? Not a good showing Kylie.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): better than like half of X tbh. a true gem in her discography

**whatareblackhole** (10): Kinda wish there was more of this on the album :eyes:

**MeanToBeIconic** (9): ooh it's all grindy and loud I love

**Sayaam** (9): FUN FACT I had to cash transfer money to Peru via Western Union to get the edition of the album with this on it and it was worth it

**vayyiqra** (9): wtf this is awesome

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): this has potential, it‚Äôs really good just to be forgotten.

**Omgcow** (8): Better than most of the songs on the album

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): This sounds like a COAD b-side lol

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): The production is undeniably the star here. I thought PC music got their inspiration from Nudity, but it was clearly from this.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4.5): I‚Äôve listened to this tracks a few times before and I‚Äôve never quite made up my mind on it. I don‚Äôt like the way that she splits up the syllables of ‚Äúcherry bomb‚Äù (deh-lish-us cheh-ree-bomb), it puts me in mind of how Katy splits up ‚Äúteenage dream‚Äù except it doesn‚Äôt work here. Other than that this track just kind of doesn‚Äôt go anywhere, the meandering club production feels kind of sterile and the melody isn‚Äôt anything to write home about. Kylie gives a great performance but it‚Äôs wasted on a song that‚Äôs too long. I think this would have worked a lot better as a track of Britney.

**MrSwearword** (4): not that exciting and goes off more like a popped balloon

**static\_int\_husp** (4): The Runaways outsold

This song falling off the top 5 was a real shocker for me and a clear sign that taste has lost today. In the ~~arguably~~ objectively boppiest song on the album, Kylie shares with us a snapshot of the state of complete bedazzlement: she sees him. He's dancing. An immediate connection. A rush. All accelerating and unstoppable. In a very X-esque fashion, Kylie compares herself to a machine, her antennas sensing this peculiar anomaly on the dancefloor. All she intends to do with it is explore and observe - and tell us how amazing it is. You can't help but bop to this song!
 
---
 
#WOW
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (11): The single most addictive song that I know. I could listen to this song on repeat over and over again and never get tired of it. The reason that gays have limp wrists is so we‚Äôre always prepared to air-piano along with the intro of this song. It‚Äôs not the deepest song in the world, in fact all things considered it‚Äôs pretty shallow, but god-damn if it isn‚Äôt pitch perfect pop perfection. There‚Äôs just so may little touches about this song that make it good. That subtle guitar that slowly grows under the verses, the piano refrain that plays before the chorus, that weird synth that fluctuates on the ‚Äúwow‚Äù to give it additional gravity, the way that the song pulls back twice in the bridge, once just for production and again with Kylie on top, that whispered ‚Äúrush,‚Äù it‚Äôs all there and it‚Äôs all perfect. This is a song that gives and just keeps on giving until it‚Äôs over, then you press repeat and get it all back.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): D-E-S-I-R-E
 
**IaEStI** (10): amazing instrumental and nothing actively trying to keep me from liking it
 
**jamesfog** (10): WOWOWOWOW! A BANGER!
 
**Leixander** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTEros927Ow
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (10): WOW Indeed
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): that piano riff is iconic
 
**MrSwearword** (10): A REFRESHING STRAIGHT UP BANGER, THANK CHRIST
 
**rickikardashian** (10): LOVED IT SINCE THE FIRST TIME I EXPERIENCED IT. The piano at the start is straight up pop perfection. Not giving my 11 to this was HARD, because I honestly believe this has to be at least in the top 5
 
**Sayaam** (10): HER BEST SONG, the 80s post-disco tribute we deserved
 
**skargardin** (10): Wow indeed
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): wowowowow
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): wow
 
**twat\_brained** (10): I mean this is a true album standout and deserves to be the lead single but I can't decide if it sounds more like "International Smile" by Katy Perry or "Sweet Talk" by Samantha Jade. I'll say Samantha since she's a fellow Oz.
 
**whatareblackhole** (10): YES! This is so good! This is what this whole album should have been! Greg Kurstin works WONDERS for pop albums!
 
**tapdancingpig** (9.5): This had me smiling almost immediately. The ‚Äúwowowowowow‚Äù chorus is perfect
 
**RoiduLames** (9): This is high-key a summer bop! The ‚Äúyeah yeah yeahs‚Äù kinda fill the role of the ‚Äúwhoos‚Äù that I really love too
 
**technoprayers** (9): and she's back, come on miss Minogue
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (8.5): The REAL cheerleader bop, move aside GMAYL
 
**PuggleMaster** (8.5): why is this album getting good now
 
**stardustanddinos** (8.5): I love the disco vibe on this one. Why isn‚Äôt dance pop a thing these days‚Ä¶
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I'm not sure whether I like this Wow or Kate Bush's better! The robotic dance themes come back again after a series of slow songs, but they don't dip in quality; this isn't the boldest song on the album, but it's colourful and easy to bop to for sure.
 
**vayyiqra** (8): fun cute little bop
 
**evilqueenlex** (7.5): another song that sounds a little ahead of its time

we were rooting for you to make top 3, we (the rate hosts) were all rooting for you!! in my arms had a spot in the top 3 early in the rate, but now bows out in 7th place. several comments have called the song's production dated. fair enough.
 
---
 
#Calvin Harris ended on Ready For The Weekend:
 
**chipsi1** (11): okay, but, imagine disliking this. this is like seriously one of the best pop songs ever crafted, between the synths, the intimate feeling the song gives and the incredible chorus, this is absolutely a highlight.
 
**Banananaise** (10): "i'm missing you" Bitch you CAN't just say that in that VOICE
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the best thing Calvin Harris has ever done
 
**Humantrashcan** (10): In My Arms, In Your Eyes, I love this bitch and all her songs are In My Heart
 
**jamesfog** (10): Masterpiece!
 
**lady\_sable** (10): o shit this is a banger
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (10): Pure pop euphoria. Only Queen Kylie
 
**MrSwearword** (10): invented Calvin Harris; has an over the top music video; YAS GAWD, SLAY, COME ON SEASON 10, I JUST SALMONELLA GURL
 
**mudkip1uwu** (10): sister kinda snapped here!
 
**Sayaam** (10): Still one of the best things Calvin Harris has put his name to
 
**skargardin** (10): I miss mindless dance music like this, what a bop
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): Calvin Harris‚Äô production is ACE
 
**twat\_brained** (10): When it started I thought for some reason an ad had slipped through my Spotify Premium but 20 seconds into it I'm absolutely headbanging TF out to this. I'm not even done the chorus but I'm giving this a 10 no matter what else happens in the song. If this isn't top 10 I will be upset and I'm not even that partial to Kylie compared to Knee and Madge. If this is song is what being in Kylie's arms feels like I'd love to spend a few minutes in her embrace.
 
**vayyiqra** (10): omg that synth when it kicks in wtf I love X now
 
**whatareblackhole** (10): I came here hoping to hear some bops‚Ä¶and sis delivered! This is fun!
 
**fifthchevron** (9): I kind of forgot this was a Kylie song? It's really nice.
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): I see what she did there with the blue box, stream Voyage of the Damned on iPlayer
 
**rickikardashian** (9): This song makes me feel in love again. All my broken relationships have banished from my memory, all i can focus on is the feeling, that neither I or Kylie can describe. This is also a lie, considering that I have never been in a serious relationship, but for the sake of this comment let‚Äôs pretend I am.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): There‚Äôs a hint of narcissism to this track‚Ä¶ like she wants to know how it feels in her own arms? Okay girl. If I was Kylie I‚Äôd feel the same way though, and the attitude really works here. The coy way that she interrupts us with an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening‚Äù and slows everything down for a minute just to tease us‚Ä¶ power move.
 
**evilqueenlex** (8): and this sounds like 2011
 
**IaEStI** (8): the nasality jumped out, but i appreciate the energy
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This is the first song I really like on X, and it kicks off my enjoyment of the record for me. I really appreciate the video game-esque synths throughout the song, and I enjoy the fresh wave of euphoria it blesses my ears with.
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7.8): this is too overproduced, but I love it nonetheless
 
#The only song by Calvin Harris I like is My Way:
 
**RoiduLames** (5): Yeah this song really didn‚Äôt do much for me, the intro was kind of strange then the whole song just felt a little too much compared to the songs before and after it
 
**kanyewestrep** (3): Calvin Harris u done fucked up with this one
 
**Omgcow** (3): The electric keyboard or whatever it is in the background of this song hurts my ears ngl
 
**tapdancingpig** (3): The hook is boring and I don‚Äôt like the production.

#Forgive us mother for we have sinned:
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this song is honestly just kinda really badass
 
**jamesfog** (10): Madonna sweetie, I'm so sorry...
 
**lady\_sable** (10): "there's more important things than hearing you speak" is so iconic
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (10): Another kinda aggro track. Has great rhythm
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a mf bop holy shit my sides are burned
 
**MrSwearword** (10): 5TH GREATEST MADONNA SONG EVER; deserved better chart positions [even if she infamously called this and other hits of hers "retarded"]
 
**rotating3Dtext** (10): queen of languages
 
**Sayaam** (10): I always found it so funny how much the song sounded like the Scooby Doo theme song that Simple Plan did
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): Multicultural legend
 
**technoprayers** (10): the girls weren't ready for this one
 
**twat\_brained** (10): More convincing to me than Bieber ever will be. Particularly because just says it in English and Madonna says it in like 13 languages. And she's the one being apologized to! And get this:
 
**whatareblackhole** (10): WHEW, she really went off with this one! This is soooo perfectly constructed and really surges. This is a great cut for early on in the album. I‚Äôm fully invested after this one.
 
**chipsi1** (9): maybe she snapped
 
**IaEStI** (9): I don't see a reason to give it a 10
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (9): Queen of refusing to take that fuckboy's apologies that are apparently multilingual
 
**Omgcow** (9): Hung Up's slightly less hot sister
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): This is considered one of Madonna's most underrated songs for a reason. Madge has always had this unapologetic vibe to her, save for a few precious moments of tenderness, and this presents her feisty, unforgiving attitude in fully dancable glory. Justin who?
 
**QustoMar** (9): appparently this was the second single but it's like, how can u even follow up hung up? any song would be forgotten after that lmao. this album would've been a complete era if hung up was the only single to be released from this album. ANYWAY, it's nice
 
**stardustanddinos** (9): SO GOOD.
 
**tapdancingpig** (9): This one took a while to grow on me, but it‚Äôs gotten stuck in my head so many times since my first listen, I can‚Äôt really complain about it.
 
**skargardin** (8.5): Slay multilingual queen. This chorus fucking bangs.
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): I feel like this was a backup song made in case ABBA didn't clear the sample on Hung Up, and when they did Madonna decided why not just put both on her album
 
**mudkip1uwu** (8): ok but why is every song on this album like an hour long
 
**vayyiqra** (8): okay her dutch accent is slightly off literally unlistenable no jk this bops
 
**popiquin** (7.7): Another classic, the multi-language parts are kind of jarring but luckily don't take up a significant portion of the song and the rest is just pure bliss.
 
**RoiduLames** (7): She was cute, the intro of the song was really nice and I love a good fade in, also the song had a nice message
 
#We also had a 1 but that binch preferred not to voice ha opinion - understandable:
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (5): It‚Äôs a fun song but like‚Ä¶ I get bored of it halfway through. It‚Äôs kind of just the same two minutes, twice? It would have made a fierce interlude.

this song has been the subject of countless thinkpieces, but i will not be writing one in this comment. some of you did though!
 
---
 
#I'd take you whole queen
 
**IaEStI** (11): tells a story, timeless, her best song ever imo
 
**lady\_sable** (11): two songs in and i'm already trembling at the sheer power of britney saying "fuck you" to the media that made her life miserable
 
**rickikardashian** (11): Just with the first 5 seconds of this song playing, I begin to thottify. I turn into a new me. I stop being Ricki, and just become a raising pop star in the mid-2000‚Äôs, that can‚Äôt even go clubbing with her slightly problematic friends without being harassed by paparazzi and vilified by the media. The power this song has is too strong.
 
**fifthchevron** (10): She didn't write a word of it, but it's still so uniquely Britney. How they do that? Literally no one else could've sung this song. A lot has been made of her unusual enunciation over the years and I feel like this song was written with that in mind, so many odd words and strange alliterations. This is everything LWYMMD wishes it was. Also note the double meaning of "You want a piece of me" - a statement and a threat.
 
**Humantrashcan** (10): I Cant listen to this song without risk of me walking around the nearby premises pretending to break everything in sight with an imaginary bat.
 
**jamesfog** (10): Iconic and ended paparazzi
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): https://imgur.com/a/WEGFT3u
 
**MrSwearword** (10): living for this song and its controversial win at the VMAs for Video of the Year [I think; I just know people thought Brit was so overdue for another video]
 
**QustoMar** (10): this is really a contender for my fave song off of blackout, esp bc it's my most listened to song on last fm. britney telling off the entire media, Robyn singing a lil, the music video where she wears a fur vest with a bra and jean shorts, again what an era like gimme more with so many moments. i love this song sm, i can have it on repeat for hours and just live my little gay life as britney, sings, or really, talks about going to the philippines
 
**RoiduLames** (10): This song is perfect single material, then the chains in the back, the vocal effects, the lyrics ugh! Everything about this song is so iconic
 
**saucymac** (10): ICONIC
 
**skargardin** (10): Queen of GTA
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): AH AH, OH YEAH
 
**tevinterimperium** (10): In high school, my friends and I made a parody of this song called "Sample Mean" for our statistics class.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i dont know what those bawking sound effects are supposed to be (are they chickens??? idk) nonetheless they are iconic
 
**twat\_brained** (10): I wantED a Piece of Me ticket to see Britney in Vegas but I failed to capiytalize on that opportunity when I had the chamce so I have nobody to blame but myself. At least I saw a killer rendition of this on the Circus Tour.
 
**whatareblackhole** (10): An iconic song! How can you not love this? The attitude, the delivery, the beat ‚Äì everything is so perfectly aligned.
 
**tapdancingpig** (9.5): Fucking iconic bop. Great production and really fun, self aware writing.
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (9.2): Listening to this track, you'd never guess that Britney shaved her headand attacked the paparazzi with an umbrella. She sings like the only thing they can do toher is waste her time.
 
**chipsi1** (9): me to the one person who gives In My Arms less than an 8
 
**Leixander** (9): *Pictures of my derrier√© in the magazines.*
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (9): I love the synth work on this track! And I see you Robyn, making most of the character on this song
 
**mudkip1uwu** (9): i love selena gomez
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): So, yeah, the chicken noise is kind of bad, but I love everything else about this. It's the musical personification of the phase 'she snapped!', to put it lightly. The lyrics are Britney's among most iconic ones, and I can deny that I geeked out when she mentioned the Philippines. We can't even protect Britney. What good is this country for?
 
**rotating3Dtext** (9): the production is really... idiosyncratic
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): This album is 2 for 2 on bops so far. Also the lyrics are pretty thoughtful, and more than I expected of Britney
 
**technoprayers** (9): Drag the media Britney, drag the girls and scalp them
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): Robyn saves this tbh
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (8): Okay I always jam out to this song and I love how it's just one big giant middle finger to the media, but the excessive autotune has always been a little distracting to me idk.
 
**vayyiqra** (8): "lol dated EDM production smh" no jk this is great clap back at the haters etc
 
#I'm not really into vore:
 
**stardustanddinos** (7.5): kind of a let-down after gimme more, but it would bang in a club for sure
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Yes I know that this is a powerful depiction of Britney‚Äôs situation at the time and as a cultural artifact I think it‚Äôs fantastic, but as a song? It‚Äôs kind of underwhelming. I get what she‚Äôs going for with the dead, autotuned vocals stumbling around on the lethargic track reflecting the reality of the subject matter but like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not very fun to listen to. If you had no clue who Britney was this track would just feel confusing.

**MrSwearword** (10): getting my jush

**whatareblackhole** (9): This is LEAGUES better than some of the songs on the actual album‚Ä¶

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): is this a bisexual song??

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Easily my favorite bonus track so far.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Oh I like this, this track is a lot of fun. Usually bonus tracks or Japanese exclusives can feel a bit like throwaways, but this feels like a fully formed track that would easily have been a hit on the album proper. There‚Äôs a nice sense of energy and forward motion to it, I like the way that the chorus just kind of explodes out of the verses. Also, bisexual anthem?

**MeanToBeIconic** (8): A funk line with hard synths. Love it

**vayyiqra** (8): this is weird and i'm not sure what it's about but i like it

DANJA DANJA. shoutout to kanyewestrep, a dedicated danja stan who gave high scores to every track produced by him. there is a pretty significant score difference between britney's official bonus songs and her unreleased material. kylie's bonus songs were much less controversial but she was no match for this hoe anthem. get back is the official winner of the bonus rate, and a worthy winner imo. congrats miss britney! 

---

#Get back in the studio with Danja please:

**fifthchevron** (10): Just relentless, could've ended several careers if released properly.

**MeanToBeIconic** (10): a BANGER this was supposed to be the lead and even though this is perfect thank god

**MrSwearword** (10): I'm getting my jush to this too

**Omgcow** (10): Iconic, should've been on the main album

**RomanOrgy69** (10): This also belonged on the album.

**Sayaam** (10): the demented video game sounds were ahead of their time

**tevinterimperium** (10): Should have replaced Heaven On Earth on the album!!!

**survivorjdmarina** (8): It‚Äôs cool I guess

**tapdancingpig** (8): Apparently, this could have been the lead single instead of Gimme More, and that makes a lot of sense. They‚Äôre pretty similar songs (same repetitive type of hook, Danja‚Äôs intro/outro, similar stripper vibe). I definitely prefer Gimme More, but this is a really interesting ‚Äúwhat if,‚Äù and a pretty good song.

**vayyiqra** (8): wtf this could have been a huge dancefloor jam back in the day

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): FINALLY something fun in brit's bonuses

**kanyewestrep** (7): production handled by DANJAHANDZ

**whatareblackhole** (7): I kinda like the ending but altogether this is just fine

#Get outta here:

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): Britney is just kind of writing checks she can‚Äôt cash here. She‚Äôs trying to posit herself as the fierce goddess of the club but this is maybe the most checked out I‚Äôve heard her in any track in the rate. The track is also kind of all over the place, it really feels like they had a scrap of a song there (the unimpressive to annoying chorus) and tried to stretch it out over three and a half minutes by screwing around with GarageBand effects but it just doesn‚Äôt work. The song literally breaks down towards the end, which was maybe a stylistic choice, but one that came across poorly.

I am shook. The One being in top 4 is by far the biggest surprise of this rate, considering that this version of the song was never released as a single and how single-heavy this top 10 (or any top 10 here) is. What is also surprising is how the average score for this song exceeded 9.0 for more than half of the score submission period, quickly becoming the highest rated Kylie song in the rate. I have to admit - I didn't love The One when I listened to X for the first time. With each listen, I began to understand its greatness. The One feels like a sequel to Can't Get You Out Of My Head. What used to be an obsession, became a spell, a cosmic blessing, its force imploding and focusing on Kylie; she's the chosen one, the one to love, the Aphrodite of the future lost in space. *Can you hear her? She's connecting with you. Will you reach her?*

#YAS:
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (11): a glimmering piece of shiny synthpop perfection. perfectly encapsulates a Kylie song - full of passion and love wrapped up with a great hook. the bridge is magnificent, and the whole thing is just THAT girl! it truly is The One
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): "'I'm the One-- love me love me love me,' she sings, and for these four minutes she is and we do."
 
**jamesfog** (10): Another anthem.
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (10): This was SO close to my 11 it's THAT good
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this should be in the Top 10
 
**QustoMar** (10): i love this song and it's probably one of the few X songs im gonna revisit after this rate oop
 
**Sayaam** (10): A DISCOGRAPHY HIGHLIGHT
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): Absolutely adorable. Pure pop perfection.
 
**technoprayers** (10): an addictive track, I really enjoy this song and see myself bopping to it
 
**whatareblackhole** (10): Okay, Miss Kylie, I see you! Keep the receipt! I‚Äôm buyin‚Äô it!
 
**fifthchevron** (9): Flawless, please watch the video for Kylie serving modern day Marilyn Monroe iconography.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Here Kylie places herself at the center of a swirling galaxy. It‚Äôs brilliant the way that this track builds, starting off with that simple pulse before there‚Äôs a sonic ‚Äúbig bang‚Äù and elements start introducing themselves to the song one by one and building upon each other until the end of the song where Kylie has placed herself at the center of a swirling galaxy of music. It‚Äôs a tall order to call yourself ‚Äúthe one‚Äù without coming off as arrogant or overambitious, and there‚Äôs few artists I can think of that pull it off like Kylie can. There‚Äôs a benevolence to the way that she phrases it that makes you want to agree with her, she states it so calmly and beautifully that you‚Äôre naturally drawn to believe it. I was familiar with the Freemasons Mix long before I listened to the album in full and I do think that it‚Äôs better than the album version, but I still think that the album version offers up its own unique experience. It‚Äôs a lot slower and almost messier, and I think the way the music kind of sprawls is a neat effect for a track like this.
 
**IaEStI** (9): great in all aspects
 
**RoiduLames** (9): This is honestly such a great track, its incredibly smooth and the chorus is simply beautiful!
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): Ok now we‚Äôre picking up again!
 
**vayyiqra** (9): kylie minogue, pint-sized powerhouse, serving up one banger after another on this critically acclaimed nu-disco record from 2007
 
**twat\_brained** (8.9): This song is definitely one. It is A one, but it is not THE one. As far as I can tell, THE one is also number one. It's got day 3 potential for sure, so I'm looking forward to seeing how it does.
 
**MrSwearword** (8): it's fine but nothing exceptional.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I'm a bit more divided on the production elements than most other people here-they don't sound super polished to me-but I do agree that this song is a pretty decent experience. It's classic diva Kylie with futuristic production and it proves that this album still has something to offer as it drifts into its second half.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): emotion side b shook
 
#An evil queen indeed:

Well... My opinion on this song could easily be considered a hot take and I don't blame you at all for that (I'm looking at you, 11 11s), so I will try to explain it so y'all don't eat me alive. I think I *used* to love *Break the Ice*. I definitely remember loving the cartoon music video as a kid, but the more I listened to the actual song for the rate, the more skippable it seemed to me. Sure, the crunk-inspired beat and the breathy vocals are cool, but I never feel like the song goes anywhere. It's the same issue I have with Madonna's 4 Minutes - sure, the beat's fine. Shame it's always the same. Also I had to give it a -1 point for that *awful* Mario/Dumb and Dumber/whatever the fuck noise in the breakdown... Whew. ~~also i might be a little salty bc of how close this is to the one, damn you 11 11s~~
 
---
#So hot we'll melt your popsicle:
 
**evilqueenlex** (11): BITCHHHHH
 
**fifthchevron** (11): The best song she's ever done. Cinematic, epic, operatic, theatrical, showstopping etc etc. This is proof that musically she was still peak Britney. A testament to her professionalism that she delivered the perfect pop song when her life was falling apart. TALENT WON. The instrumental is also worth listening to for how beautiful the breakdown music is
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (11): This is the absolute moment of pop perfection in Britney's career like holy fuck her baby voice manages to work so well here, the production is fricking TIGHT, and this makes me just wanna find an unrequited crush and recreate this song.
 
**Leixander** (11): This is probably the most mature song she released, I remember trying to download Toxic as a pirate when I was a kid and accidentally downloading this one and thinking that THIS was Toxic for the longest time. Anyways it is way better than Toxic.
 
**MNREDR** (11): See you guys at #1!
 
**Omgcow** (11): The peak of her discography
 
**PuggleMaster** (11): I love everything about this magnificent bop!
 
**skargardin** (11): I had like 5 songs I wanted to give an 11 this was excruciatingly hard but I'll be damned if this is not one of the biggest bops ever.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): it's been a while
 
**twat\_brained** (11): I was never big on this when it was released, most likely because it never got any radio play, nor did it chart well (in fact I forget if it even charted). Years later, I realize this song is fucking it and is my favorite from Blackout. And you can't listen to Britney's breaths on the chorus and NOT be reminded of "I'm a Slave 4 U".
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): if a knee song wins it better be this one
 
**Humantrashcan** (10): You know that Oprah quote "She is ... the mother I never had. She is ... the sister everybody would want. She is the friend that everybody deserves" That is this song
 
**jamesfog** (10): Keri Hilson snapped
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (10): I LIKE THIS PART TOO BRIT ;)
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this could also easily have been the lead single
 
**MrSwearword** (10): The VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown is the only promo this song/video ever got before its slight kind of cancellation as the 3rd single.
 
**mudkip1uwu** (10): pop perfection
 
**QustoMar** (10): THE song off blackout, it's that bich. i feel like it fully personifies the futuristic, femme fatalle, badass, parts of this album, and it should be as well known as toxic to the general public, or at least smth like work bitch. there r so many little partsd of this song that really elevate it, there is the intro where again like gimme more, she addresses the listener that this is her comeback, the little woobly in the second verse after she says hypnotized, when she says that the song feels good like in gimme more, her mind, ugh
 
**RomanOrgy69** (10): Britney's most underrated bop!
 
**rotating3Dtext** (10): it sounds badass??
 
**Sayaam** (10): Close second to Gimme More
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): How did this single not take off? Pure poptronica perfection.
 
**teenage\_meme** (10): the only thing wrong with this song is that the concept is totally implausible. it seems to be about a guy having trouble getting a boner for britney, but even i, an asexual woman, would have no issue with that.
 
**whatareblackhole** (10): Probably my favorite Brinty song EVER. So amazing.
 
**lady\_sable** (9.5): invented anime
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Even Blackout haters seem to appreciate this one, don't they? I've really been underrating this-aside from the music video inventing anime, the title of the song fits perfectly. Britney's vocals are more delicate than we expect them to be here, but that fragility is easily shattered by how much of a bop is this.
 
**technoprayers** (9): The music video makes me love the song even more
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.6): the crescendolls are shook
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): It‚Äôs a nice electro-pop bop. I stan
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I like this song but, at the risk of blasphemy, the more I listen to it the less I hear Britney in it? Keri Hilson was a songwriter and is credited for backup vocals and you can hear her pretty clearly throughout the song. It‚Äôs especially noticeable towards the end when Britney is doing ad libs over the chorus, it‚Äôs pretty clear that it‚Äôs not the same person.
 
**RoiduLames** (8): The production throughout this album is, like, my kink but, like, the weird Mario dying sounds in the last parts of the song really turns me off
 
**vayyiqra** (8): the intro to this is so gd creepy but then the synth kicks in and it goes off also literally invented 808 = heart analogies
 
#Fine, fresh, fierce:
 
**letsallpoo** (4): this song is so overrated. its an average bop for two minutes then just devolves into ambient noise
 
#A 6 nonetheless:
 
**kanyewestrep** (6): production handled by DANJAHANDZ, also i forgot Jim Beanz lol, that's my guy

Say what you want about *Gimme More*, this song never fails to make me feel like an absolute slut. The bouncy bass, the creepy beat, the iconic intro, how the hell could this song not make it to top 3? And what truly makes this song stand out is its double meaning - sure, it can be a hoe anthem, but is it really? The context dramatically changes the tone of the song, making it more personal, focusing on Britney's struggle with fame and how the tabloid culture destroyed her privacy. What really surprised me was the fact that it never made it to #1; frankly, my initial prediction was that the situation would be the opposite, Hung Up would fail and *Gimme More* would thrive. You can say that I'm pleasantly surprised. u/sh-ether is not, don't @ ha tho
 
---
#As the title says:
 
**GlialUreterostenosis** (11): queen of the SID II, Rob Hubbard is shook, Tim Follin's wig confirmedmissing
 
**hikkaru** (11): This is just... so iconic. The opening line. The double entendre that makes the song both a hoe bop and depressing song about Britney's personal struggles. Danja's immaculate production. Every time this comes on I immediately want to slut drop to the floor.
 
**Joebiekong** (11): It‚Äôs Britney Bitch.
 
**RoiduLames** (11): I mean how could you not give the track that birthed the iconic ‚ÄúIts Britney Bitch‚Äù phrase the 11?
 
**Sayaam** (11): Literally her best song and also the best song ever made
 
**auxjuan** (10): Easily one of the best opening tracks ever. What a bop.
 
**evilqueenlex** (10): bitch if I could give this an eleven I would
 
**fifthchevron** (10): A 2007 reviewer stated the song was great but Britney is in "sex kitten auto pilot mode" which...angered me lol. The instrumental is actually threadbare - the character and edge comes purely from Britney's vocal performance. The way she darts between being seductive in the moment and commentating on how observed/critiqued her every movement is. The chorus is genius, just a slight build in tension and the climax/drop leads directly into the next verse, so the momentum never stops building. The bridge almost levels out until Britney explodes with "Ow!" then she just vocally gliiiiides through the extended outro. Danja knew exactly who he was dealing with and it shows, not only in how he openly praises her, but how he lets her vocal be the star here. "Bet you didn't see this one coming" is an understatement. We were all resigned to the "fact" that her career was over, then she hit us with one of her greatest hits ever. Legends only.
 
**Humantrashcan** (10): This song personally came up and limped my 10 year old hand, turning me gay for all time.
 
**IaEStI** (10): it's britney, bitch
 
**jamesfog** (10): The legendary Miss Britney Spears.
 
**lady\_sable** (10): "it's britney bitch" may just be the most iconic phrase in all of history
 
**Leixander** (10): Leave Britney alone, now!
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (10): What else to say? It's Britney bitch followed by four beats MEANT for stomping in stillettoes. Iconic from impact
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this should be in the fucking top 10 or I riot
 
**MrSwearword** (10): proof that Britney could overcome anything and got a no. 3 on the Hot 100 out of this. Slay.
 
**Omgcow** (10): Is this the single most iconic intro to a pop song in history? Yes
 
**QustoMar** (10): there r so many reasons why this is an absolutely amazing song. beyond the ICONIQUE opening that still has not been topped, and probably never will be bc of the context and build up to the album release, there is, britney's star vocals, danja telling the listener how they didn't expect this, etc. and ofc, the breathtaking MTV performance, the music video where britney steps around a stripper pole a lil, and if britney got her way, the music video would have actually been her black hair self, shooting blonde britney, but sadly that didn't come to fruition. but anyway, gimme more pls
 
**Raaaaat** (10): the holy slut bop
 
**rickikardashian** (10): ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS BRITNEY BITCH‚Äù The one-liner made everyone tremble as the final moments of life as we know it came to an end. The figure of a goddess wearing stripper heels, with her flowy blonde hair rose from the ground, ready to take us all. She put us all, The Gays‚Ñ¢ in her hand, and started flying, as we saw how the earth shattered to dust. We didn‚Äôt have a clue where she was taking us, but wherever it was, we felt safe with our new savior, Britney Bitch.
 
**RomanOrgy69** (10): This album came out when I was like 7 or 8. I used to actually strip to this song when it came out. The most iconic stripper bop of all time!
 
**skargardin** (10): Quintessential Britney
 
**stardustanddinos** (10): it‚Äôs what she deserves. The pulsating production, Britney‚Äôs sultry vocals. All amazing.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): Iconic, skinny, we love her.
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): The best stripper song. Starts the album off with a (possibly literal) bang.
 
**technoprayers** (10): Danja snapped on this track, queen of the slut drop
 
**teenage\_meme** (10): this isn't a word i throw around but.... iconic.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): name a more iconic opening line, i'll wait
 
**twat\_brained** (10): WHO IS IT?!?!
 
**whatareblackhole** (10): YES. BITCH. WORK. This song made me gay.
 
**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): yeeesss
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): "It's Britney bitch" is probably the most iconic opening line to an album of all time.
 
**chipsi1** (9): a classique
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Britney bitch‚Äù intro is obviously iconic, but I think it‚Äôs those weird distorted vocals that sing ‚Äúmore‚Äù that really steal the show.
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (9): Can you think of a more perfect intro to Miss Spears' comeback than "It's Britney bitch"?
 
**PuggleMaster** (9): iconic bop
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): In a funny way, this is the perfect start to Blackout. It's dark, messy, and iconic from start to finish-everything that represents this era in a nutshell. I'm not as big of a fan of this as some Britney fans are, but I can still gladly appreciate the fact that it'll forever be the theme song of one of the most troublesome parts of her life.
 
**kanyewestrep** (8): production handled by DANJAHANDZ
 
**vayyiqra** (8): give her more what exactly jk this is an iconic bop and still goes off today even if it could go harder also that melody is straight up creepy
 
#That's enough:

[Well, there it is.](https://i.imgur.com/RG0BS1U.gif) The anthem. THE Mid 2000s Dancepop Comeback. *Hung Up* is arguably Madonna's signature song, especially for the generations that haven't been around for her reign over 80s and 90s pop charts. Its heavy, throbbing bassline, juicy synths and the iconic Abba sample keep your feet tapping and your arms egg-beating for the whole 5 and a half minutes (!) of the song and it doesn't feel like it at all. What also needs to be appreciated is how Madonna succeeded to beat the competition in the time of dumb ringtone pop (remember Crazy Frog?), R&B-focused sound and the emerging digital market while being 47 at the time. There's no denying that *Hung Up* was a well deserved worldwide smash hit and I'm glad it's a smash hit over here at r/popheads as well. Taste is safe again.
 
---
i love pop music:
 
**Humantrashcan** (11): I am A Kylie STAN but I also have ears. I prefer Get Together but I also know the difference between best and favorite.
 
**jamesfog** (11): Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it - this song is all those things.
 
**MrSwearword** (11): MADONNA'S. BEST. SONG. EVER
 
**QustoMar** (11): i was gonna give my 11 to a blackout song but there is no way you can't give it to Hung Up. it's a pop culture icon, anyone who could hear and remember a song between 2005-2008 would know Hung Up, it's on the level of some renaissance paintings like hello, it's hung up. it's also Madonna's truly final single that went big and just destroyed the world, and if any of her songs should be the final mark of her's on the general public, it deserves to be Hung Up. in her career that spans almost 40 years, this song which was also released in her 40s haha, is that bitch. it's also just very beautiful, and uses that masterful ABBA sample
 
**rotating3Dtext** (11): what can I say!! perfect
 
**saucymac** (11): As an Aussie, my 11 SHOULD go to Kylie, but this is the shit Kyle should have been releasing.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (11): Would It be wrong to say this is my favorite Madonna song ever? Everything from the legendary ABBA sample to the iconic chrous and great beat make this my favorite dance pop bop.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (11): THAT FUCKING ABBA SAMPLE
 
**vayyiqra** (11): is this the most genius use of a sample ever? is this the perfect dance-pop song? or is my skinny otter ass just bopping to it? the answer is yes, yes it is
 
**auxjuan** (10): Just like Gimme More, this is an excellent opening track.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): invented sampling and ABBA
 
**evilqueenlex** (10): oh girl c‚Äômon
 
**fifthchevron** (10): I'm glad my generation got at least one truly iconic Madonna moment. This was EVERYWHERE, one of those rare "legend snapped" moments where it's like the whole world is singing the same song. Even now, put on this video and everyone stops to watch.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of the best tracks in the rate, hands down. I have this weird sort of relationship with Madonna where I really respect her and everything she‚Äôs accomplished in her career, and I accept her as one of the undisputed queens of pop music, but I‚Äôve never quite gotten the hype behind her music. She‚Äôs had a tremendous impact on the world of music and the drawback to this is that everything she‚Äôs created or done I‚Äôve heard someone else do, and I‚Äôve liked them doing it more. That said, this is one of the few Madonna tracks that really sticks out to me. I completely get the hype around this track, it‚Äôs absolutely fabulous. This song is so carefully choreographed, every single beat and note is meticulously placed to create this fantastic sense of tight forward motion. The galloping ‚ÄúGimme Gimme Gimme‚Äù sample (which has always felt very cowboy western to me) swirls and propels her forward, but at the peak of the wave she pauses for a second building this wonderful sense of anticipation as the music swells behind her and she crashes into the chorus. A thrilling pop song that absolutely deserves the success it‚Äôs found.
 
**hikkaru** (10): I'm a fetus that previously thought music was invented by Britney in 2007, so I'm not super familiar with anything from before that, but this S L A P S. Didn't think anything could contest Gimme More for my 11 but this comes incredibly close.
 
**IaEStI** (10): the bridge is kinda weak but the rest of the song is so great that it doesn't matter...ABBA is shook
 
**Itsafudgingstick** (10): I'm convinced Madonna exists partially to revive disco every now and again. And she pulled it off PERFECTLY here. Normally in a song this long I feel like it drags on somewhere around the 3-4 minute mark, but the entire time I just felt like getting up and dancing.
 
**lady\_sable** (10): the part after the intro where the beat kicks in > the beatles' entire discography
 
**Leixander** (10): time goes by... so fast
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (10): INCREDIBLE display of understanding of where the album was going to be as a whole aesthetic. Anchors the WHOLE period
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i wish there‚Äôs one more song that would come out in the same magnitude as this before I die
 
**Omgcow** (10): I remember this was the first Madonna song I was ever really aware of, I used to bop to it whenever it played on VH1 Jumpstart while I was getting ready for school
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (10): I can give my love to Britney and Kylie, but I'd only hesitate for a second or two before I'd call this the best song in the rate. Despite the long running length, every second of Hung Up is filled with iconic beats and production-from the ABBA song, to Madonna calling back to a deep cut on Like A Prayer, to the iconic bridge, to just how simply pissed off yet elegant she sounds, it's hard to imagine this not winning the rate or ending up in second place.
 
**perfumevee** (10): Best possible use of an ABBA sample!
 
**popiquin** (10): Pop excellence, no more no less. The ABBA sample is everything plus Madonna is the queen of clock sound effects. Zedd is shaking in his boots.
 
**skargardin** (10): Legendary bop, queen of sampling legends
 
**stardustanddinos** (10): Damn, what a bombastic song. This is the kind of disco-pop renewal I want to see happen again. The ABBA sample, Madonna‚Äôs vocals and the production ‚Äì all immaculate. I don‚Äôt know what more to say except pop perfection.
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): I love Gimme Gimme Gimme a Man After Midnight, so I was jamming almost immediately. I think I like Gimme x3 a little more, but it‚Äôs got a killer hook and uses the hell out of that sample.
 
**technoprayers** (10): The ABBA sample is genius, Madge snapped omg
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): mamma mia
 
**twat\_brained** (10): The first time I heard Gimme Gimme Gimme was when I played it on Just Dance so I was surprised to learn Madonna basically built her entire song around this one riff, but goddamn did she ever pull it off and reinvent the fuck out of her image. I remember her performing this on her S+S Tour supported by a backdrop of a chess game. I just wish I remember how it sounded.
 
**whatareblackhole** (10): This is obvious. I don‚Äôt even feel a need to explain myself. You all already KNOW.
 
**Banananaise** (9): she is NOT singing "waiting for your call"... she is saying something ELSE
 
**Sayaam** (9): The ABBA sample was nothing short of godly
 
**teenage\_meme** (9): invented tick-tock sounds, zedd who

time goes by so slowly:
 ---

**PuggleMaster** (8): The song was good but i took off some points for overstaying it's welcome
 
**RoiduLames** (8): I can see why this was such a big hit, it has a really cute clock sound effect too
 
**shether** (5): abba outsold. it‚Äôs a decent enough song but doesn‚Äôt live up to all the breathless hype it gets. would hung up be memorable without the sample? I strongly doubt it. anyway brb deleting my reddit account before I get yelled at for this score

# X

---

**Overall average**: 7.443

---

**TragicKingdom1**: This album was pretty much exactly what I expected. It has some bops but is held down a little bit by the dated 2000s electropop production. Not a bad listening experience whatsoever but it did kind of blend together outside of a few songs (Sensitized and The One.) Also I'm kinda annoyed by how many versions of the album there are because I'm not sure what I should include in my album average lol [Grade: B]

**MrSwearword**: If you can excuse the jarring tonal shifts, there are definite bangers in here.

**chipsi1**: not one of my favorite Kylie albums. it has some great cuts and probably contains my least favorite Kylie song.

**Sayaam**: SORELY UNDERAPPRECIATED

**IaEStI**: a lot of the album didn't feel up to snuff and her style doesn't resonate with me as well as the others, but by no means terrible...C (7.2)

**QustoMar**: im bionic take it supersonic

**teenage\_meme**: this was my first time listening to this album, and i'm sad it hasn't been in my life all this time! i rated it, on average, higher than blackout, which is an album i have a huge emotional connection to. it's exactly my style of music: a perfect blend of pure pop and PC music weirdness. i feel like it was made for me, no joke. i absolutely adore it, aside from a couple outlier tracks that i can pretend don't exist. THANK YOU popheads for introducing me to one of my new very favourite albums. i can't say how much i love it!

**RoiduLames**: The only album in this rate with with actually good artwork

**survivorjdmarina**: There are definitely consistency problems with this album, but it‚Äôs still a fun dance-pop record.

**vayyiqra**: badass bitch i'm rated X i'm gifted ain't gotta sell sex

**MNREDR**: A near-perfect pop album sprinkled with a couple of weird songs. Props to Kylie for experimenting, even if it didn't work out. I'm well on my way from fan to stan!

**Banananaise**: you have to respect the really consistent sonic theming through this album even though that theme is the reason it's not really my favourite Kylie album

**whatareblackhole**: This was my first Kylie Minogue album (I think) and I was really surprised at how much I liked it! Unlike Blackout, X really delivered in its latter half and faltered in its first half. ‚Äú2 Hearts‚Äù and ‚ÄúLike A Drug‚Äù are not super convincing opening tracks, but once ‚ÄúIn My Arms‚Äù arrives, Kylie hits her stride. Out of the three albums, Kylie‚Äôs comeback story is the most impressive and admirable, and I think she should be proud of this as her official comeback. X doesn‚Äôt necessarily try to have the sex appeal of Blackout or the nostalgia of Confessions‚Ä¶, but it has an appreciation for dancing, living, and light-hearted love. X stole my heart.

**evilqueenlex**: Kylie deserves more love and respect okay but most of this album ain‚Äôt it

**Raaaaat**: you got your wow wow wow wow kylie

**RomanOrgy69**: This was my first time listening to this album. I had high hopes for it, as I‚Äôve heard a lot of good things about Kylie. I‚Äôm a bit disappointed. It was a good album, but it was also kind of plain and didn‚Äôt have a lot of highs.

**tapdancingpig**: Oh boy. I do not like this album. It has a lot of really great tracks, but it‚Äôs wildly inconsistent. I‚Äôm glad it made me sit down and actually listen to Kylie Minogue, however. She‚Äôs awesome, even when this album really isn‚Äôt.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: this album title had ed sheeran shook

**rickikardashian**: This album is just extremely atmospheric. Its production completely embraces you completely and sumerges you in the sound. This is easily the best album out of the 3, and I fucking adore Blackout. A whole masterpiece

**patronsaintofaspies**: I've listened to Kylie's first three albums before this, and while I really enjoyed Rhythm of Love, I really wasn't motivated enough to go through the rest of her discography...which is why I see this rate was a blessing in disguise. I think X is pretty flawed, but it's still innovative enough for me to appreciate it and encourage me to explore more of her music.

awryj: # Blackout

---

**Overall average**: 7.985

---

**TragicKingdom1**: Oh boy, hot take time. This is not a good album, and it only barely escapes the bottom 10 of every project we've ever rated. I find the throbbing electropop sound to be incredibly grating, and absolutely ruins any effort put into the songwriting. So many of the songs are just pure annoyance that I can't really bop to. I understand the appeal because it is icy and kind of a cool aesthetic, but for me personally it doesn't translate into particularly listenable music outside of a handful of songs. Also, I feel like we should talk about Britney here. I'll tread lightly because I'm aware of her personal problems at the time, but for an album that coined the term "it's Britney bitch," Britney does not really feel like that bitch‚Ñ¢. This is definitely not an album for me, but being the precursor to the pop boom of 2009-2012, I can somewhat appreciate its appeal and merit. [Grade: C-]

**MrSwearword**: FINALLY, a Britney album that isn't total horseshit.

**IaEStI**: while lacking the sophistication of the better moments of Confessions, I personally think the album holds up better than the other two overall...A (9.2)

**QustoMar**: my bussy says gimme more too

**teenage\_meme**: my favourite album by my favourite artist. a lot of people say it's the start of "robo-britney," but i'd say despite the auto-tune (which is used to perfection) it's one of her albums with the most personality. it's bold and brash and experimental, and, especially when considering the rest of her music up to this, it's WEIRD. and britney's at her best when she's weird. you can tell she's having fun, and that makes it fun to listen to. it's a blast.

**survivorjdmarina**: This album is good, even amazing at some points, but overall I didn‚Äôt really get anything out of my first listen. I get why some popheads love it so much, but I think I need to get used to it a bit more.

**vayyiqra**: its britney bitch

**MNREDR**: Britney at her slutty, boppy best. Much respect to Danja for producing the best songs this exceptional album.

**Banananaise**: i think i finally have to give up and admit i just don't get Britney's music

**whatareblackhole**: Britney, to me, will always be a singles artist, but I think this is a really formative album for her career. This is one of the only Britney albums I can think of that sticks to a theme and tries its best to commit to a persona. Britney is the femme fatale (no pun intended) with full force on Blackout, and although I wouldn‚Äôt label it an artistic triumph, it delivers some quintessential Britney attitude with some classic mid-2000s production. Overall, I enjoyed the front half of Blackout more than the latter half ‚Äì a common trait when it comes to Britney albums ‚Äì but the whole album is a fun swing around the stripper pole.

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: daddysgirl666 actually made me listen to this album as much as I hate to admit it. Getting that out of the way, I totally understood why Britney fans want a Blackout 2.0. This is a fan favourite as well as mine.

**evilqueenlex**: This album is big slut energy and I love it

**Raaaaat**: Get Popheads (I've Got Bops)

**tapdancingpig**: This one is definitely in my top 5 albums ever, so I hope you don‚Äôt have a cap on how many 10s I can give out.

**twat\_brained**: I know Glory is 1/3 of the Holy Britnity but I have to make sure this and ITZ hold up as the other two.

**patronsaintofaspies**: It's Britney's most-loved album, that's for sure; the thing is, I always felt like this and In The Zone were weaker, if more innovative albums than Oops!, Britney, and possibly Circus. I still don't think every track on Blackout is perfect, but this rate made me appreciate it for the first time; it's the most direct ancestor to PC Music in this rate and despite what a dark period this was in Britney's life, it's impressive that she managed to crank out a pretty iconic album.

# Confessions on a Dance Floor

---

**Overall average**: 7.639

---

**TragicKingdom1**: This was much more ambient than I expected. The whole listening experience is kind of like a big rave (or at least what I imagine a rave being like.) It starts out really strong and fun, but as it goes on everything kind of blends together and it becomes less fun. There's a lot of downward momentum here, with no real climax after the first 3 songs. The production does age fairly well but could be so much more if it aimed for a boppier sound. Overall this isn't much of an improvement over Ray Of Light, even though the potential for making an updated version of her 80s sound was definitely in the cards. [Grade: B]

**MrSwearword**: this is easily one of the most cohesive albums ever made. Even the blase tracks on here are just so immaculately positioned and made. YAS GAWD

**IaEStI**: the instrumentals on this album are spectacular, but the songs as a whole can feel very samey or like textbook filler...it still has many amazing highlights...B (8.3)

**QustoMar**: can madonna release another album, it's been 13 years (also listen to the 1 track version of this album on spotify where every song is connected)

**teenage\_meme**: this album came out when i was 14, and i bought the CD because i loved hung up. i remember being very bored by it, and never listening to the full thing. in fact, i have a memory of turning it off after hearing "other cities make me feel like a dork." now i'm older and can appreciate it, and while it was my least favourite of the three, there is some great production happening here. i'm not a fan of strings, and this album used them pretty heavily -- i think if some of those were taken out, this would be a solid 8 for me. or at least a 7.5. it was very same-y for me, which can be grating even when the same is generally awesome.

**survivorjdmarina**: It‚Äôs a good disco album! It drags on a bit in the end, but it‚Äôs very consistent imo.

**vayyiqra**: hey uh, come on, ma-don-na

**MNREDR**: This album took the longest to grow on me, and I'm still not all the way sold. The ABBA and Donna Summer samples are masterfully used, but everything past the fourth track blended together to me.

**whatareblackhole**: I was most excited for this album, and I was not disappointed. Madonna truly delivered the comeback of all comebacks with Confessions and she takes top prize for me in this rate. Every reference, every homage, every detail in this album is carefully picked and placed. This was the album that kicked off the third decade of Madonna‚Äôs career and, when listening to it, it is easy to see why she has had such staying power. This is a labor of love from Madonna to the dancefloors that boosted her career and the personal triumphs that have carried her to her throne as the queen of pop. Her competitors put up a good fight in this rate, but Madonna showed them both the bravado of her legacy, especially with album standout ‚ÄúGet Together.‚Äù This is a quintessential album for anyone wanting to dive into dancepop‚Äôs history, especially because all of the production still sounds so fresh. No one can do it like Madonna. Ever.

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: i wish Madge would revisit being a redhead in one of her future eras

**evilqueenlex**: The dance floor is fun for like 2 seconds and then really sad

**Raaaaat**: yas madge make me jump

**RomanOrgy69**: My favorite album of all time. So iconic. When will the other girls ever?

**tapdancingpig**: This one grew on me gradually. I first gave this a lot of 5s and 6s, but as I kept listening, I found myself boosting each rating.

**twat\_brained**: I had this on repeat when I was 8 years old so I'm surprised I didn't turn into a Madonna stan. Then again, half her discography pales in comparison to this, so I've heard. Also, it's just come to my attention that the whole time I'd only ever listened to the nonstop mix because that's what I listened to on the physical album. So hearing these songs punctuated is a whole new experience.

**patronsaintofaspies**: In my opinion, this is the best album in the rate, and I certainly hope it helps Madonna nab her first win here. It's Madonna's final stay at the highest peaks of her career, and despite this bittersweetness, it's also a brilliant and euphoric collection of songs that, true to the title, are both introspective and huge bops.
