(OP mostly stolen from the BG rate/Smackdown threads... again)

Welcome to the Day 3 of the 2021 K-Pop Essentials Rate Reveal! Us [3 hosts](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/626601739835015181/919242933650223165/ezgif-1-bce8bcb0cc89.gif) ([u/1998tweety](https://www.reddit.com/u/1998tweety), [u/OliviaGodrigo](https://www.reddit.com/u/OliviaGodrigo), & [u/throwaway-7650](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway-7650)) are super excited to watch everyone overreact to certain placements and robberies for the third (and final) day in a row. Raters will laugh, cry, and everything in-between. We will be revealing from **#22-1** (the winner!) today.

Day 3 will begin at **5 p.m. EST**, about an hour from when this post goes up. You can follow along the reveal right in this thread, as everyone's scores will be posted as songs go out, or follow the reveal live in the [**Queup room**](https://www.queup.net/join/popheads-safe-space), featuring custom shitposts and very yass & slay interludes (once again, [pubby.club](https://pubby.club/~/ripplugdj) will be the backup).

**throwaway-7650** (10): if this didn’t make Day 3 I would’ve attacca on titan S1E1’d this subreddit

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): It sounds so much like something I’ve heard before, but I can’t pinpoint what it is. Anyways, this song is great. Seventeen in the best BG songs store: *insert Lois Griffin shoplifting*

---

**exciting\_patient4872** (11): Very surprised that I'm giving top scores to a song I only just heard for the first time, but here I am.

**fadedblue09** (11): I was about to skip this rate and then I remembered that my favorite SVT title is here. Idk if people can relate to this, but this anticipation for this comeback was crazy. And not only did they exceed expectations, they managed to achieve a darker, mature sound (something they struggle with a lot e.g. Fear) And again, the Joshua intro >>>

**Kadenfrost** (11): No words are enough to explain how much I love this song. It's giving 00's pop-rock nostalgia. The line distribution is lovely, how some members used their vocal tone in a different way (s.coups and vernon HELLO), the dance is really good, and the song meaning is kind of cute. It's like Fresh!Teen but in a more mature aesthetic. Rock With You just scratches an itch that couldn't be touched before. I usually like to compare them with Twice, because they truly are giving TALENT despite how many members they have in the group. Stream Seventeen y'all!!!!

**Zypker125** (11): I wasn’t initially into the song, but it slowly grew on me, and then kept on and kept on growing on me, to the point where I would listen to it at almost every opportunity. It’s just a perfect earworm song, and everything about it works.

**bespectacIed** (10): BOP. Love me some svt. they're a glorified frat house that coincidentally can dance and sing but they make the best material out of the bgs out there sorry!

**DefaultPophead** (10): oh no... it's happening... i'm a stan...

**jay duh** (10): father figure moment in every aspect

**metanoira** (10): this was an 11 contender i love this song so much mingyu wreck my ho-[train passes by]

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): i already liked this a lot upon release but it really has grown on me since then…the chorus is just so catchy and fun!! and all the boys look so good here <3

**pig-serpent** (10): This song doesn’t stand out terribly but it’s the song I find myself singing the most from this rate.  On top of that, it’s high energy and it’s doing the rock elements better than a lot of songs.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I mean… it's IPR core, how could I not love this???

**runaway3212** (10): seventeen slays sometimes

**apatel27** (9): The way it builds to the last chorus is great

**ebooks#5454** (9): i'm always plesantly surprised how much i live seventeen songs !

**ilyyyyy** (9): ok i like this even better than ready to love

**Kayaking11116** (9): i’m so unbelievably in love with the second part of the chorus, its so good, they did so good

**PSSST12** (9): OK???? This is actualy good but its no very nice.

**Roxieloxie** (9): ya ok

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Vernon got me down so bad

**seanderlust** (9): POP PUNK INFLUENCE?? IN MY KPOP RATE???? IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN I THINK!!!!

**skargardin** (9): banger

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): mgk but if he slayed

**wavingwolves** (8.9): the bed squeak sound... what is this... a nct song?....

**aestheticen** (8.5): Get it? Because it's rock!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): we need more pop-punk influenced kpop songs because they're the only ones doing this sound right

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): Oh, this group is *good*. Fun pop rock

**IsaiahTB0** (8.2): Not as strong as RFL but its surprisingly catchy.

**bigbigbee** (8): This song IS good (it feels like a more mature Pretty U in some ways) but the fact that it was the #1 song in the Seventeen Top Ten Pop Ten on r/kpop is insanity. They have at least five better title tracks. Learn your history, get off my lawn, etc etc

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Wooo! I’m not really dancing but I’m waving my hands!

**celladonn** (8): Good but I wish it rocked a bit harder... turn those guitars up!!

**hikkaru** (8): can we turn the mixing on those guitars UP please

**mayolizard** (8): slay but not super slay

**mimins** (8): lots of fun all around

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Anything with pop rock gets my instant updoots

**welcome2thejam** (8): Fun foray into pop rock

**Cooler\_lin** (7.8): i know for sure that I like this one more than the last one. the instrumental instantly caught my attention. I just wish the vocal line got to show out more

**cremeebrulee** (7.1): mk pitched this to me as ipr-core, but it’s giving more kid laroi than phoenix tbh

**2l82bstr8** (7): this one just passed me by tbh but there's nothing wrong with it

**ricki** (7): pledis for the love of good buy woozi a new mattress, this one's noisy as fuck

**vayyiqra** (7): I can't think of anything for this but I like it

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.5): this is ready to love but without the sentimental values i fear…

**whoisValensi** (6.5): SVT get over here and tell me your favorite bands. You wanna rock with me, but do you really wanna rock with me? Oh they don't mean like that??? Well, it's their loss.

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): It’s very difficult to think about the fact that it was a solid winner for a couple of dozen ballots until the ballad haters invaded our space and nuked this song. The song is a masterpiece! It should’ve stayed in the top 10!

---

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): one of my favorite kpop songs, this song just explodes with passion and the "I KNOW IT'S REAL I CAN FEEEEEEEEL IIIIIIIIIIIT" right before the chorus is probably my favorite two seconds in music in 2021

**celladonn** (11): My most listened kpop song of 2021! So good, and I love the emo vibe

**CrimsonROSET** (11): i've been pretty harsh this rate because this was one of the songs i heard before the rate itself and i was just absolutely obsessed- this set the standard so high i can't not give it an 11, the interplay of the vocals in the chorus, the verses, the prechorus, this is absolute perfection.

**vuemaurel** (11): Iconic!

**wavingwolves** (11): something shifted when they put gay ass soobin to sing "i need you GIRL" on this gay ass song

**aestheticen** (10): A K-Pop rate is not a K-Pop rate without a song title that confuses everyone

**agentofscranton** (10): fully embraced emo music down to the obnoxiously long song title

**DefaultPophead** (10): They always kill it, damn.

**flavasavavandal** (10): that is one hell of a chorus

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this is so popheads-coded…

**Gonza\_90** (10): Banger

**jasannn** (10): edgy done right

**jay duh** (10): pls do well

**mimins** (10): kpop needs more of this genre like now actually

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): they went to the bts hyyh school of subtle homoeroticism in music videos. and beomgyu went to the minghao school of looking like a emo lesbian. amen

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): beomgyu's a facebook gaming streamer??

**ricki** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/739218471535116341/991567894779547688/unknown.png

**runaway3212** (10): this song got me hooked on kpop... is that a good thing you might ask? good question!

**skargardin** (10): If only Good Boy Gone Bad would've served on the same level as this

**twiceoftheheart** (10): This felt like such a natural maturation for them

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Would I have given this my 11 if I heard it first before Loser=Lover? Maybe. Though I suppose this song doesn't appeal to my tastes as specifically as their other single. It still slaps though!! Who hurt you Taehyun??

**vhqv1997** (10): okay but who yells?

**whoisValensi** (10): MORE ROCK INFLUENCED K-POP!!!!! MORE!!!!!!! I DEMAND MORE!!!!! (I know you guys are gonna say go listen to DC but shhhhhh!) Also the feature from Seori is so fucking well executed on this. I know it hasn't even been a year but I want this TXT back lolllll.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.8): I love how dramatic it is

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): going pop-rock was the best move they could've made

**bluetriangles04** (9.5): Seori's parts really make the song, all in all it's a beautiful angsty ball of a song that calls back to my alternative roots and so I found it really enjoyable!

**Victerade** (9.5): AMAZING ACTUALLY

**apatel27** (9): Got a soft spot for this Pop Rock style

**bigbigbee** (9): Seori’s feature is kind of unique? Features in k-pop idol group title tracks are already rare, and they tend to be like, a rap verse - not two lines in the chorus, and maybe one ad lib. I mention all of this just because I think that her feature REALLY works, and I wonder who even thought to add it in.

**ilyyyyy** (9): the pre chorus and the chorus are amazing. and it put me on to seori (i love her song 'fairy tale')

**Kayaking11116** (9): my favorite gender is lovesick boys going on a bro-trip while they dramatically sing about their love sickness

**MassiveThief** (9): yeah this goes off. the vocals come through.

**poemforsmallthings** (9): I KNOW IT'S REAL I CAN FEEL ITTTTTTTTTT

**Qwilphish** (9): SO ANGSTY, its so wild but I live for it. They can explore this sad + mad side just hope we can get another Blue Hour or Crown out of them again

**LilacDaffodils** (8.7): I love the rock sound but I also automatically like anything that has Seori on it.

**ebooks#5454** (8.5): what is this assigned summer reading in the beginning?? HELP NOT THEM SETTING THE CAR ON FIRE INSTEAD OF THE TRASHFIRE

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.2): Boy With Luv (Pop-Punk Version)

**Cooler\_lin** (8.1): i like the use of the female feature, it definitely gives me nostalgia

**2dina3dworld** (8): this is one of those songs where it objectively sounds good but it isn’t my thing

**ImADudeDuh** (8): are they giving lovesong by The Cure a 0? OVER!

**mayolizard** (8): as a moa i was a little disappointed still cute

**sabooyah** (8): love the blend of male/female voices!

**astrologicalangel** (7): this name takes way too long to type out

**RandomHypnotica** (7): why is my biggest question with this weird-ass mv just why the pool is steaming

**vayyiqra** (7): Not very familiar with this group, nor with Seori but I kind of like the rock influence here.

**Zypker125** (6.9): Like most TXT songs, the choruses and pre-choruses are amazing, but the verses and bridge give me nothing. I’d be fine with it winning, but not terribly enthused.

**sarcasticsobs** (6.5): What is this song title? Anyway, this feels very different from everything else on this playlist, which gets it *some* points from me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): seori singing for like 5 seconds in the chorus majorly outsold every other part of this song

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.5): the say you love me part straight up sounds like a Justin Bieber song

=====

2021inKPOP: **cloudbustingmp3** (6): this one feels like it'll probably grow on me in the future and i'll regret this score but for now...

**DaBigBoi** (6): Listening to this after Thrill Ride made me realize how quiet the mix is, which is odd for a song like this

**PSSST12** (6): This song is already too whiny for me, and it doesnt really age well for me.

**welcome2thejam** (6): They briefly put their pop punk hats on for that pre-chorus

**bulforster** (5.3): this sounds like it should have a ryan tedder writing credit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Oh THAT’S what TXT stands for! Anyway this song is boring.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): TXT turning into a faux rock band is still so weird to me

**akanewasright** (4): huh

**chancehugs** (4): Not something I'd jam to personally.

**hunnybee12** (4): i just dont get the hype their voices sound grating and annoying on top of the hybe specialty awful vocal processing .... txt pls go back being furries i beg

**pig-serpent** (3.5): Based on Discord comments I was expecting this song to be wild, but it’s horribly hollow and hits flat until Seori comes on.  There’s a passable song in here, but I’d rather it just passed me by.

**maybecrf** (3): much too much

**orbiteezus** (3): deeply unpleasant listening experience, never make rock music again

**rotating3Dtext** (3): I’m probably not the target demographic, but I loved Blue Hour and when they came out with this teen angst pop rock millennial whoop thing I was so disappointed. I don’t hate it anymore but I also don’t love it.

**bespectacIed** (1): im bored

**frogaranaman** (1): I feel like I'm in a commercial for a Jeep Wrangler

**BaconShoes** (0): this is horrendous omg i’m sorry

**IsaiahTB0** (0): There's not much here thats redeemable. There's a feature that adds nothing to the song, bad vocal production, etc. They make yassified music better than this rock tinged stuff.

**kpoppyko** (0): dire

**moonagenightmares** (0): taehyun screeching,... im literally in pain

**sage** (0): ME-U=:( (LOVE WITH U)

b_o_g_o_: that's it. burn the fucking sub down this shit is beyond saving. y'all were given one of the best power ballads of the past 5 years and y'all fucking shat on it and gave it a measly 7.4 average because it wasn't pots and pans music or generic dancepop song #9999. y'all wouldn't know good if it bit you on the ass, slept with your partner, and burned your house down.

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): Orbits are so powerful that they got a Japanese song that sold 5 copies into a Kpop rate

---

**BasedButta** (11): super hyper song and very catchy - this is what I listen kpop for

**bespectacIed** (11): fat, nasty, broke as hell... half of original orbits already gone and turned into haters from their new fandoms... they had 3 dollars, a flimsy japanese contract, picsart, and a dream. They came on this song MAD AS HELL. I'm probably wasting my 11 but I don't care, I am orbit for life and this bop litrally saved me from unstanning lol. Cherry Bullet, fromis, weeekly, and WJSN (yes, shocker) for the win if this somehow doesn't

**mrach** (11): why did they keep this for a japanese release this would have easily been their best korean tt

**orbiteezus** (11): maybe obvious from the name but this song really is perfect i love it so much its so bright and full and lush and other positive descriptors

**2l82bstr8** (10): the best Cider ad I've ever seen (or heard)

**anothertown** (10): lowkey goated mv

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): how can you listen to this and not smile, it's so fun

**bulforster** (10): Loona were at their lowest... flopping, ""girl crush"" and broke. Company in shambles. They came on this bitch mad as hell!!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): cant believe they only had a japanese comeback in 2021! kinda crazy!

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song cute as hell damn

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): LOONA was at her lowest… corrupted by SM, became a sellout, broke. Career in shambles. They came on this bitch mad as hell!!!

**hikkaru** (10): rickiyola

**ilyyyyy** (10): loved this sound from them, this song is perfection, it makes me so happy. they sound lovely. can't believe it's not getting my 11 i'm such a fake fan </3 love love love the MV too, it's like nothing i've seen before

**jay duh** (10): jinsoul is a latina

**maybecrf** (10): but the future funk remix would be my 11

**mimins** (10): why have I never heard this before??? super fun and enjoyable. the high pitched notes don't even bother me this time

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): i really love this song but the mv makes me so dizzy lmfao

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): one of loona's best songs and almost my eleven

**Qwilphish** (10): The references in the MV made it so fun to watch the whole thing. They also finally gave the girls a proper chorus after like 3 years and of course they ate!

**ricki** (10): PTT was a loyalty test. Those of us that stuck with Loona were awarded with this

**Tazzachar** (10): better than PTT, there I said it

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): infectious

**vhqv1997** (10): this song fucks so hard the rate hosts have to include it even though it's an afterthought japanese release lol

**whoisValensi** (10): If we can have some English songs here why not a Japanese song right?! God I wish "Flip That" would have been more like this instead of what it was. Anyways more fun LOONA like this please!

**Cooler\_lin** (9.8): made me cry over the phone about my lost youth...

**chancehugs** (9): Love the energy of the song, but it sounds like it's a key higher than the girls are comfortable with.

**coolfluffle** (9): loved this release a lot, poorly promoted though

**cosmicneve** (9): Loona are at their best when they release bright songs, I think.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i still stand by the fact this should have been called loonahoop

**skargardin** (9): SMASH

**vayyiqra** (9): Putting this in the slot of "dumb fun bops" with "Pirate". No thoughts just huuuuuuula huuuuuuula hoop.

**Victerade** (9): MISSED THIS LOONA SO MUCH

**welcome2thejam** (9): Absolute sugar rush of a track

**yatcho** (9): i miss just having FUN ya know

**SkylarV** (8.9): Kinda sad that this is LOONA's best title since Hi High (and that's including Flip That), would love a Korean version of this song

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): that one minigame on wii fit <3

**seanderlust** (8.8): this feels like how i felt when i used the hula hoop in elementary school PE class

**IsaiahTB0** (8.5): Good track, plain MV but the song is good.

**aestheticen** (8): Must a song be Korean to be in a K-Pop rate? Is it not enough to listen to an upbeat song about hula hooping?

**BaconShoes** (8): not my fave loona song but it’s fun

**ignitethephoenix** (8): oof those pitched voices in the chorus are rough, this song does bop otherwise

**melody** (8): loona never dissapoints

**Roxieloxie** (8): this is like being stuck on a stranded island with sharks on both sides of me

**runaway3212** (8): this has grown off me a bit, it's kinda too 90s workout instruction video for me

**sarcasticsobs** (7.8): Sounds like someone is straining in the chorus but I'm not familiar enough with LOONA to know if that’s someone’s actual tone (Edit: Wait it’s Chuu???). Cute video

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): despite really liking loona and having listened to them a lot i keep forgetting about this and never really listen to it but it's quite reminiscent of their earlier stuff and that's something i've really missed (not that that'll stop me from giving ptt an 11)

**ebooks#5454** (7.5): shout out to ricki addison rae for playing this after a really stressful rate reveal, the whole chat was :audience: and im not sure if it was the right vibes but i geniunely really appreciated it i think it's what we needed

**moonshxne** (7.5): a lil too aegyo and in my face for my taste but it’s good

**DaBigBoi** (7): If only we could rate some other groups’ Japanese tracks

**Kayaking11116** (7): Oh my god this song is so fun and so cute. The only reason why its not higher is because the chorus is super high and sometimes it sounds strained

**MToms** (7): The rap part sounds like GingaMingaYo, does anyone else hear it?

**plastichaxan** (7): fun

**PSSST12** (7): This group peaked during their predebut I fear. .

**sabooyah** (7): fun!

2021inKPOP: **akanewasright** (6): tfw you have such a bad title for your year’s mini that your stans all flock to the middling jpop single you put out that year

**apatel27** (6): Commercial Music

**mayolizard** (6): cute but i forgot about her

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Sometimes I feel like I’m just judging K-Pop songs based on how awkward it is to sing the English words they use. Eleven? Not bad. Money? Tried and true. Feels? A bit memey but not the worst. Hula Hoop? Uhhhhhhhh

**Zypker125** (5.7): This is the best song that they’ve released in like, the past 3 years. Which is really sad when I sit down and think about it.

**bluetriangles04** (5.5): the best song from their recent output I feel, but it is slighted from shoddy mixing especially in the later half

**fadedblue09** (5): I

**vuemaurel** (5): Love the visuals but the song not so much

**sage** (4.8): nudisco snore

**celladonn** (4.5): I want to like this but it's pretty grating

**2dina3dworld** (4): I’m sorry but that “Hulalalala” hook kills any enjoyment I had of the song - it’s just so shrill.

**NotWith10000Men** (4): too bubblegummy

**moonagenightmares** (2): i cant stand that chorus for the life of me

**rslashpoopheads** (2): trauma

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): flop!

**wavingwolves** (0): the most grating song in the entire rate so i'm treating it deserves

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): There’s like 10 seconds of actual singing in this song. The song just feels like a whole bunch of nonsense, but I can’t say I don’t kinda enjoy it. A little bit.

---

**cremeebrulee** (11): they slayed with this and then never again

**IsaiahTB0** (11): Easily SOTY sorry. The amount of catchy lines, the hooks, the charisma in the vocals. Naevis?... Calling, ae!

**jasannn** (11): This song shouldn’t work but it just does and I somehow loved it from my first listen. Maybe the SM stockholming is working faster these days. Anyways, this song is all singable and memorable hooks with an hypnotizing instrumental and simple yet iconic dance move. It never fails to get my hyped when it comes on AUX.

**melody** (11): thank you to the popheads last fm group for hating this song so much, without yall I wouldn't have checked it out and it wouldn't have become my all time favourite kpop song.

**nootnoot781** (11): this song has crack in it i can’t stop replaying it

**PSSST12** (11): THEE moment of the 4th gen. Everyone lost their minds. Got everyone hating, screaming and throwing up. Then suddenly everyone switched up 😤😤 The beat switch in the middle was historic me thinks. And the electronic instrumental gave this song an unparalled replayability. Best gg song of the gen so far.

**runaway3212** (11): changed my life, i became a different, probably worse, person after hearing this

**starla\_** (11): no questions, this is the bohemian rhapsody of our time

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is a song that shouldn’t work on any fundamental level but somehow it goes off, and I thank the stars for that.

**akanewasright** (10): The best song ever made?!!?!??

**bespectacIed** (10): a true cultural reset... NEXT LEVUhL you might say. queenqueen's beat switch bridge, people died. smash hit for a reason

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This song structure…they’re living in the future.

**celladonn** (10): People that hate this what's it like being so tasteless

**chenle** (10): they're on the next ｢_(ಠ_ಠ) level ｢_(ಠ_ಠ)

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): NAEVIS... CALLING

**Cooler\_lin** (10): absolute banger, the switch up! just a badass song and my favorite aespa title. the rap verses in the bridge>>

**ernie** (10): (this song is overhated and it's a fact, the "Beatdrop.... NAEVIS, CALLING" Section is just so iconic and that's what makes next level for me IMO if they didn't add that part i would've given it a 7 ngl)

**hanpop** (10): i learned this was a sample from fast n furious and my life has changed

**hikkaru** (10): the three seconds after this released that i didn't like it. a dark time. truly the nadir of my life. im so sorry naevis forgive me

**hunnybee12** (10): i'll never understand how ppl consider this song so weird like have u heard bohemian rhapsody its basically the same thing 🙄

**ilyyyyy** (10): such a cool and exciting song to have in kpop, it always gets me hype, love their vocals too and the switch up is so fun

**imasalesman** (10): Naevis… Calling… Æ

**jay duh** (10): i was bullied for weeks on end for simply liking this song wheres my purple heart

**LilacDaffodils** (10): Best GG song of 2021. Sure fast and furious did it first but did they have virtual avatars designed to be more conventionally attractive than the already standard setting idols? No I didn't think so. Also that bridge!?!?!!!

**mayolizard** (10): vocal slayage gif

**milkywayinradius** (10): used to think this song was dumb but it grew on me like JOPPING; the arm movement in the chorus is so memorable lol

**mimins** (10): do they know what they did with this song? I don't think they know what they did with this song. A banger. A masterpiece. I can't look at the phrase next level like a normal person and it's their fault.

**moonagenightmares** (10): IM ON DA NEXT. LEVUL.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): now this was an actual cultural reset like woah…something shifted in kwangya when this came out

**poemforsmallthings** (10): everyone remembers where they were

**Qwilphish** (10): this song is such an earworm, i really hated it when it came out but now it is one of the most iconic songs from this year. Obsessed with "im on da ne-xt lebul" and of course the point move

**raggedy-princess** (10): aespa wrote the manual on releasing S-tier comebacks after an underwhelming debut. that's my naevis indeed

**ricki** (10): the introduction of naevis and her call into my life was genuinely the most significant thing that happened to me last year

**sabooyah** (10): i thought this song was just okay the first time i listened to it. I gave it exactly one more listen and was like ... nah not for me. So I only listened to it twice. Two days later this shit showed up playing in my DREAMS bruh tbh i have been obsessed ever since. It's been more than a year. wtf.

**SFbby** (10): Ascending to the next level after hearing this song

**skargardin** (10): maybe the next level truther were right after all!

**Stryxen** (10): so estrogenic

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): cyberpunk 2077 type beat

**vayyiqra** (10): Yeah we've all heard the jokes about being "onda". Mine is "that's my novice". Anyway this is a banger and the beat switch is genius. I don't know why this has haters. This slaps.

**vuemaurel** (9.5): Truly on the next level!

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): *Yes* it’s weird and very clunky and that’s why it’s *GOOD*. They hated me for telling the *truth*! And okay but the way Winter pronounces “next level”

**aestheticen** (9): "I hate it. It's like SM wants aespa to fail" - me, on release day

**anothertown** (9): naevis 💪 calling 🚨

**Kayaking11116** (9): it’s a grower but boy does she grow

**paigama** (9): could have been a 10 if I were to answer this ballot last year

**plastichaxan** (9): she’s good but she ain’t no Savage

**rslashpoopheads** (9): sickest bass line of the year

**tiltheendoftheline** (9): I got it from the first listen. There's something about how simple it sounds, how they pronounce the lyrics, that makes it so satisfying. ㄷㄷ

**alwayswords** (8.5): NAEVIS CALLING best thing to come out of 2021

**chancehugs** (8.5): Even after so long that switch up in the middle still takes me out of the zone. Prime bad bitch music otherwise.

**cherryices** (8.5): mid-game boss level music

**Victerade** (8.5): brought me to the next level fr fr

**bulforster** (8.4): the way they go right back to their fast & furious ost cover after that slay beat drop like nothing happened is so fucking funny to me

**2l82bstr8** (8): two great songs stitched into a single good song
[/r/popheads/comments/w74ejy/day_3_1_2_3_4_5_6_7_i_want_to_change_my_11/ihhzcm9/]

=====

2021inKPOP: **agentofscranton** (8): it's hard because i think 80% of this song is incredible but I hate the naevis calling... verse SO much

**bluetriangles04** (8): I HATED this song on release. More than HATED at that point. However, it grew on me like an odd fungus and became extremely enjoyable to me down the road. At some point, it just clicked. While it's definitely not my favorite aespa title, it's solid and very deserving of the attention it has garnered internationally. This is seemingly aespa's venture into a new type of genre SM is poking its head in that I call "motor-sports core" lmfao.

**ebooks#5454** (8): omg i love KDA

**Gonza\_90** (8): Is this hyperpop?

**ignitethephoenix** (8): okay I gave this a second listen cause it was weird enough to deserve and I kind dig it.

**Islands** (8): I used to think aespa was all AI/simulated idols and i didnt like this on release cause i thought their voices sounded so fake

**Kadenfrost** (8): unpopular opinion but I found this messier than Savage

**twiceoftheheart** (8): When I first saw someone say this was a song from Fast & Furious, I thought they were joking

**yatcho** (8): this was a messy rollercoaster. I wouldn't say its good but i can see the appeal, does a lot more for me than any other aespa effort

**wavingwolves** (7.8): it's kind of ridiculous how this song is literally just next level by a$ton wyld without leaving anything out

**BaconShoes** (7.5): the switch up is fun. I kinda hated this at first, but it’s growing on me tbh

**coolfluffle** (7.5): whilst it is still largely a cover, this was a turning point for gen 4 kpop introducing the detached song format that is still very popular, while i dont really like this style its important to acknowledge how much its influenced the industry

**La-lamp** (7.5): Audacious

**orbiteezus** (7.5): still think it was a bad idea for them to remake a fast & furious song as their second single but that being said this grew on me, the beat switches do feel a bit gimmicky but theyre

**seanderlust** (7.5): these are two unrelated 10s stitched together in a very strange way. i'm not entirely sure how to rate this one tbh but it is pretty slay so there is that

**thedoctordances1940** (7.3): i'm still not entirely sure why it just turns into a completely different song at one point but i guess it slowly grew on me cause tbh the rest is great even though it sounds like a kasabian song

**DraculaWeekend** (7): I still don't know if I like this song

**welcome2thejam** (7): CONTINUE? 10... 9... 8... YOU HAVE CHOSEN NO

**cosmicneve** (6.5): Like most SM western song remakes, the Aespa version is a brighter, sparklier, more fleshed-out version of the original. I do like Aespa's version, but I still find it hard to get past its strange clunky lyrics which try for some kind of Blackpink-meets-Loona catchphrasey esotericism, but only result in being too nonsensical for its own good.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): listen i love aespa but this song needs Some Work to be great. the la la la part is lazy and the beat drop part is just too dissimilar to the rest. fun to listen to though

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): idk what's happening but they look good doing whatever it is

**whoisValensi** (6.5): I'M ONDA. God if only the beat was more dynamic. I recommend giving the ZSunder version a listen if you haven't (It's uhhh why I have so many plays on this song lol I'm a FAKE). A more dynamic production is what this song really needed in some areas, it's quite a flat beat on its own. Tho I uhhhh I won't get into the switch up... it sure does happen! Also, guys, I'm starting to believe Black Mamba is a metaphor for SM's title track choices in this essay I will-

**DaBigBoi** (6): I’M ONDA

**ImADudeDuh** (6): did they edit in the wrong song in the middle
[/r/popheads/comments/w74ejy/day_3_1_2_3_4_5_6_7_i_want_to_change_my_11/ihhzepm/]

=====

2021inKPOP: **vhqv1997** (6): loved the production, but i can't believe any person actually said all of these lyrics aloud without needing a paper bag over their head

**BasedButta** (5.5): what the fuck. also i just noticed the person screaming during each “next level” and I can’t unhear it

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.4): i don’t know what a naevis is and at this point i’m too afraid to ask

**CrimsonROSET** (5): i’m onda

**nicolas** (5): why are they trying to do 3 songs in one

**SkylarV** (5): but its an 8 when played at 1.4x speed

**moonshxne** (4.7): Hot take: this is a BORE. Each member unenthusiastically sing-talks in roughly the same pitch over an incredibly repetitive beat for such loooong stretches of song. I barely batted an eye when they switched genres - if they didn’t *insert generic Yoo Young-jin R&B section* to contrast with such monotonous sections, would we even care for said R&B sections?

**sliced-peaches** (4): a guilty pleasure and ill give them their flowers from turning a song from the worlds most heterosexual movie franchise but unfortunately the flowers died cuz this song is still corny af

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Loredump: The Song

**flavasavavandal** (3.5): there’s at minimum, 20 songs jammed into Next Level and none of them are all that good

**Zypker125** (3.5): I 💰👴 walk 🏼♀ to 💦 KWANGYA Next level 🎚🍒 KOSMO I 🙋 see the NU EVO That's 😐😐 my 🙋 NAEVIS Watch me 😂 while ♀ I WORK 🔨 IT OUT 🏍😠 Show 🎪 me 😭💦 the 💦 way 🅱👯 to 🤑😔 KOSMO Next 🉐 Level "P.O.S" 🚔⛹ What's the 👏🌧 name? BLACK 🏿 MAMBA

**frogaranaman** (3): I get experimenting with song structures and all but the structures you attempt need to make sense first and foremost. otherwise it just sounds like a third grader just found a pirated copy of FL Studio and Youtube tutorials for the first time

**TiltControls** (3): do VGI in august

**pig-serpent** (2.5): It was nice of them to realize their song was bad and change it, but it was mean of them to change it back.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.4): uhhhhh

**apatel27** (2): Sometimes greenscreen isn't the solution

**Esh\_Kebab** (2): One of the pivotal "I'm getting old" moments for me was witnessing the massive success this dumpster fire of a song had. Not only is it bad, but it's also Kwangya.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): i just don't get aespa's whole concept, it just feels ridiculous and makes no sense and their music suffers as a result. also the beat switch in this song is completely shoehorned in and sounds terrible

**DirtyRat583** (1): they were trying to serve girlboss but all they could provide is a boring song that feels like sand in your mouth

**exciting\_patient4872** (1): bad cover

**HoshiLock** (1): I only like the dance and probably thanks to tiktok

**maybecrf** (1): this song is so corny and cringe, ill never forgive you all for taking this seriously

**Roxieloxie** (1): the part where the beat switches and it becomes a new song is really nice but unfortunately its not the full thing

**sage** (1): a 0 in spirit

**RandomHypnotica** (0): I feel like I live on a different planet than everyone else when it comes to this song… the bridge is enjoyable, but it's literally an entirely different song, and it feels incredibly out of place, and the core of the song, everything else, sounds like target commercial-core. The whole thing just feels so disjointed and WEIRD i don't understand!!!

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): I have an indigenous friend who really hates them but I’ve never found their music to be that good either

---

**moooo566** (11): no-one can serve it quite like dreamcatcher. the commitment to the bit is unparalelled. it's hard not to see everyone else as just phoning it in after watching dreamcatcher fit as much cursed fairground as humanly possible into three-ish minutes.

**NotWith10000Men** (11): GUITARS AND DRUMS

**pig-serpent** (11): I immediately decided that this was winning the rate, but it took a few listens to fully grow on me, but this song has it all.  The symphonic metal and breakbeat influences don’t feel genre touristy, they feel specifically chosen to make this song as high impact as possible.  I’ve had my doubts about Dreamcatcher before but this song proves that they’re on top of their game they’re the best possible version of themselves.

**poemforsmallthings** (11): IT'S EXCELLENT!!!!! OUTSTANDING EVEN

**2l82bstr8** (10): it just tugs at my weeb heart idk how they do it

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): dreamcatcher always slays

**celladonn** (10): My fave girl group delivering quality as always

**coolfluffle** (10): iconic release, got me into the band that are now my ults, love the mv as well

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Love that little dnb part

**ernie** (10): (their title tracks always hit so it’s no suprising this one is serving)

**Kayaking11116** (10): BRUH YALL DAURNT UNDERSTAURRRRND THE ROCK AND THE HORROR I THINK THIS GROUP IS AMAZING. THE CHORUS IS SO GOOD

**milkywayinradius** (10): dreamcatcher songs are usually super cool except for that hilarious global warming animal song

**moonagenightmares** (10): best dc title idc idc

**RandomHypnotica** (10): dreamcatcher never fucking misses

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): sorry for being an insomnia i dont do it on purpose

**whoisValensi** (10): The way I fucking enjoyed "Odd Eye" and never listened to this when it dropped so this is my first time listening to it lolllllllll. I know I keep saying it buttttt ONE OF THESE DAYS I AM GOING TO GIVE DC THE PROPER DISCOG RUN. Cause they really have yet to like... miss for me. It's crazy. Also the imagery in this video just appeals to all my senses lolllllll.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.7): My *girls*! There’re multiple airs of slight creepiness in this (even ignoring the video and choreo). Prechorus rules. Was thrown for a little loop during the drum ‘n bass-type stuff rap section the first time I listened to this. Gahyeon expression queen. So pumped for them having their first win this year

**Gonza\_90** (9.5): I like Odd Eye more but still, Dreamcatcher are queens

**IsaiahTB0** (9.2): One of the first dreamcatcher songs I've actually enjoyed

**Zypker125** (9.1): Odd Eye was robbed from this rate sadge ~~I don’t actually blame rate hosts because they had tough decisions to make, but I’ll pretend to blame them anyways because they’re easy scapegoats~~.

**bluetriangles04** (9): SEEING THIS LIVE DRAINED MY SOUL RIGHT OUT OF ME. I LOVE YOU HANDONG!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): they just don’t miss

**flavasavavandal** (9): this would be amazing if half the production didnt sound incompetently produced. Seriously whoever didn’t let those guitars get some grit needs some talking to

**Qwilphish** (9): it's so funny that this is their idea of a "bright" concept

**vhqv1997** (9): handong and gahyeon murdered this song but dami has had better verses

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.7): while i do prefer Odd Eye, i really appreciate them going for a softer approach while still retaining their horror concept here! also dami step on me pleek…

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): It's not as good as their earlier stuff but like it's still a really well executed pop-metal concept and it even has a breakcore section so of course i still love this

**yatcho** (8.6): my girls always bring it!

**mimins** (8.5): oooohhhhhh......this song AND deja vu.....I might have to stan...

**moonshxne** (8.5): damn this catchy

**plastichaxan** (8.5): add this to 3mo rate omfg

**Victerade** (8.5): their anime moment

=====

2021inKPOP: **aestheticen** (8): Somehow I listened to this a lot for like, 3 weeks and then randomly removed it one day. Not sure what happened there

**hikkaru** (8): odd eye >

**ilyyyyy** (8): a lot poppier than i expected from hearing about the group, not fully into it but not bad at all

**MassiveThief** (8): really dig the random chugging guitars that play now and then

**nicolas** (8): emo flops

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): YAS my edgy girls are back <3

**welcome2thejam** (8): Unsurprisingly sounds best when it's rocking, but that brief drum n bass bit is what really steals the show

**ebooks#5454** (7.8): this is giving Hotel De Luna vibes, which is great bc i love that kdrama

**paigama** (7.7): I usually don't like their songs but this one is actually quite likable to me. This is like Hwaa but it sounds more interesting and less bland.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): this is like an edgier fancy

**raggedy-princess** (7.5): not in the upper tier of DC comebacks but this has grown on me a lot

**BaconShoes** (7): the rock elements are fun but it doesn’t completely slay

**ignitethephoenix** (7): why is this so boring for dreamcatcher

**maybecrf** (7): im bored, but at least the vocals are good

**mayolizard** (7): can they make a song thats ONLY drum and bass

**orbiteezus** (7): missed this when it came out but this is really fun! not sure if i would put it on an album titled Summer Holiday though…

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Dreamcatcher songs all sound the same to me but in a good way

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): part really good, part really not as good

**bulforster** (6.9): ctfu that this is them doing a summer concept

**Cooler\_lin** (6.9): one thing about dreamcatcher is that their songs are all going to sound the same, just a matter of how bad dami's verse is

**cherryices** (6.6): not my thing but they sound good!

**chenle** (6.5): i promise i love most of dreamcatcher's music

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.5): kinda just them on autopilot

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): jiu is gorg…don’t really have much to say about the song but it’s cute!

**SkylarV** (6.5): The best parts of this song are when it DOESN'T rely on the music-box melody

**wavingwolves** (6.1): do you ever listen to a song and think Wow This Is A Song

**apatel27** (6): Doing too much

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): They sound like there’s gonna love me until I hate them.

**Esh\_Kebab** (6): I love Dami, but this rap verse ain't it.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this is like an alternate universe halsey song

**skargardin** (6): They have better titles I fear

**chancehugs** (5): Like the pop elements of the song. The rock elements not so much.

**PSSST12** (5): still waiting for another you and i from them I fear.

**tiltheendoftheline** (5): not my thing.

**vayyiqra** (5): Please no cheesy metal guitar. The rest is fine. The drum'n'bass part rules.

**DaBigBoi** (4.5): “BE [pause] cause I love you” just sounds so awkward to me, I like all the genre inspirations tho

**sabooyah** (4): bridge is good but kind of falls flat for me otherwise

**fadedblue09** (3): picking this over Odd Eye….interesting choice

**jay duh** (3): what the fuckkkk

**runaway3212** (2.5): they capitalized the BE to strengthen the connection that their music is of the same quality as that album

**bespectacIed** (2): im tired of their sound tbh

**bookthieving** (11): all rise for the bisexual anthem

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): i actually think this song permanently altered my brain chemistry…i have 348 scrobbles of this at the time of writing and i will listen to this until the day i die…from song to mv to choreo to lyrics to styling to bisexuality to taemin homage, hoshi did what had to be DONE!!!

**apatel27** (10): The chorus sounds like Break My Heart but it's good

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): "but she was already pouring him a brimming glass of spiders"

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I wish Seventeen's songs were this good

**hikkaru** (10): im obssessed w the choreo

**jay duh** (10): i wish i was a girl so i could be a f-hag and have him as my bestie..

**Kadenfrost** (10): He was so hot for doing this but why isn't his first title track called Tiger smh

**milkywayinradius** (10): really cool visuals and spidery choreo!! love that dark chorus. damn this is visually creative plus the song is good.

**moonagenightmares** (10): hoshi put his whole spussy into this

**omgthenerve** (10): looking forward to Hoshi's future solo projects, I had this song on repeat for weeks in 2021

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): hoshi only serves

**ricki** (10): i thought he was a tiger

**sage** (10): this being the best thing to come out of svt for years

**tiltheendoftheline** (10): this is fucking amazing, it should've been a solo debut even. Absolutely underrated.

**vayyiqra** (10): I'm going to be mad if Popheads does this song dirty because this is a SLAPPER.

**wavingwolves** (10): gay music for furries

**welcome2thejam** (10): Big marks for nailing the anti-drop with a solid groove.

**whoisValensi** (10): I can't believe the Shawol out SHINee'd the SHINee. When Taemin failed us the most, Hoshi was there for us. Anyways if you need me for the next week or at least until Friday (as in the Friday that is incoming as I write this, so the 22nd of July :P lol), you can now catch me listening to this on repeat.

**cherryices** (9.3): sad to report that the last.fm tags are no longer “gay furry cunty”. they are now “gay ass furry”

**poemforsmallthings** (9.3): he bathed in the father lake, graduated magna cum laude from Taemin university, was a vessel for god in that recording studio, etc

**bluetriangles04** (9): I have to say, for the amount of times I've listened to SEVENTEEN, I've barely found time to appreciate Hoshi's voice in their title tracks. Maybe I'm not listening close enough, but this song in particular fits him so well not only vocally wise but with performance as well, and gave me proper time to do so.

**HoshiLock** (9): Hoshi is incredible, maybe im biased but I think he will be an amazing soloist

**Kayaking11116** (9): idk what else to say except i’m obsessed with this. like its so good. i will say the bridge is a little lackluster though

**mayolizard** (9): lowkey slay

**plastichaxan** (9): oh he’s sick for this one i love it

**RandomHypnotica** (9): why is he rolling in cum

**sliced-peaches** (9): im afraid of spiders but id let this one fuck tbh

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): maybe a little forgettable but this is cool as hell, I feel like it's very rare to see a k-pop male singer being this effortlessly sexy in his concept

**BasedButta** (8.5): oh no he’s hot

**jasannn** (8.5): the best taemin song here

**orbiteezus** (8.5): underrated ngl, super smooth

**seanderlust** (8.5): these are some sexy instrumentals! EDIT "when you tie me up like a spider" oh werk it is horny

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): not the biggest fan of the vocals but the melody slayed so hard

**sarcasticsobs** (8.1): It sounds like it’s trying a little much to be “hot” at points but it’s not *quite* getting there for me when it does. Had fun with it when it’s *not* doing that (because it *is* sensual-feeling overall). And love the live performances of it. Dude can dance. Overall, pretty dang good.

**BaconShoes** (8): this was interesting! I enjoyed it

**bespectacIed** (8): Not everyone can be taemin... but if there's a svt member that could pull off effortless sultry sexuality, it's prob hoshi

**celladonn** (8): He ate this choreo

**ilyyyyy** (8): this sounds so sleek & sexy, and i'm a sucker for a little electric guitar lol. i listened to it back when it released and then completely forgot about it lol its going in the playlist rn

**maybecrf** (8): oop

**melody** (8): sounds like dishes clicking

**PSSST12** (8): Taemin lite but done well so i will have to let it pass me thinks.

**skargardin** (8): This was cool

2021inKPOP: **cloudbustingmp3** (7.7): oh this is kinda nice

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): this production is amazing, i just don't care for his voice too much i fear

**aestheticen** (7.5): Is it weird if a motivation of mine to work out is so I can have enough core strength to do whatever he is doing at the start of the choreo?

**DaBigBoi** (7.5): I’m so in my jussy

**Cooler\_lin** (7.4): taemin has sons!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.4): this choreo is so goated…. i wish the song popped off a little more but it’s still good mhm…

**IsaiahTB0** (7.3): Great MV, song is not my vibe.

**hunnybee12** (7): how much did a carat paypall yall to include this

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i better get a warning before this song goes out and the shitpost for it is something that would traumatize me

**mimins** (7): the antidrop ate

**moonshxne** (7): Taemin’s power

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Is he dancing in his cum

**paigama** (6.7): i apparently already listened to this song before but i do not remember anything about it at all as i "re"-listened to it. not bad, just a bit boring.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): That Under the Sea ass percussion line…it is a bit distracting.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this sounds like a charlie puth song (not compliment)

**metanoira** (6): i love hoshi bc he gives such chaotic bisexual energy and has abs too but this is a mid taemin reject

**pig-serpent** (6): Honestly I still feel like I’m waiting for this to grow on me even though I’ve listened to it like 20 times in the last 2 weeks.

**sabooyah** (6): good but VERY derivative for a solo debut imo. Could have come up with more unique sound or concept for him

**Zypker125** (5.8): You hear people talk about bringing homophobia back to r/popheads, but have you ever thought about bringing back arachnophobia?

**rslashpoopheads** (5.5): cute

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): this is fine i guess but people were hyping it up in the discord more than it deserved to be so im gonna be petty and tank it a little

**flavasavavandal** (5): i feel uncomfortable close in to Hoshi in this song

**Qwilphish** (5): I just don't have the will to figure out what's going on

**runaway3212** (4): this boring song people hyped up as amazing

**chancehugs** (3): Doesn't feel like this song is going anywhere.

**vhqv1997** (3): if he wanted to show off his dancing so much he could have just done a dance cover he didn't need to release noise to go with it

**ebooks#5454** (2): listen i like spiders but this made me incredibly uneasy

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): They really released one of the best heartbreak anthems ever in K-pop just for this song to be aluminum certified

---

**2l82bstr8** (11): this sounds like what collective catharsis feels

**chancehugs** (11): God, this song is everything - cathartic, uplifting, pensive, perfect. Thank God Brave Girls resurged because otherwise we wouldn't have this masterpiece.

**flavasavavandal** (11): the moment I heard those harmonised oooh’s through that vocal filter, I knew I was in for something special, maybe some of the guitar textures could come through a bit clearer but that’s about all I have in terms of criticism, I love the vibe, the desperate night out that got a little too out of control and your feelings spilled on the floor but it’s all good because you’ve got some good friends with you, and the best hooks given to a song in this rate. And Brave Girls really elevated this with a sense of camaraderie and friendship that I don’t think I’ve heard before in a Kpop song. This song is magical and I can only hope it does well

**akanewasright** (10): this sounds like it could be a filler Carly Rae Jepsen song. Fortunately, I love most of her filler

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): with how many songs this group has about riding and rolling i feel like they would work well with Charli XCX

**bigbigbee** (10): This feels mature in a great way. Brave Girls, despite having their viral moment in 2021, really were born in 3rd Gen and not 4th, and this song reminds me of a sound that was popular in k-pop much longer ago, maybe even in 2nd Gen: After School Red’s Into the Night Sky, 2NE1’s Ugly, and especially SPICA’s Tonight (a bop btw, I really recommend it to anyone who likes After We Ride)

**cremeebrulee** (10): i was gonna clown them for naming a song this when they have a song called "we ride" already, but this was legitimately excellent wow. probably my favorite discovery

**fadedblue09** (10): The fact that this never got proper promotion is criminal

**Gonza\_90** (10): Love me some City Pop

**ilyyyyy** (10): so good i love brave girls

**jay duh** (10): they came back and popped their bgussies

**Kadenfrost** (10): City Pop Queens. Its giving CRJ Dedicated. Its giving nostalgia. Its giving heartbreak. Its giving ending song of a coming of age. Brave Girls never disappoint.

**metanoira** (10): they'll always be mother to ME‼

**PSSST12** (10): Should have gotten the clout rollin had. 😔 The better song i fear.

**Qwilphish** (10): when she snatched her own wig, i felt that. I love this rock inspired track, so out of left field for Brave Girls

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this sounds like every song by The Midnight in the best way possible

**seanderlust** (10): the most yass and slay song about drunk dialing your ex

**SFbby** (10): The soundtrack of a million heartbroken 20 something year olds

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Yes the riff sounds like that one song from Polar Express but in spite of that it’s a bop!

**Victerade** (10): amazing sequel to we ride loved it sm

**welcome2thejam** (10): With the amount of drinking mentioned in this song, I'm glad it's not After We Drive

**YeyeDumpling** (10): The 11 was between this and I Know I Love You...I chose I Know I Love You but this HURTS I want to give them both 11s

**ebooks#5454** (9.8): omg this is so cute and fun (minus the undertone being really sad)

**Kayaking11116** (9.5): this song is so fun, i love like every second of it, but i love the melody in the chorus slightly less than everything else. besides that its amazing

**paigama** (9.5): brave girls' best song. was a 5 at release

**rslashpoopheads** (9.5): this song deserved so much better it's like the music equivalent of sparkles

**vhqv1997** (9.5): i can't believe they didn't perform this song during queendom but let rollin' be performed THREE times for three consecutive rounds

**bulforster** (9.3): looks like they are a car themed group @ We Ride smackdown banner

**aestheticen** (9): I have always liked this song but it only took me this rate to realise that I might have liked it more than I thought I did

**anothertown** (9): carly rae should get some kind of credit for this

**apatel27** (9): Call me basic but a synth breakup track is always gonna slap

**celladonn** (9): So good

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): the drama... the way this is gonna slay me tomorrow night

**HoshiLock** (9): I think this song deserve more recognition

**mayolizard** (9): slay

**omgthenerve** (9): this sounds like a song that would play over the ending credits of an early 90s coming of age movie, and I don't mind it at all

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): if we ride is so good why isnt there a we ride tw…oh

**xxipil0ts** (9): - can we normalize making dream pop-esque sounds in k-pop?

**BasedButta** (8.5): definition of pleasant - in a good way, not in a boring way

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): me after 1 sip of vodka

**orbiteezus** (8.5): my favorite brave girls song i’ve heard, it sounds so cozy and it feels like it could be in a montage for a coming of age movie

**ricki** (8.5): they heard lovesick girls and said "want to try to make this but better".... and they did

**sabooyah** (8.5): so fun love this kind of sound for them

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): they just make bops and i love them for that

=====

2021inKPOP: **bespectacIed** (8): euphoric! synthwave is hard to not make a bop with. i still prefer we ride

**bluetriangles04** (8): Was I expecting this after Chi Mat Ba Ram? Not at all. Will you see me complaining? No... I'm a hoe for synthpop and a sucker for every song that sounds like this. Is that sad? Yeah, kinda... But you won't catch me slipping!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): they said We Ride 2

**maybecrf** (8): banger

**mimins** (8): love the connection to we ride! also very pretty and airy

**runaway3212** (8): brave girls proving there's value in them not disbanding

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): vote for the anime rate

**tiltheendoftheline** (8): omg this is so good? I didn't get the Rollin thing so I didn't check out their new music. Im ashamed.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): more songs should acknowledge that we live in a world that was permanently altered by Rihanna's signature song We Ride

**whoisValensi** (8): "After We Ride (or How I Drunk-Dialed My Ex)" isn't as catchy of a title I suppose.

**Cooler\_lin** (7.9): doesn't touch we ride at all but i like the instrumental a lot

**sarcasticsobs** (7.9): Bright synths! Funky-ish guitar! It’s sweet!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.6): I feel like this has more potential to be better

**Jhe116** (7.5): We Ride is better but this is cute

**CrimsonROSET** (7): spelling IS fun

**DraculaWeekend** (7): Sounds like a CRJ b-side

**jasannn** (7): One of those songs that I should love but it is a tad too cleanly produced and on the nose that it turns me away

**melody** (7): I loves the 80s vibes

**milkywayinradius** (7): reminds me of CRJ especially at the verses and prechorus

**MToms** (7): Probably wouldn't listen to this again, but watch Spotify recommend it until I love it.

**skargardin** (7): Not their strongest title

**vayyiqra** (7): It's a pretty okay new wave-ish song, kind of background music energy but I like it.

**moonshxne** (6.5): i understand the sentiment - i really do – but god i hate the vocal production here

**BaconShoes** (6): a fun lil bop, but I don’t have a strong desire to relisten

**frogaranaman** (6): "this sounds like Blinding Lights" shut up!! an industry built on maximizing profits wants a song to sound like the most popular song in our lifetimes? shocking. we brought this upon ourselves

**wavingwolves** (6): what are you talking about brave girls... this is actually after ring x ring.... we ride isn't even in this rate...

**pig-serpent** (5.9): A Little lifeless but the synths sound nice

**Zypker125** (5.6): The song’s lyrics about drinking are accurate because this song make me want to drink myself into oblivion.

**LilacDaffodils** (5): I love Brave girls I repeated Rollin when it came out, had deepend on loop, and high heels too. So I will admit I don't love this song but it does feel like the point in the movie where the characters are happy and doing ok and probably hanging out on a beach or something, and I am so unbelievably happy for them that they get their movie moment.

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.5): and when this goes out at #47 just like exid’s i love you did in smackdown, another song by hags about getting drunk and calling your ex

**2dina3dworld** (4): but what was before they rode?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): This is just kinda loud.

**DaBigBoi** (4): Just kinda boring

**IsaiahTB0** (3): This is so tired. I like the group but this song is just boring. The autotune'd vocals, the cheap video. Its a no from me.

**moonagenightmares** (2): wow the blandest 80s pop influence in a kpop song in 2021 how fun

**sage** (1): literally one of the most bland songs ive ever heard.. having we ride in the title was a disgrace to that song

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): Love Month is more of my jush. For someone who played the hell out of the Soul Lady album, this just doesn’t hit the peaks of her discography! But she invented being mother so I can’t give her anything lower than this

---

**Gonza\_90** (11): If YUKIKA has millions of fans, I am one of them. If YUKIKA has a thousand fans, I am one of them. If YUKIKA has only one fan, that is me. If YUKIKA has no fans, that means I am no longer alive. If the world is against YUKIKA, I'm against the world. I love YUKIKA 'till my last breath.

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): I think K-pop fandom culture compels me to 11 the artist I stan (also vote for the city pop rate)

**2dina3dworld** (10): okay go off citypop queen!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): I just find it funny that the only japanese soloist in this rate didn't even sing the only japanese song lol. Anyways back to the mother, the iconic indie slayer... Yukika can't and still has not done wrong. 90% of kpop doesn't have a record in their sleeves as good as soul lady and timeabout,

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is just so nice and pretty. Sometimes I just want nice and pretty.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is gonna get robbed on like day 2 when it deserves top 5 for the bass alone!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): she’s just like me

**maybecrf** (10): i dont know if im cool enough to listen to this song tbh

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): never misses

**raggedy-princess** (10): the poor sleep hygiene anthem I've waited for

**RandomHypnotica** (10): all my fellow insomniatics raise your hand (metaphorically I know you don't have the energy)

**ricki** (10): yukika is the carly rae jepsen of kpop

**vayyiqra** (10): Hoping this isn't our only chance to rate Yukika since she is one of my favourite Kpop artists and basically doesn't miss. This isn't one of my top songs by her but I like it a lot and practically had a breakdown finishing this rate this week and was up for almost 48 hours at one point so I feel that's a sign to 10 this!

**whoisValensi** (10): I'm a simple man, I see YUKIKA and I throw 10s at her like it's my third job.

**IsaiahTB0** (9.6): Really great production, relaxing track. Great song idk what else to say.

**mayolizard** (9.5): yass slay

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): oh this is gorg

**seanderlust** (9.5): this sounds like it's off the paradise killer soundtrack, which i am famously a huge fan of

**bluetriangles04** (9): this song makes me so sad every time I listen to it, and although it very much gives off the usual city-pop "floating" vibe, I feel like you can really hear the emotion behind her voice here and the lyrics talking about being stagnant in your life while being caught up on somebody else from the past... I find the song really beautiful and am glad to see it being rated.

**Cooler\_lin** (9): this is a song I would definitely do some work to, easy listening with very nice instrumentals

**coolfluffle** (9): can't go wrong with some city pop

**PSSST12** (9): her previous material are still superior but this is good.

**Qwilphish** (9): the queen of city pop has come back again to serve a city pop bop

**skargardin** (9): I lowkey want another midtempo serve like this from her again

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Funny it’s called Insomnia cause this sounds like a dream (sorry I know that comment was lame)

**vhqv1997** (9): i'm sorry but the hosts truly set her up like why would you put her next to all these kpop groups lol

**welcome2thejam** (9): More YUKIKA city pop goodness? Don't mind if I do!

**Victerade** (8.8): super solid

**sarcasticsobs** (8.3): ”Love Month” superior, but I will always support her

**2l82bstr8** (8): this is cute background music, I would've given it a 10 if it was just the instrumental

**aestheticen** (8): This is definitely a song that (ironically) will help with my insomnia

**apatel27** (8): She has a nice voice

**BaconShoes** (8): a cute jam

**fadedblue09** (8): I mean it's illegal to dislike citypop…i think

**mimins** (8): very relaxing, feels like a fairy tale

**MToms** (8): maybe I really like funky bass (are all the songs I like the same?)

**orbiteezus** (8): i was fucking obsessed with soul lady and while i dont like this as much its still great and im excited for the rest of her music

**runaway3212** (8): me finishing this rate at 2 am be like

**sliced-peaches** (8): i firmly believe yukika invented music

2021inKPOP: **SkylarV** (7.9): Not a bad song at all but I wish we were rating Loving You instead

**celladonn** (7.5): Lovely vibes!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): the way this doesn’t even have 1 mil views on youtube…oh she’s a FLOP flop

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): i really loved soul lady but idk this mini never really clicked with me unfortunately, like it's good but could've been better

**bulforster** (7.2): this is really nice when it's on but I kind of forget about it when it's not

**ilyyyyy** (7): is this the city pop queen i've been hearing about. definitely hear it in the music, don't love her voice though

**jay duh** (7): i keep forgetting she's in the rate

**moonagenightmares** (7): bumping this up a point because the mv looks gay

**ebooks#5454** (6.9): called insomnia but we're kinda ending on a snoozer here

**DaBigBoi** (6.5): Keep Yukika AWAY from the RateYourMusic bros

**agentofscranton** (6): i feel like once you've heard one yukika song you've heard all of them

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i feel like i leave a ‘me finishing the rate at 5am’ comment too often

**Kayaking11116** (6): her voice is so nice and calming uwu. i just unfortunately have a hard time getting into slower music, but if she has faster songs i am interested

**BasedButta** (5): naaaaah this is her weakest song, and that feels way worse in this case because every other song of hers is pretty much this but… way better. it’s not really that bad but, in context, ugh

**rslashpoopheads** (4): bawring

**sabooyah** (4): this song wants to be plastic love so bad

**chancehugs** (3): Same issue with Yuri's Glassy - she sounds out of breath the entire song. Which is weird cos she sounds lovely in Soul Lady.

**Zypker125** (1.4): Ironic song name given how much this song makes me want to go to sleep.

**aestheticen** (10): Does it sound like Say So/Kiss Me More? Yes. Do I care? No.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): I CAN DO WHATEVER I WAAAANT

**coolfluffle** (10): fantastic song, loved this era a lot

**ImADudeDuh** (10): we love neo-disco that isnt produced by dr puke

**jay duh** (10): yawn ate wtf

**Kadenfrost** (10): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAuPfCX3unM&ab_channel=gukbapboi]

**maybecrf** (10): vibes through the roof

**NotWith10000Men** (10): i'm a slut for a groovy guitar riff

**Qwilphish** (10): the queen came to show everyone how to do summer. I love how pink the music video is, it's so cute and her outfits are so cute. Love everything about this song

**rslashpoopheads** (10): when all the other pop rap girlies raced to release their own Say So but Taeyeon beat them all by like an entire year

**runaway3212** (10): this is relaxation is a bottle. it feels like you're being massaged by a god and everytime she touches your skin it's positive affirmations

**vayyiqra** (10): Taeyeon is very hit or miss for me and I didn't like every track on INVU, but this was one I did like a lot.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): skylar spence's influence knows no bounds

**Tazzachar** (9.5): like the way this song just actually gets you in the mood for the weekend

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): she gets it like … i CAN do whatever i want on the weekend

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.2): any day can be a weekend if you skip class <3

**2l82bstr8** (9): this is no "INVU" but it's pretty great too that whole album is pretty amazing

**bigbigbee** (9): user ReallyCreative once called Up No More by Twice “cruelty-free Say So”. This is cruelty-free Kiss Me More. also she looks like the medicine seller from Mononoke in this MV

**bluetriangles04** (9): TAEYEON MAIN RAPPER

**DefaultPophead** (9): Taeyeon babe, you get a nine. Yes, I'm still under a trance from Taemin before you, but you sound gorgeous.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I hear a mildly disco beat and I floor it!

**mayolizard** (9): a cute bop

**metanoira** (9): i'd say that almost everything else on the invu album was better but this still bops for being a kmm ripoff

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): A SMASH HIT!

**skargardin** (9): I really don't get the hate towards this?!

**LilacDaffodils** (8.9): so breezy and summery and lovely

**sage** (8.7): one of her only good songs

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): if Calvin Harris is smart then I expect TAEYEON on Funk Wav Bounces Vol, 2

**jasannn** (8.5): As much I think is really basic and trend-chasing, Taeyeon nailed the concept and I keep pressing the replay button.

**bulforster** (8.4): I'm sorry, the say so comparisons simply don't hold water because this is a good song while say so blows.

**apatel27** (8): Floating on air

**bespectacIed** (8): Dojaeyeon Cat bubblegum cutesiness

**chancehugs** (8): This is my lazy weekend soundtrack.

**Cooler\_lin** (8): this song is so fun and light, if I didn't work on the weekends it would hit so much more

**DaBigBoi** (8): I used to like Lilac more at one point, but the magical properties of the mother lake suddenly activated one day

**ilyyyyy** (8): nice, chill.

**IsaiahTB0** (8): A cute bop (INVU cleared)

**Kayaking11116** (8): this song has a cute summer vibe once again and overall good vibes

**mimins** (8): it took me a hot minute to like this song but I get it now

**pig-serpent** (8): Generic discoy dance pop but I like the sound decently enough.

**ricki** (8): me treating myself to a chill and relaxing weekend after a busy week of running away from my responsibilities

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): im going into this rate with almost no idea of who’s considered the front runners so i’m just gonna assume this is the most likely winner and if im wrong don’t correct me

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): Doja Cat who?

**welcome2thejam** (8): Perfectly unmaddening retro style pop: nothing more, nothing less

**poemforsmallthings** (7.9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_cnK8Cd6Ag&ab_channel=Steadfast

**ebooks#5454** (7.5): this place is great, its whimsical and fun!!

**sabooyah** (7.5): cute and fun and reminds me of the feel of older apink songs

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): Maybe a little mid Tayeon for my tastes, but cute enough and nicely produced. Nice to drive or ride a bike to, it does its job

**BaconShoes** (7): kind of bopping

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is nothing too special but it’s very very pleasant.

**bookthieving** (7): how to stream doja cat without financially supporting dr. luke

**tiltheendoftheline** (7): this is very catchy but it's obviously a Doja Cat copy.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Who turned on the motion blur

**celladonn** (6.5): Pleasant but really forgettable

**wavingwolves** (6.3): was ended by iu btw

**melody** (6): it's cute but nothing amazing.

**PSSST12** (6): Sorry queen, but this is too generic for you. INVU outsold and cleared with ease.

**moonagenightmares** (5.6): almost every other song on the album is better than this

**moonshxne** (5.4): I didn’t like Doja Cat’s Hot Pink either

**fadedblue09** (5): Hani & LE did it better

**orbiteezus** (5): i mean thankfully its not a ballad but if i wanted to listen to say so i’d listen to say so

**vhqv1997** (5): who put what in the water last year that made every female soloist suddenly want to rap?

**thedoctordances1940** (4.2): i've partially got over my tiredness for that summery guitar tone but it's still somewhat there at least

**whoisValensi** (4): I will never find happiness again in a post-"Say So” musical landscape. I'm just surprised this was shoehorned onto 'INVU'. Tho I suppose I shouldn't be so surprised considering what happened to my girl HYO. Even if 'DEEP' was released months after 'INVU'... Anyways kids what is ur favorite song from 'INVU' and why is it "Toddler"?

**akanewasright** (3.1): this is just say so without the energy that made say so a hit

**MassiveThief** (3): legitimitely just sounds like a Say So/Kiss Me More mashup

**Zypker125** (1.4): I didn’t realize weekends were this slow and snoozeworthy.

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): Really cute! It’d sell well if STAYC recorded it I think

---

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (11): i don’t have high hopes for this on the rate but i’d be lying if i said it wasn’t one of the best 2021 k-pop releases. i never paid much attention to cherry bullet before this song, but randomly clicking on the music video for this song was the best choice i made last year. they just turned something deceptively simple into a 3 minutes and 8 seconds sugar rush - listening to this just gives me a burst of adrenaline! i was obsessed with this song for two months for good reasons! would have been my 11 if it hadn’t been for another song…. (edit: it’s my 11 now <3)

**imasalesman** (11): iconic amazing

**TiltControls** (11): Oh wow this is everything

**aestheticen** (10): Remember the K-pop takedown on Spotify last year? I was suffering so hard because this song got removed that it compelled me to illegally download it knowing damn well the songs will be up again in like a day

**agentofscranton** (10): the cherry girls deserve everything

**anothertown** (10): the anti drop is sooooo good

**BasedButta** (10): still don’t know why this is so good but it just is

**bespectacIed** (10): 2021 SOTY, and I am willing to go to war for this opinion. Yes, it's THAT fucking serious. The Love Bomb/ Oh My Mistake of 4th gen, the mega smash hit that got away. Pop perfection in every note, every second. Cherry Bullet deserved everything after releasing this, we need their fromis9ification blow up, pleaaaaase. I am officially rooting for this to win

**bluetriangles04** (10): ARE YOU KIDDING ME??????? This song coming from Cherry Bullet hit me completely out of nowhere. After the disappointment that was Aloha Oe and the fact that three of their members just up and blipped from the group out of nowhere, Love So Sweet was one of my favorite releases up to that point last year and it was for a reason. I had previously considered that Q&A, their incredibly amazing debut, would unfortunately be the peak of enjoyment for me music wise because... well, it's FNC. I didn't have any expectations, and so this track was love at first sight for me.

**celladonn** (10): Really hits the sweet spot

**chenle** (10): YASS & SLAY!!!!!

**jay duh** (10): cherry bullet was broke, disbandment looming over their late on the rent dorm, they had a budget of $5 and a DREAM. Bora knew what needed to be done in that recording booth.

**Jhe116** (10): Love So Sweet to Cherry Bullet is like Oh! My Mistake to April

**maybecrf** (10): absolute banger, unquestionable 10

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): one of the most underrated songs from last year!! my dorm room became a concert hall when this song came on

**Qwilphish** (10): this song deserved SO much better. perfectly clean while being completely unique. Love the MV concept so much. I think the outro goes on for too long, but everything else is perfection

**RandomHypnotica** (10): BE SWEET TO ME BABY

**Roxieloxie** (10): This has all stars fave written all over it

**skargardin** (10): YAAAAS

**sliced-peaches** (10): im FIGHTING the urge to give this song my eleven

**whoisValensi** (10): There's a high chance I have whistled that fucking whistle uhhhhh drop? post-chorus? whatever you wanna call it, in my sleep. Anyways, I can and will crack my voice attempting to hit the notes in this song.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): so infectious!

**alwayswords** (9): valentine’s day classic

**BaconShoes** (9): ooh i hadn’t heard this but it slapped

**Kadenfrost** (9): Nugu queens deserves more recognition challenge. What a refreshing and cute song.

**orbiteezus** (9): v v cute, the beat almost feels trippy at some points but yeah lovely song

**PSSST12** (9): NOW. This is a banger. Love bomb if its a little bit sweeter me thinks.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): the whistling in this song sounds like the smash bros version of tom nook’s theme

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): There’s like this really subtle choral progression thing during the “20db” part and the chorus, and idk how to explain it but it makes it sound like so strange and futuristic-y and it makes me love the song all the more… I hope I’m not talking out of my ass rn lol

**vhqv1997** (9): kpop is really that simple, like just do this, i don't know why these companies struggle so much

**Zypker125** (8.8): There’s a sound effect at 0:40 of this song that both sounds like a goat and also sounds like my brother calling my name from the room next to mine. Also, it’s probably my pick for rate winner, I kinda view it as the Love Bomb of its year (niche girl-group song that’s a hit with Reddit).

**SkylarV** (8.2): Great song, the end carries on for one iteration too long for my taste though

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): would be better without the anticlimactic drop

**Cooler\_lin** (8): i blame user youngerdays on youtube...

**ilyyyyy** (8): really good, don't love the whistling though

**mayolizard** (8): post chorus is not it for me sorry </3

**MToms** (8): This gives me Love Bomb vibes, I predict a good outcome. Hot take, I'm not the biggest fan of Bo Ra's voice D:

**paigama** (8): a bop. some of the vocals at the end can sound a bit whiny though

**ricki** (8): who will place higher, love so sweet in the rate or kim bora in gp999

**vayyiqra** (8): I think I like this but can never remember how it goes.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Immensely iffy on that whistly part, but the rest is pretty great

2021inKPOP: **ignitethephoenix** (7.5): it’s fine

**LilacDaffodils** (7.5): At the beginning of every year I get into a kpop funk where I toss myself into a tizzy convincing myself I am not going to like kpop in the current year and inevitably some song breaks me out of it. This was my song for 2021. Thank you,Cherry Bullet.

**milkywayinradius** (7.5): i usually don't like the cute gg concepts but this is really cute and fun.

**sarcasticsobs** (7.3): Not too into the prechorus, but enjoyed the rest enough. Kinda sparse but I liked that aspect

**wavingwolves** (7.1): cute moment

**CrimsonROSET** (7): sweet sweet bitch

**flavasavavandal** (7): kinda wish it went a tad harder

**hikkaru** (7): love in space coming to slay 2022 kpop

**moonshxne** (7): cute!

**pig-serpent** (7): Generic Kpop done right.  The chorus is a bit of a letdown but the verses are very good.

**DaBigBoi** (6.5): I always knew you slayed Bora

**Kayaking11116** (6.5): i’m not totally vibing with the main melody in the chorus which sucks because i really like everything else about the song

**mimins** (6.5): I would like this song a lot more if the vocals were just slightly lower but I think it's alright

**chancehugs** (6): There's just something missing to truly elevate this song.

**ebooks#5454** (6): their outfits look like the Cider ads i get on instagram

**frogaranaman** (6): instrumental sounds like an Ultra Mainstage ID from someone like Alesso that will never see the light of day

**moonagenightmares** (6): i kept expecting this to turn into love bomb

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): i mean it’s cute but a smasha it is not

**runaway3212** (6): boring but not bad

**2l82bstr8** (5.5): i never got this one at all. I guess it's cute?

**sage** (5.2): the whistling.... jumpscare

**IsaiahTB0** (5): Its fine but there's like 10 songs in the rate that sound exactly like this

**NotWith10000Men** (5): i liked the beginning a lot but it got worse as it went on into the chorus

**sabooyah** (5): average

**thedoctordances1940** (4.4): i don't really like what i've heard of cherry bullet it's just consistently bored me

**apatel27** (4): It's an edm Ed Sheeran song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Song so mid. I do not like that whistling.

**LesApfels** (4): The chorus is so underwhelming

**rslashpoopheads** (4): Laboum at home

**Tazzachar** (3): pretty forgettable

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Those 5 seconds before the chorus already deserve a 10

---

**ernie** (11): (one of the best debuts of 2021 hands DOWN! this song is so fucking addictive it never gets tiring….)

**akanewasright** (10): not quite, but pretty close

**anothertown** (10): i just thought it was the best song i'd ever heard

**bespectacIed** (10): a bombastic debut, idgaffff. This blew me away kinda, because I was tempering my high expectations for the first post-izone group. And then this slay was born wow... Liz killed me and caught me in her net, shout out to the Liz biases out therr

**bigbigbee** (10): 📸 oh yeah. that one’s going in my perfect debuts compilation

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): how many people made the obvious joke im interested in seeing that

**cosmicneve** (10): Girl group debut perfection.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Best song about 7/11

**jasannn** (10): love dive is nowhere even close as good as this. sorry popheads

**jay duh** (10): yall need to shut the fuck up and let my nieces speak.

**mayolizard** (10): catchy as FAWK

**cherryices** (9.7): altered the servature of the earth

**coolfluffle** (9.5): possibly the strongest debut ive ever watched, steering a separate way to most gen 4 ggs

**DirtyRat583** (9.5): this song will either get 15 11s or 2

**TiltControls** (9.5): you make me feel like almost giving an 11

**LilacDaffodils** (9.3): Revolutionary and game changing

**bluetriangles04** (9): Super solid debut for IVE that made me really anticipate their future sound! Seeing that we got LOVE DIVE as their first comeback, I can only imagine that from here on out that they are in good hands music direction wise and I can't wait for them to get a proper mini album down the road.

**chancehugs** (9): Sadly not my 11, but still a strong bop.

**DefaultPophead** (9): How many were tempted to eleven this song lol

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): obligatory #notmyeleven comment

**IsaiahTB0** (9): Catchy, big debut song. Love Dive cleared it a bit tho.

**melody** (9): IVE came onto the scene with a catchy kpop song, going outside girl crush was a great move.

**nicolas** (9): me when they ask me what score i gave to SAVAGE by aespa

**poemforsmallthings** (9): I hope someone 11s this just for the joke

**ricki** (9): you're giving this song an 11 and making a joke about the song being named eleven? omg that is so funny, you're so funny, im laughing so hard at that joke, you're hilarious, you should be a comedian, no clue how i didnt think of that before, it's actually so so so funny omg...

**skargardin** (9): This has finally clicked for me omg

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): not the 11 but at least they tried

**tiltheendoftheline** (9): I don't even know how this is divisive?

**vhqv1997** (9): i hope we don't get some dumb "this song doesn't/does feel like an 11" comments but i'm lowering my score for this song in case we do

**aestheticen** (8.5): Liz was serving so hard in this. Serve score was 11/10 (haha get it)

**MassiveThief** (8.5): chorus has been stuck in my head for DAYS

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): I must regretfully admit that this song is a banger

**Cooler\_lin** (8.3): the melody in the vocals especially in the pre-chorus is so pretty and catchy, i wish the instrumentals gave a bit more tho

**wavingwolves** (8.1): legendary queens from the get go... not everyone has this level of power...

**2l82bstr8** (8): do you think this is gonna win bc everyone's gonna rate it 11 ironically

**BasedButta** (8): first listen you’ll love it but damn if it doesn’t get old… I wish it didn’t but it’s still pretty good. I like the percussion a lot

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Tempting but I’m going with an 8.

**DaBigBoi** (8): Apologizing to ANNYEONGZ rn for not giving them my 11

**ImADudeDuh** (8): i’m gonna make sure i have the seinfeld music ready when I read all the jokes related to giving this an 11

**Kadenfrost** (8): Okay debut but kind of subdued, Love Dive outsold

**MToms** (8): This is a safe debut song, which worked wonders for them. Safe but not as bland as Le Sserafim. Also, insert 11 joke.

**PSSST12** (8): A little bit generic for a debut but nevertheleess a catchy tune! Aged a bit though not gonnna lie.

**Stryxen** (8): they really wanted their 11s… come on girls this name is desperate

2021inKPOP: **xxipil0ts** (8): - you make me feel like 7/11 amirite? haha.

**yatcho** (8): kind of empty for the most part BUT that HOOK

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): put me with all the other comments about not giving this an 11

**paigama** (7.7): meh in the first listen, good in the 2nd, got tired of listening to it after the 10th time

**BaconShoes** (7.5): not an 11 but a bop

**mimins** (7.5): super catchy but feels like its missing something

**seanderlust** (7.5): no IVE that's not what i'm giving you you will take a 7.5 and you will like it!!

**sage** (7.4): can we guess how many comments will make a joke about the title

**CrimsonROSET** (7): well the joke is right there

**Kayaking11116** (7): Its super addicting but also lowkey a basic pop song

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): 1 2 3 4 5 6 11…you make me feel like 7

**moonshxne** (7): i mean they counted up to seven for us (...literally it’s just fine)

**plastichaxan** (7): is this bait to get 11s as a joke omg

**runaway3212** (7): this chorus is so dumb but the rest slaps

**sarcasticsobs** (7): The most startling juxtaposition between the prechorus and chorus in the whole rate

**welcome2thejam** (7): investigate Ive Eleven

**whoisValensi** (7): Everyone who gave this an 11 is getting shocked by my taser on the count of 11! Anyways this is a fun lil debut song. I do personally really like "Love Dive" a LOT more than this. But upon coming back to it, this is fine I guess. The slow down before going into the chorus is so goddamn iconic tho. Like if ur debut song is gonna have some sorta like memorable trick to it, that was such a fun and unexpected one to pick.

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): no but does this not sound like it could used a opening for a kratt brothers show

**SkylarV** (6.5): Anyone who gives this song an 11 was successfully psyops'd by the song

**thedoctordances1940** (6.1): jealous of the people that love this enough to give it their 11

**ebooks#5454** (6): would've been a seven make them feel like eleven but no

**Jhe116** (6): I’ll go harsher on this one because they can redeem themselves with Love Dive next year

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): you make me feel like six

**celladonn** (5.5): I don't really get the hype for this

**maybecrf** (5.5): its fine, but im bored

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): can't decide if i want to make a rate score joke or a stranger things joke for this song

**hikkaru** (5): FIVE

**pig-serpent** (5): Bad transitions and wild cultural appropriation are some of the most fun aspects of kpop.  This does not mean I’ll be giving songs with them high scores.

**sabooyah** (5): this kind of sounds like shinee atlantis in parts? also I wish there were more instruments or something, the instrumental feels so empty for most of the song and the vocal melody isn't enough to cover it up

**vayyiqra** (5): This is okay this despite having one of my pet peeves (random tempo changes). Kind of feel nothing for it though, although I've now been told it was quite popular. insert joke about how this is not getting my 11, rofl how original

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): 4 3 2 1 see I can count too

**bulforster** (4.9): the title is such a cheap rate tactic smh

**Zypker125** (4.7): Take a shot for every rater who gives this song an 11 and references the song name as a pun. I haven’t understood the love for any of IVE’s songs.

**orbiteezus** (4.5): while i don’t really hate this song there’s a bunch of parts that are really unpleasant to me, mostly the part right before the chorus but i don’t really enjoy the instrumental at all even though some of the vocal melodies are nice enough

**NotWith10000Men** (4): don't like the slowdown

**apatel27** (3): "Oh shit we need a fast paced chorus let me put one together real quick"

**ilyyyyy** (3): dislike the empty beginning, typically i enjoy a nice build up and a change in tempo but this is not working for me

**Qwilphish** (2): This song was such a disappointment for such a hyped group. I really don't like any aspect of this song besides the bridge

**Roxieloxie** (1): this is an 10 but 7 ate 9 :(

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Definitely love when guys go deeper than the ocean! Such kings. This should’ve been a few spots higher. It’s pop perfection.

---

**2l82bstr8** (10): it's a SHINee song (complimentary)

**BaconShoes** (10): wooahh this was a smash omg

**bespectacIed** (10): My dads still standing tall and serving while their contemporaries both inside and outside SM are long gone lol i love these 4 so much. BANGER. Vocals visuals production topnotch

**bigbigbee** (10): feel like this DEFINITELY should have been the comeback song- feels much more to me like a “SHINee” song and I think it would have done better as their big comeback from the Key/Minho/Onew army duty break.

**cherryices** (10): thank you shinee for raising awareness of rising sea levels and overfishing

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): YES!!! YES!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): why was the first thing I thought of when I saw this title is the Tom Holland fancast for Milo in an live action Atlantis. Also this song is great.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): even bridgit mendler is shaking

**IsaiahTB0** (10): ITS LIKE WE ARE UNDER WATER.... UNDER WATERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

**Kadenfrost** (10): That chorus goes deep frrrrrr

**Kayaking11116** (10): MY LOVE GOES DEEP DEEP DEEP FOR THIS SONG. OH MY GOD THEY DID THAT. THE HARMONIES AND THE HIGH NOTES AND THE ACCIDENTALS

**melody** (10): now this is a masterpiece.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): *twerking* it's like we're underwater

**Qwilphish** (10): SHINee are the blueprint. They're showing the children they still got it almost 15 years later. Kings of concepts, I love the underwater / aquarium aesthetic that got going on

**skargardin** (10): YAAS

**sliced-peaches** (10): shinee ocean kings

**thedoctordances1940** (10): just make cool arpeggiated synths and i'll eat the song up

**vayyiqra** (10): A recurring theme in this rate seems to be boygroups who make songs with awesome choruses that elevate the song a lot.

**whoisValensi** (10): Minho came, Minho saw, Minho conquered Atlantis.

**celladonn** (9.5): Classic SHINee! Vocals and instrumental are both fantastic here

**chenle** (9.5): possibly the best minho rap in their entire discography???

**mimins** (9.5): quintessential shinee song we love to hear it!!!

**bulforster** (9.3): that bass synth goes all the way off for the chorus

**anothertown** (9): wtf okay they chomped

**apatel27** (9): Classic sound never misses

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I would have given this a 10 if someone had busted out a Milo Thatch cosplay in the music video.

**orbiteezus** (9): the instrumental for the chorus sounds really cool, in general this song was fun from the first listen and the strings were a nice touch too, shinee is always good vocally so nothing to say there

**tiltheendoftheline** (9): I adore this so much, my favorite part is probably Minho's rap with all the SSSSSS

**Victerade** (9): amazing

**sarcasticsobs** (8.9): Obsessed with the chorus, my god, vocals and beat. Not *so* much with the rap beat switch, but it’s not *egregious*. Rain scene!

**aestheticen** (8.5): SING THE SHIT OUT OF THAT NOTE KEY!!!!

**Cooler\_lin** (8.5): love the harmonies and the guitar rift but surprisingly i like this song less than don't call me!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): just swim up then????

**ebooks#5454** (8): how tf do they look so young i thought this group was old huh

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): i should listen to this more bc it really is a slay tbh

**PSSST12** (8): catchy enough, but still not up to par with their discography.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): it’s like we are underwater he says as he is dancing in the underwater set

**welcome2thejam** (8): Wish these ocean mans would take me by the hand, lead me to the land that they understand

**moonshxne** (7.9): This had to have started out as an Onew solo, right?? Regardless, this really should’ve been an Onew solo (maybe they can keep Minho’s corny rap) because every time he opens his mouth, this song is an 11. It’s like this was written for Onew’s vocal range only, and produced/mixed to fit Onew’s vocal tone perfectly, because poor Taemin and Key are literally blowing out their vocal cords trying to belt those high notes (especially in the first verse, and Taemin actually sounds a lot better in the bridge) AND literally sound like they’re underwater. This is kinda also why I didn’t really enjoy Key’s “BAD LOVE” as much as I should’ve (because by releasing a song in that genre i’m inevitably gonna subconsciously think of Abel Tesfaye, who post-Starboy is like the king of sounding light and effortless), though he sounds a lot more strained and screechy here. See also: notice how much more comfortable and assured everyone sounds on “Don’t Call Me”?

**NotWith10000Men** (7.8): who's singing the "it's like we're underwater" etc part? he's got a very distinctive voice

**BasedButta** (7.5): this sounds like it would be a perfect kpop song, but it’s missing something idk

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.3): cute! the production rlly scratches my brain

**hikkaru** (7): and bridgit mendler?

**ilyyyyy** (7): it's fine, a little generic. don't love the rapping

**rslashpoopheads** (7): knowing reddit this will probably somehow win the rate but I won't neg it just because of that

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this score should be lower honestly but i can’t not love any song with an ocean inspired theme

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Normally I don’t like seafood but

**chancehugs** (6): The verses kinda outshine the chorus.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): river deep mountain high

**maybecrf** (6): zzzz

**pig-serpent** (6): I love the name Atlantis but that set my expectations too high for this mediocre song.

**sabooyah** (6): just ok no matter how much i want to be biased and give this a 10

**mayolizard** (5): forgettable i fear

**Zypker125** (3.7): The song title is accurate because much like the City of Atlantis, I’m Lost as to why people like this song.

**flavasavavandal** (3): nothing really comes together on this song, the opening/closing guitar playing feels like it came straight from another song idea, the chorus is just not catchy and SHINee are just shouting it in the hopes it might stick in your head, and the lingering syllable of “iss” on the rap verse makes me feel uncomfortable, maybe Atlantis should’ve stayed hidden from them

**moonagenightmares** (3): the chorus bores me so much

**jay duh** (2): sits down

**runaway3212** (1): why does the deep sound like a 5 year old is singing it

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): Yes!! Racism is cured

---

**Islands** (11): Idk if i’ll get tired of this its just the freshest song ever with many of my favorite influences in pop

**jay duh** (11): dont get me started.

**Qwilphish** (11): I don't know what they infused this song with but its so addictive. Singing along with the chorus is so fun, and the aesthetics of the MV are so good. I wish I could think of what more to say about this song, but I find it extremely special to me and I will cherish its existence forever! STAYC GIRLS.... ITS GOING DOWN!

**rotating3Dtext** (11): this has some perfect melodies and gets stuck in my head often

**aestheticen** (10): QUEENS OF ERADICATING DISCRIMINATION!!! SLAYC FOR PRESIDENT!!!!

**anothertown** (10): j is giving queen bee with that blonde bob

**bulforster** (10): I'm p whelmed by all the other stayc title tracks but this chorus is undeniable, I think bc it relies much more on their vocals rather than the production.

**chancehugs** (10): This is so wistfully happy. Love Isa's vocals here.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): loooove this miami bass sound ugh it never gets old

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): THEE best bridge in any kpop song ever

**jasannn** (10): queens

**Kadenfrost** (10): Slay-C (2)

**kyrgyzzephyr** (10): when i die play isa’s isolated chorus at my funeral

**PSSST12** (10): THEIR BEST SONG. an 11 contender. Their most impactful "Stayc girls, its going down"

**RandomHypnotica** (10): which rate stereotype are you, I'm longsongphobic

**ricki** (10): forcing myself to leave a comment here because i predicted this to be the winner and i wanna be part of the post

**rslashpoopheads** (10): hot take this is the best STAYC song

**sarcasticsobs** (10): *(Don’t say the catchphrase, don’t say the catchphrase, don’t say the catchphrase)* Anyways, **너무 세게 안으면 숨 막혀요, 조금 서투를지도 난 아직도!!**

**sliced-peaches** (10): slayc

**Tazzachar** (10): genuinely one of the few slower tempo kpop songs I actually like

**wavingwolves** (10): we all got a little sapphicbaited by the mv teasers but everyone forgave them bc that's how good the song was

**poemforsmallthings** (9.7): SING ISA!!!

**DaBigBoi** (9.5): This pick-me anthem is like a lesser version of TT by TWICE, but that song is also one of the most well produced songs I’ve ever heard. So kudos to getting close!

**IsaiahTB0** (9.5): Thank you StayC girls for going down and hitting the slay betton.

**mayolizard** (9.5): super slay

**runaway3212** (9.5): STAYC GIRLS [slay whispering]

**ebooks#5454** (9.2): slay me with every "STAYCGIRLS its going down"

**bluetriangles04** (9): Isa's part in the final chorus??? SAY LESS.

**cofie** (9): not gonna act like I didnt spam this song alongside Queendom as well last year

**coolfluffle** (9): loved this one too, stayc have managed to embody some third generation characteristics in their songs which i adore

**maybecrf** (9): it all works for me

**melody** (9): It's so cute and preppy and poppy.

**pig-serpent** (9): STAYC is really good at making fairly ok songs that are made great because they have breakbeats in them, and I hope they never stop.

**vhqv1997** (9): this song was reaching a complete 11 for me and then suddenly they deleted half of the final chorus.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Why did they whisper the "it's going down" who are they trying to hide that from

**whoisValensi** (9): My motto in life is "STAYC GIRLS IT'S GOING DOWN" and I live by that. Truth be told I uhhh okay this is what I was talking about when I said that some of the post-"ASAP" comebacks have had to grow on me. Like, if you asked me to rate this song within the first month of it coming out I would have probably given it like a 4. As you can see that is a very wrong opinion. Because it is not that at all. ANYWAYS I CAN'T BELIEVE YOON IS THE ONLY GIRL TO FULLY ROCK A STAIR STEP HAIRCUT HOW DID SHE DO THAT?!?!?!?!?!?! (idek if that's the right like title for it, in my brain it's simply the Nu Abo style lolll)

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): it's no "So Bad" but it's adorable and has that kind of DnB-ish quality that permeates their work and I love it

**akanewasright** (8): this song is a mess but it’s stayc so I’ll let it slide

**vayyiqra** (8): look I'm having a hard time coming up with comments for this other than "it's cute" so: it's cute

2021inKPOP: **Zypker125** (7.8): Almost gets docked points for the lyrics being another “I’m not like other girls” song, but eh, if I can still shamelessly sing the lyrics to You Belong With Me, I can ignore the lyrics of this song.

**mimins** (7.5): forgettable but not bad

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): when the mv teaser for this made me think they were gonna pull a gaga and advance gay rights in korea >>>

**orbiteezus** (7.5): real pop music what can i say

**CrimsonROSET** (7): stacy girls its going down

**flavasavavandal** (7): lovely little infectious song that unfortunately never goes further into greatness

**ilyyyyy** (7): it's fine, pretty lowkey

**Kayaking11116** (7): its so cute and fun but i think i heard it a bit too much

**skargardin** (7): their weakest title so far i fear

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This is pretty hectic but also pretty good!

**apatel27** (6.5): Too much tartan. The song is nice tho

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Very cute but the hook isn’t quite there.

**moonshxne** (6): feel like i would enjoy it a lot more if red velvet performed this or something (that is to say, i feel like this is desperately missing some satisfying vocals because i think everyone sounds too clean?)

**BaconShoes** (5): kinda forgettable

**sabooyah** (5): average

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i cant help but compare both of the stayc songs in this rate to so bad which is probably one of my favorite kpop songs in recent memory and neither of these songs can even hope to be anywhere near as good as so bad is

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): feels incomplete to me

**Cooler\_lin** (4.8): seriously underwhelming, love the tag line tho, STAYC girls, its going down! XD (i say as i give this a bad score)

**celladonn** (4.5): This sounds messy to me

**vuemaurel** (3.5): Meh.

**moonagenightmares** (3): i forget what this sounds like the second it ends

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): There have been a lot of times that I’ve found this group to be overrated.. This is not one of those cases. The hook is phenomenal even if the other parts of the song aren’t quite as ecstatic.

---

**bulforster** (11): Yes they keep just remaking feel good, yes it slaps every time (watch out for my DM 11 next year!)

**SkylarV** (11): My SOTY for 2021, this new era of fromis we're in will always being trying to live up to THIS song, it's TOO good!!!

**2l82bstr8** (10): idk where we're going but let's keep going

**aestheticen** (10): Synth bass line! I am in love! My standards are so low!

**agentofscranton** (10): fromis' ascent to becoming a legitimately successful group after years in the nugu wilderness is so beautiful to me

**akanewasright** (10): fromis_9 has made this song a few times now, but this version of it in particular makes me happy…

**bespectacIed** (10): 11 CONTENDER. I contemplated turning into a flover after this release, I am dead serious. But I did become a casual fan. this was their turning point from nugus to respected industry bop machines that deserved the hybe funding. The song is flawless good fun, the MV is one of the favorites in kpop, I swear. So simple, creative, well executed, humorous, and timely. AND THEY FOLLOWED THIS UP WITH ANOTHER POP PERFECTION with DM. Queens. If this wins to avenge Love Bomb, I would be overjoyed.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh thank god I needed some serotonin.

**chancehugs** (10): The song took me away when I was stuck in lockdown, and I will forever be thankful. The choreo and MV are cute too.

**DaBigBoi** (10): I miss quirky fromis, but when it hits it hits

**jay duh** (10): theyve made the same song 14 times but if the formula isnt broke dont fix it!

**Kadenfrost** (10): they are frauds but they're Seventeen's sister group so its okay <3

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): best summer song of last year i'm so close to giving it my eleven

**PSSST12** (10): OK???? SING GIRLS. Like this is their best song after love bomb. Like it just hits.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i love this song, but whenever I read the title I instantly sing the chorus from kep1er up instead of this

**rslashpoopheads** (10): *seulgi voice* queens

**runaway3212** (10): Love bomb coming to win as6!!!

**welcome2thejam** (10): fromis came reeeeal close to getting my 11 again. Think this has been stuck in my head for days now

**ebooks#5454** (9.5): this m/v really appeals to my inner graphic design is my passion self

**paigama** (9.5): the queen of summer 2021

**Qwilphish** (9.5): they saved summer with this one

**TiltControls** (9.5): fromis_9.5

**apatel27** (9): It's a novel MV concept

**bluetriangles04** (9): A fun song channeling all of the pent up stir-craziness brought on by the pandemic. This era has a special place in my heart.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): best summer song of 2021 methinks….

**kyrgyzzephyr** (9): sparkling summer bop! fromis really have summer figured out huh

**skargardin** (9): They can't miss!

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): go off queens

**whoisValensi** (9): Not trying to be *that guy* but if my Photoshop worked like that I'd be a fucking millionaire known for my editing speed. Yes, this is a comment about the video which has fucking stellar editing. Seriously, the editing in the video is enough of a reason to give it a high score. But also the song is really fun! But I don't think you needed me to tell you that, just fucking LISTEN TO IT.

**yatcho** (9): cracked out but I love it

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): COME WITH ME NOOOOOOW

**anothertown** (8.5): ok but that rapid fire photoshop editing she was doing at the beginning of the video

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): it's no "love bomb" but it's still a bop

**BaconShoes** (8): good vibes :)

**coolfluffle** (8): such a fun summery song!

**ilyyyyy** (8): it's okay but it doesn't make me full with emotion to the point that my body can barely contain it like DKDK and love bomb did & that's the standard i'm holding it to heh

**Kayaking11116** (8): once again, feel good summer song with happy vibes, what’s not to love?

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): saerom and hayoung you will always be famous

**sliced-peaches** (8): cute fun song from cute fun girls luv it

**vayyiqra** (8): we move or whatever idk

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This is legit one of the best music videos I’ve ever seen

**Cooler\_lin** (7.9): love a summer-y gg song this one just doesn't stand out as much

**sarcasticsobs** (7.9): (Something vaguely, *vaguely* goes into the poppy city pop territory for at minimum 1 second): It’s a bop!

**wavingwolves** (7.9): she's a cute girl! a very very very girl!

**celladonn** (7.5): Very catchy

**hikkaru** (7.5): feel good >

**IsaiahTB0** (7.2): Fine track, falls under the same tired sound of the the 80s style tracks tho.

**BasedButta** (7): its good but its kinda repetitive it gives me anxiety idk

**CrimsonROSET** (7): best music video in the rate, hands down. Just wish the song was better too

**maybecrf** (7): a solid summer track

**mayolizard** (7): cute

**melody** (7): cute

**orbiteezus** (7): out of the fromis songs that all sound the same i’m partial to DM but this is still cute, very enjoyable summer song and the video is really fun too!

**pig-serpent** (7): One of the most 7/10 songs I’ve ever heard.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): I was so disappointed when this came out because I expect more exciting stuff from fromis

**MassiveThief** (6): catchy and fun but not very memorable

**mimins** (6): feels like a typical girl group song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.9): ughhh fromis you can do better than this!

**Zypker125** (4.3): I remember people calling this “MV of the year” and I never understood it, to me it was always one of the worst MVs of the year. My opinion hasn’t changed. Also, this choreography is worse than I remembered.

**sabooyah** (4): mid

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): I’m definitely too old for this song, but it doesn’t stop it from being good! Like if this is the music 11 year olds get these days then I’m jealous of them.

---

**hunnybee12** (11): the trials and tribulations of being a day 1 Dailee in 2022 are neverending 😔 yall better give the best kpop song of 2021 the love it deserves!

**kpoppyko** (11): fire

**LesApfels** (11): This song has so much momentum, it's like riding a rollercoaster.

**2dina3dworld** (10): The duality of man - this is an 11 contender for me whereas the song it allegedly rips off (So Am I) was a 0 contender for its rate. Interesting how that works.

**aestheticen** (10): Indonesian hitmakers!!!!! #BRING_THIS_WEEEKLY_BACK

**agentofscranton** (10): why on earth would they switch concepts?? they literally struck gold with this?? end girl crush now!!!

**akanewasright** (10): so sad how they never released anything again after this </3

**bespectacIed** (10): this was a momentous slayage of epic proportions. Pop perfection, my gahd. My weeklynator card was glowing, activated, and overflowing. This was their ONLY latest release, please believe me.....

**bluetriangles04** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/545307780932960256/998115034527977512/unknown.png

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): i rlly thought they were gonna revive the school girl concept…. how naive of me.

**jasannn** (10): the best thing to come out of 4th gen was the return of 2nd-gen sounding songs.

**Kadenfrost** (10): A fantastic little time capsule of a song. Kind of sad for Daileee's rn about Jiyoon leaving...

**LilacDaffodils** (10): one of the best kpop songs of the last five years and very close to being my eleven.

**mrach** (10): and so ava max takes another L

**pig-serpent** (10): Magnificent hook on this one.

**Qwilphish** (10): This song is slightly overplayed for me but if I take myself back to last year when this song came out, it was inescapable. I think that Weeekly's later output has been a massive massive miss which has killed a lot of their hype from this song but I hope they can bounce back, b/c this song was so fun.

**ricki** (10): Ven Para was a loyalty test guys, WE'RE FAILING!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): for a while, this was my favorite kpop song of all time. ever since i first heard it in a popheads beatsense party i've been addicted to just how bright and cheerful it was, and it fills me with serotonin like almost no other song i know. i fully expected this to be my 11, but one other song in this rate took me by surprise so i unfortunately won't be able to use it here, but this song will always have a place in my heart for really getting me into kpop music

**poemforsmallthings** (9.8): the fact that they went on to release Ven para after the 15 minutes of TikTok fame this song gave them... heartbreaking

**sarcasticsobs** (9.8): Put this in the dictionary as the definition of the word “earworm”

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): do you think they knew what a chorus they had

**maybecrf** (9.5): it takes a little while to get to the good part, but that part is very good

**moonagenightmares** (9.5): the cb song stayc shouldve had

**ebooks#5454** (9.2): okay skater girl anthem

**anothertown** (9): i feel like i got smacked in the face by this

**coolfluffle** (9): another great release from a lesser known group, tiktok vibes strong with this one lol

**orbiteezus** (9): its great that this song went viral but wish it translated to their other songs, very fun song and the choreo with the skateboard is so fun to watch

**paigama** (9): i can't stand it now but it would be unfair to give it a <9 just because i overplayed it

**rslashpoopheads** (9): probably their one hit wonder but what a hit it was!

**vhqv1997** (9): rip this concept and sound. girl crush virus transmitted from loona to weeekly.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): this one grows and shrinks on me but its solid

**celladonn** (8.5): That chorus is irresistible

**DaBigBoi** (8.5): We were once a country. A proper country.

**mayolizard** (8.5): cute blew up on tiktok

**moonshxne** (8.5): i see why this blew up

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): what if we met up behind the toilets on the oval after school and made out 👉👈 🥺

**Victerade** (8.5): solid

**wavingwolves** (8.5): k-pop girlgroup after school has been rly silent since this dropped... coincidence? i think #NOT

**alwayswords** (8.3): ava max cast a hex on them after this went viral

**bulforster** (8.2): I don't quite get the massive hype for this one but I love the outro, gets stuck in my head all the time.

**bigbigbee** (8): I’m so annoyed by Weeekly’s turn away from the cute, refreshing image, during the Ven Para promotions. I understand wanting to “grow up” their image, but there are several blueprints of more mature music that feels like a more logical “next step” from cute concepts: T-ara’s Roly Poly, Oh My Girl’s Nonstop, EXID’s Lady, I think that something like TTS’s Twinkle would have worked, I think that something like Mamamoo’s You’re The Best would have worked, I think that something like Girl’s Day’s Female President would have worked. Just such a weird decision! But I don’t think they’re too far gone, to be clear, and I hope that they DO either return to the old Weeekly sound or pick something like my other examples going forward.

2021inKPOP: **Cooler\_lin** (8): this chorus is so fucking good and catchy and the post bridge is so top tier i literally do not care what the rest of the song sounds like...actually deducted points for the whole song not being the chorus

**CrimsonROSET** (8): do you got games on your phone

**jay duh** (8): NSMPG promo :heart:

**Kayaking11116** (8): you know i thought i heard this song too many times but um. no i dont think i have bc it still fucks. like this song is yum yum

**NotWith10000Men** (8): I ignored them after the one song I heard from them was over the top bubblegum, but this is pretty cool. love the chorus

**PSSST12** (8): its cute fun and works for them. What more can you ask?

**skargardin** (8): bop!

**welcome2thejam** (8): Somebody call Tony Hawk... I got something he needs to hear

**whoisValensi** (8): Hey does anyone else remember when you guys tried to get this into the TikTok rate???? Anyways, what happened to Weeekly????? Yeah I'm sure I'm not the first or last person to leave a comment like this on this song but like... Mannnnnnn. Going from this to whatever the fuck "Ven Para" was was a real bad move. Basically what I'm saying is the GP needs to embrace Teen Crush again.

**chancehugs** (7): Not as strong as Tag Me, but still fun.

**Gonza\_90** (7): Did they just told me to download a phone game?

**ilyyyyy** (7): it's cute, i like the chorus. don't love the verses after the first chorus

**melody** (7): its cute

**runaway3212** (7): at least the dance is super fun

**sabooyah** (7): cute, the last half is great

**La-lamp** (6.7): Overrated

**mimins** (6.5): cute but nothing special

**Zypker125** (6.4): I’m so glad that Weeekly is one of the few girl groups still doing bright concepts… *sees their most recent single, Ven para*...... never mind I guess

**BaconShoes** (6): decent enough

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): the way tag me is still the only weeekly song i love

**vayyiqra** (6): It's nice but kind of a nothing song; I keep forgetting it's here. Maybe having to follow "The Feels" in the playlist doomed it?

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Ariana is SUING. Demi is CONTACTING THEIR LAWYERS. Nicki is CWALLING THE BARBZ.

**seanderlust** (5.7): the most interesting thing production-wise is the measure before the chorus. otherwise, it feels forgettable

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This kind of reminds me of high school in that I don’t really mind it when it’s on but I certainly don’t feel inclined to go back to it.

**apatel27** (4): Did a 9 year old write this rap?

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): they actually sounded like mobile game ads when saying “download the phone game” which invoked a very negative emotion in me. also "fellow kids" energy all around

**BasedButta** (3): yeah the chorus sounds great, but damn if the whole song doesn’t get worse by every listen. After some time the lack of instrumental just screams at your face how everything but the chorus is a disjointed ugly sounding mess that gets impossible to ignore. Kinda hate this more than I should because of that.

**IsaiahTB0** (2): Ava Max cleared them.

**SkylarV** (2): Weeekly has been all downhill from here

**bookthieving** (0): wait i thought i already 0'd so am i in a rate this month

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): There’s truly nothing to dislike about IU. She’s got the Midas touch when it comes to making music. Her voice was literally crafted by angels.

---

**ebooks#5454** (11): what can i say? this is a delightful delectable divine album and this title track encompasses all the beauty and brains IU has dedicated towards her work. uwu. real talk: i discovered IU late 2021 when i was really depressed and uhh lowkeylisteningtomycrush'sspotifyplaylistsuhmmanywayschile; point being, i feel like her music can always cheer me up when im sad bc it's great to listen to such a talented artist and know hey i live in a time where i get to hear this phenomenal singer!! her vocals are truly unmatched in the realm of kpop (maybe english pop too? idk) because every note feels like it's sung with such grace and care i feel quite soothed. Lilac title track is fun and whimiscal with a lil dash of longing/sadness but overall joyus. and come on, who doesn't love the sweet smell and pretty color of lilacs?? MWAH gotta love IU unnie

**rslashpoopheads** (11): 2:29 in the MV was the most iconic moment of kpop last year

**vayyiqra** (11): Is it basic to like city pop? Then let me be basic. This is a beautiful song. I can't stop listening to this. It's perfect. I wish the rest of the album were this good.

**welcome2thejam** (11): Elevated a tried and true sound with strong hooks, perfectly placed elements (the second verse opening with the horn and then those little piano and synth touches? chef's kiss), and bringing the right kind of energy at just the right time. And that brief sax at the climax? This song is just beautiful.

**anothertown** (10): her final smile in the mv is iconic wtf

**apatel27** (10): When IU goes for this sound it never misses

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this chorus!!! pure euphoria

**coolfluffle** (10): incredible, no words

**cremeebrulee** (10): best color ever

**IsaiahTB0** (10): Id probably give this an 11 if Next Levul didnt exist. Love the concept of a fleeting love like spring. The best song of this style from last year. Great MV as well.

**Kadenfrost** (10): the purple spring aesthetic is so pretty. Ms. IU should film a k-drama with this concept! (PS. I learned this song from the CupcakKe Remix)

**Kayaking11116** (10): literal perfection this song makes me lose my mind

**La-lamp** (10): Future classic

**maybecrf** (10): a borderline perfect song

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): inject this into my veins

**Qwilphish** (10): it's her best title track and it's not even close. its easy breezy, but she also flexes her vocals here. That chorus is literally perfect the way that it grows and grows on itself. A MASTERPIECE

**SFbby** (10): This is the sound of spring in song form

**skargardin** (10): A LILAC!!

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): so happy I get to write my obligatory "vote for the city pop rate!" comment twice

**bulforster** (9.7): easily my favourite discovery of the rate

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): IU 🤝 Jessie Ware ⬇ bringing a forgotten genre (trains) back in the pop culture conversation

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): a mortal kombat scene on a city pop background???

**yatcho** (9.5): refreshing like a spring breeze

**paigama** (9.3): love it

**DirtyRat583** (9.2): i love the warm feeling this song gives me

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): oh this one goes off yass

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This production sounds expensive.

**bluetriangles04** (9): LOVE ME ONLY TIL THIS SPRING

**DefaultPophead** (9): I can see this one winning!

**Gonza\_90** (9): I woke

**ilyyyyy** (9): super nice, the vibes are perfect, got to rec 'empty cup' from its album

**orbiteezus** (9): this song doesn’t sound too out-of-place with the k-pop nu-disco trend but IU’s voice is so soft and sweet and the chorus is so lush i love it so much

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): It’s springtime encapsulated in a song! It’s good! Cowards (preemptively)! Purple!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): this mv has the weirdest energy, i swear it changes genre like 7 times

**aestheticen** (8.5): You were red, and you liked me because I was blue. You touched me and suddenly I was a lilac sky... and you decided purple just wasn't for you...

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): one of the few good songs on this album teabh we want flower bookmark 3…

**MToms** (8.5): The superior IU song by a landslide

**moonshxne** (8.4): LILAC (the album and title track) sometimes reminds me of JJ Lin’s Drifter EP in that both records, while inevitably a letdown compared to their phenomenal 2017 work, feature some very solid songwriting and inspired production ideas. Unfortunately, said records are also sometimes (but not always) undercut by some pretty questionable mixing and/or post-production (...literally distracting enough to bother a fan who doesn’t know anything about music production), which makes ZERO SENSE considering both artists’ caliber/seniority. tl;dr if there weren’t some weird issues with the mix/vocal post-production this probably would’ve been a 10 :(

**akanewasright** (8): This is one of the strongest Disco inspired songs in a rate plagued with them. Wild how including elements and instruments not heard in say so can make a better and more memorable Disco song!

**bespectacIed** (8): fun! she took a sip from the yukika lake and made it a hit

**celladonn** (8): Very pretty and groovy

**chancehugs** (8): Love the vibe of this song. Love resembles misty dream is a weirdly beautiful lyric.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh this is so delicate, i love it

**melody** (8): her voice is like sirens, so gorgeous and harmonic 🌸

**NotWith10000Men** (8): i love the little groovy guitar riff

**poemforsmallthings** (8): if we ever rate this mini My Sea would be my 11

**runaway3212** (8): taeyeon wannabe

**sliced-peaches** (8): again a cute summer song love her

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): It sounds so light and cute! I like it

2021inKPOP: **wavingwolves** (7.9): ended taeyawn btw

**hikkaru** (7.5): a vast improvement from c*lebrity

**BaconShoes** (7): funky jam but doesn’t stick with me

**DaBigBoi** (7): Will Lilac or Weekend win? Place your bets now

**jay duh** (7): yass

**mayolizard** (7): a cute slay i only appreciate when it pops up on tiktok

**pig-serpent** (7): This song is very plain and I find the production to be a little too pastel for this type of song but even I find myself swaying back and forth while listening to it so it’s doing something right.

**PSSST12** (7): well, this is still a bit generic for her but atleast its catchy and makes me dance.

**Stryxen** (7): this has musical merit

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): god she’s so pretty

**BasedButta** (6.5): first chorus has the 11 of kpop outfits from 2021

**mimins** (6.5): I like the airy chorus but the rest is forgettable

**whoisValensi** (6.5): Ah that's more like it! Some city pop to save me from the snooze of the previous IU entry! I mean I'm still not fully having fun, but it's a step up! I think I'll just go back to listening to "Gloomy Clock" when it comes to IU tho.

**chenle** (5.7): never got the hype i'm sorry

**Cooler\_lin** (5.5): pretty boring but i love the weird chromaticism (?) in her vocals on the chorus

**sabooyah** (5.5): extra half point for the sax

**moonagenightmares** (5): yassss queen give us nothing

**thedoctordances1940** (3.2): i despise that little summery kinda disco-ey guitar tone at this point, i don't know why, it just causes a negative reaction in me every time i hear it

**flavasavavandal** (3): I’m just a little sick of this pristine idea of pop/disco, there isn’t a strong enough hook like on MAGO to distract from the fact this sounds sterile but I will give it points since IU has a lovely voice

**Zypker125** (1.6): I’ve never gotten the hype for IU’s songs, and this song is no exception. It’s not catchy, it doesn’t flow well, and even the vocals drown me in boredom.

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): I’m glad if a boy group was able to make it this far, that at least the song is worth the trek.

---

**alwayswords** (11): @hybe bring back the vampire concept NOW

**DaBigBoi** (11): I will speak on Enhypen typically, but this song is just amazing. I’ve had complaints abt the way they use vocal filters since debut, but they took that filter and made it work FOR them.

**ilyyyyy** (11): soooooooooo gooooooood one of the best kpop songs ever that chorus is pure psychedelic bliss which you should expect from the title and it totally delivers

**pheromenos** (11): eradicated misandry

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): i went into this rate fully expecting after school to be my 11, with absolutely no contest for anything that could beat it. and for a while, it was! but one song in particular stayed in my mind and made me keep revisiting for weeks after submitting my ballot, and it was this one. this is pretty much everything i love in one song, the music sounds oddly haunting, the chorus is so insanely catchy, everything about it is just irresistable to me, to the point where i couldn't really justify not giving this my 11. will i probably regret this decision come reveal where after school ends up placing higher than this song does? maybe, but at the end of the day, this song was one of my favorite discoveries in a rate in a long long time, and it's more than worthy of top marks

**2l82bstr8** (10): they just get it

**aestheticen** (10): I could have sworn something shifted after this dropped

**agentofscranton** (10): listening to this after pass the mic and getting upset at the decay

**BaconShoes** (10): wait this was such a bop omg

**bigbigbee** (10): VAAAAAoooAAAAAAoAAAAAAAAooow

**bluetriangles04** (10): Me after obtaining a drinking problem after this rate reveal to cope with the pain I already know is well on the way.

**chenle** (10): the urge to give this my 11

**cremeebrulee** (10): SMASH!!!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Something about that chorus is so hypnotic

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): yeah…. soty soty soty. this song had a vice grip on me for the last year and i don’t think i’ll ever recover!

**hanpop** (10): don't play this while driving

**hikkaru** (10): of all releases to have a shitty bside overshadow the title it was this SLAY.....

**ignitethephoenix** (10): oh they put their whole Enhypussy into this

**jay duh** (10): wow... once i remembered enhypen exists and i listened to this song it was over for me..

**kpoppyko** (10): OH?

**mayolizard** (10): i accidentally hit a rabbit on the road while listening to this song but other then that i love this song!!!

**milkywayinradius** (10): really cool spooky dark beat vibe. that chorus and choreo is mesmerizing

**moonagenightmares** (10): massive bop literally so fucking good its crazy. WE WANT THE GAY VAMPIRES BACK

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): they absolutely ate with no crumbs…or should i say drank with no spills…slaps knee

**plastichaxan** (10): my savage 11 was kinda shaking with this being in the rate omfg

**poemforsmallthings** (10): their best song btw

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I love the extreme niche of horror-esque dance tracks like this, disturbia and heads will roll

**ricki** (10): garam should have thrown a flower pot to everyone but sunoo when she had the chance

**runaway3212** (10): the chorus ugh... i wish i was drunk

**skargardin** (10): We are NOT going to let this flop

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): danganronpa music

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Wait this is a fucking banger

**vuemaurel** (10): The music, the video, the choreo... mind-blowing!

**wavingwolves** (10): they will never do music half as good as this again but at least they had a major hit on their hands once upon a time... some artists never even had that...

**welcome2thejam** (10): Just when I thought this chorus couldn't get more powerful, the drums at the very end hit that humungous BANG BANG and knock my socks clean off

**xxipil0ts** (10): - for context im doing this rate with blind reactions since i only know a few songs from this list so i was surprised that this song is surprisingly good. i've always heard of enhypen but holy shit this is so good.

**LilacDaffodils** (9.5): this song genuinely makes me feel euphoric whatever's in it I want more of.

**Zypker125** (9.2): Ah, don’t we love how 15-17 year olds are singing about getting super drunk and high. Oh well, at least this song slaps.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): they ate here

**chancehugs** (9): This chorus is everything. I wish clubs were open and would play this so I can jump and bang my head to it.

**coolfluffle** (9): incredible song, i couldnt believe they were rookies

**ebooks#5454** (9): this is just korean "Thriller"

**ernie** (9): (their best title track imo,

**melody** (9): DANCE DANCE DANCE

**metanoira** (9): sunoo main slayer always

**orbiteezus** (9): one of my favorite (if not my favorite) boy group songs last year, i love how grungy it sounds, especially the bridge

2021inKPOP: **IsaiahTB0** (8.8): Their best title track. The way they tanked in song quality after this... the duality!

**bulforster** (8.5): now why is google labelling this ambient psychedelic rock?

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): i love the descending melody on the words in the chorus

**paigama** (8.5): I like the chorus a lot

**2dina3dworld** (8): I can’t endorse songs about drinking and not feeling like shit but this is fine

**celladonn** (8): Pretty great, definitely made me sit up and take notice of this group

**frogaranaman** (8): I like how this sounds like spinning in audio form

**Tazzachar** (8): it felt like I was on an acid trip or something more than being drunk

**tiltheendoftheline** (8): first time in months that I'm listening to it, and I had forgotten that this is actually good. It just gets old kind of fast.

**vayyiqra** (8): No thoughts but this is a banger especially the chorus.

**vhqv1997** (8): clown music

**yatcho** (8): love when the boys do high energy bangers

**Cooler\_lin** (7.9): now if this was backed with exo's vocals it would a ten at least

**BasedButta** (7.5): this is exactly my type of song: loud, stupid, with catchy instrumental presence and with a real chorus! That said, this one… the more you listen to it, the worse it gets, it’s so repetitive. I’m just not gonna listen to it anymore and leave it at 7.5 as a compromise is that ok

**Qwilphish** (7.5): its fun it gets you on your feet and its creepy as fuck

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.4): are any of them old enough to drink

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): The production definitely sounds drunk. It kinda works.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): oh kinda dramatic

**CrimsonROSET** (7): it does sound like they were in a daze for it

**flavasavavandal** (7): Drunk-Dazed goes in the right direction with its changes in pitch and mostly unstable production, getting caught in the whirlwind and never really finding ground but I’m left wishing they pushed further into a more experimental direction

**maybecrf** (7): surprisingly good

**whoisValensi** (7): THIS IS NOT HELPING THE MIGRAINE AT ALL AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Perhaps in a future time, I will get the hype behind EN-, but I don't think that today will be that day. Side-note this video got really fucking weird really fucking fast. But also I dig that. Now watch me get this stuck in my head or smth lollllll. Because despite the perceived negativeness in every part of this comment so-far, I don't outright hate this??? Like it could grow on me lol.

**Kayaking11116** (6): something about the chorus doesnt totally vibe with me

**mimins** (6): I would adore this song based on the instrumental but I can't stand their vocals at all.

**sabooyah** (6): catchy hook but that's all

**PSSST12** (5): This is just annoying to me sorry.

**moonshxne** (4.4): The vocal processing makes them sound soulless but they’re vampires I guess (...I do wish the song leaned further into its sinister, carnivalesque undertone; also, the hook really manages to grate, like, the first time you hear it.)

**apatel27** (4): They look like they shop at Waitrose

**rslashpoopheads** (4): cute but also annoying after a while

**bespectacIed** (2): sounds like a bad eurovision entry

**ImADudeDuh** (2): they’re dazed and i’m confused

**Dusk** (11): literal pop perfection idk what else to say, nugus devour sometimes

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): Yes, I submitted it here and yes, I submitted it again for the charity rate. The people have spoken! It’s a top tier Carly Rae Jepsen song that’s further elevated by her amazing vocals. Youha Carey did not come to play!! Undoubtedly my favorite song of 2021. See y'all in a month!

**MK** (10): make sure to give this your 11 (or at least a 10) in the [Charity](https://redd.it/vpw2b5) rate!

---

**2l82bstr8** (11): and it would've been my 11 in the main rate, too

**chancehugs** (11): Giving my 11 to this song to make up for the fact that it's slept on so much. That high note before the last chorus deserves to be recognised.

**DirtyRat583** (11): swept me off my feet. the lord raised me up while i listened to it. i have changed. thank you youha

**flavasavavandal** (11): Robyn!!?!?!?!!

**LilacDaffodils** (11): This song makes me nostalgic for the present and puts me in enough of a happy fog I don't realize how oxymoronic the first statement was. I am picking myself up and dusting myself off but i'm not blocking his number and I may send a drunk text or two but mostly I am feeling my feelings in the moment even if they are hard to feel because the line between pain and euphoria is thin.

**metanoira** (11): as one of the 10 youha stans...i have no choice but. island is like the best song created like ever

**paigama** (11): the real 2021 soty

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): should have been in the main rate

**seanderlust** (11): i'm vibing so hard to this. i thought i was going to 11 the butter remix here but then here came YOUHA with the steel chair

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): not to bring up discorse from the hosting server but i truely do not understand the reasoning behind this not being allowed to being in the rate while insomnia was. like theyre both on pretty much the same level of popularity on youtube and spotify so it seems really weird to me this one was shut off and the other wasnt??? anyway enough complaining about things beyond my control this is a fucking bop and wouldve easily and deservedly won the main rate if it was included

**thedoctordances1940** (11): comfortably my favourite song here, love this

**chenle** (10): this song makes me feel like a main character

**HoshiLock** (9): Totally my type

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): synthwave 101

**vayyiqra** (9): One of my favourite obscure-ish Kpop finds, I heard this somehow last year (from RYM? a Pophead? idk) and like it a lot. Yeah it's "basic" synthpop but it's really well-made and cute.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Oh, “A bit tipsy.” I thought it said “A bit PSY” like she’s feeling like PSY. Imagine a song like that though!

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): 👏👏👏

**Zypker125** (4.5): The itsy bitsy abittipsy spider crawled up the water spout........

**exciting\_patient4872** (4): There are four numbers in my username, and I assigned one to each song in the bonus rate. It's law.

**sage** (2.7): literally the definition of bland retro synth-y songs theres nothing interesting whatsoever here

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): It kinda gives nursery rhyme but i can’t help by yass

---

**anothertown** (11): asap ended wars, it solved climate change, it stopped the titanic sinking, it told james dean not to go out driving that day, it landed the plane on the hudson, it saves people from burning buildings, it filed mariah carey's divorce papers, it upgraded the plug.dj servers, it

**bluetriangles04** (11): When this song released... WORLD STOP! The hold this and After School had on me during that time period is something I will never forget. My most listened to K-Pop song in 2021, this stands the test of time for me because everytime I hear J's part I still go feral. NO I'M NOT PICKY. *korean slayage* The instrumental, the dance, the concept, the lyrics even relating to my life at parts, you name it. I loved this song to bits then, and while maybe the magic has rubbed off slightly since, it still remains to be one of my favorite songs EVER. It just proves that STAYC does NOT MISS.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): a song that’s made me so happy this year. Such a cute, joyful bop!

**majid** (11): there are much better songs in this rate, but this song never fails to make me happy!

**2l82bstr8** (10): the only acceptable TikTok-ready choreo

**aestheticen** (10): QUEENS OF ABBREVIATIONS!! QUEENS OF INTERNET LINGO!!!! SLAYC!!!!

**akanewasright** (10): *I think you’re really cool *

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Serotonin! Also obsessed with the earring pigtails look.

**chancehugs** (10): I initially didn't get this song. Then one day everything just clicked and now "NUNAPE NUNAPE" gives me life.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): we love a breakout hit!

**coolfluffle** (10): really fun song, did the rounds on tiktok and the dance was really fun too

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Why does this chorus always get stuck in my head

**ebooks#5454** (10): THE ABSOLUTE SMASHAAAAAA i would absolutely 11 this

**hanpop** (10): the dance had me in a chokehold

**jasannn** (10): kinda ironic since it seemed to be a hug grower for everyone

**jay duh** (10): hmm

**Kadenfrost** (10): Slay-C (1)

**kyrgyzzephyr** (10): sweet bubbly pop perfection! something that took me a long time to realise is how heavy and low-pitched the verses’ instrumentals are but the verses still feel bright because the vocal melodies are so lively. and that is part of why i love asap and stayc on the whole, there’s such an engaging dynamic between the elements of their songs but it never feels like it's doing too much

**maybecrf** (10): a perfect song, the visuals, the dance, the production, its so good

**mayolizard** (10): MAJOR SLAY i love the shitty flute

**melody** (10): StayC girls.. more like SLAYC

**moonagenightmares** (10): the 11 contender </3

**Qwilphish** (10): STAYC are the most exciting girl group to come out in the past couple of years, and its because of their extremely high quality songs that are pretty unmatched. There's a reason why all of their songs go viral. For this song specifically, I love how playful it is and how I speed down the highway whenever I drive with it on :)

**ricki** (10): Early last year I was genuinely at a miserable stage in my life, and this song and After School being inescapebale brought all the serotonin my body needed to not end it all.

**runaway3212** (10): read my 2021 review of ASAP here!

**sliced-peaches** (10): had an irl argument once about if this song is better than so bad which in case u were wondering its not but theyre queenies regardless

**Stryxen** (10): STAY C GIRLSSSS ITS GOIN DOWN

**Tazzachar** (10): this song is what got me interested in STAYC, the "I think you're really cool" hook is so satisfying

**whoisValensi** (10): After coming upon the scene, serving cunt and returning to the workshop, STAYC came back with another pussy popper for their first comeback. And they have continued to do that since. (Even if some comeback tracks have perhaps taken a bit to grow on me in some cases...)

**DaBigBoi** (9.5): One would think I was a Swith with these scores, but I am not

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): me begging for the 2022 kpop rate to come so that I can 11 run2u

**Gonza\_90** (9): ASAP fiiuuuuuuuuuuuhhh

**PSSST12** (9): A BANGER. although it aged a bit for me, a hit is a hit I fear.

**sarcasticsobs** (9): *(Don’t say the catchphrase, don’t say the catchphrase, don’t say the catchphrase)* Anyways, Sieun and J have some of my favorite vocal timbres in 4th gen. Finally, an instrumental break/anti-drop that fits the rest of the song

**skargardin** (9): ASAP!

**thedoctordances1940** (9): stayc girls it's going down just like your average loooool

**tiltheendoftheline** (9): I LOVE THIS CHORUS

**welcome2thejam** (9): I thought STAYC called me cool 😣

**seanderlust** (8.8): I can't tell if this song is legitimately this good or it's just that every time I hear "STAYC girls it's going down!" I immediately go feral

**BasedButta** (8.5): idk why but i find this to be absolutely #poggers love the flutey thing

2021inKPOP: **wavingwolves** (8.1): you had to be there... she was the moment...

**bigbigbee** (8): I love love love that they have a member with that gorgeous alto voice. StayC are an extremely competent group and their management did a great job picking the members, and crafting their music and concept to stand out.

**celladonn** (8): A bit overrated but still very fun and catchy

**Cooler\_lin** (8): was going to give it a seven and a half but the chorus is way too catchy and the twice rap section made my ass jump a bit in the car ngl

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the fuck is a décalcomaine

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): i broke my arm trying that choreo

**rslashpoopheads** (8): STAYC can do no wrong

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): it sounds like a tiktok song but like. a good one

**vayyiqra** (8): Super Mario type beat but it's cute.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): It’s very cute

**apatel27** (7.5): the beat isn't the best

**ignitethephoenix** (7): what is this video game Intro

**IsaiahTB0** (7): Mad overrated. The song is cute but nothing special.

**mimins** (7): love the chorus but the rest of the song does not live up to it

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): tbh i never got the overwhelming hype for this song but the chorus (+ its choreo) is really catchy so slayyy

**moonshxne** (7): really catchy and ear-wormy and even though i was turned off the first time it admittedly is a grower

**Zypker125** (6.8): Soooo I guess Black Eyed Pilseung doesn’t always release home runs. That’s okay, STAYC doesn’t always have to go down

**orbiteezus** (6.5): this song is cute and fun but i wish i liked the post-chorus more

**BaconShoes** (6): the production is fun but idk

**ilyyyyy** (6): not bad but not into it

**Kayaking11116** (6): it kills me inside that the rest of the song isn’t as good as the chorus. the chorus carries it

**sabooyah** (6): i thought this song was going to be better because it was like everywhere ... it was kinda mid. the girl with the deep voice tho ... grammy

**bulforster** (5.3): this is kind of annoying

**flavasavavandal** (5): ASAP just never comes together into something I ever really want to listen to

**letsallpoo** (5): great memes, beautiful memes

**SkylarV** (4.5): This is STAYC's best title track but that's not saying much

**NotWith10000Men** (4): boring

**vuemaurel** (3.5): Except for Run2u, this group doesn't do anything for me.

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): I don't think I'm really cool tbh

**bespectacIed** (2): I have to counter the pro-stayc agenda that has now infiltrated popheads. will never get the hype with them, stan twitter's overhyped poster girls... this sounds bitter af lol but that's my truth

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): I know retro is way overdone in K-pop to the point where it’s boring, but Key took the deepest dive in the father swamp. Vocals? Killer. Hook? Monumental. Every second of this song is perfect. It never once loses its momentum. If you want to make a not-boring retro throwback, you should ask Key for advice.

**throwaway-7650** (10): This is the most robbed song of Day 1 imo. WTF? How did this never even touch Day 2 after the first 25 ballots… and if I say this is better than MMMH I’ll be the bad guy? ~~KAI is the far superior mini though~~

---

**aestheticen** (11): Key if you need some good love I am free on Saturday night

**chenle** (11): POP PERFECTION!!!

**Cooler\_lin** (11): masterpiece........the ending?.....*ascension*

**Kayaking11116** (11): i’ve said this before and i will say it again, this song made me religious. i felt like i was ascending to Heaven. literally the greatest thing to bless my ears, best song of 2021, probably the best song ever i’m actually obsessed

**kyrgyzzephyr** (11): this song is pure high drama and i love it. when that driving synthwave beat first hits...wew. i love how the pre-choruses and bridge pull things back so the following sections hit just as hard as the start. and key's performance is just so fittingly extravagant

**mimins** (11): he released this song for me, like I'm the target audience...everything from the concept to the visuals to the choreo...he ate down key ily

**omgthenerve** (11): Bad Love SOTY, AOTY Kim Kibum LOML

**sabooyah** (11): this climax is everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! masterpiece chefs kiss solid pure pop perfection all the way through i love it and have no nitpicks. art

**seanderlust** (11): these synths feel peeled right out of the stranger things soundtrack

**thedoctordances1940** (11): a little bit of electroclash at the beginning and then immaculate synthwave production? what's not to love about this

**whoisValensi** (11): LOOK MA MY ULTIMATE BIAS MADE ONE OF THE BIGGEST BANGERS OF ALL TIME WITH AN EVEN BETTER MINI ALBUM ATTACHED TO IT!!!!!!!!!!! (This is how you know I'm gay.) I could probably go on for a good eon about how I fucking waited and waited and waited for 'FACE' to even happen back in the day and how that blew me away but like holy shit... There's a reason why this was Mini-Album/EP of the year for me last year. Title track is fucking insane, the entire mini is super fucking good, like... GOD HE DID THAT!!!!! KIBUM FUCKING DID THAT!!!!!!! AND IF YOU DENY THAT HE DID THAT WE'RE NO LONGER FRIENDS/ACQUAINTANCES/ETC. ***Seriously, never talk to me again if you disagree.*** For months since this rate was in the works I've been bouncing mentally between if this or DCM should get my 11 and in the heat of the moment, I believe the choice is extremely clear to me. So anyways what I'm saying is SM give this man another solo this year or else :).

**akanewasright** (10): I LOVE GAY PEOPLE

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): WOW this is great, those vocals in the chorus are amazing

**bigbigbee** (10): I think that this is the best solo song in this rate. retro-inspired synth pop is an oversaturated market, but I think this song sets itself apart, and both the musical style and lyrics suit Key’s image like a glove.

**celladonn** (10): This is such a knockout

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): gay rights

**DaBigBoi** (10): yass

**HoshiLock** (10): He did an incredible album

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Ended Taemin in this rate I’m afraid

**ImADudeDuh** (10): republicans when they see gay people existing

**orbiteezus** (10): yeahhhhh lets go star wars this song kinda overshadowed every shinee song last year for me

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): one of my favorite EPs last year

**Qwilphish** (10): He sounds great! sounds like something from After Hours. The last chorus really elevates the whole song. Key is a monster

**ricki** (10): proof that we need more gay people in charge of creative direction

**rotating3Dtext** (10): it’s synthwave, it’s bold, it’s hot, it’s retro how could I not

**Roxieloxie** (10): one of my very beloved tumblr mutals post about this guy all the time and the like sci fi aesthetic vibes were really nice

**runaway3212** (10): GAY PEOPLE UNITE!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this gets a 10 purely for the intro alone but it helps that the rest of the song also slaps

**tiltheendoftheline** (10): this is kind of a perfect pop song, with a perfect MV and concept.

**vayyiqra** (10): One of my favourite new finds from this rate, this does the "80s retro synthpop" LARP way better than most songs that try it. If this weren't in Korean, you could tell me it's a forgotten hit by Loverboy or some other 80s pop act and I'd believe it. Shoutout to Kenzie who wrote this and worked on a few other songs in this rate, this being the best one without a doubt.

**vuemaurel** (10): Lies! This is not bad, love!

**IsaiahTB0** (9.8): This is how you do a solo. Key came on this track mad as hell!

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): this song is excellence omfg this is what gaga thought she was doing with chromatica…

**sarcasticsobs** (9.1): Me: “I think I’m finally over 80’s synthwave pastiche.” *This song comes out*: “Okay, maybe a little more would be fine, I guess”

**apatel27** (9): That synth is putting in work

**bookthieving** (9): key you’re a year late to the blinding lights cosplay

**hikkaru** (9): HAPPY PRIDE MONTH

**ilyyyyy** (9): i kinda stopped checking out his songs after not liking a few in a row but this one's great & i wouldve missed had it not been for this rate

**La-lamp** (9): Too much The Weekndish

**moonagenightmares** (9): damn okay i did not know key is a sanger good for him

**skargardin** (9): bop!

**vhqv1997** (9): the weeknd made a mistake rejecting this he would have had a hit for dawn.fm

**welcome2thejam** (9): Good explosive chorus, and boy those synths always hit nicely

**cherryices** (8.9): great but helium is the real star of the EP. love love love the pulpy sci-fi styling around it all. do not love that he blew up the enterprise in the MV!! was this secretly directed by jj abrams?

**BasedButta** (8.5): song that makes you go HOG

**bluetriangles04** (8.5): Key seems to be in his element for this song graced by an eerily tinged synthpop instrumental lead by his powerful vocals. Upon re-listen, I should listen to this more often.

**bulforster** (8.3): this is my joker

**ebooks#5454** (8): blinding lights???

**metanoira** (8): OHHHH THE DRAMAAA YESSS KIBUMMM

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Okay this is kinda sexy

2021inKPOP: **RandomHypnotica** (7.6): somebody was inspired by the weeknd huh

**2l82bstr8** (7.5): between this and everything else, it's so cool how distinct the voices from all the SHINee members are. the synths are really distracting and overpowering here though

**moonshxne** (7.5): I’m so sorry but the entire time I wished Abel was singing instead

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): he slayed

**BaconShoes** (7): i enjoy the production

**jay duh** (7): i love seeing a little monster winning

**mayolizard** (7): ok will byers

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.7): blinding lights rlly had a chokehold on the kpop industry huh…

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): I’m not fully sure whether this is a banger or just loud.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): have you tried bland love

**maybecrf** (6): ive heard this exact song before

**pig-serpent** (6): The token mediocre synthwave song that will end up getting in the top 10 for some reason unfathomable to me.

**wavingwolves** (6): i would love to support gay icons if the gay icons in question had a better song in the rate

**Zypker125** (5.6): On paper I should like this song, but I just don’t. Nothing about the song sticks with me.

**chancehugs** (5): Gives me the same vibe as Everglow's La Di Da, but not the same energy.

**bespectacIed** (4): it's ok... the vocal performance leaves much to be desired

**Stryxen** (4): I hate his voice… and I'm in a bad mood

**MassiveThief** (2): just SO messy. too many sounds and they don't compliment eachother.

**2dina3dworld** (1): well, the title says it. It’s “bad”! It’s midlife crisis JYP core!!

=====

vivianlight: I feel like Mago is great (I don't remember what I gave but surely at least 9) but in 2022 I can say that the replay value of Fancy is far superior. It's that kind of eternal bop no matter how you overplayed it... Which is difficult to say for many songs, even if great. And I think Mago lose a lot of its punch if you already know the song and have listened to it a bit (not even *too* much), it's greatness is a lot in being a time capsule.

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): I am a UJUNG for LIFE! Their discography is hit after hit after hit in my last.fm. We Just Sold 10 million copies in my revisionist memory!! It would’ve been great if we had a non big-4 artist win one of these rates, but maybe next time! I’ll take #2! Prayer circle for post-Queendom win success so the missing members come crawling back to the Starship HQ 🙏I think we ALL are [unnatural](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/345/300/5b6.jpg).

---

**agentofscranton** (11): mothers!!!

**coolfluffle** (11): i am a recent wjsn stan but this song has been in my playlist since it came out, genuinely one of kpop's masterpieces imo

**ignitethephoenix** (11): why aren’t they more popular, this song is so good! They should have made Apple Music K-pop 2021 hits playlist which is like half this rate if things were right in the world.

**LilacDaffodils** (11): my most listened to kpop song of 2021 for a reason. The reason being it's perfect.

**maybecrf** (11): i can feel this song invading the creases of my brain, pair it with killer visuals and you have the best song here.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): THE ONLY UNNATURAL THING IS HOW GOOD THIS IS IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL

**Tazzachar** (11): the way the synth introduction reverberates into the track is extremely catchy, and I love the way the beat builds from there. I decided to give this my 11 because it's the punchiest song to me from the groups in this rate and has been stuck in my head a lot this year.

**Victerade** (11): SOTY OF 2021 I DONT KNOW HOW TO PUT HOW MUCH I LIKE THIS SONG INTO WORDS ITS JUST SO GOOD THE MINI AND MV TOO LIKE WOAH CHILL OUT

**xxipil0ts** (11): - https://twitter.com/dustbin_nie/status/1468827890997366792

**yatcho** (11): Finally some good fucking food

**anothertown** (10): they don't know how to miss!!

**apatel27** (10): Destroying the competition this effortlessly should be illegal

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): slay

**bespectacIed** (10): So prophetic of wuju to preemptively describe their Queendom win with this title 💕 I want to sabotage this so bad because I'm still mad af with them, with ujungs, with MNET, with south korea, with taylor swift, (no connection, im just mad at her), with the universe for conspiring against loona. But this is winner material. Like this kinda has to win, just for the absolute chaos. My homosexual gene is a slave to this Itaewon gay nightclub bop

**bulforster** (10): I'm not unnatural because I'm gay, I'm unnatural because of how much I yass at the final chorus.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): they put their whole wujussy into this one

**Gonza\_90** (10): Best discovery of the rate

**hikkaru** (10): REALLY REALLY REALLY UNNATURAL!!!!!!

**Kadenfrost** (10): They didn't have to slay so hard with that chorus

**mayolizard** (10): the chorus killed me, revived me, then spit on me YASS

**moonshxne** (10): pop perfection

**pig-serpent** (10): It takes a minute but when it gets to where it’s going it’s really good.

**PSSST12** (10): NOW if they released songs like this instead of what they were doing maybe they wouldnt have tanked for this long.

**Qwilphish** (10): WJSN never miss, but this was a home run of all home runs. The anti chorus that explodes into a real chorus really tickles my gay brain in all the right ways. There's not one spot of this song that loses energy or feels incomplete. PERFECTIOOOOOONNNNN

**raggedy-princess** (10): expensive

**ricki** (10): wjsn about to die so taeyeon probably wanted them to be happy

**runaway3212** (10): this is a gay anthem

**sarcasticsobs** (10): *VOCALS*. Almost relentless, obsessed

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): really really really really like this song

**welcome2thejam** (10): Man, what a fantastic listen. Love the chorus, and once it picks up the first time, it hits the perfect pace

**Zypker125** (9.9): It’s truly unnatural for a WJSN song to slap THIS hard.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.6): it just slaps

2021inKPOP: **TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): god wjsn just dont know how to make a bad song

**wavingwolves** (9.1): A SONG FOR THEIR GAY FANS <3

**BasedButta** (9): i love how they’re SCREMING 80% of the song

**chancehugs** (9): Immaculate song. That pre-chorus-to-chorus one-two-punch is everything.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): when no one got me WJSN got me

**IsaiahTB0** (9): now this is how you do a MOMENT, give us a SONG, give us a SLAY. Girlies looked gorgeous and gave DOWN.

**Kayaking11116** (9): it’s a certified bop. like its so good

**poemforsmallthings** (9): they really did have gay people singing about being unnatural

**skargardin** (9): RELLY REALLY UNNATURAL

**vayyiqra** (9): Omg they said Hana! They get me. Anyway I don't know this group but can see why this is hyped because it's really enjoyable and fun. Also, relatable lyrics? I too am very awkward and weird!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This is like the definition of bop!

**sage** (8.6): the one tweet about wjsn getting gay people to sing about being unnatural lives in my head rent free

**aestheticen** (8.5): Dawon finally getting the lines that she deserves... and no not the hot Dawon from SF9

**BaconShoes** (8.5): fun af

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): i had to watch the mv for this again because i got too distracted thinking about seola and exy

**whoisValensi** (8.5): Ah damn I was hoping this would be a cover of the CRX song. But this is fun! Perhaps this song is also for the gays... (I'm gonna say this and it's gonna already be top 5 or smth prior to my ballot submission.)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Weirdly enough their slay feels very natural actually.

**DaBigBoi** (8): Is this the word kpop fans use to talk about their faves’ voices after joining a company?

**Esh\_Kebab** (8): The pre-chorus is to die for.

**imasalesman** (8): they didn’t deserve to win Queendom but this song slaps

**vhqv1997** (8): catwalk music these days go hard af

**mimins** (7.5): close to being a certified bop but I think the vocals in the chorus are too high for the instrumental

**seanderlust** (7.5): "I just don't think it's natural...mama let's research" - WJSN in 2021

**2l82bstr8** (7): it's fine, a little shouty

**Cooler\_lin** (7): i mean it's no 'secret', but it's fun! and I do not hate fun

**frogaranaman** (7): this is almost an Imanbek song I feel like

**ilyyyyy** (7): it's okay, i don't like their main vocalist's voice so i like it as much as that allows

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the way i saved 2 songs from this EP and neither were this

**jasannn** (7): a good song that I should’ve replayed more but Butterfly dampened my feelings for the group

**rslashpoopheads** (7): all WJSN songs sound the same to me but in a good way

**ebooks#5454** (6): the only thing i know about WJSN is that instagram kept giving me ads for their collab with some hand cream company and i took the quiz to see which cream and matching idol i got, i forgot both except it was the yellow one and the idol was like "mhm i love this scent its so fresh and clean with hints of floral" and i was like "hmm i like fresh and clean with hints of floral lemme buy this" i did not buy it

**jay duh** (6): dont get me started all i have to say is disappointing as fuck

**orbiteezus** (6): for some reason this song never clicked with me, but its alright

**SkylarV** (5.5): I wish we could've rated New Me instead so I could give out a 10 to one (1) song on this rate (aside from my 11)

**Roxieloxie** (5): a song about trying to date medusa

**sabooyah** (5): mid

**Stryxen** (5): grows off me more each listen

**celladonn** (4): This sounds very shrill to me, something just seems off

**akanewasright** (3.5): yeah I’m sorry something about this sounds off to me on the production front ~~it sounds unnatural if you will~~

**NotWith10000Men** (3.5): feels very choppy

chenle: this is a good song so i'm not saying it's undeserved, but i legitimately had no idea it was this popular?? i didn't even predict it being in the top 10, i totally get why popheads would like this but it wasn't on my radar of top 2 contenders lmao

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): It was only a matter of time for an English song without even a lick of Korean in it to win a K-pop rate. I can’t be too mad at it. It’s a good pop song that shows the charm of each individual member and also the first English song from a Korean group to not have a single bad lyric! I feel like “the feels” is not something anyone should be saying in 2021, but if anyone can try to bring that phrase back to the mainstream, Twice can do it. Might this be their 10th best single at best? Yes! But they finally won!

---

**2dina3dworld** (11): I once heard this in a department store bathroom and that bathroom didn’t even have a lock so I just had my foot up against the door trying not to bop while taking a piss. Anyway, something about that incident made it click.

**akanewasright** (11): This is the only song in the rate that brings me anywhere near the amount of joy that my favorite k-pop songs do

**ImADudeDuh** (11): I mean come on. It was unfair to the rest of the rate that this was in

**Stryxen** (11): basic but idgaf I just love it so much

**TragicKingdom1** (11): i'm not surprised this ended up flopping in the US despite the push but i was really rooting for it

**aestheticen** (10): Now this is how you do an English release

**amr** (10): I got hit by a car and broke a bone a week after this came out and all throughout my physical therapy attempting to fully do the point choreography for this song was how I measured my progress. I think around mid february was when I could fully lift up my arm without pulling a muscle smt smt twice Ur music saved me etc etc

**anothertown** (10): jihyo.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): apologies to BTS but this is the best English song in the rate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Three and a half minute long yaasss grenade.

**bluetriangles04** (10): And when I say this is the best English debut song for a K-Pop group? This song takes the retro trend that was still relevant at the time and mixes it with TWICE's signature sparkle. I feel like any other original English song premiering before this one for them would not make any sense, and this rollout was perfect before their full album in the fall, solidifying their space in K-Pop as a consistent girl group constantly bringing it even in other markets.

**celladonn** (10): One of the best kpop english releases, soo addictive

**CrimsonROSET** (10): if this wins i’m not mad

**DaBigBoi** (10): I firmly believe this is THE quintessential English K-Pop debut. It embodies TWICE well without pandering too much to a Western audience. It’s simple, catchy pop fun.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): YOU HAVE STOLEN MY HEART OH YEAH

**frogaranaman** (10): correct

**hanpop** (10): i still do this dance randomly

**hikkaru** (10): deserved the north american success of dynamite/butter

**hunnybee12** (10): nayeon we love you

**jay duh** (10): all these racks so yummy

**Kadenfrost** (10): Really nice for an english release, quintessential twice, only needed more Jeongyeon lines!!!

**Kayaking11116** (10): first of all how is Twice gonna comeback 3 times within a year but also, this is one of the most iconic songs to come out from 2021

**La-lamp** (10): Doesn't feel english, it was almost the 11, hard decision

**MassiveThief** (10): disgustingly catchy. hasn't left my brain since it came out.

**maybecrf** (10): what a track, crazy

**mayolizard** (10): catchy slay

**pig-serpent** (10): Everytime I hear a song like this I instantly understand why Twice appears to be the biggest name in kpop right now.  Absolutely incredible.

**plastichaxan** (10): this may or may not be due to me learning the chorus through the ph charts videos cause it slayed

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): already iconic

**PSSST12** (10): An eleven contender. One of twice's best song and one of the best english songs released by a kpop group in general. That chorus just HITS 😩

**Qwilphish** (10): TWICE really hit it out of the park for their first fully english track. They sound great, the song is so catchy, and that dance is sooooo good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): so many women in their 20s going to prom you'd think it’s a scene in euphoria

**ricki** (10): so gfriend and red velvet finally have rate wins, can we finally agree and decide to give twice the win? haven't they suffered enough?

**skargardin** (10): YOU HAVE STOLEN MY HEART OH YEAH!!

**sliced-peaches** (10): itching to give this my eleven but im afraid its not in the cards for twice

**vayyiqra** (10): Yeah this is really catchy and has winner energy so I'm okay with 10ing it. I'm not the biggest Once ever but would be happy if this won. "I wanna be your BOOOO" is funny though.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Not giving this my 11 unfortunately, but I will be very shocked if this doesn't win. Out of all the songs here this is the one that deserved to be a crossover hit in America the most. It's literally one of the most perfect K-Pop songs (and songs in general!) I've ever heard, it sounds fun and bubbly, and the English lyrics aren't just serviceable (which is apparently a lot to ask for in this rate) but it's actually really well-written? "A mystery allure" is just a beautiful phrase to read and sing. I hope Twice get to have their time in the American spotlight one day!

**whoisValensi** (10): This is the best English K-Pop song to ever English K-Pop song. I could expand upon why I feel like that but it is 5:32am and I don't feel like doing so <3. OKAY I LIED I'M GONNA DO IT. Not only does the song keep TWICE's distinct flavor they've carved for themselves in South Korea, but it's fucking catchy as HELL. When many of these K-Pop acts go to America they try to play around w/ whatever sound/genre/"vibe" is popular in America right now but TWICE weren't in the mood for that clearly and it worked out for them! Sure I've never heard this song on the radio or anything but goddamnit this is how every group should do it.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.8): i love this but it just isn't really a 10

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): this needs to win as reparations for the last gg rate

**Gonza\_90** (9.5): Pure Joy

**jasannn** (9.5): One small detail I really enjoyed is how in the verses, one member would start the line and another member would finish the line and how they smoothly transitioned that.

**wavingwolves** (9.5): the best english kpop song to ever exist and it's not even close

**cherryices** (9.2): [english vocal slayage]

2021inKPOP: **BaconShoes** (9): undeniable bop

**chancehugs** (9): THEY HAVE STOLEN MY HEART OH YEAH

**coolfluffle** (9): can't deny that twice's western power is growing and this was just the beginning

**flavasavavandal** (9): the pre-chorus is a Kesha tribute you can’t unconvince me

**mimins** (9): oh this one fucks

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): deserved to be a smash hit and win 5000 grammys multiple emmys etc

**welcome2thejam** (9): When your hooks pack this much power, who needs anything else?

**xxipil0ts** (9): - son chaeyoung if u r reading this i would die for you

**yatcho** (9): not just good for an english release

**ebooks#5454** (8.8): if any other group put this out it would get clowned but TWICE has cracked down the scientific method of being perfect

**bulforster** (8.6): See you at #4!

**Victerade** (8.5): the hype it got on tiktok rlly surprised me but happy that it did. my girlies deserve that

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): **Underneath the neon lights, baybay, electricity tonight, baybay**

**BasedButta** (8): me when the evil wizard shoots lightning into my heart, killing me instantly

**bespectacIed** (8): I'm imagining old JYP on on his deathbed still clicking on his laptop, pushing a gg to the US market lol. This was fun but the verses kinda clunky

**IsaiahTB0** (8): Cute track, like the production, catchy lyrics, etc.

**melody** (8): THIS IS HOW YOU DO A ENGLISH KPOP SONG (that group take notes!)

**orbiteezus** (8): kinda at the point in the ballot where i don’t really know what to say but this was a fun song

**Roxieloxie** (8): i cant believe twice is gonna win this rate by being the only band that had good songs sent

**seanderlust** (8): behbeh

**Tazzachar** (7.5): I don't love english releases, but this was still very cute and catchy

**NotWith10000Men** (7.2): twice's songs are just... cute. and not much else

**moonshxne** (7): it’s weirdly the exact opposite of “Alcohol-Free” where everyone sounds great EXCEPT Mina in the pre-choruses (the mix just sounds so weird there)

**rslashpoopheads** (7): if I pretend I don't understand English this is a banger

**sabooyah** (7): fun!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): its fine i guess for an english kpop song but its nothing mind blowingly amazing like some onces claim it is

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): borders between fun cute bop and creepy parasocial idol song

**vhqv1997** (7): can't believe this song was released in 2021 it feels like something meghan trainor would have released right after all about that bass

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.5): kinda back to school commercial but its cute

**apatel27** (6): Such a safe song

**Zypker125** (5.7): Tell me you wouldn’t believe me if I said that these lyrics were written by a 10-year-old.

**2l82bstr8** (5.5): maybe we should take things slow sorry

**Cooler\_lin** (5.5): it's funky in the way that butter is funky but it's definitely a better song

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4.5): why are we hyping such a mid song…

**Islands** (4): This is twice’s weakest disco/retro song to me sorry none of the melodies are good to me and the production is so wack compared to songs like Up No More or even Scientist

**runaway3212** (4): see you in all stars!

**ilyyyyy** (2): my least favorite twice title track after yes or yes, it just annoys me

**SkylarV** (1): tfw you post cringe on main...

So this is what it’s come down to, huh?

With the crowning of “The Feels” as 2021’s single greatest piece of music, Popheads has finally completed their transition from pretentious indie rag to absolute, unsalvageable garbage. Maybe I’m just old and out of touch. Maybe the children are wrong. But I have no idea how a song with such a generic beat and such a generic flow and such generic, mindless lyrics like “The Feels” is even considered a decent piece of music, much less some groundbreaking work of art.

It’s obvious at this point that Popheads has changed, and for the worse. This wouldn’t have happened even five years ago. Back then you could have critiqued Popheads for their writing or their attitude or their politics, but their rates? Their rates contained some genuinely forward thinking, boundary pushing music. When they made a list it felt as if they were really trying to reward the best music of the year. Don’t believe me? Their top three songs of 2012 were Usher’s “Climax”, Frank Ocean’s “Pyramids”, and Grimes’ “Oblivion”, three songs that were unique, innovative, and overall well-crafted pieces of pop music. Let’s go back even further, to 2007. Pophead’s top three songs from that year were Panda Bear’s “Bros”, Battles’ “Atlas”, and LCD Soundsystem’s “All My Friends”. There’s no way, absolutely no way at all, that you can tell me that “The Feels” deserves to be ranked among any of those songs.

And you know what? I actually like some of this list. In the top ten alone I really like “Unnatural” and “ASAP” and “Drunk-Dazed”. But the songs that I do like are simply overwhelmed by the amount of trash elsewhere. And it’s not even as if these “trash” songs have some redeeming qualities here and there. It’s not as if they’re songs that, while well-executed, just fail to connect with me. The reality is that, try as I might, I simply cannot fathom what makes a song like “The Feels” or “Scientist” an enjoyable, forward thinking piece of music. I can’t even fathom what makes those songs “decent”. To me they just sound like absolute, unmitigated, garbage.

So yeah, I’m getting older. What might have connected with me ten years ago may not connect with me now. But Popheads have also changed. And in their attempt to gain a larger audience they’ve shed the bulk of the avant-garde music that might’ve scared off some of their potential audience (could you even imagine something as weird as the 12 minute long psychedelic odyssey that is “Bros” cracking the top ten in 2017?) in favor of music that largely panders to the lowest common denominator.

Congratulations, Popheads. I hope all that extra ad revenue is worth it.

vivianlight: I know, but my answer was ironic as well (that's why I listed Drunk Dazed and ASAP which are loved-hated songs out of that comment, and not Unnatural).

apatel27: More people liked You Lose and Musician wasn't even the highest rated Porter song but somehow it was still the favourite to win?

Like Musician might have been your fav but literally all the evidence points to You Lose being seen as significantly better than Musician by the sub.

Next you'll be telling me Full Moon was a guaranteed win

Hopefully I'll get around to writing the comments I intended on (they were sacrificed for all of the shitposts unfortunately) but my first priority is creating the playlists for each day.

TiltControls: Congrats to MK, Dusk, and OliviaGodrigo for a successful rate! Looks like it was a ton of fun and led to lots of things to discuss! I'll have to catch up on the shitposts later (even if I won't get any of the inside jokes). Also the animated banners look stunning!

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates are (finally) up! 

#**Songs**

Congrats to TWICE for pulling off the rate win today with **The Feels**! The Feels places 1098th in average across all songs. If you think that seems low, well, you're right! It has taken Rolling in the Deep's record for lowest scoring rate winner by just 0.001 point! Rolling in the Deep set this record about 145 rates ago so it might be a while before it's broken again!

* As many could maybe guess, we've got a new lowest scoring leaderboard update! **Permission to Dance** becomes the 11th lowest scoring main rate song ever rated. It just missed the list courtesy of Maroon 5 & Cardi B's Girls Like You just underscoring it.

* Big day for BTS and Ed Sheeran, as **Permission To Dance** also lands a spot on the most 0's leaderboard! The group takes the record for the 2nd most 0's received for a song! It surpasses the previous 2nd placer from the previous K-pop rate; BLACKPINK's ICE CREAM. Still, Dua Lipa's Boys Will Be Boys holds the 1st place record strong with 58 0's attached. 

 * However they aren't the only newcomers to the list as **MONEY** takes a spot as well for most 0's in 13th overall with 22. Honourable mention: **STICKER** is not on the board, but would've made it in 24th if it had one more.

 * **Permission to Dance** also gets a spot on the Zero Magnets leaderboard! With 23.80% of the zeroes from this rate, it places them 8th overall for proportion of the raters that hated it! (Funny enough, also behind BWBB again!)


* Though it missed the most 0s list, it's not the end of the road for records! **STICKER** becomes the 8th most controversial song ever rated! It lands in the top 10 right between Dopesmoker's Sleep and Sia's Santa's Coming For Us	

#**Artists**

**Other Artist Notes**

With new artists come new records!

* **EXO** are the newest members of an exclusive club of 13 other artists that haven't picked up a single 0 under their name! It's a difficult feat, so let's see if it can last!

 * Though they just couldn't make it onto the list; SHINee, SEVENTEEN, and WJSN all only have a single 0 across their songs

* Also a new event happened while getting the data in! Somehow this is also the first time that we've had two artists with the exact same name in the database! With **KAI** here and a previous record for **kai**, the featured artist on Flume's Never be Like You, we've got a pair! In the future I'll need to find a good way to separate these in the Sheets tool, but in the database they are counted as separate artists as luckily they went in completely opposite directions for capitalization.

#**Rates**

* 2021 K-Pop essentials follows the pattern of the past few K-pop rates and becomes the 5th **most participated rate** of all time! It also becomes the 3rd K-Pop rate to currently occupy a spot on the board with K-Pop GG Smackdown and Girl Group Singles in 1st and 9th respectively!

* The rate also takes a spot on the **Zeroes Used** leaderboard, with 80.54% of participants finding something aggrevating enough to give theirs to. This places it 8th across all rates

* 2021 K-Pop just barely misses another leaderboard spot for **lowest average rates**. It was just 0.018 off of taking the Meme Rate's 10th place spot on the board.

I personally think The Feels is a solid choice, for sure top 3 for me and a very valid contender for the top spot.
