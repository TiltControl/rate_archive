**OliviaGodrigo** (4): It’s fine, I guess. Not obnoxious by any means, but I can live without hearing it again.

**1998tweety** (1): Idk what else to say that hasn't been said already. EASILY one of their worst songs and it's a shame this hit #1 over their numerous other smashes. I feel bad saying it but PLEASE work on your pronunciation and enunciation if you're gonna sing in English. I know it's harder to sing in your second or third language but do they not have vocal coaches to help with this??? To be fair though, I don't think that would've saved this song.

**throwaway-7650** (1): BTS! Congrats on breaking the YG first out streak! Honestly, the fact that I didn’t give this a 0 is astounding given that I hate **everything** about it. The lyrics (we really didn’t need that Dynamite callback), the vocals (+ processing - certain lines sung by the vocal line are jumpscares), the choreo (🌽), and WORST OF ALL, THE MV. I would 0 the MV over my actual 0 if I could. Everything from the styling (~~yes I’m being petty about that too, nothing is safe~~), the extended outro, THE UNMASKING AS IF THE PANDEMIC WAS OVER… going to blame everything on Ed Sheeran. 

 PTD just barely manages to eclipse the 3 average. I was really hoping for it to end up with a sub-3 average but I think the 77 (!) combined 1s and 0s get the point across. The fact that it got more 0s (44) than Ice Cream (41) when Smackdown had almost 100 more participants is hilarious. PTD danced around the bottom 5 for the first 15 ballots or so (and then the bottom 2 for the next 15 ballots), but it remained dead last for the rest of the ballots… and I can’t be mad at all, even if it’s technically not my lowest score..

---

**cremeebrulee** (10): i’ve somehow avoided this song up until now and it’s rly not that bad? why is this leaving first hello

**Roxieloxie** (10): inflation era

**Zypker125** (9.7): Yes this is a Kidz Bop song, that’s why it’s fucking amazing (Kidz Bop mini rate was robbed). Fite me idc. Would have gotten a 10 if it had less autotune.

**ebooks#5454** (9.2): this song is cheesy but very cute and it takes me back to everyone being super hopeful about COVID's end and the re-opening of the world but now im kinda like damn re-opening the world was kinda a mistake i blame BTS for all my hope dying

**runaway3212** (9): worst mv in the rate by far

**flavasavavandal** (8): you can’t convince me there aren’t people in the k-pop industry solely dedicated to reviving the sound of S-Club 7

**plastichaxan** (8): this isn’t bad it’s definitely something for the summertime just maybe not for the girlies to have fun

**TiltControls** (8): coming to terms with the fact I might have an Ed bias

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I understand why people don’t like this - it’s very “western radio pop”, and it can be disappointing to see k-pop groups abandon their “k-pop” brand identity when they start promoting globally. (I don’t love Rosé’s On The Ground for this exact reason) The song is also cheesy. But I still can’t help but find this song catchy and fun! I also truly, truly believe that it wouldn’t have been as poorly received if people didn’t know that Ed Sheeran wrote it. I don’t this this all that different from After Midnight, for example

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): controversial opinion maybe? i hated this when it came out but i've warmed up to it. i still think ed sh**r*n should be charged for his crimes against humanity but BTS has enough charm here to more than make up for those crimes

**hanpop** (7): rnb remix >>>>

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): cute nothing more nothing less

=====

2021inKPOP: **DraculaWeekend** (6.5): Who decided to give JK that emo hairstyle

**paigama** (6.5): I liked it a lot when I first heard it on the tv, but when I put it on my earphones I got to hear the vocals and they sound weird and robotic almost all throughout the song. Also it aged a lot so 6.5 it is.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This isn’t great but nowhere near as bad as some of y’all were making it out to be. I like cheesy and cute things.

**milkywayinradius** (6): it's a cute song but Butter just seems more alive. oh the choreo is really weak.. the ending shot dancing was cute!

**poemforsmallthings** (6): I have information that could lead to Ed Sheeran's arrest

**starla\_** (5.8): this is boring but not terrible

**chenle** (5): tbh i don't hate this as much as i did when it first came out but it's still by far their worst title

**DefaultPophead** (5): Would be so good if I couldn't understand English.

**Stryxen** (5): the chorus is kinda cute I'm sorry!!!!!

**welcome2thejam** (5): Glad any future Footloose sequel has their end credits music locked in

**seanderlust** (4.5): it's not bad, it just feels like nothing - just upbeat dancey music that feel like nobody's really that into it. it's the iceberg lettuce of 2021 K-Pop hits.

**DirtyRat583** (4.3): hey google, make me a happy song

**RandomHypnotica** (4.2): this is just a few small tweaks away from being an owl city song

**Kayaking11116** (4): its bad but i feel like its not terrible awful Satan spawn

**MassiveThief** (4): Actually liked this on first listen, and then never again. It took me til this rate to realize I auto skip it when I hear the first notes.

**skargardin** (4): I tend to forget that this even exists

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): you laugh at them now but if carly released this same exact song you’d be going crazy over it

2021inKPOP: **pig-serpent** (3.5): If Harry Styles joined BTS would anyone notice?

**bulforster** (3.2): why are their vocals so garbled

**BasedButta** (3): DENIED. This song is really kind of incredible, I have listened to it like once before this rate and the starting keyboard sounds already make me flinch

**chancehugs** (3): This sounds like a High School Musical reject.

**DaBigBoi** (3): Never forget Ed Sheeran helped write this

**ignitethephoenix** (3): ugh this is so corny and awful no wonder they wanted to go off and do solo stuff after that

**IsaiahTB0** (3): No because this song feels like an elaborate joke. The horrid english pronunciation, horrid vocal production. Who unironically enjoys this?

**maybecrf** (3): im bored

**rotating3Dtext** (3): dreamworks movie core (wtf is UP with their voices)

**sliced-peaches** (3): been following them since dw era this song is so disappointing and completely devoid of anything that makes bts unique as artists

**static\_int\_husp** (3): a BTS song written by Ed Sheeran? It's like they designed this in a lab to make me have an instinctual negative reaction

**yatcho** (3): I see what they're going for but they were NOT successful

**thedoctordances1940** (2.6): i have listened to this song quite a few times and i always forget what it sounds like, but like it just sounds childish? idk it's just so formulaic it feels like it's from a kids show or something

**BaconShoes** (2): yeah this isn’t it sorry

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): um anyway

**Gonza\_90** (2): Why does this exists?

**imasalesman** (2): it’s just so horrible and bland

**jasannn** (2): If you don’t pay attention while listening to the song at all, it’s just a cute filler pop song. However if you do even if a bit, it immediately becomes cringe and corporate from the generic production and chord progression, tone-deaf lyrics, and the stock footage MV.

**SFbby** (2): Permission to ban Ed Sheeran from Kpop please

**vayyiqra** (2): Nvm this IS that bad. There's fun cheese, and this is just bad cheese. This is like a low-tier Disney movie song.

**vhqv1997** (2): i would call this mom pop but i respect mothers too much

**2dina3dworld** (1): permission denied, release a song as good as Blood, Sweat and Tears again and then maybe we can talk.

**aestheticen** (1): You can tell a British person wrote this because nobody cares about Elton John in Asia

**agentofscranton** (1): sounds like a glee original song that they'd do at regionals

**akanewasright** (1): what the hell are these vocals…

**apatel27** (1): What a lifeless song

**bespectacIed** (1): now if butter I can somehow excuse, I can't seem to do the same to this. Like I am tired, go give us nothing. proof that armys will eat anything up

**bluetriangles04** (1): More uninspired than anything from BTS before, I could not stand this song on release. There's a thick, noticeable, black line for me between inoffensive and completely devoid of anything. What does this song bring to the table that makes it stand out? Not really anything. What we get in return is an abysmal instrumental, followed by some of the worst mixing for them as of recent, the cheesiest lyrics ever AND just a complete lack of the artistry found in their past work. At least Butter was FUN!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (1): ed sheeran has the opposite of a midas touch - everything he touches turns to shit… this feels like those motivational posters that white wine moms share on facebook but in song form.

**hikkaru** (1): it isn't a real single it's just for the secret life of pets 2

**jay duh** (1): jimin sounding like naevis but hes still meow meow material

**mayolizard** (1): i HATE this song i fear and giving this song a 0 (changed it to a 1 after hearing THE BOYZ song) as a former army is hilarious to me i just cant stand this work playlist sounding ass song like what were they thinking (spoiler alert they were thinking about a billboard #1 and money)

**moonagenightmares** (1): jimins voice in this cracked me up

**nicolas** (1): turn it off!!!

**orbiteezus** (1): why did they make the rap line sing. I did not need to hear j-hope or RM sing.

**Qwilphish** (1): this was a tough moment for us all

**ricki** (1): never has a song this dull and bland offended me as much as this

**sarcasticsobs** (1): Soulless

**wavingwolves** (1): how could this be worse in reality than the memory of it i had in my head...

2021inKPOP: **2l82bstr8** (0): anti-mask propaganda

**celladonn** (0): I had a higher tolerance than many for BTS' sellout era but this was my limit. I despise this, I'm absolutely allergic to this corny slop

**cherryices** (0): i had low expectations, and yet!

**cofie** (0): a shining symbol of everything that musically went wrong with BTS and their attempts to break into the US industry

**Cooler\_lin** (0): speaking of a generic ass, boring ass, lame ass, pop song with no staying power in my brain aside from me wanting to turn it off

**CrimsonROSET** (0): this is the worst attempt at born this way we’re rating this month

**ernie** (0): (i was trying to wait to give another song a 0 but this song just pisses me off and i couldn't wait.... i have to give this one a 0, something about this entire song is just so unoriginal, from the melody to the chorus everything is just awful.... this sounds like something Jonas Brothers would release.)

**Esh\_Kebab** (0): The fact that this trash song might actually be many people's first exposure to K-pop is so fucking sad.

**frogaranaman** (0): they had to give me permission to dance because I sure as hell wasn't gonna dance to this song without being told

**HoshiLock** (0): I listened this song 15 times and all of them I hate it

**hunnybee12** (0): You’re a PopHead 🤢. Do you get how your opinion literally does not matter. Stanning BTS enriches ARMYs minds because they expose us to many different cultural experiences and concepts. What does Carly Rae Jepsen do? Tell you to touch yourselves? Get a job. 🙄🥱

**ilyyyyy** (0): my least favorite bts song, whats worse, bc of this one they stopped playing butter as often on the radio and i loved randomly hearing butter at work >:(

**ImADudeDuh** (0): https://i.imgur.com/30kKcBL.mp4

**Jhe116** (0): a song with no soul whatsoever

**Kadenfrost** (0): I gave this a zero solely because we had to perform this on a zoom meeting </3

**LilacDaffodils** (0): I listen to kpop to avoid this kind of pop music. It's so undeniably catchy but I just can't tolerate it I promise you I like BTS music it just tends to be the b-sides these days.

**melody** (0): terrible 2

**mimins** (0): girl what.

**MoonlightByWindow** (0): a perfect representation of everything the bts brand stands for nowadays - an entirely soulless, pandering, infantile, cash-grabbing, grammy-hungry, throwing-the-towel-in, knowing-their-mindless-fans-will-eat-up-anything-they-release-and-claim-it’s-the-pinnacle-of-artistry- et cetera et cetera. “but wait,” i hear you ask, “u/MoonlightByWindow, isn’t all kpop soulless and cash-grabbing? isn’t everyone we’re rating here slaves to the corporate machine until they turn 35 and expire?” well, yes - but at least those people have the decency to actually SOUND GOOD (most of the time anyway) and give us some bops to dance to. ironically, dancing is the last thing this song makes me want to do. everything about it is absolutely terrible - the awful styling (namjoon’s yellow highlighter hair combined with jungkook having a literal emo fringe…aurkay), the vocal processing especially on the raps, the awful dynamite throwback (who asked?), the choreo engineered to be simple enough that they can teach it to late-night hosts and zumba moms can safely follow it, the theft of the chant-and-clap final chorus from yg entertainment, the ripping off the masks in the MV (objectively funny lol), and finally the song itself literally giving target commercial. at this point i’m convinced hybe swapped yoongi out for a body double in 2020 because i refuse to believe that the actual min yoongi is satisfied with the quality of work they’ve been putting out recently, no ma’am. every night i get on my knees and pray to god that bts finally win a grammy so they can stop terrorising us with this alleged “music” and get back to releasing pop excellence like run (also i recently learnt that there are people out there who call themselves armys even though they’ve only heard their 3 english songs?? and apparently they’re content with not diving deeper into bts’ pre-2018 discography, which is literally excellent?? very strange people). ALSO JIN GO ENLIST ALREADY YOU’RE A HAG AND LITERALLY ADD NOTHING TO THE GROUP!11111!!!!111!!!

**moonshxne** (0): Ed Sheeran wrote this and it shows (...though the songwriting is pretty terrible, the true offender is actually just. every. single. aspect. of the production, but it truly can’t be a coincidence that this evokes the very same trite and soulless quality of “bad habits.” this manages to be WORSE, though! Corey Feldman unironically did better on *Angelic 2 The Core*.)

**NotWith10000Men** (0): the autotune is atrocious

**omgthenerve** (0): this is the first "0" I've ever given in a rate, I cannot adequately explain how much I dislike this song on a visceral level

**PSSST12** (0): Tbh Its just sad watching BTS become the shadow of what they used to be. For such an inoffensive song, this is so offensive to me 😭 like this is bottom of the barrel shit for them. So dissapointing (watch this break the record for most number of zeros 😶)

**raggedy-princess** (0): not granted <3

**rslashpoopheads** (0): cringeus maximus

**sabooyah** (0): this is so generic and the autotune and crazy high pitch (poor mixing ?) throughout ruins any personality it might have had otherwise

**Saison\_Marguerite** (0): the Maroon5ification of BTS :noitssad:

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): the top comment on YouTube is like “just realized this is 5 minutes!! it feels way shorter!!” like im sorry what this feels longer than a 10 hour video essay on Harry Potter (and it’s 3 minutes!)

**tiltheendoftheline** (0): I won't even say anything, it's just beating a dead horse at this point.

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): Zero-ing this out of principle. Also cause it's bad. I appreciate ARMYs for doing a lot of good in the world, but I will NEVER forgive them for sending this Disney Channel-tier (actually more like Disney Junior-tier) vapid, saccharine cheesefest to the top of the Billboard 100. In fact, I think "cheesy" is the best word to describe this, especially appropriate since BTS seems to be under the impression that singing about dairy products is the epitome of swag.

**Victerade** (0): permission to stfu and not release any more music

**whoisValensi** (0): Lol no. Stop. Stop right now. First off the video for this song fucking ridiculous (THE MASK REMOVAL MONTAGE MAN... I still mask up at work, yeah...). Secondly, I don't have to say the words, I'm sure I'm gonna be surrounded by a bunch of comments w/ the same opinion but holy shit this song just blows on multiple levels. Lyrics bad, the music itself is not good... Let's not even getting the almost monotone-roboticness of the autotune and all that shit applied here. I've ranted on that many times in private (and will continue to do that). But like... This is a fucking sell-out death knell if I've ever seen one. If "Dynamite" and "Butter" were warning signs, this is like a field of red flags that are already on fire. Truth be told I'm glad to see the guys have now spoken out on how soulless this all has been because... Jesus... I feel like if you took lil 2015 me (that's when I first found out about BTS) and showed him this he would have so many questions you just couldn't give him answers for. I'll cut myself off right here but like... Hopefully whatever they release after this break will be nothing like this in any way.

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): And next up, another song that never left the bottom 5. Actually, for the vast majority of the submission period, this was #64. Then, after the 110th ballot (less than 3 days before the rate was due), it exchanged places with #65 a few times… and never left this position since. 

 I do have to admit the “LALI SALAMI” part is catchy and from my score, you can tell that I don’t find it irredeemable, but it’s pretty bad. Bekuh Boom continues to terrorize YG’s output (more on that later), there’s this gorilla (?) grunting (??) throughout the song, and the bridge is just confusing. No, I do NOT need some L-A-L-I-S-A! But my least aspect of LALISA has to be the choreo. The solo debut of the main dancer in the most popular gg, not just limited to idols, getting… that? I hope Lisa can show off her dancing skills more  if/when she ever releases another solo.

**1998tweety** (2): BP's career is so frustrating. They genuinely started out quite strong but everything after D4 has been so disappointing except for a b-side here and there. And the worst part is y'all will continue to eat this garbage up. I know this sounds so pretentious but it annoys me so much to see BP be the most popular girl group when they continue to put out incredibly mediocre to straight up awful songs. There are so many stellar GGs putting out amazing songs that get no recognition. This applies less to the people doing this rate, cause obviously you've listened to a lot more k-pop than the average person, but it's so frustrating that BP is what comes to most people's minds when they think of k-pop girl groups. And I don't think it's even that hard to put out decent songs???? Like I'm not expecting BP to shit out 10s or 11s but I really don't think it's difficult to make average songs?

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): If someone held a gun to my head and forced me to listen to the whole song, I’d probably ask them to pull the trigger

---

**bespectacIed** (10): yes I hated this on release day, and YES this 10 might be undeserved. But idc... this is my south east asian cousin right here, I need to support. But seriously, I unironically enjoy this now for what it is. A brash, unapologetically narcissistic BOP. If you get it, you get it. If you don't, unclench your butt

**HoshiLock** (10): This song and the next one are really catchy and I never get tired of them

**ilyyyyy** (10): BABY GET THE MEGAPHONE PUT IT ON SPEAKER the 'my man' line is so funny. best bp solo so far, it's so fun. and this is coming from a huge rosé and jennie fan. i wonder if it's weird for her to sing her own name so many times lol

**jay duh** (10): 2nd best song ever

**RandomHypnotica** (10): wtf I thought I hated this but relistening I was like "oh this FUCKS" ????

**thedoctordances1940** (10): like she literally references the flintstones how is this not a 10

**whoisValensi** (10): I'm giving this a 10 because I have no fucking taste. If you thought I ever had an ounce of taste you were wrong! Cause guess what fuckers I do know the attitude! Sure the lyrics of this are absolute trash and the beat isn't the greatest but you know what when this song comes on I have FUN. And that is what matters. ^thomaybeimalilbiasedcauseguesswhomybpbiasis. Also I'm not sure how many people are gonna point it out but that fucking bridge throwing in traditional Thai music is so fucking good like ughhhhhhhh. That's a top instrumental moment in a K-Pop song from 2021 for me, I'm sorry.

=====

2021inKPOP: **ebooks#5454** (9): i was dreading this but honestly its pretty good; shocked i like her songs bc i hate blackpink with a passion

**NotWith10000Men** (9): i love the attitude

**yatcho** (8.4): its camp

**bigbigbee** (8): The first part is a bit annoying but fun, and then the bridge-to-outro section is legitimately really good

**Kadenfrost** (8): The beat is NASTY... but that's about it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): post-good

**Cooler\_lin** (7.9): after this song has been stuck in my head for the past three days...also the part after LALISAAAAAAAAAAA.....my jaw dropped

**BaconShoes** (7.5): kind of terrible but also fun and camp idk

**mayolizard** (7.5): overhated

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): i was planning on giving this a 2 but honestly it’s kinda hitting rn

**chancehugs** (7): Love everything about the song except the basic ass chorus. Lisa is capable of so much more.

**MassiveThief** (7): I don't know how and why this grew on me, but it did.

**pig-serpent** (7): r/popheads hates fun.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): you know what this isn’t as bad as I recall but it’s not really good either. The rapping on the beat change is pretty good

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): the first time i heard this song it was the bridge part so i was really surprised when the song just wasn't that

**Tazzachar** (6.5): it never really goes anywhere for me, and has a very generic beat

**moonagenightmares** (6.2): teddy is a one trick pony

**Esh\_Kebab** (6.1): Lisa is the rare rapper who can actually take pride in saying that she doesn't write her own lyrics.

**2l82bstr8** (6): baby get the megaphone, put it on speaker/I said I can't hear you, so you need to speak up

**bluetriangles04** (6): Saying I disliked this song on release would be an understatement. However, I've come to appreciate it for some of the more breakout parts like the bridge breakdown and her rap verses. While I still am not over that weird ass lyric in the second verse about anyone coming for her man, the song isn't as bad as I had felt on release and its only smooth sailing from here out.

**kpoppyko** (6): honestly slaps but probably bc i know less of what shes saying

**melody** (6): this is better then Money by a 3 metre distance but alas

**MToms** (6): So are we betting this goes out first? History proves these rates are rife with Blonks.

**maybecrf** (5): i sleep

**plastichaxan** (5): if i ever have a drag daughter of my own my only condition will be that her name is lali salami

**rotating3Dtext** (5): her rap is so funny

**rslashpoopheads** (5): please for the love of god free BP from Teddy

**welcome2thejam** (5): Eh, I've heard worse. By her. And it's next on the playlist.

**coolfluffle** (4): worst bp solo so far but great dance

**cremeebrulee** (4): not polisa … girl acab!!!

**mimins** (4): conflicted on this song because there are parts I enjoy but it's just not cohesive enough for me to like it

**paigama** (4): catchy but horrible

**Qwilphish** (4): Imagine if they gave Lisa an actually good song, they were too scared so they limited her power

**runaway3212** (4): this song is horrible... that said i kinda like the english rap i do not give a fuck

**SFbby** (4): Say Love me salami Love me salami

**skargardin** (4): erm anyway

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): L-A-L-A-S-A

**vayyiqra** (4): This is bad, but I'm giving it a few points for trying. It's better in concept than theory. See, I like Blackpink (more or less). I like Lisa. I like the idea of integrating Thai music with pop, which is a niche that hasn't been done a lot before. The main problem is that it sucks. What's with the random "hey!" adlibs? What's with the dog barking sounds? The beat is good but everything about this is really dumb. A failed experiment, maybe.

**ricki** (3.5): if there's one thing teddy will do is make sure he makes the most out of that splice subscription

**seanderlust** (3.5): this instrumental is annoying but it does get some points that i started singing along with the hook before the song ended

**alwayswords** (3): the bridge is this song’s saving grace

**astrologicalangel** (3): ehhhhh

**IsaiahTB0** (3): The only good part of the song is the lil switchup and even then its not that good. Teddy needs to play to her strengths (Money)

**Kayaking11116** (3): this song really had no chance considering its right after Bad Love on this list. the second rap makes me cringe and some parts are good but they dont flow

**sliced-peaches** (3): meh

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): I liked the Thai part of the MV! Can Lisa do more of that?

**anothertown** (2): 'we're running out of studio time' 'ah fuck we have a couple more bars that haven't been written' 'try LALISA LALISA LALISA LALISA LALISA LALISA'

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (2): the common blackpink l

**BasedButta** (2): gameboy glitching type beat - honestly that bridge is so bad i had deleted it from my mind. Overall could still be worse I guess

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Yeah I can have some fun with Money but this one just sounds ugly and bad.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (2): LALI SALAMI WE LOVE (?) YOU!!!

**jasannn** (2): this doesn’t even have a good yg outro. how sad

**metanoira** (2): lali salami

**mrach** (2): mom they got the best 3rd gen dancer doing tiktok dances in place

**orbiteezus** (2): the world if teddy didn’t produce anymore futuristic society meme but i can’t stop thinking about ‘rocks on my wrist so they call them the flintstones’

**sabooyah** (2): boring .. she looks great in the mv tho

**DefaultPophead** (1.5): Not the worst in the rate, but pretty darn close. Sounds like a Danny Gonzalez parody song without any of the self-awareness.

**DirtyRat583** (1.5): this sounds like every other kpop song, but stretched thin

**TiltControls** (1.5): Maybe gets points for inspiring a great discord emote name. That's about it

**2dina3dworld** (1): this could have the best verses in the entirety of the history of hiphop but nothing could make me overlook that “chorus”.

**aestheticen** (1): Narcissistic, my god, I love it

**apatel27** (1): The ultimate proof stans are incapable of recognising bad music

**bulforster** (1): Loli salami

**celladonn** (1): I love you Lisa but this is so bad ❤️

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): say lali salami lali salami

**CrimsonROSET** (1): i don’t think a lot of people will be calling you

**DaBigBoi** (1): "How would you describe your solo sound?" "Like what do you mean [. . .] It's just me" "Just you?" "Just me Lalisa" - Lisa with Zach Sang

**frogaranaman** (1): I don't have a joke for this, it is just plain terrible

**hikkaru** (1): i don't even know what to say. lisa has taken me to hell

**ImADudeDuh** (1): oh

**Islands** (1): It's just not good like it's not even boring because i can hear it switching up a couple times but god

**moonshxne** (1): Commenting to clarify that these Lisa songs all deserved 0’s, because I did not remotely enjoy anything about this. The way a song worse than both is part of this rate...

**nootnoot781** (1): this feels racist somehow

**PSSST12** (1): Now what the fuck is this 😭😭 beckuh boom, TRUST you will be dealt with 😤

**Roxieloxie** (1): this has gotta be my 0

**sarcasticsobs** (1): “catch a case” jfc, put Bekuh Boom in JAIL already

**starla\_** (1): runner-up 0 contender

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): really wish i could give two 0s in this rate. it takes a lot of talent to make two of the worst songs ive ever heard on the same ep tbh

**vhqv1997** (1): this song is worth 2 points for that bridge but i deduct 1 point because lisa lied when she said the mv would show her forehead

**wavingwolves** (1): i wonder if this song is named after anything important

**akanewasright** (0): I’m honestly continuously shocked by how just… bad this is.

**DraculaWeekend** (0): Sticker is lucky that this song was in the rate

**exciting\_patient4872** (0): We know your name, chill.

**letsallpoo** (0): this is one of the worst songs i've ever had the misfortune of hearing. every time i think i've come to terms with the fact that blackpink is a collection of hot women first and a musical act second, they (or one of their members) excrete something that's so mind-bogglingly terrible that i'm forced to recalibrate my understanding of how bad their music truly is. if you are an adult who likes this song i think of you less as a person and i mean every word of that

**milkywayinradius** (0): out of principle i have to give my 0 to any song title that has the name of its artist in it. plus this song is not good.

**poemforsmallthings** (0): sorry

**SkylarV** (0): I don't know if I'm allowed to rate between 0 and 1 but I don't care, LALISA and MONEY both deserve my zero, truly the bottom of the barrel, just atrocious songwriting

**Zypker125** (0): Did she say what her name was? Idk I think I may have missed it

**1998tweety** (5): This feels objectively bad but I must admit I find the chorus a bit too catchy.

**throwaway-7650** (2): Although BTS ensured that BP wouldn’t occupy the entirety of the bottom 3, that couldn’t stop both of Lisa’s songs going out right after. This had a 3.4+ controversy score at several points and I guess because of that, I shouldn’t be surprised that it placed higher than LALISA… but I still kind of am, because (probably to the surprise of nobody) the song they were the ones fighting for 64th place after ballot 110. Before that, MONEY was almost always at #65, and that’s what I thought the final results would be. Although PTD never left the bottom, the real race to the bottom was run to observe and this came out on top. 

 …I say on top as if it’s not a bottom 3 song in the rate LOL anyway, the saving grace of this song is the outro. The lyrics are even worse than the title track’s, her singing in the prechorus is atrocious, and this song in general is more annoying than entertaining to me. 

 Although they couldn’t lock down the entire bottom 3, could the BP solos take up 3 of the bottom 4? Let’s see…

**OliviaGodrigo** (0): She’s just a walking caricature at this point. Can’t sing, can’t rap, bad wigs, beyond laughable blaccent, always has the worst part in every single Blackpink song. Truly amazing. Everything about her musical persona genuinely pisses me off LMAO how this absolute horse shit got a modicum of success in 2022, 7 years after the death of Iggy Azalea’s career, is truly beyond me.

**flavasavavandal** (10): there is so much wrong with this song, just an endless list of things I could list but idc, this song is just so fun to listen to, i don’t think I will ever get sick of it

**hunnybee12** (10): she slayed and the world knows it

**ilyyyyy** (10): CHECK CHECK CHECK ok i would play this song in the car when leaving for work early in the morning in the middle of winter and it would get me in the right mindset everytime thank you queen

**jay duh** (10): CELINE MY SHOES.

**Kadenfrost** (10): unapologetic booty pop

**maybecrf** (10): tik tok knew

**mayolizard** (10): im an apologist idc

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): TWERKING TWERKING WHEN I BUY THE THINGS I LIKE DOLLAS DOLLAS DROPPING ON MY ASS TONIGHT

**PSSST12** (10): not me switching up on Ms lalice 😭😭 this is a banger idc. When she said DROP SOME MONEY i felt that

**RandomHypnotica** (10): im blaming jules for making me like this

**runaway3212** (10): worst song ever until the final 30 seconds... but my god the final 30 seconds are good

**Stryxen** (10): the worst thing a song can do is bore me. and I am entertained

**ebooks#5454** (9): if you played this for karl marx he would unwrite the communist manifesto

**skargardin** (9): I can't help that this is insanely catchy

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): this is just stupid fun

**wavingwolves** (8.5): this has its merits and the merit in question is that this is a seriously hilarious song

**bespectacIed** (8): this being a smash hit when it's objectively, undeniably a bad song is so funny. Lisa's voice is grating, the lyrics laughably bad. But it kinda slays loooool stockholm syndrome strikes again

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): i have a severe case of stockholm syndrome with this song

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I need to be 100% honest here, and some of you are probably not gonna like this. But the first time I heard that "Drop some money, droppin' all my money" in the wild, I actually kinda liked it. And when I found out that the song in question was actually from Lisa's very derided solo debut, not gonna lie I actually started to like MONEY a lot! Now are the lyrics cringe af? Absolutely! But unlike all the other lyrically cringe songs on this list, Lisa knows how to serve the attitude this kind of song calls for.

2021inKPOP: **bluetriangles04** (7.5): Hearing this EVERYWHERE on TikTok during the pop culture phenomenon of Squid Games was actually the work of a CIA intelligence unit testing new live torture methods out on our generation. While the "dolla dolla bills dropping on my ass tonight" is still a hard pill to swallow in its entirety, the bridge is super well done and has raised my appreciation of this song ever since.

**Cooler\_lin** (7.2): something about her outros make me want to bust a mf move!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I know this is coming for bottom 3 but I’ll take fun, stupid, and catchy over boring and generic any day.

**DraculaWeekend** (7): Alright I can't deny it, this is kind of a banger

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): i went from hating this to ironically stanning to actually liking this… her camp slay..

**Tazzachar** (7): better than the title, but not by much

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): rip karl marx you would’ve hated money by lisa

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): there’s a bop factor here but it just makes me want to listen to Cardi’s Money instead

**chenle** (6): i thought this was straight garbage when it came out but hearing it in tons of tiktoks at the time made me warm up to it... my conscience won't let me give it a good score though 😔

**jasannn** (6): It’s actually pretty good if you don’t take it so seriously.

**Kayaking11116** (6): better than Lalisa because it flows well, but its just not my favorite

**mimins** (6): I've listened to this a few times and I still don't know if I like the outro or not

**NotWith10000Men** (6): another song that reminds me of cardi. hm

**Qwilphish** (6): Its definitely better than LALISA, but... just barely the part that went viral is cute

**BaconShoes** (5.5): dollar bills…dollar bills…

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is so much worse than Lalisa that it honestly becomes good again

**whoisValensi** (5): I'm giving this a 5 not because I'm neutral on it, but because I genuinely still don't know how I feel about this song. Some days this is the most annoying shit I've ever heard with the funniest beat ever (Or at least until "Sticker" came along a week later...) Other days I uhhhh like this? I'm not gonna say I "love" it cause the only part I truly love is the outro. But it's the journey to get there that makes it uhhhhh a make or break deal for me depending on the day. Anyways uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh MY MONEY MOVES! But I fear I will be moving my own money to another musician that's uhhh endorsed by? models for? how this shit works... but whatever for the brand Celine.

**IsaiahTB0** (4.5): Washed Lalisa (bar underground)

**rotating3Dtext** (4.5): 7 rings

**paigama** (4.1): catchier than lalisa but still

**2l82bstr8** (4): crazy how the part where she's dropping dollars on her ass tonight is the only bearable part in the song

**DefaultPophead** (4): Excuse me?

**Gonza\_90** (4): Kind of a song

**MassiveThief** (4): she just be walking around shops twerking? like buying a purse and giving a few booty shakes?

**poemforsmallthings** (4): it's fun to sing along

**sabooyah** (4): still boring

**sliced-peaches** (4): less meh

2021inKPOP: **bigbigbee** (3): I was really relieved to find out that Bekuh Boom is white, because the possibility that is Asian American was very real, and I would have even worse secondhand embarrassment

**DaBigBoi** (2.5): Can I say I was totally unfazed finding out that YG bathrooms have the word “SWAG” embellished on their walls? And that Lisa said “hip hop is in my blood”

**ignitethephoenix** (2.5): Ariana school of writing <3

**celladonn** (2): It's a little better than Lalisa I guess but um. lol.

**chancehugs** (2): Shallow af. Sounds like something some noname tryhard rapper would release.

**cherryices** (2): Im a starving child starving to death and this is the very last thing i have ever heard. Gootbye.

**CrimsonROSET** (2): ‘everyone’s silent’ so true

**kpoppyko** (2): grotesque

**melody** (2): I will post a comment from R/UKO to sum this up: anyways i wanted to make my own bp rap, i’m qualified to be considered a rapper, i’m coming for the billboard charts now you better watch out: yuh, i have all dis dough, watchu mean doe? Ima twerk the night away, issa job to werk all day, watchin you watchin me pay (cha ching like mr krabs), like santa i hella sleigh (cut u like stab, jabs & scabs),hoe, hoe, hoe, don’t you know i’m lo-co, love me cuz i’m so rich, i’m the revolution i ain’t get ditched, so savage when i bring out the boss bitch, i am lalisa i put the black in black pink,,don’t play with me bitch i’m the shit so i stink ,yuh, pass me my du-rags ,watch me finna pop all these price-tags (ow!), say sum bad bout me if you hella dare , my lilies worship me so beware (yikes!), haters mad so imma gon put dem thai braids my hair ,issa whole vibe, like eyeball i make you stare (bada bing)

**pig-serpent** (2): I want to defend this one but…I can’t.

**vhqv1997** (2): "Twerking, twerking when I buy the things I like, Dollar, dollars dropping on my ass tonight" so true bestie

**welcome2thejam** (2): There's a six second section starting at the chorus drop and ending before she starts talking about bread that's good, and the beat itself can be solid. Otherwise, hoo boy

**akanewasright** (1): okay I at least can understand why people would like this song… but my god Bekuh Boom should never work again

**apatel27** (1): Written using Urban Dictionary

**bulforster** (1): the outro the defenders rave over isn't any better than the rest of the song, they just made the fart sounds lower and louder

**frogaranaman** (1): how many layers of irony deep do I need to be to enjoy this

**hikkaru** (1): i could appreciate how absolutely fucking ridiculous these bars are if the song wasn't sonically horrible

**moonshxne** (1): it’s giving “cash grab from a teenage influencer desperate for money”

**nootnoot781** (1): late stage capitalism is a disease

**ricki** (1): i never watched squid game in protest of it making this go viral

**Roxieloxie** (1): nvm this has gotta be my 0

**rslashpoopheads** (1): lol

**SkylarV** (1): I don't know if I'm allowed to rate between 0 and 1 but I don't care, LALISA and MONEY both deserve my zero, truly the bottom of the barrel, just atrocious songwriting

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): add this comment to the “yikes” section too

**Zypker125** (1): Drop 🖐👇 some 💭👨 money, 💰 all 💯 this 😡😞 bread so 🏻👟 yummy, yeah 🙌 Twerking, twerking when 💕 I 👈 buy the 👏👨 things I like 💟 Dollar, 💵 dollars, dropping on 🔛😢 my ass 💋🕍 tonight 😩😜

**aestheticen** (0): I love how music can take you to different places. For instance, when I hear "Money" by LISA playing in public, I will move to another place so that I don't have to listen to it!

**anothertown** (0): did they ever explain why molly mcintire's dad went to war? from the american girl dolls/books? i dont think they were drafting parents at that point in ww2. so did he just enlist and leave a wife and 3 kids at home, to go to london after the blitz? typical

2021inKPOP: **b\_o\_g\_o\_** (0): songs like this should be illegal

**BasedButta** (0): ah… awful song. and the lyrics are abhorrent. Considering we’re in the kpopsphere, where not being able to understand the lyrics is a boon most of the time, this hurts thrice as much for being in english. congratulations, you get my zero! god I hate this

**coolfluffle** (0): i love lisa but this was awful imo, very strained vocals and would have preferred more rap and about a less cringe topic. given how much money bp bring in i had a lot higher expectations and the mixture of aave, strained vocals and poor topic choice cement this as a 0 for me.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): this is so bad and awkward

**DirtyRat583** (0): terrible beat, terrible lyrics - i hate it all

**majid** (0): what the FUCK

**orbiteezus** (0): i was debating between this and PTD to get my zero and like while both are really just bottom of the barrel songs for me both vocally and instrumentally i would (by a very slight margin) rather suffer through PTD

**sarcasticsobs** (0): I listened to this incognito on youtube so it wouldn’t show up as a lastfm scrobble

**starla\_** (0): everything about this song irritates me - the screechy singing, the lyrics, the rhyming of 'money' and 'yummy' and the sad beat.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): i can’t even think about this song without getting deeply uncomfortable

**thedoctordances1940** (0): everything about this is awful, like it just gets rid of the few fun bits that still make blackpink still kinda enjoyable some times and what you're left with is just completely unlistenable

**vayyiqra** (0): Yeah no. "Lalisa" is not good, but it at least tried something. This is just depressing. I mean that it makes feel like dying inside. There's a whole discourse to be had about appropriation of black culture in K-pop, which is rampant and often a bit uncomfortable but I don't want to touch that right now. All I will say is that these lyrics are very embarrassing and this song is seriously lacking in energy and fun and there's nothing enjoyable about it. A low point in Bekuh Boom's wildly inconsistent writing career.

**throwaway-7650** (10): ROBBED! Y’all did the queen dirty omfg… I knew this song wasn’t going to do well and was most likely going to be Day 1 but I did not expect it to be *nowhere near close* to escaping the bottom 5 by the final ballot. I guess the rank graphs set her up a little because for the first 60 ballots or so, I’m Not Cool stabilized around… well, #60. But then, as more ballots (and 0s) came in, it never went back into the 50s nor left the bottom 5 after the 100th ballot. 

 This is one of the most camp songs in the rate. deadass. Only HyunA could come up with the line “I love early mornings / Dawn, Dawn, Dawn” (her boyfriend is Dawn/ex-Pentagon E’Dawn)… like that line alone deserves a 10. I only gave this a 7.1 in my initial scores, but the more I listened to it during MV watch parties, I began to fully enjoy experiencing the song/MV, even if it’s not the most pleasant thing to listen to. Yes, HyunA does come from the LE school of rapping (and nobody comes out a better rapper than LE herself). Yes, I’m Not Cool is basically a YG song in disguise. But, am I going to let those factors get in the way of me giving this a 10? NO! 

 This is the first song I consider to be robbed today but it won’t be the last… the ~~best~~ worst is Yet to Come.

**1998tweety** (6.5): For every good song HyunA puts out, she also releases 5 terrible ones. Oh well. I will say this is surprisingly low though? Like its not great, but there are so many songs here that are so much more offensive and deserved lower placements.

**OliviaGodrigo** (2): Sounds like Blackpink booked another modeling gig so YG donated this to her

---

**BaconShoes** (10): queen

**jay duh** (10): the sexy queen tugged at everglows wigs with this one..

**Kadenfrost** (10): Slayed as usual

**runaway3212** (10): we were robbed of rating camp slay ping pong

**vayyiqra** (10): Lol at Hyuna who is literally a model saying "I'm not pretty". Anyway this is infectious and I can't get over the Nadia Oh vibe here with the Middle Eastern influences. Also I get a strong vibe like Hyo's "Dessert", another song I love. This song is weird and her vocals on it are weird so I understand not liking it, but I can't stop listening to it.

**whoisValensi** (10): STOP SAYING YOU WANT SEXY QUEEN HYUNA BACK SHE'S STILL HERE SHE'S JUST A LIL QUIRKY NOW. \*Jughead's "I'm A Weirdo" speech goes here.* Anyways unpopular opinion maybe? but fuck I love this song lolllllll. Like, only in 2021 can HyunA make a song claiming she's not cool, shouting out her (at the time future) fiance, and just putting the camp level over the top.

**sage** (9.4): im weird. im a wei- gunshots

**ilyyyyy** (9): was really into it when it first released then kinda forgot about it, this is going to reignite my obsession

**maybecrf** (9): banger

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): yass cleopatra

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): I was pre-programmed to love HyunA. Sorry if this song is actually bad.

**bigbigbee** (8): has any genius noticed yet that this has the same BPM as the horrible 4Minute cover of Kelis’ Milkshake and combined the videos?

**bluetriangles04** (8): I can just see the dance without having to watch it at this point, it's been so engrained into my mind lmfao. A solid comeback for HyunA who excels with songs carrying a heavy presence performance wise.

**IsaiahTB0** (8): She stepped outta hag lake into mother lake for a lil dip

**paigama** (8): kinda bad actually but it can't stop being a bop

**Stryxen** (8): IM NOT COOL

**Cooler\_lin** (6.1): catchy but rather disappointing

**chancehugs** (6): The production overshadowed Hyuna's vocals imo. Red is the quintessential Hyuna song for me and this doesn't really come close.

**mimins** (6): kind of disappointing for hyuna but not terrible

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): sorry hyuna

**sliced-peaches** (6): i think if it was 2016 id like this song more

**bulforster** (5.6): At least she seems to know what she's doing

**Gonza\_90** (5): idk about this really

**sabooyah** (5): gets stuck in my head sometimes but i cant really say that i actually like the song lol

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Remember that post here a few years ago saying HyunA was like the Lady Gaga of K-Pop? Yeah… let’s just say I see it here, but not in a good way

**vhqv1997** (5): hyuna and hyoyeon have such hilarious discographies

**ImADudeDuh** (1): this sounds like 2ne1 and thats not a compliment

**La-lamp** (1): Hard to finish, she is right, not cool

**MassiveThief** (1): wow... I was excited to listen to this bc I went HARD for Bubble Pop back in the day, but this was genuinely hard to get through.

**metanoira** (1): absolutely not

**moonagenightmares** (1): the best thing about 4minute was that we didnt have to listen to an entire song of just hyunas voice

**PSSST12** (1): I need another zero. Like, there is nothing salvageable from this auditory garbage 🙄

**RandomHypnotica** (1): this is so bratty and annoying but in a bad way

**SkylarV** (1): This song is not cool...

**Zypker125** (1): This song is easily one of the worst I’ve ever heard and would have easily gotten a 0 from me if it was in any of the other rates, but Lalisa is THAT bad, so unfortunately I have to give this an undeservedly high score of a 1.

**ebooks#5454** (0): This was the worst thing I've ever seen in a rate.

**kyrgyzzephyr** (0): it’s one thing to pull from 2014 edm pop but another to just not do anything interesting to spin it. just plain and dated

**LesApfels** (0): That lazy beat drop is SO grating

**TragicKingdom1** (0): Yeah♡

**1998tweety** (6): I don’t hate this but it would be sooo much better without that grating chorus. Also what’s with this NCT trend of putting out divisive and off puting (dare I say experimental?) songs as the first title track, and then release pop excellence for the repackage?

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): NCT truly amazes me with the way they’re dead set on making the worst songs in existence. We gotta get one from each group too, and we’ve collected all of them in this rate!

**throwaway-7650** (1.1): Rounding out the bottom 5 is the first NCT song to go. The chorus to this is simply unbearable to me. Whoever’s chanting like that (I think it’s Jaemin? I’ll keep blaming Jaemin) needs to shut up immediately. It’s really a shame because the rest of the song is actually pretty good, the prechorus in particular, butI’m never going to get behind making Dream release 127-esque music. 

  The most shocking thing about this song to me is how long it took to get a 0. It spent less than 10 ballots in the 50s (and even then only got to #59 on 3 separate occasions) but it has 28 1s, which is [redacted information]. Hot Sauce ~~thankfully~~ did pick up a few 0s by the end of the submission period and unfortunately lands them in the bottom 5. Going from MFAL doing decently in the BG rate to this… let me send these results to SM actually so they can clearly see what the audience wants.

---

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This song is actually good and anyone who thinks otherwise probably only seasons their food with salt

**Kadenfrost** (10): Dreamies always slaying tbh

**runaway3212** (10): if you hate this you can't eat spicy food im sorry to say it how it is

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I need the Chacarron mashup in the rate reveal pleasee…

**wavingwolves** (10): i always think about how people started saying the title of this basically meant CUM because this song is supposed to be about sucking dick since chili (gochu) is a slang for penis in korean

**chenle** (9.2): hello future deserved this spot

**2l82bstr8** (9): another attempt to make Touch It into a summer bop in 2021... Busta's not gonna clear the sample babes give it up! this is no Hot Hot but it's pretty cool (and I adore the choreo)

**BaconShoes** (9): bop!!!

**bespectacIed** (9): not me dragging stickuh but liking this..... This is CAMP! this is latina coded. This is a banger sorry

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Not quite the avant garde masterpiece of “Sticker” but I’m also enjoying the weirdness here.

**plastichaxan** (9): you've heard of camp 10s but we need to normalize camp 10s when the camp isn't enough to make it a 10

**PSSST12** (9): Now you wont get it the first time. . .

=====

2021inKPOP: **agentofscranton** (8.5): hello future is the superior title but the dreamies stay being the superior nct subunit

**bluetriangles04** (8.5): once I got over the ass job of whoever mixed the shouting part in the chorus, this song easily became replayable for me esp with that EDM out of fucking nowhere in the dance break that was super nostalgic and unexpected. NCT dubstep era incoming?

**mimins** (8.5): GOLLA MA DISH

**IsaiahTB0** (8.2): Loved this when it came out but its grown off quite a bit.

**coolfluffle** (8): pretty fun

**flavasavavandal** (8): the shouty vocal production on the chorus is the worst thing i’ve ever heard, i adore it

**HoshiLock** (8): Even my brother who doesnt listen to kpop like it

**moonshxne** (8): camp

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Now *this* is the type of (expected?) divisive I want from NCT-whatever. I'm certain that some people hate the chorus, but I dig it, and I like the choreo along with really liking the prechorus

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): hot sauce in my bag swag

**bigbigbee** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjI6dCKq18w

**cherryices** (7): this was always good actually

**sabooyah** (7): love this despite the cringe parts and how high the chant/shouty part is.

**seanderlust** (7): this instrumental has a lot of things that in theory should be interesting but in practice they aren't

**Stryxen** (7): wish this song sucked more cos I hate this as a title

**NotWith10000Men** (6.9): i like the little melodic bit near the middle. btwn this and sticker i'll need to check this group out

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): MENEA PARA ABAJO MENEA PARA ABAJO MENEA PARA ABAJO MENEA PARA ABAJO MENEA PARA ABAJO

**anothertown** (6): golla ma dish 👹

**celladonn** (6): Mid sauce

**ebooks#5454** (6): ok at least this one sounds like a song

**Islands** (6): Latino solidarity

**melody** (6): catchy.

**vayyiqra** (6): Idk why you all hate this it's a jam! Okay, I get why. This is chaotic and messy. The vocals are aggressive and practically spitting at you. I think I want to be nice to this, but don't really like it much. Hot sauce is great though! One of my favourite condiments.

**welcome2thejam** (6): A perfectly good song except for one major element and it should be pretty damn clear which one that is

**Cooler\_lin** (5.5): i dont really like this song but i be singing along to it, *whispers* it hits in the car

**DaBigBoi** (5.5): I want Mark invited onto Hot Ones to eat the spiciest shit he’s ever had only to pause, smile, and say “yooo that was fire”

**poemforsmallthings** (5.5): hey I like the prechorus!

=====

2021inKPOP: **bulforster** (5.2): it's dire when this is the best NCT song in the rate

**ilyyyyy** (5): i thought dream made music different from 127, this is pretty much in line with what i expect from 127. not really into it. didn't enjoy most of the rapping either

**Kayaking11116** (5): I have a lot to say. first of all, i love the pre choruses and bridge, those parts are so good. i think the instrumentals are fun and interesting throughout the whole song. but the high pitched yelling in the chorus is… not my thing

**orbiteezus** (5): i feel like i should’ve enjoyed this song but its so uninteresting to me for some reason. like there’s stuff happening but its all passing through my ears

**BasedButta** (4.5): what the fuck? i feel like one of them might pop out of the screen and kill me

**whoisValensi** (4.5): NCT continues thru their units with whatever the fuck vibes they were on last year. I will say, this song actually solidly does have some good parts but also whatever is going on in that chorus just kills every good part and buries it at least 20 feet under the ground. Anyways I feel like the NCT units may slowly be merging into one sound for all units... and I'm not sure that that's a good thing. And I know I'm probably wrong but most of the servings in this rate for NCT are very one-note-ish and comparable in a bad way.

**apatel27** (4): Terrible Chorus

**tiltheendoftheline** (4): there are parts that I don't mind but I find it very annoying overall.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): They’re really screaming that refrain with their whole chest huh, like it’s not the most cringiest thing anyone has ever heard

**RandomHypnotica** (3.5): this song is like a carolina reaper induced hallucination

**Zypker125** (3.4): TFW I give the three NCT songs in this rate a 1 (Sticker), a 3.4 (Hot Sauce), and a 10 (Universe).

**chancehugs** (3): Feels kinda juvenile.

**frogaranaman** (3): I do not know how much more of this I can take

**moonagenightmares** (3): the fucking meme in the chorus… worst utilization of nostalgia ever

**Qwilphish** (3): This is literally Sticker in a different font, but it doesnt get nearly as much hate

**mayolizard** (2.5): did not like her like with sticker i was able to redeem bc it's funny but what is slayful here???

**jasannn** (2): GOLLA MY EARS

**MassiveThief** (2): just not of fan of these shouted hooks. they're not catchy or at all pleasant to listen to.

**maybecrf** (2): 2021 was the year of bad meme tracks apparently

**moooo566** (2): i genuinely do not understand what they're doing here. did they pull a bunch of words and noises out of a hat and have 30 minutes to make a song out of them like some kind of taskmaster challenge?

**Roxieloxie** (2): all them damn memebers and subunits and none of them can get a good song

**throwaway-7650** (3.3): Honestly MITM and ICY fight for my least favorite ITZY title track depending on the day. Good aspects of this song: the prechorus, the bridge I guess, and the chorus is kind of catchy/fun. Bad aspects: …almost everything else. The chorus gets old quickly, the (English) raps are not very good (Ryujin’s lines in particular are quite bad), and the main instrumental motif starts piercing my ears by the 2nd verse. Yeah, me enjoying ⅓ of this song sounds about right. 

 One of my co-hosts 0’d this so we knew early on that it wasn’t going to do well. It never left the bottom 10, but at least it isn’t bottom 5 in the rate? Oh well, hopefully LOCO does better!

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): This is the reason why hip-hop should be gatekept from Koreans

**1998tweety** (0): Of all the awful songs in this rate how did Mafia snatch my 0? Well firstly it’s just bad, this barely sounds like a song. Second, y’all gassed ITZY up too much. Yes I love to see k-pop groups be more experimental, but just like with NCT, you gotta know when to reel it in. ICY was a smash but besides that I don’t really think ITZY has pulled this sound off amazingly. My favourite songs from them are Wannabe and Loco which are easily their most normal songs. Anyways I am rejoicing to see this tank in the rate cause I was concerned for a bit that it would do alright.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): IF YOU GET IT, YOU GET IT. And I get it. This crept up on me, it revealed the bop to me after months of hatred. This angering italians to the point of jyp having to change the title is top 10 kpop funniest moments lmaooooo. Itzy cooka da pasta!

**bluetriangles04** (10): I'm unsure of how long it took for this song to really become enjoyable for me, but past a certain point of enough stockholming, it even became a favorite of mine... I can't explain it, but the intial disappointment from the chorus washed away from me the moment the post chorus happened, and somehow it just peacefully levelled out for me enough to make this song amazing.

**hanpop** (10): itzy more like it-slay

**jay duh** (10): youre mad @italy

**Kadenfrost** (10): unironically the best ITZY title track tbh they slayed the black outfits

**mayolizard** (10): sorry but this will always be a munch italian queens

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): not wolf, not me (Itzaaaay) gonna keep pretending they’re in their Tony Soprano era for no reason rather than referencing the game, becaus it’s funnier

**vuemaurel** (10): Don't care what others say but this song slaps!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EyzbJCNXEAUjo5F.jpg

**whoisValensi** (9.5): This song, much like the Mafia in a game of Mafia (What this song was loosely based on btw. Yeah. You read that right.), snuck up and fucking killed me. At first I hated it and guess what fuckers???? LET'S ALL STAND FOR THE NEW ITALIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM!!!!! In simpler terms: I believe in the power of Chaeryeong and you should too!

**Zypker125** (9.4): This is easily ITZY’s best song, feel free to @ me. The mafia is gonna come for all the raters that pushed this to Day 1.

**melody** (9): I regret looking up the English lyrics of this song, I was expecting a bad bitch anthem and all I got was a love song about a wimpy ass boy we don't gaf about that!

**moonagenightmares** (8.9): oppresses italians

**chenle** (8.7): the pre-chorus >>>>>

**MassiveThief** (8): the lyrics are pretty cringe but this still slaps

**MToms** (8): An iconic hair moment

**PSSST12** (8): Shes camp sorry. This is for the intellectuals only me thinks.

**runaway3212** (8): itzy flopping after this song, korea takes italian culture very seriously

**static\_int\_husp** (8): https://imgur.com/z18Ir8g

**Victerade** (8): i liked it

**pig-serpent** (6): The Bodak Yellow flow isn’t dead yet?  Are people going to be using it for the rest of time?

**ricki** (6): all of my points are because of the airpod turning off sound in the background

**Stryxen** (6): … ??

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This is just a much worse version of “How You Like That.”

**chancehugs** (5): Catchy but also kinda shallow. Ryujin's rap started the song on a high and it just goes downhill from there.

**DraculaWeekend** (5): If I was in a bad mood, this would be a 0

**milkywayinradius** (5): ariana would be upset at the italian cultural appropriation

**DirtyRat583** (4.5): itzy doing the weird and not-wonderful because blackpink refuse to 😍

2021inKPOP: **seanderlust** (4.4): this reminds me of some of the BP songs that got dragged for being half-assed attempts to channel trap music.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): itzy is not and never will be for me

**cosmicneve** (4): If ITZY wish for me to catch them if I can, they may need more than a repeated three-note riff for me to do so.

**imasalesman** (4): back when this released this would have been my 0 so it’s grown on me

**mimins** (4): that sure was something!!!!!!

**Noukzo** (4): why

**sliced-peaches** (4): awkward verses with no melody jyp youll pay for your crimes against these girls

**tiltheendoftheline** (4): they've done better

**vayyiqra** (4): The Itzy songs in this rate are very unlike the other stuff I've heard by them and idk how to feel about this. I guess it's okay? It's just very not Itzy. The "mafia" concept is weird too since I didn't get it means a Russian boardgame and not the literal mafia as in the Italian mob.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): https://i.redd.it/gx5jbz4jakl51.jpg

**2l82bstr8** (3.5): it's insane how none of their voices (okay maybe Yeji's) work for this song/vibe at all

**BasedButta** (3): minus points for getting stuck in our head even though it’s bad

**celladonn** (3): This is that really boring kind of bad girl posturing that I'm sick of in kpop

**Gonza\_90** (3): Help

**IsaiahTB0** (3): Their worst title track. Dont know why this song was approved.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): this is bad but i will forgive all musical crimes if yeji marries me

**mrach** (3): im afraid the italians won this fight

**sabooyah** (3): their worst title (i haven't listened to sneakers yet tho)

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): I don’t think the mafia would sing about being the mamamamamafia

**welcome2thejam** (3): If I ever stop doing rates, assume the ITZY Mafia put a hit out on me

**Cooler\_lin** (2.8): this is straight ass outside of the bass in the chorus and the melodic pre-chorus

**bulforster** (2.5): the MV losing all of itzy's normal obnoxious colour kind of reflects the song lacking all of their fun.

**moonshxne** (2.5): why did they make such a good video for *this*

**sarcasticsobs** (2.5): Itzy. Girls. What are we doing here? (I will cop to the loving the “hurry up, baby,  catch me, if you can, ha ha” part during the choreo). Anyways, *ring ding ding ding ding ding*

**akanewasright** (2): itzy cooka’d the pizza ~~and burnt their goodwill with listeners~~

**apatel27** (2): Between the Cardi biting and the talking off beat what even is there in this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EyzbJCNXEAUjo5F.jpg:large

**2dina3dworld** (1): 2021 must have been a long ass year because I swear this came out in 2020. Also it’s a noisy, disjointed mess but I’ve figured at least half of the negative comments are gonna say the same thing but better

**CrimsonROSET** (1): y’all did them dirty with the song choices

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (1): the italians can’t keep getting away with this

**frogaranaman** (1): I feel like this should have been focus group'd a bit

**hikkaru** (1): the naurification of itzy

**hunnybee12** (1): this mini was genuinely so bad i stopped stanning. but as i type this SNEAKERS may change this, fun itzy is the best

**nicolas** (1): you are not the mafia... you are 20 years old

**Roxieloxie** (1): i think itzy signed a deal that in exchange for wannabe being so good that they could never have a good song again

**rslashpoopheads** (1): well... I like the instrumental?

**skargardin** (1): I still can't believe how fucking awful this is

2021inKPOP: **cloudbustingmp3** (0): itzy's release quality is serving that one gif of ciara's album sales

**fadedblue09** (0): This is like one of Blackpink's bad songs but with somehow less redeeming qualities. I also randomly listened to this mini last year and I still have no idea why I did that

**Tazzachar** (0): ITZY’s only bad comeback imho

**vhqv1997** (0): every once in a while i get a painful reminder that nobody in itzy is a rapper

**1998tweety** (3): Pretty much just echoing what I already said about Hot Sauce but to a higher level. There are individual elements that work here but all together??? That pan flute needs to be obliterated. The saddest thing is how some of us really tried to pretend this song was decent on release, we listened to it over and over trying to like it. And then their released Vampire which is pop perfection. It’s our reward for enduring the lashings Sticker gave us.

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): If Squidward made a K-pop song it’d be this

**throwaway-7650** (0): The song that saved PTD from my 0. If you were on stan twitter, you remember the initial teaser with the flute, it was truly an event. I recall seeing others’ reactions to it and I was like “it can’t be *that* bad” and then I got around to listening to it. My jaw dropped. SM stans hold the company in high regard due to their songs being “experimental” but Sticker just doesn’t work for me. It’s not just the opening flute sequence, the one at the start of the 2nd verse is also ear-splitting, if not even more offensive than the recurring one. Flute aside, the piano, bridge, Taeyong, “like a sticka!”/other not good lines, etc. all contribute to an incoherent mess. Perhaps some elements might work in a different context, but this song is definitely not greater than the sum of its parts. 

 Anyway, enough about my grievances, let’s give it up to Sticker for entering the controversy leaderboard with a 3.5+ controversy score (it also *just* misses the Most 0s leaderboard but oh well)), even picking up a few 11s on the way! I can’t deny that Sticker is an entertaining experience, it’s just that instead of watching the train wreck, it feels like I am the train wreck. 

 2 NCT songs have already been eliminated, does NCT stand a chance at Day 2 with Let’s Play Ball?

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): I just can’t deny it. This is the song that I most enjoy listening to in this rate, so despite it not actually being good I have to give it the 11. That pan flute line….I want to be in the room to witness the moment they came up with that.

**akanewasright** (10): it’s the best song ever made

**anothertown** (10): the flute is so iconic that i never even knew how discordant and awful the rest of the instrumental is

**BaconShoes** (10): i thought this was gonna be horrible at first…but it kept going and the chorus came in and the beats went off and it ended up being a banger and now i’m kinda obsessed

**celladonn** (10): The girls that get it get it and the girls that don't don't

**cremeebrulee** (10): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/872172420910444585/994113338286022666/whenusendstickertothegc.png

**Islands** (10): The only bad part to me is taeyong's rap in the beginning but it's excusable now cause the flute, chorus, and bridge are too good omg and i'm just surprised this song even exists

**Kadenfrost** (10): The space cowboys are camping with the kwangya gurlies because this song is unironically catchy with that horrendous flute and the oversinging

**mayolizard** (10): sorry but i love it i stockholm syndrome myself

**melody** (10): OVERHATED, CHANGED LIVES, SAVED LIVES - Sticker you will ALWAYS be famous!

**milkywayinradius** (10): this is a beautiful mess

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the definition of if you get it you get it…like something truly shifted when this came out

**NotWith10000Men** (10): i really like the solo dudes singing the single lines over the sparse beat in the beginning part

**omgthenerve** (10): I'll always be a signature flute enthusiast

=====

2021inKPOP: **RandomHypnotica** (10): I WILL DEFEND THIS SONG WITH MY LIFE (and I am prepared to die at this reveal yes)

**ricki** (10): if i had to chose the most important historical event last year, it would have to be when the teaser featuring the flute was released

**runaway3212** (10): to all the haters... hope you get better soon

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): their shittyfluted serve, experimental lightning in a bottle etc

**Stryxen** (10): I barely even know her

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): yeah i cant really defend myself for this one can i

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): me in kindergarten when my music teacher tells me to play the flute

**vayyiqra** (10): I agree with whoever in the #rates channel said this song is the funniest shit they've ever heard. It's so chaotic and confusing how the piccolo flute and the piano are off beat and the lyrics make no sense, the guys are singing like they're going hard, the heavy bass on the "roll up to the party" interlude, the random "hoo!" and "brr!" adlibs. This is one of the most bizarre songs I've ever heard, and it's utterly hilarious. I can't listen to it without laughing my head off, it's unbelievable this is a real song that exists.

**vhqv1997** (10): if anything, this song needed more flute

**wavingwolves** (10): this just in: THERE'S NO OBJECTIVELY BAD MUSIC! it's okay to enjoy a silly as fawk song girls!

**IsaiahTB0** (9.8): This is a good song idgaf. Great vocal layering, love the way the flute sample is incorporated in the vocal arrangement. One of 127's strongest tracks.

**sage** (9.7): when the snippet for this came out.. you had to be there

**moonshxne** (9.5): lowkey metal i love this! (unlike “real” heavy metal, this doesn’t blow out my eardrums, but it bangs just as hard!!!)

**paigama** (9.1): i was a hater for months then the vocals got to me when it played randomly and the flute sound finally made sense. i kinda overplayed it though so i can't really make it a >9.5

**ilyyyyy** (9): i thought it was going to be a lot wackier based on what i've heard about it, it's pretty cohesive to me, really like it except for the 'roll up to the party' part

**moonagenightmares** (9): some people just wouldnt get it

**PSSST12** (9): pots and pans excellent I fear. The girls who get it, get it. .

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I don't know at what point my love for this went from ironic to unironic, but I think this song is actually amazing? And I have a hard time explaining why. But I think when it comes to the more annoying songs on this list it’s like… you can hear what trends, what demographics, what overused styles they’re attempting to emulate… but this? This feels like what pop music sounds like on another planet. I have no idea where they’re coming from or what they’re going for, and I can respect that.

**Cooler\_lin** (8.7): the vocal delivery in the chorus> taeil's adlib in the outro>> the only part i really still can't stand is taeyong's intro

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): and 8 of those points are just the cool factor alone. it takes balls to mix sounds like this and even more balls to make it look natural

**BasedButta** (8.5): OKAY LISTEN - this song is AWESOME it just uses crazyass instruments (funniest fucking flute ever) and has the usual “singers don’t ever shut up” kpop style. But inside, trust me… it’s awesome… even the weird bridge has some very nice metal instrumental writing. Honestly just put on youtube “sticker rock version” and see how hard it goes please i’m not insane

**hanpop** (8): i think there's something wrong with me i love this song

**hunnybee12** (8): for pure entertainment value, it makes me giggle

**jay duh** (8): dem jointz putting his entire bussy into that flute during marks solo

**mimins** (8): I enjoy this a normal amount but you will never catch me defending it on the internet

**orbiteezus** (8): alright, so i understand that this will most likely tank, but honestly, this is probably one of the most interesting k-pop songs ever and while i don’t necessarily enjoy it because of that, it definitely helps in understanding why i like it. although even if i thought this was trash i would think the same. on first listen when taeyong started doing whatever he was doing i was honestly perplexed, and the rest of the song felt like a shitpost. like NCT is known for kinda ‘noisy’ music but even then, those sounded much more coherent. like the distorted flute, the sorta off-sounding pianos, the weird LQ vocals, its so bizarre but im in awe at the fact that it exists. it feels like they did so much stuff to subvert usual k-pop song styles which may not have paid off to a lot of listeners but like, i get it

=====

2021inKPOP: **pleasegivemeasword** (8): there's no way this makes it to day two but i still somehow find myself defending it...

**Qwilphish** (8): society if people didnt hate this song for the whistle:

**vuemaurel** (7.5): I love the flute!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): like it or not but they had the girls talking… sticker will always be timeless <3

**hikkaru** (7): 2021 was the first full year that i spent following kpop and i don't think there was a more memorable moment than the sticker chronicles. from the moment the snippet dropped to the full song release it just got worse and worse. thank you nct for being so horrible and releasing this ...... masterpiece. i went back and looked at the reactions on discord when this dropped and it truly was such a moment

**ignitethephoenix** (7): who allowed this flute onto the song 😭 it’s so bad. If you cut it out it would be infinitely better

**tiltheendoftheline** (7): I love some parts of it, tolerate others, but it is an unusual song, to say the least. The vocals, choreography and overall performance make up for what I dislike.

**xxipil0ts** (6.8): - i didn't get the joke abt them sampling the arabic nokia ringtone until now but it was great

**chenle** (6.2): still can't believe they had taeil belt out the most insane vocals on top of the worst beat of all time.mp3

**bigbigbee** (6): I truly think that in k-pop, it’s a bigger sin to be boring than to be annoying or weird. IDK. Not to get on a soapbox but there have been SO many k-pop songs that annoyed me at first and that I grew to genuinely love as they replayed in my head. Some people will say that if you “have to Stockholm Syndrome a song, it can’t be THAT good!”, but…I genuinely really came to like these songs. I think that sometimes, first impressions are not reflective of how you’ll feel in a week or two. But some k-pop fans take pride in immediately deciding something is bad, and making it the Twitter punching bag of the week, and then obviously feel like they can’t go back against their own word. IDK why I’m decided to write an essay for a song that I don’t even like THAT much, but I think that O.O, this song, Fantastic Baby, EXO Wolf, SNSD I Got A Boy back in 2013 (!)

**HoshiLock** (6): It was weird when I listened it the first time but after some reproductions I liked it

**kyrgyzzephyr** (6): this is so unhinged, i'm not fully on board but i respect it. tho i'll be damned if i don't sing along to 'like a stickaaaah'

**poemforsmallthings** (6): Taeil Houston and Doyoung Carey kinda slayed here

**welcome2thejam** (6): I have not been able to stop thinking about Sticker since I first heard it. One of the most bizarre productions my ears have ever heard. Sticker is a monument to man's hubris, it should not exist in a just world, and now we must learn to live alongside our follies as punishment for our crimes

**cherryices** (5.5): quite angry that this has grown on me. fuming

**coolfluffle** (5): i hate that recorder so much

**DefaultPophead** (5): "the signature fan flute sound will awaken your mind" yeah nah, keep melodrama outta your mouth.

**DraculaWeekend** (5): The video of them hearing this for the first time lives rent free in my head

**jasannn** (5): there’s a good song here… somewhere

**sarcasticsobs** (5): Not *my* kind of weird. Was not into this except for that “roll up” bit from 3:07 to 3:20. I like Taeyong better when he goes real low voice. Some of them can really sing, though

**whoisValensi** (5): This is the hardest song in this rate to rate for me. Yes, even harder than "MONEY"... Because this is genuinely maybe the worst song I have ever heard. But at the same time it's so... catchy??????????? Like that flute is the dumbest shit I've ever heard but sometimes my brain just goes "LIKE A STICKER! STICKER! STICKER!" Like, yeah this is the worst Dem Jointz production I can think of but at the same time it has ideas and I see what they were trying to go for in the final product... I think. But at the same time it just doesn't fucking work. EXCEPT THAT BRIDGE THAT WORKS. Now on the flip-side this song has become a total fucking meme between me and one of my besties so we fucking laughed our way thru every year-end K-Pop show we watched last year because we could count on this being performed and we would fucking crack up the second the flute fucking hit. So like... IS THIS SONG THE ULTIMATE SONG TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER???????? What I'm saying is I have a lot of complex feelings on this song but that flute alone is a 5, so maybe this is a 5.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): what the fuck am i listening to

**chancehugs** (4): Sometimes NCT's weird sounds work. Here it doesn't.

**Esh\_Kebab** (4): People go on and on about the flute on this track, but the worst part will always be "like a stickaaAAH".

**rotating3Dtext** (4): they always up the ante in avant-garde meme songs

**LesApfels** (3.5): Lemonade would have been a better title track in every conceivable way. The shitty recorder sample should be put to death.

**sabooyah** (3): i really wouldn't dislike this that much but the flute is so, so shrill

**Kayaking11116** (1): SOBBUNG ITS A NAUR FROM ME HUNNY. this is it your honor, the terrible awful Satan spawn

**LilacDaffodils** (1): Clearly SM was trying to save money by hiring first graders learning the recorder.

**pig-serpent** (1): NO!  I refuse to believe that this isn’t parody.  There’s no way anyone listened to the whistle on this song and went “yeah, this sounds good.”

**plastichaxan** (1): oh it was bad for them and everyone who heard

**Roxieloxie** (1): that tweet thats like 'if i was an artist i would release the worst song ever made and watch my fanbase fight over it' except you all are really dying on the field of battle for this 3rd grade hot cross buns ass recorder player. Id pay money for another 0 to see this suffer more but alas,,

**thedoctordances1940** (1): the flute sounds worse than the first thing i ever did on ableton

**Zypker125** (1): Someone said the flute reminded them of the [infamous My Heart Will Go On recorder cover](https://youtu.be/X2WH8mHJnhM?t=19) and I can’t unhear it ~~Even without the flute, this song would have been a 1 from Taeyong’s nasally rap~~

**bluetriangles04** (0): After much debating, I realized that giving any other song in this rate a 0 would purely just be lying to myself.

Even at the inoffensive SM bridge, that horrible fucking flute is still on full blast and that dance break or whatever is... The mixing on this song too???

**1998tweety** (6): MEH. This sounds like a bootleg version of their other songs. God’s Menu into Back Door was immaculate, but I guess the streak had to end somewhere.

**throwaway-7650** (4): (my comments from here onward are more low-effort, hopefully I’ll have time to add more later this weekend) Not very fond of the rapping, although I’m actually fine with the spitting. I’m also a bit aussiephobic for some of the English lines, sorry Christopher. And yeah, the prechorus is easily the highlight of the song for me, the one aspect of God’s Menu that they were able to recreate semi-successfully. At least stays get to celebrate the return of Hyunjin and that Thunderous managed to pick up an 11 (still can’t believe this got an 11 tbh)?

**OliviaGodrigo** (2): Why are they shouting at me

---

**chenle** (10): rrrrrrrang kwang kwang kwang kwang

**DraculaWeekend** (10): How do they consistently knock it out of the park

**hanpop** (10): tectonic plates shift every time this song is played

**HoshiLock** (10): Not only this song but all the album is a masterpiece

**PSSST12** (10): An apologist for stray kids' brand of noise I fear. Also lee know is so fucking handsome in this one so anything below a 10 is criminal

**whoisValensi** (10): Goddamnit Stray Kids... Congrats you GREW ON ME! HARD! Not all noisy BG music is bad I'm just dumb and- Jesus christ I'm just getting into every JYP group now huh???? This is me saying my first K-Pop purchase of the year (thus far) was a copy of 'ODDINARY'. Anyways, can we get the traditional mix of this song on streaming websites please. (If that already exists please do let me know lolll)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): My score just kept going up and up for this one. I love how they’re just really going for it.

**bigbigbee** (9): me after liking every SKZ song that I’ve heard, even this one: googles “signs of being a Stay” “Am I a Stay quiz?” “Stay, or just like good music?”

**hunnybee12** (9): so many things i can thank stray kids for.... i would never say this to anyone irl but the hyunjin bullying scandal was the catalyst for me getting out of a awful & lonely time of my life. to distract myself from my problems i spent all my time consuming kpop shit, mostly skz. i was so invested in these kpop boys i literally felt PHYSICALLY ILL about hyunjins scandal and the possibility of him being kicked. i had a moment when i realized how fucking embarassing and pathetic that is. living through the ups and downs of others bc i was too much of a anxious to live my own life. so i started to try to put myself out there more. a year later i graduated college, have a boyfriend and a pretty good adult job. not to say none of it wouldve happened without skz but it was a wake up call i needed to start working on myself. so yeah thanks hyunjin for being a fucking twat in middle school i still love u idc

**Kadenfrost** (9): Bang Chan ATEEEEEEEE

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): The guy who did the captions had so much fun omg

**welcome2thejam** (9): Are you sure this is a 2021 KPop song and not off the soundtrack to the first few Fast & the Furious movies?

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): not their best but I love how committed their are to the hardstyle thing it really works for them

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): Felix's first "sorry" made me take my headphones out to double check no one was trying to talk to me #justaussietingz

**jay duh** (8): its changbin vs the beat and he's getting his ass whooped

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): maximalist bop

**skargardin** (8): This is very much God's Meny 0.5 but still a bop

**Zypker125** (7.8): Someone on another K-Pop subreddit complained that Bang Chan was bad at English wordplay and used the name of this album (No EASY) as their example, saying “No EASY being a pun for Noisy is such obvious and bad wordplay”. Ever since, I couldn’t stop thinking about how cool and clever that wordplay was and how I hadn’t realized that wordplay until that Redditor pointed it out.

2021inKPOP: **celladonn** (7.5): I love Stray Kids but this sounds like a bit of a retread. They can do better!

**moonagenightmares** (7.5): its kinda camp…

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): I KNOW this is stupid but I can’t hate it

**Victerade** (7.5): if it werent for i.ns absolutely amazing voice would never stream this song

**apatel27** (7): So serious it's funny

**mayolizard** (7): the song that started SKZ flop era - from a former stay

**raggedy-princess** (7): villains make my blood boil >:(

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): i really liked a lot of stray kids up to 2020 but their more recent stuff just hasn't clicked for me

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): i hate how i can’t look at felix now without thinking of that tiktok where he swings his hips a lil too much…

**NotWith10000Men** (6.4): it's not very good but i kinda like it. it goes hard

**aestheticen** (6): Very conflicted on what I think of this song... but I will say that the dance and the music video are really good

**BasedButta** (6): awful drop!!!! rest is saved by the cool percussion sounds and that hype as fuck little folklore dude that appears in the last chorus. BY THE WAY, LAST CHORUS: It slaps. hard. Imagine if the whole song was like that.

**jasannn** (6): feels like straykids through an instagram filter

**Qwilphish** (6): I don't care for the verses at all, but the chorus is pretty undeniable

**sarcasticsobs** (6): A group I know is huge but had never heard a thing from. Was liking it until the chorus. Though if you’re looking for energy, there it is

**vhqv1997** (6): i like god's menu and back door and the chorus on this one goes crazy but man they just get more cringe every comeback

**wavingwolves** (6): for a song called thunderous this surely isn't half as loud as it should be

**DaBigBoi** (5): I’d like to slap my cheeks across Chan’s face (derogatory)

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): i’m a stan but i can’t even defend this one…

**Kayaking11116** (5): it kills me inside how this mv is so good and the song is so meh

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Oh god damn fucking shit they’re Blackpinking (Blackpink, v, to follow up an incredibly successful single with a single that essentially recreates and mimics the sounds, structures, and melodies of the previous single, usually to diminishing returns of quality)

**poemforsmallthings** (4.6): God's Menu is a 9

**chancehugs** (4): Like the flow of their rappers, but song's kinda grating and boring.

**CrimsonROSET** (4): you should be sorry

**DirtyRat583** (4): this is so 😈😈😈 (derogatory)

**flavasavavandal** (4): begging the kpop industry to drop the flute/flute-like synths

**frogaranaman** (4): giving Trap Nation

**ilyyyyy** (4): don't like most of the many sounds in this

**IsaiahTB0** (4): Dont get the hype for them

**pig-serpent** (4): I feel like I should hate this and I don’t, so that’s worth something.  Not a lot, but something.

**tiltheendoftheline** (4): the pre chorus and chorus are so similar to God's Menu to me... And I wasn't a fan of that either.

2021inKPOP: **runaway3212** (3.5): the first 2 minutes slay but the rest just feels so boring

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): stray kids are super hit or miss for me and this one's a pretty big miss

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): well bonus points for being creative i guess

**Cooler\_lin** (3): i keep forgetting how this one sounds like and everytime i re-listen I am grateful i forget

**maybecrf** (3): doing too much

**mimins** (3): that first verse was horrendous. the prechorus saved it

**RandomHypnotica** (3): im not really sure what they were going for…. but it didn't work

**sabooyah** (3): not for me lol

**seanderlust** (3): i get they're going for a flex on the haters anthem but it falls flat for me

**fadedblue09** (2): Justice for Mixtape:OH aka literally their best output last year. Also wanted to say that Lee Know occupies my mind rent free often

**orbiteezus** (2): man that drop really sucks

**ricki** (2): one day ill be able to say something nice about stray kids that isnt about the look of its members. that day is not today. bang chan is so hot i want him to grab me and-

**vayyiqra** (2): This is one of the weird/polarizing songs in this rate where I'm on the side of "yeah this is bad in fact". The mixing is awful, the vocals aren't good, it's going for loud and noisy but that's about all there is to it. It's thunderous, in the sense that thunder will scare your pets and make them run and hide under a bed. I guess the "sonic boom" part has material for a shitpost about Street Fighter. Otherwise there are not many redeeming things about this song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.5): i didn’t enjoy a single minute of this

**akanewasright** (1): proof that being hot and having good music videos doesn’t mean you’re good

**BaconShoes** (1): this is so…

**bespectacIed** (1): i couldn't have cared less about kingdom but even I was side eyeing in behalf of deobis. imagine losing to this white noise, id be mad too.

**hikkaru** (1): it's just so unpleasant

**MassiveThief** (1): the rapping is atrocious, and as soon as I started liking the song the chorus hit. ouch.

**rslashpoopheads** (1): noisy is right

**imasalesman** (0): they really decided to make the same songs again and again

**plastichaxan** (0): bye i didn’t expect a song that wasn’t sticker/money to get my 0 but here we are

**Stryxen** (0): can u stop spitting on me

**1998tweety** (7): This score is probably a few points too high but it’s a cute inoffensive bop.

**throwaway-7650** (4.4): The chorus is so cunty and for what? A rap that’s almost as bad as AIIYL’s?

**OliviaGodrigo** (2): My god.. it sounds like a nursery rhyme them BAM! the beat turns cunt for 10 seconds. The song is only good for those 10 seconds. That rap is god awful.

---

**Kadenfrost** (10): [https://twitter.com/feverwonu/status/1523697139536203776]

**runaway3212** (10): literally the best outro in this rate teddy slayed boots

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): gagging

**SFbby** (9): The song's kinda a mess (especially the rap) but damn that rumbling bass in the chorus and the bridge are insane

**vayyiqra** (9): I want to say this is mediocre, and the mini it's on is definitely mid, but this song has a way of getting stuck in my head so it's grown on me. (The "Thrill Ride" effect, if you will.)

**bluetriangles04** (8.5): After giving myself half a year to get over the drop which I thought was painfully underwhelming, it really grew on me looking at it from another angle. I feel like nowadays, TEDDY productions and self-stockholming for me are synonymous.

**Esh\_Kebab** (8.5): Once you get over the TikTokness of it, this song goes pretty hard.

**mimins** (8.5): when I first listened to this song a while back I didn't like it but I unexpectedly liked it a lot second listen

**paigama** (8.5): could have been a 9 if it were still 2021. a bop that kinda aged

**akanewasright** (8): This song is dumb as balls and I kinda love it

**Cooler\_lin** (8): stupid catchy

**MToms** (8): One of my favorite examples of the Teddy formula.

**Qwilphish** (8): The rapping she does in this song is lowkey the best part

**vuemaurel** (8): The best from Somi's discography

**welcome2thejam** (8): Primed to give this a bad score at first, but hot damn this had some twists. Not enough to fully overcome the bad bits but makes it worth sticking around

=====

2021inKPOP: **celladonn** (7.5): The chorus is actually a serve, I wish the rest of the song was that good

**chenle** (7.5): wasted a good chorus & decent pre-chorus on the most forgettable verses i've heard in my life

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Nor as good as Dun Dun

**maybecrf** (7.5): this song is a little angsty for me, but it has some 10/10 elements

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): cute, i like the whistle

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): why does Somi look whiter every comeback

**cremeebrulee** (7.2): if reworked a bit, this would’ve killed in a bollywood movie tbh

**agentofscranton** (7): the last 30 seconds are a 10

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Football Team

**coolfluffle** (7): her best tt imo but still a little bit boring. teddy needs to branch out a little

**hikkaru** (7): why's the chorus so slay but then the rest just sounds so... dinky

**mayolizard** (7): cute but i preferred her other song from this era i forget what it's called help

**melody** (7): the beat drops serves YouTube 2016 ad free music in those kpop news accounts from like 2018.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This song is a bit… well you already know what I’m gonna say

**Victerade** (7): mid

**ebooks#5454** (6.9): chorus is catchy and that's about it; m/v male lead would make me dumb dumb too ngl

**jasannn** (6.5): no think no think

**sarcasticsobs** (6.5): I feel like this one is gonna be divisive (?), and part of me is like “I shouldn’t like this at all” but I really like the second part of the chorus, that just gets to me, and those last like 30-45 seconds, there should be *more* of that. Hate the rap!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.1): this looks and sounds like something zara larsson would release

**BaconShoes** (6): the bass is giving, but other than that it’s not amazing

**bespectacIed** (6): i wasn't mad at it, kinda slaps. She definitely studied at the Olivia Rodrigo school of wasian pride

**bookthieving** (6): somi's so charming she can even sell teddy's bullshit to me wow

**CrimsonROSET** (6): the beat for this is so good but it also completely overwhelms the vocals

**sabooyah** (6): could have been a blackpink b-side, i can hear rose going crazy on those verses

**skargardin** (6): eh

**bulforster** (5.8): the verses are nothing and the chorus doesn't really get good until the outro

**2l82bstr8** (5.5): I swear everytime I see her again she looks more like Gwen Stefani

**LesApfels** (5.5): Stream Birthday

**thedoctordances1940** (5.3): me to nicolas

**aestheticen** (5): The rap part deserves life imprisonment

**MassiveThief** (5): I love and hate this simultaneously. I'm not giving it a 5 as much as I am a 10 and a 0.

**PSSST12** (5): somi should have waited and stayed in itzy because she had only released genericness through out her entire career. Though this might not be as obnoxious as birthday, its still annoying to me atleast. Sorry girl. 😬

**tiltheendoftheline** (5): I like the chorus but to me it doesn't really mesh well with the verses

**yatcho** (5): this just feels like American spotifycore

=====

2021inKPOP: **Zypker125** (4.8): I was the one fan that really enjoyed Birthday and WWYF, and then this song gets released and I don’t like it, so ofc that means THIS song goes viral over all of Somi’s other releases.

**moonshxne** (4.5): sonically matches the video’s fake high school movie setting i guess

**pig-serpent** (4.5): I almost like this a lot but that drop is awful and completely ruins what the rest of the song has going for it.  It tries to redeem itself with the final chorus but I just wish it had come sooner.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): you'll never be red velvet i fear

**Kayaking11116** (4): the instrumentals in the chorus are not it in my opinion and kind of ruined the song for me

**orbiteezus** (4): feel like this song was scientifically engineered for me to dislike but honestly the whistle melody in the chorus is really catchy. but like, what was that rap verse

**ricki** (4): somi keeping the wasian community in south korea employed and relevant. thank u for your service

**MoonlightByWindow** (3.5): is it just me or is this literally something olivia rodrigo would release

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3.4): teddy needs to be chased out of the kpop industry actually… like Middle Age, angry-mob-with-pitchfork style. somi we’ll get you out of the dungeon promise.

**2dina3dworld** (3): don’t ask me to explain but this has the same energy as Gayle’s discography

**anothertown** (3): red velvet outpeaked

**ilyyyyy** (3): the instrumental is not it for me, it features all the sounds i tend to dislike. somehow the chorus comes together better than i expected but it's not enough. don't love her voice, the rapping was bad too

**SkylarV** (3): I feel dumber for having to listen to this song again for the rate

**sliced-peaches** (3): yes this song song went number one on my phone but in no way shape or form is it good

**vhqv1997** (3): not sure we can even classify this as a song, not like in a revolutionary, music-redefining way, but like in a "why did this rough draft get shipped before they finished recording it?" kind of way

**apatel27** (2): Where is this chorus beat from

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (2): what an agonizingly bland song

**BasedButta** (2): this song makes me irrationaly angry i might give it a 0 just for that

**chancehugs** (2): That beat drop was it. Everything else wasn't. Wish she'd continued What You Waiting For's sound.

**flavasavavandal** (2): surprisingly not the worst drop in the rate

**IsaiahTB0** (2): The verses on this song are genuinely awful and dont make up for the medicorce chorus.

**DaBigBoi** (1.5): Truly in her YG bag

**frogaranaman** (1): stop naming songs after me

**jay duh** (1): no.

**RandomHypnotica** (1): its giving korean iggy azalea

**wavingwolves** (1): i seriously can't think of a single positive thing to say about this

**whoisValensi** (1): Holy shit this song is way worse than I remember it being. Sis is literally like a year older than me (a year, a month, and some days to be exact lol) and is pumping out DCOM songs, take that as you will. I hate to say it but "Birthday", despite not being good, is probably still my favorite Somi solo release... Yeah...

**Dusk** (9): he served sex. Also please stream KARD’s new song Ring The Alarm, it’s a bop and will be winning the 2022 k-pop rate!!

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): Wow he can’t sing but the song is good!

**MK** (5): I was ready to use my 0 on him but this isn’t bad actually. sorry to my co-hostie though

---

**BebeLuigi** (11): I'm still SO MAD this wasn't the title track or didn't get a MV....

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): kind of a bop actually

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.4): I moved!

**DefaultPophead** (8): yes, honey 😩

**vayyiqra** (8): Never heard of this guy but this is good. I'm not the biggest fan of K-hiphop but it's an alright genre and besides this is more of a dance/club song. I like the bass on this a lot.

**sage** (7.8): i just know this washes kards entire discography

**chenle** (7.7): wait this kinda slaps

**thedoctordances1940** (7.1): got some cool production going on

**exciting\_patient4872** (7): There are four numbers in my username, and I assigned one to each song in the bonus rate. It's law.

**HoshiLock** (7): I liked it I added it to my playlist

**mrach** (7): cant say house is the first genre i expected out of a bm solo

**Zypker125** (5.4): This will be the only time I can yell BIG TIDDIES GANG and not get cancelled by Reddit

**chancehugs** (5): I feel like I get glimpses of BM's talent from this song (and in fact he elevates it), but the song is not a good enough showcase of just what he's capable of.

**DirtyRat583** (5): as far as kpop goes, this is

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this sounds like a song my brother would listen to and that's not a compliment

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): This video is giving me dark energy… He reminds me of MGK/Blackbear/insert mediocre white pseudo-rapper here and it makes me very uncomfortable

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): body standing still

**flavasavavandal** (0): this blows

**metanoira** (0): love how it says "performance film"...but it's just the camera zooming in and zooming out of him standing in place. very liam-payne-core

**seanderlust** (0): this is actually okay but i was given a 0 and there are no stakes in this one so by god i'm going to use it. sorry BM, by default, you're the 0

**1998tweety** (5): Again, echoing what I already said in my Lalisa comment. This isn’t *awful* it’s just sooo mediocre and not at all what we should be expecting from a huge group like BP. I do prefer Gone though, shes a cute 6.5.

**throwaway-7650** (4.5): The last BP solo has finally fallen, Rosé barely failing to escape the bottom 10 of the rate by ending up at #57. I do kind of wish we could go back to the timeline where this was #63 though. Damn, tri-

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): I don’t consider this to be Kpop tbh. It sounds like the corniest, most generic music you’d find on the radio. It’s Rose recording a Jon Bellion song and sounds very much exactly like that.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): Roseanne is my bias, the blackpink main eater, so I am probably overscoring this. I inexplicably love this looool. Generic ballad EDM, the mv is a glorified Saint Laurent editorial campaign, but this somehow dug its way into my brain We receive the bops we think we deserve

**bluetriangles04** (10): Rosé's solo for me was easily the best, I found both songs on the single enjoyable and although the lyrics on On The Ground can get really cheesy (used to have a hole with a mattress etc...) I still love this song and how you can really hear the emotions in her voice especially in the bridge. Also the break down like CMON!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): everyone gets their ‘this song is awful i love it’ take for this rate and this is mine

**jay duh** (10): mother ate

**metanoira** (10): best blackpink solo yeah

**NotWith10000Men** (10): i love the melodies throughout the whole thing

**TiltControls** (10): This is catchier than it really should be

**treecoh** (10): we love jon bellion

**ebooks#5454** (9.5): this is a Halsey song right ?

**melody** (9): I enjoyed this more than I thought I would.

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): i can't believe i've never listened to this in full before now

**anothertown** (8.5): the chorus is such a 2010 electropop slay

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I was led to believe this was bad by the discord but it’s definitely not. Blackpink antis calm down.

**maybecrf** (8): a little corny, but the song is still good ¯_(ツ)_/¯

**mimins** (8): great song to listen to when you're really going thru it

**twiceoftheheart** (8): It's probably nice to be rich, though

=====

2021inKPOP: **moonagenightmares** (7.7): some of the lyrics are funny but i liked this more than i expected

**BaconShoes** (7.5): gently slays

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): it’s so weird doing this rate and enjoying all the BP songs when I hated every song from them in smackdown

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): her voice is so good and this is the best they give her? I guess it could be worse but this is so meh

**Qwilphish** (7.5): This song got a lot of hate when it was first released but I thought that it was quite sweet and of course she sounds great. I don't think its groundbreaking but it shows who she is for sure

**sabooyah** (7.5): love a hearty sprinkle of indie in my pop

**Cooler\_lin** (7.3): this song is all right but she will never be 'GONE'

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): me too babe thats why my mattress is on the floor

**celladonn** (7): This can mildly hit if I'm in the right mood for it

**ilyyyyy** (7): i was more into it when it first came out, not loving it that much rn

**ImADudeDuh** (7): #1 hit on the popheads charts

**mayolizard** (7): i forgor about her

**MToms** (7): Disappointing debut, YG could have done more with her voice.

**pig-serpent** (7): I…am very conflicted with this one.  It’s kinda camp but also it feels unfinished?  The verses are good but this is all we get as a drop?

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): when someone asks where the bar is to make a better song than Lisa:

**thedoctordances1940** (6.7): yeah ok i kinda like this i am sorry

**Zypker125** (6.7): This will go out early Day 1 (probably Bottom 5) when it’s better than most of the songs in this rate.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): the drop is so nothing it's almost impressive

**2l82bstr8** (6.5): I feel like she's singing a different song in her head than the one I'm hearing

**DefaultPophead** (6.5): This sounds like a song the bullied girl who won the Final Jam in the first Camp Rock movie would sing.

**Tazzachar** (6.5): this chorus is not good, but I love ROSÉ’s voice and the other parts of the song

**IsaiahTB0** (6): Honestly I overhated this song. The chorus is a black hole of personality but I kinda like the song.

**jasannn** (6): like my standards

**Kadenfrost** (6): It started like a Taylor Swift song at first then it devolved into a 2016 Bebe Rexha song with a dated beat drop

**rotating3Dtext** (6): the non-chorus kills me

**seanderlust** (6): while i can't say i necessarily enjoy the production here, something about it does feel unique to the rest of this lineup

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): this song is like a 1 but damn if I'm not levitating when that final chorus hits

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Love how Rosé made a song about how fame and fortune is overrated, meanwhile her bandmate is over here like “AYYY TWERKIN’ WITH MY MONAYYYY”

**Victerade** (6): the score is on the ground

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): why is every song by blackpink and their members so disappointing

**chancehugs** (5): That she sounds bored on her own song is not a good sign at all. Where are the vocals?

**coolfluffle** (5): quite boring

**cosmicneve** (5): At least it's better than Lalisa

**hikkaru** (5): to quote rosé herself, "naur"

**Kayaking11116** (5): I’m personally just not super into slower songs and the instrumentals arent my favorite. Shes still a queen though and shes also gorgeous

**runaway3212** (5): fine i guess i stan the final chorus

=====

2021inKPOP: **aestheticen** (4): I'm not sure if it is intentional that the beat drop is supposed to sound like it is rolling On the Ground or anything but either way that was the most creative direction ever

**akanewasright** (4): The way Rosé has such a cool voice and got such boring songs

**apatel27** (4): How to ruin a decent song with an edm drop

**BasedButta** (4): juuuuuust a little bit of decent sprinkled on… something… that’s… not decent?

**cherryices** (4): like this cannot be a 2021 release……

**plastichaxan** (4): she thot she ate :sob:

**sliced-peaches** (4): avocadies and bannannies

**ricki** (3.8): the most jon bellion song to have ever jon bellioned

**DaBigBoi** (3.5): Everything she needed to make a great song was on the ground and yet

**LesApfels** (3.5): Should've stayed in Teddy's hard drive

**orbiteezus** (3.5): for me most drops in a song despite liking or disliking, i can generally get like, the intention of what the artist or musicians want to add or convey with it but like, this feels like the most useless drop ever you could just keep the guitars there and it’d be fine the drop sounds like shit

**sarcasticsobs** (3.3): YG, you *idiots*, Rosé does not deserve a *drop chorus*. Pre-chorus is real nice. But Rosé if you read this, I am so sorry for the score but I’m still free on Thursday night and would like to hang out. Please respond to this and then hang out with me on Thursday night when I’m free

**bigbigbee** (3): I thought I could avoid YG’s annoying Blaccent phenomenon in this song of all songs, but then she started saying “nahhh, they don’t need me tho” like that

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): the title aptly describes the chorus: flat on the ground!

**moonshxne** (3): i personally abhor this brand of affected cursive/“indie girl” singing, especially for an entire fucking song (...i’m so sorry if that’s her natural voice but i don’t believe it)

**rslashpoopheads** (3): EVERYTHING I NEED IS ON THE GROWWNNDNDDDNDNDWNWDN

**vayyiqra** (3): The intro and verses are very boring and grocery-store-core but the synth in the post-chorus is good ... I think? I want to like this but the time has come to admit I don't. :hanawinsCri: The cover art is so pretty it's a waste because this mini was not good.

**whoisValensi** (3): Ready for Rosé's Post-BP career when she becomes the next go-to vocalist for basic EDM songs!

**alwayswords** (2.5): worst drop ever but cute verses

**bulforster** (2.5): Musically this reminds me of blank space but worse, which is already a bad song

**Stryxen** (2): yawn the ground

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): do you think the blackpink girls actively hate the songs they’re forced to sing. like if i was a kpop idol and my company told me this is what my debut solo single would be i think i’d straight up just quit

**2dina3dworld** (1): okay pop off Jojo

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): zzzzz

**frogaranaman** (1): sorry to the Blackpink girlies but there was a really poor showing this year lol

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): when is teddy getting charged with musical terrorism fr

**PSSST12** (1): Jennie's solo wil remain the best solo release from them I fear. And even that wasnt even good.

**skargardin** (1): god this snooze

**vhqv1997** (1): i shouldn't be surprised that blackpink's solos would use the same production genre of mechanical farting sounds that their group songs are famous for

**wavingwolves** (1): "i used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress" oh so are we telling lies now? okay my turn!

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): Definitely sounds like it’s for children, like I could see kids obsessing with this like it’s the next Baby Shark, but I still bop my head

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): I think the messiness of this song works because it’s unironically just cheesy and that’s all it needs!!

**apatel27** (10): Chaotic Good

**bespectacIed** (10): saur damn cute and fun and inescapable. This group is really easy to like and stan from afar.... important sidenote juyeon is so hot

**moonagenightmares** (10): i loved the sound of this in the teasers, then when it got released i had a mini breakdown because it didnt sound like i thought it would. then when i recovered i listened again and its camp tbh. some people just wouldnt get it </3

**ricki** (10): this sounds the same way purple energy drinks tastes

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): i'll take weird tbz over any of their recent releases.

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): this one is smooooooth (and they're all so pretty!)

**bigbigbee** (8.5): IDC, I just like men being annoying. I loved Block B

**Qwilphish** (8.5): That carnival sound that is throughout the whole song is stupid catchy lmao, it doesn't give you any time to breathe. The bridge is a nice switch of pace that really rounds the whole song out

**Victerade** (8.5): v fun

**akanewasright** (8): stupid sexy Boyz..

**coolfluffle** (8): love the dance for this one lol

**jay duh** (8): love changmin

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): we need more boy groups in a silly goofy mood

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): the car alarm is giving

**vayyiqra** (8): As MK said this song was designed to be the most annoying song ever, and yet it's really catchy. The "Sticker" formula, if you will. Sometimes I just wake up and that little melody plays in my head and I hear "yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa".

**MassiveThief** (7.5): this has all the makings of other songs I despise, but it kinda comes full circle and I dig it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): The boy groups in this rate are really just consistently serving bizarre bops. I’m not mad about it.

**bluetriangles04** (7): clown music for clowns like myself

**cosmicneve** (7): The world is too harsh on silly men

**CrimsonROSET** (7): why do they pronounce thrillin like that

=====

2021inKPOP: **IsaiahTB0** (7): Honestly not that bad. Kinda hated it on first listen but its grown.

**LilacDaffodils** (7): this is like a 2016 type of bg song and I really like it

**pig-serpent** (7): This song works for me despite the fact that I hate everything about it.

**plastichaxan** (7): that wasn’t too thrilling but i’ll forgive them

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): At first I listened to the song and I was like 🤨 but then I watched the video and I was like 🥵

**agentofscranton** (6.5): i know what you are

**LesApfels** (6.5): It's like a children's birthday party (in a good way!)

**whoisValensi** (6.5): That lil do do do dododo is gonna be stuck in my head for the next week. Wish the rest hit like that for me. Also I want everyone who didn't take the visual route with this rate to know that they dabbed at the end of the video. In 2021. Unironically.

**DaBigBoi** (6): Not the bright concept we were asking for, but she tried

**PSSST12** (6): Now if The stealer was here it would have made top ten easily. They got set up with this nct dream lite song choice 😭

**Roxieloxie** (6): the longer this goes on the more i lower my score, that being said i think this is what sticker was supposed to sound like

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): has a dumb 90s fun, Smash Mouth-adjacent vibe to it (not totally derogatory)

**skargardin** (6): the hook drags it down a little I fear

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): mk played this for me at a listening party once and he told me he expected this to be a 0 magnet which was surprising to me because this is just a normal song?? there are so many more offensive songs in the rate than this i can’t imagine how anyone could think this is the single worst song in this rate

**vhqv1997** (6): a really nothing song

**Zypker125** (5.8): In a year where TBZ released 3 absolute bops with Breaking Dawn, Kingdom Come, and Maverick, of course K-Pop fans choose by far the worst single by TBZ that year to make the most popular. Tis a shame, because TBZ was genuinely my MVP artist of 2021.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): i feel extremely indifferent towards this song

**BaconShoes** (5): it was a lot but also not giving much at the same time

**celladonn** (5): That repetitive melody is pretty annoying

**sabooyah** (5): forgettable

**aestheticen** (4.5): At least they are hot I guess...

**Gonza\_90** (4.5): Not really feeling this

**bulforster** (4.3): this is so annoying (neutral statement)

**moonshxne** (4.1): weird that exactly 50% of this song is quite melodic and inspired and the other 50% really, really sucks

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): the video is gorgeous when muted

**sarcasticsobs** (4): No, thank you!

**welcome2thejam** (4): Exudes Jason Derulo & pre-retro bops Bruno Mars type of energy

**Cooler\_lin** (3.7): this one is really really really forgettable and boring im so sorry

=====

2021inKPOP: **ilyyyyy** (3): the melody in the ddu du's and in the instrumental annoys me. and the rapping i don't love either.

**jasannn** (3): clown car noises intensifies

**maybecrf** (3): im a boy group hater

**mimins** (3): the bridge saved this from a 0

**NotWith10000Men** (3): I like the music in the background but i wish the singing was more melodic

**orbiteezus** (3): this song is enjoyable, like, ironically. by itself it sounds like bad circus music

**rslashpoopheads** (3): TBZ have never made a good cutesy song since Giddy Up

**thedoctordances1940** (2.3): this reminds me off chemistry by arcade fire and there's a reason that's one of the lowest rated songs on indieheads

**chancehugs** (2): Making the whole chorus in the same note was a mistake. It sounds so monotone.

**hikkaru** (2): i want to get off

**Kayaking11116** (2): it would’ve been higher but they dabbed at the very end so it was demoted, sorry not sorry i dont make the rules

**metanoira** (2): theyre so hot i wanna stan so bad but the music...no air remains their best

**RandomHypnotica** (2): people would put this song on tiktok with a caption like "if you like this song you have ADHD!!!"

**fadedblue09** (1): the beat reminds me of Seventeen - Boom Boom

**flavasavavandal** (1): it’s just childishly obnoxious with that “doo doo de doo” sound but without any of the charm

**Islands** (1): So sad they released this after The Stealer it's such a great song to my tastes and this is the exact opposite of what i like lmfao

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): lord this song just never ends

**SkylarV** (1): The Boyz have some high highs but also some LOW lows...

**wavingwolves** (1): the fact soobin was forced to dance to this is a homophobic crime there's no way around it

**mayolizard** (0): this was the last song i listened to in this rate. Before this permission to dance was my 0 but i heard this and swiftly wanted to die. Thank you the boyz!!! You fell off majorly considering the stealer is one of the better kpop songs in recent memory </3

**runaway3212** (0): this is like getting stuck on the ramp of a rollercoaster and then having to get out via stairs

---

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): I wish I didn’t like this because of that very uninspired Major Lazer rip-off drop, but IU just sells that hook so damn well

**1998tweety** (7): This is fine but its not the song I expect as a title track, this is acceptable only as a one-off DJ collab.

**throwaway-7650** (3.5): the drop is literally the worst part of IU’s entire discography, including what I haven’t heard yet

---

**bigbigbee** (10): I understand that the “celebrity fascinated by the life of a normal person” is a bit of a romanticized trope but I love it (probably because it’s literally designed to flatter the egos of normal people. She just like me fr)

**ebooks#5454** (10): IU if you read this im free on Thursday night and would like to hang out. Please respond to this and then hang out with me on Thursday night when I'm free.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song was so good i forgave it for its 2017 chopped up vocals drop

**pig-serpent** (10): Sweet and remotely heartbreaking.  The cutest song in the rate.

**TiltControls** (10): This is so pretty. I'm expecting it going day 1, but I really enjoy it

**YeyeDumpling** (10): Another candidate for the 11 I love the beautiful lyrics and chill loving vibe

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): am i the only one who thinks this sounds a little like Closer

**cremeebrulee** (9): overhated and for what

**MassiveThief** (9): that production is amazing

**metanoira** (9): chainsmoker ass drop but it slays kinda

**raggedy-princess** (9): where is her egot >:O

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): the production on this is really nice

**IsaiahTB0** (8.2): This song is sooo overhated. Lyrically one of her cutest tracks. Love this song and the message she gives about being yourself.

**bluetriangles04** (8): this bridge was seriously serving "I" - Taeyeon and I found the song to be super enjoyable :sob:

**flavasavavandal** (8): There are songs out there that just break my brain because of how mad they are. And this song is mad! What could've been a very simple mid-tempo pop song about liking someone despite how weird they are into also being weird. With a drop inspired by the vocal chop choruses of 2017 (more Gold by Kiiara (a 1)than It Ain't Me by Kygo (a 10)). This song is no doubt going to be polarising and hated for it's drop and that drop is bad. But I think I've come to terms with how much that drop just shatters my ability, and don't we all need a song like that sometimes. Not camp or so bad it's good. Something so bizarrely bad and out of place from the actual song that I can't help but love it now. I'm giving this an 8 despite the fact I think giving this song a numerical rating is a disservice to it. This song surely doesn't fit in with anything with how unsure and nervous it is, even other songs in the rate like Sticker or Dumb Dumb couldn't capture.

**HoshiLock** (8): tb

**Qwilphish** (8): A really beautiful and personal song from IU, a little basic but its incredibly catchy so I'll forgive it

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): if Savage is so 3008, this breakdown is so 2000-late

**aestheticen** (7.5): If "Celebrity" has a million fans, then I am one of them. If "Celebrity" has ten fans, then I am one of them. If "Celebrity" has only one fan then that is me. If "Celebrity" has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against "Celebrity", then I am against the world.

**paigama** (7.5): i had no positive feelings about this song when it first came out and forced myself to listen to it because I couldn't accept that IU's first comeback in a while was bad. I got it after a few listens but then after the release of the album I started disliking it again hence the 7.5

**sabooyah** (7.5): I like this. I wish her vocals were stronger though or maybe weightier ? it would have made this song so much better. Taeyeon IU collab when ?

=====

2021inKPOP: **poemforsmallthings** (7.3): everyone needs to stop being mean to this song

**yatcho** (7.3): cute but the production is a little dated, especially that tropical house

**anothertown** (7): soft choreo queen

**BasedButta** (7): this is why you take long to submit rates: first week I gave this like a 4 but it has grown enough on me to give it a 7! what an incredible underdog story, this will surely affect the results

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I’m hoping this is just symbolism and not a parasocial love song.

**DraculaWeekend** (7): so baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I don’t know what she’s saying outside you’re my celebrity but I’m sure it’s corny

**milkywayinradius** (7): not her best but IU can do no wrong, it's literally law.

**BaconShoes** (6.5): decent

**kyrgyzzephyr** (6.5): i have come to the conclusion that this is a chainsmokers song (neutral)

**MToms** (6.5): Hate the beat drop, so dated.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): vocal chop drop straight outta 2015

**sarcasticsobs** (6.5): A (mostly) cute song from Cannes darling Lee Ji-eun! *Hated* the post-chorus! Getting her to dance during it will not make me forgive!

**2l82bstr8** (6): this would've been a bop six years ago

**celladonn** (6): Pleasant but I don't really like that drop after the chorus

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): her chainsmokers'd moment

**Esh\_Kebab** (6): Great gowns, beautiful gowns.

**Kayaking11116** (6): the instrumentals in the chorus are meh in my opinion

**mayolizard** (6): it was cute ig

**rslashpoopheads** (6): I used to hate this song but IU worked her magic on me

**Stryxen** (6): I kinda like this and I don't know why… that scares me

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): I was on the verge of liking this song but since I couldn’t now I just feel disappointed, also the drop sounds super off

**vayyiqra** (6): I'm being nice to this because I know it has haters and I like IU and her Lilac album as a whole, but there is no question this is the far worse IU song in this rate. That drop-instead-of-a-chorus is not very good. Otherwise it's kind of cute.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): That drop instantly lowered my score for this song I’m still mad about it

**vhqv1997** (6): why this drop of all things....

**thedoctordances1940** (5.8): tbh i like what this is going for, the execution just sucks

**plastichaxan** (5.5): drops can really ruin a song

**apatel27** (5): The drop is unnecessary

**maybecrf** (5): i dont know what i just listened to, but it wasnt good

**welcome2thejam** (5): Damnit, first half of the chorus is great, song was sounding solid, only to become another k-pop rate victim of a trash-tier drop

**Cooler\_lin** (4.6): stupid boring i can barely remember how it sounds no matter how much i re-listen

**bulforster** (4.5): that drop really tanks an otherwise nice song

**moonshxne** (4.5): A forgettable trend-chasing track (...by that I mean it chases trends over a decade old) featuring lots of annoying hi-hats and misguided EDM drops that gives the Chainsmokers, this easily belongs at the bottom of IU’s discography. Compared to some of the other songs I’ve heard on the rate, though, this almost sounds quaint.

**seanderlust** (4.5): celebrity pull me closer in the backseat of your rover that i know you can't affo

**vuemaurel** (4.5): I love IU but I wasn't feeling this one.

2021inKPOP: **akanewasright** (4): this song’s sin is being generic and dull, it’s not as bad as some of y’all are making it out to be

**frogaranaman** (4): "I Took A Pill In Ibiza" but more confusing

**Gonza\_90** (4): I sleep

**jay duh** (4): mawma...

**letsallpoo** (4): fuck /u/imadudeduh

**mimins** (4): wasn't feeling it. the longer it went on the less I liked it

**orbiteezus** (4): the drop gives me flashbacks to bad kpop youtube compilations

**skargardin** (4): Oh this snooze

**tiltheendoftheline** (4): that drop doesn't fit at all imo

**TragicKingdom1** (4): this was the biggest song of last year in korea??

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.7): the chopped up vocals chorus💀

**CrimsonROSET** (3): you’re telling me it took them five years to catch onto drops and they couldn’t even pick out the good ones

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): these lyrics are very uplifting <3 unfortunately the NCS beat brought me back to the hopeless reality.

**ilyyyyy** (3): possibly my least favorite iu single, either this or bbibbi. don't know why, maybe bc it's kinda empty and i don't love the drop either.

**ricki** (3): popheads would have eaten this up if bridgit mendler had released it in 2016

**Zypker125** (2.1): I’ve never gotten the hype for IU’s songs, and this song is no exception.

**bespectacIed** (2): If IU didn't literally rule korea, this would languish in anonymity. this is generic and dated EDM... leave this sound in 2016 i beg

**chancehugs** (2): I don't even like IU that much, but this feels like a low for her.

**runaway3212** (2): the celebrity is Jin

**whoisValensi** (2): I have personally decided this song is boring. Like not to extremely shade IU but this is the most watered down second-hand attempt at a Taeyeon song I have ever heard. Like I'm sure there's worse but like mannnnnnnn this is not good!

**DaBigBoi** (1): One of the most disappointing beat drops ever if not the worst

**moonagenightmares** (1): i wasnt paying attention to the song names and that chorus was so bad in a 2017 way i was surprised to see it was iu

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): this horrid horrid song omfgggg i’m literally iu stan but ryan jhun you will pay for your crimes.

**PSSST12** (1): worst tt in IU's discography. Like girl what is this genericness???? 😭😭

**Victerade** (1): not yall hyping this garbage song

**wavingwolves** (1): as a long time iunator nothing hurts me more than having to rate this song so low but it hurts my principles as a person

**hikkaru** (0): iu sweetie listen to me this isn't you

**throwaway-7650** (8.4): There was a time when all 3 NCT songs were going out consecutively, unfortunately it was never meant to last as I think we can all agree that this song is miles better than the other 2 (the fact that this picked up a 0 before Hot Sauce!). Still, the fact my score for the 3 NCT songs combined isn’t even 10…

**1998tweety** (5): Enough with the weird spoken bits Mark, it’s getting too hard to defend you. NCT 2020 felt like an EVENT but unfortunately the 2021 lineup felt very meh to me.

---

**Cooler\_lin** (10): DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS SONG WHILE YOU ARE DRIVING, i almost died trying to twerk while pressing the gas

**IsaiahTB0** (10): What a great song. Love how the "lets play ball" line is chanted throughout. Xiaojun really shined and Mark's rap is always entertaining.

**kpoppyko** (10): i grade boy groups on a different scale from women

**mimins** (10): I would play ball with them

**PSSST12** (10): The scratch that ball tiktok remix bump the score for this one

**runaway3212** (10): this is 15 songs combined but it does not not slay

**twiceoftheheart** (10): Shotaro

**Zypker125** (10): Ah, I love it when SM releases good music instead of the experimental dumpster fire they’ve been in for the past 5 years.

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I was in a dance class in which they were teaching this song and when we were doing it at the end in small groups, I completely forgot the choreography and just stood there for like a full minute. It was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. Anyway I think that the fact that I can still listen to this song and like it despite that association speaks to the fact that it’s a banger

**cremeebrulee** (9): this hook is like when the 5 year old kid youre babysitting has a crush on you

**Kayaking11116** (9): I MEANNN IF YOU WANNA PLAY BALL THENNN

**moonshxne** (9): ugh i’m such a simp for the classic SM sound

**Qwilphish** (9): NCT 2021 is defined by the Repackage tracks absolutely shitting on the main tracks... this is no exception

**ricki** (9): i wouldn't mind playing with mark's b- \*gunshot*

**sliced-peaches** (9): lmao just realizing universe is here but my point in the prev comment still stands

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): there's a gay joke to be made here i just don't know it

**celladonn** (8.5): If you rearrange the letters in NCT U you get CUNT which is what they serve

**orbiteezus** (8.5): my favorite NCT title last year, the production is so immaculate shoutout to Dem Jointz, the synth solos are just so slick also that acapella part was great

**seanderlust** (8.2): let's play ball! let's play ball!

=====

2021inKPOP: **wavingwolves** (8.1): mark is right i do have THE wap thanks!

**BaconShoes** (8): it wasn’t as interesting or unique maybe as sticker and hot sauce, but it was a bop

**bluetriangles04** (8): I actually hadn't listened to this too much till starting this rate and I have to say I found it super enjoyable and just... super fun? The instrumental work here is so interesting to me.

**jay duh** (8): what does mark know about waps

**agentofscranton** (7.5): throwing ass to the outro

**ebooks#5454** (7.5): this gave the Twilight baseball scene a run for its money

**jasannn** (7.5): SCRATCH THAT BALL SCRATCH THAT BALL

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): would be a 10 if the whole song sounded like the “let’s play ball” bit tbh

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): Mark and Haechan gotta be so fucking busy because i just watched them in three different music videos for three different groups

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Outsold Coldplay but I’m not blown away.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): SEE? THIS IS FINE. WASN’T THAT HARD WAS IT

**hanpop** (7): i keep thinking of that tiktok sound that goes "scratch that ball"

**ilyyyyy** (7): oh no. oh yes? don't know if i like it or not. i think i do.

**moonagenightmares** (7): hmmmmm…. yknow what its kinda good. it makes me feel nostalgic for some reason, ig it feels a bit like old nct

**rotating3Dtext** (7): ok let’s play ball

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I have no idea what they're saying but girl I'm living

**sabooyah** (7): the beginning, mark's rap, and end of this track are the closest nct has ever come to a twerk anthem but they ruined it with the chorus. not that the chorus is bad but like. excuse me what happened to the beat? i thought you guys wanted to see what i got ??

**tiltheendoftheline** (7): the chorus is too subdued for a song that has a very loud LET'S PLAY BALL LET'S PLAY BALL

**welcome2thejam** (7): Only a jock themed song would follow "You're my world, my universe" with "High five"

**whoisValensi** (7): EXO did sports better with "Love Me Right" in this essay I will explore how partying to the sundown with a Shawty is better than calling someone your world, your universe, your star, your victory, and your destiny. At least this song has a bit more personality than "Hot Sauce" and "Sticker"... "But Nick those have tons of personality!" but think about why those have personality. I've made my point. At least this doesn't feel like about 12 different songs clumped together into one song. For better or for worse I suppose.

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): HOW MANY NCTs ARE THERE, JFC

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I rather play basketball than listen to that chorus

**moooo566** (6.5): unlike the other NCT tracks in this rate, there is actually a song here. commendable.

**akanewasright** (6): The chorus is neat and yet they felt the need to include the rest

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): this goes off in places but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD NCT MAKE YOUR SONGS NORMAL

**BasedButta** (6): as i soon as i read that this was named “let’s play ball” i was sure it would be stupid. well i was completely right, but it’s also a passable song (when they stop wanting to play ball), and the video is kinda funny so i had a good time with it

**melody** (6): we want more shotaro SM you slags

**omgthenerve** (6): weak title track from an otherwise amazing album

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): is this a jock jam

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i dont dance sounds a lot different than i remember it sounding

**Gonza\_90** (5.5): At least this song’s quality is above the Mendoza Line

**LesApfels** (5.5): That chant makes no sense and detracts from the song. They did my boys dirty!

**anothertown** (5): said Pablo Sanchez

**apatel27** (5): It's a chant

**DaBigBoi** (5): SCRATCH THAT BALL

=====

2021inKPOP: **FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): if they sticked that chorus to the verses of like, limitless this would have been the soty… instead we got this half-baked excuse for verses. pain!

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): It’s been a few weeks and I’ve still been wracking my brain trying to figure out the connection between the phrases “You’re my universe” and “Let’s play ball”

**2l82bstr8** (4.5): this is just like baseball (loud, annoying, and difficult to understand)

**alwayswords** (4): let’s play forever i just wanna be your do- gunshot

**chancehugs** (4): The opening reminds me of My Chick Bad, and that's all I can think about the rest of the song.

**maybecrf** (4): im uncomfortable

**mayolizard** (4): only thinking of that tiktok sound that says scratch that ball over and over again

**skargardin** (4): wow all these NCT titles truly suck

**Stryxen** (4): I hated it then I liked it and then I was bored. 4 minutes why?

**thedoctordances1940** (4): at least this song is over a lot faster than baseball games

**vayyiqra** (4): The aggressive "let's play BALL" intro sucks but the chorus isn't bad. I was going to give this a 2 but there's worse in this rate. Still I feel like Dem Jointz is incapable these days of making a song that isn't weird and divisive, and I kind of respect it.

**aestheticen** (3): This is rough.... the chorus carries it

**bespectacIed** (3): loona outsold

**Kadenfrost** (2): Genuinely what is this song about

**pig-serpent** (2): Better than the last two NCT songs by a lot but I still hate the “let’s play ball” part

**metanoira** (1.5): doyoung main slayer!!! everything else...

**2dina3dworld** (1): let’s not

**ImADudeDuh** (1): ok i think they should just stop making music

**MassiveThief** (1): After hearing this multiple times, my brain has pavlov'd itself into skipping the SECOND I hear that "lets play ball" shout

**plastichaxan** (1): sorry i’m gay

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): High School Musical meets terrible 80s scifi movies?

**vhqv1997** (1): everytime i thought the song was heading into a good direction they decided to play ball

**treecoh** (0): ENOUGH

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): It’s like he’s singing directly into my pussy

**1998tweety** (8): I liked this but honestly I’m not too surprised to see y’all pan it. It is a ballad by a man after all. He did serve sex though you can’t deny that.

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): This song managed to pick up 2 11s AND 0s. The 11s I can understand, but the 0s? I don’t think this song is *great* or anything but this feels like a robbery. Maybe balladphobia meant that it was never going to do well but it still deserves better. UN Village remains his best song ~~and it deserved better too in the BG rate~~.

---

**anothertown** (10): hot!!!!!

**apatel27** (10): Such a sexy track

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): saaay supremacy YAS

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Baekhyun really did that

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): baekhyun if you’re reading this i am free on thursday night. if you would like to hang out i am free on thursday night when i am free to hang out. i am free to hang out on thursday night so if you want to hang out on thursday night i am free.

**Jhe116** (10): and this is the weakest track of the album his mind

**Kayaking11116** (10): oh. oh my god. so um. yea. holy shit. i think he has some of the best vocals ive ever heard

**omgthenerve** (10): I think about Baekhyun hanging off the side of the train belting out this bridge in the MV at least once a day, I want a live performance of this song the day he's discharged from the military

**moonagenightmares** (9.3): baekhyun always delivers what can i say

**bespectacIed** (9): King of exo. one of the few slayers in male soloists, thee male taeyeon

**PSSST12** (9): now this is actually so sensual and groovy. Miss Byun asserting himself as one of kpops best vocalist.

**vhqv1997** (9): i still can't stop thinking about how he never once performed this song live but it still got nominated for best performance of the year

**chenle** (8.6): you're my only bambibam... bayyy

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): I'll never not be a sucker for this style of music and Baekhyun's voice just slides through the whole song like butter. idk why he's calling me a slur but I have to agree

**bluetriangles04** (8.5): Bambi is simply Baekhyun in his element. Not like I didn't enjoy Candy which was very fast paced for me in comparison after UN Village for example, but I feel like his voice really excels in these songs where he is able to bring a kind of provocative vulnerability to the table.

**mimins** (8.5): thank you king

**starla\_** (8.5): cute bop

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): oh this is very bbtm-era weeknd ... i'm listening

**moonshxne** (8.2): Baekhyun uses sooooo much melisma here that this kinda sounds like a vocal exercise…BUT everything the bridge and on is **glorious** (yet showcases admirable restraint).

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): something tells me this man has not seen bambi

**chancehugs** (8): Only Baekhyun can make a word like 'Bambi' sound sensual af.

**jay duh** (8): padding score cause thats father figure

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): baekhyun is kinda the definition of a perfect idol and you know he’s always gonna serve you an album of good, but not groundbreaking, pop&b and for that we appreciate him <3 come back from the military soon king

**NotWith10000Men** (8): so about that title.... i actually know someone named bambi irl. let's just say i WISH i could think about the orphaned deer instead. everything else about the song is really nice tho

**tiltheendoftheline** (8): This is so refreshing, I love his singing so much. I like the sexy chill vibes, it's a shame we don't have a single performance.

=====

2021inKPOP: **Cooler\_lin** (7.9): probably deserves higher just on vocals alone but i refuse to acknowledge baekhyun has good music, my beef with him is too strong

**paigama** (7.3): i remember this song to have an annoyingly high amount of bambis in the lyrics but it's actually quite alright now. the .3 is for the vocals

**sarcasticsobs** (7.3): *Great* voice, almost all points are for that. Not much else hit for me

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): I LOOOOOVE those classic train interiors, it's just so cozy, so I'm a total sucker for this video, the song however…

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the Mad at Disneyprint

**IsaiahTB0** (7): Every song on the mini was better than this.

**Kadenfrost** (7): Bakhyun vocals always great and the production is really good, but I just found this boring I'm sorry

**melody** (7): thank you for my r card in SMTOWN Superstar I guess!

**milkywayinradius** (7): pretty hot, but disney movies are not hot so nice try baekhyun

**skargardin** (7): cute bop!

**yatcho** (7): Sleek, falls into generic male idol song territory though

**ebooks#5454** (6.7): wheres the deer??

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): i feel like i'm missing something bc this just doesn't click for me somehow

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): feeling horny on main

**cherryices** (6.3): stellar vocals obviously and he is trying his hardest to sell these lyrics! but i’m not buying

**BaconShoes** (6): kind of vibe but idk

**ernie** (6): (this is quite a disappointing and forgettable release tbh, even kai outdid baekhyun)

**ignitethephoenix** (6): imagine someone saying to you that you are like Bambi, I guess there are worse comparisons

**ilyyyyy** (6): a little boring,,, it sounds okay but it's nothing special,,, the disney character references are taking me out for some reason

**sabooyah** (6): if kai had the range this would have been his song 100%. Don't think this was a good track for baekhyun but not bad overall

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): You know, technically this is the gayest song in the rate. Either that or nobody told Baekhyun that Bambi was a boy

**whoisValensi** (6): NO BAEKHYUN DON'T STEP IN FRONT OF THAT TRAIN!!!!!!! THE TRAIN OF THE SMCU IS GONNA FORCE YOU INTO KWANGYA TOO IF YOU DO THAT!!!! Oh wait "Don't Fight The Feeling" happened and already caused that... FUCK! Okay idk if it's because I'm on hour uhhhh 30? of having a migraine but if a dude told me I was his only "Bambi" I think I would be a lil idk weirded out lollll. I will say, very solid grooves in this song but like man I just keep thinking of the deer... and it's just really weird.

**seanderlust** (5.7): i know the center sliver of the venn diagram of kpop fans and disney adults went nuts for this one

**Esh\_Kebab** (5.5): Arguably the steamiest song about a Disney deer ever.

**plastichaxan** (5.5): this is so camp why is he singing about a deer

**wavingwolves** (5.5): [person who has never watched bambi] this is so lame!

**BasedButta** (5): dude this is creepy stop it, if he sang this to me i would run the fuck away UPDATE: this grew on me (MUSICALLY, the mv still creeps me out), its not that bad

**flavasavavandal** (5): someone tell Baekhyun that Bambi is more closely associated with having a dead mum than being cute

**frogaranaman** (5): awh. is he saying she died

**maybecrf** (5): im not sure who this is for

**orbiteezus** (5): it’s definitely a song sung by baekhyun

**pig-serpent** (5): This isn’t a good song, but it’s very close to being one and I respect that.  There’s just so much potential left hanging, e.g. the bridge perfectly set up the last chorus to have a larger instrumental and the song refusing.

**Qwilphish** (5): He sounds great, but for this rate, an rnb ballad just isnt what Im looking for

**2dina3dworld** (4): Bambi sounds like the title to a Phoebe Bridgers song that includes the lyrics “and when the hunter shot Bambi’s mom, it felt like you leaving me all over again”.

**aestheticen** (4): He thought he did something rhyming Bambi (the deer) with bambi (밤비, night rain). It's the same word Baekhyun

**celladonn** (4): Baekhyun's vocals are great but his music is so boring

**fadedblue09** (4): Sounds more like a vocal venting session than an actual song

**nicolas** (4): noooo baekhyun dont make mid songs ur so sexy haha

**vayyiqra** (4): I want to not be a basic Pophead (balladphobic) but I don't like this sorry! The guitar is really nice though.

**vuemaurel** (4): Eh, I was expecting more from him after UN Village which was simply exquisite.

**thedoctordances1940** (3.8): just kinda boring tbh

**ricki** (3.5): the first verse being amazing only for the entire song's quality to plummet when the chorus comes

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): least annoying disney adult

2021inKPOP: **bigbigbee** (3): greasy

**CrimsonROSET** (3): oh this is why kpop isnt known for ballads

**hikkaru** (3): oh that chorus is horrible shut up about that stupid deer idc

**MassiveThief** (3): kinda boring, wish it went somewhere

**mayolizard** (3): naur

**runaway3212** (3): same quality as the movie

**bulforster** (2.7): I was so bored

**Zypker125** (2.2): Brings me back to the good days when I called UN Village “city pop” in the Boy Groups Rate and got clowned on by the entire subreddit. Guess I’m gonna get clowned for my Baekhyun song takes again, because like the song title, this song makes me want to get shot by a hunter in the forest.

**agentofscranton** (2): i feel like i'm being harassed in a club rn i'm just trying to have a drink sir

**metanoira** (2): bambis mom didnt die for this...

**Stryxen** (2): even clairo outselling this

**thisusernameisntlong** (2): furry anthem?

**sage** (1.7): the way hes literally just flexing his vocals on this gives the video of the one girl singing humble

**DaBigBoi** (1.5): nice bridge. Don’t like the rest, especially his delivery

**alwayswords** (1): how many times am i going to have to hear him say bambi

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): I assumed “Bambi” was a term of endearment in Korean but not apparently he’s actually talking about the Disney deer with the dead mom.

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): fuck SM entertainment

**1998tweety** (6): Their Desi serve! So What into Why Not? Into PTT was PAINFUL. Thankfully they’ve kind of redeemed themselves with Flip That, but I do miss the way LOONA used to effortlessly put out bop after bop.

**OliviaGodrigo** (2): Title sounds exactly like what Orbits do. No I definitely don’t have anecdotal evidence

---

**BaconShoes** (10): such a smash omg

**bespectacIed** (10): All I can say is ..... TOWN? PAINTED. I almost unstanned from this, ngl. It was a hard time to be an orbit, every fandom orbits has pissed off attacking from all corners, and we can do nothing about it??? If you're still an orbit after this you deserve compensation fr. Worth it tho, this orbit shit is for life

**hanpop** (10): again don't play this while driving

**hikkaru** (10): if you know you know the girls that get it get it etc etc

**jay duh** (10): GET READYYYYY

**ricki** (10): you're not gonna get the song the first time you hear it, after the second and third time, you're gonna be like "wow what is this", it sounds nothing like anything that's out right now, you know, the lyrics are very-

**runaway3212** (10): WE ABOUT TO PAINT THE TOWN [continuing to slay]

**thedoctordances1940** (10): idc this shit is fucking amazing, experimental masterpiece, merzbow wishes he could make this

**mayolizard** (9.5): slayyyyyy

**vuemaurel** (9.5): Kpop and bollywood - a duo that can never go wrong

**DraculaWeekend** (9): This really popped off

**ilyyyyy** (9): so what's older sister that i love slightly less

**orbiteezus** (9): im still disappointed by the drop but outside of that this is really an awesome song ngl, prechorus is so catchy and i love the instrumental. wish the bollywood influence was more present but that being said im not mad at this

**pig-serpent** (9): The best vaguely middle eastern EDM k-pop song in the rate… Why are there so many of these?

**PSSST12** (9): I think every orbits hated this song but I always had a soft spot for tribal aesthetics. Sue me.

**vayyiqra** (9): I didn't like this at first but for better or worse I seem to have a thing for all the "ethnic hip" songs in this rate (putting aside the more nuanced issue of the Lisa songs) and yeah this is fun!

**xxipil0ts** (9): - and ppl wonder why ethel cain voted for her in queendom

**mimins** (8.5): this song was so over hated like...it's good????

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): The “Paint The Town” defender has logged on (me)

**paigama** (8.2): actually better than what i remember

**chancehugs** (8): I actually deleted this off my playlist for a while because the English lyrics were too nonsensical to ignore (is it moon or sky, and living is wise ???). I've since gotten better at ignoring them, but still not quite.

**Gonza\_90** (8): I like this IDK

**ignitethephoenix** (8): in their Selena Gomez come and get it bag

**Victerade** (8): didnt dislike actually

**whoisValensi** (8): Oh god... Ohhhhh god... YouTube is gonna think this is the greatest song to recommend to me at all hours of the day again for a month straight now following this rate... And as much as I hate to admit it, this dumbass song grew on me. Yeah it's not at all what I wanna see ever again from LOONA, yeah they tried having their EG moment and they had fun maybe I guess (I say maybe because we all saw the videos of how they kept fucking up their knees due to this choreo...) but like let's never do this again! Anyways aside from that, this song has some clunky ass English which is fantastic! And I'm not being sarcastic when I say that. Because holy shit I love a lil clunky English in my K-Pop songs!

**Cooler\_lin** (7.5): def doesn't deserve the hate it gets from orbits

**maybecrf** (7.5): very weird production, but the song is good

**moonagenightmares** (7.5): the opening tricked me into thinking this song was gonna have more folk influence… that tiny part still slays though

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): are they in their (G)I-DLE era or do they get a pass

**Tazzachar** (7.5): this comeback just really wasn’t it for me, but as an orbit I'm glad the GP seemed to enjoy it

2021inKPOP: **bulforster** (7.3): that alarm noise under chuu's high note really makes me yass for some reason

**2l82bstr8** (7): this is actually kinda fun I guess the paint fumes have gotten to me

**Kayaking11116** (7): The beat is very good and kind of addicting

**sabooyah** (7): hype

**sliced-peaches** (7): i cant even lie i dont like this song but ill never say anything bad about loona EVER

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.7): it's better than i remember it being

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.5): this one's gonna get bullied but i think it's alright, not their best at all but there's worse songs here

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): we could’ve had a fun bollywood inspired song, but then they got girl crush poisoning

**wavingwolves** (6.3): idk this has its merits actually... i saw the vision...

**coolfluffle** (6): a bit of an upsetting divergence from their iconic sound but the dance was spectacular

**ebooks#5454** (6): the psychic damage that beat drop gave me

**NotWith10000Men** (6): sounds a little dated

**Stryxen** (5.5): I don't get how anyone can have a strong opinion about this song

**yatcho** (5.5): this Idle reject..

**sage** (5.4): i hated this at first then i was like waittt its hitting now its mid

**anothertown** (5): i don't dislike it as much as i did when it came out but i'm still not about to listen of my own volition

**BasedButta** (5): they KNOW the huge drum is cool as fuck - so why not play it more? the saving grace of this song are the parts where the percussion is taking the reins! but it seems we can’t escape this ass anti-drop trend so here we are!

**CrimsonROSET** (5): stan loona

**flavasavavandal** (5): I like light fluffy LOONA over trying to slay LOONA

**moonshxne** (5): i was ready for *some* action but not that chorus

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Putting this on while I look at leaked Genshin Impact Sumeru characters to get the full appropriation experience

2021inKPOP: **IsaiahTB0** (4.2): Great verses, ruined by an awful chorus.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Not another worse version of “How You Like That” in this rate…

**frogaranaman** (4): paint it in WHAT

**ImADudeDuh** (4): Prinity the Tuck

**rslashpoopheads** (4): Hyolyn could do PTT but Loona couldn't do See Sea

**vhqv1997** (4): tragically this wasn't the queendom remix because that version is so much better

**Zypker125** (3.1): “Stan LOONA because of their creatively unique and fresh production” *Proceeds to release the most generic girl crush song in existence* fucking RIP

**apatel27** (3): This isn't interesting enough for all the discourse around it

**imasalesman** (3): I don’t think I’ll ever forgive BBC for this

**Qwilphish** (3): Stop giving LOONA this aggressive concept, it just doesn't fit...

**Roxieloxie** (3): this would be like an 8 if it was itzy because i dont have expectations from them but unfortunately its loona and so im just disappointed

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): every song i hear from loona makes me even more perplexed on how they became one of the biggest names in kpop in the western sphere

**celladonn** (2.5): ...think I'm just going to keep listening to predebut Loona and pretend this never happened

**MoonlightByWindow** (2.5): i actually enjoy this up until the godawful chorus. an extra 0.5 because heejin is hot

**aestheticen** (2): More like PTT (Physical Torture & Torment)

**akanewasright** (2): yeah I get nothing out of this. I don’t *hate* this but I feel nothing when I hear it

**skargardin** (2): this was a massive choice

**2dina3dworld** (1): I’m a So What defender and I still can’t defend this

**bluetriangles04** (1): what if I said that [redacted] did it better? *gunshots*

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): they better be glad i hate another song more than this one because wheewww im using this song to grab a drink at their show next month

**DaBigBoi** (1): This is the song they play at straight pride

**letsallpoo** (1): their disbandment can't come soon enough

**RandomHypnotica** (1): this being by LOONA just makes it so much more dissapointing

**jasannn** (0): I remember yassing on discord on 1st listen then immediately doing a full 180 on the 2nd listen

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): One of my favorite songs of the year, but I also don’t disagree with the people who say this belongs in a Trolls soundtrack. The undulating production is irresistible, the song has some very memorable lines, and the boys, for once, aren’t autotuned to the point where their lyrics are unintelligible. Pure, unadulterated fun for everyone!

**throwaway-7650** (7.9): This is their best English song by far but I understand the 0s for it. I will be giving Dynamite a 0 if it ever becomes rated though.

**1998tweety** (4): Margarine ended ha. At least this is better than Dynamite and PTD I’ll say that. The Megan remix ate a bit I fear.

---

**frogaranaman** (11): all I can say is I had fun

**Roxieloxie** (11): Easily my favorite song here, the meg version deserves to be in the one in the main rate but whatever ill just pretend like im rating that one. I've never been huge on bts, i've never hated them but also never super enjoyed them. This song is such a good one though. I found maybe one or two songs here i'd consider 11ing but this was the song that made me push through it all so i cant not do it.

**anothertown** (10): a classic methinks

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): yeah i don't care what people think this slays. yoongi's rap makes me feel things

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Just a good summer song

**ilyyyyy** (10): the only kpop song i got to hear on the radio at work last year & it was always an instant mood lifter, rm's shout out to army is so cute to me lol

**milkywayinradius** (10): this song was summer 2021 as I sat in the mcdonalds drive thru for the bts chicken nuggets meal. it's cute and the dance is fun

**pig-serpent** (10): I expected to hate this because of the google ads.  Turns out it’s actually really good!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Björk-adjacent tbh https://youtu.be/FIpICtqKs4w

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): I know the quality of their English catalogue is controversial but I genuinely love this. it would be a disaster on someone else's hands but they really do sell it (and it would've been a 10 had it been the Megan remix)

**exciting\_patient4872** (9.4): Megan The Stallion really blends in with the boys in this one! Can't even hear her!

**Zypker125** (9.4): “Don’t need no Usher to remind me you got it bad” Kendrick Lamar wishes he had this level of poetry

**akanewasright** (9): docked a point for being too COWARDLY to have Megan’s remix in the main rate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Is it overly slick and produced and focus grouped for as much mass appeal as possible? Yes. Does it still slap? Yes.

**bluetriangles04** (9): Say what you want about this, but I think this was insanely fun for them at that point of time. Butter was probably their best choice for an English single post Dynamite, and that was reflected by its overwhelming success. It's a fun little song that doesn't make me feel pain everytime my mom asks for me to play it.

**hikkaru** (9): megan remix is a 10

**Qwilphish** (9): give us the Megan version you cowards!!

**skargardin** (9): bop idc idc

**TiltControls** (9): It's fun. It's kind of directionless, but it's still a ton of fun.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): I can't make it NOT bop (but this is missing meg's magic)

**poemforsmallthings** (8.8): I still think Dynamite was their best English single but this was a cute little tune

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): still traumatized from modding billboard #1 threads on this song but I’ll admit it is good

**SkylarV** (8.5): The one of their three English singles which is good

**Victerade** (8.2): it was nice

=====

2021inKPOP: **BasedButta** (8): oh bts how nice you are to honor my username with this song! but I must remain impartial :)

**bigbigbee** (8): “SMOOD. LIKE. BUDDAH” tickles me so much. I think I’ve typed that into my friends’ group chat like twenty times

**chancehugs** (8): Much better than Dynamite.

**Kadenfrost** (8): I like the dance break and retro vibe but I felt that this song was just safe. If this was the Megan remix though chef's kiss

**maybecrf** (8): it needs megan, but it still hits

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): my friends and family finally know what kpop is after this song

**seanderlust** (8): yeah this look good but i still wanna know where megan at

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): …overhated? i won’t particularly defend this song that much because its far from perfect but as it is? yeah its a decently catchy kpop song in english if any group other than bts had released this it would’ve been so much more acclaimed

**vayyiqra** (8): This is not that bad Popheads just hates fun! That, or more likely the breakup of Daft Punk has made me a bit deranged and I will take any funky summer jams no matter how bad they are. But really this is fun once you get past a few bad lyrics ("no ice on my wrist I'm the nice guy"). It's so funny how polarizing this is.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Song's actually good when it's not soundtracking the 20th straight Apple ad on youtube

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I feel like this is way better than Dynamite but it didn’t have nearly the same impact on radio and the GP. I wonder why

**paigama** (7.7): the only song from BTS's English trilogy? that I still enjoy after the first day, and that's mostly because the vocals never sound robotic on this track.

**aestheticen** (7.5): It's their best song from their 3-English songs stretch

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): this is just gibberish but it slays

**whoisValensi** (7.5): WAIT STOP I JUST REALIZED THIS ENTIRE TIME I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS VIDEO IN FULL HOLD ON LOLLLLLLLLLL. Anyways I hear this song, "Dynamite", and "Boy with Luv" at my work. So yeah. (I've also heard "Star" by LOONA & "Magic" by TXT). Anyways this song is fun, even if they may uhhhh hate it. (Which you know what, they're allowed to. Cause I too miss the old BTS, BTS.) At least my mom loves this song!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.2): i think this is BTS’ superior English release - not that it’s a high bar to begin with but…

**celladonn** (7): Immensely overplayed and the lyrics are cringey but it's still fun

**CrimsonROSET** (7): don’t talk about the discourse don’t talk about the discourse don’t talk about the discourse don’t talk about the discourse don’t talk about the discourse don’t talk about the discourse don’t talk about the discourse don’t talk about the discourse don’t talk about the discourse don’t talk about the discourse don’t talk about the discourse don’t talk about the discourse don’t talk about the di

**ernie** (7): (this song is the best out of their english releases)

**hanpop** (7): i like the version with Megan better

**jay duh** (7): unplug jins mic

**Kayaking11116** (7): best out of the English trilogy but still mediocre at best

**mayolizard** (7): cute song but listening back i like it less…

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): by far their best song out of the english trifecta and it’s literally not even close. permission t0 dance and dyn0mite are amongst some of the worst kpop songs i’ve ever heard in my several years as a kpop fan, but yet their legion of western songwriters managed to make this actually good?! who would’ve thunk…

**NotWith10000Men** (7): my favorite of the big english singles. this one got me to check out an album. didn't really like it. but i still bop to this

**bulforster** (6.5): their hair in the mv is so triggering as a former disgusting 13 year old who didn't get haircuts or shower enough.

**mimins** (6.5): the best of their english trilogy but still not a big fan. I miss their emo days so much it's unreal.

**cherryices** (6): i will come to you house. i will go to your fridgerator fridge fridge your fridgerator i will take your butter out of your fridge i will eat the butter in front of you and your families EYES. ... and eh i force you to watch me while i eat ALL your butter! that you were gonna have at christmas eve...ning. you will beg and cry and say “NO DONT EAT ALL OUR BUTTER WE NEED FOR XMAS” i will say “AHAH NOT MY PROBLEM” and take the empty bottle i will throw it down the.stairway. i will go home. and be the way for all you danish people. what if we came and take all your red disgusting SAUSHEG. saushege? ..... i don’t mean to me violent i just have to paint it out so you understann that is not very uhhhhhh uh uh uh nice. we are a country in NEED. and this is the thank. thank you very much.

2021inKPOP: **DaBigBoi** (6): Not bad, I’d take it over quite a few of their other title tracks

**sabooyah** (6): i like the chorus and some of the raps but not the best bts track tbh.

**sliced-peaches** (6): the one time i enjoyed this song i was in the mcdonalds drive thru for my bts meal

**tiltheendoftheline** (6): it's a perfectly fine pop song, but I don't feel much more than that about it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I mean it was an improvement over Dynamite… but is that really saying much?

**starla\_** (5.8): this song is annoying but not terrible

**thedoctordances1940** (5.8): it does have a really good hook but the smooth like butter part is just really annoying i'm sorry

**wavingwolves** (5.5): what even is there to say about this song... nothing...

**alwayswords** (5): kohl’s core

**cosmicneve** (5): This song reminds me of Dynamite, but with a better beat. It is generally inoffensive - there is nothing in particular to hate, but nothing interesting enough to love. It is easy to listen to, but even easier not to listen to.

**IsaiahTB0** (5): The way they went from a 10 week #1 BB Hot 100 single to barely charting w the next single. The duality!

**plastichaxan** (5): this is… fun actually?

**runaway3212** (5): missing mommy megan

**Tazzachar** (5): dynamite was better, there I said it

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): actually up until they start jumping in the elevator this is quite fun

**agentofscranton** (4.5): this is a minions song

**BaconShoes** (4): it’s like almost good but it’s missing something idk maybe the chorus is just not giving. A bit irritating

**orbiteezus** (4): i’m a dynamite defender (unfortunately) but i dislike this song. I know people complain about hybe bgs having overprocessed vocals and all but like this song really needed a lot more of that. just slather their voices in autotune

**PSSST12** (4): tsk. This english singles are just not IT. like we need to go back and serve another RUN sirs??

**Stryxen** (4): I'm a hot knife

**jasannn** (3.5): This song activates my fight or flight but it is technically a good song I can’t give it my 0.

**LilacDaffodils** (3.5): less like spreading butter on the perfect piece of toast and more like swallowing a tablespoon of butter whole and trying not to choke on the fat. Sometimes I want to eat some straight up butter though.

**moonshxne** (3.5): in their flop era i fear

**sarcasticsobs** (3.5): Yeah, it *can be* catchy but it’s pretty empty. Ever since I learned about BTS’ more hip-hop-based origins in another rate, almost everything they’ve done has disappointed me. I think the chorus choreo looks fun

**bespectacIed** (3): Creatively, artistically, lyrically bankrupt..... but a bop is a bop sorry lol I think I stockholmed myself for NOT being too mad at this. It's still bad but... imma keep my mouf shut and silently bop

**Cooler\_lin** (3): the autotune in this song genuinely gives me a headache some days. it's also horribly generic and boring

**flavasavavandal** (3): not as bad as I wish it was to be worth absolutely trashing, but not even remotely close to being good

**melody** (3): terrible

**ImADudeDuh** (2.5): Butter? No... cottage cheese? yea...

**apatel27** (2): The fact ARMYs ride or died for this track

**cremeebrulee** (2): this song is genuinely horrible, i'm sorry djhfjgsd. it’s just like so unpleasant to listen to and honestly i would prefer silence to this. i would've been kinder to the megan remix tbh

**MassiveThief** (2): Thought this was meh when I first heard it and it aged like milk. Or butter, idk.

**static\_int\_husp** (2): at least it's not the Remix?

**2dina3dworld** (1): fun fact, I don’t put butter on my toast because I hate the taste. Just like how I hate this song

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): bland kidz bop pop + retail overplay whew how the might have fallen

**ebooks#5454** (1): we really did not need this song

**moonagenightmares** (1): even they dont like this

**vhqv1997** (1): so let me get this right: they were all together in the studio together, with several other people, producers, songwriters, directors, people of esteemed reputation and experience, and everybody agreed, that this was not cringe?

**nicolas** (0): turn it off!!!

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): You have to be a non-virgin to get the appeal of this song

**1998tweety** (9): He served sex what can I say?

---

**jay duh** (10): am i the pretty girl? I enjoy peaches quite a lot

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): kai kinda being one of the best kpop artists ever #sorry…his 2 minis are excellent and proof that sm still knows how to make good music

**tiltheendoftheline** (10): I'm the farthest from objective here (as he's my ult), but I love this so much. His voice is really lovely, it's a chill bop with some suggestive lyrics and the overall concept of modern/traditional is just so nice.

**whoisValensi** (10): But does he get his peaches out in Georgia???? Anyways I just wanna take this moment to say I got a 2lbs (0.9kg) bag of peaches like a week ago and they are some of the best peaches I have ever had. Anyways I hope we all agree Jongin is the best EXO member!

**mayolizard** (9.5): it was cute but it was interesting for a title track…

**2l82bstr8** (9): he really said "cum"

**bluetriangles04** (9): While not topping Mmmh, (which, until I'm proven otherwise, will be impossible) Peaches is literally Kai's signature sound that works so well for him and makes you all fuzzy while listening. It gets the Blue stamp of approval.

**chenle** (9): so dreamy

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): kai and selena gomez prove that you dont need vocals to make good music

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): aw kai ur making me blush…

**ilyyyyy** (9): basic asf, totally into it. lo fi vibes at times. can't believe i'm liking kai's songs better than baekhyun's

**ImADudeDuh** (9): i could interpret this as sexy or uncomfortable, but i choose sexy

**Kayaking11116** (9): oh. oh my goddd. its slow but its addicting and also smexayyy

**maybecrf** (9): 🍑 its like sleep meets sex 🍑

**seanderlust** (9): you heard him - pretty girls stream Peaches by The Presidents of the USA

**sliced-peaches** (9): he wrote this song for and about me actually

**xxipil0ts** (8.7): - i blushed throughout wtf

**akanewasright** (8.5): if this man can sing, he’s hiding it pretty well… but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t like the song

**paigama** (8.5): could be a 9 if the SUMIN remix was the og version instead.

**wavingwolves** (8.4): fuckboy music but in a pastelcoded way....

**cremeebrulee** (8): ok timothee chalamet

**ebooks#5454** (8): i get my peaches up in jeju island

**Gonza\_90** (8): Ended Justin Bieber

**PSSST12** (8): uhmm umm outsold and outimpacted

**rslashpoopheads** (8): did someone say Juice

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): ended Bieber

**skargardin** (8): bop

=====

2021inKPOP: **ricki** (7.5): this is what justin bieber thought changes sounded like

**Cooler\_lin** (7.2): its like kai's response to baekhyun's candy but its u know.....not as good

**chancehugs** (7): Was getting boring but then he crooned and ooof daddy (and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like Kai).

**cherryices** (7): his onceler moment

**jasannn** (7): a huge vibe which is good or bad thing depending on the person

**milkywayinradius** (7): the choreography is really beautiful

**Qwilphish** (7): The visuals are really next level and unique, but the song is sadly just okay for me

**celladonn** (6.5): I love Kai very much but I'm going to need him to make more interesting music

**mimins** (6.5): can't listen to this song without thinking of the kai bratz doll edits but I'm not even mad about it cuz they made me like the song more

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): dreamy but kind of bland

**yatcho** (6.3): music video concept is sickening song is... uhm..

**hikkaru** (6): peaches are v delicious

**melody** (6): I'm allergic to Peaches.

**sarcasticsobs** (6): He’s done better. Enjoyed the dancing

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I hate that this just makes me wanna listen to Justin Bieber

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): what did such a top tier fruit do to have 2 mid songs made about it

**moonshxne** (5.5): lacks sex appeal

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): it's not the worst song from 2021 called "peaches" but that's not a very high bar to clear

**CrimsonROSET** (5): is this the peaches people always talk about, if so i dont see the vision

**frogaranaman** (5): Call Me By Your Name ass

**hunnybee12** (5): noo kai dont release sleepy fuckboy music ur so sexy haha

**plastichaxan** (5): the best song named peaches released last year… guess it wasn’t a good year for peaches :pensive:

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): songs named peaches have just consistently gone down in quality since the presidents of the united states of america made their song havent they

**vayyiqra** (5): I want to be nice to Kai, he seems alright, but this isn't that good. The instrumental is nice, but his vocals feel like he's struggling a bit somehow. Maybe it's not his range? idk

=====

2021inKPOP: **bulforster** (4.2): well it's not as boring as baekhyun's song at least

**2dina3dworld** (4): I get my peaches down in Georgia yeah yeah yeah

**apatel27** (4): Why's he dancing like the song isn't a snooze

**astrologicalangel** (4): no thanks

**BaconShoes** (4): a bit of a snooze idk

**bespectacIed** (4): A downgrade from his EXCELLENT, amazing, debut. Seriously check it out if you haven't. But this is kai, my number 1 kpop crush of all time, so I am not gonna give it a super low score

**bigbigbee** (4): I’m sorry for the misandry but this reminds me way way too much of the way that people talk to their discord kittens

**flavasavavandal** (4): it’s got a nice vibe but where is the elevation, the risk, it’s just content in being better than the Justin Bieber song

**orbiteezus** (4): sooooooooooo sloooooooooowwwwww please just get this song over with already

**runaway3212** (4): it's better than justin bieber i guess

**sabooyah** (4): not a bad song but he doesn't have the range to really make it pop off

**vhqv1997** (4): i just know this dude is a virgin

**Zypker125** (3.8): “Hey girl, do you wanna get some of this 🍑” “💦” “😏”

**aestheticen** (3): I got my peaches out of Korea (oh yeah shit)

**MassiveThief** (3): why do I keep hearing Travis Scott in the background

**moonagenightmares** (3): stupidass meme song fuck u sm!!!!

**BasedButta** (2): fuck you

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): How do you let yourself get outdone by Justin Bieber.

**DaBigBoi** (2): Watched a bit too much Call Me By Your Name

**IsaiahTB0** (2): Such a plain nothing of a song. Don't get the hype for Kai's solo music at all.

**metanoira** (2): all 2 points are for the aesthetics

**alwayswords** (1): yawn

**pig-serpent** (1): Are men in k-pop allowed to make songs that aren’t terrible softboy anthems?  Genuine question.

**sage** (1): peaches are bad and so is this song

---

**1998tweety** (7): I listened to this a few times the week it dropped and then never returned to it. Not a bad song, but it’s very forgettable. Oh how the mighty have fallen (but at least BTS is putting out similar if not lower quality music, so I guess this is a win?)

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): SM has been more misses than hits lately because why did they have such an anticipated comeback be as stale and uninspired as this

**throwaway-7650** (3): sehun should simply never step foot into the studio again

---

**Kadenfrost** (10): They just keep slaying they're just too powerful. Loved the bassline and laidback nature of the song

**nicolas** (10): see you in day 3 bestie

**xxipil0ts** (10): - i remember listening this for the first time and just blushing and god theyre all charming

**IsaiahTB0** (9.5): An underrated track from EXO. Rain On Me's little cousin, we love DFTF.

**sage** (9.4): thank you sehun for teaching me that theres 24 hours in a day

**paigama** (9.2): an overlooked bop. sehun shouldn't have rapped though.

**DraculaWeekend** (9): One of the weaker EXO title tracks but still good. They definitely blew the MV budget on the terrible CGI in the last scenes tho.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): 0.5 off for me actually laughing irl at sehun’s rap, another 0.5 off for bad lay cgi. i streamed this 50 times in june 2021 then never listened to it again but i can confirm it’s still a bop. i would have made it a 10 anyway if SUHO was here though </3

**omgthenerve** (9): this song is not anything new or particularly exciting, but the pure euphoria over EXO briefly coming out of hiatus to release this album was worth at least 9 points

**sliced-peaches** (9): exo r my boyfriends

**Stryxen** (9): that rap was fighting the beat … slayed tho

**vayyiqra** (9): As said elsewhere I can't get enough of funky "song of the summer" type beats. The short breakdown is pointless but otherwise it's nonstop energy.

**Zypker125** (8.7): Ayy-yo, 🆒😭 24/7, 🅱🅱 all 😏 day, 🎉🙌 gonna 😂 be, 👼👦 gonna 🤤 be 🏼🐝 okay (leggo) 느낌대로 가던 대로, shawty, 'bout to turn it up (brrah) You 👳 got that love 🤗😍 with that juice, 😛💦 follow 나에게로, whoo Baby, 👶 I can ☺💏 be 👏🐝 your healin', tell 😩💦 me, 💯💁 why you 🙌😘 fighting the 👏🕵 feeling 😩

**ricki** (8.5): To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Sehun's verse. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Sehun's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Sehun's verse in DFTF truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the phrase "24/7 all day, gotta be gotta be okay" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Oh Sehun's genius unfolds itself on their Spotify account. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Hunhan tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the gentlemen's eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 EXO scrobbles of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I’ve heard worse rap bridges. And the rest of the song slaps.

**hanpop** (8): do they ever have a bad song

**Kayaking11116** (8): doing the woah in the mv is an automatic demotion. also the rap part wasn’t great but the song is very fun and nice

**kyrgyzzephyr** (8): i can’t put my finger on it but there’s something so sm bg about this. i can easily hear suju on this or shinee at times. anyways it bops

**PSSST12** (8): This sounds so much like cant stop the feeling and Im an apologist fir that song so. .

=====

2021inKPOP: **welcome2thejam** (8): I am trying not to make the Timberlake reference but they're serving it to me on a silver platter

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): that chorus sounds dangerously close to can't stop the feeling

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): Justin Timberlake 🤝EXO - letting the feeling win

**aestheticen** (7.5): I can feel Lay's RMB earnings in his existence

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): While being incredibly underwhelming after the previous hot streak EXO was previously running on title track wise, this song is fun enough and refreshing in the regard that I can appreciate a good song where Sehun says shawty again seemingly out of nowhere after 84 years.

**hikkaru** (7.5): it's really not that bad at all. it's decent actually

**moonshxne** (7.5): a lot of fun! a mere blip in EXO’s discography, but still leagues ahead of what most m*n in pop could ever

**sarcasticsobs** (7.1): Not into the rap on this tune. They’ve obviously done better overall, but there’s a nice groove. Vocals good as always.

**bulforster** (7): that rap is heinous but I'm basic enough that the oonts oonts is all this song needs to get me on board

**Islands** (7): Sounds nothing like the groups signature sound and has some really bad raps but i can't lie it just hits

**jay duh** (7): FATHER FATHER FATHER NOT SAYING FATHER CHALLENGE FAILED INSTANTLY

**mayolizard** (7): cute but forgettable

**milkywayinradius** (7): an okay song, i mean kind of boring for EXO..

**mimins** (7): I expected more from exo especially after the perfection that was obsession but its not bad.

**MToms** (7): Is this in the Trolls movie

**orbiteezus** (7): bit of a nonevent but it was fun, although sehun’s verse was a choice. pretty obviously a throwaway song before military enlistment but its catchy enough, also i dont know why they dont make chanyeol sing more his vocals are alright

**skargardin** (7): This feels like its... almost there

**moonagenightmares** (6.8): this actually wasnt as bad as i remembered but its still so underwhelming. also i think i spotted simeez in the mv ???

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): military propaganda

**chenle** (6.7): i forgot that this existed

**Cooler\_lin** (6.5): oh exo *deep, spiritual sigh* how tf did we go from the masterpiece that is obsession to this?

**jasannn** (6.5): I would like to take this moment to say “FUCK LAY.”

**cremeebrulee** (6.1): is this not the trollz song

**2l82bstr8** (6): shawty 'bout to turn it up

**akanewasright** (6): I would Shazam this song in an H&M and never think about it again

**anothertown** (6): can't stop the feeling so just dance dance dance

**celladonn** (6): One of Exo's most generic title tracks

**LesApfels** (6): It reminds me of that SuperM Korean Air promo song

**Qwilphish** (6): I really do like EXO but this song was so nothing

**raggedy-princess** (6): very mid by exo's standards

**runaway3212** (6): this is terrible but i kinda stan the audacity of them randomly mentioning kwangya

**tiltheendoftheline** (6): they're my kings but they've done much better, this is fine I guess but it's at the bottom of their title tracks.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Oh fuck Kwangyitis has claimed another victim

**whoisValensi** (6): Speaking of the KWANGYA devil, they don't make EXO songs like they used to anymore... Anyways everyone, let's take this moment to send a congratulations to EXO for finally being able to get Yixing involved in a comeback again! Now let's hope they never do that again.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.6): idk there's just something off about it to me

**BaconShoes** (5): kinda generic idk

**cosmicneve** (5): A gift for the fans.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): don’t tell me what to do

**DaBigBoi** (5): This feels like the song Chanyeol sings to his exes thinking he’ll win them over by calling them “sweet baby girl”

**ebooks#5454** (5): why does this have the same energy as Justin Timberlake's "Can't Stop the Feeling" from the hit movie Trolls

**ernie** (5): (this song is okay but forgettable for me, it’s also their weakest title tracks in terms of longevity.)

2021inKPOP: **FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): i always forget this is released in 2021 because this sounds distinctly like it was released in 2015…

**frogaranaman** (5): did they just burp in the middle of this song

**NotWith10000Men** (5): was that the cones of dunshire???

**sabooyah** (5): average. why did it feel so short?

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): at times the bass sounds like noise cancellation malfunctioning

**chancehugs** (4): Like the production, but somehow not as impactful or memorable as EXO's previous work.

**flavasavavandal** (4): just nothing really comes together and it ends up feeling like an anti-anthem

**rslashpoopheads** (4): damn Power was already one of their worst songs why did they remake it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): wow the top gun sequel looks crazy

**2dina3dworld** (3): this sounds like kokobop except a bit better. Which doesn’t mean much because Ko Ko Bop is one of my least favourite songs ever.

**apatel27** (3): If you have a good vibe going don't ruin it with a bad rap that misuses AAVE

**BasedButta** (3): this sucks LOL the verses suck, the rap part is probably the worst I have seen in quite some time, the chorus is barely passable… but the clip is funny though. thank you kpop at least you’re funny when you’re bad

**maybecrf** (3): not the military industrial complex music

**metanoira** (3): no one moved

**bespectacIed** (2): even diehards exols had a hard time defending this lmaooo.. it's lazy, low effort, a sad showing from the fallen kings of kpawp. d.o. and baekhyun will serve vocals no matter what tho

**pig-serpent** (2): Military propaganda core

**ilyyyyy** (1): whats with the fart sounds at the beginning??? it's okay if a little generic otherwise but it's unlistenable based on that intro alone lol. first the creaking sound in tempo now this lol oh there's another unpleasant sound right before the rap verse loll (1:36)

**ImADudeDuh** (1): is this what it feels like to be one of those raters that goes “omg im so misandrist 🤪🤪🤪”

**wavingwolves** (1): imagine following obsession (pure cock music with high amounts of cunt) with this

**1998tweety** (7.5): It’s ok. Their past few releases have felt way

**throwaway-7650** (6): I was gagged at Thunderous getting an 11 but this getting **2**? That’s more than [redacted].

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): Kinda appalled that the comments are flooded with Olivia Rodrigo but there isn’t a single BEYONCÉ comment

---

**DefaultPophead** (10): This may or may not have awoken something in me.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): What an earworm. Also that rap verse had me in tears it's so good

**moonagenightmares** (9.8): this is like the only ateez song i love

**hikkaru** (9): im usually something of an ateez anti but between this, eternal sunshine, and take me home they had me a little in 2021. see what happens when they stray away from their general horrid sound...

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): i am looking respectfully o_o

**twiceoftheheart** (9): Wish I could wear/display pirate stuff without it being associated with someone else

**celladonn** (8.5): I love Ateez, this isn't quite up there with their best work but it's still a bop

**IsaiahTB0** (8.5): Surprisngly catchy song thats actually a slay?

**Kayaking11116** (8.5): i love the percussion and bass in this song,

**metanoira** (8.5): dreamcatcher outsold but this is good too

**Victerade** (8.5): gays saving music once again

**wavingwolves** (8.1): thankful about how this gave us a slight flavour of cock music because 4th gen groups need to step up when it comes to that

**anothertown** (8): ok that kind of went

**BasedButta** (8): very well done song! also lol the pants

**ernie** (8): (this is alright, not a big ateez fanatic or listener but for this being the first song [i think at least] to have listened by them this was pretty good)

**ilyyyyy** (8): it sounds very good, though a bit generic

**jay duh** (8): not saying father for 2 secs (failed)

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): [insert comment here about Olivia Rodrigo pls laugh]

**mimins** (7.5): a bit forgettable but fun

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): i like the plunky bits

**pig-serpent** (7.5): I like the summery part of the song but I wish there was more to the “all bass no anything else” parts of the song.  That said, the parts of the song I like grew on me a lot so I think this one is mostly enjoyable.

**Qwilphish** (7.5): ATEEZ usually aren't my favs but I will always respect the effort they put into their performances. That was definitely the highlight of the MV

2021inKPOP: **2l82bstr8** (7): loved the rap break and the old-school TVXQ-esque quality this has

**aestheticen** (7): San in that tight ass shirt >>>

**bespectacIed** (7): this is cute? reminds me of exo. first time hearing this bc i actively avoid this group.

**ricki** (7): had to \*\*\*\* \*\*\* and take a cold shower before rating this to make sure i was scoring the song and not the ateez members

**runaway3212** (7): copyright holders when they're listening to SOUR

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): How many comments are gonna mention “how many comments are gonna mention Olivia Rodrigo”

**paigama** (6.7): same comment as hwaa

**sarcasticsobs** (6.7): I would’ve liked something a little different for the chorus, but it’s not bad. Liked the choreo

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.5): not the best song released in 2021 called "deja vu" but it's decent

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.5): if i’m ever down half as bad as these boys please rescue me immediately

**RandomHypnotica** (6.3): livie and dreamcatcher outsold

**cremeebrulee** (6.2): dreamcatcher outsold

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I like the guy that just sounds like he’s breathing the lyrics.

**Cooler\_lin** (6): pretty catchy after a while, it feels like its missing something in the climax or just the chorus....also i keep forgetting what this song sounds like

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i already gave deja vu my 11 last time you’re out of luck

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): boys this song isn’t nearly dramatic enough for you to be wildly gesticulating and flailing around in the rain

**PSSST12** (6): Can we come up of something else?? Answer or utopia shuldve been here so they could atleasthave a fighting chance 😭

**vayyiqra** (6): This is alright! I should listen to these guys more.

**vhqv1997** (6): they will never be dreamcatcher

**Zypker125** (5.8): When it comes to K-Pop songs named “Deja Vu” that are composed by LEEZ and Ollounder and are produced for hard-hitting high-energy performance groups, Dreamcatcher has the much superior one.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.7): dreamcatcher MAJORLY outsold

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.5): omg Olivia should sue them

**Esh\_Kebab** (5.2): I love hype party ATEEZ. This is not that ATEEZ.

**ebooks#5454** (5): dreamcatcher did it better

**flavasavavandal** (5): Get me the copy of this without the 2nd verse stat

**LilacDaffodils** (5): this was the first time I had listened to this song and it's cool to see how ATEEZ has evolved as I had only ever heard their earlier stuff overall still pretty neutral on it.

**maybecrf** (5): this is filler arc content

**sabooyah** (5): meh

**skargardin** (5): this sure is an ATEEZ title

=====

2021inKPOP: **apatel27** (4): Why are acting like roadman

**chancehugs** (4): Kinda uninteresting song.

**jasannn** (4): it doesnt have a bad drop like their other songs but at least they weren’t boring

**orbiteezus** (4): honestly this is the best ateez title i’ve heard which says a lot

**welcome2thejam** (4): Oh, if that wasn't the most unfortunate year to also release a song going "I know you get Deja Vu"

**mayolizard** (3.5): this is my favorite ateez song :)

**alwayswords** (3): hongjoong in his joker bag

**BaconShoes** (3): kinda boring

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): yeah i feel like ive heard this 500 times before

**nicolas** (3): olivia rodrigo in 2021: (+1 because san is hot)

**rslashpoopheads** (3): this has very old kpop vibes

**whoisValensi** (3): Okay Olivia. Sorry I had to get that one out. Anyways please instead stream "데자-부 (Déjà-Boo)" by the legend Jonghyun featuring Zion.T who is another legend. (Side-note the way that line that goes into the chorus is delivered reminds me a lot of how the chorus starts in 2PM's "My House" and idk why lolll)

**DaBigBoi** (1): I’ll say I have deja vu when we see them out Day 1 again
[/r/popheads/comments/w5o6y5/2021_kpop_essentials_rate_reveal_day_1_its_almost/ih9w3qo/]

=====

Zypker125: Kinda funny how people were under the impression that people would use the song name to make Olivia Rodrigo puns even though I’m pretty sure way more comments instead used the song name to make Dreamcatcher puns (myself included).
[/r/popheads/comments/w5o6y5/2021_kpop_essentials_rate_reveal_day_1_its_almost/ihbcodm/]

=====

befrenchie94: It’s also kind of funny cause the people that produce for almost all of Dreamcatcher help produce almost all of Ateez including this song. And if that’s not an example of having a favorite child I don’t know what is.

**throwaway-7650** (10): This was robbed I do not care, I knew that it was most likely going to be Day 1 but this is literally a top 2 title track by them along with Not Shy (yes I’m aware of how unpopular this opinion is).

**1998tweety** (8): Hold on maybe this sub likes ITZY less than I thought??? This song is actually GOOD why did y’all pan it?? Their Latina serve!

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): You’d think a song titled Loco would be more interesting. But at least it’s not mind bogglingly annoying like the 2 title tracks that precede it

---

**ernie** (10): (i would give this a 11 if this was the english version, i usually don’t enjoy english versions of kpop songs but this and bad boy english version are just masterpieces)

**orbiteezus** (10): you kinda have to be on a higher intellectual wavelength to truly appreciate this song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's got me looking so crazy right now

**aestheticen** (9.5): I WILL NOT STAND FOR ANY HATERS FOR THIS!! Y'ALL DON'T GET IT!!

**BaconShoes** (9.5): a bop, it hits

**bluetriangles04** (9.5): CMON! the bridge breakdown part is too fucking good on this song, it was spectacular for me on first listen and even became my ringtone. While I jump now sometimes hearing this song due to the connotation, I still love it to pieces.

**maybecrf** (9.5): okay, this song is just so fun

**Qwilphish** (9.5): S.O.S. for this kitty this was great

**whoisValensi** (9.5): Not me finally getting into this song on NYE, taking a shower listening to it on repeat, and getting out of the shower to find out Betty White had died. (P.S. I'm more of a "SWIPE" guy when it comes to this album overall tho.)

**Kadenfrost** (9): have y'all seen the crazy in love remix in tiktok?????????????

**MToms** (9): This is me https://youtu.be/gcyQkIkKkPI

**PSSST12** (9): Hold on. . This grew on me after dismissing it for months lmao. Still no wannabe though.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Damn, a tale of two ITZYs in this rate, cause I super enjoyed this one!

**yatcho** (9): they're so hit and miss but when they hit they HIT

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): i know i should give this a lower score but that chorus has crack in it </3

**Victerade** (8.3): we kinda love you itzy

**ImADudeDuh** (8): they didn’t ask to be born latina

**IsaiahTB0** (8): Redeemed themselves from MIT... we praised JYP that day

**Kayaking11116** (8): addicting and the last chorus is really good, i love the breakdown of the beat at that part

**sliced-peaches** (8): their last good hit who knew

**paigama** (7.8): i thought itzy might be getting back to their rookie era music but then it started getting boring at the middle of the song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.7): i wish the whole song was just that guitar part in the bridge

**ebooks#5454** (7.5): itzy unnies i know you can do so much better

=====

2021inKPOP: **BasedButta** (7): outstanding chorus! the rest leaves much to be desired but i will be nice with the scoring :) but wtf is that furry part

**flavasavavandal** (7): the chorus is an absolute banger but that’s about it

**mayolizard** (7): i only listen to the english version for yeji’s sos for this kitty

**mimins** (7): the verses are lacking but I love the chorus

**vayyiqra** (7): This is closer to the Itzy I know and it's alright although they have much better.

**vhqv1997** (7): the final chorus saved this song, they should have just remixed this entire song to be a punk rock song with sickass guitar riffs

**sarcasticsobs** (6.9): I don’t knowwwwww I can’t call it “good,” but I really like *parts* of it. Yeji’s “오아시스 찾는 kitty” gets stuck in my head every time and every Ryujin part is good. Fun styling in the video.

**celladonn** (6.5): Decent chorus but the song isn't that memorable

**moonagenightmares** (6.3): this is kinda giving eurovison song /pos?

**wavingwolves** (6.3): first they came for the italians and then for the latinos... i see them...

**apatel27** (6): I don't understand how these multi million pound labels are unable to green screen in a way that looks even the slightest bit realistic

**coolfluffle** (6): not my style as the chorus is a little strained but fantastic mv

**DaBigBoi** (6): When they said they were getting loco, they were talking about us as a societal collective

**melody** (6): crazzzyy

**sabooyah** (6): its missing something to really make this a great song but i can't put my finger on it

**skargardin** (6): It's a massive step up from ITM at least

**thedoctordances1940** (5.7): better than quite a lot of their songs but i do not like itzy so that's not saying much

**moonshxne** (5.5): a perfectly serviceable song probably, i just don’t like their voices here

**Zypker125** (5.4): The worst K-Pop dance move of the year has to be when they’re saying “I’m going Loco” and start… waggling their butts? It’s just soooo cringey.

**2l82bstr8** (5): it's like a gay orgy (only works for the verses)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Why can nobody ever just be sane in love?

**chancehugs** (5): Wannabe was better.

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): this gets a boost from not being as awful as ITM but damn this is just... not great

**frogaranaman** (5): forming an opinion on this song is impossible for me. it's just kind of there and I have nothing for or against it

**seanderlust** (5): i heard the post-chorus as "i'm getting let go, let go" and thought ITZY was being laid off

**tiltheendoftheline** (5): I've listened to it a bunch of times and it's like it's erased from my mind the second it ends

2021inKPOP: **bulforster** (4.8): I thought I liked this but no, it's just not as bad in the morning

**Cooler\_lin** (4.7): the chorus is fun?

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.5): this is bad but i will forgive all musical crimes if yeji marries me [2]

**bespectacIed** (4): yeah their worst, i think everyone agrees. Stale, boring, grating. I think this was so badly received, knetz turned on itzy after this??

**ricki** (4): itzy going from being a remarkable girl group with a characteristic sound to releasing the literal most generic, white bread of a song is a cautionary tale that will be told for generations to come

**rotating3Dtext** (4): we have to retire the brass WOMP in kpop for at least 5 years!!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): How do you pronounce “loco” wrong??? That’s literally one of the easiest Spanish words to say!!

**CrimsonROSET** (3): do nsmpg

**hikkaru** (3): the one part that has a nice melody gives this a small boost but it's still bad

**ilyyyyy** (3): not into it

**jasannn** (3): Yeji fell off my bias ranking because of that pre-chorus.

**nicolas** (3): the straykidsfication of itzy (derogatory)

**rslashpoopheads** (2): full offense but ITZY really specialize in being annoying even their good songs are irritating

**Roxieloxie** (1.3): [2]

**2dina3dworld** (1): this is literally just In the Morning but less memorable

**fadedblue09** (1): With this I can now conclude they're just not capable of making a song I can like

**jay duh** (1): jesus h christ above please guide me through these 3 minutes

**runaway3212** (1): whoever released this was indeed crazy

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): I can’t point out why but I feel offended

**MK** (10): I mean come on. IT’S THE HOT GIRL COACH AND BTS!

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): A little ahh can’t hurt anyone!

**Dusk** (6): the actual song is ok but meg ate so it gets another point

---

**impeccabletim** (11): 👅

**Roxieloxie** (11): robbed from being in the main rate and ill never shut up about it

**2l82bstr8** (10): thank you hosts this is what I was waiting for now it's a 10

**DirtyRat583** (10): megan carries this

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this is just an easygoing bop, Megan thee Stallion’s energy makes it even more of a 10. Butter vs. Permission to Dance shows how pure pop can either be so uplifting or so irritating, depending how forced the execution is

**seanderlust** (10): i love the interplay between megan and the boys! i actually wasn't sold on butter as a song until i heard this

**DefaultPophead** (8): i support you babes ✅

**metanoira** (8): smooth like cocoa butter take the whole song

**vayyiqra** (8): Somehow I went all this time without hearing any version of "Butter" until this rate so this one is new to me too, but I like Megan and I woke up with "Butter" in my head yesterday so it must be doing something right.

**SkylarV** (7): The song is still good, but it's definitely worse than the original. Did someone want this remix? Anyone? modCheck (also how dare you include this song in the secret rate when the original (better version) is in the rate proper!)

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Meg… you tried… thank you for your service

**Zypker125** (6.9): I'm not familiar with Megan's work, but she doesn't fit in this song at ALL. Halsey made Boy With Luv significantly better while Megan made Butter significantly worse.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): the gag when this gets an average thats a full 2+ points higher than the original even though theyre literally the same song

**chancehugs** (6): I feel like Megan outrapped the boys, and yet her verse didn't really fit into the song?

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.5): Megan put the butt in butter

**flavasavavandal** (5): the problem with Butter is not that it didn't have Megan Thee Stallion on it, the problem with Butter was that it was a charmless little slice of retro-pop that never felt

**rotating3Dtext** (4): I love Megan but eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee no

**melody** (3): 1 more point because Megan

**exciting\_patient4872** (2): There are four numbers in my username, and I assigned one to each song in the bonus rate. It's law.

**HoshiLock** (2): I dont like remixes and collaborations like this one it spoils the song

**sage** (1.7): raised a bit just because megan is here

**thedoctordances1940** (0): megan doesn't really add anything and her feature feels really out of place. this isn't really a 0 for me but i just wanted to use it and this is my least favourite

**1998tweety** (8): This song is meh 90% of the time you listen to it, but when you’re in the mood for it it hits HARD.

**throwaway-7650** (7.8): Like many others, I was concerned that this would do better than Drunk-Dazed (it did hit the top 10 twice) but thankfully it ended up settling around #40 and eventually slid into Day 1, which I’m not upset about!

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): This is definitely a song with a beat, yes.

---

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Damn this is smooth

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): why are they acting like theater kids for the first 1.5 mins of the mv…

**ilyyyyy** (10): super good they absolutely killed it last year

**jay duh** (10): ignores choreo YASSSSSS SLAY

**mayolizard** (10): omg so i was driving and looping and a cop was following me for like 20 minutes i was traumatized mawma anyways anytime i listen to enhypen in the car something traumatic happens

**moonagenightmares** (10): this wouldve been my undisputable 11 if it was by a group with proper sangers

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): yup yup this SMASH HIT…not everyone can say they have a song as good as this in their discography

**Qwilphish** (10): Honestly 4th gen boy groups for the most part really do nothing for me, but this song is truly top tier and needs to be given its flowers

**vuemaurel** (10): Fever, fever, fever!!!

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): I feel like they're going in a different direction from everyone else and the result is slick, alluring and energetic every time

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): releasing a song called fever in 2021… a bold choice

**ebooks#5454** (9): bestie you don't need her you need some ibruprophen

**Kayaking11116** (9): i love how smooth it is

**PSSST12** (9): Their best track i think. So groovy and it actually flows well.

**runaway3212** (9): now why did the fever i had during covid not slap like this

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Ok so I think I like ENHYPEN

**poemforsmallthings** (8.5): this song is good and all but it started this trend of their b-sides becoming more popular than the title tracks and I'm still mad about it because Drunk-Dazed is better

**ricki** (8.5): never ask a man his salary, a woman her age, and enhypen how old they were when they recorded this

**bespectacIed** (8): HOT. i think the only enha song i know and like

**bluetriangles04** (8): Fever is good, great even! Is it better than Drunk-Dazed? Not for me at least...

**chenle** (8): will never forgive this song for overshadowing drunk-dazed... could they not have released it on literally any other album

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): sultry!

**milkywayinradius** (8): groovy PSA on what symptoms of covid to look out for

**skargardin** (8): Fever sure has got me good

**paigama** (7.5): slow songs aren't for non-vocal groups but this one is kinda good

**sarcasticsobs** (7.3): They’re good dancers but this song is a step down for me, though the chorus is nice

**seanderlust** (7.2): after covid, i'm gonna need a moratorium on songs called fever that feature heavy breathing

=====

2021inKPOP: **aestheticen** (7): I don't get how this became more popular than Drunk-Dazed

**BaconShoes** (7): i was feeling the fever a bit, but just a mild fever, nothing crazy

**melody** (7): this

**NotWith10000Men** (7): i like what i'm hearing from this group, will need to check them out more

**rslashpoopheads** (7): low key banger

**vayyiqra** (7): This felt mid at first but it has quite a nice vibe if you can get into it.

**Victerade** (6.5): thanks to how bad it is i actually got a fever

**Zypker125** (6.1): Enhypen’s songs are “Let’s make our songs as sexy/sensual/adult as possible without making it too obvious such that people call us out for it, since we have 15-17 year olds in the group and we’ll get called out if we’re too obvious”. Oh well, at least the song is kinda catchy.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this is one of those when it’s over i just got absolutely no thoughts mind empty i swear i heard it like 6 times

**tiltheendoftheline** (6): at this point I don't know if I can judge this fairly as they had these lyrics with a 15 year old on the group... It just makes me uncomfortable.

**BasedButta** (5.5): i can see how well done it is but i don’t care abt it! hell yeah!

**apatel27** (5): idk ENHYPEN lore someone explain why they were attacked by an unclean wardrobe

**celladonn** (5): It creates a mood but it's just not very interesting

**orbiteezus** (5): i hate to say it but i don’t understand the hype behind this, its not like actively bad but like, its just there

**plastichaxan** (5): they ran out of slay juice after Drunk-Dazed they used it all there

**sabooyah** (5): average

**Cooler\_lin** (4.3): does not stand out at all...

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Feeling very lukewarm on this one.

**chancehugs** (4): Doesn't feel like this song is going anywhere.

**flavasavavandal** (4): most inessential song in the rate

**Islands** (4): Does not work at all with the weird hybe vocal production in the way drunk dazed does

**mimins** (4): I like this song less than drunk dazed but I think it suits their vocals more

**hikkaru** (3): it's giving me a fever for sure

**IsaiahTB0** (3): Don't get the hype for this at all. The vocals are so processed it sounds like a bag of hot cheetos.

**maybecrf** (3): i dont know who this is for, who is listening to this

**pig-serpent** (3): I got a fever, and the only prescription is interesting music.  Enhypen want me to die.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): hello? the music video?? i knew kpop lore was insane but what the actual fuck is going on here

**whoisValensi** (3): This song has unlocked the power to put me to sleep. It's a fine song, I guess. But also like ehhhhhhh after "Drunk-Dazed" idk if I was ready for smth slow. Good on them for being dynamic, maybe. (Watch this be their only song that couldn't be described as "BG Noise Music"...) But idk this is just kinda boring me.

**wavingwolves** (2.2): this song being loved for reasons i can't comprehend and i'm happy it's the case

**moonshxne** (2): Unlike Drunk-Dazed, the terrible, terrible vocal production that strips everyone of any personality is far more detrimental to this sort of song.

**DaBigBoi** (1.5): So dull

**ImADudeDuh** (1): @ 1:22 same.

**sage** (1): literally why did this get more popular than drunk slayzed its so horrible

**Tazzachar** (1): pretty boring

"Def not excellence"
TO YOU lol

"...isnt a good way to make music"
Do you make music? Tell me what is a good way to make music? And either way, idgaf how they make it as long as the end product hits, and it hit (for next level in particular, imo) 🤷🏽‍♀️

"when nearly every other sm artist tanked...."
girl, kai & baekhyun were not pots and pans and throwing random shit in a song. Taeyeon and all of shinee still up on the list (edit: AND red velvet!). NCT is out and tbh i think universe deserved better. But what even is your argument here other than that you just dont like aespa's music, its okay to just say that instead of all this nonsense lol

**throwaway-7650** (10): The last song of Day 1, I was rooting for this to make Day 2 but can’t be too mad about this. The rap section alone probably cost her at least 10 spots, not to mention the additional dance break section in the MV. I still do think this was one of the most robbed songs from today though, which you can tell from my score. Also I did not expect Bicycle to pick up any 11s but it got multiple! Happy that there are a few shooters for this song.

**1998tweety** (9): Robbed queen, she did not serve so hard just for y’all to send her home end of day 1. Oh well, hopefully Bicycle will get it’s redemption in the Female K-pop Soloists rate.

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): Bicycles do not make that sound.

---

**BaconShoes** (11): this whole album is excellent and this is such a banger

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): the song Side to Side wishes it was

**sliced-peaches** (11): yes i do like how she rides it actually and ill be her transportation any time she needs

**2dina3dworld** (10): I can’t ride a bike, can’t relate to this

**anothertown** (10): serve slay boots!!!!!

**bluetriangles04** (10): #LETCHUNGHASAYFUCK [mission successfully fulfilled by her recent comeback!!!]

**chenle** (10): i was fucking obsessed with this song and was so disappointed that the only thing many kpop fans had so say about it is that it didn't fit chungha's vibe or that it sounded like an ariana grande song???

**DraculaWeekend** (10): broom broom broom broom

**frogaranaman** (10): DICK BICYCLE???

**mayolizard** (10): god this was such a munch

**milkywayinradius** (10): she is so charismatic how can she even with these looks. damn she's literally flying

**pig-serpent** (10): Not to get all parasocial and stuff but I think I'm in love.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): this was always a ten and i'll stand by that

**vayyiqra** (10): Idk I've been listening to this album a lot lately and after over 30 listens I'm beginning to think this song is not in fact about riding a bicycle. No really I am a big fan of this album; it's mixed at times but this was one of the best songs on it.

**plastichaxan** (9.5): is this k-pop's vroom vroom?

**yatcho** (9.1): shes a server she likes to serve

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): avant garde masterpiece idc! that "you like it when i ride it" hook legendary and relatable

**Cooler\_lin** (9): banger! i am sorry it took me so long to see your vision queen

**ilyyyyy** (9): ugh so good except for a couple of lines in the rap section >:(( like i love her delivery just wish the lyrics were better. btw it's the lead single for my favorite kpop album released last year <3

**IsaiahTB0** (9): You like it how I ride it? Purr'd

**whoisValensi** (9): Alright let me get something out of the way... Depending on what day you ask me, either "X" or "Dream of You" is the best single from this album. Second off, GET OUT OF MY WAY-AH! Anyways, thank you Dallas Chungha for giving us a song about riding dick. Even if I never want you to attempt rapping again cause yeah...

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): why do I love this vroom vroom ring ring let’s ride

2021inKPOP: **thedoctordances1940** (8.7): just a banger innit

**celladonn** (8.5): She's so charismatic and sells this so well

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): queen still has the better song about riding bicycles

**paigama** (8.2): every song on Querencia is at least a 9 but I get that Bicycle is the only song that had a chance of making it here. Still, I like Bicycle enough for an >8 rating.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): usually i dislike songs like these but this one goes off

**bespectacIed** (8): Chungha's album was soooo experimental and fun and ahead of its peers

**cherryices** (8): need to play simpsons hit & run now

**flavasavavandal** (8): it’s like a complete mess but it slays

**Kayaking11116** (8): it amazing but i dont really like the bridge that much

**moonshxne** (8): this works only because Queen Chungha SLAYED

**MToms** (8): Jennie vibes

**nootnoot781** (7.5): dicc bicycle (5?)

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): hot take this isn't bad meaning bad but bad meaning good you know?

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): charlie xcx got a bike

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): cyclists on the road:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): They want to ride their bicycle they want to ride their bike. More power to them!

**coolfluffle** (7): love some parts of this song

**hikkaru** (7): add me to the dicc bicycle comment section

**melody** (7): making me feel a certain way

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): the way querencia took so long to come out, and inevitably did not live up to the hype, that i feel like i hear nothing about chungha nowadays sob…but this is a bop!

**runaway3212** (7): as a dutch person i am legally required to give every song mentioning a bicycle at least a 7

**DirtyRat583** (6.5): these background synths are giving windows vista

**Qwilphish** (6.5): I think that the pre-release singles were so much stronger that this song killed the vibe before listening to the whole album for me, so I have a bad taste of this song

**Zypker125** (6.2): I'm 🙋🌷 getting 😡 higher You're 😂 tripping lower And 💃 when 😂 I 🚫 say it's 👊 done, 💦 it's 👀👏 freaking 😱🙀 over 😏👏 And 🤜🥒 I ride ♿ it, 🕤🙄 I ride 🍆 it 💯 You 🤖👍 like 😏😄 it when 👻🍑 I ride it, 👉😩 I 👀💰 ride ♿ it, 😰 I ℹ👏 ride it

2021inKPOP: **CrimsonROSET** (6): most iconic first three seconds but it kinda gets annoying fast

**maybecrf** (6): i expect more from her tbh, but it isnt bad

**moonagenightmares** (5.5): i like kpop precisely because i dont want to understand pop music lyrics

**aestheticen** (5): The most song ever

**Kadenfrost** (5): This is what I believe k-poppies meant when they say k-pop is noise music

**LesApfels** (5): It's no roller coaster

**LilacDaffodils** (5): It's no Stay Tonight but i'm not sure i could outright dislike a Chungha song.

**PSSST12** (5): Release another slay tonight girl. Because what is this genericness 😭

**skargardin** (5): Get out of my way!

**tiltheendoftheline** (5): it's disappointing because she has released some excellent stuff before.

**cremeebrulee** (4.3): u will never be dicc bicycle

**BasedButta** (4): anyway listen to killing me by chung ha the best kpop song last year! I refuse to comment on this one. (it sucks!)

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): the querencia pre-releases were so good… imagine my face crack when this dropped. if this song was the official anthem for bicycles i’d be a proud car endorser.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): the rest of her album is better than this tbh

**mrach** (4): don't let you can't sit with us distract you from the actual worst rap section of the year

**orbiteezus** (4): outside of the distorted guitar that keeps ominously popping up every 10 seconds i dislike this instrumental a lot, not to mention that one verse

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Sis… no

**vhqv1997** (4): i have never heard a song in such a hurry to just end

**bigbigbee** (3.5): says “frickin” like I’m the kid who’s obsessed with board games and isn’t allowed to swear because of overprotective parents

**ebooks#5454** (3): this song broke my computer...literally, like i had to restart everything

**sabooyah** (3): literally every single one of her prerelease tracks for this album were better than this one. I think this track would have been better for a group, she doesn't really pull it off by herself.

**DaBigBoi** (2.5): Fantastic pre-chorus ruined by a sluggish chorus and “rap” along with annoyingly squeaky moments

**seanderlust** (2.5): is she saying her bike goes like vroom vroom? it's giving "she blows my dick like a cello"

**chancehugs** (2): Stay Tonight, Play, X and Dream of You were such a string of hits so I'm not sure what happened, but this fell so flat. Honey, we all know you're not actually singing about a bicycle.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): why did this remind me of both LISA and Karol G byeeee

**jay duh** (1): this entire song is her talking about riding dick but she wont say fuck

**sarcasticsobs** (1): Chungha, sweetie, why?

**wavingwolves** (1): chungha you'll never be latina x

* Advice - Taemin
* Rock with You - Seventeen 
* The Feels - Twice
* Next Level - Aespa
* ASAP - StayC 
* Bad Love - Key 
* Love So Sweet - Cherry Bullet 
* Tail - Sunmi (? the only one I’m not certain on)

pig-serpent: I love when a day 1 is going super smoothly, only being songs that were obviously going out or songs that deserved to go out, then ends by assassinating one of the best songs in the rate just to remind you that nothing is sacred here.

=====

vivianlight: I have always said that Scientist (Twice) is **nowhere** as bad as all kpoppers were saying, it's very chill and groovy. I expect it to be out soon in Day2 but at least it got a bit of justice compared to other overhyped and overexcused abominations lol.

I expected PTT (Loona) to be out so no surprise, I still like it though... even if I like more a lot of the remaining songs so it's ok. 

I am lowkey surprised that Everglow are represented by Pirate instead of First and that Dreamcatcher are represented by BEcause instead of Odd Eye but... I like all four of these songs so I only hope you all will have taste.

We Go by Fromis_9 deserves top10 *at least*. After We Ride by Brave Girls also deserves a lot.

tiltheendoftheline: I'm kinda shocked people didn't like Bambi much tbh. Though it makes me wish someone does a b-sides rate in the future, as many times the title track isn't the best song on the album.
