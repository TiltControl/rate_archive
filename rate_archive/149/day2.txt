Welcome to the Day 2 of the 2021 K-Pop Essentials Rate Reveal! Us [3 hosts](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/626601739835015181/919242933650223165/ezgif-1-bce8bcb0cc89.gif) ([u/1998tweety](https://www.reddit.com/u/1998tweety), [u/OliviaGodrigo](https://www.reddit.com/u/OliviaGodrigo), & [u/throwaway-7650](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway-7650)) are super excited to watch everyone overreact to certain placements and robberies for the second day in a row. Raters will be too stunned to speak. We will be revealing from **#44-23** today!

Day 2 will begin at **6 p.m. EST**, about an hour from when this post goes up. You can follow along the reveal right in this thread, as everyone's scores will be posted as songs go out, or follow the reveal live in the [**Queup room**](https://www.queup.net/join/popheads-safe-space), featuring custom shitposts and very yass & slay interludes ([pubby.club](https://pubby.club/~/ripplugdj) will be the backup option if there are any issues with Queup)!

**throwaway-7650** (9.3): First of all, apologies for my lack of comments for today. Hopefully I‚Äôll be able to come back and edit them before the reveal tomorrow. With that out of the way, yet another boy group is eliminated, the first song out today. Although I‚Äôd have this song higher in Day 2, I‚Äôm just happy this isn‚Äôt Day 1. It also got an 11! [well hello let‚Äôs celebrate that Oprah gif]

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): Cured my depression, thank you ONF

**1998tweety** (7): Very surprised to see this make day 2. It‚Äôs def a cute song but compared to the other boy group songs here I would‚Äôve placed it lower. The chorus BOPS but whew that rap is kind of atrocious huh.

---

**apatel27** (11): Pure joy in a song

**cosmicneve** (11): It is just fun pure pop. No gimmicks, no obnoxious rap verses, no terrible breakdown - just a fully fleshed chorus and a melody which propels the song to its highest peaks, even the acapella breakdown is actually cool.

**agentofscranton** (10): that acapella section is one of the best 10 seconds of music in 2021

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The boys can have a little slayage‚Ä¶as a treat.

**celladonn** (10): 2021 was truly ONF's year, they released a ton of music and it was all quality, with this being a particular highlight. Pop perfection.

**DaBigBoi** (10): Such an underrated boy group with an amazing discography

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): kwangya found dead in a ditch after this mv

**hikkaru** (10): BRIGHT BG TRACKS!!!!

**jay duh** (10): i miss u.. deeply..

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): serving then and serving now! just in a different way

**PSSST12** (10): well hellooooo what a banger! A good introduction for someone who havent listened to them before this rate.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): this would be a 10 without the glee-esque rum pa rum pum pum pum pum's

**wavingwolves** (9.1): this is euphoric and good and catchy and delightful!

**aestheticen** (9): Gotta love the hosts for payola-ing this song with 2m streams in this rate. This song deserves it anyway and you guys better not let me down!!!!

**flavasavavandal** (9): i just kinda love the random acapella bit

**runaway3212** (9): this is randomly so good?

**skargardin** (9): wait this smash

**Victerade** (9): MY WAR BALDIES

**IsaiahTB0** (8.9): They deserve more hype. Go stream The Realist.

**bulforster** (8.7): YES(UL), YES(UL), YES(UL)!!

**2l82bstr8** (8): a little repetitive but it works and I LOVE the acapella break

**ebooks#5454** (8): tron legacy meets subway surfers

**frogaranaman** (8): camp

**pig-serpent** (8): I have no gift to bring Brrram Îπ†Î∞§ Îπ†Î∞§ Îπ∞Îπ∞  That‚Äôs fit to give a king Brrram Îπ†Î∞§ Îπ†Î∞§ Îπ∞Îπ∞ Brrram Îπ†Î∞§ Îπ†Î∞§ Îπ∞Îπ∞ Îπ∞Îπ†Î∞§Îπ†Î∞§ Îπ∞

**vayyiqra** (8): No thoughts but this is a jam

**anothertown** (7.5): rating his setup at 1:31-1:32 of the mv - the rgb keyboard is ok but not sure why he doesn't just have a 100% keyboard with the number pad because he has a lot of desk space and he probably needs the numpad for whatever the hell he is doing. it would save him some wrist strain. i do like that the kb and mouse are wired, wireless peripherals seem cool but just suck to use for any prolonged period of time. lastly, the side laptop sucks; since he already has 4 primary screens i don't think he's using it for another screen, so probably for more processing power? if so then just upgrade the computer or hook the laptop up to a monitor. very average setup 7/10

**BasedButta** (7.5): it has the energy and i love it but it‚Äôs kinda missing something? also when the robots started dancing i kinda lost my shit lol

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This song being after Dun Dun Dance is funny cause it just sounds like it ripped off the other song

**ricki** (7.5): genuinely took a point off because i hate the "beautiful" at the very end of the song so much

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.1): this is like the kpop version of juice

**CrimsonROSET** (7): it was cute but then they kept going with the acapella

**Kayaking11116** (7): super happy and fun, i like the vibes

**whoisValensi** (7): I was hoping for "Ugly Dance" myself but fine. This is cute. Wait, is that... A CAPELLA?!?!?!?!?! *And the most unexpected moment in a K-Pop song goes to...* Seriously was that just fucking A CAPELLA!??!?!? I cannot believe my ears. I'm sorry to derail my own comment like this but like that took me so off guard holy shit.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): I still don‚Äôt think the cyberpunk aesthetic matches the sunny feeling of the song but ok

**maybecrf** (6): forgettable

**mimins** (6): the chorus was lackluster but the rest of the song is nice and the colors in the mv are pretty

**rslashpoopheads** (6): rum pum pum puming like a good Christian and MeU

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is giving me ‚ÄúPopular‚Äù vibes

**akanewasright** (5.7): yeah this is cute

**mayolizard** (5.5): maybe i just hate fun

**sarcasticsobs** (5.5): This jump-scared me

**Zypker125** (5.4): This MV fucking slaps, colorful cyberpunk settings are an absolute FEAST on the eyes. Oh right, we‚Äôre supposed to be rating the song, uhhhhhhhh

**ilyyyyy** (5): i'd like it a little more w/ a lot less rampampam. at least they're feeling themselves

**sabooyah** (5): average

**thisusernameisntlong** (4.5): eurovision energy (derogatory)

**alwayswords** (4): dalton academy warblers type beat

**chancehugs** (4): The Rumpumpum hook is like the only memorable thing about this song.

**DraculaWeekend** (4): The fact that I enjoyed Sticker more than this‚Ä¶

**fadedblue09** (4): why is the album cover a screenshot of the jewel case

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): if ugly dance was here instead this would be a 10

**orbiteezus** (4): i‚Äôve listened to this song like 3 times and every time i listen it gets just a bit more annoying like ‚Äòi‚Äôm beautifuullll‚Äô shut the fuck up

**Cooler\_lin** (3.4): i forgot what this song sounds like so when i clicked on it again to re-listen I instantly remembered how bothered I was when I first heard

**NotWith10000Men** (3): not feeling it at all

**Stryxen** (3): ‚Ä¶?

**BaconShoes** (2): this wasn‚Äôt giving i‚Äôm sorry

**vhqv1997** (2): this is the saddest chorus i have ever heard this year

**1998tweety** (8): It‚Äôs an 8 but tbh that‚Äôs kind of weak for Taemin. Now if Idea was in the rate..I think it would‚Äôve AT LEAST been a day 3 song. He did serve in the video though I will give him that, but tbf when does he not. Key stomping all over Taemin this rate was a bit of a gag (albeit deserved).

**OliviaGodrigo** (2): This has got to be the most annoying way to sing a song.

---

**DefaultPophead** (11): try me, bitch

**DraculaWeekend** (11): He served looks, choreo, and vocals, what more do you need?

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): yass TAEMIN is here, this isn't his best song (criminal my beloved) but it slays nonetheless

**jay duh** (10): taemin has songs

**Kadenfrost** (10): I'm actually shaking at how good this song is LMFAO

**Kayaking11116** (10): i literally have nothing to say, its just good. i dont know how to coherently express how or why

**mimins** (10): BEST TAKE MY OWN ADVICE

**omgthenerve** (10): Taemin was crazy for this, his enlistment has left such a huge hole in the Kpop industry

**PSSST12** (10): His best single me thinks.

**Qwilphish** (10): SM told Taemin he had 1 song left before he had to enlist, and he made sure that he was not going to go out on a flop. Taemin has had a couple of magnus opus's but even amongst those this song is a standout. I love the piano and the drama, it really adds to his performing style

**tiltheendoftheline** (10): the rap singing had to grown on me, but when it did... Amazing send off, king!

**LilacDaffodils** (9.9): Have you seen the MV though...the song is also amazing

**celladonn** (9.5): King! That piano loop is mesmerizing

**Cooler\_lin** (9.5): he put his pussy all out on the internet right before enlistment, king!

**vuemaurel** (9.5): It's Taemin, any score below 9 is sacrilegious!

**cherryices** (9.4): this was hair inspo for like a year‚Ä¶ now i‚Äôm all about sinb‚Äôs extensions

**seanderlust** (9.1): i really like the chipmunk voice and piano

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): he refuses to miss

**moonagenightmares** (9): this grew on me even more when i found out taemin apparently found the demo intended for a female singer while combing through sm‚Äôs archives. also simeez is in this mv too <3

**pig-serpent** (9): It doesn‚Äôt sound like it should be special, but it‚Äôs cohesive, energetic, and has some nice piano work, so in the realm of kpop it‚Äôs actually very special.

**sabooyah** (9): UNDERRATED the piano riff ? Hello ?

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): The vice grip this man has on me. The *dancing*

**yatcho** (8.7): yassified Jared Leto in Morbius really ate this

**Victerade** (8.5): so good

**IsaiahTB0** (8.4): Love the MV and the lyrics about Taemin being himself in an industry thats against male femininity. WE MISS YOU TAEMIN.

**apatel27** (8): Chipmunk vocals are decent

**BasedButta** (8): some weird parts on the verses but overall really solid keyboard based melody. fan mode on: OMG HE‚ÄôS SO <3<3<3

**bluetriangles04** (8): me, an empath, sensing he is upset about not taking his own advice

**poemforsmallthings** (8): this had to grow on me because it was no WANT but when it did...

**runaway3212** (8): okay i know i hated on the atlantis chorus but it's kinda hitting here

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i dont know what the fuck was going on with the vocals in this one but i kinda liked it??

**vhqv1997** (8): does anybody know why taemins is covered in cum at the end of the video?

**whoisValensi** (8): Taemin you had one job, give us one giant banger to go out on before enlistment and you barely passed. I mean don't get me wrong this song is pretty damn good, great even, but man it does not hit as much as "final comeback before enlistment from the man who made "WANT" or "MOVE"" should have. Anyways, maybe I just have no taste considering my favorite song from this mini was "Strings". I will say tho, I want that fucking blue & red plaid outfit from the video! Also that black and white suit... Okay maybe the best thing going for this entire era was the outfits...

**2l82bstr8** (7.5): idk how well he seels me this concept tbh

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.3): taemin is someone i want to love more than i do because the concept is there but the music doesnt quite hit for me

**NotWith10000Men** (7.1): the piano adds a nice touch

**2dina3dworld** (7): I feel like this would have benefited from being more of a slow, sultry bop,,, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying that

**hikkaru** (7): going from soty (criminal) to this was quite the downgrade but i'll always be happy to hear taemin's voice...

**rslashpoopheads** (7): lowkey a banger

**moonshxne** (6.9): nothing sounds *bad* (heck, the production with the piano and even the weird high-pitched effects sounds very, uh, artistic and well-done) but...i don‚Äôt like it/mainstream trap pop in general?

**aestheticen** (6.5): Alvin and the Chipmunk-core

**bespectacIed** (6): this was a miss sorry, his first non-slay. but it's fine cuz it's taemin

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Chipmunk vocals continue to have a pretty low success rate.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): Taemin I love you, but this is not it and your voice sounds not great

**ilyyyyy** (6): liked the piano. don't like the high pitched, distorted vocals

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Why does he sing like he has the hiccups

**wavingwolves** (5.5): i advise taemin to do a less boring song next

**RandomHypnotica** (5.2): im so confused I don't know if I dislike this or don't care at all about it

**Zypker125** (5.1): Putting a classical piano into the instrumental does not automatically make a good song.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): oh that falsetto is unfortunate

**ricki** (5): [half naked boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcEyUNeZqmY) will get 10k likes, but how many likes can [our troops](https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15192809/taemin-8-1.jpeg) get?

**skargardin** (5): I'm not sure what this song is going for and it just doesn't work

**vayyiqra** (5): I feel bad saying this but I feel like the high register in the chorus isn't quite working and also there's the weird grammar ("give you one advice", even though this is a common mistake among non-native speakers). Idk I'm nitpicking but this isn't doing much for me.

**akanewasright** (4): taemin‚Ä¶ look at me‚Ä¶ this isn‚Äôt you

**BaconShoes** (4): not amazing

**ebooks#5454** (4): ok but what's his advice???

**orbiteezus** (3.5): he sounds so weird on this, the beat is ass too

**chancehugs** (3): Not a fan of that chipmunk chorus.

**maybecrf** (3): i just dont like it

**bulforster** (2.4): why are the chorus vocals so screechy??

**mayolizard** (2): no thanks

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): girl i forgot how much i disliked this song

**flavasavavandal** (1): my advice is to ditch the chipmunk vocals and possibly anything in your upper register

**Roxieloxie** (1): he sounds like brendon urie here

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): misandry

**bigbigbee** (0): oh dear this was promising until the chorus

**DaBigBoi** (0): Add a vice

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): The song is good but once I looked at the album cover, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it. It‚Äôs so üçíüçéüçêüçå

**1998tweety** (8.5): Summer bop, pop perfection. I don‚Äôt go to the beach but if I did, this would 100% be in my playlist. I‚Äôd love to hear this live at the beach; I‚Äôd love to be at the beach with ASTRO as they sing this song live to me while in their swimsuits. Anyways, this was a cute day 2, maybe would‚Äôve liked it to get a spot or 2 higher.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): i love this lol, so retro, so wholesome, a boy group that is not noisy and unplayable. Sidenote, every astro video i've seen is an advertisement for Moonbin being the hottest member, not eunwoo

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): oh they hit the slay button here

**ignitethephoenix** (10): okay I zoned out for a second but I thought this song was 1 minute long and was sad when it ended? Cause I was enjoying it but nah it‚Äôs actually 3 minutes long

**ilyyyyy** (10): a damn good song. going straight into my main playlist

**ImADudeDuh** (10): why was this such a fucking bop

**seanderlust** (10): this feels smooth and celebratory! it makes me want to drink champagne under moonlight

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): This is such a fun, catchy melody but there‚Äôs something in the production and/or mixing holding it back just a little bit to keep it from being a 10.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): Dynamite if it was actually sexy

**2l82bstr8** (9): this sounds like a nu-disco version of Fox by BoA, which means it's adorable and I love it (and the styling is incredible they all look amazing)

**ebooks#5454** (9): this is just fan service for me

**ernie** (9): (i'm not a huge astro stan but i really loved this one i'm intrigued)

**Kadenfrost** (9): Moon Bin my beloved he slayed.

**Qwilphish** (9): A great summer song, light ASTRO is definitely my favorite

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Eventually this pseudo-disco-pseudo-funk sound every pop star is trying to do will get old. Eventually it will happen. Not yet though.

**aestheticen** (8.5): Generic synthpop, so you know what I do with it! I eat it up!

**bulforster** (8.5): we love mkyola!!

**jasannn** (8.5): something Eunwoo hot something

**akanewasright** (8): i think the way to make me really like one of the nu-disco singles is to simply include some funky guitar

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): yeah it's fun

**DaBigBoi** (8): Reminder that Jinjin & Rocky released bg mini of the year

**flavasavavandal** (8): these boys are so wholesome I can‚Äôt be convinced they‚Äôve stayed up past midnight

**hikkaru** (8): mkyola

**Kayaking11116** (8): omg i love songs like this, and this is no exception

**MToms** (8): This sounds like Dynamite.

**PSSST12** (8): They did something here I fear

**sliced-peaches** (8): so good just fun boys making fun music

**vayyiqra** (8): Don't know these guys but this is cool. Is there a trend for funk-influenced songs in Kpop right now? There are a lot of them in this rate.

**vhqv1997** (8): bonus points for when they kept shouting "won't you come" at the end of the song it was very confusing and very funny

**paigama** (7.5): cute and fun but not good enough for an 8 but I'd listen to it more than the flat 7s

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): I know nothing about ASTRO but this is cute

**Tazzachar** (7.5): cute, but it‚Äôs very mid tier summer concept

**alwayswords** (7): what bts thought they were doing when they released permission to dance

**bluetriangles04** (7): After Midnight is the kind of inoffensive pop banger that you won't find me complaining about it. It's a fun little song that, while obviously chasing the retro train that has been non-stop choo-chooing in K-Pop as of lately, is able to stand on its own. If you haven't heard My Zone from this mini album, I would seriously recommend it to the 1 person probably reading this comment lmfao.

**coolfluffle** (7): astro always deliver

**cremeebrulee** (7): i‚Äôm too old for that can we meet up at like 7pm

**CrimsonROSET** (7): me when someone asks when i feed my gremlins

**IsaiahTB0** (7): Decent track, nothing special tho.

**LesApfels** (7): The way this builds is so satisfying

**maybecrf** (7): solid, didn't reinvent the wheel, but solid

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): its kinda fruity tbh (complimentary)

**sarcasticsobs** (6.7): Enjoyable-enough groove, fun bass guitar

**celladonn** (6.5): Bright and cheerful boy group song rights but this is pretty generic

**mimins** (6.5): it's a funky song, great for summer but it didn't stand out to me

**Zypker125** (6.3): Astro‚Äôs choreography always pops off

**apatel27** (6): Why does the rap sound like Jack Harlow

**BaconShoes** (6): kind of bopping but not super exciting

**jay duh** (6): dynamite gate

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): they did eunwoo dirty with this hair omg

**starla\_** (6): this is okay

**Stryxen** (6): someone on this is trying to start a fight with the beat but i danced

**Victerade** (6): didnt like, after never if possible pls

**orbiteezus** (5.5): this song isn‚Äôt really bad but i hope fantagio music burns in hell because yeah yeah i know they‚Äôre popular or whatever but its just crazy how they get to release mediocre songs like 3 times a year while weki meki barely gets any music

**sabooyah** (5.5): slightly above average. love the bass

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): i forgot this even dropped i‚Äôm so sorry my astro meow meows :sob:

**skargardin** (5): well

**SkylarV** (5): ASTRO's better title from 2021 was ONE

**wavingwolves** (5): here's how we can still rate dynamite

**Cooler\_lin** (4.9): it must really suck to be the song right after savage, it sounds so boring in comparison

**Esh\_Kebab** (4.5): Super generic.

**whoisValensi** (4.5): Trying to resist the urge to skip this because that would throw out my ballot... God I'm so bad with boy groups anymore... I will say this is defo a post-"Dynamite" song, take that as you will. At least the ASTRO guys seem to be having fun with this song, I will give them that.

**chancehugs** (4): Groovy but also kinda mellow? Can't really see myself jamming to this.

**melody** (4): sorry you disband.

**pig-serpent** (4): How did they manage to take nu disco and make it even less edgy?  If you want your song to stick in my brain it has to cut it a little, but this song is as sharp as a pillow.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): whatever Pitchfork said about the new Drake album that's how I feel about this

**runaway3212** (4): did they record this after midnight?

**BasedButta** (3): The most nothing song ever released. Seriously impressive.

**nicolas** (3): why are you as a man sitting with one leg above the other on your album cover

**moonagenightmares** (2): despite 2021 literally being in the rate title i instinctually checked what year this was because its so outdated in the most bland way

**1998tweety** (7): When I hear this live in 2 months I hope every single person in the room yells POINT while pointing at Sunmi.

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): Four points for her!

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): I love this in all of its cheesy glory, it‚Äôs genuinely just all flabster and actually not bad nu disco (which is high praise considering I don‚Äôt like most nu disco!)

**BaconShoes** (10): well, you‚Äôve got a point! Idc this is a smash

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): YOU GOT A POINT (POINT!) pure camp idc idc she ate this up

**kpoppyko** (10): how the fuck did you people like noir over this

**plastichaxan** (10): holy shit this hit so hard for this rate omg

**RandomHypnotica** (10): GIRLBOSS MISANDRY ANTHEM YASS!!!!

**runaway3212** (10): omg it does!

**vayyiqra** (10): Still processing what the hell happened in that MV but anyway yeah this is a banger and sometimes basic retro 80s synthpop is Good In Fact. (I mean that's what Reboot is and it slaps so there)

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): I'm pretending I didn't hear the ill-advised rap break bc everything else is golden

**seanderlust** (9.1): Dula Peep core

**bespectacIed** (9): incapable of not making a bop

**bluetriangles04** (9): GODDAMN IT!

**celladonn** (9): Fun and slay

**Kadenfrost** (9): K-poppies are memeing the rap part but the song is pretty serviceable. The MV is also camp!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I think I found my favorite music video in this whole rate

**thedoctordances1940** (8.7): yeah this is great idc, sure the rapping sucks but like it's funny and i love the hook

**aestheticen** (8.5): She's so quirky for the Mean Girls reference

**maybecrf** (8.5): a bop, but this music video has me lost

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): actually sunmi, i can‚Äôt sit anywhere! i have hemorrhoids

**xxipil0ts** (8.5): - all night i'll riot with you i know you got my back and you know i got you so come one (come on) come on (come on) come on (come on) let's get physical

**LilacDaffodils** (8.4): would be a nine if not for the "rap" (if you can call it that) part. it's still a great song even more so for me who buys into the retro concept Every. Single. Time.

**Victerade** (8.3): the rap just adds spice

**moonshxne** (8.1): musically not her best or whatever, but idc the MV is kinda iconic

**BasedButta** (8): weirdass clip i hate it!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd be able to recover from somebody telling me they straight up hate me while smiling and dancing like that.

**coolfluffle** (8): loved the aesthetic and didnt even mind the rap much (point!)

**Gonza\_90** (8): omg I love Mean Girls

**Kayaking11116** (8): actually i cant sit anywhere, I have hemorrhoids

**mayolizard** (8): the rap FDHJDSKHGJFJKHSGDFJHKGSD so funny to me i cant lie

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): put me with all the other comments mentioning her rap

**welcome2thejam** (8): This song had a wide open path to being a 10 but tripped over itself with that awful attempt at a rap verse

**Cooler\_lin** (7.9): could've been an eight point something if she didn't try to rap, im being so serious

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.9): a sounds like warmed-over So Bad by STAYC

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this sounds like a bully song but I guess I would let Sunmi bully me

**sarcasticsobs** (7.7): Freaking 80‚Äôs-ish nonsense grabbing me yet again

**chenle** (7.6): she's got a point

**anothertown** (7.5): unremarkable song, but the video is such a weird mix of 80s, 90s, and 2000s aesthetics that i can't help but like it lol

**DaBigBoi** (7.5): YOU GOT A POINT (POINT!)

**ricki** (7.5): over/under how many "point (POINT!)" related comments this will get. my guess is 26

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): I predict 18 comments in the Mean Girls section

**whoisValensi** (7.5): WELL YOU'VE GOT A POINT! üó£ POINT!

**alwayswords** (7.3): POINT!

**bulforster** (7.2): point(s)!

**agentofscranton** (7): the 'rap' verse is the highest form of camp actually

**Esh\_Kebab** (7): Legit docking it a full point for the "You've got a point" line, and another for the rest of the rap verse.

**hikkaru** (7): POINT!

**Qwilphish** (7): A pretty standard 80s inspired synth song, with a godawful rap. You know ive got a point (POINT! üì¢)

**SFbby** (7): Please no more English raps :/

**skargardin** (7): this de-grew on me a little I fear

**sliced-peaches** (7): i should be mean and rank lower bc of that "rap" but sunmi gave birth to me and god says should always honor your mother

**yatcho** (7): girl what in the world is the concept of this video

**moonagenightmares** (6.8): she fell off

**IsaiahTB0** (6.5): This song does not fare well w relistens.

**jasannn** (6.5): ti remember being amazed by this song and the mini and said ‚Äúi really hope i dont drop this after a week.‚Äù (its usually not a good sign if i like the song a lot on first listen) and then i proceeded to drop it.

**1998tweety** (9.5): This was definitely a surprise. Not y‚Äôall doing their SMASH dirty like this. I guess it‚Äôs more of a background music song? It doesn‚Äôt feel like a huge event but I still like it and I think y‚Äôall did this dirty. Let‚Äôs learn to appreciate songs that aren‚Äôt mega bops ok?

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): HANN is a 10 so this is a 9

---

**vhqv1997** (11): we need more oh my girl - destiny concepts there is not enough in the world to satiate me

**2dina3dworld** (10): Gi-dle‚Äôs best songs are always the ones where they rip off Hann.

**chancehugs** (10): LOVE the vibe of this song. The "HwAaaaAAaaaa" chorus is honestly so addicting.

**ilyyyyy** (10): i either love or hate gidle tracks so it's super exciting whenever they release, this one was great

**MToms** (10): Is this a controversial opinion? Honestly a bop since the first time I heard it. I guess I'm a sucker for middle eastern and latin beats (ETHNIC HIP?) because ( )I-DLE are my jam.

**PSSST12** (10): one of their best title tracks but I dont think they wil ever outdo lion for me. Still this is so GOOD. If only soojin didnt fuck up.

**runaway3212** (10): When they said 'i burn' they meant Soojin's career

**SFbby** (10): My favorite (G)I-dle comeback aesthetic-wise - the cold winters, the nature-esque flowers, the burning flames, it all makes perfect sense despite being polar opposites

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): this was the first album of (g)i-dle's i listened to and i was blown away. i love the dramatics and the vocalizing in the chorus

**seanderlust** (9.2): ooh that post-chorus is delicious

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): God help me be this fabulous for just 5 seconds at some point before I die.

**bluetriangles04** (9): The last comeback with Soojin... I really enjoyed HWAA upon release, and as a mini album, 'I burn' was one of the best releases in K-Pop last year. Whether it's the lyricism, the production in the song, or even the performance aspects with the dance and video visuals, or the impact this song had during the time period it was released, HWAA was a very solid release for (G)I-DLE.

**treecoh** (9): this sounds like every other gidle song, which is good i guess

**vayyiqra** (9): It's good, even though the "wintery" concept makes no sense when it's clearly a summery vibe with its Latin sound (that and the name literally means "fire" lol among other things). I was going to lower the score but woke up with it in my head today so I'm keeping it.

**Victerade** (9): THIS MINI AND THIS SONG WAS NOT BORING will defend till i die

**LilacDaffodils** (8.2): Not sure why I didn't give this more of a listen before my guess was I liked the chorus a lot but got let down by the verses like I did again here. Sounds similar to my favorite (G)I-DLE release HANN which I remember everyone not liking it so maybe I just have subversive tastes.

**aestheticen** (8): It's weird that this is labeled as 2021 because I remember listening to this in 2019

**anothertown** (8): they are so in their bag doing this moody, ethereal stuff please let's go back

**Cooler\_lin** (8): love the use of traditional eastern instruments and the unison chorus but it feels a bit slower than it should be imo. for an (G)I-DLE song it's not their best but def solid

**ernie** (8): (Soojin's last title track with IDLE, this is kinda bittersweet.... as much as how good this song is i also kinda get sad knowing that this was soojin's last tt with them)

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): i‚Äôve seen this get flack for being boring but it‚Äôs actually quite nice! oriental inspirations can never go wrong‚Ä¶ also soojin we miss you </3

**ignitethephoenix** (8): a good song by them?? I‚Äôm shocked

**jay duh** (8): this is so niece vibes

**Kayaking11116** (8): way too similar to Hann to stand out on its own but that doesnt mean its bad by any means

**mimins** (8): not even close to idles best but still good. the mv was very pretty too

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): It‚Äôs funny how I listened to this song before knowing what the lyrics were and I still understood that feeling of icy cold and warmth they were going for

**starla\_** (7.9): I feel like this could have slapped harder

**moonshxne** (7.7): Oh wow, what a pretty song! I do think the song would be greatly improved (i.e., sound far less like generic K-pop girl group fare) if the girls harmonized in the verses, but all in all a solid slow burn.

**apatel27** (7.5): What even was the point of the ps2 graphics

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): there‚Äôs some slayage here with how catchy and it‚Äôs good that (G)I-DLE seemed to get a song to feel connected with itself but I can‚Äôt help but feel this could‚Äôve went harder

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): this feels like training montage music

**Qwilphish** (7.5): I really liked this song when it came out but I think the verses are pretty mid overall. Visuals are really on another level, and I love the traditional influences

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): I actually really like this, but that ending is edging

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): **Yuqi‚Äôs vocal timbre**

**moonagenightmares** (7.3): the chorus is a bit disappointing

**celladonn** (7): This sounds like a rehash of HANN but HANN is a great song sooo

**coolfluffle** (7): i know this is artistically a fantastic song but it is a little slow for me, and not a fan of choruses repeating one word sorry

**Kadenfrost** (7): not this sounding like boring instrumental cult music... but they still slayed a bit.

**paigama** (7): this song is actually better than what I remember. was a 5 prior to listening to it again

**plastichaxan** (7): despacito type of beat

**sabooyah** (7): good song, a bit forgettable tho compared to their other title tracks

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): the chorus is not giving enough after the build-up to it

**akanewasright** (6.5): I think I‚Äôve just been stockholmed into liking (G)I-DLE‚Äôs shit now‚Ä¶ I probably would have dragged this for being boring a few months ago but now I think it‚Äôs fine

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.5): kinda reminds me of a sia song in some places

**bulforster** (6.5): oh hey it's the best song I've heard from them (derogatory)

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): a song that‚Äôs amazing up until the chorus

**wavingwolves** (6.5): WAAAAAAA WAAAAAAA WAAAAAAAAA

**cremeebrulee** (6.4): we have HANN at home:

**thedoctordances1940** (6.2): this is good for (G)I-DLE

**2l82bstr8** (6): this is just Lion if it didn't settle into a single of the grooves it introduced

**alwayswords** (6): WE MISS YOU SOOJIN

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this was such a weird start to the rate but i guess that‚Äôs also about right? Like hwaaaaaaa

**maybecrf** (6): i was so bored

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Soyeon: Can I copy your homework? Soyeon: Sure, but don't make it too obvious. Soyeon:

**welcome2thejam** (6): Good, but just never hit the next gear it needed

**Zypker125** (5.6): Song was so mid it caused Soojin to leave

**IsaiahTB0** (5.2): Their best title track (until Tomboy came to obliterate it). This feels like Kpop's Cheap Thrills (derogatory).

=====

2021inKPOP: **BaconShoes** (5): wasn‚Äôt bad but wasn‚Äôt doing much for me idk

**Esh\_Kebab** (5): Still not sure why they had to fire Soojin for this one. The song isn't THAT bad.

**frogaranaman** (5): giving "flashback when faced with imminent death reflecting upon one's life when faced with death and thinking about the simple lifestyle with someone you love that you could have had if you didn't go into a life of crime that eventually gets cut off by someone saving your life thus giving you the chance to live that life you just dreamt up" scene a bit

**melody** (5): meh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): theres literally nothing notable about this whatsoever

**TragicKingdom1** (5): (g)i-dle make a song that isn't full of baffling creative decisions challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): ehhh this is kinda just there for me

**ebooks#5454** (4): giving Frozen vibes...bc they're both boring

**orbiteezus** (4): nothing as offensive as the ‚Äòi would rather film a tiktok‚Äô verse but outside of the chorus i‚Äôm not a fan

**RandomHypnotica** (4): this is just so‚Ä¶ generic and nothing, like‚Ä¶ they couldn't even find some words for the chorus?

**skargardin** (4): this chorus really is something

**mayolizard** (3): i was not a fan </3

**pig-serpent** (3): Hey, we rated this (G)I-DLE song in the last rate.  Did you think that just because you changed the video name from HANN to HWAA we wouldn't notice? (Okay they‚Äôre not actually that similar but the main ooh vocal riffs could be swapped around without drastically changing the songs.)

**nicolas** (2.5): bland ass chorus

**whoisValensi** (2.5): Now, I didn't like this when it was released... (And I am pretty sure I was vocal about that last rate heyo!) And guess what? Yeah this still doesn't fucking hit for me. Thank god "TOMBOY" and really the entire 'I NEVER DIE' album exist. At least Minnie looked good this era right???? Minnie stans in the audience please rise.

**ricki** (2): the unexpected and sudden ending was actually foreshadowing to the unexpected and sudden ending of soojin's carreer

**Stryxen** (2): a lot of ideas being thrown around. launched against the wall without a care if they stick

**DaBigBoi** (1.5): Empty production and writing.

**sage** (1): one of the worst choruses ever

**bespectacIed** (0): if idle has 1 million haters i am one of them. if idle has only 1 hater, that is me. if idle has no haters, that means i am dead

**1998tweety** (9): She‚Äôs glassy and classy. This was def robbed, that chorus whew. IZONE had their good share of bombs as a group but I must admit their solo songs have been bopping.

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): Is it bad that I prefer the Kwon Eun Bi debut

---

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): she went back in time, burned down the library of alexandria, snorted the ash directly, which got her so high that she went back and wrote this 3 minutes and 20 seconds slay in one sitting.

**jay duh** (10): shes younger than me but at this moment in time she was mother..

**whoisValensi** (10): Me who has somehow avoided this song until this exact moment. I was a fool. But that's not surprising considering Jo Yuri is a former IZ*ONE member and let's just say I don't have the best track record w/ not being a fool in regards to them...

**Qwilphish** (9.5): She ate her debut up so hard. Love the cheekiness and personality that she imbues into the song.

**paigama** (9.1): really good song + really like the vocals

**2l82bstr8** (9): I just love her velvety voice

**bluetriangles04** (9): Yuri dropped the best intial b-side post IZ*ONE (Express Moon) and if you want to argue with me you can go talk to a brick wall. GLASSY was also a really solid solo debut and really suited Yuri and her voice.

**coolfluffle** (9): such a gorgeous song, a bit disappointed with her latest release but thats to be expected with a strong and unique solo debut

**Kayaking11116** (9): her voice is so good and this song is so catchy. i love the chorus

**maybecrf** (9): this song has a lot going on, but most of it is good

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): SO BRIGHT JOHA!!!

**rslashpoopheads** (9): this one gets all the homies on their feet

**runaway3212** (9): Iz*one disbanding the best thing to happen to kpop lets talk about it

**ebooks#5454** (8.9): cute and catchy

**anothertown** (8.5): this is about that time when the first teaser trailer for cinderella 2015 came out and it was just a video of the glass slipper rotating

**wavingwolves** (8.4): i'm so obsessed with how she says ''glassy''

**Victerade** (8.3): grew on me a lot

**IsaiahTB0** (8.2): Good song.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): is he in love with you or is he just stoned

**ernie** (8): (a cute banger)

**Jhe116** (8): The post-chorus failed the pre-chorus and chorus

**mimins** (8): good vibes we love to hear it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): am i going crazy or does this song sample chelsea dagger

**bulforster** (7.5): I want to score this higher but the post chorus really stalls the song every time.

**MassiveThief** (7.5): the double clap YASS

**orbiteezus** (7.5): i really like this song and i‚Äôve listened to it over 10 times but one of my major takeaways is that her voice sounds really breathy for some reason, i enjoy it but also its like my only thought for some reason

**cherryices** (7.3): this is interpolating chelsea dagger right? right??

**sarcasticsobs** (7.2): Funky! Post-chorus not for me!

**BaconShoes** (7): groovy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Not a full glas-slay but a little glas-slay.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): this is pleasant, i like it more than i remembered

**melody** (7): SLAY

**PSSST12** (7): That breakdown was good but not sure about the rest of the song. .

**skargardin** (7): this does bop a little

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It‚Äôs pretty

**akanewasright** (6.5): idk it‚Äôs fine I‚Äôm just tired

**aestheticen** (6): This would have gotten a higher score if not for that post-chorus

**CrimsonROSET** (6): ‚Äòhey i forgot this part of the chorus so i‚Äôm just gonna do noises feel free to edit it out in the official version‚Äô ‚Äòyou got it jo yuri‚Äô

**hikkaru** (6): out of 2021 izone solos i prefer door. but it's ok but eunbi will EAT 2022 kpop (if glitch isn't in the hosts will be hearing from my lawyers)

**ilyyyyy** (6): good, inoffensive

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i just noticed it with this song, but why do half of these songs use that skinny serif font for the cover?

**moonshxne** (6): pleasant and easy on the ears but something about this is kinda...bland

**vayyiqra** (6): This arguably sounds like more of a Red Velvet song (a mid B-side, but still) than the song that is literally by a member of Red Velvet oh that song is a cover well that explains a lot ! Anyway a lot of songs here have the pattern of "I like the chorus but not much else" and this one is interestingly the opposite to me. More strictly, the post-chorus (the la-la-la part) isn't great.

**LesApfels** (5.5): The production is very interesting but the song doesn't go anywhere

**Tazzachar** (5.5): yuri is still my bias in izone, but I was underwhelmed

**Zypker125** (5.3): I was trying to think of a snarky comment to make, but I got nothing for this song, so here‚Äôs an emoji of some ducks instead: ü¶Üü¶Üü¶Ü

**DirtyRat583** (5.2): a better lalisa

**apatel27** (5): Did you know there is a giant glass slipper in Chiayi Taiwan that was made as a tourist attraction because "women love shoes"

**cremeebrulee** (5): dua lipa if she was boring(er)

**mayolizard** (5): was not feeling it

**vhqv1997** (5): well at least she didn't have the worst solo debut fresh out of izone

**welcome2thejam** (5): Fun chorus though

**DaBigBoi** (4.5): Glassy is such a random word to work with lol you go queen

**Cooler\_lin** (4.3): i cannot remember this song no matter how many times i listen to it, i cannot stand for mediocracy

**sabooyah** (4): boring and forgettable

**BasedButta** (3): this is quite nothing. I feel like the writer didn‚Äôt want to write a song and just made a chorus that, even then, is only barely passable.

**bespectacIed** (3): so disappointing for a main vocal, like this is a disservice to her talent and hype. no wonder she fizzled out

**chancehugs** (3): Not a fan of her vocal technique here - she sounds like she's constantly out of breath.

**celladonn** (2): This is really dull and forgettable sorry

**pig-serpent** (2): Boring song with terribly sung ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a place in France‚Äù riff.

**1998tweety** (8): Their So Am I moment. I mean at least it bops. With SISTAR gone, I‚Äôm not against Brave Girls becoming our summer bop queens.

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): Pool Party is undoubtedly better, but this song served its purpose as Rollin‚Äôs little sister

---

**bigbigbee** (10): Massive weeaboo dumbass moment - listening to enough k-pop has taught me that ‚Äúbaram‚Äù means wind. I also know that ‚Äúmat‚Äù can mean flavor, as in Red Velvet‚Äôs ‚ÄúRed Flavor‚Äù (bbalgan mat). I ALSO have learned the term ‚Äúchi-maek‚Äù, in which Chi is short for chicken and Maek is short for maekju (beer). All of these independent facts combined means that, for about six months, I thought that this song was about a breeze that smelled like fried chicken. anyway it‚Äôs a bop omg brave girls new summer queens

**ilyyyyy** (10): again, so good i love brave girls

**Kadenfrost** (10): Summer Queens fr. This song is the embodiment of having your first summer getaway with your friends. They didn't have to snap so hard, they deserve all the success and recognition, wishing them all the luck and love after the mess that is Queendom 2 <3

**LesApfels** (10): It's a great time at the water park

**rslashpoopheads** (10): SOES (Song of Every Summer)

**vhqv1997** (10): no offense but this > rollin'

**welcome2thejam** (10): I HATE when an artist's first single after their first big hit makes a reference to that song, lmao, huge One Hit Wonder energy. So they're damn fortunate this is an incredible summer smash cause I wanted to hate it on principle

**Zypker125** (9.6): ‚ÄúMinyoung (ft. other girls) - Chi Mat Ba Ram‚Äù, but I‚Äôm not complaining because her high notes send me to a higher place.

**bespectacIed** (9): Their Oh!. Their Hot Pink. Their BAAM. For every smash hit, there is a lesser hit follow-up carbon copy. We respect the hustle

**Kayaking11116** (9): took another listen to like it more but oh my god this is such a feel good summer bop i really love it

**skargardin** (9): BOP!

**sliced-peaches** (9): they really r queens of summer arent they

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): üé∑

**vayyiqra** (9): Every time I see the title of this I think it has something to do with a placename in Southeast Asia (probably thinking of Chiang Mai) and that not what it means! anyway it's a good song it's energetic and fun

**starla\_** (8.9): 2016 tropical house called

**paigama** (8.8): a fun summer song with fitting powerful (-sounding) vocals though it aged a bit (or maybe I overplayed it)

**bluetriangles04** (8.5): BRAVE SOUND!!!!! IDGAF!!!! IF IT HITS IT HITS!!!!

**celladonn** (8.5): THEE summer kpop song of 2021

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): very obvious attempt to recreate Rollin but it's still great!

**bulforster** (8.4): Is this particularly groundbreaking? Is this just an attempt at remaking Rollin? I love them so much I don't care (their performance of this on queendom was robbed btw!!)

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): Liked the plucky bass, Fun chorus. Good for summer (what a unique insight, sarcasticsobs, great job!)

**chancehugs** (8): A little too much going on with the instrumental, and abit generic? Minyoung's voice elevates the song tho (but when has it not).

**chenle** (8): invented summer TBH

**flavasavavandal** (8): it is coming right after After We Ride so I can‚Äôt help feel slightly disappointed that the lightning didn‚Äôt strike twice but this still has its moments

**IsaiahTB0** (8): A fun summer anthem. Love the screeching vocals, love the vibe. The girls slayed.

**jasannn** (8): Brave Sound at it‚Äôs purest.

**maybecrf** (8): they ate

**Victerade** (8): grew on me v poorly but good song

**wavingwolves** (8): this is DUMB FUN!!!!!!! if you hate this you're DEAD INSIDE!!!!!!!!!!

**Cooler\_lin** (7.8): a grower! it was stuck in my head earlier, i love summer <3

**akanewasright** (7.5): fuck it, we love the beach

**apatel27** (7.5): Solid summer track

**BasedButta** (7): not a fan of the kpop obsession with ‚Äúsummer songs‚Äù (the concept is fine, the problem is usually just how it sounds) but if you‚Äôre gonna do it, it doesn‚Äôt get much better than this

**ebooks#5454** (7): all these kpop girlies be having a designated summer song the way all anime has designated a beach episode

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): a song for the girls to frolic to in the summer weather‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs cute i don‚Äôt have much to say about it!

**LilacDaffodils** (7): Summer jam

**MToms** (7): This sounds like early 2010s

**runaway3212** (7): them saying "you know who it is!" before being promptly forgotten

**sabooyah** (7): fun summer track!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Pretty average but not bad

**yatcho** (7): the filler episode of the anime where they go to the beach

**xxipil0ts** (6.8): - im a little startled they're the same group behind after we ride. this ain't mean this is bad

**mayolizard** (6.5): yass slay

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): what in the early 2010s edm is this

**Stryxen** (6.5): the prechrorus drop moment is so bad but everything else is cute

**aestheticen** (6): You can tell Brave Bros took some throwaway song in the vault and summoned it after they exploded in popularity

**BaconShoes** (6): summery sensation

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I enjoy this while it‚Äôs playing but I cannot remember how it goes after it‚Äôs over at all.

**mimins** (6): basic but I like their vocals

**pig-serpent** (6): Go for more than just a dip!  Grab more than just a bite!  See more than what‚Äôs on the map!  Rest more than just your eyes!  Don‚Äôt just take a vacation!  Rise to the vacation!  Come seek the Royal Caribbean!

**plastichaxan** (6): truly something for the summertime something for the girls to have fun

**Qwilphish** (6): She wants to be rollin so bad, but she will never be famous

**moonshxne** (5.7): the vibes are right but the topline melody is all over the place AND drags

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): this sounds kinda like Barbarbar

**orbiteezus** (5.5): not that this sounds like rollin‚Äô but feels like they were trying to recreate the same viral summer song but like did it worse

=====

2021inKPOP: **2l82bstr8** (5): it's fun but this group has a tendency of being really shouty and ithis is the most bothersome it's ever been

**CrimsonROSET** (5): besties it‚Äôs winter

**frogaranaman** (5): judging by the title, I expected this to be much more of a 0 magnet

**NotWith10000Men** (5): just not into brave girls' thing

**PSSST12** (5): They tried to redo rollin but flopped hard. Sorry girlies.

**whoisValensi** (5): I see what you did there... "Rolling in the deep" yeah I saw that. Anyways I think I'm starting to get allergic to summer songs. Either that or this just doesn't hit that hard for me personally. Good on them for being "Summer Queens" but I think I will continue being a "Winter King".

**cosmicneve** (4.5): I think Brave Brothers (singular) should have given up his pride and hired a better producer for Brave Girls' first comeback post-Rollin revival, maybe then the end result would have been better.

**ernie** (4): (after we ride & chi mat ba ram were truly the downfall for brave girls, they had a excellent song post rollin called we ride and they decided to release these two after rollin's rise? at least thank you saved them i guess)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): NO MORE KPOP SUMMER SONGS!! WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH KPOP SUMMER SONGS TO LAST A LIFETIME

**SkylarV** (3): I wish we rated Pool Party instead because its the REAL title from this release

**sage** (2.1): literally just rollin but not as bad

**jay duh** (1): ...

**moonagenightmares** (1): no but what year is it

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna be summer queens‚Äù sistar are rollin‚Äô in their graves right now!!

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): The beat is sick!! It‚Äôs Sticker yassified

**1998tweety** (6): Classic SM, the first title is a weird mess and the second one is pop perfection. As much as I wanna just give SHINee high scores, this is a bit too messy for me.

---

**HoshiLock** (11): Shinee made the best 2021 comeback

**2l82bstr8** (10): this on the other hand is an EXO song (also complimentary)

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Some of that styling was a choice but this goes hard af

**IsaiahTB0** (10): My life was genuinely changed when this came out idk.... SHINee we miss you

**Islands** (10): Honestly disliked this in silence near the time it came out but it was interesting enough to keep me coming back and i pretty much love it all now

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): this whole album >>>

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I can't believe they wrote a response to call me maybe 9 years later

**sage** (10): minho came on this bitch mad as hell

**whoisValensi** (10): Okay I'm gonna try to not write too many words regarding this song but I'm sure I'm gonna fail at that. So, "Don't Call Me", the song that made the GP go "Hey let's remind our bosses it isn't work hours!" That's not even like a joke, or at least I recall reading something about that... But, it's what really fucking pulled me back here. I've talked in bits & bops about how my relationship w/ K-Pop has been rocky since late 2017 due to uhhhh reasons but jesus christ the everything leading up to this entire comeback fucking pulled me back in so beyond hard lolllllll. Like... Yes, this year I'll be celebrating my 8th(!) year as a Shawol and that's fantastic, truly, but like holy shit. My hype levels were OFF the charts for this song, this album, this entire comeback. And oh boy did it fucking deliver imo. They said "Hey we're gonna do something we've never done before!" and they DID and it was so fucking good. Sorry, IS so fucking good. Like... this was an instant classic in my book the second I heard the opening notes. And in a way this felt really like a return to form for the guys, again imo. And hopefully that doesn't sound offensive when I say that but man, looking back TSOL doesn't really do quite much for me. Essay over but; Give this album a spin, give this repack a spin, change your life.

**chenle** (9.9): i would've given this a 10 if yoo young jin's voice in the chorus wasn't more audible than any shinee member's

**sarcasticsobs** (9.7): Minho‚Äôs abs have me forgiving him for saying ‚Äúshawty‚Äù

**mayolizard** (9.5): supreme munch‚Ä¶ minho‚Äôs line ‚Äúsick of all your trash‚Äù saved my life

**cherryices** (9.3): thank you shinee for raising awareness of the increase in telemarketing scams during the pandemic

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): i know some people didnt like this but its so ominous and groovy

**aestheticen** (9): You wouldn't get it at first listen...

**BaconShoes** (9): the bop was bopping

**bluetriangles04** (9): idk why everytime I hear the "I know where you came from" line now in my head I just see the meme of the homophobic dog saying "I know what you are"

**celladonn** (9): This took a while to grow on me but it definitely did - the last minute in particular is so good

**cremeebrulee** (9): i'm sorry but the old shinee can't come to the phone right now... why? oh cause she‚Äôs dead

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I appreciate them for doing something very different but the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt call me‚Äù part is just so awkward. The chorus slaps though and makes me love the song though

**Kayaking11116** (9): to whoever put Key in that fugly ass feather hat, Dont Call Me Dont Call Me Dont Call Me Dont Call Me, but i‚Äôll let it slide this time bc Key needed some serious humbling

**moonshxne** (9): what can I say? SHINee‚Äôs still got it

**Cooler\_lin** (8.9): definitely a grower but i don't know everything clicks for me by the time the second verse comes on and the bridge/high note starts

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): this is very strange but i think i like it? idk i might change my mind

**NotWith10000Men** (8.2): okay their stuff sounds cool, will be checking them out

**bespectacIed** (8): Lichrally sounds like an exo song repurposed for shinee cuz half of the exo dudes are either gone or "serving" in a korean mandatory sense whew

**Gonza\_90** (8): Me at my cable provider

**Kadenfrost** (8): Kind of a mess but that Studio Choom performance is chef's kiss

**kyrgyzzephyr** (8): i‚Äôm at a weird spot with this song cos i'm not sold by the delivery of it but i really enjoy it nonetheless. taemin‚Äôs part with the piano is chefs kiss tho

**mimins** (8): it's a grower but I dig it

**orbiteezus** (8): tbh i thought this song was kinda mediocre on first listen but the melodies are amazing, also the bass sounding like ‚Äòdum dum dum‚Äô is so fun

**runaway3212** (8): key sounds so serious here it's like the pushover kid finally saying no very angrily

**sliced-peaches** (8): me at telemarketers

**moonagenightmares** (7.8): the nctfication of shinee

**BasedButta** (7.5): really creative song. I‚Äôll put it that way. I‚Ä¶ kinda like it‚Ä¶ especially the last part of the chorus. overall weird instrumental but very cool

**wavingwolves** (7.5): i will never no hear exo in this

**bigbigbee** (7): The choreo for this is soooOOOoo good. The song disappointed me a little, though I think that partially that‚Äôs because my expectations for SHINee are so sky-high. It‚Äôs not a bad song! It just doesn‚Äôt feel like ‚ÄúSHINee‚Äù to me (everyone will have already said this, but it feels a lot like an EXO title track - SM were historically good at not allowing their artists‚Äô concepts to overlap, so that was a bit of a surprise to me. Key‚Äôs ad libs are everything though

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I‚Äôm not crazy about the production but I enjoy the drama of this one.

**bookthieving** (7): that post-bridge piano is DRAMA

**Qwilphish** (7): who hurt them lmfao

**skargardin** (7): at least it's intersting

**tiltheendoftheline** (7): not their best but still pretty good.

**2dina3dworld** (6): what this has over Atlantis is that it feels like it wasn‚Äôt produced in five minutes

**chancehugs** (6): Sounds like an EXO reject tbh. Did they just sing "Pokemon" and "Pikachu" in the bridge?

**PSSST12** (6): for shinees caliber this is too generic for them.

**sabooyah** (6): just ok no matter how much i want to be biased and give this a 10 x2

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): ‚Äúsick of all your trash‚Äù me doing this rate

**bulforster** (2.9): this is just the pilot run for step back

**1998tweety** (8): She‚Äôs cute. Nothing ground-breaking, but it‚Äôs safe and cute.

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): How do you make a dance song so boring!

---

**2l82bstr8** (10): exactly as much fun and wonder and you'd imagine an alien disco party to be

**maybecrf** (10): sheeeeeeeeeeesh

**Qwilphish** (10): this is one of the most disgustingly catchy songs ever. OH MY GIRL just get it.... absolutely absolutely an 11 contender

**Roxieloxie** (10): daisy bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): this has grown on me sooooo much i too have that disco rhythm in my body

**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): It‚Äôs *so* saccharine but OOOOH BABY GIMME BABY GIMME BABY GIMME MORE, ÎÇ† Î©àÏ∂îÏßÄ Îßà LOVE THIS SONG

**wavingwolves** (9.1): one of the best choruses in the rate

**ilyyyyy** (9): sooo good, i love their voices. the album is definitely worth checking out as well, especially 'quest' !!!! (this is so embarrassing to say but i love that track bc it reminds me of banana allergy monkey which i absolutely love)

**PSSST12** (9): a little bit generic but im lying if i say this doesnt give me an instant dopamine rush everytime I hear it.

**aestheticen** (8.5): Listening to this song after a chunk of terrible songs makes this sound like the best song to ever exist

**metanoira** (8.5): FINALLY SOME GOOD MUSIC!!!!!

**bigbigbee** (8): example #1362 of a group that tried out a different sound but sort of lost what made them special. This is still nice, but I think that Oh My Girl had one of the strongest title track runs in all of k-pop from their debut to The Fifth Season. Yes I‚Äôm including Coloring Book

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this is like snorting sugar

**flavasavavandal** (8): pretty pleasant with a nice rhythm

**rslashpoopheads** (8): OMG kinda going downhill ever since Nonstop but that bassline though

**runaway3212** (8): dolphin robbed btw

**skargardin** (8): bop!

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): don‚Äôt don‚Äôt dance (oh but I will)

**vuemaurel** (8): Fun

**welcome2thejam** (8): If I had a nickel for every time a music video in this rate for a retro-inspired bop featured someone briefly standing near neon lighting and wearing a Yankees cap (After We Ride), I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot but its strange that it happened twice

**ebooks#5454** (7.9): cute

**IsaiahTB0** (7.9): One of the better 80's leaning tracks in the rate. Cute song.

**Cooler\_lin** (7.7): i love how fun this one is, def one of my fave omg releases

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): its cute, it's entirely inoffensive which in this rate makes it top half

**chenle** (7.6): i feel terrible for saying this because i swear there are gg songs as high as this that i don't feel this way about, but the vocals in the chorus are SO high that it's hard to listen to :( other than that it's cute and catchy

**NotWith10000Men** (7.6): it's just so bright and sunny. i was driving around to this song literally this weekend

**whoisValensi** (7.5): This was cute on release and it's still cute now. Also this is totally a summer song but it's a FUN ONE! Like I too now want to also Dun Dun Dance! Also idk why but I'm curious as to how this song would go over in a gay club and idk what has sparked this curiosity in me...

**bluetriangles04** (7): How can one hate a song as simple and straight forward as this one is? Yeah, it's pretty boring in comparison to Nonstop... but it's also SUPER good in comparison to Real Love. It slides right in the middle of them and is cute!

**coolfluffle** (7): so cute, very summery and a good follow on from dolphin

**frogaranaman** (7): good video game

**Kayaking11116** (7): cute fun dun dun dancing vibes you know?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): ubisoft is planning the routine for this in just dance 2023 as we speak

**vayyiqra** (7): something disco whatever (disco is when dance-pop)

**mimins** (6.5): wow I love summer

**orbiteezus** (6.5): its cute!

**bulforster** (6.3): This is fine but 5th season remains the only OMG song rated that's made me think their other music could be worth looking into

**apatel27** (6): Just doesn't go anyway

**celladonn** (6): Cute but I wouldn't go back to it much and I feel like the vocals are mixed too loud

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): nonstop was a whop but also the beginning of the end‚Ä¶ now they keep releasing mid ass songs and i hate it :(

**mayolizard** (6): love the disco delusion because this is nowhere near disco babes

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it‚Äôs cute but nothing more. jiho my queen tho

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I‚Äôm conflicted‚Ä¶ some parts sound nice and some parts sound annoying

**akanewasright** (5.5): The chorus is cute at least

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.5): forgettable

**BaconShoes** (5.5): kinda mid idk

**DaBigBoi** (5): Ur dun

**jay duh** (5): oh my mediocre

**Zypker125** (4.8): And the award for ‚ÄúMost Out Of Place Rap Break(s) of the Year‚Äù goes to‚Ä¶.

**bespectacIed** (4): oh mid girl strikes again. dunno how this smashed

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): A flimsy disco beat? Groundbreaking.

**pig-serpent** (4): OH MY GIRL this is a huge drop in quality from your songs in the last rate, what happened!?

**sabooyah** (4): will i ever enjoy an omg track

**vhqv1997** (4): what unexpected commercial success does to a mf

**SkylarV** (3): Can I please be DUN DUN listening to this song?

**chancehugs** (2): I dislike this for the same reason as BTS's Permission To Dance - it just feels too happy with no depth.

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): I love making films!!

**1998tweety** (9): This was the surprise of the rate for me. I listened to their debut tracks but kind of forgot about them till hearing this in the rate. Its so smooth and decadent.

---

**bigbigbee** (11): Wow, I really didn‚Äôt expect to give this song my 11 when I started out. There‚Äôs enough distance from the tropical house wave of 2017 that I can really enjoy the genre again, and there‚Äôs a really beautiful, earnest sweetness to both the music and lyrics of this song. I think that there are songs in this rate that are more exciting, and even a few that are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù, but this little song snuck into my heart, curled up, and made itself comfortable, and I‚Äôm glad for its company.

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): i don't follow cix but this was in my top ten most listened to songs last year

**agentofscranton** (10): CIX should be one of the premier 4th gen groups rn, they have the talent, the visuals, and the discography to back it up, the only thing holding them back is their shitty company

**hunnybee12** (10): discovered this in a dark time where i would stay up until 4 am watching music shows live on twitch just to see my fav kpop boy host and be on screen for like 3 mins max. anyways cix promoted this song for ages and by like the sixth week i was like wait a second... this song is fucking amazing. has more emotion and nostalgia than all the other retro/bright boy group tracks of the year combined

**paigama** (10): I haven't listened to this song in months but wow I really should listen to it more often again. One of the best BG songs ever.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): by Kero Kero Bonito so true (do 2018 Indie Pop)

**runaway3212** (10): them looking for a hit and just copying their most succesful single and it worked!!! iconic.

**wavingwolves** (10): this song is so good for no reason!!!!!!!

**seanderlust** (9.5): nobody tell the kyrsten sinema re-election campaign about this song

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): harry styles found dead in a ditch

**ilyyyyy** (9): i thought this was released 2020 for some reason, really nice start to finish

**jasannn** (9): the only real discovery from the rate and oh what a great one it was

**sliced-peaches** (9): so good cant believe this is my first time hearing this

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): the way they sing "oooooh cinema cinema cinema" in the chorus... this could win Best Micro Film in Cannes at the very least

**bulforster** (8.5): This is just really cute

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): if you like this song PLEASE listen to Rebel by CIX also it was the blueprint for this

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): and just like the movies we play out our last scene

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): When the twitter film bros slide into your DMs.

**celladonn** (8): This grew on me a lot, it has a great vibe

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh this is really smooth actually

**ernie** (8): (suprised at how many bg songs i‚Äôm liking considering i only listen to a few bg‚Äôs)

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): maybe i believe in love <3

**IsaiahTB0** (8): Cute song, decent vocals. I need to listen to more CIX

**Kayaking11116** (8): cute and feel good and lively uwu

**melody** (8): calming asf

**metanoira** (8): best visuals of the 4th gen argue with a wall

**moonshxne** (8): cheesy, but it works!

**tiltheendoftheline** (8): fourth gen isn't all "noise"!

**vayyiqra** (8): The chorus to this is really catchy!

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): me when the filibuster still exists

**welcome2thejam** (8): We come to this song for magic. We come to CIX - Cinema to laugh, to cry, to care. Because we need that. All of us. That indescribable feeling we get when the group begins to sing and we go somewhere we‚Äôve never been before. Not just entertained, but somehow reborn. Together. Dazzling images on a small phone screen. Sound that I can feel. Somehow, heartbreak feels good in a place like this. Our k-pop groups feel like the best part of us, and rate scores feel perfect and powerful because here... they are. CIX - Cinema: we make music better.

**sarcasticsobs** (7.9): Ah, yes, finally, some *true* kino. Never heard of this group, some good production stuff in here (i.e., the bass synth), liked the chorus

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): I heard this for the first time while preparing for this rate. The song is very groovy and enjoyable for me, with that said, maybe it needs a little bit more oomph for me? Added to my playlist though for sure.

**sabooyah** (7.5): I don't listen to CIX but every time i stumble upon something from them i like it? This is actually really good and well done for such a simple track! nice. i should look into them more.

**yatcho** (7.5): when you mom says you have BTS at home (the melody is cute though)

**cremeebrulee** (7): harry ended tbh

**ignitethephoenix** (7): harry styles who

**Kadenfrost** (7): That english intro kind of funny and out of place but the song is okay.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): the way movie star is the only GREAT song cix has released

**prada** (7): cute actually

**PSSST12** (7): for song so hyped up this didnt really wowed me. Still catchy though.

**vhqv1997** (7): this song is okay but sometimes i think kpop companies just pick out their concepts from a word generator

**apatel27** (6.5): H&Mcore

**BaconShoes** (6): i was mildly vibing

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): not bad just kinda... there

**ebooks#5454** (6): its giving the same energy as BTOB's "Movie" for some reason??

**orbiteezus** (6): its so disappointing that they only have five members despite their name

**Qwilphish** (6): Chill bop, I probably wouldn't listen to it again on my own

**skargardin** (6): :shrug:

**whoisValensi** (6): CIX and CRX are not the same artists and I have a feeling some pals of mine will be making comments about how they thought certain things (read: revelations) regarding that. With that out of the way, this isn't bad I suppose. Not particularly catching me but not the worst thing ever. Also the CGI in this video is camp.

**Zypker125** (4): Like all of CIX‚Äôs songs, the chorus is pretty good, but the verses are forgettable and boring AF.

**mimins** (3.5): too simple and not a fan of the chorus

**aestheticen** (3): This sounds like a Blue Hour/Dynamite ripoff. Even got that shitty vocal layering/pitching down

**alwayswords** (3): lauv core

**chancehugs** (3): Kinda boring imo. The vocals don't stand out.

**jay duh** (3): ouuuu cinema cinema cinema

**1998tweety** (11): Y‚Äôall. I wanna go back to the first few ballots when this was smashing. They really served us a GAY SEX BOP and y‚Äôall paid it dust. I don‚Äôt even have the words. I knew this would never win but at least day 3????? NEways, Songeniality pick? All Stars? But on second thought, if this is what k-poppies did to this song, idk if I wanna see what everyone else would rate it.

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): Honestly I thought this was a definite lock for top 10. So seeing this be this low makes me think wow.. It‚Äôs always so surprising when you find out something is a vocal minority

---

**hikkaru** (11): im so horny my god

**ricki** (11): are you telling me that a queer baited this??

**sage** (11): one of my fav songs ever we need more like this in kpop.. the crunchy ass chorus best thing ever

**2l82bstr8** (10): did you know there's a gay idol in the k-pop scene? his name is Holland, and though he's faced many difficulties in his career, he's still going strong. his music video "I'm Not Afraid" features this big take where he tongues a guy for like 10+ seconds. and it still wasn't as gay as this is

**bluetriangles04** (10): What do I say other than I'm still not over this song even now?

**celladonn** (10): The absolute slay!!!

**cremeebrulee** (10): everytime i listen to this i just remember the comment akane made that was like i‚Äôll take the bait if you queerbait well enough

**DefaultPophead** (10): Hands up! It's the gag police. You're under arrest.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): gay rights!

**Islands** (10): Kings making weird gay music in these dark times

**jay duh** (10): I Support People That Fall Under The LGBT Umbrella.

**Kayaking11116** (10): JFKSVJWODNWLGZI MHM YEP OK THIS IS FINE I AM FINE

**plastichaxan** (10): sorry i‚Äôm gay

**RandomHypnotica** (10): holy fuck the sexual energy radiating from this

**runaway3212** (10): god im so gay

**skargardin** (10): gay rights!

**Stryxen** (10): sorry I dragged this sage it's good now

**vayyiqra** (10): This chorus is killer and the bass on this is awesome.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): So when y‚Äôall kept commenting ‚ÄúGAAAY! GAY! THIS IS SO GAY!!‚Äù on every single song in the K-Pop boys rate were you all just lying or‚Ä¶ Cause with the sole exception of this song I have been incredibly disappointed by the lack of gay here

**wavingwolves** (10): imagine thinking kpop fans have sex

**whoisValensi** (10): Alright gays stand up for the national anthem! This & "BAD LOVE" are truly the only songs in the rate where I can look at them and go "Oh this one was for the gays and the gays only!" At least this video is uhhhh also gay yeah it has that going for it heavily. Anyways your OnlyOneOf funfact of the rate is that member Junji (the one with the long hair w/ bangs in his eyes if you watched the video) dislikes the horror genre quite a bit! Which I find very funny because my brain just thinks of Junji Ito whenever I read his name lolllllllll.

**Zypker125** (9.7): This is how you make a sexy song, hell yes. That chorus drop can FUCK me in every direction.

**vuemaurel** (9.5): Unexpected from OOO but liked the song and the video!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): they seem like really good friends

**Cooler\_lin** (9): this one hits, come on thots!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): they did it for the gays

**nicolas** (9): bring back queer baiting

**NotWith10000Men** (9): i REALLY like the vibe of this one. not too much going on but it overlaps enough in the chorus to be kinda chaotic

**yatcho** (9): bit fruity

**bulforster** (8.8): guys, is it really so serious that you need to grope each other on national tv?

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): banger

**Jhe116** (8.5): Imagine the queerbaiting discourse this would generate had they been bigger. But all jokes aside I really hope the boys aren‚Äôt exploited during the making

**mimins** (8.5): THIS INSTRUMENTAL???? ATE DOWN??????

**moonagenightmares** (8.5): their bsides being so much better than the titles is a crime

**Qwilphish** (8.5): SEX SEX SEX

**Victerade** (8.5): made my libido go up

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): The title concerned me, but this was a lot fun. Just a beat and chorus that‚Äôs very ‚Äúfor me‚Äù. Bridge and rap are fine, I guess

**akanewasright** (8): answer my texts‚Ä¶

**anothertown** (8): bop but i'm on ssris

**BaconShoes** (8): the production was slaying a bit

**Gonza\_90** (8): Go to Horny Jail

**PSSST12** (8): NOW WHO CHOREOGRAPHED THIS üò≠üò≠ IN SOUTH KOREA? JAIL FOR SETTING THEM UP üò≠üò≠

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4G0qaFVgAQ7Kjv.jpg

**tiltheendoftheline** (8): the song was overshadowed by the choreo

**IsaiahTB0** (7.8): Used to hate this song but its not that bad.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.8): history books will say they were roommates

**aestheticen** (7.5): Overrated as hell... the production sounds like someone sucking on straws. Not the first thing I want to listen to when I have high libido

**MToms** (7.5): Gives me Billie Eilish vibes

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): gay

**mayolizard** (7): shoutout homosexuality

**melody** (7): sexy

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): yass gay people but they couldn‚Äôt have queerbaited with a better song?

**raggedy-princess** (7): rip Love hope you're living your best life far away from 8D's clutches

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): how does this work

**welcome2thejam** (7): The industrial type chorus fits well, definitely a positive for this track. Anyway, I'll let you guys get back to the comments about how horny this MV is

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Bonk.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): whoever is doing the adlibs of ‚Äòwant you to sing on my body‚Äô during the chorus is not getting paid enough that should have been the whole song

**DaBigBoi** (6): Kinda wish the outro switched it up more, but it‚Äôs well-made overall

**ilyyyyy** (6): it's okay, a little underwhelming, haven't checked them out since their bitch from savanna song ig their sound is pretty lowkey

**ImADudeDuh** (6): they should play this in sex ed classrooms

**sabooyah** (6): not my fave but i really appreciate how different this is

**SFbby** (6): Lol now that Youtube shows the most replayed sections of videos no one should be surprised that this honor goes to the crotch grab in the music video

**sliced-peaches** (6): idk who mr sexy in the bath was but he looked tewww good

**1998tweety** (9): I hated this at first but it was a major grower. I think‚Ä¶.I think the opening line might‚Äôve been camp. The whole song has a camp element to it. It was camp.

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): The writers need an ass beating for some of these lyrics, but the production is phenomenal. Ningning belting her ass off at the end is more hilarious than it should be.

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): debated on what to give my 11 but this song is just IT! loooove the hyperpop influences, the buildup in the prechorus, and then that heavenly classic SM bridge!!! this is ART

**MassiveThief** (11): I am fully in on hyper-kpop. The girls ATE on this, I don't care if you have it call it post-good irony or whatever. The chorus is genuinely so fucking cool. I walk out of my house every day and say "hmm... EVERYBODY LOOK AT ME"

**mayolizard** (11): YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS SLAYED

**nicolas** (11): can you say PURR. can you say YASS. can you say WERQ.

**paigama** (11): loved it so much that I even thought it was the best kpop song ever for a bit before coming to my senses again. still the best of 2021 though

**plastichaxan** (11): i just think it‚Äôs the best song ever

**prada** (11): SLAYYYYYYYYYY

**anothertown** (10): if this doesn't go down in history as a kpop camp classic...

**bulforster** (10): or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Naevis

**chancehugs** (10): The song that really got me to appreciate hyperpop (sorry Charli). In naevis we trust.

**chenle** (10): best gg song of 2021 idgaf

**ernie** (10): (i'm legit so tempted to give this song a 11 because it's literally perfect.... but i wanna wait for the later songs)

**hikkaru** (10): trap hard trap trap [edm] future bass deconstructed club hyperpop brostep industrial hip hop experimental hip hop

**IsaiahTB0** (10): A strong follow up to Next Levul, very catchy fun and quirky.

**jasannn** (10): move over ITZY, there‚Äôs a new hyperpop Kpop queen

**jay duh** (10): when i say this is the best song ever made in the history of time i mean it.. even before time was a concept this song still slayed. The big bang was the seed being planted, every single event leading up to to October 5th, 2021 was intended to happen just for this song to exist in our universe. Are you guys familiar with the butterfly effect? Thats exactly what we witnessed with the release of Savage. Planets colliding, stars exploding, dinosaurs being evaporated, me being born omg hey, it all lead up to this moment in time where someone hit some keys on a keyboard and wrote some silly little symbols on a peace of paper and birthed the godly lyricism that is "my naevis we love you!" Thank you aespa for everything you've done to help heal this twisted planet, with every gag and slay you release we take a step closer to world peace ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Kadenfrost** (10): Kwangya gurlies doing too much again they probably camping at the place! The high notes at the end is so funny for no reason pls but I really enjoyed on how messy the sections are, and that gospel song bridge truly takes the cake.

**Kayaking11116** (10): JDBWODBW PERFECT

**melody** (10): Savage Queens being protected by naveis.

**poemforsmallthings** (10): one of the best prechoruses of all time and I'm not even joking

**PSSST12** (10): Not as good as next level but gave us the iconic kwangya prayer. Naevis, you will always be famous.

**raggedy-princess** (10): LeT's MeEt SuReLy AfTeR tHe ReSuRrEcTiOn :D

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me when I give a controversial 0

**runaway3212** (10): after the bridge this becomes truly one of the most unlistenable things ever produced by man

**sarcasticsobs** (10): **ZU ZU ZU ZU**. I don‚Äôt get it, I *absolutely* cannot defend some of it (ex: the ‚Äúoh my gosh‚Äù intro, the ‚Äúmy N√¶vis, we love you‚Äù), but I‚Äôve *been* obsessed, the beat and production are tailor-made for my tastes

**vayyiqra** (10): Now this one I understand having some hate for it, since it's a lot more abrasive and gets chaotic at the end. But! It so happens that I like when aespa yell random stuff over bleepbloops. I also like how the song ends with "what?", as if they're breaking the fourth wall and acknowledging their lyrics are largely gibberish (dzu dzu dzu dzu) and their lore doesn't really make sense. They're so quirky! Love them!!!

**whoisValensi** (10): Lol nah fuck it they got my ass with this one. THEY GOT ME MOTHERFUCKERS. They made a song that made the lil dumb thing in my brain go "LOOP! IT! LOOP! IT! LOOP! IT!" (Which I later found out would also apply to "Illusion", even if I hated that one at first lol). Yeah sure this still has all that dumb fucking lore junk in it but come on, you know you love fucking screaming out "MY N√ÜVIS WE LOVE YOU". If not then... Come on... yelling out "I'M GOING TO KWANGYA, GAME IN" is also a top moment. Anyways in a post-"Girls" world, this is still their best title and I will defend it with all my might. (Now if we could just use their newly found even higher budget to get the √¶s better models...)

2021inKPOP: **sage** (9.8): either you get it or you dont

**Cooler\_lin** (9.5): when i first heard this song i thought that i would hate the start of the second verse but now its one of my favorite parts *crying* ningning's high note at the very end makes me ascend. followed by the "what?" yea.....yea

**mimins** (9.5): another icon of our time, the only thing bringing it down is the excessive high notes at the end

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): loved and hated every second of making a class watch this during my student presentation

**Zypker125** (9.5): Oh my üî•üë® GOSH üò≥ don't üôÖüö´ you üëå know I'm üíïüèº a üëåüë∂ SAVAGE I'm üëÄ a üí∞üëå KILLA We ü§ùüë¶ HOLLER Hit üò§üëä you HARDER Deep ü§î FAKE üòúüòú on ‚û°üèø me ‚ùì Mmmmmh Everybody üëß looks üëÄüëÄ at üòÇ ME ‚ù§ We gone ü§îüèÉ KWANGYA Synk DIVE MY üò´üë® NAEVIS WE üë¶üë• LOVE üíö YOU What? üò° ~~This song is 100% better than Next Level in every way, idc what y‚Äôall say~~

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.3): charli xcx has been real quiet since this dropped‚Ä¶

**2l82bstr8** (9): idk how well these girls sell me the whole bad girl sound/aesthetic but if this is how it sounds then damn I guess I have to believe you

**agentofscranton** (9): i'm sure someone could do a whole assay about how this is a bad song actually but it's so slay i'm sorry

**BaconShoes** (9): slay

**bespectacIed** (9): this jumproped the line separating camp and cringe so many times lmao. But unlike other messy "experimental" kpop songs, this one elicited multiple unironic plays from me. If you get it, you get it... and i kinda do!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Didn‚Äôt outsell Megan Thee Stallion but still sold quite a bit.

**LilacDaffodils** (9): Next level but a tiny bit worse. Next level was almost perfect so worse is still pretty good and the Tzu Tzu Tzu part is wonderful.(n√¶vis we love youuuu)

**moonagenightmares** (9): winter is a slayer she likes to slay

**pig-serpent** (9): I‚Äôm realizing that these metallic DJ Mustardy bassline songs do actually work for me consistently, but only if another part of the song is very sugary or uplifting to create contrast.  It‚Äôs why I love Vroom Vroom and hate all of the Quay Dash songs from a few rates ago.  On top of all that though, the ending of this song is wild!

**moonshxne** (8.5): oh my gosh! literally introduced me to Miss Charli XCX, and successfully recontextualized aespa‚Äôs entire shtick as High Camp; what else is there a comeback can do? (Docked 1.5 because the production is too clean, but aespa post-Savage is easily my favorite fourth-gen group ~~although that might be because the competition is nonexistent~~)

**orbiteezus** (8.5): bridge is one of my fav music moments last year, idc if they‚Äôre singing about a metaverse cult its fire, give ningning a bigger check

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): ughhh i wanted to tank this song so bad but unfortunately the chorus got stuck in my head for like a week after this rate was announced and now i like it a lot üòî

**Victerade** (8.5): camp grew on me sm

**thedoctordances1940** (8.1): i love hyperpop

**aestheticen** (8): I still remember listening to this on release and thinking it is the worst song ever. Maybe I should stop giving songs second chances

**celladonn** (8): This is like halfway to being great but it doesn't get all the way there

**coolfluffle** (8): took a few listens but again very era defining and definitely fun to dance to

**NotWith10000Men** (8): i love the big high notes and the repeat of the chorus with one girl (ning or winter I guess?) much more prominent. the weird breakdown bridge lost it half a point though

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): shoutout to jules for introducing me to √ÜCU

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): admittedly i have no idea what's going on

**alwayswords** (7.3): https://gfycat.com/FarflungBlondCoelacanth/

**akanewasright** (7): I keep saying I don‚Äôt like this song and then I start belting ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM A SAVAGE [slayage] AUUUOOOOHHHH‚Äù

**MToms** (7): ugly step sister (do I know all the words and ad-libs though? Yes, of course)

**Qwilphish** (7): SAINT NAEVIS! DIED FOR OUR SINS! WE LOVE YOU!!

**rslashpoopheads** (7): The first 2 minutes are like trudging through an endless shitty swamp filled with the worst music you've ever heard but when the bridge hits and Winter and Ning Ning start riffing their lungs out, whew! My Naevis, we do love you.

**tiltheendoftheline** (7): I like almost all of it, but all the high notes at the end don't fit the song imo.

**BasedButta** (6.5): this song lol. I know it‚Äôs weird but I really like the verses? EXCEPT for the disastrous anti-climax chorus come on man. minus four points. and the gospel part at the end? like that‚Äôs just kinda funny, plus half a point while we‚Äôre at it.

**DaBigBoi** (6.5): Love the bridge so much, but the piercing high notes took me a while to get used to‚Ä¶in fact, I‚Äôm still not

**ebooks#5454** (6.5): they put their whole aesussy into this...not in a good way

**sabooyah** (6.5): the ending throws me off. Loooooove the prechorus

**Esh\_Kebab** (6.4): There's suspension of disbelief, and then there's whatever it takes to buy into Karina's "I'm a killer" statement.

**bookthieving** (6): "your weakness, algorithm" -- my comp sci professor

**DraculaWeekend** (6): My naevis, we love you~

**SFbby** (6): My naevis, we love you (can't say the same about this song though)

**LesApfels** (5.5): It feels like they're trying too hard

**ilyyyyy** (5): can't with the cringey intro. the vocals from "gimme gimme now" til the end of the chorus are so good. don't love the rapping after the first chorus. bridge is nice sans the cringey lore references

**ricki** (5): MK PUT DOWN THE LINK TO PRETTY SAVAGE BY BLACKPINK FOR THE REVEAL NOW, THIS ISN'T YOU PLEASE LOOK AT ME MK WE CAN WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER, YOU DON'T HAVE TO HURT OTHER PEOPLE, LOOK AT M-

**welcome2thejam** (5): They really went all out with the MV's video game theming, cause that's the only explanation for the Kingdom Hearts-ass fit one of them is wearing

**Tazzachar** (4.5): I only liked the song after the bridge

**cherryices** (4): loading screen music

**frogaranaman** (4): this is the song Beyonc√© remixed???

**Gonza\_90** (4): Megan Thee Stallion outsold

**ignitethephoenix** (4): this has been on my mind for awhile but we need to stop describing things as savage. Like it‚Äôs literally still used as an insult to certain people to call them uncivilized but so many songs are like ‚Äúhaha I‚Äôm so cool I‚Äôm a savage‚Äù. Anyway unlike the Megan thee stallion song this song isn‚Äôt good enough to make me overlook it

**sliced-peaches** (4): i know the girlies like this song and whatever but this song is a disgrace to all ppl who have the last name savage (me)

**seanderlust** (3.2): is this hyperpop production with a fucking 8-bit dubstep breakdown? literally what year is it

**CrimsonROSET** (3): the fact this is a front runner says a lot about this rate

**flavasavavandal** (3): the most unsavage song with the word savage in the title i‚Äôve rated on popheads since savage good boy

**skargardin** (3): oh my god indeed

**treecoh** (3): it was a red flag when popheads said this sounded like charli xcx. lucid dream >>>>

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Did they sample the Breath of the Wild shrine theme for this???

**vhqv1997** (3): that entire last section was just pure chaos for the sake of it. starting from the bridge there were THREE key changes, and none of them made sense, don't even get me started on winter and ningning's disastrous high notes

**2dina3dworld** (2): this sounds like a really bad Arca knockoff

**ImADudeDuh** (2): this sounds like you took a Sophie song from 2015 and tried to make it palatable for the general public

**maybecrf** (2): aespa has recovered since, but wow were these songs were terrible

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): i can‚Äôt give this lower than a 2 in good faith because i do actually like the verses a lot but..my god. that chorus really is godawful.

**wavingwolves** (2): i have to admit i hate every single part of this song BUT the gospel cultish bridge where they sing about fawking NAEVIS like it's a real entity... this is what i imagined league of legends music would be about

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): again the concept is just stupid, plus one of the girls is going way too hard on the final chorus for literally no reason

**bluetriangles04** (1): upon release I tried to stockholm the hell out of this fucking song. Because it literally gave me PTSD from BLACKPINK/other artist's past ventures into music. Solid verse, amazing pre-chorus, great build up and THEN..... THE WORST FUCKING DROP KNOWN TO MAN. With time, those BLACKPINK songs improved for me and became bearable and even enjoyable. However, there is nothing about this beat drop that I can derive even the slightest bit of pleasure from. On top of that, the bridge is incredibly filler to me, followed by ad-libs in the final chorus that are terribly grating on my ears (no matter how much I love you Ningning I CANNOT forgive you for this horror forcibly placed upon humanity). If I did not give this my 0, I was very well considering it.

**DirtyRat583** (1): aespa hater until they day I die

**Roxieloxie** (1): the first time i heard this song it invoked a physical reaction of disgust in me

**SkylarV** (1): Absolute garbage

**apatel27** (0): Putting a bunch of half finished samples together isn't how to make a song

**cremeebrulee** (0): i wasn't gonna 0 this but then i imagined it doing well... sending it extremely negative energy

**DefaultPophead** (0): Why won't it end?

**TiltControls** (0): it takes special skills to get the 0 in a rate with Sticker

**1998tweety** (9): Yes you are a LOSER. A rate LOSER.

---

**skargardin** (11): this massive emo serve

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): You‚Äôre u/Verboten_Prince. Late 2021. You see a small discussion on Popheads that casually mentions this TXT group released a pop punk song and it‚Äôs pretty good. You have very little interest in K-Pop outside of a select few EXO and BTS singles, but just the words ‚Äúpop punk‚Äù stir some curiosity in your wannabe emo heart. You decide to take a look at the video. For 3 ¬Ω minutes you are captivated by those familiar rock sounds but polished with that K-Pop sheen, those beautifully strained rock voices yearning for release from a life of misery. You hear the word ‚Äúfucking,‚Äù think you hallucinated that because no way is a mainstream K-Pop group gonna get away with that kind of language in their lead single, and then listen in utter bewilderment as you hear them say the word ‚Äúfucking‚Äù again. You can‚Äôt take your eyes off the boy with the shaggy gray-highlighted hair, his charisma, his anger, his immaculately sculpted face. You decide you're going to marry him. You listen to the rest of their album, non-stop bop after bop, rock and pop and hip-hop and whatever the fuck Dubaddu is. You‚Äôre slightly disappointed Anti-Romantic isn‚Äôt as good as TikTok led you to believe. Speaking of, you scroll through their TikTok, surprised that these boys are actually weird and hilarious (and grateful that you chose the most weird and most hilarious one to be your bias). You gawk at their photoshoots. You watch their YouTube variety show. You want to see them succeed. And when your eyes rest upon a copy of The Chaos Chapter: Fight or Escape at a K-Pop store and you make the choice to purchase it, your first K-Pop-related purchase ever, you experience a moment of realization. You have become a stan, a MOA. Your transformation is complete. Fuck Tomorrow X Together. They ruined my fucking life.

**2l82bstr8** (10): if you listen to it long enough the phrase "love with a dollar sign is a lo$er" actually starts making sense what can I say they're speaking truth to power

**aestheticen** (10): I love with a dollar sign this song more than I love with a dollar sign myself

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this is the kpop version of creep change my mind

**DefaultPophead** (10): They're one of my fave kpop acts it's unbelievable how good they are!

**ebooks#5454** (10): i would take a lover with a dollar sign i mean hey he would pay for everything

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): slay.

**hikkaru** (10): im so emo

**jay duh** (10): pls do well but not as well as ikily

**Kadenfrost** (10): Okay this BOPS but why do they always have weird titles

**mayolizard** (10): sorry this ate i can see why people don't like it but couldnt be me sorry not sorry

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): would be my 11 if spider wasn‚Äôt here </3 a perfect song‚Ä¶

**PSSST12** (10): Best txt song and my fave title track from them. When that chorus hits, I am a coming of age protagonist on a roadtrip to self discovery.

**Qwilphish** (10): they really commit to this bit which is actually so funny. I need to do the tiktok dance to this song in the rain one day for the full fantasy

**ricki** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/825800601215565825/998372196504326254/20220505_163131.jpg

**runaway3212** (10): as a loser I cannot relate

**seanderlust** (10): this kind of sounds like an extremely well-executed MGK song

**twiceoftheheart** (10): YES LET THEM SAY FUCK

**wavingwolves** (10): words cannot explain the joy, the serotonin rush, the brain tingles i go through during this 3 minute and 19 second slay.. actually im not done this is one of the best song ever made. Top 10 ultimate slays in this ever expanding universe. No just think about it we've come so far in life, from the first yass particle developing into the home we know now. From the dinosaurs roaming the land we walk on to Pangea changing the game and leaving triceratops shook.. to the cavepeople to gravity being discovered to light being created to technology to automobiles to tvs to phones to this point in time where someones brain can decide to put together different instruments and sounds to create an experience that brings me oh so much excitement and happiness. Thank you SLAYING X TOGETHER for your contribution to society, you will never be forgotten in my heart and many more across the globe <3

**whoisValensi** (10): I too fucking keep it low. Anyways PUT THE UNCENSORED VERSION ON STREAMING HYBE. I CAN'T KEEP PASSING OUT AN MP3 WHERE I EDITED IN THE FUCK WORD FROM THE YOUTUBE TOPIC VIDEO TO PEOPLE, HYBE.

**Zypker125** (9.7): Better than Lovesong, feel free to @ me

**bigbigbee** (9.5): This song is so good it caused me to revise my opinion on Winner‚Äôs Sentimental for the better. I also think that TXT‚Äôs pivot into this sort of alt, ‚Äúemo‚Äù image was absolutely brilliant marketing - they really have a nice little niche in the k-pop BG world, which is currently VERY saturated! I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs been a BG song like this that got popular since‚Ä¶maybe the aforementioned Sentimental in 2016, and then maybe Sober by Big Bang in 2015? more guitars in k-pop!

**celladonn** (9.5): I really do love this sound

**bluetriangles04** (9): WHERE DID THE FUCK GO????

**ImADudeDuh** (9): https://www.feistees.com/images/uploads/2017/09/loser-lover-it-movie-t-shirt_3.jpg teas

**Kayaking11116** (9): i love the 2010s nostalgic vibe these songs give

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): this is reminding me how fun the Y/N rate actually was

**poemforsmallthings** (8.7): they had kpop fans singing about being losers

**BasedButta** (8.5): a bit weak where it should go all out but still a great song

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): Soobin got me down bad

**anothertown** (8): they said fuck in this song?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is how you get kids interested in math. Show this in schools.

**ilyyyyy** (8): the chorus is great btw why are they so extra with the song titles lol

**melody** (8): I will give it to txt - its a bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): mgk but if he slayed [2]

2021inKPOP: **Cooler\_lin** (7.8): i almost want to give this more but for some reason it feels tryhard to me idkk

**NotWith10000Men** (7.8): it's crazy how much of a difference some real instruments makes

**apatel27** (7.5): So softboy emo it hurts

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this may be the worse title of any song here

**IsaiahTB0** (7.5): Big step up from Lovesong, but not very strong either.

**mimins** (7.5): lover with dollar sign is a loser is unreasonably funny to me

**thedoctordances1940** (7.3): it's a good song but the lyrics are so bad omg

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): this instrumental is like midwest emo meets kpop and idk how it makes me feel

**chancehugs** (7): Love the chorus. Could've done without the rap tho.

**plastichaxan** (7): this is kinda silly but i‚Äôll forgive them

**treecoh** (7): the tite is cute tho

**welcome2thejam** (7): Both of these txt songs have really promising pre-choruses & initial drops, but the rest of the song doesn't go far enough in that direction for my liking.

**Stryxen** (6): what doee that even mean

**vayyiqra** (6): Taehyun legitimately sounds so much like Chester Bennington when he sings "crying". I can't unhear it.

**vhqv1997** (6): galaxy brain take with that line honestly? who could have thought that if you change a letter in a word you would change the meaning too?

**DirtyRat583** (5.6): this song has the wackiest title of them all, yet the song is the most average song you could make. what are you doing txt get it together

**sabooyah** (5.5): not my fave but slightly above average

**2dina3dworld** (5): okay Bigbang

**coolfluffle** (5): not my cup of tea

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this is so fucking stupid and they try to sell it so hard

**sarcasticsobs** (5): What is this song title? pt. 2

**omgthenerve** (4): HYBE‚Äôs venture into emo pop has not worked for me

**orbiteezus** (4): why would they try this again

**yatcho** (4): im sorry this is so corny

**sage** (3.4): no

**BaconShoes** (3): yeah this is not a group i‚Äôll be looking into i fear

**moonagenightmares** (3): bad year for txt

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): crying crying crying

**bespectacIed** (2): they'll never be day6... btw i miss day6 just wanna include their spirit into this rate

**maybecrf** (2): yikes

**pig-serpent** (2): Absolutely lifeless, they would‚Äôve been better off making a nonthreatening ballad :/

**SkylarV** (2): This song is a loser...

**DaBigBoi** (1.5): I‚Äôm pretty lenient with dumb lyrics but not when they read like a 2013 tumblr post

**frogaranaman** (1): this sounds like Great Value Travis Barker

**jasannn** (1): (10) Upon on first listen, I was disappointed that the song wasn‚Äôt as shouty the 0X1=LOVESONG but that‚Äôs what made the song even more accessible and eclipse the former in my eyes.

**Victerade** (1): never do it again pls

**sliced-peaches** (0): and thats sayin smth cuz ptd is here

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): Basically a J-pop song in Korean. Absolutely love it.

**1998tweety** (7): AWFUL group name but they did wash Miss Eilish a bit I must admit. The song is so close to being one of the best songs ever created, if only it was a little more focused. Give that chorus a bit more punch.

---

**Esh\_Kebab** (11): THIS! This right here! This is the kind of weird shit K-pop needs more of! Not aespa. Not NCT. Not NMIXX. THIS! And I already know it's going to get paid dust in this rate, and I hate it.

**2l82bstr8** (10): not everyone knows this but in a function of x where x=10 the result is always billlie

**anothertown** (10): yea <3

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the f(x)print is so strong how could i not stan

**ernie** (10): (this song is legit excellent, this gen's f(x) and i don't make the rules)

**hunnybee12** (10): we love you tsuki

**Islands** (10): Avant garde in multiple aspects including the horrible mv editing

**jay duh** (10): niece national anthem this genuinely shook time and space as we knew it... the world wasnt ready for these nieces to step into that mcountdown debut stage at 6 am.. they had a mission and they were going to see it all the way til the end. A polarizing anthem initially but once it clicked oh it clicked... this was merely the stepping stone for tsuki slay to prosper and take over..

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): in my opinion one of if not the best debut song from last year

**ricki** (10): billlie is literally 1 big girl group debut away from not being nominated for rookie of the year, but just for this song alone they should be the winners

**runaway3212** (10): literally why don't more movies sound like pokemon battle themes

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i feel like im facing the final boss of a jrpg

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): dance dance revolution type chorus

**whoisValensi** (10): COME FIND THE MIIIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSSSSSSIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGG! I think this may be a top debut song of all time for me nowwwwww. Defo a top debut mini at least (FUCKING LISTEN TO "flipp!ng a coin" IF YOU HAVEN'T). Anyways everyone please support the *only* girl group, Billlie. (I half joke, there's plenty of great 4th gen GGs out there.) Anyways ur rate funfact today is that Moon Sua, main rapper of Billlie is the sister of ASTRO's Moonbin, meaning this is a sibling approved K-Pop Rate.

**Cooler\_lin** (9.9): this song is unexpectedly great, especially with earbuds

**agentofscranton** (9.5): thank GOD they added suyeon/sheon to the line-up after she was robbed by gp999

**BaconShoes** (9.5): epic

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): Um, why did nobody tell me about this song? Amazing!

**SkylarV** (9.5): One of, if not the best debut from 2021

**sage** (9.3): siblings

**aestheticen** (9): A song that does not grip you at first listen (you think to yourself: what is this bad mixing?) and then you realise the "bad mixing" is probably done on purpose and you're left thinking "WOW THIS IS SO CLEVER AND ARTISTIC!!! Billie Eilish couldn't!!!!!"

**bluetriangles04** (9): I Didn't Change My Number; I only changed who I give my 11s to...

**chenle** (9): this song was so fucking weird at first listen but now i swear it has crack in it

**MassiveThief** (9): I rreaallly hated this on first listen, but man it grew on me so quickly.

**pig-serpent** (9): This doesn't even get the novelty of being the wildest Carol of the Bells interpolation (Kim Petras massacred them)

**prada** (9): why is this so camp

**vhqv1997** (9): was this an f(x) demo lol

**Victerade** (9): they dived into the squid game realm for this song

**vuemaurel** (9): Experimental done right

**seanderlust** (8.7): CAROL OF THE BELLS HELLO?!

**BasedButta** (8.5): fucked up electronic sounds YEAH!! when I‚Äôm in the right mood this is a 10 but sometimes it‚Äôs a 6 so I‚Äôm doing the classic in between grading

**cherryices** (8.5): billlie for the indieheads grab-bag please

**IsaiahTB0** (8.4): A promising debut from a group that is gonna blow up (hopefully).

**bespectacIed** (8): so fun. billlie with three Ls deserves stayc's success too imo, we'll get them outta nugudom, trust

**bigbigbee** (8): The ‚Äúalarm‚Äù synth that repeats through this song feels like an announcement. I think it‚Äôs a great debut song

**CrimsonROSET** (8): is she dead

**DaBigBoi** (8): Eyelash better watch out

**DraculaWeekend** (8): I had no idea what was happening but I liked it

**ilyyyyy** (8): 'is she dead dead' lmao. i love the eerie vibes i'm getting. the chorus didn't go where i expected though :/ the verses are sooo good tho

**melody** (8): needs more flavour

**metanoira** (8): tsuki you will always be famous

**plastichaxan** (8): they ATE in the MV that made me raise my score tbh

**PSSST12** (8): The way i heard gingamingayo first and it OUTSOLD. Nevertheless, this is still a solid effort for them.

**Qwilphish** (8): The first time you listen you hate everything but the chorus, the second time the bridge and the chorus slap, and from the third on you realize the whole song is genius. The ending is pretty bad though

**rotating3Dtext** (8): I like that they feel like something NEW

**tiltheendoftheline** (8): I only knew GingaMingaYo so why am I surprised I like this so much? Very nice.

**akanewasright** (7.5): I didn‚Äôt realize that the goofy sugar plum fairy song wasn‚Äôt the title‚Ä¶ this is awkward

**celladonn** (7.5): Very cool and unsettling vibe

**mimins** (7.5): I could not tell where this song was going for the first minute or two but I can't say I hated it tbh

**MToms** (7.5): Similarly to Savage, I have Stockholmed my way into liking this.

**paigama** (7.5): was a 1 when it was released (the mv did not help the song at all) but the song grew on me a lot and that's mostly because of the vocals in the pre-chorus and chorus. the instrumental is still annoying at times though

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): they can say whatever they want, but nothing will convince me they didn't name themselves Billlie in the hopes of getting the attention of people looking up ms eilish and misspelling it

**sarcasticsobs** (7.2): Liked that synth in the verses. Don‚Äôt know about the transitions but its kinda interesting which is a point in its favor

**2dina3dworld** (7): this is no Gingamingayo

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): The production on this activates distress signals in my brain but I kinda like that.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): April Fools????? Carol of the Bells?????

**hanpop** (7): this sounds like noise I love it

**imasalesman** (7): I hated it but then halfway through I loved it

**mayolizard** (7): i dont know what score to give this

**NotWith10000Men** (7): it's definitely interesting. will try out the rest of the album

**welcome2thejam** (7): I think I blacked out at the Carol of the Bells part

=====

2021inKPOP: **bulforster** (6.8): the carol of the bells interpolation is so jarring

**wavingwolves** (6.8): i wish we could justify rating flipp!ng a coin over this but well!!!! maybe if they had picked that as a title instead when it's clearly the superior song....

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): kinda great but also not really

**LilacDaffodils** (6.5): I logically get why I should like this song but I never clicked with it however if it comes on shuffle or something i'm not gonna skip it. I think it has something to do with the speed of the verses. They intrigue but also make me a bit anxious.

**moonshxne** (6.5): I can vaguely see the vision? To the group and producer(s)‚Äôs credit here, they genuinely tried to offer something unique, but the end result ultimately folds under the weight of its girl crush inclinations :(

**apatel27** (6): If only the person mixing used headphones

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): there's a lot going on here but it's alright

**chancehugs** (6): Liked this initially, then got tired of how noisy it was.

**coolfluffle** (6): not as strong as gingamingayo

**Kadenfrost** (6): It sounds like a disorganized Guilty Kiss (stream Aqours y'all!) song pls, we'll get them next time in the K-Pop 2022 rate with G11ngaMingaYo, Billlie <3

**LesApfels** (6): Dungeon crawler music

**sabooyah** (6): the verses and bridge are a masterpiece i'm so upset about the chorus.

**skargardin** (6): It's no RING RING

**sliced-peaches** (6): billlie my sweet princesses how i love u so

**Kayaking11116** (5.5): its really interesting and i really like the major parts (the chorus) but the rest doesnt live up to it imo and also that little Carol of the Bells snippet felt out of place

**alwayswords** (5): tsuki supremacy

**ebooks#5454** (4.5): the sound, the cut scenes are really confusing me

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): i truly want to like this but this goes nowhere - the futuristic elements are cool though!

**frogaranaman** (4): yas giving "Single Ladies" except not

**hikkaru** (4): this is weird as hell i will just stream fl!pping a coin (bsoty [b side of the year]) instead

**moonagenightmares** (4): it was jarring and interesting on first listen but it gets tiring fast

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): i don‚Äôt like this song lol but i will say that in terms of both music and art direction, billlie are definitely one of the most interesting groups to come out of this gen

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): This song sounds‚Ä¶ painful

**orbiteezus** (3.5): i‚Äôve listened to this song a couple times since it was released and it always hurts my ears, the mixing is so weird

**ImADudeDuh** (3): new taylor to old taylor

**kyrgyzzephyr** (3): i find this rly jarring, there's a lot going on with the melodies and i don't think any of it gels

**rslashpoopheads** (3): ginga minga no

**Zypker125** (2.5): Ah yes, another one of these K-Pop songs that people Stockholm Syndrome themselves into liking.

**cosmicneve** (1): I scrobbled this song 100+ times in December 2021, this is the first time I have listened to it since. I think I was extremely seasonally depressed because this song is almost abhorrent.

**maybecrf** (1): mama this is garbage

**vayyiqra** (1): Wow I hate this! This is repetitive and abrasive and in-your-face and not in an enjoyable way like "Savage"! The short little interpolation of "Carol of the Bells" is weird and silly as well. Also this is petty but purposefully misspelled names annoy me. Anyway I skip this every time it comes on the playlist. r1ng x r1ng cancels to 1 x 1 = 1 it's just math

**ignitethephoenix** (0): Billie Eilish outsold greatly

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): I can‚Äôt give this a 10 because it is not a 10 even though I ride for these girls. It‚Äôs a great song with little room for complaint so it deserves a 9 even though it‚Äôs a bit mild for a Red Velvet title.

**1998tweety** (7): She‚Äôs cute.

---

**anothertown** (10): LA DI DA - DU BA BA DI DA

**hikkaru** (10): idgaf if it's basic IDGAF! it's so catchy and fun

**IsaiahTB0** (10): Deserved to be a pride anthem. Weddings, graduations, funerals.

**Jhe116** (10): You know what‚Äôs the best way to comeback from a scandal involving bullying a woman? Release a women‚Äôs empowerment song

**Kadenfrost** (10): Many thought this was boring but I found it to be a really lovely Red Velvet title track. Love the song's message despite how corny it can be

**LesApfels** (10): I love how the music video is them with magical powers but for some reason they only use them to work at the post office.

**maybecrf** (10): red velvet could have taken over the world if SM let them

**paigama** (10): idc what anyone says, it's one of their best title tracks

**Qwilphish** (10): this song was so mediocre at first but I feel like it just gets better and better and better with each listen its wild. Now it is so iconic

**vayyiqra** (10): This isn't my favourite song from this mini (I like "Pose" and "Better Be" more) but I am something of a ReveLuv and this is really fun so I have no qualms about 10ing it too.

**sage** (9.7): generic but great

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): this is what I remember Spica sounding like

**BaconShoes** (9.5): major bop alert

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): queens and kings? omg that's like ava max who is being rated and extensions are due today!! (if this doesn't make day 3 i will be disappointed for 2 reasons now)

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): outsold ava max

**cofie** (9): not gonna act like I didnt spam this song last year I love it

**Kayaking11116** (9): addicting, took me a few listens to really like it though

**orbiteezus** (9): its not really unique or groundbreaking or anything for their discog but its such a pleasant song so‚Ä¶idk i love it

**rslashpoopheads** (9): *seulgi voice* queens

**Victerade** (9): if i catch anyone call this song mid i will hit their head with my joy photocard decorated shovel

**welcome2thejam** (9): Doing this after Not So Main Pop Girls gives me Ava Max war flashbacks

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): kinda safe for their standards but so euphoric! wendy said um yall mind if i SING in that buildup out of the bridge huh

**DaBigBoi** (8.5): I sure hope I am never part of Irene‚Äôs ~~tyranny~~ Queendom

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Red Velvet always too good

**yatcho** (8.5): b- for RV's discography, but for this rate it's up there

**chenle** (8.2): ladidadoo babadida

**aestheticen** (8): Koreans went on a show called Queendom and now they can't stop using it in their vocabulary

**bluetriangles04** (8): Queendom was pretty underwhelming upon release for me, maybe just because it seemed awfully plain for an RV track after so long. Now looking at it from a new perspective, I think it was a really good song for them after being away for so long to tap into their form. The mini album was super solid as well, so no complaints from me now.

**hunnybee12** (8): this could have been an Amazon sponsored Pride Month single by like Ava Max

**jay duh** (8): ahhhh day 3 moment youre mad why

**mayolizard** (8): cute but i forgot about this

**PSSST12** (8): Now Im not gonna tank my girls but i am lying if I say this is one of their best songs. Ita pretty decent but boring. Feel my rhythm outsold.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): She‚Äôs cute

**Stryxen** (7.8): ...QUEERS

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I was disappointed with this when it came out because I think it‚Äôs not very unique - and I still think that! I feel like anyone could have made this, while stuff like Psycho feels ‚ÄúRed Velvet‚Äù to me ‚Äì but it‚Äôs solid! and it‚Äôs grown on me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Ava Max collab when? I‚Äôm not joking, bitch.

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): Much better than some of their songs in the previous rate.

**jasannn** (7.5): I believe this was the first Korean title to not have them harmonize during the chorus which I half-believe to be the reason why it flopped and why the post-chorus is the best part. (I was gonna ‚Äútank‚Äù but i kept replaying it)

**MToms** (7.5): Nothing special and kind of childish but I'm used to it and sing along now.

**cremeebrulee** (7.4): just put me in the ava max section

**bulforster** (7.2): bop!

**chancehugs** (7): Abit basic as far as Red Velvet songs go, but "Ladidadobabadida" is cute af.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): you know i fully get it when ricki called this a disbandment song, it fully has ‚Äòfuck it, we‚Äôre fucking great and we‚Äôre going out with our head proud if this is the end‚Äô written all over it

**raggedy-princess** (7): can't wait to give Feel My Rhythm an 11 next year

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): la di da du ba ba di da

**tiltheendoftheline** (7): this is a cute bop

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): Girls, u can do better than this, I‚Äôve witnessed it and I believe in u. (Like I would literally rate this lower if it wasn‚Äôt RV, but I'm attached to their voices). Still really liked Irene in this, as a specific note

**ebooks#5454** (6.7): the nature set looks like the set of Teletubbies

**poemforsmallthings** (6.7): it's just fine which is the problem

**celladonn** (6.5): It's fine but pretty bland, especially for RV

**Cooler\_lin** (6.5): would be a bit higher but whenever irene tries to rap it always takes me out of the song. ofc red velvet could do better but i've been saying that since bad boy dropped, oh well

**ricki** (6.5): im so glad they released feel my rhythm, this couldnt have been their disbandment song

**seanderlust** (6.4): to all of the queens that are fighting alo- oh wrong rate

**Zypker125** (6.1): The irony in RV releasing a song about being royalty after Irene‚Äôs whole controversy was about being entitled

**coolfluffle** (6): weakest tt yet but really nice to see all the group performing together again

**ilyyyyy** (6): meh.. it sounds okay ig but it does nothing from me

**Islands** (6): This song is fine but pretty weak for their standards considering its insanely safe and I loved RV for having such unique title tracks, even when they were so divisive

**rotating3Dtext** (6): I can‚Äôt explain it, but this is like a parody of what Red Velvet is about

**sabooyah** (6): slightly above average but pretty forgettable?

**sliced-peaches** (6): songs cute i suppose

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): this is cute but boring

**mimins** (5.5): it's cute but that's about it

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): sounds generic

**pig-serpent** (5.5): I was excited for this song because I really don‚Äôt like Red Velvet and wanted to see how much of a mess this song would be, only for it to be a pleasant in-one-ear song.

2021inKPOP: **b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): for whatever reason i just don't get anything from this song

**BasedButta** (5): the blandest shit ever. a shame as I can‚Äôt even hate it, it‚Äôs so incompetent at being a song but also so innofensive

**MassiveThief** (5): meh. I kinda expected something more aggressive for a song called "Queendom"

**melody** (5): fine

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): it‚Äôs not a bad song but like‚Ä¶what an underwhelming comeback this was nnn

**moonshxne** (5): as a Reveluv, this one hurt (which is kind of funny because the actual song is so toothless) :(

**mrach** (5): anyone remember when jeff benjamin posted the chorus to this song on twitter and reveluvs ratioed him and called him misogynist no just me

**skargardin** (5): they can do way better as they would prove with Feel My Rhythm

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): https://youtu.be/ZAKJBfqOxSw she outsold

**Esh\_Kebab** (4.7): After the Irene scandal, this is probably the safest comeback they could have done. Also probably the most boring.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4.2): they got out of a 1.5 year hiatus just to do an airpods commercial üò≠üò≠

**Roxieloxie** (4): ava max jumpscare

**vuemaurel** (4): Kinda generic which is sad coming from the group which gave us RR, PAB and DD.

**apatel27** (3): Ava outsold

**vhqv1997** (3): thank god for feel my rhythm because i was this close to telling them to not resign with sm. the ep kinda banged tho.

**bespectacIed** (2): THEIR WORST TITLE MY GODDD. ironic that with a song queendom is where their crowns finally, undeniably, tipped as kpop queens. I say that with a broken heart and being a legit former reveluv. From a sad hiatus to disappointing solo releases to this vanilla self-help bland as fuck mess. Oh how the mighty has fallen.... but they did redeem themselves with the freaky, experimental, neo-EDM with a classical spin masterpiece that was Feel My Rhythm so we're back on the ReVe train

**runaway3212** (1): them staying alive with psycho just to release this flop... lee sooman you will pay one day

**wavingwolves** (1): irene you'll NEVER be ava max!

**whoisValensi** (1): Lol no. I refuse to believe this song even happened. RV spent a long ass time without a comeback and came back with.... *this*. I think my contempt for this song has only grown more as time has gone one. Because this was supposed to be their triumphant return and it's just... Maybe it's the Velvet-Side supremacist in me speaking out, but like my god this was such a let down. I mean I'm not big on "Feel My Rhythm" either but that would have been a better "big" comeback song than this was.

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): She came in swinging with a COVER! It‚Äôs not even her own song and yet Queen Joy has defeated half the rate. Bow down!!

**1998tweety** (8): The anime SERVE. Please y‚Äôall I‚Äôm begging y‚Äôall to vote for the Anime rate.

---

**agentofscranton** (10): the best member of red velvet ate yup yup

**CrimsonROSET** (10): vote for anime opening themes

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song just sounds so fucking happy omg i love it.

**jay duh** (10): mother of korea

**Kadenfrost** (10): The song reminds me so much of an anime opening, there's just something so lovely with Joy's voice, just endless and lovely serotonin.

**moonshxne** (10): PARK SOO-YOUNG! What a refreshing burst of energy <3

**pig-serpent** (10): I love 3rd wave ska, and listen to a lot of it as soon as the first heat wave of the year hits.  This isn‚Äôt exactly ska, but it‚Äôs still the big, bright summer music I love.  Unfortunately, the verses go a little too low key and lose most of the energy, which is a shame because this would be a strong 11 contender otherwise.

**Qwilphish** (10): this song will always always always put me in a good mood. JOY has such a pretty voice, I wish it was used more often in RV

**runaway3212** (10): i just know joy would never cancel her las vegas residency

**seanderlust** (10): https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hyrhIBebZsg/hqdefault.jpg

**thedoctordances1940** (10): "Hello" is a single from 1986 Album Hello by Austrian Italo-Disco band Joy.

**TiltControls** (10): This sounds like it came right out of a 2000s movie intro in the best way

**vhqv1997** (10): interesting choice having joy's solo here but not wendy's, i don't mind it though because joy's debut was far better than anything irene, seulgi, and wendy did

**whoisValensi** (10): Honestly stop what you're doing and go listen to this entire mini-album right now. Just fucking pure sunshine and rainbows in musical form.

**xxipil0ts** (10): - this is what it means to get out of SM's basement

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): INJECT THE S-CLUB7-CORE STRAIGHT INTO MY VEINS

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Now this is a nice change of pace!

**jasannn** (9): the best possible concept for her. it screams Joy

**poemforsmallthings** (9): such a fun solo debut

**Stryxen** (9): hi

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): vote for the anime rate

**Roxieloxie** (8.7): for a song named hello, this has very strong 'ending theme' music for some sort of media

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): if the shitpost isnt her fanboy im suing

**bigbigbee** (8.5): some of the best teasers I‚Äôve seen in a while. started the Y2K revival, ahead of the curve, never been done before, the blueprint, etc etc. the editing on these is great; the fact that there‚Äôs a golden glow to her feels very accurate to real Y2K photoshoots, as opposed to other k-pop concepts that are inspired by that era, which often still have the very pinky-pale skin editing on them which I associate with more recent k-pop photography trends. That isn‚Äôt a bad thing, either! I just appreciate the commitment to the throwback here

**maybecrf** (8.5): this song is just very joyous

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): why didn‚Äôt i like this much when it released omg‚Ä¶it‚Äôs so cute <3

**Victerade** (8.5): she is my wife

**paigama** (8.3): was very good for me in the first month but it now feels like a chore to get through the full song. still a fun song + I really like the vocals

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.2): all i want is someone to hold hands with while this song plays in the background. which inevitably will lead to an enormous amount of self-doubt but i am nothing if not delusional <3

**chancehugs** (8): PARK SOO YOUNG. WHEN YOU SMILE, I'M ALSO HAPPY.

**coolfluffle** (8): loved the aesthetic more than the song but the song was still really cute

**DefaultPophead** (8): Great energy!!!

**hikkaru** (8): this is saur fun. WENDY OUT

**melody** (8): I feel like I would hear this in a coming of age late 00s chick flick movie!

**NotWith10000Men** (8): feels like the opening song of a DCOM (in a good way)

**PSSST12** (8): I think its good and works well for her although I wanted a sensual concept for miss park

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I can't explain it this song feels like a Pokemon (Gen 4) x kpop crossover

**skargardin** (8): bop

**LilacDaffodils** (7.8): This song is joyous. How fitting!

**apatel27** (7.5): This is a slice of life anime opening

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): i dig this, it sounds like mario kart music

**DaBigBoi** (7.5): From the other side

**Esh\_Kebab** (7.5): Joy sounds a bit shrill, but the song is still a delight.

**mimins** (7.5): sounds like a predebut loona track or like a romcom anime opening

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): what sitcom is this

**BaconShoes** (7): ok i didn‚Äôt like this at first, but then it kinda grew on me. I like that it sounds different from most of these even though it isn‚Äôt my favorite

**bluetriangles04** (7): I wasn't expecting Joy to debut as a soloist with a series of remakes in any capacity. This song is vibey and serves its purpose, but is overall not too memorable for me.

**fadedblue09** (7): Cute cover, feels very early y2k kpop

**IsaiahTB0** (7): Decent cover, not much is special. The MV carried a bit.

**mayolizard** (7): cute ig

**orbiteezus** (7): ngl i kinda forgot about this (je t‚Äôaime is better) but its fun, wish they gave her original songs though

**sabooyah** (7): sounds like a musical number that would play to introduce the female protagonist

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this would hit different if it was the credits theme to a kids animated movie

**vayyiqra** (7): I had a comment that it's interesting how this doesn't sound anything like a Red Velvet song and then looked it up and saw it's a cover from decades ago and that's why we always look up songs before commenting on them so as to not seem dumb dumb!

**welcome2thejam** (7): Sticks out nicely. Verses kinda a snooze but love the energy when the pace quickens and those horns hit

**bulforster** (6.9): the chorus is amazing but the verses lose all its momentum

**2l82bstr8** (6.5): I get the concept but it's a little cloyingly sweet for my personal taste

**astrologicalangel** (6.5): this sounds like a warm hug :)

**wavingwolves** (6.3): cute in a very disney-like way

**RandomHypnotica** (6): sorry this is corny af

**Zypker125** (5.7): The Walmart version of Yena‚Äôs Smiley ~~idc that Hello came before Smiley, it‚Äôs still worse so~~

**celladonn** (5.5): Not really my thing but the chorus has a certain charm

**DraculaWeekend** (5.5): This sounds like an anime song

**raggedy-princess** (5.5): I still love you Joy!

2021inKPOP: **cherryices** (5): i‚Äôm so sorry joy girly‚Ä¶

**ebooks#5454** (5): pls...enough cultural appropriation in kpop...also why was that child actor so bad she didn't even smile when she reunites with the dilf at the end what gives :sob:

**ilyyyyy** (5): my favorite voice in red velvet, bummed that i didnt dig her debut

**nicolas** (5): serving high school musical soundtrack :heart_eyes:

**ricki** (5): song that plays while the credits roll on a childrens movie

**sliced-peaches** (5): this song is cute i guess

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I didn‚Äôt do this rate to listen to fucking showtunes

**Cooler\_lin** (4.9): i was hoping she was going to pop her pussy but then she gave us this *crying*

**BasedButta** (4.5): this, while still not being good, is so upbeat that it healed me from my rage at the previous songs. I sure hope the next ones aren‚Äôt as bad!

**Kayaking11116** (4): it‚Äôs a little too cheesy for me

**MassiveThief** (4): it's cute... but like, TOO cute. After hearing it a bunch it just feels like diabetes.

**sarcasticsobs** (3): Oh, oh no, this is *not* for me

**aestheticen** (2): I don't like her voice in this and I also hate brass instruments. So.

**bespectacIed** (2): SOOOO vanilla. A main slayer like joy deserves better than this bland, juvenile as shit song. Like I am madddd. SM couldn't have given her a femme fatale RnB cut from the SNSD/fx/RV archives??

**1998tweety** (7): One day‚Ä¶

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): It‚Äôs nowhere nearly as good as the other song they have on this rate. Kinda just went in one ear and out the other.

---

**tiltheendoftheline** (11): my favorite SVT title track, I can't understand why it's treated like dirt.

**aestheticen** (10): They showered themselves with water from the father lake this comeback

**bluetriangles04** (10): YOU GIVE ME PURPOSE!

**fadedblue09** (10): Vocal unit snapped here. Also that Joshua/DK intro >>>>

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this whops actually‚Ä¶ kinda makes me emotional??

**jay duh** (10): dino.. lemme give you a kiss

**mayolizard** (10): THIS WAS SOOOO FUCKING GOOD???? IVE LISTENED TO THIS SONG LIKE 500 TIMES

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): ready to love defender checking in

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I really thought they were gonna pop that giant ball in the MV like it was a balloon, very dissapointed

**wavingwolves** (10): this is good and carats are all wrong for being dead set on hating this idc idc idc!!!!!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Feels like I've heard this exact song so many times over my brief k-pop rate experience, but this song works cause it's pure forward momentum, those two quick drum beats hit like a shotgun blast

**BasedButta** (9.5): this is really quite standard but they hit the nail on the head with that instrumental on the chorus. Like, holy shit it‚Äôs good it carries hard

**IsaiahTB0** (9.5): One of my fave TTs from last year. Such a catchy song, super anthemic.

**mimins** (9.5): I'm a bit of a whore for slightly nostalgic sounding music I admit

**ebooks#5454** (9): i've had ENOUGH of rain dance sequences, i can't even see the poor dudes drenched in the back tHERE'S TOO MUCH RAIN

**Kadenfrost** (9): The mv is a mess with the rando y/n, ugly filtered close ups, and one-take dancing in the rain (?????) scene but it gave us sleeveless DK so I forgive them. The song, I quite like for how plain-nostalgic it is.

**Stryxen** (9): YOU GIVE ME PURR PUSS

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): me in the listening party looking at the chat listing names: yeah I love him with his blonde hair too guys he‚Äôs so cool haha <3

**whoisValensi** (9): Vernon I'm giving you one chance, get over here.

**Zypker125** (8.7): At first I wasn‚Äôt into this song, but it slowly turned into an earworm, like many of SVT‚Äôs title tracks.

**celladonn** (8.5): Not their best work but I enjoy the pop rock sound

**Qwilphish** (8.5): SEVENTEEN is such a hit or miss group for me, about 30% of their TT are great and the rest are pretty meh. Thankfully this one is one of the good ones for me! Love how energetic the chorus is

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): dont have a funny comment for this one so. fun fact this music video was uploaded on my birthday

**sarcasticsobs** (8.3): Head-boppin‚Äô chorus. This song isn‚Äôt necessarily short but I wish it was longer. Rain scene!

**2l82bstr8** (8): a little forgettable but it's absolutely adorable and breezy and perfect for an easy listen

**agentofscranton** (8): anyone should've been the title

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): oh this is actually fun

**ilyyyyy** (8): it's good but not outstading, i do like it better than most of their older title tracks

**Kayaking11116** (8): AYO MY KINGS ARE BACK WITH YET ANOTHER BOP

**maybecrf** (8): i should dislike this song, but it works somehow

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): this song is so disliked in caratland lol and tbh it is one of svt‚Äôs worst titles but it‚Äôs still good!! and your choice is easily their best album with RTL easily being the worst song on it. this MV just pisses me off tho, even junhao looking hot can‚Äôt save it for me </3

**PSSST12** (8): A little chill but I like it.

**ricki** (8): who up playing with their orb

**skargardin** (8): bop

**BaconShoes** (7): kinda got into it but not fully

**rslashpoopheads** (7): crazy how SVT finally decided to start making good music again after like 5 years

**runaway3212** (7): we were robbed of rating GAM3 BO1

**vayyiqra** (7): oh god if I don't like Seventeen then MK will reject my ballot nah jk he won't besides I put a lot of work into this thing

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It‚Äôs cool I guess

**moonagenightmares** (6.7): i think this got panned? its not that bad tbh

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): i wish Game Boi was the a side because I‚Äôd 11 that

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): A nice if unremarkable bop.

**bulforster** (6.5): there's nothing I can point out that's particularly wrong here, I just don't care about it

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): kinda a bop but production also kinda sucks

**apatel27** (6): The MV is neat

**Cooler\_lin** (5.8): cannot remember this song even after I listened to it again ten minutes ago but i remember not thinking it was bad

**CrimsonROSET** (5): all these songs and we couldnt fit GAM3 BO1 in the list

**orbiteezus** (5): the chorus is so nice melodically but i don‚Äôt really enjoy the instrumental or verses much

**sabooyah** (5): generic

**akanewasright** (4): we wanted GAM3 BO1!!!!!!

**chancehugs** (4): Kinda generic tbh.

**ebooks#5454** (9): i've had ENOUGH of rain dance sequences, i can't even see the poor dudes drenched in the back tHERE'S TOO MUCH RAIN

**Kadenfrost** (9): The mv is a mess with the rando y/n, ugly filtered close ups, and one-take dancing in the rain (?????) scene but it gave us sleeveless DK so I forgive them. The song, I quite like for how plain-nostalgic it is.

**Stryxen** (9): YOU GIVE ME PURR PUSS

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): me in the listening party looking at the chat listing names: yeah I love him with his blonde hair too guys he‚Äôs so cool haha <3

**whoisValensi** (9): Vernon I'm giving you one chance, get over here.

**Zypker125** (8.7): At first I wasn‚Äôt into this song, but it slowly turned into an earworm, like many of SVT‚Äôs title tracks.

**celladonn** (8.5): Not their best work but I enjoy the pop rock sound

**Qwilphish** (8.5): SEVENTEEN is such a hit or miss group for me, about 30% of their TT are great and the rest are pretty meh. Thankfully this one is one of the good ones for me! Love how energetic the chorus is

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): dont have a funny comment for this one so. fun fact this music video was uploaded on my birthday

**sarcasticsobs** (8.3): Head-boppin‚Äô chorus. This song isn‚Äôt necessarily short but I wish it was longer. Rain scene!

**2l82bstr8** (8): a little forgettable but it's absolutely adorable and breezy and perfect for an easy listen

**agentofscranton** (8): anyone should've been the title

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): oh this is actually fun

**ilyyyyy** (8): it's good but not outstading, i do like it better than most of their older title tracks

**Kayaking11116** (8): AYO MY KINGS ARE BACK WITH YET ANOTHER BOP

**maybecrf** (8): i should dislike this song, but it works somehow

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): this song is so disliked in caratland lol and tbh it is one of svt‚Äôs worst titles but it‚Äôs still good!! and your choice is easily their best album with RTL easily being the worst song on it. this MV just pisses me off tho, even junhao looking hot can‚Äôt save it for me </3

**PSSST12** (8): A little chill but I like it.

**ricki** (8): who up playing with their orb

**skargardin** (8): bop

**BaconShoes** (7): kinda got into it but not fully

**rslashpoopheads** (7): crazy how SVT finally decided to start making good music again after like 5 years

**runaway3212** (7): we were robbed of rating GAM3 BO1

**vayyiqra** (7): oh god if I don't like Seventeen then MK will reject my ballot nah jk he won't besides I put a lot of work into this thing

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It‚Äôs cool I guess

**moonagenightmares** (6.7): i think this got panned? its not that bad tbh

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): i wish Game Boi was the a side because I‚Äôd 11 that

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): A nice if unremarkable bop.

**bulforster** (6.5): there's nothing I can point out that's particularly wrong here, I just don't care about it

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): kinda a bop but production also kinda sucks

**apatel27** (6): The MV is neat

**Cooler\_lin** (5.8): cannot remember this song even after I listened to it again ten minutes ago but i remember not thinking it was bad

**CrimsonROSET** (5): all these songs and we couldnt fit GAM3 BO1 in the list

**orbiteezus** (5): the chorus is so nice melodically but i don‚Äôt really enjoy the instrumental or verses much

**sabooyah** (5): generic

**akanewasright** (4): we wanted GAM3 BO1!!!!!!

**chancehugs** (4): Kinda generic tbh.

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): I don‚Äôt care if they were fed Anne-Marie‚Äôs scraps, this is one of their most melodically pleasant songs in years! The pre-chorus is great, the chorus is fun, and the rap bridge is one of the most fun verses of the year.

**1998tweety** (7): Idk about this one y‚Äôall. Love TWICE, but it felt like a non-event. Thankfully the album was full of bops so we just moved why by this. It being the first TWICE boot feels very correct.

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): the breakdown at the end is a bit stupid but I can skip it and it still scrobbles and that‚Äôs all that matters

**2l82bstr8** (10): women in STEM

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Nerds what is stopping you from looking like this?

**bluetriangles04** (10): This is truly TWICE in their element, a fun straight-forward song with a play on lyrics and just an overall vibe. Is it their best? No, not in the slightest. Is it still refreshing? Even more so after their journey through concepts over the past year. This is a perfect culmination of mature with the TWICE factor still heavily prevalent in the song.

**DirtyRat583** (10): i ‚ô•Ô∏è science

**Kadenfrost** (10): women of stem anthem tbh

**runaway3212** (10): the dance to the chorus is so incredibly fun

**Stryxen** (10): you might like the Song but you'll never love that song like I love that song

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I never thought I‚Äôd actually fall for a girl group, but Twice‚Äôs recent output is really testing me! I admit some of their songs in smackdown weren‚Äôt that attention-grabbing to me, but I Can‚Äôt Stop Me certainly was, and it showed me that this group was capable of writing bops that appealed to my own very American tastes. Scientist (and The Feels) basically confirmed my hypothesis. The instrumentation here is definitely more subdued than the average K-Pop hit, so to my Western ears it‚Äôs very appealing. But also it‚Äôs so bubbly and positive and optimistic in a way that mainstream Western music just hasn‚Äôt been for years, I just can‚Äôt help but get a smile on my face every time I listen to it :)

**whoisValensi** (10): "SCIENTIST" by TWICE was actually written as a song about Incels/‚ÄúAlpha Males‚Äù that spend too much time trying to analyze women and trying to get into their heads to boil it down to a science when it actually isn't a science.

**ebooks#5454** (9.9): me listening to this song clutching my STEM degree and pursuing a career in not STEM

**BaconShoes** (9.5): LOVE AIN‚ÄôT A SCIENCE DON‚ÄôT NEED NO LICENSE

**jasannn** (9.5): Formula of Love: O+T=<3 was honestly AOTY 2021.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.4): making music isn't a science but twice have it down

**aestheticen** (9): Ended Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and everyone in between

**bespectacIed** (9): We love women in tech ‚ô•Ô∏è Another excellent album btw. If you in kpop and still don't think Twice has the strongest discography currently, reassess.

**celladonn** (9): Bop!! And I absolutely love their outfits and styling in the video

**maybecrf** (9): they dont miss

**Qwilphish** (9): This song is catchy, witty, and unique, whats not to like. minus one point for ripping off umpah-umpah's prechorus though!

**raggedy-princess** (9): Sana's bejeweled SCIENTIST choker

**rotating3Dtext** (9): I love women in STEM

**vayyiqra** (9): I remember being really into this when we played the video in Beatsense but now idk, "The Feels" is better. But it's really fun.

**ricki** (8.5): [women in stem](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852727773214277693/998370536277168229/Screenshot_20220310-002500.png)

**Victerade** (8.5): didnt get it at first but the vision arrived eventually.

**wavingwolves** (8.5): i understood them when no one else did...

**sarcasticsobs** (8.1): This entire album is infectious.

**coolfluffle** (8): one of their weaker tts but the whole album was incredibly strong

**flavasavavandal** (8): it feels painfully obvious that Anne-Marie helped write this but I kinda vibe with the house-y production

**ImADudeDuh** (8): TWICE tried to warn us about global warming

**pig-serpent** (8): This one is good but it‚Äôs not making much of an impression on me.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): WE LOVE WOMEN IN STEM

**SkylarV** (8): This song is pretty good, I won't let anyone say this sucks as a TWICE title, THEY'RE WRONG

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): how did they miss the rhyme between Einstein and Frankenstein?

**DaBigBoi** (7.5): That outro is spectacular, wish the chorus hit harder tho

**orbiteezus** (7.5): some of the b-sides are better on this album but this is so fun and bouncy, feels like a return to their old concepts but with their newer, better production quality

**BasedButta** (7): why so serious?

**CrimsonROSET** (7): you very much need a license

**hunnybee12** (7): i would like to speak to whoever at JYPE approved this concept. why does the formula of love cover look like a photoshooy for CSI video game. why the sudden revert back to a cute concept. why.

**Kayaking11116** (7): you know what? she cute. the chorus is less cute than everything else but i think i was a little harsh on this song before

**moonshxne** (7): on one hand, the girls sound refreshingly comfortable and assured, but on the other, the topline melody lacks dynamism (the bouncy bassline helps a little, but it‚Äôs not enough for me)

**PSSST12** (7): eh. A forgettable song in the sea of twices catalogue but tolerable enough.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): if I pretend I don't understand English this is a banger

**skargardin** (7): this really isn't their best title by any means but a bop all the same

**vhqv1997** (7): the only thing i remember about this song after listening to it 50 times is the viral jihyo science teacher tweet

**welcome2thejam** (7): "You think too much, that's your problem / Being stuck in your head will do no good" Hey I thought this song was called Scientist, not My Therapist

**Zypker125** (6.7): Bring back bubblegum pop Twice, I‚Äôm begging you JYP

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): twice releases the most average pop song of all time and somehow gets top 5 in a popheads kpop rate part 3

**anothertown** (6): when this ends and moonlight starts playing >>>

**ilyyyyy** (6): meh not bad but it never clicked for me

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): when me and my brother went to the local shopping centre to buy christmas presents and as soon as we walked into h&m this started playing >>>

**bigbigbee** (5.5): don‚Äôt need a license to do science, either

**mimins** (5.5): boring but has a little flavor. as a treat.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.2): just rly forgettable sadly

**IsaiahTB0** (5): Meh, boring song. The bridge is good.

**LilacDaffodils** (5): it's ok but the english was corny in a not good way also trying to rhyme science and licence was a choice.

**cosmicneve** (4): Boring. A semi-acceptable chorus just isn't enough.

**DefaultPophead** (4): for christ sake girls, YOU make the first move omg it's not rocket science

**mayolizard** (4): a snooze

**1998tweety** (9): This song simultaneously came out at the perfect time but was also ahead of its time. It was what we needed but didn‚Äôt deserve. I remember people were MAD when this dropped but I stayed bopping.

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): It‚Äôs a cute song but the chorus is kinda shrill in contrast to the chill sound they were going for

---

**hanpop** (11): its what she deserves

**MToms** (11): using my first ever 11 for Twice, Feels right <3 This song sounds so unique and I would like to incentivize that more music like this is made. It is also the first Twice song I ever heard O: baby fan detected

**2l82bstr8** (10): can you kiss me more

**anothertown** (10): NAE CHAMPAGNE NAE WINE NAE TEQUILA MARGARITA MOJITO WITH LIME SWEET MIMOSA PINA COLADA

**BaconShoes** (10): it‚Äôs just so good

**bespectacIed** (10): not this being the worst song in THEE KPOP ALBUM OF THE YEAR 2021. Seriously, taste of love is one of those special kpop albums that shot right to the top of my fave albums in this genre. Solidified my ONCE status that had been slowly building up. A mini so effortlessly flawless. Anyways, back to this chill summer bop, it did what needed to be done. But the real magic was on the rest of the mini.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): invented bossa nova i fear

**coolfluffle** (10): love the summer vibes, and so lovely to see jeongyeon back and smiling

**fadedblue09** (10): their best (and only good) summer comeback

**ilyyyyy** (10): so goooood one of my fave twice title tracks. was obsessed w this whole album for a while

**jay duh** (10): MOTHERSSSSS they did it for latin america

**Kadenfrost** (10): This is what an all expense paid family vacation sounds and feels like <3

**maybecrf** (10): actually such a banger, wow

**RandomHypnotica** (10): imagining the world where scandal was the title track

**ricki** (10): momo drank from the madre lake before releasing this

**Roxieloxie** (10): they play this outside of the beach next to coconut mall

**seanderlust** (10): bossa nova VIBES!! this is going on a summer playlist

**sliced-peaches** (10): champagne! wine! tequila! margarita! queens of alcoholism luv them

**Stryxen** (10): history has absolved me as a day 1 alcohol free lover

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): fun summer swimming vibes

**welcome2thejam** (10): I'm allergic to alcohol, so finally, a song that speaks to me

**raggedy-princess** (9.5): I would let twice cut my car's brake line

**Tazzachar** (9.5): it's up there with FANCY and ICSM, just a really good title from TWICE's more recent work

**yatcho** (9.5): really thought this was mid the first time I heard it but I should've known this would have the most earwormy hook like, they don't know how not to be excellent pop girls

**IsaiahTB0** (9.4): The latina jumped out and we had to stan.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): it's got that breezy, magical summer vibe

**bluetriangles04** (9): as much as I wanted to say I loved this on first listen, I did not. At all. Did that stop me from looping it until I did? No. NANEUN ALCOHOL-FREE GEUNDE CHWIHAE

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): scalped solar power

**skargardin** (9): Alcohol-Free truthers RISE up

**whoisValensi** (9): TWICE are my favorite Latinas! I especially love how Momo pronounces "Mojito"!

**ebooks#5454** (8.5): my friends said they didn't like this song so y'know what fuck them for being alcoholics

**Victerade** (8.5): amazing summer song

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): this muslim ass song ‚Ä¶ thank u queens

**DaBigBoi** (8): Sana and Momo were surely not alcohol-free when they started that 3am livestream

**DirtyRat583** (8): slightly circus music

**Kayaking11116** (8): i love the cute summer vibes and also the girls look so good

**melody** (8): Its so tropical it reminds me of a alcopops commercial!

**poemforsmallthings** (7.9): MOJITO WITH LIME SWEET MIMOSA PI√ëA COLADA!!!!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): God please take me away from this collapsing country and into the universe of Twice music videos.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): it‚Äôs very summery

**DefaultPophead** (7): Alcotest kai trohonomos. Den einai yia mas tromos. Katifora mes ti thalassa, archina. Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol is free. Alcohol is free, alcohol is free!

**jasannn** (7): who wants to do the song‚Äôs drinking challenge with me?

**pig-serpent** (7): The bossa nova influence is cool but it‚Äôs not mindblowing

**vhqv1997** (7): hot take but momo sounds like mariah carey compared to dahyun

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): It‚Äôs *fine*, calming even (Animal Crossing-ass guitar). Bartender Mina during Dahyun‚Äôs part in the live performances is *good*. I like Chaeyoung‚Äôs ‚Äúeasy to mouth and tummy‚Äù part

**BasedButta** (6.5): perfectly listenable but thank god that this didn‚Äôt manage to make bossa nova a trend

**bulforster** (6.5): the choreo where they mime mixing drinks is camp

**orbiteezus** (6.5): alright so i want to fully like this song, the beat is cool and the melodies are very pleasant. but for some reason their vocals sound kinda awkward on this at points which brings it down

**moonshxne** (6.4): desperately needs a more developed and sultry vocal performance (i.e., Mina sounded great at the start because of her sultrier vocal tone and then it went downhill from there)

**apatel27** (6): TWICE don't ruin a song with a rap challenge: Impossible

**celladonn** (6): A bit too chill for my tastes but very easy listening

**CrimsonROSET** (6): the single cover for this looks like the poster for a movie that spent all the budget on the cast and none on the script

**ImADudeDuh** (6): thank god this was not all they released last year

**mayolizard** (6): jyp jumpscare

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I‚Äôve learned that I need to have a higher tolerance for cheesiness when it comes to K-Pop tracks but‚Ä¶ this may be just crossing the line

**aestheticen** (5.5): This song definitely makes me sober all right

2021inKPOP: **chancehugs** (5): Inoffensive, but at least it's not annoying like Dance The Night Away.

**frogaranaman** (5): why are they reading a bar menu during the chorus

**mimins** (5): boring

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): i‚Äôm a once but this is one of my least fave titles from them unfortunately (along with scientist lol)

**PSSST12** (5): meh. Pretty boring from them.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): this is cute but would I ever listen to it willingly? no

**sabooyah** (5): i didn't like this song for the longest and couldn't figure out why but i just realized, it sounds like it would be a girls day song! I would much rather hear girls day sing this lol. no shade to twice but i think sojin and minah's voices and the girls day feel would suit this so much better

**vayyiqra** (5): I have a friend formerly of Popheads (he left long ago) who is insistent that Twice are the most overrated girl group and while I like them for the most part, I'm not getting the appeal of this song. Is it just being hyped by Onces? I have to be open, some of my scores in this rate are surely a bit inflated because I like the artist. It's kind of cute, but goofy. If I wanted to listen to Latin-pop-influenced K-pop, Chung Ha does it better I think.

**bigbigbee** (4.5): I guess I don‚Äôt like songs about cocktails. I didn‚Äôt like SNSD Party either

**Qwilphish** (4): I really really don't like summer twice lmfao, this and dance the night away are such misses for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): alcohol is free by koza mostra and agathon iakovidis outsold and outperformed!!!

**tiltheendoftheline** (4): ugh I'm sorry but this is so annoying to me

**Cooler\_lin** (3.5): this song is on the same plane of annoying as more and more is for me unfortunately

**hikkaru** (3): i can't relate to this song bc i am definitely not alcohol-free. when it comes to a drink imma have it

**wavingwolves** (2.2): i'm brazilian

**2dina3dworld** (2): every kpop rate has to have two Twice 10s and one >5 Twice song

**runaway3212** (2): everytime this song comes on i yawn so hard

**SkylarV** (2): I'm all for alcohol-free drinks but I NEED some alcohol to get through this song...

**Zypker125** (1.7): I‚Äôve never drank alcohol before, literally an alcohol-free person. This song is making me reconsider my stance

**Esh\_Kebab** (1): Remember when everyone thought Fancy was going to win the Girl Group Rate, and then it didn't? That was some funny shit. Speaking of shit, here's Alcohol-Free.

**moonagenightmares** (1): barely sat through this. part of it sounds like it could be in the will & grace opening theme

**1998tweety** (9): The video for this song absolutely served. The choreo. That one move where everyone‚Äôs legs shout out? I mean come on now‚Ä¶ ROBBED of day 3.

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): Sunmi can never live a day without serving cunt

---

**moonagenightmares** (11): i was OBSESSED with this when i came out omg so fucking slayful

**2l82bstr8** (10): the best cinematic adaptation of Catwoman

**bespectacIed** (10): MOTHER. Her best release in recent memory. The choreo so damn cvnty

**bluetriangles04** (10): STOP RELEASING NFTS AND KEEP RELEASING SONGS LIKE THIS I BEG

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): ugh this sultry SERVE! would be my 11 if this rate was based on choreo

**RandomHypnotica** (10): a sexy song called tail? I'll let you come up with your own conclusion there

**ricki** (10): it might be a remake of 24 hours, but that song is amazing and so is this x

**SFbby** (10): Sunmi's at her best when she's a little retro, a little deranged, a little psycho; and this song fits all three in spades. Also she never misses with the creativity of her choreographies - the sensual crawl, the bisexual throuple moment, the leg and arm tails, the cat shadow imitation - a perfect case of choreography elevating an already great song to new heights

**vhqv1997** (10): guys remember when she performed this dressed as jinx from arcane on a moving elevator? god what a moment

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.6): she did it for the gays

**anothertown** (9.5): mother

**celladonn** (9.5): Such an ominously sexy atmosphere

**BaconShoes** (9): such a bop

**coolfluffle** (9): fantastic song, really nice to see sunmi grow so much as an artist

**ilyyyyy** (9): such a sunmi song i love it

**moonshxne** (9): sunmi IS the moment

**Qwilphish** (9): Such a Sunmi song, I think this is actually reallu underrated in her discography. I feel like no one really talks about it, but its so clean and sexy, I really love it in its subtleties

**vayyiqra** (9): Is there a bad pop song with a shuffle beat? I'm just going to ignore the catgirl-adjacent concept because I don't want to get into that (this is a bad joke). No really I'm a big fan of Wonder Girls and also like Sunmi's solo music and like pretty much everything she puts out.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This is what Cat & Dog should have been

**welcome2thejam** (9): A perfect addition to gaslight gatekeep girlboss playlists everywhere

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): furry anthem probably idk

**Victerade** (8.2): i liked it

**fadedblue09** (8): NFT queen snapped

**hikkaru** (8): furry queen

**ImADudeDuh** (8): furries rights

**IsaiahTB0** (8): Honestly this is a bop that I overhated.

**maybecrf** (8): that was gaggy

**mimins** (8): this was a serve

**PSSST12** (8): her previous material remains unmatched but I like the sensual vibes in this one. #BRINGBACKPUSSYMUSIC

**sabooyah** (8): very underrated! she is so hot in this mv

**skargardin** (8): funky smash

**Cooler\_lin** (7.8): just under eight because I feel like the concept carries the song a lot and it's just not one of Sunmi's best

**aestheticen** (7.5): Not a lot happens in this song, but it is decent enough to hold itself up on its own

**mayolizard** (7.5): she ate but i forgot about her

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): :ahegao:

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.2): her darker and edgier era

**apatel27** (7): She googled sexy concepts and shoved them all in the MV

**bigbigbee** (7): Not bad, but you already made this song but better seven years ago

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Damn women are hot.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): kpop fans need a furry anthem too

**DaBigBoi** (7): At one point, I tried to get my friend to listen to Sunmi by saying she was a gay icon, but then my friend asked if she was actually gay. I stopped trying.

**orbiteezus** (7): i like this song but moreso i enjoy the atmosphere that it creates if that makes sense

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): i can see this growing on me

**sarcasticsobs** (7): It‚Äôs got attitude but I can‚Äôt connect with it as much as I would like to. Tail move in the dance is cool

**whoisValensi** (6.5): Truth be told I don't care for this song that much but the choreography for this song is insane. Like, I highly recommend looking up a choreography/performance version of this song if you can because yeah. Lotta cool formations and shit.

**cremeebrulee** (6): what in the furry anthem

**Kayaking11116** (6): Sunmi is my queen but this song didnt stand out to me that much

**chancehugs** (5): Sexy chorus, meh everything else.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): Sunmi washed

**akanewasright** (3): calling this furry garbage is an insult to furries

**ebooks#5454** (2): its giving...discomfort

**runaway3212** (2): I hope her next song randomly mentions a mean girls moment

**Zypker125** (1.8): 24 Hours wasn‚Äôt even a good song, why bother trying to replicate it

**Roxieloxie** (1): furry anthem

**jay duh** (0): Sunmi has released NFTs!

**1998tweety** (9): Is what I would like this man to do to my virginity.

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): His voice and his abs are equally impressive to me!

---

**SFbby** (11): I would die for Wonho and his abs

**BasedButta** (10): love this because they know wonho can‚Äôt really carry a song on vocals so they just gave him a backing track focused banger that meshes with his singing incredibly well. also what an incredible video it‚Äôs so dramatic but doesn‚Äôt feel tacky at all even though he‚Äôs screaming in the rain and ripping his shirt off LOL amazing

**celladonn** (10): Smash!!! Wonho does this sound so well

**cosmicneve** (10): Lose has a quick tempo, catchy melodies and a consistent beat - sometimes that is all a song needs to be good.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I hate to say it but this is a bop

**hikkaru** (10): wonho just being a walking thirst trap but somehow putting out slay music like this... he has it all

**NotWith10000Men** (10): i absolutely love this holy shit

**Kayaking11116** (9.5): i didnt love the slow beginning but it got faster as it went on and i love that. also the accidental in the chorus was such a smart choice, kept me on my toes, very nice

**thedoctordances1940** (9.1): when this pulls a you lose (it won't)

**skargardin** (9): serve

**tiltheendoftheline** (9): looooove it

**Victerade** (9): his best title

**yatcho** (9): i cant rate this song objectively while making cartoon-wolf AWOOGA eyes

**IsaiahTB0** (8.8): The surprise of the rate. Wonhole came on this track and served.

**wavingwolves** (8.8): only real ones remember how this song broke kosmi

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): the sluttiest thing a man can do is a descending melodic line from head voice or whatever is going on in the chorus idk music theory I'm just trying to be witty

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): this production do be a little empty‚Ä¶ unlike my- [SHOTGUNS]

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): wonho we‚Äôve all seen your instagram there‚Äôs no need to put a girl in the mv

**moonshxne** (8.5): goddamn

**Tazzachar** (8.5): the gay man in me wanted to give my baby a 10, but that wouldn't be fair considering Open Mind exists

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): that outfit with the gray tank top would not be out of place in a gay bar

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.2): yet again i am looking respectfully O_O

**sarcasticsobs** (8.1): This is the thirst trap guy, right? (Never mind, I watched the video, it is) Makes sense why the start to the chorus is sensual. Surprise strings near the end!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.1): hope i dont sound insane by saying this kinda sounds like the weeknd

**BaconShoes** (8): catchy bop

**mayolizard** (8): put them tiddies away

**MToms** (8): Sorry i'm not over Blinding-Lights-core

**plastichaxan** (8): i was mesmerized with the video he knew what he was doing

**vayyiqra** (8): An underrated song I haven't seen anyone talk about. Sad! This will be robbed I bet.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Thank God Wonho is hot. I don't mean that as an insult or anything, I still think his music slaps, but I don't think we as a society can thank God enough for making Wonho hot

**vhqv1997** (8): manwhore summer

**akanewasright** (7): giving this a high enough score so that he doesn‚Äôt see this and block me before I‚Äôve had my chance

**bigbigbee** (7): Wonho‚Äôs thirst traps makes me roll my eyes (I totally respect people who are into it, but it‚Äôs sooooooooooo not my style), so I wasn‚Äôt expecting his music to be actually good, but this is really nice!

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): we love a thot!

**cremeebrulee** (7): you so motherfuckin dangerous

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this sounds like a charlie puth song (compliment?)

**ebooks#5454** (7): i've heard this is the man whore of kpop? and i think that's great i think he should keep going

**ilyyyyy** (7): the instrumental is nice. it gets a bit repetitive.

**jay duh** (7): yasss

**maybecrf** (7): üò≥üò≥

**melody** (7): wonho

**metanoira** (7): lost points for hetfishing in the mv

**rotating3Dtext** (7): why does he sound like Charlie Puth on the chorus

**apatel27** (6.5): He's got that body and isn't ashamed to show it

**mimins** (6.5): the way he dragged some of the words felt annoying to listen to but I liked the rest

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Wonho having good music is so wild to me because in my head he's already become an Onlyfans content creator

**bulforster** (6.4): well made but weak chorus

**DaBigBoi** (6): The fact we have Wonho in here before Monsta X says a lot about this userbase

**orbiteezus** (6): the song‚Äôs fine but im kinda tired of the anti-drop thing

**Roxieloxie** (6): is this the one yall call a whore

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I‚Äôve tried to focus mostly on the songs themselves but what in the actual hell is going on in this music video.

**letsallpoo** (5): whore

**sabooyah** (5): maybe it was better than a five. i don't really know. was too busy cringing through that mv tbh

**Cooler\_lin** (4): this would have been so much better with someone else, idk his vocals don't do it for me at all

**Qwilphish** (4): This is WILD, im sorry but I don't think his voice is very good

**Zypker125** (3.2): He may be WONho, but does he know how to LOSE? Get it? Get it? You see, the joke is that

**agentofscranton** (3): great abs beautiful abs

**chancehugs** (2): Man sounds like he's just mumbling the whole chorus. ENUNCIATE.

**thisusernameisntlong** (1.5): I don't like his voice

**throwaway-7650** (10): I‚Äôm furious about this. I honestly thought this was a Day 3 lock but this was **never** in Day 3, not for a single ballot. #23 is the farthest it ever got. It got multiple 11s (deserved) but also a 0 (undeserved). I don‚Äôt know how many of y‚Äôall are as shocked as I am but this was something I really could not predict happening. 

 As for the song itself, what a massive bop. Definitely a top 3 gg SOTY last year and one of my 11 contenders in the rate. I only find the bridge just a little weak compared to the rest of the song but said rest of the song more than makes up for it. Here‚Äôs to hoping we‚Äôll hear this again tomorrow, as it should‚Äôve been, when it wins songeniality.

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): They only had one comeback last year, and they had to make it work. And they did!

**1998tweety** (7): This is fine. It's not bad. but really a near-day 3 song??? Idk about that. LA DI DA smashing gassed them up a bit too much.

---

**DirtyRat583** (11): if everglow were actually pirates id let them kidnap me üíñ

**moonshxne** (11): CAUSE I‚ÄôM A PIRATE, YEAH YEAH, A PIRATE, YEAH YEAH, A PIRATE, YEAH YEAH, NOW LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF

**2dina3dworld** (10): smash the patriarchy queens!!!

**2l82bstr8** (10): wow piracy really is morally correct

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Johnny Depp WISHES he had this kind of charisma.

**bluetriangles04** (10): I am floored that this song didn't achieve what it should have. Single-handedly bringing back euro-pop into K-Pop??? SIGN ME TF UP! This song is just so wonderfully nostalgic for me even though it only released at the end of last year. It brings back qualities of pop music that got buried in the early 2000s and does it with EVERGLOW's own signature style at the same time.

**bookthieving** (10): women‚Äôs liberation relies on the dismantling of the capitalist institutions which uphold the bougeoisie, in this kpop song everglow will

**bulforster** (10): Everglow are so inspirational, girls need to know that they have the option to be pirates!!!

**ernie** (10): (a underated hit, if a big 4 group released this it would‚Äôve been mn the charts for months!!)

**Esh\_Kebab** (10): I didn't think Everglow would ever be able to top La Di Da, but here we are, I guess. Cuz I'm a pirate, yuh, yuh.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): they gave us camp on a silver platter and we lapped it up like jesus‚Äôs disciples.

**Gonza\_90** (10): GIRLS ALL OVER THE WORLD!

**hikkaru** (10): it's giving early 10s zedd prod (complimentary)

**jasannn** (10): GAYS ALL OVER THE WORLD

**Kadenfrost** (10): They were giving so much c*nt their vocals started to ascend in the end

**mayolizard** (10): sorry but this ate DOWN

**melody** (10): A BANGER from the girlies, a catchy chorus and a amazing build up - everglow we miss you.

**metanoira** (10): CAMP

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): nothing hits as hard as feminist eurotrash does

**nicolas** (10): PERIODDDDDDD

**runaway3212** (10): something shifted when they dropped this

**seanderlust** (10): i build a time machine and go back to the 1700s and play this song from a bluetooth speaker in a grimy bar in london before i am detained and executed for practicing witchcraft

**skargardin** (10): Me whenever I boot up Sea of Thieves

**vayyiqra** (10): This is camp in the way that "Sticker" is. What does it even mean? This is stupid as hell. But it's funny! And it bangs!

**wavingwolves** (10): [person who doesn't know anything about eurovision] i loooove eurovision music

**whoisValensi** (10): I just think every member of EVERGLOW should form a single-file line to step on me and me only. Aisha gets 2 turns tho. ANYWAYS, we all have collectively had the talk about how much of a banger this is right? Because if not, then, this is a banger. This concludes my TED Talk.

**xxipil0ts** (10): - this is what wannabe wanted to be

**starla\_** (9.8): this is camp

**Zypker125** (9.8): Early 2010s EDM had the best kind of music and you can‚Äôt change my mind about this

**aestheticen** (9.5): I love when Everglow does their annual dose of "let's pander to the gays for one comeback" before making the most generic song ever known to man again for the next

**akanewasright** (9.5): serve

**BaconShoes** (9.5): okay this was giving. Very hype

**DaBigBoi** (9.5): I love that Everglow panders to club gays half the time and the other half is the worst beat drop you‚Äôve ever heard

**orbiteezus** (9.5): not really an everglow fan but their EP with la di da on it was one of the first i listened to when i was actually getting into k-pop and i loved it, but outside of some random tracks none of their music really did it for me, and after first i kinda lost interest, but this song is just incredible, its so well produced and the melodies are amazing, especially the prechorus, it sounds like an early 2010s pop/edm song without the dated instrumental

**sage** (9.5): washed la di da

**vuemaurel** (9.5): A bit loud but very fun!

**IsaiahTB0** (9.2): The producers heard Where Have You Been and said... lemme slay!

**BasedButta** (9): pirate sweetie i love you i‚Äôm sorry for everything you‚Äôre perfect :sobbing: girls all over the world :sobbing:

**chancehugs** (9): Great production. Yuehua remembered EU and Onda exists. What's not to love.

**chenle** (9): this is so 2011 in the best way

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this is so bad

**PSSST12** (9): That prechorus has no bussiness being in this song üò© its too good for an otherwise mid song. But its good enough for me to give this song a nine lmao

**welcome2thejam** (9): Honestly so silly it ends up working

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): on paper this chorus should NOT work

**LilacDaffodils** (8.7): LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): my calc teacher showing us stand and deliver on 123movies

**Jhe116** (8.5): r/kpop can hate but this is literally their best title track; never understand why the reductive La Di Flop got so many love

**paigama** (8.5): cause im a pirate

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): Is this what you all mean when you call things ‚Äúcamp‚Äù? Idk, there‚Äôs parts of a ‚Äúgood‚Äù song in here (the ‚Äúall the way, all the way, all the way‚Äù part) and it reminds me of earlier kpop, so I appreciate that, but I can‚Äôt get into the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a pirate yuh yuh‚Äù part, though it‚Äôs not *bad*, I‚Äôm just being difficult, I guess. Cackling at EU‚Äôs ‚Äúshiver me timbers‚Äù. It‚Äôs no ‚ÄúLA DI DA‚Äù. Edit 3 days later: Okay, I watched the video and performance video, and oh god, it‚Äôs growing on me so much, but I‚Äôm keeping the prior comments for accountability. Onda got lines! Plural!

**vhqv1997** (8.5): noise rarely sounds this good

**Victerade** (8.5): they slayed

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): this is so bad

=====

2021inKPOP: **bespectacIed** (8): overhated!! so sad they fell off, this was a modernized, watered down SNSD japanese release. Yes I stand by that. The hook is so-so, i admit

**coolfluffle** (8): a little repetitive but i LOVE LOVE LOVE the instrumentals

**ignitethephoenix** (8): everglow never misses for me I swear

**ilyyyyy** (8): this song is so funny and it sounds pretty good too, gangnam style vibes

**jay duh** (8): when mia said "gonna be mad loonatic" she was directly referencing february 5th 2020

**kyrgyzzephyr** (8): i wasn‚Äôt sold on this at first but shiver me timbers it‚Äôs an anthem

**milkywayinradius** (8): CUZ I'M A PIRATE YEA YEA. this is going on my gym playlist lolll

**pig-serpent** (8): It's a good song but I am immeasurably let down by the lack of swashbuckleiness in both the song and video.

**sliced-peaches** (8): this song went number one on my phone and has ten weeks on the sliced peaches hot wunhunned

**treecoh** (8): everglow make a diff song challenge

**yatcho** (8): stupid song tbh but it's very fun and campy

**celladonn** (7.5): Borders on being annoying but ends up being campy fun instead

**DraculaWeekend** (7.5): This song had me so conflicted. If it sounded like the prechorus, first half of the chorus, and bridge, it would be a 10.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): diet how you like that

**cosmicneve** (7): I think that Everglow have found their niche, which is releasing songs somewhat in the style of early 2010s European EDM.

**flavasavavandal** (7): it‚Äôs literally Gentleman by Psy but with feminism(?)

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.7): they all look good tho

**anothertown** (6.5): you could tell me this came out any given year between 2010 and now and i would believe you

**ebooks#5454** (6.5): THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO PIRATE AESTHETICS IN THIS WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK WHATS THE FUCKING POINT

**MassiveThief** (6.5): I wish the entire song was as good as the pre-chorus

**MToms** (6.5): I have not listened to this 100 times, therefore I am not converted into liking it.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): the gays when they lock in miss fortune

**mimins** (6): 2021 kpop is mostly amazing prechoruses followed up by disappointing choruses I see

**Stryxen** (6): pirate jet pirate jet pirate jet pirate jet

**Cooler\_lin** (5): i will never forget that tweet that said if blackpink dropped a song like this there would be blood on the streets

**Kayaking11116** (5): the most incredible prechorus followed by the most disappointing chorus ever. was getting so hyped and then it fell so flat. the prechorus must be breaking its back trying to carry this song

**omgthenerve** (5): I love Everglow but this song was mostly a miss for me

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): there is a part of this song that sounds really similar to DJ got us falling in love again

**rotating3Dtext** (4.8): there‚Äôs so many baffling decisions here, I think I only like the prechorus?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.8): if you‚Äôre gonna name your song pirate you better make it sound like a sea shanty and not whatever this is

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): I blame aespa for this

**apatel27** (3): did they just rip the chorus from another song and frankenstien this song together

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): one day i'll get the hype... maybe

**maybecrf** (3): this song is ugly

**Qwilphish** (3): This song sucks, but the song Don't Speak from this same album is the best b-side of 2021 so listen to that instead!

**rslashpoopheads** (2): why did we include Everglow's worst song

**sabooyah** (2): this song only grabbed my attention every time i disliked something about it ...

**moonagenightmares** (1.5): oh wow this was embarrassing

**DefaultPophead** (1): Never want to listen to this ever again. So close to being my zero.

**ricki** (0): in hindsight i should have done something about la di da placing higher than fancy in the girl group smackdown
