(OP mostly stolen from the [10s Boy Groups](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/nqqkir/kpop_boy_groups_2010s_rate)/[Girl Group SMACKDOWN](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/rvxor8/kpop_girl_group_smackdown_rate) OPs, they paved the way)

Welcome to the **2021 K-Pop Essentials Rate**! Us [3 hosts](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/626601739835015181/919242933650223165/ezgif-1-bce8bcb0cc89.gif) ([u/1998tweety](https://www.reddit.com/u/1998tweety), [u/OliviaGodrigo](https://www.reddit.com/u/OliviaGodrigo), & [u/throwaway-7650](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway-7650)) are super excited to introduce the inaugural ~~and hopefully not only~~ K-Pop yearly review rate (~~2022 K-Pop Essentials is coming!~~).

# But... where's this group or that song? Why is x in over y? [etc.]?

The main goal when curating the selection was to create a list of the most notable releases by K-Pop acts that catered to r/popheads' interests and taste. To determine whether a song should be included, multiple metrics, including local (Korean) and international success, streaming numbers, "... of the year" lists, acclaim from critics and online fan spaces, relevance in the sub, etc. were used. We also wanted to have a broad and diverse lineup that represented as many acts as possible, but given the competitive and fast-paced nature of the K-Pop industry, there were a lot of significant releases that had to be omitted from this rate. The answer as to why [X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLsg9X_CWCQ) was excluded is likely either 1. the act was already well-represented in the rate or 2. it didn't do well enough in the metrics to replace any of the songs currently in the lineup.

If you’re already familiar with rate rules and can’t wait to get started, feel free to skip the rest of this post and send your ballot using [**THIS LINK**](https://tinyurl.com/3pf7ts4m) \- this is a shared account, all 3 of us will be looking over the ballots. Here are the [**Spotify**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4czrMZUMb5p58EI7lrzRjV?si=87f36bd67f9e43a9) and [**Apple Music**](https://music.apple.com/playlist/2021-k-pop-title-tracks/pl.u-RRbV0JxumYV4YZz?ls) playlists as well as the [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLrlWZoXkJLIGut1yWtTBK5qFtQyTFkMr) playlist: we ***strongly*** recommend watching the music videos if you have time, as so much of the quintessential K-Pop experience has to do with the visuals - they are integral to the music and may also enhance your enjoyment of a song. If you ever find yourself bored, we encourage you to take advantage of the MVs!

Shoutout to the talented brilliant incredible etc. Nick ([u/whoisValensi](https://www.reddit.com/u/whoisValensi/)) for the yass & slay playlist cover!

# Rules:

* **You must listen to and assign a score to EVERY song listed.** If your ballot is missing any scores it will not be eligible and you'll be sent a message asking you to fill in the missing scores.
* **Each song should be assigned a score between 1 to 10.** Decimals up to one point are allowed but any further is a no-no – 9.9 is fine, but 9.99 is not.
* **You can use ONE 0 and ONE 11 for the entirety of the rate, for your least favorite and most favorite song respectively** \- they are **optional but** ***HIGHLY*** **encouraged** if you feel some type of way about any given song! **Comments are also very encouraged** but not required for such scores.
* **Please be sure to submit your scores using the prepared message format linked** [**here**](https://tinyurl.com/3pf7ts4m), it makes it infinitely easier for us to record your scores using the rate machine program. **
* **Comments are encouraged and much appreciated** (but not required) and can be added to any song by simply typing after the numerical score, like so:

>TOMORROW X TOGETHER - 0X1=LOVESONG (I Know I Love You) feat. Seori: 0 well 0x1=0 so... **

**\*\* This is the ONLY correct way to format a comment**. Please do not include colons (ex. 10: I stan!), dashes (ex. 1 - ?), or any other symbol after your score/before your comment as it breaks the program.

* **DO NOT SABOTAGE!** Hopefully this shouldn’t be a problem as we trust you guys ~~(famous last words)~~ but we reserve the right to reject your ballot + ask you to change your scores and/or leave comments, especially for scores on the low end. Ultimately, please just rate all of the songs truthfully – this will make the whole process a lot easier and more fun for everyone involved!
* Use the provided [message link](https://tinyurl.com/3pf7ts4m) to submit or by copying in [this pastebin](https://pastebin.com/0Fp4drwK) into a Reddit convo.
* If you want to change scores or add comments at any point, don't hesitate to message this Reddit account ([u/2021inKPOP](https://www.reddit.com/user/2021inKPOP)). All 3 of us are on Discord as well - find us in the [**Popheads Discord**](https://discord.gg/PHxMSbxv) \#rates channel (or even submit your ballot through Discord DMs if there is any Reddit messaging issue)!
