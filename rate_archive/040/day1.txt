https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/8dqa66/ultimate_2011_album_reveal_day_1_the_2_for_1/

**Ich schlieben auften, little monsters. Welcome to Day 1 of the Ultimate 2011 Album rate reveal!**

**Number of participants:** 84 [because apparently, 2011 presented “too many” songs to rate even though this isn’t anywhere near the first time 4 albums have been rated before.]

**Average score:** 7.1436 [this probably means it was a consistent, more than pleasant listening experience if you played fair after all]

**Average controversy score:** 1.8888 [if this number is bigger, that’s how much more shit it caught from the voters]

**me**: 1 because fuck Chris Brown up, down and sideways.

I’m not the only one who thought that as popheads has made this the lowest scoring non bro-country piece of shit song in rate herstory. Let’s address the motherfuckers who gave this a 10 and everyone else who either addressed Chris Brown’s presence but could still jam to it or had enough sense to pretty much give it fuck all nil points. FUN FACT: You can learn binary code in a day just by looking at the 1s and 0s for this shit.

---
**POSTIVE OR NEGATIVE, IT'S THE POPHEADS ROAST OF CHRIS BROWN**

**gannade** (10): an absolute BOP despite Chris brown who is trash
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (10): I hate Chris Brown. But goddammit this is magic. The new Rihanna bridge is absolutely killer
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): pretty sure this is gonna be the first song out because of Chris Brown (which is fair, fuck him) but this song goes fucking HARD
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Is this song problematic? Yes. Does it still it go off? Yes.
 
**theallu97** (8): Chris Brown's verses are awkward but Rihanna absolutely brought it on this song
 
**T’Challa1966** (8): tbh still a bop
 
**VeganSquash** (8): Ok no tea, no shade, no offense either, but didn't she record this after the assault with Chris Brown? If so, why...just why? I mean, she can do whatever she wants to do, but it just seems weird to me that she'd work with him again? Please correct me if I'm wrong and this was before the assault happened.
 
**dropthehammer11** (7): a bop is a bop so i still like this song and will score it accordingly, but yikes
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6): what I like: it’s full length now and still slaps and it’s the ultimate twerk anthem. What I don’t like: Chris brown These end up cancelling each other out and it still gets the same score as before
 
**DraculaWeekend** (5): You know why
 
**Raykel** (5): So conflicted, but problematics aside, Chris still brings the song down
 
**twat\_brained** (3.7): This one is marginally better than its first iteration, but only because Chris brings something to it. He doesn't bring anything that I like, nor do I see this as anything but a fillery mess. Honestly, the amount of times  the word "cake" in said in this song will most likely rival this song's final score when the reveal time comes🤣🤣
 
**KarenTheCockpitPilot** (3.5): i'm gonna be honest i didn't listen to this i just subtracted .5 from my score
 
**melodyllic\_** (3): cancelled
 
**rotating3Dtext** (2): oh honey no
 
**saucymac** (2): giving it a score because the song isnt bad but its problematic
 
**skargardin** (2): This will probably be the first one to go, and rightfully so.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (1.5): at least it's a complete song now and there are PARTS of rihanna's new verse that are redeemable. obviously there's some pretty :sis: baggage now though
 
**acedino** (1): Ew.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (1): chris brown disappear challenge
 
**Elitefourbrad** (1): Ew Chris Brown.
 
**Hogwartsreject1912** (1): Chris Brown saying "give it to her in the worst way can’t wait to blow her candles out" and just being around her is enough to warrant a 0, but this is the bonus rate unfortunately.
 
**izeasklapaucius** (1): eugh
 
**jordnyan** (1): (stupid GIRL)
 
**Leixander** (1): A mistake.
 
**awryj** (0): lmao
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (0): ugh
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (0): God, this was a very gross collab. I don't know what Rihanna was thinking.
 
**InfernalSolstice** (0): why are we rating this lmao, 0.1 average incoming, anyways i thought it was a bit too short at first but apparently brevity helped it, this is way way way too long for the content it has and chris brown is actually awful in it
 
**jamesfog** (0): Yikes
 
**JunkyGS** (0): Fuck Chris Brown
 
**kromosol** (0): I'm gonna give this a 0 just because of Chris Brown.
 
**letsallpoo** (0): lol
 
**milkywayradius** (0): chris clown is gross and ruins birthday cakes. I hope this song gets average rating of zero
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (0): no
 
**nooodisaster** (0): I can't listen to "No Air" anymore because of you.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (0): I actually find this remix to be kind of decent, but I'm giving it a low score because I find the idea of Rihanna collaborating with Chris Brown to be really sick. And, just to make this clear, I totally approve of choosing to forgive people who've abused you, if you're capable of that, but forgiveness is not the same as reconciliation. It's okay to pursue the former, but the latter is never going to end well. Never. Just a PSA.
 
**piccprincess** (0): No.
 
**RandomRocketKat** (0): made a bad song even way worse
 
**robbiec\_** (0): HA WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY
 
**Shipsinker22** (0): Holy Crap. I already disliked the original version but this is just a steaming pile of something i dont want to describe. This song saved Big Fat Bass by Britney from being a 0 because this deserved it more. When I saw that Chris Brown was on it I almost wanted to skip it and just lie about the score but holy crap i wish thats what I did instead. I wish i never heard this flop of a song, I wish Chris Brown would be cancelled already, and I wish this song never ever enters streaming services so that i dont even have an urge to torture myself again. I'd rather play will.i.am saying Big Fat Bass louder and louder for 10 years until i go completely deaf than even remember this attack against america and the world
 
**stardustanddinos** (0): It goes hard, but Chris Brown. No. The lyrics kinda suck and are creepy too.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (0): Chris Brown says he wants to "give it to her in the worst way" and I'm calling the cops
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (0): character regression
 
**theburningundead** (0): Chris Brown is not only incapable of being a good person but he is also apparently incapable of making good music
 
**whatareblackhole** (0): On principle. We don’t support abusers.

**me** :1 will.i.am can go fuck himself for killing Britney’s 2nd wind.

How someone wasted a score in double digits, let alone their 11 on this bullshit is beyond me. At least they explain themselves but simply put, get taste. As for everyone else, The Court of Public Opinion will now review your written statements.

---
**acedino** (11): Okay this song is trash. Pure trash. But I kind of love it? Like it’s so bad it’s good.
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (8.5): will.i.am knows how to get a club GOING
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This song loses a point for the will.i.am verse.
 
**1317093** (6): This song makes me want to deathdrop, but could will.i.am go away please?
 
**theallu97** (6): ,5
 
**robbiec\_** (5.9): this is atrocious but this gets points for not being Meghan Trainor and Britney advocates for gaining weight. "the bass is getting bigger" me on a stress stoned bread binge. William does not deserve the entrance he gets but that's colateral. I feel like Kim Kardashian would make this song given another opportunity.
 
**Raykel** (5.5): I hate that I kinda like this
 
**static\_int\_husp** (5.5): sorry, but will.i.am made this not so great
 
**T’Challa1966** (5.5): I’m undecided if i want britney as my treble but something sure is getting bigga.
 
**stardustanddinos** (4.5): dated/ˈdeɪtɪd/: Old-fashioned. ‘a dated expression’
 
**chipsi1** (4): I'm willing to pay good money to get will.i.am as far away from britney as possible
 
**kappyko** (4): this song ruined my life
 
**kromosol** (4): Soo repetitive.
 
**letsallpoo** (4): i dont know if it's stockholm syndrome or if britney jean shattered my expectations of how low britney could go but this isn't as horrific as i remember
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (4): I can understand why some people dislike Britney's music, but I've always thought that her distinctive, whispery Southern drawl prevents songs from being annoying and turns them into harmless pop songs that are fine to listen to when you feel like doing so. Such is the power of Britney. Unfortunately, will.i.am sucks all that power from her. He's the vampire of this track. He ruins it entirely. And, unfortunately, he ended up ruining Britney's next album.
 
**RandomRocketKat** (4): why
 
**rotating3Dtext** (4): oh no, will.i.am don't do it
 
**skargardin** (4): It’s a bop but soo repetitive.
 
**whatareblackhole** (4): Eh, Scream & Shout is a better collab for these two.
 
**awryj** (3): :meghan:
 
**dropthehammer11** (3): simultaneously the best and worst song title ever
 
**nooodisaster** (3): This is why I don't trust will.i.am. Goes on forever and does NOTHING besides one decent hook ("It's getting bigga").
 
**saucymac** (3): this truly was a dark time for brit
 
**twat\_brained** (3): Why does it take so long to get to the first verse? The intro was terrible 10 seconds in, so why it lasted longer than that I don't need to know. Also, it's painfully evident this was a separate draft of "Don't Stop The Party". This is not a good song but I feel like it can be a grower in the right environment. It makes me wanna listen to "Scream and Shout", which is honestly much better.
 
**fifthchevron** (2): I just remember those awful promo performances she did where she looked literally dead behind the eyes as she popped and locked while being wheeled around by her dancers.
 
**tevinterimperium** (2): This crap song should have warned Britney not to let him produce Britney Jean ffs!!!!!!!

**me**: 1 Britney sneezed on the beat and gave it a fucking terminal disease.

Remember Sabi? I mean, one or two of you do, but still; how do you become the WONDER without the ONE HIT part? Ponder that after you find out who among the sub had enough sense to knock this to hell [even if this is the first song to break a 6 average].

---
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): V E G E T A B L E S
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I should start eating vegetables
 
**robbiec\_** (10): this song isn't a ten. It's not. It's not a 10 and that's okay. I gave this a ten anyway because it sounds like a conveyor belt, it has a ratchet female rap before ratchet female rap was sellable. the beat is filthy. Britney - she is filth. I'm still recovering from Britney saying "you're my fuck tonight" on the previous song. This is a woman who is used to getting what she wants and she knows exactly how to make the bop equivalent of this. This isn't a ten. It's better than a 10. But it's not my eleven
 
**Banananaise** (9): people dunk on katy but she never okayed the lyric "steam me like a pot full of vegetables". (then again, that was the entire concept for the Bon Appetit video)
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): I miss Sabi.
 
**skargardin** (9): Mindless dance-pop goodness!
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (8): I really like the production of this song. BTW the vegetables line is iconic and genius don't @ me
 
**Shipsinker22** (8): this song got an extra point just because of her moan in the beginning
 
**whatareblackhole** (8): Who the fuck is Sabi and why didn’t we support her??? She’s so fun!
 
**chipsi1** (7.5): @frankocean
 
**acedino** (7): Was a solid 8 or 9 for me until the feature came in. I just don’t think it was necessary and it kind of ruins the song for me.
 
**kappyko** (7): this kinda sounds like a gaga song is that just me. sabi kinda snatched
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): DAE steaming like a hot pot full of vegetables?! Aside from that infamous line, the song is a bit obnoxious, and ironically enough, despite how autotuned Britney's voice is, her performance is the only thing that elevates this to a level of a guilty pleasure.
 
**nooodisaster** (6.5): Bop but bad lyrics
 
**InfernalSolstice** (6): not as bad as it's made out to be but not particularly good either
 
**izeasklapaucius** (6): Passable. But I'm steaming like a pot full of vegetables after listening to this.
 
**letsallpoo** (6): "steaming like a pot full of vegetables" is a better line than anything taylor swift or lorde have ever written
 
**awryj** (5.5): i think i caught the flu. look achoo, look achoo
 
**KarenTheCockpitPilot** (5): sabi what?
 
**melodyllic\_** (5): I was waiting for the chorus to do something different the ENTIRE song and I was very disappointed
 
**kromosol** (4.5): "Steaming like a pot full of vegetables"
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4.5): S T E A M I N G L I K E A P O T F U L L O F V E G E T A B L E S
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (3): no
 
**twat\_brained** (3): "You must be B.I.G. cause you got me hypnotized" At least Halsey tried to be respectful of his legacy. Also why are so many songs on this album in B minor? This, Up n Down and Gasoline. The difference is that those songs have replay value. This one is just a letdown.
 
**Raykel** (2.5): It's like if Ke$ha was unironic
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (2.2): #beautiful is skinnier and actually listenable
 
**DraculaWeekend** (2): Please no
 
**Elitefourbrad** (2): Everytime I think of getting tortured by a song, I think of this song.

**me**: 6 holy shit, Rihanna sang the lyric “Lemme grab my dick while you sit on top”…somewhere Drake just puckered. Still, it’s Rihanna saying “let’s smoke weed and fuck” so meh

Did the person who wasted their 11 think they were getting a lifetime supply of the Fenty Beauty collection with the Pro Filt’r foundation, Trophy Wife highlighter, universal gloss, Galaxy eyeshadow palette, the lip gloss collection with it in Supernova and 3 others, that Alien Bae and Nepturnt eyeliner that turns to glitter, the Mattemoiselle lipstick collection, Body Lava body highlighter, Fairy Bomb mega puff [or anything else that sold more units than Rihanna’s last 3 albums in the first week] in exchange? Gurl, explain yourself. Also, here’s everyone else.

 
---
**luckyboot** (11): holy shit this slaps
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I feel like this is something JLo can record as well
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): She’s so good at music holy fuck.
 
**robbiec\_** (10): wUUUUUUUUUUb GRAB ME DIIIIIIIYYYYYCK
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (9): We love a dirrrrrrty dubstep grinddddd
 
**melodyllic\_** (8.5): sexy bopssssss the electro warble is a choice tho
 
**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): dark
 
**gannade** (8): omg a serious guilty pleasure is HERE
 
**piccprincess** (8): thanks for writing a song for Taylor Swift!!!!
 
**whatareblackhole** (8): This is an interlude that’s looped through three times and I love it.
 
**izeasklapaucius** (7): Nice Metallica sample.
 
**acedino** (6.5): Sexy and seductive beat but I’d skip it if it came on shuffle. The only part I really like is the “Red Lipstick all on the paper” verse.
 
**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): Oddly enough I kind of like the dark dubstep thing going on here
 
**skargardin** (6.5): Yikes, there’s so much filler on this album.
 
**Elitefourbrad** (6): Did Rihanna forget to write another verse orrrrrrr????????
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I find the hook part of this song pretty fascinating, but, unfortunately, the rest of the song is pretty forgettable.
 
**Raykel** (6): I'm mad this is growing on me. This used to be a 3. I'm gonna stop accepting trash into my life.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): fillerish
 
**VeganSquash** (5.5): the chorus ruins the song, I love the verses though.
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): What the fuck is this? The production is terrible.
 
**dropthehammer11** (5): slutty but dated af
 
**ignitethephoenix** (5): Just feels like a poor attempt at trying to make a hoe anthem (Birthday Cake is better), but it’s no where near as fun to listen to or catchy as some other songs
 
**InfernalSolstice** (4.5): uhhhhhhhhhhhh what
 
**kappyko** (4.5): brostep wobble dated horribly vocals are grating
 
**RandomRocketKat** (4.5): This instrumental though :yikes:
 
**Shipsinker22** (4): going for a darker sound didnt work out for this song
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2.5): this is just annoying #3
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): make it stop please
 
**Wailordfan\_** (2): I really didn't like this at all holy shit
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (1): im so happy dubstep has mostly disappeared
 
**letsallpoo** (1): jesus christ
 
**twat\_brained** (1): I can't imagine this was well-received when it came out and it's aged horribly. If I find myself giving a 0 in this rate this is definitely in contention.

**me**: 4 unneeded remixes are Beyonce’s thing a la that damned Flawless remix.

Let this be a lesson for pop divas in general; pointless remixes will earn you more ire than anything else. Here’s what those who commented had to say.
 
---
**gannade** (10): ok this bangs
 
**kappyko** (10): my coc k hurt
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): it was a 10 without ASAP and it's a 10 with ASAP. quick mafs.
 
**VeganSquash** (9.5): fur should be illegal, ugh.
 
**Shipsinker22** (9): i prefer the original but still good
 
**kromosol** (8.4): Even better than the original.
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I usually like A$AP Rocky's feature verses but this one is pretty pointless.
 
**Elitefourbrad** (8): Rocky gave a great verse and boost to the song.
 
**izeasklapaucius** (8): yas rocky slay
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Not as good as the original
 
**robbiec\_** (8): Jodye adds nothing but it still bangs
 
**chipsi1** (7.5): i mean okay
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (7.5): I don't think the verse adds anything so
 
**DraculaWeekend** (7): A$AP knocked this down a half point for me
 
**Raykel** (7): He didn't add much, but he didn't hinder it either
 
**stardustanddinos** (7): haha, I like this remix much better for some reason
 
**tevinterimperium** (7): rocky really improved this
 
**theallu97** (7): A$AP Rocky's verse is just pointless and boring to me
 
**whatareblackhole** (7): A$AP’s verse needed to be longer if it was gonna be that good. I’m docking it a point for robbing us of what we wanted!!!
 
**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): This still has the same flaws from the original and A$AP's verse isn't great but he brings some much needed personality to it.
 
**dropthehammer11** (6): ill give an extra point for rocky but still not big on this one
 
**melodyllic\_** (6): is this just the same song but with a rap verse? :///
 
**RandomRocketKat** (6): he doesnt add much or take away anything
 
**InfernalSolstice** (5): asap unnecessary but the main song still fun
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (5): More bearable than the original, because we don't have to hear the bad production outside the chorus, but nothing in this remix is enough to do a Bad Blood on this song and elevate it into something more than listenable.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (4): A$AP Rocky’s verse at the beginning makes it slightly better but the song still gets on my nerves
 
**skargardin** (4): A$AP makes it slightly more tolerable. I still don’t like it though.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (4): I have a hard time justifying why this song exists. The vast majority sound exactly the sane as the original version. The only difference that's immediately apparent is A$AP rapping for 40 seconds at the beggining.
 
**twat\_brained** (3.8): Rocky's verse actually brings this song down IMO and the fact that it just makes the song longer even further deters me from wanting to listen to it.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2.1): kind of less annoying with something new added but still annoying
 
**acedino** (2): Doesn’t improve or add to the song in anyway.

**ME**: 10 no Little Monster or Gaga fan in general worth their weight thinks this should’ve been a single, but it’s super cute [and should’ve served as the Lisa Goes Gaga song]

You bitches suck for chopping a good Gaga song and having it be in the Bottom 10. RuPopheads Drag Rates have fucked up drag. Onto y’all.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is definitely an anthem for the angst in me.
 
**Hogwartsreject1912** (9): I feel like this is a pretty hated Gaga song, but this is a song that taught me I was just fine how I was, regardless of what people thought and said.
 
**1998tweety** (8.1): I incorrectly assumed this would be bad [2]
 
**awryj** (8): a bop for the cool kids and those to like to read alike

My biggest criticism is that the intro doesn't relate to the song at all, so I question the need for it in the first place.
 
**nooodisaster** (7): Like so many songs on this album, the verses are so great, and then the chorus just is... blep.
 
**VeganSquash** (7): this song has really great lyrics, I don't think it's cringe like song people think
 
**whatareblackhole** (7): Bad Kids is a lowlight…skip.
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (6): Good spirit but that can only get you so far...
 
**melodyllic\_** (6): tbh i dont remember what this song sounds like
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): what is that intro
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I'm going to be really generous with this song, because I actually think this is Gaga's most sincere empowerment song and I saw an amusing blogpost once where a psychologist called this his favourite song on the album. Other than that, though, this suffers the 'Eh, Eh' curse. It has promising elements but the sickeningly sweet execution just massacres them.
 
**Shipsinker22** (6): I swear I tried to like it yall. The only part I really like is when she says Im a bad kid baby
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): i guess it's ok for a song called 'bad kids'
 
**skargardin** (5): This filler track is a real low point on the album.
 
**stardustanddinos** (5): yIKES. I get the message, but it’s hard not to cringe.
 
**kromosol** (4.5): What a pointless song.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4.5): this literally sounds like a nickelodeon or camp rock song gfsdl,gn hsdlf
 
**Elitefourbrad** (4): This is awful considering it samples MJ.
 
**izeasklapaucius** (4): This sucks.
 
**letsallpoo** (4): i remember before BTW came out there were some people who were able to listen to it ahead of time and almost all of them said this was their favorite track. when the album came out we learned that they were full of shit. also why does gaga sound like she's calling us the f word
 
**Raykel** (2.5): She's on a different song than the production is what is happening
 
**acedino** (1): Pretty generic, sounds like a lot of other Gaga songs in both sound and lyrics
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (1): i always hear "you're still good to me if you're a f****t baby" lmao anyway this song sucks ass
 
**gannade** (1): unlistenable tbh

**Lowest Scores:** (1 x2) fifthchevron, VeganSquash (2.5 x1) Raykel
 
**ME**: Dreaming 8 shit like Party can make an album but this gets Japanese Bonus Track’d? GURL…I mean chop off a minute of the chorus being said forty fucking times and we’d be better.

Apparently when listening, popheads users were stuck on December 7, 1941. Let’s find out why.

---
**InfernalSolstice** (10): deserved to be on the album
 
**twat\_brained** (10): Why can't this be the only song about dreams in Bey's discography? Why does the earsore that is "Sweet Dreams" exist?
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Getting some Mariah and/or Whitney vibes from this-not a throwback to older styles of RnB and soul like the rest of the album, but it's still better than a fair amount of the songs on it.
 
**1998tweety** (8.3): Another song better than half the songs on the standard version. This sounds like a classic Beyonce song. There were some really cool disco beats right before the last chorus, and were present in that last chorus.
 
**nooodisaster** (8): Feels like a tribute to "Dreaming of You" by Selena, which instantly makes it 10x better.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I honestly don’t get why some of these songs (like this) didn’t make the regular edition of the album. It’s a little long but Beyoncé just kills it again with the vocals.
 
**kappyko** (7.5): genericity!!!
 
**melodyllic\_** (7.5): ehhh its nice but it belongs on the Japanese edition
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): sweet dreams outsold
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (7): It's got amazing harmonies, but I can't help but feel like this track would've been a better fit on I Am...
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): This is fine.
 
**RandomRocketKat** (7): This reminds me of Halo a bit
 
**rotating3Dtext** (7): i feel pretty neutral about it tbh
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): this is such a bonus track lmao it's cute but nothing special
 
**letsallpoo** (6): this is cute but i would like to bring attention to how the description for the youtube video for this says "This video was uploaded for educational purposes only" like okay Drea Espinoza you better educate us on some obscure beyonce tracks
 
**TragicKingdom1** (6): this highkey sounds like an American Idol coronation anthem. Beyonce sells it though.
 
**whatareblackhole** (6): Does anyone else think this sounds like Halo? Is it just the beat?
 
**skargardin** (5): I’ve literally never heard of this one before but it’s so forgettable anyways. She slays the high notes but there’s nothing memorable here at all.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): are we sure this is from 2011
 
**T’Challa1966** (5): Queen of having the Eastenders theme tune and queen in her songs.
 
**acedino** (4): Why does it start to sound like the EastEnders theme half-way through?
 
**Elitefourbrad** (3): Dreaming for this bore to be over.
 
**Raykel** (2.5): Kinda sounds like a bad Mariah Carey knock-off
 
**VeganSquash** (1): forgettable

Britney lost that dude and my interest in her shitty album…named Femme Fatale. Let’s see what the rest of you think.

---
**InfernalSolstice** (10): BRITNEY SERVING REGULAR VOCALS HOLY SHIT
 
**letsallpoo** (10): i love myah marie
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i love this song so much because I can’t figure out if it’s Britney herself in the chorus. I’ve done extensive research about this, but they don’t have conclusive results.
 
**Shipsinker22** (10): the most stripped song on the album and yet still a damn good bop, whenwillyourfav dot jpeg this is what Trip to your heart shouldve sounded like
 
**acedino** (9.5): One of the most interesting songs on the album and I love it.
 
**1317093** (9): This deserved to be on the base edition honestly
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Vocalney is coming for yall’s faves.
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (8.5): Inventive production, I really like her voice on this but I am also a little disappointed Britney sings the low melody on the chorus instead of the high one but oh well
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): not quite sure what's happening lyrically but it sounds pleasant, i'll allow it
 
**DraculaWeekend** (7): Okay this is actually pretty good
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7): This doesn’t even sound like Britney on chorus.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Kind of a lowkey track compared to the other songs on Femme Fatale-just listen to the chorus. This is a decent song with fairly intriguing lyrics for Britney, but I don't like the thought of her cheating and sonically I think this is a little boring. Still, it's good.
 
**chipsi1** (6.5): the fact that this song's saving grace is the chorus which isn't even sung by britney is pretty shady tbh
 
**RandomRocketKat** (6.5): this chorus is catchy af
 
**robbiec\_** (6.5): this sounds like Nicole Scherzinger mixed with Crazy Beautiful Life by Kesha which shows how tapped into the sound of that year FF is
 
**theburningundead** (6.5): the chorus lets the whole song down to be honest, this could have easily been a couple of points higher if it wasn't for that part
 
**dropthehammer11** (6): this should be better but its just alright
 
**izeasklapaucius** (6): Eh.
 
**melodyllic\_** (6): brinty dear you about to lose me in a second
 
**skargardin** (6): Horrendous chorus.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): these are NOT britney's vocals lmao
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): she sounds like she really needs to burp during this entire song but never can get it out
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (3.4): brit about to lose this rate
 
**KarenTheCockpitPilot** (3): he = this song
 
**Elitefourbrad** (2): Is Britney sick or something? She sounds awful here.
 
**twat\_brained** (1): Who heard this and decided it should be allowed on the album? The chorus is godawful.
 
**whatareblackhole** (1): She sounds like shit on the verses, someone else is singing the song in the chorus, and this song is boring.

**ME**: 1 this is a shitty way to close an album especially if it’s half-assed pop-rock on a mostly dance-pop album.

How the sub ended up putting this Brooke Hogan demo ahead of Bad Kids is beyond me. You better have good reason and not just bad taste.

---
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Come the fuck through Rockney! [SWEAR SAYS: her cover of I Love Rock N Roll is better. GET TASTE]
 
**acedino** (9.5): So different from the rest of the album but it really works! I’d like to see more of this sort of pop-rock sound from Britney, it really suits her.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): okay im here for new wave brit
 
**izeasklapaucius** (9.5): Okay this is basically pop-rock song. A great one, if I might add. Would like to hear more rock from her.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Nice, a little more creativity from this era! This sounds like an old rock song, and it makes perfect use of Britney's alto vocals, so it's the perfect song to end the deluxe with. It's a bit on the short side, but I consider it an underrated gem.
 
**InfernalSolstice** (8.5): bop
 
**kappyko** (8.5): kinda serving ashley tisdale or disney
 
**melodyllic\_** (8.5): whoa did not expect this! brinty coming through with a last minute bop!
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (8): Don't know what pop rock is doing on this album, but it's got some fun vibes, and you can tell Britney had fun recording this
 
**robbiec\_** (8): I can't lie I was a bit shook by this pop rock throwback
 
**Shipsinker22** (8): a good closer and now i wish she would do a punk album even if she doesnt have the right vocals for it
 
**Raykel** (7.5): Her voice sounds so good and this is so fun. I need more rock style pop from her.
 
**skargardin** (7): The production drowns Britney’s vocals.
 
**DraculaWeekend** (6): This doesn't fit the album at all (partly because it's actually not that bad)
 
**twat\_brained** (5.8): This one is really forgettable but the outro kinda got me back into it. After hearing the deluxe bops on Glory my expectations were a bit too high going into this album.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (5): We love the princess of rock music!
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): someone's horny
 
**RandomRocketKat** (4.5): not a very good closer imo, also doesnt fit the album very well.
 
**Elitefourbrad** (4): Why is there a guitar on an EDM album?
 
**VeganSquash** (4): this is like a repetitive 2000s Kelly Clarkson song but without great vocals
 
**1317093** (3): Props for trying something a little diferent though!
 
**awryj** (3): why do all of the deluxe tracks sound like a kelly clarkson reject compilation?
 
**whatareblackhole** (1): Oh, this is the worst of the bonus tracks by far. I’m so glad I never originally listened to the deluxe edition of this album. I literally don’t get this song.

**ME**: 7 her pre-recorded vocals are lovely here [even if this song is ultimately underwhelming as fuck].

Yeah love is great and all but we don’t want love set to a song that’s barely above mediocre on a good day.

---
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): bitch me too the fuck
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): this song just gets to me. i know it's pretty generic and almost 'fake deep', but it just works on me. i was OBSESSED with it during my sophomore year of high school, and though i won't listen to it all the time now, every time it comes on it's just as good as ever.
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): A cute bop.
 
**twat\_brained** (9): I'm guessing this is the token Out Of Genre Rihanna Song™ for this album? It actually sounds surprisingly good. I wouldn't mind seeing R9 having more songs like this. Also, is it just me or did Tove Lo take inspiration from this for "Over"? I'll be damned if I'm the only one hearing that.
 
**InfernalSolstice** (8): a cute relatable bop
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): An Inspirational anthem.
 
**skargardin** (8): Rih’s voice is so pleasant here.
 
**kappyko** (7.5): i think we ALL want love
 
**Leixander** (7.5): A wholesome bop!
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (7.5): Meh. Not that impressive. Maybe it's just the placing
 
**melodyllic\_** (7): love the use of more organic instrumentation, which contrasts with the heavily electronic nature of the previous 6 tracks. Still a tad generic
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I wasn't expecting a ballad from Rihanna at this point, but thinking about it it's fitting to insert a random downtempo song here. This isn't a masterpiece or something, but I actually like Rihanna singing over what would usually be a kind of boring white guy with an acoustic guitar song and it's pretty refreshing after tje previous tracks.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): we all want filler
 
**chipsi1** (6): speak for yourself!
 
**dropthehammer11** (6): it's nice but kinda bland
 
**izeasklapaucius** (6): Nice OneRepublic song but it ruins the flow of the album.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (6): the percussion in this is confusing
 
**whatareblackhole** (6): This is a cheesy pop song and it’s super out of place.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): if rihanna was forced to record a song for one those budget tinkerbell pixie hollow movies like selena and bridgit this would be it
 
**Wailordfan\_** (5): It's just ok. It is already straying from the beginning sounds of the album, and I think this album is going to be a chore for me.
 
**robbiec\_** (4.6): when the songs before this were all about The Fuck it just makes this song thud even harder because no one comes to Rihanna for songs like this.
 
**Elitefourbrad** (4): Why is a Disney pop song on a Rihanna album?
 
**nooodisaster** (4): Honestly this song is so basic it's amazing how anyone could allow it to be recorded, let alone on the standard version of this album.
 
**acedino** (3.5): Cute lyrics but pretty much just a forgettable filler track
 
**awryj** (3): generic
 
**VeganSquash** (3): ballads are not Rihanna's strong suit lol. These lyrics are so generic.
 
**letsallpoo** (1): why is this sappy ballad right after an interlude about rihanna wanting to get her ass eaten [SWEAR SAYS: was cohesion on anyone's minds for this album? EXACTLY]

**ME**: 3 this is almost always the first track from BTW to get chopped on rates with good reason; shit is subpar even to the most fervent of Gagapostles…err Little Monsters.

How the fuck is this above Bad Kids? For all those that gave it above a 4, The Court of Public Opinion will review your written statements and determine a fitting sentence for you menaces to society.

---
**theburningundead** (10): one of my favourites on the album, I just love it and the part where it slows down towards the end is fantastic
 
**kappyko** (9.5): oh wow i expected this to blow from the title and genius description and song length but wig is ripped into shreds
 
**Hogwartsreject1912** (9): Another song inspiring me to be strong.
 
**InfernalSolstice** (9): ANOTHER great song that goes on way too long
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Okay, I can excuse this bonus song into the original tracklist. It's a bop
 
**izeasklapaucius** (8): The melody is like discount The Edge of Glory. Love the tempo changing!
 
**kromosol** (8): Nice throwback to 80s pop.
 
**letsallpoo** (8): the second half is godly. if only the hook in the first half weren't so annoying!
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (8): A cheesy main body, but the outro gives me ALL THE LIFE I COULD EVER NEED
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Gaga knows her shit.
 
**Shipsinker22** (8): This one just keeps growing on me. I couldnt even finish it the first few times I listened when it released
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8): Why does the Edge of Glory knockoff come 2 songs before Edge of Glory?
 
**DraculaWeekend** (7): I like the ending?
 
**dropthehammer11** (7): I like this one, very bright and the ending is good, but its too long to be great
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): This is literally Hair but worse
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): isok
 
**robbiec\_** (6.5): the quee eee eee eeen is a good example of that bad Gaga habit of repeating a noise, but the outro on this saves it
 
**awryj** (6): She wrote a song about Carly before she even existed! wig, isaiah who
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Really confused over why Gaga chose to put a standard electropop song at the first half and a Broadway-like section during the next. This isn't even separated into two songs. Both parts are decent, though I'm having a hard time remembering anything else about them.
 
**skargardin** (6): This song never fails to make me smile, but it overstays it welcome on an already long album.
 
**twat\_brained** (6): I'd never actually listened to this in full even after 7 years of owning this album. It is an epic song, in the truest sense of the word. And I think that's its biggest weakness. It just has so much energy when Gaga sings the first few verses and chorus, but the tempo change just takes so much away from it.
 
**whatareblackhole** (6): I only like, like, the last minute of this song. It’s fine, but it’s not her greatest.
 
**melodyllic\_** (5.5): again, dont remember this, sorry gags
 
**RandomRocketKat** (5.5): This is basically The Edge Of Glory rewritten for padding
 
**Elitefourbrad** (5): This is a hot mess until the last minute but we stan!
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (5): the choking part was a choice
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (4.2): this song doesnt get good until the STAAAAAARRY NIIIIIIIGHT bit which is entirely too late
 
**acedino** (3): The chorus reminds me of inferior The Edge of Glory and the “quee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-een” bit is just annoying. The guitar at the end slightly redeems the song.
 
**VeganSquash** (2): It's so boring?

**ME**: 6 its trashy sound is perfectly fine but not only should this have been on Blackout [instead of Radar because FUCK that song], it should’ve gone through more tweaking.

JUNKYGS…Janet is ashamed in you. She just turned your Velvet Rope vinyl into a 20 Y.O. CD. And on top of that The Rock N Roll Hall of Fame just invited you to Justin Timberlake’s premature inauguration. That Rope Burn should heal physically in about 6-8 weeks. Onto the lesser offenses in the comments.

 
---
**JunkyGS** (11): Invented PC Music
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): why is this a deluxe track it's literally a slut banger
 
**twat\_brained** (10): This is the PERFECT anthem to not only slutbop to but to slut DROP to as well! The shoutout to "Hot As Ice" makes this a true standout on the album.
 
**melodyllic\_** (9.5): absolute bop, even though it doesn’t really deviate from the edm formula
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I remember Britney posted a video of her niece singing the song and it's super cute and also super creepy considering the song's content?
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (9): I know this was recorded at the same time as 3, and it could've gone #1 with that song if they had released it like they were supposed to
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): BOP™️ ALERT.
 
**awryj** (8.5): just wanted to point out that this sounds like Good Life by Inner City... or is basically a copy of it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJxJxr9RlKM
 
**kromosol** (8.5): Major bop.
 
**dropthehammer11** (8): this really shouldn't be as good as it is
 
**InfernalSolstice** (8): a bop that stretches on a bit to long
 
**nooodisaster** (8): "The beat just dropped and the room got sexy." Unsubtle but effective
 
**skargardin** (8): Better than most of the standard tracks tbh.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): It’s catchy but whenever she says ‘like kids want candy’ it kills the supposed sexiness of the song.
 
**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): good chorus.
 
**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): the room got sexy
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): decent
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (6): What about left and right? Is Britney discriminating against directions? Okay, that was a terrible joke, and this song isn't really terrible. Just boring.
 
**RandomRocketKat** (5): its just there
 
**tevinterimperium** (5): this song would be so good without the horrible hook. the bridge is amazing
 
**kappyko** (4.5): This is fun but messy
 
**acedino** (4): Too much autotune. Pretty forgettable song and the lyrics cringe tbh
 
**whatareblackhole** (2): Oh my god, Brinty, why??? This is bad!!! And the Up ‘N Down imagery is GROSS.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (1): hey siri, skip
 
**Elitefourbrad** (1): This was a 1 five seconds in.
 
**T’Challa1966** (1): was so down with giving this my 0

Farewell >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Love on the Brain. Plain and simple. Onto everyone else.

---
**InfernalSolstice** (11): this honestly snatched me so fucking hard
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): i love this song with all my heart. i listened to it obsessively when it came out because i had just immigrated to the US and had left behind a lot of people and it just spoke to me. and i know it has no chance of making to day 3 but that's ok because it's perfect to me.
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Yes vocals!
 
**nooodisaster** (9): Sooo wholesome and emotional, and has been the soundtrack for me multiple times in my life.
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (8): It's a good ballad that manage to not fuck up the tempo or feel of the album
 
**melodyllic\_** (8): we all want love 2.0 but better all around!!
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Rihanna actually has a very compelling vocal delivery here, which is saying a lot compared to the rest of the album. It's still not the strongest ballad I've heard from her, but I genuinely find it very touching and melancholy in a cruel, 'I Want My Beloved To Be Happy' way.
 
**Wailordfan\_** (8): A power anthem from Rih Rih? FUcK mE Up A liL BitCh
 
**robbiec\_** (7.9): this should be filler. This album doesn't need a "ballad", and I'm not that convinced on whether or not Rihanna connects to the lyrics but I AM. I remember being younger and thinking this sound was kind of sad but now that I'm An Adult I really get it and been through a similar situation. Hahahahahaha I know Red Lipstick is next which is making this song funnier for some reason
 
**whatareblackhole** (7): Wasn’t this on SweetSexySavage?
 
**skargardin** (6.5): A whimper of a ballad.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): california king bed v0.65
 
**DraculaWeekend** (5): Sounds like a Pink song
 
**Leixander** (5): I skip this evertime, which says a lot.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): what i want to say to this album
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (4.1): me @ this album
 
**Elitefourbrad** (4): Farewell, this is trash.
 
**kromosol** (3.5): Man, ballads on Talk That Talk are really dreadful.
 
**izeasklapaucius** (3): What a fuckin borefest and cliche shit. Makes me want to replay Cockiness to learn how to slutdrop to that.
 
**acedino** (2): Boring, unremarkable ballad. Ends the album with a fizzle rather than a bang.
 
**awryj** (2): painfully generic and uninspired
 
**twat\_brained** (2): Even for pre-ANTi Rihanna this feels like filler; it just sounds like a lousy rehash of "California King Bed". I almost want to fall asleep listening to this. Is it even worth finishing?

**ME**: 10 JESUS IS THE NEW BLACK

VeganSquash pulls a superrad and gives their 11 to one of the first Gaga songs to be axed. You’re braver than anyone else in this rate. Black Jesus be praised. Now for the rest of you.

---
**VeganSquash** (11): can we talk about the synths at the beginning? Oh my god, it's so beautiful. Also this song is amazing, so fuck it, I'm giving it my 11.
 
**gannade** (10): idk why everyone always says this is filler, this is such a great runway song
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): motivational BOP!
 
**melodyllic\_** (9): truly a runway song! again, gaga is turning religion into bops galore
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): This reminds me of Don’t Forget About Me for some reason.
 
**awryj** (8.5): I imagine this is what priests slutdrop to when they're having their secret orgies
 
**kappyko** (8.5): now THIS is the tea! viciously fierce runway music from the gags herself! AMEN. is the black jesus kanye west
 
**1998tweety** (8): I incorrectly assumed this would be bad
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This is actually good but this was a bonus track for a reason. I don't understand why they would mix the bonus tracks into the original standard tracklist because it kinda ruins the flow.
 
**robbiec\_** (8): I love how the deluxe tracks aren't just shoved on at the end on BTW
 
**skargardin** (8): iirc she wanted to do a MV for this one and I was so excited and ultimately bummed out when it never came to be :(
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (7.5): bottom half in terms of quality
 
**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): there are a LOT of good parts here but it's not quite cohesive.
 
**Banananaise** (7): kanye "it's provocative" quote goes here
 
**chipsi1** (7): is this about kendrick
 
**Elitefourbrad** (7): Madonna is shaking
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): this literally sounds like “Fashion of His Love” except that song is miles better. Queen of ripping her own songs.
 
**twat\_brained** (7): I wonder if when Gaga wrote "Fashion" for ARTPOP, she drew inspiration from this song. It wouldn't surprise me, honestly.
 
**whatareblackhole** (7): This song is fine…I like the “ow!” right before the final chorus.
 
**InfernalSolstice** (6): forgettable
 
**nooodisaster** (6): Like there's half a song here that I like.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): pretty messy, not sure she knew what she was going for here
 
**izeasklapaucius** (5): Uh oh the boring feel starts to kicks in.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Yeah, the album definitely goes down a notch right about this point, though it eventually recovers. This takes a potentially interesting theme-casting a religious figure like Jesus into the role of our modern day conception of what a member of a minority group is-and simplifies it into a mediocre and dated song that's not very fun to dance to,
 
**Wailordfan\_** (5): This sounds like really mediocre filler... Oh wait, cause it is.
 
**saucymac** (4): is artpop really worse than this?
 
**Shipsinker22** (4): This is just bad filler
 
**ignitethephoenix** (3): This song is background runway music, but like generic and super forgettable.
 
**acedino** (2): Had potential but just falls flat for me.
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): i never liked this

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): queen of driving a mercedes, maren has been found wigless
 
**Elitefourbrad** (9.5): Britney being Selfish is all I ever wanted. This is one of the best choruses on the album and I love the guitar on this song! Britney’s cocky vocals are amazing here as well! Britney is even showing her lover that she’s in control, G.U.Y. who? She makes him strip down and give him a private show, something that also makes an appearance on another album.
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): I love this production.

**robbiec\_** (7): okay the bridge though that was a Point She Made
 
**twat\_brained** (6.4): The "private show" schtick should've just began and ended here. This one I don't particularly love but if it's this or PS I'll always pick "Selfish".

**whatareblackhole** (6): This one’s fun, but there’s no energy in it. These bonus tracks are badddd.

There’s a really easy J.LO or Kardashian of late joke to make with “Fool in Love” here…fuck it, onto the rest of you.

---
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): okay what the fuck this is amazing
 
**acedino** (9): Come through with those vocals! My favourite ballad on the album. I can really relate to the lyrics.
 
**InfernalSolstice** (9): served vocals
 
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): She is singing her entire heart out. A queen.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): The beginning reminds me of Bohemian Rhapsody for some reason (when she says Mama). Other than that, Rihanna kills it with the vocals in this song! I love it when she does songs like this once in a while.
 
**gannade** (8): im a sucker for electric guitar in pop songs tbh
 
**skargardin** (8): SLAY them vocals.
 
**theallu97** (8): ,5
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7.8): this makes me feel like a fool in love despite never being in a serious relationship RiRi why
 
**kappyko** (7.5): pretty synths actually !!!!!! cute cute cute
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): it drags but the outro is pretty great
 
**DraculaWeekend** (7): That guitar solo was cool
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (7): Wonderful spacey production to accent the mood, but a bit of weak note to end the album. The chorus has some nice momentum though
 
**melodyllic\_** (7): its ok, but her voice gets a tad too screechy in the chorus )):
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Another really stellar vocal performance from Rihanna. She sounds harrowing and foreboding here, and I like how the start of the verses is a shoutout to Bohemian Rhaspody. This is pretty much the slightly cheaper version of Man Down, but I'll take it.
 
**nooodisaster** (6): NO! TOO VAGUE!
 
**Shipsinker22** (6): this song never really grabbed me but when i focused really hard on listening to it i liked the lyrics
 
**whatareblackhole** (6): I used to emo music video act in the car to this song, but this song sucks lol
 
**stardustanddinos** (5.5): boring, kinda.
 
**izeasklapaucius** (5): i sleep
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): didn't i just listen to this song on britney's album 20 minutes ago
 
**robbiec\_** (4.2): ? the score for vocals and nothing else
 
**twat\_brained** (4.2): Nice flourish with the guitar at the end, but this one just feels somewhat unnecessary, honestly. Maybe if she'd saved this as a demo for ANTi and reworked it then it may have been salvaged, but… I'm not feeling this.
 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3): why
 
**T’Challa1966** (3): you was a fool adding this to your album, that's for damn sure
 
**Elitefourbrad** (2): I’m a fool for thinking this would be good.

**ME**: Scary 10 considering most of this album sucks, this is a breath of fresh air.

You know an album sucks at large when a Japanese Bonus Track kicks the other songs’ asses down a flight of stairs. That aside, Scary is really good and the rest of you are trash for hating it.

 
---
**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Insert scary joke here.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): proof that britney should be allowed to write on her shit! invented hypnotherapy!
 
**InfernalSolstice** (9): another deluxe that deserved main album
 
**MeanToBeIconic** (8.5): Ok so this song isn't that great, but it really is??? I can't explain it but yeah
 
**ulikejazz** (8.5): I mean it’s a bit messy but I’d take this over any of the numerous mediocre and bland tracks any day
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): this is fun
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Unfortunately, this is the only writing credit Britney has, but it also serves as proof that the girl can write. This is a cool track with a great beat and even if I like this album well enough, it makes me wonder what Britney's creative input would have been before Glory if she had been in the state of mind to do so.
 
**theallu97** (8): ,5
 
**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): the word "scary" doesn't mean anything to me now
 
**Elitefourbrad** (7): The fuck is that noise in the chorus, it snapped though.
 
**twat\_brained** (6.7): I think she meant to say "invade" but on Genius the lyric says "I'm gonna in-feed you" lmao. Other than that I can appreciate this as a Halloween bop of sorts.
 
**RandomRocketKat** (6.5): Halloween who? Would have made a better closer
 
**acedino** (6): Cute track but I can see why it was left on the standard edition. It’s pretty generic.
 
**DraculaWeekend** (6): This sounds like a dated K-Pop song
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6): 2spooky4me
 
**izeasklapaucius** (6): eh
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): a messy bop. queen of hypnotherapy
 
**skargardin** (6): Forgettable is the word.
 
**melodyllic\_** (5): wow this album's been a bit of a journey
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (3.5): insert gif of Jonah Hill making that 'cut it out' sign
 
**whatareblackhole** (2): Britney’s trying to have her own Disturbia or Monster or whatever, but even the “scary” noise that’s in the song doesn’t make this dark enough. I need full on cannibalism from this if we’re gonna say “want you so bad/it’s scary.”
 
**T’Challa1966** (1): video provided doesn’t work in my country so i’m assuming its trash, sorry not sorry [SWEAR SAYS: Maybe use that for another FF track but eh, sorryboutit]

MrSwearword: Thanks for playing everyone!

Here’s the skinny ledger in regards to how Day 1 played out.

BRITNEY loses a staggering 11 songs on Day 1, thus proving once and for all, her albums at large, SUCK save for 1-3 singles. SwearNN reports the surviving members of the SS Femme Fatale sinking are the 4 singles Hold It Against Me, Till The World Ends, I Wanna Go & Criminal alongside non-singles Inside Out & Gasoline.

RIHANNA fared slightly better but still lost 9 songs on Day 1 meaning just like Britney, she loses half of her mostly bad album as well. SwearNN reports the surviving party of the Talk That Talk butchering as You da One, Where Have You Been, We Found Love, Talk That Talk [the title track], Birthday Cake [not remix and how fucking dare you all not chop this on Day 1 as well], Drunk on Love and Roc Me Out.

GAGA lost 4 songs but considering The Queen and Highway Unicorn were two of them, this is a respectable victory for Team Gaga [though condolences for Bad Kids and Black Jesus + Amen Fashion are more than encouraged].

BEYONCE lost 3 songs [Dreaming, I Miss You and Rather Die Young], narrowly making her the winner of Day 1 [Party is still in so don’t brag that damn much Team Bey].

This sounds like someone who has not listened to any of her albums. Britney has amazing pop albums, and I seriously question anyone’s taste in pop music that can’t see that. Do you like any of her album tracks?

I dunno, I've seen so many comments on her already that discredit her music and say it's so basic and that she has no talent, which I guess shouldn't be surprised since this is kind of an off shoot sub from indieheads that favors that sort of music?

Granted, Femme Fatale is far from her best, but it shouldn't be getting slaughtered this badly, not when Rihanna's album isn't that much better...

deleted: >Britney is not a good album artist

Except Britney, In The Zone, Blackout and Glory are all fantastic front to back? Even Oops! is great if you don’t think early 2000s teen pop aged badly. If we’re being honest, has Rihanna ever been a good albums artist before ANTI? Even Bey before her self titled. And Gaga has a couple albums with a lot of filler (namely The Fame and Joanne don’t @ me on the latter) as well.

Has this subreddit rated In The Zone and Blackout yet at least? Don’t tell me ya’ll think those albums are bad because they’re some of the best pop albums of the 21st century and I can’t have it with people discrediting those just because they’re by Britney.

ignitethephoenix: Checking in super late, but not too surprised with today’s results. Didn’t think Britney would get almost completely demolished outside her singles however, even if she had one of the weaker albums. 

Also I’m glad so much of 4 is still in (and also BTW). I feel like when that came out, the hype wasn’t there as much compared to other Beyoncé albums, which made me think of how underrated it was at the time.  It’s such a solid album honestly.
