ULTIMATE 2011 ALBUM REVEAL DAY 2: BEY-Day
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/8dx02c/ultimate_2011_album_reveal_day_2_beyday/

*It was either that or NormanBEY or some other forced as shit pun*

**Ich schlieben auften otra vez, little monsters. Welcome to Day 2 of the 2011 Ultimate Album rate reveal!**

Let me hear you say heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy MrSwearword. Elitefourbrad, the ballot werk hunty, is handling all things [plug dj, so head over there for the live bloodshed in regards to Day 2](https://plug.dj/popheads/)

Reminder of some basic stats about the rate:

**Number of participants**: 84 [because apparently, 2011 presented “too many” songs to rate even though this isn’t anywhere near the first time 4 albums have been rated before.]

**Average score**: 7.1436 [this probably means it was a consistent, more than pleasant listening experience if you played fair after all]

**Average controversy score**: 1.8888 [if this number is bigger, that’s how much more shit it caught from the voters]

#DAY 2 REVEAL STARTS AT 2/1c

**DAY 3/FINALE TIME WILL BE CONFIRMED BY ELITE AT THE END OF TODAY'S RATE**

MrSwearword: Just like last time, if you see your username, you're fucked as that means your 11 is chopped...but will you be the only one to be effected by this? O_-

Forced puns and whatever else can come to mind in terms of letting you know your 11 has bit the dust will transpire along with trying to drag the lot of you more than I did last time.

Speculate n such as to which songs will survive to Day 3.

MrSwearword: Here’s the skinny ledger on today’s events:

**BRITNEY** lost Day 1 and continued to get tiger-fucked enough to be down to Till The World Ends, I Wanna Go & Criminal. [3 of 6 remaining this day] [3/17 remaining overall.]

**RIHANNA** is also now down to 3 singles; You da One, Where Have You Been and We Found Love. [3 of 7 remaining this day] [3/16 remaining overall.]

**GAGA** wins Day 2 by only having six songs be chopped, leaving Born This Way, Judas, The Edge of Glory, You and I, Marry the Night, Bloody Mary and Scheiße remaining. [7 of 13 remaining] [7/17 remaining overall]

**BEYONCE** loses Day 2 by having 10 of her songs nuked with only US singles Love on Top and Countdown and UK exclusive single End of Time remaining. 10 songs that miss the Top 10? What is this, Lemonade? Oh wait, that had 11 songs miss the Top 10; never mind. [3 of 13 remaining this day] [3 of 16 overall]

Thanks for playing! Unless otherwise noted, same time, same sub with questionable taste.
