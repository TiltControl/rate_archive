ULTIMATE 2011 ALBUM REVEAL DAY 3: Good Things End in Fours
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/8e4iyv/ultimate_2011_album_reveal_day_3_good_things_end/

**Ich schlieben auften por el tiempo finalment, little monsters. Welcome to Day 3, the finale, of the 2011 Ultimate Album rate reveal!**

I'm MrSwearword, the Lee Lin Chin of popheads here to remind you that the live reveal for the plug is being handled by ballot werk hunty Elitefourbrad [so head over there for the bloodshed as it unfolds](https://plug.dj/popheads/)

Refresh yourselves for the last time about the basic stats of the rate:

**Number of participants**: 84 [because apparently, 2011 presented “too many” songs to rate even though this isn’t anywhere near the first time 4 albums have been rated before.]

**Average score**: 7.1436 [this probably means it was a consistent, more than pleasant listening experience if you played fair after all]

**Average controversy score**: 1.8888 [if this number is bigger, that’s how much more shit it caught from the voters]

#THE REVEAL WILL COMMENCE AT 2/1c

**Today we chop from #16-#1. A winner will be crowned, stans will overreact accordingly, etc. Here are the songs competing for the crown:**


~~**Born This Way**~~

1. ~~Marry the Night~~
2. ~~Born This Way~~
3. ~~Judas~~
4. ~~Scheiße~~
5. ~~Bloody Mary~~
6. ~~Yoü and I~~
7. ~~The Edge of Glory~~


**4**

1. **Love on Top**
2. ~~Countdown~~
3. ~~End of Time~~


~~**Femme Fatale**~~

1. ~~Till The World Ends~~
2. ~~I Wanna Go~~
3. ~~Criminal~~


~~**Talk That Talk**~~

1. ~~You da One~~
2. ~~Where Have You Been~~
3. ~~We Found Love (ft. Calvin Harris)~~

MrSwearword: Same customs apply; if you see your username, you're fucked as that means your 11 has bit the dust...but always ask yourself if you'll really be the only one effected by this? O_-

Today will contain some thread exclusive funsies; album roundups/writeups I did [which will debut once the artist/album in question will be punched out of the rate], the Jelboo Awards which will be given at the tail end of this to reveal who got the Gold, Silver and Bronze awards for their overall album scores...and who ended up in 4th...

...and something extra special after that. Now speculate which songs end up where 'n such.

MrSwearword: In terms of pacing, there will be special shitpost videos made by Elite to commemorate the fallen artists once they've been Shanghai'd right on out of this rate. So get comfy and bathe in the tears of fallen Femme Fatale 11s from the past 2 days.

BRITNEY is hanging on for dear life with two remaining entries, the singles Till The World Ends & I Wanna Go

BEYONCE is also down to two singles of her own, Love on Top & Countdown

RIHANNA looks doomed as well with only two songs left, We Found Love & Where Have You Been

MrSwearword: *Femme Fatale* roundup - My score, 5.1 [0.7 lower than In the Zone and 1.5 lower than Glory]
If you don’t remember the Day 1 summary for FF, let me remind you; Britney albums at large SUCK with exception of 1-3 singles. Now on to a slightly nicer writeup for this album.

There are small and scant silver linings to take with Femme Fatale era Britney. She made it beyond 2 singles, there was promotion for her songs [for some reason, Hold it Against Me had like 13 teasers for its music video] and the album became her 6th #1. For all her flaws in terms of vocal ability, production choices, whatever else can go wrong on a Britney album; this era did cement in the fact that she has stans. Stans with enough support to make it through her 2nd wind before the Billboard Music Awards/Glory would become her 3rd wind. I’m told there’s an album/era called Britney Jean but Work Bitch alone has me say “I don’t know her”.

Still, Femme Fatale is at least a product of its time in better ways than that sounds. Want an album that splits the difference between blatant electronic dance with Max Martin supported songs? This album tries its very hardest to present that. It showed Britney can compete with the pop divas that came after her. Sure, she mostly gets her ass handed to her but if she can survive 2007, she has the tenacity to do anything.

MrSwearword: *Talk That Talk* roundup - My score: 6.3 wait, didn’t I already try to be nice about an album that had a notable gap between single and album track quality? Oh wait, this is the version with Rihanna involved.

Rihanna from 2010-2012 was fucking unstoppable in terms of general presence. Between that time, we ended up with Rated R, Loud, this album and Unapologetic [and each of these albums have at least one #1 song between them. Werk.] However, the wheels were starting to look worn out by this album even if the exceptional We Found Love made Calvin Harris’ relevance and career skyrocket in a matter of minutes. Where Have You Been was proof that Rihanna can say yes to hits; what it also proved was that she was overworking herself to the fucking bone and as if her vocals aren’t already limited, stress and constant touring can fuck with that even worse.

For all of that working against her, Talk That Talk is still a pleasing experience when the songs are there to back it up. Surprisingly vulnerable material like Farewell to the fact that the singles toward the front of the album have a wow factor to them [except Where Have You Been, let’s be real]. And like a lot of Rihanna albums from this 2010-2012 boom, there’s a playful vulgarity she excels in.

Basically, what I’m saying is that even at her “Lemme grab my dick while you sit on top”, there’s still jams in this hopeless place.

MrSwearword: *Born This Way* roundup: My score: 8.1 [tied with TFM edition of The Fame, but technically 0.6 lower than The Fame. 1.3 higher than Joanne and 1.2 lower than ARTPOP] Nobody’s surprised at all with the fact that Gaga got my highest score and my 11 for the 4th time, right? OK, great.

A wiseass on PopJustice once said “Gaga albums are always engrained in the context of their release” and holy shit did that stick with me. 2011ga was when the batshit side of her was creeping in but was still playing the pop game. In retrospect, this is when trying to split the difference between personal expression and commercial success was beginning to fuck with Gaga even if she never showed it. Keep in mind her guest judge appearance on S9 of Drag Race; “In my career, the times when I’ve been the most angry with myself, is when I watched it back & I knew what it was supposed to be; but I listened to somebody else.” Sure, this can be an open and shut case for ARTPOP but considering BTW had the Edge of Glory music video fiasco and creative differences beginning to take place with longtime collaborators, the quote can be applied to BTW as well.

As an album, BTW gets the job done as a mostly balanced album with singles and a good chunk of the album cuts having the same effort put into it [even with the dirge of self-confidence anthems towards the back half of the album]. The only really “shocking” thing was Marry the Night’s chart performance/only peaking at #29 or so on the Hot 100 [I hate Alejandro more than Marry the Night, but even Alejandro made Top 10].

Sheer bombast with pop sensibilities & drawing in controversy just for self-expression in the pop divadom is what Gaga excels in the most and BTW was when she was beginning to say “this isn’t even my final form” or something like that.

robbiec_: **my Born This Way comment for anyone that cares**

"
this is one of my top four albums of all time. She did so much with this album when Gaga did The Most™. The sonic pallette for this album is extraordinary even for a "pop" album, and this wasn't even close to the mainstream song consider Britney is in this rate and Femme Fatale is like the 2012 year book in terms of the mainstream, which was that weird blend of post-dubstep, pre-EDM electropop. As I said before, this album was like the gateway for me into the more left field areas of pop music and music in general and I probably never would have went near some of my other faves like Arca or Kelela or even Björk (unimaginable!) if it wasn't for this album of what it means to be weird as fuck and making art. It's so many things- it's camp as fuck without being tacky, it's ugly at times, it's inclusive but says fuck the world at the same time, it's as bold as an album at the height of her fame could be. This album also made me appreciate the album as a long playing statement for the first time rather than just listening to the singles, and the singles on this (imo) masterpiece are stellar and ever performance she ever gave of this songs for TV or even the Born This Way Ball should be acknowledged as this millenniums answer to an absolute powerhouse performer who can deliver vocals, production, visuals, a message, personality, LOOKS, performance and, it's worth noting, compassion. AND THE CONTROVERSY. The christian imagery in this album was both worship to Gaga (she harps on about living the big man so much) but was so challenging to everyone else who uses religion as a vehicle for ignorance.  im_going_to_give_the_gays_everything_they_want.gif. AND SHE DID. As I said in my comment on Highway Unicorn, the first time I went to a gay bar this song was playing and it felt like a safety blanket. Gaga gets a lot of shit about posturing herself with the gays and stuff but she is a steeple of gay club music, my favourite queer artists were inspired by her, there was that scene on RPDR where they all thanked her for what she has done, and she has never abandoned the cause that she clearly feels strongly about across her whole career. She falls/has fallen on her sword more than enough for it, which is even more inspiring. I don't care if this album wins the rate because although I love a lot of Talk That Talk and 4, and like some a lot of FF, none of these albums has been so engrained in my life as Born This Way, and I'm sure a lot of people would agree.

[/r/popheads/comments/8e4iyv/ultimate_2011_album_reveal_day_3_good_things_end/dxslh08/]

=====

MrSwearword: *4* Roundup - My score: 7.4 [0.9 higher than Lemonade, 0.6 lower than the S/T score you saw in the 2013 Ultimate Rate because I REMEMBERED TO SEPARATE GHOST FROM HAUNTED AND YONCE FROM PARTITION AND NOT ADD THOSE FAKAKTA BONUS TRACKS, ROKIN.] So wait, this album got a 0 but scores higher than FF and TTT by a longshot each? How can that be? I’ll explain again.

Despite my very, very angry thoughts about Beyonce’s marketing for S/T and the Glorified HBO Soundtrack, I see it for Beyonce. She too excels in vocals and presentation even if Gaga beats her out by being batshit insane. That being said, when Beyonce songs miss, they miss hard and I am not amused in the slightest. I expect a lot from her, so when something’s off or the direction is bad I can’t allow myself to stand it.

Revisiting *4*, I remember the 5 singles for the US market [sorry End of Time] and being pleased with all but Party [because fuck Party and its inability to enhance Beyonce’s strengths]. Run the World (Girls), Best Thing I Never Had, Love on Top & Countdown meant she was batting 80% overall; something that hasn’t really happened since this era. The rest of the album tries its best to have her nail a ballad or at least showcase her talent.

The fact this is the last era with promotion is bittersweet because I don’t care what a member of the Beyhive says; she *needs* promotion because look what happens when absolute bangers of hers gets the attention they so deserve [I’d say commercial success too, but this is 4 era we’re dealing with here]. The silver linings to this era are the three Top 30 songs which inadvertently created the trends her next two albums would try to follow and that 4 went #1 and is now part of a six #1 album streak since her debut.

JunkyGS: **DOWNVOTES INBOUND**

**4** is really Beyonce's Witness / Artpop. Horrible marketing, flop singles, amazing production, some super awkward lyrics (1+1 and others...) and features some of her best work! 

Most of this album is saved by the fact Beyonce could sing random words from the dictionary and make it still better then most albums.

I used to love this album, but I think age has definitely revealed some of it's weaknesses (repetitive song topics, bad lyrics, poor pacing) or my taste has changed. 

*that being said......*

I'm happy Love On Top won, but you all did Britney dirty :(

=====

justiceisrad: Your analogy makes sense. I think it's one of her higher quality albums and really reflected where she was in life at the moment, and kind of paved way for the more personal albums, Self-Titled and Lemonade. 

I remember that after this album (4), there were rumors of her wanting to reunite Destiny's Child due to her lack of solo success and Kelly was killing it with Motivation around that time, but I'm personally happy with their pop-up reunions.
