[**Lady Gaga - Born This Way**] (https://open.spotify.com/album/5maeycU97NHBgwRr2h2A4O?si=lt6RI0CBRaeWgTFwvU8vGQ)



Fresh off the success of her debut album, "The Fame", and the follow-up EP, "The Fame Monster", Gaga released her second studio album, *Born This Way* on May 23rd, 2011. Lady Gaga was on top of the music scene and the fashion scene. Her extravagant looks at award shows and in her daily life gained her praise for not living the normal boring life I know all of you live. 

The album itself is heavily inspired by the 80's and synthpop with pop-rock influences. The lead single, which was the titled track herself, **”Born This Way”**, debuted at #1 after a riveting GRAMMYs Performance, in a night where Gaga collected three of her six GRAMMYs. It became the 1000th song to reach #1 on the *Billboard* Hot 100 since the charts began in 1958. The song has since become an LGBT+ anthem, due to its empowering lyrics of the community and people in general. It was followed by singles **”Judas”**, **”The Edge of Glory”**, **”Yoü and I”** and **”Marry the Night”**. These singles all had great success, peaking at #3, 10 and 29 respectively. The promotional single, **”Hair”**, also charted at #12. Fan favorites such has **”Heavy Metal Lover”** and **”Scheiße”** have become Little Monster staples for the ages.

[**Beyoncé - 4**] (https://open.spotify.com/album/1gIC63gC3B7o7FfpPACZQJ?si=x8RBKSMBQ--9fmRhBOYktw): written by our resident Beyoncé stan, /u/mokistu.


After Beyoncé's incredible streak of successful singles, albums and tours, from her Destiny's Child days to the new plateau of fame she found with the record breaking and world dominating "I Am...Sasha Fierce" (with some feature films on the side, it's OK if you don't know them nobody should), she found herself physically, mentally and creatively drained and overwhelmed.
 
She took some time off and in the process "killed" who made her seem unstoppable - her robotic alter ego Sasha Fierce. It was the start of a new age in the world, with the rise social media making celebrities seem more and more like us. So it was important for her to let the world know what she's like, through the music and the videos. One of the main and most important decisions she made prior to this era was firing her manager and father, Matthew Knowles - who controlled much of her image and music, and notably held her at gunpoint and made her record the song "Daddy".
 
The first thing you'll notice about 4 is how out-of-place it was in 2011. The throwback sound that just earned Bruno Mars his first Album of the Year Grammy contrasted heavily with the "We Found Love"s and "Hold It Against Me"s that dominated airwaves. Inspired by the dying genre that she grew up with, and with the help of producers and artists of its glory days (André 3000, Babyface - even the future of R&B, Frank Ocean, co-wrote and sang on one of its tracks), Bey was able to create a raw and warm record about the ups and downs of *her* relationship, with angry, sad, vulnerable and loving moments, and some of her best vocal performances to date.
 
The disparity between what the audience wanted and what the record sounded like, a controversial lead single and the album leak almost one month before its release lead to underwhelming sales and single peaks (it was her first album to not have a #1, and the highest single peak was #17), despite coming off such a strong era and having very positive critical reception. Despite this, it debuted at #1 with around 300 thousand sales (still her lowest figures) and was certified platinum two months later. It recently became her third album to reach one billion streams on Spotify, and she became the first woman to have three albums with over 1B streams.

[**Britney Spears - Femme Fatale**] (https://open.spotify.com/album/0oFBaXLFsUVa2gEmJf4FcJ?si=6MRtk9bcRIiqfPpx49FSJA)

It’s 2011, I remember getting in the car one day and my mom turned on the radio. The lady on Hot 99.5 said “Here is the new single Hold It Against Me by Britney Spears!”. It was an eye-opening experience for me, hearing those crisp robotic vocals from Britney made me a stan. The lead single **”Hold It Against Me”** debuted at #1, being Britney’s second straight song to debut at #1. It held the record for the least amount of weeks in the Top 20 as a #1 until Taylor Swift’s **”Look What You Made Me Do”**. It was followed up by the singles **”Till the World Ends”**, **”I Wanna Go”** and **”Criminal”**. Surprisingly, this was the first Britney Spears album to have three Top 10 singles. The dance pop and club anthems on this album are some for the ages, you WILL slut drop to **”Big Fat Bass”**! In my eyes, this was Britney’s last greatest hurrah as an artist. 

**Tracklist**

1. Till the World Ends
1. Hold It Against Me
1. Inside Out
1. I Wanna Go
1. How I Roll
1. (Drop Dead) Beautiful (ft. Sabi)
1. Seal It With a Kiss

1. Trip to Your Heart

Singles include the Calvin Harris-produced megahit **“We Found Love”**, which currently ranks at #24 on Billboard’s All Time Songs Chart, top 5 peaking electropop banger **“Where Have You Been”**, and top 40 hits like the reggae-pop fusion **“You da One”** and **“Talk That Talk”**, which features legendary rapper Jay-Z. In addition to these major hits, deep cuts such as The xx-sampling **“Drunk On Love”** and electric guitar-heavy **“Fool In Love”** round out the album’s diverse sound.

### PLEASE READ THESE RULES YOU FLOPS
* Listen to and rate every song. The program I’m using will crash if any song is not rated. Any incomplete ballots will not be accepted. Any ballots where you clearly haven’t listened to all the songs will be rejected until modified.
* Score each song from 1 to 10. You are allowed ONLY ONE 11 and ONLY ONE 0. Decimal places are allowed but only to the first digit: scores like 6.4 and 9.8 are allowed, but not 6.48 or 9.87. It makes the program very wonky. You can change your scores at any time, just PM me.
* Remember, you don't have to use your 11 or 0!
* This one is important, so listen up. DO NOT SABOTAGE. DO NOT SABOTAGE. DO NOT SABOTAGE. Sabotaging will be defined as giving a song a lower score than you actually feel it deserves because you want another song to win/you want your fave to win. I will be reading through all of these scores, and any clearly sabotaged ballots, I will ask that you change the scores. Failure to comply will result in --permadeath-- your scores not being counted.
* Following the idea of the last one, please refrain from hate comments in your comments. A little messiness is always fine, but please try not to go over the top. I will be reading through comments, any questionable ones I may request that you change. Refusal to do so will result in your comments for that song being removed.
* Additionally, please rate all albums fairly. I will be enforcing a mandatory minimum of a 3.0 album average. Try not to have all 10s or all 1s, and if you do, please include justification for each of these so it at least doesn't look like you're blindly stanning.
* Comments are allowed and encouraged! To leave a comment, just put a space after your score and write away.

HERE is an example of a properly done comment:

> Government Hooker: 10 Lady Gaga is a sex dominatrix queen!

HERE are examples of improperly done comments:

> Scheiße: 10: I broke my hip to this song!

> Scheiße: 10 - I broke my hip to this song!

> Scheiße: I broke my hip to this song! (10)

> Scheiße:I broke my hip to this song!
