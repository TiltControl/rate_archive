https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/btbes8/aughties_rock_bands_rate_reveal_day_3_hi_my_name/

Hello Dragon Ball, Naruto and Crimes of Grindelwald stans.... welcome to the third and final day of the Aughties Rock Bands Rate, the barely-anticipated match between Evanescence's debut album ***Fallen***, Linkin Park's debut album ***Hybrid Theory***, and, for some reason, Green Day's fifth studio album ***American Idiot***. Yesterday the Linkin Park carnage continued as the band now has only two songs left, while Evanescence got their compared advantage against Green Day reduced as they are left with four tracks (just like Linkin, all of them singles) versus Green Day's 6 tracks, which includes the only deep cut remaining on the rate.

Today we will be revealing the top portion of the songs on the main rate (12-1) and bonus rate (6-7), and the Top 10 entries of the adjacent Aughtiesvision rate. WE SHOULD BE STARTING AT 2 PM EST, OR 25 MINUTES FROM THE PUBLISHING OF THIS POST, **BUT BE SURE TO BE THERE EARLIER, AND BE THERE I MEAN THE PLACE WHERE MOST OF THE FUN HAPPENS:** [**https://plug.dj/popheads**](https://plug.dj/popheads)**.**

# [Miss Songeniality](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mThY0FVWrNzzEV67Urq9DbcX5w-xuYORT3xCAeTsHw8/)

Don't forget to do the **Aughties Rock Bands Rate's Miss Songeniality**, in which we would choose which song from Day 1 and Day 2 was robbed the most, and also there is some other questions that would determinate what would get played on our Plug DJ Party:

* **Miss Songeniality**, AKA the song that deserved better, would be played to remind you of your sins.
* Did Meteora deserved to be ranked instead of Hybrid Theory? If the final answer is YES, a song from the album would be played; if the answer is **NO** or **IT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE** then an special shitpost would be played instead.
* Which side of the Moby/Portman scandal are you on? Are you **TEAM MOBY** or **TEAM NATALIE PORTMAN**? A shitpost would await

Miss Songeniality would be open until the reveal of the Top 5, so be sure to vote!

This one is edgier than arguably all of the remaining songs, aided, of course, by the music video... unfortunately it's also quite just OK, as it doesn't really stand out among all of the other singles from this Day, you can almost say that this ''never was and never would be''...

---

**wanderingimpromptu3** (11): Catchy, well produced, and cinematic

**enecks** (10): third best song in album dont @

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): ended media's representation of women ugh amy lee's mind

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): I can't believe Amy wrote a song about my gay ass regretting falling in love with a homophobic piece of human trash.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yg_v7s1pRU

**twat\_brained** (8.4): Amy said FUCK fake ass hoes! I think.

**1998tweety** (8): slaps but also felt a bit filler-y

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Everybody's Fool was originally my favorite song off Fallen, but now, even if I still believe it has more personality than most songs from an only somewhat decent record, I've felt a bit betrayed by its content. I originally believed it had a positive, even feminist message about how women are forced to appear perfect to the world, an artistic statement that would have been radical in 2002. However, I've read Amy Lee's comments on how its lyrics are a reaction to the 'slutty' personas popularized in the 00s by acts like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, and I have to say those comments bother me quite a bit. It's true that female pop stars are oversexualized by the music industry in a manner that's ultimately related in misogyny, but denying women of their sexual agency (something which Christina was definitely developing in 2002) and blaming them for their objectification is...a more than slightly concerning attitude in the grand scheme of things, especially given this band's conservative Christian background. (Everybody's Fool's first few notes are also heavily interpolated from quite a few old church hymns, which doesn't help matters.) I'd like to believe this is dated yet well-intentioned, but I'm just too bothered by the song's background to give it a score I otherwise would have.

**cheatviathan** (7): The guitar arpeggios that open the track sound kind of cool. The phrase “Icons of self-indulgence” doesn’t grate on me as much as it should. I remember finding this song profound as an edgy 13-year-old

**Roxieloxie** (7): friendship ended with _ now nobody is my friend

**vayyiqra** (7): I find it strange how snobby metal fans can be and how they argued nu-metal isn't "real metal" in the 2000s. This is definitely a metal song to me, with an intro that reminds me of folk-metal and then some neat symphonic stuff near the end. The synths also add some nice colour; I wish the guitar didn't drown them out.

#NEVER WAS AND NEVER WOULD BE

Quite an unique track among Evanescence's output from the Fallen era, ''Missing'' (an outtake briefly turned into a B-Side and then into a bonus track) doesn't never explodes in the way some might expects, but that doesn't take away from how beautiful is Amy's vocal performance is on the track and how on-point those lyrics are... this could have been a nice break on the Fallen album, but I can see why the band though about puttign the track somewhere else, given how surprisingly mid-tempo it is.

Another cute punk pop anthem... and I can see why people love it so much (after all it's the only deep cut on Day 3), unfortuantely it still lacks that IT FACTOR to really stand out

---

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (11): This is the greatest song Green Day has ever written. When the album came out in 2004 I immediately fell in love with it at the young age of 13. And here we are in 2019, and I'm still addicted to it. And the live version? There's just two extra words but it brings it up to a completely new notch and goes above an 11.

**Roxieloxie** (11): How could I not give this song my 11, listen this song is so crucial to the soundtrack to me at 13. That opening is so cringey listening back on it but it was i c o n i c to me at that time. I have no idea what it was about this one but damn I love it so much

**cheatviathan** (10): Definitely a strong contender for my 11. The driving guitars knock you on your ass, the little riff in the second verse is cool. This song also has one of Billie Joe Armstrong’s more impassioned vocal performances on the album. Just a fantastic song.

**enecks** (10): WHERE HAVE ALL THE RIOTS GONE? That's such a mood urgh

**ManofOranges** (10): Another great song

**1998tweety** (8): Finally something a big boppier

**twat\_brained** (8): I really liked this but I already forget how it sounds I'm sorry

**waluigiest** (8): this is more of an intellectual appreciation than actual enjoyment of the song. The melodies at the beginning of the verses are really sweet tho

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Don't worry, I'm going to give some high praises to American Idiot as an entire album soon enough, but...I think Letterbomb is a prime example of why it doesn't hit the 'greatest of all time' button that I sometimes so desperately want it to achieve. The song's supposed to be a turning point leading up into the record's final act, a moment of climax that proves to be the point of no return for American Idiot's main character, but while it's not really a bad song, the rock rifts here are too generalized and too undefined for me to reliably catch the exact emotional impact of what this climax is supposed to be transmitting. Sure, I do appreciate Letterbomb's place in American Idiot's narrative (now that I think about it, the sneaky terrorism reference is pretty cheeky, too) but whatever love Green Day fans may have for the song it's just not for me.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): damnit i didn’t find a skate video for this song

**vayyiqra** (7): WTF the intro to this is by Kathleen Hanna? (I referenced the Bikini Kill song "Rebel Girl" in my comment for "She's a Rebel" which I think of as its spiritual successor ... my mind.)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYBOf07bXm8

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes, I know it's a meme, and also something about the way the chorus ends has never quite sat right with me. It's still a great song. That synth melody will haunt me until my dying day.

**waluigiest** (10): very good blending of styles - the intense chorus / sensitive verses / rap flourishes work well together to finally make a cohesive powerful piece

**yoereyesr** (10): The best track along In the End and Papercut but even better is the One More Light Live version.

**1998tweety** (9): a highlight

**enecks** (9): In the process, Shadow lost his memories and as such, sought to uncover the truth of his past, during which he met Black Doom and the Black Arms; in the end, Shadow regained his memories, uncovered the truth, and thwarted Black Doom's agenda and saved the world. From there, he continued his mission to protect humanity by becoming a special agent of GUN.

**letsallpoo** (9): CRRAWWWWLLLIINNGG INNN MY SKINNNNN

**twat\_brained** (8.5): going✈️tinnitus if I'd heard this live back in the day

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Hybrid Theory already makes no attempts to hide what the total atmosphere of each song truly implies about its underlying message, but Crawling is just such a full blast of it all thanks to Chester's incredibly brash vocal performance that it's simultaneously easy to see why it became such a subject of mockery in the past as well as why the song sounds so painful now. I've never liked any sort of metaphor that had to deal with stuff being underneath your skin, since imagining that shit is just gross, but it's that lack of comfortability that makes Crawling more powerful to me as an individual listener. In hindsight, this is such an obvious look into an unbelievably hollow state of mind that I have to wonder why we as a society were cruel enough to see it as cringeworthy. That affects my enjoyment of the song, but on its own, Crawling is still a damn good piece of art and angst in all its gravity.

**cheatviathan** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCiFO7qV54E

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): The chorus deserves to be memed to death. The song deserves a better chorus.

**hikkaru** (5.5): the dichotomy between the chorus and the verse are a bit too much for me

Even today, being featured on The Simpsons is a rite of passage for many muusical acts, everyone from U2 to the Smashing Pumpkins to Michael Jackson to the Glee cast... but how many of them can say they were featured ON THE MOVIE? Only Green Day of course... although their appereance is nothing but a small and quite unimportant plot device, their few seconds of screentime are iconic enough that it makes you wish they were somehow reinvited to the show, and of course this punk ocver of the original classic theme song is one of the reasons why, alongside the Nearer My God To Thee reference.

Personally hurt bu the placement of this one, it truly deserved better: Angsty enough to be pure rock perfection but catchy enough to be massive... arguably one of their poppiest songs and one of the best from their debut album.

---

**Brendon-Urine** (10): This song floods me with memories of playing Wizard101 in middle school

**MrSwearword** (10): I can't help but like this song.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): wow i forgot how good this is i am ashamed, what an amazing opener

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): finally some good fucking food

**twat\_brained** (10): this was already going to be a high score from me but then that solo hit and the 10 was absolutely set in stone for me. There's another song in this rate that deserves my 11 more but this one is definitely my favorite song from this album.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Back when I actually listened to Fallen daily, I would have given a higher score to its opening track. Turns out it aged worse for me than most other songs.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is nice, good opener

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Going Under definitely surprised me in regards to quality! To be honest, I was dreading listening to Fallen more than the other two albums in this rate, no thanks its incredibly dated cover, but Amy Lee's vocal dedication in this opening track is something that gave off a positive impression right away. As much as I hate to say this, the fact that the song avoids falling too deep within this record's general aesthetic is something that can make nervous listeners actually excited for the rest of what Evanescence has to offer. Though I may not have ended up seeing the album this commences a bonafide classic, the strong, dark charms hidden deep within Going Under is something that tempts me into listening to  Fallen again ever so occasionally.

**enecks** (8): A little sludgy, but a mood

**Roxieloxie** (8): good opening track

**vayyiqra** (8): I've never been a big fan of Evanescence, or even heard this whole album, but the chorus is catchy as hell.

**cheatviathan** (7): Solid enough opener. The nu-metal guitar riffage and Amy Lee’s soaring vocals give a good idea of what the rest of the album entails.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McMOFTfcuHE

Continuing their association with edgy mid-00s comic book films, this track was included on the soundtrack of the much-maligned 2004 film The Punisher. That's the only relatively interesting thing I can say from this middling and quite cliche track... oh, and also this was apparently a Top 20 hit so good for Amy I guess

Green Day's magmun opus, this epic 9 minutes track never overstays its welcome, which is quite impressive considering how overloaded this track is...

---

**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): With only a minute or two for each section, despite being a total 9 minutes long, this song manages to keep things fresh for the entire run. Fantastic and deserves all the 11's it will inevitably get.

**CarlieScion** (11): this song murdered me but in a good way

**extrasmallbillie** (11): my favorite song of all time from my all time favorite album.

**minibjork** (11): the first song i ever memorized from start to finish aka my greatest achievement

**static\_int\_husp** (11): This some is pure prog rock schtick but for punk kids and I love the hell out of it

**vayyiqra** (11): I doubt this song will win, but I have to give it my 11 because I think it's the best song in the rate by far. This isn't a rock song, this is high art. I can't even sum up all my feelings about it, growing up lonely and depressed in suburban North America.

**cheatviathan** (10): The first nine-minute, multi-faceted behemoth of a song. It serves as an introduction to the titular character, and every phase transitions gracefully and logically into the next. The transition from “ii, City of the Damned” to “iii. I Don’t Care” still gives me goosebumps.

**ManofOranges** (10): The song version of an epic

**Roxieloxie** (10): I hate most songs over 5 minutes but this is the one exception, This song is honestly a work of art

**ImADudeDuh** (9): damn they did NOT have to snap so hard but they fucking DID

**1998tweety** (8): This is super long but it kind of works tbh

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEwnq3aI6cE

**twat\_brained** (7.7): …so is this supposed to be a prog song? I can count at least 3 distinct parts to it. I mean they all sound pretty good but as a listening experience it feels rather clunky and unflowing. Just from how I see it at least

**hikkaru** (7.5): not bad at all, i definitely appreciate the many changes the song goes through throughout its runtime to keep interest piqued but like... the runtime is still nine minutes and i have the attention span of a 5 year old so

**MrSwearword** (5): there is no goddamn reason why this shit has to be NINE FUCKING MINUTES LONG MADE OF FIVE UNREALIZED SEPARATE FUCKING SONGS OH MY GOD

**sweetnsoursauce1** (4): probably get roasted for this but i hated how long it was when i was 10 and i still hate how long it is now - still gets a 4 bc i would enjoy it if it was cut in half

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): Boring, WAY too long

#THIS IS OUR GENERATIONS...

**enecks** (11): Modern. Day. Bohemian. Rhapsody. Actually, this is better than that. It's a musical number - an entire first act and inciting incident that develops a character, frames a world, and offers a rush while doing so. So many parts that are perfect. Also, the lines about everyone's heart not beating the same really resonated with me when I was figuring out my sexuality. Like... REALLY resonated. Billie was THE bi icon for me. So forgive me for giving this a 11. This is maybe one of my favourite songs ever.

**iamhalsey** (11): 'SICKO MODE' who? This is our generation's 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. 'Part IV: Dearly Beloved' never fails to make me cry.

**waluigiest** (10): is this Green Day’s Pyramids???

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Jesus of Suburbia is, as everybody knows, nine minutes long. It is perhaps the last song of such a length that is somewhat famous amongst the general public. You could argue that Jesus of Suburbia is then therefore the closest equivalent the 21st century has to Stairway to Heaven, although that's an insult to Green Day (Loop Zoop stans can head out now). I'd prefer such a title to be given to Mr. Brightside, despite it being much shorter, but there's no denying that you have a classic right at your hands when you listen to this song. I'm not the best person to write about its operatic elements, but Jesus of Suburbia is suitably epic throughout, which is something everybody is able to confirm. Coming after the brief but effective opener that was American Idiot, its full exposition of whatever messy plot lies behind the story of this album is just a teensy bit close to being glorious, and it's surprisingly easy to get attached to all three parts of this track rather than just one. Like, that intermission between the first section and the second? Fucking goals. I'm not quite in love with this song as some are, but it's still incredibly impressive to my ears, so props to Green Day for making this masterpiece.

Why was this one such a huge hit? it's quite catchy sure but also heavily annoying...

---

**hikkaru** (11): i love the melody of this song and they really went off on america so i have to stan

**MrSwearword** (11): YAAAAAAAAAAAAS GAWD I was always so happy when this song and video came out on VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown [shut the fuck up, it was my childhood]

**yourhostandpatron** (11): Holiday and In The End are both currently in a very tight race for my 11, but if I give it to Holiday (and I hope I don't since I literally wrote my comment for the later song in the light of me once being certain that it'd be my pick) I think I ought to describe why. Simply put, I can't understand why even the most stubborn of punk rock purists who think Green Day sold out with this song can't bop their heads at least just a little to the awesomeness of Holiday. American Idiot was already a statement, but this is one that just swashbuckles into your face and is completely and absolutely great at getting you to be as mad as the band is. This song is where the brief political tones of American Idiot shine and start to sinkin, and this is where things turn into a major slugest. I absolutely love it. It definitely has a fighting right to being called the best song in this rate.

**cheatviathan** (10): This was the single that sold me on the album, moreso than the two ballads. The vocal melody is catchy, the opening guitar chords are impossible not to bang your head to, and the political undertones of the lyrics are cool.

**enecks** (10): The most pop-friendly song in the album maybe. But it bumps. The lyrics have some real teeth to them too.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this album is a lot better than the others

**Roxieloxie** (10): the song that started it all. It's honestly iconic

**iamhalsey** (9): This song triggers a very specific memory of playing Tony Hawk's American Wasteland with my brother.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): the vibe of this song is exactly how i feel going on holiday

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN7-TocQGLs

**vayyiqra** (9): I feel like this song is a good example of how this album seemed like it would be really political, but the War on Terror turned out to only be the backdrop for the rest of the story. I think maybe the lyrics fall a bit flat, but the song itself is a banger and very catchy.

**waluigiest** (9): when I was a kid this song made me want to misbehave and yup still works!

**1998tweety** (8.5): this bops a decent bit but Roman Holiday outsold

**twat\_brained** (8.3): I mean it sounds good but what does it all mean?

**wanderingimpromptu3** (4.5): Kinda catchy but doesn't stand out

**Brendon-Urine** (3): This song gets SO old after you hear it a couple times. I've unfortunately heard it way too many times and can barely stand it.

99 Problems is one of those songs that works combined with almost anything (here is combined with [*99 Luftballons*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtTN0nh9uKk) and another one with Radiohead's [*The National Anthem*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2fPmyH6Q6E) to give you an idea) so Chester and co. would have to work extra hard to screw it... and they didn't, they mostly succeed into creating one heavenly mash-up. There's not too much to add because this slaps no matter what else do I add to it.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): 99 Problems could be remixed with almost everything and still end up a 10 tbh

At some point this was my 11... and then something happened: I realized this is a demo, at least the piano version is a demo, and the band wanted to release a more polished version on the album but they were prevented by their record label for some bizarro reason.

Maybe that melodramatism is the reason most people rejected this track, otherwise I can't the big controversy score and sabotage that pushed this song from #3 to almost being out of the Top 10 before it kinda recovered at the end...

---

**Brendon-Urine** (11): Probably cried to this song 1000 times, it really just hits every time.

**waluigiest** (10): wtf is this?? her voice suggests “musical theatre ballad” and so do the lyrics and somehow it’s beautiful

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): :emofish:

**cheatviathan** (8): The instrumental still sounds gorgeous to me, Amy Lee’s vocals sound beautiful on this arrangement, and the melodramatic tone of the lyrics actually adds to it somehow. I thought age would make this sound insufferable, but that hasn’t happened.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): Inspiration for one of the greatest literary masterpieces of all time. Iconic.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): They wouldn't have named the best work of 21st century literature after something that isn't iconic.

**minibjork** (10): Hi my name is Ebony Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair

**hikkaru** (8.5): Hi my name is Ebony Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that’s how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don’t know who she is get da hell out of here!). [[I’m not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he’s a major fucking hottie. I’m a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I’m also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I’m in the seventh year (I’m seventeen). I’m a goth (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them. “Hey Ebony!” shouted a voice. I looked up. It was…. Draco Malfoy! “What’s up Draco?” I asked. “Nothing.” he said shyly. But then, I heard my friends call me and I had to go away.

**Roxieloxie** (8): isn't this a harry potter fanfic

**vayyiqra** (8): Hi my name is Ebony Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that’s how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don’t know who she is get da hell out of here!).

**CarlieScion** (2): i have repressed fanfiction.net issues about this song

**yourhostandpatron** (0): I originally wrote a comment that was a pastiche of *that* copypasta, featuring myself as the main character, but nobody who I knew got it, so I’m trashing it. Anyway, my 0 for this song is probably going to be seen as sabotage, but, fellas, I cannot understand why you people think this song is good. It’s intolerably soft to the point where I can’t make out what Amy is saying, it has no purpose or direction to it, it became ridiculously overplayed back in the day, and it indirectly caused some of the worst Harry Potter fandom drama of all time. I don’t even dislike Fallen, but this is my least favourite song in the rate, period. I’m sorry.

When I was asked to host this rate, my biggest concern was exactly what to do with My Immortal and its two versions... I ultimately choose, partly based on a poll I made, wrong and decide to bury the superior version as a bonus track... sure, this still slaps even without the guitars, but the added rock break is quite the cathartic moment. This is the band's preferred version, and the one actually recorded for the album, but at the insistence of their record label, this was temporally shelved before being reissued as a single and then as a bonus track. I kinda regret not having put this version on the main rate and, according to your comments, I should be ashamed for it... but at least we should be thankful this version of the track didn't get any fanfiction-themed comments!

**1998tweety** (11): Iconic, I feel like out of all of the big memed singles in this rate, I feel the strongest connection to this one since I heard it more when I was younger.

**agentofscranton** (11): the first time i heard this song i was in year 6 during a talent show, and thinking that the dude singing had such a gorgeous voice and i just remember crying without even knowing what the lyrics meant. when i went home that day and listened to the original and found out the meaning i was just an absolute wreck. i did this entire rate just to give this song the 11 it deserves.

**ManofOranges** (11): This is probably one of my favorite songs of all time. I know this probably won't win but I just couldn't resist giving it my 11.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): If I hadn't listened to this song numerous times before checking out the album in its entirety, I would've been taken aback by the sheer surprise of hearing this ballad. The exquisite guitar solos in the bridge are the most emotionally cathartic moment on the record.

**enecks** (10): Maybe this should've been my 11. It's the most impactful song in Green Day's entire discography, and that's before realising the real world context for it.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): When everyone thought this was a 9/11 tribute....

**MrSwearword** (10): who the fuck ever saw a song about Billie Joe losing his father at a young age would be misconstrued for a 9/11 attack story coming for the band that once sang about jacking off but called it Basket Case? Anyway, this song is great.

**Roxieloxie** (10): an emotional ballad, it's kinda out of place in the album but tbt i think it pairs with the teenage angst feeling the end of the album has

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): v close to being my 11, amazing

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): talent

**twat\_brained** (10): no words. only sorrow and empathy for Billie. I don't cry over music but hearing this enough times reading Genius notes might do it for me.

**vayyiqra** (10): wake me up inside when september ends

**waluigiest** (10): timeless heartbreaker

**minibjork** (9): this song is the musical equivalent of a thunderstorm.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Wake Me Up When September is, without a doubt, the most famous song in this rate. A ballad that continues to be played by numerous radio stations as autumn dawns, it has, unfortunately, also been subject to torrid weaponizing by numerous people on the Internet who think it's funny to tell Billy Joe Armstrong to wake up every October 1st on social media due to misinformation spreading the inaccurate idea that the song is about 9/11, not the death of his father. Come on, people! Do your research! I've heard Green Day's gotten sick of the song for this reasons, which is understandable, but, honestly, it's also a real shame. In the chaos of American Idiot, Wake Me Up When September ends is a rare moment of solemnity and sincerity. It's a tribute that does exactly what it intends to do, and despite how much it's been misused, in the great canon of 21st century classics, I don't believe it's going anywhere.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): good, but kind of overrated

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jNO37a5k08

**CarlieScion** (7): haha did someone wake up that guy from green day yet i am very funny

**cheatviathan** (7): A strong ballad. Overplay has dulled this one on me a bit, but it’s still pretty good.

**jolteonhoodie** (6.7): Every 1st October I dread the Green Day jokes

**wanderingimpromptu3** (4): This one has a memorable melody, but I just don't really like it, and it's too long

**Roxieloxie** (9): this song is probably gonna win but it shouldn't

**waluigiest** (9): points were made

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): American Idiot is perhaps the last successful political single not hailing from  the world of hip hop that still continues to resonate with the general public. Keeping more true to Green Day's punk roots than any almost any other track from its namesake album,  the song wastes no time in pulling out Billie Joe Armstrong's punches of fury, using language that's paradoxically became commercialized in its infamy yet consistently stark and effective in its uncontrollable anger. It hails from a time when criticizing the United States or any other nation became less taboo than it had for most of the 20th century, and even if you may find i t too common to be as riveting as it may have been in the past, it's still a fantastic historical landmark that you'll often find yourself banging your head to.  The satirical elements of American Idiot are becoming less and less exaggerated, and that keeps this song more and more resonant in its continuing return towards public favor. Admit it, you laughed when this hit #1 in the U.K during Trump's visit a few years ago. It may somehow be towered over by even more brutal lyrical protests in today's world, but somehow, American Idiot will always remain special.

**ManofOranges** (8): While I don't think this song quite lives up to others, as an opener it does its job and does it very well

**vayyiqra** (8): Suddenly it's 2004 again, I am an avid reader of Rolling Stone magazine, and hating George W. Bush is the hottest trend. Side note: I never noticed quite how edgy the lyrics are. I bet it will get some bad scores solely because Billie Joe self-deprecatingly calls himself a faggot. But this song is still a banger.

**1998tweety** (7): should be a 10 but he used the f-slur so it got tanked, sorry not sorry

**minibjork** (6.5): man i really felt rebellious listening to this on the car ride to school when i was 11

Meme'd to death, but still slaps...

**1998tweety** (10): obligatory 10, it may have got memed but it still a great song

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I thought I was so cool for liking a rap song back in the day...

**enecks** (10): Shadow is a brooding loner, to put it bluntly. He usually acts with a cool and businesslike indifference, only occasionally showing his vulnerable side. He is rarely seen with others for an extended period of time and usually distances himself from essentially everyone. He is usually soft-spoken, silent and doesn't speak much, but he always knows exactly what to say in combat. However, Shadow never bluffs. If he makes a threat, he has every intention of carrying it out.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Whew

**letsallpoo** (10): one time when i was in like middle school and my mom was driving me somewhere, this came on the radio and she started telling me about how one of her college classmates had studied really hard to move to america and everything and after she finally immigrated she died a year or so afterwards. i still think about that story whenever i listen to this song

**vayyiqra** (10): I can't even describe what I think about this song. If you want to know what depression feels like, read the lyrics. It's too much for me. : (

**yourhostandpatron** (10): I wasn't expecting to be tempted to give a Linkin Park track my 11, but somehow everything about In The End just...clicks, though it unfortunately didn’t get that honor in the end. On my second listen of Hybrid Theory, it was clear to me that this was a song that was an immediate standout. More and more replays of it made me realize that it was a very special outlier in this rate. There's that iconic piano rift at the start, obviously, but even past that, this has a surprising amount of things going for it. Yes, I know that this song isn't exactly technically brilliant (come on, though, it's 00s rock) but, dear God, the rest of it all just makes sense as a perfect summary of the emotions that fueled the creation of Hybrid Theory as an album. There's a striking balance of sincerity and passion as well as hopelessness and defeat throughout the entire track, and even just listening to this song can make you understand just how troubled Chester was. It's haunting, but it's also just a bit sad and magnificent, in its own way. Plus, deep within the music, there's a fear of failure here that a whole bunch of us can relate to. Maybe that's why this song was Linkin Park's biggest hit. I don't know if these are the exact reasons why I love it, and I hope it doesn't seem like I'm saying this out of pity, but, seriously? In The End is among one of the songs event that shines the damn most to me, and that's saying something, given the fact that I generally don't like the period of pop music represented by all three records we're judging. So, in conclusion? It’s one of my favorites by far. I appreciate Holiday a bit more than it, and I  don't expect this to win and I'll be pleasantly surprised if it does, but I adore it just all the same.

**rotating3Dtext** (9.8): (yay for 2000’s cgi videos)

**cheatviathan** (9): This peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, kept off the top spot by Jennifer Lopez’s “Ain’t It Funny.” That would be the highest chart peak LP would have. It certainly earned it, I feel. The pianos, Mike dropping profound bars like “Time is a valuable thing / Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings, ” the monster of a hook from Chester, it’s all great.

**iamhalsey** (9): A dream and a nightmare. Great song but I fully believe those verses are responsible for the creation of G-Eazy.

**twat\_brained** (9): personally I feel like LP's best song is "Numb" but it's hard for them to top this.

radiofan15: # Hybrid Theory

**Overall Average**: 6.996 **// Average Controversy:** 1.853

---

Quite samey and repetitive and anticlimatic and disjointed TBH but i liked it [Score: B]

---
**asdivval** (8.925): 10

**yourhostandpatron** (8.125): Hybrid Theory is quite abrasive compared to the vast majority of the music Popheads consumes. With an vaguely unappealing combination of genres and a troubled cultural context behind it, you could say that this in the record in the rate that happens to be the hardest to get into. I, too, was not a fan of Hybrid Theory when I first heard it, despite the intense amounts of sadness I experienced whenever I put it into analysis. That's where Hybrid Theory eventually decided to strike a match with me. After getting used to all the rap and rock this record, I found myself focusing on the band's lyrics and performance on Hybrid Theory, and I found myself agreeing a surprising amount of times on how just bare Chester and Linkin Park's other members lay themselves down here in this forty minutes trek of terror and range. It doesn't really have the formula to belong to a pantheon full of the all time greats, but Hybrid Theory is a powerful treatise on the depths of despair that may serve as an interesting case study for me in the future. It puts on a spectacle, yet, but the same time, it's all genuine. These contradictions make Hybrid Theory a more dynamic record than you'd expect, and they’re what make me appreciate the record more than I imagined I would. I don’t know if I like it more than American Idiot, but it’s close!

**vayyiqra** (7.833): I just have so many feelings about this album. Listening to it, I can feel the cold gel deodorant of my preteen years. Overall rating: 7.83.

**twat\_brained** (7.683): I'm gonna scour around my house to see if we kept a copy of it. I can't find one so I'll just listen on SONOS.

**cheatviathan** (7.667): I was five years old when their first two albums released. “Numb”, “Breaking the Habit”, “Faint”, and “In the End” were songs that my mom actually liked, and played quite a bit. I didn’t have any motivation to seek out new music until I got a used iPod Touch 4 in 2011 and inherited my older brother’s music library. On it was the first three Linkin Park albums. That was the start of my “angry white boy” phase. I listened to all those shitty alt-metal bands. Hell, I listened to Limp Bizkit’s cover of “Behind Blue Eyes” and thought “This Fred Durst person knows how to write a profound song.” However, even as I grew out of it, and cringed at the majority of that music, Linkin Park’s music still held up. I remember disliking the stylistic shift of A Thousand Suns and Living Things, but those albums grew on me with time. I will always favor Meteora, but Hybrid Theory was still a great debut that spoke to my middle-school soul.

**ManofOranges** (7.583): This is the first Linkin Park album I've ever listened to so I didn't really know what to expect going in. I think this album does have its moments but overall for me it got a little too rage-y if that makes sense. Like there are times when they were just screaming and like that's fine if you like that but it just inda freaks me out. That's not to say though that all of these songs are bad because some of them are good and some of them are very popular for a reason. So it's a fine album.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7.500): METEORA GOT SNUBBED. Jokes aside, I won't deny that Hybrid Theory is what put Linkin Park out there - doing so would be heretical, - but I really don't like this album as much as their sophomore record. To my liking at times it feels too noisy, too messy, and not nearly as melodically and lyrically appealing and coherent compared to its successor. The second half greatly outshines most of the first and thus redeems the LP.

**enecks** (7.333): Shadow the hedgehog shitposts aside, this album is interesting. I don't think the hip hop elements are great, and it can be pretty cheesy, but this album resonated with people for a reason.

**jolteonhoodie** (7.217): Wow this album does not hold up for me, and that makes me kinda sad

**MrSwearword** (6.833): I don't have much to say about this other than I was clearly not aggro in youth enough for this or pre-disposed to rock as an outlet. I will say, Chester Bennington had some goddamn pipes.

**hikkaru** (6.750): Apologies to metal fans that like when singers scream, but it's really just not for me, and therefore this is my least fave album out of the three. The rapping isn't the greatest either tbh.

**waluigiest** (6.750): some of it works well and some of it is clumsy and grating

**timothy444** (6.167): It's a theory alright; one that just doesn't work as well as expected.

**TragicKingdom1** (5.667): I went in expecting to not enjoy this whatsoever considering I was under the impression it was by far the edgiest album here, but it's surprisingly coherent for what it is. It falls apart after Crawling, which I can't take seriously whatsoever, but there are some highlights on here and have a better impression of Linkin Park now than I did before. That being said, I am strongly rooting against this album in the rate. [Grade: C]

**Brendon-Urine** (5.583): There are points where the edge is just too much (SHUT UP WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO ME) but outside of that it's a super solid album. R.I.P. Chester

**iamhalsey** (5.500): Minutes to Midnight was by far superior to both Hybrid Theory and Meteora. I'm sorry that some of you aren't ready to face that reality.

**minibjork** (5.250): rap metal was a mistake (avg. 5.3)

**vayyiqra** (10): I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as though millions of emo boys with eyeliner suddenly cried out at once, and were suddenly silenced.

**waluigiest** (10): well written, well orchestrated, on brand, great transition….. very well done

**twat\_brained** (9.6): never really loved the outro on this; if it was better put together this would get a 10 from me

**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): I can't believe I'm saying this, but maybe the Brits should back off for once. I'm saying this because despite numerous accusations of plagiarism stemming from even Oasis themselves, I can't help but be forced to comprehend that Boulevard of Broken Dreams is vastly superior to Wonderwall. Yeah, sure, it's even edgier, but the brilliant thing about this is that there's a kind of bleakness here that can only by masked by irony in a way where you're forced to admit that the hollowness of Boulevard of Broken Dreams is identical to that of your soul. I'm writing this without a shred of exaggeration, by the way. This is how depressed we all are in 2019. Similar to how the song it's paired with comes across as, Boulevard of Broken Dreams radiates a sincere as well as a somehow atttactive yet repulsive sort of loneliness that can be satisfyingly heard both within the story of American Idiot and as an iconic Green Day hit on its own. I'm pleasantly surprised this won Record of the Year. It deserves the prize.

**cheatviathan** (9): Fun Fact (or Not So Fun Fact, depending on your tastes): This song went to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. This was kept off the top spot by 50 Cent’s “Candy Shop.” Make of that what you will.

**Roxieloxie** (9): FOR NOW I WALK ALOOOOOOOOOONE

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): i once used this for a project in like middle school as a song that was supposed to "describe your life" and whew yeah that was certainly a moment in my life

**Brendon-Urine** (6): Kind of the same problem as Holiday, this song is so overplayed. It's at least bearable.

radiofan15: # American Idiot

---

**Overall Average**: 7.955 **// Average Controversy:** 1.700

---

 [Score: B+]

---
**enecks** (10.077): This album is a time capsule, and a masterpiece of rock operatics. Maybe when music criticism stops circlejerking mediocre 00's indie rock, they'll fully recognise this as the most important and vital work of rock from that decade. It's an album laden with subtext in addition to the overt political text - I'd argue it's a classic of bisexual music.

**Roxieloxie** (9.423): The year is 2014, american idiot had been out for ten years but 13 me was in the middle of her "I only listen to real music" phase. On a summer full of road trips I Fell in love with this album. One day im gonna write a YA story to this album

**iamhalsey** (9.254): No one has ever done what Green Day perfected on this album as well as they did. Truly a classic.

**ManofOranges** (9.231): Oh boy I think this must've been the first full album I ever listened to and it's possible that because of that I feel incredibly sentimental when listening to it and just love it to pieces. Honestly, that is the case. I can't help but admire every song in this album. I grew up with this album. It's an absolute 10 for me. Even the songs that I believe to be weaker I believe are still good. I also think it's effective in telling its story although I believe that sound alone carries the album and makes it what it is. It just sounds amazing.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (9.231): My first real foray into rock and still remains one of my favourites of all time. Even the weak spots on the album are still decent at worst and the whole album comes together so cohesively.

**cheatviathan** (8.846): This album will be considered a classic, mark my words. The songs are great, the scope is ambitious, the narrative is interesting enough if you’re looking to delve deep into it. “Boulevard of Broken Dreams” and “Wake Me Up When September Ends” were radio staples for good reason. This album blew my mind in my middle-school years. Concept albums were an alien concept to me at that time. Yeah, I’d heard “2112,” but that was only one side of an album. This was a whole hour-long narrative.

**asdivval** (8.785): 8.7

**TragicKingdom1** (8.654): This holds up much better than I thought it would. It has a very consistent groove and energy that amplifies, rather than distracts, from the political rhetoric in the text. I think this is the definition of a 2000s pop essential and even if you are not a fan of rock music you'll find something to appreciate here. [Grade: A]

**yourhostandpatron** (8.615): You know, even if I call myself a musical defender, I'm not really a fan of music on the stage, per se. This is not to say that I don't like the idea of such a concept, because, as I've mentioned previously, I do, but all things considered I'm just too far removed from any knowledge about what a rock opera is actually supposed to consist of to be the kind of guy who can actually give American Idiot a full critique. That being said, I doubt most fans of Green Day are highly trained in the art of the rock opera, as well. So why is this record so damn popular?  I mean, sure, the music in it's good, and it has a couple of hits associated with its name, but why does it carry the aura of a modern classic even if it's not quite as acclaimed as some of its counterparts from earlier times in the history of rock? I actually have no damn clue, but in a way, I guess you could say that the reason why American Idiot is probably the most beloved album in this rate, along with being one of the only rock albums from this century that people actually love, has to do with how its combination of politics, nihilism, and alienation all go along what we've all been feeling since the 90s officially ended on September 11, 2001. I'm willing to bet that this analysis is complete and utter nonsense, and that the real reason why we all get hyped at the opening rift of this album's title track is because we all hate George Bush, but despite the fact that American Idiot was clearly made in the early 00s, there's a sad atmosphere of relevance that you start to feel the more you listen to the record and start to comprehend its messy and occasionally contradictory plot. American Idiot may not come as well together as some of the best crowning moments of musical classics do, but it's still brilliant in the way it's continued to struck a chord up until today, and I think it may deserve just a little more critical attention than what it gets nowadays. It's not among my favourite albums of all time, but it still ranks highly as one of the most satisfying albums I've ever heard within our specific cultural and social context. I suppose that, in a way, that's something on its own.

**timothy444** (8.538): This isn't an album; rather an interesting movie, in audio form and even if you only listen to this once in your life, it's worth listening without any distractions just for the experience alone.

**MrSwearword** (8.385): Basically, my album score is based off of how well the singles hold up [if they do] mixed in with the fact that Green Day was a very minute but crucial part of my music based youth.

**minibjork** (8.023): i will still obnoxiously sing along to every word of this album at 90 years old ok (avg. 7.9)

**waluigiest** (8.000): I wasn’t ready for how tightly constructed this album would be. This should be a model for what an album could be. Even with a few less stellar tracks it’s incredible. Tbh I think this rate is going to be 3 days of album listening parties

**ElizabethDDoS** (7.923): Given that I'm not American, it's hard for me to fully appreciate the concept and themes behind this record. It serves bops, it sends some kind of message, and, unfortunately, that's all I can say about it. Sorry, Billie.

**hikkaru** (7.885): Being a basic bitch, I definitely appreciate this album the most out of the three for it being pop-rock rather than the metal the other two go for. Some real iconic BOPS from this album and I hope something from it can pull out the win!

**vayyiqra** (7.769): I feel like I never fully got into this album when it was big. I liked all the singles from it, but I feel like it wavers in the second half and the rock opera part doesn't really come through. Still, it is a classic and even though Hybrid Theory is my favourite in this rate, this one is probably the best overall. Overall rating: 7.77.

**Brendon-Urine** (5.231): I just can't get into the sound of this album. It's so straightforward and basic, even the singles are grating for me. Not my sect of punk/emo.

radiofan15: # #1: Evanescence - Bring Me to Life

---

**Average:** 9.506 **// Total Points:** 446.8 **// Controversy:** 1.131

---

**Highest scores:**

(11 x6) ElectricBoogaloo41, radiofan15, Raykel, THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD, twat\_brained, waluigiest


**Lowest Scores:**

(7 x1) omgcow

(6 x2) cheatviathan, static\_int\_husp


---

At some point this was actually #2, and even #3 briefly... but talent prevailed and Evanescence deservedly won at the end...

---

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): The combination of a powerful instrumental and great vocals really makes this song. The guest vocals also make the already strong chorus even more unique.

**Raykel** (11): I listened to this the first time in middle school which is the perfect time for such an angsty song. It then introduced me to mcr, 30stm, flyleaf, etc. Which made up my early high school tatse before I branched out to other genres. Basically this song got me to connect with music.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): i dont trust anyone who thinks this is a meme song and not an iconic bop

**twat\_brained** (11): It starts so innocent with that piano and those strings. And then… the drums. You expect to build to a crescendo, and then… one of the most everlasting choruses of the 2000s greets you like a 200 mph train. This song's cultural impact is absolutely undeniable; I'm putting my full faith in this song to win the rate so I can book a ticket to see Evanescence at a rock festival later this year and cement my rediscovery of them.

**waluigiest** (11): I was 6 years old when this song came out, and I was at an after school program where a lot of us listened to the radio. Every time the opening piano for this song would start, someone would say “oooohhhhh this is the song from Daredevil!!” and I would listen intently. But I had no idea what daredevil was. I created this scenario in my head of a woman madly in love with a devil man (red man w/ tail and everything) even though he’s killing her. That was incredibly intense for my six year old body and this song produced a lot of emotions because of the holes I filled into the daredevil story. The first verse was so chilling to me and I thought this was the best music could ever be. Maybe I was right. I could do without the memey “wake me up / can’t wake up” in the chorus but honestly it’s still THAT song

**1998tweety** (10): iconic, obligatory 10. Despite the memes, this still slaps

**Brendon-Urine** (10): The harmonizing in the chorus can get it, I didn't really notice it until now after however many times I've heard this song

**enecks** (10): Memes aside, can we admit this is a masterpiece? It's so intense and melodramatic, but it conveys its angst so intensely.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I think we ALL want to wake up inside

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is so damn good literally iconic

**MrSwearword** (10): VH1 Top 20 Countdown hunties, where you at? Y'all know this song and video very well.

**skargardin** (10): an iconic bop that defined my middle school years, I used to be OBSESSED, it was this close to getting an 11

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): duh obvious ten

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc419laSk_0

**yourhostandpatron** (10): For ages, philosophers have debated on the nature of beauty and aesthetics. From Kant's tyrannical and oftentimes criticized views on what objectively constitutes proper cultural and artistic refinement, to Bourdieu's radical deconstruction of the class-bound origins of individual tastes and preferences, the true definition of where the highest pantheon of humanity's accomplishments can be located has never been truly agreed on. Yet, if modern academia would follow the example of famous Youtuber Natalie Wynn, also known as Contrapoints, they would realize that all their efforts to determine such a qualitative reality in the mere bounds of a classroom have all been in vain. For a man to truly recognize what beauty is, he must gaze into the abyss of chaos. He must reach the point of no return. He must give his soul up at the expense of this enlightenment. There is no work of art best suited for that purpose than Evanescence’s 2001 emo classic, Bring Me To Life. Though other musicians have tried to reach the same depths of gnostic knowledge, most notably in the cases of the Beatles' 'Revolution Number 9', David Bowie's 'The Laughing Gnome', and Charli XCX's 'Vroom Vroom', all this pales in comparison to the spiritual revelations induced by listening to Evanescence's masterpiece of a hit. Arguably the magnum opus of all music ever published, Bring Me To Life would merely be a well-written, if slightly melodramatic pop rock hit merely destined to lay deep within one's memories of the early 00s if not for the magnificent presence of Paul McCoy, front leader of the long forgotten Christian post-grunge group, 12 Stones. The fact that Christian post-grunge was a thing is enough for a man to go mad, but, thankfully, one’s amazement does not stop at this incredulity. Though McCoy was originally planned to be a mere channel for making Bring Me To Life hop onto a now-defunct and forgotten nu metal bandwagon, his voice acts as a vessel for the same demons that tempted Doctor Faustus to sell his salvation so many centuries ago to be once again conjured into the physical world.  Throughout the duration of Bring Me To Life, McCoy drops the Evangelical mask of his musical background, and unintentionally reveals his experience with the dark depths of some of the most powerful ceremonial magic ever known to mankind, as he rasps sinister, Kabbalahistic invocations, some of which include 'WAKE ME UP', 'CAN'T WAKE UP', and the unbelievably reality-shattering 'I'VE BEEN LIVING A LIE'. Not even Crowley and his Golden Dawn have thought of rituals this dark. Combined with the already terrifyingly potent capabilities of Amy Lee's voice, Bring Me To Life becomes something buried too deep within the hidden furloughs of fifth dimension for normal humans to even comprehend. By the time McCoy reaches his rap verse, it is all over for the average listener. No man may hear the ancient magick present within Bring Me To Life without becoming a shadow of his former self. When I first streamed this song, by its final chorus, I was already laughing madly to such an extent that by the time I came to my senses, I was in an asylum. My panicked family had brought me there to restore my mind. It was too late. I had seen everything. I had seen the primordial depths of existence itself. No god could save me from the nothing I'd become. No other song could have brought me back to life. From that day forth, I began my descent into eternal suffering - or, as I am desperate enough to now call it, eternal bliss. There is no turning back from the mark that Bring Me To Life has inflicted on my soul. And, for that, I give it my sincere gratitude.

**rotating3Dtext** (9.8): the rap is GRATING but… still

**jolteonhoodie** (9.5): That long held note at the end kills me

**CarlieScion** (9): bop

**Roxieloxie** (9): Queen of AMV's

**vayyiqra** (9): Much like Crawling, this is, memes aside, a great song, and I was too embarassed to admit liking it when I was 13. But it would be better without that guy yelling those random lines in the chorus. Side note: the orchestral version should've been in the bonus rate, it's pretty good..

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This makes me a buzzkill, but I can't stand the fact that this song is still being memed to death, 15 years after its release. I can't really listen to it because of that, thus it only gets an eight instead of the ten it deserves.

**minibjork** (8): the rap almost ruins this song .... almost.

**cheatviathan** (6): I only thought it was okay when I first heard it, and that hasn’t changed. Overplay and memes haven’t made it worse for me, so that’s something.

radiofan15: # Fallen

**Overall Average**: 7.839 **// Average Controversy:** 1.581

Best debut album of all time... sorry, I don't make the rules [Score: A+]

---
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.682): an iconic album of my childhood that deserves to slay this rate

**asdivval** (9.355): 10

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.727): My personal favorite of the three albums on this rate, but probably my least favorite of the three pre-Synthesis Evanescence records. Nonetheless, this album is an example of a debut project done right.

**enecks** (8.636): This is my prefered flavour of emo.

**twat\_brained** (8.618): Why have I let this album sit with my catalog of other unlistened CDs in my house? It's bloody fuckin brilliant this!

**Brendon-Urine** (8.318): This was a surprise to me. I thought I'd just like the singles that I already knew so well but the other tracks hold up pretty well.

**ManofOranges** (8.273): Never listened to this album before but I knew of it because of the legendary song that is bring me to life. After listening to it I must say I'm fairly impressed. I think one of the things that makes this album so good is the fact that it's a female vocalist. Call me biased but I think this "twist" if you can call it that adds something really unique to these songs that a lot of bands don't necessarily have. The vocals aren't the sole reason the songs are good but they do contribute I believe. Other than that though, this album sounds really good, if not quite a bit depressing.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.955): Delightfully dramatic. This definitely deserves the praise I've heard for it over the years. Amy Lee is simply a captivating voice and she really sells the angst of the genre. There really isn't a low point on here. [Grade: A-]

**waluigiest** (7.636): where would we be without Amy Lee

**minibjork** (7.191): amy lee is an angel (avg. 7.2)

**hikkaru** (7.182): It was definitely a lot easier to appreciate the harder guitars in this album than it was with Hybrid Theory thanks to the fact that Amy Lee foregoes screaming and instead just serves nice vocals.

**timothy444** (7.091): The last couple of songs aren't bad, but the problem is that once you reach the halfway point, it feels like you're going through the leftovers.

**iamhalsey** (7.045): Some great tracks but overall an overrated album. Call Me When You're Sober and Lithium alone are better than anything on Fallen.

**vayyiqra** (7.000): This was my first time hearing this album, only knowing a couple of songs from it and also the memorable cover. I never was that into nu metal or the goth subculture, but I can appreciate it as a fairly solid debut. Overall rating: 7.00.

**MrSwearword** (7.000): Don't be fooled by my album score, I think highly of Amy Lee as a vocal powerhouse.

**yourhostandpatron** (6.909): Fallen is...a very special record, I must say. Pick five albums that seem forever stuck in the year or time period in which they were released, and it'll be one of the first candidates for the category. Evanescence's entire legacy, if it has one, is actually rather pox-marked, if I'm being honest. Their aesthetic is questionable in hindsight, nobody likes the kind of pop rock masqueraded as emo or gothic that they did anymore, and the only thing kids these days know about the band all comes from shitty memes and shitty fanfics. My commentary for Fallen, in turn, is often critical in hindsight. So, why am I willing enough to admit that I actually non-ironically enjoyed the album? I don't know. I can't think of words to describe all the possible merits you could find in Fallen that don't involve a small set of words ending with 'bop'. Maybe this is the least offensive example of what could constitute a guilty pleasure. Maybe Fallen just brings out the inner Ebony Darkness Dementia Raven Way in me. What can I say? I don't know if I'd really be comfortable considering this album a good one, but, fuck it all, I enjoyed it. That's more important to me right now then any ideas about objective quality. So, Amy Lee, you therefore have my grudging respect. if you don't know who she is, get da hell out of here!!!

**cheatviathan** (6.273): This was another relic of my “angry white boy” phase. “Bring Me to Life” was always just kinda there in the background without interest from me, but hearing the other singles crop up on Pandora convinced me to give this album a shot. I thought “My Immortal” was the most heart-wrenching thing in the world. Relistening to it, I was expecting it to sound way worse in hindsight. Parts of it do, but this album is still pretty decent overall.
