Aughties Rock Bands Rate Reveal Day 1: We should have rated Meterora instead
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/bsl4tt/aughties_rock_bands_rate_reveal_day_1_we_should/

Hello bisexuals, emos and goths.... welcome to the first day of the Aughties Rock Bands Rate, the barely-anticipated match between Evanescence's debut album ***Fallen***, Linkin Park's debut album ***Hybrid Theory***, and, for some reason, Green Day's fifth studio album ***American Idiot***.

Today we will be revealing the bottom third of the songs on the main rate (36-25) and bonus rate (20-13), and some entries of the adjacent rate Aughtiesvision. WE SHOULD BE STARTING AT 3 PM EST, OR 30 MINUTES FROM THE PUBLISHING OF THIS POST, **BUT BE SURE TO BE THERE EARLIER, AND BE THERE I MEAN THE PLACE WHERE MOST OF THE FUN HAPPENS:**  [**https://plug.dj/popheads**](https://plug.dj/popheads)**.**

And now some stats:

* Number of participants: 47 ([list of participants](https://pastebin.com/GE5rDy5L)) ^(and i thought this rate would flop)
* Average score: 7.600
* Average controversy score: 1.715 (anything above this should be considered controversial)

**SONGS REMAINING**:

We know we ain't rating their 00s efforts... but *Beverly Hills* and *Pork & Beans* still slaps

**LuckyKidA** (9): this rating has nothing to do with any of their 2000s albums

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): They rub me the wrong way… I like ‘Say it ain’t so’ tho (but that’s from the 90s).

So the Green Day bassist, who sings here, hates Arnold Schwarzenegger and the fact he was Governor of California (hence the title... get it? issa pun!) so he decided to write this song about... something... politicians I guess. Look, I understand how ridiculous was the notion that Arnold of all people was governor of California, but if you're gonna criticize that, then FUCKIGN DO IT... outside of a reference to his popularity there's nothing here that doesn't sound like a template for any charismatic politician, it's just empty criticism in the blandest of packages

This is Green Day in auto-pilot, basically every cliche you might expect from them is included here. The only positive part is how is this is a Bush diss track and yet it kinda falls flat because it doesn't say anything noteworthy about him... I mean, even Katy's ''old coupon expired'' line was a better diss than calling someone a drag 12 times.

#THE FEW BRAVE ONES

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): A surprisingly enjoyable instrumental track manages to relieve most of the stress still left from listening to tracks 2 to 5.

**ManofOranges** (9): This one sounds kinda weird within the album I think but it was a really nice change of pace I really liked it

**static\_int\_husp** (9): absolutely did not expect this instrumental, but it's pretty good

**waluigiest** (8): I was NOT expecting this and honestly? It worked.

**twat\_brained** (7.9): knowing popheads this is out day 1 but I like this as an instrumental composition away from Chester's non-melodic shrieking and Mike's r/im14andthisisdeep rhymes.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): wow those record scratches. yes, I like this instrumental more than other songs on this album

**Roxieloxie** (7.2): Is this a mitski song?!?

**1998tweety** (7): The track that stands out the most from the rest of the album, for that alone it deserves some points.

#EVERYONE ELSE

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): i dont know what this is but like it's ok i guess???

**cheatviathan** (6): Linkin Park’s instrumental tracks were never particularly interesting to me, and this is no exception.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): did the guy at the beginning say "Monster Hiiiiiiiiiiigh" in that super low distorted voice?

**vayyiqra** (6): This song, or really interlude, was a meme with me and my brothers before we even knew what memes were. It's kind of pointless and basically just a discount Moby beat, but Mr. Hahn deserves to have the limelight for a bit. (Or should I say, MR. HAAAAAAHN)

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5.5): i hate interludes and especially those over 2 minutes but at least this tries to be experimental

**enecks** (5): Alongside his dark and violent demeanor, Shadow can be smug and stubborn. He treats others in a very callous manner, throwing in his opinion no matter how cold-hearted it is and not caring for whatever the response is. Shadow is also shown to have a sharp wit, like in Sonic Adventure 2, where after Sonic calls him a faker, he replies that Sonic isn't worth being considered his fake, and in Shadow the Hedgehog, he taunts Black Doom's eye for having trouble with GUN.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9r0QqIBeY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE9r0QqIBeY)

**yourhostandpatron** (5): If Cure for the Itch doesn't end up dead-up last in this rate, I would be surprised. Much like No Friend, this sub is unlikely to get the actual purpose behind this song existing so close to the end of this record, and even if they do, any chance that they'll enjoy Cure For the Itch even after understanding the concept behind it isn't too high either. From what I can glean from reading about this song, it's intended to show of Hahn's mixing skills by taking listeners on a two and a half minute trip of general wackiness. There's nothing really unplesant about this, you could imagine that the guy would make his mixing here a little more interesting. A sense of general discomfort also seeps through Cure For The Itch, evident from the sounds of people coughing in the track's background and the vocal distortion effect that takes place shortly after the chaos begins. I'm sad to say this, but all of this just isn't really that fun. I can see why a brief intermission before Pushing Me Away was necessary, but this wasn't necessarily the best choice for it.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3.5): Instrumental interlude, it's pretty boring

**minibjork** (1): yea what is this

**Brendon-Urine** (0): wha... what? An interlude really doesn't make sense on this album, especially since it's just a boring instrumental

TBH this is one of the Linkin Park songs I've heard somewhere but I can't put my finger where... the opening guitar is quite iconic in itself (and kinda predicted how Metallica would sound during their St. Anger era), and even the chorus get stuck in my head with the screams and everything. This is, overall, a passable deep cut, although I understand some of the resistance to it...

---

#THEY GET IT

**ImADudeDuh** (9): oh maybe they snapped on these verses

**1998tweety** (8): Ok now this is how you make screaming work. The production suits the screaming bits really well too.

**enecks** (8): Shadow is a black hedgehog with red stripes on his quills, around the edges of his eyes, and on his arms and legs. He has red eyes, a patch of white fur on his chest, and his muzzle is tan. He has six quills on his head, four of which curve upwards and two that curve downwards, two spines on his back, and a small tail. For attire, Shadow wears white gloves with black cuffs and red tongues, and Air Shoes which, like his gloves, have black cuffs and red tongues. On each of his wrists and ankles, he wears a single gold ring.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-mJKzaKJHg

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): the chorus is the best part of this

**vayyiqra** (7): When did RATM start doing triphop? I want to say this is kind of filler, but then Chester sings I CAN'T HOLLLLD ONNNNN and I remember this is lowkey a banger.

**twat\_brained** (0): Pun intended, I've become absolutely numb to the sound of this album and it's grown quite tedious at this point. I completely mean no disrespect to Chester's legacy with this 0; it just feels like a total dud in an album which, let's face it, is on an inferior level to its opposition on this rate.

# THE SCREAMS, MAKE THEM STOP

**rotating3Dtext** (7): those screams are too disturbing

**yourhostandpatron** (7): I actually really love the sheer amount of frustration Chester conveys with his vocals during most of Hybrid Theory, even with all the shouting and all, because the way he puts all that baggage into his performances makes all Linkin Park's songs in this rate even more powerful and uncomfortably admirable than how they work be if they were any more subtle. With that being said, I honestly think that the extent to which this is utilized on By Myself is...a little distracting. It's another song where I don't mind such a display of emotion, but coupled with this record's somewhat dated production, the end result isn't too enjoyable. Whatever flaws By Myself has, though, I can't really call it bad or even mediocre in general, especially since it doesn't kill any momentum within Hybrid Theory's tracklist. Even then, though, it's a song I'd like to see modified a little.

**cheatviathan** (5): This is the only song from the album that I haven’t memorized the lyrics for. I don’t know. This and “Hit the Floor” from Meteora were the only times that Chester’s screaming stopped being exhilarating and crossed over into obnoxious.

**static\_int\_husp** (4.5): please less screaming choruses

**waluigiest** (4): listening to this is stressful, which is the point I guess

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): The rap part of this song is cringy to me and the singing is painfully scream-y

**Brendon-Urine** (2): TOO MUCH EDGE MAKE IT STOP

#MARIAH CAREY - WITH YOU.mp3

**minibjork** (8.5): chester is giving me trent reznor vocal realness w/ this one ladies

**twat\_brained** (8.3): okay I'm starting to get into the swing of this album, I feel

**cheatviathan** (8): We don’t have enough turntable solos in modern pop music.

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Following up the already furious rants of One Step Closer, With You continues this album's trend of directing anger-filled music towards a shadowy and unnamed antagonist. Really, at times, Hybrid Theory can feel as if it's directed against one single individual. The trend isn't really innovated or expanded on here, aside from providing an outlet for the band to release their angst with a little less shouting, but despite not doing much to buckle the formula, With You still snaps pretty damn hard. It's not a deep cut likely to attract attention, but if you like the rest of this record, you'll like this one.

**1998tweety** (7): slaps hard, Mariah Carey outskinned though

**hikkaru** (7): avril lavigne's "i'm with you" but the title lyrics are replaced by the screaming from this song

**vayyiqra** (7): I've always seen this song as filler, but now I think I was wrong. The electronic samples are really cool?? And the distorted guitar lead is too?? Underrated.

#MARIAH CAREY - WITHOUT YOU.mp3

**Roxieloxie** (6): the singing rap thing on the chorus isnt really doing it for me

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): sorry but miss jessica simpson came along and did with you better in 2003

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): this is literally the only song without a call of duty montage to accompany it

**enecks** (5): His purpose was to provide ways to develop a cure for incurable deadly illnesses, more specifically for Gerald's granddaughter Maria Robotnik, but he was captured and put into stasis by the military when he was deemed as a threat to humanity.

**waluigiest** (5): it’s kind of slippery in a concerning way… the rapping (is it rap?) leaves a lot to be desired

**wanderingimpromptu3** (4): Feels like filler, I can't remember it after I listen to it

I like you Chester B. and everything... but this chorus is just anticlimatic, and Mike's rap gets annoying after a while.

The only reason this gets anything above a 2 is because of that whispered and then screamed bridge

---

#ON THE SHOULDERS

**waluigiest** (9): weirdly funky and the bridge lmfao

**cheatviathan** (8): The guitar riffs throughout are cool, I like the intensity that Chester brings in the latter half of the song. I can’t help but giggle at the “sun doesn’t give light to the moon assuming the moon’s gonna owe it one,” line tho.

**enecks** (8): Shadow also does not mind boasting about how powerful he is, calling himself the "Ultimate Lifeform" and, like Sonic, can be extremely arrogant, often belittling his opponents and insulting their lack of strength. He believes no one can beat him and tends to see anyone as a fool for challenging him. Shadow also has a ruthless and merciless edge in combat that all other characters in the series lack and displays a natural "killer instinct".

**yourhostandpatron** (8): It's a weird comparison, but I have to wonder if Tove Lo got inspired to create The Way That I Am from this song. I can hear some melodic and lyrical similarities between both of their choruses. Enough of my strange and more likely than not invalid observations, though; this is another refreshingly angry description of what it's like to to have one's thoughts ridden by anxiety and insecurity almost perpetually that, ironically, it might act to listeners who've experienced these series of emotions before as a relief to have their voices heard. Of course, the majority of people used to see songs like this as 'whiny' until Chester's death, so, haha! I love how sensitive humans are! Personally, I haven't been in an incredibly bad state of mind for a long time, but I still relate to this kind of mental exhaustion.

**1998tweety** (7.5): The screaming kind of works on this

**twat\_brained** (7.1): …is this where Tyler Joseph gets his inspiration to scream in his songs?

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): The choruses are atrociously anticlimactic.

**Roxieloxie** (7): the guitar in this is the highlight

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): i feel like this song just falls a lil flat after In The End

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVWoq3J7Kyw

#BETWEEN MY LEGS

**hikkaru** (6): that bridge made me cringe i don't like his whispers it made me anxious waiting for the screaming to kick in

**ImADudeDuh** (6): have you tried on top of your shoulders?

**vayyiqra** (6): I used to like the guitar riff, but this is so ... aggressively okay. It's awfully close to filler.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3.5): Not really memorable, feels like filler

**Brendon-Urine** (3): Kinda just sounds like filler to me

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): you know this really captures a 11 year old's tantrum

The only reason this one gets something above a five is because at least there's some musical dynamism here and there... and also that guitar slaps!

---

#

**1998tweety** (9.5): Ok this slaps hard, I like the production and the rap/spoken bit works well.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): hey I like this

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): this is quintessential emo

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3hImephDwg

**vayyiqra** (8): The angst is swelling in me. I can't believe you stood me up on that date when we were 12, Leanna! Jk this song rocks.

**yourhostandpatron** (8): I've heard speculation that this is intended to be directed at Chester Bennington's abusive friend from some analyses of Hybrid Theory, and while it feels wrong to pry on who this song could possibly be about, such an interpretation would make sense given some of Points of Authority's spiels, especially a lyric after the chorus that goes 'You live what you've learned!' (I don't want to explain what happened to Chester here, but look it up. That lyric can be a bit haunting with some additional, although as of yet unverified, context.) This track becomes even more personal as a result, which ends up in a whole outburst of anger that makes for a heck of a deep cut. It took some time for me to get how good Points of Authority was, but now it's one of my favourite non-singles on Hybrid Theory. I also get the impression that a song with as much vocal runs as this one could be remade into soul music, strangely enough. I suppose we sort of got that with Collision Course? Either way, this is pretty good.

**cheatviathan** (7): The lyrical content didn’t do much for me, even at the time, but that guitar riff goes hard. That riff was put to good use on Collision Course.

**enecks** (6): Fifty years later, Shadow was released by Dr. Eggman in order to enlist him in his plan to conquer the world. Initially, Shadow worked with him but secretly sought to destroy the planet in order to avenge Maria, who had been killed by the military, but was persuaded to save it from Gerald's doomsday plans.

**waluigiest** (6): painful and hard, again the rapping hurts emotional delivery

#SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): I remember absolutely nothing about this song and I don't really want to come back to listening to it.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (4): Feels like filler, I can't remember it after I listen to it

Another subdued song with an anticlimatic chorus... Linkin Park's ealier sound can be easily defined and its definitely bland...

---

#KANYE OUTSOLD BUT THIS IS FINE TOO

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I like Chester's voice the most of all tracks on here. The chorus is catchy melodically and lyrically. The bridge is noisy and loud just enough for my liking. My personal favorite on the album.

**enecks** (9): Shadow is sharp-witted, always on edge, and has a strong sense of purpose, willing to accomplish his goals by any means.[5] Essentially a dark version of Sonic, Shadow can match him in both speed and skill, and can use Chaos Control with a Chaos Emerald. While preferring to work alone, he has helped Sonic and his allies when needed.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAvF_D1w_fg

**cheatviathan** (8): Even if the melodrama of the lyrics is more apparent now, the breakdown still sounds hard as hell, and the chorus is sticky.

**Roxieloxie** (8): I hate this town

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): i suddenly grew an emo hairstyle again

**vayyiqra** (8): Did he really do a call-and-response ... with himself? What a madman. No really, it's amazing how Chester carries this whole song by himself. We lost such a talent. RIP king. Also, the bridge is so edgy I need a new knife rack.

**waluigiest** (8): I can’t decide if this song is fake deep or extremely relatable

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Linkin Park's literally admitted to making Runaway for the sake of having album filler in the past, something which should indicate a fairly mediocre track. On the contrary, fans apparently see it as one of the best deep cuts off Hybrid Theory. I have to wonder what that says about the song. I can definitely deduce how Runaway was made merely for the sake of being made just by listening to it since it just doesn't have a sense of uniqueness to it that make many other songs from Hybrid Theory come to life, and that makes me puzzled as to why such a song could be beloved. From what I've observed, I might have to chalk the love for it up to relatability more than anything. That's not to say that Runaway doesn't go off, though. It may be fairly standard fare, but it uses the same formula the rest of Hybrid Theory uses that I've found myself enjoying a surprising amount of times.

#KANYE OUTSOLD... PLAIN AND SIMPLE

**1998tweety** (7): the first half slapped but then it got a bit too screamy for my tastes oop

**iamhalsey** (6): Kanye did it better.

**Brendon-Urine** (5): Could have done without the section before the last chorus... we need an appropriate amount of edge, this was too much

**twat\_brained** (8.6): I hadn't even realized this had started until like 1:15 after APFMH ended. If anything, it feels like the album's getting a second wind from this song.

**Roxieloxie** (8.5): I'm not feeling these verses so much on the album but the choruses slap!!

**1998tweety** (8): I think there are multiple people singing on this? It works pretty well

**cheatviathan** (8): “And the memory now is like the picture was then / Once the paper’s crumpled up, it can’t be perfect again.” That line touched my 13-year-old soul like no other.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Putting the chorus as the intro to this song is one of the best structural decisions taken on this record.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Caught in the Act on All Stars 5 pls

**vayyiqra** (8): Why does this call-and-response thing get me like this? I feel like I've been underrating Mike Shinoda just because I don't like rapping. This song BANGS

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Forgotten is perhaps the most straightforward rap track on this album, only barely crossing the territory of being a rock song because of its heavy production. There's not as much glamour here as there is in the exaggeration and wit that the best rap generally aims for, and I can understand why people would call Forgotten bland as a result, but within the context of Hybrid Theory, I think it's decent. Chester's rapping is pretty good for a white guy's (if Jay-Z thinks so, then I do, too) and the song does a great job in conveying the emotions behind this album without being as blatantly angry or hopeless as other tracks (which isn't a bad thing, but that can be overwhelming for some listeners, mind you). It's not the best of what it's influenced by, but it does its job pretty well, and I like it.

**iamhalsey** (7): The best non-single.

**enecks** (4): Shadow's infamous ruthlessness and aggression lead to fear and a nervousness that inhibits characters from his unshakable intent or sheer power in combat. Numerous characters from the Sonic series have shown absolute dread from encountering Shadow. Shadow's enemies never treat him lightly; he is one of the very few people Sonic takes seriously and acts hostile towards.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): i didnt realize a new song started tbh

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): It may be unfair but I find all their rap heavy songs pretty cringy lyrically

**Brendon-Urine** (2): More filler, but this time with excessive edge

Personally hurt by the placement of this one, as this is one my favorites songs overall of the band; I even remember doing an AMV with this song back in the day.

The chorus fucking slaps and the verses, one of the album's biggest weakness, actually works... however, because r/Popheads is in a crusade against Linkin Park this track had to suffer the consequences...

**Roxieloxie** (10): This physically transported me back to my local hot topic

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): this song is nothing less than double digits

**Brendon-Urine** (9): ?a quien estas diciendo shutup, a MI estas diciendo shutup?

**minibjork** (9): i love this song okay leave me alone

**vayyiqra** (9): What a BANGER. The guitar is even crunchier, the angst is even more suburban, and the hair is even spikier. It might be repetitive, but I admire the chutzpah of a band that chooses to end a song by screaming SHUT UP WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOUUUU over and over.

**waluigiest** (9): THE BRIDGE OH MY GOD

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Unfortunately, I forgot to write a for One Step Closer. I'll just go ahead and say that there's no wonder that this was the single that brought so much attention to Linkin Park. The song's just such an outrageous burst of fury in energy that it immediately grabs your opinion, as well as describing the point of Hybrid Theory as an album in two and a half precious minutes. A definite favorite of mine, although I wish it was slightly longer.

**jolteonhoodie** (8.7): SHUT UUUUUUUP!

**cheatviathan** (8): From the iconic guitar riff on the verses, to Chester’s exasperated shouts of “Shut Up” on the bridge paired with some cool turntable scratches, this song is a banger. The perfect lead single.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): SHUT UP

**twat\_brained** (7.4): Does anyone else think they're trying way too hard to be Rage Against the Machine here? This sounds like the kind of music that gets scapegoated as what's turning teenagers into deviants.

**enecks** (7): Shadow was created as the "Ultimate Life Form" (究極生命体 Kyūkyoku Seimeitai?) by Gerald Robotnik, using the DNA of Black Doom, and is the end result of Project Shadow.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRLKtoOzFNI

**ElizabethDDoS** (3): This bridge and song shouldn't exist. The memories of how much I used to despise the track almost made me not return to the record and thus skip this rate altogether. Turns out I still despise it.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1.5): funny as a meme but like id rather not listen to this ever

Korn is one of my favorite rock bands... there, I said it... having them lurking this rate is some personal bias. Although I kinda outgrow them, I still enjoy some of their recent material and I can go back to the classics without cringing, which bring me to the subject of this track.

Although I understand the harshness of the lyrics get subdued by the acoustic arrangement, both Jonathan Davis and Amy Lee sound heavenly together, and her vocal run during the bridge is one of my favorite vocal moments of her career... I know Korn is not for everyone, but I can't believe this one got such a low score... ugh, r/Popheads always disappointing me...

What are those drums at the start? and that played-out metaphor? This ain't good at all, but for some reason it nearly made it to Day 2... until some people with taste sunk it as they should...

---

**enecks** (10): Maybe the tightest riff and instrumentation in this album. This also foreshadows the more out-there influences for the musical direction that would lead to 21st Century Breakdown.

**cheatviathan** (9): The ominous drums that open the song before the guitars come crashing in are cool. That guitar riff is cool, and the vocal melody in the verses gets stuck in my head at random intervals throughout the day.

**Roxieloxie** (9): I forget this song exist on the album but it still slaps

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): She's a Rebel and Extraordinary Girl both really do seem like they're two suites of the same song, in a slightly less pronounced fashion than Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming do, so I suppose I'm going to reserve one comment for both songs. On they're own, they're pretty much just your usual 'my (potential) girlfriend is amazing' kind of rock fair, but in the context of American Idiot's narrative, the songs, are, er, just about the same. That's not to say either of them are bad, because I actually really like them, but they're yet another example of how messy yet easily appealing the story of this record is; nothing about Jesus's love interest is really described here, aside from the fact that she's a rebel (even says so in the title!). Everybody in this entire goddamn universe if a rebel. That doesn't matter, though, because Green Day put some actual effort into American Idiot, and both songs go off as a result. Ah, the things they get away with on this album! I suppose that's a positive quality on its own, and I swear to God I'm not trying to roast them.

**twat\_brained** (7.3): those drums at the beginning were a major fakeout, but what was the point of them? there were like 50 seconds of them lol. I think "She's a Rebel" speaks higher of women than "Extraordinary Girl" does if you ask me

**1998tweety** (7): These past couple songs have been kind of boring oop

**minibjork** (6.5): should i feel more embarrassed that i still like these songs post-middle school??

Featuring barely any Chester, this track is actually a remix from a track of their demo EP (also called Hybrid Theory), featuring Mike Shinoda raping about how the band struggles to be taken seriously, while also (correctly) stating how the band would last longer than the genre they were identfied with... basically a bragadoccio track combined with a Disney ''look at me'' song. It's no bad by any means, it's quite chill and nicely produced, and Shinoda's rhymes and flow are quite on point, but the lack of Chester and the abrupt ending kills any chance for this track to truly succeed and stick as intended.

OH NO FUCK THAT this is one of the best songs on the album, and truly deserved better... I mean, that religious chorus and the strong guitar work truly sells the heavily dramatism of this track better than most tracks. THIS is the best album closer of any of the albums here and I'm not gonna accept that this one went out so soon!

---

#SELENA GOMEZ

**jolteonhoodie** (11): What an epic album closer. I just wish I could clone myself so I could sing both parts of the chorus instead of awkwardly leaving some lines unfinished

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): an absolute snatch of a prechorus and an absolute SNATCH of a bridge or whatever that part is called im calling it the bridge ok

**asdivval** (9): Still not as good as the orchestral demo version

**1998tweety** (8): Wow the emo really jumped out on this song huh

**Brendon-Urine** (8): I love the outro on this with the viking chants.

**Roxieloxie** (8): I really like this as a closing track

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): not the best song on the album but a strong closer, especially for debut!

**twat\_brained** (8): I personally would've chosen "Taking Over Me" for the closer but this does a fine job all on its own

**waluigiest** (8): goth soft metal baroque angsty queens!

**cheatviathan** (7): I remember being lukewarm on this one as a teen, but this actually grew on me. The choir vocals towards the end of the track are a turnoff that meander for too long, but it works as a closer, and the other instrumental bits are implemented tastefully.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Some parts, especially the bridge and the outro, feel a tad bit too edgy and over-exaggerated than they should be. The first half of the track is enjoyable enough to save it from being the worst one on the album.

**vayyiqra** (7): A symphonic metal banger is a great way to close the album. They really added chanting in Latin too. G O T H I C C

#MADONNA ON EUROVISION

**hikkaru** (6): long

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR3o9dToifc

**yourhostandpatron** (6): Legitimately the only distinct things about Whisper are that it's more resistant and less drenched in fatal hopelessness than many other songs off Fallen, which is naturally a positive trait, and the fact that it has a spooky Latin chorus at the end, abandoning Amy Lee's presumably anti-liturgical, anti-Catholic evangelical upbringing. You can roll your eyes at that outro, but deep down you can also admit to yourself that it's actually kind of cool. It's a real bloody shame, then, that I can't find anything about what the Latin means when I Google this song. Evanescence's fanbase really ought to do better! I have many languages to learn before I even approach Latin. My linguistic ramblings aside, Whisper can get lost in the sea of forgetfulness since it doesn't sound too distinct from its parent album, but it's actually somewhat sweet if you ignore that.

**MrSwearword** (0): "catch me as I fall" OK FUCK THIS SONG it's quite literally a Bring Me To Life first draft that somehow ended up on this album.

Quite the anthemic track... it's quite different from the other tracks here but i'm not complaining, as it's a nice breath of fresh air...

This one also mostly made it to Day 2 but unfortunately the late-votes kinda killed its momentum.

---

**enecks** (10): A slower, yet more anthemic moment. A pivotal narrative moment of wondering and wandering for purpose.

**ManofOranges** (10): Really like this song because its more laid back also it's just a good switch up from the more high octane stuff

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I dig the chanting

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Are We The Waiting is really more of a transition song than most of American Idiot is, and, in a way, it actually feels like a direct build-up to St.Jimmy instead of acting like its equal sibling. For that reason, I find it somewhat difficult to right about. The one big moment here is Billy Joe Armstrong singing 'The Jesus of Suburbia is a lie', which is musically subtle, but a turning point of sorts for the messy narrative that fills up American Idiot. This really is the type of track that should settle into you instead of getting you hyped up right away on your first few listens of the album it belongs to, and whether it's effective or not in doing so is up to the listener. Personally, I think it is!

**twat\_brained** (7.5): what are we waiting for? I can't identify it in the song

**minibjork** (7.3): why did this song make me cry before i even knew about the concept of pain @11yrsold

**cheatviathan** (7): I really wish I could grade this and “St. Jimmy” together, because they work better as a package deal. The track by itself doesn’t offer much beyond some cool arpeggios and lyrics detailing the protagonist’s arrival in the city.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): surprisingly didn’t find a skateboarding video for this one

Bisexual icon Billy Joe Armstrong writes a very heterosexual song about his girlfriend at the time (now his wife) when he was 19 and then shelves it for it to be used as part of the American Idiot musical.. and somehow that song ends up as the best original Green Day song of out bonus rate, which is really not to much of a compliment to begin with, chalk it up to the cute but clumsy lyrics written by what it's still a teenager in love or how weirdly is shoehorned within the American Idiot concept and sound

Another shameless attempt for me to include some Korn in this rate, this track was performed live during their Fallen Tour in 2004 (and, as you might have expected, it's a Korn cover) and it deals with the Columbine shooting from the point of view of the shooters... sure, the subject matter is quite harsh but this is somethign novel for Evanescence, and somehow the combination between soft gothic piano and nu metal sensibilities works amazingly. Definitely one of my faves from this rate.

Oh God one of my favorites is out way too early... such a shame because this one truly deserved better...

Sure, it trades similar territory to some other tracks, but the sole fact they were able to put the word Tourniquet in the chorus and making it work is quite noble TBH...

---

#THESE COMMENTS BELONG TOGETHER...

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): "i want to die!!!!!!!!" finally some #relatable emo screeches in one of these songs

**hikkaru** (7.5): i want to dieeeeeeeeeeee

**minibjork** (7.5): if enough people respond to the "i want to die" line with "mood" i will delete my reddit account

#MY GOD...

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This track had the potential to be the best on the album, if not for the chorus that ultimately falls flat compared to other parts of the song.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): tbh i've always been impressed that someone was ale to successfully use tourniquet in a song

**twat\_brained** (7.6): Oh so is this some sort of occult song? Are they actually trying to be Christian rock when they talk about Christ? And then there's the suicide, and this outro is uh… oh it leads into Imaginary, okay.

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is kind of filler-y and unnecessarily long

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Tourniquet is essentially Everybody's Fool's spiritual sister from my point of view, because a. both songs sound the same, much like how I'd describe the vast majority of Fallen, and b. I'm divided about both of their narratives from an ethical and political perspective. I'm not going to say with definite sureness on whether Amy Lee really has the right to sing a song about being suicidal so casually, or at least casually as emo pop rock can get (and, for what it's worth, apparently this is a cover from a bloody Christian metal band! Talk about wack). I don't have a problem with the religious content on Tourniquet either, speaking as a fellow who's quite religious myself. And, really, musically, though this track is homogeneous with the rest of the record, it's more immediately memorable than Fallen's second half thanks to the unusual imagery. I'm just not a fan of the way this song approaches the concept of killing oneself, exploring its subject matter as if Evanescence's telling a dramatic story rather than portraying a serious issue that could've very well been a possible occurrence within the band's fanbase. I won't use dreaded words like 'glamorizing' and 'exploring', although come  to think of it, I very well just played myself and did that, but even if I wanna make an edgy joke and call Tourniquet a bop, there's something that strikes me as wrong about it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iybo4lwV2dY

**vayyiqra** (7): Like my comment on Everybody's Fool, this album is surprising me with how metal it is and not rock. This is literally a cover of a song by a death metal band.

**waluigiest** (7): heavy handed with the metaphor tbh

#WHAT'S A TOURNIQUET?

**cheatviathan** (5): It starts off promising, but lines like “I’m pouring crimson regret and betrayal,” the uninteresting guitar work, especially on the bridge, and the screamed “I long to die” before the final chorus make it impossible to take seriously.
