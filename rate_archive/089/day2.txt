Awkward_King: there are like three/four songs from each album i'm confident will make day 3 (julien, no drug like me, want you in my room, next level charli, gone, click, shake it, pang, so hot, door) which leaves about five which i think will be pretty surprising

if i had to guess the other five i think they'd be: now that i found you, too much, silver cross, official and caroline shut up but i think no matter what they end up being a lot of people will be surprised

How poetic that Day 1 ended with 1999 and Day 2 begins with the chopping of its counterpart, 2099. Among the two Troye Sivan collabs, this one is obviously the one that’s more out there and really stretches the pop genre to its limits with blaring synths. If this is a look into the close future of pop music then count me in.

---

# I just wanna go back.. to the future

**1998tweety** (10): Such a good outro, the better Troye collab for sure. It's metallic and future-y, a good note to end the album on.

**Agusarg** (10): The production is stellar. One of her most impressive songs

**Awkward\_King** (10): it feels like im having an auditory panic attack

**CarlieScion** (10): iconic.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i remember this being a tad controversial on the sub but i LOVE it, and it’s much better than 1999 imo. nostalgia lost

**jexan13** (10): this must be how abductions sound like

**Nickl00** (10): I remember waking up in the middle of the night when this song came out and listening to it immediately. I thought it was one of the weirdest things I’d ever heard. And after 100s it plays later, it’s still just as great

**worlds-okayest666** (10): https://media.giphy.com/media/zk6HuNKb9WauQ/giphy.gif

**Xerop681** (10): YASSS

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (10): The song that finally made PC Music click with me. It’s like… I get it now. And this caps off a revelation of an album.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.8): this is the future that liberals want

**anothertown** (9.5): I look forward to listening to this again when i am 107

**bulforster** (9.5): A deservedly dramatic closer to an amazing album.

**puberty1** (9.5): deserves better

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9.5): The Track 10 of the album and the sequel to 1999 goes off here with Charli and Troye propelling us into the futrue and closing the album

**akanewasright** (9): I PULL UP, ROLL UP, FUCK UP, FAST LIKE A NASCAR, NEVER TOUCH US

**ManofOranges** (9): Very futuristic, this might be the closest we'll get to actually experiencing 2099 at this rate.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): At this rate I'll be shocked if the planet makes it to 2099 but if it does I hope this song makes it there too

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9): Such a great way to close out the album

**wavingwolves** (9): a perfect way to close such an album

**titi\_2001** (8.4): A nice song. I like it!

**bandnitos** (8): february 2017 should've been the closer instead of this like they should've switched

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): A banger with mildly nonsensical lyrics.

**leviswift13** (8): solid closer

**megm26** (8): probably biased troye stan in me speaking but I wish troye had at least one (1) line of his own

**sarcasticsobs** (8): doesn’t need troye to me

**thoeoe** (8): v futuristic

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): THIS is what I wanted from the Charli/Troye collab. It’s good but not anything we haven’t heard from Charli before

**vayyiqra** (8): This sounds like the future indeed and is the futuristic pop that Charli was hyped up to be. It's such a good closer.

**Yatcho** (8): This gives STRONG Spongebob future episode, the whole thing sounds like it's covered in chrome and of course "future, FUTURE"

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I pull up roll up fuck up I pull up roll up fuck up I pull up roll up fuck up

**yourfacesucksass** (7.6): Jet ski queen

**rickikardashian** (7.4): the music video for this is just Charli and Troye’s vlog of their bahamas trip

**fishingfor8** (7): shoutout this album, i'm pretty sure i dislike the other albums now since they had to compete with this one.

**hefellapart** (7): i always felt like it was lacking something ngl

**passionfruits2** (7): this song, when it dropped 3 days before the album, was an instant favorite, until i listened to it way too much.

**waluigiest** (7): The production shines here - with headphones this track is STUNNING. Really what hurts this track is that its version of “future” kind of sounds like the soundtrack to an Avengers movie.

# Back to 1999 

**twat\_brained** (6.6): I enjoy it but… this doesn't really… feel… like a sequel to 1999. It feels super underwhelming considering the high bar that song set. Somewhat saved by the music video but all they did was take the "pull off like a jetski" lyric and run with it. That's just one lyric, though. This minimizes everything that 1999 maximized.

**fadedblue09** (5.8): A meh closing track.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (5): Future is bleak if it sounds like this

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Charli wanted to go ride jet skis with Troye but she didn’t want to pay for it so she told the label it was for a music video but then they asked to hear the song so she said she’d play it for them in person and then slapped this together on the car ride over using outtakes and Audacity. Weirdly it’s still better than a good chunk of the album because you can actually, like, hear her voice above the production at some points and it sounds decently cinematic.

**J\_Toe** (4): pls don't make anything that sounds like this again :/

**RandomHypnotica** (4): maybe i'm just dense but i don't see why this is called 2099 other than charli saying "future" a bunch?

**Arybeck67** (2.9): we are not going to party like its 2099 😎

**ImADudeDuh** (2): i gave this an extra point for being the last song on this album.

**bespectacIed** (1): February 2017 and Yaeji's Korean verse were the real closer of the album, not this tacked on, tacky shit.

**ReallyCreative** (0): If this is what we'd be listening to in 80 years, maybe climate change made some points

I’m glad that Carly chose to deliver a disco funk moment now that Disco Sweat will never see the light of day. This track needed some time to grow on me but it became a cute little summery moment that I would return to from time to time. The little quirks and quips during the verses add so much flavour to the song.

---

**waluigiest** (11): The first time I played this album and heard this song, I couldn’t stop smiling. There’s not a single part that doesn’t immediately put me in a great mood. Her soft, almost purring delivery. The syncopation in the pre-chorus. The eerie Popeye interpolation. And the BRIDGE. This song is pure joy and I will never be over it.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (11): The minimalist retro feel on this track is incredible. I love it a̸̫͖͇͐̉̈́̿ḷ̸͚̟̇͗̃͜l̷͍͐ ̷̳̅́͝t̶̰̟̀͂͘͝h̴̗̓͐ȅ̴̫̳̥͝ ̸̦̦͕̓̕w̸̗̉a̷̛̤͌͗y̶̺̔̀̓͗s̶̳̣̩̤̊̂̀

**DaHumanTorch** (10): my third fav on the album, i just love the production on this

**limpyjr** (10): Any song that has an interpolation from a Shelley Duvall song on the Popeye movie’s soundtrack is destined to be great and this song proves that.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This is everything I need

**Sundraliz** (10): Second best pre-chorus to chorus on the album after No Drug Like Me.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): ya know, not just physically..... 𝒆𝒎𝒐𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒚! (っ◔◡◔)っ spiritually ⓘⓝⓣⓔⓛⓛⓔⓒⓣⓤⓐⓛⓛⓨ S͟E͎̘̱X͏̙͖Ṷ͓͠A̜̲͝LͅL͙͙ͅY̢̪͕ 𝒶𝓁𝓁 𝓉𝒽𝑒 𝓌𝒶𝓎𝓈

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): carly said "horny rights!"

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i still don't think this is meant to sound like spooky but it really does

**bulforster** (9.5): Hot Carly who fuuucks. Still kinda weird she's singing about Popeye.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9.5): I can just feel the emotion alongside her

**umadie** (9.2): Best track of the album and I wish more songs on Dedicated were similar to this.

**akanewasright** (9): This was my immediate favorite song off the album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This song is kind of polarizing and tbh I’m not often in the mood to listen to it, but it’s definitely on the upper half of the album. The Popeye sample is inspired and gives the song this weird, cartoonishly dreamy vibe.

**jexan13** (9): this song is so cute and pure... But it needs a tiny hint of extra colour to be perfect.

**ManofOranges** (9): The first time I heard this song I laughed. The song just sounds so funny to me.

**Nickl00** (9): Ok I originally gave this a 7 but I absolutely love it now

**static\_int\_husp** (9): sexually

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): This is so cute, I love how descriptive the verses are

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): While I loved the weirdness of this song when the album dropped (and still do to a degree) it hasn't aged quite as well as I would like, I still really like this song, but it falls short of the other tracks on this album, especially the first 4 songs.

**\_wailordfan** (8.5): the instrumental kinda snapped!

**notceitn** (8.5): ʰᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵐᵉ ʰᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵐᵉ

**wavingwolves** (8.5): the voice effect on sexually sends me for some reason

**1998tweety** (8): Just a bit too weird for mem sorry. It def has grown on me but I don't find myself listening to this that much. I do appreciate Carly taking a risk though.

**anothertown** (8): this is the most galaxy brain sample of the past year and i’m deeply obsessed with it

**bespectacIed** (8): I don't know why this song is so reviled, this is like a skit of a woman so infatuated that she adapts a a 60's pick-me housewife mindset, am I the only the one that thinks it's kinda hilarious. That spoken bridge??? Galaxy-brained

**minibjork** (8): i looove this song because i cant help but imagine carly singing this in like a campy '60s cabaret magician (??) scenario w/ a top hat, cane, & all. carly rae please contact me we can make this happen.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): remember when she just casually sampled popeye the sailor

**vayyiqra** (8): I love how much this bops and the swing feel, but I am taking away a point because one of my pet peeves is that pitched-down voice like in "Warm Blood". It irks me. However on the whole this is a really good song.

**Xerop681** (8): this song needs my 8 this song needs my 8 this song needs my 8 (repeat)

# basique

**megm26** (7.9): you know not just physically emotionally spiritually intellectually sexually all the ways

**Arybeck67** (7): good but forgettable

**hikkaru** (7): it's cute but lowkey don't get the hype

**titi\_2001** (7): I didn't like it at first, but now I kinda do.

**Yatcho** (7): This song is so weird for Carly. The chorus is kind of off-putting and yet so catchy and memorable. I flip flop a lot over whether i like this song or not

**yourfacesucksass** (7): I can hear this playing in H&M, and that's it.

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): this is somehow absolutely awful and amazing at the same time

**leviswift13** (6): ehhhhhh

**Tolk1en** (6): I love Carly sm that I must give it a correct note, but this song is not it. The high "YIII" and low "he needs me" are not pleasant to hear AT ALL. Please Carly, I just want to hear your amazing voice, not these ugly sounds.

**twat\_brained** (6): not very convincing

**bandnitos** (5): ive never really liked this song tbh

**J\_Toe** (5): wasn't the original version of this used in a cat food add?

**alasyorick** (4): sorry sweetie

**fishingfor8** (4): this reminds me of Talk by Khalid

**sarcasticsobs** (4): really does nothing for me i’m so sorry carly

**fadedblue09** (0): I don't understand why this isn't ending up at the bottom of the Dedicated rankings. It's literally a snoozefest and Carly can't pull off these low-key chill type of tracks, plus you have that awful Popeye sample and that super lazy chorus. Also that bridge is the cringiest thing she's done since that Bieber duet.

So the first time I heard this song when it was released as a single I thought to myself that this would make such a good closing track, and it did! The atmospherical production allows her writing to shine and add to the fact that she’s co-produced the song and you have a killer closer track.

---

# Trust it 

**1998tweety** (10): Cheryl Cole outsold. A cute closer though.

**akanewasright** (10): This song only clicked for me when I heard it as the end of the album but god DAMN does it work as a closer.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): lit rally gorjuss luv x

**puberty1** (10): epic

**leviswift13** (9): great closer

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): stunning closing song to a stunning album

**jexan13** (8.5): my god those vocals. Very emotional. Love it

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Caroline Polachek wants what Ingrid Michaelson has

**Arybeck67** (8): tbh Caroline really should’ve ended the album on “Door” or “Go as A Dream” but it’s a great track nevertheless

**bandnitos** (8): not the vibe for rn but its pretty :)

**fadedblue09** (8): Wow this is heavenly!

**ManofOranges** (8): very beautiful

**minibjork** (8): britneyspearsyeah.gif

**Nickl00** (8): Solid end to a pretty great album

**Tolk1en** (8): Only 3 seconds in and I know I must give it a high score. Her soft voice snapped again. Perfect song to end this album and this rate overall.

**waluigiest** (8): glorious harmonies how is EVERY SONG so beautiful on this album???

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): It's a decent closer for the album, but it just doesn't grab my attention like the other tracks. It's a little samey without being as intense or interesting.

**twat\_brained** (7.8): I think it's the wind pulling you to treetops and strip malls. Thankfully, at least, you made it to the soft ground, which I have returned to after this transcendental album

**TinosCallingMeOver** (7.5): A great way to close out the album with a melody that defies prediction

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Caroline takes us to church! But like, the boring white churches that my grandparents make us go to on Sunday where they make you sing really old hymns that sound like this out of little books that are on the back of the pews.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): shoutout to this quote from the Genius page of this song: “Have snippets of the song ever appeared anywhere before?A few short snippets of the song leaked in LQ on YouTube in 2017, rumoured to be part of MARINA’s latest album, LOVE + FEAR.”

# free fall

**fishingfor8** (6): there is something slightly less boring in this song i don't know what it is though

**hefellapart** (6): my least fav single

**Sundraliz** (6): Like, yeah, it's a masterpiece. I'm not super hot on it though.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): Anticlimactic :/

**worlds-okayest666** (6): gorl...this is pretty but absolutely unneeded, especially considering how well door works as a closer

**bespectacIed** (5): what a boring closer to a really interesting album

**vayyiqra** (5): I can barely rate this because it's more of an ambient soundscape than a song, and can't decide how I feel about it, but I think it's a good closer nevertheless.

The fact that this song of all songs got a live version in my country nonetheless was one of the more bizarre moments of 2019 music wise. The piano on this track simply gorgeous but as has been the case with the Dedicated songs so far, opinions are far too divided for it so survive longer than this. I do think that the chorus kills some of  the momentum that the pre-chorus sets up but it remains catchy either way.

---
# :flag_fi:

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Won't be surprised if /u/skargardin gives this an 11 just because of the live version. :teeheehee:

# I'm waiting for it, the sound, I want it 

**bespectacIed** (10): One wonders what specifically is that "sound" that Carly wants from his man more than his words ... she's has to be talking about his moans, right? If yes then that's really hot

**fadedblue09** (10): I love that piano riff! I remember being whelmed by the chorus, but the pre-chorus is enough to redeem it for me.

**mudkip1** (10): she fucking snapped here

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the piano in the background really resonates with me for some reason

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the 1975 found dead inside a glass box

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): I actually didn't really appreciate this song until the live performance video where she invented Finland. It goes in pretty hard on the album version, but I really love Carly's more reserved delivery live

**bandnitos** (9): does not deserve the SLANDER it gets

**ImADudeDuh** (9): The 1975 outpeaked

**ManofOranges** (9): Something something the 1975. Although this one isn't gonna win like theirs did so maybe that says something.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): that video where she sings this live by the lake? chef’s kiss

**shesdoingyoga** (9): I love the piano in the intro

**bulforster** (8.7): I love the gentle piano here, it sets this track apart really nicely on such a synth and bop heavy album.

**jexan13** (8.5): If this song were a supernatural creature, it would be a purple ghost. Why? I... can't answer that.

**titi\_2001** (8.2): I like it! The live version is deserving of a 9.

**1998tweety** (8): It's alright, a lot of people gag over this song, and while it is nice, I'm not the biggest fan of it.

**akanewasright** (8): Pretty sweet deep cut.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): definitely mid on the album

**leviswift13** (8): wish the chorus was heavier, but still super strong

**Tolk1en** (8): a bit too repetitive unfortunatelly.

**vayyiqra** (8): Classic CRJ and a real earworm!

**Xerop681** (8): solid.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): i pretend this song is actually about god and how we need more to believe in it but at the same time is hard to disassociate of certain christian beliefs (if you had this kind of background, of course)

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the chorus is lazy but it would have been better scored if it wasn’t for that

**Nickl00** (7): It’s ok, a little too similar to other songs on the album just not as good

**waluigiest** (7): A funky little song. It’s got some fun bits like the wavy piano line and the echoes.

# I give up, indeed

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I really like the concept of the song but it kind of leaves me cold. Carly’s vocals sound a bit like scratch vocals on this track? Actually a lot of her performances on the back half of the album aren’t great.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): Piano is nice but the chorus kills the potential momentum it had for me. The 1975 outsold

**Yatcho** (6): This comes across as generic filler for the most part, she is above the AC radio sound

**twat\_brained** (5.3): I really hate to do this but since the 19goddamn75 have won a rate with this song title I have raised expectations, especially for an artist like Carly's caliber, and this sadly doesn't deliver. Not much else to say than that

**J\_Toe** (5): tbh i prefer uptempo stuff ¯\(ツ)/¯

**Sundraliz** (5): This song is forgettable for me but I love it while I'm listening to it.

So here’s the things about Cross You Out, either you love it and sing along with it at the top of your lungs, or it’s too chaotic and you despise it. There’s no in-between here really. I believe that anyone who has been in a toxic relationship, it doesn’t even necessarily need to be a romantic one, can relate to the lyrics about crossing someone out of their lives. I for one love to go ham on this chorus but it’s understandable that some of yall found this to be grating.

---

# Where's the album gorl

**Awkward\_King** (10): RELEASE THE ALBUM SKY RELEASE IT. when sky goes "i've become someone better (x2)" at the start of the bridge i love it i love it so much

**bulforster** (9.5): Charli is a literal miracle worker for getting music out of Sky. I'm as shook as 2013 tumblr would've been at this collab.

**hefellapart** (9): sky... gorl... where the album at.... im starving like a camel in a desert with no hump

**yourfacesucksass** (8.7): Patiently waiting forever for Sky to release her second album, but we have this. Their voices really contrast each other in a pleasing way. Sky's voice has somehow gotten even better than before??

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Imagine getting two Sky songs in a year...

# UH HUUUH UHHH

**DaHumanTorch** (10): love love love this song, especially sky’s vocals on it

**jexan13** (10): after listening to this like 100 times, i finally love it. The "huhuhuhu" randomly assaults my head everyday. Damn I really love thicc basses

**passionfruits2** (10): ANOTHER SONG I CAN RELATE TO! charlee babee stop that. yes, i have blocked my ex now, thank you for the advice.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this was a grower but i really love this now...those SYNTHS

**Xerop681** (10): this song made me want to get into a bad relationship just so i can kick them out of my life

**sarcasticsobs** (9): feel like this was divisive but this was right up my alley

**vayyiqra** (9): I think Popheads is going to do this song dirty because it isn't as fast or boppy, but I like it. I love synth and I love Sky Ferreira, so this is a no-brainer. Her feature, unlike most of the ones on this album, really elevates the song a lot. It works as a real duet where their voices complement each other.

**1998tweety** (8.5): I like this, the chorus gets a little grating, but besides that, it's a good song.

**wavingwolves** (8.5): this makes me miss sky but i still love it

**titi\_2001** (8.1): It's nice

**bandnitos** (8): kind of slow but u know what we love her

**Nickl00** (8): I wish there was more to the chorus, but this song goes so hard

**notceitn** (8): this grew on me a lot tbh

**thoeoe** (8): Charli continuing to serve the most amazing vocal features

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I love the production in this song

**akanewasright** (7): One of my “most likely to skip” songs, but I still like it a lot.

**anothertown** (7): this song is kind of a slog to get through but Sky’s voice is so welcome to hear!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): this was disappointing considering the combo but not bad when you ignore how good they both usually are

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): This kinda let me down after I was promised 80s synth banger but it’s not a bad song. Just not what I wanted from an XCX/Ferreira collab

**waluigiest** (7): it drags on a bit but it’s worth it for the bridge

# I can finally cross this song out

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): This song is almost there for me, but there are just a few too many #choices for me to really get into it. Sky Ferreira's bridge/verse/whatever is a good example of something that just needed more time in the oven

**kappyko** (6): murky slow jam

**leviswift13** (6): eh

**shesdoingyoga** (6): Repetition usually works for Charli, but the tempo combined with the repetitiveness of the chorus makes it boring

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Too repetitive. Also, Sky outsang Charli here, sorry :/

**ManofOranges** (4): It's just so slow and abrasive, no thanks.

**Tolk1en** (4): so boring and repetitive

**TragicKingdom1** (4): idk why charli stans complain about not getting studio quality versions of leaked demos when her finished songs have just as terrible vocal production

**CarlieScion** (3): i genuinely cannot stand this song

**twat\_brained** (3): let's just face it, this represents where I and many other Angels see the flaws in the album begin to click. Charli is the mistress of electropop, but considering Charli and Sky's history with Ariel Rechtshaid (ffs we literally rated two of their albums under his production) they really should've let him take the reins here, it probably would've saved this song.

**bespectacIed** (1): Y'all have no idea how I felt when I found out two of my fave iconic gay icon british pop girlies collaborated and it turned out to be this bad. It was like an electric shock in the worst way possible. I'm still pissed!!!

**J\_Toe** (1): incredibly uncomfortable to listen to. pls don't do that again

# SCREAM

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): Imagine you see a YouTube video entitled “cross you out by charli xcx/sky ferreira, but you’re in a waiting room in hell.” You click on it. It just links you to the official audio.

The second half of Dedicated might be a bit spotty but this track in my opinion does everything right! Carly captures the feeling of falling headfirst into love with such ease that it reminds me of some of the peaks on Emotion. I never thought that it was going to get very far but I’m glad that it made it past day 1 if nothing else.

---

# It was love.... at first sight

**bespectacIed** (10): My second favorite song in the album and as the title says it's an immediate love for this song, mainly because of the amazing lyrics (like the rest of the album). The chorus in this just flows so flawlessly and feels so pure, my heart's gonna explode from the sweetness of this song

**DaHumanTorch** (10): automatically in love w this song, one of my favs here. i hope y’all don’t do it dirty

**fadedblue09** (10): That ooohhh in the pre-chorus is just heavenly.

**leviswift13** (10): PERFECT CHORUS

**memesus** (10): so under rated, one of her best hooks ever

**mudkip1** (10): she fucking snapped here

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Probably my most listened to song off the album, but every time it comes on the title makes me think of Accidentally in Love which makes me think of Shrek

**titi\_2001** (9.5): I have really fond memories of playing this song on repeat while having a very stressful school life. One of my first faves from the album.

**Agusarg** (9): The chorus on this track is so good and not talked about enough

**racloves** (9): this track is underrated af!

**ReallyCreative** (9): We say yes to Mariah Carey tribute songs in this house

**Sundraliz** (9): I loooove the part where she says "automatically" at the beginning of the chorus and the bass does the damn thing. Literally gives me shivers.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): I'm automatically in love, its that GOOD

**1998tweety** (8.5): There she goes again pull off sexy so well. Carly's breathy vocals on the chorus work so well. Unfortunately, the song is kind of forgettable within the album.

**Arybeck67** (8.5): the chorus is stuck in my head forever send help

**hefellapart** (8): she sounds like she holding back in this song ngl idk why

**ManofOranges** (8): Really like the instrumentals, although the hook is a bit of a let down for me.

**Yatcho** (8): This is extremely smooth and I know it'll be done dirty in this rate

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.7): I like this way better without headphones than with headphones for some reason? Love that smooth chorus.

**anothertown** (7): Counting Crows outsold

**bandnitos** (7): eh

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Stream this instead.

**Nickl00** (7): I’m not really a fan of these slower paced songs but it’s not bad

**sarcasticsobs** (7): all for the chorus

**twat\_brained** (7): cute but unmemorable

**vayyiqra** (7): fun

**Xerop681** (7): solid.

# Automatically resentment

**jexan13** (6.5): Among the worst of Dedicated. Not bad, really, just too safe.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (6.5): I was not automatically in love with this song :(

**waluigiest** (6): on the one hand she really nails the naive sort of love she’s going for. But that also means this is kinda generic compared to her normal work

**wavingwolves** (6): unfortunate automatically in love is not how i feel about this song but it's still good enough

**\_wailordfan** (5.5): this just sounds so muddy and the hook feels like a kiss-era hook, gross.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (5): Okay so I guess I was lying when I said I couldn’t give this album bad scores. This song is so forgettable for me

I was so looking forward to how this song would fare in this rate. I knew that it was going to be controversial and BOY did it turn out to be just that. You can love the outro that’s just ~~monster car woo-hooing~~ a bunch of noise, or hate it. You can love Kim’s braggadocious energy, or you can hate it. I don’t think we’ll ever be able to reach a consensus on this song. And given how controversial this song is, this placement seems like an appropriate place for it in the rate.

---

# Monster car enthusiasts

**racloves** (11): I go so hard to this song every time it comes on. Also love the slayyyter remix

**thoeoe** (11): I love Slayyyter but fuck the No Girls remix (sorry not sorry) production ruins it. This song is fucking it take me to another goddamn dimension Dylan Brady!!

**alwayswords** (10): i always picture tommy cash as johnny cash so i just imagine johnny cash coming in like “IM HARD LIKE SUDOKU--”

**bandnitos** (10): if it was the no boys remix it would be an 11 contender but bc its not its just a high 10 holy shit this goes off

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the random fart noises throughout and the monster truck sex noises at the end of the song...chefs kiss

**hefellapart** (10): idc idc a bop, that ending hurts my ears, but its so good hhhh.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): love to listen to the last 30 seconds on this with headphones on full blast until i have a stroke

**wavingwolves** (10): charli's little whoop whoop. that's all.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): give me a brain massage mommy

**Xerop681** (10): the song i play when i ask my mom for money and she says yes

**megm26** (9.9): I prefer the no boys version much more and that probably would’ve gotten my 11 if it was available, but this is still awesome. Charli and Kim exude such bad bitch energy. Tommy’s verse is ok.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Charli eats, Kim EATS, Tommy....snacks a bit. I like this song a lot, unfortunately, the ear-r*pe at the ends prevents me from giving it a 10.

**akanewasright** (9.5): Ngl, I like the Slayyyter version better. It’s still stellar tho.

**bulforster** (9.5): Not a 10 only because I prefer Slayyyter's verse to Tommy's. I do prefer the more piercing outro on this version to the slightly squelchier remix tho.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): I can't listen to this song while driving because the outro makes me think my car is falling apart

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9.5): The No Boys remix outsold and would be an 11 but this is still an amazing and incredible song. Kim ATE her verse and umru just snaps everywhere, even though Tommy's verse isnt as good as slayyyters verse, its stil good.

**anothertown** (9): Kim used this outro as one of her costume change outros on her most recent tour and it was godly. The peaks and valleys of this song are just……………………..:fat ass chefs kiss:

**cremeebrulee** (9): Took a point off for Tommy's verse :/

**fishingfor8** (9): i'm so 2020... oh wait FUCK GO BACK GO BACK

**hikkaru** (9): the slayyyter remix is a 10, should have been on the album

**J\_Toe** (9): don't really like the very last bit of the song, and tbh I don't like supporting Kim Petras, but the song is a net positive.

**Nickl00** (9): I prefer the slayyyter version but this is such a fun song so go along with and that outro is something else

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): the level of glitch is heavenly, but i prefer the no boys remix so...

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This would get a 10 but the No Boys Remix exists and is better so it doesn't

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): Cute! Don’t love listening to Kim if I can’t help it but at least I can pretend it’s still Charli

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (9): Once I got over the headache / massage at the end, I came to love this futuristic banger. Kim’s verse is great for all the right reasons and Tommy’s is great for all the wrong reasons, but it all comes together as one of my favourites.

**Yatcho** (8.9): Of all the crazy experimental songs this one is the most successful I think. Its super catchy, reminiscent of the big team up songs in Pop2, and that outro is fucking nuts

**Arybeck67** (8.7): when my mom heard this song, after previously praising Charli she said: “Not in my good Christian household”

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I feel like you have to be in the right mood to listen to this song. Today I am in the right mood and I want to pop my pussy and smash things while listening to this. The end is still too much though it hurts my ears so I have to give a slightly lower score for that.

**jexan13** (8): Yeah, Slayyyter's version is way superior, but... yeah, there's no buts. Love the helicopter taking off in the outro. And Kim's verse is likely one of the best things of her entire carreer.

**puberty1** (8): i love you dylan brady

**waluigiest** (8): this is PC music fanservice, for better and for worse. Idk if it’s a hot take but the chorus sucks. Kim eats it up tho and the outro is wonderful

**twat\_brained** (7.9): It's excellent, it's just not the Slayyyter Remix :/

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): it’s good but i still feel Unlock it is the superior kim collab

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.5): slayyyter outsold

**passionfruits2** (7): do i like Kim's verse? no. is that why this song is 7, not 10? yes. say what you will about Tommy Cash, he bodied Kim Petras here.

skargardin: # consumerism? :idkher:

**yourfacesucksass** (6.8): The beginning gives me Marry the Night vibes. I love Kim, but this is not it for me.

**\_wailordfan** (6.5): I find a lot of what Kim does is really uninteresting.

**CritneySpearz** (6.5): saw Tommy Cash open at a concert I went to, one of the worst musical acts live I've heard... oop

**Awkward\_King** (6): this is a basic opinion but i do prefer the slayyyter version. still the outro is so fucking good and kim goes off

**ManofOranges** (6): I like this song and am willing to look past the production until tommy cash's verse and then for me it goes out the window. Tommy Cash's verse just doesn't fit at all in my opinion and then for the outro it sounds like the put a microphone in a factory and then took all of the really loud and grating noises and then put those through a filter and then made it slow motion and it just doesn't give me any reason to actually like it.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): everything about this song is just unlock it but worse. Really. The KP feature, whilst also featuring a foreign rapper whose verse feels really out of place and fucks up the song, a totally different ending to the rest of the track. Except unlike Unlock It, this just didn't... click

**kappyko** (5): tommy cash is the best part

**leviswift13** (5): this is the charli that i cannot vibe with

**rickikardashian** (5): have you seen those "edgy" videos that are some character dancing and when the drop comes, they boost the bass by a 1000 and there's some dumb text saying shit like "my uncle puts his fingers in my ass"? that's what I h ou ol

**titi\_2001** (4.8): Started off well.... then.... something..... happens.... the rapper... the sounds of a robot glitching... uhhhh

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): little known fact: "click" is actually referencing everyone clicking the mute button

**letsallpoo** (3): https://image.ibb.co/n3Hr2p/Dl-Yj-M2-HXg-AACtsk-format-jpg-amp-name-small.jpg

**vayyiqra** (3): This is hard for me to rate. It's catchy and I like the instrumental melody in the verses, but then I hate the chorus and the drop so much with that awful distorted crunchy production, then Kim's verse is alright, then Tommy's verse is fucking unbearable and makes me want to turn it down and even skip it. I also hate the drop near the end and it gives me a headache. Even the parts that I like get annoying because they're so repetitive. Like "blahblahblahblah CLICK, blahblahblahblah CLICK" yeah we get it, things go click. I can see why some fans love it, but it doesn't quite ... click with me.

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): A song that starts off meh, gets a little interesting, and then goes completely off the rails into literal noise. The way y'all dragged Mitski for a little static but put this 4 minute Age of Adz-reject on a pedestal, This is garbage mawmuh

**TiltControls** (2): the last 20 seconds do not do this song any favours

**bespectacIed** (1): Y'all really say with your big chests that this is a great song?? This is so bad, but I guess I'll never know again because that outro destroyed my eardrums.

**fadedblue09** (1): This started out as okay, but that Tommy Cash feature headed it into a downward spiral. Also, I can't stand that chaotic instrumental in the end, it literally made me remove my earphones.

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): Songs like this just make me angry about the hypocrisy of the online pop community. Y’all will complain endlessly about “mumble rap” but then give this a pass when it’s basically the exact same thing? I constantly see “basic” artists being dragged for having simple messages in their songs or “stupid” lyrics, yet this incredibly insipid noise gets praised in Pitchfork because it’s shallowness is presented as edgy and cool (but in a conveniently socially acceptable way). Also literally it sounds like ass, so there’s that too.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): so like…. When does this get good? The fucking ending where it’s just broken audio?????? This is an easy 0

From one highly controversial song to another and this featured list of artists is even more wild than the one that came before. If anyone could pull off a collab like this and make it work, it’s Charli. I fucking love this song and the chaotic energy it brings, every feature gets their own time to shine, CupcakKe has an ASMR moment, Big Freedia’s verse goes off, Brooke Candy’s verse starts off with that iconic screech, I could go on and on to be honest. But as was the case with Click, it was never going to make it past Day 2 due to how controversial it is.

---

# I shake it, I shake it, I shake it ooh..

**\_wailordfan** (11): a hoe anthem is a hoe anthem and damn this is a major step up from I Got It (which is still an 11, but Freedia REALLY popped off)

**jexan13** (11): I can already feel this song is going to be the most controversial of the rate. Gone, Ocean of Tears and Julien were more deserving of my 11... But we all know Gone is winning, so I decided to reward what I think is the most interesting and avant-garde track of 2019. To me, it's more than just a song, it's a damn experience. When the song starts and the subtle "I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ohh" sounds, I get absorbed in the song and then I get to feel every feature verse and the production going absolute bonkers. Just amazing, Periodt.

**Nickl00** (11): Is this the best song in the rate? No. But it’s still getting my 11 because of the fact that a song like this even exists

**akanewasright** (10): This song might go out first. I would understand, but I have (at least) five very good counterarguments for all the people who’ll give it a zero. “I shake it I shake it all on you”, “Got you drinking water when you should be drinking alcohol”, Cupcakke’s whisper, “tell me what you want, tell me what you want daddy, little bit of sugar, little bit of Brooke Candy”, and “Já mostrei que eu sou queen, falo sério pra vocês A coroa é pesada, mas eu me acostumei”.

**anothertown** (10): This is bonkers and the best posse cut ever made

**Awkward\_King** (10): they all obviously killed it but i love every charli/cupcakke/brooke collaboration. they shook it they shook it they shook it ooh. cupcakke's whispering and brooke's scream >>>, omg

**brenda\_official** (10): i dont know what paddle paddle paddle cause this pussy in seattle means but i think that mystery is better left unsolved

**bulforster** (10): Just unbelievably iconic.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is the shit i love

**DaHumanTorch** (10): BROOKE CANDY F*G MOB...anyways this isn’t as good as i got it but it’s still a 10 i go absolutely feral every time this comes on. freedia...her part gets me so hype everytime

**hefellapart** (10): whew, the flavor, incomparable, one of the 11 contenders

**J\_Toe** (10): the first time I listened I was terrified because I'm used to music being pleasing rather than, well, what this is. But this was the first song from the album I got stuck in my head, and quickly came around to its music genius.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): fuck me UP

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Charli is the current queen of the posse cut in pop music right now and I hope she never stops

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): Song of the century, the future of pop. Every feature propels the song to new heights as the production gets wilder and better culminating with Pabllos verse topping it all off

**thoeoe** (10): I SHAKE IT I SHAKE IT I SHAKE IT I SHAKE IT I SHAKE IT I SHAKE IT I SHAKE IT I SHAKE IT I SHAKE IT I SHAKE IT I SHAKE IT I SHAKE IT I SHAKE IT I SHAKE IT.

**waluigiest** (10): Pop 3

**wavingwolves** (10): i love brazilian representation and this song is way too weird of an experience to deserve a score lower than 10

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i luv asmr

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): "And this pussy so juicy, when I cum it's made of Snapple" an iconic line

**fishingfor8** (9.5): water noises

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Not a fan of some of the production choices but it still somehow all works together and makes me wish I knew how to actually dance

**1998tweety** (9): It's interesting and different so I give it points for that, but I'm still not 100% sold on it.

**bandnitos** (9): brooke candy ate everyone up

**CarlieScion** (9): istg if any of you sophie-hating twinks from the charity rate gives this a good score i will throw hands

**hikkaru** (9): the spiritual successor to i got it, it's a big banger BUT I do feel like it's just missing a certain something to make it a smash 10 like its predecessor is

**ManofOranges** (9): I can tell that Charli wanted something fun, something for the summertime, something for girls to, you know, get ready and party to and I for the most part think she does that here although there are parts in the production that are just too out there (surprise, surprise). Unlike with I Got It, which this song is obviously the spiritual successor to, Pabllo Vittar's verse doesn't take me out of the song so that's a plus, but I feel like Big Freedia's presence here doesn't mix that well. Either way, people can definitely get down with the song, that's for sure.

**Sundraliz** (9): nice nice nice nice nice nice nice

**minibjork** (8.5): the absolute mess of it all ; maximalism at its finest

**Arybeck67** (8.3): I’ll shake it any day of the week honey

**twat\_brained** (8.1): knowing what these ladies are saying instead of just hearing gays cheer on drag queens… I dig it! The verses all combine together pretty well.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): Banger but also disjointed. I Got It worked better imo

**Xerop681** (8): not as good as i got it but solid

**Yatcho** (8): What galaxy did this get beamed from? This has to be the most audaciously wacky song from a near mainstream pop singer I've ever heard

**yourfacesucksass** (7.8): I feel like it tried to do something but that something flew right by me.

**kappyko** (7): objectively terrible but bop. also don't forget to correct the capitalization!

**passionfruits2** (7): a bit overrated for sure, but a bop. Big Freedia and CupcakKe are good here, Brooke is OK, but Pabllo Vittar's verse is cringy. beat is good tho.

**racloves** (7): I flip flop between loving and hating this song

**rotating3Dtext** (7): uuh I appreciate it for what it is but not gonna lie, you gotta be in a certain mood to listen to it, also i’d like more charli in it.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (7): Even though this isn’t one of my favourites, I have to acknowledge how ambitious it is. From CupcakKe’s whispering, to Brooke Candy’s weird-ass Southern accent, to the water effects on the vocals, to the fact that 2 drag queens feature, one singing in Portuguese… It’s wild. While I don’t enjoy it nearly as much as I Got It, it’s a testament to Charli’s socialisation skills and ability to bring artists together under a common vision.

skargardin: # I don't shake it like that!! 

**megm26** (6): https://giphy.com/gifs/neil-gaiman-gX4brCsMpvscg

**ImADudeDuh** (5): kinda fun but this fucking production please oh wait Brooke Candy is being annoying again why did they ruin this.

**rickikardashian** (5): i kind of hate this but the big freedia and cupcakke’s verses are too good to give a 0

**Tolk1en** (5): Too long. No consistency at all. This is too much innovation for me. First minute is a 11, the rest is a nightmare :sob:

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): There are some good parts to this song but Big Freedia's verse is the only one that really captures my attention and holds it. The rest of this song desperately needs to be edited, I can only handle so many boops, bloops, and bangs before losing my mind

**letsallpoo** (4): all of these points are for big freedia and for cupcakke's bacon line

**leviswift13** (4): i just don't like this aggressive charli. it feels empty to me

**bespectacIed** (3): Great big freedia guest verse, half-assed verses for the rest. I skip it i skip it i skip it ooh.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): This could have ended after Big Freedia’s verse and it would have been the perfect interlude but nope, it goes on for like three more minutes after that. Despite the number of artists on this song it lacks any kind of substance, it feels like Charli got demos of four different features and just decided to slap them all together with some autotune.

**fadedblue09** (1.5): I'm not a fan of too much features.

**TiltControls** (1): This 1 point is for CupcakKe and CupcakKe only. Everyone else can share the 0 I would have given this otherwise.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): no. Stop with the gurgling toilet noises again

**RandomHypnotica** (0): ugh this is just too fucking much its not music anymore

**titi\_2001** (0): I find it objectively terrible.

**vayyiqra** (0): [WARNING: SEARING HOT TAKE INCOMING] Ugh, I was really dreading this song. I hate this song with a burning passion. It starts okay with the vocoder, then the awful verse by Big Freedia comes in. Him shouting "IT'S A MAHHHHHGRAAINE", fittingly enough, gives me a headache (for which I do not recommend drinking alcohol, by the way, despite what he says). But it gets worse with Brooke's likewise terrible feature and her incredibly annoying voice and cringe lyrics, which ruin every Charli songs she's on ("I Got It" is also a 0 and nigh-unlistenable to me). Pabllo's stupid whispery verse adds nothing and is in a language I can't even understand so whatever. Cupcakke's verse is the least bad, but it's a distillation of everything I hate about what I call nu-Charli (post-2016): loud, abrasive, obnoxious, crammed with too many features, and pretending to be experimental when it's just full of weird clanking sounds. This might be my least favourite Charli song ever, aside from her awful mixtape she made as a teenager. Listening to it is like the I hate it here! meme. This is the least relaxing ASMR video ever, and of course it's the longest song on the album.

I’m surprised that this song made it this far as it’s one of my least favorite songs on the album but good for it! My favorite part has to be outro, I actually think that it’s excellent but everything else is kind of underbaked. But a lot of you seem to relate to this song and bop to it so what do I know about anything really?

---

# oh wow

**bespectacIed** (11): This is a "Sir this is a mcdonald's drive thru" comment but here we go. Dedicated was released in a term when I became close with a really cute guy friend. A term full of late night chats, lunches, coffee, daytime spent meeting to finish schoolwork. Very college boy setting. It felt like it's leading to something, but I didn't put an effort to it because I was at a depressive headspace that time and I didn't wanna enter a relationship again where I don't myself enough yet to love another person. Then a new term started and we've taken different classes by then and we just stayed friends. But of course I still HAD to romanticize his come-from-the-diaphragm laugh when one of my jokes land, the way the middle part of his eyebrows crinkle when I have to explain something difficult to him, the song suggestions he gives me because he knows I listen to music 90% of my time, every coffee meet, every meme sent. Anyways, as someone who meanders senselessly in life, Happy Not Knowing came at a time when I felt something again. It may not be some fairy tale shit, just some over-romanticized drivel produced by my own faggotry, I'll always remember it fondly with every replay of Happy Not Knowing ....... Now, one Big Mac and large fries please.

# storytelling queen

**sarcasticsobs** (10): and just like that we’re back to form, baby

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): I can just feel the emotion alongside her

**titi\_2001** (10): BRILLIANT, SHOWSTOPPING, SPECTACULAR, ONE OF A KIND, NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE, my second choice for an eleven

**ReallyCreative** (9.6): Something about the bass synths on this album are just a step above the rest, and this song is another example. The song might not pack quite as big of a punch as some other anthems on this album, but it's still an amazing song from top to finish.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): I've been sleeping on this song, I don't remember it being so good

**yourfacesucksass** (9.5): The BEST track sorry y'all no argument

**1998tweety** (9): Bop. It's a filler bop but it's still a bop.

**bandnitos** (9): i felt that

**leviswift13** (9): underrated and lovely!!!

**rickikardashian** (9): ngl this is cold af. “if we both like each other enough to be in a relationship, just dont tell me lol im just quirky like that”. i’d be destroyed

**twat\_brained** (9): love this because it reminds me of Ava Max's "Freaking Me Out"

**Arybeck67** (8.8): wow I feel personally attacked by this song Carly you didn’t have to do me like that 🙈

**fadedblue09** (8.7): Used to be my favourite, but now it's kinda worn out. Still love the lyrics though.

**akanewasright** (8.5): I’m 18 and gay, of course I like this song.

**\_wailordfan** (8): Charlie Puth bass line who?

**jexan13** (8): me when someone wants to tell me the chart history of the 3 artist involved in this rate

**waluigiest** (8): I love this song because it’s so evocative of growth, both emotional and musical, from Emotion. It takes the magic of that album but brings in the heavier, more elastic Dedicated synths. It also features a different take on love and crushes: rather than unrequited love, it’s about having potential and ignoring it. Growth!

**wavingwolves** (8): i kept hearing she singing "someone else would sue you better" and thinking what is this about, it's like a hyperbolic metaphor about suing someone because... you want them to be hold accountable about making you like them....? but i was just wrong

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): one of my lower songs on the album, but still a cute girl. we ✈️ sad bopping

**ImADudeDuh** (7): filler

**memesus** (7): amazing chorus but the instrumention is not it :/

**Nickl00** (7): Love the baseline. The chorus is ok

**Sundraliz** (7): This song reminds me of Agnes' "Emotional" which is also a total bop.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): Eh, it’s okay

**vayyiqra** (7): What a bop! This is the fun synthpop Carly that she showed more of on Side B and we need more of it.

**Xerop681** (7): Decent

# truly happy not knowing

**anothertown** (6.5): this was cute until the bridge came in

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This finds a solid groove towards the end but it takes way too long to get there.

**ManofOranges** (5): I would've been happy not listening.

**Awkward\_King** (3): i hate this but apparently not as much as i remember, it's fine

Barely missing out on the top 20 is I’ll Be Your Girl! I think that I might’ve slept on this, even while giving it my score for this rate. For one, it has a really unusual time signature that makes it stand out from the rest of Dedicated,  and this rate overall. Some of my favorite parts of the instrumentation, such as the bass unfortunately gets drowned by every other element that gets added upon but it does bop! The outro did what? That.

---

# I'll Be Your 11

**fadedblue09** (11): And here we have one of my top tracks of 2019! I don't care if this goes out first, it's definitely my favorite by far. That ¾ beat, ska influences, and her personality-filled vocals made the song. It's sad that this is being paid dust by this sub, when in fact it makes the rest of the album sound vanilla. I guess you gays aren't ready for Carly to drop those 80's synths.

**hunnybee12** (11): this is for the greater good

# ska queen

**1998tweety** (10): Please please please don't do this dirty. This is so damn groovy and the outro is amazing too. We love a gay/trans anthem!

**\_wailordfan** (10): ok this went way too hard than it had to.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Instant favorite.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): The most underrated song on this album. It’s a banger

**J\_Toe** (10): legit furious this song did so poorly last time. My 10/10 isn't even inflation, I actually think it's that good!

**leviswift13** (10): this bitch is crazy!!!!!!!

**puberty1** (10): probably the first and only time carly said "sold out" in her life (also this song is fucking great and deserves better)

**ReallyCreative** (10): I've never understood why this song gets so much hate (or more accurately, disinterest) from this sub. It's a genre-bending power anthem and there's something about this song that feels inexplicably queer even though it isn't written from that perspective? Much to think about. Anyway, I love the (tasteful) ska influence throughout, and as with much of this album, I only wish it were longer!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): STANDINGATYOURDOORCALLINGOUTYOURNAMEFOUNDMEINTHEDARKFINDMEHEREAGAINI'VEGOTNOTHINGLEFTLIKEALITTLEPROTEST..BANGINGONYOURDOORCALLINGOUTYOURNAMEFOUNDMEINYOURHEARTFINDMEHEREAGAINI'VEGOTNOTHINGLEFTLIKEALITTLEPROTEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**titi\_2001** (10): Now that I think about it, THIS is the Warm Blood of Dedicated - Perfect, but takes some time to get into

**waluigiest** (10): No Doubt walked so I’ll Be Your Girl could soar.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): invented ska

**Xerop681** (10): omg queen of being

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): the bass on this is sick and that bridge AAAAAH!

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): the pattern or progression or whatever it is of this song i don't fucking know music is so interesting and individually catchy

**akanewasright** (9): This is one of carly’s favorites off the album. She’s not wrong.

**jexan13** (9): the guitar is a nice touch

**Nickl00** (9): Probably my favorite song so far. The baseline is killer

**Tolk1en** (9): The bass part is a masterpiece. Only bemol for me would be the highest notes that are a bit fragile.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): Very different sound for Carly but she does it super well. Stream Let’s Be Friends

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (9): Hidden treasure, one of the best of the deep cuts. Y’all are not letting this be first out like the Dedicated album ranking 😤

**ManofOranges** (8.5): Love love love the instrumentals here but the chorus pales in comparison to them and the bridge. It's the weakest part of the song.

**megm26** (8.2): idk how to describe it this song is just so fast. It's not that it's short or anything but it just feels fast.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.1): It's a stand out track to me but I don't really like it....BUT variety!

**bandnitos** (8): can we please appreciate the 6/8 time

**DaHumanTorch** (8): the verses were my fav part of this

**rickikardashian** (8): idk why everyone says this will be Carly's lowest song:c I enjoy it

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): It's fine

**bespectacIed** (7): Another "skit" from Carly, this time about a crazy infatuated lover, that isn't a fan favorite. It's a very fun listen idc

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Ska came before Reggae

**vayyiqra** (7): Fun and cute but a little too repetitive

# Giiiirl...

**twat\_brained** (6.6): Carly you make me proud to be Canadian but please record in standard time

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): This song just doesn’t quite come together like it should. It’s so… choppy? It feels like a bunch of phrases thrown together, and the backing track doesn’t feel like it really lines up with what she’s singing. I like the idea of the track and I’m glad she pushed herself to do something different but this isn’t quite it. Also her vocals don’t sound great here?

**minibjork** (6): carly rae queen of white ska

**Sundraliz** (5): That amazing bass riff at the beginning is immedietely covered up by everything else!!! :(

**bulforster** (4.8): Y'all are not interesting for trying to convince yourselves this isn't the worst song off Dedicated. That main synth on the chorus is so annoying, it sounds like they put a mosquito's buzzing through a vocoder. There is a much better song buried in here somewhere though.

People have drawn comparisons to everything from Julia Michaels’ Issues to Ava Max’s So Am I in comparison to this track and honestly, I don’t get either of those references. It’s definitely the most radio friendly track on the album that’s supposed to cater to the GP but that’s not necessarily a bad thing! I think that this song has everything that I love about a classic Charli written pop song, a strong hook, simplistic but strong storytelling and she even serves some vocals! I’m glad that it made it this far in the rate.

---

# the best or nothing

**yourfacesucksass** (11): the song + the video ugh perfection

**akanewasright** (10): I’ve cried to this song too many times to not give it a 10.

**Awkward\_King** (10): it's so pretty. idk how music can feel so pretty but it does it's so pretty

**bandnitos** (10): i was obsessed with this song for a bit its so fucking good

**fishingfor8** (10): I have too many emotions to really explain why i like this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): My favorite song on the whole album! I was listening to this, like, on repeat last spring. There’s a very specific tone to this song and Idk what it is (party girl with pathos?) but it’s one that Charli touches on several times in her discography (see also: “So Over You,” “3AM”) and it’s one of her strongest points. The story in this song is so simple but so striking. Charli is also pretty underrated as a vocalist, she’s not exactly powerful but when she’s in her wheelhouse on songs like this she can deliver a great performance. I think this is the best use of autotune on the album because we can still hear her real voice, but the vocal effect gives it a glacial edge that matches the tone of the song.

**leviswift13** (10): the charli that i LOVE!!! perfectly written pop song

**Nickl00** (10): Perfect pop balled

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): loved this since the first time i heard it

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This is Charli's way of letting us know who her favorite Blue Lions character is

**titi\_2001** (10): I love it!

**Xerop681** (10): queen of cars ugh

**Yatcho** (10): A real grower, I kind of wrote this off as a simple pseudo-ballad but thats just selling it waaaay too short. You'll never really know youre going through it until youre singing "ALL I KNOW IS I DONT DESERVE YOU" while crying on the floor

**1998tweety** (9.5): Massive bop. Again, another good mix of Charli's style and a mainstream sound.

**laurent1683** (9.5): The most beautiful melodies of this rate are on this song

**Arybeck67** (9.1): Charli cause deep her and I have to acknowledge her sad emotions 🤧

**ManofOranges** (9): A more emotive song from Charli but I actually like this one.

**ReallyCreative** (9): I love the emotion of this song, I have a few gripes here and there with the bridge not being particularly compelling but that's pretty minor, she's a banger ladies

**twat\_brained** (9): me when I set my Mercedes W08 to white on Gran Turismo Sport and I set the AI to Beginner and I start from pole position. Stan Lewis Hamilton because even though he is not white he races a Mercedes and is damn good at it. Only a 9 because the video felt lacklustre to me

**waluigiest** (9): The writing here is excellent. It’s simple, relative to the rest of the album, but so honest and effective.

**rickikardashian** (8.7): im jealous, im overzealous, when im down i get real down, when im high i dont come down

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): i really like this one, though i still can’t forgive her for using a car that wasn’t even a mercedes in the music video

**bulforster** (8.3): It's good but its similarities to 500 Miles and Viva la vida are a bit distracting.

**cremeebrulee** (8): Official is the better ballad on this album but this one is pretty good

**hefellapart** (8): i felt like this song is too safe ngl, but its still a good bop. one of the songs from that album that i think the general public would enjoy

**Sundraliz** (8): I played this one off on my first Charli listen but while doing the rate it actually stood out. Really nice.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (7.6): I like the song. But the more I listen to it, the more the chorus… annoys me? Like it’s painful somehow.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): oh this is good.

**anothertown** (7): It's cute, but weirdly none of the melody feels original. I can barely listen to this because every 5 seconds I'm like "what does this remind me of."

**passionfruits2** (7): from the same producers of White Ferrari by Frank Ocean and White Mustang by Lana Del Rey.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): Not bad but also, Charli’s already had her local era and it was better than this

**vayyiqra** (7): This was an odd choice for a single because it's so unmemorable. It's a perfectly fine song, but it's just kind of boring and has no impact. It's very fillerish I think, so I see why Popheads didn't like it when it came out.

**wavingwolves** (7): something about the chorus makes it sound a little too corny for my tastes but i can still appreciate a more vulnerable moment like this

**worlds-okayest666** (7): this is a cute bop i guess but it absolutely lacks personality and feels like anybody could have sung it...thats not a good thing

# so many problems

**TinosCallingMeOver** (6.5): Cute song but feels a bit ‘four chords’

**bespectacIed** (6): No Angel sad version

**fadedblue09** (6): Cute ballad, but kinda generic and middling. Also, are white Mercedes really that special?

**jexan13** (5.5): oh noes, Rare started playing while... wait no, this bland forgettable track is actually from Charli

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): I don't remember this, and apparently it's been a single? Pass.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.2): more like a toyota camry

**notceitn** (4): literally the worst song on the album... I'll fight

Ugh now this is pop perfection! I remember the exact time and place I was when I heard this song and it was such a blessed moment, summer was just about to begin and everything was just as perfect as it could be. Carly does romanticized love so well and this track is among peak Carly. The buildup into the chorus and the bridge is everything and it doesn’t let go until the song finishes. One of my favorite songs of 2019 for sure.

---

# Real, real, real LOVE 

**static\_int\_husp** (11): There are so many songs on this album that are extra relatable but this one hits me the deepest. It's so earnest, and longing, and yearning. We all want it, but only Carly has perfectly captured that desperate, hopelessly romantic feeling of just wanting something real and honest.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (11): I cried the first time I heard this song. It was the exact song I needed for the exact moment in my life I was in.

**bespectacIed** (10): For some reason I was initially lukewarm to this song, but hearing it live is so fucking unreal. Screaming "ALL I WANT IS REAL REAL LOVE" at the top of my lungs, maybe letting out some tears a lil bit, and laying it all out on the floor was a religious experience, and was absolutely the best part of the Dedicated tour. If I could only have one Carly song that I could listen again live, THIS IS IT.

**bulforster** (10): Using trumpets as her voice is her challenge to Charli turning hers to water on Shake It and Caroline singing the guitar solo on So Hot.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the chorus leading into that instrumental is EUPHORIC

**CritneySpearz** (10): hearing this song live was the best experience of my life omg

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the trumpets in this :bald:

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Soul-crushing dancefloor-stomping banger, what more could you ask for?

**hikkaru** (10): great album closer (before the "deluxe" tracks)

**jexan13** (10): REAL REAL REAL LOOOVE HORNS BLASTS AND MY WIG DISSAPEARS AT LAST

**leviswift13** (10): so close to my 11, sums up everything great about carly's really specific brand of romanticism

**mudkip1** (10): she fucking snapped here

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this song is so incredible and magical and truthful i just love it. It really feels like a summary of what everyone who has every listened to CRJ wants

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Perfection

**Tedyonce** (10): By FAR the best song on "Dedicated", it sounds like a classic and y'all are too cowardly to admit it

**Tolk1en** (10): a strong 11 contender. I scream it in my head for a long time even after the song ends. REAL REAL LOVE. An anthem

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): Ahhhhh that horn synth gives me RAWM vibes and I just cannot get over this song. Almost got my 11

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this sounds like a i love it when you sleep-era The 1975 song and i love it

**Xerop681** (10): dis the song i play looking at my taco bell

**minibjork** (9.2): idk what is about this song but its one of those "dancing-with-tears-in-my-eyes” songs for me

**yourfacesucksass** (9.2): Such a surprise to me, my first listen and I kind of love it??

**1998tweety** (9): So cute, I want real love.

**akanewasright** (9): The immediate fan favorite, and... did they lie?

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9): I have Real Love for this song and how much this build up to the chorus hypes me up every time I hear it.

**twat\_brained** (9): ended Jess Glynne. Well, Jess ended herself by ghosting Isle of Wight but this is Carly stomping on her grave.

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): This song has grown on me but I still think it is overshadowed by some of the superior tracks on this album. As an album closer though? A pretty great choice.

**Yatcho** (8.5): This almost hits the euphoric highs of her very best songs like RAWM, just takes a little long to get there and doesnt quite reach those highs

**Arybeck67** (8): 😭

**hunnybee12** (8): corny but cute

**titi\_2001** (8): I like it! I used to think it's mediocre, but then it grew on me!

**waluigiest** (8): This is carly’s Norman Fucking Rockwell! moment.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (7.5): Doesn’t reach the beauty of Favourite Colour but still a great closer

**bandnitos** (7): you know those songs that only work as an album opener/closer? this is one of them but on the deluxe it really falls flat

**ManofOranges** (7): There is a part of me that does like this song but I find it a little underwhelming compared to others on the album.

**vayyiqra** (7): Fun but the 80s LARP is getting a bit tired and I am surprised to hear myself say that.

# Love is dead 

**fadedblue09** (6): Girl, putting horns on a song isn't a guarantee that it will be good.

**Nickl00** (6): Sounds like it could be off Marinas last album

**wavingwolves** (5): this is cute, i like the lyrics, but if real love is like what i feel listening to this then it's extremely underwhelming and a little annoying

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): so it’s filler then

Given how much of the criticism towards this track seems to be that the features are tacked on and how short it is, I’m stunned that it made it this far. The production is what has me coming back to this track to be quite honest, the chorus slaps so incredibly hard. I hardly even recognize that Clairo is on this track since all she does are some sort of echoes are adlibs, I’m not sure what to define them as. And what really happened on Grammy night? Charli I NEED to know.

---

# I feel like crying

**akanewasright** (10): I have cried to these two minutes before.

**bandnitos** (10): clairo should've had an actual verse but this still goes off

**bespectacIed** (10): Ahhhhh the album ended with a reminder of lost potential. If the album went with the direction of February 2017 --- unique, emotional, lushly produced, forward-thinking but still accessible and nostalgic--- this album would have been a classic. The y2k beat/riff/whatever is so beautiful. The last chorus is an explosion of emotions. This is pop perfection, this is heart-wrenchingly good, this is everything I wanted from Charli, this is fucking POP 3.

**JunkyGS** (10): I wish the song was longer and had the chorus + beat break come in again; but besides those faults I absolutely love it.

**mudkip1** (10): did yall know yaeji's vocals are in the production? was so shook when i found this out. really elevates the song for me

**passionfruits2** (10): it's definitely a grower. the Grammy night that Charli is describing was a crazy one, for sure. so crazy she has to apologize for vomiting in an A-list celebrity after getting too drunk. but that's just Charli. Charlee babee.

**twat\_brained** (10): I really wish this was the last song on the album instead of 2099. It would've made the send off sound SO much more rewarding

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i didnt even realize clairo was on this the first few times i listened to it

**Xerop681** (10): absolutely beautiful song wish Clairo had more lines but still bops

**bulforster** (9.8): I'm actually really impressed by how Clairo and Yaeji are incorporated into a song that seems to be about such a specific, personal subject. Clairo trading lines with Charli in the first verse, Yaeji's Korean and both of their vocals mixed into the background in the middle sections give a disorienting and dissociative feeling that matches really well with the lyrics.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): man grammy night must've been fucked up huh

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9.3): A heavenly and gorgeous song, if this was longer, it would be an easy 11 and although it is short, it is still much very good

**rotating3Dtext** (9.2): it’s so short but so effective??

**Awkward\_King** (9): i always skipped this song but i really love it the more i listen now, her features were so well selected too, it builds like without you noticing (or im just dumb and unobservant maybe that) and so it's so impactful in the climax when it hits

**J\_Toe** (9): love the little beepy melody throughout this

**limpyjr** (9): This song is short, but it doesn’t feel incomplete. Clairo is under-used, but bounces off of Charli well. Amazing pre-chorus and when the chorus hits, it HITS. Yaeji’s outro is absolutely beautiful. The first time I heard it, I had no idea what she was saying, but I felt everything she wanted me to feel.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): If this song was about two minutes longer and actually sounded like Clairo sang on it, it would be a top tier Charli song

**vayyiqra** (9): This is another cute song and also I love the part with Yaeji at the end. An unexpected album highlight.

**waluigiest** (9): So clean honestly. The Charli/Clairo duet is gorgeous, and I really like the chorus.

**Yatcho** (9): One of the biggest crimes of 2019 was not giving this song a second verse and chorus

**Arybeck67** (8.6): I love Clairo and that is all

**minibjork** (8.6): yaeji sounds like someone trying to lull you to sleep before they murder u. love her 'what we drew' coming out 4/02 !

**1998tweety** (8.5): Clairo is useless on this but it's nice. It's weird but nice.

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): i don’t think clairo added anything but i love it anyways so...also idk why but i HATED yaeji’s part for the longest time but i finally got taste and now it’s my fav part of the song, we love character development

**jexan13** (8.5): clown little me actually searched for what happened in those Grammys

**puberty1** (8.5): the song is great but clairo deserved a better feature

**megm26** (8.1): I just wanna address something: I’ve seen people say they can’t tell Charli and Clairo apart and ????? Charli has a strong English accent and Clairo’s voice is much softer but okay

**Nickl00** (8): A little short but still a bop

**rickikardashian** (8): this reminded me of grime’s art angels era, so i enjoy it

**Sundraliz** (8): love me some Yaeji.

**wavingwolves** (8): what happened on grammy night anyway

**thoeoe** (7.5): vocal effects are really fun

**fadedblue09** (7.4): Hmm....not bad, but I kinda wished there was more to this. It felt like it ended all of a sudden. The Korean spoken word thing was cute though.

**leviswift13** (7): didn't gel for me as well as some other ones

**Tedyonce** (7): yaeji is really gonna make me learn korean isnt she

**TinosCallingMeOver** (7): The features feel under-utilised in this one

**umadie** (7): least favorite of the album but the production is lovely.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (7): Too short :( It would get a higher ranking if it wasn’t so interlude-y.

# I feel like crying for the wrong reasons

**ManofOranges** (6): Cute but forgettable

**ReallyCreative** (6): I really want to like this song, but it just doesn't hold up for me. The "chorus" is great but I'm left wanting more, the song barely has time to breathe. Yaeji's closing verse is beautiful... but bizarrely placed. Why is it here? This song can't decide if it wants to be a cute interlude or a fully-fledged concept and it kinda manages to do both poorly for me

**titi\_2001** (5.6): Charli's part was good, but the featured artists..... ugh.

**hefellapart** (5): this song is okay, but taking points off because yaeji's part felt like it was tacked on

**shesdoingyoga** (4): It's too short and the Yaeji feature feels tacked onto the end in a way that doesn't work for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): this is just noooooooiiiiiiiisssssseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

I’LL PULL YOU CLOSE, SO CLOSE, SO CLOSE!! Sometimes the remedy to a broken heart is just to go out with your girls and have a wild night and this song is the perfect hype anthem for that occasion. I rarely see this song getting discussed but I’m glad that it wasn’t underrated, it’s a major bop. Charli is that type of friend who you just couldn’t resist go out partying with and this song proves it.

---

**Xerop681** (11): all i can say is she SNAPPED!

**bespectacIed** (10): One of my four 10s in this album and was my immediate favorite after finishing the album (but right now it's tied with next level charli). I have such an emotional connection to this song, it's so fucking beautiful and poignant and AG Cook's production is perfection. I know it's not one of the fan favorites on the album bc y'all tasteless, but this one is special to me.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): easily my favorite of the solo songs

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Christianity never looked so good.

**fadedblue09** (10): Instrumental gets grating at some parts, but overall the track is good enough to redeem it from those weak spots.

**ManofOranges** (10): This is probably the best non-single in this album. This song is that bitch.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): The superior song on this album with the word "Cross" in the title

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): Oh here’s an 11 in any other rate

**wavingwolves** (9.5): a fucking blast of a song. the last minute of it is an experience.

**bandnitos** (9): it's like warm, it needs to be played on certain occasions. again, this is the situation

**bulforster** (9): A certified banger but it doesn't emotionally connect quite as much as most of the other songs on the album for me.

**passionfruits2** (9): just good. great actually.

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Underrated BOP

**thoeoe** (9): Best track after my trifecta of Gone/Click/Shake It but it's very close

**twat\_brained** (9): The problem is I think the album's about to get good again but then I see what follows this

**waluigiest** (9): Is this the best chorus on the album? The shift in the middle where the drums come in and she repeats it but with more ferocity? That’s fuckin dope.

**Yatcho** (9): Major banger alert. I hope this isnt done dirty in this rate, I think people sleep heavy on this song

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): Another one of my favorites from this album, the production is chaotic but driving.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this is so stressfully overwhelming and chaotic in the perfect charli way. i don't think that means anything but it makes sense for sure

**jexan13** (8.5): the beat is sexy

**yourfacesucksass** (8.2): I feel like I should be on one of those arcade racing simulators listening to this

**1998tweety** (8): Filler bop, but a bop nonetheless.

**hefellapart** (8): im mean,,, shes there. she's cute, but not gorgeous (2)

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8): Underrated bop that I slept on for a while myself then it hit me like a truck one day

**vayyiqra** (8): This song is a bop and how did I not see it until now? It's so underrated.

**anothertown** (7): This needs a feature

**Arybeck67** (7): idk her

**Nickl00** (7): It’s okay. The chorus is the best part but sounds a little disjointed at times

**leviswift13** (6): alexa play i forgot that you existed by taylor swift

**titi\_2001** (6): It's decent.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Some of the background noises in this song are nice and I wish that they were better developed.

Party For One was Dedicated’s lead single and it’s safe to say that it was met with mixed reception but it was arguably the up until then biggest cultural moment in the subreddit’s herstory. Just look at the initial [megathread for its release](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/9t2uue/carly_rae_jepsen_party_for_one/?sort=top). And the song has still got its fair share of both lovers and haters. I thought it was a great lead single, nothing too spectacular or out there but it does what it sets out to do. And as an album closer it’s just fantastic. A self love anthem being the closer on an album filled with songs about navigating the mazes of love? Her mind.

---

# Gonna love myself, no I don't need anybody else

**Tolk1en** (11): Invented self love. This is perfect pop. The beat is absolutely amazing. CRJ is a wonder we must protect at all cost.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is cute af and slaps fuck all y'all

**bandnitos** (10): the best album closer in this rate

**fadedblue09** (10): Will never understand why popheads hated this track. This is the best single after Julien, and it's like a mature version of a Kiss track.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Fuck y’all, this was a good lead single.

**J\_Toe** (10): I was never underwhelmed by this like most of r/popheads. I sing it to myself any time I'm alone and lonely, tbh. Not for the innuendo, but because the hook is just that happy and danceable. So happy Mark Kanemura made it in the video.

**laurent1683** (10): Always wondered why people weren't extremely hyped for this single, in my mind it's a top 3 song on the album

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): A great comeback single after the iconic Emotion era, opening the new Dedicated era, and closing the album. The song closes off the album well with embracing ones self and being content with yourself, which almost completes the arc in this album.

**twat\_brained** (10): bop bop bop best song on the album top 10 all-time Carly song

**vayyiqra** (10): A self-love anthem! In more ways than one But really it's very wholesome and positive and I wish more music were like that.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): a classique

**titi\_2001** (9.7): I love it! One of my faves!

**\_wailordfan** (9): I actually think this was a great first single choice and the mv was cute as fuck.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): she said "i can slam my own clam"

**hefellapart** (9): a great single, made me excited for dedicated

**hikkaru** (9): it was disappointing upon release but she's grown on me

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): queen of masturbation

**wavingwolves** (9): people are way too harsh with this song. it's fun, it's cute, it's chatchy and it works incredibly well. i do agree it doesn't really go well with the rest of the album, but since it's just a bonus track, i don't really mind its presence.

**Xerop681** (9): masturbation anthem

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): Oh Party for One, you get so much hate in this sub, but you're a bop! Probably not the best choice for a lead single, but an appropriate enough bonus track.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (8.6): I know y’all are gonna rate this one too low judging from the sub’s reaction to this in the past. But seeing this song posted on here in 2018 was what prompted me to check out Carly Rae as someone other than the Call Me Maybe girl. All 3 of these albums have their mainstream songs and all 3 worked on me 🤷🏼‍♂️

**1998tweety** (8.5): It's a bop. I can't believe y'all almost bullied Carly to keep this off her album, it's GOOD.

**jexan13** (8.5): This song is way better NDLM and NTIFY and you bullied poor Carly to almost scrap it. I mean, if I were God I would use /r/popheads as the location for the sequel to Sodoma and Gomorra.

**minibjork** (8.5): march madness: dancing with myself v. party for one

**rickikardashian** (8.5): Carly released this as a single so we could have time to actually like it otherwise this would get dragged too badly

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Quarantine anthem

**Arybeck67** (8.2): kinda disappointing honestly don’t @ me

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): The most misleading lead single since 2 Hearts mayhaps? I don't actually know, I stan fewer artists than I have functional brain cells.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I feel like if this wasn’t the lead single everyone would have loved it a lot more.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): there's nothing WRONG with party for one, but there isn't anything great about it either

**waluigiest** (8): The coda of the album. I don’t really think of it as part of Dedicated, which is maybe why I’m rating it high-ish.

**ManofOranges** (7.5): I'm not delusional so I must admit that this song isn't THAT great. I do remember listening to it the day it came out and thinking "wow this is amazing" but that was simply because, much like everyone else, I was starved for literally anything. Looking back, or even looking at this very album, there's better. Also I feel like this song doesn't really fit the album like it was literally tacked on at the end.

**anothertown** (7): Shawn Wasabi tweeted something implying he did uncredited production work on this song and I believe it

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): It’s fine but I’m not bothered that this one’s not on the vinyl version

**Yatcho** (7): The initial reception to this song was a little unfair, its VERY average but not terrible. Disappointing as a comeback song yes, but not offensive or anything

**puberty1** (6.5): it's fine, idk if it was the right choice for a lead single

# back on the mediocrity

**bespectacIed** (6): A limp end to an entertaining album. Had to pretend to love this for months to maintain the lead single hype, but this is a cute doozy tune. It has the worst lyrics in an album I've always regarded as really well-written.

**DaHumanTorch** (6): ￼initially ￼was worried about her album when this came out as i didn’t love this song that much when it come out but it’s def grown a bit since then

**fishingfor8** (6): I'm sorry but this album was so meh too me. Charli's album wins any day

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): It’s not an awful song, it’s cute and I don’t hate it, but some people try to make it out to be something more than that and it’s really not that deep.

**leviswift13** (6): shouldn't have been the first thing we heard, but not b a d

**Nickl00** (6): I really liked the beginning of this album but it just got so bland at the end and this is the worst example

**rotating3Dtext** (6): I… wanted to love carly’s first single for her new album but when I heard the first notes I thought it was trying to be call me maybe 2.0 and then it wasn’t but it wasn’t as catchy as I was hoping and I don’t hate the song but I wish it wasn’t tacked onto the end of the album like an afterthought.

**akanewasright** (5): I would probably like this more if it wasn’t supposed to be the lead single.

**thoeoe** (5): It's a good song but it loses so many points for not actually fitting the production of the album
