I Don’t Wanna Know is the first song out and honestly, I'm kind of surprised even having watched the results roll in. I had no idea that it was this disliked. This was not what I at first would have expected to be first out at all but it makes sense in some sort of way, I suppose. Especially among the many bangers on Charli this song sticks out like a sore thumb and on top of that there's not really that much going on at all. 

---

# crying on the bathroom floor

**Tedyonce** (10): god this is so sad - exactly how i like my music

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): If this is eliminated first day I’ll throw hands, ITS SO GOOD

**jexan13** (9.5): finally the weak part of the album is dead. I really like this song.

**yourfacesucksass** (9.4): I think this song is at a good position on the tracklist. It's still very new Charli, yet it's a little more restrained and calm and a good palette cleanser / break from the chaotic (in a good way) aspect of this album

**wavingwolves** (9): the instrumental is way too good and i just feel like the more vulnerable moments of the album are the solos so it's really hard to dislike much about it

**akanewasright** (8.5): This took a while to grow on me, but it has grown on me. I also hope we eventually get all of the tracks on the “album in a day” project.

**hefellapart** (8.5): a good song to listen to when youre a sad gay (2)

**bandnitos** (8): it's either boring or completely heart wrenching those are the only two options

**fadedblue09** (8): The best ballad on the album.

**leviswift13** (8): oooooo this one suprised me i yike a lot!

**Nickl00** (8): I think the album needed a slower moment like this, and it delivers

**shesdoingyoga** (8): Another slower song with a repetitive chorus, except this one actually works for me

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): Something about the stillness in this track really gets me

**megm26** (7.6): this is probably the most boring of the solo tracks, it’s not bad but it’s just :/

**twat\_brained** (7.6): I don't wanna hear too many songs like this on XCX4 personally

**Xerop681** (7.5): solid

**rickikardashian** (7.2): this feels like a ballad made by a boyband from the future trying to replicate an early 2000s ballad

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.1): An album track actually worth listening to?????? It’s less likely than you’d think, but still possible.

**1998tweety** (7): The production on this is nice but Charli's vocals kind of kill it sorry.

**Arybeck67** (7): but I do 👀

**vayyiqra** (7): I kind of feel like this is musically just a rehash of "Thoughts" with a hint of Emotion but I am also very fine with that combination

**waluigiest** (7): I thought she said “melanin in the moon” not “melting into the night” lol

# I don't know her

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (6.5): The production goes too far here. Yeah it’s raw, but so are my ears.

**anothertown** (6): This section of the album without features is boring

**DaHumanTorch** (6): not bad but...yawn

**titi\_2001** (5.6): A bit boring.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): maybe maroon 5 outsold cause I actually remember that song still

**ManofOranges** (5): This bored me out of my mind.

**passionfruits2** (4): the weakest song in the album, but that's what you get by having an average song between two of the best songs in the album (Silver Cross & Official), it sticks out.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): so now instead of being actively annoying, it just becomes boring af.

**puberty1** (3): i dont wanna know either

**bespectacIed** (1.5): i don't wanna listen again omg it sounds like a bad prom dance

I've listened to Pang all the way through at least ten times at this point but Insomnia still fails to hold my interest. Ultimately all of this comes down to personal preference but any emotional impact that this song might’ve had on me is completely lost due to the fact that I can’t understand a single word that’s she’s trying to convey. It's still pleasant to listen to so I'm not completely mad at it but yeah, I’m not sad to see this go.

---

# I'm wide awake

**1998tweety** (10): Okay wow this is a massive serve, I was not expecting this at all. Her weird singing style actually works really well here, makes the haunting vibe stronger.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): An actual standout on the album, and in the rate in general. The sheer amount of raw emotion Caroline's vocals manage to evoke on this minimalist song is immeasurable.

**mudkip1** (10): her fucking VOCALS

**shesdoingyoga** (10): My friend was high when he listened to this album for the first time and he told me that during this song he actually thought he was going to die

**Xerop681** (10): CUTE!!!

**jexan13** (9): A terror movie in a musical form

**ReallyCreative** (9): An etheral, weird, but powerful track that reminds me of Halo (the game) so that's a bonus point

**Sundraliz** (9): I'm such a sucker for this stuff.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.4): This could literally be a track off Charli to me

**minibjork** (8.2): incantation for a moon ritual disguised as a innocent new age song

**akanewasright** (8): This a song that I would NEVER listen to out of context, but it’s gorgeous and sets up the end of the album beautifully.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): GORGEOUSSSSSS

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8): An experience, all I can say....an experience

**waluigiest** (8): I love the way she uses her voice. It’s more than just a vessel for words. It’s her medium and she can paint with it.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I love the haunting electropop production on this! It gives it a very spacey vibe. Kinda wished the lyrics were better.

**leviswift13** (7): we vibing

**Nickl00** (7): It’s slow but these ethereal tracks just hit so hard, especially forwards the end

**puberty1** (7): it's pretty but at the same skippable?

**thoeoe** (7): 3spoopy5me

**TinosCallingMeOver** (7): Caroline sounds a bit like an electro Enya on this track

**Tolk1en** (7): hard to give a fair score to this one. Queen of making me fall asleep

**vayyiqra** (7): Kind of a LARP as Björk, but also, same. Also I know you will all do this dirty because it's slow and has no drums but learn to appreciate ambient music you stooges. Ethereal IS a genre

# isleep

**titi\_2001** (6.6): Boring.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (6.5): Incredibly raw and hard to listen to, which is obviously the point. But half the time I have to skip it because of this.

**bandnitos** (6): i feel like im being harsh on this album but i just . i can't

**bulforster** (6): I don't really care for songs that are drone based like this but it does highlight the weight her voice can carry.

**twat\_brained** (6): the angelic singing is great and all but I wish I could understand what she's saying. that and i wish it wasn't putting me to sleep.

**wavingwolves** (6): very somber and haunting but a little bit too empty

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): this song makes me feel very anxious? i think i like it?

**ManofOranges** (5.5): I've been iffy on the production effects they put on Caroline's voice in some of these songs but now I think I realize I just don't like it.

**bbfan132** (5): the bland version of parachute that is more like an enya impersonation than her own song

**CritneySpearz** (4.5): it's a no from me

**Ghost-Quartet** (4.5): Semi a-cappella songs like this CAN work, this one is just boring and insubstantial. I’ll give her some bonus points for trying something different though.

**RandomHypnotica** (4): this really sounds like Caroline made it when she was suffering from Insomnia huh

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (4): Oh never mind

**worlds-okayest666** (4): i appreciate the concept of this but oh my god this is SO BORING

**bespectacIed** (2): I don't get the song and that's okay

**ImADudeDuh** (1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJGeeryk0Eo

**fishingfor8** (0): Caroline is so hit or miss her pitch correct/autotune is incredibly annoying too

Now this was a real controversial one, gaining three elevens and two zeros but ultimately, the elevens were not enough to save this from tanking in the rate. This was dead last for a good while before the elevens and higher scores started rolling in, saving it somewhat. I stand by my opinion from my AOTY writeup that this is a great track. This is literally what it feels like to have your thoughts fly in every direction and the barrage of synths evoke that. I will die on the hill defending thoughts even though most of you seemingly despise it.

---

# Let me hear yall make some NOISE 

**bot0122** (11): this song is so beautiful it deserves a 12

**Tedyonce** (11): She sounds so devastated on this song, its heartbreaking. this narrowly gets the 11 over "I Don't Wanna Know"

**wavingwolves** (11): i really love the voice effects in here and how it kind of sounds like an AI is singing it while being probably the most vulnerable song on the whole record. i feel like the effects try to conceal the vulnerability in a way and it just deepens the significance of the whole thing. it's so so so perfect and my favourite charli song ever, and it's going to hard to top it.

**bulforster** (10): Those towering layers of synths work so well, this is by far my favourite of her autotuned wailing songs. This is so raw that it makes sense but it's crazy how good it is considering she apparently pretty much freestyled it.

**Xerop681** (10): i love to think!

**akanewasright** (9): People forget about this song too much.

**bandnitos** (9): we love the THX intro

**Nickl00** (9): Those jarring synths are absolutely amazing

**notceitn** (9): you hoo hoOooOOOO

**rotating3Dtext** (9): i like to sing along, loudly. it’s packed with emotion, i feel.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): THIS WILL ALSO BE MASSACRED NOOO

**yourfacesucksass** (8.9): This instrumental is so jarring yet it works?? I dislike it yet really like it at the same time?

**hefellapart** (8.5): a good song to listen to when youre a sad gay

**DaHumanTorch** (8): this song is gorgeous. i don’t expect it to do too terribly well in the rate, but i personally love it

**jexan13** (8): the beggining of the weakest part of the album. I mean, this song is not bad, but it's a bit forgettable and harsh

**leviswift13** (8): love the lyrics!

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): this does make me wanna drive round hollywood and cry because im a fuckup, but so do songs like shake it so idk what kinda measure that actually is

**Arybeck67** (7.3): I have no thoughts on “Thoughts” and that’s not a good thing

**hikkaru** (7): I like the production a lot but it feels like it doesn't really go anywhere

**ManofOranges** (7): Not bad by any stretch of the mind, but not that good either

**rickikardashian** (7): The start reminds me to the THX intro

**titi\_2001** (7): It's nice

**vayyiqra** (7): I wish Charli would think about me I like this song and it has a strong hook. It just seems like a vibe. There is something about all the pitch-bending that doesn't fit though.

**Yatcho** (7): Charli, these lyrics... you doing okay girl?

# head full of thoughts

**1998tweety** (6): This is one of the 3 songs that I didn't remember what it sounded like....wtf is with that weird high-pitched noise...

**ignitethephoenix** (6): boring and mediocre

**passionfruits2** (6): worst part about this song? idk i forgot

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): there are parts of this song that are good but wow my head hurts

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): don't have any on this song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): thoughts.

**puberty1** (4): this song on 1.25x speed is tolerable i guess but otherwise no thanks

**shesdoingyoga** (4): The synths in this song make it almost painful to listen to, it isn't a bad song but I just hate listening to it

**TinosCallingMeOver** (4): Clearly I don’t have a lot of thoughts on this one as I forgot this was even on the album

**waluigiest** (4): part of the chorus is good (“did I lose it all? Did I fuck it up?”) and I like the outro. But honestly most of this is directionless noise to me

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Did she fill her mouth with marbles? This accent feels offensive to my ears. This would be good if it was a normal song!

**fadedblue09** (2.5): God the instrumental on this gave me a HUGE headache. But even without it, this song is just meh.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): ugh my scores are gonna be so low for this whole album that im gonna have to make an album comment aren’t I?

**bespectacIed** (1): and prayers

**TragicKingdom1** (0): electropop hell

**twat\_brained** (0): I hate to give a 0 in this rate but I don't hear anything redeeming in this song. I remember hearing Charli performing it live, but I remember dreading hearing it live, mostly because all I could think about was how this song could've been replaced with Out of My Head or Femmebot. Just at least some Pop 2 songs, you know?

This is a cute moment, sets the tone for the album really well but as is usually the fate with interludes / intros etc, it just wasn't enough to get past the bottom tier of the rate. I have always found it hard to rate intros and interludes but this one manages to be an extremely gorgeous intro that piqued my interest and made me excited to listen to the album.

# The gates of heaven

**leviswift13** (10): perfect heavenly ethereal opener !!

**DaHumanTorch** (8): STUNNING intro though i know it’s gonna go out quick since it’s being judged on its own

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This sounds like I’m floating in space

**Arybeck67** (7): not insanely memorable but not and either

**bandnitos** (7): we love ambient synths

**ImADudeDuh** (7): good as far as album openers go

**JunkyGS** (7): Didn't get much from this, but I guess its a pretty intro to the album.

**notceitn** (7): a good intro but like I'm not gonna listen to it outside of the album y'know

**TinosCallingMeOver** (7): A nice dreamy opener, nothing spectacular

**Tolk1en** (7): Quite surprising because it's very slow but that's fine, for a first song of an album

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): I like this as an opener, it’s cute

**waluigiest** (7): simple and short but I LOVE the upper voice in the harmonies wow. I think this song, in title and composition, is why I kind of associate her with Bjork.

#  The gates of hell

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.3): This sounds like the opening credits of a movie but like… that means it needs something playing in front of it. It’s a cute intro track but I kind of feel like it would work better as the outro to a longer track? Sort of like “Mer Girl” by Madonna. Idk.

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): It's there, I guess.

**hunnybee12** (6): pretty but not really necessary?

**letsallpoo** (6): you will never be bjork

**thoeoe** (6): , any longer and I'd be legit bored, seems like an intro to the intro

**vayyiqra** (6): It's pretty, but too short to make much of an impact. This comment was made by "longer pop songs are good" gang.

**wavingwolves** (6): i feel like this is a good opening because it shows both the start and the end of the ongoing themes and narratives of the record itself but doesn't do much beyond that

**titi\_2001** (5): It's a decent intro, but it didn't grab me at all.

**worlds-okayest666** (5): nap time!

**ManofOranges** (4): I guess this is setting the mood so that's nice but I mean there's not much going on here.

**akanewasright** (3): Don’t get me wrong, this intro is gorgeous and sets up the album beautifully. But there’s not enough of it for me to treat it like a proper song. And I don’t want a non-proper song beating any of the out-there songs that I think are amazing, but will divide non-PC fans.

**fishingfor8** (2): yawn

**puberty1** (1): basically an unfinished demo to be honest

**alasyorick** (0): sorry

**bot0122** (0): I don't give zeros usually but I am going to exaggerate my ratings for this whole thing. At least this song is over quickly

Another Charli song that getting cut and this one has me fuming. The synths in this song are just heavenly and the song manages to feel distinctively Charli while also catering to the HAIM sisters which is no small feat. The outro is one of my favorite moments on the album period and I'm bummed to see this go this early in the rate.

---

# My new BFFs

**CritneySpearz** (10): this song definitely got better with each listen

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): OVERHATED. Everything about this is pristine and angelic. The outro elevates me to heaven.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i feel like most people don't like this and i kinda understand why but it's just so musically pleasing to me. it's smooth, groovy, quick, pretty, and charli and haim work so beautifully together

**Xerop681** (9.5): overhated by some people idc idc

**umadie** (9.2): It took me a while to appreciate this song but once I did, it SLAPS the heck out of me

**ReallyCreative** (9): This song gets so much flak but it's one of my favorites off the album, I don't get it. It's very nice and I love the more laid-back production and vibe. I really like the outro too idk I don't get the hate

**Arybeck67** (8.7): tbh forgettable but it gets a point increase cause I adore HAIM with all my heart

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Wow this one's cute, Probably one of the songs where the feature didn't feel unnecessary.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.5): Very appropriate after the finale of click, Charli makes a very chill synth song, especially the ending synths and vocals :comfy:

**fishingfor8** (8): This is just a general observation about the albums but I think the reason Charli's album is getting better scores from me is because i relate more to where Charli is at. pure confusion about every relationship i've ever been in as compared to some magical non existent perfect person

**jexan13** (8): It feels almost as bland as 1999, but this one is at least good.

**leviswift13** (8): goes down a lot better than i thought that it would have, the haim sisters bring their signature warmth

**megm26** (8): I know a lot of people don’t really like it but it’s a nice more lowkey bop.

**memesus** (8): works so much better in the album than as a single

**passionfruits2** (8): Charli could have had Anthony Fantano's first pop 10, if she had omitted this from the tracklist. it's good that she didn't though, because since the release of this track as a promo single in the end of August, this track went from a 1 to an 8. i like the HAIM verses and that's on period.

**thoeoe** (8): Sleeper hit track, I was unimpressed at first but the whole song just sounds so warm (I know I'm hilarious) and inviting.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): This is gonna be massacred isn’t it

**twat\_brained** (8): the reason I can't fall in love with Haim is that their music is just a bit too slow and calm for my liking. But this song definitely befits its title, it makes me feel warm with delight.

**worlds-okayest666** (8): this gives me such whiplash after click but honestly i love it as a little breather after

**rickikardashian** (7.6): why does she say tequila like “tequiluhr”

**1998tweety** (7.5): Boring and forgettable.

**akanewasright** (7.5): Cute

**hefellapart** (7.5): a song that becomes good after the 20th play

**bandnitos** (7): it is only needed on certain occasions so it gets points for those but also rn it is not the occasion

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I appreciate that it’s nicer on the ears but kinda boring

**ImADudeDuh** (7): finally…. Some good fucking food

**laurent1683** (7): Between this and the feature on Hyperion, i don't really wanna check out HAIM 's catalog

**sarcasticsobs** (7): catchy I guess but bonus points for “tequiler”

**shesdoingyoga** (7): It's not bad but it doesn't excite me at all

**waluigiest** (7): I honestly didn’t expect Haim to blend into this very well but their voices are soooo beautiful with the production and alongside Charli. Their verse is really good but I wish there was more of a bridge

**wavingwolves** (7): this is a little disappointing considering i love everyone involved so much but it's not a bad song in any way

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (7): Look it’s not as bad as some of you are going to say, but it’s definitely one of the weakest tracks on the album.

# Electric chair

**anothertown** (6): this just feels like parody of haim

**hunnybee12** (6): ?????

**limpyjr** (6): Not very dynamic, energy-wise. HAIM’s verse is good and the song gets better as it goes on. Good outro, but still probably the worst song on Charli.

**ManofOranges** (6): As much as I dislike when Charli's songs are too insane, this one was too much of the opposite. It felt too tame for Charli, I think.

**vayyiqra** (6): It's pretty but not very memorable. I always forget this song even exists.

**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): after the overwhelming noises of click, this was a nice chance for me to stretch out and take a power nap

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): The ending with the synths and the vocals is actually really pretty but I wish that the song had had normal vocals and a stronger backing up until that point so it felt like a payoff rather than the wheels just falling off the wagon of a trick the song had worn thin.

**bespectacIed** (5): An okay song. Should've added Luke before the title.

**Nickl00** (5): I don’t know what to say about this song other than it’s extremely boring compared to everything else Charli has put out since Vroom Vroom

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.2): lukewarm

**titi\_2001** (4.1): I.... dislike the song. I find the chorus and two thirds of the song irritating

**RandomHypnotica** (4): man this was just boring

**kappyko** (1): sorry this is terrible

I fluctuate between despising and loving this but in the end it feels a bit too scattered for my taste. The country elements at the very beginning are promising but as more and more progressively confusing layers are added I lost interest in the track. I will give her props for going in this experimental direction though.

---

# Let this be the new normal

**anothertown** (11): I am obsessed with this song lol. The way she aspirates the last part of the word “this” during every repetition of “now what is this” is the type of shit that made me fall in love with this album immediately

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this might be an unpopular opinion but this is one of my favorites on Pang. the country-tinged production is so slick and it just absolutely slaps. i like the abrupt ending too, it just works for me.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I love Once in a Lifetime (2019 version)

**leviswift13** (10): a perfectly written song, the structure is so unique and evocative, the lyrics are so visual, her vocals are like a ghost

**rickikardashian** (10): this doesn’t have a chorus, it literally changes key each verse, and the loop isn’t even the same most the song, so someone explain to me why this is so catchy to me

**wavingwolves** (10): this doesn't even have a chorus and it has no rights in being this GOOD

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): I love the little twangs and quirks in the production, though the abrupt ending takes me out of it a little bit

**jexan13** (9): OwO now what is this?

**waluigiest** (9): the intro sound activates my fight or flight and makes me think of cows. Minus that sound, this is a wonderful track. I love the structure and how every verse is unified but still distinct and gets wilder and wow she’s living such a life

**minibjork** (8.5): this song is a grower let me tell you

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): I like how the production changes with each verse

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): A very interesting listen. It's almost like reading a story, a very nice non-traditional song structure. It almost sounds the same through each part of the song, but in a way that's so different than what you hear in pop music today.

**twat\_brained** (8): why do the lyrics read like bad improv

**worlds-okayest666** (8): this would be a 9 if it werent for that abrupt ending

**Xerop681** (8): cute

**Arybeck67** (7.7): a bop but still it’s a bit forgettable

**\_wailordfan** (7.5): we went from yee haw to charlie puth to charli xcx pretty fast here.

**Yatcho** (7.5): The production on this is low key nuts and majorly improves a kind of straightforward song

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (7.3): Not my favourite to listen to but technically amazing. There’s no chorus and each verse has a different style, and yet it sounds like a cohesive song.

**bespectacIed** (7): Whenever I hear yeehaw, i skip. I'm glad i didn't this time, this is a bop

**bulforster** (7): I like it more after learning that it's a timeline of her friendship with Danny but the structure still does wear out its welcome by the end.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Very clunky, although I can sort of see what Caroline was aiming for.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like the production but the rest of the song is meh

**Nickl00** (7): It’s ok. I’m glad it’s as short as it is and doesn’t overstay it’s welcome

**TinosCallingMeOver** (7): Country guitar twangs in indie pop works surprisingly well

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): I see the appeal here but it’s not the best song ever. That said, I can hear the Chairlift in this? Am I insane..?

# hunny what is dis?

**titi\_2001** (6.7): It's nice, a bit generic.

**1998tweety** (6): It's alright, doesn't really go anywhere.

**Sundraliz** (6): p'sghetti western queen.

**laurent1683** (5.5): Does this beat function?

**hefellapart** (5): this song exists

**ManofOranges** (5): My favorite part of this song was the little guitar strum at the beginning.

**vayyiqra** (5): Eh, I want to like this, but it feels like a mishmash of random things. Trop-pop beats, country-ish slide guitar, ~WeIrD PC music robot sounds. It's musically interesting, but I don't like it per se, you know?

**fadedblue09** (4.5): "Now what is this?" indeed.

**bandnitos** (4): i . just don't like this

**fishingfor8** (4): is this country or ringtone pop make up your mind god

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): I was like “this sounds boring and flat” and then I looked it up and YUP, produced by Danny L. Harle. I thought Caroline was better than this musical nonsense.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (2): I'm so sorry Caroline but this is not it

And thus the first Dedicated song gets cut. I’ve actually grown to appreciate this more as the year has went by but this is definitely one of the weaker cuts on the album, the repetitive hook is in my opinion mostly to be blamed and I don’t really think the production makes up for its shortcomings. 

---

# Experimental queen

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): had you told me Carly was gonna release something that channeled both Graceland-era Paul Simon and Medulla-era Bjork i would've asked if you smoked crack, but here we are. super relevant to me personally when it came out, and my fondness for it hasn't waned yet

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): Just brilliant. I’m legit angry this is a bonus track, it’s such a good closer and I didn’t pay $20 for my Urban Outfitters Exclusive Purple Vinyl just to be cheated out of this song >:((

**waluigiest** (10): excellent. This is art pop. It’s so dark and pessimistic and really sticks out from the rest of the album in a tasty way. All of the sounds and the clapping and the firework noises are great. I fell in love with this song when I saw it live. They leaned into the weirdness and fully extended the instrumental break into Carly’s costume change. They just got to feature the band and sample other melodies from Dedicated and it was magical.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.8): i feel like it drags on a tiny bit at the end

**fadedblue09** (9.7): One of the grower tracks on this album. The constant buildup of the instrumental is just heavenly.

**jexan13** (9.5): The closing section of the album is goddamn perfect, for sure.

**anothertown** (9): this deserved to make the standard edition. A Standing on the Sun tea

**Awkward\_King** (9): usually i hate clapping and clicking and those sorts of a capella sounds in songs but i love it here

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): I will never understand the hatred for this.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): I LOVE this as an album closer! too bad party for one exists.

**twat\_brained** (8.6): This made me realize just how much I stan 90s-inspired mid/uptempo songs in E but the chant at the end kinda took me out of it, and it was well on its way to a 10.

**1998tweety** (8): I love love love everything about this song except for that chorus, it just kills the song for me unfortunately. I'm happy she did Cry on tour instead of this for my show.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): doesn’t really stand out on the album but i do love it

**vayyiqra** (8): One of the most musically interesting tracks on the album and an underrated deep cut.

**Xerop681** (8): this song is FOR SURE a bop

**megm26** (7.9): this is a bop but it’s a bit to repetitive for me

**titi\_2001** (7.6): Same case as with Real Love

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (7.6): Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da! Hey! Hey Hey!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I really like the production on this song but the rest of the song falls flat

**bandnitos** (7): kind of boring tbh

**leviswift13** (7): the drums!!

**TinosCallingMeOver** (7): Are the African-esque drums and vocal choruses cultural appropriation or...?

# For sure a flop

**Yatcho** (6.8): This compares unfavorably to Real Love, kind of feels like the song is entirely buildup for a release that never comes

**bulforster** (6.3): This is definitely the most left field track for Carly on here so I'll give it that but I don't know that I really like it per se.

**fishingfor8** (6): "can i hose you?" i know that's not what it says but that's what it sounds like.

**ManofOranges** (6): A little weird but there's nothing wrong with that.

**Nickl00** (6): I have a weird hatred of clapping in songs, and this is one of the better uses, but still annoying

**ReallyCreative** (6): The buildup to nothing remains a massive disappointment, the hook is kinda catchy but I don't really know how this made the cut as a bonus track

**wavingwolves** (5.5): 6am is so early carly pls hold me another time...

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): That “badabadaba” was one of the things I most vividly remembered from the album but then listening to the rest of the song there’s not really much there, is there?

**laurent1683** (5): Is this dancehall? Feels like a bland Wizkid song a little bit

**shesdoingyoga** (5): Feels like it's going to go somewhere but then it goes nowhere, feels especially weak coming right after Real Love

**bespectacIed** (4): Yeah this shouldn't have been in the album, I'm mad it ruined a great album

**Sundraliz** (3): I think this song is boring.

If there's one song on Dedicated that I would define as filler, it's this one. This song has a glaring issue just as For Sure that was cut earlier in that it has a strong hook but every other aspect of the song remains underdeveloped. A cute moment but I wouldn’t have minded this being cut from the tracklist.

---

# Right Words

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh what a bop. That chorus goes off HARD. The bridge into the last chorus oh my Lorde I have been boptized.

**Agusarg** (10): One of her most heartfelt songs, I love everything about it

**jexan13** (10): The best from Dedicated. I mean, the bridge is so overwhelming and bombastic and the last chorus comes and hammers you in the head and ugh. And don't even get me started on the damn falsetto.

**titi\_2001** (10): I doubt words could possibly describe how much I love the last chorus

**bandnitos** (9): ehjovan gave me a new appreciation for this song

**laurent1683** (9): A real grower. I initially found the middle part of the album very boring but I really like this production

**leviswift13** (9): this is giving me pop broadway realness

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): This song is saved by the bridge. The bridge is outstanding, euphoric while the rest of the song is an interesting direction but ultimately not that great.

**hefellapart** (8.5): she sounds like holding back (2)

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (8.2): This was one of my favourites when the album came out but unfortunately I overplayed it. Now it really is the right words at the wrong time 😔

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I like the change of pace of this song

**shesdoingyoga** (8): As someone who has the wrong words all the time, can't relate

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): It’s a nice, chiller song from Carly. The “Warm Blood” of Dedicated I reckon

**twat\_brained** (8): …I don't really get the premise but it sounds pretty cool? I think that's my whole philosophy behind liking Carly. That and she's from my country.

**yourfacesucksass** (7.8): I'm jealous, I'm overzealousss

**wavingwolves** (7.5): nice and smooth, baby

**fadedblue09** (7.2): It's not bad, but it's pretty lacking to be an album highlight.

**Arybeck67** (7): reallllly not the right time

**fishingfor8** (7): strong verses, weak chorus. Most of the songs i am meh about on the album are like that

**vayyiqra** (7): @ me next time carly

**waluigiest** (7): I just feel like this was a great idea with a bland execution. The beats and melodies are weird and almost uncomfortable, but in a tasty way. With more adventurous orchestration or production it could have been excellent.

**worlds-okayest666** (7): i like this song but i feel like something’s holding it back...like the production feels a bit empty compared to the rest of the album

# Wrong Time

**\_wailordfan** (6.5): I didn't look at the writers, but this feels like a Julia Michaels song, especially in the composition of the intro.

**bespectacIed** (6): It sounds like Cry (a song I've always hated, idgaf)

**DaHumanTorch** (6): on an album full of bops this just doesn’t stand out very much￼￼￼￼￼. the final chorus was good though, definitely brought it up a point or two

**ManofOranges** (6): Fine lyrics but meh sound

**Nickl00** (6): Probably the weakest song so far on the

**bulforster** (5.9): The sudden bombast of the chorus compared to the verses doesn't really work because her voice stays just as whispery so it just makes it sound weak. "You always have the right words, but you always say them at the wrong time" is also a pretty lame bridge lyrically.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): like the chorus, but the verses are a bit of a waste of space

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Filler.

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): this and happy not knowing just like, do nothing for me

Is popheads ballads-phobic? Discuss. This almost sounds like a lullaby with the opening notes. Unfortunately that can be taken quite literally for some of y'all and yeah sure, it is incredibly slow but in comparison to some of the other Pang songs that have already been cut this provides a nice contrast with how simple it is. 

---

# Fever dream

**fadedblue09** (10): Very soothing slow-burn jam, and I think her voice really shined here.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i love how serene this is

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Her voice on this song gives me chills

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i've fallen asleep to this song several times, in the best way

**Agusarg** (9): Very strong Kate Bush vibes, it sounds beautiful

**Tolk1en** (9): These background notes are so beautiful. The strings, the bells, are some droplets falling to make my life a dream

**waluigiest** (9): This song shows off all of the wonderful parts of her work. She is a powerful writer and excellent at orchestrating a beautiful, cohesive, bizarre complete piece to accompany the words.

**Arybeck67** (8.9): Caroline Polachek is a genius and the vibes she makes within her art are places I never want to leave

**1998tweety** (8): This sounds kind of filler-y but it's nice.

**bandnitos** (8): ooh pretty

**DaHumanTorch** (8): i expect this to be day 1, but i love it...beautiful and ethereal

**jexan13** (8): a grower

**ReallyCreative** (8): It's nice, but isn't quite as emotionally evocative as the other tracks on this album. It feels a bit fillery.

**Yatcho** (8): The vocal prowess displayed on this one!!!

**ManofOranges** (7.5): Very dreamy and ethereal but it works here.

**twat\_brained** (7.2): right this whole dreamy schtick is starting to lose its charm

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): It’s not up to the snuff of her best but I enjoy this one more than a lot of the other album tracks.

**Nickl00** (7): A little slow but still pleasant

**Sundraliz** (7): Laurie Anderson's influence, stream O Superman.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): I don’t have much to say about this one

**vayyiqra** (7): It's kind of cute, but if I wanted to hear this I'd just listen to Hannah Diamond's album, not Pang.

# fast asleep

**hefellapart** (6.5): "I don't know if I can do this" me while listening to this album gorl i be so sleepy

**notceitn** (6): the production has vespertine energy

**Xerop681** (6): eh

**thoeoe** (5): okay this drags, like a lot, Caroline showing off during the chorus doesn't save the songwriting

**ImADudeDuh** (3.5): sleeping

Now this song is such a vibe but it's not surprising that most of yall were not vibing with it. I get some Björk tingles from this song and I love love LOVE the riff.

---

# Gorgeous mawma

**\_wailordfan** (10): oh wow this is fucking gorgeous. Bjork who?

**anothertown** (10): like who fucking else is doing it like this?!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is like a tim burton soundtrack song except if tim burton films weren't absolute ass. this is what he thinks he's doing.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the backing notes are just idyllic

**sarcasticsobs** (10): top-tier production

**wavingwolves** (10): this feels cinematographic and it's beautiful

**bulforster** (9.2): Love the harpsichord

**1998tweety** (8): This outsold Lana tbh.

**Arybeck67** (8): the production on this track is fucking cool as hell

**jexan13** (8): a bit forgettable if you zone out, but the production kinda goes off

**ManofOranges** (8): The first thing I think of because of the title of this song is that movie "Big Eyes" with Amy Adams, and invoking Amy Adams is not a bad thing at all.

**ReallyCreative** (8): the SimCity 4 soundtrack is litigating as we speak

**shesdoingyoga** (8): It's good but not as good as the rest of the songs in the back half of the album

**thoeoe** (8): She's an amazing vocalist, why

**twat\_brained** (8): Ended Lana

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (7.5): Not my favourite song but it works very well narrative-wise as it provides that tonal shift back to positivity.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): This makes me think of a garden

# Burn it down

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): definitely my least favorite on the album. it just doesn’t really go anywhere interesting and just overall falls a bit flat for me compared to the rest of the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.4): There are moments of this song that I really enjoy but I just don’t think that the melody/hook are as strong as they need to be to carry a song like this.

**hefellapart** (6): gorl i started to fall asleep after listening to this song lemme take a nap

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): This is sorta cute but not something I’d listen to of my own accord

**vayyiqra** (6): The vocal effects on this are really annoying me and keeping me from liking it more, though it has a cool trip-hop beat that sounds very 90s. It sounds like BGM anyway, so no great loss. I forgot this was even a song on the album until now.

**waluigiest** (6): good writing but I really hate the harpsichord thing or whatever it sounds bad and doesn’t blend into the soundscape at all why is it there

**fadedblue09** (5.4): The production is not really my taste and her voice sounds kinda drowned I barely understand her :/

**bandnitos** (5): im not vibing

**ImADudeDuh** (5): I like the sentiment but does she have to practice her yodeling on this song

**Nickl00** (5): Ok I’ll take the I give up production over this, it’s even worse which is weird since the production as a whole is really good

**fishingfor8** (4): the guitars sounds like the beginning to some song that i can't remember

**bespectacIed** (2): Same as insomnia, i don't get this song

But for real this is a major robbery. This is one of the biggest bops on Dedicated, it even pars some of the very  best cuts on Side B, has a great feature, banging production and yet you choose to pay it dust? I’m truly baffled that it’s this early out. I loved it the instant I heard it and I haven't stopped loving it!

---

# Cause it FEEEELS … RIGHT

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Honestly, this is so fucking good and it never gets talked about how good this song is???

**DaHumanTorch** (10): THIS IS MY GO TO FEEL GOOD SONG i love the featured artist to much on the chorus. it’s so good ugh

**hikkaru** (10): underrated!

**leviswift13** (10): PERFECT CHORUS and VERSES!

**ManofOranges** (10): I really like this song. Also, there was like a video of one of the guys from electric guest dancing to this song while shirtless and I won't forget that.

**mudkip1** (10): she fucking snapped here

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): The album really really really picks back up here after the two lackluster tracks before it. Electric Guest fits so well! And is also very attractive!

**waluigiest** (10): This song is wonderful in how it mirrors the cadence of falling in love (quickly) for the first time. All of the nods to slowly extending your time together and making irresponsible choices and giving in to pleasure are well written. And the way she says “you’re my complicated friend” is stunning. A love song for the 21st century.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): It's such a fun song I just wish it was a little longer

**Xerop681** (9.5): bop

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Criminally underrated.

**jexan13** (9): This song production just... feels right. Infectiously happy.

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9): Who knew that adding an extra syllable to ‘com-pa-li-ca-ted’ could be such a genius move?

**Tolk1en** (9): So cute. God I love her sm. Sorry for this useless comment

**twat\_brained** (8.6): the way she sings "no regrets" in the first verse is EXACTLY like Allie X in Girl of the Year. +2 for reminding me Allie X exists.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is groovy af, the chorus is a bit meh but the rest of the song is very good.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i wish carly tried out more features she always does them well, this is such a blissful song

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.5): The only feature on the album and its a good choice cause the two of them go well with each other and his voice is smooth on the chorus

**Nickl00** (8): Best groove on the album by far

**Tedyonce** (8): Sue me this is great

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (8): The bridge/final chorus is the climax of the album, change my mind

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): Never really got the feel for this song, it's pleasant and still good but far from a favorite

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): I don’t really think about this song often?? but it’s not bad per se

**titi\_2001** (7.5): It's catchy, nothing spectacular, but I like it

**Yatcho** (7.5): The feature kind of does nothing for me at all

**fadedblue09** (7): Cute verses, but god, that chorus.

**wavingwolves** (7): a cute bop but there's something a little too generic about it

# Feels… off

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.4): Electric Guest is apparently a band with two people but the singer kinda looks like the cute guy from Lonely Island. Wikipedia says they’re brothers and he wrote stuff for Lonely Island (he has an Emmy for “Dick In A Box” I guess), which makes sense. But he’s apparently 36, which is insane? Anyways as for the actual song, it’s weird. It has all the somatic markers of a good song like a funky bassline, house influences, Carly Rae Jepsen, but then it leaves absolutely no impact? I have no idea what this song sounds like once it ends.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.3): feels okay

**alwayswords** (6): i hate the feature so much im so ashame..

**bandnitos** (6): :/

**bespectacIed** (6): Again, another song that gets hated by stans that is a bop

**vayyiqra** (6): This is going down because Popheads hates men, but the feature really doesn't add much so it's a little justified. The harmonizing is alright, I guess, and it bops. However the album gets a bit samey at this point.

**Sundraliz** (3): in the real world this song is NOT a 3 but in this rate it's stacked up against so much. It's realtive swetie.

**thoeoe** (2): Sorry, but I hate it

I can't believe that Caroline made a song about dragging popheads' rating taste! Jokes aside, while I admit that this track is really well-written the song itself is way too bare-bones for me to fully enjoy. I’m a bit shocked  that this made it past songs such as New Normal and Feels Rights especially but here we are.

**minibjork** (8.5): this sounds like very much like a haim song

**leviswift13** (8): not the best, but also super great

**waluigiest** (8): I love the line about unraveling this song is pretty cool, like girl me too!

**yourfacesucksass** (7.8): I give up as well

**1998tweety** (7.5): This sounds a bit like an Of Monsters And Men song, I like it.

**twat\_brained** (7): I should've done this to Popheads years ago

**vayyiqra** (7): Why are the best songs on this album the ones no one ever talks about?

**fadedblue09** (6.8): Conversely, this one has a disappointing hook while having well-written verses.

**titi\_2001** (6.3): Same as New Normal, repetitive, generic

**bandnitos** (6): yea this isn't for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): this is languid

I have written my piece on this song more times than I care to count. It was one of my most played songs last year, it's so much fun and overflowing with carefree energy. Will it ever not be compared to Track 10? Probably not, but god I wish we lived in a world where Track 10 didn't exist and we could appreciate this song for what it is in its own right.

---

# Much to think about

**bandnitos** (11): HEAR ME OUT... it's a fucking banger. i have spent days crying to this on repeat on MULTIPLE OCCASIONS. you know songs like that? they are stories that people can identify with you know what i mean anybody children were singing this song at graduations at weddings at funerals. we let this song flop. it deserved so much more.

**vayyiqra** (11): This song is going down because it's not "Track 10", but you know what? Fuck it, "Track 10" is overrated. I like it, but I firmly believe its experimental qualities are hyped up only because it was the first piece of experimental pop they heard. Besides, most importantly, this song is not "Track 10". It's a fun, catchy song in its own right, and the only thing I don't like is how Lizzo's verse doesn't add a whole lot and is a little cringe maybe. But otherwise this song is really underappreciated.

**\_wailordfan** (10): I actually think this is really good Charli, a mix of pop and PC style sound, Lizzo's verse works well. BuT ITs nOt trAcK 10 oh shut up gays.

**akanewasright** (10): I don’t give a shit, this is my most streamed song of all time. Track 10 is obviously better, but the bones of the song were always good (which is why deconstructing for that song worked so well), and this version of the song has near universal appeal. Everyone I’ve played this for that likes anything remotely resembling modern pop music LOVES this song. I’d give it my 11 if I wasn’t sure it would be out first.

**cremeebrulee** (10): Once I stopped comparing this to Track 10, then I realized .... what a massive bop this is. Also Lizzo's verse is great idk why she gets flack for it

**hikkaru** (10): this is legitimately my favourite on the album... it's basic yeah but but lizzo ate (as per usual) and it's such a bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): We love the only 10/10 on this album! Also before anyone comes for me for being biased for Lizzo https://www.last.fm/user/ImADudeDuh/library/music/Charli+XCX I’ve liked this song since it was released

**J\_Toe** (10): You can love Blame It On Your Love and still love Track 10. You don't have to hold one over the other. They're both 10/10 i my opinion.

**ReallyCreative** (10): I will lit rally never understand why this song gets so much hate from this sub. It's so fucking good, and on top of that it's LISTENABLE (unlike track 10, which is fascinating don't get me wrong, but not a song you can just... listen to). It's great and I like the energy Lizzo brings even if her verse doesn't feel the most relevant (Stream Juice)

**worlds-okayest666** (10): OVERHATED!!! THIS IS SUCH A BANGER

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): one of my other favourite songs from here

**titi\_2001** (9.5): I really like the song! Pretty perfect!

**Awkward\_King** (9): just as good as track 10, just in a different way

**CarlieScion** (9): track 10 remains superior

**CritneySpearz** (9): the better track 10

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): This song was ahead of its time, because if it were released today, the token Lizzo feature would've propelled it higher up the charts. Otherwise it serves no purpose whatsoever, though the track is still great.

**fadedblue09** (9): I don't get the hate for this. Yeah, it's not the best, but I love how energetic it is and it's far from being the worst. Also, Lizzo's verse is FIRE.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This song gets flack because “Track 10” came out first and is hard to listen to, so people think it’s artsy or something, but weirder does NOT always mean better! I really firmly believe that Charli is at her best when delivering straightforward pop songs with catchy melodies and huge choruses and this is no exception, while it’s not her finest song it’s really fun to listen to and has that almost wistfully carefree (but secretly caring a lot) energy that characterizes her best work. I was a little disappointed by Lizzo’s verse when I first heard it but I’ve grown to like it more with time, it’s economical, has a good flow, and she has some good lines in there.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Another one that doesn't really feel like it fits on the album, stream Juice

**ManofOranges** (8.5): This song is very fun and very enjoyable, but the little drop during the chorus is kinda bad and Lizzo's verse I don't think is that good either.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.4): this song is okay, the video though

**Arybeck67** (8.3): Lizzo queeeeeen

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (8.3): Yes, this song is unnecessary and over-commercial in a world where Track 10 already exists. No, it doesn’t fit into the tracklist. Maybe it isn’t as good as Track 10. But that doesn’t negate the fact it’s a great song, which was my gateway drug into Charli. Y’all are totally gonna vote this out first aren’t you?

**1998tweety** (8): Track 10 outsold, this is alright though. I mean it bops and Lizzo has a little (ironic) moment, but besides that I wouldn't really listen to it over Track 10. It's a good way of turning it into a hit though I'll give her that.

**megm26** (8): I know most of y’all don’t like this since it’s not track 10 but it’s a good song in it’s own right. It’s a fun casual bop.

**Nickl00** (8): Kinda a banger and while I like Track 10 more, there’s an undeniable fun quality to this

**passionfruits2** (8): Charli fan: 'BIOYL is built upon Track 10. Track 10 is very good, BIOYL is ok. thus, I HATE BIOYL IT DESTROYED THE SONG BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS GOOD AAAAAA' chile, it can be worse than Track 10 and still good.

**puberty1** (8): really underrated because of track 10 sadly. it's a really nice fun song but the gays just want the experimental shit

**rickikardashian** (7.8): lizzo pulled the "quoting my biggest hit on a guest feature so people know who I am" move, but used the lyrics to juice, and I like that, because that way I can pretend like that was her smash hit, and life overall feels a lot more balanced like that

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): do I like track 10 more? maybe. but I appreciate BIOYL for the mainstream version it is of that song.

**bulforster** (7.5): She's a cute song. Cute next to Track 10. Track 10 is gonna you know, devour cute.

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): ugh i can already see the comments comparing this to track 10...STOP. this isn’t as good as track 10, yes, but it’s still a cute bop with a decent rap feature and i like it a lot idc idc

**Yatcho** (7.5): Complete downgrade compared to Track 10 yes, but still a fun song

**hefellapart** (7): im sorry, but like, i prefer track 10 :mandown:

**jexan13** (7): I actually liked this a lot when I heard it as a single. But in the album it's not that good. Damn it. Should have been a bit weirder... but it would always live in the shadow of the perfection of Track 10

**RandomHypnotica** (7): this is nice, but it's not as good as Track 10

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7): A bit basic but still slaps

**twat\_brained** (7): This was better as Track 10. Lizzo just makes this feel like a remix where Charli's label just wanted to cash in on streaming credits.

skargardin: # DAE TRACK 10 > BIOYL

**anothertown** (6.5): if she was going to redo track 10 she should have improved upon it?? Lizzo and Charli have no chemistry on this, and maybe that’s what they were going for, but then they should have had ms melissa go in a different direction with her delivery.

**hunnybee12** (6): if track 10 didn't exist it would be higher but it shades in comparison too much

**racloves** (6): I love lizzo but she didn’t rly add much to this track

**Tedyonce** (6): juice

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): She’s cute but she’s no Track 10

**wavingwolves** (6): we all know track 10 is better but this is... aggressively okay. i wish lizzo did something more here.

**Xerop681** (6): i like it a lot but Lizzo doesn't fit the song well

**bespectacIed** (5): Two giant stars: 1) Track 10, arguably the best Charli XCX song, and 2) Lizzo, one of the most talented and charismatic pop stars today, colliding to form a supernova that eventually devolves into a black hole that sucks the life out of everyone. The meh-ness of it is an insult to Track 10, Lizzo's talent, and Charli's integrity. I have not listened to this song more than thrice.

**leviswift13** (5): alexa play track 10 by charli xcx

**thoeoe** (5): Lizzo does nothing for me, I miss Track 10

**waluigiest** (5): Honestly, this song is incredibly underwhelming. It sounds like the best song ever on paper: a 2020 reworking of Track 10 with a Lizzo feature. But it takes Track 10 and strips away all of its mystique and beauty. BIOYL has the most nondescript, radio filler production and beats of the album. It removes all of the interesting parts of Track 10 and basically just sticks the lyrics over a square beat. The Lizzo feature also sounds phoned in, like they wanted to capture her own momentum but didn’t have a reason to. It’s boring and it had so much potential.

**sarcasticsobs** (4): Legitimacy don’t enjoy (Dylan Brady remix = 9/10)

**fishingfor8** (3): the edm drop, the super high love in the chorus, the random male voice at the end of the second chorus, the rap verse from lizzo is kinda boring it all is just annoying and also very generic at the same time. It's basically a CRJ song without the lighthearted energy that make her songs work

**PointlessBibliophage** (3): this would be so, so much higher if i wasn't aware of track 10's existence. with that context, this song becomes a tragedy of an 11-worthy song completely ruined by the inclusion of normal human sounds.

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): track 10 sweetie im so sorry im sorry a dumbass bitch would even record something like this oh my god

The last cut of the day goes to 1999, which would go on to become one of Charli’s biggest hits thanks to the radio friendly hooks and its colourful, nostalgia packed music video. Some of you have argued that this doesn’t belong on Charli and that it’s seemingly too mainstream but I highly disagree. I used to be one of those people that thought that 1999 had no place on the album but if nothing else, it shows off Charli’s abilities to write a killer pop hook and that’s what she delivers with this song. 

---

# 90s kids rise up

**bandnitos** (10): i did more to promote this song than atlantic records its a fucking banger

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Depressed 00s kids club, where you at

**fadedblue09** (10): Omg a song dedicated to my birth year? Maybe I stan. Also, I don't care what the PC music stans say, this is an album highlight for me.

**hikkaru** (10): all y'all pretentious pc music gays are going to tank this and bioyl but they slap... i hate it here

**ignitethephoenix** (10): bop!!

**J\_Toe** (10): doesn't really fit on the album, but it's a good song on its own

**ManofOranges** (10): Yes I wasn't technically born during 1999, so what?

**twat\_brained** (10): I've heard this song live three times. Yes, Troye only sang his verse rather than both his and Charli's verse but idc it was literally the day the video came out and highkey one of the best moments of that concert. (after Kim hitting that f5 in Close Your Eyes of course) Full offense but this should've won the 20gayteen bonus rate, fuck MNEK lives.

**vayyiqra** (10): Unlike most of you, I was born before 1999, and I don't want to go back to it, but I do understand the nostalgia for it. It was a cool time that felt like the future was near, and it would be exciting and full of hope. Hahahaha how wrong that was, but I still like this song and don't care if that's a "basic" take.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this IS a bop and YES idc

**Xerop681** (10): queen of time travel

**Arybeck67** (9.9): hehe see what I and probably at least 10 other people did there 😜

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): I was in kindergarten and you know what bitch yeah it was absolutely better back to nighteen ninety ninety nine

**titi\_2001** (9.5): I really like the song, never understood the hate about it

**leviswift13** (9): the hehe gets me every single time

**shesdoingyoga** (9): It's a bop but feels out of place on the album

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): Charli and Troye snapped taking us to 1999, keeping a retro sound with a bit of her PC sound. The more basic and radio friendly song of the album but its success did push Atlantic for finally letting her release a studio album, so we kinda owe Charli in general to this song. Troye delivers a great verse and they just work well together

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (9): I don’t care if this is mainstream as hell and doesn’t fit the album, it’s a whole-ass bop

**megm26** (8.7): I wasn’t alive in 1999 but this song makes me want to go back

**1998tweety** (8.5): Bop. Troye can destroy my insides. I like this, it gives off those late 90s vibes but also sounds modern.

**JunkyGS** (8.5): This song has grown on me because it is such an undeniable catchy ear worm.

**akanewasright** (8): I like it as a single, but I go back and forth on whether it should have been on the album. I’m not gonna penalize it for that tho.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This song is a lot of fun, but like, I don’t think it’s that good? I get enjoyment from it for the concept and the nostalgia and all that but as a song it’s kinda weak, although I love the chorus. I appreciate that it’s a pop song instead of the sounds of a computer dying though. It really seems to go off live!

**hefellapart** (8): a family friend bop, im thankful that this song went somehow popular

**notceitn** (8): this slaps y'all are just mean

**waluigiest** (8): you’re from the 70s but I’m a 90s bitch

**bulforster** (7.8): The Ready Player One of songs, the chorus still slaps tho.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): when it first came out i was ADDICTED. i got kinda sick of it, still good.

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): this is a cute bop but nothing outstanding. it gets a little annoying after awhile tbh. definitely one of the weaker songs on the album

**wavingwolves** (7.5): the video is way better than the song but it's a cool song about the 90s nostalgia and how it felt simpler because we were so young. it's pretty perfect for our times.

**anothertown** (7): Must be nice to be nostalgic for your childhood!

**rickikardashian** (7): I really don't like songs that are just a list of old things

**sarcasticsobs** (7): Fun but nothing to write home about

**Yatcho** (7): The music video is a serve. The song is cute, but it's really gotten old now after a couple years

# Zoomers rise up

**bespectacIed** (6): Cute video, cute song, nothing offensive. Feel good pop. Still mad about that Waterfalls reference (i just wanna go back, back to 1995)

**jexan13** (6): I know it's cute and all of that, but I feel it's so bland sonically that I just can't really like it.

**Nickl00** (6): Probably my least favorite. It’s fun but a little bland

**\_wailordfan** (5): I dislike this, and at first I thought it was because of Troye, but I don't think so because I love 2099. Turns out I really dislike super pure pop Charli.

**passionfruits2** (5): imagine how tired i am of being a Troye fan. to have albums spaced out three years from one another and have pitiful singles.

**thoeoe** (5): It's a good song but it loses so many points for not actually fitting the production of the album

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (5): Listen I adore Troye and Charli but this song is so boring to me

**fishingfor8** (2): ha ha fuck this song. this is song is the embodiment of "back in my day" but for millennials. 'I just wanna go back to 20, 20, 2019'

**ImADudeDuh** (2): r/lewronggeneration

**cloudbustingmp3** (1.3): i too want to go back to before this song came out

**static\_int\_husp** (0): Charli writes good niche pop bops for herself. Charli writes decent radio pop bops for other people. But somehow, for the life of her, she cannot write a good radio pop song for herself to save her life.

**therokinrolla** (0): i have hated this song ever since writing the parody version of it for the 2018 popheads awards
