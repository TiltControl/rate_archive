chihuahuazero: Prediction: Caroline takes a beating but gets 2-3 songs in the top 10, while ultimately only getting SHYHMF in the top 5. Carly dominates the top 5 but then because of 11 splitting, ‚ÄúGone‚Äù squeaks by to get #1‚Äîbecause apparently that‚Äôs the only single from *Charli* that the raters unequivocally like.

puberty1: ok so yesterday i got totally wrong (thanks Caroline) but let's see if I can a few ones right 

15) Ocean of Tears

14) Look At Me Now

13) Caroline Shut Up

12) Want You In My Room

11) Pang

10) Hit Me Where It Hurts

9) No Drug Like Me

8) Door

7) Official

6) Too Much

5) Julien

4) Next Level Charli

3) Gone (it's the obvious winner so I feel like it won't win)

2) Now That I Found You

1) So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings 

honestly I think everyone from 7 to 1 can win (I thought Official was a dark horse but after Charli's performance yesterday idk about that), but Caroline only getting one song out yesterday was so surprising that it might give her the win. it's like Joe Biden but we actually like her

Pang might‚Äôve survived Day 2 largely unbothered but that can only get you so far. Look At Me Now was released as the last pre-release single from Pang (oddly enough, the song was released on a Monday of all days. Don‚Äôt ask why that‚Äôs been ingrained in my mind.) The scaled back arrangement lets her vocals soar and this song is deeply personal to boot. But there‚Äôs also something incredibly relatable in which she writes a letter to her future self pondering what type of person she might become. The ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt changed, I‚Äôm still the same‚Äù line hits like a truck every single time.

---

**Arybeck67** (11): Perhaps a strange 11 for some, but for me the only choice. When I first heard this song, I just sat on my dorm room bed sobbing. The way she sings the words ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt look at me now‚Äù is just so utterly devastating. It‚Äôs just such a simple confession that says so much in so little words. The way she incredulously sings ‚ÄúHow could I be‚Äù when asked so mindlessly if she‚Äôs ok when it‚Äôs clear she isn‚Äôt. I feel this song to my soul because this song is as true to the experience of real life devastation as it gets. To not give it my 11 would be a rejection of the truth it so expertly displays of a person picking up the pieces of their life while hopelessly trying to understand how it came apart in the first place.

**moooo566** (11): i think i'm going down with the ship on this one

**akanewasright** (10): I have definitely cried to this song before.

**CarlieScion** (10): very close to being my 11. it just sounds so raw and sad : (

**leviswift13** (10): youcantlooOOOOOkatmeeeeeenooooowwwwwihaavenntccchhhangeddimstilltheEEEsaaAAaaaaAme

**RandomHypnotica** (10): beautiful, stunning, gorgeous, bold, wow

**rotating3Dtext** (10): gives me chills

**sarcasticsobs** (10): this song is a literal dreamscape. Insane vocals

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Relatable queen, I also have not been sleeping

**Tedyonce** (10): FALLING FOR A BOY WHO DOESNT PLAY GUITAR

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): the chorus is beautiful

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): Selena Gomez could NEVER command in such a way as to use a first-person pronoun, she could NOT

**Awkward\_King** (9): "falling for a boy who doesn't play guitar" ouch me

**laurent1683** (9): Sounds like a The 1975 song

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9): Dreamy and beautiful with evocative lyrics - ‚Äòwill you be a shipwreck or a star‚Äô

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): This is a really really good album??

**wavingwolves** (9): one of the strongest lyrical moments on the whole album. a mesmerizing song

**yourfacesucksass** (8.8): I was lowkey expecting a Lucky sample because Apple Music says this recalls Britney. I mean I see what they mean now though. One of the better tracks in this.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (8.8): Emotionally vulnerable and depressing, yet somehow soothing and pleasing to listen to. Unfortunately I always think of this fucking thread every time I listen to it lol

**twat\_brained** (8.6): I am looking, Caroline! You're so far ascended from where you were in Chairlift and I'm beyond proud.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Look At Her Now is shaking a bit.

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): ugh i just love her voice so much

**fadedblue09** (8.4): I'm here for this dreamy guitar-driven number.

**Nickl00** (8): This might be one of my favorites from a vocal perspective. She sounds good on almost every track, but she sounds especially good here

**Sundraliz** (8): Her years of experience jumped out on this one.

**thoeoe** (8): Caroline can pull off slow songs better than Charli don't @ me

**worlds-okayest666** (8): look at her now by selena gomez >

**Xerop681** (8): look at her go!!!

**megm26** (7.9): look at me now watch me go mmm-mmm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm

**bandnitos** (7): im kinda just ,. eh

**fishingfor8** (7): this might grow on me but it hasn't yet

**Yatcho** (6.8): Very cute little introspective, self-empowering song. Not generally my favorite genre but its fine

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (6.7): I can see myself really liking this but the vocals hold it back from its full potential, but its not totally bad?

**jexan13** (6.5): among the worst of the rate; gave it a chance and it is not bad, but it feels a bit derailing idk

**titi\_2001** (6.5): When is this album going to shake things up?

**ManofOranges** (6): This one is cute at least, also I think the bridge is nice. The fact that it's only 3 minutes is certainly a good thing.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): wow.... look at her now

**vayyiqra** (6): Is that an ... acoustic guitar? I like when synthpop albums have ballads like this. It adds variety and keeps them from getting too samey.

**waluigiest** (6): The concept is good and I like the writing but it‚Äôs kind of boring honestly

**hikkaru** (4): watch me go mm mm mm mm mm mm

**bespectacIed** (3): There's this quality in Caroline's singing that I don't like that feels like she's literally dragging her voice on the floor, and it's most prevalent in this song

The little album track that could! I‚Äôm shook that it made it this far but it deserves every bit of praise that it‚Äôs gotten. We haven‚Äôt really gotten this type of song from Charli since, well, True Romance honestly. It‚Äôs a refreshing track among Charli‚Äôs tracklist and I need more of this from her. This song is so incredibly cute and relatable, who can‚Äôt relate to the feeling of wanting to make things official with that special someone that you‚Äôve just met?

---

**fishingfor8** (11): if this isn't top 10 i will be sad and i break up with popheads

**passionfruits2** (11): emotional, tearjerker, beautiful. i know for a fact this song won't get that far, but it means so much to me. i have been through something like what this song describes. i have been unofficial, but now i'm good, i'm free. anyone who ever felt like that can relate to this song in a crazy level.

**PointlessBibliophage** (11): a career highlight

**Agusarg** (10): The most beautiful song in her discography. It's amazing

**akanewasright** (10): I think a lot of people don‚Äôt like this song, but it‚Äôs one of my favorites on the album. I think it‚Äôs important to the flow of the album, and it‚Äôs just a very sweet, very honest song about relationships. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Really Like You‚Äù for hoes.

**bandnitos** (10): i want to feel this way about somebody

**bespectacIed** (10): I don't know how to describe the production on the chorus except it sounds like simmering diamonds on a pot of angel tears. It sounds surreal and hypnotic and depressive, with an amazing hook. It's just a really fucking beautiful, sad song. Also the intro sounds EXACTLY like "Day6 - Still" and it gives me that buzz!

**bulforster** (10): That intake of breath before the second verse deserves a Grammy.

**CarlieScion** (10): the cutest song in this whole rate

**cremeebrulee** (10): The first time I heard this song I got SO emotional... It's such an intimate, beautiful song and such a close contender for my 11

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): What plays in my mind whenever I super like someone on Tinder.

**leviswift13** (10): a girlishness i normally don't associate with her?

**minibjork** (10): uuugh im such a sucker for simple wholesome love songs. i love how bare bones and minimal this sounds

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the instrumental on this just sounds so dreamy and lovely ugh it's gorgeous

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): An amazing ballad and one of the few solo songs in the album and for good reason. A vulnerable and emotional confessional of Charli being afraid to open up and make it official. With the production and vibe of a synthpop piano ballad that perfectly encapsulates the mood

**titi\_2001** (10): Excellent!

**waluigiest** (10): The rest of the ballads grew on me, but I loved this one from the start. This is some of her best writing. The second verse (‚Äú‚Ä¶you know the shapes my body makes‚Ä¶‚Äù) is one of the peaks of the album for me.

**Xerop681** (10): sobbing

**umadie** (9.5): beautiful and really never expected a song like this on this album

**Awkward\_King** (9): this song do be kinda cute dough

**hunnybee12** (9): soooo cute

**jexan13** (9): the piano is cute and the hook is nice.

**megm26** (9): if popheads‚Äôs balladphobia gets in the way of this I‚Äôm gonna lose it. It‚Äôs such an adorable and intimate song and I‚Äôd love to see this side of Charli more.

**Nickl00** (9): A littler weaker than white Mercedes, but still great

**ReallyCreative** (9): I could see this song getting robbed for being more lowkey but honestly, it serves as such a great foil for the rest of the album. I would have liked to see this be the album closer actually (particularly because I don't like any of the songs that follow this one)

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This song is cute

**Tolk1en** (9): Beautiful. One of the less innovative song of this album. Maybe that's why it's my favorite.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): Very very cute and gives me the fuzzies when I listen to it with my imaginary boyfriend :))

**wavingwolves** (9): this is incredibly cute and i support it

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.7): I‚Äôve done a lot of complaining about this album but this song is actually beautiful. The usage of synths is brilliant, they work with her voice so well.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (8.5): One of my favourite deep cuts from the album. Gives me Number 1 Angel vibes, which I‚Äôve been listening to a lot recently.

**1998tweety** (8): It's cute

**anothertown** (8): She didn‚Äôt have to say OCD. She could have just not said that

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): Love the lyrics in this one. A beautiful moment of vulnerability in a largely high-energy or high-intensity album.

**twat\_brained** (8): now what I like about this is that it's definitely "stripped back" in some way but Charli makes it sounds endearing, unlike what happened with Thoughts and Cross It Out. I realize it's unfair to expect nothing but 10s from Charli but the standard she has for herself is a skyscraper's head office, so I wanna meet there instead of whatever floor the break room's on.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): it‚Äôs so cute. but i don‚Äôt listen to it often.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Love the dreaminess of this, but it kinda misses the mark. Track's strength lies in its songwriting.

**hefellapart** (7.5): the lyrical content is bomb, but i feel like the whole song sounds f l a t

**Arybeck67** (7): officially forgettable

**DaHumanTorch** (7): i didn‚Äôt love it, but it was cute...i could see it growing more on more listens as i didn‚Äôt have too many plays on this one going into the rate

**ManofOranges** (7): I don't really remember the song that well after listening, but I at least recall liking it.

**thoeoe** (7): It's 1000% cute but I wish it sounded better, it's too sparse.

**vayyiqra** (7): This song is so cute :uwu: That's all I have to say about it.

**hikkaru** (6): cute

The irony of this title and the way that yall definitely did not want her to well, shut up. And with good reason, this is one of the biggest bops on Pang, an absolute slapper that Caroline has described as "having doo-wop influences" and it's not hard to see where she's coming from. Lyrically this is all about shutting your inner demons out and allowing yourself to submit to love. Maybe she could take some advice from miss Carly on how to just let yourself fall in love?

---

**umadie** (11): Completely haunting song about connection and how we process those feelings. Feels like a complete idea and story. Production is everything. Love love love it.

**Awkward\_King** (10): i wish my name was caroline just because of how iconic that'd be with this song

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): What GLaDOS said at the end of Portal 2

**jexan13** (10): ugh her mind

**leviswift13** (10): what a perfect pop song!!

**Nickl00** (10): Hands down the best melody on the album and maybe in this rate

**rickikardashian** (10): my kink: the way Caroline says her own name

**shesdoingyoga** (10): If Caroline says shut up but Lorde says let em talk, which do you do?

**thoeoe** (10): Yes. yes. yes wow oh my god.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (10): Iconic, just iconic. Absolute catharsis in a song. The part in the final chorus when Caroline sings a slightly different melody is just chef‚Äôs kiss

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): caroline keep going

**1998tweety** (9.5): Me while listening to the first half of this album. This is a massive bop though

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): I want this to hit a little harder, but I love so much about it that I don't mind

**bespectacIed** (9): Hilarious, iconic song. The kind of nerve someone needs to have to make a song like this is astounding.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): bop, especially love the nananana part (and i usually hate it when artist do that on songs too)

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): FINALLY this is the kind of song I‚Äôve been waiting for this whole album. She nails the blend of forward thinking pop with her classical sensibility, and applies her signature campy-but-relatable lyrics and it‚Äôs just a slam dunk of a song.

**ManofOranges** (9): The title makes me laugh but not too much because me too

**racloves** (9): underrated track on this album imo

**Sundraliz** (9): I love everything that's going on in this song.

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8.5): We stan relatable chorus lyrics

**Yatcho** (8.5): Iconic title

**titi\_2001** (8.2): A very nice song!

**notceitn** (8): iconic!

**waluigiest** (8): Wonderful and romantic. She took a good concept and ran with it.

**\_wailordfan** (7): As I listen to this album I pick up on weird small influences, and this feels a bit like a Mitski song?

**bandnitos** (7): why does this sound like that war is over xmas song

**fishingfor8** (7): FINALLY SOME VOCAL PUNCH!!! all of her music is so lowkey and one note

**ImADudeDuh** (7): joke joke joke joke joke joke joke

**Tedyonce** (7): Even if this song sucked, I'd have to give it a good score solely because of the title

**puberty1** (6.5): me when used the n-word on instagram

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): Iconic Title, song not so much

**Tolk1en** (5): This doesn't fit this album at all.

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Unfortunately, this may be the weakest song on the record. This song is so melodically awkward (especially when she sings the title) and is very forgettable overall.

**vayyiqra** (3): I like that she's doing something different with the shuffle beat but something about this song (idk if it's the lyrics, the melody, the vocal delivery) annoys me a lot.

**mudkip1** (0): hot take but i don't find this very appealing

Bop bop BOP alert! Now That I Found You was released as the second / third single off of Dedicated along with No Drug Like Me but this is unfortunately the end of the line for it, barely missing out on top ten. It doesn't do much to re-invent the wheel, which is what ultimately hurt its placement in the rate but a bop it is.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): I couldn't disassociate this song with basic white gays but this song is still pop perfection. Dancing to this in a sweaty, humid concert hall with other f-words is a core memory

**CritneySpearz** (10): my most played song of 2019, I truly thought this song would take off and be a hit...it's radio friendly and poppy AF! But I guess it didn't get much promo so... oh well I'm a clown.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This would've been the definite winner if we were rating the music videos.

**hikkaru** (10): a bit basic but a bop nonetheless!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Queen shit

**J\_Toe** (10): unabashed 10/10. Also, hot take: Stupid Love by Gaga sounds like the kind of song used in Queer Eye's promo, just like Now That I Found You.

**laurent1683** (10): This is the bop of my dreams. I play it everyday when I work at Subway to cleanse boomers' ears

**ManofOranges** (10): This song really just fills me with joy. Everything about it just floods my body with hope and optimism and it makes me hopeful that one day I will find someone that just makes me happy.

**mudkip1** (10): she fucking snapped here

**ReallyCreative** (10): It might not be the instant 11 that Run Away With Me or Cut to the Feeling are, but I have a huge love in my heart for this song. An absolute fun bop and in my opinion, one of Carly's best.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): An energetic and amazing bop, Carly delivers one of the best songs on the album

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): rip kitty :(

**worlds-okayest666** (10): queen of target commercials...meghan trainor shaking

**Xerop681** (10): oh my gosh queen of finding stuff search and rescue teams found DEAD.

**bulforster** (9.5): A valiant attempt to recreate Cut to the Feeling's euphoric perfection, so even though it's not as good, it's still great.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): a cute bop

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): i wanna see this live so bad

**wavingwolves** (9.5): this sends serotonin straight to my brain through my headphones and i love it!

**yourfacesucksass** (9.5): I loooove the throbbing effect in the verses. We stan Target.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): vibrant bubblegum purrfection

**1998tweety** (9): A nice bop, it does well a bit soundtrack-y but at least it bops hard.

**Awkward\_King** (9): she can make bops, bops she can make

**DaHumanTorch** (9): now that i found this bop im obsessed

**rickikardashian** (9): Carly knew damn well that I would like this song a ton more if she featured a bunch of cats in the music video

**thoeoe** (9): serving up the best bop on the album

**Tolk1en** (9): A perfect song. Except I feel like the echoes during the chorus are a bit too much. Like the repetition

**titi\_2001** (8.7): I love it

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): A cute bop

**twat\_brained** (8.5): https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyCatLady

**megm26** (8.3): this is a great song but I can't help but associate with that one target commercial

**fadedblue09** (8.2): Sure, it bops, but I'm surprised a lot of people preferred this to Party For One, which I thought was way stronger.

**Nickl00** (8): I remember hearing this in a target add and absolutely loving it and I still do

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): This is a bop but also there are songs that do this vibe better in Carly‚Äôs discography

**vayyiqra** (8): B O P

**Yatcho** (7.7): Its not Cut To The Feeling, or even close. There were bigger bops on Kiss

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (7.6): Look, it‚Äôs a good song, but it just sounds like a RAWM rehash, which no song can ever pull off successfully.

**akanewasright** (7.5): Good but not great.

**alwayswords** (7.5): a target commercial classic

**bandnitos** (7): i heard this in a target commercial and it was where it needed to be

**hunnybee12** (7): sounds like a target commercial

**leviswift13** (7): there are bigger banGers, but still a bop

**waluigiest** (7): The front half of this album is truly one of the most stunning sequences in recent pop music, which is why this song is good but doesn‚Äôt meet the mark. It‚Äôs bouncy and fun and still a great track, but wedged between No Drug Like Me and Want You In My Room is unfortunate.

**jexan13** (6.5): this, along with NDLM feel a bit... generic, perhaps? I listened to them so many times but they never clicked. They're fun but nothing new.

**Arybeck67** (6): kinda annoyed by this song but blame Target for that

**memesus** (6): weakest on album

**anothertown** (5): feels like an emotion c-side

**Sundraliz** (5): Love the plucky synth. All the verses feel the same to me though, and the chorus too.

I'm sorry little Jepsters but we have two brutal eliminations back to back, from the same single release nonetheless. If there's one song on Dedicated that truly captures that sultry, sexy 80s vibe, it's this one. The bass heavy track is very reminiscent of Warm Blood, a fan-favorite off of Emotion. No Drug Like Me was met with overall more praise than both Party For One and Now That I Found you and even in this rate, it ranks higher than both of those singles! Unfortunately it will have to rank just outside the top ten.

---

**1998tweety** (11): Good Lorde this song is amazing, that fucking chorus ugh. Like wow this song is so damn sexy and the production is immaculate. Hearing this life as the opener was incredible.

**Agusarg** (10): The song sounds delicious, one of her best in that regard. Not as catchy as some of the others on the record but definitely a highlight

**alwayswords** (10): im obsessed with carly‚Äôs vocals in this song

**anothertown** (10): an iconic bop that I dissociated to in a Target. So smooth and glimmery

**Awkward\_King** (10): i liked party for one and now that i found you a lot, but this was the song that grabbed me when she was rolling out the album, still stan it

**bandnitos** (10): PERIOD!!!!!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): Carly's most sexual song yet and it managed to be both demure and tense and that's what I love so much in this song. Carly managed to make a song about receiving a dick on any orifice of your body sound so innocent. The songwriting in this song is TOPNOTCH, especially the second verse. This song probably has my favorite Carly lyrics ever.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): where's the video ma'am

**DaHumanTorch** (10): bop, the chorus is the definition of infectious

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Maybe my favorite song on the album? It‚Äôs so sexy and sultry, there‚Äôs almost an air of danger to it. It always makes me think of a carnivorous plant that draws you in with its pheromones and then crushes you.

**hikkaru** (10): that synth bass :theflavor:

**ManofOranges** (10): Very addictive, pun intended

**memesus** (10): iconic beat drop

**mudkip1** (10): she fucking snapped here

**ReallyCreative** (10): the bass synth line here is the greatest thing I've ever heard she SNAPPED

**rickikardashian** (10): I remember so clearly this song having a video with this 90s commercial aesthetic where she was destroying an entire kitchen, and she was just rolling around in the messy kitchen while singing this song, turns out my mind just took this [teaser for the song](https://youtu.be/DzLQWX8r1j8) and turned it into a full on music video

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Queen of abolishing D.A.R.E.

**Sundraliz** (10): Remember that promo video Carly did for this song where she parodied the "Your Brain on Drugs" video and smashed up a kitchen? I sent that to my friends, my family, my professors, my boss, my therapist, and the cashier at the liqor store down the street (we are on a first name basis). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzLQWX8r1j8

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): I‚Äôm gonna have a hard time giving the songs on this album lower scores

**waluigiest** (10): After Party For One, this was in the first batch of promo singles along with NTIFY. This song is what really made me believe in this album. It‚Äôs dark, it‚Äôs romantic, it‚Äôs sexy. It‚Äôs kind of the Warm Blood of this album, and I never got sick of it. It was my #2 most played song of 2019 behind Juice.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this song is just SO good. the synths...chef‚Äôs kiss

**Xerop681** (10): there's no drug like THIS song!

**Yatcho** (10): The song that kind of saved this era for me and many others after Meh For One. This is so gd smooth, even for Carly standards

**akanewasright** (9.5): I remember listening to this song and feeling like the world was spinning around me.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Out of the singles from this album released before the album dropped, this was my favourite by far. Not my favourite from the album but it‚Äôs still pretty good.

**racloves** (9): also a bop

**sarcasticsobs** (9): the BASS in the chorus

**yourfacesucksass** (8.8): I'll be honest, this was my first full listen to this song. I couldn't get past the first verse before but I'm glad I pushed through.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (8.8): For some reason I love this song and not Warm Blood, which lots of you compared it to. Queen of drugs, Tove Lo could never

**titi\_2001** (8.1): The "Warm Blood" of Dedicated. Took me some time to like it, but now I really like it.

**\_wailordfan** (8): The chorus slaps, but the payoff feels spoiled by a less than great first verse.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I promise that you'll never find another like me!

**thoeoe** (8): continuing to feed those synths but a little more subdued of a track, still love it

**twat\_brained** (8): I see Kesha's impact remains alive and well.

**Arybeck67** (7.7): kinda forgettable but good???

**fadedblue09** (7.7): Cute bop, but I find it a little generic and I'm honestly tired of all these drug/love metaphors.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): say no to drugs, kids. don't listen to crj!

**letsallpoo** (7): lukewarm blood

**vayyiqra** (7): I can't stand love=drug metaphors, but I can make exceptions, and this is one. I love the ballads on Emotion like "All That" and this reminds me a bit of them.

**jexan13** (6.5): this, along with NTIFY, never clicked with me. Like, it's not bad, but there's something lacking; the meth ain't pure enough

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Honestly, this is one of the most meh songs on the album, it feels awkward and stilted.

**leviswift13** (6): always wanted to get it but never did, appreciate the sex of it all tho

**Nickl00** (6): it‚Äôs ok but not really my vibe

Just wow, what a way to start the album with. This is the perfect hype anthem, I was floored when I first listened to it. This is the type of song that makes you want to go speeding down the highway or the coastline, windows down and just blasting this song. It's a massive adrenaline rush and it doesn't let go for the entirity of the song. The signature X C X tag at the end of the song is the cherry on top of an already perfect song. I'm overjoyed that it made it all the way into the top ten as it deserves. Other pop girls take note, this is how you start an album!

---

**akanewasright** (11): I GO HARD I GO FAST AND I NEVER LOOK I GO SPEEDING ON THE HIGHWAY BURN RUBBER NO CRASH TURN THE VOLUME AT THE PARTY PUT YOUR HANDS UP UP AND DANCE BUMP BUMP IN THE RAVE GO FOREVER AND EVER

**bulforster** (11): Before the release I thought all her talk about how this was the one song on the album she made for her fans rather than herself was slightly cringey and wouldn't actually come across. But damn if I didn't tear up when I played this for the first time. She's so inclusive and earnest when it comes to parties and cars that it's honestly kind of inspiring.

**Agusarg** (10): Just iconic, what a way to start an album

**bandnitos** (10): im gonna be honest nothing on this album is below like a 7 and that's pushing it but holy fuck this is how you open an album

**bespectacIed** (10): Charli started this album with its highest point imo, one of my favorite pop songs of all time and probably Charli's best song ever. Next Level Charli is literal crack, it's a perfect distillation and description of what Charli's music feels and does to people. The lyrics and production also feels oddly somber, like remembering specific moments in youth and reminiscing how much Charli's music has impacted me. This song makes me sooooo emotional, it just so fucking beautiful and perfect, I've never stopped listening to it. No matter how much I didn't enjoy the album, I'll always have this to thank Charli.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): an intro! a moment!

**fishingfor8** (10): best song on the album? maybe. the funnest to listen too? yes

**hunnybee12** (10): makes me want to merge into an empty freeway going 100mph at 3am

**limpyjr** (10): Definitely in the top 10 pop album openers. HUGE ENERGY!!!!

**ManofOranges** (10): Catchy and a very apt first track

**minibjork** (10): this song is pure ecstasy if you don't listen to this and go absolutely ape shit what are you doing ??????

**mudkip1** (10): i get fueled with adrenaline when i listen to this song. i drive significantly faster when this plays in the car

**notceitn** (10): yes

**passionfruits2** (10): chorli sexysex told in an interview that this song is one to listen while getting ready for a party, while doing makeup and dressing up. she shouldn't have told me that, now everytime i get ready, even to go to the fucking supermarket, i feel obligated to jam to this. 10/10 tho

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): iconic opener

**sarcasticsobs** (10): a top-tier record opener, i want to run through a wall

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I wish I had a Prius so I could fully enjoy the song

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This was not necessarily my favorite when I first heard the album but it just goes hard and I really appreciate now as a track you can both vibe to and smash stuff too.

**wavingwolves** (10): the best opening track of any album ever probably

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this is such a perfect opener

**Xerop681** (10): yasss

**umadie** (9.7): One of the best opening tracks ever and a great statement of the album

**laurent1683** (9.5): If you don't turn the volume up when this song is on..

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): angel anthem, angel anthem

**DaHumanTorch** (9): i honestly hated this song when the album first came out. i thought it was too repetitive and her voice was really graying. however, it‚Äôs grown on me immensely and i can now say it absolutely SLAPS

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I feel like this song is like 10 genres together and I love it

**Nickl00** (9): Between the countless references and the whole song being at the same volume, it‚Äôs truly next level

**ReallyCreative** (9): A great album opener, but not good as a standalone song (which is fine). It sets the tone of the album well and I think leads very strongly into Gone

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): A great opener, Charli and AG Cook do it again and deliver this bop to start an iconic album

**waluigiest** (9): This song is the musical manifestation of her new, underground following in the pop world. This song exists because Vroom Vroom and Pop 2 got critical acclaim, but not the commercial success to match. It‚Äôs celebratory and moderately abrasive and classic post-Boom Clap Charli in the most fun ways. I personally LOVE the line about vibing in a Prius‚Ä¶ captures a weird suburban kind of joy

**Yatcho** (9): One of THEE best openers to an album I've heard. This is Charli's thesis statement, her pure essence. She should start her concerts with this til the end of time

**hefellapart** (8.8): a good intro

**twat\_brained** (8.7): bruh when she kicked off her set live with this I was LIVING

**1998tweety** (8.5): Bop, I like this as an intro to the album.

**megm26** (8.5): this is such an awesome opener

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): A cute, chaotic intro to the album. Does its job right, but isn't something I'd listen to on its own.

**thoeoe** (8): get hype, short and sweet

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): I kinda don‚Äôt get the hype for this? It‚Äôs good for sure (heh) but not worthy of winning a survivor like it did in xcxheads

**vayyiqra** (8): A great opener that gets stuck in my head all the time

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (8): Is this the second recent song for Charli‚Äôs fans she has released? After No Angel? I‚Äôm a recent Charli fan and I adore how much she loves us.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): Every time I listen to this song I really just wish it had MORE to it

**jexan13** (7): would be much much better if it were not so repetitive

**kappyko** (7): iconic intro

**leviswift13** (7): it's not backseat, but it's good

**yourfacesucksass** (7): She's singing the same note for the whole song lmfao

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): well I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs having a nice time

**titi\_2001** (6): It's decent.

**Arybeck67** (5.5): CHARLIIIIIIIIIIIIII

**fadedblue09** (4.5): It's energetic, I guess... but I don't see myself replaying it much.

**anothertown** (4): do people really stan this song? Lol?

**Tolk1en** (4): Only two different notes. The production is great, it starts well but then the vocals are "lazy"

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this was good but then she started singing

And thus we cut Pang's last non single. I'm honestly surprised that this hasn't been made into an official single yet because the potential is definitely there. The verses are some of the most mesmerizing moments on Pang, her flow is so stunning. But honestly, you don't even have to pay attention to the at times nonsensical lyrics to appreciate how brilliant this song is.

---

**cremeebrulee** (11): Hot take but this song (and Door) are both objectively better than So Hot so y'all better not do it dirty

**bandnitos** (10): that was a classic, that was a classic

**bespectacIed** (10): Caroline to the floor when she fell on stage that one time:

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the lyrics... the production... that's art mawma

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i love the background vocals and adlibs on the refrain

**Leixander** (10): I hope this goes Day 3!

**Sundraliz** (10): Best of the non-singles, super dreamy.

**Xerop681** (10): caroline hit me in my WIG

**Yatcho** (10): This was a grower for sure, I dont even think I paid any attention to it on my first listen to this album

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): baggage claim it, caroline is in the upcoming rap girls rate too right?

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): When I first heard the song I thought she was saying "I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plate" which made no sense but I figured Caroline just knew something that I didn't

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (9.5): I love the combination of Caroline‚Äôs experimentalism and Andrew Wyatt‚Äôs more mainstream sensibilities. Utter banger with great, relatable lyrics.

**leviswift13** (9): caroline knows how to make lyrically excellent bops

**minibjork** (9): I'm feeling like a butterfly ü¶ãü§î trapped üîí inside a plane ‚úàÔ∏è maybe there's something going on üëÄ‚òùÔ∏è, i‚Äôm not insane ‚ùåüò∑ if I'm already out of time ‚è∞, then make it worse üò∞ go on and hit me in the heart üëäüíî hit me where it hurtsüòµ

**Nickl00** (9): I really like this and it‚Äôs mainly the chorus but like the spoken verses too

**ReallyCreative** (9): I love how this song progresses, it feels and sounds like a standard-bearer Imogen Heap track and that's never an issue for me.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): Masochist queen snapped

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): This song makes me feel like a butterfly trapped inside a plane, there‚Äôs something going on, I‚Äôm not insane

**twat\_brained** (9): Man Getting Hit By Football, 1995. (colorized)

**Arybeck67** (8.7): hit me where it hurtssssss = my ‚ù§Ô∏è

**thoeoe** (8.5): Why do I want to give everything on this album an 8, the production is just incredible

**bulforster** (8.3): The butterfly simile and the lyrics of the first two spoken sections don't really work for me but the rest of the song makes up for them.

**hefellapart** (8): i can barely hear the lyrics but yes

**sarcasticsobs** (8): i like the verses, i don‚Äôt love them, but the chorus makes up for it all

**vayyiqra** (8): 24/7 chill lo-fi beats to study and relax to I really like this song, melodically and also the spoken-ish vocals that remind me of 90s Madonna. A very underrated deep cut!

**waluigiest** (8): some neat writing (‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane‚Äù) but why was the bridge like that

**1998tweety** (7.5): It bops but why does she do that weird thing with her vocals where it sounds like shes slurring.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the random wailing makes me drops a few points from this song

**ManofOranges** (7.5): well alright then

**titi\_2001** (7.4): Nice, but a little generic too

**fadedblue09** (7): The chorus is enjoyable, but other parts are lacking.

**wavingwolves** (7): while i like the chorus i don't like the verses lyrically simply because i usually don't like this listing thing. it feels a little lazy and it doesn't go that well with the rest of the song

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I love Caroline‚Äôs weird autotune sirens but they really need to be attached to a good song to work, they just feel tacked on here.

**Tolk1en** (6): A bit lazy in terms of melodies and instrumentation imo.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): oh no this album was such a pleasant surprise at first what happened

Among all of Dedicated's pre-release singles, this became an instant favorite of mine. This songs screams summer, I would have this on repeat until the album released, I just couldn't get enough of it. I'm still not tired of it. My only gripe with this song is knowing the existence of the analog intro used in the music video because that is utter perfection.. it needed to be on the album, PERIODT!

---

**J\_Toe** (11): this is introspective perfection, sonically and lyrically. The proliferation of Carlies in the video was a perfect embodiment of being "too much" (literally) too.

**TiltControls** (11): Honestly, the best song in CRJ'S discography

**titi\_2001** (11): This song watered my crops, cleared my skin, and transferred 1 million dollars to my bank account. Miss Carly Rae Jepsen came for my wig and went home with my scalp.

**Arybeck67** (10): is this my second 10 on this album? Yes it fucking is. This utter pop perfection and utterly relatable. Carly you know me too well ü§ß

**bandnitos** (10): the shining star on the album

**bespectacIed** (10): If only one song on Dedicated gets the overused tag "pop perfection", it's Too Much.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): not only does it slap but these lyrics ATTACKED me

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): WHY WAS THE LONGER INTRO CUT OUT FROM THE ALBUM VERSION?! Ugh, the cultural loss is absolutely devastating.

**leviswift13** (10): i feel like this is a spiritual sister to taylor's delicate ~ the gentle groove, the quiet vulnerablility, the rushing synths, the secret confessions. a masterpiece

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is not too much it is exactly right. It's perfect in like every way.

**mudkip1** (10): she fucking snapped here

**Nickl00** (10): this was the only other song besides NTIFY that I‚Äôd heard and I love it so much for so many reasons

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): queen of excess

**shesdoingyoga** (10): The lyrics hit a little too close to home

**waluigiest** (10): This masterpiece is at the midpoint of the album. It really nails the appeal and magic of Carly Rae Jepsen - this song is fun and gorgeous but really hits home for adults who are stepping into love for the first time. It nails all of the highs and all of the pains and insecurities. At least for me, giving all of myself in every situation is a bad habit, but there‚Äôs something inherently romantic about it. That‚Äôs what Too Much is for.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Big bop, a little repetitive but it works well with the song.

**fishingfor8** (9.5): i like this song too much

**Xerop681** (9.5): funny how a song called "Too Much" just makes me want more

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9.4): I'm bopping too much to think of a comment

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): this song is so cute i can't handle it sometimes

**minibjork** (9.2): carly rae queen of white dancehall

**jexan13** (9): I can finally say how much the intro of this is basically a more clean version of the intro of Dua Lipa's Be The One. Ahem, there's something about the the transition from the prechorus to the chorus in this song that is just incredible.

**megm26** (9): I really want carly to make more songs like this lyrically, my biggest problem with her is that all of her songs about love/relationships which gets old. This song delves more into her insecurities which is different from most of her other stuff and it's great.

**ReallyCreative** (9): I loved this song when it first dropped, and while I still do, it hasn't stood out as much to me as much as other tracks. It's still fantastic, and I love the message of the song, but I wish the bridge/post-bridge went a little harder

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): It‚Äôs not the most innovative song in the world but I‚Äôll be damned if it doesn‚Äôt go hard. I s t h i s t o o m u c h ?

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This took a while for it to grow on me but I like it more now but it‚Äôs not fav

**thoeoe** (8.5): This song fucking speaks to me, Carly how do you know me so well

**rickikardashian** (8.2): okay but the video game intro in the music video 100% deserved to be in the spotify version

**anothertown** (8): One of the better songs in this sparse and bland back half

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I‚Äôm never sure how I feel about this one, sometimes I think it‚Äôs boring and sometimes I think it‚Äôs a bop. I enjoy it more often than not but it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs missing something. It‚Äôs good but not great.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): idk I don‚Äôt feel anything as much as the other songs

**Sundraliz** (8): I always hear "are you down to clown" and I always am.

**twat\_brained** (8): ngl, Carly calling this her best song over Run Away With Me is highkey homophobic. the mv looks super fun and adorable tho, so Carly earns back points for that.

**vayyiqra** (8): Borderline personality disorder but make it cute and fun and I am for that as someone with it myself. :pensive:

**wavingwolves** (8): i can't relate to songs that talk about being too much and doing too much because i feel/do exactly the opposite but i don't care it's still such a bop

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): i'm still upset that this song got a video but Julien didn't

**fadedblue09** (7): It may be a bop, but let's not kid ourselves. This is super generic.

**hunnybee12** (7): great song, just wish she had chose a different sound. already sounds dated

**akanewasright** (6.5): I like this song, but not too much. The fact that it was pushed as a single when they had WYIMR is really sad.

**\_wailordfan** (5): this feels the closest to an emotion b-side so far, and I don't think that's a good thing.

**Tedyonce** (0): "For Sure" is more boring, but this is WAYYY overrated

**PANG!** The star of this song for me is the production, it's absolutely impeccable and keeps on building up with small quirks and variations for the songs entire duration. **PANG!** This is not to downplay the other elements of the song, such as the atmospheric backing vocals that add much needed nuance to the song. **PANG!** But when the production is this front and center, it's easy to just lose yourself in it, at least that's what I tend to do. **PANG!** And then there's that distinctive chorus. At least she makes sure that none of you will miss the title of the song or the album, **PANG!**

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): there's something about this song that makes it perfect but i don't know what it is, i think it's the exhale-like release of the word pang, anyway yeah it makes me want to cry i love it so much fuck that melon for hating it (jk, haha unless...)

**bespectacIed** (10): The ringtone sound added into the production is genius. Perfect title track, perfect vocals, perfectly set the tone of the album. Love the fact that the main theme of this album and song is emphasis and reaffirmation of emotions (into me, PÃ¥ÃîÕÑÕóÃáÕãÃèÃΩÃçÕÑÕÑÕçÃüAÃ¥ÃõÃæÃçÃæÃïÃ´Ã•ÕéÃ∫ÕéNÃ∏ÃáÃçÕÜÃÉÕóÃÆÃ≠ÕéÃûÃºÕáÃ≠ÃπÕúÃ¢GÃ∂ÕÉÃåÃóÃúÕìÕïÃ®). Love the double entendre between "pang" - the feeling and "pang" - the onomatopoeia. Love this song so much, one of the best pop songs to close out one of the best decades for pop.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i'm a sucker for title tracks in general but wow this is fantastic! really sets the whole mood for the album; The Gate is like an introduction and this is like, the emotional tone-setter if that makes sense

**DaHumanTorch** (10): one of my favs on the album. the production is gorgeous and the chorus...just something about it just hits chefs kiss

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This would've worked better as the actual intro instead of The Gate.

**fadedblue09** (10): Wow an onamatopoeic BOP. Also I loved those dial-tone/beeping sounds. I think this would've gotten my 11 if I stanned her harder enough.

**jexan13** (10): when Caroline fell to the ground in a concert, someone commented "the floor went into her... PANG!" and I can't stop thinking about that. About the song, the music box? sound and the outro are heavenly.

**leviswift13** (10): this shit hits different1!

**ManofOranges** (10): Very nice and I also like how when she says "pang" the music hits on that like it's a pang of music on the word "pang."

**mudkip1** (10): PANG

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is gonna sound pretentious af but this song really conveys what Caroline meant by Pang. A solid bop

**sarcasticsobs** (10): binaural beats baby

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): A contender for my 11, this is just a BOP through and through, catchy lyrics and gorgeuos atmosphere

**Yatcho** (10): The true opener of this album. The emphasis on the Pang! is just what I want from a song with this title. Also Im completely obsessed with the little chip turn repeated throughout and I really wish she would have explored that sound in this album a little more

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): One of my favorite songs on the album, what a fantastic title track and intro to the album. I love the weird spidery beat of the song and how everything explodes when she says ‚Äúpang!‚Äù It‚Äôs so sensual and romantic.

**umadie** (9.5): PANG! That sound completely summarizes the album.

**rickikardashian** (9.3): Into me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ [**PANG**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WgmH1vIsOk) and I go

**\_wailordfan** (9): that little high inflection during 'me, pang' makes me hard.

**anothertown** (9): The way she describes the pang as ‚Äúa beautiful knife cutting right where the fear should be‚Äù (‚ô•‚Äø‚ô•)

**bandnitos** (9): oooooh this is a vibe

**ImADudeDuh** (9): bop!

**notceitn** (9): beep boop queen

**ReallyCreative** (9): Gets a little reptitive but genuinely beautiful to listen to

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9): I have this song stuck in my head most days.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): Oh this is a bop, Caroline did not come to play

**twat\_brained** (9): the first time I heard this I was convinced it was just a phone alarm in the intro. That's actually just Danny doing his Danny thing. Also, a Door reference! Clever.

**wavingwolves** (9): the chorus is good but the verses are catchy in a non formulaic way and really elevate the experience

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (9): Excellent example of Caroline‚Äôs ability to convey and build emotion. That final PANG is so friggin‚Äô explosive!

**Arybeck67** (8.9): Her intonation on this track is die for in a glorious PANG üí•

**1998tweety** (8.5): Pang? More like BANG(er).

**akanewasright** (8.5): Killer opening track. It sets up the tone of album proper, it introduces arc words (‚ÄúI open the door and you run through‚Äù), and it‚Äôs just really cool to listen to).

**JunkyGS** (8.3): Really interesting production choices that definitely help elevate the song.

**bulforster** (8.2): My only issue is that while the chorus is suitably impactful the first time there's not really a overall climax I'd expect from a song called Pang.

**titi\_2001** (8.2): A fun song!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): cute!

**shesdoingyoga** (8): Gets a bit repetitive in a boring way but works otherwise

**thoeoe** (8): This feels like the actual opening track, the way she says "Pang" with the shaking lower end behind me gets me going.

**waluigiest** (8): The orchestration and composition of this song are wonderful, although it‚Äôs repetitive. The way she builds the entire thing essentially off of a 4 note repeated melody is compelling, and she uses that motif and builds off of it to write the melodies and other harmonies. And the way the extremely low piano notes come in when she says ‚Äúpang‚Äù is so cool!!! Let it vibrate sis!

**Xerop681** (8): cute

**yourfacesucksass** (7.7): I kept waiting for this song to go somewhere?

**fishingfor8** (7): a bit too much ringtone

**Nickl00** (7): I like the chorus, but the verses are a bit boring

**Tolk1en** (7): I love the productions and instrumentations, but it lacks a bit of energy. The last minute is lovely

**vayyiqra** (7): Bleep bloop is fun and good but I am not into her aggressively spitting "pang!!!" at me repeatedly.

While most of Pang was produced by Caroline and Danny L Harle, Ocean of Tears has production credits from A.G. Cook and Valley Girl as well. This is apparent as soon as you get to the drop and the outro that are strikingly more maximalist than the rest of Pang and honestly, it works fantasticly. It starts of slow, almost acoustically before building up with additional beats before you get hit by the post-chorus synths that will have you keep coming back for more. If anyone found Pang to be mostly boring and lowkey, this is definitely a track that remedies all that.

---

**anothertown** (10): big big bop. ‚ÄúThis is gonna be torture before it‚Äôs sublime; does that make it crazy? MmmmmMmm‚Äù is such an iconic opening lyric

**bespectacIed** (10): I HATED THIS SONG when it came out and I'm glad I forced myself to like it because this is perfection

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the sonic progression of this is just really enchanting tbh

**DaHumanTorch** (10): a banger and one of my favorites from the album

**fadedblue09** (10): OMG I loved the last minute of this! Still a consistent bop throughout.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgOFImtSTIE&frags=pl%2Cwn

**jexan13** (10): The best track of this album. The first verse is very good, the prechorus is great, but when she says "AH, IT'S AN OCEAN OF TEARS" and the production snaps and she just goes vocally to the atmosphere... damn it, what a talent. Among my top 10 tracks of 2019 this damn piece of art.

**leviswift13** (10): SO GOOOOOOOOOOD pirate emo

**limpyjr** (10): This song feels like when Caroline is fully embracing the PC Music sound, with the metallic synths and booming bass. Fantastic. My favorite song on Pang.

**Sundraliz** (10): Perfect 10 song makes me want to sing, dance, cheer, and cry.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): Thisssss is a banger. Glad Charli has rubbed off on her

**twat\_brained** (10): Get it because everyone's crying tears now that the ocean is at unsafe levels. Also THAT MELISMATIC FALSETTO CAROLINE PLEASE HIT ME WHERE IT HURTS MA'AM.

**vayyiqra** (10): lowkey the best track on the album

**waluigiest** (10): A+ crying at the club song. She nails the emotion, she nails the danceability. Stunning work honestly.

**Xerop681** (10): fucking perfect song i think i made my own ocean of tears listening to it

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): yes i like. caroline uses vocal effects so well

**rickikardashian** (9.5): this a recorded mermaid call and I'm falling for it

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): My only issue with the song is that I wish there was more going on lyrically instead of just oohs after the chorus

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): I think this is a cover of a song from Age of Empires 2, iconic

**akanewasright** (9): It took a long time for me to like this song, but now, I recognize its slaptitude.

**ManofOranges** (9): Finally some good fucking food

**thoeoe** (9): Ok but this track actually gets me going, Someone stop me, I'm going down!

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (9): Such a good song and I hate how much Pitchfork trashed it. Maybe Halsey did make some points /s

**1998tweety** (8.5): Okay this slaps, thankfully the album is picking up a bit.

**Arybeck67** (8): Caroline make me cryyyyy üåä

**bandnitos** (8): why i am i throwing it back

**Nickl00** (8): The synths at the end are godly

**worlds-okayest666** (8): ocean of grammys

**alasyorick** (7.5): can you tell i don‚Äôt really care about this album

**ImADudeDuh** (7): added 3 points cause of the last minute of the song

**titi\_2001** (6.8): Takes experiments with its production, but I don't really like it

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): There‚Äôs some parts I really like and other parts just ruin it

**letsallpoo** (0): someday i hope caroline learns how to enunciate

Want You In My Room sure had an interesting run in the top ten, hitting as high as #3 and as low as #7 before ultimately placing at #5. Some of yall seem to despise Jack Antonoff like the devil and well, that can't really be helped. Personally I adore this song, it's exactly the type of energy that I wanted from Dedicated. It's so infectious, like how can you NOT dance along to this? How she sat on this and not made it a lead single I will never understand because this is the type of energy that a comeback needs.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Definitely my favourite song on the album. It‚Äôs so infectious and this is exactly the kind of music we need from Carly.

**letsallpoo** (11): the only point j*ck antonoff has made in his life

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): absolute song of the universe

**1998tweety** (10): Carly surprisingly pulls off sexy so well, that outro is incredible.

**Agusarg** (10): Maybe Jack Antonoff snapped

**akanewasright** (10): This is my second most streamed song ever.

**Awkward\_King** (10): i dont want this to win the rate but i also cant in good conscience not give this a ten

**brenda\_official** (10): not only is having your window always open a huge security risk but it must also be pretty chilly in carly's room

**bulforster** (10): Queen of being a lighthouse!! I love how disjointed and animated each of Carly's lines is in an almost theatrical way, especially contrasted with the vocoder in the chorus. I'm also a massive sucker for a saxophone. Props to Jack, this is a masterpiece.

**CritneySpearz** (10): ON THE BED ON THE FLOOR

**DaHumanTorch** (10): my second fav on the album

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): NOT the best song on the album. It's still excellent, but I feel like it gets just a little bit too much praise because of the Jack Antonoff credit.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): A weird fact about this song is that the saxophone at the end is entirely balanced for the right ear, which I discovered while listening to it with only one earbud in.

**hikkaru** (10): jack antonoff slapped. screaming this out loud live was an experience. and the sax outro... we have no choice but to stan

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Jack Antonoff has never made a bad song in his life

**leviswift13** (10): pop perfection.

**limpyjr** (10): This song is pure fun. Carly and Jack need to work together more IMMEDIATELY

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is way too short it should be against the Geneva Conventions to make a song this good not even 3 minutes.

**mudkip1** (10): she fucking snapped here

**ReallyCreative** (10): The sin of making this song so short. Everything here works, it's such a stupidly fun song, but the fact that the sax solo is an outro instead of getting its own time to shine is perhaps one of the greatest tragedies in modern history. Jack Antonoff, you will be dealt with, period period.

**rickikardashian** (10): this going to be Carly's highest song, won't it?

**rotating3Dtext** (10): yeah i‚Äôm a sucker for jack‚Äôs production

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): My friend told me she hated this song because it was too happy for its subject matter, but she also only likes TikTok songs

**wavingwolves** (10): on the floor? are you sure? but it's so uncomfortable. maybe it depends of the floor, i guess.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): https://imgur.com/5wqCtJi.gif

**Yatcho** (10): Carly and Jack is an amazing combination

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (10): Queen of lighthouses and sex

**Arybeck67** (9.7): this song made this single lady want it allllllllll

**jexan13** (9.5): me @ Antonoff so he can teach me how he makes those bops damn it

**titi\_2001** (9.5): Its only flaw is that it's too short

**bandnitos** (9): maybe mr bleachers snapped

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): this song is so good but it also feels incomplete? like it's missing another chorus or a real bridge or something

**J\_Toe** (9): tbh, I prefer other tracks, but it's still really fun! (I also prefer Hate That You Know Me as a Jack/Carly collab).

**laurent1683** (9): Shiit, sounds so different from anything else, even makes me think of Tyler, The Creator for some reason

**minibjork** (9): this song in every john hughes movie ever

**vayyiqra** (9): I want Carly in my room too I'm surprised by this song and how experimental it is for her. And of course, the sexual lyrics, when her whole brand is being sweet and wholesome, but why can't she do both? I didn't realize that I love this song until now.

**waluigiest** (9): Thank you for this wonderful horny bop!!! The chorus is magical and she knows exactly what she did. From the ‚Äúon the bed. On the floor‚Äù to the ‚Äúslide in through my windoooow‚Äù it‚Äôs magic. This would be an easy 10 if she, uh, wrote a bridge.

**Xerop681** (9): wig

**fishingfor8** (8.5): the vocal at the end of the chorus "do you want me too" holds it back quite a bit

**Nickl00** (8): Like Julian, this is exactly the kind of music I want to here from her and it‚Äôs great

**thoeoe** (8): I love Jack

**\_wailordfan** (7.5): the intro feels like a really bad Bleachers song, and really makes me not get into it. Actually, this is kinda a running theme, the songs here all have pretty week intros and first verses but Ms. Jepsen snapped with her hooks in the choruses. "I wanna do bad things to you" yes mama.

**twat\_brained** (7.5): definitely one of the funkier songs and I don't know if it's just the front-loading of great songs but this feels a bit under-quality by comparison

**notceitn** (7): it's not bad but why does everyoneact like it's the best song ever

**shesdoingyoga** (7): A good song but there's just something about it that I don't really like

**Tolk1en** (7): This song is a bit messy because there are too many sounds. The background "want you in my room" is boring.

**bespectacIed** (6): I am not as obsessed as everyone with this song even though it's still cute. The jack antonoff-isms are so strong that it almost sound like a Terrible Thrills song??? And I can't stand the shouting. The only thing I really love is the instrumental bridge that fades out to the end. This is the popheads/indieheads consensus favorite song from the album and I couldn't disagree more

**Sundraliz** (6): I respect that this is a fav for a lot of people but it's middle of the pack for me.

**anothertown** (5): there is something that rings hollow here.. maybe the vocal delivery, or just the cheesy smegma that Jack Antonoff lays on thick over everything he does

**RandomHypnotica** (4): this song is decent, but GOD is it overrated here.

**fadedblue09** (1): Sorry, but I'm SO done pretending I like this song. I don't understand what y'all hear in this? I thought it was some ironic circlejerk until I realized you guys were really serious üíÄ. I hate the chorus, the production sounds like a bad Bleachers reject, and her voice teeters on annoying here (sounds like a bad Cyndi impression tbh). I don't care if my score makes an impact or not, but I'm just glad this rate exists so I can rant about it. Bye sis! Edit: I wanted to give this my 0 so bad but I‚Äôm afraid of all the persecution (and Everything He Needs is objectively worse anyway).

You open a DOOR... to another dooor... to another door... and another, and another.. Caroline said let me take yall on a musical journey because this is exactly what this song feels like, it's incredibly cinematic. The song is just as hypnotising as its repetetive chorus but this is one of those cases where reptition works in the songs favor. It held pretty steadily at #3 for a long while until the last week of the rate, unfortunately. The sheer range in her voice that's on display in this song is just next level. Definitely one of the album's highlights and I'm glad to see that it wasn't paid dust in this rate.

---

**Agusarg** (11): A whole masterpiece. Listening to the song is a journey, and the production and her vocals are just on another level. There's not enough praise I can give it, one of the best art pop songs ever made

**bbfan132** (11): i know people will give so hot their 11s over this but door is just too beautiful to not give an 11 to‚Ä¶ the vocals at the end alone make this an 11 for me. perfection.

**minibjork** (11): back in the city and i really am just another girl in a sweater !!!

**puberty1** (11): even though the album is my least favorite of the 3, this one was my clear 11. when she switches the back in the city to "everything's different when we're not together" is so heartbreaking and great at the same time.

**1998tweety** (10): Another serve, it's a little long but I don't mind so much cause it's good.

**anothertown** (10): songs like that, they are stories that people can identify with!!!!!!!

**Arybeck67** (10): my personal first introduction to Caroline and damn does she nail it. The way she sings ‚Äúdoor‚Äù over and over in the chorus creates such a tension that once it‚Äôs released, creates this euphoric joy. Yes, you‚Äôve finally caught your love, but it‚Äôs bittersweet cause ofc, you have another door to run through. The definition of romantic-anxiety/hopelessness in a song.

**Awkward\_King** (10): everything about it is perfect it's just not as perfect as so hot

**bandnitos** (10): YOU OPEN A DOOR !!!!!! TO ANOTHER DOOR !!!! ! ! TO ANOTHEH RODOOOR!!!!T TO ANOTHER DOOOR ! ! ! ! TO ANOTHER DOOOOOR. !! !! ! AMD IIM RUNNING THROOUTRYUGJ ! ! @TO YOU

**bespectacIed** (10): Genius song, genius chorus. I can feel the pointlessness of love and life and the entire universe with every iteration of "to another door"

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): you snatch off my wig to another wig to another wig to another wig to another wig

**DaHumanTorch** (10): a cultural reset. one of my favorite songs of 2019. an absolute masterpiece

**fishingfor8** (10): far away her best song it hits that sweets spot that most songs on her album doesn't hit

**hunnybee12** (10): toanotherdoortoanotherdoortoanotherdoortoanother

**JunkyGS** (10): Invented Doors

**laurent1683** (10): I wanna dream with this song playing

**leviswift13** (10): took a while to hit but really hit

**limpyjr** (10): This is the song I listen to when I want to ascend

**memesus** (10): this is one of the coolest and most perfectly written songs I've ever heard. It's magical.

**ReallyCreative** (10): GORGEOUS wow wow WOW the tenseness and resolution of the chorus is MASTERFUL she really DID that

**rotating3Dtext** (10): absolutely one of the best songs of 2019, wish I could give another 11

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This song reminds me of the time in high school when the choir went on a trip to New York City and my group was leaving a building that had a revolving door and I thought it would be a good idea to try to jump in right behind my friend but then I got pushed forward by the door and fell forward and stepped on her shoe and somehow broke the bottom of her shoe off

**waluigiest** (10): Her voice is so fuckin weird it‚Äôs fantastic and works with her roundabout run-on sentences and allegorical writing

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this song is so stunning...im mixed on pang as a whole but this song shows caroline has potential to create something amazing

**hefellapart** (9): DOOR

**jexan13** (9): the chorus is great, but the verses took some time to grown into me

**rickikardashian** (9): how many doors does this bitch have

**Sundraliz** (9): First Caroline song I heard and I had no choice but to stan

**thoeoe** (9): Great followup, I honestly wish it was the closer to the album, you could drop Parachute sorry

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9): Love the immersive production on this one

**TragicKingdom1** (9): to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door

**twat\_brained** (9): Are those Caroline's own dogs? Also I'm sorry to say this but when Caroline vocalizes at the end I can't help but think of that video of a choir boy inhaling helium from a balloon to sing a high note. It's immature and I deserve to be rinsed for it. And for that I can only give this a 9.

**wavingwolves** (9): this song has no right to be such a meme while still being so beautiful

**Xerop681** (8.5): queen of opening doors

**megm26** (8.4): to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door

**ManofOranges** (8): You open a door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door

**Nickl00** (8): The verses are ok, but once you get to the chorus it‚Äôs heavenly

**sarcasticsobs** (8): to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door to another door

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8): Very nice and chill

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): Considered giving this a four in order to make a four in another four in another four joke but then remembered that I‚Äôm not funny

**fadedblue09** (7.8): Disappointing hook, but I dig the atmospheric vibe. Also I love the guitar in the bridge and last few minutes were an album highlight.

**hikkaru** (5): a bit too long and uninteresting for me

**ImADudeDuh** (5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4270c5qWPBg

**Tolk1en** (5): The production is boring, repetitive. The echoes are annoying. It is also too long

**vayyiqra** (4): Going to have to be brave and say I think this song is overrated. I like some things about it, but then I kind of dislike the chorus and how repetitive it is. It sounds like a Born to Die reject by a chill lo-fi beats producer who's stoned. Also this is so petty I won't take points off for it, but I feel like "Door" is a really dumb name for a song. Don't ask me why.

Julieeeeeeeeeenhhh!! I'm sorry little Jepsters but this is Carly's exit for this rate. Truth be told, Julien never stood a chance of winning this rate, but it had an incredible run in the top ten! It was in the lower #8-#7 ranks for a large portion of the rate before the 11s started rolling in, taste prevailed after all! Many were expecting Dedicated to be disco influeneced and while it didn't quite turn out that way, Julien is one of the tracks that captures a nostalgic disco feel while also remaining modern and fresh. The sparkles in the chorus when she's chanting "Julieeen.." is among my favorite production choices on the album. A top three placement for it is non too shabby among such talentry that is in this top ten!

---

**alwayswords** (11): ju11ien

**CritneySpearz** (11): one of the best pop songs of the decade, dont @ me.

**DaHumanTorch** (11): my favorite song on dedicated, in this entire rate, and of 2019. the funky, glittery production, the insanely catchy chorus, just everything about it is phenomenal

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): I HATED this when it came out as a promo single, but I've been in love with it ever since the album came out. Very addictive.

**hikkaru** (11): some of the only remnants from Disco Sweat on this album but lorde it slaps!!!

**megm26** (11): idk this song is just so perfect to me, it's so infectious and catchy and the production is immaculate. The lyrics are super evocative of a strong love and this really proves Carly's pop prowess.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): god this song is honestly perfection, it's easily the closest Carly's come to RAWM so far, it's just catchy, fun, sexy and a total bop. also, my headcanon is that this actually somehow a song Jenna Marbles wrote.

**TinosCallingMeOver** (11): Pop perfection where even the production on the chorus itself evokes a sparkling disco ball.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (11): I came into this rate knowing it would be my 11 and I have no doubt in my mind about it. We love that it‚Äôs also the 1st song, hope the rate results follow suit

**Yatcho** (11): Disco tinged pop perfection! As always Carly was ahead of the crowd and kick started the disco revival trend with this massive bop. I truly FEEL that shimmer in the chorus go through my whole body every time I hear it

**Agusarg** (10): Carly release Disco Sweat challenge

**akanewasright** (10): Near-perfect opener. Would be my 11, except for the occasional production glitches.

**Arybeck67** (10): This song is utter pop perfection. Like Julien where have you been my whole life üò©

**Awkward\_King** (10): tbt when carly said in her ama that julien was some rando she met in canada. her mind truly, everybody say thank you julien

**brenda\_official** (10): it feels like i wake up every day too! twinning!

**bulforster** (10): My most played song of last year. Modern disco magic.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): obligatory "i wish i had more than one 11 to give!" this slice of disco heaven is absolutely sublime and deserved to be the lead because it really lets her shine in a new sonic space. the way she practically sighs "Julien" is literal art

**fadedblue09** (10): Please let this be the highest-ranking Carly song and not Whack You In My Room.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song is just so smooth and disco-y. One of my favourites from her.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a weird choice for an opener, but a bop!

**jexan13** (10): I knew, since I heard those funky guitars, that I would absolutely love this. Damn it, i¬¥t's just so fun... Imagine being named Julien and having this song, it would be a highlight of your life

**JunkyGS** (10): So close to being my top if Gone wasn't one of my favorite songs of the past 5 years.

**ManofOranges** (10): Delicious to the ear

**memesus** (10): this synth thing is stuck in my head 100% of the time

**mudkip1** (10): she fucking snapped here

**racloves** (10): a bop

**ReallyCreative** (10): What a fucking way to start an album. Julien SHOULD have been the lead single, as it is an amazing introduction to the album/era as a whole, but hey, we love Carly even when she makes decisions like that. The song itself is just incredible, though a more traditional bridge might elevate this song even further. Either way, a welcome addition to Carly's phenomenal catalog

**rickikardashian** (10): whenever I hear this song I think of Julien Solomita, and I cry silently to my bed knowing damn well I'll never be able to find anyone as good as him

**Sundraliz** (10): This song is soooooo dreamy it makes me melt.

**thoeoe** (10): I could give this song a 10 alone for the synths in the intro, but that vocal production slays me

**twat\_brained** (10): put me in the Jenna Marbles section

**waluigiest** (10): Instead of praising this phenomenal song in general, I‚Äôm just gonna draw attention to my favorite, perhaps underappreciated part: the beat shift that bisects the chorus.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i love it here!!

**Xerop681** (10): songs so good made me want to fuck someone named Julien

**wavingwolves** (9.9): probably my favourite from dedicated but i can't give it a 10 because the little glitch annoys me. i wish carly would give us disco sweat but she hates the gays

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): A great opening track that lets you know exactly what you're going to get with this album

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9.5): A taste of what could have been Disco Sweat, currently burried in her backyard

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (9.2): Look, the only 2 Juliens I have ever met/known were the lemur and my boss when I was 17, and this track makes me want to get down with one of them

**hefellapart** (9): a song that tastes like mountain spring water. it might be water, but it still has flavor to it.

**leviswift13** (9): i'm gay and young and in love!

**Nickl00** (9): I‚Äôm new to Carly but this is exactly what I want out of an artist with a voice like hers

**rotating3Dtext** (9): f in the chat for disco sweat. is this disco?

**vayyiqra** (9): Remember how hyped everyone got about CRJ releasing a nu-disco album? This song is kind of it. It's very catchy and boppy and fun, and gets stuck in my head all the time.

**fishingfor8** (8.5): great intro to the album

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.5): is it bad that the so-called centerpiece of the album is one of my least favorites on it? it still slaps though

**1998tweety** (8): This is probably one of my least fav songs on the album tbh. It's nice but I don't like the chorus a whole ton

**bespectacIed** (8): I love Julien and its signature bass but it always feels like it is leading up to something, but it doesn't. It feels incomplete, like a champagne bottle that didn't pop loudly when you removed the cork.

**J\_Toe** (8): tbh I don't like this song as much as others on the album, but it's still an 8/10, which is really great. And Carly's right: Julien is a really musical name.

**Tolk1en** (8): I'm not sure this song fits well as a single. There is nothing special about it. Kinda boring. Her voice is so gorgeous that it's still a good song.

**laurent1683** (7.5): Good but Juuuuulien is by brother's name so it kinda creeps me out as a fellow twink.

**titi\_2001** (7.2): It's groovy, I kinda like it, and it has grown on me, but I think it's far from the best song on the album

**yourfacesucksass** (7.2): It's not my fave tbh. It's not bad at all, but to me it's just here.

**bandnitos** (7): she's cute but the background noise in the vocals is killing me

**kappyko** (3): okay i hate the vocal sound here

**therokinrolla** (2): this song sounds cheap. There's glitches in the first prechorus, there's skips in the actual chorus, the postchorus drop sounds lame as hell, the bridge is just empty space.... I love the shimmery hook but it sounds like it was produced in a submarine. The only bad song on dedicated tho üò≠

skargardin: # Dedicated

---

**Overall Average**: 7.988 **// Average Controversy:** 1.646

---

**ReallyCreative** (9.000): 9 I love this album. Unapologetically. I think it is a worthy successor to E‚Ä¢MO‚Ä¢TION even if the peaks aren't quite as amazing or as plentiful as that masterpiece. The album has a lot of amazing tracks and I appreciate some of the experimentation Carly did. There's some filler, some choices, some questions to be sure, but at the end of the day Carly delivers some amazing pop. The opening few songs are arguably some of her best, and while the rest of the album doesn't quite hold up to that opening blitz of bops, there's still a lot to love on this album. If there's a big criticism to be had, it's that the tracks are too short and too many have abrupt endings. Want You In My Room in particular is hamstrung from being Carly's all time best by that particular problem. However, I can't help but love these tracks and the overwhelming boppage that Carly serves, it might not be Disco Sweat, it might not be E‚Ä¢MO‚Ä¢TION 2, but it's special in its own way and has a lot to offer fans of pop.

**hikkaru** (8.900): by far my favourite album in this rate. is it as good as emotion or side b? no, not quite, but it's still FANTASTIC and very consistent, which I definitely can't say about Pang or Charli unfortunately.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.900): creating a follow-up to EMOTION was no easy task, but Ms. Jepsus pulled it off with her usual whimsy without retreading the same sounds that brought her a cult following. it feels like an artistic progression; there are nods to that vibrant 80s sound, but it never feels like EMOTION Side B the Re-Up Reloaded

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.733): I don't think my opinions on Carly are valid.

**waluigiest** (8.733): Carly Rae Jepsen was my most listened to artist of 2019, and it wasn‚Äôt even close. No matter how I praise the artistry behind some of my other favorite albums of last year (e.g. NFR, Magdalene, Father of the Bride), none have the staying power and replayability of Dedicated. This is the same pop magic that Carly has delivered time and time again. She really captured the magic of falling in love for the first time and all of the clumsiness and passion that goes with it. My top 3 from this album (Everything He Needs, Too Much, No Drug Like Me) never fail to put me in a pleasant, tranquil mood. This album just fills me with love.

**jexan13** (8.633): Is it better than Emotion? Sadly, no. Is it a solid work of art that should be respected and loved? HELL YES. This album feels... simple? Maybe even plain, but not in a bad way. Like, it's not too ambitious (excluding some few tracks), but it feels like a warm nice place where I can rest. Ok, I'll stop before someone calls me a clown.

**megm26** (8.507): although emotion has better tracks individually, I think dedicated is much stronger as an album. I think it‚Äôs more mature and cohesive.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.473): Okay so please don't kill me, but I just could not get into Dedicated at first. I thought Party For One was fine but it didn't give me any kind of lasting impression. I really enjoyed Now That I Found You and No Drug Like Me, but basing my expectations off these three singles sort of put me off the album when it was released. Julien is not my favorite to have as a lead single, and then that further pushed me away from finishing the album. BUTTTTT, late to the party as usual, I've now listened to the whole album and there are much more tracks that I really like than I dislike. To me, my favorite Carly release is the Side B, and I probably shouldn't have expected a similar-sounding album but....here I am now!

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.433): It‚Äôs not better than Emotion, but it still has bangers.

**bulforster** (8.367): It's a good album and I really like most of the songs but somehow doesn't feel quite as good as the sum of its parts, I think because it's a bit front-loaded.

**Leixander** (8.233): I love this album more than Emotion.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (8.220): Isn‚Äôt as consistently good as Emotion imo, but still a very decent album. The highs (WYIMR, EHN, Julien, etc) are about as high as those from Emotion (eg RAWM, Lets Get Lost, Emotion, Favourite Colour). However, while I love every song on Emotion, I‚Äôm unfortunately not really a fan of Automatically In Love or The Sound. It sits at #5 of my most played albums in 2019, but this is due to the strength of its highs rather than consistent quality. I look forward to what Carly has planned next.

**bespectacIed** (8.133): I am biased and my scores will inevitably skew in favor of Miss Carly. I attended the Dedicated tour. I danced my life out with Carly and her pastel rainbow layered tulle gown. My emotional attachment to this album is through the roof. No it's not as strong and impactful and sonically-focused as Emotion, but Dedicated is still full of wonderfully produced, irresistible pop songs that make Carly still the reigning and undisputed faggotmaker. Long may she reign.

**twat\_brained** (8.007): after hearing this the only Carly album I've not heard yet is Tug of War. I'll check that out later this year.

**wavingwolves** (7.807): idk i love this brand of straightforward and 80s influenced pop as much as the next person but i do feel like carly played a little to safe here. still, i really love this album and the production aspects, but i keep expecting a lot more from carly (starting with a better album cover if we are being honest).

**vayyiqra** (7.733): I think I slept on this album a lot after only streaming it once last year, forgetting about it, and never going back to it. It's really good, not as good as Emotion (but then, what is?) and full of cute bops in classic CRJ style. I think it's her second-best album and maybe is a little long, and "Party for One" should've been on it, but these are only minor gripes. I need to listen to this album a lot more, because it slaps. Overall rating: 7.6

**fadedblue09** (7.567): It's fine for what it tries to be, a cute collection of pop songs. Probably just me, but I feel like this album is the closest thing to a record that represents Carly at her most sincere self. Kiss felt like it was fishing for hits, and Emotion felt too calculated to be a hipster-pandering record. This is more of Carly trying to further hone her signature sound. That being said, I wouldn't mind if she went a bit more adventurous in her music (exemplified by tracks such as I'll Be Your Girl), because IMO her album feels the most ‚Äúsafe‚Äù.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.373): I rated this album a lot more favorably than I expected to, mostly because it‚Äôs hard for me to form an opinion on a lot of these songs that‚Äôs either positive or negative. It‚Äôs the most consistent album in the rate in the sense that there's no *terrible* songs but a lot of them are just like‚Ä¶ there. It‚Äôs not *Emotion* and while *Kiss* was more fractional, I‚Äôd say it was more consistently *interesting* than this. *Dedicated* is heavily front loaded, all the incredible songs are placed at the front of the album and were released as singles so it kind of feels like everything past ‚ÄúToo Much‚Äù is just a waste of time. I feel like she had better stuff in the vault that got passed over in service of her vision for this album (like ‚ÄúCut To The Feeling‚Äù being deemed ‚Äútoo cinematic‚Äù) but this is almost too cohesive, a faceless collection of bops could honestly have been more enjoyable.

Gone has been highly praised ever since it was released. It gained Pitchfork's coveted Best New Track mark and it won Popheads' Top 100 songs of 2019 voting. Given that, I was sure that this was going to win but alas. It was always going to be between Gone and So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings, no other songs stood a chance at winning. The songs were 0.5 scores away from each other for most of the rate until the last week where some low scores brought it down and placed So Hot.. in the lead and it never recovered. Given how much acclaim this has already gotten and how it has already won one huge ranking on this sub, I'm not terribly mad at it losing out on the crown. Opinions ultimately remained too divided for it to win and all it took was a few users who disagreed with the masses to bring it down. I stand by my opinion that this a perfect blend of the maximalist Pop 2 record condensated into a more mainstream type of song that still manages to strech the edges of mainstream pop. She captures the feelings of not belonging, the anxiety of being in a crowded party so incredibly well.

---

**JunkyGS** (11): Is there really any other choice if we are being honest? This song tackles insecurities in an honest and aggressive way, as if she is fighting against them and herself through out the song. The lyrics and production fuel this frustrated feeling, while taking elements of the 80s + 90s and making them futuristic sounding. This is a song we will find ourselves returning to in 5, 10 years and finding it had the same impact. If there is not any sort of sabotaging this should easily be the winner of the best song in the rate because it perfectly captures anxiety, insecurities, anger, self-doubt and pushes pop music to another level.

**limpyjr** (11): This song was my song of the year for 2019. Flawless production. Great lyricism. Great performances from Charli and Chris. The CODA!! It‚Äôs a perfect amalgamation of Charli and Chris‚Äô individual styles and gives us a futuristic pop BANGER!!!! I don‚Äôt know a better song.

**ManofOranges** (11): This song is actually perfection to me. The production is just the right amount of PC music while still actually being palatable. The lyrics are just the right amount of incomprehensible while still actually being comprehensible. It all just comes together in this perfect storm of music.

**memesus** (11): holy fuck

**rotating3Dtext** (11): instant classic, made me sooo excited for the album. love the breakdown. deserved to be a hit damn.

**sarcasticsobs** (11): This is pop perfection, I will no arguments to the contrary.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (11): Charli manages to keep her PC sound from her mixtapes and makes it "radio" friendly. An amazing and a perfect song. Charli and Christine SNAPPED here together and Christine lends great vocals with the wild deep PC bass playing. The ending keeping that trend on Pop 2 with a final 3rd act in the song where the production goes ham...wew. One of my favorite songs of all 2019 and in general

**TragicKingdom1** (11): i would be very surprised if this lost after defeating Juice in the top 100 songs of 2019 list

**worlds-okayest666** (11): it was a close battle for my 11 but this won. this song manages to have major hit potential while also keeping the experimental PC Music edge of Charli‚Äôs later work and honestly? It‚Äôs just a perfect pop song imo.

**1998tweety** (10): Ok this is a major bop, a good mix between a mainstream hit and Charli's unique style.

**Agusarg** (10): Probably Charli's most acclaimed song, and for a reason. It's pop perfection

**akanewasright** (10): Best single of last year.

**anothertown** (10): ah that‚Äôs history

**Arybeck67** (10): fuck I‚Äôm giving out a lot of 10s but goddamnit does this song deserve it. The production, the lyrics, Christine and the Motherfucking Queens like what else do you want out of a track?

**Awkward\_King** (10): deserved to win the sub's song of 2019, sorry phcj (but also stream juice). it's so fucking good man i love the whole song but the end of chris' verse when she goes "i feel so unstable fucking hate these people" with the emphasis she puts on the word fuck. phenomenal sis

**bandnitos** (10): woah vicky smash video

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is the alt-pop telephone

**cremeebrulee** (10): Had to give this a 10 cause I know some of you hoes are gonna be sabotaging it

**CritneySpearz** (10): if Julien didn't exist, it would be an 11

**DaHumanTorch** (10): incredible song, one of my favorites from 2019. not only is it phenomenal sonically, but lyrically it‚Äôs so relatable and well written. truly a masterpiece. i wouldn‚Äôt even be debating giving this an 11 or not if this wasn‚Äôt against so much other incredible competition

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, showstopper, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I have never been the biggest Charli fan but I absolutely love this song so much. It‚Äôs anthemic and a massive bop front or back and Christine does an amazing job too as well.

**J\_Toe** (10): why do people keep saying Christine sounds like MJ what is wrong with ur ear, srsly! She has a slight sh pronunciation that MJ doesn't, plus she clearly sounds French and never says shamona! like, is this a bit? is there an inside joke here I'm not part of?

**jexan13** (10): this won /r/popheads SOTY, so this is winning this, isn't it? Well, it deserves it, sincerely. Chris and Charli's delivery is perfect and I can't avoid singing "f*cking hate this people lately" basically everyday jejej.

**kappyko** (10): insert sum shit about pots and pans cuz idc this is HARDLY worth sabotaging! especially when christine and the queens snapped like that. a worthy winner - or will it win lol. actually FUCK that ending do yall hear christine about to say something

**leviswift13** (10): WHY DO WE KEEpKEEeekpkeep wherethewaAATerRERruns

**megm26** (10): some of charli‚Äôs best songwriting imo, she perfectly captures the feeling of being isolated at an event and the song itself is really catchy. The production is also awesome, and Christine comes to serve.

**Nickl00** (10): Perfect Pop

**passionfruits2** (10): 'i have to go, im so sorry, but it feels so cold in here.' ok. i feel that. ok charlee babee, you did something in this simple line. i don't always enjoy being at parties, and this simple line is exactly what goes thru my mind when that happens. 'all these people next to each other, but it's still so cold'. i feel sad now.

**ReallyCreative** (10): I FEEL SO UNSTABLE FUCKING HATE THESE PEOPLE HOW THEY'RE MAKING ME LOOOOOATHHHHHEE - me regarding this sub after I'll Be Your Girl gets robbed

**Sundraliz** (10): Not even a Charli stan but this song is a masterpiece.

**thoeoe** (10): What hasn't been said about this song already. fucking slay me

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): Ugh I want this to also be my 11 smh

**twat\_brained** (10): I really want Caroline to win since she was a nobody to Popheads before 2019 but this was voted #1 song of 2019 for very good reasons, and it would be incredibly na√Øve to bet against Gone. The chemistry Charli and Christine exhibit is second to absolutely none. Give me a flashy dance choreo while freeing yourself from a rope tied to a car while it starts raining prior to a burning circle forming around you every year, please. I'll never get tired of it.

**umadie** (10): One of the best songs of 2019

**vayyiqra** (10): Watch Popheads be dumdums and rob this because of their hipster "if it's popular it now sucks" attitude and herd mentality, but this is a really good song. Also stream Chris, you heathens, and listen to someone who's not American or British for a change. This is a great synthpop song.

**waluigiest** (10): flawless song. This was easily my song of the summer, 2019. The production is so clean. The synths are gorgeous. The lyrics are pretty and it doesn‚Äôt matter that they‚Äôre kind of nonsense! It‚Äôs a song about anxiety! And the bridge/outdo when they start chopping pieces of the song up? Delicious. My favorite part is definitely Chris‚Äôs grunt at 2:14

**Xerop681** (10): song title describes my wig

**Yatcho** (10): Fantano made some points when he said this is one of the biggest pop anthems of the decade! Not a single flaw to be heard here, this pairing works so well together and they're firing on all cylinders including the music video

skargardin: yall had a LOT to say!

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (10): I‚Äôm fully expecting this track to win the rate, and it‚Äôs deserved. Absolute banger and nothing else in this rate matches the moment when Christine sings in French

**bulforster** (9.5): That synth resonates with my soul.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Hmm.. I feel like this song is pop perfection but I can't help but feel like it's missing something.

**minibjork** (9.5): 'keep' really is the catchiest word in the english language

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9.5): This is almost a perfect song - I‚Äôd give it a 10 except ‚Äòhow do we keep when the water runs‚Äô still makes no sense to me

**\_jspain** (9): : in this house we stan Christine and the Queens

**shesdoingyoga** (9): I love it as a whole but something about the outro feels like it goes on just a bit too long

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): i have to go

**wavingwolves** (9): i feel so instable fucking hate my label and how they make me feel lately

**titi\_2001** (8.3): I like it, it's good

**hefellapart** (8): ngl, i felt like this song was overhyped. like she's cute, but not gorgeous

**\_wailordfan** (7): I know this will probably win, but I am in a weird minority where I really don't like Christine's voice, especially with Charli's.

**PointlessBibliophage** (7): i know this deserves more and i'm sorry, but robbing juice was absolutely unforgivable

**RandomHypnotica** (7): the first 2/3 of this song are great but the end is kinda.... not

**rickikardashian** (7): how much are you guys getting paid to act like this is pop perfection?

**fishingfor8** (6): it's fine. But if this wins...

**hikkaru** (5): since it was released I've found this song to be fairly uninteresting and that has not changed

**ImADudeDuh** (5): christine saves this

**puberty1** (4): i honestly want to like this song like most people here do but to this day it's just "meh" to me sadly

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): This song is like background music and by background music I mean being hit in the head by a plain block of plastic. I genuinely don‚Äôt understand why people listen to this.

**bespectacIed** (0): This is the rate winner, whatever. But idgaf, I didn't flinch giving this song this score after the stress that its popularity has befallen me. An undeniably cute bop, but this is soooooooo boring and banal and corny and infuriatingly overrated. I CANNOT fathom why literally everyone --- from critics to stans --- love this, when it brings nothing new or interesting or enjoyable to the table. The lyrics are so basic, the instrumental so boring and nothing to rave about, Christine as talented as she is didn't sound good, and the song ended limply. I feel alien seeing the overwhelming hype to it because I fucking love Charli the artist, she's one of my most listened artists ever, and I think I am supposed to liked Gone, which supposedly the best song in an album that is supposedly better than the pop perfections Pop 2, Number 1 Angel, and True Romance???????? It's making me so angry, I really don't know what I am missing out. My actual rating for it is somewhere between 4 and 5 but this 0 is reparations for my stress!!!!!!

skargardin: # Charli

---

**Overall Average**: 7.730 **// Average Controversy:** 1.956

---

**bulforster** (9.060): Easily my 2019 AOTY. An incredible culmination of her evolution since Sucker.

**wavingwolves** (8.700): my favourite album from last year and one of my favourites ever. i clearly like all the songs and i think it fits so many different moods while being cohesive, experimental and fun. everytime i listen to this album in full i feel like it's a different experience and there's so few albums that can do such a thing for me.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.460): Again, please don't revoke my gay, but I didn't really give this album a chance at first because I just hate myself. HOWEVER, I've now come to appreciate her going against the grain of pop music. Even though I love Sucker and she hates it (I'm not bitter at all) PC Charli is so ballsy. I'm not too familiar with PC music, in fact didn't know what it was until Charli's musical shift, and it's not exactly my cup of tea. I do enjoy her blend of pop/PC though. Some songs still sound very abrasive to me, but I stumbled upon the White Mercedes video on YouTube a few weeks back and it drew me in. I re-listened to Gone and now I love it, though I really didn't like it before.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.400): Took its time to grow on me (I swear I type these exact words at least once in every rate I do). The refined quality compared to the mixtapes doesn't come without its setbacks, and the lack of Sophie's involvement is SHOWING. Still, this is my second favorite Charli project, after Vroom Vroom.

**jexan13** (8.400): This album truly had the potential to be great. Some of the songs here are among the best of Charli's, the hooks are perfection and the aesthetic is nice... But somewhere along the way the train derailed and... well. The worst offense is that some tracks are just too simple. I mean, in Charli you have Cross You Out's thick bass, Click and Gone's airport sounds and Shake It's portal to year 10292... among songs that could be filler in an album of idk, Selena Gomez or Lady Gaga.

**megm26** (8.273): I think it does a really great job of tying mainstream and experimental Charli together. She has absolutely crazy songs and songs designed to be radio hits on the same album, and she makes it work.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (8.047): I hated this album on first listen, but it soon became my #6 played album of the year (maybe it was Stockholm Syndrome lol.) While Pop 2, which I discovered due to Charli, is very consistently good, Charli and N1A are a little all over the place for me. Nevertheless, Gone was one of my favourite tracks last year and I‚Äôm grateful for the introduction to Charli‚Äôs incredible discography.

**waluigiest** (7.933): I didn‚Äôt immediately fall in love with this album. That being said, I didn‚Äôt immediately fall in love with Pop 2 either. It‚Äôs not quite as consistent, but it has a lot of incredible moments. It features great production, excellent features, nasty synths, and honestly some of her best writing. Overall it‚Äôs a really good record, even with some songs or moments that don‚Äôt quite work.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.600): I dunno, I never really dug this album. For sure my least favorite of the three.

**twat\_brained** (7.527): My scores will reflect this as the worst album in the rate, but Charli is by no means a bad album; I find that it's just paced a bit inconsistently, and there are songs which could easily be swapped out for better ones. For instance, "No Angel" details Charli's own faults, although that could be somewhat redundant in the advent of songs like February 2017. All this to say, Charli is good, but I expect greatness from Charli. Good isn't doing it anymore for her.

**vayyiqra** (7.333): I've been a fan of Chorli Xbox since her first album, which is still probably my favourite by her, and I've seen her twice on the tour for her first and latest album. I've been with her the whole time and seen her change so drastically from shy jaded goth girl to fun outrageous party girl, and it was jarring at first when it seemed like her personality did a 180 when she released Vroom Vroom, and she also got a totally new audience because of it. Of course, that's not wholly true and there were always elements of techno rave party Charli in her old music, and of moping gloomy Charli in her new work, and that adds a lot of nuance to this album which I felt was lacking on her last two mixtapes albums. Sonically, they were great, especially Pop 2, but I could never quite vibe with the lyrics a lot of the time and thought they were kind of dumb - there are only so many songs about cars I can take. However, this album is great, a synthesis of her whole career so far, and full of really cute ballads and dance-pop bangers alike. It's too bad that "Shake It" brings it down, because other than that one track I really enjoyed this album a lot out of the many I heard last year. Overall rating: 7.2 (but 7.7 without my 0 included).

**ReallyCreative** (7.087): 7.1 - While this sub seems to believe this album is on the cutting edge of the future of music, I believe it is more likely to be the cutting edge of my migraines. Now, it's a good album, with some amazing songs, some strong attempts, and some that just... don't make sense. Maybe this is my awakening as a boomer but I just don't understand how some can view tracks like Warm and Blame It On Your Love so negatively and praise tracks like Click and 2099. I tried to view this album's more bizarre tracks through the same lens I look at one of my favorite artist's experimental era, Sufjan Stevens' Age of Adz and that did help a bit for some tracks. At the end of the day, I'm a fan of the tracks I love, but not the album as a whole

**hikkaru** (7.000): for how much I loved her 2017 mixtapes, this was kind of disappointing for me. for the most part it never really reaches the bombastic, energy-filled highs of those projects and feels stuck between wanting to be a marketable 2019 pop album and an experimental electronic work. the biggest problem for me I suppose is that a lot of the time it seems to rely too heavily on its production and the melodies and song progression feel quite static (which is a big pet peeve of mine in music).

**fadedblue09** (6.447): PC Music is a hit or miss for me, but I still gave it a try because I liked some PC-produced tracks in the past (Secret (Shh), Track 10). After hearing this, I guess it will stay that way :/ I don't hate all of them (Silver Cross is a bop!) but the more chaotic-sounding ones (like Click) were just too much for me. Also, I'm not a fan of having too many features. I understand that is what Charli envisions as an artist and I respect it, but I'm really more of a traditional, introverted kind of listener. Personal taste aside, the album is a great piece of forward-thinking pop music, and I totally understand why it has a following.

**Leixander** (6.433): The solo songs on this are among my least favorite Charli songs.

**kappyko** (5.333): i ended up being way nicer than expected

**Ghost-Quartet** (4.953): This is my least favorite album in the rate, but also weirdly the one with the least of what I‚Äôd consider ‚Äúfiller‚Äù because every song is either notably good or bad. I wish Charli would stop screwing around with her computer and just go back to making normal pop music! I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the hyper pop movement in general because a lot of the time it feels like their ethos is ‚Äúlet‚Äôs take a normal pop song and screw it up‚Äù and I don‚Äôt get why people would want that. This music is just‚Ä¶ challenging to listen to, and clearly there‚Äôs a market for that, but it‚Äôs very much not for me. There‚Äôs no delight at the center of these audio puzzles, just drugs and disappointment. Charli is a fantastic POP writer and when that manages to poke through the noise she really shines, but I still think she needs to refine her vision.

**bespectacIed** (4.700): True Romance and Pop 2 are some of the best pop albums ever recorded, in my opinion, so imagine how dumbfounded I am by how much I am disappointed with Charli. It's really not a disaster, there are a couple of songs in here I really enjoy. But it was a convoluted album full of attempts to do something new for the sake of doing something new, instead of just being a collection of well-made pop like Charli's past classics were. Charli the album just didn't click to me and that's literally the bare minimum because Pop 2 and True Romance literally changed how I listened to pop. I feel robbed, to this day, and I'm rating this album pissed.

**ImADudeDuh** (3.967): I already knew I would not like this album. I do not like Charli‚Äôs music outside of her most ‚Äúbasic‚Äù pop songs. These songs are just not pleasant to listen to imo. I didn‚Äôt want to sabotage, and there were some songs I was pleasantly surprised at, but as a whole, I will never listen to this willingly again. I hated it.

We have our winner! Congratulations to Caroline Polachek on her first rate win! While most of the top ten changed quite drasticly for most of the rate, the final battle was always going to be between So Hot and Gone. As I watched So Hot extend its lead over Gone I came to peace with it, mostly because of the gag of Gone not winning, we love a plot twist! I honestly never expected it to win over Gone but here we are! It's not hard to see why to be honest, it's a fantastic song, bouncy and whimsical which almost gained unanimous acclaim which Gone did not. The chorus is so infectious and catchy and it's absolutely one of Caroline's best songs. The bridge is one of the finer moments on the album, a crazy dance break that you can't help but lose yourself to. It's undoubtedly a worthy winner of this rate.

---

**Awkward\_King** (11): SHOW ME THE BANANA. god this is so fucking good, so fucking good so fucking good. one of the best pop songs i've ever heard lmao it's perfect, as is the video which i have shown to countless people

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): i have a huge crush on someone rn and this is such a MOOD also the melody is fantastic and that GASP!!!!! leading into the last chorus!!!!!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): I want to give my eleven to the winner this rate. While I think I actually like ‚ÄúOcean Of Tears‚Äù more than this, this gets the eleven because of how addictive this song is. She managed to make a song with more replay value than Carly Rae Jepsen and Charli XCX, mad props for that. I actually thought this song was kinda basic compared to the other pre-release singles when I first heard it but then the next thing I knew it was on repeat constantly. Plus it‚Äôs actually a pretty weird song? I guess I just wasn‚Äôt paying attention and this is my reparations.

**laurent1683** (11): How can a pop song contain so many interesting phases, motifs and melodies ? It's always stuck in my head and will be a staple for anything I create in the future

**leviswift13** (11): that's we call skinny legend stuff

**mudkip1** (11): pop perfection

**rickikardashian** (11): I've listened to this song so much I feel like I'm trying to make myself hate it. So far it isn't working

**shesdoingyoga** (11): I've listened to this song almost daily since I first heard it, every single part of this song is perfect, and I would also like to see the banana

**Sundraliz** (11): It was so hard to choose between this and No Drug Like Me for my 11. This song is truly capital A Amazing also I love the dance she does in the video. It's like potato chips I can't listen to it just once I gotta play it again two or three times.

**twat\_brained** (11): it was a cultural reset. /u/carolinepolachek I'll tell you what: I'll show you my banana if you agree to an interview with me when I get my hands on an Osheaga platinum pass. Deal? I have spent months trying to perfect Caroline's intro vocalization.

**1998tweety** (10): Mega bop. The lyrics bop, the chorus bops. The one bit I don't like is the bridge but I'll choose to ignore it cause Caroline needs a 10.

**akanewasright** (10): The perfect silly pop song.

**anothertown** (10): something fun, something for the summertime, something for the girls to you know, get ready and party to

**bandnitos** (10): it was a cultural reset

**bespectacIed** (10): THE best pop song of 2019. Nothing comes close. The best song in the rate and I am secretly rooting for this to win even though it's not my 11 and I would be fucking INCENSED if Gone beats this. If I only rated based on the quality of the song and not on emotional attachment, this would've gotten my 11. It's brilliant, perfectly produced, hilarious, sounds like nothing I've ever heard, tongue in cheek, ridiculously simple in its essence. I love how Caroline reminded us to stan Loona and always keep Loona's leader (who's currently on a hiatus to take care of her mental health) in our hearts and minds with the line "You know I live for the Haseul"

**cremeebrulee** (10): Okay I wasn't gonna give this a 10 because I do think it's a little overrated but listening to it again made me realize it's totally 10 worthy

**DaHumanTorch** (10): I GET A LITTLE LONEEEEELLLLYYYY...iconic song and video. love it sooo much. also the lyrics are so relatable, my feelings are hurt 24/7 by this type of thing

**fadedblue09** (10): Title was a bit wtf but I love this vintage dance-pop vibe. Definitely a standout. Edit: The video takes this to another level!

**hefellapart** (10): SHOW ME YOUR BANANA

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song is weird but wow it‚Äôs just so good once it grows on you.

**jexan13** (10): This is getting the 2nd place, isn't it? I really like this song, and... I don't realy know why. Like, it does not feel too complex nor grandiose, but it's just so good and catchy and poppy. In a perfect world this would have been #1 for 7 weeks.

**limpyjr** (10): The BREATHS!!! This song is a fucking jam.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is already very nice, very wonderful. The show me the banana lyric already makes this a classic. But that gasp right before the final chorus absolutely makes this song for me. It's just SO GOOD. It's the cherry on top. It's what wraps this song up in a neat little bow. It pushes it that extra mile.

**Nickl00** (10): More perfect pop

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): she did that

**racloves** (10): such a good tune

**ReallyCreative** (10): I don't know how some of these straight women can put certain emotions into songs and just completely nail it but yeah every hot guy HAS hurt my feelings and Caroline should speak on it

**sarcasticsobs** (10): if ‚ÄúGone‚Äù wasn‚Äôt in this rate, this would‚Äôve been my 11

**static\_int\_husp** (10): A fairly simple pop track, if we're being honest, but the thoughtful lyrics and interesting chorus make this track really special.

**thoeoe** (10): everyone is just going to make a "show me the banana" joke so I'll just bring up that I learned that it's called a Mondegreen when you mishear a phrase like that

**TinosCallingMeOver** (10): Once, is, always a banger.

**titi\_2001** (10): Amazing

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): What‚Äôs that one viral tweet about this song? CULTURAL RESET

**waluigiest** (10): This is for the gays. She got it 100%. This was one of my most-played songs in the last half of 2019.

**wavingwolves** (10): probably one of the best pop songs in recent years. it's just so fun and sassy

**worlds-okayest666** (10): I SAID SHOW ME THE FUCKING BANANA

**Xerop681** (10): i think of this song a lot, mainly the absolutely perfect vocals but also how the title is a mood.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (10): If y‚Äôall don‚Äôt put modern-day Persephone in the top 3 you have no taste

**Yatcho** (9.5): The Kate Bush vibes coming off the song and video... I fear

**Arybeck67** (9.3): this song was written about that cute boy you saw at a party that you wanted to hook up but ended not hooking up with cause you cockblocked yourself. Oh wait that‚Äôs just me? Well...it is üòü

**bulforster** (9.2): Coming for Hannah Diamond's gig

**Tedyonce** (9): Yet another contender for Song Title of the Year. show me ur banana etc

**yourfacesucksass** (8.8): This is the only song I've previously heard. Probably my more favorite track of the album, and yes it's the most upbeat song.....I'm trash I know.

**\_wailordfan** (8.5): I like Caroline because she gives me 'what if florence welch and Danielle Haim had a child and they did gay pop' and this song really embodies that for me.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): undeniable bop

**hikkaru** (8): this is a cute bop that I do like but I don't love it as much as a lot of other people seem to

**letsallpoo** (8): "geteredrameler close to me.....uradhaheoney one who knows me babe!"

**notceitn** (8): it's a bop but this sub honestly overhypes it ngl

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): -2 for dick jokes as a bridge

**vayyiqra** (8): This is definitely going to be in the top 3 at least, so why bother fighting it. The lyrics are kind of dumb, which is its only flaw, but it's an undeniable bop. It's inevitable.

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): who??????

**ElizabethDDoS** (3): I hate fun and I don't want this to win. Despite the heavy production of Caroline's vocals throughout the track, it manages to be the lowest common denominator song on the album. It's not even remotely catchy or memorable. The only things it's got going for it are the cute beat in the verses and... the lyrical sentiment, I guess.

skargardin: # Pang

---

**Overall Average**: 7.935 **// Average Controversy:** 1.590

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.343): such an entrancing album that manages to have classic Caroline vocals without feeling like another Chairlift album if that makes sense

**ReallyCreative** (8.986): 9 This was my first time going through the entire album at once and it was quite a treat. Caroline is capturing a new-age ethereal 90s sound and updating the production, lyricism, and general mood of these songs to 2019 standards. I'm getting Dido, I'm getting Imogen Heap, I'm getting Enya and I'm getting something new and something fresh on top of it. While there aren't a ton of slam dunk songs on this record, the consistency and strength of this album is truly outstanding. A few tracks may get a little repetitive, but there's something about Caroline that can take otherwise mundane, easy listening and turn it into something emotionally gripping. The way the tracks blend into each other (without dragging or becoming too "samey") is magnificent as well. There aren't as many power-hitters as on Dedicated, but the consistency of this album is something worth celebration.

**jexan13** (8.893): I went into this blind, without listening to any singles and... well, it was very good. This album could have been better, tho. Maybe a smaller tracklist; also, it may be too cohesive for my tastes. However, the highs of the album are just breathtaking. The vocals and production is witch-like. Among the best of 2019.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.857): My favorite of the three, it just feels the most... epic, if that makes sense.

**Leixander** (8.607): Best surprise of the year. Ashamed that I kinda dragged Door when it got released, it grew on me a lot.

**twat\_brained** (8.386): Slow at times but a phenomenal debut solo effort from Caroline. I tried to play CEP and Ramona Lisa but it felt a bit alien to me; I'll have to try those again. I'll definitely keep coming back to this masterpiece, mostly for So Hot and Ocean, but the cohesion is of a quality I rarely saw throughout 2019.

**YuhYuh\_YuhYuh** (8.379): I was not expecting this to be my highest scoring album of the rate, but it is. Pang is one of the most experimental and beautiful albums I have heard, but it still contains plenty of bangers. While I have not listened to it as much due to its relatively recent release date, it may soon become one of my all time favourites. Thank you Popheads for exposing me to these 3 incredible artists!

**bulforster** (8.336): This rate is a bit unfair to Caroline. I'm a basic gay so Carly and Charli are two of my faves and their albums have become like facts of life to me, whereas I'm listening to this for the first time for the rate so I don't think it's even possible for me to assess it the same way. That said this is an extremely well crafted album, if a little too moody to call it a favourite of mine.

**wavingwolves** (8.286): amazing. an annoyingly strong debut from an clearly experienced artist with amazing creative vision. all the songs feel so carefully crafted and thought-out and it's hard to actively dislike anything here. also, can we talk about how beautiful and well made the album and the single covers are? ugh. perfection.

**waluigiest** (8.214): I started listening to this album because of the hype on popheads, and for the first many times it all sort of blended together to me. There‚Äôs good and bad to that; Pang is a really cohesive, beautiful project, but a lot of the cuts don‚Äôt stand out within the album. That being said, when I slowed down I could really appreciate her stunning writing and orchestration and general sound building techniques. Nothing on this album is bad, and a lot of it is wonderful and unique.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.164): To be honest, this just wasn't my cup of tea. It was sort of hard for me to make it through. I think she has a very angelic voice and an identity that is authentically her and all her own. I can appreciate that. By no means do I think it's bad, it's just very clear to me that I don't fit with it.

**megm26** (8.000): the singles are great but the deep cuts could be better imo.

**akanewasright** (8.000): This very well might be the best album of the bunch. The songwriting is incredibly mature, the production is both experimental and absolutely gorgeous, she sounds amazing, it‚Äôs one of the most cohesive albums of 2019, and so on. But I don‚Äôt personally connect to it that much. So while I know it‚Äôs amazing and appreciate it, it‚Äôs not as personal to me as the other two.

**fadedblue09** (7.743): Wow, I'm actually impressed by this record. I feel like the album's biggest flaw is that it delves in too many different sounds and styles, but I guess that's expected for a debut record. That being said, I already prefer her means of experimentation to Charli's, as it highlights both her voice and production while being accessible. I loved the atmospheric vibe of the album, and her singing style has this eccentric charm reminding me of Bj√∂rk, and I wished the music reflected more of that. Will be looking forward to see what she has in store.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.193): I listened to this when it came out and couldn‚Äôt remember half the tracks so I was excited to revisit it for this rate because I was sure I was missing something but NOPE! Caroline is incredibly talented and has some amazing songs but her filler is the most filler in the rate. Most of the album tracks feel like sketches of songs that are going to be fleshed out later, it‚Äôs worth it to wade through them for the moments of brilliance but I wish she‚Äôd taken a few extra months to punch up this album a bit.

**bespectacIed** (6.786): Is there an album more perfectly named than Pang??? It's so genius imo. And accurate, because I experienced a range of strong emotions from this album --- from amazement to utter boredom to sadness to confusion. Pang is really a mixed bag: some of the most mindblowing pop songs I've ever heard buoyed by Caroline's insane vocals, mixed with a LOT of snoozers. I almost wished this album was an EP, but I can't deny Caroline's really one of the few girls who wanna move pop forward, and Pang's highs are so fucking high that you almost wanna forgive the lows.

**vayyiqra** (6.357): I feel like this is an album I want to like more than I do. It would be very on-brand for me given that I love art-pop, and I like Caroline's voice, but something about this just isn't hitting for me. I would say it's the most experimental of the albums in this rate, but not always for the better, and sometimes I wish she'd stop trying to be ~QuIrKy and just make a fun dance-pop song instead. Pop fans hyped her up so much, and to be cynical if she weren't on one (1) song on Pop 2 as well as a skinny white woman nobody would've cared about this album before it came out. (Yes I know Chairlift exists, I like them even, but I don't see much talk of them among pop fans.) All of this is not to say this is a bad album; it's not, and it has moments of genius. I just think it's kind of overrated and a few tracks are an L. Maybe I need to listen to it more, but for now, this rate ballot was made by Charli gang. Overall rating: 6.4

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.143): didn't she say the n word why isn't she donating to slayyyter's charities

**ImADudeDuh** (5.571): this whole album feels like its a translation of an album that was semi popular in france and had one song become a meme in america so her label forced her to make the whole album in English to capitalize on it and this is not a compliment.

**hikkaru** (5.429): unfortunately this album just isn't really for me, I appreciate it for what it's going for but for the most part it's not really the type of music I spend a lot of time listening to and ultimately feels a bit boring to me.
