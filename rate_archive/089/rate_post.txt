**Carly Rae Jepsen - Dedicated**

After becoming a critically acclaimed pop darling with her previous third studio album "Emotion" and its companion piece, "EMOTION SIDE B", expectations were insanely high for Carly's next project. After a few years of dropping a couple of standalone singles and some collaborations, the album's lead single was finally released November 1st, 2018, namely "Party For One". A couple of more pre-release singles, such as "Now That I Found You" and "Julien" followed in the coming months, and on May 17th, the album Dedicated was finally released. It's safe to say that this was one of the biggest pop releases of last year as far as this sub's interests go and it did not disappoint. The album saw Carly do what she does best and has become known for, delivering catchy throwback-influenced pop bangers for days.

**Charli XCX - Charli**

Similar to Dedicated, the wait for Charli's third studio album had been long and arduous. That's not to say that her output hadn't been consistent the years following her last album, Sucker. She continued to release singles and even two mixtapes, Number 1 Angel and the acclaimed Pop 2. Last year she finally revealed her third, self-titled studio album, Charli,  which was released on September 13th. The album featured the previously released singles "1999" featuring Troye Sivan, "Blame It On Your Love" feat. Lizzo and "Gone" feat. Christine and the Queens, just to name a few. The album saw Charli fuse experimental maximalist pop with more mainstream radio-friendly elements to create a wide variety of pop songs. If you're a fan of pop music, you'll no doubt find something to enjoy on Charli.

**Caroline Polachek - Pang**

Caroline Polachek, formerly a member of synthpop band Chairlift, quickly rose to one of the sub's favorite newcomers last year. She had previously appeared most prominently as a solo artist on Charli XCX's Pop 2 cut "Tears", while also having a couple of songwriting credits for artists such as Beyoncé ("No Angel") and Tommy Cash ("X-RAY"). Led by singles such as "So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings" and "Door" among others, Caroline amassed a plethora of new fans in a surprisingly short amount of time last year with her striking visuals and intriguing productions. Her debut album, Pang, was released on October 18th. The album is a dreamy, electro / art-pop album which proves Caroline as a true force to be reckoned with within pop music.

##The Rules

Now this is the most important part so make sure to read these carefully!

- Listen to every song listed and give it a score between one (1) and ten (10). You can use up to one decimal place (5.5, 5.3 etc.). 
Ballots with songs who are missing scores won't be counted!

- You may give one song a zero (0) and one song an eleven (11) across the entire rate. These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track. You are NOT required to leave a comment for these songs, but it is encouraged.

- To make it easier for both me, the host, and yall, **[PLEASE USE THIS LINK TO FILL IN YOUR SCORES](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=skargardin&subject=2019%20Ultimate%20AMA%20Queens&message=Username%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Dedicated%0A%0AJulien%3A%0A%0ANo%20Drug%20Like%20Me%3A%0A%0ANow%20That%20I%20Found%20You%3A%0A%0AWant%20You%20In%20My%20Room%3A%0A%0AEverything%20He%20Needs%3A%0A%0AHappy%20Not%20Knowing%3A%0A%0AI%27ll%20Be%20Your%20Girl%3A%0A%0AToo%20Much%3A%0A%0AThe%20Sound%3A%0A%0AAutomatically%20In%20Love%3A%0A%0AFeels%20Right%20ft.%20Electric%20Guest%3A%0A%0ARight%20Words%20Wrong%20Time%3A%0A%0AReal%20Love%3A%0A%0AFor%20Sure%3A%0A%0AParty%20For%20One%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Charli%0A%0ANext%20Level%20Charli%3A%0A%0AGone%20ft.%20Christine%20and%20the%20Queens%3A%0A%0ACross%20You%20Out%20ft.%20Sky%20Ferreira%3A%0A%0A1999%20ft.%20Troye%20Sivan%3A%0A%0AClick%20ft.%20Kim%20Petras%20and%20Tommy%20Cash%3A%0A%0AWarm%20ft.%20HAIM%3A%0A%0AThoughts%3A%20%0A%0ABlame%20It%20On%20Your%20Love%20ft.%20Lizzo%3A%0A%0AWhite%20Mercedes%3A%0A%0ASilver%20Cross%3A%0A%0AI%20Don%27t%20Wanna%20Know%3A%0A%0AOfficial%3A%0A%0AShake%20it%20ft.%20Big%20Freedia%2C%20CupcakKe%2C%20Brooke%20Candy%20and%20Pabllo%20Vittar%3A%0A%0AFebruary%202017%20ft.%20Clairo%20and%20Yaeji%3A%0A%0A2099%20ft.%20Troye%20Sivan%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Pang%0A%0AThe%20Gate%3A%0A%0APang%3A%0A%0ANew%20Normal%3A%0A%0AHit%20Me%20Where%20It%20Hurts%3A%0A%0AI%20Give%20Up%3A%0A%0ALook%20At%20Me%20Now%3A%0A%0AInsomnia%3A%0A%0AOcean%20of%20Tears%3A%0A%0AHey%20Big%20Eyes%3A%0A%0AGo%20As%20a%20Dream%3A%0A%0ACaroline%20Shut%20Up%3A%0A%0ASo%20Hot%20You%27re%20Hurting%20My%20Feelings%3A%0A%0ADoor%3A%0A%0AParachute%3A%0A%0AEND)**

- Feel free to PM me on Reddit or Discord if you'd like to change any of your scores.

- If I suspect that you are willfully sabotaging with your ballot, I reserve the right to discard it.

- You can also add comments to any song! Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space! Same if you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!

**The following format is the only acceptable format for song comments:**

> Feels Right ft. Electric Guest: 11 Giving this an 11 felt right

Any of the following formats are INCORRECT:

> Cross You Out: I'd like to cross THIS one out by giving it a 1.

> I Give Up: 1: I Give Up on this album

> Automatically In Love: (1) Automatically a one
