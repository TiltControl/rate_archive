The r/Popheads Winners Rate III
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/xvninp/the_rpopheads_winners_rate_iii/

**EDIT:** The deadline to submit scores for the winners rate is by the end of this Sunday, the 6th! If you need a 24-hour extension, your best option is to either message this account or ask the hosts on Discord. That said, my time zone/working hours are a bit wacky so if you send in without an extension some time on the Monday, we'll take you in. Get cracking!

Welcome, to each and every one of you future winners of my heart. Once again, it's time for dreams to be shattered as your fave gets kicked out on day one. Once again, it's time for men to face a ridiculous uphill battle to not be recognized as a flop gender. Once again, it's time for keyboards to be smashed as rate regulars who should definitely know better by now will declare these results atrocious and the taste of the sub disgusting. And once again, it's time for a single track to be canonized to join our deity Britney Spears and benevolent overlord Janelle Monáe to complete the r/popheads holy trinity. It's time to kick off Winners Rate Number 3!

It is the pleasure of all pleasures for myself (u/camerinian) and my co-host/shitposter-in-chief u/CrimsonROSET to be guiding you through the gauntlet of the 50 legendary songs that reigned supreme over the last 50 legendary rates. Don't ask where **insert VGI winner here** is, it's a long story. Our range of triumphant songs is another diverse selection from every faction of pop music, from universally beloved club bangers to indie girl favourites you're definitely not cool enough to be listening to, from music your dad probably loved to music your future children will definitely think is cringe. Records will be put on, cats will be harmonising, criminals will come in both regular and smooth varieties, and you will ask yourself, "well, how did I get here?"

Here are the songs that will duke it out for the title of Queen of All Queens (be sure to do Drag Rate too!)

Rules

* You must listen to and rate **EVERY** song in this rate. Your ballot will not be accepted if there are gaps, our rating program literally won’t allow it.
* Each song can receive a score between 1 and 10, and decimal points up to 1 place are allowed (e.g. 5.6, 7.3, 9.9 - NOT 5.62 or 9.99).
* You may give a score of 0 to one song only and a score of 11 to one song only. These should go to your very favourite and very least favourite songs. It’s not mandatory to assign these scores, so if you don’t want your choice of 11 or 0 to haunt you forever in the Discord channel, that’s totally acceptable.
* You are highly encouraged to also provide comments for the songs as well as scores, simply by writing whatever you desire directly after your score. Comments are not mandatory, and you can put them on as many or as few songs as you like, so long as you follow the correct formatting as labelled below.
* You can edit your scores and comments at any time up until the final cutoff date. Best way to do it is by messaging this account on Reddit, but if you message me[ u/camerinian](https://www.reddit.com/u/camerinian/) or u/CrimsonROSET either here or on Discord we can sort it for you.
* There is exactly one correct way to format your comment, and it is as below.

>King Kunta: 8 The Yam is the common name for some plant species in the genus *Dioscorea* (family Dioscoreaceae) that form edible tubers

* This is how NOT to properly format a comment:

>Immaterial: 7.494572: I can give any score I want.  
>  
>Take a Hint: Take my 6.  
>  
>S&M: (1) ugh yes sabotage me harder daddy

* The Winners and All Stars rates are always some of the bigger and more anticipated events that occur on the sub, so for everyone’s sake, do not send in ballots that are clearly designed just to troll the rate. We know everyone will have their hot takes and some level of atrocious taste is always expected, but we can tell when a ballot exists purely as bait and we reserve the right to reject it if we think it only serves to undermine scores. If you think you’re prone to contrarian takes, your comments will go a long way to ensure you’re not thrown out with the bullshit.

If you're having any issues with this link, you can use the contents of [this pastebin](https://pastebin.com/8CDyvuR8) and copy them over to a Reddit message to this account, u/WinnersRate3.

Our tentative deadline will be **Sunday, November 6th**, for a reveal the following weekend. This is subject to change, so we will keep you posted.

You've gotta make a decision: rate tonight or live and die this way.
