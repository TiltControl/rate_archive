**camerinian** (9): Poor Hannah never stood a chance here, even excluding the inherent nerf that comes with being hyperpop. This was last place for most of the rate and it was ultimately by a pretty significant margin (40 points Jesus). I still love this song, mostly because it feels like an adventure every time I hear it.

Also we can discourse about correct and robbed winners all we want, but the reality is if I had submitted my ballot for the hyperpop rate in time, I would have 11d Stupid Horse, and ergo I may have had to 11 Stupid Horse in my own winners rate. I'm glad the optics favored me this time.

**CrimsonROSET** (4): I think this is the only song that I wasn’t at least somewhat aware of before hosting the rate, and I was liking it until the song remembered it was hyperpop, and I wish it hadn’t! It was really lovely, and I think the effects decrease from the quality of the vocals and the lyrics, so I’m kinda disappointed!

Funnily enough, this hit the #1 spot at some point which was some of the funniest things in this rate, but as seen, that didn't last. I'm happy that people appreciate this song for what it is!

## Hannah Diamond

**MassiveThief** (11): honestly feels like the ultimate culmination of PC music. Not the artsy club side, but the pure euphoria of AG Cook production and ultra digital vocals

**akanewasright** (10): if this survives past the bottom spot I’ll call that a victory

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Wait people kept bringing this up as a potential first out but this is a mega slay????

**DirtyRat583** (10): this is the antithesis to hyperpop (5 minutes long) and yet its so much better than most of the genre like maybe long songs are good

**monalisafrank** (10): so cinematic. scratches my brain in just the right way.

**plastichaxan** (10): The first 11 win I ever noticed!! I don’t care if this is bottom 5 I stand by this being one of the best winners/songs in this rate

**RandomHypnotica** (10): tbh i don't love this as much as some people but it's gonna be punished unfairly no matter what so

**reput4tionera** (10): one of the only artists i would pay $21 in shipping for to get a vinyl. also my reflections vinyl came with 10 24x24 posters i feel like there has to be someone out there who has every poster on their wall (i have 2 up)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): My first 11 win and my first 11 that made a difference, iirc. I stand by it! A hauntingly beautiful slice of hyperpop-meets-trance.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): This doesn't stand a got dang chance :(

**TiltControls** (10): I'm sure that this is going to end up in the bottom here (or close to it), but Hannah was by far my favourite in the hyperpop rate and while I had no expectations for this to win I'm so glad she managed to pull it off. I absolutely love how stripped back the start of the song is, so that when it does explode it feels amazing.

**vayyiqra** (10): Ironically this may be my least favourite track on Reflections because it pulls you out of the calm and pleasant nighttime mood that album has, but yeah it goes pretty hard. Also it defeated my nemesis, the cursed lizard band, so there's that going for it

**imbaby122** (9.7): hannah my little meow meow i fear no one is gonna understand you like i do <3 u r perfect and u don’t deserve day 1.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): prior to this I only knew Hannah Diamond from the Vroom Vroom song I don't like but this is so good. also I heard silent shout which means vote Nocturonica (name tbd)

**1998tweety** (8): this kinda devoured

**bogo** (8): listening to this and i'm shocked this actually won, it's really out there for a rate winner on popheads lol but it's a good one

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): this is a v good song but i still cant believe this won that rate... kind of iconic for that

**jasannn** (8): carmeldansen type of beat

**PhloxInvar** (8): This shit was fucking crazy. I'm impressed.

**qazz23** (8): takes a while to get going, love the drop halfway through

**runaway3212** (8): did this deserve to win?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): cant wait to see this song make bottom 1

**pig-serpent** (7.9): This was my favorite Hannah Diamond song for a while, and while it’s still pretty good (and we love an unexpected winner) I’d take any gecs song or the best Slayyyter or Dorian Electra songs over it.

**jman457** (7.7): I liked the beginning more, but still very ethereal and beautiful

**WaneLosertoc** (7.5): i think this broad was like a TMT star? i think she existed just for the site to have a pop star to hype up. seems chill. she was one of the last interviews the site did. [https://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/hannah-diamond](https://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/hannah-diamond)

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (7): I don't think everything she's doing here works, but I'd prefer a riskier idea that doesn't pan out over a play it safe approach. This at least has guts.

WinnersRate3: ## Hannah… Tin, I guess, idk I didn’t do science

  
**anothertown** (6): it's crazy how it took me like 2 years only to grow out of pc music

  
**fadedblue09** (6): I can see why it won but at the same time….really? If a cover of a Eurodance song is the winner of a hyperpop rate then I'm afraid it doesn't encourage me to explore the genre

  
**ricki** (6): 2009 unregistered hypercam 2 notepad tutorials would have loved this song had it been out at the time

  
**Stryxen** (6): not feeling her

  
**welcome2thejam** (6): A tale of two halves

  
**Verboten_Prince** (5.2): Why is this so long

  
**jsonphile** (5): parts of this song I really like, other parts I really don’t so I guess it averages to 5

  
**shhhneak** (4.5): Whoopi voice Okay.

  
**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Hannah deserves more credit for being one of the early faces of the hyperpop scene but I’m still befuddled that this is a rate winner because I hated this album! I found it so empty sounding, like yeah there were weird noises but they were all so thin and pointless the songs. The music was just… watery soup. But this is one of the better songs at least, it has the good sense to keep throwing out tricks to compensate for the lack of substance and it stumbles across nice moments every now and then.

  
**hikk** (4): my impatient ass can not sit through all of this just for that 20 second outro

  
**NotWith10000Men** (4): the first half is beautiful. the rest... idk what to do with it. especially the very end. martina mcbride outsold

  
**Uberpigeon** (4): this rate was before my time but its so puzzling to me why this song won?? like .. how is this better than fade away

  
**starla_** (3.5): I normally enjoy this type of stuff but this is not it sorry

  
**BasedButta** (3): no

  
**just_thonking** (3): Hyperpop but make it boring

  
**throwaway-7650** (2.5): what is allie X doing here in winners 3

  
**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (2): this feels like an addison rae track but if all the slay were taken out…

  
**Awkward_King** (1.5): this winning over 1000 gecs and slayyyter is a little stomach churning i cant lie

  
**bulforster** (1): (#49) I hate to contribute to hyperpophobia but this is painfully boring until the awful drop, which I say as someone who's normally a fan of AG's work.

  
**cremeebrulee** (1): gecs would've won with my ballot

  
**dream_fighter2018** (1): I’m sorry but this is boring lol

  
**frogaranaman** (1): What an absolute mess of a rate for such a boring, uninteresting winner.

  
**GapeCod** (1): First out alert?

  
**ImADudeDuh** (1): first half: a boring kingdom hearts song that fails to sound grandiose. Second half: friday night funkin mod

  
**moonagenightmares** (1): lol?

  
**nick1372** (1): It's giving oonts oonts and nothing else. isn't hyperpop supposed to be futuristic? This sounds like a terrible remix i'd hear at a gay club in 2013

  
**OliviaGodrigo** (1): This is unlistenable

  
**Roxieloxie** (1): I didnt do this rate but i remember I popped into plug for the top 5 long enough to hear the ringtone remix and to see some song named 'stupid horse' lost and it was divisive. I also know people have been threatning that this would be their lowest score for almost 2 years now, and hearing it now,,, yeah they were right this song fucking sucks can we go back in time so that gecs didnt get that 1 average so stupid horse could've won

  
**ignitethephoenix** (0): this has to be one of the worse winners of all time I’m sorry. I hate how emotional the lyrics are and how it doesn’t match up with the style, especially in the second half of the song. And on top of that it also drags.

  
**impla77** (0): choruses become more and more discombobulated

  
**MoonlightByWindow** (0): this song is really nothing, so goddamn boring until the last 20 seconds which are like…why

— **CrimsonROSET** (8): BEFORE I PUNCH YOU IN THE (HEY!) Yes this show was really weird and a LOT of the behind the scenes things that came out about it make me irk up inside, but to the surprise of many, a show about kids singing made a good song! I can't make it not bop, this is just so filled with personality and you can't deny their chemistry.

Of course I don't think this ever really had a chance, but I'm happy it at least managed to dodge the straight-up bottom spot. I don't think any song from LADN would have done well here, but for any chosen, I'm happy we went with this.

**camerinian** (5): is this camp? Yes! Is it a bop? Marginally! Is it produced like total ass? Yes! Would it be better if it didn't have to bend over to be sanitized for under-12s? Yes! Do I lack any connection with this show because of arbitrary generational boundaries and thus I'm probably missing loads of context? Yes! —

## Has a great pair of HEY

**1998tweety** (10): iconic 2 queens slaying serving pvssy and cvnt

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): ZeFraud.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is gonna get done so dirty by the “no fun” crowd, isn’t it?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I understand that this is first out but it does not deserve it.

**Inner-Language8833** (10): This is a masterclass in how to write and perform a duet and I'm not kidding. Liz Gilles coming in with the tone and Victoria has some great harmonies

**moonagenightmares** (10): why does this kinda slay. the lyric video that shows up when you search this on youtube looking so outdated made me bump it up to a 10

**musical\_pyn** (10): justice for victoria justice!! how many times do I need to say it!! also a perfect pop-rock song, who cares if it's from a nickelodeon show

**PhloxInvar** (10): I know this song is going out early, but like this shit slaps and is way better than a majority of the songs in this rate. No sarcasm here.

**plastichaxan** (10): This was a moment I'm sorry it did deserve to win

**RandomHypnotica** (10): BUT IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO BITE ME IN THE

**reput4tionera** (10): child me was obsessed w this

**sufjancaesar** (10): Hard

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): giving this a 10 solely because it saved us from a High School Musical win. not that I’d give a bad score otherwise, but I wanted to annoy HSM fans

**throwaway-7650** (10): PLEASE RISE FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): men have ceased to exist

**dream\_fighter2018** (9): yes, I’m giving a nine to a song from a Nickelodeon show. I have brain worms because I genuinely think this is great.

**imbaby122** (9): this is a nickelodeon song. it has no business being this good. it’s actually kind of offensive.

**MassiveThief** (8.5): brain rot means I can only genuinely enjoy the nightcore version (shoutout osu!) but yeah this bangs

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): this, bet on it, and i don’t dance = greatest top 3 in rate history?

**DefaultPophead** (8): At ya what?

**ricki** (8): this goes viral on twitter on a monthly basis, it deserved its win

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): my brother used to listen to the nightcore version of this when he was 12. if your song is getting outsold by a nightcore version you just be plain embarrassed tbh

**jasannn** (7.5): Victoria Justice's gotta take a hint and turn her mic down

**nick1372** (7.5): Great in all the ways Disney songs should be!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.3): nostalgic

**jman457** (7): This is what Meghan Trainor thought she was doing with No

**pig-serpent** (7): There’s a cap to how good the Victorious “We Have Dr. Luke production at home” songs can be and this is pretty much hitting it.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): It’s still a good pop song but I was rooting for Bet on It tbh and I have no nostalgia for Victorious

**thedoctordances1940** (7): as much as i did not care for this rate, this was quite fun and a good winner

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): "Rate Winner Victoria Justice" will never not be funny

**welcome2thejam** (7): There's a world where this was made by someone that isn't Nickelodeon & it's a smasha for the ages, but I guess we must accept the things we can't change

**impla77** (6.4): a surprising bop

## Could use a mint

**itsabop** (6): There were so many better songs in disney rate

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): You can tell they had to tone down the lyrics for the Nickelodeon market

**qazz23** (6): decent pop rock, this probably won't be so victorious

**Uberpigeon** (6): omfg i was listening blind and i thought this was a kesha song

**TiltControls** (5.2): Maybe it's cause the only shows from the rate I watched were That's So Raven, Hannah Montana, Lizzie McGuire and iCarly, but I had no idea this song was so well liked. That said, I can see the appeal of it. It's brash, upbeat, and involves a pretty fun verbal smackdown. Without any nostalgia I don't really know if this is doing much for me though.

**bespectacIed** (5): how did this win comment number 216711. When determinate and he could be the one were in this rate!!!?!

**monalisafrank** (5): they can sang but this is cringe

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): Which Victoria Justice stan is going to delete their account this time

**WaneLosertoc** (5): this rate seemed like trial by fire. centrisim: the song won here folks and you all should be disappointed.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): whatever

**ignitethephoenix** (4): justice for Zac Efron

**vayyiqra** (4): Lmao this again. It's dumb but I kind of like it because it cracks me up ... wait nevermind the longer it went on the more tired of it I got

**anothertown** (3): music to get a lobotomy to

**Awkward\_King** (3): good but it SHOULD be bet on it

**jsonphile** (3): this sounds like 3OH!3 wrote a song for reputation era Taylor Swift while sampling we are number one

**runaway3212** (3): yeah no sorry

**sarcasticsobs** (3): Past my time. Not a fan of the production on this. Don't really like Victoria's voice either, I think.

**bulforster** (2): (#43) Will we definitively say nick > disney when this doesn't place last or is there a user who cares enough about victoria justice to keep the scoreboard even if it does by selegending?

**NotWith10000Men** (2): i have to get back into doing rates bc this is unacceptable

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (1.5): Thank the most gregarious and merciful Satan that this was two minutes and thirty seconds. Production wise it's not really that bad but holy fuck these lyrics. This is a song for girls in middle school who had a boyfriend for two weeks and the grand total of their interaction was a few texts and saying "hi" by the lockers and when that stopped it was an earth shattering betrayal.

**cremeebrulee** (1): bad

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (1): rotten show, rotten song

**shhhneak** (1): sneak

**akanewasright** (0): oh lord… my overall complaint with victorious songs in this rate was that they, like the show, made me feel VERY uncomfortable for the actors, like these songs do not feel like songs or lyrics that minors (in-universe or in real life) should be singing about, especially when they were all written and chosen by adults. It feels exploitative as hell, especially given what we know about Dan Schneider. I gave this song a pass initially because it’s just fun enough that I could overlook it but… after it won, it kinda dawned on me that this was among the worst of them in that regard. Like I’m sorry, no child should be singing about someone buying them a drink or “I think that that we should hook up”. This is just fucking gross.

**starla\_** (0): no thank youuuu

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I stand by this 11! Completely ignoring the video, I still think that this song is extremely sweet and such a good ballad, especially coming from a group I have other feelings about that are not usually of ‘sweet’ or ‘good’! The video- isn't great, no, but I can just listen to it on spotify or something! Y/N was a really underrated rate I think, even if people shit on it- it's affectionate, I find.

**camerinian** (8): 8 This song is adorable! I honestly struggle to understand the more negative takes for this. Like yeah, it’s a ballad done in a very typical style for the boybands of this era, and it’s obviously a Simon Cowell product, but like, I love the lowkey charm and the immaculate melody. I’m not too surprised that it couldn’t really escape that bottom five at all throughout the rate, but damn I was a bit bummed to see it do so poorly. It’s cute, even if cute doesn’t tend to get you far in these sorts of rates.

## Got to go out for dinner with Zayn


**MoonlightByWindow** (11): ONE DIRECTION WE NEED YOU BACK NOW MORE THAN EVER. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO “HIATUS” ACTUALLY MEANING SOMETHING

**1998tweety** (10): their The "POV: You're on a date with One Direction" MV is such a classic, they really knew how to get the girls and gays going.

**anothertown** (10): :chihuahua: :spaghetti:

**bogo** (10): surprise bitches, this song grew on me. yeah i was way too harsh on this initially, this is honestly a really heartfelt and touching song about growing up and getting older and i really should've realized that sooner. it's like the modern version of night moves

**emayzee** (10): that key change has SSRI-like effects on my brain chemistry

**frogaranaman** (10): I cry to this song often

**GapeCod** (10): This should have been No Control so I wouldn't have to give a Harry-led song a 10 smh.

**Hulnia** (10): omg it’s their only good song ❤️

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this isn’t fireproof but I got to support the boys

**ImADudeDuh** (10): tumblr y/n music has never sounded so good

**moonagenightmares** (10): i wrote "their best lead single" but apparently it wasnt the lead lmao

**pig-serpent** (10): Still amazed at how much I love this song. Sometimes the obvious winner is the correct one.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): relistening to one direction with my roommates is the only thing getting me through this semester rn

**ricki** (10): why did they have to be in this rate? hasnt everyone involved in y/n’s favorite boy bands rate suffered enough?

**Roxieloxie** (10): No because the way as soon as this rate ended all of yall came out of the fucking woodwork to be like 'im gonna tank this in winners 3 :// no control deserved more :///' like ????? maybe you all should've shown that in the rate??? Anyway I wish this was no control or fireproof, the fact that theres 1D in a rate and its not my instant 11 is fucked up and evil

**static_int_husp** (10): I know this will be robbed but it's good so have a 10

**throwaway-7650** (10): maybe I'm not bitter over no control losing

**TiltControls** (10): I'm still baffled a slow track like this managed to beat out both No Control and Fireproof. But given that this was my 11 and a song I have wayyyy too many plays of I'm not complaining! The boys really shine on the vocals here, and while the song itself doesn't do too much special - it inspires a feeling of warmth within me anytime I listen to it. I have little doubt this'll be day 1, but I'm just glad it made it here in the first place.

**WaneLosertoc** (10): this can have a 10 because roxieloxie enjoys it. roxieloxie and i usually disagree on most music (roxie gets scared of long songs tbh and is scared of scary noises understandably), but I will defend their support of 1D. the boys tried very hard.

**Saison_Marguerite** (9.5): I should have 11d No Control but I’m still going to defend this song. I was the opposite of a Directioner going into this rate, now I must admit they have some jams

**akanewasright** (9): this song didn’t deserve to win… but it does make me 🥹like damn maybe even when the night changes, it’ll never change me and you

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I know people were mad this won, but you at least have to respect a song overcoming balladphobia to win. That hardly ever happens.

**dream_fighter2018** (9): I listened to this for the first time since y/n scoring this and thought briefly for a second that this “sounds like Lucy Dacus’s Hot & Heavy”.

**runaway3212** (9): this has such an emotional grip over me

**welcome2thejam** (9): A song worthy of pages upon pages of fanfic

**jasannn** (8.5): nostalgia got me crying

**musical_pyn** (8.5): nostalgia is a very, very powerful force

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): ugh FINEEE you can have this one harry

**imbaby122** (8.4): i can see why teenage girls rode so hard for these guys bc this song is so powerful for no reason 😭

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): i should give this song a better score since it's gonna flop but honestly it just reminds me of a person i would rather not think about rn

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Had to skip this because it triggers the PTSD I acquired from being a Vamps fan during this rate but from what I remember it’s very pretty

**nick1372** (8): My favorite thing about this music video is Liam taking the selfie with the rear iPhone camera. Louis experiencing police bruitality firsthand is good too though.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): they lowkey have genuinely good songs

**starla_** (8): it's embarrassing how much I love this song, but I guess the rest of popheads feels the same

**vayyiqra** (8): At first I thought "this is such an early-2010s pop ballad (derogatory)" but then that changed to (complimentary)

**shhhneak** (7.6): Honestly loses a few points for not being the slowed + reverb version.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): not all 11s are created equal oop

**DefaultPophead** (7): I think I read this one on Wattpad in the eighth grade!

**monalisafrank** (7): I am like six years too old to be attached to 1D. But this is one I like, the melody is lovely and the chorus lyrics are too (verses could be improved imo).

**Verboten_Prince** (6.6): You ever introduce yourself to a new fandom or subculture and realize you have no idea what the fuck is going on? That was me doing this rate

**jsonphile** (6.5): it’s a cute song, and one of this band’s best songs. But it’s going out bottom five let’s be real it has no chance against this competition

**sarcasticsobs** (6.5): After my time and didn't click. Seems sweet though. I like Zayn's voice.

**seanderlust** (6.5): someday i will hear the start of this and not think it's SOPHIE. that day is not today

WinnersRate3: ## Liam spewed in their hat

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): changing my name to Y/N the moment i hear this song

**Inner-Language8833** (6): I'm not getting the song so it's adequate I guess, great harmonies as always

**itsabop** (6): My confession is that back in the day I was a directioner but refused to admit it

**reput4tionera** (6): my gay little self was into one direction until like 2013 then i moved on

**hikk** (5.5): no control my poor little meow meow

**jman457** (5.2): Am i the only one who gets Ed sheeren covering “its ok to cry”

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): Every time the song's chorus happens all I can think about is how similar it is to David Bowie's "Changes"

**thedoctordances1940** (3): yeah i didn't even give this a good score in y/n and I did give out a few good scores so i don't like it as a song or a winner but i can't say i lost any sleep over it either

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): day 1 direction

**Uberpigeon** (3): this night change makes me hot in the face, harry styles in my pulsing veins

**impla77** (2.7): is this the video where they’re trespassing on frozen people

**Awkward_King** (2): im sorry roxie please everyone do 3mo to show roxie how sorry i am

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): changing the song zzzzzz

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (2): Lifeless. Did a human make this? I'm not convinced. It's like a parody someone would make to make fun of this kind of music.

**bulforster** (1.6): (#45) How far can the fact it's all five of them boost this over Niall's placement last time?

**bespectacIed** (1): So flavorless. This corny as shit song winning over a mitski-approved bop, very wrong

**plastichaxan** (1): What drives me crazy kinda is listening to them sorry

**RandomHypnotica** (1): this is only not a 0 for roxie's sake

**Stryxen** (1): I miss when I thought this was good

**just_thonking** (0): Campfire ass song

**MassiveThief** (0): If 1D has a million haters, I'm one of them.. If 1D has ten haters, I'm one of them.. If 1D has only one hater, that's ME. If 1D doesn't have any haters, it means that I'm not alive anymore.. If the World is against 1D, I am the World.

**nootnoot781** (0): this won over stockholm syndrome and no control? genuinely a laugh at loud moment.

Honestly, the Break-Up Pop-Rock rate is such an enigma to me despite hosting it. Even though the albums all received a decent amount of hype upon their releases, I don't think they've had particularly strong staying power in our collective consciousness. In the previous All-Stars rate we saw all three of the included songs flop horribly, with the rate as a whole being the only one to be completely eliminated before the end of Day 1. I fear that Midnight Sky will suffer a similar fate here, because it simply just isn't really to the taste of the general rater community. When I was hosting this rate I was vehemently rooting against Midnight Sky, because I thought (and still do think) that it would be an extremely boring winner. Don't get me wrong, I do like it a lot, but it wasn't like Blinding Lights or something where, yeah, it was a predictable winner, but it was 100% deserved. And I think a lot of the raterbase shared that sentiment as well. There's really tough competition in this rate, so a well-executed synthpop song probably won't cut it, and I fully expect this to be out Day 1. - u/hikkaru
---
**camerinian** (6.5) 6.5 Can't say I'm too surprised this never caught steam. Even just in this rate, there's a lot to choose from if you want 80s pastiche. It only barely ever scraped its way out of the bottom 5, and it had no chance of escaping day one. The song is a disco bop, just not a particularly inspiring one, and amongst a legion of winners that doesn't really pay

**CrimsonROSET** (0): I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. I really enjoyed two albums from break up pop rock! I still think it's a really solid rate- but clearly my tastes did not align with the general raterbase with what was best there. Maybe it's because I never liked Edge of Seventeen, but this was dated on arrival, so to see wide acclaim for it and for it to go on to win the rate overall- I've been running the 0 campaign for it basically since it won, so I'm more than pleased to see this in the bottom 5.

## Can’t keep you off my mind, off my mind

**1998tweety** (10): this wasnt her biggest hit, why?

**anothertown** (10): see you space cowboy..

**bespectacIed** (10): A motherfcking moment. Time stood still, everything was right, Miley was the greatest artist on the planet for like a week

**DirtyRat583** (10): i need 50 kilos of whatever miley put in this song

**ignitethephoenix** (10): she ate here idc!

**ricki** (10): I moisturize my face each morning using the tears of halsey stans that thought she had a chance at winning this rate x

**sufjancaesar** (10): The Plastic Hearts era has only grown on me and this track is Miley’s magnum opus imo

**throwaway-7650** (10): edge of midnight/edge of seventeen remix pls

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): my favorite from the album

**WaneLosertoc** (9.4): miley needs 2 get back into weed bc there were ideas and she was rlly close to making a stoner masterpiece. i think more pop stars need to make stoner masterpieces it helps move the culture forward

**imbaby122** (9.1): deserved smash hit status!!!

**BasedButta** (9): by the books pop - it’s great

**bigbigbee** (9): I have complicated feelings about Miley Cyrus’s journey as a pop star, and part of those complicated feelings are how much my opinion of her shifted (for the better) after the released this (IMO, excellent) song

**hikk** (9): as the host of this rate...... it's honestly such an enigma idk......

**ImADudeDuh** (9): glad she enjoyed this last taste of the top 20 for a week

**itsabop** (9): Underrated outside of popheads it's a real shame

**jsonphile** (9): I’m so glad Miley finally figured out what she does best

**monalisafrank** (9): I love rock Miley but this isn’t the one from this album I would have chosen so it’s not my 10 here. I love her growl here, and the Stevie sample, and the lyrics. Miley is such a stereotypical Sag and this is the most Sagittarius song I’ve ever heard. I feel like it’s a touch overproduced in places and they could have gone rawer.

**runaway3212** (9): this is gonna get tanked to hell and back so lemme just say I think this is a very deserved winner in the rate it was in

**Saison_Marguerite** (9): This was the smasha at the time but it’s grown off me a bit, it’s very 2020

**Inner-Language8833** (8.5): That's mother

**jman457** (8.5): I love this by itself, but if it was the Stevie Nicks remix it might have been an 11

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): It’s very good but it just isn’t hitting quite the same these days.

**plastichaxan** (8): I cannot live a lie this is a good song and a good winner

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): The Edge of Midnight remix is a 9

**qazz23** (8): I like the disco feel of this

**starla_** (8): Edge of Midnight remix outsold

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i dont care if this song is overrated and “didn’t deserve to win the rate” (it did), this is still such a banger

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.5): ya this just kinda lacks the oomph present in so many other tracks of this album… the worst person i know is a miley stan so there’s that too.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Such a serve when it came out but now that we’re further removed from it I’m kinda sour on how plastic it sounds, I think it aged well but I’ve grown past it.

**shhhneak** (7.2): I would listen to the Edge of Seventeen remix on repeat on the bus to see my now ex so this is practically unlistenable now xx

**bogo** (7): i overplayed this when it came out and think it's kinda overhyped now and not the most deserving winner, but it ain't bad. it's certainly one of the better songs she's released in the past five years

**impla77** (7): solid pop song

**thedoctordances1940** (7): thought overplay (by my mum) had maybe ruined this a bit for me but there is still a lot to like about it and as a winner well it's a lot better than hayley winning

**welcome2thejam** (7): Miley doing well in this sound? No way! With that voice? Who would've guessed

**Verboten_Prince** (6.8): She sounds like she needs to clear her throat

**TiltControls** (6.7): On one hand I think this track gets a little bit too much hate and was a fairly deserving winner of BUPR. On the other, I think this is one of the weaker songs in this rate so I can understand if it goes early. It does a great job matching the energy and vibe of Edge of Seventeen. But also I can just go listen to Edge of Seventeen.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): I'm just glad Nightmare wasn't here

## Why can’t you- Why can’t you just let me go

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): more and more i've come to realize that i just dont like her timbre bc the elements are good it's just her that i dont care for with this song

**pig-serpent** (5.8): This song has been my poster child for everyone loving what I think is mid synthwave, although I’ll at least give this one credit for having more of a disco influence.

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (5.5): I like her vocal work on this. Otherwise it's just alright. Not really standing out much.

**Hulnia** (5): why did i 10 this in the original rate? and give pris0ner my 11… 💀

**nick1372** (5): A good song that is far too derivative to deserve a place on this list of absolute classics. If this makes it past the first day just shut the sub down.

**Uberpigeon** (5): hayley williams' petals for armor my poor little meow meow that did nothing but make amazing bops and did not deserve to be beat by THIS!!

**akanewasright** (4.4): Halsey should’ve done her thing to us after this rate

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): did Miley make rate history by being the first artist competing against their godmother

**bulforster** (3.2): (#37) I remember this being more impactful... People seem to be really mad at this winner but I don't think I'd have been nicer to a different song from this rate

**dream_fighter2018** (3): yeah this felt like the coolest thing ever when it first came out and now I just hear it and go “meh”.

**reput4tionera** (3): im sorry this song is kinda boring

**Awkward_King** (2.5): boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

**MassiveThief** (2.5): This song was good for all of 1 listen. I'll never understand the extreme hype.

**apatel27** (2): It was outdated the moment it came out

**Stryxen** (2): okay? Anyway

**frogaranaman** (1): the last time some dude grabbed my ass at a bar without me wanting it this sonf was playing

**moonagenightmares** (1): mediocre eurovision song

**RandomHypnotica** (1): can you SAY overrated

**sarcasticsobs** (1): Finally, 80's-type pastiche that I actually don't abide by, and in conjunction with a vocal timbre that has never and will never connect with my ears. Exciting for me! I find this uninteresting enough that it does not even earn the coveted 0

**vayyiqra** (1): An abominable song that tries to rip off several other more famous, better 70s and 80s songs ("Edge of Seventeen" and "In the Air Tonight" among them) and ends up being far worse than any of them. What a crap overhyped album this was lmao

**GapeCod** (0): Easily the weakest and least deserving winner in these 50 rates. Any other top 5 track from that rate would have been an easy 10, how did people fuck this up so bad?

dark alt pop was a holy mess the whole way through, especially with the winner. as a host at the time, i was 100% into i disagree winning - the entire top 10 was so messy and fucked up that having a completely unexpected winner seemed like a great ending to it all. it was... not at all the most deserving winner in the rate, but i do think it's a good song and that there was very little else that could've won
the biggest thing is that i fucking wish that allie x was actually a contender in the rate, because she really wasn't after a certain point. she got knocked out of the top 3, then the top 5, and then she left at #7. i fucking love cape god - its my most played album on last fm - and it sucks that she got completely shut out of any possibility of winning. i am kinda proud of the little records she set that rate though (ie cape god is possibly the only album to have the highest average while leaving earliest, having the lowest amount of places between her first song out and last song to leave)
grimes and poppy both had targets on their backs, grimes for being a much muddier album than art angels and for [gestures vaguely at her personal life], poppy for being so abrasive and having such a specific bag of tricks that grated on some people. all of their obvious frontrunners had distinct haters, while i disagree won through virtue of the fewest people tanking it - it was a song the fans liked well enough and one the detractors didn't take too much issue with (when they were doing the rate at least). and like... yeah, that's anticlimactic, but it's not my fault some of yall shat on delete forever and bloodmoney! - u/akanewasright
---
**CrimsonROSET** (7): This was a weird winner for Dark Alt Pop, everyone agrees right? In such a divisive rate, it feels wrong that this won not really because anyone LOVED it, but because everyone else self-destructed. So while I understand how this ends up closing out out bottom5, I can't help but wonder how something else with some stronger defenders would have done. I do like this song, especially compared to others that were close to winning it- but in a rate like this one, I can't say I love it.

**camerinian** (4.5) man, I just don’t click with this at all. I’m not big into the tone of metal to begin with, but even among that, like, these two styles don’t seem to mesh at all? It feels like the shitty YouTube metal riff cover of itself. The hooks are not strong enough to overcome the crunch of the guitar and the metal elements don’t have enough impact to give the pop tones and melodies any real bite. Idk, I can kinda see how this would be a favourite if this was your vibe, but I’m not too sad to see that this also failed to take off here.
---

## *yells* I DISAGREE WITH THE PLACEMENT OF THIS TRACK

**thedoctordances1940** (11): yeah i don't think i got the impression this was all that popular of a winner but it was so very close to being my 11 and I was genuinely really happy to see it win, even more so because now I'm able to have 11ed both it and We Appreciate Power

**akanewasright** (10): deserved winner, very glad it got here. Any winner from this rate would be doomed, but I’m glad it at least went out with a bang

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Rockphobiaheads are gonna let this flop and I’m ready to be unsurprised but still mad.

**hikk** (10): like bloodmoney before it in as5, she will eat up that bottom 10 placement

**imbaby122** (10): the most sick and twisted thing i have ever done in my life is give this an 8 in its original rate. i listen to it everyday with my airpods at full volume to repent.

**moonagenightmares** (10): the most slay rate... will always be in my heart

**plastichaxan** (10): I have to defend her we share a name and this deserved it’s surprising win !!

**qazz23** (10): points to title when this goes out early

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this isn't even top 8 songs on the album but it's gonna be punished unfairly anyway

**reput4tionera** (10): i have been a poppy fan since the youtube days her career trajectory has been insane to watch

**Saison_Marguerite** (10): SLAY!!! Another upset that was really satisfying to watch, I didn’t think a metal-influenced track could win but I was proven wrong

**seanderlust** (10): me when this inevitably goes out day 1

**Stryxen** (10): gagged at this winning but so well deserved

**throwaway-7650** (10): 🗣️🗣️🗣️私はあなたに同意しません (x7)🗣️🗣️🗣️

**WaneLosertoc** (10): i don't know her i just know her appropriation of nu-metal has more goddamn bite and 5x the ideas than rina's. It earns the second place 11 on that alone (i had to give it to whitney for canonical reasons). i wanted to be shocked by y'alls winners. i really was here. :)

**TiltControls** (9.5): I never really thought I would've enjoyed Poppy's album until its rate. And then the five song opening from Concrete to Fill the Crown quickly proved me wrong. Poppy does a fantastic job mixing the poppier elements of her voice with the harder rock stylings needed for this track.

**jsonphile** (9): alright this bangs I can’t deny it

**sarcasticsobs** (9): I'm Poppy

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): this kind of electronic slash industrial alternative rock is my weakness. iI blame it on need for speed: most wanted (2005) (the good one)

**Verboten_Prince** (8.7): This is like the maximum amount of "edginess" I will accept before I start cringing

**starla_** (8.5): Fill the Crown is the best song on the album but this slaps too

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.1): this is better than i remember? might have to give this album another try

**DirtyRat583** (8): concrete outsold

**nick1372** (8): patriarchy retired!

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (8): I've thought for a while now that women make great metal and metal-ish vocalists. The contrast that comes about between their voices and the metal instrumentation makes for an interesting listen. If you would like to hear more female vocals with metal instrumentation and a pop flair I cannot recommend Condolence by Malikliya enough.

**pig-serpent** (8): I listen to this song and like it, then listen to BLOODMONEY and think that song is so much better that I have to knock this down a few points.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Now that Triple H is in charge of the WWE I can't wait for Poppy to start showing up there every three months with new music again

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): okay I was kind of vibing with this song this time around, poppy you are safe!

**itsabop** (7.8): I agree let it all burn down she's so right

**Roxieloxie** (7.8): we're hitting the point of the rate where i start listening to other songs I like more and wish had won

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): ig if any poppy song had to win i'm glad it was this one

**jman457** (7.4): I appreciate the guitar

**BasedButta** (7): great guitar on the verses, cool instrumental choices. sadly it dies down in many parts and ends up being a lot weaker than it should be. poppy you know how it is, you’re best when you’re screaming or when the guitars do it for you

**bespectacIed** (7): too over the place but the chorus goes offff

**monalisafrank** (7): there’s definitely some parts of this that scratch my brain in the right way (the different ways she sings the “down” rhymes) but the production feels so trend hoppy

**runaway3212** (7): This has grown off me a lot

WinnersRate3: ## *whispers* i disagree that this song should have won in the first place
 
**impla77** (6): queen of arson

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): if only she went full metal on this whole album and not just on bloodmoney….

**Uberpigeon** (6): bloodmoney should have WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): babymetal could write i disagree but poppy could never write Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!

**bulforster** (5.2): (#27) me to like half these songs being here

**shhhneak** (5.1): Omae wa mō shinde iru

**Awkward_King** (5): this is the middle child of my three winners in every sense of the word

**bogo** (5): eh it grew off me

**ImADudeDuh** (5): idk how this isn’t getting my 0 but it just works for me better than I would’ve expected.

**1998tweety** (4): I disagree (with this being in the rate)

**GapeCod** (4): I'm still bewildered by how not only did Allie not win the rate, but arguably one of the most lukewarm Poppy tracks did.. Bury me six feet deep, etc.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Allie X’s trajectory in this rate was sooo funny. Anyways, I’m still not really a big fan of Poppy’s metal rebrand but I won’t begrudge her for evolving as an artist and going in a direction she likes more. However that does not mean I will be streaming or giving good scores in rates!

**fadedblue09** (3): should I be bothered by the random Japanese

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (1): i disagree with the rate results.

**dream_fighter2018** (0): I’m sorry but this song just gives Scene Queen to me. I love pop metal, Babymetal’s debut is a 10/10 and BLOODMONEY is a massive 10 but I think it also requires a certain amount of charisma and innovation to pull off that this song does not have. In fact, it gets very grating, very quick.

**SinfulAnarchy** (0): wut is this

**vayyiqra** (0): No I'm not tanking this because I'm mad it won. I am tanking it because I can't stand it and was too nice the first time. Legitimately I hate this album lmao. Good rate though ! Glad we got to do it. hi Akane

**camerinian** (6): please refer to Hypno's comment/shared trauma. My score is lower because the ad I remember most was the cinema one where a guy with an afro sits in front of the family and the dude behind him just fucking eats a hole in his hair so they can see the screen which is surely a hate crime????

**CrimsonROSET** (0): no it wouldn't be nice mr. boys

---

**anothertown** (10): this 10 is for my wife who went through an intense beach boys phase and gets so embarrassed whenever they come up that I have to laugh privately to myself because come on. They are one of the most widely respected bands of all time. No one will ever judge you for knowing the difference between the current day “Beach Boys” IP and “Brian Wilson And Friends”

**frogaranaman** (10): BOP

**sufjancaesar** (10): Why is the version with only vocals somehow even better

**vayyiqra** (10): It's an alltimer even if I don't care for this band a whole lot and don't get most of Pet Sounds

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): gay yearning a bit

**seanderlust** (8.7): this is one of those songs that feels like it pre-dates music - like it's always been with us in some form or another. i cannot imagine this song debuting on a radio station

**bespectacIed** (8): don't know the specifics of this rate but God Only Knows lost????????? hao the fuck

**qazz23** (8): It's a nice opener, but they have better

**sarcasticsobs** (8): I get it but at the same time I don't

**welcome2thejam** (8): One of the best intros of all time

**jman457** (7.6): wouldn't it be nice if this was longer

**LilacDaffodils** (7.3): This song holds a lot of childhood nostalgia for me because my dad raised me on the beach boys. I like many of their other songs better but you can't deny it would be nice.

**RandomHypnotica** (7): advertising ruined this song for me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9whel2UuXg

**shhhneak** (6): feel like this was in every 2000s comedy movie.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): it would be nice if you could write a better song

**impla77** (5): This is a bit of a trigger for me since it plays in the incessant adverts starring Lily James unfortunately

**TiltControls** (3): this rate had so many options how did this win when its just so bland as a song. There's even better choices on the same album!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): almost gave this an irrational hate 0 because God Only Knows is vastly better, but didn't want a bunch of white guys ages 22-45 to yell at me so here's an unenthused and grumpy 2. Even Sloop John B is better! I JUST WASN'T MADE FOR THESE TIMES?! Hello? And this won? like COME ON, over this song ugh

**plastichaxan** (1): Not my type of music oop

**WaneLietocSitsDown&TalksShop** (1): radical centrist ass winner. didn't do 60s rate because i was listening to soundgarden catalog on tape for grunge rate. Beach Boys are fine. this song is like an 8+ but is also so goddamn "yeah sure okay" in my mind. the sub is too baby ears headass for king crimson and i dont want to ever talk VU (fat 9.8-10.1 depending on day) with anyone.

**MK** (0): I should not have looked up the context behind this song

**Stryxen** (0): I hate this song omfg so glad I wasn't alive in the 60s how did this win anything

the passage of time is crazy...i can't believe this was only last year like WTF. anyway this was truly the pinnacle of rating/hosting to me, it was so fun and i'm glad that such a rate was even able to take place as at that time kpop boys had not been touched at allll. i should say something about the winner but lemme remain positive...although some placements shocked me i think over time i've mellowed out and come to realise that honestly the top 10 is actually extremely slayful. also hosting was a very stressful experience for me (real ones remember when i literally cried over the spring day shitpost being blocked by youtube and had to go take a walk to calm down) but i would like to give a very special shout-out to the bestie belb u/wavingwolves who was truly the best cohostie anyone could ask for and whom i love very much ❤️ we slayed that i think - u/MoonlightByWindow

—

**CrimsonROSET** (9): So, this isn't an area both of us are very knowledgeable about- but even I know how this win was fucking iconic. People are still mourning 4walls to this day, but I think what we got instead is equally as great, if not better! Scraping out of the bottom 5 is I think better than some people thought it would do, but I still think it deserved better. Maybe in 2022 in kpop?

**camerinian** (7.5): this is a cute bop. I literally can't add much to this because I did not do this rate, I had never heard this song or this band before in my life, and I am so far outside the k pop world, or at least beyond what gets western crossover. But I liked it, and I think I should just defer to the experts on this one.

## SHINee

**1998tweety** (10): pop perfection, even girl group only stans can admit its good

**akanewasright** (10): they put their whole shinussies into this

**bespectacIed** (10): graduations, weddings, funerals, gay bars

**bigbigbee** (10): I forgive this for unleashing the Idols Dressed In Normal Clothes trend in k-pop

**DirtyRat583** (10): this is from the same company as aespa... where did sm go wrong

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): literally boy group music for the girls… i can’t make it not bop! also minho in that white shirt was my gay awakening fr fr.

**frogaranaman** (10): shinussy was put into this etc etc

**hikk** (10): i've seen too many kpoppies talk about tanking this DON'T BETRAY US LIKE THIS

**ignitethephoenix** (10): thinking about how blackpink songs age on arrival and this one is still fine wine

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): my first rate :)

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Still not over the "it's too gay to not win" comment from this rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this song made me cry so hard i had to listen to jopping to calm myself down

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): classic

**bogo** (9): whoopi goldberg is shaking

**PhloxInvar** (9): Originally a girl group song, SHINEE takes this and gives us this iconic boy group pop song. Like seriously, we need more GG songs sung by boy groups.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): What! A!!! BANGER!!!!!!!!!!

**vayyiqra** (9): dudes rock

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): “Down Down Down Down” SHINee are describing what will happen to their leaderboard ranking after this rate

**imbaby122** (8): kind of a banger but i’m feeling especially misandrist right now…

**RandomHypnotica** (8): ok i don't hate this as much as some people do, probably the best kpop winner here tbh

**Saison_Marguerite** (8): SHINee deserved the win but not with this song

**WaneLosertoc** (7.8): straight up gotta fucking stop k-poppers from trying to make life in the American South look like an adventure; they didn't travel there to film it in any of those proto-authoritarian hellholes, but MAN do their fits and the aesthetic make me think "the south". a major city's infrastructure has failed and people are drinking water from bottled sources. like all those states wont allow abortions. shit's bleak but the video and song are alright i guess

**jman457** (7.7): ok this was really groovy, loved the base in it.

**TiltControls** (7.5): Though there were a few better songs in the rate, I'm not too disappointed with this winning. It's got a fun energy and the production is great.

**welcome2thejam** (7): Ooh, this one's a fun dance track. Might grow on me post-rate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): Cute but The Chaser was in this rate.

**Verboten_Prince** (6.1): There are a handful of songs that I've listened to from this rate (which I unfortunately did not participate in…) that I didn't like at first, but slowly I started to vibe with them. This song… seems to have taken the opposite direction?? Like I had no problem listening to it before but now it sounds kinda basic and boring?

**hunnybee12** (6): gaybait

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): there were at least 25 better songs in this rate

**pig-serpent** (6): Having attempted to listen to this rate’s playlist, the fact that I don’t hate it means it’s probably a worthy winner. There are some very nice vocal passages in this song, as well as a cool bassline, but some of the leading synths feel cliche.

**runaway3212** (6): the view is like a rooftop bar at the 3rd floor, in new york

## SHITee

**bulforster** (5.8): (#24) kpoppies 🤝 misandrists , tanking this bop for some reason

**impla77** (5.4): not sure being a bop is enough in this particular rate

**jsonphile** (5): this won a rate? I don’t know a lot about kpop boy bands but I expect them to sound a bit more interesting than this

**monalisafrank** (5): this rate has taught me that I simply don’t vibe with the kpop sound

**reput4tionera** (5): kpop is for the girls

**BasedButta** (4): taemin you are the slayest kpop boy that has ever slayed but I need you to stop singing this repetitive dreary song NOW

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (3.5): This is just empty. Lighter than air, it goes in one ear and out the other.

**starla_** (3.5): the chorus did not go to the heights I was hoping for

**nick1372** (3): I'm thoroughly unimpressed

**Awkward_King** (1.5): my boyfriend said this just sounded like uk club music and i cant exactly say he was wrong

**dream_fighter2018** (1): I was a Shawol, don’t get me wrong, but this is their worst comeback. It’s the most boring trop pop song to ever trop, and is a blight on an otherwise great discography

**GapeCod** (1): I hate the SM bias so much it's unreal. Thank you f(x) for releasing a far cuntier version of this.

**moonagenightmares** (1): most overrated kpop song of all time

**plastichaxan** (1): I don’t want it to seem like I’m tanking the K-Pop for being K-Pop it’s just that the rates have had really bad winners

## Love is four :woeiswoeiswoeiswoeis:

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): this song winning was my consolation for 4 Walls being a 3-time LOSER

**jasannn** (9): I'm team 4 walls

**throwaway-7650** (8): LOVE IS 4 WAOWAOWAOWAO / 너로 채운 MIRROR MIRROR

**anothertown** (5): love is four walls

**CrimsonROSET** (10): BOOTS WITH THE FUR! I don’t care that this was a 2008 song in a 2010s rate! I don’t care if it’s dumb and a jock jam! If you ever hear about boots and don’t go ‘with the fur’ I don’t want nothing to do with you! Of course this was never going to do that great, but I'm more than welcome to turn my brain off and have a good time for a bit, especially in the world that we are living in right now, and this is a peak choice to pick to what soundtracks those moments.

**camerinian** (8): I don't think I've ever actively searched for this song, it just always finds me somehow. It's a prime situational bop for sure, but man does it pop the fuck off. This was never gonna rise too high given how stupid and how omnipresent it's been culturally basically since it came out, but God damn this song deserved its win and deserved its spot here, like it has anything left to prove.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is better than most of this rate.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the cultural impact of this song is crazy when you think about it

**Roxieloxie** (10): a song from 2007 winning the 2010 pop rap rate was pure comedy im sorry. Blame the host for including it. Its kinda the best song ever made though and eats up half of the songs listed before this

**Stryxen** (10): shorty got low low low low… in the rankings LMAO

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i miss when music was fun like this

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): generation defining moment

**WaneLosertoc** (10): i had a chemistry teacher who once quoted this song; he always did this shit. while passing out scantrons for an exam (IN 2013) he said "you're gonna be driving cadillacs in your dreams". this man was insane; students tracked him down after he moved halfway across the country and called him trying to get him to come out for our graduation. this song is also insane but in a complimentary way.

**Verboten_Prince** (9.6): witdaFURRRRRRR

**Saison_Marguerite** (9.3): Like a G6 deserved but I have a renewed love for this song after Pop Rap. That entire rate was an iconic re-appraisal party

**bogo** (9): if you don't like this song i'm sorry but you're boring as fuck

**jasannn** (9): when will the pop girlies make a chorus this memorable?

**just_thonking** (9): I can't believe I am rating this higher than some of the best songs ever made

**thedoctordances1940** (9): honestly i can't in good conscience not give a really high score to a song from this rate

**imbaby122** (8.1): i really hope this song persists for generations to come bc it is a time capsule but also a modern classic.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**bigbigbee** (8): this was like one of the best rates ever. I had SO much fun. Thanks again to the hosts jackisboredtoday and izeasklapaucius

**hunnybee12** (8): when i was a kid i had no concept of a nightclub was so when songs mentioned "clubs" i pictured people sitting in plastic chairs in a circle in a gym like the after school clubs i went to 💀

**pig-serpent** (8): A ten at a party, but a six alone in my hotel room. Unfortunately for this song’s fans, I am not doing this rate at a party.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): apple bottom jeans, boots with the jeans (with the jeans), the whole club was looking at jeans, she hit the jeans (she hit the jeans), next thing you jeans, shawty got JEANS, JEANS, JEANS, JEANS, JEANS, JEANS, JEANS, JEANS

**RandomHypnotica** (8): ...this should be like a G6 :(

**sufjancaesar** (8): Still embodies everything annoying about this era of music (complimentary)

**throwaway-7650** (8): me when describing the placement of this rate's winner regardless of which song won (which should've been like a G6 btw)

**shhhneak** (7.8): Storytime: I was at a live taping of a TV show and during intermission they had the audience doing karaoke. A 10 year old girl wearing head-to-toe purple with giant Uggs volunteered and knew EVERY word to this song.

**jman457** (7.6): (Sober 5, Drunk 11)

**akanewasright** (7.5): G6 robbed

**DirtyRat583** (7.5): chronically noughties

**emayzee** (7.3): 99% of the time if i loved a song as a kid it's still a 10 for me as an adult but this is just fine

**TiltControls** (7.2): I'm still a little surprised this managed to win Pop Rap. Though I'll definitely take it over the runner up, this track is still stuck in 2007 in my mind. It's fun enough, but compared to the rest of the tracks in the rate it feels a bit out its depth. I'd be surprised if this one doesn't place low (low, low, low, low, low, low, low)

**impla77** (7): I can't stop thinking about the beach boys version

**itsabop** (7): Who can forget about those apple bottom jeans and boots with the fur

**jsonphile** (7): yeah this absolutely slaps and deserved to win its rate but like in this rate? Yeah it’s not on the same level as these classics

**monalisafrank** (7): the transition from criminal to this was like being ripped into another dimension. one of the best club bangers of this era but this is its top limit for me. Honestly had it higher at first but I forgot how awful some of flo rida’s verses are. T pain carries as usual

**nick1372** (7): shawty hot like a toaster

**Uberpigeon** (7): the outfit he is describing is ugly when u think about it. also rona use this as the shitpost https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zIDiHXvhOY

**anothertown** (6): but imagine how tired we are?

**apatel27** (6): Flo Rida has better songs

**bespectacIed** (6): iconic lines. Fun for what it is. Aged like flo-rida's career

**DefaultPophead** (6): Major grade six disco vibes.

**vayyiqra** (6): This whole genre was kind of crap but this is catchy and made for a good meme so respect that at least

**welcome2thejam** (6): Divorced from the sheer overplay, I'm liking this a lot more than I did in the late 00s. Ask me in a few years and maybe I'll be the one with the apple bottom jeans, boots with the jeans, the whole rate looking at jeans

## Wait that’s a terrible outfit to wear to the club

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.5): this is so unserious i can’t

**plastichaxan** (5): Okay maybe this isn’t 1-worthy but I’m still bitter this beat Like A G6 when it isn’t even a 2010s song sob

**runaway3212** (5): one of the most undeserved winners ever

**sarcasticsobs** (5): I am Flo Rida anti and I will not cower. All points for T-Pain

**seanderlust** (5): this alphabetical organization of the rate playlist is honestly my favorite and we should do it more often. the pure whiplash going from fiona apple to BOOTS WITH THE FURRR is camp

**bulforster** (4.8): (#29) shoutout to all the other 11 year olds in 2009 dropping low to this at their year 6 discos

**NotWith10000Men** (4.5): this simply does not belong in this playlist good lord

**PhloxInvar** (4.5): APPLE BOTTOM JEANS.

**BasedButta** (4): cool for the first minute

**MassiveThief** (4): it's a classic or whatever but you won't catch me listening to this voluntarily

**reput4tionera** (4): the song is fine but it gives me violent flashbacks to high school dances

**Awkward_King** (3.5): giving this a higher score than jolene with my entire chest

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): The Party Rockers send their regards.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): points for the meme factor but unfortunately, this sounds like this

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (3): Low? How about a low SCORE! HOW'D YOU LIKE THAT FLORIDA?! This song is as empty as writing that joke out made me feel.

**starla_** (2.5): in hindsight this is terrible

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): low is right! this just reminds me of middle school in the worst possible way but it's also legendary idk i mostly just hate it

**cremeebrulee** (1): this song is fucking ASS idc idc. i literally roll my eyes anytime it comes on at a function, the opening verse is as tired & unfunny now as it was in 2007. deserves worse than what it'll get

**frogaranaman** (1): this wasn't even released in the proper timeframe of the rate

**GapeCod** (1): [#2: Far East Movement - Like A G6](https://youtu.be/qP_N-S_BVJg)

**WaneLietocSitsDown&TalksShop** (11): we're not gonna get a proper shoegaze rate ever are we? we can settle for shit like this i suppose. loved nu-metal rate because all 4 albums had tumultuous dysphoric energy I craved, huge riffs i live off of, and ideas that keep me head in the clouds. Kudos to Piper for truly going the extra mile to Make This Work and get this set of 4 curated when we coulda settled for k0rN v. LB v. SOAD. We all knew this was gonna win and no one had a problem because this song is straight up the best goddamn winner we've produced in all our rates. fuck all the haters that didn't do this rate or give these albums high scores. cowards.

**qazz23** (10): really like the alt metal mixed with shoegaze sound of this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): my first (and only) 11 win on indieheads, gotta show it some love here even though i know popheads will hate this

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I'm gonna call this the first 'robbery' that we're going to face (first of many, I assure you) but I don't know, I thought this was gonna do better! Maybe it's the people who are still mad this is here and not Safaera, maybe it's too horny for popheads. I don't know! What I do know is that this is a BANGER, and I'm sad to see some of our non-english representation leave, especially something this bouncy. Wish him better luck in 2022 Ultimate!

**camerinian** (7.5) Well, uh… after seeing the video I understand better why this won. I do like it, and there’s more going in the production than a standard reggaeton track (or at least thrones that chart, which is my whole reference frame). I guess I was just expecting something bigger for a winner? Regardless, if this came on at a club or party I would get down for it, the bounce in the beat is infectious.

—

## Yo Perreo Sola (fierce, independent)

**bigbigbee** (10): relatable. Once, I was dancing at a party in college, and a guy came up behind me and tried to grind, and I pulled a maneuver to get away that was so weird, my friend later told me that he said “what the fuck was that” in confusion. Anyway I can’t really perrea, but I definitely flail alone

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): ngl i wish this was my 11 in this rate

**frogaranaman** (10): this score is pretending Ghost's 0 in that rate does not exist 🙏🏼

**GapeCod** (10): Did not expect perreo to mean that.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): idgaf that this is going out at #47, hes still more successful and more powerful and more charitable than your fave

**plastichaxan** (10): My flop rate!! My meow meow, the only rate I’ve hosted where the procrastinationheads didn’t come through, anyway this is a bop and big titty Benito lives in my mind rent free

**ricki** (10): ill just pretend this is safaera for my own well being

**Saison_Marguerite** (10): comment

**seanderlust** (10): yes safaera would have been a slay winner but when this song comes on i am throwing ASS

**Stryxen** (10): so so addictive. I remember doing this rate front to back a little bit drunk on a voice call and I was having the time of my life

**WaneLosertoc** (10): they keep trying to cancel noted punk rock bad boy Bad Bunny bc he actually has ideas AND can do TASTEE drag that has real raw reason and bite behind it. It's hard for me not to support the vision. plus he has the punk rock sunglasses. ROCK ON SIR!

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): Still pissed at myself for missing this rate, but in reality I just would've contributed to the Bad Bunny win, so does it really matter?

**Roxieloxie** (9): and we will all be very sad when Mr.Bad Goes out at the humble position of #38

**vayyiqra** (9): dude rocks

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): this was kinda his starboy era if u rly think about it… like the fact that his 2022 album was EVEN bigger than YHLQMDLG is crazy

**TiltControls** (8.7): That production is seriously hypnotic. Bad Bunny himself does a fantastic job on the vocals here, though I also have to shoutout whoever the female vocalist is! She adds a ton to the track when working in tandem with BB.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): this is one of those songs that's a 10 when drunk at a club but it's still sooo fun, and an interesting message to boot!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): benito in chains is doing things to me

**starla_** (8.5): absolutely slaps

**1998tweety** (8): boppy

**akanewasright** (8): this was the BORING winner, but whatever, it bangs and Benito can still call me

**anothertown** (8): i miss college parties for the 3 mins this is playing. ellas estaban perreado solas all over the place

**RandomHypnotica** (8): i feel like how well this song places will dictate where bad bunny ends up getting rated next

**welcome2thejam** (8): Love a positive twerk anthem that also goes positively hard as hell

**Verboten_Prince** (7.7): The way he dressed up in drag I thought HE was gonna be the one to say "yo perreo sola" but unfortunately that wasn't the case

**bogo** (7.5): bad bunny has bigger ass-shakers than this, but this is still good ass-shaking music

**imbaby122** (7.5): bad bunny arca collab when.

**jsonphile** (7.5): Mr Bunny sir you’re great but you got tough competition here I’m sorry

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): deserved to win and is a good song, probably won't do well in this rate though

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): bad bunny's the worst part of his own song x

**qazz23** (7): a bit repetitive, liking the guest vocals

**bulforster** (6.6): (#20) still mad this came 6th/6 in the popheads 2020 VOTY voting

**impla77** (6.5): feminist icon

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): never heard a bad bunny song in my life but this is good

**nick1372** (6.5): Pretty basic for a Bad Bunny song but it's still a banger. This is great in all the same ways that Nice For What is.

## Yo Perreo Sola (lonely)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Incredibly slay music video, not quite as slay song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): So glad that I don’t have to listen to “Safaera” again but this song never really felt like a winner to me, it’s so middle of the road compared to many of the other songs here. It’s background music for a party. I think I just have to accept that Bad Bunny is not for me, like I respect what he’s doing but I don’t like the way he sounds like he’s trying to swallow his words when he sings them.

**monalisafrank** (6): Feels longer than it is

**NotWith10000Men** (6): it's fine. wish it had more melody

**reput4tionera** (6): the vocal chops in the chorus sound like an OMFG song

**runaway3212** (6): honestly don't get how this won over many better songs

**jman457** (5.9): sorry i honestly cant get into Reggaeton

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): for what’s supposed to be a “female empowerment anthem” this song just makes me feel gross. like its supposed to be about telling men to leave women alone at clubs and stop sexualizing them…but throughout the whole song the lyrics are sexualizing the woman in question? that doesn’t make me feel good about myself all this song tells me is that men can’t respect women without also bringing up how sexually attracted they are to them.

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (4): This isn't made for this format. Its place is in a party playlist or club soundtrack. Isolated from that, it's far too thin and basic.

**shhhneak** (4): Great album cover, beautiful album cover.

**BasedButta** (3): ew

**dream_fighter2018** (3): I just think this isn’t my thing

**bespectacIed** (2): dancing on my own if it didn't slay:

**pig-serpent** (2): I’ve heard a few very cool reggaeton songs, but 99% of the popular songs in the genre are just way too sparse for me to want to dance to them, and this song is definitely in the latter camp. I had high hopes but I hate this.

**PhloxInvar** (1): A bit unfortunate that I just find the song obnoxious and really hard to listen to. I know that's not the intention and so many people love this song, but the genre is 100% not for me and this style of music just grates on my nerves a little.

this rate feels like an absolute lifetime ago, so much has changed since then it's hard to remember how I felt at the time. It was really crazy witnessing my 11 stay as the winner for the entirety of the rate (even though it had some close calls), and my absolute favourite part was seeing the queen SHURA HERSELF pop up in both threads!!! This is such a perfect sensual sexy bop, and although I think Number One Fan has been remembered a little more fondly, this is still absolutely deserving of it's spot here. - u/RandomHypnotica

Before this rate, I had taken a bit of a break from hosting. Nothing had really caught my eyes enough to want to want to do a bunch of extra work for it. However, the appeal of these big, gay, synthy albums was more than enough to draw me back in. Especially as I have come into my identity as a queer woman, these albums continue to resonate with me, and religion by Shura especially is so joyus and great, and I love it so much - u/static_int_husp

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I didn't think this would do that great either, but I'm still kinda sad this is going out so early! Shura seems like an absolute sweetheart, and this was without a doubt the song that most grew on me throughout the rate. The synths are popping, the lesbian nuns are kissing and I'm having a good time. I didn't do this rate sadly (and I'd probably have 11d Number One Fan if I had) but I think this is more than a worthy winner to that rate, even if it seems not everyone agrees!

**camerinian** (8): i know i should expect that the less flashy stuff doesn't tend to hold up in a winners rate, but man, some of y'all really had it out for poor Shura. This is such a cute little warm playful intimate summer jam, and it had a stranglehold on me in 2019. Coming back to it is always a delight, and even if not a whole lot is done with the religious motif, the lesbians deserve a poolside anthem to drink aperol spritz to.

## Yass mother Mary

**GapeCod** (11): Лесби-Иисус

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): A life changing song for the Baptism fetish community.

**bogo** (10): women, fuck yeah

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): gay rights!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): lesbian synthpop >>> the beatles

**letsallpoo** (10): this song reminds me of my boyfriend (I have a boyfriend)

**PhloxInvar** (10): THESE GAY NUNS.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): using this comment to promo [this awful shitpost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_haalqnGDo) i made for the song that was blocked at the time of the reveal

**vayyiqra** (10): Now that we have hopefully had enough of "disco" revival maybe we can get some sophistipop revival please? Also Popheads listen to Shura more, both of her albums rule (especially the first one)

**nick1372** (9.5): gay rights!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): comment

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): i'm gay

**Stryxen** (9): hit

**imbaby122** (8.9): oh this one’s got a little groove to ittttt

**BasedButta** (8.5): so true

**starla\_** (8.5): as a fellow lesbian I'm contractually obliged to love Shura (and I do!) but this song doesn't quite go as hard as I wish it did

**jman457** (8.3): we love a lesbian sex anthem with ironic religious references

**WaneLosertoc** (8.2): how the fuck did shura win a rate? i thought this was an artist who just existed on dead oceans and lived in p4k 7.8 purgatory. i'll bump her to an 8.2

**Awkward\_King** (8): lesbians

**bespectacIed** (8): she snapped

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): A bit confused by why we’ve rated Shura so many times given their stature in the music industry but at the same time, look at the material! I’ve tried listening to their albums and I think they kinda get lost in their own sound at times and thus don’t have a ton of appeal in a vacuum, but they’re great in small doses and their hits really pop.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): no one tag Shura please for her to see where this places!

**just\_thonking** (8): Let's go lesbians! Also someone please listen to my mashup of this with In Your Eyes: [https://rave.dj/Ng08H1ZUl9vdhA](https://rave.dj/Ng08H1ZUl9vdhA)

**monalisafrank** (8): this bops! added to my playlist

**plastichaxan** (8): Let’s go lesbians!!

**qazz23** (8): like the funky synthpop sound

**ricki** (8): clairo was mocked, bullied and disrespected in this rate in a way that should be illegal. i wont take it out on shura, but let it be known that im actively holding myself back from doing so

**Roxieloxie** (8): ya ok

**impla77** (7.6): I Stan lesbian nuns

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): she did this for the catholic lesbians

**emayzee** (7.2): is this chorus not sampling i want your sex by george michael

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.9): If Popheads had a club I assume they'd only play songs that sound exactly like this 24/7

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): Hmmmmmmmmmm. Think I am just tired of this specific kinda sound. And "yearning" stuff usually works on me. Interesting.

**anothertown** (6): umm it’s nice but the waifish nymphish gay girl imagery bothers me so bad minus points

**hunnybee12** (6): clairo was robbed this rate i didnt forget

**reput4tionera** (6): i have heard a lot of hype about shura and honestly im whelmed

**flava** (5): I love Shura but this was not it, but I guess the most standard and uncreative of synthpop songs can win rates too

**frogaranaman** (5): this is good but also how did this win

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (4.5): This is an example of a song that doesn't need to be as long as it is. It doesn't have enough ideas or instrumental variation to justify four minutes of runtime. Which is not even that much time, but it's enough to make the song feel like it's overstayed its welcome.

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): wlw and religious imagery… name a better combo

**throwaway-7650** (4): listening to this immediately after plastic love did not do it any favors. why did this become a hit in japan...

**bulforster** (3.8): (#34) Cute song but cute doesn't really cut it in winners rates.

**fadedblue09** (3.5): typical indie synthpop….aka the types of rates I avoid

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): not my kinda song at all

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): this was the last song i listened to for the rate and maybe if i was listening to the rate in order i wouldve given it a neutral 5 and moved on but i was so underwhelmed and disappointed at this being the last song of the rate for me that im taking off additional points for being bad

**runaway3212** (2): I hate religion

**thedoctordances1940** (1): I have never actually listened to shura but I always got the feeling I would not like her. Seems I was right. These vocals are genuinely painful to listen to

**TiltControls** (0): This song doesn't inspire hate or anything but it feels like filler compared to everything else here. Even compared to the other stuff I scored low. I think I had a fairly high average for all 3 artists in this rate yet I'm still a little confused how this beat everything else out. Sorry Shura : (

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this feels like i'm supposed to snap when it ends

**camerinian** (5.5): opinions, etc. idk this is the last thing i’m finishing for this rate and my brain capacity is at -1. This the type of mid indie that I have no idea why such a massive fanbase has built up around.

---

**bespectacIed** (11): Shit I already gave my 11 to portishead before this but I had to backtrack. Bros before bops, gotta put on my indie hat for now. Many people have already exhausted the discourse and dissections on this song and this opus of an album, not gonna try to give my input lol. Just wanna appreciate the comforting, devastating, sobering beauty of this song. Song that forces you to pause, makes you reassess your life, and stays with you forever. One of my all-time favorite

**frogaranaman** (11): because of course

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): I do like how we’re rating this again, since this was in the exchange rate, and I like how I can now give it the 10 it deserves

**qazz23** (10): This is the best one off the album - love the strings

**Stryxen** (10): this is for the American aquarium drinkers ONLY 😤

**WaneLietocSitsDown&TalksShop** (10): there were only like 10 good winners in this rate and they were all wilco cuts. never realized how much people loved THIS one the most. was pleasantly surprised to see my 11, heavy metal drummer, make it to no. 2.

**welcome2thejam** (10): This is my fourth favorite song of all time. It legit has the highest chance to make me tear up of any song I know. Jeff Tweedy showed up at Japanese Breakfast's set this year to play this and made my entire year & will be a concert memory I'll have for a lifetime. This is just a beautiful, beautiful track that always has a place in my heart. That said I can't let Bubblegrunge flop so this is only a ten

**sarcasticsobs** (9.2): Maybe one day I'll get why this is "one of the best albums of all time", but today is not that day. Still a great song, this and "Heavy Metal Drummer" rule

**slimboyfriend** (8.7): keepers of the dad rock mantle

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): i don't remember what i gave this in ih exchange but i remember being surprised this was an ih classic

**jman457** (7.2): a bit overrated by the pitchfork crowd

**impla77** (7): if we were all burning suns our energy problem would be solved

**MK** (7): white man bad vocals current count: 2

**anothertown** (6): 🤷

**seanderlust** (5.3): turning your ORBIT around you say?? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjRKIXKG9ac

**vayyiqra** (4): I know this album is a classic but I don't think this band is for me. It's fine, I just have no interest in it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i genuinely cannot fathom what anyone sees in this song

**MassiveThief** (2): Up there with the most overrated indie classics

**Catalyst** (0): songs like these remind me why i'm not an Indiehead, just a Radiohead (vote for EE ER).

It honestly shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone, least of all myself, of just how much of a runaway victory Euphoria would've had in the Eurovision rate. Even now, 10 years after its triumph in Baku, [it continues to top yearly lists of the best Eurovision songs of all time](https://songfestival.be/en/top-250-2021/exclusief-de-volledige-resultaten-van-de-esc-top-250-2021/), and its not hard at all to see why. On a musical level, its simply pop perfection, building up in all the right places and having an explosive chorus that's impossible to deny. On a performance level, Loreen sang pitch perfect and had such simple but perfect staging, the spotlight literally being on her as she danced her way through her performance. There will never be another Eurovision song like Euphoria, a song so captivating that it becomes the immediate fan favorite everyone roots for, and absolutely curb stomps the competition in a landslide victory. Naysayers will call its victory boring and predictable, but its hard to imagine a better winner for a Eurovision rate than the one that changed the perception of the contest and showed that its more than just a silly music show, one that showed all of Europe (and the rest of the world) that Eurovision is where musical perfection can thrive. - u/TakeOnMeByA-ha

**camerinian** (7.5): As a Eurovision beginner, I didn’t feel qualified to partake in the original rate, and knowing now how clearly signposted this was as a winner, I feel like I am somewhat up to speed. I do appreciate the ridiculous scale and bombast of this whole thing, in the right headspace this would probably do a lot for me! Unfortunately as a bit of an outsider, I think it’s good but I’m also reminded that a lot of music sounded like this in 2012.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): Oh, Eurovision. What are we going to do with you. One of the most chaotic rates we've had recently, and I say that absolutely with endearment- which is why I'm sad it had such an obvious winner! I don't know, this doesn't really do much for me outside when it's clearly starting to be big. I wish could see in this what everyone does, I guess.

## Eurotrash

**Awkward\_King** (10): idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc idc

**bespectacIed** (10): Still pissed that i forgot to submit my scores in this rate, literally it was done and all, just forgot and realized at the day of reveal lmao. Sweden's greatest contribution to humanity, bar none.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is gonna get tanked just for coming from the Eurovision rate but this is an immaculate pop song like just listen!

**bogo** (10): this is really the best eurovision has to offer? a generic 2010s dance song? the answer is yes it grew on me

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): best eurovision winner of all time argue with the wall

**DirtyRat583** (10): the USA's feeble gmo pussy could never compare to the EU's big strong juicy organic coochie

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): i'm eurovision trash so this should be expected…. literally the song which got me into eurovision!! shum would be an 11 though.

**GapeCod** (10): Glad to be done with eurovision for good tbh!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): euPHOOOOOOOOOOOOOORIA!

**itsabop** (10): Still the best winner of Eurovision ever, what a bop that truly transcended that contest

**MassiveThief** (10): genuinely have never heard of this song/artist... but holy mother of god SLAY

**runaway3212** (10): best winner (of eurovision) ever

**sarcasticsobs** (10): SCREAMS early 2010's (okay I looked it up, came out in 2012, it's alllll coming together), but NOT in a bad way. Go Sweden!!!

**shhhneak** (10): This goes beyond the best Eurovision song and might actually be one of the best pop songs ever. I’m ready for that conversation.

**starla\_** (10): if you give this song less than 10 you're straight, I don't make the rules

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): cant wait to see the winner of the first rate i hosted get bottom 5 in here 💔 anyway this song really grew on me after it won the eurovision rate, it definitely deserved its win and seeing it become an unstoppable force in real time was definitely an experience i wont forget, even though everybody knows that dancing lasha tumbai was the real winner in our hearts smh

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.8): Honestly shows the absolute power of a good voice. The backing track is mostly generic-ish electronica type stuff, a dime a dozen in the 2010s, but Loreen’s godly wail can cut through all that and elevate it to… well she puts it best: Divinity!

**monalisafrank** (9.5): this song sounds like what MDMA feels like. I wish the synths had a touch more warmth and it would be a ten

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): comment

**1998tweety** (9): BOP

**vayyiqra** (9): Amazingly cheesy Europop (complimentary)

**pig-serpent** (8.9): Eurodance rules, but I think the Eurovision sense of melodrama might be holding this back a little bit.

**akanewasright** (8.5): idk it’s just a fun pop song

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): the way I like the song more than the live performance

**bigbigbee** (8): I get it now…

**imbaby122** (8): i don’t follow eurovision, i didn’t even do the eurovision rate, and yet i knew this was a eurovision song.

**just\_thonking** (8): This grew on me a lot

**jasannn** (7.5): Euphoria is my favorite continent

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): there were better songs in the rate but this is still good

**PhloxInvar** (7.5): A grower, she's a good song.

**slimboyfriend** (7.1): Honestly better than I expected for a Eurovision winner from the EDM era

**qazz23** (7): has a strong chorus but not liking the vocals too much

**TiltControls** (7): I know that this is a bit of a drop for a song that I 11'd previously, but in hindsight that might've been a 'compared to its competitors' type deal. The vocals match the name of the song and they're filled with a rising joy for sure. But the song itself has almost no flow to it beyond that.

## International trash

**jman457** (6.4): I wish the strings were better incorporated into this

**emayzee** (6.1): so aggressively 2012 (derogatory)

**reput4tionera** (6): is this from eurovision it sounds like a eurovision song

**ricki** (6): this gif was actually recorded to this song

**Uberpigeon** (6): this corny ass drop

**frogaranaman** (5): this is exactly what I expect Eurovision gays to listen to

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Fortunately I am not European so I have no sentimental attachment to this!

**impla77** (5): classic Eurovision. Chorus bops, verses boring

**nick1372** (5): Oh I didn't know carly rae did EDM

**sufjancaesar** (5): This is a good Eurovision song but also explains why I hate Eurovision-core songs

**WaneLosertoc** (5): oh man it's all my least favorite elements in an early 2012 soundsystem package!

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (4.5): By itself it has obvious energy but doesn't bring much else. I like her voice but I don't think it's utilized well here.

**fadedblue09** (3): I guess I just don't get Europe

**welcome2thejam** (3): This is popheads bait and I'm only taking it this time to drag it deep into the riverbed

**NotWith10000Men** (2.5): the beginning is absolutely incredible... then it turns into 2012

**cremeebrulee** (2): do not miss this flavor of electropop at all

**Roxieloxie** (2): i turned in a ballot for this rate and then everyone hated it so much and it became a topic of mass conversation for one night so i just uncanonized it, but i remember not liking this one

**bulforster** (1.4): (#46) I doubt any winner of this rate was going to match up well here

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): snooze

**moonagenightmares** (1): im gonna blame americans for this

**plastichaxan** (1): Not the biggest fan of Eurovision so there were few songs that would’ve avoided the 1 here sorry

**RandomHypnotica** (0): BOOO TOMATO TOMATO

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): the true criminal in this rate. robbed like 30 songs. fiona couldn't even if she tried

**camerinian** (8.5): honestly I think MGMT would be pretty stoked with this result. The slander has been pretty relentless for this result, but like, lost amongst that is the fact it was a winner for a reason! It's a sad boy jam with an all time great riff! Yes Perfume Genius deserved and probably would have been a lot less controversial (definitely less zeroes), but like as far as men making indie bops, this is a respectable result given everything.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I'll be honest, I never understood how much hate this got for winning. What, would y'all rater have Perfume Genius here? Don't answer that. Another part of why I never got it is because this is just- kinda inoffensive? It's fine synthpop from the early 10s. If the context wasn't the Exchange Rate (which is something we should for sure bring back next year) I think this would have done a lot better. Just means we have to rate Oracular Spectacular!

## Did 2018 Indie Pop

**emayzee** (11): this is an all time favorite for me and normally i avoid listening to songs i love too much in fear of getting sick of them but with this one i never have to worry. timeless yet nostalgic, hopeful yet wistful. it's just perfect

**monalisafrank** (11): when is somebody going to make a new movie set in the indie sleaze era and have a pivotal scene set to this generation defining banger. how do they manage to make a song that has “now let’s have some fun” in the chorus still have edge?? And when they start singing about missing childhood (the definitive millennial sadness) the song reaches new heights. Can’t wait to play this for my kids and say it pretty much explains an entire era.

**moonagenightmares** (11): MGMT YOU WILL ALWAYS BE FAMOUS

**bespectacIed** (10): A depressing, spectacular (oracular, too) song that i can only associate with one of the greatest TV moments of all time, Skins S2 finale. This is always gonna be Tony and Michelle going away for college, Sid searching for Cassie in NYC, Effy on the bed staring at the camera, the iconic era ending, making way for the new generations.... Fuck, lemme cry, my teenhood is flashing before my eyes

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Wow what an iconic and well made pop song I’m sure a sub called r/popheads will totally appreciate it in this rate!

**bogo** (10): this song is great y'all are just being dramatic

**cremeebrulee** (10): this deserved to win the exchange idc xx if ur fav couldn't beat this maybe they should've made better music

**DirtyRat583** (10): soundtrack of me in the kitchen at night

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): this may be an unpopular opinion but I was happy that this won the Indieheads Exchange. Sure, anything from like #3 - #8 would have been better but this is still a fine winner. I’m just very petty, and didn’t want to see On the Floor win.

**frogaranaman** (10): y'all have let rate politics rot your brain when it comes to consuming music

**GapeCod** (10): Moment most pleasing in my rate career.

**Inner-Language8833** (10): It sounds fresh which is really hard to say nowadays, easily Top 3 songs on Oracular Spectacular

**jman457** (10): my first ever 11 win. Sorry to all the haters, argue with the wall!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): since 2018 Indie Pop flopped i need to defend my boys here

**starla\_** (10): Oracular Spectacular is one of my all time favourite albums. This is my favourite of the 3 hits on the album. It's so nostalgic and SO 2008. Also 15 year old me had an Andrew Vanwyngarden photo on my wall that I got from google images soooo

**Stryxen** (10): Tanked this in IH exchange a little for being corny and now giving it a 10 for being corny

**TiltControls** (10): Where were all the MGMT tankers when it came time to voting Tiktok songs into All Stars?!? Anyways this'll always be my favourite era of the band. Something about the bright instrumentation hits perfectly in my brain. Plus any lyrics that can pull of woeful reminiscing successfully shoot up in my rankings easily.

**Uberpigeon** (10): FUCK THE HATERS!!!!! BEST SONG EVAR

**vayyiqra** (10): Will never get over how much Popheads can seethe over a classic song by two fairly harmless dudes :joy: No matter how many times I listen to it though I will never quite get when the synth comes in and it feels off beat even though it's not and that annoys me a bit but this song still rules ! MGMT haters go pound sand !!! ahahahaha jk

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): We need to rate Oracular Spectacular NOW so I can give everything a 10

**imbaby122** (9.3): that synth melody entered my brain in 2007, got covered in layers of tissue for years, and was just dug out. i fear it will never ever leave.

**jasannn** (9): This is what being 18 felt like.

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (9): It's just so...everything. Like a mantra from outer space but there's this impossible to place human touch that keeps it from being sterile or off-putting.

**reput4tionera** (9): see if this was kids... that would be an 11 contender

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): comment

**slimboyfriend** (9): To think—if internalized homophobia didn’t exist, it would be perfume genius up here instead :(

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): im sorry everyone who doesnt like this is literally just a hater they hate as a career they hate full time

**BasedButta** (8.5): mgmt this is groovy but could be better. rookie mistake

**ImADudeDuh** (8): i mean, it is a good song

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.6): i feel like i should like this more

**itsabop** (7.5): This song is in the pilot of one of my all-time fave tv shows (go watch The Magicians gorls!!!)

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**bigbigbee** (7): Wish that r/indieheads sent us Electric Feel so that this score could be a 10 : (

**just\_thonking** (7): Somehow both underrated and overrated

**nick1372** (7): white boy(s) off the shits. also if this music video came out in 2010 it would've been my sexual awakening

**welcome2thejam** (7): Catnip to indie leaning millenials like moi

**pig-serpent** (6.5): I like older MGMT a good amount but the IHX rate had so many songs that would’ve been much better winners, most of which went out in the first 10 songs.

**seanderlust** (6.5): me when i remember this won and i decide instead to believe that sufjan won the IH exchange

**WaneLosertoc** (6): Iconic Centrist Winner. We all still cackle that this won

**Roxieloxie** (5.5): people have been screaming crying and throwing up for years over this winning and finally hearing it again?? no thoughts head empty. its not good enough to be a main character

**sarcasticsobs** (5): Don't get the hype, I don't like the vocals, never have, and I don't find the instrumental strong enough to fully make up for it. Cursed rate. Yeah Yeah Yeahs "Maps" not even in top 5? Karen O evokes more emotion from me with one "wait" than this entire song does.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): Like a lot of rate artists, sometimes an artist that I hate and others love makes me curious enough to check out their work to see if maybe they will grow on me. This has worked on me previously, like I hated Alice in Chains Dirt in IH grunge rate but now I've gotten in their other albums! Oracular Spectacular leaves me so cold, just parts of late 00s indie that I dislike so much. Yeah I was annoyed when this won the IH exchange, then gave it the concerted effort listening to this 5 times. I still hate it! So here you go. The rate that got me into rates and now I can destroy it with a 0 x

**plastichaxan** (0): This song is so annoying how the hell did it win a rate with such incredible songs is beyond me and I blame myself for giving it a 6 every day

**static_int_husp** (0): god this song is so boring and I'm still hella annoyed it won in the first place

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): i have…a lot of regrets in rates over the years. i regret not making a reddit account earlier to participate in some older rates i really liked the lineups of, i regret giving biology by girls aloud a 7 the first time it was in a rate and calling it generic, hell, i even regret arguably my most infamous moment as a rater, giving a 0 to impossible soul (although i still stand by most of my complaints of it). but none of those moments come even close to the regret i feel not being able to do the indieheads exchange rate, and giving this awful, AWFUL song the 0 it deserved and letting purfume genius get the rate win he was robbed of. it haunts my every waking moment, and i can only hope that with this 0, i will be able to give at least a little bit of repentance for what i wasnt able to do a year ago. good fucking grief

It's not a secret that I was kind of... disappointed with this winner initially, which is a bit strange considering just how much i adore all the albums in IPR, including this song, but I guess it was never quite a personal favourite, and it snuck under the radar of a lot of raters which I think made it's win all the more surprising. A year later however, it's easy to see why it won, that opening guitar riff is iconic, the song is obnoxiously infectious and it's exactly what Indie Pop Rock is at it's core, a warm, easy summery sound to make memories to. - Hypno

Nearly everyone warns you not to host a rate with albums you love, since there will never be a sequence of eliminations that’ll make sense to you. And sure enough, the IPR results have caused me irreparable, irreversible psychic damage. But I genuinely think that was undid by seeing all the comments written by people who have such fondness for this era of music. I know this flavor of indie pop gets clowned on a lot— yeah, it's a little silly and it's mostly sung by men (the horror!). But it's heartwarming to see people rediscover old favorites and relive a bygone era if only for a little bit. These songs really do hold onto nostalgia like a sponge, but they never feel completely drowned by it. Somehow the dizzying feelings they evoke in us now are both different and familiar to the feelings we got from them ten years ago. When I listen to "What You Know" now, I almost feel like I'm watching a VHS tape that's been rerecorded over, experiencing brief flashes of adolescent loneliness intercut with experiences of solitude in my mid-20s and in a post-lockdown world. Maybe calling this song universal is a reach, but its impact on a lot of you is definitely still present and is definitely what propelled this into a winning placement. - u/cremeebrulee

**camerinian** (10): This song has been a regular listen for me ever since IPR, and that was like a year ago now? What an anthem. It makes me feel like a fool for not being incredibly into this band when this sound was totally my shit at age 13. Just hook after hook after glorious hook, even if with the benefit of hindsight The Reeling was done particularly dirty.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Another song that grew on me a lot during this rate- even if this won against one of my favorite songs we've ever rated. I don't know, I think when I stopped being mad at it , I could recognize that yeah, this is indie pop rock in its roots. Some lyrics that are a bit ???, a weird video, and just a bunch of stomp and clap bombast.

## It’s my sweet beginning

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Should NOT have won over Houdini (or Little Secrets but y’all were a lost cause on that one), and I’m still mad….but it’s a 10.

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): looking back at it, this grew on me and now I think that it was a very deserving winner. Take that as you will.

**emayzee** (10): the fact that this is one of my favorite songs of all time and i can't even 11 it

**frogaranaman** (10): yeah it's fun I cannot lie

**GapeCod** (10): SOMETIMES I WANNA DISAPPEAR!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): they way I didn’t do this rate and still listened to this song and felt in love with it

**LilacDaffodils** (10): this won the first rate I ever did here so it holds a special place in my heart.

**MassiveThief** (10): This is my Mr. Brightside. I will drop everything and lose my shit whenever I hear it, at home or in public.

**monalisafrank** (10): the definition of a song I’ll play for my kids and they’ll go wtf is this their voices sound weird

**musical\_pyn** (10): I don't know what it is but I go feral for this song

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): classic

**RandomHypnotica** (10): now that enough time has passed i can say that this is kinda a spill of a winner

**starla\_** (10): 2012 me is screaming rn

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): foster the peoplecels seething over two door cinema clubchads

**thedoctordances1940** (10): i'm so sorry for what you are gonna have to go through in this rate tdcc but you absolutely deserved that rate win don't let anybody tell you otherwise

**throwaway-7650** (10): about rollin' down in the deep?

**BasedButta** (9.5): they made a good riff and knew how to use it. sometimes simple is better

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I get it now…

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): the best way to summarize how i feel about this winning is like when i asked my brother what his favorite flavor of chips were and he told me "original". like it's good, but really? out of everything?

**imbaby122** (9.3): this song makes me sick to my stomach with nostalgia it is such a visceral feeling.

**pig-serpent** (9): Ok maybe all the hipsters in my freshman year LLC were correct, this band actually slays.

**reput4tionera** (9): my family had a foreign exchange student at our house in 2016 and she was obsessed with this song

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): did we have two indieheads exchanges like what did this even win? not that I'm mad

**vayyiqra** (9): I was wondering why this won and wasn't looking forward to rating it but you know what fuck it it's pretty good

**welcome2thejam** (9): Indie pop rock heaven, two dope riffs on top of each other, that bassline, incredible chorus, what more could you want?

**1998tweety** (8.5): bops a bit

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): I underestimated how popular this band was, guess I missed their Tumblr imperial era. When the lineup was announced, I thought "really? them?" Turns out Passion Pit was the sneak all along <a:noitssad:873268482614128730> This is a bop while I’n listening to it, just easily forgotten about

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): this song has grown on me lmao

**jasannn** (8): iconic ass riff

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): wait this is slaying

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (8): The star of this track is the lead guitar, playing a high, infectious riff while the singer bleeds his voice into the backing instruments on the lower end. This lets that central riff get stuck in your head while the rest of the song secretly enters your brain. It is a Trojan Horse riff.

**Uberpigeon** (8): UGH it should not have won. i was going to zero it but i would be lying

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): My opinion on this song is basically "This won? Ok cool"

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): this feels like one of those songs i underrate and then get obsessed with months later like the time i gave Genie a 0 and now its my second favorite SNSD song

**bespectacIed** (7): good winner, this is really the sound of 2000s caucasian indie pop mania. what a time

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): about rolling down in the deep, when the pain goes numb you can call that mental freeze

**TiltControls** (6.2): Anything else in the top 10 (barring Undercover maybe) would've been 10x a better winner than this. It's an alright song, but I just don't have any of the same attachment to this track like I do the others from its rate.

**akanewasright** (6): not even the best song on the album lol

**Awkward\_King** (6): this is good music

**flava** (4): man wouldn’t it be cool if this song wasn’t annoying and sung by someone without the presence of a door nail

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): sigma male anthem???

**runaway3212** (4): this is cute but cute next to gorgeous

**jman457** (3.6): this is just early 2010’s indie rock at its worst. Just boring. And I like a lot of their other stuff.

**qazz23** (3): never liked this era of indie rock, it's too polished and sterile

**nick1372** (2.5): Pounding that guitar riff into my brain over and over again isn't gonna make me like your mediocre song dude

**WaneLosertoc** (2.5): hate this fucking band and their goddamn set up and dipshit outfits and bleak as hell sound. lowkey tests me in the same way as Be Sweet does, because both tracks are just such "wallpaper post-modern anonymity". like the main guitar riff is so utilitarian it sorta just feels like its public domain shit that's made for commerce spaces. bleakly depressing winner here, easily one of the worst of the cycle.

**sarcasticsobs** (2): I passed on this group when they were a "thing" and I will continue to do so. So not my tastes. The riff annoys me and I find the vocals grating. All points for the bass player

**plastichaxan** (1): Okay what if I don't know anything

**seanderlust** (0): I'm sorry I wanted to use my 0 and this is the one i was most caught off guard when it won

**CrimsonROSET** (6): EAPR was such a great rate, and yet- I can't say I love this winning. Yes, I'd have preferred One Last Kiss, but even another BoA song would have probably made more sense. This is again, just inoffensive- but not even in a very memorable way, and it seems the people agree. 

**camerinian** (4.5): Man, I wanted to get down with this, but I just find this catchy in the annoying way? Like, that chorus is really a brainworm and I don’t think the rest of the package does enough to give me positive feelings for it. I like the pre-chorus I suppose? But the production is inconsistent and jittery and churns through rhythms and not in a really interesting way, just a frustrating one. This never escaped day 3 for most of its run, and I can’t say I’m super surprised by that.

## Double shot

**1998tweety** (10): absolutely iconic, queen

**cremeebrulee** (10): best kpop song here and it didn't even win a kpop rate

**GapeCod** (10): I see now why One Last Kiss lost to this, I'm still a bit bitter though.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This was called as a winner literally from the first ballot that I received and true to form it held the top spot basically the entire rate, surprising the Utada fans who thought that they would sweep up the win with “One Last Kiss.” (Utada basically never won actually, Jolin spent more time at #1 than they did.) EAPR was such a fun ride and this was the perfect cherry on top, the whole rate was about celebrating legends and so this was a fitting winner because it’s just an impeccable piece of pop music that could only come from a legend. It seems like a simple song and video but that’s just because BoA, with decades in the industry behind her and star power in spades, makes its complexities feel effortless. You can’t buy that kind of confidence. [Also throwback to the janky shitpost I made to announce #1!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3Hsl9F5x5M)

**hikk** (10): someone has to give this a 10

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the people hating on this when it won were giving not like the other girls

**RandomHypnotica** (10): One Last Kiss may have deserved a win more... but i can't make this not bop

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is one of the best music videos in this rate, several of the looks here live absolutely rent fucking free in my head

**throwaway-7650** (10): us debating over the # of kpop songs in day 2:

**vayyiqra** (10): Not the winner I wanted for this rate but it does rule

**WaneLosertoc** (10): this is quickscope logic plz get me than velvet onesie i want it

**sarcasticsobs** (9.9): Petty 9.9 dispatched as Justice for "One Last Kiss", but fine, whatever, it's still too good. BoA still remains the queen of K-pop, do not interact.

**LilacDaffodils** (9.5): It would be a ten but this was the song I had stuck in my head one of the last times I saw a "friend" who ended up stalking me for two years after I broke things off so that memory is sullied a bit. Good song though.

**Saison_Marguerite** (9.2): comment

**akanewasright** (9): The way we couldn’t agree which Utada song actually deserved it and so we got stuck with this agreeably boppy but bizarre winner

**BasedButta** (9): wait this is so much groovier than i remembered. props on the instrumental! girl!

**bespectacIed** (9): BOP. Chorus gay as fuck. Deserving winner of its rate

**qazz23** (9): really catchy

**jman457** (8.7): Kaytranada is shooketh

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.7): i still think about this rate bc I went into it knowing basically nothing about any of the artists and came out a fan of all three of them by the end of it

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): it’s cute but not one of the best here

**imbaby122** (8.3): this is kids bopified club music.

**bogo** (8): it's a less slay version of 4 walls and view, but a slay nonetheless

**ImADudeDuh** (8): cute

**nick1372** (8): WHY DID SHE SHOOT THAT DUDE AT THE END OF THE MUSIC VIDEO?? MAAM THIS IS A MCDONALDS

**Stryxen** (8): its so good that its almost too smooth and refined and enters In one ear Out the other territory. ALMOST. But it toes the line with perfection and is great and excellent

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Look it’s a quite nice song but this is a rate of winners.

**reput4tionera** (7.5): more house kpop music please. i know this is barely house but it has that vibe

**anothertown** (7): this is cute but it cannot be the best of what was in that rate

**jasannn** (7): great song but one of the most boring winners

**NotWith10000Men** (7): cute bop!

**pig-serpent** (7): A good hook, but I wish the instrumental behind it was more explosive.

**runaway3212** (7): the great artist deserved

**thedoctordances1940** (7): good song but utada robbed

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): maybe if Hikki Sheena collab won we would've had EAAPR by now :(

**welcome2thejam** (7): Too bad kicking back a shot makes me look unattractive cause the taste of alcohol makes me go 😫

**bulforster** (6.8): (#19) EAPR is one my favourite rates we've done and this is a cute winner. I was honestly worried it would have grown off me but nope, still bops. Also, that bit in the choreo towards the end where the backup dancers do that wave of copying her is so satisfying.

**Verboten_Prince** (6.8): Hmm not bad

**bigbigbee** (6.5): This has definitely grown on me since EAPR, but I’m still surprised that it won! that’s the fun of rates, though! I’d be interested in seeing the BoA results among just those participants who consider themselves kpoppies, though

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.5): this just kinda follows the same route as many tracks from SM for me: polishedness to the point where it lacks any personality :/

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): I like “CAMO” more but this is fine too I guess

## Decaf

**fadedblue09** (6): man I enjoyed this rate a lot but I was not that fond of the winner

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): she tried to be so quirky with the production but she’s not slaying enough to make it work

**TiltControls** (6): I can't say I was ever expecting this as a winner. As a song it's fine, but outside the intro and the chorus I tend to forget what this song sounds like.

**dream_fighter2018** (5): this is my most scrobbled BoA song and I guess it’s because it was her first comeback that happened post me getting last.fm. Whatever I saw in it then, I don’t really see it now. It’s just “fine”.

**Hulnia** (5): i feel like i should like this more tbh

**impla77** (5): Carly’s impact

**plastichaxan** (5): It’s fine but I don’t get how this won over way better songs sorry

**Awkward_King** (4.5): am i resentful for this winning over utada and jolin perhaps a little

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (4.5): It's not bad per se, it just fails to leave an impression.

**starla_** (4.5): this is okay

**apatel27** (4): edm overrated

**monalisafrank** (3.5): didn’t hold my attention, felt like forever 21 dressing room vibes

**frogaranaman** (1): probably the most boring winner option in that rate, retrospectively

## Wait we’re not up to Dolly yet

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): invented vaccines, this is gonna get robbed but BoA is mother

**ricki** (8): this should have been used in covid vaccination ads

**WaneLietocSitsDown&TalksShop** (8.9): good christ what a rate. Yoshi Had Some Ideas with Bubblegrunge that also Asked Some Tougher Questions that included the seminal "even if you can get 90 participants to do a rate, if one album sucks so bad it's going out day 2 should we just have rated Jeff Rosentstock?". Im simply in a listening/rating space that refuses to enjoy a lot of straightforward landfill guitar rock/pop. Beths' debut is exceptional landfill but i don't get the worship. I am still baffled (and nearly died of laughter) that this ditty, which seemed like a legit shoehorn for 9.0 HOF status. FLOPPED.

**vayyiqra** (7): In hindsight I was a little too nice to this one because I didn't like two of the bands in this rate and wanted to pick an 11, but this is a good song

**Stryxen** (6): even more whelming on relisten

**Catalyst** (5): this is bubblegrunge i guess

**MassiveThief** (3): sounds like an indieheads rate winner (derogatory)

**plastichaxan** (1): Sorry this whole rate grew off me and I never got the hype for this one

**frogaranaman** (0): at least PUP had one defender there

**camerinian** (8): Crazy how this sort of song, if it had come out in like 2016, would be the sub’s absolute favourite thing ever, and yet a short half a decade later and it’s not even making it out of day one. This song is just pristine synth pop that is super evocative in the way that many of the sub’s most beloved songs are. I think there was some degree of controversy for the circumstances of this winning since it wasn’t technically part of the albums being rated, but i wouldn’t know because I don’t go out of my way to rate flops

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I HEARD Y'ALL LIKED TO YASS AND SLAY IN THIS HOUSE! God, such a fun rate, such a good reveal- such an underwhelming winner. I always prefer when an underdog comes and takes it at the end, but this was put in the rate to win it- and guess what Mimi, it did. It's not a bad song, even if I'm still #TeamBOYSHIT I can see some of the appeal. Just a but disappointed at how it came to be.

## Doin It Right

**1998tweety** (10): literal pop perfection

**akanewasright** (10): I could overshare here but let me just say “oooh pretty vocoder” and call this one of my favorite pop songs of the decade. Very close 11 contender

**bigbigbee** (10): didn’t even do this rate and this is probably gonna be in my top 5 highest played songs this year, it’s that good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I was team Ava but this song was and is pussy incarnate why lie.

**bogo** (10): the vocoder tickles my brain it's so good

**cremeebrulee** (10): i love pop music

**DirtyRat583** (10): still salty that ava didnt win but this is cute

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): coming out as a zara larsson stan </3

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): snipers will fire on anyone who tanks this

**hunnybee12** (10): a smash #1 hit in my house

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Zara Larsson put her entire talent into two songs: Lush Life and this, and for that, I thank her.

**just\_thonking** (10): Giving this a 10 now because I couldn't give it an 11 in the Yass and Slay rate due to not being able to tolerate the rest of the songs in that rate

**PhloxInvar** (10): Pretty much pop perfection. Also, Zara is fucking great dancer like she's killing these moves.

**pig-serpent** (10): The no so main pop girl rendition of Doin It Right is a smash

**RandomHypnotica** (10): vocoder can eat my ass (affectionate)

**ricki** (10): the amount of strategizing, convincing and scheming i had to do to make sure this song was on its original rate should have landed me a job at office tbh

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSSSSSSSS

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This has just kept growing on me since Not So Main Pop Girls, Zara did what she had to do

**starla\_** (10): this sounds exactly like Hold On, We're Going Home. in a good way though

**throwaway-7650** (10): my last comment is the last song. how fitting

**welcome2thejam** (10): Zara Larsson having a secret identical twin who had to tag in for All The Time is the only explanation for her putting out a stone cold classic like this

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): queen of pop

**bespectacIed** (9): she's sooo kusin for this, not quite mor yet

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): this is still a bop idc

**vayyiqra** (9): Why can't Zara simply make good music like this all the time

**imbaby122** (8.5): oh they abused that vocoder in the studio.

**itsabop** (8.5): We just do not give Miss Zara enough of the credit that she rightly deserves

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): She's so hit and miss to me it feels (he says while knowing like maybe 4 songs)

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): yeah it's a great song that deserved to win its rate but i think i listened to it a bit too much while hosting

**impla77** (8.4): this is derivative but also such a bop, I can’t help but Stan.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.2): I thought this was a Cupcakke song

**jasannn** (8): I wish Ava Max was here even though she would've been slaughtered

**monalisafrank** (8): so many great hooks on this one. Nothing groundbreaking though

**plastichaxan** (8): I wish this had a more surprising winner but it’s a great song and hosting this

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Daft Punk's lawyers should be knocking on her door any minute now...

**TiltControls** (8): I thought I might've tanked this going into this rate, but then I used a simlish version of this song for the VGI reveal and what can I say? It grew on me. Though Zara never made it to superstar status, she does a great job making me feel like it with this track. The 'breaking of the day' backing on the track is a bit silly, but it makes the track a ton of fun. I don't think I entirely got the love for Lush Life, but I get it here

**jman457** (7.5): its a fun pop song

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): honestly pretty good

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): another one i will probably end up obsessed with later

**qazz23** (7): decent hook, kinda generic

**reput4tionera** (7): white gay anthem

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.9): yall really cream yourselves over the most mediocre white girl synthpop dont you

**jsonphile** (6.5): if this is one of her best songs, I see why she never got that big in America

## Lost Your Way Tonight

**Awkward\_King** (5): quiet 10s a 5 is speaking

**bulforster** (5): (#28) slay

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (5): When the drop happens and all the other instrumentals come in for a moment at the start of the chorus, that's kinda nice. That's about it though.

**shhhneak** (4.7): I thought this was a place for winners?

**NotWith10000Men** (3.9): this is so bland

**nick1372** (3.5): This is so basic I don't get why y'all are so into it? It's annoyingly loud in the way a lot of bad kpop is.

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): I’m sorry but this is so flavourless and bland, this feels like a song you could hear clicking on any link on a fresh post with less than five upvotes.

**GapeCod** (1): I'm appalled that this has to be true, but Kim actually did it better.

**moonagenightmares** (1): how is a song this mediocre a winner of anything

**WaneLosertoc** (1): the fact that the not-so-main-pop girl rate MAY have been designed to get this to no. 1 (ITS NOT EVEN ON THE ALBUM ITS A BONUS ON THE SUMMER EDITION FFS!!!) indeed baffles me. I be straight up seeing fuck all in this song, EVEN IF eurovision macedonia wants it to place higher. this was chosen over like 3 hysterically baffling Madison Beer cuts (BOYSHIT?! A MASTERPIECE) and the transcendent dipshit anthem, Ava Max's Kings and Queens. god fucking damnit im still lowkey heated this fecker won.

**Hulnia** (0): fuck this song man… like i knew it was gonna win it’s rate but i was still disappointed anyway 💀 doesn’t help that fucking lewis capaldi basically just stole it and made it actually tolerable lmao

2021 K-Pop Essentials was the 3rd K-Pop rate in just a little over 12 months, an absolutely incredible feat on this sub I never imagined would happen so soon after I started rating. On a personal note, shoutout to my co-hosts, ratcom, and everyone else who supported this rate (especially the curators of the tracklist, y'all know who you are <3)! But not just as the host but a K-Pop fan in general, thank you to everyone who's done K-Pop rates over the years, starting from the very first girl group rate, to retirement home, to the bg rate, to smackdown earlier this year, all the way to this rate. They continue to dominate in participation and hopefully that continues in 2022 K-Pop Essentials!

Anyway, onto the winning song: it's a bit ironic that the inaugural annual K-Pop rate's winner is fully sung in English, but The Feels was absolutely one of the defining songs of K-Pop last year. It's a natural progression of the sound TWICE established in their EP from earlier in the year, Taste of Love - which Alcohol-Free is the title track of - and nobody can resist joining in the chorus choreography as the girls confess their feelings over the bouncy nu-disco production. While The Feels wasn't my preferred winner (see the comment with my score), I hope TWICE don't tank too badly in this rate. After the triple homicide in the Girl Group SMACKDOWN! rate earlier this year (which was a repeat of the original 1-2-3 punch \[going out at #4, #5, and #6 consecutively\] from the OG GG rate), their first ever rate win is fully deserved. No matter if you're a fan of TWICE or not, The Feels never fails to put a smile on your face, whether you're doing this rate, or you're in the club, or you're about to join in on random play dance... unless you're the rater who gave this a 0. Unforgiveable! - u/throwaway-7650

**CrimsonROSET** (10): YOU! HAVE! STOLEN MY HEART! Were there better songs in that rate? Maybe, but they didn’t win! I don't care for the language discourse, I don't care if this is a SM or a USUM or a SW/SH, this is a fucking BOP and I'm sad that it only leaves us with one kpop song going forward! This is so bubbly and happy, it was in day 2 for a while but sadly- just got knocked down to day 1 now. But I think it's already further than people thought it'd get.

**camerinian** (6.5): Never thought I’d be sad for this song that I’m only kinda into, but it was really solidly in day 2 until the very last ballot and a few last minute score changes pushed it down into day 1. I can totally see why y’all were into this though! The chorus is huge and it’s so bright and shiny, but it just gives me like no connection at all. Maybe the element of contention regarding the language discourse did it a bit dirty in the end, but dang.

## Filing a police report for a stolen heart

**akanewasright** (10): I feel bad for going so hard for this song when the ✨optics✨of an English song winning are so bad… but honestly this song is just so so so fucking happy and joyful and the girls all get their moment… this is a perfect kpop song, it’s just in English.

**anothertown** (10): call this BDZ how it's going to tank 🥴

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Just gonna duplicate my comment from this rate and state that this is a 3 minute 18 second long yass grenade.

**DirtyRat583** (10): special shoutout to the extremely ukcore remix of this song

**frogaranaman** (10): this won because it's Good

**ImADudeDuh** (10): [https://gfycat.com/thirstymindlessbordercollie](https://gfycat.com/thirstymindlessbordercollie)

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): a deserved win!! had to miss this rate because i was on holiday but the hosts did a great job and i’d like to say that #SPIDER\_SOTY

**PhloxInvar** (10): An impressive English k-pop song. I would say it's the best in that but I think Bewitched by PIXY has it beat, but it's no small feat to actually write really well written lyrics in English for most Korean songwrites and then the group actually perform it well, with such a groovy track too. Just excellent honestly.

**pig-serpent** (10): Crazy amounts of good vibes radiate from this song, which completely counteracts them naming a song after my least favorite 2010s slang phrase.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): they've stolen my heart what can i say

**ricki** (10): rate winners that renewed their contracts, not everyone has that x

**Roxieloxie** (10): damn! this song quite literally has stolen my heart, oh yeah. I gave this a petty 8 in its original rate and I really did not want to like it or for it to grow on me but from the very first 'boyiboyiboyiknow' I quite literally feel like im being transported HSM style to a musical scene where Im dancing with all of twice to try and impress my stunning love interest from across the room. Like i see the blue and pink lighting occupying the room. I see the glitter white outfits. i want to hate this song so much its so sugary its not even my favorite 2021 twice song but god YOU HAVE STOLEN MY HEART OH YEAH NEVER LET IT GO OH OH. I GOT ALL THE FEELS FOR SURE

**starla\_** (10): I feel so basic giving a 10 to an English-language kpop song but this is so infectiously good!!!

**Stryxen** (10): Big best song of all time energy radiating off this

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): TWICE one day you will be big in America mark my words

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I personally like having crushes, so of course I love this song, which conjures up exactly how I feel when I’m in stupid happy young puppy love.

**imbaby122** (9.1): i was literally never sad so long as this song was on my tiktok fyp, can we please bring it back. bc i don’t think i’ll ever feel happiness again.

**fadedblue09** (9): this was deserved sorry

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Slay chorus! But the verses let it down a bit- wait I’m listening to it again and they’re hitting, I take it back.

**qazz23** (9): it's just full of hooks

**throwaway-7650** (9): as someone who hosted this rate y'all were so tasteless

**vayyiqra** (9): "Ya got me good and I wanna be ya boooooooo" is the funniest shit I've ever heard but this song does rule, even if it winning a K-pop rate felt like kind of a sneak

**flava** (8.5): we love a song that references Kesha

**bogo** (8): great song whose rate i refuse to acknowledge

**cremeebrulee** (8): they're literally the only artist i would let get away with using the term "the feels"

**hunnybee12** (8): its a 10 compared to other english kpop songs but its really just ok

**jasannn** (8): It’s a great song but it feels odd to have this song to have as TWICE’s first win

**plastichaxan** (8): See some K-Pop rate winners can be good !!

**RandomHypnotica** (8): this is just so... safe

**reput4tionera** (8): this song beating the lowest score for a winning song is so

**welcome2thejam** (8): Sad news. I have been diagnosed with The Feels. There is no cure

**sarcasticsobs** (7.9): Aged a little bit for me and I want to hate it as Justice for "UNNATURAL", a song I actually return to (I'm a WJSN stan, sue me), but I cannot deny it and I'm not that petty (still a little petty though, so no 8.0 score for you)

**WaneLosertoc** (7.8): this song doesn't need to be in english. starting to think a lot of k-pop actually needs to gatekeep english speaking countries and dig in to regional quirks.

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): this is the only correct kpop winner in the past year

**BasedButta** (7.5): very basic but still okay what can i say

**dream\_fighter2018** (7.5): this is cute but it’s just a bit too simple and plain for a winners rate.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): This is just a Meghan Trainor son- gunshots

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): my bestie recently became a twice stan and this is his favorite song. hi eli if you somehow happen to browse popheads at some point in the future do the customers at starbucks like the twice pin on your nametag

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): i do really like this song but it was quite an underwhelming winner and the song is kinda underwhelming as well but also it's still fun idk

**jman457** (7.4): this was pretty good

**MassiveThief** (7): It's good... but has gotten somewhat old.

**moonagenightmares** (7): ph’s taste in kpop is too predictable

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): Eh. Still don’t see how this is the best K-pop single of 2021

**runaway3212** (7): wish this was love bomb but w/e

WinnersRate3: 
## You have stolen their day two spot

**monalisafrank** (6.5): I enjoyed this the most of the K-pop songs in the rate. Automatically loses point for using the phrase “the feels” which is so grating to me

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (6.5): It has a driving energy behind it, and it doesn't linger on any one idea too long, constantly changing up speed and tone. That makes it hard for any one part to feel like it matters, but it also keeps the attention better and it doesn't overstay its welcome.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.2): still can't believe we let this one win.

**1998tweety** (6): a sub that actually listens to kpop would never have this bland ass ENGLISH song win a kpop rate. It's not bad but whew its mid when looking at the other contenders

**letsallpoo** (6): this was the most whelming winner of all time

**nick1372** (6): I thought this was incredibly stupid at first but after repeated lessons I realized I've simply forgotten that being cheesy is TWICE's whole thing. Yeah The Feels is a stupid phrase but so is TT and that's one of the greatest k-pop songs of all time.

**bespectacIed** (5): rate pissed me off so bad i don't think i've ever done one ever since lol. This song's fiiiiine but why did it win, this isn't representative of 2021 at alllll

**impla77** (4.8): thought the chorus had started twice before it actually had

**TiltControls** (3): As someone who is fairly unknowledgeable about K-pop I really enjoy going into the rates and discovering so much new stuff. However, it also means I have no idea how things are percieved going in. Though there were a lot of amazing discoveries from this rate, I really don't remember this track. And listening to it now I'm a little unsure how this won. It's fine, but I can't pick out any element that would put this over some of the other K-pop tracks from its rate. Though it is the lowest average winner, so maybe that explains it

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): this song is fun but it's aged poorly and honestly for an english song to win that kpop rate feels so lazy. unnatural should've been here instead tbh!

**thisusernameisntlong** (2): I already wrote like a paragraph explaining why I don’t like this song

**bulforster** (1.8): (#44) This is just like those Oscars that people get because they've been snubbed in the past.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (0): this was my first rate… and seeing a song fully in english win the k-pop rate was traumatizing! wjsn my meow meows i'm so sorry that you were robbed of your rate win in broad daylight.
