New Wave Giants was the first rate idea I came up with and submitted, originally without the Go-Go's and with Talking Heads: 77 as their album because I assumed Psycho Killer was a bigger draw than Once in a Lifetime, a thought I'm just confused to ever have had now as it would have deprived this rate of both its highest averaging album and winner. This song is definitely the peak of Talking Heads' generally pretty great discography, as its 25 NWG 11s can attest. It's perhaps too good for my taste because early in the rating period my cohost Rina (u/shipperondeck) had to deal with my complaining about Once in a Lifetime gaining yet another 11 with seemingly every new ballot we got (a problem I would not have had with Kermit's Version for the record). The later ballots tightened things up with our 24th highest rated song and the rate's eventual runner up, Blondie's Heart of Glass, which made me remember I actually do love this song and it would be more than happy with it winning. It may have taken flopping out of the indieheads exchange in 8th place to get here but this song definitely deserves its place as a rate winner and our 16th highest rated song. - u/bulforster

**camerinian** (10): WHAT A COMEBACK. Let me tell you, for that early chunk of ballots where this was sitting dead last, I was beyond fuming. Yes, quirked up white boy phobia is real on the sub, but one of the most defining new wave songs of all time being last in the rate felt wrong in my soul. Thankfully the second half of the ballots saw the light and pulled it from the muck, up until the very last score change, not even the last ballot, finally pushed it out of day one. There's the explanation for if you're asking yourself, well, how did it get here

**CrimsonROSET** (5): I'll be honest, I'm afraid I never got the hype for this one. Like, everytime I'd hear about this track I was expecting something grand and that redefined the genre- but no, it's just some guy talking about his wife. This SCRAPED by to day 2 by I think 11 power, but I'm happy it's not sticking around for that much longer.

## Has beautiful house, beautiful wife

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): okay, this is my third time 11-ing this and I think I should say something philosophical or grand because the first two times my comments were jokes. Well, firstly, there are only two songs that could wrestle an 11 off of this and that’s Wuthering Heights and Enjoy the Silence. Secondly, a lot of my favourite songs are tied to emotions, events, and people. Once in a Lifetime technically doesn’t have that, while my best friend LOVES this song I’ve never solely associated it with her. My enjoyment of Once in a Lifetime is purely a vibes thing - it’s a fun, quirky song about your life passing you by. There’s no grand story about why I think it’s the third best song to ever exist, it just happens to be a song that scratches the right itch in my brain. Talking Heads just has that weird, quirked up style and sounds that are very satisfying to my neurodivergent brain, and I think that’s why this song is one of my favourites. It’s just got the magic touch

**pig-serpent** (11): Is this the best song in the rate? I’m not sure, although it is at least close. However, this is the only song I’ve given an 11 to that’s won, so I feel like I need to stick by it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): there was no other choice, this song has been a part of my life for so long i can’t even remember what i was like before it. i pretty much grew up on classic rock and new wave thanks to my parents, and while i’ve grown out of a lot of it, talking heads will always have a special place in my heart, and this song easily takes the cake for my favorite song by them. it IS the same as it ever was

**BasedButta** (10): on the chance of me sounding stupid, I just have to say I love everything about this. the choreography, lyrics, delivery, how good the song sounds, changing the singers, flow, general meaning… it’s so… art. (but basedbutta you sound stupid on every rate comment you make! - i know it’s not on purpose.)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Me passing up on an 11 win in New Wave Giants because I wanted to be quirky and 11 the Go-Go’s. A lesson in sticking with your gut folks.

**bogo** (10): i love it when men have an existential crisis over funky instruments

**frogaranaman** (10): my dad and I love this song

**Inner-Language8833** (10): In my opinion this song is the best song in this rate and is the past present and future of music. Thank you Brian Eno and Talking Heads for this masterpiece. Tina did not fail on the bass and the production kept me dancing. INSANE

**jsonphile** (10): okay so I guess I won’t give this an 11 for the third time. But it’s close i absolutely love this song. When is this song gonna go viral on tiktok? Someone make a tiktok trend with this song something with the beautiful house and beautiful wife

**monalisafrank** (10): when I listen to this I feel like I’m simultaneously romanticizing my life, recognizing the inherent banality of my life, and I’m on mushrooms

**qazz23** (10): the insanely catchy verses and chorus plus the funky and danceable sound really make this, it's a definite classic

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the first time i heard this song was in that one simpsons episode with david byrne

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I once saw David Byrne give a talk about bicycles at a church in Ottawa, it was lovely

**sarcasticsobs** (10): During the NWG rate, when looking at the Spotify plays, I thought "how the hell is this the only song I’ve heard on this record? What were my parents doing when I grew up?" Is it basic to give it a 10? Don’t care! Maybe it shouldn’t be this good!

**starla\_** (10): this was my 11 in the NWG rate, copying and pasting my comment here: this song is so ridiculous but it makes me really emotional. It really taps into feelings of insignificance and smallness and makes you realise that those feelings are just a normal part of life and time passing. Same as it ever was.

**vayyiqra** (10): This song is about the existential dread I feel every day as a man in my 30s who should be doing grownup stuff like settling down and getting married and buying a house and having kids, but instead I'm stuck in hell (Reddit). Jk I love you guys and rates are important since music is a key form of cope for me

**WaneLosertoc** (10): the fact that this almost lost to Heart of Glass is still baffling. do I need to republish my comment? i'll excerpt seymour stein's part: "On 12/8/80 I was in India. Soon after takeoff I looked at the front page of the Times of India and saw the headline: JOHN LENNON SHOT DEAD. I was shaken beyond belief. I was carrying an early Sony Walkman and had a tape of the new THs LP. Playing the album--particularly the track OIAL--over and over helped calm me down. I was staying at the lake palace. the setting of the hotel in the middle of the lake, accessible only by boat, and the lyrics of the song seemed significant Lennon and I were neighbors. I lived right across from the Dakota in the Majestic Apartments on Central Park West. I used to see John and Yoko in the neighborhood. I'll never gorget where I was the day I learned of his death and the song that helped me chill out...OIAL."

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I showed my dad (who was in college in the 80s) the tracklist for this rate and asked him which song he thought won, and he didn’t even hesitate a second before pointing to this song

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): overrated album but what a song

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): my 5th favorite Remain in Light song

**bulforster** (9.4): (#6) When this does better than time to pretend do the exchange results become non-canonical?

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): cannot describe what this is making me feel but its a high compliment

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.7): and you may find yourself doing a winner’s rate

**jman457** (8.6): an existential crisis can bop actually

**impla77** (8.1): this song freaked me out

WinnersRate3: 
**anothertown** (8): society if i knew what this was talking about

**imbaby122** (8): my little sister has 1 female in her last fm top 20 and just bought the david byrne book so unfortunately all i feel is fear when i listen to male manipulator artists like talking heads.

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (8): Talking Heads are one of those bands, acclaimed by critics and popular consensus, that just don't click with me. I think I "get" them, in that I understand their forward thinking combination of experimental, artistic ideas with punk sensibilities. They just aren't the revelation to me that they are to other people.

**Uberpigeon** (8): oh so thats why they were talking about this song in that LEG song in 2018 indie pop

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): i’m pushing all the people who give this an 11 into a locker

**nick1372** (7): mtvcore at its finest. this would go hard live btw

## MY GOD, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE???

**1998tweety** (6): well we need someone to go home first

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): i’m sure this’ll be higher if i was familiar with it before the rate :(

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): My dad likes this song

**Awkward_King** (5): david byrne is a legend in every sense of the word but this was never my favourite

**cremeebrulee** (5): overrated in a lifetime

**jasannn** (5): it's quirky I guess

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): me when the chorus came on: “oh my dad likes this song”

**plastichaxan** (5): I had this as a 1 but in my defense I kinda find that man h*t so

**ricki** (5): popheads jerking itself off to this man but shitting on jack antonoff make it make sense

**runaway3212** (5): yeah its good but is it as good as rock lobster

**shhhneak** (5): This is kinda annoying any time he’s not singing “same as it ever was.”

**Stryxen** (5): I want to be petty and tank this bcos its so overrated but I just can't hate it cos of that chorus omg. Verses can go to hell still

**throwaway-7650** (5): it's giving american dream propaganda

**ignitethephoenix** (4.5): just cause it’s groundbreaking doesn’t mean it’s that good

**reput4tionera** (4): this song terrified me as a little kid so i cannot give it a high score

**GapeCod** (1): You know it's not the same as it was

**NotWith10000Men** (1): this won???????? i knew i should have done this rate jesus christ we don't deserve blondie

**DirtyRat583** (0): i feel like a spell is being casted on me. no thank you

**hikk** (0): this shit goes on forever

## Has a hand up their ass

**Roxieloxie** (10): Kermit is a little green amphibian. Kermits living in the swamp.

**welcome2thejam** (10): I need to see David Byrne & Kermit in their big suits in the same room, please, just once I'm begging

**akanewasright** (9): kermit is my boyfriend, kermit is a frog, kermit is a little green amphibian, kermit’s living in the swamp, kermit’s in space he’s an astronaut, sweet like honey, kermit with a hat, sipping on tea cuz he loves tea, flexing like a goddamn acrobat, me and kermit vibe like that

**TiltControls** (7.7): It's a classic and has a ton of fun moments in it, but I don't know if I care for it much beyond the occasional listen. I do really love the adlibs in the verses and the chorus is pretty catchy, but if it's not the kermit version I'm not giving it a 10

Some context: When Tiktok was becoming a super strong “thing” in summer 2019, I downloaded the app and casually used it. There were some funny trends happening at the time and my friend and I always joked that I could go viral on any social media platform. So that’s what I started to do. Fast forward six months and not only did I start a trend on Tiktok and gained a couple thousand followers from it, I also made a reddit post titled “it’s probably Tiktok” and educated a few people on the app.

Naturally, I hosted the Tiktok rate. I knew from the get go that this would be a shitshow, and naturally I wanted to encourage that because it would be funny to. And boy, did y’all deliver. Entering into the rate, I knew the winner inherently (i.e. the only song people knew already before it became a Tiktok hit lmao), so I spiced it up and decided to literally not look at the results until I got every single ballot in. /u/Roxieloxie /u/TiltControls can attest to this, as we formed the August rate host coalition to keep all of us company. This was by far the funniest rate I have ever hosted and I’m really thankful for that!

The reveal didn’t go exactly as I had planned (some very serious personal life stuff occurred the weekend before the reveal and prevented me from making the reveal exactly how I wanted), but I’m glad everything turned out decently well for the rate and that the results were fun in the end. I’m meh on the winner (as you can read in my overdramatic comment), but you win some you lose some. #JUSTICEFORTHEBOX - u/frogaranaman

**camerinian** (9.5): no, you're right, this isn't in constant rotation, and no I don't think it was a perfect fit for the rate it won. But for the culture??? When we're talking about the culture??? Yes this is iconic and also, most importantly, goes hard enough to justify the stir it made. By its nature there was no way it would crack the top echelon, but shit am I glad it's here

**CrimsonROSET** (9): I don’t hate that this won its rate, and while I think it was right, I don’t think it was ok. The song itself is still as iconic as when it first came out, it was the last ‘moment’ song where the whole internet stopped to talk about it. It broke the internet.

## Certified freaks

**ImADudeDuh** (11): the way this shifted the culture forever... wow...

**bogo** (10): still baffled at how many conservatives and boomers were furious about this song, like these people were willing to completely humiliate themselves just to say how much they hate this song. shapiro man literally revealed to the entire world that he can't please his wife in an attempt to slander this and for what

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): one of my favorite memories from this year was seeing Meg open for Dua and just SCREAMING most of this song at the top of my lungs. an arena full of people just uniting to chant about WET ASS PUSSY... an experience

**cremeebrulee** (10): i can't even imagine a time before this song, like what a fucking cultural touchstone

**flava** (10): Winner Atop Podium energy

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Putting this directly after “Damn Daniel” is a setup… anyways I’ve said it before and I’ve said it again but I don’t know how I feel about this being claimed by the Tik Tok Rate (like yes I know it was a hit on there but it was also just a normal hit and it so clearly outclassed everything else in that lineup) but since it’s here I’ll 10 it.

**Hulnia** (10): we need tiktok 2 tbh

**jasannn** (10): best tik tok sound ever

**jman457** (10): this song better be put in the history books

**monalisafrank** (10): A throwback rap hit in the way it managed to shock the public when it feels like it’s impossible for music to do anymore, the way it incorporates humor, the consistently great lyrics from beginning to end, and the showmanship from both performers. And god damn, both of their flows are amazing on this track.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): EASIEST 10 OF MY LIFE

**nick1372** (10): for the love of god please listen to this [https://youtu.be/KGlYQ5SoeKE?t=121](https://youtu.be/KGlYQ5SoeKE?t=121)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the only WAP to make it to winners rate... grimes and phoenix could never

**runaway3212** (10): the world nearly ended, unfertile, dry land everywhere. Then came two women with a revolutionary idea, wet the land with their pussy juice. And just like that they saved the world

**starla\_** (10): uvula

**TiltControls** (10): She's iconic, she's giving, she's everything, etc. Both Cardi and Megan do an amazing job just making this song so much fun to listen to. So many amazing moments in the track that I can't even list them all

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I’ll never forget when my friend randomly told me one day that stirring macaroni is “what good puss sounds like” and only a few months after that WAP came out… He manifested that shit

**slimboyfriend** (9.9): yes this song is better than jolene sorry dolly

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): your honour im a freak bitch handcuffs leashes switch my wig make him feel like he cheatin put him on his knees give him something to believe in never lost a fight but im looking for a beatin in the food chain im the one that eat ya if he ate my ass he a bottom feeder big d stand for big demeanour i can make you bust before i ever meet ya if it dont hang then we cant bang you cant hurt my feelings but i like pain if you fuck me and ask whos is it when i ride the dick imma spell my name AH

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): the only cultural reset here

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): I think this was an anti-climatic winner to the TikTok rate but it’s still iconic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): this song is so good it almost makes me want to stop being asexual. almost.

**itsabop** (9.3): Cultural phenomenon what more can be said, we do stan the wet ass p-word

**1998tweety** (9): big bop but shrunk a bit \[2\]

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): cultural reset i fear…. even though stay with me should have won!!

**imbaby122** (9): this song has done more for society than any activist movement, political administration, economic development, war, technology, philanthropic endeavor, etc. etc. ever has

**NotWith10000Men** (9): ts and ps for mrs. shapiro

**emayzee** (8.7): the day this came out i already saw all the republicans having breakdowns about the title before i even got the chance to listen to it so i was like "why are they so up in arms over a fetty wap reference?"

**jsonphile** (8.5): this is in many ways a 10/10 song and I gave it an 11 last time, but I cannot live with myself if WAP has the same score as what’s going on and jolene

**impla77** (8.3): there better be a Ben Shapiro shitpost

**musical\_pyn** (8): has some perfect moments but ultimately doesn't rise above a meme song for me

**plastichaxan** (8): Peak lyricism in human history like !!

**Roxieloxie** (8): you know in a better universe this won any other rate. Like its a great song but it didnt deserve to win the tiktok rate

**Stryxen** (8): great song but like… most whelming winner possible of this rate

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): god bless headphones

**throwaway-7650** (8): I can't tank because of the lyrics/MV

**welcome2thejam** (8): Am I listening to a closed Orlando Florida water park, cause this song is Wet N Wild

**akanewasright** (7.7): iconic song, but I haven’t really listened to it or wanted to listen to it much since it was big? Like obviously that’s a me problem, but between that and it being a very out of place song in the rate it won, I’ll mark it down a little for a rate as competitive as this. Meg’s verses are impeccable though

**bespectacIed** (7): Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me

**bigbigbee** (7): Someone posted a screenshot of lyrics to a Minecraft parody of this song on discord around the height of its virality, and it’s truly one of the best Minecraft parodies I’ve ever seen. (“Your honor I’m a freak witch, potions, weakness”…like…brilliance) but ever since then, I haven’t been able to find that exact parody again (and trust me there are multiple). Pain

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Cardi's second verse in the clean version is hilarious

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Very iconic but nowhere near good enough to have robbed Stay With Me of a rate win.

**reput4tionera** (6): IT IS FUN BUT THE PRODUCTION IS SO BORING

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Sure

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (5.5): I can't shake the feeling this song gets the attention it does because it made certain people irrationally angry, and it got Ben Shapiro to admit to never getting his wife wet, so you know what? Fair enough. I say that because on its own, it's alright. Nothing too impressive, though there are some funny bars.

**PhloxInvar** (5.5): I always say I like what this song represents more than I actually. It's got some really iconic lines and it's really really fun. But ultimately I'll always say this song is still weaker than the average Cupcakke song. Also the official song also sanitizes the song with so many censors, Cupcakke would never.

**shhhneak** (5.5): The novelty’s worn off but I will stand by Cardi’s flawless writing.

**dream_fighter2018** (5): another “fine” song. I do think that this is an iconic song but I did forget that it existed at some point in early 2022, which does not bode well here where the high scorers need to be able to live rent free in my brain.

**WaneLosertoc** (5): man do i not care

**bulforster** (4.6): (#30) <mindlessly insert indieheads bodak yellow copypasta>

**BasedButta** (4): extremely boring. only good part is the guy in the background https://64.media.tumblr.com/f6ff1c48d1bb9a0cc404cf16b7f18bb5/522367971ea87e6f-53/s540x810/f85b9d2637494a7c46c05f3f31af15d2baacf916.jpg me after listening to this

**qazz23** (4): it's more fun to say WAP than listen to this

**apatel27** (2): For all the controversy this is a boring song

**vayyiqra** (2): I am tired of this song. It served its purpose, it made a bold statement, it turned Ben Shapiro into even more a laughingstock, so I respect that; but the novelty has long since worn off

**pig-serpent** (1): Not for the song itself (which is fine) or the context surrounding it (which is great) but because this song shouldn’t have been in the TikTok rate. A song by two huge names that would’ve been a smash hit if the app didn’t exist came into the amateur hour rate and smashed everything up, and I’m supposed to be happy about this?

**frogaranaman** (0): oops I lied in my host comment 

 yeah I was honestly wildly disappointed with this winning. of all the songs in that rate, it was the only one that used Tiktok as a sustaining point to its initial success rather than a launching point to its initial success. and it felt like (and fully was!) a wildly unfair advantage compared to the rest of the songs, but it was used SO MUCH that it couldn't not be included, y'know? I was just happy that "真夜中のドア / Stay With Me" was able to keep it so close for 60-ish ballots (even taking it over for some lmao). anyways vote for Tiktok 2 next cycle

**IdiotBox01** (0): one of the least sexy songs ever

Hosting 2010s Ultimate alongside u/bigbigbee and u/ReallyCreative was a true treat. These albums took me back to when I was young (I look at Animal as a coming-of-age album for my own journey) and seeing them get the re-evaluation they were due was a blast. Pop music in 2010 was gaudy and maximalist and so, SO delightful. While my personal favorite didn't win (Take It Off my beloved), Rihanna was a deserving winner with the banger S&M. It's hard to overstate how shook folks my age were hearing BDSM acknowledged in a mainstream pop song, and in a song with such gnarly synths and Rih's amazing voice? Chef's kiss. A huge thank you again to my co-hosties- thank you both for being lovely and making my first time co-hosting a rate be such a delight. ❤️ - u/seanderlust

**CrimsonROSET** (10): NANANANANANA COME ON! Putting away my ace card for two more seconds, this is the song I think of when I think of kinky sex. It's iconic, I swear this is the song that launched 'sticks and stones may break my bones' into popularity because everytime I've ever said it someone followed it up with 'but chains and whips excite you?'. It's not sultry, it's not romantic- and it's perfect to just have some fun and experiment.

**camerinian** (6): I know the album is called Loud, but like… this is very loud. I dunno, I really struggle to think of this song as the best big pop girl track of 2010. It's good but it just feels like it's missing some sort of seduction that the subject matter should entail. It's just all in your face all the time, and I get why that was, but I just don't gel with it tbh. —

## There’s some whores in this house

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come now, slut pop anthem

**anothertown** (10): a heartbreaking work of staggering genius

**ignitethephoenix** (10): smash

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the gag that this isn’t even the most sexual song in the rate

**jman457** (10): this early 2010’s pop music at its best, and the music video was iconique.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): punishment never felt so good

**reput4tionera** (10): i have a friend who only knows this song from pitch perfect

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I was a bit grumpy about the concept of rerates at first, but this was a really good and competitive matchup. The right smash hit won!

**WaneLosertoc** (10): this looked like a fun video shoot everyone left feeling relaxed

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): iconic! so glad this is her first rate win…

**imbaby122** (9.5): yass pitch perfect 🤩

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): well now I'm fine with this not being a 10 for me anymore

**BasedButta** (9): guinness world record for slayage

**PhloxInvar** (9): This song is amazing, but I would like to shoutout the nice bridge too (not to mention the existence of it in the first place, good lord knows we barely get it nowadays).

**runaway3212** (9): Lady Gaga wrote I like it rough about Rihanna

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Yeah, the iconic intro just gets ya going

**just\_thonking** (8.5): I'm too gay to rate this any lower

**starla\_** (8.5): I don't always want to listen to this but it remains a classic

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): invented hyperpop

**bespectacIed** (8): Unpopular opinion, this isn't raunchy enough.. Ester Dean slayed tho

**flava** (8): does Rihanna sell S&M here? No.. Does the song work regardless? absolutely.

**monalisafrank** (8): that drop eighteen seconds in makes me want to kick down a door. Rihanna is the only bitch on earth who could convincingly deliver the lyrics “sex in the air, I don’t care I love the smell of it.” It does get a bit repetitive and it’s not the Rihanna track from this era I’d put on at a party today.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): NA NA NA COME ON COME ON COME ON

**ricki** (8): very few songs go as hard at a gay club like this does

**TiltControls** (8): While I'm glad Rih finally got a rate win with this she has at least 20 songs in her discography I enjoy more than this. It's fun! Don't get me wrong. But in terms of listing 'Rihanna songs I enjoy' it's a little down the list for me

**Stryxen** (7.7): remembering SOS somehow lost its rate

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.2): I'm still mad this won

**GapeCod** (7): Brita Filter you will always be famous.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i think more than any other song here, this one suffers the most from just being a pretty good song in a sea of some of the greatest of all time. still a good song! but it really doesn’t deserve to be higher than the majority of others here

**welcome2thejam** (7): Goddamn they really let this play on the radio huh

## Sadists & Masochists

**Awkward_King** (6): detox and willam are in the music video for this do drag rate

**jsonphile** (6): I love Rihanna but I never cared for this one

**NotWith10000Men** (6): sorry rih rih not really one of my faves

**qazz23** (6): verses are kinda boring

**impla77** (5): Larxene teas

**shhhneak** (5): Ass Ass Ass Ass Am Am Am Am

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Only Girl robbed

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): this song may be bad but it's perfectly adequate

**bulforster** (3.6): (#35) The parts outside of the chorus are a tad limp.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3.5): Nah nah nah nah **don’t** come on, always hated this one but Willam was in the video so do Drag Rate! Anyways the other day I almost got into an altercation with the guy who sells our zoo rats because I walked in on him going on a huge rant about how much he hates liberals and he was going off about leather daddies and I was tempted to school him about the history of the community but I decided against it because I only had half an hour before I had to be at a children’s birthday party.

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (3.5): I actually like Rihanna's vocal work here, at least for the most part, but that's about it. Rather than being "scandalous" or "dangerous", it feels like a PG presentation of sadomasochism. Just risque enough for tweens to feel like they're pulling one over on their evangelical parents while not risking a censor smackdown.

**nick1372** (3): In 2022 this is just cute

**pig-serpent** (2): Rihanna singles have always been incredibly hit or miss for me, and this one is almost a total whiff, and probably her worst single pre-2012. Her vocals in the verses are very pretty but the chorus is nothing but obnoxious synth blares and shouting, and the instrumental of the verses are not at all interesting.

**moonagenightmares** (1): she knows what she did

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): “Na-na-na, come on” - my reaction to this winning its rate.

## This better not awaken anything in me…

**akanewasright** (10): my parents didn’t want me listening to pop radio, but eventually I figured out how to turn on the radio on my iPod nano and listen to the pop songs that were so scandalous. This song let me know exactly why I was banned from listening to this stuff, and I wanted more. This song is part of why I love pop music so much, and I’m glad it’s here. Tankers begone

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): why did my mom let me play this on full volume in the car with her .

**bogo** (9): how many of you sang the chorus of this song at full volume when you were younger, be honest i will not judge

**MassiveThief** (9): love it but also makes me think of m*ddle school

**dream_fighter2018** (8): I’ve told the story about my learning all the words to this at like 9, and I’m gonna repeat it. When I was nine, my mum brought a CD of LOUD and she played it so much that I learnt all the words to S&M. Now, I didn’t know what S&M was so I’d just innocently sing “sticks and stones might break my bones but chains and whips excite me”, and one day I did in the car and my mum was so mortified that she threw away the CD soon after.

**plastichaxan** (8): I listened to this way too young maybe I’d be a different person if I hadn’t

## This better not awaken anything in you…

**vayyiqra** (8): Yeah it's a dark club banger and all but I'm a little weirded out how most of you were children when it was released

Though Simple and Clean's presence in the rate was up to debate at the start, its dominance never really was. Past the first 3 or 4 ballots I don't think it ever lost the top spot and it had a sizable lead over whatever tracks held second during its reign (I think Portal 99% of the time). I absolutely loved hosting this rate, though in hindsight 4 and a half hours of video game songs might've been a bit too much. And the voted in section was so strong it probably could've made half the list instead of a quarter (something fixed with VGI!) But everything from the theming to the banners to finding [cursed interludes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-2qIdFs7_A) to the [last minute unhinged shitposts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvXHVl1BXl4) was so much fun to work with and I'm glad I got another go at it with VGI! - u/TiltControls

—

**CrimsonROSET** (10): What the fuck was I on to not give this a 10 in VGV? Their voice is just so immaculate throughout the track, and there's a reason that this just stuck out as the iconic track for Kingdom Hearts, a franchise I've honestly never played yet could probably tell you the plot more than some people that have!

**camerinian** (7.5): I really like this as a specific mood piece for the Kingdom Hearts series, and I totally get why it won its rate because of it because as a theme song it’s dramatic and legendary, but on its own? Ehh, I don’t really have a whole lot of use for it. It’s huge, portentous, heartbreaking, and maybe just a bit too much?

## Organisation XI

**akanewasright** (11): The first song I heard from Utada, who I now consider one of my favorite artists <3 I was overjoyed when this won its rate, and it’s probably one of my favorite rate wins

**exciting\_patient4872** (11): Don't get me wrong, I love you.

## Gummy ship captains

**1998tweety** (10): iconic bop although I must admit I prefer the remix

**anothertown** (10): this is watch mojo with the top 10 most fucked insane opening bars in music history

**Awkward\_King** (10): i am one of these things

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Love this song to absolute death, but why does Goofy walk on two legs and participate in society while Pluto is a pet?

**frogaranaman** (10): yassss

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this was one of three good songs in the rate (other others being K/DA and Jump Up Super Star)

**impla77** (10): best song to listen to as your island is being enveloped by darkness

**RandomHypnotica** (10): idk what the fuck they are talking about but i will be singing it on the streets crying my eyes out

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): #HikkiHive

**sarcasticsobs** (10): \[distant sobbing\]

**seanderlust** (10): idc idc this song goes hard as hell

**shhhneak** (10): The video game rate winner we're actually going to acknowledge.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): crazy how a song by a singer i don’t really care for off the soundtrack of a game i never played is the best song of all time

**TiltControls** (10): Though its presence in the rate was up to debate at the start, its dominance never really was. Past the first 3 or 4 ballots I don't think it ever lost the top spot and it had a sizable lead over whatever tracks held second during its reign (I think Portal 99% of the time). I don't know how much of it is just nostalgia, but Utada absolutely kills this track. Their voice during the chorus knows exactly when to rise to hit that seratonin button for me. And that final verse with the elevated 'Hooold me. Whatever lies beyond this morning'... perfection. I absolutely loved hosting this rate, though in hindsight 4 and a half hours of video game songs might've been a bit too much. And the voted in section was so strong it probably could've made half the list instead of a quarter (something fixed with VGI!) But everything from the theming to the banners to finding cursed interludes to the last minute unhinged shitposts was so much fun to work with and I'm glad I got another go at it with VGI!

**bespectacIed** (9.5): they were sooo parent for this

**pig-serpent** (9.5): I honestly didn’t really get this song at the time of the rate, but going back I just got incredibly into it.

**starla\_** (9.5): the energy in this song is amazing

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): where bad mode rate

**imbaby122** (9.2): utada you will always be famous!!!!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.1): Sorry for demoting my score I just realized I scaled my scoring very differently for the video game rate than I do for normal rates

**BasedButta** (9): wtf this is actually really great, awesome instrumentation. this from that donald duck game?

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this is what Concrete Angle tried to do

**itsabop** (9): Wow I've never heard the full version of this before, but we have to stan bc Kingdom Hearts

**throwaway-7650** (9): utada should have a japanese song here

**vayyiqra** (9): I want to give more 10s to Hikki, but this isn't one of my favourite songs by her, but it's still pretty good

**emayzee** (8.3): "the future doesn't scare me at all" god i wish that were me

**jman457** (8.2): this song just has a warm feeling to it

**plastichaxan** (8): The way it took me so long to remember what this won dsfkkfsj but slay

**Roxieloxie** (8): solidarity with the gamer (akane) community

**Stryxen** (8): hikki lyrics are camp personified and these are no explanation

**WaneLosertoc** (7.8): its aight

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.5): can't tank monarch utada… this would've been a 4 if it was sung by anyone else.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): i mean undeniable but also not my fave

**monalisafrank** (7): absolutely love her voice, but don’t love the melody

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): I know the original version is the one that won whatever rate this originally appeared in, but the PlanitB Remix is by far the superior version and would definitely be a 10.

**qazz23** (7): song title checks out

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I love video games! I’m so glad this rate finally happened!

## Gawrsh

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Always found this one to be a bit messy tbh, I’ve scored it around this much every single time we’ve rated it… like there were so many songs in VGV with a higher ratio of slay that I can’t bring myself to be excited about this one. Also after my dog died I streamed “Face My Fears” a lot so in my eyes that’s now the best Kingdom Hearts song.

**reput4tionera** (6): my friends tried to get me into them and it is just not happening

**runaway3212** (6): yeah I kinda hate this but I also love the vibes

**sufjancaesar** (6): Didn’t love this and maybe it’s because I‘ve never played Kingdom Hearts

**welcome2thejam** (6): One of the few winners I'm actually scoring higher than I did in its own rate. Still not connecting as much as I'd hope, but becoming a bit more familiar with her music helps

**just\_thonking** (5.5): Yeah their voice still isn't my favorite but maybe this will grow on me with time

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.5): I was SO ready to like this! Winner of a rate that I would consider very stacked, and from an artist I like? But sorry this walked into my mind and we didn't connect like we shared the same emotion

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (5): This song is basically true neutral to me. Not offensive in the slightest. But not really at all interesting either. Her voice is good though.

**ricki** (5): all i can think of is the “evil utada hikaru be like difficult and dirty” meme

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): it’s too simple and clean tbh

**MoonlightByWindow** (3.5): was waiting for this to end no shade

**apatel27** (3): Easily one of their worst songs

**nick1372** (1.5): The vocals and instrumentals are far too overblown for a song called Clean and Simple. Give this to Dolly Parton and make it a sweet country song and I think I would like it a lot.

**bulforster** (1.2): (#47) Yeah I don't get this at all, let's rate bad mode next year so I can make up for this

**moonagenightmares** (1): disney princess movie type of song

My first rate as a solo host and man, what a fun one this was! I loved all three albums in this rate, but I kind of also knew the results already as well. Tyler sweeps, BROCKHAMPTON flops, Mac sneaks by. But I didn’t realize how much of a wipeout this would be. There were long stretches where Tyler had the entire top ten to himself (Midnights WHO), and honestly it was kind of deserved.

I’m also particularly proud of this reveal; we still were in the plug.dj era (one of the last rates to have it?) and I was particularly lazy about making my own videos (i.e. too lazy to pirate / buy proper software) so I went old school with it, leaning hard into the educational bit and taking everyone to Pollen U. Besides the grand finale (capstone class?) of the reveal, I think my favorite memory of it was when I couldn’t remember how to skip videos and the first educational video I had was a 1.5 hour documentary on space and we ended up watching like 7 minutes of it because I couldn’t figure it out. 💀 Love this rate dearly! - u/frogaranaman 

—

**CrimsonROSET** (9): Infamously, Igor was never an album that clicked with me- especially in the context for Pollen, where both other artists were much more my vein. But this was always a highlight for me, so I was somewhat happy to see it pull through- and I think it more than holds up when next to the other winners! It's got hooks for days, their voices together sound immaculate, and it's just fun to sing along to! Four! Four! Four! Four!

**camerinian** (7): kinda crazy to think that this was the rate winner for Igor when like half of the album has gone viral on TikTok in the time since and this track wasn't one of them. I do like it, the lo-fi groove and the interplay between Tyler and Solange is great, but I just think it's missing something, like a crescendo or more of an edge, to keep it from my favourites. —

## I think I’ve fallen in love

**Awkward\_King** (10): this was the first tyler song that really clicked with me, and while its nowhere near my favourite anymore its still such a perfect song.

**frogaranaman** (10): I had SO much fun hosting this rate, and although it wasn't the top ten sweep it was shaping up to be until the last day of extensions, I was so happy with the result. congrats to all the Pollen U graduates btw

**GapeCod** (10): This coming right after TDCC in the ballot is so funny because I know that both IPR hosts hate that this won Pollen, but they can cope and seethe tbh 🥰

**qazz23** (10): love Solange's vocals, the bridge, and the piano outro

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I didn’t do this rate but I really like this!

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): while listening to this I raised my score for this from a 4.5 to a 6 to an 8 to a 10. on a relisten I don’t know if I would give it a 10 again but right now I’m feeling like a confused yass grenade

**throwaway-7650** (10): my fave (re)discovery, need to relisten to IGOR

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): In love with this beat

**akanewasright** (9.4): this was a weird ass winner, but this whole album deserved so much… if this was gone, gone I’d have 11d it

**imbaby122** (9.2): the synths r so popheads core.

**bigbigbee** (9): I want to again give props again to Pollen host frogaranaman; it was one of my first rates, and it’s remained one of my favorites. The vibes in plug.dj every time a new video about how to make sugar played, only for it inevitably be another fakeout as Brockhampton slipped by yet another slot, were absolutely unhinged.

**Inner-Language8833** (9): I think I'm falling in love with this song

**monalisafrank** (9): vibey, original, groovy- what you can always count on from Tyler. Not showstopping enough to be a ten for me.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): i still think flower boy shits all over igor sawry but this song is great

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (9): Goddamn Igor is good. Also, it's a shame Solange isn't in this rate.

**runaway3212** (9): We love tyler here

**starla\_** (9): I literally wrote 'Tyler is so creative' completely unironically. I'm just gonna leave it at that

**Stryxen** (9): probably like my 5th pick for winner in that lineup. But when the final chorus hits. Omg yeah this still deserved the win

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Ugh the bridge reminds me of a video game but I can't place it

**WaneLosertoc** (9): banger

**welcome2thejam** (9): The drop coming back from the bridge got me dancing rn I don't care who knows

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): ooooh this is making me tingle, especially that second half

**anothertown** (8.5): for 1000 USD, i won't compare this to earfquake. buy my silence

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): this rate was before I started doing rates and ngl looking back at results i was very surprised to find out this won. Like it's great, so much of the album is, but I wouldn't have guessed this as the winner from Igor

**1998tweety** (8): bops a bit

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): I think this works best in the context of the album, but it’s still a good song on its own

**ImADudeDuh** (8): eight

**jman457** (8): I like

**MassiveThief** (8): Not my pick for best song on IGOR but definitely great

**reput4tionera** (8): have never successfully gotten into tyler the creator but this is fun

**sufjancaesar** (8): Honestly shocked this beat some other songs on IGOR

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): well i think that earfquake deserved to be here more

**pig-serpent** (7.5): At first glance a weird choice for a winner from this rate, but the groove is impeccable and there’s some really cool bass work going on in this song.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): The melody is quite nice but Tyler I can barely hear you.

**fadedblue09** (7): Well this was better than most of Call Me When I Get Lost

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Tweety Bird when he taw a puddy tat

**nick1372** (7): This instrumental is very cool but there are better songs on this album.

**ricki** (7): the next logical conclusion is that therefore you are

**Uberpigeon** (7): why did THIS win its rate

**vayyiqra** (7): Never heard this before but it's okay

**TiltControls** (6.7): It's solid, but I would've preferred either of the other Tyler songs to win over this one. It just doesn't grab my attention all that much

**seanderlust** (6.5): me starting any sentence that communicates any information even when i am 100% sure i'm right

**impla77** (6): is this just a subliminal ad for skate 4

## Hater comments cannot be transcribed

**moonagenightmares** (5.7): god i loved this album so much upon release and i havent streamed it since

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.5): why did this win when a boy is a gun was right there???

**bespectacIed** (5): dgaf about this rate but how is this the song from igor that won

**plastichaxan** (5): I don't like thinking

**RandomHypnotica** (5): still fucking fuming at this one

**bulforster** (4.2): (#32) I should probably get into Igor huh

**cremeebrulee** (4): if he didn't want me to give it a 4, why'd he say it so much

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): beginning sounds like it's gonna segue into Fergalicious which is sad bc that's a much better song

Ahh my first rate hosting stint….on one hand, I was honored to be picked but at the same seeing all the slander towards the best song ever (Milkshake) and the rest of Tasty was…traumatising. On top of that, I felt mildly annoyed with how most of the rating community was so smug and sure Aaliyah was winning (when in reality she held the spot for one hot minute lol).

Even though it's like my third favorite on the album, a part of me began to root for Full Moon, especially after u/OliviaGodrigo called this song a "victory lap" in their comments. As a longtime rater, I like rate winners that subvert my expectations, and I couldn't be prouder to host one myself. - u/fadedblue09

**camerinian** (9): man this song is so dreamy. I'll admit outside of The Boy Is Mine I know next to nothing from Brandy, but the vibes on this are simply immaculate. It's pretty rare for this sort of lowkey rnb jam to ever escape into day 3 in a rate like this, but I seriously think it deserved

**CrimsonROSET** (7): It’s still funny how we basically did that rate for Aaliyah yet she didn’t walk out of it with the win. Not that i think it’s undeserved, because this is such a good tune. Brandy’s voice is so smooth, I imagine it for a sultry intimate moment but also just for a chill time watching the moonfall.

## Werewolves

**fadedblue09** (11): This winning was a like a middle finger to all the raters who were so smug and sure Aaliyah was winning

**bogo** (10): the citizens of clock town on the first day be like

**Catalyst** (10): gurl…..what. A. RATE. I remember waking up to u/KappyKo telling me my rates flopped as usual only ask if I wanted to host the Futuristic R&B rate! Have I already reminded yall how much this rate meant to me? Too bad cuz IMMA SAY IT AGAIN. Being an Aaliyah stan and marking my rate debut with her was truly a dream come true and having a rate involving Aaliyah/Brandy was FAR overdue and it's about time that these two Queens finally got their flowers. As much as I wanted Aaliyah to win, the more I listened to Full Moon, the more I felt like it would win (and it did!). Brandy struck gold with this album and this song was the impetus of it all. Every rhythm, every note and harmony this track has was painstakingly recorded to the point of perfection. The chorus alone had Brandy repeated 16 different times just to get that perfect note and rhythm each time! This song and album is the very reason why she's called the vocal bible.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this originated the mother lake

**GapeCod** (10): Yeah, I must give this album a proper listen now, don't I?

**nick1372** (10): Personally it usually takes me a few listens to latch onto an R&B song but not this one. Great from the first listen.

**qazz23** (10): her voice sounds amazing

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This was one of the most memorable upsets in recent rate history. I love Try Again but it’s kind THE theme song of All-Stars so I’m glad this won instead

**sarcasticsobs** (10): 4 minutes feels too short tbh, gimme more!!

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): Wasn't my favorite Brandy song but like I cheered when it won

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): well the outro doesn't work outside of the album at all

**akanewasright** (9.5): MAN this was a cool rate win but we need one in a million to win next 👀

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): ugh one of these days i need to sit down and have a brandy binge bc everything i've heard is soooo gorgeous

**1998tweety** (9): ended Twilight

**Awkward\_King** (9): *just transformed into a werewolf voice* my culture is not a costume brandy

**bespectacIed** (9): production goes harddd. ahead of its time while still sounding like a product of its time, like how.

**jsonphile** (9): Brandy is such a great singer they wrote a song about her in the 70s. Such a fine girl. What a good wife she would be

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Looove this one

**Stryxen** (9): it's grown off me just the tiniest amount but still gorgeous

**vayyiqra** (9): I love the instrumental melodies to this so much; listen closely to it please

**shhhneak** (8.7): Got halfway through this rate but couldn’t submit my ballot in time. This is absolutely the correct winner.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): It took us WAY too long to rate a Brandy album like omg… still a little bit pissed off about how the ballads were treated in this rate but I’m glad Brandy got the last laugh in the end. She doesn’t get enough credit for being a teen queen back in the day and I think it’s because she transitioned so gracefully into more mature music that people kind of forget about that era, and this song is a perfect showcase of that. Like, objectively it’s a “let’s flirt in the club song” but it’s presented with such masterful storytelling and sonics (and a touch of edge) that it becomes something even more. Please vote for the ‘90s Black Blockbusters Rate so “Sittin’ Up In My Room” can have her moment too!

**jasannn** (8.5): more midnight than midnights

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): wow this is great

**starla\_** (8.5): her voice gives me chills

**imbaby122** (8.3): #bringbackhorns

**itsabop** (8.3): This early aughts realness...and omg I loved that trend of having phone calls/voicemails at the end of the track

**jman457** (8.2): her and Caitlyn jenner make an iconic duo

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Being a baby and knocking off a point for the outro. A slay otherwise.

**flava** (8): very thankful this is here and not the other song that I will hopefully never have to deal with again

**plastichaxan** (8): This was an unexpected winner to me like wow good for her let me support that

**RandomHypnotica** (8): such an iconic win honestly

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): yep this song was made in 2002 alright

**WaneLosertoc** (8): song: the song

**welcome2thejam** (8): Cozy, a cuddle with your lover in front of a fireplace type of bop

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.8): It's fine, definitely not the one I would have chosen but whatevs

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I just find this song pretty boring and it doesn’t show off Brandy’s talents as well as other songs. I was disappointed that it won over so many other songs in this rate.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I still have no idea how this won originally

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the really quiet synthy horn(?) under her words on the chorus is really cool

**Roxieloxie** (7): did we all just ignore the fact that someone linked markiplier selfcest in the original comments when this won??

**seanderlust** (7): the fact that there is unnecessary skit representation in W3

**ricki** (6): loona’s cover of sunmi’s full moon outfullmooned

**TiltControls** (6): I had a fairly high average for this rate from what I remember, but this track was not up there. It leaves me feeling like I'm missing something. I really enjoyed the Brandy album so hopefully she does well in Winners, but this song lacks much feeling for me so I can't really give it a bit score than this.

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (5.5): I appreciate how the whole track has a very "nighttime" vibe. But it just doesn't have enough ideas or explores the ones it has well enough.

**monalisafrank** (4.5): doesn’t pass the test of time to me. makes me feel nostalgic for this era of rnb but nothing more.

**DirtyRat583** (4): aaliyah didnt die for u to treat her like shit and give this flop the win! have you no respect??

**runaway3212** (3): just so dreadfully boring

**bulforster** (2.8): (#39) I love never say never but full moon has never clicked for me. This is one of the best songs on the album but I still don't love it, the way her vocals are so drawn out makes the song feel really flat and hazy in a not good way.

**WaneLietocSitsDown&TalksShop** (7.8): as my SLTS implies, some rates just feel tailored to get a song into the HoF/win. I can't fault Darj for this, because she worked and typed and researched and defended and considered, etc. her ASS off for this rate. She's y'alls best host because she leverages her information needs to get you to consider shit you wouldn't. SO WHY NOT rate the 1990 reissue that collects this seminal 7"? we weren't gonna do a rate of Rhino's UK DIY indie punk CDs and truly, you just have to cast your fate when you can. rock on darj. I def considered giving it a 0 but the song truly is 0-proof. I considered an 11 but for as anthemic as it is, this isn't my anthem exactly. I settled at a 5.5 (lowest score) on a "canonical" technicality that I patented. This allowed me to 0 a bad brains song for a good laugh. Today, im giving it a 7.8 reflecting my album average for GFA. it's a 10/10 punk story that just sonically doesn't hit me like it should.

**MK** (2): ddr I'm so sorry but there was very little I liked about this, I tried </3

Upon Nurture's release I really did not expect to even get the chance to include it in a rate. Porter was never a huge name on the sub, with the general distaste for EDM and all, as well as the continued floppage of the EDM Cult Faves rate idea with Worlds, so I figured it would just remain unrated for the rest of eternity. I initially pitched Nurture/Mercurial World/Screen Violence as something of a joke, with the concept just being "hikk-core", but regardless of the difference in opinion on Screen Violence I think it really worked, especially with the later inclusion of Civilisation tying the electronic-pop-internet-core theme together. Many a debate was had in the #rates channel about whether or not this idea was good but despite all that it actually ended up happening. My main goal of getting to rate Nurture shockingly panned out, and now I was ready to see misandry strike in full force and for Mercurial World to sweep all the way through... but as the ballots came in, Nurture held its own incredibly well, and there was barely any time in which one of its songs was not winning. I gave my 11 to Look at the Sky but Musician is also a fantastic song and I could not have been happier when it got the win. I don't really expect it to do well here, as we expand the audience away from terminally online losers that like this kind of music to the more general Popheads crowd, but maybe I'll be surprised again, who knows! I'm still just ecstatic that it's here in the first place. - u/hikkaru

**CrimsonROSET** (11): You'd think, picking this as my 11 of all 11s, as the best song in this line up of all winners, I'd have much to say about it. And I do! But I'm struggling to put it into words. I was always aware of Porter, especially because he's pretty good friends with another of my favorite artists (stream Good Faith for clear skin) but I never looked much into his stuff. Then, Nurture came out and I decided 'oh, why not'. And then I just had the most unexpected hour cry session. Things were a bit rough for me back then, but especially relating to just- art in general. Many may know I'm a graphic design major, and while I absolutely love it, having your entire future be dedicated on your creativity and ideas is very scary- especially with something so subjective. I didn't think I had so much baggage relating to it as I did- but then 'we do it for the feeling, how do you make music? you face your fears and become your heroes' played and it just- I'm not going to say it gave me the confidence boost I needed, but it was just so good to hear. I'm doing this because I fucking love art. Bad times will come, but- you'll get there. I fucking love this song.

**camerinian** (8.5): shoutout to Rona. I wish I clicked more with that Porter album, but this is such an exciting standout. It has such a kaleidoscopic energy where it feels like it's channeling the whole spectrum of emotion all at once  and it can be overwhelming, but here it pulls together beautifully —

## Faced fears, became their heroes

**DefaultPophead** (11): This rate this song belonged to changed my life. I couldn't give top honours to anyone else.

**hikk** (11): even getting to rate nurture was such a moment i was so gagged when it actually won

**seanderlust** (11): I can't even explain this one. I know this would be an odd addition to the hall of fame but these synths feel so warm and this feeling is one I've felt so acutely over the past couple years. it's meaningful for me, thus it gets my winners 11

**vayyiqra** (11): I am in my happy place listening to this song. Not many artists make me feel like they "get it" the way Porter does. (He just like me fr fr.) Whenever I'm feeling down I often put my headphones on and put on this album and right away begin to feel better. I may be a severely depressed guy but his music makes me feel better and for that he rules. I wish him nothing but happiness, he deserves it : )

**1998tweety** (10): devoured

**Awkward\_King** (10): this song is daytime in its purest form. i can think of few songs that give me as much serotonin its just pure light and joy

**bigbigbee** (10): it will be SO embarrassing if this song is #1 on my spotify wrapped this year too

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Kind of the clit of this lineup???

**flava** (10): one of the trainers at my gym has this song on one of her playlists and whenever i attend one of her classes this song always comes on. And I never made the connection that the song was Musician until I was doing the rate.

**frogaranaman** (10): king

**ImADudeDuh** (10): when this beat Ker0 Ker0 B0n1t0, we love to see it.

**monalisafrank** (10): this album gives me such a sense of hope. Also this particular track hits different when you’ve spent years of your life working 80+ hours per week on your dream

**pig-serpent** (10): I may have had a lot of qualms with how this rate turned out, but this song winning was not one of them.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): never before has there been such a tasteful winner, they tried to take him down but we were too unstoppable (probably not here though...)

**reput4tionera** (10): finding out that kero kero bonito was on this song made me listen to it and now nurture was one of my fav albums of last year

**ricki** (10): the closest ill allow us to get to anime rate<3

**Roxieloxie** (10): Porter really is ever so slightly owl city coded which makes sense because the lines of this are really hitting me as im typing this in a way that I think an early Ocean Eyes or ATBAB song would. I wanted to do this rate cause I enjoyed but not got arround to it

**runaway3212** (10): this has grown on me a lot

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Another unexpected winner but well deserved. I feel this song in my soul because I have always wanted to go after music, but have been holding myself back because of the perception that other people in my life think my calling should be somewhere else. Now I realize life’s too short to not do what makes you happy out of fear of judgment

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I am not at all lying when I say this song (and album as a whole) made me transgender

**Stryxen** (10): gagged at this winning but so well deserved

**sufjancaesar** (10): Will definitely be checking Porter Robinson out after this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): if you havent lied down on your bed and cried to this song at least once you’re just not experiencing music the way you should

**thedoctordances1940** (10): a rare score i'm raising for this rate. idk i just can't not give porter a 10, especially considering i'm not expecting him to do that well

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): few other songs can both bop so hard on a surface level and then bop even harder on an emotional level. dunno if this is a repeat comment from the epop rate but when you make the word “sincerely” sound sincere in a song then you are doing just fine

**TiltControls** (10): Nurture was my album of the year last year (and one of my favourites of all time now), but I was expecting either KKB or Mag Bay to absolutely sweep. I'm so glad that Porter managed to pull out the win against what I expected from Popheads. Almost anything on this album could be here and still get a 10, and Musician is among them. Despite the electronicness that Porter wields, he's never had any issue expressing emotion through his vocal stylings. And this one is just such a joy to listen to that it never has me stop smiling. I hope this continues to surprise me and make it far, but I'm just glad we can call it a winner regardless.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Gonna need a space shuttle to bring me down cause I am ascending

WinnersRate3: **bogo** (9.9): docking 0.1 off this for petty reasons

**imbaby122** (9.8): this song is so relatable i can actually feel my brain and this song on the same wavelength when i listen to it. i have yet to decide whether it is a good feeling or not.

**bespectacIed** (9.5): such a fun rate with an anticlimactic win, never thought this would win. Justice for Something Comforting aka the greatest EDM song of the 21st century. This is still a great song tho

**nick1372** (9.5): Porter is so good at making robotic voices sound so much more emotional than natural human ones how does he do it?

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): VOTE FOR ANIME (yw u/CrimsonROSET)

**WaneLosertoc** (9.1): "??????" like yeah lowkey a good left field winner but also "??????". maybe its too euphoric for me! the video whips though and moves this from an 8.9 to a 9.1

**akanewasright** (9): I did this rate at a point when I was kind of over my initial excitement with Mercurial World, and as much as I love Civilisation, it just didn’t feel quite right to 11 anything from there, despite having all the Civ II songs as contenders. Chvrches was never in the 11 conversation. What I’m saying is that I fell in love with this song during the Rate period and almost 11d it, and while I pivoted eventually, this is still a really lovely one that I’m glad won

**jasannn** (9): another case where I didn't fully appreciate this song until it won and then I overplayed it

**MassiveThief** (9): big porter stan

**PhloxInvar** (9): I did a fucking 180. Possibly the biggest score change I've ever done. This was originally a 1, but everything has clicked and THIS SONG IS SO GOOD. That cheeky melody into the fire bridge (insert the headbanging Izuku here).

**just_thonking** (8): I wanted to tank this song for what it did to MagBae but then I referenced it in one of my law school applications, so here I am

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (8): Much of what I've heard from Porter Robinson reminds of those free edm songs in Youtube compilations like Monstercat, but more professionally made. They have that same DIY feel but with Robinson's expert production skills.**cloudbustingmp3** (7.3): magbay robbed but its partly my own fault for not sending scores

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.3): therapeutic bleep bloop sounds my beloved!

**bulforster** (7): (#18) This really clicked for me when I started listening to it on my morning commute after starting a new job. Who'd have thought I would start to get the touching grass album when I stopped being a nocturnal hermit?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is cute lyrically but I’ve listened to it like six times and I still can’t remember what it sounds like

**sarcasticsobs** (7): Fine-to-good. Don't really get the hype. Porter should really work for me, but outside of some standalone songs that really click, I just can't connect. Bummer for me I guess
## Freaking out

**BasedButta** (6): sooo repetitive. but it’s not too bad

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): really don't get this type of electronic pop sorry

**musical_pyn** (6): fun fact I didn't end up submitting scores for this rate because I had a sub-5 average for nurture and that was after being generous

**Uberpigeon** (6): its like a passion pit song if he somehow was worse at singing and it takes me out a bit

**Verboten_Prince** (6): You're telling me a MAN actually won a mixed gender popheads rate? With THIS?

**ignitethephoenix** (5): this song is relatable about burn out but also it’s just annoying

**shhhneak** (4): CHVRCHES sends their regards.

**starla_** (3.5): popheadscore

**dream_fighter2018** (3): now, this song means a lot to people who I greatly appreciate, and I think that meant I was afraid to be critical in the original rate. But while I acknowledge that it is a song that is meant to be meaningful and that I greatly admire Porter for daring to be vulnerable, it just doesn’t click with me. Firstly, and my most minor gripe, is that the instrumentation is just too clean. I like stuff that’s messy, gritty, and not stuff that’s glossy sounding like Musician. Secondly, I do appreciate the sentiment but I think that I don’t really relate to it and that means that the song doesn’t really “click”. There’s a lot of other songs that have been able to reach me on an emotional level in ways that feel a lot more relatable and familiar to me than Musician, and therefore I’m not as impressed as I could be by this song. I’ve done a lot of reading around Nurture, and I think that I’ve come to a reasonable conclusion when it comes to my own feelings around this song. Again, I do appreciate that this song means a lot to others but I just don’t get it. At all.

**fadedblue09** (1): this rate was…something

**GapeCod** (1): I've seen raters get away with snarky comments that don't explain their low scores whatsoever, but I'll just say that I've actively disliked *everything* that I've had to hear from Porter. I still regret giving Shelter a 9 out of peer pressure, but that doesn't factor into this score.

**NotWith10000Men** (1): porter wagoner outsold and he's not even that good

**plastichaxan** (1): I really don’t like this as a winner lol sorry weebesties

**jman457** (0): y’all dickride this album so much and it just sounds royalty free music outside of a few songs. This is Popheads “emperor’s new clothes”.

**OliviaGodrigo** (0): These vocals are atrocious

the way this rate was honestly a fever dream...like it kinda slipped my mind fr. i would like to say mago winning was completely well-deserved (though it would've been very fun if fromis won!!) and WE MISS YOU GODFRIEND. i still giggle when i think about blackpink getting the bottom 3 like that was truly one for the history books. this having as many participants as it did was also kinda shocking as i expected it to get a lot but not That Many so thank you to everyone who filled out a ballot ❤️ i'd also like to thank my cohosties belb (again) and ricki u/rickikardashian as they both put their blood sweat and tears (slaps knee) into hosting and ricki especially worked tirelessly to make the most slayful gif banners!! so thank u ❤️ - u/MoonlightByWindow

**CrimsonROSET** (9): YES YOU! I guess I just love a call and response but this is absolutely infectious to me! Y’all better respect the dead!

**camerinian** (8.5): easily my favourite of the K-Pop tracks in this rate, and honestly it’s only grown on me since I locked this score in so maybe its placement is partly on me. The production has a whole lot of punch but there’s also so much elegance in the string and synth lines, and the amount of hooks they stack into that chorus is ridiculous. Incredible, this is a group that I was so ready to get behind and of course they’ve broken up.

## Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today

**1998tweety** (11): Absolute pop perfection, probably the group with the BEST disbandment song.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (11): they disbanded when they was at their peak, after giving us their magnum opus… i choose to believe that other entertainment companies bribed Source Music to disband GFriend because if they continued releasing music after this, all other groups will be outshined by their goddess energy. mago is 3 minutes and 19 seconds of slays after serves, and there will be no other kpop songs that can match its energy. i have streamed more than 2000 minutes of this song, but it never fails to be fresh for me! it’s THE kpop song for me.

**hunnybee12** (11): godfriend we miss you so much 💔

**throwaway-7650** (11): \[heheh\] 더 활짝 필 밤이 시작돼 새로 쓰는 진짜 날 위한 the first page yeah 6960 magic 춤추는 발끝은 crazy 날 위한 축배를 now 모든 do's and don'ts 지루해 이젠 다 빗자룰 타고 날아 볼래 (look at me) 두려워하진 마 다치진 않아 my life is waiting for you (yes you!) 거울 속 날 보고 웃는 그녀 (hakuna matata) my heart is beating for you (yes you) no more fairy tale 밤은 tic tak tic tak ring my heart mago mago 심판해 봐 지금 날 흔들리지 않을 테니 mago mago 나를 위한 춤을 춰 밤은 tic tak tic tak feel so high 나는 빛이자 어둠이 되고 거짓도 진실도 될 수가 있어 그저 원하면 원하는 대로 기쁨과 슬픔 그대로 다 내가 될 거야 불꽃은 피고 달빛이 가득해 we can dance in this moon night again (come with me) 잔을 들어 봐 미래를 가져 봐 my life is waiting for you, yes you 거울 속 날 보고 웃는 그녀 (hakuna matata) my heart is beating for you (yes you!) no more fairy tale 밤은 tic tak tic tak ring my heart mago mago 심판해 봐 지금 날 흔들리지 않을 테니 mago mago 나를 위한 춤을 춰 밤은 tic tak tic tak feel so high in the midnight in this midnight, oh 불꽃의 축복 속 다시 태어나서 날아 ah my life is waiting for you (yes you!) 거울 속 날 보고 웃는 그녀 (hakuna matata) my heart is beating for you (yes you) no more fairy tale 밤은 tic tak tic tak ring my heart mago mago 심판해 봐 지금 날 흔들리지 않을 테니 mago mago 나를 위한 춤을 춰 밤은 tic tak tic tak feel so high

**akanewasright** (10): gayest shit I ever heard

**BasedButta** (10): legends

**bogo** (10): rest in peace queens

**GapeCod** (10): The swan song to end all swan songs tbh. One of the best "unexpected" wins in a while, especially given GFRIEND's earlier track record in rates. Please let this place higher than Spotlight, I'm begging.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): pouring one out for when this goes out day 1 \[2\]

**jasannn** (10): i think ive twirled to this song at home at least 100 times

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): WE MISS YOU GODFRIEND!!!

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): The best K-pop song in the rate

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): we'll always remember you queens <3

**ricki** (10): they knew they didnt have much time left, they came together one last time and used all of their power to deliver one last latina slay. thank you for your service gfriend

**Roxieloxie** (10): popheads discord rates channel lore is that I considered changing my 11 to this in the kpop rate so it slightly sucked to see this win because my original 11 was first out. I assoicate this song heavy now with one of my friends who looped it like 7 times one night while i listened along to his spotify and then on the 8th one played 'its not unusual'. like my life is waiting for you!!! yes you !!!

**runaway3212** (10): no bc wow they changed everything

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): At the time I thought “oh this is a cute innoffensive winner” but it’s really fucking good actually, I love the witchy themes

**sarcasticsobs** (10): RIP in peace, Dancing Queens (Stream YUJU and VIVIZ). THIS is how you do nu-disco dance-pop. The 11 runner-up tbh.

**Stryxen** (10): just made enemies for this song by telling people to shut up when I npd it sorry if this tanks. My bad

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this song is the definition of “they lived they served cunt then they died”

**thedoctordances1940** (10): i really regretted not 11ing this almost immediately after the rate was over, wonder if I'll do the same this rate, was so very close to 11ing it here as well.

**WaneLosertoc** (10): i feel so many emotions here having just learned this was their final single. like you all can DM me THESE KINDS OF GOD TIER k-pop bangers if u want at u/WaneLietoc this shit is just SO wonderful; i wish u all felt this way about scritti politti or the KLF but we can build a bridge here <3! i wish they didn't do choruses in english--or if they are we need to get to a Kate NV level where "language is a vibe" and our stars just jump between 5 different languages in a song--which lowkey they sorta do here. anyways I don't follow k-pop i don't have that level of brainworms. but i am deeply fascinated as a burgeoning graduate student studying information needs what strikes ppl to write youtube comments like "i miss the girls. i wanted you to have a more dignified ending, but you ended this cycle in the best possible way with MAGO.". what is going on with these fan communities?! what r THEIR information needs? do they also need a gift card to one of those adult botiques? how can i help them get gfriend back?!? i just wanna help im so emotional rn WOW what a ditty!

**welcome2thejam** (10): There's so many parts in here that would be the best part or the big hook of other songs, but in MAGO it's simply one in a track stuffed wall-to-wall full of em

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Genuinely curious about how often the lyricists of this song think that people say Hakuna Matata

**PhloxInvar** (9.5): I don't what was wrong with me, for some reason I didn't like this song until now. LIKE BITCH WHAT. Something was wrong with me and I HAVE ATONED FOR MY SINS.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Kinda would have preferred it if “Love Bomb” were the winner of this rate because I like it more but I can’t deny that this is a slick banger and I hope it gets its due in this rate. GFRIEND didn’t die so y’all could do this dirty just for being in Korean!

**imbaby122** (9): fighting the urge to include this song in my presentation about the 80s synth pop revival bc damn it is pervasive (and also the best thing to ever happen to me). how tf did it get to korea?

**MassiveThief** (9): have never heard this but yeah I'm on board

**qazz23** (9): love the disco sound of this

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): Apple and Crossroads outsold but this is still so fun

**flava** (8.5): hakuna matata

**TiltControls** (8.5): I can't remember what I scored this in its rate, but it's one of the ones that's stuck around in my mind ever since so I'm assuming it was well. While I really liked Love Bomb, this song is also a ton of fun. The chorus sounds so sleek and the girls do a fantastic job playing off each other.

**bespectacIed** (8): what a fun rate, fun winner and rankings. Twice's crash and burn, iconic. Fancy you'll always be famous.... Viviz on the otherhand... jk

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I still don’t really understand why this won its rate but it’s still a very cute song!

**dream_fighter2018** (8): too horny… too horny by far… I was scared

**vayyiqra** (8): I don't get the hype over this song, it's just one of many "pretty good" throwback K-pop songs (throwback to what? idk like Abba), and I fear there is a darker timeline where it sounds like an Ava Max song. But it is catchy and it nailed what it was going for so !

**Verboten_Prince** (7.9): Listening to this with the hindsight of the 2021 K-Pop rate… does anyone else hear a bit of Drunk-Dazed in this? Did ENHYPEN copy these girls??

**bulforster** (7.6): (#15) This is the same score/placement I gave Red Velvet last winners rate and that rate introducting me to Russian Roulette is what got me interested in doing kpop rates. Nice full circle moment.

**starla_** (7.5): this is fun

**nick1372** (7): it's just a bop idk what else to say

**reput4tionera** (7): it's fine

**monalisafrank** (6): some fun moments but too sugary sweet for me

**Uberpigeon** (6): this is kind of bopping but it still has that kpop-esq focusgroupcore feeling of being grown from stem cells in a lab

**jman457** (5.7): a standard pop song, catchy but not the best of the best

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (5.5): It's well produced and the performances are fine. It's just so by the book that hearing it once makes me feel like I've heard it a thousand times.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): hmm

**RandomHypnotica** (5): now why wasn't this punished for being generic synthpop

**fadedblue09** (4): Lemme pretend this was Time for the Moon Night…..too bad I can't

**pig-serpent** (3): Literally the most forgettable winner, I forgot having listened to this song before the rate it was in had finished. I genuinely had no idea what song it was or why it won, and I still can’t say I have an answer to the second one.

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): dunno if I just conditioned myself to be yassified during Kpop rate month but I feel like that rate had much better songs

**anothertown** (2): this is the true "how did this win" of the rate

**frogaranaman** (1): I don't get it, sorry y'all

**camerinian** (8): call it countryphobia if you want, this song is both a classic that the culture wouldn't be the same without any also something that doesn't need to be sought out, like, ever. Like, it's always around you, influencing what you did, why would you need to go listen to it? The world is better for having it, let it be.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): Again- the charity rates always have such insane levels of talent in them, and while I think this is really good, I never thought it was great. It’s a classic, but I think that much more is taken from its icon status and not quite the song quality.

## Was able to have a sound dialogue with Jolene and come to mutual agreement about the man

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): How bad of a bitch do you have to be to steal Dolly Parton’s man???

**bogo** (10): absolutely shocked, why would jolin tsai do this to dolly

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): a masterclass in storytelling

**DirtyRat583** (10): jolene messed with the wrong queen and i hope it haunts her forever

**ignitethephoenix** (10): invented music

**ImADudeDuh** (10): dolly parton please dont die, i’m sending you my energy

**itsabop** (10): I gave it ten in the charity rate and I'm not inclined to do any differently here!

**jsonphile** (10): do I need to explain myself? No. Put this song in the top five already we know it’s getting there

**nick1372** (10): just fuck her already Dolly

**NotWith10000Men** (10): please don't let this go out on day one i'm begging y'all

**reput4tionera** (10): before i die i need to go to dollywood

**runaway3212** (10): actually one of the best songs ever

**Saison_Marguerite** (10): Jolene on the Dancefloor is the 11

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I have nothing original or insightful to say

**starla_** (10): no notes

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): me when someone asks who should’ve been in this rate instead of BoA

**TiltControls** (10): It did feel a little anticlimactic seeing this on the Charity list and knowing it'd win, but that doesn't take away from how stunning of a song this is. Dolly's always been a fantastic songwriter and you can hear the heartbreak not only in her voice, but in the words too. This track oozes sadness, defiance, and desperation all in one and I'd be alright to see it win in another field of strong competitors

**Verboten_Prince** (10): Threesome time!

**WaneLosertoc** (10): she funded the covid vax u fucking think im giving this anything ELSE but a 10?!

**welcome2thejam** (10): The sound of that guitar is something else, and Dolly sells the hell out of this tale

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): woah another classic…

**imbaby122** (9.3): please jolene please don’t be a slag i’m begging please :(

**monalisafrank** (9): Hard not to push this higher because it’s so iconic and the story is so simple and affecting, but I think it’s a little too simple for me to give it a 10

**qazz23** (9): one of the best country songs ever, covered many times but nothing beats the original

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): It’s so iconic that Dolly Parton has literally 70 albums but everyone only knows at most three of her songs.

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (8): Good guitar work and great singing, I just wish there was a bit more to it. As an aside, the line "And I cannot compete with you, Jolene" rings a bit hollow when it is Dolly Parton singing it.

**throwaway-7650** (8): miley deserves to place higher than her godmother

**Uberpigeon** (8): i know its a classic but dont let this win for fucks sake

**jman457** (7.7): It holds up really well, I just wish it was longer

**akanewasright** (7.5): one of the most boring, cynical winners ever. Can’t tank it bc it is good, but MAN

**dream_fighter2018** (7): whoever submitted this to charity rate made a massive mistake

**impla77** (7): should be like that stock image story where Jolene and Dolly get together

**pig-serpent** (7): Good song but a fairly underwhelming winner for a rate as stacked as Charity IV.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.5): sometimes i dislike this song, sometimes i don't…. justice for murder on the dancefloor btw.

**cremeebrulee** (6.4): jolene on the dancefloor cleared like not even joking here

**shhhneak** (6.3): Not even the FBI could’ve gotten this L out of me.

**bespectacIed** (6): Dolly's persona here is so unrootable, girl get up!!! Jolene is just a baddie! Queen

## Cucked

**flava** (6): yeah country music that popheads obsessies over is just not that interesting

**Stryxen** (6): I like this but not that much

**plastichaxan** (5): I don’t like this much as a winner but love it as a song idk what to do

**bulforster** (4.4): (#31) All I can think about is that tumblr post rewriting the song so Jolene is an eldritch horror.

**hikk** (4): flopene

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): Sophie Ellis-Bextor found murdered on the dancefloor

**vayyiqra** (4): Yeah it's a great song but I don't want to hear it again

**Awkward_King** (1): she wants to be trixie mattel so bad

**RandomHypnotica** (1): this score does not reflect my opinion on dolly parton as a human, but instead my countryphobia

**Roxieloxie** (1): sorry i singlehandedly kicked dolly off the no 0 list, big fan of her work with the vax and also on hannah montana those times

Hosting the Hispanic Art Pop rate was the best first hosting experience I could have asked for. Everyone's ballots were so positive about the rate's three fantastic albums (landing us on the lowest controversy leaderboard), I had a fellow first-time cohost so amazing they would go on to be the most prolific host this winners period and my 11 Nada by (admitted sneak into the rate) Lido Pimienta, a song I adore enough for it to be my 11 in this rate as well, pulled maybe the biggest upset win of any of the songs here beating out the certified hit and presumed frontrunner telepatía.

Hosting this rate got very stressful towards the end, the first thing I'd look at whenever I received a new ballot was the difference between the Nada and telepatía scores to check if my 11 was improbably holding onto its lead. I woke up the morning after the extension deadline passed to find the very last ballot had put telepatía into the first place after Nada had been barely holding onto the win almost the entire rating period. However there were still two outstanding extensions. One was due to the reddit message character limit not being able to contain one rater's enthusiasm and quickly fixed which just left us waiting on one ballot that I was assured would be completed that day. I could honestly barely function that day, not being able to focus on anything except constantly refreshing my inbox until u/vayyiqra awarded Nada a 9 and telepatía an 8 cementing my 11's underdog victory.
Because we'd accepted our last ballot after even the extension, our reveal prep was on a very condensed timeline and massive credit to poppy (u/plastichaxan) because the reveal wouldn't have been any bit as good as it was without them. My contribution was primarily the final shitpost based on the final Breath of the Wild boss cutscene (a game I've never played lol) that was inspired by u/1998tweety's anime-based shitposts for Froot's and Touch's wins. I learned video editing from scratch to make it in a blur of a day of major tunnel vision where I didn't realise I hadn't eaten anything until I suddenly noticed it was dark outside and I'd spent over 5 hours making a two-minute clip.

But it was all worth it for the reactions to the win in beatsense chat and to celebrate this incredible song's induction into the rates canon. - u/bulforster

—

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I am STILL so mad I missed this rate! I've since listened to these albums and holy shit Lido deserved it so fucking hard. The biggest upset in this rate, I think? And it's whole heartedly from how enchanting it is. She fully gets your attention and takes you on this journey, and I am so happy its excellence was recognized. It almost made it to the top half of the rate, but I'm happy it even got this far.

**camerinian** (7.5): God this was an enchanting discovery. This kind of languid jazzy music is not the sort of thing I would normally hunt out, but shit those melodies are just so engaging.

## Algo (Google translate better not let me down here)

**bulforster** (11): (#1) My rating experience will probably never reach a high like this winning again I fear.

**plastichaxan** (11): This is just one of the most beautiful songs I’ve ever heard and hosting this rate was so exciting, I really was not expecting Lido to win so this win is historic to me in every way possible and while I know it won’t win this time I’m happy to 11 it

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): during this original rate I was the lowest scorer for this song and I'm not making that mistake again this album is a masterpiece on relisten

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Ugh she Nadavoured.

**bogo** (10): toda

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): oh this song is literally transcendental… i love strong Hispanic women making statements!

**frogaranaman** (10): we love a fun upset winner

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): so glad this song won it’s so gorgeous

**qazz23** (10): Love the flutes and vocals here, catchy chorus also

**ricki** (10): genuinely one of the gaggiest rate results. genuinely dont think the gag of lido pulling out a win will be ever topped

**Roxieloxie** (10): Really thankful for this rate for introducing me to her

**runaway3212** (10): just so incredible

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This was a legendary win. Lido is so underrated, and I’m glad Popheads were introduced to her intriguing and daring music

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Percusión!! Bass!! Video-game-type sounds!!

**Stryxen** (10): perhaps the most stunning performance of the decade

**sufjancaesar** (10): Couldn’t do this rate or listen to the album but holy shit this makes me want to

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): one of those songs that just hits you in the heart every single time

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I should really listen to this album shouldn’t I?

**throwaway-7650** (10): do australians pronounce it as naurda

**WaneLosertoc** (10): its really wonderful to see Lido is garnering views and an audience. I had to miss her Big Ears performance regrettably. take this ten instead.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): tbt to when i was banned from the sub for jokingly wishing death on known racist and antivaxxer eric clapton and missed out on this rate because i didnt know i could still submit scores. rosalia still wouldnt have won but this is also a wonderful winner

**akanewasright** (9.5): EL DOLOR LO TENGO PRESENTE

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This winning was a moment most pleasing to me in my career, always great to see the underdog come through and they earned it! Whenever this song starts playing I’m like “that sounds familiar” but then the vocals start and it all floods back to me, it’s just such a haunting melody and a powerful message too.

**vayyiqra** (9): I love pop songs with flute so much

**welcome2thejam** (9): Shhh I'm becoming one with nature right now

**impla77** (8.7): love it when you can get a side by side translation for my ignorant ass

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I don’t know why she makes the surskit ah in the middle of this song but I like it

**starla\_** (8.5): I've never heard this before but it's great

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.4): Why do I feel like I'm being hexxed (in a good way)

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): my redemption arc

**NotWith10000Men** (7.8): this whole album is a damn experience

**jman457** (7.6): we love a surprise rate winner, but it kind of dragged a bit

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a little bit

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (7.5): The focus on wind instrumentation and pretty trippy vocals elevate what might have been a standard affair to something much more interesting.

**pig-serpent** (7.5): At the very least, likely the most interesting song in the rate.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): eso que tu haces outsold :gasp:

**imbaby122** (7.3): kind of self hating latina of me to give the two spanish songs in this rate the lowest scores

**monalisafrank** (7): good production and vocal performance but not a melody I’ll return to

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.8): this one is cool

**nick1372** (6.5): This is so intense that it would've been kind of a drag if it weren't for that BEAT

**TiltControls** (6.5): While I was hoping for a couple other Lido songs to pull out the win over this one, I'm glad she got her chance to shine over some more well known competition. For the song itself it's good but I'm not as excited with it over many of the other songs in this rate.

## Go on girl give us nada

**RandomHypnotica** (5): i am sorry but i do not hear what everyone else does with this album

**reput4tionera** (5): im bored im sorry

**PhloxInvar** (3.5): Beautiful, just not my thing though.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3.5): title is exactly what the song is giving me

**Awkward\_King** (0): im so sorry poppy im so sorry bul im so sorry everyone who loves this song i just... really do not. there are several songs on miss colombia i would have celebrated winning but this just doesnt grip me at any point and im not too keen on the melody so im never really that interested.

I actually got like fully depressed while hosting that rate that didn't have anything to do with the rate but my life just kinda became a whole mess while it happend Day 3 of the reveal I dropped out of my uni at the time Honestly though im happy I did it, because after that I found the rater community which (among others, don't let discord become your entire support system) helped me get through it The rate itself was actually really funny cause it was the last one we hosted on plug dj and also one of the last ones before listening parties and all that stuff was really popular So what im saying is it fully flopped Like it got 32 ballots the day before it was due But luckily for me, yetti took it upon herself to promo for me and the raterbase (that was concentrated on the host server at the time) pulled through and it got more raters in the end It was annoying though like at 32 Smooth Criminal had like a top 10/top 5 (don't exactly remember) and then at 52 it barely hit the top 25 I also remember so many people mentioning the Glee Version of Smooth Criminal and I still think that version sucks so much The reveal itself was a lot of fun though, I couldn't and still can't make shitposts so I just threw a lot of vines and stuff in between but basically roxie was just like "hey idk if I ever told you but the main pop boys of 1987 reveal really helped me get through the weekend" cause it had been hard for them a little bit and that's something I'll always carry with me In general there was actually a lot of positive feedback which confused me cause I thought I did a terrible job I remember like teasing Kappy with the fact that I Knew You Were Waiting For Me might've won despite it being #7 just because tk tkyola's it in That was actually the reason I didn't send that to all stars though despite it being an arguably better pick than I want your sex but w/e idk it brought me to a lot of cool places so im always happy I did it - u/runaway3212

**camerinian** (9.5): surely this was the most predictable ever winner from MJ, right? Not that it wasn't deserved. It's a classic favourite for very good reason. The narrative is intriguing, the bassline and rhythm is iconic, and Michael is just grunting his ass off. I’ve always loved this song, and I’m happy for its placement given how divisive MJ can be at times.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I really like some of MJ's stuff- this is not really one of them? Call me Annie, because I honestly think this is just OK. I understand how it got this far, but it's not a song I'll particularly be missing- and it seems the consensus agrees, with this never really leaving day 2. Oh well.

## Hee hee

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**bogo** (10): this song came into my dorm and beat me the fuck up, 10/10

**frogaranaman** (10): my parents like this song

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is the dumbest MJ song and yet I still just have to sing along with it

**itsabop** (10): He truly earned the King of Pop title with this one

**NotWith10000Men** (10): the trash can is so good

**pig-serpent** (10): IT’S BEEN One week since she looked at me. Cocked your head to the side and said, "I'm angry." Five days since you laughed at me. Saying, "Get that together, come back and see me." Three days since the living room, I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you. Yesterday, you'd forgiven me, But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

**runaway3212** (10): The first rate I hosted... so many memories... mostly bad ones but still

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Missing this rate is the reason I didn’t have a perfect streak last year, I’m still mad

**sarcasticsobs** (10): The 1st MJ song I loved

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I don’t even need to listen to this to give it a 10

**TiltControls** (10): A classic in every way. It's an incredibly tense song, but MJ manages to pull it off perfectly. Early guess on number of glee comments: 12

**vayyiqra** (10): Tired of the memeing of this song but it does rule even though nobody knows who Annie is, but does anyone care ? no

**welcome2thejam** (10): Came in ready to score this at the lower end of the 10s curve, but two listens later and uhhhh sorry honor it slaps

**imbaby122** (9.6): this should be a ten but the michael jacksonisms become almost comedic at a point

**jasannn** (9.5): a perfect example of building up tension and releasing it well.

**jsonphile** (9.5): this is only the third best song off of Bad but it does absolutely slap

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): [https://youtu.be/VlmDPC6ai4Y](https://youtu.be/VlmDPC6ai4Y)

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): "annie are you ok" this is just snk S1

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.5): This sounds… worse than when I hear it on the radio

**anothertown** (9): anyone who mentions grant gustin is walking the plank

**bespectacIed** (9): a song that birthed a lot of sons and daughters but can't really be replicated

**ImADudeDuh** (9): classique

**akanewasright** (8.5): This rate was FUCKED - Prince had antis come out of nowhere to be tasteless, MJ did a bit too well, that damn George Michael made it too far… but as much as I kinda preferred other songs in the top 10, this song is iconic for a reason

**BasedButta** (8.5): annie are you woking?

**ricki** (8.5): me as soon as a song that was sung on glee plays: i actually prefer the glee version of this

**impla77** (8.4): you can use this for CPR

**WaneLosertoc** (8.2): alien ant farm outsold and are less problematic (in certain ways)

**bigbigbee** (8): Did everyone’s school have one kid who was like, VERY VERY into Michael Jackson? I didn’t get it at the time, but in retrospect it’s cool that Michael had such an impact even 25 - 30 years after his time

**monalisafrank** (8): the melody, performance and production are absolutely top tier. But WHY are the lyrics the way that they are? Why is he basically narrating a true crime podcast in the verses and asking her if she’s okay in the chorus? She’s not okay and neither am I. I’m disturbed and not in a way that really works for me aesthetically.

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (8): Basically perfect pop, at least for the general goal of pop. To my ears though there isn't enough here for me to rate it higher.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): I honestly still don't know if it's safe to listen to him in this day and age but regardless, it's a stone-cold classic.

**qazz23** (8): it's one of his best, love the instrumental breakdown

**RandomHypnotica** (8): YOU'VE BEEN HIT BY YOU'VE BEEN STRUCK BY TRUCK

**Stryxen** (8): never rlly been a fan of this song but its hitting rn

**jman457** (7.8): a classic, but isnt one of michaels best

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.4): not my favorite MJ single (or even one from Bad) but its fun enough

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): not bad but there's like several MJ songs i would put on before this

## Couldn’t learn how to moonwalk

**Uberpigeon** (7): annie are you ok is an annoying refrain to me

**plastichaxan** (5): A classic etc but idk I don’t like it as much compared to the other 8s I’ve given

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4.5): The song is okay.

**nick1372** (4.5): The music video is iconic though

**fadedblue09** (4): I'm honestly underwhelmed? Did Bad really not have more iconic singles than this?

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): this is the worst take I’m going to have this rate but I believe the Alien Ant Farm version is 10x better

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): i want to like this more but the chorus annoys me sm.

**bulforster** (1): (#48) I've never liked Michael's vocals on this song, Prince robbed!!

**starla\_** (1): no sorry I hate this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): I love Jules, such a sweet and fun person, but sadly I must continue to bully this rate 😔 I was scared to give this a low score in the initial rate because I was worried that people would drag me and they actually did end up dragging me for giving it a 7 so I figure I might as well speak my truth here. This song is so annoying, I’ve harbored intense personal beef with it since my childhood and working in retail just made me hate it more.

I'm really happy this rate happened as it's probably my biggest "personal passion project" rate ever, since I made the tracklist from scratch. Shout out to King, Flava, Racloves, and BeauMeringue for giving me active feedback from the UK perspective while developing the playlist--my original lineup didn't have "Too Lost in You", hello?! I random tidbit is my American self essentially got into this Y2UK hoopla cuz I fell into a Girls Aloud rabbit hole in early 2017. I'm pretty certain this was a trauma response to the US 2016 election and it helped me dissociate from the world 😭 And now we got a rate in the books because of it! I'm so happy the rate happened and that it did so well. Maybe I never host again cuz honestly I don't know what ideas of mine will ever top getting 105 participants lksdklasd. I was also very diligent about doing reminder DM's and I literally did promo by DM-ing people on Last.fm who had high counts for these groups--and hey I got a ballot from a last.fm person so yassss! Also, I was sitting on the results by myself for like 6 weeks and was silently gagged and overjoyed that Scandalous was clearing the competition. Talk about champagne problems when you're annoyed that a song goes from a 9.3 to a 9.1, afraid it might drop below a 9 but still leagues ahead of other songs, lol. Scandalous is just that bitch!

I'm happy I went with these 6 groups even if 3 of them flopped in the rate, as it offered something for everyone. And led to some cheeky chaos! It also led to me and Flava having fun with the reveal and fucking around with the format, playing sped up All Saints songs no one really wanted to listen to lol. Also, the outlier of The Saturdays proved to be a fan favorite which I figured since the pophead demographic has 2010s pop nostalgia. And um, Atomic Kitten sure where there! And of course, being a Jamaican woman myself I am ecstatic that the majority of popheads fell DEEP in love with Mis-Teeq, whose UK garage sound is very trendy again today and were blown away by their dynamic group energy. As Akane said, Alesha Dixon was the Rate MVP and that's very true, winning both bonus and main rate. I figured Girls Aloud would do very well which they did, but they are a tad more divisive since they could run the risk of being overrated (no shade, I have like 400 scrobbles of these heaux, sob). And lastly just want to shoutout my lovely Sugababes, who had many songs do quite well, from the unconventional Overload making Day 3 to a lot of popheads falling in love with a (gasp!) ballad, "Too Lost in You". And as always, please stream Siobhan Donaghy's 2007 album, Ghosts! - u/darjeelingdarkroast

---

**CrimsonROSET** (10): SO SO SO SO SCANDALOUS! This was one of my favorite 'discoveries' of the year, I'm so happy it made it pretty far with tough competition! The RUSH this chorus gives me, and their energy is so up throughout you can't just not at least move along.

**camerinian** (8.5): uggghhhh I really wanna give this higher than an 8.5 but I locked this score in ages ago and if I change it now then that's definitely gonna look like I'm rigging. This shit has grown on me so hard during the hosting period, like it's honestly timeless??? This does not sound like it came out in 2003, it sounds like it's still current. Just a slinky, sultry nighttime JAM and it's really like a 9.5 but I'm a host with integrity dammit

## You know you should be scared of us

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): The absolute slay of these women. Growing up I loved this song on the radio, its kinetic bust-the-doors-down energy cannot be ignored. I never knew they were British, and I’m glad Y2UK introduced me to more of their cultural impact. They deserved so much better in North America than “those one hit wonders attached to that flop Catwoman movie”.

**akanewasright** (10): okay fine this is kinda the best song ever made

**bogo** (10): mis-teeq are queens, need i say more

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): of course I have to 10 my luvs

**DirtyRat583** (10): it could be mis-teeq vs every man that has ever manned and the girls would win effortlessly

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): the most deserving landslide in rate history ever!!!

**frogaranaman** (10): SO TRUE

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I bought this song on CD and it arrived the day I am doing my scores love signs like that

**plastichaxan** (10): Ugh the rush this song gives me, not even poppers can do that !!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Still a banger

**qazz23** (10): really good beat and even a 🎻

**RandomHypnotica** (10): GAY RIGHTS!!!

**sarcasticsobs** (10): SMASHAAAA

**Stryxen** (10): best winner ever

**throwaway-7650** (10): akane was right

**WaneLosertoc** (10): again, i've already said my piece here. if u played GTA V u heard dis ditty. its genius. it was THE crown jewel in a crown of jewels that was y2uk.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Does not let up, my goodness

**bigbigbee** (9.5): this might be recency bias but oh my GOD

**starla\_** (9.5): copying and pasting my comment from Y2UK: this brings me back to being 11 and learning music video choreography from watching music videos on TV. So nostalgic and so good. The chorus is so hype.

**itsabop** (9.3): Omg I only vaguely remember this song but wow oh wow what a banger

**bespectacIed** (9): the production goes off

**cremeebrulee** (9): why does this grow on me with each subsequent listen dang... darjypno made points....

**jsonphile** (9): this song makes me, a awkward white boy who works as a software developer, feel like a bad bitch

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): ALESHA DIXON YOU WILL ALWAYS BE FAMOUS

**vayyiqra** (9): The strings go hard

**bulforster** (8.6): (#10) Y2UK was probably my favourite rate of the past year and this was an amazing winner for it.

**imbaby122** (8.6): this song belongs in a bratz animated movie that’s the best way i can describe it.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): alesha dixon you will always be famous

**NotWith10000Men** (8.3): this is so cool, how have i not heard this song before?

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.2): Yas

**BasedButta** (8): i can smell the 2000’s. this is good. i need some stimulation baby!!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): this is eating waitttt

**nick1372** (8): This immediately following Work It on the playlist is too much. Send in the reinforcements! Strong independent sexually confident women are attacking me from all angles!

**Roxieloxie** (8): pulling a haim in as5 and pretending like im rating the song i like more until i believe the score

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Ironically and unironically it should be Gentleman in this slot.

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): the UK sometimes makes points

**GapeCod** (7): I can hear why a lot of people were happy that this won (derogatory), but damn it I was expecting it to be in the vein of the Why? remix, and it clearly isn't. Never was a big fan of this sound tbh.

**monalisafrank** (7): such a bop, great production, but not as timeless as some others from a similar era and genre on this list. SO SHOW ME THAT YOU’RE GAME OH

**moonagenightmares** (7): at least 2 other songs of theirs from this rate were better than this tbh

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): ngl this grew off me a bit (especially compared to some other Y2UK songs including other Mis-Teeq tracks)

## Spinning round like crazy

**1998tweety** (10): vanity milan DEVOURED

**sufjancaesar** (10): Amazing song aside, Vanity destroying Scarlett in this drag race uk lipsync secured the 10❤️

**ignitethephoenix** (9.8): Vanity Milan twirl

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): If you think about it, this winning Y2UK manifested Vanity Milan being on RuPaul’s Drag Race: Canada vs. The World

## Overstimulated

**jman457** (6.7): a bit dated

**ricki** (6.5): this isnt better than push the button

**TiltControls** (6): I'm glad Mis-teeq pulled off the win, but as I mentioned in my comment for it in its rate, I think pretty much all of their other songs from this rate would've been so much better. It is a fun listen, but in Winners there's so much more competition.

**anothertown** (5): it's kind of giving reality show interstitial music

**reput4tionera** (5): the saw bass throws me off

**runaway3212** (5): one of the highlights of Y2UK

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (4): It's very flat. I can't find any depth here. The production and the vocals are so blase. It's also way too long for what it is.

**Uberpigeon** (4): the song gets on my nerves it just keeps going and going

00's MC's was the first rate I hosted that felt like a real passion project, me and Akane had gotten into all these artists over the Summer after Sean proposed the idea a couple cycles before, and then it ended up panning out that I'd be hosting and it was so exciting. I was so happy to see people discover all these albums from front to back, seeing the love Hustling and Off The Wall and other songs get was so heartwarming. Work It wasn't my choice for winner but there really wasn't any other option, and Missy is a legend and deserves all the flowers she gets. Please vote for Darius' 90s Femcees idea with Missy/Kim/Foxy/Da Brat, it would be an awesome prequel to this rate and there are so many gems in that one too!! - u/Awkward_King

**camerinian** (9): Missy is a God. We all know this. It's honestly incredible how every one of her singles is a complete slay, this being no exception. I honestly thought the love was strong enough to get this into day three, but it tragically relished bang in the middle of the rate nearly the entire time, which is a damn shame.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I was rooting against this song during the rate, but outside the context of it, yeah I can't deny this is pretty damn good. It's Missy fucking Elliott what can I say! Her flow is so energetic, her delivery keeps it up and the beat only adds to it! There's a reason she's an icon of the genre and of the decade. —

## I’d like to get to know ya

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**bogo** (10): one of the best rap hits of all time it's true

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): literally anyone who scores this under a 9 deserves the chair sorry its just objectively incredible

**DirtyRat583** (10): why does it sound like that "music that makes you poop" video

**itsabop** (10): The elephant censor is still one of the most clever things I've heard in music

**monalisafrank** (10): This song did more to teach me about sex than the American public school system or my parents. Walked so WAP could run. It was always interesting to me how Missy released this and didn’t couple it with sexy outfits- she does her own thing and we love her

**RandomHypnotica** (10): im too tired to think of a funny reversed comment again

**ricki** (10): [https://i.redd.it/bhu2lauxu2431.jpg](https://i.redd.it/bhu2lauxu2431.jpg)

**Roxieloxie** (10): missy is the only women allowed to slut shame ever

**runaway3212** (10): lowkey should've 11ed this in its rate

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Missy is the GOAT to me

**sarcasticsobs** (10): The "reverse" rapping is too iconic

**Stryxen** (10): and when I say this deserves to win

**throwaway-7650** (10): this winning manifested EXID's 2022 reunion ty king

**TiltControls** (10): one of the coolest songs ever (reve sgnos tselooc eht fo eno). In all seriousness this track is just so much fun. Missy has the energy to bring a track like this to life. And on top of it all the backwards speak was a fantastic touch to the memorability of this track.

**jsonphile** (9.5): look on principle I feel I have to give a 10 to a song that rhymes “ba-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum” with “ga-dunk-a-dunk-dunk” but I also can’t give this the same score as Marvin Gaye and Whitney Houston so I’m sorry

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): DJ PLEASE PICK UP YOUR PHONE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU ABOUT YOUR CAR'S EXTENDED WARRANTY

**imbaby122** (9.1): her brain is so powerful!!! when she actually flipped it and reversed it lives were changed.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Queen of subliminal messaging

**starla\_** (9): Missy did NOT miss in this era, the backwards part blew my mind as an 8 year old

**welcome2thejam** (9): Missy/Timbaland a true all-time duo, they were a game changer back then and this still sounds fantastic now

**jman457** (8.7): Its honestly just so much. A throwback that actually feels innovative

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): The elephant…an iconic moment in censorship.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): iconic! iconic!!

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): camp elephant

**Awkward\_King** (8): i was a work it anti in my rate but it is my baby at the end of the day

**nick1372** (8): Fun fact, the uncensored version still censors the word dick (with an elephant honk of course) but doesn't censor the word pussy. What does this mean?

**plastichaxan** (8): SLAY backwards is YASS anyway

**qazz23** (8): i wonder who likes big elephants

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Thinking about the absolute metaness of this rate: Missy references Kunta Kinte -> Kendrick sings about Kunta -> Kendrick also quotes Smooth Criminal

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.9): if my mom was doing this rate this would probably be her 11

**Uberpigeon** (7.5): when she said YURWIMINIPIWIBWENEPENU i felt that

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (7): The onomatopoeias on this are pretty funny, and the sound pallett is varied. That said it is a product of its time, and it can't help but feel a bit dated.

**reput4tionera** (7): isn't this the one that alyson stoner was in the music video for

## Needs a glass of wa-taahhh

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Tbh I like this less every time I listen to it, like yes Missy is a legend but that doesn’t mean I have to like all of her stuff.

**jasannn** (6): why are the bells lowkey the best part

**vayyiqra** (6): Yeah it's good but I'm over it; still I have to respect it and not tank it

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): i was the lowest score for this in the original rate…will i repeat that here?

**pig-serpent** (3): Wow this beat is… not very good.

**bulforster** (2.6): (#40) Oh hey, heart of glass made it into this rate after all! Unfortunately it's the beat it's a part of that drags down this song for me, even though I like Missy's bars.

**BasedButta** (2): the backwards rapping is camp but that’s it. sucks.

**PhloxInvar** (0): I don't get this song. I'm so sorry, but like this sounds ridiculous.

**camerinian** (11): one of my favourite songs of all time, literal eat the rich propaganda disguised as a classic pop song with a legendary hook and performance, and you plebs decide to tank it cos it's too bri'ish I swear to god

**CrimsonROSET** (6): timmy turner's dad voice britpop....

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): real hot girl shit

**dream_fighter2018** (10): soz for missing britpop

**IdiotBox01** (10): Are You Sure?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): damn, these british people kinda snapped.

**jman457** (10): I really liked this, fun lyrics and beats

**qazz23** (10): deserves its classic status, great vocal delivery and I like how the chorus is slightly different each time

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i am not common i am boujie

**WaneLietocSitsDown&TalksShop** (10): this is the only chance we will ever have to beat an old record that needs to die. when shit like this happens it reveals just how fucking fucked a 0 can be, as well as why I do believe you just have to commit yourself completely to rates. Britpop was maybe the most fun I had with a rate until nu-metal. I really like DC and WTSMG and most of Parklife. thanks u/smuckles.

**Stryxen** (9.5): amazing I love everything about it just didn't wanna give a 10 cos idk lol

**impla77** (9.2): Jarvis on Bargain Hunt was getting down with the common people

**bespectacIed** (9): Aww if this is a britpop rate I would've shamelessly rallied Oasis to win as a basic stan lol. Sonically and lyrically and vibe-wise, this is really the quintessential britpop song tho. The lyrics are pretentious and ironic, the production is very 90s, the tune is anthemic. Love it

**MK** (9): white man bad vocals current count: 1

**slimboyfriend** (8.7): the kids I met in college who went to private high school

**welcome2thejam** (8): You just know that if Pulp came out today, Jarvis Cocker would have one of the most annoyingly horny fanbases on the net

**sarcasticsobs** (7.8): Vocally not for me but I like the instrumental

**LilacDaffodils** (7.6): Class conscious uptown girl

**anothertown** (7): sucks ass that the first and most impactful thing I heard this guy on was the harry potter 4 soundtrack

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): common "people" (i do not believe british people are real)

**vayyiqra** (6): This is a really overhyped song that frustrates me. It's not bad, I get that it's making a Social Commentary about classism, but I don't like it a lot and even get a bit of a smug vibe from it ironically. But I tried. Side note, William Shatner's cover of this is pretty alright, and the whole album it's on is too (seriously)

**DirtyRat583** (2): an attack on my ears... brit-on-brit crime

**camerinian** (6): y'all there's a reason this song took three attempts to actually win a rate. It was nice for when Juice had run its course and phcj needed a new meme, and it's got some highlights (SAY THAT SHIT does slap I can't lie), but I never really thought this was more than the sum of its parts, and I'm not exactly mourning it here

**anothertown** (11): FUCK EVERYBODY ELSE! I RESPECT YOU!

**DaHumanTorch** (11): this is my most scrobbled song of all time so i can't not give this my 11

**musical_pyn** (11): this is just everything I want from a pop song, no notes

**akanewasright** (10): total pop-rap bliss, the best song ever made

**Awkward_King** (10): this should be preserved by the library of congress but not bc its such a slay but because its one of baby tate's only good verses

**bespectacIed** (10): Every line is a punchline. Feminism.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This has to be the best song ever named after a dead meme, right?

**bogo** (10): 📢 SAY THAT SHIT BETTER WATCH YOUR BACK BETTER SAY THAT SHIT BETTER WATCH YOUR BACK

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the fact that this was like a huge global breakout smash... criminal. super fun and witty

**dream_fighter2018** (10): apologies to Bree and Tate but this was very nearly my 11. This song is just full on confidence, and as a university student, whenever I need to feel more confident in myself and my academic ability I will just look in the mirror and whisper “Got a good brain but not much knowledge, that’s why I get my titties out when I’m with the scholars” for a much-needed confidence boost.

**frogaranaman** (10): queens, still my fav rap EP in a long while

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fad

**itsabop** (10): This is a damn good showstopping flawless banger, popheads better not rob it!

**qazz23** (10): love this mix of pop rap and synthpop, the ending is amazing

**ricki** (10): i think it would have been funny for this to lose again so we could figure out new ways to rate it till the end of times. turn this into our own jujubee

**Saison_Marguerite** (10): A throwback song featuring a sound that hasn’t been milked to death by the nostalgia mill??? Bree and Tate trading charismatic bars over new jack swing flavour simply doesn’t get old. PHCJ made points in this era.

**shhhneak** (10): This sub pushed this song like y’all were being sponsored. I hope the check cleared!

**Stryxen** (10): when your circle small but yall crazy

**throwaway-7650** (10): damn u/[redacted] ur so h-

**Uberpigeon** (10): keisha didnt go college just for you guys to rob her again

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): if u 11d this during all stars 4, you deserve a veteran's discount

**flava** (8.5): popheadscirclejerk really went downhill when they switched their theme song from this back to Juice

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): The last 40 seconds of this are sooo good

**starla_** (8.5): not my favourite from its original rate but still goes off

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): came into this thinking i'd give this a bit of a lower score cause I felt like I had got a little tired of it and the rate had quite a few songs i prefered but not listening to this for a while has probably really helped it grow back on me

**jsonphile** (8): Sandra D be like

**MassiveThief** (8): I went full circle from loving to hating to loving this song

**monalisafrank** (8): I had never heard this before and it’s really cute! Like the boy is mine but modern approach lol

**plastichaxan** (8): We need the girls to come up with the next song that has the impact Juice and this had on the sub and like with the same quality cause *chef’s kiss*

**runaway3212** (8): so I do not want to be persecuted but I just think this rate has better

**seanderlust** (8): the "I can't stop crying we did it kids" feeling when this actually won

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I remember I used to listen to this when I would go running and there’s this sound effect in the back of the song that sounds like a man screaming in the distance and every single time it played I thought I was about to be attacked. Anyways it’s definitely cooled on me a lot since. This is perfectly fun but I’ve definitely cooled on it, also [throwback to the hit piece I wrote about it on the circlejerk sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheadscirclejerk/comments/ki8l8t/discussion_i_think_its_time_we_admit_that_damn/)

**TiltControls** (7.5): I'm a little more tired of this track after hearing it in so many rates, but Bree Runway knows how to have fun with a song and that type of energy bleeds through to the listener.

**bulforster** (7.2): (#17) It's sick that 2000and4eva is still her most recent project

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): i mean it’s good but like. where did the hype come from

## SAID THAT SHIT

**jman457** (6): a bit overrated on here, feels like too much going and the mixing seems off

**nick1372** (6): Lots of fantastic individual parts but the whole thing never congeals together for me. It feels like it's missing a massive hook and I can't help but wishing it was centered around something more interesting than the Damn Daniel meme

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (6): Slightly eclectic to its favor, it's still just too by the numbers for anything more than passing enjoyment.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this was funny for the first 0.5 listens

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): what was supposed to be that little bit of synthwave near the end. anyways this is in a weird spot for me where I don’t really enjoy it

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): bree is such a hit or miss artist for me and this is a miss i fear…

**NotWith10000Men** (3): the chorus is the only part i even somewhat like

**WaneLosertoc** (2.5): im still wagging my finger and not gunning for this

**fadedblue09** (2): A song that should be left in 2020

**RandomHypnotica** (1): the damn daniel meme (as in the vine) was genuinely so unfunny when it first came out i was always cringing whenever it came out, and then the hype and phcj meme behind this song made me a bit... underwhelmed going into this song the first time, and then when it won the EP rate which was so absolutely STACKED otherwise???... i won't let that happen again

**SinfulAnarchy** (1): how did this win over 24k...

Ratemas, the lovely experiment where we played games and people got to donate songs was a fun time. 36 song submissions later, we finally came across our winner in Plastic Love. Although my personal submission bad girls was second, I think plastic love was a great winner and is a lovely song I didn’t know of previously. The melody and production is pop perfection and it was fun to see a city pop song beat a bunch of other songs. Anyway tune into next all stars to see what Roxie and I picked as our submissions 🧐 - /u/ignitethephoenix

This is arguably the most chaotic rate I've ever been apart of, and i hosted a rate the first month the world went on lockdown AND plug dj was broken. It was very fun dont get me wrong but the quick turnaround time meant that I was wasnt as involved with my favorite part of hosting (being a menace) as I would've liked. I honestly dont have as much to say about this song as a rate winner as I have with the other 2 I hosted this cycle. Maybe its cause I never got to sit with it as long as I did the other two rates where I got to know everything in and out compared to this rate where if you held me at gunpoint and asked me what made top 6, i'd tell you to pull the trigger. I'll say this, I think this song winning was a very sweet sentiment, as it had alot of really kind comments on it. After Stay with me lost the tiktok rate, it ignited a small fire in people who really enjoyed city pop and it was cool to see that passion translate into a rate win beating out faves like Disclosure/Bjork/Tinashe - u/RoxieLoxie

---
**CrimsonROSET** (10): Honestly, what needs to be said? More than anything else, I think this is the weeb song of the rate, and I say that with the heart of a weeb on me. There's a reason this is the face of city pop throughout the world, and why this got a music video like twenty years later because it was still that popular. This is that bitch.

**camerinian** (9): Gorgeous. Elegant. Iconic. Revolutionised an old genre by bringing it to a new audience. I think I still prefer Stay With Me if I’m being honest. Yes my city pop knowledge is as deep as a puddle
—

## I’m sorry

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): this song truly takes me on an emotional journey. the clichés about city pop taking you back and bathing you in nostalgia for a time before your birth is perfectly encapsulated in this song. it fills me with such an intense longing while also making me dance, and the groove is just so timeless. truly one of the pinnacles of music imo

**frogaranaman** (11): should have been DeBussy

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): It’s the greatest song in existence.

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): this wasn’t my 11 in its rate (I reached out and touched faith) but it was really close (my only 10). It’s the face of the city pop resurgence and is dear to me as it is the first city pop song I heard. but it’s far from the best these 80s japanese queens served so please consider voting for city pop rate :)

**welcome2thejam** (11): Brought it into this rates world, and I'll go down swinging with it too. I want to live in this song, a wonderful listen everytime, and legit a top ten song of all time for me. That's Plastic Love, baby!

**1998tweety** (10): name a better genre than city pop you cant

**bogo** (10): effortlessly classy and slay as fuck, also justice for stay with me

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): if i had a second 11 this would be getting it without any contest - unfortunately it’s up against my most streamed song ever in MAGO :( but make no mistake, this song is ETERNAL!! i first heard this song about 5 years ago, and it helped me discover the amazing world of city-pop - just a genre that hits all the right spot for my taste. this song makes me wanna cycle a bike through the city and just enjoy the simple pleasures of life - a feeling that cannot be replicated for me. city pop rate WHEN?

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This was such a cultural reset, changing lives decades after it was released your fave could never. Like most people I never became a full blown citypophead but I’m really grateful to ~~the YouTube algorithm~~ this song for bringing the sound back because I think there are some people doing cool things with it.

**just_thonking** (10): This should start playing when you open the dictionary to the page that defines "music"

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): I’M SORRY.

**PhloxInvar** (10): Iconic. Literally revived an entire genre of music, or at the very least, made it widespread. I've always listened to the 8 minute behemoth and complained about how it dragged at certain bits, but knowing that it's actually a really tight 5 minute song makes it even better. It fixes a lot my problems with the remix. This song's production is LUSH and crafted to perfection. There's bass, percussion and guitars just filling the atmosphere, and the addition of those strings just brings such a richness. Mariya brings her vocals and melodies, while not jaw-dropping, is ultiamtely perfect for the song. Even the lyrics are strong, talking about a girl who lost her love and can only view love as a game, ultimately hiding her loneliness behind superficial things. There's a reason it rose to an astonishing popularity, even if by the whims of fate (aka the algorithm).

**qazz23** (10): beautiful vocals and production - the horns take it to another level

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I am basic and I do not care who knows. Now go stream Taeko Ohnuki, ANRI, Miki Matsubara, Takako Mamiya, Minako Yoshida, Momoko Kikuchi, Tatsuro Yamashita, Tomoko Aran, Junko Yagami, Akiko Yano, Junko Ohashi, Kaoru Akimoto, Meiko Nakahara, and more

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): one day we’ll get a full japanese language rate on this sub…until then we can some together and appreciate this song’s beauty

**throwaway-7650** (10): vote for anime (yw u/CrimsonROSET)

**vayyiqra** (10): A perfect song. It's self-contained, a masterpiece, there was a seismic shift, energies aligned to make this song idk where I'm going with this metaphor but there is something special about it that eludes description. Yeah yeah I know haha "name one other city pop song". I have listened to a lot of other city pop and enjoyed it, but nothing else quite captures the hold of this song on me. Maybe I'm just basic ! Or maybe it's good and there is a reason the internet became so fascinated with it idk

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): bad girls not winning was kinda evil but also maybe MIA deserves it idk. anyway this song is so magical i can't even be mad

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this should be a top 10 sneak

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): skyline emoji balloon emoji explosion emoji

**jsonphile** (9.5): never heard this song before but the production on this is amazing

**Saison_Marguerite** (9.5): I’m glad I was introduced to this track through Ratemas, city pop has been a blind spot for me

**DirtyRat583** (9.3): maybe being a weeb is a good thing

**impla77** (9): can picture bopping to this in Persona 5

**nick1372** (9): City pop is such a good genre, man. The full, twinkling instrumental is just a perfect backdrop to this song about lacking fulfillment. It's just so beautiful.

**starla_** (9): youtube recommendations won

**WaneLosertoc** (9): someone at my radio station did a brilliant photoshop of their face into this art. algorithms be damned.

**Verboten_Prince** (8.6): Yaaaas ojou-sama

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (8.5): Groovy. It's so robust and warm with a good sense of patience and payoff.

**pig-serpent** (8.5): Very good song, but I think a few other cuts in this rate like Spotlight are doing this but a little better

**imbaby122** (8.2): if this song were in english it would hit the adult contemporary radio waves with a quickness and become a core part of my childhood i just know it.

**TiltControls** (8.2): Feels like I'm on the open road listening to this track. It's not always something I want to throw on, but when the mood is right it's an amazing track.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): We stan a Christmas classic.

**dream_fighter2018** (8): sometimes in my dreams, I see it, but it’s too far away to touch… just outside of my grasp, beckoning me with a smile and promises of all I could ever wish for, is the Japan cycle. I awaken with the knowledge that my dreams were nothing but a cruel trick of the subconscious, promising me whatever it can to placate me rather than having me face the realities of the outside world. My day passes in the same way it does everyday - breakfast, work, lunch, work, go home, dinner, sink into the couch and watch Netflix to escape the drudgery of my life. But this time, when I go to sleep, my dreams whisper to me - “maybe if you do the J-Punk rate on indieheads, you may be able to experience a quarter of the euphoria that Japan Cycle would give.”

**RandomHypnotica** (8): is this a youtube hit

**akanewasright** (7.5): the way this won the rate and hasn’t manifested us getting the city pop rate… y’all need to UPVOTE and FAVORITE that shit ~~bc it has a number of songs I prefer to this

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): a very overrated city-pop song but hey it's still a banger

**seanderlust** (7.5): me at six years old making my action figures smooch each other

**jman457** (7.1): its a vibe

**bespectacIed** (7): This was a 10 before it became a meme now it's kinda tired

**bigbigbee** (7): A worthy song to start off the City Pop revival on the internet, but once you’ve heard other city pop songs, this one sounds a little less special to me. I prefer Stay With Me from the Tik Tok rate, for example.

**musical_pyn** (7): other than the iconic opening I don't love this track

**reput4tionera** (7): i need to get into city pop

**Roxieloxie** (7): why did i go look up what rate this won, when it was one i cohosted

## Just playing games

**BasedButta** (6.5): way slower than i remembered

**NotWith10000Men** (5): pleasant

**apatel27** (4): Kinda tired of citypop now

**GapeCod** (4): I think I am over city pop.

**monalisafrank** (4): this was like the intermission of the rate for me. not offensive but not a chance.

**bulforster** (3): (#38) This is fine but if I'm splitting hairs a little bit of a snooze.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): This song is just not for me

**runaway3212** (2): this is also one of those songs where im so confused how it ever won

**Awkward_King** (1): i want to like city pop but im scared i might just... not

**plastichaxan** (1): I promise it's just personal just this song and yes it's 80% bitterness over its win and like 20% thinking it's mid

**CrimsonROSET** (9): I'm kinda at a weird point with this one, because I know I am underrating it, but because I sadly didn't do this rate my introduction to Kelela was Frontline, a song that I think is somewhat superior ro this. It's still pretty damn good! But I don't know if just as good.

**camerinian** (8.5): Kelela is one of my partner’s favourite artists, so I feel like I’ve absorbed most of her music via osmosis more than finding it myself. That being said, this is such an enrapturing track. The production is just immaculate and so cool. Kelela is such an ethereal presence over it, and I just love how distinctive her sound is in R&B, like no one else sounds just as cutting edge as she does. —

## Got a PS5

**Uberpigeon** (11): i always thought the first line was "you could give a bride away"

**1998tweety** (10): absolutely devoured

**akanewasright** (10): This was a cool 11 win for me bc I didn’t know anything about any of the albums in this rate (aside from hearing some vague buzz about the artists). I just came in, and thought this was the big song that made me want to dance, and 11d.

**bespectacIed** (10): Predictable and deserving win, from a once in a lifetime kind of album. Love this rate so much. The production, the layers, the delivery, the cunty MV...one of the best pop songs of the last decade, it's that serious.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Pusssaaaaaaay!

**GapeCod** (10): It stands for Let MK \[REDACTED\]

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I was middling on this in the initial rate but listening to it right now is activating my pussy chakra. I do still prefer “Frontline” (especially for the iconic video) but I’ll throw this a 10.

**plastichaxan** (10): Honestly I wanted a different Kelela song to win but there was no wrong answer to any Kelela song winning so

**RandomHypnotica** (10): frontline robbed but Kelela rate winner deserved

**reput4tionera** (10): litcherally insane

**Roxieloxie** (10): Missed this rate but I remember the host were really sweet and had funny shitpost for it. I dont think i've heard this one since being in plug and man this is really good!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Welcome back to music Kelela, we missed you

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I am FLOATING

**starla\_** (10): sexy and mysterious

**throwaway-7650** (10): the song title is me when my 11 goes out and my 0 is still in

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): never met a hater of this song. choosing to believe they don't exist

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): if she removed the sound of a pop can opening, it would be a 10/10

**monalisafrank** (9.5): one of my faves from a few years ago. I don’t return to it much anymore and I think it’s because it is showing a tiny bit of age but such a fun, moody song

**imbaby122** (9.2): this song is such a banger i’m just gonna pretend i’m not a caroline polachek stan while i listen to it.

**bogo** (9): it is that deep though, it's deep as fuck

**bulforster** (9): (#8) Kelela is so fucking cool

**impla77** (9): queen of being unbothered

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): kelela we need you back now more than ever

**qazz23** (9): love the layered vocals in this

**Stryxen** (9): WWIMDTW (we wanted in my dreams to win)

**TiltControls** (9): It's grown off me a little compared to some of the other songs in the rate, but Kelela is a juggernaut and this is still a stellar song. If this weren't a winner rate I'd probably give it a 10 or 11 again

**welcome2thejam** (9): Alright adding her to the backlog, this sounds hella good

**shhhneak** (8.5): I’m Kelela and I’m BACK.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.4): another song that sounds better on a night out but it's so magical

**WaneLosertoc** (8.1): what the fuck is going on at warp records? how bad is shit that they're just done signing weirdo insular synth bros to have to keep signing pop stars that don't need to be on this label? i mean to be fair, this question sorta answers itself and has been answering itself since the early 00s. but warp records' embrace of (black) pop has been one of the most fascinating developments of the last decade. i don't think it really made sense at FIRST, but it is producing bangers and the curation is coming around. they are at a point they have half a dozen black artists at various intersections handling various sounds. kelela just happens to be making the best bangers the label can currently afford--and yeah Im putting that over yves y'all aren't ready to here me tell you my tape copy of Heaven to a Tortured Cock & Ball is a hard 6 (SITHOL is still a 10.000)

**anothertown** (8): there's a little noise in the mix that's panned all the way to the left and it's scraping my brains out but otherwise nice

**jsonphile** (8): okay but why can’t this just be titled “let me know” why you gotta do the acronym stuff if you don’t actually use it in the song

**ricki** (8): lill mykelf

**runaway3212** (8): a rate I didnt do but what a slay winner

**seanderlust** (8): this is good, but that weirdass secondlife music video for frontline changed my life

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this is like h&mcore if h&mcore slayed

**vayyiqra** (8): Maybe it's my headphones but this sounds kind of thin here? Yeah it's my headphones since this is a well-made album which I don't listen to often enough

**pig-serpent** (7.5): The production on this song is incredible.

**Awkward\_King** (7): look how far ive come from kelela's biggest hater to this

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.9): It's okay but kind of an unassuming winner

## Still playing Frontline on PS2

**NotWith10000Men** (6.6): like in spotlight, i like it but nothing really happens

**PhloxInvar** (6): I think this song is kinda cool, but it just feels a little dull at parts. That chorus is great, but I'm not convinced of the rest.

**dream\_fighter2018** (5.5): this is alright but I’m not a huge fan of the percussion in the back. Whatever that instrument that starts the song off.

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (5.5): It's just too empty. These songs that have this sparse production with a pop singer on top need to be at least 30 seconds shorter. They don't have enough ideas to fill up the full 3:30 runtimes.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): i’ve never been a big fan of this - the song just feels like it meanders on without any destination

**frogaranaman** (5): I don't remember doing this rate but according to my scrobbles I did

**jman457** (5): never really clicked with Kelela or this song

**MassiveThief** (3.5): she sounds good... but the production is weird as hell and just distracting

**frogaranaman** (8): this is my fav on that album

**qazz23** (8): Wish there was more like this on the album

**TiltControls** (8): Still surprised that it beat out IKTE

**sarcasticsobs** (7.7): It's better than every slowed-down version she's done, that's for sure, I'm just "over" Punisher

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): I can’t listen to this song too much because I’ve found it makes me angry at others when I’m meant to be focusing on forgiveness.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): indieheads couldnt even give the good song on punisher a rate win they really cant do anything right

**vayyiqra** (5): I do not wish to rate anything from this album again or talk about it anymore, although this is one of the better songs on it I guess. I don't know if I like it though. Mixed feelings abound! The horns are cool I guess

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): at this point it's canon that I find this song an uninteresting and meek update on late 90s indie

**ImADudeDuh** (3): gets a few points for not being I Know The End but still not amazing

**bespectacIed** (0): yes a zero, allow me to use this petty score in this bonus rate please. I got a schrodinger's stan card situation with Beefy, the fallout depends on her next move. Overcome the cringe allegations, lose the hunger for clout, publicly denounce and diss the blonde demon, and MAKE PHOEBE INDIE AGAIN. For real

**camerinian** (8.5): the little song that could! Check out that rank graph. This song was relegated to the dregs of day one for a long while, but it really overcame all those original bad vibes with nothing but wholesome energy. I get why it was languishing for a bit, with it being so lowkey and airy, but like, that’s its charm and I’m glad it got recognised for how immaculate that vibe is in the end.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): This has been getting a surprising amount of hate and I honestly don’t understand why! It’s just so sugary and wholesome, like yeah it doesn’t reinvent the wheel and Charity 2 was super competitive, but it’s still really good!

## Hair free flowing in the wind

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): This 11 goes out to my dad because this song really reminds me of him, it came out when I was just a kid and he loved it so the song was everywhere in my childhood (whenever we were in a rush to go somewhere he’d use the melody to tell my sisters to go “girls put your sweatshirts on”) but it actually goes a bit deeper than that… the opening lines of “Put Your Records On” are [a reference to a Bob Marley song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBCVM4KbUM) that my dad would sing to me as a lullabye every night before bed basically up until the time I was in middle school. One of my happiest memories of him. He’s not dead or anything lol I actually live with him right now but this song has me feeling sentimental. :)

**letsallpoo** (11): https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/030/329/cover1.jpg

**nick1372** (11): Pack it up boys no one ever needs to make an uplifting song again

**1998tweety** (10): devoured

**anothertown** (10): the first time i had a fundamental disagreement with someone about music was on this song .. in 8th grade my friend was like "i loved the line 'sapphire and faded jeans, i hope you get your dreams' but then i realized it was from that stupid put your records on song" and i said there are so many things about that that i can't understand.

**Awkward_King** (10): this song truly feels like im ascending

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song is so lovely and comfy if it doesn't warm your heart when you listen to it idk if i can trust you....

**dream_fighter2018** (10): black girls supporting black girls (the song)

**emayzee** (10): every quirky girl auditioning for american idol in the late 2000s:

**fadedblue09** (10): This winning was the peak of the rating community and it has just been downhill ever since

**frogaranaman** (10): she literally is a fan of the cover y'all hate and makes royalties off it, y'all are so whiny

**ignitethephoenix** (10): most soothing song of all time?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Ritt Momney does have 8 million more plays than the original. However, they do not have another song that has more than 9 million streams, so its real bad for them

**jman457** (10): this ended racism

**just_thonking** (10): When are we rating this album

**musical_pyn** (10): makes me smile

**ricki** (10): this single handedly brought vinyl back to the public conciousness

**Saison_Marguerite** (10): I appreciate this song more now than when it was new, by virtue of now well it’s aged. Corrinne just sounds effortless

**starla_** (10): childhood nostalgia

**Stryxen** (10): this rate needs a complete redo like LOOK at how we fucked up the order of that top 10 (very correct winner of course tho)

**sufjancaesar** (10): :wipes happy tear:

**throwaway-7650** (10): biggest grower of the rate imo!

**welcome2thejam** (10): A scientific breakthrough! For the first time ever Corinne Bailey Rae has found a way to distill pure sunshine into a music track

**Verboten_Prince** (9.9): I hope Mr. Momney feels guilty about what he did

**imbaby122** (9.6): this song is supernatural. it has a power that is not of this earth. it comes from the most beautiful planet where nothing bad ever happens and silly things don’t matter.

**jsonphile** (9.5): I could give this a ten but this song feels like a warm summers day. And right now it’s November and I live in Wisconsin this just feels cruel to listen to

**Roxieloxie** (9.2): you know im pretty sure I gave this a 7 and the runner up a 10 in this rate but i cant lie this was one of the most iconic upsets in rates history this 50 stretch. Im very nostalgic for that winners 2 to febuary 2021 stretch of rates and reveals because so much iconic rates pop cultural moments happened and maybe thats helping me inflate this a bit. But its also really nice and deserves

**akanewasright** (9): very sweet song, very deserving winner

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): A relaxing song that also serves as a shot of serotonin.

**bogo** (9): blocking anyone who says the r*tt m*mn*y cover is better than this

**qazz23** (9): sunny, jazzy, and smooth; one of the better neo-soul tracks

**vayyiqra** (9): This song makes me so happy it is so wholesome it's soothing I need this

**itsabop** (8.8): There's a special place in my heart for this classic mid aughts bop, it brings such warm and fuzzy feelings

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.7): the vibes are so immaculate here… i should put this on my bike riding playlist.

**runaway3212** (8.5): okay so real talk I never got this song, I pretended to like it but it did nothing for me. When the Ritt Momney version was forced on me through tiktok I hated it even more. But since that version was popular on radio and I heard it too much there, I like the original. So thank you Ritt Momney, in a very weird way you helped me appreciate the beauty of a simple life

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): Cute

**WaneLosertoc** (8.2): pleasant shit

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.1): the best version

**bigbigbee** (8): listening to this, I’m suddenly riding in the car with my mom again, and I’m safe and happy

**DirtyRat583** (8): the way she released this at vinyl's lowest 😭 girl what records are there to put on

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (8): It's sweet, bright and sunny, without being too much of any of those things. Absolutely lovely.

**reput4tionera** (8): i don't want to talk about that one cover that was big on tiktok

**seanderlust** (8): this is just so lovely and was such a deserving winner

**shhhneak** (8): This is so comforting and deeply 1999 Nelly Furtado coded.

**thedoctordances1940** (8): oh this is better than i remember :kirbybop:

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): remember that nonsense MtS video where he was talking about mid music? this song is like that but actually making points

**impla77** (7.5): lovely song

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): This is a great song and all, but every time I hear the opening line all I can hear is that Alvin & The Chipmunks cover that became a tiktok meme for like a week.

**GapeCod** (7): Charity 3 was like 5 years ago at this point.

**IdiotBox01** (7): the most 2006 song ever

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): if only the chorus was as good as these verses

**NotWith10000Men** (6.8): tell me why...... i thought this song...... was fifty fucking years old.......until literally today.......

**BasedButta** (6.5): this is not bad but i remember being assaulted by this song daily on mtv when i was a kid. i can still see her biking with my mind’s eye

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.5): this is one of those songs that's v pleasant but i dont think ive ever been like "hmm you know what i wanna hear rn?"

**Uberpigeon** (6.5): activia type beat

**bespectacIed** (6): obsessed with this when i was younger lol but as time went by i've realized this is pop music white bread

**flava** (6): cute

WinnersRate3: ## Pity for pity’s sake

**pig-serpent** (5.5): I used to think this song was super boring because I only heard it in Band Hero (which is not the right context for this song, lol) and while I would say I like it now, it’s far from my favorite song in Charity 3. I get that most of my charity 3 favorites never had a shot at winning, but songs 2-4 were Sir Duke, Cut to the Feeling, and SOS, which are all much better winner choices.

**RandomHypnotica** (5): im sorry but this is laundry commercial core

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): idk i really just do not care for this early 2000’s singer/songwriter type music

**apatel27** (4): Was there a meme when this won or something? It's so generic

**TiltControls** (4): I wasn't too harsh on this during its rate, but I've realized I really don't like listening to this song. I don't think the blame is on Corinne Bailey Rae for this otherwise it might be my 0. But everytime that chorus comes on I just get flashbacks of every terrible American Idol audition I've ever had to watch. As a song on its own it's cute, but it never really stood out to me as anything more than another radio hit when it was popular.

**static_int_husp** (3): this is a snore I fear and honestly didn't like this as a winner the first time, so I have to put it in the lower scores.

**bulforster** (2.4): (#41) Unfortunately this song isn't good enough to make up for the fact that the first time I heard it was a bad cover by two girls in my year 7 talent show. Ritt Momney doesn't help either.

**monalisafrank** (2): I’m sorry I’ve always hated this song. I find it cloying, and it sounds like a commercial.

**plastichaxan** (1): Like I know this is miles above that white guy cover of this but it’s still so boring to me I’m sorry but like how did this win

okay so this was my first time with cohosts and it was also like an insanely big rate
I had been very shameless with saying I wanted to do the Sour aoty writeup (which I didn't get) but the ratcom knew I loved that album so they were like... you wanna do this
I took like 7 days to reply but said yes in the end
Tbh I did less for this rate I think
cause my cohosts were just quick with doing everything so I just vibed
The production value was so much higher but we could just alll chill a bit
I remember I had to like pick funniest comments for the banners and I was like "wow I never did this before" 
Tbh I still feel like a lot of core ideas were mine, so it does feel like my rate
Like I came up with the three secret bonus rates, the normal bonus rate, the top 2 shitpost and hosted a lot of the listening parties
But I still had to get used to cohosts I won't lie
It was weird that I couldn't just say "we're gonna do this" during the reveal without like talking it through
like I remember during the main pop boys reveal after housequake by prince I played Earfquake by tyler but somebody said "thank god I thought you were gonna play bedrock, actually one of the worst songs ever" and I could so easily be "bedrock disrespect at MY reveal???" and play bedrock
But here we had discussed about interludes before ofc so I couldn't do it as easily - u/runaway3212

What can I say about it that hasn't already been said? One of the most cathartic songs of the past decade, it definitely feels like a culmination of the sound Billie has been working towards her entire career, and I think it's a perfect encapsulation of the album's thesis. u/RandomHypnotica

Jules and I main pod girl guests WHEN - u/frogaranaman

---
**camerinian** (8.5): the early stages of the rate were looking super optimistic for a Billie top 5 entry here, and I was actually pretty amped for that. The catharsis on this track is just astounding, and while I need to be in a specific mood to really enjoy it, when that mood hits it is ungodly satisfying. Sadly most of the later comments had a tone of "first half is mid, second half slaps", and that pulled it down to a respectable top of day 2

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I don’t know, as much as I like this song I never really go back to it (or much of the album other than Oxytocin). It had its moment, but I think that moment is no longer the current moment.

---

## Second half

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): I love both my 11 wins equally. gives Musician a 10

**1998tweety** (10): this would've been my 11 as it's my most played song of 2021, but after hearing Kelly Clarkson WASH Billie on her own song...I can't possibly give this my 11.

**akanewasright** (10): Lemme smile and nod and not trauma dump

**anothertown** (10): you can't outdo the doer!

**Awkward_King** (10): she dressed up as a baby and im still defending her its rough out here

**bogo** (10): if i had a nickel for every song on here that started acoustic before switching to a loud, climactic second part, i'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot but it's weird that it's happened twice

**emayzee** (10): all of my doubts over whether or not to give this a 10 immediately dissipated once that switchup came on

**frogaranaman** (10): So happy that "INDUSTRY BABY" won this rate!

**hikk** (10): it's already song of the decade honestly

**impla77** (10): fuck that guy

**jman457** (10): Im not even a Billie Eilish stan, but like come on now….

**jsonphile** (10): Phoebe Bridgers may have done it first and arguably better but the cathartic buildup and release in this song is everything I could ask for in a song

**NotWith10000Men** (10): my song of the year last year. i can't tell you how many times i've played this on beat saber lmfao

**pig-serpent** (10): I could nitpick this if I really wanted to, but this is still one of the best songs to hit the charts in years and serves as an amazing emotional and cathartic climax to the album of the same name.

**plastichaxan** (10): Every single time I listen to this I just feel the need to sing it out loud and for what I don’t even relate to the song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): STILL THE SMASHA!!!

**reput4tionera** (10): this is real rock music

**runaway3212** (10): but wow what a moment

**Saison_Marguerite** (10): I remember listening to this like “Popheads are freaking out about a soft ballad?? it’s nice but that’s unexpected” then the switch-up happened, and I was like oh… I get it

**seanderlust** (10): ANDIDONTTALKSHITABOUTYOUONTHEINTERNETNEVERTOLDANYONEANYTHINGBADCAUSETHATSHITSEMB https://c.tenor.com/TnYMLFAxjhIAAAAC/angry-yelling.gif

**slimboyfriend** (10): to quote the captions on the music video [unintelligible screaming]

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): hey hosts i think you made a mistake in the ballot, why is i know the end on here twice /j

**throwaway-7650** (10): [insert flop_era.gif when this leaves day 2]

**TiltControls** (10): IKTE-lite is still a great thing to be. In contrast to IKTE, I actually don't really care for the opening on this one. I think it probably could've been shortened by half without really losing much. However, none of that really matters since what bumps this up is a phenomenal back half. I don't really mind Billie's whisper/quiet voice, but after hearing her use a much fuller one I'm begging her to use it more often!

**starla_** (9.5): the two halves of the song go together so well, the climax is so satisfying

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): just a great song that clearly deserved to win its rate innit

**Verboten_Prince** (9.5): In retrospect I probably could have rated this higher the first time around, I was just mad cause I knew Lil Nas X was never gonna beat this :(

**imbaby122** (9.4): one of 3 i know the end variants in this rate including the og and concrete angel. no i will not elaborate.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.2): i think i'm the only person who prefers the first half to the second one…

**itsabop** (9.1): Those last 2 minutes just emotionally hit like nothing else

**WaneLosertoc** (9.1): Still quite excellent. while eating a sandwich in memphis with an indiehead, he read me his unpublished ultimate 2021 bonus ballot and noted "this production is basically deathconsciousness". this is important stuff. flenser is a great label and deathconsciousness is legit a god tier masterclass. billie should keep doing this

**bespectacIed** (9): there were mass seizures

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): i tend to be lukewarm at best about billie (stan billlie with 3 l's instead) but this is just so mesmerizing and ofc that EXPLOSION just really hits

**cremeebrulee** (9): this is sooooo rate villain vibes

**Hulnia** (9): tbh i forgot this existed

**ImADudeDuh** (9): lost a point cause Kelly Clarkson ended her

**just_thonking** (9): This being in the same rate as I Know The End is funny

**monalisafrank** (9): I don’t think I’d actually listened to this all the way through closely since it first came out. The transition in the middle is really beautiful, and the second half’s lyrics are so brutal and raw. Amazing how it doesn’t need a chorus and just builds and builds. If you like this also please check out Beating Myself Up by CuckooLander

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): when this wins?

**shhhneak** (9): inside of you are two wolves.

WinnersRate3: 
**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (8.5): I really hope this style is a direction she continues to explore.

**nick1372** (8): They really just slapped two different songs together with minimal to no bridge in between them. it's still great because they're two amazing songs.

**qazz23** (8): nice noise pop second half (though Oxytocin is my fav from the album)

**Uberpigeon** (8): I Know The End for people whos- GUNSHOT

**welcome2thejam** (8): Billie Eilish 🤝 Almost every pop punk band in existence: Hating this city

**moonagenightmares** (7.8): the second half really elevates this. the ending kinda sounds like suede

**musical_pyn** (7.5): I always struggle rating this because the end is easily a 10 but the beginning isn't, but also the beginning is necessary for the song to work in the first place, so uhhh I'll probably decide right before I submit lol

**dream_fighter2018** (7): i wrote this in my original comment for ultimate but the climax here feels at odds with itself. The guitars are noisy and crunchy, Billie feels like she’s holding back, and the climax feels just a line or two too sudden. I do have to be honest though, screaming along to the end feels carathic

**flava** (7): easily the most overrated song of 2021, starts off with something soulful and beautiful with Billie delivering an incredibly impressive performance for the first half. And then the song shifts into pop-rock, and those guitars still sound like shit. Only saved by Billie’s cutting performance and a good chunk of the lyrics.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): The first half is a little boring, but the second half is amazing

**sarcasticsobs** (7): Why do the drums at the end sound like that? No like that production choice at all. amr told me to "get better ears" but I can't afford that right now!! 'Spensive!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Why did I have to turn my speakers up so high to hear this? I’m always torn between rating songs on whether to rate the songs on how good they are or how much I want to listen to them because this is objectively well written but I can’t really see myself listening to it again.

**bulforster** (6.2): (#22) good song but IKTE pulls the trick a bit better

## First half

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): the end saves it

**DirtyRat583** (5): it sounds like she recorded this song on her ipod touch and the outro is it breaking after she dropped it down the stairs

**Stryxen** (5): this winning and night shift losing. nobody can convince me indiephobia isn't real

**pantomime15** (4): The distortion on the drums towards the outro just doesn't sound very pleasing to me. If Finneas was aiming for the raw rock production, I think he failed to make it work.

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): I don't like the latter part enough to wait for it to start

**apatel27** (3): Still don't get the appeal of this

**Roxieloxie** (3): im not saying that i've put off doing this rate until 3 hours before the deadline because everytime I saw that happier than ever was the second song listed which made me sigh and want to go do anything else but, im not not saying that. I hardly ever Like Billie Elish, I skipped out on rating my 2019 aoty (cuz i love you) because I didnt want to sit through (when we all fall asleep where do we go) for 2019 ult and I almost skipped out on rating Montero in 2021 ult due to Happier than ever being there. This annoys me considerably less than some of her hits in the past on dont smile at me / wwafaswdwgtmts but I still dont enjoy it. I knew it was gonna win ult just like it wont popheads song of the year last year just like itll probably get very close, if not winning this rate. any 0 I'd give it would truly be out of spite of not wanting to see it win and I dont think I hate it that much but man I really dont hear what everyone else is hearing in this

**vayyiqra** (3): I like the sleepy beginning to this better than the rawk ending, which I hate, is my abhorrent take

**GapeCod** (1): I still stand by my dislike of this song. I'm usually a fan of songs that pop off in the second half, but they also tend to have an interesting first half too. This is just way too boring for the majority of the time, and the payoff, while definitely cathartic, doesn't reach its full potential either. The tiktok trends were funny though.

**camerinian** (10): manifesting Laura Jane Grace pulling a Kendrick and getting a straight lad up on stage to sing this and then getting him canceled in real time when he yells all the slurs

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i for one got MUCH ass to shake, thank you very much

---

**ImADudeDuh** (11): this is the most punk song of all time, aside from this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsAnEP31N1Y

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): laura jane grace i love you always and forever

**bespectacIed** (10): this song and album so good it actually made me reflect about my gender identity lol (soz no offense meant teehee but tru story). There have been plenty of songs discussing the trans experience since then, but this is still on one of the most raw and visceral ones. What a pre-chorus.... Song is a bop tune-wise in general too

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I'm actually only familiar in full with the Bikini Kill album from this rate, need to listen to the other albums ASAP. This is a deserving winner of that rate

**frogaranaman** (10): this is actually so slay

**qazz23** (10): Solid and catchy opener

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Trans Rights!!!!

**seanderlust** (10): i'm begging popheads to not make any jokes about the "youve got no c*** in your strut" line. yes i see it. please be serious

**WaneLietocSitsDown&TalksShop** (10): queercore stands as the tiniest rate we've done to date. It could've been more obscure, but I probably would'nt have done the rate if not for Hole's Live Through This, which is an extremely personal album that colors the aftermath of a fraught time I deeply failed as a human being. Anyways, if you understand the rate machine you also understand the colossal volatility that a 30-35 participant result receipt can provide. Songs can upend or sleight shit in ways that become increasingly harder as more participants solidify a general baseline. This wasn't winning until /u/idontreallycare4 submitted a ballot at the last moment that not only made this winner, but a hall of fame placer. The Against Me! album really isn't one I've returned to because its just progressive Vans Warped Tour-core; i read Tranny I have vibed to enough Against Me! for now. In truth, it is the most sincere winner we've had (i see we're not rating toxic here so I can say this).

**shhhneak** (9.5): the most slurs in a song since Azealia Banks made music.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): Punk Rock!!!

**Stryxen** (9): OH!

**jman457** (8.8): we love a queer anthem

**slimboyfriend** (8.4): indieheads can say faggot for this winning

**MK** (8): that slur smacked me in the face

**welcome2thejam** (8): Damn that rocked, feels cathartic as all hell

**DirtyRat583** (6.2): advertisement music

**apatel27** (4): idk it's boring never liked this kinda rock sound

**vayyiqra** (3): Was afraid I wouldn't like this because I don't like punk much, but I kind of see the appeal, it's just musically very not my thing

**Lowest Scores:**

(2 x2) Awkward_King, MassiveThief

(0 x1) DaHumanTorch

It was a close competition between Ain't No Mountain and Feeling Good (and also You Can't Hurry Love for a brief moment) - but this rate was filled with so much talent that almost anything coming from it would've been a 10 from me. Though it hurt to see low scores cause of how many great songs were in it, this was one of my favourite rates to host. Shoutout to my amazing cohost /u/Roxieloxie who made it so much fun to host with in every aspect! hopefully we can tackle another pop/soul decade soon! - u/TiltControls

Usually when I host I'm the ballot collector not for any reason it just usually ends up the role i take on when cohosting, this rate was Unique in a sense because I didn't have that role. Why is this relevant? It means that I was really out of the loop of what was winning because I kept forgetting that there was a Google doc that I could go check to run the numbers myself to find out. I remember the streak where you can't hurry love had over a 10 average and I assumed it was the default one to sweep. I remember leading up to it it seemed like if we could juuuust get the right ballot we could push Nina Simone into number 1 until a last minute ballot came in and solidified Ain't no mountain as our winner. I think it was honestly Tilts' comment for 'You're all I need to get by' which was a really touching comment talking about the duo and why he liked the song, that softened me on the duo on the whole winning. I had always liked the song but now I had a real emotional investment, and while I think I also would've preferred the previously mentioned song winning, Ain't no mountain is just a generally sweet song that I cant think of a single non-positive thing to say about it which is a really sweet sentiment for a very sweet rate that helped me appreciate some absolute classics that I never really got the chance to fully appreciate from that era, and i cant really ask for anything else (ps shout-out august 2021 rate host coalition) - u/RoxieLoxie

**camerinian** (10): I think this score may have been influenced by watching that performance on YouTube, because holy shit these two are just like the perfect duet partners. The chemistry is simply electric between them and it’s infectious. I wish oldsongphobia hadn’t struck for this one, because this was on track for the top 10 for a long time, and was seemingly a lock for day three until the last few ballots knocked it down here. The Motown song machine certainly had its problems, but my god sometimes you just can’t deny the output.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): Watching the performance on youtube completely changed my mind on this song, from just alright to absolutely great. Their chemistry is just so magnetic, the way she truly PERFORMS and he's there just looking like he'll truly cross any mountain or river to get to her. It's so good.

## Celeste speedrunners

**apatel27** (11): One of the greatest songs of all time

**jsonphile** (11): look there were lots of songs that could’ve been an 11 here, and were my 11’s in their original rates. But this is just one of my all time favorite songs. Like top ten songs of all time. Its just a perfect song

**sufjancaesar** (11): I can’t explain how infectious I find this. It’s hard not to get invested in their cute lil story every time I hear it. Their chemistry here is some once-in-a-lifetime magic and I can’t imagine giving another song my 11

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): A reminder that probably I’ve watched Remember the Titans twice as many times as any other film in my life. YOU BLITZ! ALL! NIGHT!

**frogaranaman** (10): there were like 15 valid winners in this rate and this was one of them

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of the most perfect songs in existence! I’ve listened to so many different covers and arrangements this song and the magic always shines through, but the chemistry and joy that Gaye and Terrell were able to channel together will forever be unmatched. Two beautiful souls making one beautiful soul track.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is happiness set to music

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): i only think of having to watch remember the titans a million times in middle and high school

**qazz23** (10): Classic, love the vocals and bassline

**RandomHypnotica** (10): is this good? yes. Would Feeling Good have been such an easy 11 for this rate? Yes... yes it would :(

**Saison_Marguerite** (10): It’s just a classic.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Yeah

**starla_** (10): I love this song but I was working in a cinema when Guardians of the Galaxy came out and this plays in the credits. so it kinda soured on me. Still a 10 though

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): CLASSIC!!

**thedoctordances1940** (10): classic and a great winner (although that rate had a lot of songs that would've been good winners tbf, mainly leader of the pack)

**TiltControls** (10): Though I still would've preferred any of the top 10 over this one, it's still Marvin and Tammi doing what they do best. It was a close competition between this and Feeling Good (and also You Can't Hurry Love for a brief moment) - but this rate was filled with so much talent that almost anything coming from it would've been a 10 from me. Though it hurt to see low scores cause of how many great songs were in it, this was one of my favourite rates to host. Shoutout to my amazing cohost /u/Roxieloxie who made it so much fun to host with!

**vayyiqra** (10): I used to not like this (?!) and how silly of me !

**Verboten_Prince** (10): If the final of this rate isn't Gaye vs. Gaye then we've failed as a subreddit

**WaneLosertoc** (10): y'all have baby ears with Sly; this is still a slapper tho

**welcome2thejam** (10): Is what being in love feels like

**bulforster** (9.6): (#5) Marvin talking about rate wins?

**bespectacIed** (9.5): What a fun rate, great song but I didn't expect this to win over any of the girl groups and aretha tbh

**imbaby122** (9.2): this song has the unique disadvantage of kind of sounding like shit but it is a banger so i can look past the garbage audio quality.

**akanewasright** (9): I still think I’d have preferred any other song in the top 5 winning to this, but this is kind of an all time great chorus

**Inner-Language8833** (9): It's a classic, enough said

**throwaway-7650** (9): SHIT mixing

**impla77** (8.7): feel like they are over promising here

**jasannn** (8.5): I wish there was a bigger build up at each chorus but this is one of the best duets ever

**bogo** (8): classic

**monalisafrank** (8): a classic but I just can’t put it higher because I had to sing it in too many choir concerts.

**pig-serpent** (8): I don’t know how to rate this type of omnipresent song that feels like it has always existed. I like it, but It’s so ingrained in me that I’m not sure I need it.

**plastichaxan** (8): The best of his two wins :Exactly:

**Roxieloxie** (8): <3

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.8): classique but also this played all the time at work and im tired of it atm

**reput4tionera** (7.5): why did i think that glee covered this

**anothertown** (7): this is the cute that gorgeous was next to

**bigbigbee** (7): I’ve been to too many weddings lately

**cremeebrulee** (7): open an investigation on the host server collusion that made this win (/j)

**dream_fighter2018** (7): Sometimes when I listen to this I think of Sam Cooke and how Bring It on Home to Me was horrendously robbed

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (7): It's well produced, well sung but I just can't see myself seeking it out. I'll let it remain an occasional burst of optimism I stumble on.

**ricki** (7): 60s music is so good when you ignore the fact that it sounds like it's being played from a pringles can

## Canoe club

**nick1372** (6): God I hate how short they make songs these days. 2:31? Grow up.

**runaway3212** (6): we wanted nina simone

**Stryxen** (6): Nina and Aretha im so sorry

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): sorry i just really don’t like cheesy duets..

**jman457** (4): this should have been a mid day 2 song, sorry.

**static_int_husp** (4): especially compared to the other Marvin song here, this is not up to the caliber of a winners rate imo

**Awkward_King** (2): gaye

**MassiveThief** (2): maybe because of overplay or assocation with so many movies/tv shows/etc but I can't stand listening to this

**DaHumanTorch** (0): i have so many bad memories attached to this song that i literally have no positive feelings towards it anymore

It’s not surprising that Criminal won, but what’s interesting is that Tori was in the lead for over half the rate’s duration, first with Precious Things with Crucify eventually overtaking it. However, in the last week of ballots, Criminal prevailed with a large lead. I can’t be mad; it’s a great song, and many Popheads walked away with a new appreciation for Tori, as I was hoping. Though it came at the expense of Björk… monkey’s paw situation!! Thank you again Sam for choosing me as a co-host, you were amazing and I had so much fun planning this with you! Your writing is so thoughtful, and bouncing ideas back and forth came naturally. Thank you also to Nick for stepping in as an honorary co-host when Sam was pulled away from the reveal due to unexpected circumstances. I definitely learned a thing or two about time management during the Beatsense - I was running on adrenaline the whole time and finding interludes on the fly. The funniest moment was when I had to buy time to finish a shitpost (thank you Roxie for co-directing Happy Phantom - The Sims Version), and played an entire 20-minute video of Tori Amos piano shopping. Fortunately, the audience went from “are we really watching the whole thing” to fully invested - she’s such a queen like that!! Overall, an experience that I will always cherish. - u/Saison_Marguerite

**camerinian** (9.5): absolutely love this sleazy jazzy pop sound. The instrumentation is messy in the best possible way and Fiona’s crooning has such a brilliant bite. I was so excited for this song to continue its upward trajectory into day 3, as it looked like it would do, but sadly it just comes up short. Commiserations to Tori tho

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I don't know, maybe I've grown desilusioned with this- it's alright. I understand why it was such a moment, I understand how this is important to set up Fiona for what she went on to accomplish. But do I like it? It's fine enough, but especially with the revelation that the Tori album was for everyone, I kinda hoped that would take the win. If anything, I'm surprised this was the 'criminal' song that made it further.

## Legal Eagles

**anothertown** (10): [https://i.imgur.com/CCnVOP8.png](https://i.imgur.com/CCnVOP8.png)

**bespectacIed** (10): my favorite songwriter debut of all time probably, her mind is as boundless as it is bullshit-free. Love her. Mother.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Going to Slay Jail along with all the versions of Carrie Underwood from her various murder ballads.

**bogo** (10): as much as i love FTBC i would equally love it if fiona made another song like this that just rocks out. like give me another song that would go nuts at karaoke night

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): SO WHAT WOULD AN ANGEL SAY? THE DEVIL WANTS TO KNOOOOOOOW

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): it’s really hard to verbalise the importance this song and the album that followed Tidal, When the Pawn…, have had on me. Criminal, to me, really personifies the feeling of self-hatred and dependency on the approval of a man, something I’ve been really struggling with. But it’s multi-faceted, Fiona is not just “sad” or some Ophelia-like figure who’s resigned to her fate and being second fiddle. This song is assertive, with a main character who seeks to assert herself but is also willing to admit that she has her own failings and still needs that human connection because sometimes we fail to remember that just because one is self confident and assertive does not mean that they do not get emotionally attached!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The way the drums just KICK the door of this song down is so fierce, like it just makes you feel like the baddest bitch in the room from moment one to moment done. The scene in *Hustlers* where Jennifer Lopez pole danced to this should have won her an Oscar!

**imbaby122** (10): when this song comes on i’m no longer a virgin. i’m a seductress male manipulator whore (my true form).

**Inner-Language8833** (10): a staple in piano pop jazz and her vocals are crisp

**itsabop** (10): What'll be criminal is if this doesn't make day 3

**jman457** (10): This is such a slut anthem (can I say that). But in my mind this won the 90’s rate, sorry Bey

**monalisafrank** (10): how the fuck was she 17 here

**nick1372** (10): I love a good heavy-handed piano and this is maybe the best use of it in a song I've ever heard

**qazz23** (10): It's one of her best, really strong melody and catchy - plus the piano breakdown and strings at the end!

**ricki** (10): the smooth criminal when he hasnt shaved:

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Alt girls feelings!!!

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Despite 11ing this in the rate, feeling the need to say Little Earthquakes > Tidal, and if you have only listened to Fiona, it is Tori Time now (both still all-time favs though, to clarify)

**starla\_** (10): this is a 10 and it's not even the best song on the album

**Stryxen** (10): she's so lana del rey vibes here

**sufjancaesar** (10): When I first heard this in the og rate I wasn’t a huge fan but fuck did it grow on me

**throwaway-7650** (10): queen of tiktok

**WaneLosertoc** (10): she shat this out in 20 minutes and could have kept doing it for the rest of her career. a smart, meticulous woman and shrewd business decision NOT to do such a thing.

**welcome2thejam** (10): If Fiona never made music again she'd be one of the rare people who peaked as a teenager and could be proud of it

**jsonphile** (9.5): me when I feel like a criminal

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): this song (especially the outro) is incredible but like Crucify should've won

**akanewasright** (9): wrong Fiona rate for her to win but whatever, it’s still iconic

**cremeebrulee** (9): fiona's genuinely the best songwriter of our generation, no competition

**ImADudeDuh** (9): when this was used in episode 9 of Only Murders in the Building season 2.., lives were changed forever

**Uberpigeon** (9): you've been a very bad girl gaga. a very VERY bad girl

**1998tweety** (8.5): britney's version >>>>

**MassiveThief** (8): got me feeling DEVIOUS

**ObersteinAlwaysRight** (8): Fantastic instrumentation and she already shows plenty of hints of the maestro she would become.

**pig-serpent** (8): It’s a good song, but I think almost everything she’s done since is better.

**plastichaxan** (8): I respect the journey this took before winning but this deserved to win its first rate more than 90s alt debuts

**RandomHypnotica** (8): it's a fiona apple song alright

**bigbigbee** (7.5): Wow, she was really a totally complete artist, straight out of the gate. Amazing. So mature and cool. Also this song has aged incredibly well

**impla77** (7.5): piano goes off

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): the way the only fiona album i really like is ftbc. this song is good though

**runaway3212** (7.5): fiona apple my bestie

**bulforster** (7.4): (#16) It's a shame Fiona's only winner is from her weakest album but even then this is still a great song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): shes so crazy cant take her anywhere

**vayyiqra** (7): I'm old enough to remember when this song came out so I've heard it enough times. Lyrics about redemption make me cringe (don't ask I don't even fully get it) but yeah it's a banger so I can't hate it. (Why does it interpolate "The Streets of Cairo" though that part is so weird and funny)

## Lionel Hutz

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.8): Uhhhh I don't hate this but I don't exactly vibe with it either

**Awkward\_King** (6): a classic but it doesnt really step outside of that too much for me

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): ty dol- i mean fiona apple’s music has much higher highs personally, and i’ve never been too in love with this!!

**reput4tionera** (6): i have never been able to get into her im sorry

**TiltControls** (6): It's fine I guess? It's a solid song and made sense as the winner of its rate (even if I was hoping Tori would pull it off), but as a song it inspires literally no emotion in me.

**Roxieloxie** (2): im sick of rating this song in grabbags!!! get some new material !!!!! i dont like it anymore any of the times!!!
