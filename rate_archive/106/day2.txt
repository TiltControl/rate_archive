but hey, my loss, i'm stupid. 

(this is like actual facts, almost didn't graduate high school because of math and was so lucky to take exactly one math class in college and ultimately that ended up being a sham and we all got As.)

=====

SmileAndTears: I almost failed stats so I'm not 100% sure

But basically the higher the controversy score is, the more scores will be a lot higher/a lot lower than the average.

So if you have 3 scores (4.5; 5; 5.5), your average is 5 but your controversy score will be low

But if your scores are 0, 5 and 10, your average will still be 5 but the controversy score will be very high

=====

letsallpoo: think of it as a measurement of how spread out the scores are. the higher it is, the more people "disagreed" on it, like by giving a lot of 10s and 1s. that's how it's measuring how much "controversy" the song had

edit: the other reply is better than mine ddd

Roxieloxie: Isn't it like the extreme differences in the scores? Like if a song gets alot of 11s but also a ton of 0s there would be a high controversy since its so divisive

pat-rickstar: I shuffled the rate Spotify playlist again today and honestly we didn't do **too** badly yesterday. Definitely could've been worse.

I would love the top 10 (not in order) to be: a-ha, ABBA (both songs), Whitney, Lizzo, Janelle, Gaga (just one song don't care which), Beyonce, Kate, and Estelle. I expect the real one will look nothing like that

> Did Damn Daniel deserve to win? Yes. Is Damn Daniel the better song? Yes. Should you drop everything and stan Bree Runway immediately? Yes. But also, is Boss Bitch an absolute banger deserving of your 10’s? YES. Despite being a soundtrack song, it remains one of Doja’s strongest outings. It’s a perfect banger for the clubs (a sore spot of 2020) with its electrifying, anthemic chorus. Her flow is absolutely infectious, and you can’t help but sing along and scream “DROP!” with Doja on every listen. The only complaint I can possibly think of for this song: it’s quite short! I hope Doja taps more into this sound and style in the future. - /u/DaHumanTorch

---

"Boss Bitch" should've been nothing. For starters, it was released as the third single from a soundtrack to a movie that maybe like eight people here have seen — yes, the *Birds of Prey* soundtrack people thought that a song with Normani and a song by Charloette Lawrence (who???) needed to take precedence. And the song itself feels rather disposable; it's two-and-a-half minutes long, with two verses, a two-line chorus and a whole lot of squawking in the last thirty seconds. It then charted at the magical position of #100 on the Hot 100 and should've vanished into the ether.

But instead, "Boss Bitch" escaped to the land of TikTok and Twitter fancams, literally ingraining itself in stan culture and, as though through sheer exposure, endeared this little throwaway track further to us gays. And while the song itself can't help but feel like a pointless little throwaway thing, it's Doja herself that makes it memorable and worthwhile. The sheer explosion of personality that she exhibits, especially in that second verse, is proof of her charisma as a pop performer. Despite the many (many, many) setbacks that have been thrown her way, Doja remains a charming staple in the current pop zeitgeist, and the fact that she turned this song to gold is evidence that she deserves to be.

letsallpoo: # Fellow 4chan Chat Room Members

**1998tweety** (10): a soundtrack song had no business going off this hard, deserved to smash

**akanewasright** (10): Since I did the rate this came from, I completely fell in love with this song. Every line is so fun, and they’re all delivered with such personality. Doja (and Ashnikko) went so hard on this one.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Is this her best song? Yes, until she releases the rock version of Say So officially.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I remember listening to the song for the first time and I wasn't sure if I was listening to a song by Azealia Banks. Turns out it was Doja! This song is a nice mix of Azealia with the production and Nicki with the flow. Azealia and Nicki comparisons aside, I also want to talk about this song's role in the soundtrack of Birds of Prey. I like Diamonds by Megan Thee Stallion and Normani but I don't know why executives at Warner thought that should be the lead single for Birds of Prey when Boss Bitch fits the vibe of the film a lot more. Knowing Margot Robbie personally chose this song to be included in the soundtrack showed she has TASTE! And oh, this is a Dr. P*ke free song so I can stream this comfortably!

**fadedblue09** (10): A potential SOTY maybe???

**frogaranaman** (10): a huge fucking bop

**hikkaru** (10): one of the best songs of 2020 period

**kappyko** (10): its like she shot ME in the dick

**Mudkip1** (10): pop perfection

**mysario** (10): fancam videos on Twitter are a plague but if you ever HAVE to make one, this is the only acceptable song to use for it

**runaway3212** (10): This TikTok trend was amazing, Shawn looked so hot every time.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): thinking about the radio edit of it where they replaced the chorus with boss boss

**twat\_brained** (10): I gave the wrong Doja song my 11 but I'm impressed that we a) got a song released in 2020 to be rated in 2020, and b) we're doing it twice. Go us!

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this makes me go completely fucking feral ajaklfgkjhsj;ofgvsjo

**plastichaxan** (9.8): how is this not longer it’s so good

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I love this song but it’s not as iconic as many of the other songs here so I have to dock 0.5

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): BANGER

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): oh wow i am *late* on hearing this but i LOVE it, jfc. the beat is right up my alley and the mood doja is giving hits right

**anothertown** (9): first thing a girl did was a bop!!

**astrologicalangel** (9): why is this so short??

**bbfan132** (9): a banger even though it’s sooo short

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): :cherry:

**intheaftermath** (9): I mean it makes me feel like a boss. You can really hear Ashnikko's writing influence on this too!

**ManofOranges** (9): This song has grown on me a decent amount since first hearing it. I was underwhelmed that this song, of all songs, had won its rate but I've come to appreciate it a lot more. Also the "made friends with the floor" line always gets me

**quinnpsych** (9): Love it at the gym

**SmileAndTears** (9): This makes me want to go to the nearest gay bar, find a cute twink and have sex on the dancefloor

**vayyiqra** (9): slapper

**waluigiest** (9): honestly this is where 2020 peaked

**WeastofEden44** (9): Yes mommy 🥺

**bigbigbee** (8.5): Doja Cat is such a special performer – it all just sounds so easy and natural to her. This track is amazing.

**Stryxen** (8.5): still confused how Rules went out day 2 it was the best song in the rate by FAR… this is good tho

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): It's a really good song, just wish it was longer.

**CarlieScion** (8): i AM a bitch and a boss

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): too short

**PuggleMaster** (8): How the hell this song beat Damn Daniel or most of the songs in the top 10 of it's rate is beyond me. I was fully planning on giving this a low score but even I must admit it's a bop.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): The fact that this won the rap girls rate is kinda embarassing honestly

**camerinian** (7.5): y'all ever heard Aerosol Can by Major Lazer? Anyway

**fxsparrow** (7.5): Any one who will give this song below 5 I will chew chew chew you and I won't choke

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): It slaps but is kind of repetitive and a bit too short

**cremeebrulee** (7): the comment about popheads rating a 212 knockoff before 212 itself took me out LMAO

**fishingfor8** (7): I actually really like this song but this is not great compared to the competition of this rate. Its too blatantly a movie soundtrack song

**Frelock\_** (7): Good club music

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Love the maniacal energy and all of the quotable lines but when you stack this up against everything else in the rate… eh.

**joshually** (7): not bad… not bad at all…

**jsonphile** (7): ahh so this is where “madefriendswiththefloor” came from in Ariana’s Motive: Murder Mansion

**nooodisaster** (7): Powered stan twitter fan cams for 3 months straight

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): doja has had a hard year. this song is derivative and deserved better than this soundtrack, tbh. it's a song that would give me a headache while i worked a closing shift at express in 2009 but in a good way. it's very still ringing in your ears as you walk to the mall parking lot past the still open theatre and the closed cookie shop, you know?

**raicicle** (7): this is an itzy song

**skargardin** (7): birds of prey deserved better

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): this would be an 11 if it was the tik tok version that just goes “I’m a bitch, I’m a bitch, I’m a bitch”

**TragicKingdom1** (7): kinda wild that we're rating a 2020 song for the second time already when most songs need to wait at least a year to get rated

**wavingwolves** (7): when she repeats the end of the second verse... whew!!!

**seanderlust** (6.8): "i'm a bitch. i'm a boss. i'm a bitch" - my socially anxious ass after successfully giving one (1) piece of constructive feedback to my coworker

**addupten** (6.7): tick talk really overplayed this

**bulforster** (6.6): (#20) I'm not really into most of Doja's stuff but this is undeniably a bop.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): this is fine but honestly it sounds better in fancams than listening to the whole thing

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.3): WHAT U GON DO WHEN I APPEAR? W-W-WHEN I PREMIERE? BITCH THE END OF YOUR LIVES ARE NEAR! THIS SHIT BEEN MINE, MINE!

# Damn Daniel Deserved

**bespectacIed** (6): After years of rac-- hesitance, popheads finally allowed a female rap rate wow (but ofc it's only a grab bag bc it seems like we don't have enough confidence for female rap albums). Fun rate but whew if a doja song had to win why wasn't it the best ones (cybersex or juicy)

**lIIustration** (6): This song feels unfinished to me

**steelstepladder** (6): Perfectly fine but I still think this was like the 17th best song of the rap girl rate.

**aresthormars** (5): It is alright but I heard better songs from Doja Cat

**TiltControls** (4): it's fun sometimes, but in a winner's rate you're going to need more than that

**ImADudeDuh** (3): https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1271564996690841601

**selegend** (1): one of the most clearly undeserving rate winners

**shhhneak** (0): I’m tanking this song because everyone on Grindr has it on their profile and I’ll lose my mind if it beats some classics.

> Slide is the sort of track that was always bound for pophead dominance. A bold new sound at the start of a new era from an established icon, a vibey, dancey summer anthem, an incredible guest vocal performance from a queer icon. It really does personify everything that makes a great funk revival track, pulling hints from the initial 70s wave, G-Funk and EDM in equal measure for an undeniable bop. Now watch it tank in the winners circle cos of Migos. - /u/camerinian

> Slide is the type of song that changes your perception of an artist. Calvin Harris has had his fair share of bops before Funk Wav Bounces vol. 1 but Slide felt like another beast entirely. While his early work was fun enough, it did not necessarily have that much weight or ambition behind it. Frank Ocean is a wordy, cerebral, mellowed out critical darling. By this point he already released Blonde which was already garnering a reputation as one of the best albums of the decade, so him hoping on a disco track with an EDM producer seems like a bad move on paper. On top of that Migos were also added to the track which adds yet another ball that needed to be juggled and somehow, Calvin Harris does it with ease. The fact that this combination of artists work at all, let alone sound effortlessly as great as they do, takes talent from everyone across the board. On top of all that, Slide has only grown in popularity and critical acclaim as the years have gone by. Looking back at the 2017 year end, it feels puzzling that Slide was only number 71 as it has since become a staple of summer playlists and beach party soundtracks. A bop of the highest caliber which immediately transports you to a poolside no matter what time of the year you are listening to it. With a tight groove, a bouncy bass, and killer features, it isn’t uncommon to hear somebody call Slide one of the best hit songs of the entire 2010’s. - /u/steelstepladder

This song will forever remind me not of summer, but of the Popheads Jukebox. In its early weeks it struggled a bit to get a decent number of reviews, but [Week 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5y8fvp/discussion_the_popheads_jukebox_week_4_this_is/) is when things really popped off. It was a DJ themed week, featuring this song as well as Zedd and Alessia Cara's "Stay" (one of his early forays into the joys of ticking clocks), The Chainsmokers and Coldplay's "Something Just Like This." and...Cashmere Cat and Camila Cabello's "Love Incredible" (you can guess which one got the lowest average — and no, it wasn't the one with the male vocals). So many people ran over each other in praising Calvin Harris's latest summer jam, probably because this was the first time in years that he'd done anything mildly interesting, and at the time I was mostly just bopping to "Stay" too much to really care ddd.

I don't know if this song will ever really click for me. I appreciate that it's slow and laidback, but when Migos (and especially Offset) come in and the song gets a proper shot of adrenaline, that's when I actually start jamming. Frank's part is just too anodyne and sleep-inducing for me to really enjoy (my hot take of this rate is that Khalid would've been way better), and I'm a little offended that the homophobes outdid the homos on this track.

**bbfan132** (10): a great song and i will choose to forget about migos being featured here

**camerinian** (10): just gonna pre-emptively say y'all are so cruel for doing this to my baby

**CarlieScion** (10): this is SOTS every summer. fight me.

**cremeebrulee** (10): THEE song of summer 2017 go argue with yourselves xoxo

**frogaranaman** (10): I listened to this song at least 25 times in a row the night it dropped and it’s still good.. iconic

**ignitethephoenix** (10): will be robbed because it has Migos in it, but I love this so much

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song reminds me of better days gone by. OFFSET good gracious

**jasannn** (10): I overplayed the hell out of this in 2017 but it's a certified bop.

**kappyko** (10): i dont care that its kinda boring af now this was everything in 2017 <3 like yass we got fuckin amine tyler the creator rex orange county sza vince staples brockhampton it was an era really

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song. this song makes me want to be drunk wandering around downtown from store to store during first fridays and looking at art pieces i can't afford and testing out tapas at a restaurant i wouldn't go to normally because it's overpriced and ugh it's just so summer, but in a really specific way that i will always love.

**Roxieloxie** (10): Holy shit, I did not know the name of this song. The only party I got to go to in 2020, back in February was my friends 18th birthday and it was this big gay dance party in a basement. I have so many videos of all of us dancing to this song but i never knew the name of it. Hearing this just really takes me back to the vibe that I thought 2020 was gonna be

**sarcasticsobs** (10): S-tier summer song

**steelstepladder** (10): Of course I'm gonna give the winner of my rate a 10

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I really want an update on if Frank Ocean purchased *Boy With A Pipe* (1905, Oil on Canvas)

**urlocalcracchead** (10): I hate the migos feature but my husband frank really came on this

**waluigiest** (10): song of the summer 2017 if you’re gay

**wavingwolves** (10): this is a top 5 song so please let it be top 5

**yatcho** (10): I still can't believe Calvin Harris produced this funky masterpiece?? It still sounds fresh as hell

**seanderlust** (9.8): this is absolute pure vibe music.

**jackisboredtoday** (9.6): classic… when funk wav singles were dropping, that was a moment™

**anothertown** (9): A subtle, effective, evocative, yet boppy mood piece

**bespectacIed** (9): Great rate! Obvious but deserving winner. True Blue is for highbrow minds only

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I have a feeling this song is going to go out on Day 1. I hope I am wrong though cause despite the remorse and grudge that I have for Calvin Harris, this song fucking slaps. [Throwback to that time he blocked me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/drwhowhenhowwhy/status/976625115206098944)

**engifear** (9): The vibes are immaculate. Perfect addition to any chill out playlist

**fishingfor8** (9): I'd empty my bank account for Frank to do another dance track

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Back in 2017 when this came out (what a year) I remember everyone absolutely lost their minds over it and everyone was BEGGING Calvin Harris to make it a single, and somehow despite all that buzz I never actually listened to it? I should have though because this is great! There’s such a specific mood here, the sort of “summer bummer / too cool to sound enthusiastic” thing that every autotuned hip-pop-rap boy chases but can’t quite manage to nail like these guys did. This song just melts all over your brain.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): the bassline gets me

**ManofOranges** (9): Honestly don't really care for any of the verses in this song--except for maybe Offset's--because the production and hook is where it's at here. It's just so damn good, I love it

**runaway3212** (9): this would be a 10 but this video is offensively boring, like just a picture of the album would be better.

**SmileAndTears** (9): I hate that sample so much

**worlds-okayest666** (9): would be a ten but i find the high pitched frank vocals in the beginning so annoying im sorry...

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.6): great song

**twat\_brained** (8.6): I think this would've worked better with someone like Anderson instead of Migos but then again this is probably the most tolerable Migos sound to me next to "Bon Appétit" or "Stir Fry".

**lIIustration** (8.5): This is a 10 with better rapping, Frank kills this.

**InternetDude19** (8.1): I don't care for any of these artists but somehow they work extremely well together.

**1998tweety** (8): shes a cute chill bop

**akanewasright** (8): What a fucking smooth song.

**mysario** (8): the first 30 seconds can be binned but after that is groovy city

**quinnpsych** (8): Again, what a great summer song, Frank Ocean literally doesn't have a bad song in my opinion

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's pleasant, it's fun, but there's a lot of stuff in this rate that is more pleasant, more fun

**starlitsuns** (8): are you a $100M picasso painting or are you the girl in frank ocean's relationship because only one is worth the money

**Stryxen** (8): whenever I hear this song I think of todd in the shadows because he had a nice speech about this song once

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): yes Frank Ocean is on it, but at the end of the day it’s still a basic Calvin Harris EDM track

**suhonyu** (7.5): she was cute when it came out but that's it, didn't really age well

**pat-rickstar** (7.3): I still kind of don't get the hype for this but it's pleasant enough to listen to I guess

**aresthormars** (7): Groovy but I got bored when Migos jumped in the track.

**PuggleMaster** (7): Calvin & Frank snapped but M*gos really brought this song down for me....

# Still Bitter About How He Sabotaged Rita Ora

**CrimsonROSET** (6.2): Song of the summer, yadda yadda, don't know why it's not hitting this hard. Maybe I'm still bitter about RAM getting robbed, maybe it's because we can't actually go out there and party to it.

**bulforster** (6): (#23) Migos are popheads rate winners and Charli is not, love that.

**cocosairdep** (6): This might be an unpopular opinion, but I hated the high pitched voice, it’s super annoying and it really kills the vibe for me.

**joshually** (6): it’s merely okay

**selegend** (6): would be so much better without the pitched vocals

**vayyiqra** (6): This is okay but I'm still mad it won a rate against two albums that were stacked with better songs

**Tolk1en** (5): not convinced by the vocals, not convinced by this lazy beat

**welcometoNY** (5): i used to love this song but coming back to it, it's just not as special as i remember. it doesn't help that every artist here is a pretty shitty person. i appreciate the general sound he was going for, but the magic is just lost for me.

**WillamThunderfuck** (5): it's a song featuring only men, which is exactly what it sounds like

**moonagenightmares** (4.5): can’t believe i had to sit through migos

**bluehxrizon** (4): cursed period of time associated with this

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): blah

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): im sorry but i dont get the hype around this song at all. nothing happens in this

**Frelock\_** (3): Not really my style. When the only memorable part of this is a two word phrase. "I might" not remember this.

**fadedblue09** (2): You know a song is crap when an Offset verse is somehow the highlight of the whole thing.

**nooodisaster** (2): im..... falling....... asleep........

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): This should not have won in a rate with Nothing Breaks Like a Heart, Instant Crush and Giorgio by Moroder but oh well, I didn't do that one, did I?

**plastichaxan** (1): Do I like high pitched stuff? absolutely. Do I find this song obnoxious? very (sorry Frank I love you)

**wanderingimpromptu3** (1): Don't like the singer's voice and something about the production is grating, also doesn't really fit together

> In what it has to be one of the most meme-able songs ever to win a rate (outside of the actual Meme rate) and, somehow, one of the most niche winners so far (a nu metal song with unintentional Christian undertones), Evanescence's magnum opus Bring Me To Life managed to defeat the relatively more popular (in sales, influence and general relevance) rock acts Green Day and Linkin Park, in a victory that faintly recalls that of Amy Lee and company at the 2004 Grammy Awards for Best New Artist against a very salty 50 Cent.

> The song, which gained popularity thanks to its inclusion in a cringy montage in the much-maligned 2003 superhero extra-blah-ganza Daredevil have become synonymous with AMVs, Windows Movie Maker, goth subculture and, somehow, Mike Shinoda... but that doesn't take away the fact that, as the saying goes, memes aside, this is a great song, and a deserving rate winner. - /u/radiofan15

---

This may be a massive meme, but it is also a legitimate classic on a level that very, VERY few songs in this rate and in this universe can be considered. Evanesence made their mark on Hot Topics in malls across America when they dropped this, and it's remained a cultural staple. Amy Lee's vocals are one-of-a-kind, like they've been sent to Earth just to be cast across those searing electric guitars.

This song works as a meme because it takes itself so seriously to the point of camp. It's intense and emotional and dramatic that you can't help but either buy into the dark fantasy it's peddling, or join in on the ride and laugh along the way. It's fun either way, prime for both ironic and unironic listens.

I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm in the seventh year (I'm seventeen). I'm a goth (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This song is so damn dramatic. But that's why we love it. 💀

**frogaranaman** (9): iconic meme song

**joshually** (9): the drama of this song…. The dramaaaaaaaa

**jsonphile** (9): ridiculously over the top and dramatic in just the perfect way

**nooodisaster** (9): One of the few songs I loved in middle school I still 100% unironically AND ironically vouch for.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): BITCH this song is amazing. the drama. the chorus. the yelling. the video. the amount of time i spent blasting this song to my mother's chagrin while staring out the window during family road trips.

**selegend** (9): it’s an excellent song

**suhonyu** (9): the blue print, truly

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): yeah im still an edge lord what about it?

**waluigiest** (9): SHE IS SO GOOD this song is a masterclass in orchestral drama

**Stryxen** (8.9): evanescence and paramore in the same rate I love to see it

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.6): idc this song goes off

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**AtomicViolet** (8): I feel like I shouldn't like this as much as I do

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Boulevard of Broken Dreams was robbed in the first rate I've participated in. My score remains unchanged.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I lost my mind because I was like “oh my god it’s the song from [that Bionicles commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaLX6pRtM8I)” and it turns out that’s a completely different song but this song is still good. This basically defined an entire genre, if not an entire subculture, and it’s an important artifact of the ‘00s. Also the shitpost better be the Goofy version.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this song is linked with too many memes for me to fully take it seriously as a song

**racloves** (8): too iconic no explanation needed

**raicicle** (8): i literally only associate this song with goofy now

**sarcasticsobs** (8): goth rock or not, amy lee just has an unbelievably great voice. i am becoming immune to nostalgia so I cannot abide the dude rapping nor his “scream”. But 8 points for amy.

**steelstepladder** (8): WAKE ME UP

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): why was this song such an important part of my life in 2009

**vayyiqra** (8): Would go from great to amazing song if that one dude would shut up

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): If it was the iconic Kidz Bop version it would've gotten my 11 tbh

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I find this a bit too overblown, but Miss Amy Lee knows how to serve vocals for sure.

**astrologicalangel** (7): way better than I remembered

**camerinian** (7): this is one that the memes have thoroughly ruined for me soz

**cocosairdep** (7): I’ll admit nostalgia is helping this one. The song is kind of a mess.

**engifear** (7): It's good, but Evanescence has loads of better songs.

# @Mii Channel Theme Stans, Thoughts?

**CarlieScion** (7): a better meme song than the mii theme

# Asleep

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): my ex was OBSESSED with this song and to this day I can’t tell how much of it was ironic “goffic” jokes vs how much was genuine

**shhhneak** (6.6): Fun fact! I first heard this song on a Sims 2 music video and I cried my eyes out.

**InternetDude19** (6.5): It is certainly memorable.

**starlitsuns** (6.5): reminds me of two things: my emo phrase when I was 15-16 in which I am embarrassed over, and that one Vine where the kids try to wake up the plastic baby doll

**bulforster** (6.4): (#21) Deservedly iconic, other than the rap verse this is unironically amazing.

**addupten** (6): I never got the hype for this one, it's okay i guess

**aresthormars** (6): I am kinda lukewarm to rock music. It is alright.

**bbfan132** (6): amy lee is an excellent vocalist but this song is so tacky lmao, the male singer’s parts are kind of bad and the production is weak

**Roxieloxie** (6): American Idiot or In the End should be here and yall know it

**bespectacIed** (5): my immortal >

**kappyko** (5): its iconic that this gay shit made it on the same radio as aggro masc music but this kinda starts sounding weird near the end as in like the audio starts clipping?

**kirby31200** (5): I consider myself a pretty big Evanescence fan and this is certainly my least favorite song on Fallen and one of the lower entries of their whole catalogue. It's dated and cringy in a way most other Evanescence songs aren't. At least it's a funny meme

**lIIustration** (5): This hasn’t aged well imo, but it’s still a good song

**ktajlili** (4): this was one of like thirty songs on my iPod shuffle. I listened to it every day for six months and now I almost hate it. lol

**CrimsonROSET** (3.5): Sadly, sometimes being only iconic doesn't carry a song. But I'm happy for those who can appreciate it! Even if I don't!

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): no <3

**wavingwolves** (1): i didn't like evanescence at the time but now it's almost unbearable to listen to

kirby31200: How did this stay in so long and how did it beat literally any song from American Idiot. American Idiot is a classic while Fallen isn’t even the best Evanescence album. I hate Popheads, this is just like the emo rates, award mediocrity just because a woman sings it smh

> Of all the rates I've hosted, this one was the most obvious winner. It's just too powerful. During the entirety of the rating period this song did not once leave #1 and honestly it's what it deserves. Nothing can compare to the sweaty, horny bop this is and it's also not a surprise that it is currently among the songs with the most 11s received ever. Since first hearing this song my nipples have been rock hard and I am forever ready 2 go. - /u/hikkaru 

 > This song completely STOMPED the other songs in the Electroflops rate and let's be real...it's easy to see why. It's quintessential Tove; dark, sweaty, sexy, and a banger in every sense of the word. As a host, it was admittedly boring to watch it never move from the #1 spot throughout the entire process, but I couldn't complain much because I knew it absolutely deserved. It's iconic. It's the moment. Get into it. - /u/worlds-okayest666

I wasn't too surprised when this song won its rate, but I was surprised to see that THIRTY PEOPLE slapped it with an 11 and hailed Tove Lo as their horny queen. And the thing about Tove is that she's always been horny — my second ever concert was for Tove's theater tour in support of *Queen of the Clouds*, and I of course remember when she flashed us during "Talking Body". But while she's always been horny, "Disco Tits" was her first time at being super explicitly raunchy in a way that was meant to be campy, fun, and still titillating. Stuff like "Cool Girl" was about the stoicism that hid her carnal desires, or like the aforementioned "Talking Body" that said they could only fuck for life if they really loved each other.

"Disco Tits" was a turning point, as she turned the sex thing up to 11 and just looked to see where it took her. In retrospect I understand why this song was so well loved by so many people — just look at how people still give Slayyyter a career — but a part of me will still always prefer the sadder, more reserved, but still extremely horny Tove that I discovered in 2013. But we'll get to that version of her later...

---
**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (11): It's time to accept the truth, disco tits is the best song in this rate. Show me another song that manages to capture slutiness, high energy party and complete insanity in 3 minutes 43 seconds. You can't, I rest my case.

**hikkaru** (11): if you give this a 0 you hate women expressing their sexuality

**kirby31200** (11): I don't know if this is actually the best song here grouped with all these classics but I've been absolutely addicted to it the past week. My nipples will never be soft again

letsallpoo: # Fully Charged

**1998tweety** (10): we love a sex bop

**addupten** (10): y'all better be jumping

**anothertown** (10): Immaculate, one of the only winners I have fully supported in this god forsaken place

**bbfan132** (10): best music video of all time

**bespectacIed** (10): i love this rate! i too was fully charged nipples are hard when this won

**CarlieScion** (10): iconic

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i've heard this in a club exactly ONCE and have never danced as carnally as i did in that moment

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I forgot how weird the music was lmao

**frogaranaman** (10): Tove Lo didn’t have to go so hard on this song, and like mainly in the horny way

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The hook of this song just gets caught in my head at the most random times! There’s something special about this song to me, it always puts me in an altered state of mind somehow. It makes me feel… not quite *bestial* but it makes me feel unhinged, like I’m coming apart at the seams and my jaw is barely hanging on to the rest of me and all I can do is lumber my flesh vessel around to the music. Maybe I’m just a weirdo but it’s a unique sensation at least.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): my nipples are charged thanks Tove

**Ionlywanttheworld** (10): should've been massive

**lIIustration** (10): almost fu11y charged ready to blow but not quite there yet

**ManofOranges** (10): Pure fucking bop there's a reason why this song beat the second place song in its rate by a country mile, that being because it's great and iconic.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): was obsessed with this song and it’s still great!

**plastichaxan** (10): this is an achievement in lyricism and i'm not saying it ironically this song is so good

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song makes me want to put on a sequin covered jacket and a swishy mini skirt and grind with somebody else's boyfriend with a bottle of beer in my hand in a pair of chunky ankle boots and just thot and bop ok it's perfect cross faded music and i love that it kind of sounds like the clown song because it encourages clown behavior!

**PuggleMaster** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song is the easiest 10 in the rate for me, it's just so incredibly iconic, catchy and a perfect mood.

**runaway3212** (10): I don't think I'll ever understand the Tove Lo hype but this song is great

**Stryxen** (10): me when im wet through all my clothes, fully charged, nipples hard, and ready to go

**twat\_brained** (10): invented sex

**urlocalcracchead** (10): another eleven contender

**waluigiest** (10): ETERNAL SWEATY BOP

**WeastofEden44** (10): This song instantly makes me turn into a living, breathing sex doll that is on shrooms

**TiltControls** (9.7): one of the few songs actually getting a point boost on rerate. Took a while to grow on me, but when it did I couldn't stop listening

**camerinian** (9.5): I really do just admire Tove Lo’s commitment to being horny on main

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.5): that's hot

**zadooi** (9.5): Oh to be as unabashedly horny as Tove Lo and making it work.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): A stellar song, but it should land below top 10.

**sarcasticsobs** (9): jfc these lyrics lmao

**skargardin** (9): incredibly iconic

**vayyiqra** (9): Let's get it over with and vote this highly because le sex bop

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): isayhiyousayhiwestayhighyoulooksoprettylike

**seanderlust** (8.4): "he just turns around and goes, “Hey disco tits, let’s go.” And I was like, “Wow, that’s me.”" she is amazing holy shit

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I’m not scared of a lot of people but I live in fear of those who have flashed their tits when this song has come on

**nooodisaster** (7.5): 'disco tits' aka 'how to kill your career in one horribly chosen lead single' aka 'the straights just couldn't handle this one'

**akanewasright** (7): This song is perfect, I’m just tired of it because I overplayed it.

# Nipples are Flaccid

**InternetDude19** (7): It's good but I've never understood why you guys seem to love it so much. The title is the best part of the song.

**ReallyCreative** (6): love the production, but everything else is super overrated by this sub not gonna lie. the vocal delivery detracts from the rest of the song really really badly, it just doesn't work for me

**aresthormars** (5): It is an okay song!

**Frelock\_** (5): Just not my type. But still well executed.

**pat-rickstar** (5): It's grown on me a bit since the rate it won buuuut…. I still don’t really know what you guys see in this song I'm sorry

**jsonphile** (4): uhhhh I don’t get this song. But since this is the only song on here I ranked lower than a 5, the only one I actually dislike (and not even that much), I guess good job on all the other rates popheads

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this is just….noise

**wavingwolves** (4): this song came and went and i already don't remember what it sounds like

**intheaftermath** (3): I've never loved the delivery of this song. It sounds uncomfortable, or at least makes me feel that way?

**fadedblue09** (2.5): I don't like disco and I don't like tits, so I guess it's fair to say I don't like this as well? (No, seriously, it's boring?? How do people like this?)

**welcometoNY** (2): yeah this is pretty embarassing.

**bulforster** (1): (#49) I like this even less than when I first heard it in its rate, those stupid laugh noises make me feel like I'm being trolled.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): this is like those threads that said “make a title/song lyrics for a fake song by your fave and have people guess who it is”

**selegend** (1): annoying

**starlitsuns** (1): Call me whatever you want, but this song did nothing for me.

# /u/hikkaru are you gonna fight them now

**CrimsonROSET** (0): A lot of people are gonna be mad and honestly they deserve it for thinking this is salvageable in any way, shape or form.

**SmileAndTears** (0): Jesus christ why would you want to make music that sounds like this. And how did this win a rate

**steelstepladder** (0): Oops my hand slipped

> Strangers is how most of the pop world was introduced to Sigrid. This was her breakthrough hit in the UK and won her the BBC Sound of 2018. A tight, cohesive synthpop bop, it's no wonder this song toom off with pop fans. It's also very relatable. Its lyrics about love, uncertainty, and lonelieness are more candid than a lot of pop songs, and that's part of what makes this song so relatable. - /u/static_int_husp

---

Sigrid's budding career was comprised of "Don't Kill My Vibe" and its many rehashes — rehashes that would last well into her debut album — but it was "Strangers" that really showed that she could take on a different style, even if that style was a bit rote. Yes, we've heard these churning, building synths before, and we've had many songs with this exact title and this exact subject matter, but Sigrid's take on it all remains joyous to listen to. It's a rollicking good time, prime for Scandinavian pop playlists on Spotify, and despite the song being about the loss of love, you can't deny how it makes you want to swing along with her.

letsallpoo: # Hanne Mjøen is Shaking

**aresthormars** (10): One of my fave from Sucker Punch!

**bespectacIed** (10): I loved this rate so much. What a great winner, I was rooting for her and Maggie equally. It also made me less indifferent abt king princess, she had bops. Sigrid queen of white pop!

**CarlieScion** (10): iconic. show-stopping. never the same.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): How can you not love Sigrid?

**frogaranaman** (10): hearing this live was life changing

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): this is what falling in love with a beautiful stranger in the train feels like

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a megabop

**ManofOranges** (10): The superior song called strangers by a swedish singer. This one actually has some meat on its bones. There's actually something interesting going on here!

**runaway3212** (10): See my commentary at "Hanne Mjøen - Strangers"

**Stryxen** (10): I was so close to giving my 11 to Sigrid song in hopes it doesn’t go out day 1 AGAIN

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): POWERFUL chorus, the PERCUSSION

**1998tweety** (9): Massive bop

**anothertown** (9): it could neva be us… eh.. just u and i

**astrologicalangel** (9): the superior of the two 'strangers' songs

**bbfan132** (9): i thought i was going to like it less now but it’s still a total bop, the hook is perfect

**CrimsonROSET** (9): Sigrid is honestly great, y'all just mean.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): I prefer Don't Kill My Vibe but this was an explosive song

**PuggleMaster** (9): OMG I WAS SO WORRIED THIS SONG DIDN'T WIN IT'S RATE WHEN I SAW THE OTHER STRANGERS. I hope y'all make the correct decision and put this above the other one....

**selegend** (9): B O P

**vayyiqra** (9): I am once again giving a high score to a synth banger by a Scandinavian girl

**waluigiest** (9): one of my favorite albums (and songs) that I was introduced to by a rate <3

**bigbigbee** (8.8): For this rate, I watched all the music videos of the songs I hadn’t heard before to give them a fair shot against the songs that I was already very familiar with. This song was 100% the one that was most boosted by its video – Sigrid is SO charismatic in the MV that it made me connect with the song more. I’m charmed. Highly recommend people watch the video!

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): She sounds like a goat in the chorus

**lIIustration** (8): slow, but the lyrics are so entrancing

**ReallyCreative** (8): the superior Strangers of this rate, but the fact that this song beat Don't Feel Like Crying is kind of a crime against humanity but whatever

**skargardin** (8): Sigrid comeback when

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): wow the world was legit just built different in 2017 tbh

**twat\_brained** (8): killer chorus but that bridge just undoes the song for me. Hanne's Strangers

**steelstepladder** (7.5): Think it's a touch overrated but still solid in most respects.

**aestheticen** (7): Once again, I listened it too much back then

**seanderlust** (7): it's weird that there are two songs named strangers in this rate. that's not why I rated it a 7, just thought i'd comment.

# Hopefully Not King Princess Stans

**Frelock\_** (6): Meh verses but fun chorus.

**moonagenightmares** (6): this could’ve been so good if not for the extremely basic production

**nooodisaster** (6): I feel like I was one of the lowest scores for this in the original rate and then it won... I truly lost that rate.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Maybe it’s just that my tastes have shifted but this kind of sweeping synthpop has kinda started to sound empty to me, it’s like all of the noise and cavernous production is trying to compensate for soul that just isn’t there. It’s something that’s always kept me from connecting with Sigrid’s music in general, her songs are technically flawless but there’s just something missing, I don’t really get a lot of heart. Don’t come at me stans!

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is lowkey boring

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): remember that thing i keep saying about netflix movie music? you won't be able to unhear it.

**bulforster** (3.6): (#35) The chorus is great but the rest of the song doesn't really carry its weight.

**fadedblue09** (3): For an upbeat song, this is so bland and lifeless. I'd take Hanne Mjøen any day, thank you.

**welcometoNY** (3): i really don't get the hype with this song, and i've definitely tried. it's aggressively forgettable, the melody is grating, and the lyrics are laughable. i've managed to get into some of her other work but this song is just not for me.

Like I know objectively it’s not the best song on the rate. I just have a personal connection to that whole album.

It came out during a good time in my life, I remember jamming hard to this song at pride with my best friend, and like I miss those times 2020 is rough okay.

> In hindsight, "Hot N Cold" can sort of be used as a microcosmic evaluation of Katy's career; white-hot in the early part, from her One of the Boys' release in 2008 to her Super Bowl Halftime Show performance in 2015, only to burn out so fast in 2017 as Katy shorn her black tresses and sex appeal, and frankly, I don't think that's fair. While I can't say I'm too impressed with Katy's recent behavior, I certainly hope her newfound motherhood helps steer her in the right direction as she continues to rediscover her personal joy. - /u/twat_brained 

> I remember waking up every morning for school and the music video for Hot N Cold would be playing on MTV. I was still closeted back then and I hated pop music, but Katy rly did smth with this whole album and made light pop rock music sexy and acceptable for my secret little gay heart to obsess over without anyone thinking it was weird. While not my favorite on the album (Fingerprints, whew), Hot N Cold is one of Katys most iconic songs, and totally a song that unlocks the nostalgia in absolutely anyone. - /u/shipsinker44

> Re: the rate - "Britney was robbed."

> Re: Hot N Cold: - "an instant classic and invented pop music." - /u/Spankky1

"I Kissed a Girl" may have landed Katy Perry on the map, but it was "Hot N Cold" that proved that she wasn't just going to be a one hit wonder. In comparison to her first hit, this song turns down on the problematicness (but not entirely — the bipolar line hasn't aged the best) and turned up the electropop and the antonyms. I remember listening to this on my sister's iPod in 2009 and I literally felt myself turning gay, especially as I found myself listening to it again and again and again. And when I first saw the music video? Those zombie brides on bicycles are forever ingrained in my mind. It's just a master class in how catchy and powerful a pop song can be, and while I'm not too chuffed to see it this low, I'll forever associate this song with that era of pop music. Now go and stream *Smile* — Daisy Perry Bloom needs a new set of bibs.

letsallpoo: # Hot

**1998tweety** (10): Easily one of the best rate winners ever. It was so delicious seeing all the meltdowns from Swifties cause Katy rightfully won the rate. Stay bitter <3

**aresthormars** (10): Classic Katy Perry. Very catchy and the guitars are amazing.

**cocosairdep** (10): One of the most catchy, fun and danceable songs of all time, and one of Katy’s best. I’m so sad I don’t have more 11s :(

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): God, I miss being a KatyCat. :(

**runaway3212** (10): This was the first track I knew by heart

**selegend** (10): dr luke peaked creatively this period

**suhonyu** (10): the collapseeee

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): you know she deserves a 10 after all she's been through

**TiltControls** (10): The song that turned me around on Katy. Although I Kissed a Girl grew on me later, I thought nothing of her til I heard this. With the followup of Waking Up in Vegas and the whole Teenage Dream era I did a full 180 on her.

**twat\_brained** (10): Stream Smile so Daisy Dove can eat tonight

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): This was my by far my favourite song when I was like 8 and I couldn't speak English yet lmao

**worlds-okayest666** (10): yes this aged like milk yes i still love it no i will not apologize

**addupten** (9.5): a freaking HIT

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9.5): KPs best single off this album

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Lemme pretend I didn't hear that bridge :)

**mysario** (9.4): it sounds so dated but that's in the charm

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): invented IcyHot

**bbfan132** (9): brings me back to 2009 when i saw her live at six flags great adventure

**Frelock\_** (9): A good romp. Classy and fun.

**jasannn** (9): As a kid, I remember thinking it was so scandalous that she used the word "bitch" in this song but the song still defined my childhood.

**ManofOranges** (9): Yeah this song is just very good to me

**raicicle** (9): the only reason I’m giving this a 9 and not a 10 is because katy actually is so good that this doesn’t even register as one of her best songs for me

**Tolk1en** (9): her best song by far, eternal bop

**slimboyfriend** (8.6): only girls change their clothes!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): *One of the Boys* is probably the Katy album I listen to the most but I low-key skip this one most of the time, it feels painfully dated. Although it was ahead of its time on the whole ‘80s revival thing its take on the sound was kinda rudimentary and the language/casual misogyny didn’t age well at all, but it’s still kinda a banger.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Waking Up in Vegas should have won instead of this

**starlitsuns** (8.5): Not a lot to say about this one. This is classic Katy Perry, so I have no choice but to bop.

**akanewasright** (8): Slaps

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I forgot how awful she sounds on the verses here. The song is near perfect otherwise.

**kirby31200** (8): One of the Boys era Katy is my favorite Katy. If Waking Up in Vegas were here instead, it would've been an 11 contender

**nooodisaster** (8): It's fun.

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): bitch this song is amazing. is it a bit pick me - internalized sexism- yes, especially in the beginning, but then. then that chorus hits, her voice gets deeper and raspier and it's just infectious and poppy and one of the few songs that i can still listen to off this album.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): fun!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): so many kids learned opposites from this song that katy perry has more worth than most elementary school teachers

**waluigiest** (8): this really prepped her for the teenage dream era what a great moment in pop history

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.4): me when i’m trying to defrost chicken in the microwave

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): This song is forever tied with Masterchef Australia for me

**WeastofEden44** (7.3): Just say you have daddy issues

**CarlieScion** (7): love story deserved

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): i used to love this but its just okay now

**CrimsonROSET** (7): One of the Boys was her problematic era, huh? Like, she’d for sure get cancelled for some of this shit today.

**engifear** (7): It's a jam, but holy shit these lyrics have aged poorly. Honestly they were probably aged when they came out, but I didn't notice bc I was 10 years old.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): ngl this sounds so dated to me now

**InternetDude19** (7): This sound hasn't aged well.

**seanderlust** (7): late 2000s vibes

**steelstepladder** (7): Katy has better songs but this is still great.

**vayyiqra** (7): Kind of catchy but she has better songs

**shhhneak** (6.9): YOU PEE A MESS LIKE A BITCH I WOULD KNOW.

# Cold. im very clever with these as you can see. jk someone please kill me i dont know what im doing

**anothertown** (6): Katy was so obsessed with the intricacies of whether or not men conformed to gender norms

**camerinian** (6): I have not had any desire to listen to this song past 2010

**intheaftermath** (6): oh my god i did not realize how horrible the non-radio edit lyrics were. You PMS like a bitch??? what???

**Roxieloxie** (6): its no part of me/wide awake

**Stryxen** (5.2): cold > hot

**bigbigbee** (5): I’ve never gotten this song, and I LOVE a lot of stuff on One Of The Boys. (Stream Fingerprints and Waking Up in Vegas, lol) I honestly think it’s pretty melodically AND lyrically boring.

**nootnoot781** (5): this won a rate? which one was that the most mediocre songs of the late 2000s?

**skargardin** (5): as a winner among winners this is not the strongest song

**wavingwolves** (5): this song reminds me of an ex girlfriend i had who said this made her think of me and a few months later i got diagnosed with bipolar disorder

**fadedblue09** (4): Look, I love Katy and I love One of the Boys, but I never considered this as one of my favorites. It sounds so plastic compared to the rest of the album’s rawness, and also when are we gonna discuss that its lyrics are kinda YIKES (that PMS lyric, “like a girl changes clothes…”, etc.)?

**hunnybee12** (4): you pee a mess like a bitch i would know

**bespectacIed** (3): pop perfection but at what cost

**ImADudeDuh** (3): i stay certain that this song’s production has aged like milk.

**bulforster** (2.8): (#39) I used to really like this song but the verses are pretty weak and the chorus isn't a strong as I remember.

**welcometoNY** (1): pretty typical bland pop song, but loses marks for the inexcusable "you PMS like a bitch" line.

> ‘Russian Roulette’ is a somewhat unlikely winner for the sub’s K-pop rate. It doesn’t quintessentially play into either the Red or Velvet concepts that Red Velvet had been cultivating up to that point, nor does it have the same Western pop bravado that other K-pop acts like BLACKPINK deal in. Instead what Red Velvet serve up is an effervescent bit of chiptune-flavored bubblegum pop that is uncomplicated, surprisingly traditional yet endlessly rewarding. K-pop has always been a visual-focused industry and it certainly helps that ‘Russian Roulette’ has one of the most memorable videos amongst those rated—pastel Tom and Jerry deadpan murder with killer choreo to match—but the song and its naggingly sugary hooks evokes the exact same joy even without the visuals. The concept is strong, and the execution is stronger, thanks to tightly stacked harmonies and meticulously enunciated syllables (check out the little variations in articulation in the first verse). By the time the hilariously indulgent chiptune synth solo comes in, it’s practically a victory lap since you’d been sold within the first minute anyway. - /u/raicicle 

> I’ll never forget the moment when /u/raicicle and I put in work to make the sub’s first K-pop rate amass over 160 participants, and I’ll also never forget the bloodbath that ensued thereafter. Seven of K-pop’s greatest groups of our time and Momoland competed for a chance at the podium just for Red Velvet to deservingly perform a podium sweep. I honestly could not have seen any song other than Russian Roulette winning - it’s delightfully saccharine juxtaposed in its video with clips of the members murdering each other in the most ridiculous and comical ways. It’s gorgeous K-pop that doesn’t overstate its quirkiness with harsh noises but instead expresses it with colorful vocals and adorable pieces of 8-bit music. I hope this being in a foreign language won’t hinder its performance in this rate too much because it truly is a phenomenal synth-pop song. - /u/selegend

My first exposure to Red Velvet came from the gritty, viciously girly "Ice Cream Cake," which felt like *Lollipop Chainsaw* distilled into a three-minute song. It was fun and upbeat bubblegum pop poured into a murderous mold, and this concoction of intense innocence hooked me instantly. They tried this blend out multiple times, but it's with "Russian Roulette" that they got the perfect formula. It's all evident just seven seconds in, where that distorted, muffled cry operates as part orgasm, part asphyxiation, and you have to listen on to see which one it is. 

It's a perfect song. Not a perfect pop song, or a perfect kpop song. It's perfect because it accomplishes everything that it sets out to do, and then some. The arrhythmic heartbeat hook, the blank delivery coupled with coquettish gasps, the way the chorus winds itself around you — it's so infectious, like the best songs and the deadliest diseases. The video is perfect as well, featuring the girls killing each other in the most pastel YMCA ever in between shots of them dancing gleefully. Kpop is known as a generally light and fluffy style of music, but "Russian Roulette" takes this concept and lacerates you with it.

Red Velvet didn't ever really try out this kind of style again, which disappointed me until I realized that there wasn't any point — this was enough. My interest in the group has waned over the years, but even though their career may be reaching its final days (I can't see ["Black Mamba"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeerrnuLi5E) as anything other than Red Velvet's death knell), I'll always love this group and this song. Now, can someone make an edit without Irene?

**aestheticen** (11): The best Red Velvet title track, and the literal song embodiment of pastel colours

**anothertown** (11): I love everything about this song but the best part about it is that it seems to sound manic while not having a very high BPM

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): Damn, I wished Twice or Blackpink won the K-pop rate but Red Velvet is a well-deserved winner. Russian Roulette is definitely my first song from them and this still sounds fresh today. Since 2020 is the year I finally became a K-pop stan, I am giving this bop my 11.

**fadedblue09** (11): Originally this comment was supposed to be more positive and gushy about how I'm grateful to have discovered RV's discography and all that, but the recent issues made me think now isn’t the time for that. (P.S. EXID deserved better in that rate btw).

**hunnybee12** (11): Her face is wasted on her.

**imasalesman** (11): This is literally one of the greatest songs of all time

**intheaftermath** (11): I've only had Russian Roulette for 48 hours, but if anything were to happen to her... I never heard this song before this rate but I love everything about it. The minor steps on "Russian Roulette!", the small harmonies, oh my god

=====

letsallpoo: # Reveluvs (i will never get used to that fanbase name)

**1998tweety** (10): kpop excellence. I'm sure the people who tank this cause "they can't get into k-pop cause of the language barrier" are probably Ariana stans.

**astrologicalangel** (10): the video just makes it better

**bespectacIed** (10): Awww i love the first kpop rate, it felt like a protest in a time (not that long ago lmao) when the sub was still xenophobic about the genre. The tastelessness of the results still makes me irk (loona and exid robbed!). But wow what an amazing winner, we love murderous pretty girls on a catchy electropop beat. Red Velvet deserved the sweep but i was so sure Bad Boy would win, smack cam!

**CarlieScion** (10): the best kpop song in this rate

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): can Irene bully me next pls

**cremeebrulee** (10): wtff this bops

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m forever obsessed with this song. The icy beats, the cutesy but detached vocals, the intriguing interplay of innocence with violence, this straddles the line between mainstream appeal and absolute weirdness so perfectly and it’s exactly what we need more of in pop music. It’s a shame that it’s looking like Red Velvet won’t be around for much longer to be the ones to bring it to us but you can pry their discography from my cold dead hands.

**hikkaru** (10): when this gets robbed bc popheads refuses to stan kpop despite this being electropop perfection

**ImADudeDuh** (10): omg we love kpop

**jasannn** (10): I can't give this anything less than a 10 as a Revuluv.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the way i know the kpop in this rate will flop

**PuggleMaster** (10): Another one of my 11s making it on this list. We love to see it. One of the best K-Pop songs of all time. I miss them :sob: Damn you Irene!!!!!

**raicicle** (10): iconic

**Roxieloxie** (10): okay Red Velvet Delivering another bop!

**runaway3212** (10): Rihanna got outsold here

**sarcasticsobs** (10): LA. LA-LA. LA. LA-LA-LA. LA-LA-A-A-A-A-LA-LA. LA-AH-AH-AH-AAIEE

**wavingwolves** (10): in a perfect world this would be a top 10 song

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i know this is gonna go out early bc “ew k-pop” which makes me SO mad because this is a perfect pop song and i know y’all would eat it up if a white pop girlie put it out. the vocal chops alone, man! THE VOCAL CHOPS!!!

**bigbigbee** (9.5): The better of the two k-pop songs here, and I say that as someone with great nostalgia for 2nd gen k-pop.

**camerinian** (9.5): finally, a kpop group I think I stan. This is a bop of the highest order

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Red Velvet don’t miss

**zadooi** (9.5): rip Irene

**mysario** (9.2): I'm gonna play Persona 5 Royal after this is done

**ReallyCreative** (9): ok kpop girls, y'all brought some bops

**seanderlust** (9): oh this is cute! I haven't taken much time to get into red velvet, but maybe this is a good place to start.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): ok i don’t normally like kpop but ill admit this is a fucking bop

**waluigiest** (9): this is glittery and fun :)

**twat\_brained** (8.5): good but nowhere near as catchy or as recurrent in pop discussion as "Girl Front", that should've won.

**lIIustration** (8.3): this hypes me up

**CrimsonROSET** (8): This song is just a lot of fun, I don't know what to say.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): Irene why did you have to ruin this for us

**kirby31200** (8): This is cute and I love the production

**ManofOranges** (8): This is the kind of kpop I was hoping to hear. It's got that certain kind of flair to it, and it's just very enticing to the ear. There's nothing technically wrong with it, which is the best kind of not wrong.

**skargardin** (8): [place irene comment here]

**Stryxen** (8): ok BANGER

**suhonyu** (8): still interesting that this won, love the song but yeah I don't think about the song much

**vayyiqra** (8): Russian roulette is not normally as much fun as this song from what I can tell

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): This is cute oooh!

**bulforster** (7.6): (#15) I really didn't expect to rate a song I'd never heard before, in a language I don’t understand, higher than 70% of this stacked as fuck rate but it actually is just that good.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): A cute, funky little track. Harmless but not that impactful in the rate really

**addupten** (7.5): I haven't really explored kpop much but I really like this

**bbfan132** (7.5): cute song!! not my favorite but still

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Unintentionally or intentionally this seems really dark lyrically? But you know I'm bopping.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): It's ok I guess

**steelstepladder** (7.5): The better of the two Kpop songs here but I'm still not crazy for it.

**Frelock\_** (7): Catchy tune!

**Ionlywanttheworld** (7): I'm not a big kpop listener but this was good!

# #psycho #monster

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): For once I'm undisturbed by the word "Russian".

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I was waiting for the part where they played Russian roulette

**InternetDude19** (5.5): I still don't understand this stuff.

**jsonphile** (5.5): yeah I don’t get k pop

**team\_kockroach** (5): Not even remotely close to Genie in its quality.

**fishingfor8** (4): too video gamey

**aresthormars** (1): Not a fan of this song.

# red velvet SWEETIES

> I don't know where you are right now. You're likely mad that this song won or that it got so far that it had a chance of winning in the first place (I would be pleasantly surprised if this didn't age well). It's impressive how a song that received zero negative comments and a lowest score of merely two 5s in its original rate earns so much ire. It's a hidden and much-coveted reward in and of itself; we're in such unanimous agreement that something is really good that we just want some underdog to beat it because it would be interesting. But would it be correct? Well yes, actually, but let's put that aside.

> Compare this song to "Just Dance", the previously released Normal song from the era. Both songs play like robotic, glitzy club hits, yet "Poker Face" carries that big Statement in my eyes. No, I'm not talking about the allusions to bisexuality (which is much appreciated), but you can hear in that dark and cavernous intro alone the makings of a true pop star. It's like an invitation to get a glimpse at the next big thing as she makes yet another stunning entrance. On the side, we also have RedOne finding the peak of his sound (foreshadowing "Bad Romance"), so that's a bonus. - /u/ExtraEater 

 > I am very upset I am not writing a blurb on the iconic Disturbia. Poker Face is fine. Ehhh. It's alright. Like outside of "Poke her face" jokes and giving casino scenes in tv/movies a new song to play, Poker Face has not given much to us. Society has advanced passed the need for Poker Face. Stream Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded. - /u/ImADudeDuh

---

Y'all know this song. Do I really have to say anything about it? Okay, here: "Poker Face" is the reason Lady Gaga is the star she is today. No it's not the only reason, but the success of this electropop excellence is what solidified her as a global force, and everything else that's followed in her career can be traced back to here. It's the sound of 2009 (making it a worthy winner of its rate, admittedly), the sound of a club at peak hours, the sound of a 5'2 pop star stomping her stiletto on the floor and saying, "I'm here." It's one of the reasons I'm gay, tbh.

"Poker Face" was released as the second single to Lady Gaga's debut album, *The Fame*. After the success of "Just Dance," her newfound audience was ready for more, and they gobbled up this song readily. It rather infamously only god a single week at #1, though — apparently Interscope had to step in and remove "Right Round" from iTunes to get it there, and that somehow wouldn't be the first time Kesha would cockblock her! But it was a massive, career-defining moment for the current Amazon makeup lady, and if anything should've gotten a teensy bit higher.

letsallpoo: # Kindness Punks

**aresthormars** (10): Classic Gaga. I will forever associate this song during the earliest years of my life when I am so confused of who I am!

**bbfan132** (10): that chorus is so euphoric, ugh

**bespectacIed** (10): nothing else to say, Gaga literally shifted pop with this.

**cocosairdep** (10): Such an iconic song and music video. Gaga’s best song after Bad Romance imo. God I wish I had more 11s, this just feels sacrilegious.

**Frelock\_** (10): Iconic Lady Gaga

**frogaranaman** (10): damn young me was HORNY singing this song

**hikkaru** (10): gaga winning would be really boring and she'll probably have the top 2 but idc this classic is a 10

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Definitely my favorite Gaga song from this era

**Ionlywanttheworld** (10): iconic

**jackisboredtoday** (10): god i miss this electroclash production in the mainstream so damn much… feel like pure shit just want her back

**kirby31200** (10): Ingrained into me and every other zoomer

**ManofOranges** (10): This is another song I don't see doing well. Rihanna's probably gonna get her revenge with this one. Still a great song though!

**pat-rickstar** (10): Fu-fu-fu fuck her face

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): and again, a contender for my 11. i bought this album for 9 dollars at a Navy Exchange a month or two after it came out, and I thought i would never hear the name lady gaga again, and then she blew the fuck up. point being, i was a lady gaga hipster and you can all suck it. this song is amazing, and it changed the landscape of pop music in a lot of ways. i thought i would never forgive it after that glee cover, but man, i heard this song when i was drunk and it was like i was possessed by lady gaga herself. amazing!

**PuggleMaster** (10): I'll never forget walking the hallways of my middle school with this song stuck in my head. Such good memories.

**ReallyCreative** (10): while I would rather several other songs win, it's going to be entertaining to see the 5-6 grifters in the comments leading up to the top 10/top 5 pretend this song is awful because they don't want to be like other girls

**runaway3212** (10): This song is way too good to be heard by our human ears

**skargardin** (10): snapped

**Tolk1en** (10): I have so many memories attached to this song. Especially I remember how the media treated Gaga, how they discovered this worldwide phenomenon, and we all began to realize that a star was born

**twat\_brained** (10): there's no excuse for this losing Song of the Year to Single Ladies please stop watching the Grammys

**1998tweety** (9): bop but lowkey one of her weaker hits ddd

**mysario** (9): :flushed:

**slimboyfriend** (9): queen of getting the word fuck on the radio

**waluigiest** (9): I wish I knew I was gay when this came out :(

**WeastofEden44** (9): I want to roleplay as the Centaur from Percy Jackson while some daddy Lotus Eaters lures me into their lair 😌

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): This song was EVERYWHERE when I was a child and I still remember being lowkey obsessed with Gaga because of it (and I still am ofc)

**TiltControls** (8.7): Still holds up to this day

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): this is better than bad romance btw

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The music video was the beginning of my queer awakening.

**starlitsuns** (8.5): Rick Riordan stans are going to come after me for mentioning this, but including Poker Face in the Lotus Casino scene in the horrible adaptation of the first film was a choice well made. (Also, stream the Disney+ series when it comes out on Disney+ since it has Rick Riordan’s blessing attached to it.)

**anothertown** (8): the rare synthpop song that actually comes to life when done as a piano version, the versatility, the duality. There is a charm to this that has endured and bridge great, but there isn’t as much to it as other songs from this era

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): paparazzi outsold

**InfernalSolstice** (8): the more aged gaga song here but still boppy

**kappyko** (8): the bridge made me into who i am today

**Stryxen** (8): lady gaga used to scared me when I was younger

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): how many times have we rated this 🥴

**vayyiqra** (8): I like this song but always felt it was one of the weaker singles from The Fame

**SmileAndTears** (7.8): It's overplayed as fuck. Otherwise it would've gotten a higher score

**seanderlust** (7.6): *michael scott voice* it's britney, bitch.

**jsonphile** (7.5): Just Dance is the superior song from The Fame

**engifear** (7.4): TIL the lyrics are not "She's got that limbo body."

**bulforster** (7.2): (#17) A hit right from that iconic intro synth line.

**CarlieScion** (7.1): u happy /u/leixander

**akanewasright** (7): ...this song brings back bad memories.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Throwback to me hearing this on the radio as a kid and thinking Lady Gaga was black. I have nostalgia for this song because I did really like it as a kid but everything about Gaga’s discography afterwards just makes it sound so cheap and thin. Like I can’t go back to this after *Born This Way* and *ARTPOP* showed us Gaga’s true potential.

**joshually** (7): only the chorus is great TBH

**plastichaxan** (7): this is a blasphemy rating to 11 year old me i’m sorry kid

# Is Not Purchasing Haus Labs (Now $8.99 on Amazon)

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): Fucker Face

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I only play MTG.

**InternetDude19** (6): Fuck her face.

**steelstepladder** (6): Oooooooo returning to this song it's... actually not as good as I remember. I respect it for it's influence over pop music in the last decade but Just Dance is so much better I have to be honest

**zadooi** (6): Probably the weakest single from that era tbh.

**bigbigbee** (5.5): I liked this song when it was released, but IDK, I just think it doesn’t hold up to time that well. (Just Dance holds up much better IMO.) It’s fine!

**hunnybee12** (5): I have a distinct memory of a kid at recess asking me how you wake up lady gaga and thinking it was the funniest thing ever

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is very overrated.

**racloves** (5): how do you annoy Lady Gaga? Poke her face

**welcometoNY** (3.5): i've never gotten the hype. aggressively average song

**fadedblue09** (3): Lmao one of the Gaga songs that I can't stand! I always found this annoying and that bridge is especially atrocious. I certainly don't miss the times that this was being played everywhere.

**wavingwolves** (2): one of her worst singles and i say this as a fan

**CrimsonROSET** (1): You know those scenes in movies where someone is drugged out of their minds, and it flashes how shit the party is in-between black screens as shorthand to the person we're following blacking out? This is that in song form.

**Awkward\_King** (0): i'm sorry it's one of my least favourite gaga songs and i love gaga

And our first artist with multiple songs in this rate is OUT. I'm lowkey surprised this is the higher of her two songs, and I'm also surprised by how high this is in general. But this is a good surprise, as this is still one of my favorite songs from her. I love the plain delivery of the verses compared to the rollercoaster of emotions in the chorus, as you can literally hear her voice go high and low, ebbing and flowing with her shifting moods. Her portrayal of substance abuse and heartache and whatnot is pretty boilerplate, but there's still a cathartic energy being unleashed throughout the song that I still find enjoyable even after so many streams. Notably, this was Tove's big breakout single both worldwide and in the United States, and it's a wholly deserving one — as long as you ignore that Hippie Sabotage Remix thing.

=====

letsallpoo: # High (Get it? I'm setting up another antonym thing!)

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop, original is MUCH better than the remix

**akanewasright** (10): A fucking perfect song. Also - I have to appreciate that this song was written for a completely different EP, but then flawlessly put into a completely different album. QOTC is a really masterful album, but this song is its centerpiece.

**aresthormars** (10): Love this so much! I love it when we were playing pool with my friends.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): If Dancing On My Own is overplayed during my episodes of loneliness, then I play this song. This is Tove Lo's signature song for a reason.

**frogaranaman** (10): my dad loves her

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love disco tits but this is definitely her better song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): thinking about that tweet that said “she made the best song of the 2010’s and then dipped” and then they replied to their own tweet saying “ok ok, I get it, I’ll listen to Blue Lips and Lady Wood”

**ManofOranges** (10): Pure bop, and it's kind of iconic how this song technically both won and lost its rate.

**nootnoot781** (10): but the hippie sabotage remix is a 0

**PuggleMaster** (10): I can't wait until I expierence heart ache like this.

**skargardin** (10): still her magnum opus to me, her songwriting, raw vocals, everything is just so perfect here

**twat\_brained** (10): Tove's raw honesty is just something else entirely; I fucking love her

**vayyiqra** (10): :pensivehorny:

**worlds-okayest666** (10): the way radio stations everywhere heard this song about sex clubs, fucking dads, and throwing up in tubs and went YUP we need to play this 24/7...her power

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.8): :(

**mysario** (9.7): do people not normally eat food in their bathtub?

**astrologicalangel** (9): aaaand I'm crying

**intheaftermath** (9): i made a my little pony amv to this song in middle school. Rarity vibes, I guess?

**lIIustration** (9): we are in a pandemic so don’t go to any sex clubs thanks

**nooodisaster** (9): she laff she cri but most importantly she gotta stay high

**ReallyCreative** (9): I've never touched marijuana in my life but this song makes me feel things?? idk maybe weed girl made a point

**SmileAndTears** (9): Bop

**Stryxen** (9): thinking of that girl’s tweet that called tove a one hit wonder and her dozens of stans forced her to apologise

**waluigiest** (9): I thought this was so deep when I was 17 lol

**WeastofEden44** (8.9): Sometimes I just get really stoned, stay up until 5am, and roll along my wall all horny while listening to Tove Lo

**fishingfor8** (8): still like this more than I should

**Frelock\_** (8): Powerful emotions behind it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): It’s so weird to listen back to Tove’s early work because she’s trying to project the image that she’s some kind of vocal powerhouse (something a lot of artists do on their debuts) and I’m glad she found her more subdued sound later in her career. This is still a total banger though!

**pat-rickstar** (8): The superior Tove song in this rate and you can't convince me otherwise

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): honestly i dont remember i was probably fucked up ya i was crazy back then

**bigbigbee** (7.8): I can’t believe I like this song now. I couldn’t stand the chorus vocals on the radio circa 2015ish. It grew on me after relistening and knowing that a bunch of people on popheads like it…am I a sheeple? :thinking:

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): I will never listen to this song without thinking of "this bitch dropped the song of the decade then dipped" tweet

**anothertown** (7): I thought this was Miley for the longest time when this came out, that would have been a serve.

**CarlieScion** (7): very generic tove

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Tove Lo has way better songs on her debut, but everyone loves it and I don't really mind.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): I used to dislike this song and then I realized that I was hearing that god awful remix

**runaway3212** (7): I prefer the habits remix

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this is alright but i always liked talking body more and think it deserved to be her bigger hit

# These are the negative comments. What, did you think I would say "Low" or something? You fool. You absolute ignoramus.

**bbfan132** (6.5): this is decent but i’ve never understood the love for this tbh

**bespectacIed** (6): a role model

**camerinian** (6): I love the storytelling and image crafted by this song, but, like, you could have livened it up a bit

**CrimsonROSET** (6): 'High all the time to keep you off my mind' is a good feeling to have towards this song.

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): the remix elevates this song so much that i hadn't realized i'd never heard the original. it's not bad, but it's so basic.

**InternetDude19** (5): I never want to hear the word 'greasy' in a pop song every again.

**steelstepladder** (4): I just don't like Tove Lo. This is so nail on the head obvious in terms of addiction songs but even compared to songs like Under the Bridge, Not an Addict, or even Chandelier from the same year it falls way short.

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): hab1ts

**fadedblue09** (1): You know what, maybe her music isn't for me. I was actually itching to skip this because of how irritating her voice was.

**kappyko** (1): this awful ass song....

**welcometoNY** (1): bland and uninspired with a grating melody. you're not quirky for eating twinkies in the bathtub. shut up.

**bulforster** (0): (#50) Sorry Tove Lo stans, I flat hate her lyrics and this instrumental is also really boring.

> What most of the top songs in the One Hit Wonderland rate have in common is that they're arguably not by OHWs. Or at least the bands/artists involved had *some* form of success beyond the one song. The Cardigans had successful followups in "My Favorite Game" and "Erase/Rewind", Trevor Horn and Gregg Alexander racked up hits behind the scenes, Martha Wash of the fucking Weather Girls [was the voice of 90s house music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18N2k1TBBRE). Turns out, if you can make one great song, you can usually make another!

> And so it is with A-ha. While they only graced the Hot 100 twice after "Take On Me" ("The Sun Always Shines On TV", which hit #20, and "Cry Wolf"), they had a 25 year stretch of critical and commercial success in the UK and their home country of Norway. "Hunting High and Low", "Crying in the Rain", "Summer Moved On", "Manhattan Skyline", "Analogue", all brilliant tracks, as good as anything by Tears For Fears or Duran Duran. But "Take On Me" is easily the best work. The synth lead? Iconic. The climbing falsetto? Iconic. The semi-gibberish lyrics? *Iconic*. In other words, they weren't a generic synthpop act that got lucky with the greatest music video of all time. (though it sure helped).

> Last year the band released [an extensive four part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlTHJJX7QVU) documentary about Take On Me's music video, reuniting lead vocalist Morten Harket and the MV's lead actress Bunty Bailey, who he had dated for a few years afterwards. Earlier this year it became the 2nd music video of the 80s to hit a billion views on YouTube (after Sweet Child O' Mine - goddammit straight people). - /u/GlialUreterostenosis 

> One-hit wonder is a term normally thrown away as an insult, a way to point out how an artist just got lucky and was incapable of connecting with the mainstream conscious more than once... some artists rejects this label for this exact same reason and keep trying to reach for the skies once again, some of them embrace that source of income and popularity; and, at last, some would kindly point it out how they don't technically qualify for one-hit wonder status: Norwegian band A-ha have way more hits and a big following in their native Europe, but even in the U.S., when Take On Me managed to reach the top spot based mostly on the success of its now iconic music video, they also have another Top 20 hit.

> Take On Me is the quintessential 80s song full of danceable warm synths, relatively clean lyrics and a music video for the ages, featuring an edge-cutting mixture of hand-drawn animation and live-action settings; considering all of the previously mentioned, it's not a shock that it ended up winning it's respective rate against novelty songs, maligned inescapable hits and overall terrible tunes... but what it is a shock is that A-ha rarely gets the respect they deserve more than 30 years after their debut and they continue to get dumped in the same category as La Macarena, Gerardo's Rico Suave and Gary Glitter. - /u/radiofan15

I'm gonna be honest, I first learned about this song from some cable TV special in 2006 about "viral" Internet videos, and this was #1 and they played clips of it and I thought it was lame. The song does kinda bop in a way, even though [this is just how I feel when the chorus tapers off](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DuVFbWusb4Q/maxresdefault.jpg). Scandipop is always fun, though, so I can't help but enjoy this in the very very rare instance that I'm exposed to this song. Stream "Feel This Moment" by Legend X featuring Pitbull today!

letsallpoo: # In Their Castles Golden

**aestheticen** (10): Was way ahead of its time, could have easily been a song released today

**bbfan132** (10): fun track, will always enjoy it

**camerinian** (10): I wish all pop music had tempos, riffs and vocal lines this fucking punishing

**CarlieScion** (10): norwegian legends!!! this is exactly the type of song all pop boys should be striving to make

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): [lady gaga talented meme]

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Legendary.

**frogaranaman** (10): goat music video

**ignitethephoenix** (10): mega bop

**intheaftermath** (10): Literally every part of this song is perfection. The accent, the synth, even the music video. I love it all so much.

**jasannn** (10): I'm a little ashamed discovered this song from the scene from La La Land where Ryan Gosling is playing for a 80's band at a pool party. Anyways, this song's hyperness and joyfulness never fails to cheer me up.

**pat-rickstar** (10): It's a classic how could I not

**PuggleMaster** (10): This is such a instant recognizable classic that it's hard to give it anything but a 10.

**raicicle** (10): I mean, it’s a meme but it’s a GOOD meme and also Blinding Lights is just this song

**SmileAndTears** (10): I can't believe they ripped off Blinding Lights

**starlitsuns** (10): EIGHTIES PERFECTION. Also, the Weezer cover for their Teal album slaps.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Blinding_Lights_slowed_n_reverbed.mp4

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): tik tok illustrators study this music video for racy homestuck transition tik toks

**twat\_brained** (10): finally an 80s synthpop tune that existed when Carly Rae Jepsen didn't. Yes, "How Will I Know?" is in this rate but does anyone really think it'll outrank this?

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): I mean its a bop what else can I say

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): This is no surprise that this won the One Hit Wonder rate, it's just SUCH a good song, and an absolute BLAST to sing at Karaoke

**1998tweety** (9.5): massive bop, we love a meme song

**jsonphile** (9.5): if you haven’t tried to sing those high notes and miserably failed then you haven’t known true joy in life

**seanderlust** (9.3): *trinity the tuck voice*  I don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl i'm living

**bigbigbee** (9): Everyone talks about the synth riff, but I think the vocals on this track are underrated. His voice is really soothing, something about his enunciation is appealing, and the way the chorus shows off both his lower and upper registers is really nice.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I swear, every straight guy that I meet who is obsessed with 80s male pop would say that Take on Me is their favorite song. And you know, THEY HAVE TASTE FOR ONCE. ~~Men are still trash tho~~

**fishingfor8** (9): I like his deep voice

**Frelock\_** (9): Classic. I have inherent bias for older songs.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Obviously iconic and one of the best music videos of all time.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): I wish I had his vocal range

**mysario** (9): the song that inspired "Blinding Lights" and "miiiiiiiiiiine diiiiiiiiiiiiiiamooooooooooonds"

**quinnpsych** (9): Iconic, that's all I have to say

**runaway3212** (9): When I was young my mom showed me this music video as a 'beautiful video', but I was used to Lady Gaga's videos so I thought it was pretty boring. Looking back I can say I was an idiot child

**sarcasticsobs** (9): forget the high notes, let’s talk about the BASS

**addupten** (8.4): umm can we say classic

**bulforster** (8.2): (#12) Those synth lines, that falsetto, the music video… all just unbelievably iconic.

**aresthormars** (8): It is a bop

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Iconic in the best way, honestly.

**nooodisaster** (8): A great meme song.... this won the meme rate, right?

**racloves** (8): my mums favourite song of all time

**shhhneak** (8): I’m willing to say this is the best song released in 1984.

**steelstepladder** (8): A bit too boringly perfect for me to really give it full marks. It's such a fact of life that I don't really seek it out anymore despite being a classic.

**vayyiqra** (8): Idk if the lyrics even have a meaning that can be deciphered by mortal man but it's a damn bop

**wavingwolves** (8): quite the perfect pop song

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.4): IN A DAY OR TWOOOOOOOO

**WeastofEden44** (7.4): Good for the meme

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): a defining moment in pop, that's for sure

**skargardin** (7): bop

# Lights Not Glowin'

**lIIustration** (6): I’ve always found this song to be kind of annoying

**Tolk1en** (6): iconic but boring ... :pensive:

**waluigiest** (6): I’ll admit it’s a bop but the oppressive whiteness of the Cult of Take On Me turns me off from feeling the joy I felt listening to this song about 10 years ago

**Stryxen** (5.5): I hate that this song is so annoying cos everyone else just seems to love it completely and I want that

**akanewasright** (5): I can’t wait to see what songs we rate higher than this, and for the stupid high and mighty responses that will stem from that.

**anothertown** (5): I think I remember this being big online with roflcopter, ragecomic types in the 2000s as part of an 80s kitsch revival (similar with Wake me up before you go-go, rick Astley, etc.) so I have cringe associations with this and will probably never see the art in it. Sorry.

**CreepyMannequin** (5): I never cared for this and probably never will, sorry

**fadedblue09** (5): Iconic falsetto, but that’s about it. Not worth listening in full tbh.

**fxsparrow** (5): only good thing is the iconic Melody at the start the rest is Meh!

**moooo566** (4): I don't enjoy this song sorry

**ReallyCreative** (4): one of the most overrated songs ever... it's so annoying and it's such a shame some fantastic synths were wasted on a song like this

**kappyko** (3): the version where its just the song describing the actions in the video thats a slay

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): Why does society continue to insist that this song is anything other than absolute dog sh*t? This is like, “Africa/Bohemian Rhapsody” levels of overrated. It’s the worst kind of song: it sounds annoying but old people love it so you’re gonna hear it everywhere and it’s catchy enough that it’ll haunt you even after it’s mercifully over. This is useful as an example of a Major 7th interval and nothing else.

**WillamThunderfuck** (0): Sorry but this song is so annoying, the tune has become aggrevating to me over the years and the vocals are not for me.

> Yes I am lowkey king of the popheads Lambily, back with my second Mariah addition to this rate! Winner of the Mid 2000s rate, it's not really close to my favorite Mariah song when I think about it (sorry but Cool was robbed)... but then I hear Babyface. When I actually listen to this song I'm reminded that it really is just an excellently written ballad with a catchy melody- there's a reason this catapulted her from home back to superstar, while also winning Billboard Song of the Decade after 14 weeks at #1 you know! Not much more can be said about this song as it slowly approaches Rolling In The Deep numbers of times being rated, i won't blame you all of it places a little low because of it - /u/yatcho

---

Mariah's career had a shaky start in the 2000s (Wikipedia straight up says that her "popularity had substantially declined and many had considered her career as over"), but everything changed in 2005 when she dropped this ballad. It's not the most intricate song; it's a slow burning ballad about a lost love that needs to return, and with an climactic ending where Mariah shows off her vocal pipes for a bit. Yet the song became a monstrous hit, planting itself at the top of the Hot 100 for *fourteen* weeks, even blocking herself at #2 for a bit. It wound up being the #1 song of not just that year, but of that entire decade. This song literally defined an entire decade of mainstream music in the states, and here it is at #20. Gotta love /r/popheads!

When I started getting into Mariah, this obviously was one of the first songs I was exposed to, and it quickly became one of my favorite, long after it had left the Hot 100. It's classic languorous Mariah, and you don't need much else than her crystal clear vocals set across a simple piano melody.

**plvstvcbvrds** (11): and you can fight me on that one. this song has gotten me through so many breakups. so many sets of neighbors have heard me scream sing this song after too much vodka and icecream and then mixing the vodka and icecream together and then getting sick and then crying into a half baked pan of brownies because god im such a cliche. also the kids bop version, bayyyybee that shit is comedy gold.

letsallpoo: # The Lambily

**1998tweety** (10): massive serve, love the ending

**bbfan132** (10): the second verse is the best verse of all time. sorry, i don’t make the rules

**bespectacIed** (10): One of my favorite rates ever, even though Bey lost spectacularly. Love the trashy bonus rate, the three nostalgic albums, cool being a worthy runner up, then WBT rightfully winning after 1038291 tries. KITTY KAT won with an 10.992 average, in my heart

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): kidz bop skinnier

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I really hated that I used to underestimate Mariah's songwriting before. After listening to her deep cuts from Butterfly, Mariah is not just a vocalist but a fucking songwriter. We Belong Together showcases her strongest songwriting to date, singles wise. It's an iconic classic to this date for a reason.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Enough said.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): probably my favourite from her, a classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the mariah song i would be happy with winning the rate

**J\_Toe** (10): Love how Mariah has 3 songs here - the power she has

**joshually** (10): a perfect 10 of a song, like, there is no question. This is THE comeback to define all comebacks. Written off in the worst way, Mariah came back, and MADE THIS HEARTBREAKING BALLAD *THE SONG OF THE SUMMER*… like what? It’s also like the biggest song of 2010 the decade???

**pat-rickstar** (10): That video of the woman singing this while a stretcher gets loaded into an ambulance is so funny to me

**plastichaxan** (10): the contrast of how much i don’t like aiwfciy vs how much i love this is unreal

**PuggleMaster** (10): I mean who hasn't sang this song at the top of their lungs? Voice cracking and all?

**runaway3212** (10): Iconic comeback single

**sandyfishnets** (10): GOOSEBUMPS

**skargardin** (10): iconic

**twat\_brained** (10): After I practically bullied my dad into buying "Emancipation" I don't think I'd heard this song since like 2007 lmao

**TiltControls** (9.7): Mariah showing that she's got staying power with this song. One of her more emotional non-ballad songs that dominated airwaves for good reason

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.5): I feel like dramatically throwing stuff on the floor while wearing a robe when listening to this

**aresthormars** (9): This is classic Mariah. I just noticed how sparse the production is and yet it is so beautiful!

**fadedblue09** (9): I love Mariah, don’t think this necessarily deserved to win (not when Cool by Ms. Stefani was right there) and I don’t think Emancipation is that good of an album in general, but I can't deny its power.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): it's good

**jasannn** (9): All I can think about when I listen to this song is how KidzBop version did that that one girl dirty at the end.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): the best mariah song in the rate

**ReallyCreative** (9): I have never experienced this emotion but I will be damned if I do not respect it!

**steelstepladder** (9): I like other songs of hers better but still great.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): not me sending this to my ex and getting a reply that just says “nah”

**waluigiest** (9): thinking about the cursed ending of the kids bop version lol

**worlds-okayest666** (9): “wait a minute this is too deep too deep” makes me lose it and idk why

**Stryxen** (8.7): just remembered we belong together by vampire weekend exists and lowkey sounds exactly like this lol

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): Kidz Bop version outsold

**starlitsuns** (8.5): A cute bop!

**seanderlust** (8.3): oh man, it was a good time when VH1 was playing this MV along with sugar, we're going down by FOB and hollaback girl by gwen stefani. sad gays in high school stayed winning in 2005. also god wentworth miller was/is hot.

**WeastofEden44** (8.3): ICONIC

**camerinian** (8): hyperpop has ruined me, I listened to this once on YouTube at 2x speed and I just physically never want to listen to the original anymore. I’m not balladphobic, I have low tempo friends

**CarlieScion** (8): this only had to get rated like 3 times to win

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is good but honestly it falls somewhere in the middle of the tiers of Mariah’s hits, she has many more songs that are better than this. Still, all Lambs owe this song special reverence for being the thing that more or less saved Mariah’s career/reputation so instead I’ll just say WE BELONG TOGETHERRRRRRRRRR~~~~~~~~~

**ManofOranges** (8): This song is just alright for me, but when it gets to the end and Mariah just starts belting like crazy it does hit a sweet spot for me.

**vayyiqra** (8): Mariah queen of chill lo-fi hiphop beats

**wavingwolves** (8): lush

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): We love a piano.

**Frelock\_** (7): Mariah's vocal talents on display, but background music leaves something to be desired.

**Mudkip1** (7): kidz bop outsang

**welcometoNY** (7): not Mariah's best, but a solid bop nonetheless

# JLo Stans

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): Uh... it felt like the song just went nowhere

**kappyko** (6): a no no is better

**lIIustration** (6): aged poorly and just doesn’t stand out compared to some of her other classics

**bulforster** (5.2): (#27) Obviously a smash but a bit too sparse for me.

**nooodisaster** (5): I like this song's success story for Mariah more than this song.

**Roxieloxie** (5): the kids bop version outsold

**chillbumps5** (4): the girls like you of slow r&b songs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): this puts me to sleep im sorry

> The Weeknd continues to draw from MJ as his influence in this collaboration with Daft Punk. The closing track for the album Starboy, this was easily the highlight of the album (as a lot of people agreed with in this all men rate.  Personally it’s one of my favourite tracks from him in his entire discog (well top 10 for sure). It truly feels like it will be timeless, and it still sounds fresh 4 years after it came out. To conclude my write up, please stan the Weeknd, he’s doing it like no other pop boys in the past 5 years. - /u/ignitethephoenix 

 > I guess I wasn't suprised I Feel It Coming won. The weeknd is the most well liked of the three artists and I Feel It Coming is the most pop sounding song on the album. Yetti guessed on day one that this would win and while I thought a couple other songs had a chance at the end it definitely made sense. - /u/fishingfor8

---

As part of The Weeknd's steady transition into a poppier sound, *Starboy* was a surprisingly eclectic album, with this disco-inspired Daft Punk-assisted track coming out as its second single. (Cirkut, the producer/boyfriend of Ava Max, was also part of its production. When are we getting "In Your Eyes (Maxcut Remix)"?) It became a hit, peaking at #4 on the Hot 100, and still remains memorable despite bigger hits preceding and following it. It's an irresistible slow jam, with his naturally seductive vocals soothing you about his incoming love/orgasm/death/whatever. This isn't a song that turns you on (but I wouldn't judge you if it did); it's a song that helps you wind down in the nighttime.

Anyone with ears can tell that this is primarily a disco pop song, yet it apparently won some BMI R&B/Hip Hop award. If anything, this is just evidence that the bullshit over what counts as pop and what isn't pop is so arbitrary and, more often than not, rather racist. This is an excellent pop song from an excellent pop star, and it's a shame that he's still fighting these demarcations so late into his career.

**bbfan132** (10): it’s weird how this seemed like a towering giant of a song in its original rate but it probably won’t do that well in this one

**bespectacIed** (10): A rate that surprised me by how much I enjoyed it, considering it's an all-men rate. Predictable but rightful winner

**camerinian** (10): comfy

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this deserved the success blinding BLIGHTS has

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The Weeknd, our main pop boy!

**engifear** (10): Throwback to the time I saw this live at a festival high on [redacted] and danced my sad little ass off with the person I had a crush on (also high) and we kissed at the end of the song.

**fishingfor8** (10): obviously have to give the song from the rate I hosted a 10 (even if it probably doesn't deserve it)

**frogaranaman** (10): one of his best songs

**hikkaru** (10): very nearly my 11 choice

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This combination is perfection and definitely the superior Daft Punk/ Weeknd collab (sorry Starboy)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): what a clean song.

**InternetDude19** (10): He really does sound like MJ sometimes.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): I hate that this is going to go earlier than it should just bc its a m*n… this is sublime

**jasannn** (10): Die For You was robbed.

**ManofOranges** (10): Just another great song. Although I gave my 11 to Attention in this song's rate, I was honestly more than elated with this song winning.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): smash

**Roxieloxie** (10): I didnt submit in time for this mens rate but I was there for the reveal where I fell in love with this song. Able's music has never really been my thing but I cant lie, I've been obsessed with this song since I first heard it in plug

**runaway3212** (10): Daft Punk really helps this song, but even without them it's great

**selegend** (10): pop perfection

**skargardin** (10): classic

**twat\_brained** (10): since Get Lucky lost this is our next best hope for DP. Also, I wouldn't mind one or two more 80s hits from the Weeknd either

**1998tweety** (9): cute bop

**bigbigbee** (9): It was great when we rated it back in July, it’s great now. I’ll repeat what I said then – it sounds like hope.

**CarlieScion** (9): feel it Cummin

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Take that men who say women don’t orgasm. I had never paid much attention to this song before but after two listens I found myself singing along to this, it’s just so slick and sexy. He crushed this.

**mysario** (9): this is Michael Jackson-lite

**pat-rickstar** (9): The first rate I did on popheads!

**raicicle** (9): tbh the closest the weeknd has come to matching michael jackson’s energy and charisma in his whole career

**ReallyCreative** (9): so much to love about this one

**sarcasticsobs** (9): the power of these vocals + bringin in daft punk

**worlds-okayest666** (9): its a bop but how did it win over starboy??

**seanderlust** (8.7): i will never be sick of daft punk production

**kirby31200** (8.5): I think this song is a total groove but not really my favorite off of Starboy

**Stryxen** (8.5): 4 and a half minutes and nothing but a vibe

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): This is such a good chill yet groovy summer song

**CrimsonROSET** (8.3): The fact this is the only song by Daft Punk in this rate is sad.

**aresthormars** (8): Very groovy and catchy! There is something between Daft Punk's fingers honestly.

**fadedblue09** (8): Two things I'm happy about this winning: (1) We proved this is better than Starboy and (2) Craplie Puth didn't win.

**Frelock\_** (8): I like it. It's simple but fairly enjoyable.

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): this song goes slap the fuck off

**steelstepladder** (8): Starboy outsold

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): how did I just now realize this song is about edging

**vayyiqra** (8): Starboy is way better and should have won but this is still a bop

**wavingwolves** (8): i don't think i'll ever get tired of this song

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): I know this is good but I just can't get into it. I think I just don't like Abel's voice

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): would be higher if the chorus was something other than the same 4 words repeated over and over

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): It's cute.

**waluigiest** (7): 👁 🤲💦👶

# Couldn't Finish

**nooodisaster** (6.5): we get it, you feel it coming babe

**anothertown** (5): Very waiting-room-core

**moonagenightmares** (5): the first time i heard the weeknd on the radio i thought it was some justin bieber knockoff. His whiny pubescent voice still annoys the hell outta me </3

**PuggleMaster** (5): This song is a bop but it brings me back to when I went to the doctors because my chest was tight from a anxiety attack, and this was on the radio the entire time.

**bulforster** (4.4): (#31) Daft Punk deserved better representation than this.

**intheaftermath** (3): I'm sorry, The Weeknd is very hit or miss for me and this just isn't my taste

**KimberParoo** (1): This song makes death seem too sweet an end

**welcometoNY** (0): the Weeknd's particular schtick of off-brand Michael Jackson is more present than ever in this song, which makes it both impressive and frustrating that it's still so terrible. the weeknd is so incredibly grating in everything he does, so while there are a few moments that could have been nice in the hands of a better artist, his voice just makes this whole thing nauseating to listen to.

What do we have here? Why, it's Paramore's best song! One thing I love about Paramore tracks is the little sonic details that they build into their songs. In "Still Into You," those would be that tumbling noise preceding the second verse, and the introduction of those little hand claps after that cry of "your mother!". Not to mention the pure happiness on display here; songs about falling in love are everywhere, but songs about staying in love are much less so, probably because it's just harder to keep the flame alive than it is to start that initial spark. Knowing that Hayley and the man this is about are no longer together adds a bittersweet element to the song, but it remains a precious time capsule of a moment in a relationship when you still feel like you're in your honeymoon phase regardless of how much time has passed.

---
**bigbigbee** (11): I look like a big dumb idiot when I listen to this song because I can’t just HEAR it, I have to EMOTE it, you know? I’ve strutted down so many streets, pretending like I’m Hayley Williams, singing to my imaginary person. This song may not be the best on this list, but it’s the one that’s brought me the most joy, and for that, it gets my 11.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (11): my brain short-circuited trying to decide on which paramore song to give my 11

letsallpoo: # Still Into It

**addupten** (10): fucking bop, self-titled is a masterpiece

**aresthormars** (10): One of my faves from the self-titled album!

**bbfan132** (10): god-tier bridge and chorus

**bespectacIed** (10): She's a queen but there are so much better songs on S/T

**CarlieScion** (10): aint it fun lowkey outsold. but last hope deserved

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I would have gotten Ain't It Fun an 11, but Still Into You is a worthy winner in their rate.

**fadedblue09** (10): A major 11 contender.

**frogaranaman** (10): this hook lives rent free in my head

**fxsparrow** (10): Timeless

**hikkaru** (10): it's a 10 yes but ain't it fun outsold

**ImADudeDuh** (10): what a fucking bop

**kappyko** (10): BITCH YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

**ManofOranges** (10): First time hearing this song and this is also a hit

**nooodisaster** (10): A stunning ode to long-term love. The thesis is basically "Fuck it, it works" but Paramore makes it sound revolutionary, life-affirming, and most importantly, forever. A worthy winner.

**runaway3212** (10): An unparalleled track

**skargardin** (10): they snapped

**Stryxen** (10): Hayley can do anything and I will just 🥰🥰🥰🥰

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): fun fact that many paramore fans may not know about: this is actually the First song to ever be recorded! thank you Hayley

**TiltControls** (10): One of 2 songs to get a higher score for me on rerate. I don't know why this took so long to grow on me after the original rate. It's the best song on the album

**twat\_brained** (10): Who can really hate this song? Moreover, who can't relate to this at least a *little*?

**welcometoNY** (10): an absolute gem of a song, i've returned to it over and over for years and it just never gets old.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): that was a classic, that was a classic

**1998tweety** (9.5): massive bop, I know I'm basic for saying it but this is one of their bests

**CrimsonROSET** (9.5): Is it overrated as fuck? Yes. Doesn't mean it isn't fucking great.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): cute!

**mysario** (9.5): I'm still into poo 🥺

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.2): this song is so cute

**camerinian** (9): yeah you know what traditional values of love are fucking rad and I will flex my successful long term relationship thank you very much

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): I remember seeing the video of her in the studio nailing the vocals for this and I stan

**lIIustration** (9): ariana did into you better but this is still good

**waluigiest** (9): I don’t care if it’s cheesy I love the writing

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.9): im still into this song!

**PuggleMaster** (8.5): This was a cute era for Paramore but I liked Ain't It Fun more.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): it's a very mid song from self-titled but that still means its great

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Again, I don't like Hayley's voice. If this had been Kelly Clarkson or Mitski or P!nk or anyone else this would've been a 10

**starlitsuns** (8.5): Remember 2014 when this was all over the radio? I miss those days.

**akanewasright** (7.5): This song sounds like 8th grade, but like... in an okay way

**yatcho** (7.5): Cute bop but not even one of their best

**Frelock\_** (7): It's nice and upbeat.

**steelstepladder** (7): It's fun! But that's kinda it.

# Not Into It  

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I think I am still a bit scared of the rock aspects of this song that keep me and I’m not usually a huge fan of acoustic covers of songs but the acoustic version of this song that Ashley Tisdale did with her husband really elevated the song for me and helped me understand the lyrics/bones of the song a bit more so I would say that I like it a bit.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): call me bitter but this isn’t one of the Paramore songs that deserves to be here

**anothertown** (6): Proof deserved

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I like their poppier stuff way more.

**seanderlust** (5.7): this one never did it for me, although I do weirdly like it more now that after laughter came out.

**vayyiqra** (5): Not too into this :pensive:

**wavingwolves** (5): i love paramore but this is one of the weaker songs on self titled and ain't it fun deserved to be here

**bulforster** (1): (#48) God this is so grating, glad to know the guy it's about is awful. I quite like Paramore's self-titled but y'all really gave the win to my least fav track when Ain't It Fun was right there?

> "Your Best American Girl" is such an enigmatic song. It has such a personal theme of the difference between someone from an immigrant family, and someone who isn’t. The line “Your mother wouldn’t approve of the way my mother raised me, but I do, I finally do” especially sticks out to me. Of course, I‘be never had to experience the same thing, but it really offers an interesting perspective of someone who has, and in a way non-immigrant people can understand. Plus, the production is great, especially the soaring guitar in the middle of the track. It definitely deserved to win its rate, for sure. - /u/survivorjdmarina 

 > I had the joy of helping host the Women Who Rock rate and let me just say: Mitski absolutely destroyed the competition. The winner was not even close after the first day of scores, it was essentially a race for second place. Your Best American Girl was a unanimous favourite and for good cause. It's a powerhouse of a song and the lyricism is so refreshing in the landscape of indie rock. Mitski uses her own personal experiences to create a passionate track, marked with some killer guitar lines and vocals. It's cathartic, sure, but it's 100% what the song called for. I'm hoping she can pull off similar results here, she really deserves it with this amazing track. - /u/TiltControls

---

In the Top 100 tracks of 2016 according to /r/popheads, our annual countdown of the user-voted best tracks of the year hosted by /u/raicicle (vote for the 2020 version now!), [a Mitski song got as far as the Honorable Mentions](https://medium.com/@itsrai/the-top-100-tracks-of-2016-according-to-r-popheads-intro-honorable-mentions-ba6c18ec96ed#.7twnaghkz), but not onto the actual list. I had voted for two Mitski songs: "Happy," which was the first Mitski song I listened to and the first I fell in love with, and "Your Best American Girl," a song that I had also voted for but at the time wasn't fully in love with. Of course the latter made it on, and I was happy enough that she at least had some representation somewhere, but I didn't think much about it at the time. I had enjoyed Mitski despite not really caring for indie rock — I believe I'm the first person to ever post her on the sub, when I posted the [\[FRESH VIDEO\] of "A Burning Hill"](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5719b5/fresh_video_mitski_a_burning_hill/) and received a whopping dozen or so upvotes — but it wasn't as though I really thought she would have much of an endearing impact on the sub.

Then *Be the Cowboy* came out (and "Nobody" which I still don't really get), and I bore witness to how Mitski was actually surprisingly loved by a lot of people on /r/popheads. When we eventually rated *Puberty 2*, I ended up listening to "Your Best American Girl" a lot more and, in turn, understanding it much deeper than I did in 2016. I think many critics also went through this rediscovery phase; it was more extolled in decade-end overviews than in those year-end ones. I've never been one to care about whether songs resonated with me personally, but "Your Best American Girl" was an exception. This is, at its core, a love song, one about a boy with whom she wishes she could have an equitable relationship. It's doomed, of course, not because of just differences, but because of this sense of inferiority — the line says that his mother won't approve, not that she won't understand. And therein lies the issue that I truly believe only people of color (and especially children of immigrants) will understand in the western world, that even in spite of whatever progress has been made, there will always be this sense of not being quite on the same level as the white boys that you find yourself chasing after. I love the video as well, as low budget as it is, which shows Mitski tonguefucking her own arm, literally learning to love her own skin. It's a painful, raw love song, and the fact that she transmits all of these complex emotions in an indie rock song — a genre defined by and overly populated with white boys — only adds to the message behind it. I adore this song so much, and I'm glad that it's made it this far.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): As an Asian person I love that Mitski wrote this but I was raised by my white father so I can’t say that I especially relate. Still, this song was a seismic shift in the music world and I hope Mitski’s star just burns brighter and brighter.

**moonagenightmares** (8.4): the grungiest parts of the song are the best parts

**starlitsuns** (8): I love the rock production on this!

**suhonyu** (8): one of the few mitski songs I like

**CrimsonROSET** (7.3): The build-up in this song is spectacular.

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): again with the people who make netflix movie music. that should be a genre. songs we'd hear while a shot of a girl in overalls plays out, and her hair is messy but not too messy and she has freckles

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Did You Know: analysts predicted that when Mitski’s critically acclaimed “Puberty 2” was released, sales of Dr. Martens womens’ shoes increased by a whopping 850% in a single quarter!

# /r/stupidheads

**patcheso8** (6): better than anything on Be The Cowboy

**PuggleMaster** (6): I'd rather be listening to NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOOOOOOOOOO

**fishingfor8** (5): I still like Lana more for some reason

**AtomicViolet** (4): I'm sorry I've just never been able to get into Mitski

**Frelock\_** (4): Just not all that interesting.

**vayyiqra** (4): A hot take but I don't get the love for this song. I'm just not into indie rock.

**nooodisaster** (3): I've kept trying to get into this song... and just can't. I've studied the lyrics, watched the music video, listened again and again... It's not for me. Sorry y'all!

# sis you're an asian gay and you gave this a 1? go look up this song on azlyrics and think about what you've done

**joshually** (1): I literally have no idea what this is saying

> It's no surprise that Mariah Carey won the holiday rate with this quintessential classic. Becoming the first song to break the 0-10 scale in rates, it amassed a 10.038 average its first time being rated. One of the best selling songs of all time, it has broken numerous records such as longest trip to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and best selling Christmas single by a female artist. The festive song has spawned 3 music videos, a childrens book, an animated TV special, three Guinness World Records, and many [iconic performances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKIY9tCaqU0). The song has become so much bigger than itself or Mariah Carey, it's gone on to represent the Christmas season, and will be heard for years to come. - /u/NapsAndNetflix

---

If we started this rate maybe a month afterwards, this probably would've made it to the top 10, and maybe even could've won. And honestly, I would've been more than happy to see this win. It's not only a stone cold classic — like, quite literally the song here that's going to be played the furthest into the future — but it's also an incredible song, full of camp and drama and sheer *joy* that everyone who hasn't worked in retail before can enjoy. The fact that it gets spammed to death every December, and the fact that so many people seem to feel so strongly about Christmas music, doomed it to this placement, but no matter what you think of this song, you already know that it's going to be everywhere shortly. Thanksgiving is over babes; it's Mariah season now.

**joshually** (11): I’m sorry but… flair! Also: AIWFCIY ACTIVATE BOT!

**mysario** (11): Christmas began with this song

**succulentils** (11): Gonna need something extra festive this year, Mariah

**twat\_brained** (11): It seems like such a strange yet sensible choice for this to win the rate; it's almost universally loved. Well, that is unless you're a retail worker this time of year

letsallpoo: # Have Not Worked in Target During December

**1998tweety** (10): queen of xmas we stan

**akanewasright** (10): This is like... basically a perfect song. I’ll be a little weirded out if this wins, but it’s a masterpiece. I can’t give it a lower score.

**anothertown** (10): It makes me CRY that Mariah wrote this as pure escapism to try to heal her hellish childhood and it ended up doing as stupendously well as it did

**aresthormars** (10): This is the national anthem of North Pole and the main theme for Christmas.

**bbfan132** (10): tbt when we used to play the 2014 live version in the plug every day

**bespectacIed** (10): i immediately skipped when it played lol. Not for another 2 months please

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is actually on my running playlist year-round

**CrimsonROSET** (10): We're just close enough to December where this is fine, but you're on thin ice.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This better be #1 again this year if 2020 is going to have its redemption arc!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I unironically love everything about this and we don't even celebrate Christmas in Russia.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the greatest Christmas song of all time

**InfernalSolstice** (10): serotonin in its purest form

**J\_Toe** (10): It's honestly weird listening to this outside of Christmas, but a 10's a 10.

**jsonphile** (10): Quite easily one of the best Christmas songs ever made, and nothing since has gotten close to topping it. Although I do sympathize with retail workers who have to hear this song and like five other holiday songs on repeat for two and a half months

**kirby31200** (10): A cultural staple

**lIIustration** (10): I’m Jewish and love this song

**ManofOranges** (10): I'm sorry but this really is probably one of the most iconic Christmas songs and for good reason. It absolutely puts you in the Christmas spirit faster than you can say "I don't want a lot for Christmas." It's pure holiday joy, and while I do get why people can get sick of it, it hasn't gotten on my nerves yet, and I hope it never will.

**nootnoot781** (10): i have many arguments against capitalism however one of my arguments for it is hearing this song everywhere from november to christmas. karl marx 0 - mariah 1 ?

**pat-rickstar** (10): Almost time to start listening to this again (and no, Christmas music is not acceptable in November. Wait until December pls)

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): bitch. BITCH. nothing says christmas like this song. also i listen to it at least once a week. but this song. even after working in retail during a single holiday season didn't ruin it for me, okay. this song goes slap the fuck off. it's all the best parts of christmas in one song. it's mulled wine and ugly sweaters and gifts and lights and driving around the neighborhood to see the houses and UGH why can't it be christmas already

**PuggleMaster** (10): This is a classic, but I had to skip this shit. Girl it is too early to be listening to Christmas music.

**runaway3212** (10): this is the only valid Christmas song

**sandyfishnets** (10): what about the My Chemical Romance cover tho?

**selegend** (10): i hate this song because it’s annoying but it’s a good pop song

**skargardin** (10): haters begone, this is a serotonin rush regardless of the season

**SmileAndTears** (10): Mariah Carey IS Christmas. Outsold that flop jesus

**starlitsuns** (10): Christmas queen.

**steelstepladder** (10): No other Christmas songs need to exist

**suhonyu** (10): do I really need to explain when like so much of the world adores this pop christmas song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): second best christmas song of all time only behind the toad version of this song

**TragicKingdom1** (10): please let this win im begging

**welcometoNY** (10): there will never be another song like this, and there doesn't need to be. it accomplishes everything it wants to, and it does it perfectly.

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): As soon as I hear the little bells in the beginning I feel the spirit of Christmas taking over me, it's the most iconic Christmas song for a reason!

**zadooi** (10): Pure excellence. Nothing less. Invented Christmas.

**shhhneak** (9.8): This song hasn’t aged even a moment.

**cocosairdep** (9.5): I want it to be Christmas so badly.

**TiltControls** (9.5): one of the few christmas classics that I can listen to outside of the holiday season

**bulforster** (9.2): (#7) Modern. Fucking. Classic. Best Mariah in the rate.

**intheaftermath** (9): I hate Christmas music, so this is monumental for me

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): iconic but only once a year

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): invented straight halloween

**racloves** (9): I hate Xmas but this song is a classic

**sarcasticsobs** (9): one of the 4 christmas songs i enjoy, it cannot be denied

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): t minus 21 days until this owns my entire life

**waluigiest** (9): me performing the alto 2 part to the choral arrangement: iiiiiiiiiiiiiii…. And iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

**WeastofEden44** (9): A true classic, it should be the national anthem at this point

**Stryxen** (8.8): I haven’t heard this song this year yet waiting for the plug reveal lol

**camerinian** (8.5): Show us the voting data for this one, let's see that average collapse from November 1st onwards thanks to the bitter retail workers

**hikkaru** (8.5): when a christmas song wins the october rate yas

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): this is a timeless bop idc

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): The DEFINITIVE Christmas song. Unfortunately, I'm writing this in October.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): I’m so glad this rate isn’t a month later bc I’d be obligated to give it my 11 in december, but I’m filling this form out in mid-November so not today

**AtomicViolet** (8): As someone who hates christmas songs this is a bop

**frogaranaman** (8): overplayed but a certified slapper

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): i dislike christmas songs but this one can stay

**InternetDude19** (8): The first time I hear it every year is always the best time, it gets considerably worse every time after that.

**kappyko** (8): i swear

**nooodisaster** (8): I'm not in the Xmas spirit yet where my score would inflate, but this is still a damn good pop song.

**Frelock\_** (7): Catchy for a reason, but very overplayed.

**ReallyCreative** (7): if the rate was done like 3 weeks later I might give it a 10 but I'm just not in the mood

# Unfestive Folks

**CarlieScion** (6): i cant bring myself to score this higher in october

**fadedblue09** (6): It’s fine...but she literally has 2 other songs here that are infinitely better.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): im just so OVER THIS since i worked in retail for 2 years and both of them included the christmas season

**seanderlust** (5): this is a good christmas song, but I am rating it so low because I have a distinct memory of working in a department store's shoes section on black friday. it was the opening shift at midnight and I had just pounded a monster energy and I thought I was ready. this song echoed through the halls, and people came in and literally started SPRINTING DOWN THE HALLS to get like....ten dollars off a pair of knockoff ugg boots? like can you all calm down? and people were so rude like girl, get some triptophan in you from the turkey and go the fuck to sleep. it's fun tho.

**hunnybee12** (4): i'm tired

**ktajlili** (3): I. Hate. Christmas. Music.

**moonagenightmares** (2): so overplayed its unbearable

**Roxieloxie** (2): i mean this is nice but is it the version with big time rush and mirranda cosgrove on it?

**CreepyMannequin** (1): Christmas songs shouldn’t count as music. Sorry Queen Mariah.

**aestheticen** (0): Society has progressed past the need for Christmas songs

**cremeebrulee** (0): sorry christmas music is irritating to me regardless of who it's by :)

**KimberParoo** (0): I've worked retail sorry

**static\_int\_husp** (0): i did not do the xmas rate. i tend to loathe most xmas music. Especially this song. This song has been played non stop 2 months a year since before i was born. if i could choose to never hear a single song ever again, it would almost definitely be this one. And now you have the audacity to make me listen to this in October?? i will not stand for it.

**vayyiqra** (0): Very hot take but I do not like this song, never have, don't get the appeal, not into it, oh well

> Did the Redemption Rate have disastrous results? Yes. Would I have preferred nearly any other song winning the rate? Yes. Was the rate itself only conceived to keep Bad Romance out of this rate? Yes. Do I regret it? No. I think more rates should strive to capture the unexpectedly chaotic energy of the tonal shift from "omg all the songs in this rate are so good :heart_eyes:" to "WHAT THE FUCK?? :rage:" two songs in. Ending with a track that was beaten by 3 songs from its album in its first rate winning with a low 8.5 average is just the cherry on top. To quote my good friend /u/ImADudeDuh, MWAH! - /u/TragicKingdom1

---

I thought we were safe. As we approached 100 winners, and this rate was on the horizon, I was safe with the knowledge that Lorde and her guttural singing would not be present in this rate, aside from her wispy backing vocals in that Bleachers song I already forgot the name of. We had literally rated every single Lorde song in existence. *The Love Club EP*? Rated. Her *Mockingjay* bullshit? Rated. "Magnets"? Rated — [twice](https://media1.tenor.com/images/86946840fa4c568abd589a71477c6859/tenor.gif?itemid=12137501)! And all she had a nice little win for "Ribs," a nice, little, deserving song from a solid album that made it a little too far in the first winners rate, but at least it was a good song. I was happy. I was content. I was...safe.

But no. /u/TragicKingdom1 had other ideas, and in a last-minute attempt to ~~make sure we didn't have to include "Bad Romance"~~ make sure we had 50 even songs, he threw together a calamitous monstrosity known as The Redemption Rate, where songs that weren't good enough to win their original rates, nor good enough to get onto, let alone win, All Stars, would compete. There were excellent, career-defining songs on there, from incredibly popular, innovative, talented artists, as well as "Getaway Car" and songs from Years & Years and Bleachers, but /r/popheads showed its true, disgusting colors when the final two came about. In second place was "Your Type," a...*fine* single from a great album by a great artist, and in first was this shit. He's gone on to try to retcon that rate as a ["social experiment"](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/g4dfrzo/) — I guess what we learned that day is that some experiments fail.

I know this is a Wendy's ma'am or whatever, but let me go off a bit. The problem wasn't just that a Lorde album track that came in at like 7th in its original rate beat out so many iconic, genre-defining and genre-defying classics that spanned decades and multiple genres. The problem was that I don't even think the song is good. I don't like the titular metaphor, which is beaten to death despite not being properly explored in the lyrics, and the production is Jack Antonoff at his most repetitive, with synthwork and beats that we've heard many times from him since then. I can't deny the charm of the line "In my head we do everything right," but the way she repeats it just makes me realize that there's nothing else to latch onto in this song. I get the appeal, but it's just not for me. I'll happily stream many other *Melodrama* songs, or stream something else because I'd like to think that I'm a generally well-adjusted individual, but I will never buy into the love that this song gets. Whatever. At least it didn't make it any higher.

---
**slimboyfriend** (11): the centerpiece of Melodrama and the sequel to Ribs. Also the only song in this rate that can make me cry no matter how happy I am before listening to it

**starlitsuns** (11): This is probably going to go out day 1 since everyone is still upset over this winning the Redemption Rate but goodness I have so many words to say about this song. Obviously Green Light helped me out of a depression that lasted over a year in high school, but this song was the big hug I needed. Lorde realizing that she could manipulate the memories of her relationship so that she could finally move on without her ex is (in my opinion) the superpower she speaks of in Writer in the Dark, even if only Lorde believes she wasn’t in the wrong. It’s powerful, it’s what we all need to do sometimes. On top of that, Jack Antonoff’s production is godly here. Interpolating Green Light is only the tip of the iceberg, and the outro is the final tears of joy when you realize you’re out of the rut you were in. The scream at the end of the bridge has cleared my skin, given me good grades in school, and healed me in so many ways. I’m going to get off my soapbox now so that you all can read other comments, and so that I stop acting like a clown since I’m a Lorde - Supercut stan on r slash Popheads.

=====

letsallpoo: **aresthormars** (10): When I first heard it in Melodrama it was one of the songs that I will forever cherish because it hit me so much. Also when it is just her vocals and piano, that is so beautiful!

**AtomicViolet** (10): This would be my 11 if not for Juice

**bbfan132** (10): lorde can do no wrong

**CarlieScion** (10): OH ITS JUST ................

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Oh fuck, why wouldn't I give this song a 10? I swear, Melodrama hits hard when you actually go to college.

**fishingfor8** (10): Melodrama deserved every bit of praise it got and probably some more

**frogaranaman** (10): me every day imagining a life together with the man that has matched with me eight different times on Tinder in the past two years: but it’s just a supercut of us

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): It’s been memed to death at this point but *Melodrama* is a genuinely great album and this is by far my favorite song. It’s such a brilliant climax to the arc of the album, we’ve seen her replay this broken relationship all night and now comes the moment of clarity when she finally confronts what she’s been doing and as the memories scroll past she finally overcomes/accepts everything for what it was and this frees her to move forwards into “Perfect Places.” I have fond memories of riding my bike around the city at night after my first breakup and blasting this song. Actually… are those fond? It’s a bop regardless.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): I did give supercut my eleven that one time but not today, sorry Lorde

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Lorde haters have no rights

**InternetDude19** (10): Our savior!

**Ionlywanttheworld** (10): If Running up that hill wasn't on this list this would be an eleven

**J\_Toe** (10): I still love it, but there are a collection of Jack Antonoff songs (Strawberries and Cigarettes) that use the same synth instrumentation

**jackisboredtoday** (10): wild how this is an obvious ten with no thought needed to decide that and it isn’t even top 3 on this album

**lIIustration** (10): how was this not a hit

**ManofOranges** (10): Still kinda can't believe this won the redemption rate, not like it didn't deserve it though.

**Mudkip1** (10): period

**nooodisaster** (10): This is the third time I've rated this and I'll keep giving it a 10. Lyrical masterpiece, production perfection, we cry everytime. Though now that this song has won I CAN say I think the outro is too long for normal listens and I kinda lose focus in the last 30 seconds.

**pat-rickstar** (10): No I didn’t want this to win the redemption rate. Yes I still gave it a 10 and I'll do it again. Ok?

**seanderlust** (10): me when this inevitably gets top 5: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/43/fb/05/43fb055b1be6dcbb32d36e31781ab273.jpg

**shhhneak** (10): I’ll never forgive her for making Homemade Dynamite a single over this masterpiece.

**steelstepladder** (10): People are gonna come after this because it won the redemption rate but it's still great shoot me.

**Stryxen** (10): giving this an 11 is my 2nd biggest regret in life. I will not make the same mistake

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): people in this sub wake up and play melodrama like did you even try to be happy this morning?

**TiltControls** (10): I know the Redemption rate was a mess, but I still love this song. She sounds pained in the lyrics, but still manages an upbeat performance

**twat\_brained** (10): love love LOVE this but Gimme More should be here instead

**waluigiest** (10): I adore this song. I accidentally missed the redemption rate, but this was going to be my 11. Which feels contentious to say hahahaha

**welcometoNY** (10): definitely a highlight on Melodrama, although not nearly the best song on the album or in her discography

**worlds-okayest666** (10): ok yeah this didnt deserve to win its rate but its a fucking smash so...im not gonna complain much

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): Supercut may be like one of the most overrated songs on Melodrama, but it's still a song on Melodrama so it deserves it's score

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): this song always makes me want to get in my car and speed into a wall and i mean that as a compliment

**WeastofEden44** (9.5): The government does in fact have chips in our heads otherwise Lorde never would have been able to make this song specifically for me and my deep-rooted issues

**camerinian** (9): the sub tearing itself apart that this, a very good song from a classic album, won the Redemption Rate has to be the goofiest moment of the year (rest of the world notwithstanding)

**hikkaru** (9): it feels ... wrong for this to be here. don't get me wrong it's a fantastic song but it's not one of the absolute best on melodrama imo, and the album should have either stayed winnerless due the iconicness of its loss in the 2017 altpop rate OR perfect places/green light should have won as2 ...

**jsonphile** (9): not that this is a hot take at all but Melodrama is just an amazing album

**mysario** (9): it's a Twitter fancam of us

**vayyiqra** (9): inyourcartheradioup- inyourcartheradioup-

**CrimsonROSET** (8.9): This one goes out to everyone who did the Redemption rate, y'all the real ones.

**runaway3212** (8.5): This is the worst track on melodrama

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): I'm tempted to give this a 0 just because it beat Your Type in the redemption rate

**bulforster** (8): (#13) The number of times Jack has made this same song and I fall for it every single time.

**cremeebrulee** (8): ok maybe this didnt deserve to win the redemption rate but its still a bop idc

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This win was a fluke, but the song is still good.

**Frelock\_** (8): Good lyrics, nice music, and Lorde's vocal well talents on display.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I like this song but it’s definitely a bit of a shrinker sometimes. The ending saves the song a lot

**joshually** (8): this was a great song ruined by inclusion in that terrible Netflix movie Someone Great

**kirby31200** (8): I like everything about this song except the chorus. I wish this song was a touch less sleepy. Not my favorite on the album

**ReallyCreative** (8): I'm deducting like a point and a half because it did not deserve to win, sorry about it, Perfect Places, Sober, and Homemade Dynamite are unbothered

**suhonyu** (8): i mean it's great but it rly didn't need to be supercut

**engifear** (7.8): Don't come for me, but every song on Pure Heroine is better than this song

**jasannn** (7.5): This anthemic song seemslike it would right up my lane but there's something off with it preventing me from loving it.

**WillamThunderfuck** (7.5): It's a good song, but compared to other songs on Melodrama it's just okay imo

**hunnybee12** (7): not in the mood anymore

**moonagenightmares** (7): out of all the lorde songs ….

**PuggleMaster** (7): This song was forever ruined when one of my friends said this was basically Lorde doing a Taylor Swift song.

**wavingwolves** (7): it was incredibly unsatisfying to have this win a rate so let's not do it again

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.3): not bad but...

**1998tweety** (6): Don't get me wrong I like the song but y'all overrated the entire album so much. Lorde (and I'll admit my fav Lana does this too) has the tendency to kill a good song with a 1-minute long outro. Please it is really not necessary.

**chillbumps5** (5): it's ok

**raicicle** (5): the central conceit of this song is silly

**bluehxrizon** (4): this is a good song but I dont trust lorde stans

**Roxieloxie** (4): Listen, I know we all want lorde to win a rate but we're not gonna sit here and pretend that this is even close to the best song on melodrama

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): nope. this song is all the worst parts of whatever jess glynne was doing that year. this is american ninja warrior victory montage music

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): melodrama puts me to sleep

**anothertown** (1): The way this sounds exactly like every other song on Melodrama

**fadedblue09** (1): As much as I love(d) Melodrama, I will forever be baffled to see this win, because I never considered it an album highlight. Seriously, this is just a longer and more meandering Green Light. I hope the diehard Ella stans save this because I certainly won't!

**skargardin** (1): perhaps the worst winner in rate history.

**selegend** (0): considering i gave this a 0 in its original rate, it deserves my 0 here

> When I signed up to host the Pitchfork Rate earlier this year, I instantly knew that Cellophane would either place high or win, and it was in the lead the entire time. However, I’m not even sure if it’ll make it to day 2 or 3 in this rate, which is a testament to how strong this rate is. It’s not at the level of an 11 for me personally, but I still think that Cellophane is a perfect track that delivers a crushing take on the brutal scrutiny of her prior relationship. The video that accompanies the song is just as wonderful and was rightfully acclaimed last year by many. Regardless of the song’s placement in this rate, it has proven itself to be a remarkably beautiful song that will stand the test of time and remain a fan favorite for years to come. - /u/bbfan132

---

"Cellophane" is like an intricate ornament sitting high on the edge of a shelf, eventually tumbling down and shattering on the floor. It's beautiful, delicate, and doomed for destruction. Every single syllable, every plunk of the piano, every gasp and breath and whisper is perfectly placed and manicured, which makes it all the more visceral when it does start tumbling down.

Apparently written about (sigh) Robert Pattinson and their falling out, "Cellophane" discusses the pure, simple heartache that comes when your relationship ends, then adds the pain of this breakup becoming a public affair, like some tchotchke wrapped up in cellophane. It's a doubly painful song that feels viciously raw despite being carefully manicured — a testament to the detailed care undertaken by FKA twigs. It's wild to think that she sat on this song for so long just so she could learn how to pole dance for its video, but the wait was worth it; the music video adds to the experience, as we see her literally ascend before crashing down. It's the sound and visual of an expert artist perfecting their craft, and bearing witness to both feels like an exquisite pleasure — until you realize that enjoying the song only feeds into the public spectacle of her breakup.

**1998tweety** (11): Good LORDE this song is incredible, there really isn't anyone else doing it like her??? Like wow first of all the vocals are amazing, the LYRICS are sooo amazing and actually get so much better when you know the context behind them. The production is immaculate. What's not to like???

**aresthormars** (11): This deserves the 11. She served vocals, sincerity, and performance. Who pole dances on piano track except FKA twigs herself.

**bluehxrizon** (11): AND DIDNT I DO IT FOR YOU

**plastichaxan** (11): after debating myself for hours between this, kate bush and robyn i made the hardest choice i've ever had to do on a rate so far

**bbfan132** (10): this was from the rate i hosted and i know it’ll be robbed but it gets better for me whenever i listen to it

**bespectacIed** (10): powerful song by the greatest artistic mind the music industry has ever seen

**camerinian** (10): twigs is just, like, a perfect artist in every sense. Everything she does is breathtaking

**CarlieScion** (10): why ,,,,, dont i ,,,,,,,, do it ,,,, for u ,,,,!!!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the shitpost better be that one video of the simpsons hit & run set to this

**CrimsonROSET** (10): This is proooobably my winner pick? Like, this has the biggest (I like the song)/(popheads likes the song), so I believe?

**CritneySpearz** (10): ok I used to like this song, but I literally just suffered heartbreak for the first time in my 26 years of life and now I have a completely different appreciation for the song… It hits sooo much differently ouch

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Wrist-cutting soundtrack.

**fadedblue09** (10): In hindsight this should've been an obvious 11. Even though I gave it a 10 before, somehow it's still growing on me. Ugh her power!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I don’t even want this to win but giving it less than a ten just feels wrong, this is just a masterpiece on every level

**hunnybee12** (10): stunning, one of a kind, masterpiece

**Ionlywanttheworld** (10): beautiful and haunting

**kappyko** (10): i theoretically hate this but its actually a moment

**lIIustration** (10): she’s such a musical genius

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): just stunning. and magdalene 2019 aoty btw

**PuggleMaster** (10): I really wished I liked Magdalene as much as I loved this song.

**raicicle** (10): i think this deserves a long-lasting legacy as a pinpoint of fak twugs’ career

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The perfect ballad. Will definitely be robbed

**skargardin** (10): she snapped

**steelstepladder** (10): DIDNT I DO IT FOR YA

**Stryxen** (10): my first 11 win 🥰 and I would do it again bap bap except so hot is in this rate oop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I just wanna meet the guy who made background noises with his mouth for this instrumental

**twat\_brained** (10): Stop breaking Tahliah's heart or I'll fight you

**urlocalcracchead** (10): Seriously considering the eleven on this one

**waluigiest** (10): Her head voice here is so beautiful. Along with everything else - the writing, the orchestration, the shape. It’s a beautiful piece of music.

**wavingwolves** (10): fuck robert pattinson i guess

**WeastofEden44** (10): This was such a power move oh my god

**zadooi** (10): Didn't I do it for you... Such simple words that cause so much pain in my heart.

**welcometoNY** (9.9): maybe i cried

**bulforster** (9.8): (#4) Gut-wrenching.

**slimboyfriend** (9.8): the sadness I feel when she’s basically singing the same thing over and over again over two piano chords

**pat-rickstar** (9.7): It took a while for this to click with me, but it's starting to really hit

**akanewasright** (9.5): I’ve only heard this song a few times, and each time it hits me like a goddamn truck. Wonderful song, wonderfully produced and delivered.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this normally isn’t my type of song but I think this art

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): For most of the songs in this rate, I haven't been looking at the lyrics like I usually do for most rates because I know I am going to like most, if not all, songs in the rate. But for this one, I know I had to look up the lyrics of Genius because what FKA does is ART and it should be treated as such. This is my first time listening to Cellophane and I just want to say sorry to FKA for sleeping on this song. I am going to give your album a listen kween!

**jsonphile** (9): okay I had never heard anything by FKA twigs before but wow what a powerful and sad song, especially after reading what it was about.

**ReallyCreative** (9): FKA twigs was an artist I didn't fully "get" until MAGDALENE but its songs like this that put her entire discography into a clearer frame, at least for me

**selegend** (9): best song of 2019

**starlitsuns** (9): I haven’t listened to any FKA twigs prior to this rate, but having seen this win the 2019 Pitchfork Rate, I’m definitely interested in listening to more of her music. Those high notes are piercingly beautiful in the chorus.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): amazing song but i can only listen to it in very specific circumstances

**seanderlust** (8.5): oof. the vocal performance of this one >>>>

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): Hot take: this is only the fourth or fifth best song on MAGDALENE, because it’s brought down a bit by the ending. It still hits hard, though.

**yatcho** (8.5): Really not even the best song off that album imo

**anothertown** (8): The thought of Twigs feeling inferior is insane because early in my relationship with my gf I saw that she was listening to LP1 and I freaked out because I thought there was no way I was interesting enough for someone who even LISTENED TO fka twigs in 2014.

**fishingfor8** (8): fka twigs is definitely a grower artist, I like this song a lot more than the last time it was rated

**kirby31200** (8): I'm certain I'll like this more when I hear it in the context of the full album

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): i wish i liked this song more than i do. the video did a lot for me, but the song itself doesn't stand without the visuals as much which is disappointing. the heel scrapes should have been included in the final version! but the song is good and unnerving and captures heartbreak so well!

**runaway3212** (8): Would be a 7 but this video is amazing.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): The distorted piano sounds like shit but it also gives me shivers? It's incredibly sad and it just makes me feel so weird. I really don't know if I like this or not

**moonagenightmares** (7.2): kinda a snooze, the album had better songs imo

**ImADudeDuh** (7): honestly this grew on me this year. Also, i really hope someone links that video of carl weezer getting thrown into an airplane while this song plays

**Roxieloxie** (7): im balladphobic but i enjoyed the emotion

# Stream that Batman Movie or Something IDR What Robert Pattinson Is In

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): still don't get the hype

**AtomicViolet** (6): I feel like I should like this more than I do

**Frelock\_** (6): Technically impressive & a lot of emotion in there. Just not really my taste.

**mysario** (6): this song never did it for me and might be a bottom 5 song in this rate but it's still a great song which speaks volumes about all the other songs here

**vayyiqra** (6): Trying not to be balladophobic but I don't love this much as everyone else seems to even though I like twigs

**InfernalSolstice** (5.5): her voice is gorgeous but the song itself is kinda boring

**aestheticen** (5): Not my cup of tea sorry

**nooodisaster** (5): ummm im giving too many 9s and 10s so bye felicia. (it's emotional but w/o the mv i sleep & rank 8 songs higher on the album)

**fxsparrow** (2): I've trieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed so many times to like this song but I couldn't.

**joshually** (2): ew what is this song? It makes me feel like someone is tickling me while I’m tied up and I have to pee

**ManofOranges** (2): Sorry to this song, but I am bored. I don't know why but it just doesn't do it for me

**astrologicalangel** (1): I have tried SO hard to like this song, but I just do not enjoy it at all

> The winner of the Classic Greatest Hits Rate, this was a slightly unexpected winner, but very deserved. Going in, I knew ABBA would definitely win but I would have picked Mamma Mia or Dancing Queen as the winner instead. So this was a nice surprise and I definitely agree it’s one of their best songs. The riff is iconic and gave us another excellent song in Hung Up and one of Ava Max’s best songs, Torn. And the lyrics are a big mood that majority of the people in the sub can relate too! Anyway please stan or continue to stan ABBA guys, they truly do have some of the most memorable pop songs of all time. - /u/ignitethephoenix

> I had so much fun hosting this rate with u/ignitethephoenix. We laughed, we cried, we saw our faves get slaughtered until one song remained: Gimme x3. What can I say? The girls and the gays love it. It's an undeniable bop, but I was surprised that it won (I thought it was going to be Mamma Mia tbh) Thank you to everyone who made it such a success and thank you for stanning ABBA. They are truly incredible and more than deserving of the title of winner!! - /u/poppinmmolly

And the first ABBA song bites the dust. I thought "Dancing Queen" would've been decidedly more beloved than this one, but a surprising number of commenters said that they much preferred this ABBA track. It's definitely as campy and dramatic as their best hits, and I love a good ode to a midnight dicking, but it's a little tiring after a certain point, and the hook has been outdone by Madonna (and, if we're being completely honest here, Ava Max). Hell, I didn't even expect this to win its original rate, but as a 12 year old, I guess I can't really speak too much on these old legendary songs.

---
**ManofOranges** (11): An example of perfection in song form. Of all the songs here, I could see this one winning the rate honestly

**nootnoot781** (11): not only is this pop perfection, it also birthed hung up. legendary

**sandyfishnets** (11): this song is perfect - the harmonizations, the bassline, the cheesy violins, the synths, everything works so well together

**WillamThunderfuck** (11): Probably the best ABBA song in my opinion (which by definition also makes it one of the best songs ever in general)! It's so intense and high energy, which is right up my alley. Also the lyrics are very relatable lmao

letsallpoo: # Can't Get Enough

**akanewasright** (10): The fucking blueprint

**CarlieScion** (10): i would give this a 10.5 if i could but the world is too cruel

**frogaranaman** (10): this song is attached to my most successful Tiktok post so automatic 10

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m pretty sure that seeing the first Mama Mia movie in theaters was what made me gay. This song is so iconic I knew all of the words to it after hearing it like once, I remember when I was in middle school someone put this on while we were just sitting around in show choir and everyone lost their minds! There’s just so much drama here, you can relate to it whether you need a man or not. (And just to be clear, I need a man.)

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): this song FUCKS

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is ABBA’s best song. I feel so GAY when i dance to this.

**pat-rickstar** (10): One of the best ABBA songs, the sample from it also gave us Hung Up by Madonna so how could you not love this

**plastichaxan** (10): ABBA is the best that’s all

**ReallyCreative** (10): serving me dancing alone in my apartment every night for the last 8 months

**twat\_brained** (10): stream Gimme Gimme Rasputin

**WeastofEden44** (10): One of THEE best pop songs ever made methinks

**anothertown** (9.5): A shame that Bram Stoker never heard the theme song to the concept of vampires, just missed it by 67 years bruh

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Strings goooooood

**intheaftermath** (9.5): Unpopular opinion but I wish this song was shorter, simply because the Just Dance 2014 routine is so exhausting

**mysario** (9.5): but only until 2 am because nothing good happens after 2 am

**Stryxen** (9.5): WHY IS THIS SONG SO EXCITING it literally sounds so thrilling and dangerous

**aresthormars** (9): I love that it all starts so dark but then it just switch to a disco track. So good!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): the winner takes it all outsold

**kirby31200** (9): I grew up on the Broadway cast recording of Mamma Mia, so that's ingrained into me and whenever I revisit real Abba I'm a little surprised by how thick the accents are

**vayyiqra** (9): Can't say I have ever felt the same but it's a bop and that synth riff is so good

**waluigiest** (9): I love the dramatic ABBA songs the most and this is close to the top

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.6): the superior abba song in this rate! i have really fond memories of singing this song with friends so i have to raise the score by at least 0.4

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8.5): I need a man

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): It's good but I'm not hearing what y'all are hearing

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): the only abba song i actually like tbh

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**cremeebrulee** (8): deserves to outpeak dancing queen

**joshually** (8): so that riff is iconic… but… the vocals are actually not that great for ABBA?

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): because of that episode of community alone, but also because this song goes slap the fuck off. madonna who?

**suhonyu** (8): mamma mia snapped with this one

**shhhneak** (7.5): Okay this song had time!

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): a bit long for what it is

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): The inferior ABBA winner. But then again I don't like Hung Up either so.

**kappyko** (7): idk after midnight i start doing stupid shit like creating taylor swift kanye feud megathreads

**steelstepladder** (7): The weaker of the two ABBA songs, but still good

# Can't Take Anymore

**fadedblue09** (6.5): This just makes me wonder why Dancing Queen didn't win in the first place.

**Frelock\_** (6): Nice, but not memorable

**starlitsuns** (6): This won the Greatest Hits rate? Over Dancing Queen? I do not get the same vibes from Dancing Queen when listening to this so perhaps this is just a me issue.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man)

**CreepyMannequin** (5.5): sounds flaccid after hearing Cher’s cover admittedly

**welcometoNY** (5): very overrated song, not that great particularly compared to the rest of ABBA's discography

**bulforster** (4.6): (#30) Its stiffness detracts from the cheesy ABBA fun for me.

**CrimsonROSET** (2.5): Good thing about the ABBA songs being right next to each other: it's very easy to tell which one is way better!

# All the Madonna Comments

**seanderlust** (9.5): y'all ever want to see every mid-forties gay man who gets WAY too into madonna/gaga comparisons go absolutely apeshit, put this song on

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Here's your obligatory Hung Up comment. Every little thing that you say or do / I'm hung up / I'm hung up on you / Waiting for your call / Baby night and day / I'm fed up / I'm tired of waiting on you

**aestheticen** (9): Every little thing that you say or… oh wrong song

**quinnpsych** (9): Prefer it when it's mashed with Hung Up, but is still a top tier song

**runaway3212** (9): Hung up is a better song, sorry :-/

**sarcasticsobs** (9): nice try, madonna (disclaimer: i love “hung  up”)

**SideBTrack8** (6.5): Hung Up >>>

**nooodisaster** (6): ima just say it... madonna (and Stuart Price) did it better.

**hikkaru** (3): the way madonna made this way better

**Roxieloxie** (3): Hung Up by Madona samples this? I hate that song so I guess this is an improvement of sorts. The track is sort of all over the place which I dont enjoy


# All the Ava Max Comments

**bbfan132** (10): right now baby i’m torn…

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i luv torn by ava max <3

**wavingwolves** (7): ava max

**PuggleMaster** (5): this song was alright didn't really care for it though, but the instrumental part that gets sampled in Torn is amazing.

# All the Comments that Mentioned Both

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Invented Madonna and Ava Max

**skargardin** (10): right now baby i'm torn

**static\_int\_husp** (10): iconic by itself. iconic when sampled by Maddona. Just kinda there when sampled by Ava Max.

**Tolk1en** (10): from Madonna to Ava, this song has inspired so many artists and must remain at the center of te pop music culture

**engifear** (9): That synth line is still everything. Don't forget it's use as a sample in Hung Up and Torn.

# The One Person Who Remembers Cher's Cover

**succulentils** (8.5): The Cher version is better

# Sorry

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): The better ABBA song in the rate. And don't you DARE mention the M word!

>To summarize the immense disappointment I felt by this song that I feel is ridiculously overrated winning All Stars 3, allow me to make a comparison to another dissapointing All Stars 3 that saw the success of white mediocrity:

> Dancing Queen = Trixie

> Umbrella = Shangela

> Disturbia = Bebe

> Hard Times = DeLa

> Closer = Thorgy

> That aside though I do see why Dancing Queen pulled out the win even if I'm not the biggest fan of it, it's undeniably a classic and something that even baby gays can get behind! - /u/hikkaru

And the second ABBA also bites the dust! Did you see that one coming? I was lowkey shocked that these two songs were always skirting on the edges of the top 10, never decidedly getting very deep into day 3, and when the final results came out I knew that getting ABBA out right at the end of day 2 would be a fun little gag. 

I would've happily accepted a "Dancing Queen" win, though, especially if it managed to win again without a single 11. It's a testament to how beloved this song is that most people just tossed it a perfect score and didn't think much else. And can you blame them? It's such a groovy track with a downright iconic opening, inviting you to just glide along and really believe that you, too, can dance. I'm surprised that people can even find it in their hearts to dislike this song at all, to be quite honest!

letsallpoo: # Young and Sweet

**aestheticen** (10): Classic

**anothertown** (10): This song is the strongest argument our civilization has for opening with the chorus

**bbfan132** (10): i’ve heard this way too many times but i still love it

**chillbumps5** (10): one of the greatest songs of all time

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): God, I have such a special memory of this song. My mother would often play this song as an attempt to make me stop crying. Like my feelings went 😭 to 😊 in a millisecond. I would say that this song is my early exposure to pop music in some form, along with Spice Girls.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): YOUNG AND SWEET, ONLY SEVENTEEN

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): https://positivewlwvibes.tumblr.com/post/181095452809/can-you-imagine-how-fuckong-nuts-straight-people

**ignitethephoenix** (10): absolute classic, deserved to be the only winner with no 11’s because it’s that universally loved

**ImADudeDuh** (10): We want this to win with no 11s again.

**jasannn** (10): A karaoke classic.

**lIIustration** (10): I am not the dancing queen ): but this still slaps

**ManofOranges** (10): I just know this song is gonna get tanked because probably have a vendetta against it for winning All Stars (I can't say I blame them) but I would just like to point out that this song won for a reason, that reason being that it's great

**MelodramaticLemonade** (10): Listening to ABBA for the first time for this rate but god this is such a perfect and instantly infectious pop song, if I have a second 11 it will go to this

**Mudkip1** (10): pop perfection

**nooodisaster** (10): DANCING QUEEN!! YOUNG AND SWEET!! ONLY SEVENTEEN!!!

**PuggleMaster** (10): This is such a great song that i'm sure will be in the top 10 and it totally deserves it.

**runaway3212** (10): This song is really fucking great

**sarcasticsobs** (10): disco is fun, detractors are cowards

**skargardin** (10): go off

**SmileAndTears** (10): Iconic, simply iconic luv

**starlitsuns** (10): I have nothing but good memories of this song. That is all I have to say.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this is the song that’s gonna play on my end of movie freeze frame montage when I finally get arrested for smuggling kilos of cocaine through a suppository

**TiltControls** (10): Hoping ABBA can pull off a Dancing Queen part 2

**twat\_brained** (10): skinny legends. stan for clear skin

**welcometoNY** (10): a pop classic for a reason!

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): It would be a crime for me not to rate this a 10

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i love this but also if it wins again im gonna have an ulcer

**pat-rickstar** (9.8): Don’t love this quite as much as Gimme (x3) so that’s why it's not a 10

**intheaftermath** (9.5): the piano is by far the best part of this song. It adds so much to the chorus even though it's so small. So thank you, whoever played the piano here

**1998tweety** (9): Massive gay bop

**steelstepladder** (9): Probably ABBA's best song but Mamma Mia (the movie) is genuinely terrible and I've always had a bad knee jerk reaction to ABBA since don't @ me

**suhonyu** (9): i mean children were singing this song at weddings,graduations, funerals

**vayyiqra** (9): I did not like this song much as a kid and now I see how foolish I was

**bulforster** (8.8): (#9) I feel like this is going to get some undeserved backlash for how it won...

**WeastofEden44** (8.8): Imma be honest, there are better ABBA songs

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): okay after having an umpteenth abba phase earlier this year i've come to realize this isnt even in their top 5

**shhhneak** (8.7): I don’t think we appreciate how hard this chorus goes enough.

**addupten** (8.5): I wish the glee cover did justice to this bop

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Lol I remember how everyone was upset when this won. I didn't give it a 10 back then , so I don't feel accountable for any of that.

**succulentils** (8.5): LOL @ the random A5 "YEAHHHH" in the background right before the 3 minute mark

**aresthormars** (8): You can never go wrong with D I S C O.

**Frelock\_** (8): Good, but don't think it's aged as well

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): Mamma Mia is the superior ABBA song

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): this song is a fucking bop. it's groovy, it's a skating rink classic, and it feels like that time that boy tried to kiss me at a church lock in and i ducked away from him because even then the touch of a man repelled me but in a good way

**quinnpsych** (8): Ruined a little bit for me by being so overplayed at every single party I'm at, but still slaps

**waluigiest** (8): we love a truly congenial winner. This song makes me want to learn how to roller skate

**wavingwolves** (8): sparkly synths yas

**Stryxen** (7.8): ah that’s history

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.1): god i wish that were me

**CarlieScion** (7): i resent this song for reminding me that im no longer young and sweet, only seventeen

**CrimsonROSET** (7): Listening to it in the car, I scored it a 10. Listening to it at 2AM in bed, I scored it a 4. I'll just split the difference.

**ReallyCreative** (7): yeah I'm still upset it won the all stars rate, it's fine but it's outclassed

**seanderlust** (7): seventeen is too young for a monarch, I will not stand for this.

**Tolk1en** (7): quite good but it is far from their best

# No Longer Seventeen

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6): don't come for me, I think they have better songs

**RandomHypnotica** (5.8): Look, this song is catchy, but it's also kinda lackluster compared to everything else in this rate

**joshually** (5): this would be a perfect 10 except I dock points for the question “young and sweet only 17” datedly creeper part

**selegend** (5): kinda overrated

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): overrated

**akanewasright** (4): I love ABBA with all my gay heart. I’m pretty sure I was shot out of the womb singing Gimme x3. My parents used to play “Thank You For The Music” on long car rides to keep me from crying. But I do not like this song.

**hikkaru** (3): i hate it here

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): this song smells like old people

**Roxieloxie** (1.2): I do not get the appeal of this song, is it nice? I guess but I dont know if it really holds up against everything else in the rate. The only thing thats fun is the chorus. it redeems itself a little bit because my little brother likes this song and hearing it reminds me of him

**mysario** (0): it's still not the S Club 7 version

> A hip hop song, just like Starboy by The Weeknd. In hindsight, the 21st Century Hip Hop #1s rate was a bad idea with the Billboard Decade-End rate just around the corner. But hey, at least we gave this objective classic a rate win it would probably never get otherwise, and we kept Kanye from becoming the artist with the most wins in rate history. - /u/TragicKingdom1 

 > Hey Ya! was always bound to win the rate, for two reasons: it's an iconic piece of music and it was also the whitest track in the mix besides the Macklemore songs. It's the epitome of happy sad and the fact many people to this day are still clueless of its real meaning shows how genius and great this song is. Nothing more to say, just shake it like a polaroid picture. - /u/MashLuke

---

Did you know we weren't the first -heads subreddit to have a rate won by OutKast? That distinction instead goes to, of all subs, /r/indieheads, where this song took the crown of their rate of the top 50 songs of the 2000s, as chosen by Pitchfork. If you look at the [lowest scores for its winning post](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/6y1rrl/rate_reveal_the_pitchfork_rate_day_3_every_song/dmk8wrc/), you'll even see me there! Oopsies. 

This song has grown on me, and that's honestly mostly because I stopped trying to enjoy the music video of the song (and its annoying incessant screaming effect applied all over it) and just enjoyed the song as is. It's just a solid pop song (that won a rate for hip hop #1s, which feels a little weird, but I'll leave that to others to comment on), and the fact that it's notched a win on both /r/popheads and /r/indieheads is a testament to its universal appeal. When is OutKast getting their well-deserved halftime show, though?

**jsonphile** (11): this song is alright alright alright alright alright alright alright OKAY NOW LADIES no but seriously this song is just a perfect genre blending song every line is iconic as hell and I genuinely think it’s impossible not to like this song

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): one time i listened to this song on repeat for 2 hours straight so i could finish this essay for school and ever since then it’s activated my fight or flight instinct but, like, in a good way

letsallpoo: # Straight People

**aresthormars** (10): I love this song when I saw a video of dissecting this song. The composition is so good at hiding the dark lyrics.

**bbfan132** (10): i need to listen to this album at some point

**bespectacIed** (10): remember when the least hip-hop hip-hop song won the hip-hop rate lol. Gave this an 11 so i share the blame

**CrimsonROSET** (10): This is really good! How did it win one of our only rap rates!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This song was played a lot when I was a kid, but I never knew the title until I was 17. You should see how shocked I was when Andre 3000 from Class of 3000 is actually a real person and made this "unnamed" bop from my childhood.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The jingle in the background during the "hey ya" is the most recognizable thing in this rate tbh.

**fadedblue09** (10): Timeless bop. Here's to hoping it pulls an upset.

**frogaranaman** (10): me when I find an AskReddit thread that asks about sad songs that sound happy: Hey Ya

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic, don’t rob this song because it has men in it! It’s easily a top 10 song here

**ImADudeDuh** (10): it good

**intheaftermath** (10): I swear this song is made of pure serotonin. I can't listen to it without smiling. Which is funny, considering it's about being miserable in a relationship

**ManofOranges** (10): Purely an iconic song. I hope this one gets far.

**mysario** (10): RIP polaroids

**nooodisaster** (10): Um....... perfection? Hooks on hooks on hooks, lyrical depth, pussy-pop-ability. Bow down.

**pat-rickstar** (10): Classic

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): it's just such a good song that it doesn't make any logical sense. it sounds like it came out 20 years ago but also yesterday. what a jam.

**ReallyCreative** (10): Gen Z will never understand how hard this song hit in elementary school when it came on the radio while riding the bus home... we could not be contained

**Roxieloxie** (10): Due to my area code im legally required to give this a 10 or higher

**runaway3212** (10): This is an amazing song

**seanderlust** (10): all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all

**skargardin** (10): HEEEEEEEEEEEEY YAAAAAA

**starlitsuns** (10): The best happy-sounding sad song ever.

**steelstepladder** (10): Atlanta is really coming through in the election I can't not give OutKast a 10

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay

**vayyiqra** (10): ALRIGHTALRIGHTALRIGHTALRIGHT what an iconic song

**wavingwolves** (10): i shake it i shake it shake it uh

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9.8): pretty sure I still know every word

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I often cite this as the perfect pop song. It’s iconic.

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): lucy liu

**camerinian** (9): I've heard this song millions of times and I've only just recently started paying attention "nah, y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance" line, am I the problem

**CarlieScion** (9): the ultimate family get together song

**Frelock\_** (9): Fun and iconic.

**kappyko** (9): I hate reddit /r/ music nerds for ruining this BOP!!!!

**plastichaxan** (9): pure serotonin yup

**slimboyfriend** (9): Taking off a point because it would be really boring if this song won

**TiltControls** (9): Great, but if I see it in another AskReddit "wHaT SoNg LyRiCs MeAnInG pEoPle dON't rEaLiZe" i'm dropping this to a 0

**waluigiest** (9): a great song ironically and unironically

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): I rarely listen to this anymore tbh but I can’t let myself forget when I was 6 years old and this was one of my favorite songs in the world

**1998tweety** (8): she's cute

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): SHAKE IT LIKE A POLAROID PICTURE

**PuggleMaster** (8): Girl they play this song more than some of the current songs on pop radio.

**Stryxen** (8): I love this song and I know all the words but it gets on the nerves sometimes yknow nothing personal

**WeastofEden44** (7.7): Tbh, I don't have any real memories associated with this song other than it just ran on a loop in the background of my childhood

**twat\_brained** (7.4): I don't think I can ever really hate this song but I'm definitely over it.

**InternetDude19** (7.2): Overplayed

# popheads

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Objectively this song is good but also it gives me an anxiety attack.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): For an undetermined reason, I consistently get this song mixed up with Mambo No. 5, and as a result I get dissapointed every time I hear this song.

**anothertown** (6): this has aged

**hikkaru** (6): popheads: starboy isn't hiphop wtf!!! also popheads: hey ya best hiphop #1 of the 21st century yup yup

**joshually** (4): it was great when it was great… now it’s just kind… there

**lIIustration** (4): this is controversial but this song isn’t great, lasts too long and the “hey ladies” is very awkward

**bulforster** (3.8): (#34) I feel like this is supposed to be fun but it just isn’t for me.

**welcometoNY** (3): i didn't realize people actually liked this song to be honest. it's fine for a bit but it gets annoying quickly and overall there's just nothing great or even good about it.

**zadooi** (3): Perhaps my most unpopular opinion. This song does less than nothing for me.

**PointlessBibliophage** (2): no

**wanderingimpromptu3** (1): It's very catchy but it stresses me out

**InfernalSolstice** (0): so annoying

Day 3. Six excellent black women VS. a british crone worshipped by snooty gays, a popper sniffing anthem who's out-relevant-ed by a white man's cover, a nobody who said the n-word, and an electropop song that aged like hummus

letsallpoo: it's especially better than the top 10 of the first winners rate, which had 1 black man vs 8 white women and the killers

overall these results so far could've been a lot worse in terms of race, mostly because day 1 was mostly a mayocide. of course, tomorrow's final results will state definitively whether or not we're racist
