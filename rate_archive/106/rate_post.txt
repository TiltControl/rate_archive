Well, it's here. We've made it. Over four years have passed since I made [an innocent little post](https://redd.it/4xmic6) suggesting that we assign some numbers to some songs, and we've now amassed 100 unique rate-winning songs. To celebrate this milestone, /u/rickikardashian and I would like to cordially invite you to reflect on the latter half of these seminal tunes. This is the second edition of the Winners Rate, where we will once again see which song is truly the best of the best.

The songs here span from A to Z, from 1971 to 2020, hip-hop to k-pop, movie soundtracks to video game OSTs, certified classics to beloved album cuts, from one synthpop song titled "Strangers" made by a Norwegian pop girl to a different song that also fits that exact description. These songs represent all sorts of styles and tastes, but they all fit into the canon of pop music that this subreddit champions — the kind of pop music that can be anything and everything. And most importantly, all of these songs have made it here by triumphing in a bloody battle against dozens of other worthy songs in a violent spectacle that we call rates. It seems like every rate that happens nowadays gets deemed The Worst Rate™: the rate with the messiest, most preposterous, most downright *homophobic* results ever. But this rate? This rate will likely have the actual messiest, most preposterous, most homophobic, and most worstest results known to man. And I wouldn't want it any other way.

May your favorites triumph. Here are the songs:

# The Rules

* You must rate every single song here for your scores to be accepted. The program used to calculate everything will not accept your ballot if you are missing a score.
* Keep in mind that your scores are not confidential! Every single number you assign to every song here will be revealed for the world to see!
* **Don't be a dumbass, and don't troll.** I can accept scores that demonstrate atrocious taste (I'm already bracing myself for /u/TragicKingdom1's scores), but if I reserve the right to reject your ballot if I think your primary motivation is to fuck up the results. The rate program I'm using has an objective way of determining how much your scores differ from the mean, and I will be using it!
* Assign a score to each song between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine, so long as they are to one decimal place (i.e. 5.4 is fine, 5.42 is not). Also, please use periods (.) for the decimal places and not commas (,) — I'm American trash, I'm sorry.
* You may give **ONE** song an 11 and **ONE** song a 0. Reserve these scores for your favorite and least favorite songs in the rate. These special scores are **not** mandatory.
* Feel free to change your scores at any time up to the due date! Just shoot me a PM telling me what you'd like to adjust.
* If you would like to add a comment to your scores, the correct way to format them can be found below:

>Robyn - Dancing On My Own: 8 I love this Calum Scott cover!

* Don't add a comma between the score or your comment, don't put your comment in parentheses, and don't add line breaks to it. Also, don't write some malicious headassery in your comment or I'll just delete it and judge you.
