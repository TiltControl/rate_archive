> I Will Survive: One of the biggest gay anthems of all time. This may not be my favorite song from the Classic Disco Singles Rate, but this definitely feels like one of the most important songs of the rate. An iconic piano line, some great vocals, and I "fuck you, I know I'm strong" attitude make this a MOMENT in pop music, and LGBT history. 

 > **Covering the Covers:** Despite me doing 4 different I Will Survive covers in the original reveal, I still somehow missed [The Pussycat Dolls' cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qy-2huCXM4) of this song. They remixed with their original song Hush Hush, and it was their final single from 2009 until React in 2020. Listening to the remix, it's not surprising this wasn't the big hit that helped them out, even when they were just coming off of Jai Ho being their last single. - /u/ImADudeDuh

---

"I Will Survive" fluctuated around the edge of the 10 top all throughout voting, never dipping too much higher or too much lower. Its standing here as voting came to a close got extremely shaky, but titles can be destinies ‚Äî she did end up surviving into day 3, beating out Outkast and those damn ABBA songs in the process.

"I Will Survive" is a relatively straightforward song, with a simple melody and lyrics about letting a deadbeat man go, all held together by Gloria Gaynor's glorious vocals. Yet the song has taken on more meaning ever since it became a disco hit in the late 70s, becoming a rallying cry of sorts for the LGBT community as they underwent the blunt of the AIDS epidemic. Sometimes you need that direct, confident message of survival just to make it through to the next day, and you can't help but feel stronger about yourself when you listen to the song. I believe this is the only track in this rate to have even been put in the National Recording Registry because of its cultural relevance ‚Äî only a slightly more impressive distinction that being a popheads-rate-winning song.

letsallpoo: # Discoheads

**1998tweety** (10): absolutely iconic, we love a gay icon

**bbfan132** (10): a disco classic that will be screwed over here

**camerinian** (10): 10 is also the age I was when I did a flawless lip sync of this at my Christian summer camp and no doubt caused a sea of homosexual awakening amongst the other church-going queers

**CarlieScion** (10): bop but blondie deserved

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I'm still alive, thankfully.

**fadedblue09** (10): As much as I feel indifferent towards disco, I'm glad this won, as it works well as an anti-oppression anthem (and isn't that what disco is all about?).

**frogaranaman** (10): timeless bop

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): if you haven't dramatically karaoked this song don't even look at me

**ignitethephoenix** (10): cured all my ailments

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the disco rate was honestly some of the most fun i‚Äôve had on popheads

**lIIustration** (10): Close to getting my 11, I hope this song survives

**ManofOranges** (10): Still kind of sad that Donna Summer lost the Disco Rate, although this song definitely is a deserving winner I will give it that

**pat-rickstar** (10): Some people were so bitter about this winning the disco rate lol, I hope it does well here too

**PuggleMaster** (10): Justice for miss Gaynor after those 2 drag queens absolutely ruined the lip sync to this song. Also this song has basically been me this entire year.

**quinnpsych** (10): And don't you forget that this song is the blueprint, she is the moment

**runaway3212** (10): The Hermes House Band version is a 12, but this is fine too.

**skargardin** (10): iconic

**SmileAndTears** (10): I remember being obsessed with this song before I knew I was gay

**starlitsuns** (10): Disco perfection. That‚Äôs all I have to say.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): rasputin should have won the disco rate but this is still a banger so i can‚Äôt complain

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this is secretly my best karaoke song

**twat\_brained** (10): Can we do this rate again with covers so we can give Miley's "Heart of Glass" cover the win? Then again that might mean we'd have to hear the Pussycat Dolls' trying to fix what wasn't broke so please ignore this comment.

**welcometoNY** (10): truly one of the greatest songs of all time, a timeless anthem for sure

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.9): Iconic gay enthem, but not a 10 bc I'm bitter about it winning the disco rate

**jsonphile** (9.5): several years ago on Thanksgiving my aunt sent my family an e-card that had a turkey singing a parody of this song about how she would survive being eaten on Thanksgiving and I think about that a lot

**kappyko** (9.5): rpdr conditioned me into thinking this was bad because of that awful lip sync and karaoke did not help but now that i sit down with it.... queen.

**aresthormars** (9): You can never go wrong with D I S C O. But this is such a great song! I will associate this song to Hush Hush by Pussycat Dolls and parody of a band in our country named Parokya Ni Edgar which is called Picha Pie.

**cocosairdep** (9): I just rated this an 11 in the Disco Rate, but now I really need my faves to win. Sorry Gloria :(

**Frelock\_** (9): An anthem for strong independent singles everywhere

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): ICONIC!!

**nooodisaster** (9): Okay but can they re-do this song on Drag Race already?

**Roxieloxie** (9): Is this a good song, yes, however It should not have won over September

**selegend** (9): iconic

**Stryxen** (9): good for her

**waluigiest** (9): a huge display of gay rights. I heard this at age 10 and KNEW

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): me @ myself every day of the pandemic

**seanderlust** (8.5): hot take alert! I think this one actually deserved to win the disco rate. donna summer is the queen of disco, yes, but the impact this one has. everyone in the western world knows this song, and for good reason. it's in the library of congress and, of equal importance, in this rate.

**mysario** (8.3): Cake version still outsold

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): Drag Race ruined this song for me imo

**racloves** (8): corona mood

**suhonyu** (8): iconic karaoke banger

**WeastofEden44** (7.8): Remember when Laila and Dax wearily spun into each other?

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): a Donna Summer song should be here but y'all have no taste

**TiltControls** (7.2): We should have been rating Donna Summer here. Still it's iconic, but after so many years of overplay it does drain on you a little (still good though)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is iconic and I would say that I like it but I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs one of those songs where the more I dig into the genre that spawned it the more the shine wears off for me. Like when this is the only disco song you know it‚Äôll make you lose your mind but once you actually listen to some Diana Ross and Donna Summer it just kinda becomes another hit on the list. I‚Äôm also still kinda bothered by the tempo of this song because you can‚Äôt quite dance to it but it‚Äôs not a ballad so I‚Äôm unsure how my body is supposed to respond.

**wavingwolves** (7): gay!

# Did Not Survive the Lip Sync

**bluehxrizon** (6): dax exclamationpoint is shaking

**steelstepladder** (6): Weak against the field.

**vayyiqra** (6): I'm tired of this song but it's a classic

**CrimsonROSET** (4): Scoring on a curve is hard for songs like this, where it's normally a 7, but in this context, it's a 4, because I'm giving 10s my 7s. Does that make sense?

**joshually** (4): ‚ÄúGreat chorus, terrible verses‚Äù ‚Äì admitted everything drunk girl at karaoke after bombing on stage with this song

**bulforster** (3): (#38) Donna was robbed.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (3): Y'all complain when pop stars recycle their material to make hits, but when literally a line of melody gets looped endlessly to eternity the song suddenly becomes a classic? Get your standards right

> Caroline struck gold with this song, upon closer inspection, it's really not hard to see why this song is so beloved and how it win its original rate. The light and bouncy production paired with Caroline's effortless vocal delivery makes for an instantly danceable tune and by extension, her signature solo song so far. It also helps that this is a topic that many can relate to. It's earnest in its simplcity while also having enough quirks that makes it more than sum of its parts, the "show me the banana" part never fails to make me smile in its absurdity. - /u/skargardin

Caroline Polachek going from generally unknown Chairlift member to beloved /r/popheads darling capable of toppling Charli and Carly in the span of a year was a bit surprising, but not too surprising; a skinny white girl making weird, pleasant, and decent alt-pop is a irresistible combination for any bottom. While most of *Pang* takes itself rather seriously, "So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings" is distinctly sillier and more fun. And how can you not be, with a title like that? Caroline sings about how she needs this man to oh please not send her any sexy pictures, because she's already crying on the dance floor and seeing him will just make her feel worse. Like, just imagine her at a club, "Fergalicious" blasting on the stereo, and suddenly a dick pic flashes up on her screen ‚Äî one so activates her nether regions so intensely that she bursts into tears. The drama!

I enjoy this campy little song enough; my only real problem is that her questionable enunciation gets in the way of the featherlight feeling, best represented by how that cry of "uradhaheoney one who knows me babe!" dampens the chorus. But after the onslaught of downtempo tracks "Door," "Ocean of Tears," and "Parachute," this song was a true delight to hear from her, where she could let loose and dance around and channel her sadness into a campy fervor. I especially enjoy how, in an album full of bizarre (and mildly unlistenable) [whale-watching noises](https://youtu.be/g_VgkkURF_w?t=63) (including on this song), the most visceral sound she makes with her mouth isn't one of those moans, but that sharp gasp at the end of the bridge, like she's been shot through the heart or finally been shown the banana. It's a one-second sound that manages to convey so much ‚Äî the true pi√®ce de r√©sistance of not only the song but also the entire album.

**fxsparrow** (11): One of my most played songs this year

**jasannn** (11): I've only known this song since July after lurking through the rates. I was expecting Charli or Carly to win for sure based off the subreddit's love for them. I was shocked to find out the feature on "Tears" won the rate with a pretty high score. I was underwhelmed on my first listen but its simplicity and catchiness slowly took over my summer and it has been on repeat everyday since. Thank you Popheads for showing me this incredible song.

**moooo566** (11): im going to be the only one to choose correctly here, but i will do my duty

**Stryxen** (11): I laughed, I cried a number of times, I sweat, I danced, I got shot, I ate and I had many epiphanies.

letsallpoo: # In the Mood for a Banana

**anothertown** (10): I love Pang

**aresthormars** (10): This is my fave in PANG and it is such a bop. Show me the banana line will forever hit me.

**bbfan132** (10): sick of this but it‚Äôs perfect

**bespectacIed** (10): This rate was so much fun. Deserving winner of the rate. Show me the cock!

**bigbigbee** (10): I first heard this about a month ago. So while I missed its ‚Äúmoment‚Äù, as a result, I am not even a little bit tired of this song yet, and I‚Äôm here to tell anyone complaining about overplay that this song is still just as good as you thought it was back when you first heard it! I promise.

**camerinian** (10): AH-ah, ah-Ah, ah-aH is such a simple and flawless hook I can‚Äôt believe it only came into the world a year ago

**CarlieScion** (10): i heard this playing in a mcdonalds once

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): ah ah ah ah ah AH!

**engifear** (10): Show me the banana

**hunnybee12** (10): i've played this a million times and it never gets old

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this song is just so irresistible

**J\_Toe** (10): went from hating the song to loving the song

**ktajlili** (10): show me your banana.

**ManofOranges** (10): It's a really great song, I must admit. I was kind of shocked when Gone lost to this song, but this song absolutely deserved to win. It's got a lot of great things going for it, specifically the huge GASP at the end of the song. I absolutely love that part

**Mudkip1** (10): pop perfection

**plastichaxan** (10): cultural reset

**PuggleMaster** (10): Caroline really snapped on this song, and while I prefer Door this still gets a 10 from me. Show me the banana na na na na.. Lyrical genius

**quinnpsych** (10): My god, what a song. Every time I hear it it's still fresh, definitely one of my most played songs of 2020

**racloves** (10): this song goes so hard

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song is gay rights I shouldn't have to expand on that it should just be understood

**runaway3212** (10): This song is beyond great, it really showcases the best parts of pop music. It on its own could start the second wave of poptimism

**sarcasticsobs** (10): s  h  o  w  m  e  t  h  e  b  a  n  a  n  a

**SmileAndTears** (10): I too am horny Caroline

**steelstepladder** (10): It might be overhyped for a lot of people but it's still great

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i made my friends listen to this with me once and they said it sounded like straight girl music how am i supposed to tell them that this song‚Äôs biggest audience is actually gay men

**twat\_brained** (10): check like Caroline Pola

**waluigiest** (10): this song reconfigured my brain chemistry

**welcometoNY** (10): the song that simultaneously introduced me to Caroline and made me a stan

**pat-rickstar** (9.8): One of the absolute best songs of last year

**InternetDude19** (9.5): Banana

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.5): Such a good tune, the increasingly deep sighs she takes always me feel something.

**slimboyfriend** (9.2): I‚Äôm amazed at how much I love this song because there‚Äôs not much to it

**WeastofEden44** (9.2): Me going on Grindr and seeing all my unanswered DMs:

**1998tweety** (9): I would give this a higher score if not for the weird bridge. Bops though

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): The fact that Caroline Polacheck WON over the Queen of Popheads Carly Rae Jepsen is a huge fucking shocker. I should finally start listening to her album because this song is FREAKING GOOD.

**fadedblue09** (9): I probably like a couple of songs on Pang better but otherwise a deserving winner.

**raicicle** (9): this has always felt like caroline‚Äôs most obvious nod towards her chairlift days and we love that chairlift‚Äôs legacy is being respected

**suhonyu** (9): love this banger

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): did you know Caroline filmed this video at the popheads HQ?

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8.8): I listened to this too much and now I don't like it as much :(

**seanderlust** (8.8): "show me the banana" LMFAOOO

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): This isn't even Top 5 from Pang

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I gave this my eleven when we rated it but time has kinda dulled the shine on it, it‚Äôs still good but I find myself visiting it (and Caroline in general) pretty infrequently. It‚Äôs fun to see an artist have such a strong sense of humor while still taking their music seriously and the bridge is iconic but I have to be in a really specific mood for this kind of music.

**joshually** (8.5): I find this song to be extremely cute

**jsonphile** (8.5): never heard of this song or the artist but I see why popheads like it

**cremeebrulee** (8): yes this shrunk on me. what about it

**mysario** (8): TIL she's 35

**nooodisaster** (8): dylan o'brien throughout my entire high school career

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): she might be trash, but she knows how to make a song. oh caroline, why did you turn out to suck as a human? anywhos. this song is real gay, and reminds me of the first time i watched a britney spears video and cried because i knew i was gay and i wanted to touch her stomach a lot. it captures a feeling we've all had of yearning and longing and wanting to slap someone because they are so hot it doesn't make any logical sense.

**Roxieloxie** (8): i can vibe with it

**vayyiqra** (8): It's overrated and the banana jokes were never that funny but it's still a bop

**wavingwolves** (8): not like i'm counting the days... but it's been 25 (since i've left my house)

**hikkaru** (7.5): carly was ROBBED!!

**starlitsuns** (7.5): I can‚Äôt think of anything that describes my feelings for this song? But it‚Äôs nice at the very least.

**bulforster** (7.4): (#16) Extremely relatable

**CrimsonROSET** (7): Remember when Caroline won over Charli and Carly? Shoutouts to her. I wish it was with a better song.

**lIIustration** (7): just too repetitive at times for me, but a great general sound

# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTTFmWr3UrI

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.8): this is nice but hit me where it hurts is superior

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Probably the most overrated song of 2019

**Frelock\_** (4): By the book melodies and harmonies & lyrics that don't really speak to me.

**moonagenightmares** (3): the ah-ah ah-ah ah-ahs are annoying, also kinda sounds like a boring marina reject. I assume someone else will make a ‚Äúshow me your banana‚Äù joke

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): I hesitated to do this in the original rate, but not this time. It's bottom half of the album but somehow it won for being relatable, I guess.

> There is so much to say about the journey Dancing on My Own has been on. Upon release it was commercial flop. It never charted on the Billboard Hot 100, along with the album it was from "Body Talk" peaking at #168 on the UK Chart and #142 on the Billboard 200 chart. However as time would prove it was truly 'ahead of its time'. As time went on through word of mouth and pop music shifted it was apparent how influential this song was, along with the culture being affected by the Poptimism Movement (which was not just blanketly dismissing all pop music as having no artistic value).  Legendary music producer Max Martin said it was "one of the best pop songs ever made" and would say throughout the 2010s many "female artists" he worked with would "put it on the table and say I wanna make this!".  Robyn became the queen and standard for every "Cry On The Dancefloor" pop song.

Due to people finally catching up with Robyn the song would later go on to be certified Platinum in the US along with the cover done by Calum Scott in 2016 going Double Platinum in the US.  At the end of the decade aggregating site Acclaimed Music ranked it The Best Song of the 2010s based off it toping the greatest song of the decade list on  Rolling Stone, NME, Stereogum, Slant Magazine, Consequence of Sound,The Associated Press, Insider, Esquire, iNews, Vanyaland  and Audiofemme. Paste and Good Housekeeping ranked it second, along with Pitchfork ranking it third. In conclusion this is the definitively the best pop song of the decade and arguably the best song of the 2010s. - /u/JunkyGS

---

I understand the love for this song just as much as I do its slightly surprising animosity. If you were a forum homosexual, or just a general homosexual, in 2010, you probably had this song shoved down your throat perpetually online, while in real life you'd be very unlikely to ever actually encounter it on the radio. It had the perfect blend of catchiness, gay appeal, and legitimate critical acclaim, so much so that the gays, the Pitchfork people, and the Pitchfork gays have not stopped yelling about this song and Robyn since then. If you aren't charmed by the song, I can see it being rather annoying. In addition, the fact that it took Calum Scott to straightwash it (before he came out of the closet) to make it a hit was partly hilarious, mostly insulting.

"Dancing On My Own" remains a gay staple. Robyn taps into the solitude that comes from not only rejection, but being rejected in favor of someone better than you, and it's easy to imagine a homo crying about this as they think about their straight crush with his girlfriend. Yet the pulsating beat (one that we've heard so many times since, yet not before this song), and the crystalline synths chiming above encourage you not to despair, but to continue dancing, even if you're on your own. It's a song of strength and self-reliance, and it's a song that's always there for you when you need it.

**JunkyGS** (11): song of the decade by critics for a reason!!

**MelodramaticLemonade** (11): https://twitter.com/triszhermogenes/status/1104242103150936064

**nooodisaster** (11): "Compiling over 35 global outlets' countdowns and 550 tracks, critics' algorithmic aggregator Acclaimed Music went on to rank Robyn's original album midtempo version of "Dancing on My Own" as the greatest song of the 2010s.[106] The track was considered the greatest of the decade by Rolling Stone,[107] NME,[108] Stereogum,[109] Slant Magazine,[110] Consequence of Sound,[111] The Associated Press,[112] Insider,[113] Esquire,[114] iNews,[115] Vanyaland[116] and Audiofemme.[117] TIME,[118] Paste[119] and Good Housekeeping[120] ranked it second, Pitchfork[121] third, Elle[122] and Treble[123] fourth and USA Today[124] ninth. Gorilla vs. Bear[125] ranked it twelfth, Crack Magazine[126] thirteenth, NBHAP[127] fifteenth, and Uproxx[128] eighteenth." - Jesus

**bbfan132** (10): that was a classic, that was a classic

**bulforster** (10): (#2) The ultimate sad banger, invented crying in the club.

**camerinian** (10): FUCK Calum Scott, all my homos HATE Calum Scott

**CarlieScion** (10): this is great but also if it wins im gonna be so dissapointed

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): thinking about experiencing this live... one of the greatest nights in my LIFE

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): If there is one thing I liked about HBO's Girls, it's discovering this song. I never knew the lyrics would actually hit me until I actually went to college. Feeling so alone while most of my friends were hanging out without me is the worst. Sometimes I would decline, sometimes I wasn't even allowed to, and sometimes they just don't invite me. It feels like my sadness is interpreted as bitter to my friends because of that. Sigh, sophomore year was not a great year for me for sure.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): GOMW lost but I can't not give this a 10 under any circumstances.

**fadedblue09** (10): You know a song is objectively good when people who don't care about club music (e.g. myself) are somehow emotionally moved by it.

**frogaranaman** (10): iconic and lovely

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of the Pandora stations at my work has a dance remix of the Callum Hood version of this song in its rotation and I‚Äôm like wow‚Ä¶ a dance version of ‚ÄúDancing On My Own?‚Äù Imagine that. If only someone had thought to record that. :/ Anyways this is an eternal dance floor classic, sacred to the gays, the holy grail of poptimism, yada yada y‚Äôall know the drill at this point.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): every time I listen to this song I remember the video where a crowd, who just left Robyn's concert, began to sing this on the subway platform and I think wow... It's a very complex emotion

**lIIustration** (10): still haven‚Äôt forgiven Callum Scott

**ManofOranges** (10): Gave it my 11 once before and I'm honestly thinking about doing it again. This is one of those songs that's just greatness in every way. And it really goes to show how good this song is that, in a rate as stacked as the one this was one, this came out as the winner with a near-10 average.

**Mudkip1** (10): pop perfection

**nootnoot781** (10): calum scott needs to be tried at the hague for his cover. full on war crime

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): amazing. excellent. makes me sad but in a good way. great drunken dancing music.

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song is just excellence from the top down, making you feel the most devastating emotions while dancing your bussy off

**runaway3212** (10): Sometimes p4k really says it best: "At its core, the song is an exploration of contradictions: between the mechanized backbeat and Robyn‚Äôs all-too-human vocals; between a dancefloor‚Äôs collective catharsis and the isolation of being trapped inside your own skin; between the despair of the heart and the resilience of the body." ‚ÄìRyan Dombal

**seanderlust** (10): the power of the lines "stilettos and broken bottles/i'm spinning around in circles". this was one of three contenders for my 11.

**shhhneak** (10): A perfect song. Calum Scott‚Äôs version being more famous with the locals is a crime.

**skargardin** (10): I hardly know a better song, seeing this live is a moment that will never be topped. absolutely euphoric

**slimboyfriend** (10): Remember when this song was in a rate against Bionic lol

**steelstepladder** (10): I mean duh

**TragicKingdom1** (10): call your girlfriend >>

**twat\_brained** (10): ooh‚Ä¶ it's gonna be hard to argue against this winning but like, what's its competition? Mariah? ABBA perhaps? It didn't win the first Charity Rate so I won't expect it to do the same here but I anticipate it'll still be top 10

**vayyiqra** (10): crying on the dancefloor bop blah blah

**waluigiest** (10): This song inspired my ‚Äúcrying at the club‚Äù playlist and CONTINUES to be an exemplar for the genre

**welcometoNY** (10): love my scream-crying synthpop anthems

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): I want to break up with someone so I can listen to this and cry

**aresthormars** (9): I love this Calum Scott cover! /s

**jsonphile** (9): second best song on the list that‚Äôs got really sad lyrics but fantastic to dance to

**SmileAndTears** (9): Your Type outsold

**Stryxen** (9): this was my cry dance song until so hot youre hurting my feelings came out love you tho girl this goes so hard

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): is this song a banger and a half? hell yes it is. do i think it‚Äôs worthy of being considered one of the greatest songs of the 2010‚Äôs? not really.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): no one: ... absolutely no one: ... every decade end list from an indie rock publication: OH IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE! TURN IT UP!

**worlds-okayest666** (9): this would be a ten if it was the album version but the radio edit just feels a bit too cheap in comparison. with that being said, im not gonna dock off too many point bc like...its still dancing on my own. its still a total serve

**WeastofEden44** (8.6): Call Your Girlfriend is better ‚ù§Ô∏è

**fishingfor8** (8.5): speaking of the Calum Scott cover, has anyone ever noticed how the chords are wrong and just plain don't sound right?

**suhonyu** (8.5): insert juju and raven lipsync here

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Social distance, yadda yadda.

**Frelock\_** (8): A sad song with an upbeat tune: all I ever wanted.

**zadooi** (8): Overrated to me, but still pretty good.

**aestheticen** (7.5): Calum Scott outcharted and outsold this flop!

**anothertown** (7): wtf is this version?? This mix is so much weaker than the Body Talk Pt 1 version that I guess is the one I‚Äôve been listening to for the past 10years lol..?

**kirby31200** (7): Never understood the cult following. It's pretty good but I don't know about song of the decade. I guess you just had to be there?

# Kylie Minogue - Get Outta My Rate

**J\_Toe** (6): still don't like it but I can't say that without getting crucified by the subreddit

**cremeebrulee** (5): overrated

**fxsparrow** (5): i think am the only one in popheads who like calcium Salt's version more

**outsideeyess** (3.8): Don't kill me

**selegend** (2): i honestly never cared for this song .. call your girlfriend >>>>>

**bespectacIed** (1): a song so overrated by a niche group of people that a then-closeted gay man had to straight-ify it to give it relevance with the GP

**Roxieloxie**, trying to make more people delete their accounts (1): its just not a very good song

**PuggleMaster** (0): I seriously never got the hype for this song. Ever gay always hypes it up like it's some masterpiece, but in my opinion it's so meh and same-y. I guess the gays love it because they're depressed.

**RandomHypnotica** (0): I have tried for years to understand this song. Truly. But I just really, really, REALLY don't get the appeal. It feels like I'm in a circlejerk with people saying "ThE SoNg SoUnDs HaPpY, bUt ThE LyRiCs ArE sAd" like it's the most creative concept in all of music. The instrumental is repetitive and droning, Robyn's vocal performance feels lackluster, and while i appreciate the lyricism of the song, it just bores me to tears actually listening to it.

> Estelle and Kanye blew everyone out of the park in the second Charity Rate, to everyone-but-me's pleasure. I said it then and I'll say it again - this song leans heavily on nostalgia that I just don't have. There's some notes and vocal runs in the verses that make me physically cringe - it's like nails on a chalkboard. However, LITERALLY everyone else was happy with this, so YAY democracy. - /u/CarlieScion

How did this 2000s song by a relatively forgotten singer and Kanye West, a song that praises America and bougieness, win not just one rate, but make it all the way to the top 10 of this rate? The answer is that it's a fucking *jam*, and the innocence that comes with this American fetishization is palatable coming from Estelle's innocent, distinctly British delivery. It's just so cool, and Estelle even gets peak Coolye to deliver a smooth verse. How can you not be charmed by it? Like, just compare this to shit like "London Boy" to see how important sounding coquettish and laidback can be when singing about a place you're not familiar with. 

"American Boy" firmly planted itself in the top 5 for much of the rate, but fell slightly as time wore on. Part of me hoped that it could pull through for the win, but this top 10 placement is more than fine for it. I'm also glad nobody really seemed to be calling for its head throughout these reveals, or was even worried it would be going before day 3. Even if you don't like it that much, you know it's beloved enough to make it far regardless.

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): One of my favorite memories from college was being at my friend‚Äôs birthday party (we were housemates so it was in my house) and like an hour into this party, when everyone was buzzed enough to be happy but not drunk enough to be messy, this song came on. EVERYONE in the party absolutely lost their minds and everybody knew all the words and they sang along to it together, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen such pure joy radiating off of a group of people. This song is timeless and basically flawless, I‚Äôd love to see it win another rate. Also I‚Äôve become more and more of an Estelle fan with time, I think she‚Äôs a class act with a fantastic discography that goes heavily underrated by music fans and I‚Äôd encourage everybody to dig into the album this came from and the followup because they‚Äôre both great.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): I‚Äôm not lying when I say this is one of the greatest songs of the 21st century so far. A cultural reset and Kanye‚Äôs best feature

**1998tweety** (10): Absolutely iconic, one of his bests

**bbfan132** (10): kanye‚Äôs verse is one of the best rap verses in a pop song i‚Äôve ever heard

**bespectacIed** (10): best song ever made

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): YASSS GARNET SLAY DEM VOCALS!!!!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Somehow I've never heard this song until a year ago or so, and I was totally missing out. Manifesting top 5.

**fishingfor8** (10): always will be a favorite

**frogaranaman** (10): everything about this song is magic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I blame this song for Kanye running for president.

**lIIustration** (10): WHEN HE SPEAK HIS SUIT BESPOKE

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is just yet another immaculate song, especially in terms of production. Shout out to will.i.am for producing this cause this may honestly be one of the best things he's ever done. Estelle's singing is great, the lyrics are charming, and Kanye's verse is just oh so good. If this song doesn't get far I'm going to be floored

**pat-rickstar** (10): Take me back to when this was popular

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): and it was almost my 11. this song just. man, it takes me back to high school in so many ways. it makes me think of having my headphones in while i helped at the ticket stands during football games, or dancing around while i skipped class with my friends behind the bleachers. i'm revealing my age here, but whatever! this song takes me back.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): star spangled banner found dead in ditch

**PuggleMaster** (10): LOVE LOVE LOVE this song. Estelle voice blends so beautifully along the beat of the song. I'm so glad that if she had to be a one hit wonder (she deserves more!) it was this song. Even if it features that man on it......

**ReallyCreative** (10): an iconic moment in UK/USA relations

**Roxieloxie** (10): Miss Estelle is an icon.

**runaway3212** (10): I really love Kanye too much.

**skargardin** (10): ICONIC

**slimboyfriend** (10): A contender for the greatest song of the 2000s

**steelstepladder** (10): One of the best songs in the 2000's

**Stryxen** (10): kanye and the uk existing in the same cinematic universe makes this the funniest song ever released and I‚Äôm not sure anything will ever beat it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): hmm best song of the 00‚Äôs me thinks? don‚Äôt think this is a controversial opinion

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this is the only song to truly support rights for short men

**wavingwolves** (10): if this doesn't get to top 3 AT LEAST we need to throw the sub away

**worlds-okayest666** (10): what a fucking smash classic

**zadooi** (10): Only good thing to come out of the creation of America.

**TiltControls** (9.7): 100% bop

**jackisboredtoday** (9.2): when my 4th grade classmates choreographed a routine for when they sang along to this at the end of school days‚Ä¶ maybe we snapped

**camerinian** (9): This was the favourite song of the two toxic girls I had the misfortune of living with for 6 months and the fact that I can still even listen to it is a testament to how rock solid it is

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): one of the greatest choruses of all time mayhaps

**intheaftermath** (9): reminds me of my Steven Universe fandom days.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): Iconic

**J\_Toe** (9): my mom loved this song so much in 2009 she asked to buy it on itunes, even though she never bought anything else and didn't have a music player of her own

**moooo566** (9): The best Kanye song

**mysario** (9): the anti-thesis to the garbage "London Boy", thinking about how I could've submitted this for the last charity rate but I took too long to decide

**racloves** (9): I have strong memories as this song came out as I went to America for the first time

**vayyiqra** (9): classic

**waluigiest** (9): This song never gets old. I really love Estelle‚Äôs part, but Kanye‚Äôs messy verse is what stops this from being a 10

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.3): ‚Äúdon't like his baggy jeans but i might like what's underneath them‚Äù iconic

**plastichaxan** (8.3): damn it why can‚Äôt i hate this bop

**WeastofEden44** (8.2): The first time I ever heard this song was during my jazz dance class this semester. It's a really fun bop, but I wish it went somewhere a little more.

**akanewasright** (8): If will.i.am of all people can produce this

**anothertown** (8): Yeezy taught me, UK edition- Bespoke, Wags, Ribena

**nooodisaster** (8): She snapped

**SmileAndTears** (8): that synth in the chorus is so fucking ugly oh my god. its a shame cuz the rest of the song is perfect

**starlitsuns** (8): Such a cute duet! I do have to take off a couple of points because we managed to live in the timeline where Kanye tried running for president. Hopefully as I write this (October 7) this doesn‚Äôt come back to bite me.

**bulforster** (7): (#18) The only thing I will acknowledge Kanye for, not to take anything away from Estelle who is a queen but his feature really pushes this song over the top.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): This is like, all a song needs to be. The singing is good, the lyrics are fine, the rap verse is good.

**Frelock\_** (7): Really good vocals

**twat\_brained** (7): Garnet made MYRIAD points. The wannabe president... okay I'll give him credit too. But this romanticizes the United States, which we can't have. And "Mike at his baddest"... does that include the alleged p*do shit? This has really not aged well to me I'm sorry.

**aresthormars** (6): Slay Garnet!

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Kanye ate but this song is meh.

**CarlieScion** (5): okay i hosted this rate so i can be salty that everyone loved this but me. especially since my 11 was #2!!!!

**ktajlili** (5): I like the vocals and the Kayne feature, but I really don't like the synth during the chorus and pre-chorus. It's so cacophonous! I also feel like this song's premise is a little simple for a five-minute run time. She wants to travel around the US. And? IDK. I think this could have been a great song with a few changes but for now, it's just OKAY.

**fxsparrow** (4): one verse too long

**MelodramaticLemonade** (1): Those buzzing synths at the chorus are so goddamn awful and atrocious I can't even enjoy the rest of the song

> all stars 2, in my opinion, was one of the best collections of songs we've had in a rate, with not just one song in this winners rate, but two, thanks to dancing on my own's separate victory. however, the edge of glory was, in my opinion, one of the most deserving winners possible to win as2. it's one of gaga's strongest tracks, perfectly euphoric and anthemic in a way that is just so gaga. lady gaga winning on a popheads grab bag rate may be an overly expected stereotype, but this song really rises above the rest to be a discography standout for her. - /u/InfernalSolstice

---

This might be surprising to learn, but sometimes Lady Gaga does not make good career decisions. One such decision came in 2011 when, at the height of her popularity, she decided to release "Judas" on the good Christian people of the world ‚Äî on Easter, of all days. The song didn't do well, almost killing her streak of top 10 hits in America, and so Lady Gaga did something that she's done several times since: She canned this second single in favor of a different song, in this case "The Edge of Glory," which was at the time a promotional track.

It was a good decision, thankfully. "The Edge of Glory," in its stadium rock greatness, got her back on track for a solid album rollout. Not even a shitty music video that was pumped out after her collaboration with Joseph Khan fell through could stop its rise. If anything, it might be her biggest classic this side of "Bad Romance," and it's still a great electropop song that has aged well over the years. Written after the passing of her grandfather, Gaga sings about death as a wondrous transformation, something to welcome when the time comes, not to hide from, as long as you're with the ones you love. Clarence Clemons's saxophone solo ties the whole thing together, and the gravitas of the song only intensifies when you learn that this was the final song he worked on before he passed on. 

This song quickly rose to the top 10 and inched ever so slowly higher and higher, but it was blocked right on the edge of the top 5 in the end. Of the two Gaga songs to make it this far, I am glad that it's this one, even if "Poker Face" is more representational of her career and impact. "The Edge of Glory" remains a beautiful track with a touching message. I always listen through all five plus minutes whenever this comes on, from the opening heartbeats to the flatline in the coda.

**seanderlust** (11): RIP clarence clemons.

**skargardin** (11): I think it's safe to say that this is my favorite Gaga single and one of my favorite songs of all time. It's so insanely anthemic in all the best ways.

letsallpoo: # Everyone put your monsters up!

**1998tweety** (10): now THIS is one of her best songs ever. The only singular thing I would change is the verses sound a bit weird cause there's a background voice immediately repeating the lines right after the Main Gaga sings them. Now that I've mentioned it you won't be able to unhear it <3 [host note: I think that's just an echo effect]

**addupten** (10): strong contender for my 11

**aresthormars** (10): This is such a beautiful song and I remember this chorus of this song being transcribed in our quiz of Phonetics! I checked this song after that and I will forever love this song!

**astrologicalangel** (10): I wish I could give two 11s

**bbfan132** (10): the production is a glorious mess and the second half is bombastic in the best way possible

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): one of the greatest pop songs of all time PERIOD

**Frelock\_** (10): Past the edge and well into glory.

**frogaranaman** (10): the mixing is a little much but honestly it adds flare to the song for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I don‚Äôt even need to say anything, if you have ears you know this song is good.

**hikkaru** (10): gaga winning would be really boring and she'll probably have the top 2 but idc this classic is a 10 [2]

**Ionlywanttheworld** (10): the sax solo elevates this song to a ten

**J\_Toe** (10): could honestly get my 11 but the competition is tight

**jsonphile** (10): since I doubt we‚Äôll ever get a Bruce Springsteen rate in this pop sub, this is the closest I guess we‚Äôll get with a sax solo from the Big Man himself, Clarence Clemens. This song is a 9/10 by itself, but the sax solo just elevates it to the next level. Anyway stream Jungleland by Bruce Springsteen

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is just an expression of pure joy and carelessness. I love it so much. I don't see it doing that well though (dreams kind of deserved)

**nooodisaster** (10): One of Gag's most palpable songs, and still one of her greatest.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the sax the sax the sax the sax the sax the sax the sax the sax

**PuggleMaster** (10): Y'all didn't have to put two of the best Gaga songs in this rate. If Gaga was gonna pay ARTPOP dust at the Superbowl she could've at least did this song instead of a solo of Telephone.

**shhhneak** (10): is there a colloquial term for an artist‚Äôs best song from their best album? We should start referring to it as their Edge of Glory.

**slimboyfriend** (10): Every time I start listening to this song I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs not THAT good.‚Äù And then she starts singing and I realize that it is

**SmileAndTears** (10): Her best song that's still available on all streaming platforms

**starlitsuns** (10): This was iconic in 2011 when this song was on the radio and it‚Äôs still iconic now.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): always love sax solos in pop songs

**steelstepladder** (10): This is way better than Poker Face come at me

**TiltControls** (10): Still Gaga's best song to date. Everything about this song is perfection

**twat\_brained** (10): RIP Clarence Clemons, your saxophone ability will forever be unparalleled

**waluigiest** (10): I think this is her second best single behind Judas, and I‚Äôm amazed at how this took over the radio for an entire summer. It‚Äôs the song that exemplifies this era for me, both in terms of sound and lyrics. It‚Äôs a beautiful track and I‚Äôm just glad it got the public acclaim that it deserved.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): https://twitter.com/findurmeme/status/1210640618206052352

**cocosairdep** (9.5): one of the best singles off Born This Way, and certainly the one that aged the best. It‚Äôs definitely one of the highlights in her discography.

**intheaftermath** (9.5): the Glee version of this song is so good though

**suhonyu** (9.5): edging anthem

**WeastofEden44** (9.5): Tbh, I will always consider this song to be a touch overhyped by the fandom, but it's still an impeccable song

**ignitethephoenix** (9.3): Poker Face >> this song so I will rate accordingly (still a great song though).

**akanewasright** (9): A little overindulgent, but like... otherwise basically perfect

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Iconique.

**fishingfor8** (9): I like this Gaga better than the Poker Face/Bad Romance Gaga

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): that saxophone solo saved my life

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this beat Dreams and yet Dreams charted again in 2020, so who really won

**jasannn** (9): Her vocal range on this song is amazing.

**ReallyCreative** (9): I remember this was my least favorite song on BTW for a while but it's grown on me. It's just so cinematic and extra

**succulentils** (9): She sounds so young

**vayyiqra** (9): Beautiful song

**welcometoNY** (9): a stadium-shattering chorus and a god-tier sax solo combine to form what is arguably Gaga's best song

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.8): i love this song and at least half of the reason why is because i still have vivid memories of my year 5 teacher at a catholic primary school showing this music video to 30 nine year olds every morning for 2 weeks when it was released. why? i have no idea but we love her anyway

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I think this song suffers a bit when it‚Äôs divorced from its album, because the outro - which is probably cathartic in the context of listening to the Born This Way album - can feel a tiny bit overlong when just listening to this track. That being said, when I got used to the outro I couldn‚Äôt imagine listening to the song without it. The melody is just chefs kiss.

**joshually** (8): the ending is a bit long but man, this is a great song at the words part

**kirby31200** (8): Not in my BTW top 5 tbh

**runaway3212** (8): This has always felt like one of gaga's weaker singles imo

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): one time i was listening to this song with friends and they said this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/747680248199381097/774468109003653120/image0.png it‚Äôs ok gaga i still like this song </3

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I need more details on how to define the threshold of glory and what is considered the edge

**bulforster** (7.8): (#14) If you slap a saxophone on pretty much any song I'm sold, doesn‚Äôt hurt this sax is legendary.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Euphoric chorus, but somehow hearing it in full feels‚Ä¶ kinda whelming. Oh well, if Gaga wins I hope it's with this song.

**Stryxen** (7.5): I did not know this was a lady gaga song until embarrassingly recently

**anothertown** (7): The Glee version performed by the Troubletones outpeaked

**wavingwolves** (7): this winning a rate is actually a little surprising to me

# On the Edge of Getting Doxxed

**CrimsonROSET** (6.8): Of course the song for the Gays is about edging.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): The Edge of Boring

**engifear** (6.6): I still think that sax solo absolutely kills the momentum and I don't understand why so many people like it.

**CarlieScion** (6.5): the way i like the production in the glee cover more than i like the original

**bespectacIed** (6): Gaga's vocals so fucking beautiful here but the song aged exactly how a 2011 electropop song would

**mysario** (4): the sax solo is all 4 of these points

**moonagenightmares** (3.3): overrated as hell

**Awkward\_King** (2): one of my other least favourite gaga songs damn y'all really chose my least two favourite gaga singles as rate winners huh

**Roxieloxie** (2): why did this win over You and I

> If I wasn't just absent entirely from popheads and wrote these write-ups prior to the day before the reveal, and did this rate, this song would be my 11. 

>It's an inexplainable emotion that I get when I listen to this song. For 5 minutes, I don't exist in my bedroom, house, city or state. It sounds like an over-exaggeration or pretty spin on a song's quality, but there is something genuinely inexplainable and immaculate about this song that transcends a written description. 

>Instead, I want to share the place I arrive when I listen. 

>I am on a bright hill. Completely isolated, but also entirely free. The only forces I feel are the sun, wind, and gravity. The gravity is heavy, heavier than I am used to. Any step is difficult, hard, almost painful. The feeling is so stark in contrast to how the rest of my body feels, the struggle I am facing in moving and acting is completely focused on my own personal experience. The sun is out, the hills, grass, flowers, are all flowing easily in the wind, and the day and enviornment feels perfect, but my path is so insanely difficult. I want to cry and scream, but I can't because it's not something that others can relate or empathize with. I can't go crazy because of the forces and emotions I feel, this gravity, because it's not tangible to some people. I have to be able to mesh with my surroundings, even if this invisible feeling is making the simple task of walking up a hill so difficult. 

>The song has become how I would describe my path with depression, anxiety, and other darker thoughts. It's not an impossible journey, but it's something that I had ignored for so long in my life. It's a strange song, it's a fucking fantastic song. I sincerely hope this song at least makes it to the final day. - /u/wailord_fan

This elimination goes out to /u/plvstvcbvrds and their agenda against this shrieking white woman! I know it's been painful to see it get this high, even to the top 5, but at least she was stopped here, as the last white person of them all. Well done, popheads! We weren't as racist as we tend to be this time!

All that aside, I still gave this an easy 10, because it really is a perfect song to me. I'm a pretentious bitch at heart, and Kate Bush waxing poetically about how she wants to switch places with a man (invoking God and hills and all other kinds of shit) does make me perky, and the 80s synths are a great foundation for her musings. Also, Meg Myers has [a really nice cover of this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7iVWK2W48o)! Go check it out if you feel like supporting a different shrieking white woman.

**agentofscranton** (11): I love this song so much, as hard as it is for me to listen to it without tearing up. I didn't do this rate, but this would've been my 11 then too. Just one of the most beautiful and legendary pieces of music of all time.

**bbfan132** (11): i will always give my 11 to kate bush, especially when i‚Äôm rating one of the best songs of all time

**camerinian** (11): This is a flawless song from a flawless album. I don't even know how someone could dislike this. The scale of this song is something to behold, with all of its high melodrama and the thunderous sound of every single element of this song, like it was recorded in a cathedral. That and the fact that it's aged like fine wine. If someone told me this song was released by an indie artist in 2014 and I didn't know any better, I'd believe them, because everything about this composition is timeless. Kate's delivery is delicate and commanding in equal measure and the massive gothic instrumentation is the perfect complement. This is a top 5 song of all time for me, God bless this

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): THERE IS THUNDER IN OUR HEEEAAAAARTS!!!!!!!!!!! the greatest opening track of all time, the greatest lead single of all time, from the greatest album of all time BY the greatest artist of all time? aaaaah that's history

**InternetDude19** (11): This may be the greatest song ever.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (11): my favorite song of all time

**lIIustration** (11): beautiful. Just beautiful.

**quinnpsych** (11): I seriously can't emphasise how much I love this song. I only first listened to this song in early 2020 (I know.), but it's magical and haunting and the production is amazing, what else can I say?

**runaway3212** (11): My mom is a Kate Bush stan, I guess you could say taste runs in the family.

**sarcasticsobs** (11): very difficult rate, obvious since it‚Äôs the ‚Äúwinners‚Äù rate, but i mean c‚Äômon. look at the flair. kate bush is my mom

**vayyiqra** (11): This is my favourite song of all time and I can't even put into words what it means to me so I'm just going to give it an 11 and let it speak for itself

**WeastofEden44** (11): By far one of my fav songs of all-time, period. Kate Bush could WASH any of the flops and fads we talk about üíÖ

**welcometoNY** (11): nothing on this earth compares to the rush of serotonin i get when that synth comes in. basically the greatest pop song ever made. easiest 11 of my life.

**worlds-okayest666** (11): perfect song in every way. period. i can‚Äôt sing this song‚Äôs praises enough LMAO i love it so much, it‚Äôs such a masterpiece. really really hoping y‚Äôall don‚Äôt do it dirty

**yatcho** (11): The best song of all time, sorry I don't make the rules

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): This is just such a cathartic song and I would absolutely not be mad if this won.

**slimboyfriend** (9.9): I wonder if Kate Bush knows she‚Äôs an icon among Gen Z/Millennials online

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): she's gonna get robbed lmao

**bigbigbee** (9): What a song!! A lot of artists have used this sound lately, and when I was listening through the playlist for the first time, I assumed that this was a track released in the past few years until I heard her amazing vocals come in. Kate Bush did it first!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I hate Stan Twitter so much. Everytime I listen to this song, I think of the Super Bass remix.

**nooodisaster** (9): Kate Bush: "I was trying to say that, really, a man and a woman can‚Äôt understand each other, because we are a man and a woman."

**starlitsuns** (9): I keep exposing myself during this rate but I haven‚Äôt listened to any Kate Bush either. I really like the production, it reminds me of a 1980s new wave song without the added synthpop to it.

**zadooi** (9): Cloudbusting outsold tbh.

**seanderlust** (8.9): i don't know much about her, but i feel like the eighties were not ready for kate bush

**MelodramaticLemonade** (8.5): I will fight to my grave that while this is still a good song, Hounds of Love and The Big Sky are infinitely better than it

**aresthormars** (8): I love the galloping drums like it really showcases she is running up that hill.

**Frelock\_** (8): Good lyrics, interesting music & bonus point for message.

**kirby31200** (8): I am shocked this is from 1985. If I didn't have context, I would've assumed it to be from the past decade.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I revisited the album recently and while I get why it won (it's the closest thing to a "bop"), it's far from my favorite. I would've preferred some songs on The Ninth Wave (esp. And Dream of Sheep, The Morning Fog) or even Cloudbusting tbh.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): So now I finally have context for all of the memes my Kate Bush loving mutuals post on tumblr, great! This is a cool idea for a song and it sounds pretty but I wish it had more of a build/climax, for a song about running up a hill it‚Äôs pretty flat. Maybe that‚Äôs the point and I‚Äôm just stupid though.

**ktajlili** (7): maybe this will grow on me, but for now, it's just okay?

**bespectacIed** (6): Okay song, Hounds of Love is so much better imo. We could've been rating Paper Bag right now, the winner of the winners rate

**ManofOranges** (6): I'm sorry Kate Bush stans I really want to be able to see that magic in this song that the rest of y'all see because I see so much reverence for this song (and many other of her songs from Hounds of Love) but it's just not for me!

**moonagenightmares** (6): 70s kate bush >>>>> 80s kate bush

**CarlieScion** (5): just smile and nod

**hikkaru** (5): another returnee grab bag rate another expose of my tastelessness in regards to art pop and classics

**PuggleMaster** (5): The entire time this song was playing all i could think was how i'd rather be listening to the next song in the playlist....

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): im sorry i just think kate bush‚Äôs voice is insufferable and ruins any good qualities this song may have

**Roxieloxie** (4): one of my friends is always talking about how kate bush is taking over his life and im not getting it

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): what have i told y'all about this lady and how much i don't like her music. this song is just another example of why i don't like her music. i feel like i'm being yelled at by a theater kid who thinks they are just killing it and won't stop doing the rachel berry lip wobble

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): this song smells like stale air and plastic covered furniture

**ImADudeDuh** (1): why is she running? Like damn, god will still be there if you just walk.

letsallpoo: So for those unaware, everyone who participated in this rate was also asked to rate two songs that were in the previous winners rate, and notched another rate win since then. The catch was that they could only give an 11 and a 0! I figured that we would close off on the white people in this rate with two more cases of white excellence. And here's the results!

> What's left to say about this classic that hasn't already been said? From the iconic, show-stopping horn line that signaled that Beyonc√© did NOT come to play with her solo material, to the music video, Beyonc√©'s commanding vocals, Jay-Z's feature and everything in between, this is undoubtedly a modern classic in every sense of the word. This song proved Beyonc√©'s sheer star power and has gone on to be a staple in her discography and tours. Everything about it just screams summer anthem, it isn't hard to see why it originally won the songs of the summer rate. - /u/skargardin

>Still Beyonc√©'s signature song after all these years and for a good reason. The hook sample, the bridge, everything just works. May be an unpopular opinion but I love the 2014 Remix so much too. - /u/Leixander

---

This song literally ended careers, and we have no choice but to stan. Released in 2003 as her proper debut as a soloist, "Crazy In Love" stomped its way up the charts and immediately established Beyonce as a force all on her own. (Well, aside from Jay-Z's verse, which was allegedly cooked up in 10 minutes on the spot.) It's crazy to think that before this, the concept of a solo Beyonce wasn't [an obvious sell](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/arts/music-the-solo-beyonce-she-s-no-ashanti.html) to much of the world ‚Äî Kelly Rowland was the first one to get a big hit, with her feature on "Dilemma". But Beyonce strut her way to the front of the pack, with those tooting trumpets heralding her arrival.

"Crazy In Love" won the Billboard Song of the Summers rate, and this is my preferred kind of summer song: effortlessly fun, and manic in all the right spots. Its fiery hot energy is downright infectious, perfect for jiggling your ass around as a fire hydrant explodes behind you. Those weird /r/music people would probably be shook to see us get Beyonce this high, and I couldn't be happier about it!

**anothertown** (10): If you rate this low then you‚Äôre a fed

**aresthormars** (10): When the trumpet hits you know that the Queen Bee is in the house!

**bbfan132** (10): yes she‚Äôs singing off the beat during the chorus but that lowkey makes this better imo

**CarlieScion** (10): middle school bop

**cocosairdep** (10): This, together with Toxic, is te best pop song of the early 2000s.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I mean, duh. I don't know if it's top 5 Beyonc√© tracks, but I can see the appeal.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): WHAT a "debut" single, honestly.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic, those trumpets are so iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/justdance/images/1/15/Crazyinlove_gm_1.gif

**J\_Toe** (10): still annoyed this video isn't accessible on youtube in Australia. I have to watch it on vimeo smh

**joshually** (10): so iconic. The perfect way to mark your solo debut

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): honestly this is one of those songs you just have to sing along to

**moooo566** (10): beyonce peaked here

**mysario** (10): peak artistry before they took (more of) the money

**pat-rickstar** (10): Still holds up, one of her best singles ever

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): you love to hate her, popheads but even you have to admit that this song is amazing. it's a classic for a reason, and we all spent way too many hours trying to learn the uh oh dance with oprah.

**PuggleMaster** (10): [What a song to kickstart your solo career on. This is the reason Beyonce is a legend.](https://youtu.be/7RPFuJWc-B4?t=16)

**raicicle** (10): a cultural reset but actually

**ReallyCreative** (10): holding out hope this doesn't get robbed... the absolute RESET of my brain chemistry when those trumpets come on

**Roxieloxie** (10): Isnt it crazy how the only line that dates this is the line about paging

**runaway3212** (10): This song got me into both rap en Beyonce

**starlitsuns** (10): I feel bad for Feeling Myself not gaining redemption in the Redemption Rate, so here‚Äôs to Queen Bey potentially winning this rate.

**succulentils** (10): Never really noticed the harmony that comes in towards the end of the chorus

**twat\_brained** (10): less Single Ladies and Run The World, this is the definitive Beyonc√© lead single. Also helps this is one of Jay's best verses, it's almost enough to make me overlook the perturbing factor of their age gap

**wavingwolves** (10): ugh!!!!!! so GOOD

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): As soon as the music starts I get ready to turn it. the. fuck. up!

**fadedblue09** (9.5): There is something here that holds me back from giving this a 10 (and no, it's not Jay-Z), but otherwise deserves to place high in the rate.

**kirby31200** (9.5): Chinchilla fur? Don't tell PETA

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): An almost perfect song

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Whoever is giving this classic less than 8 is ugly. Sorry, I don't make the rules bestie! üíã

**jasannn** (9): One hell of a solo debut.

**lIIustration** (9): Too loud at times, but just a great song that always gets me feeling pumped.

**skargardin** (9): classic

**Stryxen** (9): this makes me go feral idk why

**waluigiest** (9): a perfect song. The opener of every bey concert for centuries to come. The vocals are unhinged. If only it were mixed well......

**WeastofEden44** (9): "It was iconic, it was iconic"

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): deja vu outsold

**engifear** (8.7): Maybe it's the nostalgia for my childhood, but this song is a jam.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.7): When I did my tragically ignored [Playlist for the End of the World thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/gwni9a/a_playlist_for_the_end_of_the_world_what_would/) and asked people what songs they would save if humanity was about to be destroyed, like three different people said this song because it‚Äôs just that damn good. It loses some points for me because the go-go influenced production (hi Amerie) and some of the lyrics are very clearly dated, but you can‚Äôt keep a good song down! I also love the version from the *Fifty Shades* films, it‚Äôs always cool when a song can work equally well as both an uptempo dance jam and a searing ballad.

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**camerinian** (8.5): playing this song through my podcast app so I can hit +30 on Jay Z's verse

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8.5): iconic but not my favorite Beyonc√© song

**shhhneak** (8.5): My goal is to have as ass so big it vibrates like a door spring stopper when I stomp to this intro.

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Idk if its her vocals, the mixing or both but something feels off

**InfernalSolstice** (8): jay kinda drags it down but solo bey would be an easy 10

**moonagenightmares** (8): jay-z ruins it

**steelstepladder** (8): Lemonade era Bey towers over all other eras of Bey don't @ me

**suhonyu** (8): so much nostalgia with this one, my cousins and I performed a whole dance piece to this sawng

**vayyiqra** (8): The horn riff is so catchy we can ignore how weak the verses are

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7.5): That slightly off beat and Jay Z's verse kill the song, but otherwise it's such a glorious hook

**seanderlust** (7.3): okay...beyhive, don't @ me. this is a good song. it's not a great beyonce song, it's just the first beyonce song. that said, the 50 shades version slaps hard.

**akanewasright** (7): The chorus drives me a little crazy, but this song is rightfully iconic.

**Frelock\_** (7): Fun dance tune.

**joeeswift** (7): the homecoming version>>

**quinnpsych** (7): Good strutting song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): if Beyonc√© can just kick open a fire hydrant she has the strength of multiple fireman

**zadooi** (7): Never understood the amount of praise this song gets. It's alright, but nothing too special.

# Bitter Ashanti Stans

**plastichaxan** (6.8): It feels wrong to give Beyonc√© less than seven but this song is...not my favorite

**fxsparrow** (6): I find this song chaotic and while the horn riffs are good they are all over the place.Thats why I prefer the remix made for 50 shades, it's miles better.

**hikkaru** (6): i know it's iconique but tbh not one of my fave bey songs

**ManofOranges** (6): I know a lot of people love this song a lot but it's not even close to being my favorite anything. People especially love to talk about the trumpets but, in my opinion, they're the worst part of this song by a mile

**bulforster** (4.8): (#29) Iconic debut single but it's a bit messy (especially Jay-Z's feature) and not as dynamic as it could be, Bey has gone on to do much better.

# not the taylor username üò≠

**welcometoNY** (1): such an annoying song, the first in a slew of unnecessary jay-z features and the chorus is unbelievably grating

> It's not a surprise that How Will I Know not only won the 80s Dancepop Debuts rate, but also scored the highest average in popheads rate history! Seeing How Will I Know's average just go up and up with every 11 it received was so exciting to see, and honestly, it makes sense. What's not to love about the song? It's a great synthpop jam from a legendary artist with extremely great vocals and one of the world's first introductions to the one and only Whitney Houston. While it won't be my 11, I'm definitely going to be rooting for this song to do well because it's super catchy and just pure fun! - /u/ElectricBoogaloo41

---

And the highest rated song of all time goes down! Whitney's formula for having questionable albums with a few incredible singles doesn't quite work when she has only the singles in the rate, but "How Will I Know" still easy rose above the chaff and snagged a whole lot of perfect marks. It might not be her biggest hit, but it's still an undeniable jam and a half, and a great representation of the 80s dancepop bops that informed its original rate.

"How Will I Know" was initially written for Janet Jackson, who passed on it, then was shifted over to Whitney's camp who was in search of a solid dance track as they readied her debut album. And what a hit it turned out to be! As Whitney's second #1, and her first that wasn't a ballad, it established her voice as prime not only for the slow shit, but also perfect for the upbeat boppity bops. She sings, [as Stereogum put it](https://www.stereogum.com/2107774/the-number-ones-whitney-houstons-how-will-i-know/columns/the-number-ones/), like she already knows, and the uncertainty in the title never comes through in the song, which is forceful and confident. Whitney might not have taken the crown this time, but watch out for another one of her dance tracks in the Winners Rate III!

**shhhneak** (11): my favourite song ever made. It‚Äôs in my happiest memories.
[/r/popheads/comments/k3f0ls/the_winners_rate_ii_day_3_running_up_that_top_10/ge30c6z/]

=====

letsallpoo: # Will Always Love Her

**1998tweety** (10): Absolutely iconic, gonna be sad to see our highest rated song of all time get robbed here

**bbfan132** (10): deserves a 10+ average again

**bespectacIed** (10): One of my favorite rates ever. Four legendary pop albums from a decade that we all demand our modern pop girls to be inspired of, then this sub had the audacity for the low turnout!!!! Can't wait for Whitney to snatch her own record average on the new 80s rate

**CarlieScion** (10): how can u not love this!!!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): how iconic would it be for this to get over a 10 average AGAIN

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Fucking classic. Highest ever average better come through.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I wonder how the recent "cancellation" of Manila Luzon will affect the scores for this.

**fadedblue09** (10): Can't wait for Whitney Houston to sweep both of this month's rates!

**hunnybee12** (10): one of the greatest songs recorded in human history yes

**ignitethephoenix** (10): an underrated song in her discog, deserved to have a 10+ score in the first rate (watch as it barely has over 8 this time because people are tasteless)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the highest rated song ever going out at #12‚Ä¶.. tragic.

**InternetDude19** (10): This is why I love pop music.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): Instant classic from the first notes, plus how iconic would it be if this got another blowout win

**joshually** (10): pop 80s perfection

**ManofOranges** (10): Pure 80s euphoria at its best. Nobody did it or ever will do it like Whitney did.

**nootnoot781** (10): any other score (bar an 11) is a choice

**pat-rickstar** (10): Did somebody say pop perfection?

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): a classic. a bop. a song of the ages. it's both cleaning music and drunk music, which is a rare crossover. i want to put on a jean jacket and some too tight leather pants and a red lip and go dancing with my baby.

**PuggleMaster** (10): MISS WHITNEY! SHE IS SUCH A LEGEND! THIS SONG IS SO ICONIC I WOULDN'T BE MAD IF IT WON!

**runaway3212** (10): Sorry this isn't an 11 miss Houston, forgive me plz.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): don‚Äôt understand why weddings only play ‚Äúi wanna dance with somebody (who loves me)‚Äù, these 2 songs should come in a pair

**seanderlust** (10): transcendent

**selegend** (10): this deserves to win honestly

**skargardin** (10): please discard any ballot who gives this less than a ten thank you

**SmileAndTears** (10): This song just makes me happy. Whitney had that capacity to infuse a song with happiness even when the lyrics were teeny and dumb as hell.

**suhonyu** (10): my mom was stanned her so hard, so naturally I adore her so much

**TiltControls** (10): I hope the highest average doesn't cause people to underrate this. It's one of the best pop songs of all time and deserves respect

**waluigiest** (10): I will never be over how perfect this song is

**wavingwolves** (10): yeah this is great

**welcometoNY** (10): this song obviously isn't underrated in the traditional sense, but i feel like it does get overshadowed by I Will Always Love You despite being miles better

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): the drama!

**jsonphile** (9.5): not sure it deserves to be the highest rated song by popheads ever, but it is a total bop

**mysario** (9.5): saxy

**Stryxen** (9.5): every part of this song is the best part

**aresthormars** (9): Whitney is such a queen for dance 80s songs! "Don't trust your feelings, love can be deceiving" those lines are solid advice.

**bigbigbee** (9): So youthful and beautiful and lovely. I miss having a crush.

**Frelock\_** (9): Classic 80s from an icon of the era.

**WeastofEden44** (9): Better than I Wanna Dance With Somebody I said what I said

**twat\_brained** (8.7): When you've heard "I Wanna Dance With Somebody" no other Whitney song compares. "I Will Always Love You" is a Dolly song so don't try that with me

**bulforster** (8.4): (#11) Whitney has a real claim to being the best singles artist of all time.

**nooodisaster** (8): The cover of this album was so boring that for years I just assumed there couldn't be a banger on here and yet.. here we are.

**steelstepladder** (8): It's really good but a tad overrated

**vayyiqra** (8): :kimbryell2:

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): the chorus is literally just that one game you play with flower petals

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I‚Äôm grading on a curve here and if we‚Äôre being honest I don‚Äôt really enjoy this song compared to most of the songs here. It‚Äôs good, yes, but it‚Äôs not the Whitney song I reach for when I have an itch I need to scratch.

# Even the sole negative comment praises her! Whitney's power!

**moonagenightmares** (1): they really gave her the lamest songs expecting her voice to hard carry

> Holy Gay Anthem Batman! 

> Juice has become a quintessential gay anthem, and a gay anthem that is adored beyond the confines of /r/popheads. For once, Popheads was able to get behind the star-power of Lizzo early on in her career, and the adoration of her work and singles seemed to resonate beyond our tiny shithole on the Internet. Juice itself didn't become a massive hit, but it broke into the top 100, and is quite recognizable among the gays and straights alike. 

> Juice is just so well loved across the board. It was coupled with a strong music video, great live performances, and a star who is so bubbly and nearly-impossible to hate, it's no wonder Lizzo has become a mainstay in the hearts of so many of us. 

> Juice was also a shoe-in for the top for a majority of its original rate. Cruel Summer definitely tried it, but Juice took the lead about halfway through, and it never got close again. A serving of juice is typically recommended to be on the smaller end, lots of sugar, and its benefits are typically outweighed by the negatives, but this Juice is made up of pure charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent, and all doctors recommend a 2 liter of it a day to keep the homophobes away. - /u/wailord_fan

---

And so the /r/popheads moderation team defeats the /r/popheadscirclejerk once and for all. "Juice" was in the lead for the vast majority of the voting period, yet in the final days its lead shrank and shrank until even an errant 7 was suddenly making it flip back and forth with Janelle. in the end, our beloved moderator pulled through, but not without a hard-fought battle.

Lizzo won her rate against Taylor, Ariana, and Billie in the most participated rate of all time, featuring their 2019 year-defining albums. "Juice" might not've been the hit it deserved to be, but ever since those 80s-inspired synths drifted into our ears in early January, we were hooked. (Like, can you imagine if "Cruel Summer" were in this rate instead? The horror.) The fact that she made it this far, and was in first for a solid part of the voting, is proof that we still consider "Juice" to be a whole-ass bop. I'm proud of the sub for rallying behind Lizzo, who is in so many ways not your typical image of a pop music figure, yet she is one regardless. Even though 2020 has been a quiet year for her, I'm still confident that her talent and penchant for creating incredible bops will further endear us as her career progresses.

**AtomicViolet** (11): Stream "Juice" but in all seriousness this is gonna be one of those songs in 20 years we'll be wondering how this wasn't a smash hit, if we make it that far

> This song was fairly formative to me. when it came out, I had recently accepted that I was bisexual, and also very recently started digging into pop music. This song, and its video is just so unabashedly queer. Prince's influence on Janelle also shines through, with the funky bass and a guitar line that rivals the opening to Kiss. This song, like much of Janelle's discography, is ultimately about being oneself, and not letting any authority get in the way of that. It is one of the best pop songs of the past few years. - /u/static_int_husp

---

Who else could it be? Janelle Mon√°e, as you know, is not only an esteemed singer, actress, and record producer. She is also a moderator of this little subreddit called /r/popheads; she was initially added as a joke until she suddenly accepted the request, and has since poked her head in when she's felt like it. Will she poke her head in for this one too? I sure hope so, but I do think she'd be understandably confused about what all this means. If you do end up reading this Janelle, it just means (once again) that we love you! We love you a lot! We love you even more than we love Kate Bush and two ABBA songs and Years & Years (it's okay if you don't know who they are ‚Äî most people don't)! 

"Make Me Feel" won its rate against Mitski and Kacey, which were basically the three main critic girls of 2018. It was a stacked rate despite the lack of actual hits present, and in this rate it stomped its way into the top 10 and inched slowly and slowly to the #1 spot, where it finally landed. It was always going to do well ‚Äî I mean, it's Janelle ‚Äî and even with fellow moderator /u/fishingfor8 deciding to smack her with a 0, it notched a comfortable lead over Lizzo in the end.

The song is fluid sexuality personified, as Janelle coos about how she's merely attracted to the feeling these people imbue in her rather than anything specific physically. It's like if you threw Prince's "Kiss" and Little Mix's "Move" in a large hadron collider, and when smashed together it resulted in this smooth little bop that erupts in the bridge. This ramp-up in intensity is matched by her orgasmic moans, until it all tumbles down back into its mellow seductive phase. It's a masterclass in displaying carnal desire and the ebb and flow in passion that comes with a great, long sex session, and it's a great representation of how horny we are as a community that we all liked this as much as we did. Congratulations to Janelle for this seminal victory in our little corner of the internet, and thank you all for sticking along for the journey!

**aresthormars** (10): I love the Prince influence. And Prince has a hand in production so for sure this is Prince approved.

**bespectacIed** (10): Loved the npr rate so much. Probably the rate that had the closest level of quality between the albums. Make Me Feel deserved an 11.000 average, this song lights up fireworks inside my brain

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i think of her grammy performance of this like once a day minimum

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Do I have to explain?

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I remember being so hyped for the release, especially with how much I loved Electric Lady and ArchAndroid. Gosh, the day when she released this song is so iconic. Popheads was fucking floored by this bop. I just wish this song was much more popular in the charts, but at least we got that iconic Grammys performance! /u/JanelleMonae we luv you kween!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): In the words of the great princesscracker: Shea wins.

**frogaranaman** (10): hi mod

**ignitethephoenix** (10): perfection

**ImADudeDuh** (10): If i wasn‚Äôt on the M11 Channel Theme train, this probably would be my 11.

**kirby31200** (10): This song might be perfect

**ManofOranges** (10): Now THIS is a winner right here. Janelle Monae is doing it right here right now. Out of all the songs in this rate, this is another one that I wouldn't mind winning because it's just oh so good. From that NPR Rate with so many good songs and also Mitski's songs, this was always the most deserving winner and I hope it gets paid more than dust here

**mysario** (10): this is Prince-lite

**pat-rickstar** (10): This makes me feel so powerful and sexy

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song goes slap the fuck off, it's gay as hell, and the video made me at least five percent gayer than i already was. janelle in this video made me realize the limit to my gayness does not exist, ok

**PuggleMaster** (10): /u/janellemonae you snapped so hard on this song. I'm so proud to have picked this song as my 11 in it's original rate. Dirty Computer really was the best album of 2018 (She was robbed at the grammys).

**quinnpsych** (10): Honestly such a BOP

**racloves** (10): this was the first Janelle song I heard and fell in love instantly

**Roxieloxie** (10): Bisexual Anthem of the century

**runaway3212** (10): Our secret mod with an eternal bop

**selegend** (10): this has gotten even better with time

**skargardin** (10): mother

**static\_int\_husp** (10): pansexual anthem

**steelstepladder** (10): The closest we will ever get to new Prince :/

**Stryxen** (10): she really released the best two songs (this+Django Jane) of the decade at the same time

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): r/popheads‚Äô mod snapped!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): can janelle do the rate

**TiltControls** (10): if we let this win will Janelle pay us a visit again?

**twat\_brained** (10): I think it'll be either this or a Mariah song that wins. Also, I suggest we all start calling Janelle "Princess" since she's basically already succeeded him.

**urlocalcracchead** (10): Another strong contender for the eleven

**vayyiqra** (10): The best Prince song that's not by Prince ever

**waluigiest** (10): the beat is wet beyond belief!!!!

**seanderlust** (9.7): TIL julia michaels did backing vocals and prince played the synth!

**bulforster** (9.6): (#5) Our mod did that!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.6): bi rights

**1998tweety** (9.5): iconic bop

**jsonphile** (9.5): no one will ever be Prince, a one of a kind performer. But Janelle is probably the closest we‚Äôll get, and I am okay with that.

**nooodisaster** (9.5): "Hi R slash popheads! It's your maybe secret mod, Janelle Monae. I released my masterpiece Dirty Computer AND smash single Make Me Feel. If you rate it less than a 9, you're tasteless."

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): This sounds like a future classic

**WeastofEden44** (9.4): This is her Boom Clap, as in the one song in her actual discography that locals may know, and I'm at peace with that.

**addupten** (9): she very much did that

**akanewasright** (9): Queen Janelle

**bbfan132** (9): honestly i overplayed this and it‚Äôs grown off me a bit but it‚Äôs still a bop

**camerinian** (9): this isn‚Äôt even top 5 songs on Dirty Computer, and yet it was still my most listened to song in 2018 somehow

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Still thinking about how *Antebellum (2020)* made me feel, which was frustrated.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): again I'm a sucker for a baseline

**raicicle** (9): i wouldn‚Äôt call it janelle‚Äôs magnum opus but its impressive that even a song as obviously a commercial play like this ends up being this good, the spirit of prince does flow through her

**succulentils** (9): I strongly believe that Shea should not have done the robot while lip syncing to this, since Janelle Monae said that with Dirty Computer she was no longer hiding behind her android Cindy character

**suhonyu** (9): if this would pink this woulda been higher

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): how many times have we all collectively said this song is good now like... we know

**zadooi** (9): Invented being bisexual.

**CarlieScion** (8): sexy, but the high to low part of the pre-chorus makes me wanna die

**fadedblue09** (8): I really wished I liked Dirty Computer more but otherwise this is a slick, well-produced bop.

**Frelock\_** (8): I like the way this makes me feel

**joshually** (8): love this prince rip off!!!

**starlitsuns** (8): Another artist I haven‚Äôt listened to, I really need to get into Janelle‚Äôs discography.

**wavingwolves** (8): damn this is a riot of a song

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): Screwed is still so much better than this and I'm still upset that this beat out High Horse and Nobody. It's a good song but it SCREWED Screwed!!!

**welcometoNY** (7.5): i finally got the hype for this song after dancing to it. it's still average for just a casual listen, but there are very few songs that lend themselves to movement quite as well as this song does.

**sandyfishnets** (7): I can imagine Prince singing this song

**moonagenightmares** (5.8): can‚Äôt stand the tongue popping sorry janelle love your voice tho

# What are you gonna do with that big zero? Gonna hit me? Better make it count. Better make it hurt. Better kill me in one shot.

**fishingfor8** (0): this beat is very annoying and there's maybe one vocal melody I like.

TiltControls: The [Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=28287180) and [Leaderboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) are updated! But first off...

**Congrats to Janelle!!!!**
 
Make Me Feel is now the 3rd song to have 2+ wins, after Toxic and Bad Romance! Unlike the other two songs though, it's the only one to get both wins its first 2 rates (instead of taking 3)!


**Songs**

- Dancing On My Own and We Belong Together both end up on the 'Most Rated' leaderboard now with 4 rates a piece. Still far from the current leader, but I think it's time they get a bit of rest (as someone who has given DOMO 4 11's)

- White people getting their revenge today: Running Up That Hill now has the #8 spot for most 11's from all rates pushing down songs from Gaga, Whitney, and more Gaga

- Not listed, but Closer is our first song to win songeniality 2 times!!! We love our subreddit visiting legends!! Closer for AS4!!

**Artists**

- With her win today, Janelle enters the top 20 for highest scoring artists at #19! We love to see some mod representation!!!

- Carole King falls out of the top 10 score leaderboard to #11 allowing ABBA to take over. Not all is lost though, since she managed to keep her zeroless streak going to 13 songs!

- Lady Gaga overtakes Madonna for #5 of most songs rated thanks to her double appearance in this rate

- For most rate appearances we have a lot of new artists enter the top 10 at 13 rates including Kanye West, The Weeknd, Kesha, and Lady Gaga. Also appearing, even though we've never done any of his albums, Jay-Z has been in 13 rates with 20 songs? Black Album rate when??

**Rates**

- This rate now holds the #3 spot for most participants, after the 2019 Main Pop Girl and the K-pop Girl Group Singles rates

- This rate, the one filled with quality songs voted in by us, now has the top spot of most songs with a 0 attached, at 68%. The rate also shows up on the leaderboards for percent of elevens given out (#4) and percent of songs with an 11 (#4)

Also huge thanks to u/letsallpoo and /u/rickikardashian for a great rate and some of the best plug videos I have ever seen! All the work put in on this rate was fantastic and on another level!

~~though for the sake of my mental health I'm gonna pretend Mitski won miss Songeniality~~
