DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: I am only keeping this long-ass custom flair because of its nostalgic value and I think some of the OG users can still identify me with this flair. But I honestly wanna change it because it's so 2018 Doc and I am obviously a much different Doc now. 

The only thing that is keeping me from changing it is that I still want to be identified as *that* Spider-Man stan in Popheads. (Yes, I am still that loser who still stans the MCU lmaooo) That and I have no idea how to select multiple flairs here. I really want to have Taylor x Twice x Blackpink flairs now, guys. :(((

> In a stacked rate full of songs that brought back some pretty fun childhood memories, there were a few albums that reminded us of why maybe it's better for the past to stay in the past. As seen by the ranking Kiss and Tell illustrated this best. Freeways and I thought this was arguably the weakest choice out of all the songs to win, but you know what sometimes you end up with a solid, inoffensive bop taking first place and you just have to accept that. - /u/Roxieloxie 

 > When you need a dose of nostalgia-infused serotonin, old Disney Channel is usually the way to go. 7 Things and Burnin' Up almost won, but popheads decided Naturally was their best go-to song for childhood memories. Roxie and I don't fully agree, but..everything comes naturally we suppose. - /u/followingfreeways

Poor Selena. It was obvious she was never going to get very high, but I didn't really think she'd be *all* the way at the bottom. I was certain that spot was reserved for one of the mediocre white men in this rate! But I suppose /r/popheads is full of surprises.

"Naturally" was not Selena (Gomez & The Scene)'s debut, but it was arguably her (their?) first to make waves outside of the Disneysphere that she had been incubated in. I remember all the way back in 2009 when this was getting some critical attention — I think Billboard even listed this as one of the top 20 songs of the year or something. In retrospect it was probably a warning of how Selena would continue to receive a surprising amount of critical accolades well into her career, but at the time it just felt like an appropriate evaluation of a solid pop tune. Who can resist that pulsating club-lite beat supporting Selena's bubbly little voice and she rings out the most PG lyrics ever? If you told me this was a Eurodance single that never charted on the Hot 100 I'd probably believe you, and I'd probably still bop along.

This song comes from a rate of the Disney Channel golden era, where she somehow beat out Demi Lovato, Miley Cyrus, and the Jonas Brothers despite having a...significantly worse album that overall performed way worse than everyone else's. I guess this makes her the Whitey Houston of the Disney rates? My car's audio system [insists that she's Dionne Warwick](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/532698515957350410/777307438315339806/image0.jpg?width=878&height=1171), so I guess that's not too far off.

letsallpoo: # /u/selegend and his friends

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**fadedblue09** (10): Somehow this Hollywood Records bop managed to age better than most of The Fame, Animal, and most pop girl releases in 2009-10. Y’all can complain about her longevity however you want, but sometimes she just gets the good songs.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a fucking bop idc idc idc idc y’all can stay hating on selena the second she breathes.

**intheaftermath** (10): fun fact! this song, for some reason, is played all the time at FIRST Robotics competitions

**jasannn** (10): One of her best songs tbh.

**mysario** (10): I miss peak Selena

**runaway3212** (10): Selena makes a valid argument for why she does deserve a music career.

**selegend** (10): that chorus is godly

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i can hear god

**twat\_brained** (10): Selena's best song and she was

**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): Catchy, melodic, perfect bubblegum

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i love how literally nothing else on kiss & tell sounds like this at all. like there’s one or two more electropop-ish songs but that’s it LMAO

**bespectacIed** (9): Electropop perfection. Idgaf, selena was right 'baby' does have 4 syllables

**camerinian** (9): who the fuck even are The Scene, and how did Selena's music magically stop being good when they left? Are they wizards?

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): whit* st*n twitter gays: iT c*Ms nAtUraLly tO mE 💦👅

**hikkaru** (9): the way this is still one of her best songs... YOU ARE THE THUNDERRR AND I AM THE LIIIGHTNIIIING

**hunnybee12** (9): this is a nostalgia score kiss and tell was one of the first (and only) cds i ever bought

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): I remember seeing the MV on disney channel

**plastichaxan** (9): bop one of her best

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): still maybe the best song of Selena’s entire career, and also maybe the best single of that whole era of Disney star singles

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Of Selena’s hits with The Scene this isn’t my favorite but it’s still a pretty good song. I don’t think anyone expected a teenybopper pop star like Selena Gomez to release such a simmering, surprisingly sophisticated electro pop song but she really did that! Also I still really want the dress that she wears in the video, I tried looking it up on a bunch of blogs and I can’t find it anywhere so it must have been custom and I’m forever sad. I don’t even wear dresses but she looks so cute in it.

**pat-rickstar** (8.3): Thunder and lightning, it's getting exciting (the lyrics in the chorus reminds me of this Eurovision song by Sergey Lazarev - Eurovision rate when?)

**anothertown** (8): first thing a girl did was a bop!

**AtomicViolet** (8): Never heard this before and expected it to be meh based on the Selena I've heard before but came out pleasantly surprised

**wavingwolves** (8): ok yeah this is one of selena's best songs

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): I miss The Scene, I wonder what they're up to now

**akanewasright** (7.5): Selena Gomez always sounds best when she’s singing over a dance beat. This song basically defined her entire career as a singer (or at least within this band), and thank god it did, or we wouldn’t have gotten Rock God, or Off The Chain or all of When The Sun Goes Down.

**PuggleMaster** (7.5): Why doesn't this sound as good as i remember it sounding :uhh:. It sounds very muffled compared to every song on this rate (except that Carole song).

**WeastofEden44** (7.2): Tbh I remembered it being better

**kirby31200** (7): Middle school bop

**racloves** (7): the scene>solo Selena

**waluigiest** (7): it’s fine. But I’m still mad that it won - their album was far weaker than the other 3, and Demi and JB had stronger songs for the win too. Selenators win again :-(

**jsonphile** (6.5): haven’t heard this song in years, but it’s better than I remembered. Still nothing amazing though

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): who’s the man saying yeah in the background

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): not as good as 8 year old me remembered it being

**bbfan132** (6): hit the lights and a year without rain outsold

**skargardin** (6): it's ok

# /u/RoxieLoxie and her friends

**SmileAndTears** (6): Nope

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Selena Gomez used to make mediocre Disney music and now she’s great, and Demi Lovato used to make great Disney music and now she’s mediocre

**vayyiqra** (6): Love Selena but this is far from her best song with The Scene (that would be Love You Like a Love Song) but it's okay

**Frelock\_** (5): Reminds me of the cassettes my parents would play to improve my self-esteem and remind me to not do drugs.

**ManofOranges** (5): I honestly can't believe this song actually won its rate. Well... yes I can but that doesn't make it any less unbelievable. This song is ok to me, but when it's surrounded by so many other good songs that actually deserved their win, it kind of pales in comparison.

**TiltControls** (5): "When we collide sparks fly" can we swap Miranda into this rate

**seanderlust** (4.5): i haven't seen it so i don't know, but why do I feel like the music video for this song was just a slideshow of selena gomez pictures made in windows movie maker

**CrimsonROSET** (4): That rate was rough.

**sarcasticsobs** (4): sure. Chorus is kinda catchy though

**Stryxen** (4): natura11y jk this is not good

**welcometoNY** (4): a cute bop, definitely one of selena's more tolerable songs, but not really worthy of rate winner status

**lIIustration** (3): very artificial

**cloudbustingmp3** (2.1): i see why she considers revival her debut

**CarlieScion** (2): this is terrible. in the literal sense.

**ElizabethDDoS** (2): Well, this is na2rally bland as fuck.

**bulforster** (1.6): (#45) Go girl give us nothing! I feel like she doesn’t use more than like, three notes in this whole song...

**aresthormars** (1): Not a fan of this song. The visuals of the song look like the visuals of We Are Never Ever Going Back Together of 1989 Tour.

**cremeebrulee** (1): sorry i genuinely hate this song

**kappyko** (1): this sounds like farts

**steelstepladder** (1): This stands out like a sore thumb among songs like Running Up That Hill and Your Best American Girl

**frogaranaman** (0): [Roxie asked me to](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/j3ws5v/the_popheads_winners_rate_ii_electric_poogaloo/g7f4b4i/)

**nooodisaster** (0): I couldn't get through this more than once. If you rocked to this as a kid, dope. But I gotta say - MITSU DESU... SOCIAL DISTANCE - to this one.

**ReallyCreative** (0): the only rate Selena Gomez should win is the Charity Rate because any score above a 5 is tax deductible. Now that my federally-mandated Selena Gomez drag is out of the way, this song is just way too generic for this rate. This is a kind of song that has been done much better, many times, by many artists.

**Roxieloxie** (0): finally I can give this a 0 and not be questioned of sabotage

**sandyfishnets** (0): no.

> This was a really fun rate to host, just because everyone had such differing opinions. In the end, this came out victorious. I'm not really sure if it was deserved, because Niall definetly had better songs on his album and (in my personal opinion) both Zayn and Harry had way more exciting music. However, I forgive Niall because of his cute Irish accent and smile. Damn him. - /u/CarlieScion

Pop quiz: For the 2017 year-end wrap up here on /r/popheads, whose album had the most requests for writeups? You might be surprised to learn that it was, of all the things that came out that year, Niall's country-ish work, *Flicker*. There's a number of reasonable excuses for this — there's always been a lot of Directioners here, and his album wasn't omega popular enough to be seen as highly sought, so people thought they had a good chance of getting his writeup. But there's also the simple fact that his album was pretty decent, especially coming from an ex-1D member without the biggest expectations for his solo work. Yet his album was quite nice, and it even snagged a decent hit worldwide.

"On The Loose" is not that hit, but it is still the crown jewel of *Flicker*. It's a perfect song for driving with the top down through the city, the cool nighttime air streaming through your hair. The energy may be laidback but it's still propelling you forward, resulting in an irresistable charm as long as you don't pay too much attention to the lyrics. Niall's career may be far from the biggest out of the 1D boys, but he's shown that he's more than capable of churning out a solid tune, and his victory over his bandmates in that rate is proof of that.

=====

letsallpoo: # fLlckers

**aresthormars** (10): One of the best in Flicker!

**cremeebrulee** (10): doesn't deserve to be day 1 but it will be

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this will go out first so I will be giving it my 10 in support because it’s a bop and a good song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://www.tiktok.com/@zillionpat/video/6892176232469826821

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): SMASH

**Mudkip1** (10): pop perfection

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): please at least let this enter day 2

**Roxieloxie** (10): Listen its November aka the biggest moth for a 1D breakdown right behind July, You really think Im gonna give my son a bad review?? Please stream Heartbreak Weather on spotify because even though Niall might've given up on this era I have not

**runaway3212** (10): Stream heartbreak weather, but actually stream flicker since it's superior

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): Horan Dogs Lets Go!

**twat\_brained** (10): Yes, this is "Dreams" meets "What a Feeling" and yes, it's a 10, stop arguing with me. Also, I forget, did Niall perform this on his November 7th livestream?

**wavingwolves** (10): this is GOOD!!!! but it will be the first song out

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): I already know y’all are gonna do my mans really dirty and I’m not happy about it

**CrimsonROSET** (9.7): Nice to Meet Ya deserved.

**suhonyu** (9): loveee this song. the album feels very country but actually tolerable

**1998tweety** (8.5): She's a cute bop

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I like Niall.

**frogaranaman** (8): it’s a cute fun bop

**kirby31200** (8): Breezy pop fun

**lIIustration** (8): like I said with Bastille, good radio/mall music but it’s ultimately radio/mall music

**ManofOranges** (8): While it's maybe not the most stunning song ever, I'm still glad it won its rate over that Zayn song or Sign of the times. However, I'm prepared to see this probably get like 5th to last place in this rate

**pat-rickstar** (8): Honestly didn't expect to like this as much as I do

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): he makes this slightly elevated white boy with a guitar music that always makes me want to go to a hollister or an american eagle and look at their jeans for a bit to feel like i'm in high school again.

**PuggleMaster** (8): I thought his entire album was just boring folk music, but this really surpassed my expectations.

**skargardin** (8): this bops a whole lot harder than I remember it doing!

**worlds-okayest666** (8): honestly better than i was expecting

**WeastofEden44** (7.7): Really cute, fun bop, but cute against gorgeous...

**camerinian** (7.5): this is a cute bop, but, like, winner? ehhhhhh

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): I honestly had no idea this was a Niall song. It's just so anonymous and the kind of song that'd play in a forever 21/american eagle

**TiltControls** (7.5): It's fine.

**WillamThunderfuck** (7.5): I've heard this song on the radio before but I never even realised this is by Niall???

**CarlieScion** (7): its okay. only angel deserved!!!!!

**Frelock\_** (7): Simple background beat makes this an easy toe tapper.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Niall winning the 1D solos rate was a pleasant surprise and I think he deserved it but when you stack this song against everything else here… Day 1? He’s just gotten hotter and hotter though (…musically… …of course…) and I hope we rate *Heartbreak Weather* at some point.

# the misandry

**Ionlywanttheworld** (7): not a fan of a lot of Niall's stuff tbh

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7): This song isn't bad but I'm baffled at how something this mediocre can win a rate

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's good but for some reason it's not super memorable? idk I've listened to it like 7 times, enjoyed it each time, but could not remember anything about it 20 minutes later. also WHAT is he saying like Ariana out-enunciated

**seanderlust** (7): this song feels just a little airtight for my tastes. overall it's a bop though

**starlitsuns** (7): This song has never done much for me, but it’s really nice seeing Niall make the Winners Rate :) I’m not the biggest fan of the route of indie-ish guitar pop that Niall took, so that’s probably contributing to this score.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): this sounds like a country cover of a mid-2010s chill dance song and this is a Good thing

**bbfan132** (6.5): i don’t know how this won a rate lol, it’s decent but it’s nothing special

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): This is cute but it's not a real contender in this rate and everyone knows it

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): it's not great but its also not ass garbage so that makes it better than any other 1d solo song by default

**jasannn** (6): It would have been an 8+ if it was a more instrumental chorus and he wasn't annoyingly repeating "She's going." The album cover also haunts me.

**slimboyfriend** (6): I mean it’s better than I expected and given the competition I’m not surprised it won its first rate

**Stryxen** (6): I thought this was a Walk The Moon song

**vayyiqra** (6): I was ready to not like this based on not caring for 1D but this is ... alright

**moonagenightmares** (5.3): how in the world did this end up here

**joshually** (5): this song isn’t terrible. I mean it’s not great, but it’s not terrible

**anothertown** (4): Lost Made in the AM z-side

**kappyko** (4): girl lol

**nooodisaster** (4): I think we need to have the conversation that some rates just have a lower ceiling than others.

**steelstepladder** (4): lmao this is gonna get eaten alive

**sarcasticsobs** (3): listened to this 4 times and still barely remember it

**selegend** (3): alright lol

**useless-sheep** (3): what rate did this win.... how is niall even in this rate

**mysario** (2): this song had like the 2nd lowest score a winner has ever gotten which says volumes about the quality of the rate it came from I think

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): i am so tired of hearing this song every single day at work its not even that good.

**welcometoNY** (2): songs that talk about women this way are just gross to me. it's also just...very bad. seriously though, THIS won a rate?

**fadedblue09** (1.5): Bleh. Could pass off as some Ed Sheeran/Shawn Mendes filler I guess. Mad respect to all those who participated though (like, imagine wasting your time on Liam Payne's music lmao).

**shhhneak** (1): why is this here what did it win lmao

**waluigiest** (0): I was so pissed when this won. It’s such an uninteresting song who is gunning for this ever

# just the people who hate Harry Styles

**bespectacIed** (7): i prefer slow hands or like i would, but this bops. I'm just glad h***y lost this rate omg that man irks

**hikkaru** (6): anyways thank god harry isn't here

**bulforster** (1.2): (#47) While it is very funny that Harry Styles didn't win this rate, this song is pretty boring compared to the rest of its competition here.

# the person who's gonna fight them

**hunnybee12** (4): this was the first rate I ever submitted for but my scores got rejected because they were “too biased" for harry .. but it was my truth sob

For the many, many people confused by how Ms. 500k YouTube Views ended up in this rate, she won a smol event called /r/popheads Worldvision where users were invited to submit ~~noname trash~~ under-the-radar artists from various countries around the world, and we would then vote Eurovision style on which songs we liked the most. Of course, the final songs were all in English and came from Anglo-Saxon countries, with Hanne Mjøen taking the victory for Norway. I'm usually partial to the rate underdogs, but this is such boilerplate scandipop Spotify pap, from the generic churning beat to the most bananas and avocados voice imaginable, that I really can't muster the energy to defend her. Also a voter pointed out that her Instagram highlights used to titled with an ableist pejorative so, like, I really can't be assed to write much else. Bye!

=====

letsallpoo: # Europeans, probably 

**CarlieScion** (10): my pick for worldvision <3

**fadedblue09** (10): Norwegians do love their songs named Strangers, do they? Well, maybe hot take but I liked this better. Take notes (or vocal lessons for that matter), Sigrid!

**runaway3212** (10): Stan Sigrid

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): I didn't do the rate this was from but this is fantastic

**TiltControls** (10): who is this person and why is this actually a bop wtf

**twat\_brained** (10): this is just Don't Take the Money but perfect

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): yeah i’m a sucker for punchy synth-pop and an artist would have to try and make me disklike it, sue me

**seanderlust** (9.5): i had actually never heard this song before but I quite like it!

**RandomHypnotica** (9): Hanne > Sigrid

**steelstepladder** (9): One of the few songs I've never heard before this and it's kinda great?

**slimboyfriend** (8.6): if literally everything about this song were better it would be supercut by Lorde

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): This honestly might grow on me between submitting and the rate reveal. We'll see.

**hikkaru** (8.5): didn't do worldvision bc i'm a flop but this is really good and i love her voice wow

**starlitsuns** (8.5): What rate was this in? Seriously, the production is beautiful and Hanne’s voice is beautiful here.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): hadn't heard this one before but it's good!

**mysario** (8): thank you Norway for your service

**nooodisaster** (8): Builds and builds... most pleasing.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): mom: we have Sigrid at home... Sigrid at home:

**vayyiqra** (8): It's by a Scandinavian synthpop girl so I have to like it now

**pat-rickstar** (7.8): Who will win the battle of the Norwegian pop girl songs titled Strangers? If you're reading this, you will know the answer

**1998tweety** (7.5): this bops

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is a really cute song

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I was like “what rate did this win” and so I looked it up and it was Worldvision and I was a participant in that. Oops. So of the songs we rated I do NOT remember this one but it isn’t bad! It’s got a nice build to it and it really justifies its run time, though I do wish it got the point a little faster.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): this sounds very Robyn, but thats a good thing!

**Stryxen** (7.5): its so cute

**suhonyu** (7.5): she's cute, give me melanie teas which I don't rly like but ya know whatever

**yatcho** (7.5): Who is this and why are there two songs named Strangers in this rate and why are they both the same formula but also why are they both bops?

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): I’d never heard of Hanne at all before I started this rate, but this song is pretty solid. I’ll have to keep her in mind in the future

**bigbigbee** (7): Very sweet but a little boring. Definitely the weaker of the two songs called Strangers, IMO.

# Sigrid outsold

**ignitethephoenix** (7): can’t believe there’s 2 songs called strangers by Norwegian artists in this rate. Unfortunately this is the less superior one, but it’s cute

**worlds-okayest666** (7): this is fun but also feels like it could be sung by anyone. the other strangers in this rate outsold

**bbfan132** (6.5): cute but kind of underwhelming

**aresthormars** (6): A good bop. But it seems like I have heard far better synthpop song and somehow the repetitiveness of the chorus became dragging. Plus I kinda hear Now That I Found You in the structure of the melody of the chorus. The prechorus tho is chef kisses!

**AtomicViolet** (6): Nice but kinda bland tbh

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Not a big fan, but I can see how this won Worldvision. It's also a lot better than most ESC entries too.

**fishingfor8** (6): sounds like a more nostalgic Carly song. Doesn't have the same charm though

**Frelock\_** (6): Also serviceable but with an interesting commentary

**kirby31200** (6): Definitely the worse of the two Strangers. Not bad but I don't think it stands out enough to be great

**ktajlili** (6): Decent writing, but I find the instrumentals a bit basic, and the vocals to be not my style

**PuggleMaster** (6): I was expecting something amazing in this song since it won a rate, but it was pretty one note and boring all the way through.

**racloves** (6): Sigrid outsold

**ReallyCreative** (6): normally I'm down for lowkey bedroom synthpop queens but this is just not that interesting

**SmileAndTears** (6): This is like the most generic synthpop-song-sung-by-a-white-girl I've ever heard

**waluigiest** (6): is it wrong that I kind of hear Melanie Martinez??

**camerinian** (5.5): this is a cute bop, shame about the bananies and avocadies voice once again ruining things

**raicicle** (5): it’s pleasant but its a shame how actually forgettable it is, her anonymously mellow voice definitely doesn’t help

**bulforster** (4.2): (#32) Cute song but in this rate cute doesn't really cut it.

**joshually** (4): I’M SO SORRY!! But that was really boring

**ManofOranges** (4): I mean, this song sounds perfectly fine as in it's not offensive to my ear in any way but that's about all I think it has going for it. I feel like it could you at least any kind of dynamic contrast but it really just doesn't go anywhere

**selegend** (4): pretty generic

**anothertown** (3): I mean… it’s no Sigrid. Also, it’s great to see the R-slur right there at the top when I google this hoe because it’s the title of one of her Instagram highlights

**moonagenightmares** (3): this is like the very definition of a basic pop song

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): i hate this banana avocado way of singing

**skargardin** (3): pretty run of the mill scandipop

**cloudbustingmp3** (2.7): one day popheads will stop overrating h&m'd synthpop songs with this title

**kappyko** (2): scandipop will burn

> I know I sound basic saying it but wow this song really is pop perfection. I actually love it when songs take their time to build up, we go nearly a full minute before that epic chorus kicks in and releases that delicious serotonin to my brain. I could write a whole essay on that chorus and how it solved world hunger, ended climate change, and finally found me a boyfriend; three events of equal importance.

>  And just like my university assignments, the song doesn't let up! The next verse and pre-chorus have more going on than their prior counterparts and before you know it we're back in the chorus but this time with added adlibs! I love when songs make an effort to make their choruses sound slightly different so adlibs are often the easy way to go about it. Thankfully, Little Mix are kind of know for serving adlibs and harmonies. Finally we get to the bridge and last chorus and WOW I'm ascending. Call me Dua Lipa cause I'm Levitating, call me Katy Perry cause I'm Rise-ing off of the ground, Call Me Maybe (please call me I'm lonely). I can't think of a better moment in modern pop history, so please just go listen to it for yourself. I love how each girl gets her chance to shine on the track: Leigh does a really great job starting the song off, Jesy's sultry vocals match the vibe of the track perfectly, Perrie's adlibs on the bridge and 2nd chorus take it to a whole new level, and of course Jade always delivers stellar vocals. Do yourself a favor and watch the video for this cause not only are the guys HOT, the choreo is iconic too! and I lowkey like Perrie's weird corset oop 

> Anyways, I will be sad to see this get robbed and go out early Day 2! - /u/1998tweety [host note: erm, about that...]

---

Little Mix have always been expert bopmakers, and "Touch" is perhaps their biggest bop of the past few years. *Glory Days* was a solid album with a title that seems all the more poignant as we hear more about their label difficulties and disbandment rumors, and while "Touch" wasn't the biggest hit from that era, it's become perhaps that era's most defining. Sleek and sexy, it's a prime song for throwing your back out or pounding your taint into the floor. I love the chaotic adlibs that tumble over the final chorus, and the way the drop manages to bring energy without suffocating the song in noise. Let's continue to pretend the Kid Ink version doesn't exist and appreciate the fact that Jess Glynne is not in this rate.

=====

letsallpoo: # Mixers

**anothertown** (10): This song is full of tropes from the era it was made in, but it perfects them all

**aresthormars** (10): This is my fave from the first time I have heard from this rate! It all started like a song that I kinda expected from a girl group. But the reggaeton influence in the beat for just the chorus, oh my Lord, what a vibe!

**bespectacIed** (10): in my head this is a smash that went number 1 in 189 countries and sold 400 million units

**camerinian** (10): holy fuck this was so close to my 11. This is as perfectly crafted as modern pop comes. The way the song builds itself up only to collapse into those harmonies on the chorus is something sent from the heavens. I hope this song stays relevant the same way that Wannabe has, because it's basically the pinnacle of girl group music

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is Little Mix's best song FOR A REASON.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Oh gosh, I feel like I keep saying “this is one of the first pop songs I really fell in love with” in this rate but it’s true, this is such a walk down memory lane. This is one of my few winning elevens so I went back and dug up my initial thoughts on it and here’s my favorite part: “When this song starts it’s like Leigh-Anne is slamming the door open and grabbing you by the throat and then the girls just take turns throwing you around the room, and you love every second of it. The lyrics are sexy and fun, the energy is overflowing, and that legendary chorus over that speaker pounding bass is just *it*.”

**ImADudeDuh** (10): 10uch

**PuggleMaster** (10): Throwback to me having to stan this song in secret, because I was a stan of that messy group that was lead by a rat.

**Roxieloxie** (10): I Never got as into Little Mix as I did 1D, but I do have massive respect for them. This is one of my favorite songs from them and if you dont like it, you simply hate fun

**runaway3212** (10): This is my favourite little mix song

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): The Girl Group We Deserve

**twat\_brained** (10): wait wouldn't it be hilarious if this scored directly above Clarity since both songs only *just* beat "Rather Be" to the win?

**CarlieScion** (9): sounds so smooth and good

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Stream this instead of Confetti.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): the only LM song I know tbh

**worlds-okayest666** (9): love this song but also think they have better singles tbh

**bigbigbee** (8): This grew on me. I thought it was very “tropical house 101” but the riffs in the final chorus sound great and their vocals are all super clean. The lyrics though…eh.

**joshually** (8): this is not my favorite LM song, but these girls deserve better

**ManofOranges** (8): Rather be I'm so sorry, I'm sorry that a song like this would steal your spot. At least this song is pretty good though.

**nooodisaster** (8): I have this theory Perrie secretly hates this song. On "Little Mix Plays Truth Or Wine", Perrie refused to reveal a song she hated, but when asked if it had to do with the word "sunny", did reluctantly say yes. What is "Sunny"? Well, a Google search reveals "Sunny Productions", the writer for one Little Mix song: Touch. Perrie also stated she didn't want to say what song it was because it was a collaboration. "But Touch wasn't a collaboration!" you cry. Except there WAS: Touch feat. Kid Ink. Is Perrie reusing to admit she hates a fan favorite song due to fear of backlash? That dear reader, is for you to decide...

**starlitsuns** (8): This song is such a vibe! Also this makes me miss that phase in pop music where tropical house was all over the place, so that’s fun, I guess?

**succulentils** (8): I'm very into this music video. The song itself is... fine. Kinda how I feel about most of their songs.

**vayyiqra** (8): Aggressively 2016 and it's good

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): It's a really cute bop!

**Stryxen** (7.6): little mix is my guilty pleasure and I do not feel guilty

**bbfan132** (7.5): cute but holiday and break up song are excellent, stream them

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): I swear I had to remind myself 4 times that no, Alessia Cara does NOT have credited vocals in this song.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): it’s fine but it just seems very generic to me

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): their best song yep yep

**hunnybee12** (7): what it god's name is perrie wearing in this music video

**selegend** (7): the video is hilariously bad

# ma'am that was in the first winners rate

**suhonyu** (7): this shoulda been black magic :/

#Harmonizers

**moonagenightmares** (6.8): kinda basic but the chorus is catchy asf

**ReallyCreative** (6.8): pretty good but there's way too much in this rate that blows this out of the water

**SmileAndTears** (6.8): The chorus just doesn't work at all

**WeastofEden44** (6.8): Power deserved u rats

**kirby31200** (6.5): Listening to this I definitely thought it was older than 2017. It's fun but it's a little basic

**steelstepladder** (6.5): Daft Punk deserved

**bulforster** (6.2): (#22) Love these girls, it has some kinda basic lyrics but this song is great.

**intheaftermath** (6.2): I feel like I've seen 200 bad anime amvs to this song

**aestheticen** (6): I played it too much back then

**waluigiest** (6): the chorus is wet but the rest is pretty nondescript

**welcometoNY** (6): this song finds little mix masquerading as pop virtuosos. i know a lot of people love this song, and it's easy to see why, but i can't help but feel that it's just a tired replica of something that's been done better a thousand times before.

**jsonphile** (5.5): I know very little about Little Mix. As in I know nothing except they’re a girl group. Since this won a rate I presume that means it’s one of their best songs, and it’s just....fine. I don’t know maybe I’m missing something but they just seem pretty generic. Not bad, but nothing particularly interesting.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): If you told me this was a mashup of some MØ, Zara Larsson and Sigrid songs I would believe you

**hikkaru** (5): how did this beat rather be

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): well it’s there i guess

**seanderlust** (5): three songs later, I don't remember what this sounds like.

**skargardin** (5): among the other songs here this is just ok

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): this song sounds like a Sephora commercial

**cocosairdep** (4): It’s fun I guess but a bit generic imo.

**fadedblue09** (4): Really forgettable I'm sorry.

**Frelock\_** (4): Music and melody seem uninspired

> I know we hate men, but u/ThatParanoidPenguin and I ran the mens rate last year so we must submit our defense of them. hopefully your forgive our sins but it's a bop so hear us out. "Mirrors", the winner of the 2010s Ultimate Mens Rate, is a top song of Justin Timberlake's discography and arguably his magnum opus. off of his massively influential The 20/20 Experience and one of the longest winners in r/popheads rate history clocking in at 8:05, the song may come off daunting but Justin delivers a hauntingly beautiful reflection (hehe) on finding that other someone who perfectly completes you. paired with one of the most beautiful music videos directed almost guaranteed to bring a tear to your eye, this home run of a song deserves all the love given to it.

 > anyways do the mens rate - /u/frogaranaman

---

To all the people who complained about this song being too long: I PUT THE RADIO EDIT IN THE PLAYLISTS FOR A REASON!!! DID YOU GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO LISTEN TO THE WHOLE-ASS THING JUST TO BE ABLE TO DRAG IT??? I hate how overwrought the original "Mirrors" track is, as well as almost every other song from its parent album, so there's a reason I tried to help both y'all and this song by linking the edit. Why did y'all torture yourselves with the entire thing? Did you watch the music video or something? I know it won video of the year or some shit, but that doesn't mean it's worth eight minutes of your time!

This song is fine. When Justin had his big ol' comeback in 2013, I loved the swagger of "Suit & Tie" (which had not aged the best tbh) and much preferred it over "Mirrors," which I thought was a little boring. I still don't enjoy the filtered effect placed on his voice in the chorus, but I can see the intentions behind putting that aural distance between himself and the listener. I will say that it's probably a small victory for him and for men in general that this song isn't in dead last. Good job Justin!

**TragicKingdom1** (11): PERIOD!!! I know this is a lock for day 1 but this is a pop EPIC and everybody needs to accept it.

=====

letsallpoo: # Men's Rights!

**akanewasright** (10): This is like the only Timberlake song I like. And I REALLY like it. All ten minutes of it. I honestly think this song is little a masterpiece and one of the best pop hits of the last decade. I keep trying to find reasons to lower its score, and I can’t.

**aresthormars** (10): I love this song and the part two of it. This is peak JT.

**bbfan132** (10): that chorus is excellent, i feel every word he is singing even if the song is cheesy as hell. i prefer the longer version but this is also a 10

**cremeebrulee** (10): will also be robbed

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The 20/20 Experience era was the peak of my JT stanning and this is definitely still one of my top favorite songs from him. I hate that this is probably going to go out on Day 1 because the music video holds a special place in my heart. The MV pretty much summarizes my parents' marriage, in the best and the worst way possible.

**frogaranaman** (10): do the mens rate

**hunnybee12** (10): this song is perfect I cant put into words why but it is

**ignitethephoenix** (10): truly his peak

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I just KNOW this is gonna be robbed cause y’all will complain about this being too long even though the playlist SPECIFICALLY USED THE RADIO EDIT

**ManofOranges** (10): Okay if I listened to the like 8 minute long version this song would lose a few points but the playlist has the radio edit instead so I'm perfectly content with giving that a 10

**quinnpsych** (10): Unreal song, literal cultural reset, defined my early 10's

**Roxieloxie** (10): Not to romanticize like fucking 6th grade or whatever grade I was in when this album dropped, but that tiktok that said life was better when this song was on the radio might've made some points

**runaway3212** (10): This track is so great I always forget it's a whole nine minutes

**suhonyu** (10): the only time this straight man deserved rights

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): do the mens rate

**InfernalSolstice** (9.5): cant wait for popheads to absolutely rob this because it's justin timberlake

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): BOP

**CrimsonROSET** (9.2): Bless whoever put the radio version over standard.

**astrologicalangel** (9): one of the rare cases where the radio edit is better

**intheaftermath** (9): Can't believe my middle school emo phased forced me to hate this song. I haven't hear it in years and it's actually so good

**starlitsuns** (9): What happened to this song? It was all over the radio in 2014 as part of JT’s comeback, and just disappeared. It definitely has aged well, and I just want to hear more of it.

**mysario** (8.8): rate the 8 minute version you cowards

**InternetDude19** (8.6): This is better than I remember

**1998tweety** (8.5): big bop but y'all will drag it cause it's a man and it's long

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): offended at the inclusion of the radio edit vs. the original but whatever, still great

**plastichaxan** (8.2): maybe men deserve a little bit of respect

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.1): this is a bop

**fadedblue09** (8): I love this song more than I'd like to admit, even though I still think that The 20/20 Experience is an insanely overrated album.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): JT's best song since FSLS

**jasannn** (8): I'm surprised how well this song aged.

**Stryxen** (8): trying to form an opinion on a justin timberlake song give me a second

**twat\_brained** (8): great song but Treasure should've won

**camerinian** (7.5): host can you please drop my score by a point if i was meant to rate the full version instead of the radio edit thx

**nooodisaster** (7.5): It's fine but.... it's also by Justin Timberlake.

**Frelock\_** (7): Catchy tune

**raicicle** (7): i do think this is a great song but in retrospect i don’t actually think this is one of the songs that benefited from the two-part 8-minute treatment that songs on the 20/20 experience had so I’m taking marks off for that

**succulentils** (7): Mirrors don't stare back. Reflections stare back. I hate these lyrics.

**waluigiest** (7): its like ur my mirror...... WEY HO

# maybe not all men deserve rights tho

**slimboyfriend** (6.9): I used to love this song back in the day, but now I’m whelmed

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): why did JT need to make every song on the 20/20 experience ten minutes… one or two i get but there’s so many self-indulgent long songs on that album

**lIIustration** (6.5): the beginning guitars aren’t my favorite

**worlds-okayest666** (6): honestly this is ok but it was so overplayed when it came out i cant help but hate it...like it was completely unavoidable it was such a nightmare!!

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): he has done this exact same song like 3 other times and each one is a lot better than this

**racloves** (5): can anyone even understand a word he’s saying in this song? I swear there’s a bit that says “my hand in a bucket full of soap(?)”

**bespectacIed** (4): i hate praising this awful human being, this is an ok song unfortunately

**CarlieScion** (4): men

**PuggleMaster** (4): I actually loved the first part of the 20/20 expierence but god did i always think this song was overrated.

**steelstepladder** (4): Huh... First time listening to this song in years and it's worse than I remember. Didn't need to be 8 minutes that's for sure.

**team\_kockroach** (4): The instrumental doesn’t fit the vocalist at all. The arena-rock guitar at the beginning just recedes and this weird guitar-clap takes its place. Meanwhile, Justin has no emotion or charisma in his voice.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Okay so now I finally have a name and a face to put to that song that I heard on the radio all the time as a kid that I hated. Cool. This is one of those songs where I think I’d like it if it were sung by, like, Leona Lewis or someone, but I just don’t think that Justin has the voice to pull this off. He sounds whiny and the tinny production doesn’t help, plus this does not need to be anywhere near as long as it is.

**joshually** (3): I cannot stand his voice… it’s just so punchable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i am not fucking listening to an 8 minute long justin timberlake song

**anothertown** (2): Finding out that this song is pop stans’ favorite off the 20/20 Experience now of days was like a slap in the face. There are some fun and interesting things going on on that album and absolutely none of them are here.

**bulforster** (1.8): (#44) This beat feels clunky somehow and really makes the song drag given it's on the longer side.

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): No. Stream Unbreakable.

**urlocalcracchead** (1): because of what he did to my girl janet jackson

**wavingwolves** (1): i'm already dreading the way i'll have to listen to this again at the reveal

**AtomicViolet** (0): This had me in the first half not gonna lie, than it just kept going, and the longer it went the more I turned on it until finally I was completly sick of it. If you're gonna go over 8 minutes at least have the decency to be a Purple Rain or November Rain epic instead of this

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): this gets a 0 for being god awful and also bc my ex loved this song so it's double tainted now

**hikkaru** (0): when this won over both bruno bops in its rate... ladies i was BOILING... i've always found this song really annoying especially as something that got a lot of overplay on the radio and the non-radio edit (and the whole album tbqh) has no business being eight minutes long

**plvstvcbvrds** (0): i fucking hate this song. i think he made a deal with the devil to make this song play everywhere the year it came out, which happened to be a year i was working retail, and i heard this song 15 times a day for a year. an entire year. i once wore ear plugs to work because of this damn song. i would stand still too long and start humming it to myself. it's the glitter of music. the herpes of music. i will never be rid of this godforsaken attempt at art.

**seanderlust** (0): I want to be absolutely clear that I am not just rating this so low because men bad, but that certainly doesn't help. it's just...it's just boring, i'm sorry. the entire time this was playing I was just waiting to hear kate bush.

**skargardin** (0): goodbye

I would say The Weeknd redefined the "Main Pop Boy" image much better in ways that JT couldn't.

> Caution was what what many consider a return to form for Miss Mariah after a long slump and with this rate winning song she proved her sharp songwriting wit and ear for infections pop melodies with a hip hop blend still held up. A No No effortlessly combines an extremely fun, punchy backing track (with an excellent Crush on You sample) with some really shady lines rivaling the best in her career a la' Obsessed. As a new Mariah single from an under-listened album I know this will probably be overlooked in this rate which is a shame, if only she released that Lil Kim/Missy Elliot/ Cardi remix for an 11 average - /u/yatcho 

---

Mariah's divaness and past catalogue are discussed so much that sometimes her genuinely great recent work is overlooked. *Caution* was an incredible album, and "A No No" one of its strongest songs. It combines so many quintiseentially Mariah things - gratuitously flowery vocabulary, a simmering R&B instrumental, and an air of being way too cool for whatever you're offering her. It's the kind of song that goes down real smooth and warms you right up, which the best Mariah songs often excel at.

The original rate matchup was a little skewed — we really just threw together four monosyllabic albums by four female pop stars — but it was fun to see Mariah get her reward for making the best album of the bunch. This wasn't the track I was personally rooting for, but it's more than earned its place here despite its less than stellar placement.

**anothertown** (10): The best verse I’ve ever heard in a pop song is: “Irregardless of what transpired / It ain't even worthy of a slick reply / Even if I was the last woman alive / I would be like Ginger, you ain't Gilligan, I / really don't care, I'm in love with the island / Rockin Dior cause it goes with my diamonds / Got a pink gown custom by Alaia / I'll be on stage when the stadium light up”

**bbfan132** (10): mariah is a lyrical genius

**bespectacIed** (10): Didn't do this rate but even I was shocked this won over Honey (i was rooting for Honey lol). This song and the rest of caution are a classic tho

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): should've been her 19th #1 before Godmas

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): R&B Mariah over ballad Mariah any day. I should give Caution a listen for real.

**fadedblue09** (10): The best Mariah song on this list, yet for some reason it will probably be the first one to go out.

**J\_Toe** (10): Love the Lil Kim sample

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is a Yes Yes

**PuggleMaster** (10): Mariah literally proved that she still fucking had it when she released Caution. I'm tempted to dock her a few points for releasing that shitty remix so the Nicki Minaj haters would stream it.

**ReallyCreative** (10): this might be my favorite R+B song of the century not gonna lie, the absolute EQUALITY demonstrated in "he's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak"

**runaway3212** (10): Caution is a godlike album and this is a godlike song

**twat\_brained** (10): What's Mariah's most hip-hop heavy album? I'll listen to it. Even if it's MC=^2 I'll play it on repeat.

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): its a bop

**1998tweety** (9): Honey deserved to win the rate but this is good too

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I love this song but I kinda ruined it for myself by listening to [the Shawni remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAl7ktjKviU) so much because now the song feels incomplete without her, kinda like Nicki Minaj on “Up Out My Face.” Still a good song but I know what it’s like when it sounds GREAT.

**moooo566** (9): I don't really know Mariah outside of AIWFCIY but this is actually good?

**mysario** (9): the closed loop of Mariah copying Ariana copying Mariah

**lIIustration** (8.5): love the production, the lyricism is weak

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): she’s still got it

**akanewasright** (8): Cute bop with a really well used sample

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I like Caution, but there are a handful of tracks I would've preferred taking the win in its rate. (S P I R I T, it's great to see, we got it, the spirit, hey, hey, let's hear it).

**hikkaru** (8): rating this again instead of h*ney i LOVE it here!!!!! i feel like usually my overall opinions on albums/songs aren't too spicy compared to the general popheads userbase but i just can't get into robyn at all especially honey so i was ecstatic when this song pulled through in that rate. anyways the production of this song is so fun

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): a strong single from Mariah!

**joshually** (8): honestly… this song is not her best but I’d still jam to it

**suhonyu** (8): it's cute, thanks forcing me to listen to it

**waluigiest** (8): overall a fine album and a fine song, but nothing exceptional

**seanderlust** (7.5): "irregardless" gretchen weiners teas

**aresthormars** (7): My only complaint from this song is that trap hi hat. Like can they tone it down some more and let Mariah do her thing?

**CarlieScion** (7): its cute i guess

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this is good but compared to her other songs here, it’s not that impressive

**kirby31200** (7): I like everything but the first two choruses

**SmileAndTears** (7): I hate trap skitters with a burning passion

**Stryxen** (7): it’s a bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): fun fact I got to do some promo for this album 🙈

**vayyiqra** (7): Mariah queen of trap

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.8): yas put him in his place

# No No No

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): I feel like this is a bit underwhelming compared to the other 2 Mariah songs

**skargardin** (6): its fine

**starlitsuns** (6): I just didn’t get anything from this song.

**Tolk1en** (6): she's done so much better, I don't even know how this song made it to the winners rate...

**bulforster** (5.8): (#24) I love Caution but better than Honey? Idk about that…

**CrimsonROSET** (5.8): ... I just don't see it, sorry.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (5): How did Honey or The Distance rate lower than this in the original rate?

**nooodisaster** (5): A maybe maybe

**camerinian** (4): jesus this song really just has one speed huh? I was tired of this after one listen, how tf did this win a rate

**Frelock\_** (4): Mariah is just not using her vocals to the fullest.

**selegend** (3): never really cared for this

**steelstepladder** (3): Weakest Mariah song here by a mile

**chillbumps5** (2): i think there's too many mariah songs in this rate

**fishingfor8** (2): is this the same melody as No by Meghan trainor?

**TiltControls** (2): The chorus does the rest of this song a disservice

**welcometoNY** (2): this is pretty bad if we're being honest, but bumped up a point because Mariah always gets a pass from me

**ImADudeDuh** (1): I hate this song a lot.

**team\_kockroach** (1): Is this her “Bad Blood”?

**wanderingimpromptu3** (1): It just feels flat and starts grating on me over time

# "Disirregardlessly" outsold

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I once used “irregardless” in a sentence and the girl I was talking to cut me off immediately to say “IRREGARDLESS ISN’T A WORD!” Turns out this is true, but if it’s good enough for Mariah it’s good enough for me.

> Co-hosting this rate was both simultaneously the most stressful and most fun experience I have ever had on this sub. Even though my personal 11 (Catallena) was unjustly robbed, it's hard to disagree with Genie having won the rate - it's an undeniable classic by one of, if not the most iconic group that k-pop has ever birthed. Those pulsing beats, those impeccable vocals, the styling in the video, the leg choreography that led to me having a swollen ankle when I smacked it against my bedpost attempting to perform it. 사랑해 소녀 시대! - /u/agentofscranton

The Hallyu Wave refers to the spread of South Korean pop culture worldwide, which is a steady force that's been happening since the 90s. There's been multiple waves, and in the late 2000s, Girls' Generation emerged as one of the prominent forces propelling Korean entertainment to a global audience. Much of this came off the back of "Gee," which led to a string of other irresistable tunes that endeared them to pop listeners around the world. It's hard to overstate how SNSD were genuine trailblazers — they were at the front of the pack before BTS, Blacpink, "Gangnam Style," and all those other forces that made kpop just pop.

"Genie" is not the aforementioned "Gee," or their biggest and perhaps most infectious song, nor is it [their most innovative song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq7ftOZBy0E), nor is it their most recent [pop smash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4w8IbQTJpY). But it's remained perhaps their most beloved song and one of tthe best aged songs from that generation of kpop. It's featherlight yet thunderous, marching towards you with a cutesy energy that demands for you to be enchanted. I can't think of any better representation of the Hallyu wave than the image of SNSD stomping towards you, dressed in military uniforms, to deliver a simple, grammatically confused line: I'm genie for you boy! It's coquettish and threatening, turning you on but also impressing you with its power. DJ, put it back on!

letsallpoo: # people who watched Aladdin (2019)

**1998tweety** (10): Pop perfection. I'm sure the people who tank this cause "they can't get into k-pop cause of the language barrier" are probably Ariana stans.

**aestheticen** (10): they paved the way

**agentofscranton** (10): Co-hosting this rate was both simultaneously the most stressful and most fun experience I have ever had on this sub. Even though my personal 11 (Catallena) was unjustly robbed, it's hard to disagree with Genie having won the rate - it's an undeniable classic by one of, if not the most iconic group that k-pop has ever birthed. Those pulsing beats, those impeccable vocals, the styling in the video, the leg choreography that led to me having a swollen ankle when I smacked it against my bedpost attempting to perform it. 사랑해 소녀 시대!

**bespectacIed** (10): 💗 The rate I co-hosted 💗 Btw this heart emoji is the exact background of the Genie mv lol. Shameless tooting of my own horn, but this rate was great. Iconic songs, hilarious robberies, very varied day 3, amazing dark horse top 3 (eung eung SOTY), a neck-and-neck top 2. And finally, objectively the greatest k-pop song of all time as the winner. DJ, you know what to do

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): y'all will never let me live down giving this a 0 in the original rate and i deserve that. i was a dumb binch for not realizing how great this is even if 4 Walls is better

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I say this as someone who is FINALLY immersed into K-pop this year, the results of the K-Pop Retirement Rate were BRUTAL. It's already clear that SNSD will win that rate, but the question was "Which song from SNSD is going to be the winner"? I was expecting that I Got a Boy will win. But it makes sense that Genie is the actual winner of the rate. This is the song that defined SNSD's legacy. The fact that this was used during the news coverage of [this year's elections in South Korea](https://twitter.com/SoneSupport_/status/1250373974392889345) solidified their legacy.

**imasalesman** (10): Iconic

**intheaftermath** (10): I'm not super familiar with KPOP but this was so good, I just have to listen to their entire discography

**jasannn** (10): DJ PUT IT BACK ONNNN!!!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): one of the best kpop songs ever yup yup

**raicicle** (10): iconic

**sarcasticsobs** (10): **kim taeyeon, if you read this I’m free on thursday night and would like to hang out outdoors, 6 feet apart, while wearing masks. please respond to this and then hang out with me outdoors, 6 feet apart, while wearing masks on thursday night when i’m free**

**selegend** (10): this will probably be one of the first 5 songs out because xenophobia even though it is pop perfection

**twat\_brained** (10): This, "Touch", "Damaged" and "Say My Name" are just on that skyscraping echelon which all other girl groups can usually only ever dream of reaching.

**wavingwolves** (10): this shouldn't have been the winner of the rate it was in but it's still a blast of a song

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): I always discover really fun kpop songs from the cumulative rates like this. It's a fun lil bop that makes me want to jump around my room and sing into a hair brush, what more can you ask for in 2020

**fadedblue09** (9.7): It’s grown on me a lot since I did the rate, but I still think it lacks that little oomph factor to becoming true pop perfection. Taeyeon snapped with her vocals though.

**mysario** (9.6): minus 0.1 point for every wall this tore down

**starlitsuns** (9.5): The production? Flawless. I haven’t dived enough into the k-pop scene, but this is a serious bop!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): oh i hear sumn

**hunnybee12** (9): i'm surprised this was the highest rated snsd track but it's still great

**kappyko** (9): popheads will be like "OMG i don't care that they're asian i know a bop when i hear one!!!"

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): wait a minute girls, this is a serve

**bigbigbee** (8): I think that if I heard this song for the first time this year I’d score it lower, but I can’t rate this song objectively because this comeback was so ICONIC back in 2009/2010 and I’m instantly transported back. Uh, I never noticed how annoying the outro is back then, though.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): why does this sound ripped from a music video at the beginning and end? I really like the verses of the song but the chorus is just weaker than the rest of the song which is disappointing

**kirby31200** (8): The end is adorable

**lIIustration** (8): , I like the claps in the background

**nooodisaster** (8): wait... was Gee in this rate?? Did Gee lose this rate??! Isllamaphobia smh

**runaway3212** (8): This is not a bad song, but I feel like kpop has had a lot of better hits

**vayyiqra** (8): Never heard this before but it slaps

**aresthormars** (7): A good bop! And this is coming from a person who is lukewarm to K-Pop. Sounds like a mix of Justin Timberlake and Kesha.

**jsonphile** (7): not really a k-pop fan

**PuggleMaster** (7): A cute song but it's a little dated for my taste.

**Stryxen** (7): a bit of a bop. dj play this exactly once.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Aladdin is typing...

# white people and/or Amber stans

**bbfan132** (6.5): it’s ok but they have better songs

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): The chorus just sounds really bland to me, just a really lifeless homogenous single tone of noise

**akanewasright** (6): This is cute

**CarlieScion** (6): it just doesnt bop as much as i want it to

**CrimsonROSET** (6): I gave Abba a 2.5, I gave Lady Gaga a 1, and this is still the score I think I'll get the most shit for.

**hikkaru** (6): snsd has much better songs and 4 walls was robbed

**ImADudeDuh** (6): why is there so much background noise in this song? I know there’s like 10 people in the song but jeez

**joshually** (6): it’s like cute

**skargardin** (6): GG has much better titles than this, still perplexed as to how it won the rate

**SmileAndTears** (6): Why does this sound like shitty french pop from 2009/2012

**waluigiest** (6): mild bop

**anothertown** (5): I can’t really crack this era of Kpop

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): This rate had Wonder Girls and they FLOPPED, so I'm kinda bitter ngl. Stream Tell Me.

**Frelock\_** (5): Serviceable

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): To this day I’m confused that this was the winner of that rate, there were SO many good songs in it and this is so “meh.” That said the “I’m genie for you boy” line is annoyingly catchy, I find myself saying it a lot.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (5): I can't not hear the laugh used in the MV as the kids on Tatooine in The Phantom Menace

**ManofOranges** (5): No offense to these girls but for a kpop song, I was expecting something a little more impactful, instead I got this

**steelstepladder** (5): Ugh, I've only started getting into Kpop last week I don't have a good barometer of what qualifies as good yet. I don't see myself returning to this though :/

**welcometoNY** (4.3): this won a rate? serving throwaway album track from a c-list popstar who peaked in 2012 realness.

**chillbumps5** (4): why does this sound like justin timberlake

**seanderlust** (4): this sounds like a demo that would leak on youtube

**bulforster** (2.2): (#42) Feels like it's pulling its punches somehow. I'm not really into Kpop but am a bit confused how this beat Gee.

> The 20GayTeen rate is probably my favorite moment in Popheads history. After YEARS of watching Y&Y get slept and shat on across the subreddit and server, they finally got the justice they deserved in a giant curbstomp where no other song came close to winning at any point. Of course, they're not subreddit favorites or anything now, and I fully expect this to go out late day 1 or early day 2 [note from /u/letsallpoo: LOL] as an "objective bop but not exactly a classic," but All For You's victory was still a personally immensely satisfying moment for me. - /u/TragicKingdom1

---

Fun fact: When I search for "All For You" on YouTube, I need to scroll to the second page to see this video! All drags aside, this is a solid and satisyingly gay pop song from a solid and satisfyingly gay pop group that has only improved in quality since their debut. "All For You" is explosive and upbeat like their best songs, and Olly's voice is as strong as ever as he calls out to his recalcitrant lover. It's a prime farewell song to any asshole, letting you dance your way through your rage and heartbreak.

> Kesha was one of the defining forces of the early 10s pop scene, with her first two projects spawning multiple smash hits and classic songs we all remember today. But after Die Young, which ended up falling short of the win in the 2012 Ultimate rate, her chart success began to dwindle with this song in particular. It's truly tragic what happened with C'Mon on the charts - it's a sugary sweet ode to simply living one's young life to the fullest in a way that blends early Kesha's more trashy party girl vibe with production, vocals, and overall lyrical sentiment that makes the song drip with nostalgia, a drug that many popheads users cannot get enough of when it comes to the music of the early 10s. Thankfully, because of that, it was awarded the win over bigger hits like Die Young as well as songs from Nicki and Rihanna, and when hosting this rate I couldn't have been happier, as it's one of Kesha's best in my opinion. - /u/hikkaru

---

Every big pop star has that one song that manages to define themselves. For Gaga it'd be the gritty but irresistible "Bad Romance"; for Katy it's the weightless and effervescent "Teenage Dream". For Kesha, it is not "C'Mon," but if did manage to not be her first single to not reach the top 10 of the Hot 100, I'd bet good money on it becoming one of her defining tracks. It's so perfectly Kesha, from the tumult of bonkers rhymes in the second verse (who else would rhyme "sabertooth tiger" with "Budweiser"?) and the slightly crass but still charming way that she rings out the chorus. And above all else, it's the way that this song invites you to join in on the fun that's always defined Kesha's artistry. She always wants you to join in on the fun, no matter what she's doing, and the sheer joy exhibited in this song makes it so difficult to say no.

**InfernalSolstice** (11): one of my all time favorite songs
[/r/popheads/comments/k27cgq/the_winners_rate_ii_reveal_day_1_do_the_mens_rate/gdsvd8g/]

=====

letsallpoo: # usernames on the wall in the back of the bar

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop, I miss this Kesha. High Road was awful

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The Warrior era is always going to be my favorite from Kesha.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of the first pop songs I ever really fell in LOVE with and it still holds a special place in my heart to this day. I think we’ve all had one or two great nights out with our friends where we were just carefree and happy and even the most mundane things felt like part of some grand adventure just because you were all doing it together and this song really captures that. I think a big part of what made her connect with her audience so well is that she makes a night out with your friends sound like the most important thing in the universe; she treats all of the stupid little details with such reverence that you can’t help but feel nostalgic for all the silly little moments from your life that, with the context Kesha provides, might have actually been magic all along.

**hikkaru** (10): we love kesha

**ImADudeDuh** (10): No song makes me feel more like an extrovert than this one.

**joshually** (10): THIS IS MY FAVORITE KE$HA SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**kappyko** (10): WAIT............

**lIIustration** (10): trouble in the dark t-t-trouble in the dark

**ManofOranges** (10): I don't have much to say about this one except that it's wonderful

**nooodisaster** (10): Beethoven has been real quiet ever since this dropped.

**PuggleMaster** (10): While I prefer most of Warrior to this song. You can't deny that this is a 10 out of 10. I know Dr. L*ke has tainted this era, but I still think this was some of her best work!

**skargardin** (10): smash of the century yaas

**starlitsuns** (10): I’m fairly sure that people born in that time frame where we were alive during 9/11 but remember nothing are old-school Kesha fans without realizing it. This song is fun, it’s a bop, and I wish Dr. Puke would actually receive punishment for his alleged actions against Kesha instead of getting another Number 1 with the Say So remix.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): thank you 🐼

**TiltControls** (10): This song really shows how Kesha can be the queen of party when she wants to

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this wasnt my 11 in its original rate but it should have been bc this is a fucking BANGER!!!

**camerinian** (9.5): holy fuck that last chorus buildup is god-tier, that hook is fantastic, and the rapping is

**mysario** (9.5): ha ha this is cute I'm lonely

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Queen of furries

**anothertown** (9): “Saw you lea- / ning again- / sthat old re- / cordmachine” is iconic opening phrasing

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): I wish she had saved this for a later single and not right after Die Young

**seanderlust** (9): not to be that youtube comment that's like "WhO sTiLl LiStEnS iN 2020" but like...I actually still listen to this for non-nostalgia reasons. it still slaps.

**Stryxen** (9): THE party anthem

**bigbigbee** (8.5): This song is brought down by the sung-through part of its verses for me, because the choruses are transcendental. (Personal taste - I feel like the melody could be more interesting. Someone should mash this up with Nee by Perfume.)

**kirby31200** (8.5): I like it but didn't Kesha already make this song

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I saw this tiktok of a gay roller dancing down the street with this song playing in the background the day that trump lost the election, and that epitomizes this song for me

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): YUM like a lollipop

**CrimsonROSET** (8.1): I guess I'm more shocked this won? I mean, shoutouts, but out of all songs in that rate, this is the winner?

**WeastofEden44** (8.1): Key-$-Ha really did that huh

**jasannn** (8): A cute pop song but Die Young is surperior.

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's like, not even a top 10 Kesha song what is it doing here in this rate. still a bop

**Tolk1en** (8): lazy lines but sitll a bop

**twat\_brained** (8): Can we honestly call this song more worthy of the win than "Stay"?

**runaway3212** (7): It's good, but not worth the hype it gets

**succulentils** (7): Why is she trashing the Mexi mart smh

**vayyiqra** (7): Kind of surprised this won but I like it

# people who may recognize that a Dr. Luke-produced Kesha song has not aged the best

**WillamThunderfuck** (6.5): It's a cute song, but imo it does not compete with the other songs on this list at all

**aresthormars** (6): I hate that I think I can hear this as a Katy Perry song.

**bbfan132** (6): kind of fun but it doesn’t do much for me

**jsonphile** (6): ....I know this is controversial on this sub but I just don’t really like Kesha’s early work, it can be a bit grating

**RandomHypnotica** (6): Me listening to this song: "C'Mon please end"

**Roxieloxie** (6): I only really know this era of kesha from when she was on victorious

**steelstepladder** (6): Not my choice of Kesha unfortunately. Wouldn't be sad if this went out early tbh.

**waluigiest** (6): I was honestly not super engaged by this era of Kesha

**aestheticen** (5): C’Mon, out of all her songs, this one?

**cocosairdep** (5): Cute little bop. Sounds too dated tho.

**Frelock\_** (5): Nice enough but not my style.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this is so underwhelming

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): maybe 2012 was worse than 2020

**bulforster** (4): (#33) This is so fun but, since I'm splitting hairs for this rate, also pretty clumsy.

**selegend** (4): it’s alright

**zadooi** (4): Old Kesha was never good and I think it's time we have that conversation.

**CarlieScion** (3): this isnt even fun!!!! it is so painfully early 2010s

**ElizabethDDoS** (3): Never liked Kesha that much.

**bespectacIed** (2): back to back dr luke songs lmao

**chillbumps5** (2): reminds me of tik tok

**wavingwolves** (2): the warrior album cover makes me yearn for simpler times

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): warrior is one of my least favorite pop albums of all time and tbh in general kesha's music is just not my thing despite loving her as a person

**fadedblue09** (1): Everything Kesha did before Rainbow (sans Timber) was unlistenable garbage, and no amount of pOpTiMIsM can change my mind on that.

**sandyfishnets** (1): her voice annoys me

**welcometoNY** (1): just generally unremarkable. inoffensive but nothing i would listen to on purpose

> Young and Beautiful is Lana Del Ray at her best. The orchestra, her longing voice, and the overabundance of adjectives all come together and transport you to the sorrow scene she describes. Even a Lorde lover like me, who was rooting for a dark horse Yellow Flicker Beat win, couldn’t be mad at this win because it was completely deserved. - /u/Strawberryswing1

---

Question for the culture: Even though Lana Del Rey is a frequent appearance on random movie soundtracks, where did she begin her reign as one of the premiere movie chanteuses? The answer is, of course, the moody and dreary "Young and Beautiful," which employs this particularly moody and dreary version of her (which has thankfully evolved when it comes to her albums) that's present in many of her soundtrack songs — even when [it absolutely does not fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leopt__ATR0). 

"Young and Beautiful" came out in early 2013 as the *Born to Die* era was dying down, and it was ostensibly written for the *Paradise Edition* originally. She even brought it up in an interview along with "Body Electric" and "Gods and Monsters," but while both the song that mangles Walt Whitman poetry and the song about dropping it like it's hot in the pale moonlight made it onto that EP, "Young and Beautiful" was the one placed on the back burner? Lana's questionable taste aside, the origin of "Young and Beautiful" makes sense when you listen to it. It's a great distillation of the BTD era and, if anything, a proper send-off. Here, Lana is entering full Lana Del Rey Mode, with a somber orchestra providing the moody backdrop as she coos about her usual topics. The summer nights are hot, the diamonds are brilliant, the soul is aching, and all that jazz. It's glamorous and evocative yet distinctly shallow, which is pretty much how I'd describe her early work as well as the general culture of the Roaring 20s, where the movie is set.

With all of this in mind, I...don't think the lyrics have a whole lot to do with *The Great Gatsby*, like how she references Bel Air despite the story taking place in New York. Lana said she intended to write this from Daisy's perspective, but the affection Daisy had from both of her lovers never seemed dependent on her youth, and the song's preoccupation with how that love may be fleeting doesn't match up with the book's themes about the characters being beaten back ceaselessly into the past. Still, the song's haunting nature juxtaposed with its gaudy lyricism fits the mood of the movie so acutely, and Lana as an artist was just perfect for that soundtrack. it's not a surprised it won the rate, in spite of its middling performance in this one. Even though it's rarely brought up in the Lana canon nowadays, I find it strangely symbolic of her early career. It was a proper coda to her breakout era, and a mellifluous entry point into the literal Hollywood pictures that have always informed her artistry.

**cocosairdep** (11): This song is so beautiful, it feels so timeless. It remains one of Lana’s best songs, beyond a shadow of a doubt. I still can’t believe how it lost the Grammy to Skyfall.

letsallpoo: #Certified Reycists

**1998tweety** (10): Y'all better leave your biases at the door and give this the 10 it deserves.

**aresthormars** (10): Lana fits in the soundtrack and it makes sense she is singing in a Gatsby movie. Rick Knowles also did a great job in production!

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): this is THE lana song tbh

**runaway3212** (10): this is my favourite Lana track

**succulentils** (10): The percussions are so good

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i feel guilty giving lana a 10 but fuck this is so good

**mysario** (9.5): can't wait for people to trash this just because PH turned around on LDR

**seanderlust** (9.3): i never actually saw the great gatsby but I remember the soundtrack was actually one of the best OSTs I had ever heard.

**plastichaxan** (9): maybe this would've been a ten before...you know

**vayyiqra** (9): No Main Pop Girl around today does ballads like Lana

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): I keep forgetting the version I have in my library is the orchestral version which is vastly superior to the original. Still my favorite Lana song

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): Lana's done better, but for a one-off soundtrack song it's pretty fucking good

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Was really into this song back in college but maybe I overplayed it because I’m kinda over it. I love the drama of it though, Lana’s sound feels at home on soundtracks and I hope she keeps making this work a priority because it’s good for her. Also [the situation with this song not being nominated for the Oscars was very interesting and actually taught me a lot about the failures of the Academy.](https://time.com/11728/lana-del-rey-young-and-beautiful-oscar-snub/)

**urlocalcracchead** (8.3): This girl needs to stay out of drama so I can continue to stan her

**bigbigbee** (8): The opening notes make me want to listen to the Song of Healing from Majora’s Mask. It’s definitely good, I just think she’s made better in this vein.

**joshually** (8): great song, beautiful song

**kirby31200** (8): The only good thing to come out of the new Great Gatsby movie

**PuggleMaster** (8): Racist queen snapped!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): honestly after this song we should’ve seen republiclana coming

**waluigiest** (8): will you still love me when I’m no longer young and bootylicious?

**zadooi** (8): This would be a full point lower if I didn't love the scene in The Great Gatsby where this plays.

**engifear** (7.7): "I've seen the world, lit it up." Someone stop her! She's spreading COVID again!

**starlitsuns** (7.5): This would get more points if we were considering the orchestral version, which is so dreamy and beautiful.

**CarlieScion** (7): this was one of my most played songs in 2014. listening to it in 2020 feels just really weird

**Frelock\_** (7): You know, good vocals accompanied by an excellent classical arrangement.

# gang sunk that dunker

**Ionlywanttheworld** (7): there are better Lana songs

**lIIustration** (7): overproduced

**nooodisaster** (7): vampires cant relate :(((

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): I can't believe THIS is the only Lana song that's ever won, and we've rated her entire discography ugh

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.4): eh

**akanewasright** (6): This song is lovely, but a lot of the lyrics are just fucking awful. Lana is usually much better at bridges than this.

**bbfan132** (6): i used to love this when i was younger but now it sounds very overproduced and kind of dull… still not bad though

**camerinian** (6): this is a mid-tier Lana song that only got so many props cos it came out immediately after Born To Die when literally anything she made would have been swallowed up by desperate sad gays

**frogaranaman** (6): this movie was such a mess

**ManofOranges** (6): I mean, it's a fine song, but there's not much that intrigues me. In the grand tradition Lana songs for me, it's a pretty middling experience.

**steelstepladder** (6): This chorus is great but outside of a handful of songs I still don't like a lot of Lana

**twat\_brained** (6): Yellow Flicker Beat was robbed

**moonagenightmares** (5.7): what else does karen woolridge grant even have going for her aside from that and her father’s wealth

**welcometoNY** (5.6): it's pretty, but it's also very paint-by-numbers Lana and the sentiment is a bit on-the-nose

**CrimsonROSET** (5.5): Question for the culture: is this joke overused yet? I'd say about as overused as this song format, which Lana plays completely straight, which usually means we should focus on the lyricism, but I'm not a big fan of her songwriting ('he makes me shine like diamonds' doesn't quite do it for me) so I gain nothing from this.

**anothertown** (5): I feel like this could easily be a Weeknd song

**fadedblue09** (5): I have already made it clear in the past rates that I am not fond of her music, and this was way before she started digging her own grave. That being said, I'll give her credit when it's due: this orchestral pop is a better fit for her voice than whatever Ultraviolence was.

**jasannn** (5): I honestly hate that movie.

**SmileAndTears** (5): Idk it tries to be so grand and dramatic but the sound doesn't match with the lyrical content

**slimboyfriend** (4.9): why does she ask a question then answer it in the next line

**kappyko** (4): i cant believe we ran out of lana albums to rate

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): two adjectives lana is rapidly decreasing in

**bulforster** (3.2): (#37) This is pretty, but not my thing.

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): old and ugly and makes me wish i had another 0

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): We've evolved past the need for Lana Del Rey. Would have been my second 0 if that were an option.

**Roxieloxie** (1): yes im balladphobic but this also isnt good

**skargardin** (1): bye

**suhonyu** (1): i'm really not a big fan of her, but I know this subreddit adores her so whatever

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): to this day i am still unable to tell the difference between any lana del rey song

**ImADudeDuh** (0): not this

**pat-rickstar** (0): I feel a bit mean giving out my 0 when I'm scoring almost everything else a 7 or above… but this is so boring I'm sorry how did this win a rate

**Stryxen** (0): this is a less than mediocre lana song and I feel like picking on an easy target

> I am very upset Bleachers didn't win the rate. However, I am also upset that CHVRCHES didn't win the rate either. HOWEVER, I am glad that this is the 1975 song that won (even tho Love Me still outpeaked). What a pulsing groove throughout the song, which is good cause Matt is such an angry, petty bitch here. It really shouldnt work as well as it does. I'm assuming that's why it's going out at #46. But r/popheads has never cared for men and has been very conflicted on The 1975. It's a great song! - /u/ImADudeDuh 

> I was still young when i first heard this song. With my head in the clouds, hands in my pockets, toes poking out the holes in my socks i was a much different person to who i am now. The best i can do is describe it as somewhere between innocence and unknowing but i think that's just being young. I was just in that kind of honeymoon phase of life where hours feel like lifetimes and things get wrapped up nicely in little red bows. I think the best part about being young is just the unbelievability of the world. It's not the feeling of invincibility that gets you but its the rush of blood and seeing another day. it's not the all consuming vortex of young love its the uncontainable passion that doesnt make sense. it's not that things don't end but its that every time they do they are dramatic and vivid and sometimes even a little bit tragic. And i guess you just kinda live these not quite lies and not quite truths until you wake up one day and you can suddenly give more precise answers and you know that youre grown. its so romantic to cling to the ideals of a tunnel song or a last dance at prom but for the average person things just dont end like that. I remember my first love. She had soft blue eyes, skinny and tender hands, and a dump truck ass. She wasn't there the first time i heard this song but i think about her every time i hear it now. and that all represents something to me. i never got to hear the end of the tunnel song or even go to prom. i constantly look back at these moments and emotions i didnt get a chance to feel and for some reason it always leads me back to this song. and i can tell you its for sure because its the song i can imagine myself in all those situations just absolutely fucking losing it in my coming of age moment. This song is so special to me because it is a reminder of the past but its also a stamp on to say "hey its finished you dont have to go back there".N)> its an end to an end of itself. it's the pink rimmed edges of a john green book. its the car ride home after a really fun night. its so much thats not being said and can't be said anymore. its youth and its passion and its obsession and its trying to be cooler than you really are and its hoping for the best and its just not giving a fuck for a couple minutes. its a whole damn motherfucking vibe and god i wish i had been young enough to grow up with this song - /u/FranklyTheTurtle

---

The 1975's pretension has doomed many a song and many an album from them, but sometimes they're capable of channeling their haughtiness into a fun tune. Like several songs off of its parent album whose full title I can't be bothered to retype out here, "The Sound" plays out a conversation between a douche and his lover as they bicker about love and and shoes and the beating of her heart, whose sound is evidence enough to the man that she really does love him in spite of everything. The song is then draped in both upbeat, boppy synths and a deluge of SAT vocabulary, which makes for weird interstital material as he alternates between talking about her skin and how he's a "sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe". The music video just adds to it, which displays them in a glass cube while critics lobby harsh (but, in retrospect, sometimes not untrue) criticism towards them while Matty Healy mopily gazes out and continues to sing. It's a fun blend of differing attitudes and styles, and a great showcase of how they're sometimes capable of channeling their artistry into something fun and approachable.

letsallpoo: # the 1975ers? 1975ans? idk what 1975 stans are called but these people are them apparently

**bbfan132** (10): mega bop alert

**bigbigbee** (10): Absolutely the new discovery of the rate for me. What an incredible little song.

**CarlieScion** (10): so many 11s in a row damn

**CrimsonROSET** (10): This is gonna go out first and you all owe me an apology.

**frogaranaman** (10): this is a fun karaoke song besides the guitar solo but if you’re drunk it’s fun to dance to!

**hikkaru** (10): this is pop perfection but it's gonna be bottom 5 i hate this

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Bleachers deserved to win this rate periyanka

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): yeah this song is great

**shhhneak** (10): a fun upbeat 1975 song is just on another level.

**slimboyfriend** (10): the perfect pop song and it teach u some new words

**steelstepladder** (10): Back when Matt Healy could be pretentious in a fun way

**Stryxen** (10): no I never moved out of my 1975 stan phase. its love hate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): congratulations to the 1975 for their first and only good song!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the way this song is gonna get fucking tanked lmao

**TiltControls** (10): One of my favourite bands that I've discovered over the past few years (though if Matty Healy could shut up for like a minute that'd be great)

**welcometoNY** (10): certainly a choice for this to be the 1975 song that makes it into this rate. it's obviously a god-tier song, just not quite as god-tier as most of the other songs on this album.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): the heartbreaking truth is that the 1975 DO make bops

**team\_kockroach** (9.5): The best of the 1975.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): Every The 1975 album has exactly 5 songs that are actually good on it, and this falls exactly in the middle of that range for this album

**camerinian** (9): shut the fuck up Matt Healy <3

**cremeebrulee** (9): how to reconcile the fact that i hate matt healy but also like this . please advise

**hunnybee12** (9): pretentious and annoying but i love it

**ManofOranges** (9): This is yet another song that I do begrudgingly like, although I expect it do to poorly. It just has a certain je ne sais quoi to it.

**selegend** (9): matty healy is annoying but bops are bops and the 1975 has a good amount of those

**skargardin** (9): banger

**starlitsuns** (9): I didn’t realize that this was a song by The 1975 until now. I love the production on this.

**twat\_brained** (9): this was the one 1975 song I dared to allow into my iTunes library

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): It's a good song but that chorus is too repetitive. Like, can you come up with something else?

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop, they dont have many but the ones that do bop hard

**nooodisaster** (8.5): ~~WeLl i kNow ~WhEN yUoRe ArOu~Nd CzU I kNOw ThE sOuNd, i KNoW htE SO~u~nD oF YouR HEaRt~~

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): carly outsold but this is another recent grower

**aresthormars** (8): Very catchy and groovy!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I love songs that are examples of themselves, if that makes sense? Like lyrically the song is about how they know what this person sounds like and so then we as the listeners can infer that the sounds we’re hearing in the instrumental break of this song are meant to evoke what they’re hearing and it’s pretty nice! This is one of the few songs in the rate I hadn’t heard before but I like it.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): there are better 1975 songs out there but it's so catchy

**kirby31200** (8): Doesn't break any new ground or anything but it's enjoyable. Pretty cool guitar solo.

**racloves** (8): this is one of like three 1975 songs I actually like

**raicicle** (8): i fear this song’s video is just a way for 1975 fans to pretend they’re above optimism as a concept (even though none of them absorbed the message of the 1975’s video for girls)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I ain’t never seen two happy 1975 stans. Always one of them gotta be sad

**vayyiqra** (8): Such a bop I can forgive the awful pretentious lyric "simple Epicurean philosophy"

**waluigiest** (8): overall its pretty fun!

**wavingwolves** (8): a good song from their second worst album

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): This makes me really cheerful :)

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): this is identical to like ten different indie rock songs I had on repeat in college, not necessarily a bad thing but I've kinda outgrown this

**bespectacIed** (7): The synth pop rate where Chvrches, the only legit synth pop band in the rate, lost; tragic. But the winner's a good song

**engifear** (7): Somebody Else should be here instead

**intheaftermath** (6.7): this sounds like that song written by the bot designed to emulate Eurovision. It's like a slightly worse version of Blue Jeans and Bloody Tears

**suhonyu** (6): cute corporate banger

# 1975 antis, AKA normal people

**jackisboredtoday** (5.7): Matty Healy stop sucking off your own perceived intelligence in the verses challenge

**bulforster** (5.6): (#25) Unnecessary levels of pretentious irony aside, this is a bop.

**Frelock\_** (5): Nice background music I guess.

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Bye that beat got irritating after a minute.

**Roxieloxie** (4): Wait I did a fanmix for a [redacted] big bang and I think the title of it might've come from this??? im gonna ask the author if thats the case

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (2): I have no idea what anybody sees in this band

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): I simply hate everything about this band. Sue me.

**runaway3212** (1): I think this song is an unlistenable mess

**anothertown** (0): I hate this

**ignitethephoenix** (0): this song has great production but why does it sound so annoying. Maybe this is just my 1975 distaste coming through but the chorus is very annoying. This definitely is my least favorite song here by far

**moonagenightmares** (0): can’t stand this whiny douchebag and his overrated little band

**plastichaxan** (0): well it's not a good sound

# Carly Rae Jepsen outsold

**zadooi** (7.5): Put me in the "Carly Rae Jepsen outsold" section of the comments.

# or maybe she didn't

**jasannn** (5): Maybe songs called "The Sound" are bad. Sorry Carly

> In my country, where Mulan's singing actress, Lea Salonga, comes from, Reflection is the most iconic scene in this movie. In other countries, it's probably I'll Make a Man Out Of You instead; the two songs ended up ranking side by side when they topped our Disney rate, and although I was a little bitter that the former didn't end up winning despite being the quintessential gay Filipino anthem, there's also hardly anything else that matches the perfect combination of humor, camp, and sheer awesomeness of its companion. Let's all make sure to fondly revisit this masterpiece of watching the new remake that actually butchers Chinese culture even more! - /u/yourhostandpatron

---

The Disney animanted story of *Mulan* hinges on two songs. The first is "Reflection," a delicate, tender song about Mulan trying to overcome the expectations set forth by her gender identity. It's emotional and evocative and takes its time to really build up her sorrow and pain. The second is "I'll Make a Man Out of You," which acts as a foil in a way by providing the manly counterpoint to "Reflection"'s feminity. It's an overtly sexist song coming from the movie's most masculine character, and it lays forth what Mulan needs to do to accomplish her goal. Like "Reflection," it's about the expectations set forth by one's gender, but this time for men. The song is clear as, above the choral chants of "be a man," it explains that men are swift, strong, mysterious, and all these adjectives that are intentionally cliche and vague. 

There are a lot of criticisms to be made about "Mulan," especially now that in 2020 it's become a political talking point, but I saw some comments paint this as sexist, which it is, but it approaches that topic from a subversive angle. The entire story is about a cis woman who manages to meet and surpass the definitions of a man that this very song sets out for her, and you need this uber macho song in order to convey these ridiculous expectations, just so they can be dismantled later. It also helps that the song is a complete bop, with thundering orchestral work and Donny Osmond's spirited voice building everything up.

letsallpoo: # Disney gays

**astrologicalangel** (10): ftm anthem

**CarlieScion** (10): LETS GET DOWN TO BUSINESS!!!!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I'm not a Disney gay but this is just too good.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS TO DEFEAT THE HUNS

**hikkaru** (10): the best disney song PERIOD!!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I don’t trust people who dislike this

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Mulan is the best film of the Disney renaissance besides Aladdin, yup.

**intheaftermath** (10): Truly deserving of the love it gets. Donny Osmond's performance is immaculate. I think this rate is just revealing that I'm a theatre kid at heart

**J\_Toe** (10): was not expecting Disney in amongst regular songs, lol, but it's still a 10

**jsonphile** (10): literally the only Donny Osmond song I’d rate higher than a 5

**kirby31200** (10): Best Disney song of the whole 90s

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is a 10 for the nostalgia factor alone, and I'm not sorry about it. It's wonderful, it's fantastic, and Mulan has some of the best songs Disney has ever made

**moooo566** (10): a powerful competitor

**mysario** (10): top 3 Disney movies with a bottom 3 remake

**nooodisaster** (10): Fully the dark horse of this rate.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song goes slap the fuck off for no reason, and to this day it still gives me chills. the whole ending, like bruh BRUH this song is amazing. it slaps, it hits, it bops. when the instruments drop out and it's just the vocals? BITCH YOUR FAVE COULD NEEEEEEVER.

**raicicle** (10): perhaps one of the best disney songs

**Roxieloxie** (10): Have you guys seen the Historian on twitter who did a thread/video about the cultural accuracies/inaccuracies of mulan? it was really interesting and i recommend! Anyway the song is a bop but anytime i hear it I will always think of the team four star version unfortunately

**selegend** (10): i’ll ignore the fact that a white man sang this bc he killed it

**starlitsuns** (10): Iconic as heck. Live action Mulan flopped for several reasons, and not making it a musical was one of the less important ones.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i still haven’t actually watched mulan yet

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.6): i wanted to give this a 10 but it’s slightly not as good as i remember. still great though

**TiltControls** (9.5): Sometimes a little over-rated for Disney songs, but it's still a classic sing along song

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): I love this, it just doesn't quite reach catharsis

**CritneySpearz** (9.1): not me not realizing this was Donny Osmond who sang this… omg

**1998tweety** (9): This is a trans/bi anthem right? We stan

**jasannn** (9): Did anyone actually think the live-action remake would be good?

**nootnoot781** (9): maybe the homophobe snapped on this ome

**racloves** (9): Mulan is my favourite character and means so much to me

**sarcasticsobs** (9): honestly i expected that i’d be tired of this song by now but NOPE NOPE NOPE

**steelstepladder** (9): A touch overrated in terms of Disney but it's still one of Mulan's best

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): the mere fact this is absent in the remake made me skip it entirely

**camerinian** (8.5): I can make you a MAAAAA-AAAAA-AAAAA-aaaa-aaaaaannnnnnnn

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8.5): Reflection is the superior song from Mulan and I will die on that hill

**suhonyu** (8.5): come thru misogyny

**aresthormars** (8): I like Reflection more tho.

**PuggleMaster** (8): I had no idea this was Donny Osmond omg.

**runaway3212** (8): Mulan is an overrated Disney movie and this song is its worst. The last part is pretty great though

**waluigiest** (8): Disney really ate it up with this one

**SmileAndTears** (7.8): Iss ok

**shhhneak** (7.7): I don’t care if it’s 3am I will scream sing “BE A MAN” every time.

**twat\_brained** (7.3): m*n is a slur and this song is hella sexist but Donny can belt

# Donny Osmond publicly came out against gay marriage in 2008

**anothertown** (6.5): yes this scene is one of the best in Disney… but the song? Idk, I was never in Band or Theatre and I’ve never said “Wholesome Keanu Chungus”

**bigbigbee** (6.5): It’s good but I suspect it won its original rate on the merit of the (incredible) montage sequence in the movie, not on the song alone; I think it suffers divorced from that context. Still good though!

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): Mulan is a good movie but I never really saw the songs as the most memorable part tbh

**WeastofEden44** (6.1): Well you girls absolute silence look good!

**fadedblue09** (6): Lemme guess...Li Shang must be a gay icon that I'm not aware of? Otherwise I have no idea how this won.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I loved this song so much as a kid but as I’ve matured it’s just started to sound more obnoxious than anything else. I dunno, maybe one too many overzealous Disney loving theatre kids have ruined this with their spontaneous singalongs.

**InfernalSolstice** (6): this works to mixed results outside of the context of a sountrack/the movie

**ReallyCreative** (6): like the most overrated Disney song but it still isn't bad

**vayyiqra** (6): Okay but we need to talk about if the Huns are overhated or not

**welcometoNY** (6): i feel like this is a bit paint-by-numbers musical theatre. it's not bad, it's just reminiscent of other musical theater songs that are far better.

**InternetDude19** (5.1): I don't have nostalgia for this, and it reminds me of annoying theatre kids.

**bbfan132** (5): donny sounds good but it’s still mediocre

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): reflection deserved

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): I feel like I am going to get so much shit for this but I haven't seen Mulan as a child so I have no personal nostalgia for this song fsdkjdgkgdfjklfjdkl. Apologizes for the low score. The Lion King is more in my alley than Mulan.

**lIIustration** (5): I don’t like disney music and this isn’t an exception

**PointlessBibliophage** (5): i'm sorry being a man is cringe

**skargardin** (5): there are better classic disney songs out there than this overhyped song

**Stryxen** (5): this is an opinion I hold

**AtomicViolet** (4): Apologies to my FTM brothers but the thought of being made into a man is so gross to me.

**hunnybee12** (4): snooze

**kappyko** (4): the song about gaston eating eggs is so much better than this

**RandomHypnotica** (4): I hate listening to musical tracks out of context, it just feels so weird and wrong

**CrimsonROSET** (3): I think this is the score I feel the worst about. Like, it's a fine Disney song- but it doesn't quite compare to all these actual pop songs.

**joshually** (3): sorry, this song is not really that good, and… it’s sexist, and the live action movie just made everything worse.

**bulforster** (2.4): (#41) This is fine, but a rate winner? This wouldn't even cross my mind when thinking of the best Disney song.

**engifear** (2): I'm extremely afraid of people who just listen to Disney songs outside of the movie. Actually, I'm afraid of anyone who still watches Disney movies in general.

**fishingfor8** (2): never watched Mulan as a kid for some reason

**wavingwolves** (2): if i never listened to this song again it would make no difference in my life

**plastichaxan** (1): i hate that y'all made me listen to disney but at least it was mulan i guess

> This was such a boring win. We all saw Paramore sweeping the Emo Rate 1.5 coming from a mile away, but why oh why did this have to be the winner? It's a good song, but the rate had much more interesting and iconic songs - like Decode, 20 Dollar Nosebleed and The Ballad of Mona Lisa. Damn you Popheads for being basic af - /u/CarlieScion 

 > Hello! This (Emo Rate 1.5) was the first rate I hosted and it was with the lovely CarlieScion! Outside of one point where "New Perspective" had a brief lead, this never left first place. The rest of the top 10 was a chaotic mess but y'all agreed that this song is the best of the Paramore songs on this album (and against two underrated flop albums RIP)! It starts off hitting HARD and you know what you're getting from the get go! The harmonies are beautifully done, the band works as tight as ever, and Hayley does a great job lyrically building more than a house here - and it's all wrapped up in a catchy bow! It's undoubtedly one of Paramore's BA-DA-BA BA-DA BA BA BEST! - /u/mysario

"Brick by Boring Brick" is a song by American rock band Paramore. The song was released in late 2009 as the second single from their third studio album, Brand New Eyes (2009).

"Brick by Boring Brick" was also featured in The Vampire Diaries episode "Under Control" that aired on April 15, 2010. In terms of airplay, it is one of the album's successful singles, including the song "The Only Exception".

Reception

The song received generally positive reviews from critics. Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy, who gave the song 4 stars out of 5. He said the song is "infectious, deliciously dark ('Well go get your shovel, and we'll dig a deep hole'), and packed with more energy than a Jedward dance routine – Williams sounds downright tremendous leading the 'ba-ba-ba' climax – this should provide a welcome edge at the top end of the charts".[2] Rolling Stone stated that "Brick by Boring Brick" was able to "weave unexpected Smashing Pumpkins-style sonics into the mix."[3] The song received a positive review from Vicki Lutas of the BBC, who awarded the song 5 out of 5 stars. She said that the song is "hair-raisingly BRILLIANT" and said "Listening to the lyrics is like entering a world where sandcastles aren't built, but buried, a world where the baddie is not the wolf, but reality... and in this world, things are dark, but they're very real. There's a sense of longing; longing for those fairy tales and longing for innocence, but it's coupled with a sense of realization that this will never happen."[4]

letsallpoo: # will probably do the emo rate 5 and emo rate 3.14 and all the others

**addupten** (10): SO close to getting my 11

**aresthormars** (10): Ba da ba ba da ba ba ha ba da ba ba da ba ba ha

**bbfan132** (10): i love paramore and this song so i can’t give it anything less than a 10 but it will be out early for sure

**bespectacIed** (10): one of my alltime fave rates ever despite the mess and THE ONLY QUEENCEPTION embarrassing herself at Day 1. This win made me smile so much. We made the true best song in the rate win instead of the obvious choices. We deserve an award for this rate

**camerinian** (10): just gut punch my nostalgia why don’t you

**fadedblue09** (10): God I was so close to having another 11 win. Folie stans can stay mad lmao. Maybe if they bothered building a proper consensus on the songs it would have fared better.

**hikkaru** (10): listen vices & virtues deserved so much better and either ballad of mona lisa or nearly witches should have won but this is still one of paramore's best songs and the best from bne so i'm ok with the winner of this rate.. what i'm NOT happy with is how they ate the entire top 4 like wtf

**moooo566** (10): BADA BA BA BADA BA BA BA BADA BA BA BADA BA BAAA

**mysario** (10): I have a blurb for this

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Vices and Virtues and Folie a Deux died for this song to be here, and I'm surprisingly not even mad, it's just THAT good.

**yatcho** (10): Their best song periodt

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): I've been listening to folie alot since the emo rate,,, but i've also been listening to this alot. FOB was very much robbed in that rate and paramore did not deserve to sweep like how they did but, i kinda really enjoy this ://

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): One of the first songs that got me into Paramore. Ignorance outsold from the album however

**kappyko** (9.5): i remember posting this to the PokeFarm forum for a forum game.... these lyrics were so good in elementary school!!!

**Stryxen** (9.4): god I forgot how GOOD this is badabapadababada

**InternetDude19** (9): I'm too young to feel old.

**ManofOranges** (9): Honestly this is kind of a hit

**racloves** (9): bringing back my emo phase

**ReallyCreative** (9): despite all my friends being obsessed with Paramore in high school, I didn't really climb aboard the train until self-titled. As a result I'm just not well versed in the earlier stuff, I get to discover some gems like this though as a result.

**starlitsuns** (9): Ah yes, more emo bops to bop to!

**twat\_brained** (9): great but Ignorance should've won

**waluigiest** (9): Hayley Williams Stan 4ever

**bigbigbee** (8.8): Trying to score this made me realize how much context affects my opinion. This score would be lower for me in the context of its original rate, but I gave a boost here because it’s from one of my favorite, favorite genres ever, which isn’t really represented elsewhere in this list.

**bulforster** (8.6): (#10) All of this hits so hard.

**1998tweety** (8.5): serves a bit

**CarlieScion** (8): this top 4 will forever haunt me

**cremeebrulee** (8): ignorance deserved :(

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): I love Hayley but this isn't their best

**kirby31200** (8): Fall Out Boy deserved to win this rate. I've always kinda hated how the bridge lyrics sounded like they were building up to something and then don't and just repeat. "When you've built up a world of magic, because your real life is tragic... yeah you've built up a world of magic" Lazy!

**selegend** (8): my peak emo era song

**slimboyfriend** (8): I feel like I’m 13 and mad at my dad again

**steelstepladder** (8): The better of the two Paramore songs but still not their best

**wavingwolves** (8): the emo rate was a mess but this is AMAZING and i need it to not go out on day 1

**seanderlust** (7.7): this one hurts, especially since I just gave this one a ten. but this is a stacked rate and in this lineup I have to rate it a bit lower than I normally would. this is all stars, baby.

**runaway3212** (7.5): Not my favourite

**fishingfor8** (7): not my genre but still enjoyable

**Frelock\_** (7): Another song I haven't heard before, but pretty enjoyable.

**jasannn** (7): sounds like debut demi or does debut demi sound like paramore

**skargardin** (7): I don't think this should've won its respective rate but it does bop

**SmileAndTears** (7): I've never liked Hayley's voice :/

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): if you’re still listening to this in 2020 and have big goth tiddies dms are open 😈

**vayyiqra** (7): Yes I only listen to After Laughter and "Misery Business" like a basic Pophead but this is good

# did not shop at hot topic

**CrimsonROSET** (6.5): The trauma that rate brought... mess.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): day 1 song

**hunnybee12** (6): it’s calling out my qurantine coping mechanisms rn and i dont like it

**ImADudeDuh** (6): still one of the worst rate results ever (but the reveal was fun af)

**moonagenightmares** (6): boring indeed

**nooodisaster** (6): I think the fairytale lyrics are interesting but kinda on the nose, and along with the production just contributes to this song feeling more middle school than Paramore is.

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): I like their poppier stuff way more.

**TiltControls** (5): unremarkably alright

**astrologicalangel** (4): this should not have won and I'm still salty

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): this won something?

**cloudbustingmp3** (3.1): i really only like paramore from self-titled onward

**anothertown** (3): noise

# the sole remaining fall out boy stan has had ENOUGH!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): im giving this my 0 to spite all the tasteless hoes who did emo rate 1.5 and kicked out all of folie a duex before top 5. fuck you i fucking hate you.

> Can you feel that? Carole King sure can. “I Feel the Earth Move” was an undeniable competitor in the Women in Music: 1971 rate. Known for its rollicking piano melody, King’s vocal performance, and the all-too-familiar feelings of seeing a lover, “I Feel the Earth Move” was an early contender for the top spot in its original rate and maintained its status as the submissions kept tumbling in. On an album full of classic pop tunes that are familiar to any ear, “I Feel the Earth Move” was in a good spot to be remembered, opening Tapestry with bombast; the mellower tracks on the album follow, weaving a portrait of young love and artistry. Next June, “I Feel the Earth Move” will celebrate 50 years since peaking at number one on the Hot 100, proving that a good song that can get your heart trembling will forever be timeless. - /u/whtrblckhl

---

So after the previous reveal it should be noted that Wikipedia is a great resource for making these writeups, and I want to bring special attention to the entry for this song in particular:

> Music journalist Harvey Kubernik wrote that "I Feel the Earth Move" was "probably the most sexually aggressive song on the Tapestry album" and a "brave" opening to an album whose mood is mostly "mellow confessionality". AllMusic critic Stewart Mason describes the song as "the ultimate in hippie-chick eroticism" and writes that it "sounds like the unleashing of an entire generation of soft-spoken college girls' collective libidos".

Yes, you heard it here first: "I Feel the Earth Move" was indeed the "WAP" of the 1970s, and Carole Thee King was the horniest force in pop music at the time. All jokes aside, there is definitively an erotic element to this song. If you do empty your mind a bit and listen to the song, and you hear her coos interspersed with the banging of that piano, you may indeed find yourself just a little turned on. Carole's raw but catchy lyricism and her natural ear for pop melodies come fully through on this track, and it makes for a walloping good time.

This song was a mega smash (I mean, I wouldn't know personally — I'm 12 :/ ), becoming one of the biggest hits of 1971 and peaking at #1 for five weeks. Just imagine the number of libidos she set on fire during that reign! Your fave could never.

letsallpoo: # Old People

**bbfan132** (10): the last minute is wild and i love every second of it

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is gonna be cut sooner than it deserves

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I really should listen to Tapestry.

**fadedblue09** (10): Damn, a timeless, uplifting bop. Also, I feel obligated to give this a 10 since she basically paved the way for my faves lol.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Gave this my eleven when we rated it the first time around and while it won’t be getting it this time, I think it was a worthy recipient; the cherry on top of one of the best albums ever recorded. I love the way the piano almost sounds likes an earthquake, as if the music is conjuring up the feeling of the earth shaking beneath her feet.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): In 2015 the song was featured in a mashup with Alanis Morissette's "Hand In My Pocket" on American television series Glee, "Jagged Little Tapestry", covered by Naya Rivera and Heather Morris.

**J\_Toe** (10): I'm glad we have another opportunity to rank and talk about Carole king, though a wish Joni Mitchell was part of this rate too!

**sarcasticsobs** (10): absolute banger

**Stryxen** (10): groundbreaking... earthmoving even

**waluigiest** (10): stunning intro to one of the best albums ever

**seanderlust** (9.7): something about this song is just such a winner for me. the driving energy, the sweet lyrics, the piano and guitar interplay....carole king more like carole queen.

**team\_kockroach** (9.5): Did anyone else notice that Fiona Apple ripped this off to make “Criminal”?

**bulforster** (9): (#8) I was confused how this won a rate when I first heard it but it's a huge grower, helps that Carole King is one of the best songwriters ever.

**cremeebrulee** (9): this is genuinely a bop but youngheads will slaughter this

**CrimsonROSET** (9): Everytime I put one of these on YouTube, I got scared when a Glee! cover hopped on. This one was fine! But I still got scared!

**lIIustration** (9): I was moved

**quinnpsych** (9): This song is underrated and punchy as hell. Still remember Mary Gilbeaux's audition of this song from American Idol though which is triggering.

**WeastofEden44** (8.9): Me getting topped within an ich of my life by the hot guy I talk to from time to time:

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): it's a great song that holds up fairly well against the heavy hitters of the rate, unfortunately it will probably leave quickly

**akanewasright** (8.5): It’s Too Late should have won this rate, but this is still a wonderful song from a perfect album.

**cocosairdep** (8.5): I never heard this one before, but I loved it. I really need to check out Tapestry.

**kappyko** (8.5): with all due respect to oldies there were like 5 better songs in its rate alone but when she gets going near the end its like the entire studio lights on fire

**welcometoNY** (8.5): the vocal production leaves a lot to be desired. i know it's probably done intentionally, but it's still bad.

**1998tweety** (8): she's cute

**anothertown** (8): I have too much goodwill toward this woman for writing like 4 of the precious few songs I will love for my entire life to not score this highly

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I feel like I have been looking for this chorus for my entire life, and it's actually from CAROLE KING HERSELF? Wow we stan.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): classic but just not a favorite of mine here

**mysario** (8): classic rock queen

**ryokann** (8): mary guilbeaux

**steelstepladder** (8): This is day one bound ain't it

**TiltControls** (8): I like Carole King, but I never got the hype behind this song over her others

**zadooi** (8): I was wondering where I had heard this song before and of course it was Glee.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (7.5): she has better songs

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Snapage.

**aresthormars** (7): Great lyrics! "When I see your face mellow as the month of May oh darling I can't stand it" Chef kisses!

**Roxieloxie** (7): is may really a mellow month?

**runaway3212** (7): Carole King honestly never clicked for me.

**SmileAndTears** (7): Not a big fan of this tbh. Reminds me a bit of Fiona Apple and I didn't like her last album

**succulentils** (7): First time hearing this song since Kimberly Caldwell sang it on American Idol

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): white people really just do be dancing to this

**Tolk1en** (7): a bit repetitive but still a quite entertaining song

**twat\_brained** (7): stan Mary loach

**worlds-okayest666** (7): wanna like this more than i do :/ still good tho

# Young people and also joshually

**InternetDude19** (6.5): When did popheads rate Carole King? and why?

**RandomHypnotica** (5.7): I do like this song, but in a rate like this, it's just doesn't stand up as well

**moonagenightmares** (5.2): this sounds like its from the 50s and it would’ve been boring even then

**Frelock\_** (5): A Classic but not something I actively seek out to listen to

**ManofOranges** (5): Sorry to Carole King and any of the older folks who stan this song, I'm sure it could bring the house down in 1971, but I'm thoroughly whelmed with this song. The Earth is not really moving under my feet, maybe a few pebbles or something

**CarlieScion** (4): she sounds like she hasnt cleared her throat in 10 years

**joshually** (4): I don’t deny she is a great songwriter… but… her vocals leave me wanting more.. or autotune

**vayyiqra** (4): I wish I liked this more than I do

**PuggleMaster** (3): I'm sorry but I really didn't like this song or how dated it sounded (It was so muffled which comes with the age of the song :l)

**starlitsuns** (2): I really don't know how to feel about this? It just isn’t for me, I guess.

> I knew that there was a strong possibility that Pompeii would win, but I'm glad it didn't have a clear cut path. With day 3 of this rate consisting of  80% ties, the competition was fierce COVID became classified as a global pandemic in the middle of this rate and I think the way this song has a certain feeling of uncertainty and question was very fitting as we all found ourselves in new places due to lockdown.“How am I gonna be an optimist about this” was a very fitting mood, and i’d say that pompeii was a very fitting winner. - /u/Roxieloxie

---

I used to dislike this song in high school, but after observing how the world can come crashing down pretty easily when in the face of a disaster this year, I do find this a teensy bit more relatable than I would like! Bastille was onto something; sometimes you really do just have to close your eyes to keep yourself from spiraling out of control. I still don't find myself particularly in love with this song; the omnipresence of "Happier" over the past few years made me a little less keen on Dan Smith's voice, and the "eh-oh" hook now just reminds me of [those USAA commercials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O338MdsOtJk). But I won't begrudge Bastille for making it here and for doing pretty decently, as they arguably have the most timely song for this year in this rate.

**fishingfor8** (11): How am I gonna be an optimist when this song is voted out day 1. This song and band basically defined a decade for me, I have to choose this.

letsallpoo: # Optimists

**aestheticen** (10): He was right. How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

**aresthormars** (10): Clearly the choir vocals singing the Latin of the statement "Oh No!" deserves the ten already!

**bigbigbee** (10): This is a song that you can daydream to. It’s perfect.

**camerinian** (10): how is it even possible for a drum fill to be one of the catchiest melodies in this rate, there is literally no melody to it

**CarlieScion** (10): EH EH EH EHO! they spilled

**frogaranaman** (10): this song is highkey genius

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Wow a song about an apocalypse happening and wondering how we can be better than it, i wonder why i love this in 2020. Anyways, this was always a fucking iconic song.

**joshually** (10): this is my first time hearing this song. IT’S REALLY GOOD?????????????

**moonagenightmares** (10): when i heard this as a kid i thought they were chanting a slur

**mysario** (10): what can't be understated are how great these drums are and how well they carry the song

**Roxieloxie** (10): oh hey this one won my rate. Towards the end of the due date for the mens rate this started getting lower scores cause of covid (apparently this was too depressing and timely) so im interested to see how it will do here. Anyways stream Doom Days and Wild World on spotify

**runaway3212** (10): This song really changed how I looked at pop music even though it's not really pop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i give this song a kiss

**TiltControls** (10): I wish Bastille was able to get more hits in the US (that aren't named Happier- I hate that song), cause they really deserve it

**twat\_brained** (10): I can't believe I'm saying this but I think I actually might miss hearing this on the radio in the front seat with my dad during winter 2014 on our drive home

**welcometoNY** (10): my score is probably colored by the nostalgia i feel for that brief period of time where indie pop songs could beome hits, but what about it

**worlds-okayest666** (10): im gonna be 80 with dementia and still know the chorus to this by heart

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): will be robbed this this rate cause it’s a men group and I’ll be mad

**nooodisaster** (9): Imagine sitting on this song for THREE SINGLES before releasing it... I don't know if that's power or stupidity, but I do know this song is a BANGER.

**pat-rickstar** (9): It does slap but the level of quality in this rate prevents me from scoring it higher

**PuggleMaster** (9): This song takes me back to when i was happy with life, which in turns just makes me more depressed :)

**starlitsuns** (9): I’m a sucker for that one phase in 2013-2014 where folk and rock music were all over the Hot 100 (or at least on the pop radio stations) and this reminds me of those vibes.

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): Aww I had to perform this song for my music class in high school so I have some fond memories of this. Also played this to get hyped the day before I visited Pompeii, so this song just radiates good vibes.

**seanderlust** (8.9): https://ozzyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Untitled.png <- that's how you be an optimist about this.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Massive bop

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Trashing that OneRepublic album was fun! We should do that again sometime.

**jsonphile** (8.5): unfortunately a very fitting song for 2020. Really how am I gonna be an optimist about this?

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Bop but his vocals are kinda meh

**Stryxen** (8.5): 13 year old me seeing me not give this my 11 is raging right now

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.1): banger

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): My opinon of this song definitely went down with time, it really sounds dated now

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Wow, I was so obsessed with this song. I still enjoyed this song because the verses were strong. Such a shame that the chorus felt lacking for some reason so I am deducting one point for it.

**intheaftermath** (8): I was going through a middle school existential crisis when this song was climbing the charts. Good song to worry to

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): Dan Smith is hot

**kirby31200** (8): I certainly think its good but I'm not nearly as attached to it as I am to other Bastille songs. Stream VS. (Other People's Heartache Part III)

**ManofOranges** (8): Such a monolithic-feeling song, gotta love it

**sarcasticsobs** (8): the chorus is so so fun, especially right when it comes in

**waluigiest** (8): honestly it bops I cant deny it. This in the og rate was maybe the least passionate 11 I’ve ever given lol

**wavingwolves** (8): i know this isn't making past day 1 but maybe it should

**WeastofEden44** (8): When I took AP World History, my teacher would constantly play this song and this would come on like every class. Thus, whenever I hear this song, I think of the Mongols.

**ReallyCreative** (7.7): justice for Bad Blood

**bbfan132** (7): i loved this back in 2013 but now it’s just pretty good to me

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Oh, it's *that* song. Ok.

**Frelock\_** (7): Background singers really make it

**hikkaru** (7): imagine dragons was robbed idc idc idc

**kappyko** (7): its good.....

**lIIustration** (7): Radio/Mall music, but above average

**skargardin** (7): bop

**succulentils** (7): You know, it's been such a long time since I last heard this that it no longer annoys me as much

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): when this song came out I really thought people were gonna change their Facebook profiles to photoshopped filters of themselves entombed in ash to remember the people lost in pompeii :(

**vayyiqra** (7): This is very "early 2010s indie revival"-core but it's not bad

# Realists

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): The lyrics are so good here, but I never really liked the monk chants that everyone seemed to love in this song… sorry

**PointlessBibliophage** (6.5): y'all really robbed onerepublic for this huh

**ktajlili** (6): Fine song, but it was really overplayed on my local radio. It's not bad, just okay.

**racloves** (5): loved it when it came out but it hit overplayed tbh

**raicicle** (5): I sang this acapella in a school singing competition once and have been traumatised since

**steelstepladder** (5): Ehhhhh I've always wanted to like Bastille songs more than I do.

**anothertown** (4): How am I gonna be an octopus about this

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): This didn’t deserve to win its rate, it’s just noise. I hate this guy’s voice and the mindless, droning production, but I do have to give points for originality because it is unique I guess (though not in the scope of their discography). I’ll always associate this song with “Safe and Sound” by Capital Cities (I might be messing up the timeline but they were big around the same time, right?) due to the similar lyrical themes and musical structures and that song just walks all over this one with six inch heels.

**bulforster** (3.4): (#36) Kinda slaps, but these lyrics feel a bit hollow.

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): ashy like the real pompeii

# is this a bad thing?

**quinnpsych** (6): This song used to be the theme song of a group of kids at my high school for their minecraft youtube channel, so I can't hear the start of this song without thinking about some awful minecraft content

For a song that's become the defining soundtrack for one of the best-selling game consoles of all time, there's not a whole lot of information online about the song. It appears to have been composed by Kazumi Totaka, who you might know for voicing Yoshi, and for [hiding melodies in many soundtracks he's worked on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gsqD-8dYcs). And...that's basically all that I can find on it! There's the obvious information, like how this basic, looping melody plays as you designed little Mii characters, but if you were an adolescent in the late 2000s, you probably know about how that works.

This song's sheer omnipresence as a cultural force is the largest factor into it becoming a meme — anything that gets popular enough inevitably spawns humorous takes on it. But there's still a great little song at the core of it. The song plays with a simple violin and the blippy boops of a synth, like a delicate balance between the old and the new that perfectly encapsulates the charm of the Wii system. It's relaxing despite being relatively upbeat, making it ideal for the simple but slow process of crafting the perfect Mii. If anything, this should be higher — not just because it's a fun meme and y'all seem to hate fun way too much, but because it is genuinely an excellent composition that has withstood the test of time.

**cremeebrulee** (11): i wasn’t fucking joking

**frogaranaman** (11): generation defining

**ImADudeDuh** (11): I would never lie

**jackisboredtoday** (11): I maintain that the Wii Shop Channel Theme should have been chosen instead, but I just got extremely lucky & won a switch lite literally the day I filled out this rate so I guess this is my 11 now

**pat-rickstar** (11): Imagine if this actually wins! I'd better see 11s across the board for this timeless classic aka the M11 Channel Theme

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Anyone who gave this a 10 is a coward, and they know it. I'm also going to use this opportunity to recommend some other incredible Wii OS bops such as Submission Plaza Theme, Contest Winner Parade and The Everybody Votes Channel Main Theme

**Roxieloxie** (11): if im the only 11 for this song im gonna be so mad

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): this is in ironically the best instrumentation in this entire rate, I literally used to leave the shop on in the background as a child and for that, this is the only good piece of music to ever be recorded. Thank you

**zadooi** (11): Yes it's a meme song, but it's a meme song that slaps. Next question.

letsallpoo: # Nintendivas

**1998tweety** (10): main pop girlies

**bbfan132** (10): excellence but will be robbed

**bluehxrizon** (10): what rate did this win wtf

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the power that that has

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I feel bad betraying the M11 Channel Theme squad, but I think it'll get enough representation.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I took a break from listening to the Spotify playlist just to listen to the provided YouTube link. Girl, why is it the 10-hour version? 💀Anyways, I am giving this an ironic 10 but we all know the Wii Shop Channel music is superior.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is an unironic ten. I’ve always absolutely adored the aesthetic of the Wii/Mii era, the imagery of all of these polygonal people and places just rising out of the sterile white void fascinates me in a way I can’t really explain, I had several of the generic Wii games like Wii Sports Resort or Wii Play and I would spend hours poking around in them intentionally ignoring the gameplay and exploring as much of the edges of these worlds as I could, hoping to uncover some kind of secret I never did find. The unique “elevator music for the entire universe” sound of the Mii theme is a huge part of this appeal, despite being glorified muzak it’s instantly distinctive (like, can you think of any actual music that really sounds like this?) and memorable and it sets the tone perfectly. I’m so pleased it’s gotten a second life as a piece of meme music so it can live beyond the now tragically discontinued Wii.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): listen I know we said M11 and I swear I was going to but then I saw D1sco T1ts and all bets were off. The mii theme has had it's time, it's the darling of drama channels on youtube and we all know it by heart. It's time for someone else to take the crown

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the greatest rate winner of all time

**J\_Toe** (10): not on spotify but still an icon. Love the Wii Sports version of Hotline Bling

**kirby31200** (10): Unironically amazing soundtrack

**ManofOranges** (10): Watching this win the meme rate was so gratifying to me, especially since I had switched my 11 to this song like not too long before the reveal had started. Truly one of the most correct rate winners we've ever had. I'd love to see this win again, although this sub hates fun so I'm hesitant to think that it's gonna happen.

**Mudkip1** (10): pop perfection

**mysario** (10): I'm sorry for not being part of the M11 Channel gang

**nootnoot781** (10): which rate did this win? oh this rate

**racloves** (10): my ex used to play this on piano

**raicicle** (10): honestly completely unironically a 10 for the cultural impact and how quirky a tune it is

**ReallyCreative** (10): unironically hope this wins

**skargardin** (10): An 11 contender, period!!

**steelstepladder** (10): Barely missed my 11

**Stryxen** (10): bum🤔 ba 😒bum 🤤bum🥴 ba 😝 bap 🙄 bap 😏 bap 😐 BAP 🥰 BAP 😶 BAP🤭

**suhonyu** (10): iconic childhood song and the memes further prove it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): have any of YOUR faves ever sold 101.63 million units worldwide? didn’t think so

**TiltControls** (10): Nintendo showing us why Nintendoes what Segcan't.

**twat\_brained** (10): Look, I can't be mad if this wins. I can't help but wonder

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): great childhood memories <3

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): I swear if this wins I won’t even be mad it lowkey bops hard

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9.9): iconic but Nintendo doesn't use it anymore

**InternetDude19** (9.5): Iconic. One of the most memorable and satisfying melodies in modern music.

**jasannn** (9): I have traveled back into time to 2007.

**sandyfishnets** (9): The Sims theme is better

**waluigiest** (9): honestly it’s just a good samba, love it

**WeastofEden44** (9): This is better than any of the production SOPHIE has ever done

**camerinian** (8): Wii Shop Channel literally outsold, maybe if the Mii Channel had microtransactions it wouldn’t have flopped #periodt

**fadedblue09** (8): I feel like this won’t need my help this time but we’ll see.

**Frelock\_** (8): Instantly memeable easy listening.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): *banging head*

**slimboyfriend** (8): anybody who scores lower than this song should quit music I say as I give this song a higher score than at least 8 songs on here

**wavingwolves** (8): omg look it's the winner

**worlds-okayest666** (8): normally a meme song in an actual serious rate would be an automatic zero for me but like...this is so fun i can’t do it!!

**cocosairdep** (7): Main pop girl Nintendo!

**jsonphile** (7): just not sure how to really rate this compared to￼, well, real songs

**static\_int\_husp** (7): the fact that i'm giving this a better score than some other winners really says a lot

**AtomicViolet** (6.9): Haha memes I'm laughing so hard right now /s Honestly though why is this so catchy?

# i hate that i know what this is referring to

**hunnybee12** (6): i associate this with beauty guru drama now it’s ruined for me

# #FreeMelee #SaveSmash

**hikkaru** (6): it's a classic yes but idk i just can't rate it higher than this lol

**seanderlust** (6): head empty. no thoughts.

**starlitsuns** (6): Sure, this is nostalgic, but is it really that worthy of y’all’s 11s?

**vayyiqra** (6): Kind of catchy but there are so many bettter meme songs

**bulforster** (5): (#28) This song's placement is what I'm most excited for in the whole reveal.

**InfernalSolstice** (5): why

**intheaftermath** (5): It's alright filler music, but there are better Nintendo selections. Anyways stream Pokémon Black and White Team Plasma Grunt Theme.

**JunkyGS** (5): I don’t trust y’all to not over rate this

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): it’s cute

**nooodisaster** (5): I just realized Take On Me probably wasn't the Meme Rate song...

**joeeswift** (4): the nostalgia :0

**CarlieScion** (3): this gonna be higher than some actual songs. im mad.

**PuggleMaster** (3): Definitely thought it was fun. I liked the beat

**aestheticen** (1): i can't appreciate this unironically i'm sorry 😭

**bespectacIed** (1): Y'all are so corny for making this win lmao. Incel humor

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): Just making sure it doesn't somehow win again. It's cute and all, but come the fuck on, this should never be winning this rate.

**joshually** (1): why is this in this rate…?

**moonagenightmares** (1): i hate video games #jock

**SmileAndTears** (1): No <3

**team\_kockroach** (1): This isn’t music, this is a one-note punchline to a meme.

**welcometoNY** (1): i hate y'all so much

**akanewasright** (0): I’m betting this is gonna put me on someone’s list

**kappyko** (0): I HATE POP HEADS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**moooo566** (0): it feels dumb to throw a zero at a joke but it's not even a funny one. it's not even cool music either. no redeeming features.

**runaway3212** (0): Fuck this stupid fucking song

> Taylor finally did it, and narrowly too. The rate itself was just an odd experience to look back on, and the song itself is even stranger in the context of this rate. I wasn't told the positions of the songs, but I would definitely not be surprised if this is out late day one or early day two. It's shocking that the song won to begin with, a ballad from a country album that wasn't a single managed to win, plus that shit is looooooooong

> The song itself though is a masterpiece, and it actually increased in its overall rank of Taylor's songs in the most recent Top Ten Pop Ten, up to #5 overall in her discography. The opening lines are smooth like butter, and it is a song that I think is going to be hurt by her re-recordings. A lot of the album, Speak Now, benefits from being self-written, and also being sung and performed in a vocal phase that was starting to mature from her Fearless sound, but still had tinges of sharper inflections and sharper tones. That sound from her voice really fleshed out the emotion of the song, and it felt like an even more vivid painting of a Romeo & Juliet love story, moreso than Love Story itself. 

> It's a perfect storm of youth, longing, intellect, and emotion that make this slow-burner of a ballad resonate with so many, and why it is being rated again here. - /u/wailord_fan

---

Can you believe that out of Taylor's [105 fucking songs we've rated](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard#wiki_most_songs_rated), this is the only one to actually win? I mean, that's one more than I honestly thought she would have (and she only made it here by less than a point over a mediocre Carrie Underwood song), but still! And she did way worse in this rate than I expected, too; she never once crossed out of day 1 territory as the results were coming in. People would be handing out 9s and 10s to everything else, only to smack Taylor with a 5 and a disparaging comment. Where did her fans go? I guess it's true that all Swifties do is doxx people, abandon her in rates, eat hot chip, and [lie](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/jrp9b6/esquire_three_years_after_reputation_its_time_to/).

That all being said, "Enchanted" is easily one of Taylor's best songs, and a deserving representation of her work in this rate. Taylor has long been a reactive artist, and I buy into the idea that after people doubted her songwriting craft after her AOTY win for "Fearless," she went out of her way to pen an entire album by herself to really show off her abilities. It paid off, and "Enchanted" is the biggest gem of the album, Apparently written about Adam Young, AKA the Owl City dude, it details the tumulting emotions that come when you meet someone so alluring for the first time — someone so spellbinding that it renders your entire night bright and sparkly. It's a power ballad that still holds up, and it represents a unique phase in her career right as she was on the cusp of going full-on pop star.

letsallpoo: # please do not send me death threats

**1998tweety** (10): rigga morris but I must admit this does deserve a 10

**aresthormars** (10): There is something enchanting from the production of this song. At the same time, great lyricism from Taylor!

**bbfan132** (10): i was enchanted to give this a 10

**CarlieScion** (10): 2 AM WHO DO U LOVE!!!!!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): GOD POPHEADS PLEASE DON'T FUCKING PUT THIS BEAUTIFUL SONG ABOUT HAVING A CRUSH ON ADAM YOUNG OUT OF DAY 1. But for real, I kinda wish this isn't the only Taylor song in this rate. :( Don't worry, folklore is going to dominate the 2020 Main Pop Girls rate.

**hikkaru** (10): not to be a swiftie but yeah

**hunnybee12** (10): in middle school I loved this song so much I would write out the lyrics to this over and over again with different color markers in class

**InfernalSolstice** (10): third choice 11

**InternetDude19** (10): This is one of her best songs.

**intheaftermath** (10): Speak Now is such an incredible album, and was my first concert ever. I love this song beyond belief, I just know its rerecording will sound even better

**kirby31200** (10): I really did not expect to love this as much as I do. I love the passion and intensity. Good reminder that I still need to listen to folklore.

**lIIustration** (10): surprised this is the Taylor song here but she just sounds so good

**ManofOranges** (10): I find it funny that the only Taylor song to ever win a rate is one from a more country-oriented album of hers, and it won because of the very last ballot. In such a seemingly swiftian sub, Taylor definitely doesn't have a lot of favoritism when it comes to rates. Anyways, I know this song isn't gonna do well.

**pat-rickstar** (10): I can see why this is a fan favourite Taylor song

**runaway3212** (10): It pains me to not give this an 11, but for what it is worth this song isn't even the best on speak now and in any other rate if this was her only song I would've given this an 11.

**welcometoNY** (10): it pains me not to be giving Taylor my 11, but when the song in question is so middle-of-the-road in terms of her discography, i have no choice. i still think it's a brilliant song but she literally has a hundred better ones. i guess there's no accounting for (popheads') taste.

**camerinian** (9.5): fuck maybe i do need to listen to the rest of those fan favourite Taylor singles, I had no expectations for this but wow

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Tbh, I still don’t get why Swifties unanimously consider this to be the best song on Speak Now, but I do like it a fair bit, so...it's good, I guess? (curious to see where this will place tho).

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): Any song that's 6 minutes and is still enjoyable by the end is an accomplishment

**twat\_brained** (9.4): the first time I heard this was when I heard it mashed up with Wildest Dreams. I hardly remembered hearing this because I was just on my toes the whole concert waiting to hear Wildest Dreams. I now regret sleeping on this song; it's quite beautiful. Wait, I just realized, is the "this is me trying" lyric what Taylor alludes to on Folklore? Damn, she's clever.

**chillbumps5** (9): i despise the instrumentals and production on this album but this song is undeniably good

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Last Kiss is better than this, but it's incredible nonetheless.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): this song is a journey

**SmileAndTears** (9): Bop

**TragicKingdom1** (9): if any taylor song had to be a rate winner im glad its this one tbh

**worlds-okayest666** (9): still baffles me that this is about the owl city guy

**jsonphile** (8.5): Back to December is the best song from Speak Now, but this is a close second I guess

**nooodisaster** (8): Not this being the only song on Speak Now to feature a co-writer so I can't drop my "Taylor Swift, at 19, wrote a self-written album, at 19 years of age, at only 19, written just by her" fact. A losing today :(

**Roxieloxie** (8): I am not a taylor swift fans by any means, however,, I ran an Owl City/Adam Young tumblr in 2013(hoot owls sound off) so I am very well aware of this song. The high score isnt really for the song itself but more so for Adams response and how beautiful it was

**sarcasticsobs** (8): never heard this (not sarcastic). miles better country than than bro-pop country (not sarcastic). this taylor swift might be good! (sarcastic)

**seanderlust** (8): that "please don't be in love with someone else" part is super cute. think what you want to think about t swift, but when she's on her lyrical A game, it's unmatched.

**skargardin** (8): cute

**waluigiest** (8): I have to admit I was surprised when this won. It’s good and it’s cute, but I don’t think it’s close to the best of the rate, or even the best on Speak Now. The chorus does really slap tho

**Stryxen** (7.9): this song shouldn’t be as likeable as it is

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): i can't believe out of all the Taylor songs that almost one, this is the only one that actually did it

**suhonyu** (7.5): disney channel teas, i woulda picked any other song from this album tbh

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I'm surprised Taylor doesn't do longer songs often. She's a good fit for them.

**Frelock\_** (7): The music doesn't do anything crazy interesting, but the lyrics are pretty inspiring.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this song is fine but it drags so much more than it should.

**joshually** (7): a cute song

**PuggleMaster** (7): I'd probably enjoy this more if I could listen to it a few more times.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): all rise for the white girl anthem

**vayyiqra** (7): :pensivetaylor:

**wavingwolves** (7): soundtrack of my teenage relationships

# please do not send these people death threats

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.9): https://i.imgur.com/NWWFoDb.png

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.8): the 1989 version is better because it goes into a better song

**team\_kockroach** (6.5): I can’t help but think many of Taylor’s “intimate, folksy ballads” pre-Red have been completely outshadowed by the ballads on Red, Folklore, and even Lover to an extent. Enchanted is a perfect example of this - the sentiment is there, but her quivering low vocals and sparse instrumentals aren’t good enough to carry the rest of the song.

**TiltControls** (6.5): There was better on the album

**raicicle** (6): owl city won

**bulforster** (5.4): (#26) I really like this but it is quite overblown.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This is possibly the rate winner I have the most negative feelings towards, there were SO MANY good songs in this rate that would have made for amazing winners and y’all selected… this? I can’t bring myself to hate it as a song because it is decently cute but like all of the songs on this album it’s just too damn long and not consistently interesting.

**J\_Toe** (5): was not expecting this to be the Taylor song in the rate, she really does get relegated to #2 on these rates, huh?

**kappyko** (5): cannot fucking believe this is about owl city

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): if i had to choose a taylor swift song i actually liked, this song would be up there as far as songs that i don't hate. i'm not trying to get doxxed swifties, don't come for me.

**ReallyCreative** (5): I think the most obnoxious thing about Swifties, besides maybe the doxxing, is their insatiable desire to choose Taylor's most mediocre songs and be so damn loud about them.

**steelstepladder** (5): Taylor has better

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i mean it sure is a 6 minute long taylor swift song

**fishingfor8** (3): I still have a knee jerk hate for any Taylor before Red

**mysario** (3): I forgot to do this rate until it was too late but spoilers - "Blown Away" would have won if I submitted

**anothertown** (2): this was one of 5-6 songs that played at the movie theater where I worked in my hometown.. it was over before it began miss sift

**plastichaxan** (2): why is this so boring and it just kept going:sob: she has way better songs

**zadooi** (2): This song has no business being more than three minutes long.

**selegend** (1): snooze

**bespectacIed** (0): Gag. Literally, not the gay lingo. This song is so gross :( I always scoff at fans who oversell T's songwriting skills (btw she writes super well 60% of the time, i give her that) when that very fanbase thinks one of her best songs is this ... this 6th grade diary entry

> In between FROOT and L+F Marina lost her way a bit. In a search to become a more "serious" artist she forwent what made up her artistic palette in the first place. The title track from her most consistent project, FROOT, is a wonderful midpoint. Popheads certainly agreed when it blasted far ahead of little Miss Reycist and Miss Florence. FROOT's mature disco-pop direction pairs so well with its nonsense lyrics, so nonsensical and corny that it becomes pure bliss. Honestly I'm unsure how this will fair in the winners rate, and that's okay, cause Marina has never been defined by her, erm, numbers, but instead her bold artistic decisions that make FROOT one of her most defining songs. - /u/Therokinrolla

---

Oh Marina, good on you for making it into another one of these winners rates — and for beating out Florence again! Marina gets a lot of flack these days for being poor or something, but I've always liked her wistful brand of alternative pop that the *Froot* era really built up. The title track here is extravagant and playful, with perhaps the sexiest use of the word "cauliflower" ever, and I believe represents the epitome of what's made Marina and her music endearing. It's long and slow, but when compared to artists like Lana or Florence, I appreciate how ready Marina is to not take herself too seriously.

[/r/popheads/comments/k27cgq/the_winners_rate_ii_reveal_day_1_do_the_mens_rate/gdt2tlt/]

=====

letsallpoo: # stream man's world

**1998tweety** (10): bop, make sure to stream Man's World!!!

**anothertown** (10): You can’t say it didn’t transcend

**aresthormars** (10): Very groovy track of FROOT. Also one of my faves!

**bbfan132** (10): her best song, hopefully it doesn’t flop

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The Froot era was my Marina staining at its peak.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I liked this one when we initially rated it but as time has gone on I’ve come to REALLY like it! The way she combines themes of youth, time, beauty, and consumption, implying that her sexuality and her appeal are inextricably linked to time and that she’ll rot if someone doesn’t claim her but to claim her is to consume her and leave her broken regardless, and then to play these ideas out against a relentlessly cheerful and almost nauseatingly sweet musical backdrop… it’s very interesting and it always gets the wheels in my head turning.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): talented, brilliant, etc

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Marina said stream Juice and I agree. But side note the more I’ve listened to this song, the more it’s grown on me

**lIIustration** (10): such dreamy product

**ManofOranges** (10): It's kind of an enthralling track, honestly. Poor Florence keeps having to lose to Marina but at least she's lost to songs like Froot, which are honestly quite good.

**moooo566** (10): hard to believe this isn't my eleven

**PuggleMaster** (10): Marina really called out all the gays with the opening of this song. Was never that big of a fan of Marina until I heard the opener to this song.

**runaway3212** (10): Froot is what all popgirlies aspire to be

**skargardin** (10): One of her best vocal performances for sure

**twat\_brained** (10): I'm not as *familiar* with this as other Marina tunes😊I do wish the music video length matched the song's length, however. Am I alone in thinking this is Marina's best song?

**vayyiqra** (10): A horny bop, a highlight of her career. Seeing her do this song live was :flushed:

**waluigiest** (10): the lead up to this era as SO exciting to little gay me

**worlds-okayest666** (10): if marina told me to lay on train tracks id do it

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9.5): seeing this live 2x was incredible

**kirby31200** (9): I couldn't stand this song on first listen but now I love it.

**pat-rickstar** (9): I've never really listened to Marina before but this is really good

**sarcasticsobs** (9): just always a delight

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): DAE disco???????

**WeastofEden44** (8.7): This froot DOESN'T look familiar cuz this is the first time I've ever paid attention to this song

**seanderlust** (8.5): this one is gonna be done dirty, I feel it in my rattling bones.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): What Kind Of Man lets this song win?

**mysario** (8): predicted Juice

**ReallyCreative** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72g2b0xtXQk

**wavingwolves** (8): i love the many metaphors for pussy this song has

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): a real familiar fruit moment

**Stryxen** (7.1): and this beat all of how big how blue beautiful :/… how bad, how boring... how bitter from me – its pretty good and I like how expensive this song sounds lol


# marina [REDACTED]

**CrimsonROSET** (7): Everyone wants a familiar froot moment, I guess.

**SmileAndTears** (7): I don't care for this

**Frelock\_** (6): Classic melody scheme sort of deal. Very 80s reminiscent.

**nooodisaster** (6): 60% froot juice

**starlitsuns** (6): This didn’t need to be nearly 6 minutes long.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): I’m sorry I just never got this song… Marina has good music but I never thought this was it

**ImADudeDuh** (5.1): the best thing about it is that it gave us Marina dragging Charli

**camerinian** (5): I don't get the appeal of Marina and I don't think I ever will. This isn't a bad cut by any means but it really pales in comparison to basically everything else on this list

**InfernalSolstice** (5): marina has never rlly interested me beyond the family jewels

**steelstepladder** (5): Thats not how you spell fruit silly

**suhonyu** (5): prefer her earlier eras

**Roxieloxie** (4): why dose she sing like that

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): I just wanna let you all know that I’m very much pro universal basic income, I’m in favor of abolishing rent, and I very much want to eliminate the wealth gap, but Marina is not getting ANY of it, stay broke bitch

**CarlieScion** (3): i really hate this song. not even sorry. all the songs on electra heart and tfj outsold. even orange trees outsold

**fxsparrow** (3): I can't stand her voice

**kappyko** (3): Foot

**bulforster** (2.6): (#40) This song (and Marina in general) just never clicked for me and it goes on a bit too long.

**joshually** (2): I dunno honestly… it’s just… weird

**bespectacIed** (1): this sounds hideous y'all can't be serious about liking this .....

**fadedblue09** (0): Five minutes of hell, dear lord. In my years on this sub, I have never gotten the appeal of Marina. Literally everything about her is done better by her peers. People who stan her are the type to think that stanning flops make you look cool (spoiler: it doesn't). Now that we’ve ditched Tumblr, I hope we also do the same for her career as well.

**TiltControls** (0): wait this is what beat Florence? disservice to fruits from apple to bananas

> The early 2010s are, as I'm sure we've all heard a million times, a time period that a lot of this subreddit looks upon incredibly fondly, and that can definitely be credited to the loud and anthemic electronic dance production that backed a lot of the hits of that time period. The zeitgeist of EDM on the charts saw its peak around 2013, and it's within this year we can find Clarity, the winner of the EDM/Pop Girl Collaborations rate. While hosting this rate that included songs from 2009-2018, I was very much rooting for this to win out over Rather Be or any of the other more recent, more cleanly-produced songs due to it being one of the quintessential EDM classics from one of the biggest producers from that scene. With both longing vocals from Foxes but most importantly anthemic production from Zedd coating the track in a nostalgic melodrama, it provides a perfect summation of this era in pop music and why so many people look back at it in rose-tinted vision. - /u/hikkaru

---

Maybe if I were like most other Bay Area gaysians and went to raves I would have a deeper connection with this song, but as it stands it was more of an annoying pop radio hit from middle school that has aged ever so slightly better with time. Foxes puts on an amazing vocal performance, and Zedd's EDM beat that's free of ticking noises sounds quite fresh now that we know just how derivative he can be (when he's ripping off of Hilary Duff's husband Matthew Koma). This was the first sign of the EDM takeover in the world of pop music, a shift in sound that's still ongoing, and even though I would've preferred "Rather Be" to be here instead (although I'm glad it lost to "Touch" because lol why was that song even in that rate), I can't deny its impact and how it manages to capture the grandiose allure of EDM.

letsallpoo: # also banned from China

**aestheticen** (10): This is truly one of the best electronic tracks of all time

**anothertown** (10): Rocks my shit from second 1

**aresthormars** (10): This song is iconic for me. I miss this Zedd, the one who has no ticking clock and vocoder all the time.

**camerinian** (10): damn I love this MATTHEW KOMA feat Foxes song

**frogaranaman** (10): literally one of the best commercial house songs of all time and you can @me

**hunnybee12** (10): idc i love this so much

**ImADudeDuh** (10): why are people hating this song so much? More presst glynnecels i guess...

**jasannn** (10): I remember one time, my roommate singing this song at the top of his lungs in the shower and I've loved this song ever since.

**joshually** (10): god this gives me flashbacks to going to EDC dressed like a basic festival slut and being a young dumb ho… ugh I love it so much! Take me baaaaaack

**mysario** (10): reminder that this was an iconic moment in PH history - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV9WLxxGslQ&lc

**PuggleMaster** (10): Back when Zedd didn't make the same variation of the same song :heart_eyes: (No slander towards 365 and Never Really Over!)

**runaway3212** (10): Yes this deserved to beat Rather Be.

**starlitsuns** (10): The second song that got me into EDM (the first being We Found Love) so of course this gets the score it gets.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): the fact this one the edm rate is still the best moment in rate history goodbye clean bandit

**worlds-okayest666** (10): idk man i dont like zedd but this is such an undeniable classic and it gives me such nostalgia, i cant give this anything but a ten

**succulentils** (9.5): The only reason I'm not giving this a 10 is idk about these lyrics. Absolute banger though

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): Listening to Clarity gives me a painful flashback to when I had to make a mashup in highschool with absolutely 0 musical knowledge or technical ability (at the time), and I chose to put the lyrics of this over the instrumental of The Mother We Share and it didn't work at ALL, but I had literally no idea how to make it better

**ignitethephoenix** (9): still laughing at how sour some people are that this one over rather be, glyncels keeping suffering

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): this song came out the year or two after i graduated (i will not tell from what, back off) and i remember scream singing it from a sunroof because i was so excited and happy for once. it's a good song, it's great for pregaming and summer shenanigans.

**racloves** (9): foxes is so underrated

**vayyiqra** (9): Even though it's good I feel bad that this is the only song Foxes is known for (at least outside the UK) and that's too bad because she has lots of bops and is underrated as hell

**1998tweety** (8.5): Rather Be was ROBBED

**bbfan132** (8.5): still enjoyable 7 years later

**Stryxen** (8.5): had never heard this before and Zedd doesn’t really do it for me usually but Foxes sounds great and they complement each other surprisingly well

**suhonyu** (8.5): the edm collapse

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): To me this sounds very similar to a lot of songs from 2012 but it's still cute so

**welcometoNY** (8.4): it is very 2012, but i tend to think 2012 was the peak of music so i love that

**Frelock\_** (8): I am a sucker for a good choral background.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): I'm thankful for this song introducing me to Foxes

**jsonphile** (8): oh yeah there used to be a time when Zedd didn’t put the ticking clock sound into every song

**ManofOranges** (8): This is for Clarity you big fat annoying EDM sounding song why you took Rather Be off the motherfuckin number one spot with your trifflin nonsense-lyrics ass you big fat song oompa loompa sounding ass song I'm rating up there and I'm gonna beat the fuck out of you bitch and don't even call the rate hosts today cause I'm gonna come up there unexpected and wait on your motherfuckin ass flop I'm coming to beat the fuck out of you flop

**nooodisaster** (8): Me when this song came out: "Lmao these lyrics are so dumb no one actually feels like this."  Me now: *i'm in this photo and i don't like it*

**skargardin** (8): bop

**SmileAndTears** (8): The chorus doesn't sound complete? Idk, still a bop

**WeastofEden44** (8): This song is so good but also so dated

**CarlieScion** (7): i hate that this is foxes biggest hit

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): Eh. The song is good but I feel like I am the only one who wasn't feeling this song when this was popular.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): The drop of this song is so damn good but the rest of it is kinda empty?

**pat-rickstar** (7): Dated as hell but still kinda slaps (I also need to find a new way to describe songs I like other than "it slaps")

**sarcasticsobs** (7): personally been way over zedd for a long long time now but this is still fun

**steelstepladder** (7): A great song from the year of EDM. It's no Don't You Worry Child though

**twat\_brained** (7): "fuck Notch fuck Musk and I'll piss on Zedd" - Fraxiom & Gupi, 2020. Foxes is alright tho

# Jess Glynne stans (I will not use the other term)

**CrimsonROSET** (6.5): Rather Be sweetie I'm so sorry.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): okay this is one of those songs that occasionally HITS but this is not one of those times

**kirby31200** (6): I never really got this one. I think Foxes does an outstanding job but Zedd's production lets her down

**team\_kockroach** (6): This song is very much a mixed bag. Big, arena rock EDM drops have aged poorly, but the first minute of production still sounds great. Foxes’ vocals are great, but the lyrics kinda suck.

**seanderlust** (5.8): stay the night outsold

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Gets a pass because I love Foxes’ voice, but otherwise I’m happy this kind of music is dead.

**TiltControls** (5.5): I like the verses, but the chorus is kind of a mess

**ReallyCreative** (5): this song is SO out of place on this rate... the mediocrity JUMPED out

**selegend** (5): hasnt aged all that well but it’s iconic for sure

**waluigiest** (4): to me..... it’s kinda just dude edm

**bespectacIed** (3): basic but kinda an anthem. It beating Rather Be was a crime

**chillbumps5** (3): the drop ruins the song, like most edm songs

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): WHAT IS THIS LMAOOOOO

**nootnoot781** (2): rather be lost to THIS?????

**Roxieloxie** (2): the rather be/clarity switch up is the reason to this day i have trust issues when it comes to reveals

**bulforster** (1.4): (#46) This is just kind of soulless.

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): This is dreadful all the way through. The only good thing Zedd has ever contributed to is ARTPOP.

**kappyko** (1): I HATE U ZEDD!!!!!!

**moonagenightmares** (1): i actually got a headache listening to this song

**wavingwolves** (0): ah if giving this a 0 could save me from ever hearing it again

> This was the winner in the first rate I ever hosted and I cannot get over how iconic it was seeing Bleachers going from being slaughtered during the first two days, to winning the main, bonus and songeniality rates. The song itself has aged really well - it's the pinnacle of Jack's signature 80's synth-pop sound (yes, even more than Cruel Summer).  Also it was really fun to make [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc-xUYn4Kz0) video. - /u/CarlieScion

---

And so Jack Antonoff makes his departure from the rate, right on the cusp of day 2. Well, I guess "Supercut" is still in at least, so just like in real life, his production credits get far more acclaim than his actual solo projects. Go stream "Chinatown (feat. Bruce Springsteen)" to make up for that.

Speaking of Lorde, she also contributes backing vocals to this little ode to... *sigh* Lena Dunham, and I think even the faintest sound of her voice is responsible for at least a third of the total points /r/popheads gave the song. The rest of the points are because "Don't Take The Money" is an infectious bop, where Jack's synthwork is arguably at his best. It's bouncy and smooth and explosive right where it needs to be. While I do find his production work to be repetitive, and even on this track he does a lot of the same tricks he does on his other songs, it's still a treat to her an artist perfect the style that their career is built off of, and this song is no exception.

**CarlieScion** (11): still one of my favorite songs ever!!!!!

=====

letsallpoo: # the handful of people who enjoy Jack Antonoff when he's not producing tracks for female pop stars

**aresthormars** (10): This is Jack Antonoff and Lorde greatness!

**cremeebrulee** (10): if this isn't day 3 i will be throwing hands

**CrimsonROSET** (10): There are songs in this rate that are going to be robbed. Maybe the artist isn't that good outside this song, maybe the genre is just out of the ordinary for the regular pophead, maybe it's just too lost to time. But I see absolutely no reason for this song to go out at least before halfway through, but I don't trust popheads to carry through.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is definitely Jack Antonoff at his fucking best. I always knew Lorde was on the back-up vocals, but I finally heard her voice clearly with this headphone from JBL that I am wearing.

**hikkaru** (10): most of bleachers i dislike but this... this HITS even tho i would have preferred hard times x

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rFJuHw8zQ0iBkcYQNr6FABPvW0Rm4RW2/view

**Ionlywanttheworld** (10): the best song on both their albums

**lIIustration** (10): Great vibe

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is immaculate in my eyes so long as I ignore the fact that it's inspired by Lena Dunham. That's this song's only shortcoming, honestly

**mysario** (10): I still remember this rate and I still can't believe this won

**nooodisaster** (10): This song will be massacred. But I hope popheads just remembers who produced their favs most critically acclaimed albums they just can't stop praising (Melodrama, folklore, Lover, NFR!, etc.). Put some RESPEK on the name.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The best Bleachers song without a doubt, and frankly one of Jack's best songs all together

**ReallyCreative** (10): Gone Now has grown on me with time, and this song is actually just excellent! Release B3 Jack

**shhhneak** (10): Hearing this song live in a stadium would probably destroy me.

**skargardin** (10): but what a banger

**slimboyfriend** (10): it’s big and wistful and the only downside is that it’s probably about Lena Dunham

**starlitsuns** (10): another day 1 loss because men and especially Jack Antonoff but I love vibey indie rock songs like this okay

**steelstepladder** (10): Don't be rude to men pls

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I miss being in a popheads when this song dropped before Jack Antonoff divided us all as a nation 😞

**TiltControls** (10): Some of the best production of Jack's career.

**welcometoNY** (10): one of my favourite songs of all time, absolutely perfect in every way

**Stryxen** (9.6): I liked this song before I even knew who jack antonoff was also can someone please tell me why some people here hate jack antonoff so much

**bigbigbee** (9.5): My other favorite new discovery of the rate. Lorde’s sweet, soft vocals in the first part of the final chorus takes this song from great to outstanding.

**kappyko** (9.5): U STEAL THE AIR OUT OF MY LUNGS ETC.

**WeastofEden44** (9.2): This is if Maggie Rogers was a hipster male from Brooklyn and exclusively drank espresso

**1998tweety** (9): Love this, Lorde is in it just the perfect amount.

**jsonphile** (9): never heard this song or anything by this band before but I guess Jack Antonoff is just a musical genius

**quinnpsych** (9): Perfect singalong summer song for me

**seanderlust** (9): today we learned that that vocal affect he does at the end of lines in the pre-chorus is very hard to do well. oof. anyways, great song.

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): This is probably going to get demolished but you know if Antonoff produced this for Taylor or Carly we would all eat it up

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): JACK THAT CHORUS COULD'VE BEEN WAY MORE EXPLOSIVE

**engifear** (8.2): Lorde's backing vocals at the end really make the song.

**kirby31200** (8): This is certainly a good song but I'm also kind of like "yup that's a 2010s synthpop song alright"

**raicicle** (8): I’m not going to call this a classic compared to the rest of the songs in this rate but this is Bleachers’ best song

**suhonyu** (8): when in rome by the promise teas

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): will we fIGHT? stay up lATE? in my dREAMS i’m to bLAME different sIDES of the bED roll your eYES shake my hEAD

**vayyiqra** (8): Jackoff might not be a great singer but he is still my guy

**waluigiest** (8): why my girl Lorde on background vocals….

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.9): Jack Antonoff looks so punchable and I wish I could hate this but it’s actually pretty good. I get what Jack Antonoff means when he says he wants a female voice though, the whole time I was listening to this I was like “Betty Who would murder this track.”

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): it’s fine but not a standout here

**Roxieloxie** (7.3): hm this isnt "I Wanna Get Better' but I guess it's alright

**twat\_brained** (7.3): I can't believe this is the closest we'll get to a new Lorde song I miss you Ella ffs please come back so I don't have to pretend L^n^ D^nh^m deserves love songs written about her

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): this was originally gonna be my 0 but it's grown on me somehow

**bbfan132** (7): parts of this are good but it’s soooooo overproduced which is funny since jack antonoff is known for being a great producer

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): first time hearing this song and it’s actually pretty good

**bulforster** (6.8): (#19) This song is so good but Jack is slightly too understated as a singer to fully sell it for me.

# insert Lena Dunham joke here

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): There's nothing that kills a song for me more than a weak chorus. The other parts of this song deserve better than this.

**Frelock\_** (6): Don't know this one but seems nice

**ktajlili** (6): IDK. This sounds super generic and not that unique. I like the intensity, but overall find it disappointing, especially after finding out that it's Jack Antonoff, the person behind Melodrama, Norman Fucking Rockwell!, and some of the best songs off of Lover

**selegend** (6): the chorus is good

**wavingwolves** (6): not even lorde singing in this will save it from being a bottom 5 song (i still like it though)

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (6): lowkey I’m still salty that this won over all the songs on after laughter

**sandyfishnets** (5): Jack Antonoff is super talented but this song is too in your face at times.

**runaway3212** (4): Jack Antonoff only works when he works with more talented musicians

**plastichaxan** (3.5): Production is great but this was… something… bad

**fadedblue09** (3): I really don’t care about After Laughter that much so I don’t mind it losing to this. That being said, this isn’t really good either.

**fxsparrow** (3): It's a good song but I don't think Jack's voice does it justice. Should've let Lorde sing the whole thing.

**joshually** (3): I wasn’t feelin it….

**anothertown** (2): this sucks giant ass

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (2): I just find them really boring

**bespectacIed** (1): this is awful...

McIgglyTuffMuffin: I can’t believe I invested time and energy into rating these songs just for the results to look like this.

You all sicken me. 

None of you get dinner before bed. Just straight to bed. Don’t even care if the sun is still out.
