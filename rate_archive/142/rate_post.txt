> *You ready?*
>     
> *There’s someone I want you to meet. Her feet are wearing black Converse at all times. She’s sexy, playful, not like other girls, and free. She’s a modern girl in a band logo tee, in touch with her past and her future, conquering any boy (or girl) with a look of her bright, blue orbs. Her skin is glowing, her lovers are many, her bun is messy. She’s lived every life possible, multifaceted as they come. She has a million different personalities, one more intriguing than the other, and speaks to me like nothing else has before. I’m completely obsessed with her, and soon you will be too…*

Picture this…

The year is 2014. British youtubers are all the rage, *The Fault In Our Stars* movie marks the peak of John Green's popularity, the internet is going insane for *Anaconda* by Nicki Minaj, and *Wattpad* is doing better than it ever has, with stories featuring the aforementioned [Y/N], an acronym that invited you to fill in your own name so you could picture yourself as the protagonist of a love triangle between Justin Bieber and Logan Lerman or whatnot, filling the digital libraries of teenage girls and homosexuals all around the world.

We were entering the 4th year since the conception of *One Direction*, a band with a level of success we hadn’t seen from a teen group in years, maybe even a decade depending on how little credit you want to give *The Jonas Brothers* and *Big Time Rush*, and of course, record labels were scrambling to try to recreate the British boys’ success. Simon Cowell was able to do so with girl groups like *Little Mix* and *Fifth Harmony*, but the male side of things wasn’t doing too hot. *Union J* never made any noise, *Big Time Rush* got destroyed by 1D ([in their own tour, no less](https://www.j-14.com/posts/find-out-why-big-time-rush-hated-touring-with-one-direction-42341/)), and *The Wanted*, despite having various hits, never formed a firm fanbase. Lucky for fanfiction writers that needed side characters for their Dark Harry self-insert stories, *5 Seconds of Summer* and *The Vamps* were entering the scene in the early 2010s bringing their good looks, and romantic songs for you to build a parasocial relationship with them.


These 3 groups dominated fan spaces. You couldn’t go on Instagram without seeing a 1D fan edit, or a group of stans voting for 5SOS for some award on Twitter, or… well I guess you could go on the internet and not see The Vamps content, but nevertheless, they all put some great material in 2014, the peak of Tumblr culture, according to me, a guy that was 13 years old at the time and spent all of his days online.

If you’re already familiar with these groups and how rates work and want to skip this **lovely** writeup ^^rude , [here’s the submission link](https://tinyurl.com/YN2014) (and a [pastebin with the ballot form](https://pastebin.com/qgDJ79XK), in case the previous link doesn’t work).

[**FOUR**](https://open.spotify.com/album/4gCNyS7pidfK3rKWhB3JOY?si=7nXg6_TkRJ2JEBvbU6yTJA) by [*you_are_fireproof*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urtyrfz32jY)

`One Direction (Band)`

**No Archive Warnings Apply,** `Harry Styles`, `Niall Horan`, `Zayn Malik`, `Liam Payne`, `Louis Tomlinson`, 16 Songs, [Steal My Girl](https://youtu.be/UpsKGvPjAgw), [Ready to Run](https://youtu.be/eKLBiC-b3O0), [Where Do Broken Hearts Go](https://youtu.be/0Necz5glI4I), [18](https://youtu.be/VRpzJabYlQQ), [Girl Almighty](https://youtu.be/rPJU9bnfGgs), [Fool's Gold](https://youtu.be/7gK3QD2QSRo), [Night Changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syFZfO_wfMQ), [No Control](https://youtu.be/pW7W8hbdhX8), [Fireproof](https://youtu.be/_bXTbfnWPqk), [Spaces](https://youtu.be/K4e_0VvTqv0), [Stockholm Syndrome](https://youtu.be/nGYyTw9RIa8), [Clouds](https://youtu.be/VyotcwmZE3w), [Change Your Ticket](https://youtu.be/X5rnsL9vdE8), [Illusion](https://youtu.be/GbNqVNWydZg), [Once in a Lifetime](https://youtu.be/fPdaxcwhEag), [Act My Age](https://youtu.be/0wI4Ckiss6s), cozy, slight angst, foreshadowing, canon divergence, major character death

>British boy group *One Direction* need no introduction. After being formed in 2010 at UK version of *The X Factor*, they went onto become one of the most successful acts at the time.

>Between their fast paced schedule of yearly album releases, that without an exception was accompanied with an international promotional cycle and a world tour, and their rabid fanbase that dominated every online space during the early to mid 2010s, it was impossible to escape *One Direction*. This type of expeditious lifestyle could easily burn anyone out and start creating riffs between the members, thankfully, [the group didn’t have any issues similar to that](https://i.imgur.com/p0xxYoQ.png), and with the guys doing as good as ever, they started working on their 4th studio album, *FOUR*.

> The boys’ contribution to the writing credits in their first two albums were minimal to none. It wasn’t until *Midnight Memories*, their 3rd studio album, that we saw Louis and Liam become more prominent in the songwriting process, and that continued to be true for *FOUR*, with 10 out of the 16 songs having at least one of them credited as co-writer. The sound of their new album expanded upon the rock elements dabbled in *Midnight Memories*, but now fully emerging the songs with a more mature, 70’s/80’s inspired rock, often compared to Bruce Springsteen and *Journey*, in fact, as soon as it was released, *Steal My Girl* joined the ever-growing list of *One Direction* songs that got accused of ripping off an older song, this time being [*Journey*’s *Faithfully*](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/one-direction-steal-my-girl-new-found-glory-journey-6266683/).

>The album was released on November 17th, 2014 and it would enjoy great success, as all of the group’s albums seemed destined to do. It gave the band its 4th consecutive #1 album in the Billboard 100 chart, and it had enough longevity to barely squeeze into the US and UK’s decade-end top album lists, charting at [#200](https://www.billboard.com/charts/decade-end/billboard-200/) and [#100](https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uks-official-top-100-biggest-albums-of-the-decade-2010-2019__27937/) respectively. The singles *Steal My Girl* and *Night Changes* were also appreciated by the public, with both of them charting in the top 10 in the UK, and the latter track getting certified platinum in the US, however, if you ask me, I’d say that the true gems of this project are the deep cuts. From previous rate loser, *Fireproof*, to [secret vehicle for a Harry solo career](https://i.imgur.com/nvMAeNz.png), *Stockholm Syndrome*, to the single that never was, *No Control*, these album tracks; alongside a few other; show the group in a much more mature light that we’d even seen them before, and display their artistic growth in such a small stretch of time.

**[5 Seconds Of Summer](https://open.spotify.com/album/6GKIr03B2yvdP0TkWiGJVV?si=mBBzRcqDTfqzNOHAtSFj7g)** by *[five_sauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9sj6ZoKFtk)*

`5 Seconds Of Summer (Band)`

**No Archive Warnings Apply,** `Luke Hemmings`, `Calum Hood`, `Ashton Irwin`, `Michael Clifford`, 17 songs, [She Looks So Perfect](https://youtu.be/X2BYmmTI04I), [Don't Stop](https://youtu.be/MKfzMOC19Fc), [Good Girls](https://youtu.be/0FfG_5JBVBQ), [Kiss Me Kiss Me](https://youtu.be/fCrqm15fZ18), [18](https://youtu.be/nwGDtxTuzLU), [Everything I Didn't Say](https://youtu.be/T8uGxuzg7g0), [Beside You](https://youtu.be/-_qg6PIYgl8), [End Up Here](https://youtu.be/QByAuZgeCMo), [Long Way Home](https://youtu.be/4NYdq_zHjxM), [Heartbreak Girl](https://youtu.be/RLLEB4Ac3Hg), [English Love Affair](https://youtu.be/OqdDhauhL10), [Amnesia](https://youtu.be/DCCJCILiX3o), [Social Casualty](https://youtu.be/R7V_x1v9qvA), [Never Be](https://youtu.be/3XDMeamCX_A), [Voodoo Doll](https://youtu.be/RFx26uUsTH4), [Mrs All American](https://youtu.be/yykcKrnRj0k), [Lost Boy](https://youtu.be/gk9k0jCUadk), white boys punching holes in the walls, friendzone, [male promiscuity](https://www.tiktok.com/@yahzzle/video/7023050616691756293), product placement

> Australian band *5 Seconds Of Summer*; *5SOS* for short; formed by lead vocalist and guitarist Luke Hemmings, drummer Ashton Irwin, guitarist Michael Clifford, and eternal love of my life Calum Hood, was conceived in 2011. Just like every other musical act that debuted after 2009, they first started growing a fanbase by posting covers on Youtube, which gathered enough attention for them to sign a publishing deal, which allowed them to focus on writing their own songs. From there, they started releasing EPs and singles at a consistent rate, most notable of all being their breakout hit *Heartbreak Girl*, [the teenage boy equivalent to *You Belong With Me*](https://i.imgur.com/tbKAo2b.png), a song that would come off as cringey to anyone over the age of 19, but really resonated with those who would become their main fanbase; teenage girls that wanted an attractive, foreign-accented twink boyfriend.

> In fan spaces, they quickly established themselves as the edgier alternative when it came to boy bands, the *Hot Topic* to *1D*’s *Claire's*, but they weren’t seen as rivals in the fans’ eyes, [more as different ends on an axis](https://i.imgur.com/9taDl3p.png), matter of fact, 5SOS’ fanbase would consist mostly of directioners with an affinity to flannel shirts and black skinny jeans, so when it was announced that *5 Seconds of Summer* would be the opening act for *One Direction*’s *Take Me Home Tour* the reception was quite positive, and so, they went to play 100 dates in Europe, North America and Oceania, and headline their own tour in their homeland.

> *5SOS* would sign to *Capitol Records* and set up their own record label, *Hi or Hey Records*, under which they’d start releasing songs and promoting their self-titled album, which would come out on June 27th, 2014. The record would debut at #1 in the Billboard 200 and get certified double platinum in the US, and while over at the UK it didn’t reach the top spot in the albums chart, getting blocked by no other than Ed Sheeran’s *X*, the singles got much better reception there, with *Don’t Stop* peaking at #2 and *She Looks So Perfect* debuting at #1. 

> *Self-titled* can't help but sound very juvenile, given that most songs were written when they were teenagers, but with an ability to go from pop power ballads; like *Amnesia*; to pop-punk bangers; like *Good Girls* or *Voodoo Doll*; and a clear talent for writing catchy hooks and melodies, it was a clear showcase of what the group could do and a promising start to their career.

[**Meet The Vamps**](https://open.spotify.com/album/3XDvXyhPzaPRpGoEjoQI8P?si=rhW1i8k5SyqFyJzIMRzz_Q) by [*hornyunicorn*](https://youtu.be/tev30AdnsuY?t=600)

`The Vamps (Band)`

**No Archive Warning Apply**, `Brad Simpson`, `Tristan Evans`, `Connor Ball`, `James McVey`, 12 songs, [Can We Dance](https://youtu.be/UqSww10eeKw), [Somebody To You \(feat. Demi Lovato\)](https://youtu.be/0go2nfVXFgA), [Last Night](https://youtu.be/WLyHSOXhZhY), [Oh Cecilia \(Breaking My Heart\) \(feat. Shawn Mendes\)](https://youtu.be/COwkCW38J54), [Girls On TV](https://youtu.be/6knVL7WBRxY), [Risk It All](https://youtu.be/a3T-wcOuZ-Q), [Hurricane](https://youtu.be/lAvxnJMu3Lo), [Wild Heart](https://youtu.be/sCDdQwVRwxM), [Another World](https://youtu.be/GByFK4joJRU), [Move My Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkklffsAFrA), [She Was The One](https://youtu.be/0B5DOyI6Tmg), [Smile](https://youtu.be/0yRSVS5lYrA), aggressively british, Ho Hey inspired, ukulele



> British self-proclaimed [really manly men band](https://youtu.be/eu5ylDrleuQ) was formed in 2012, when guitarist James McVey and main vocalist Brad Simpson met and decided to start a band, which quickly was made possible when they met bassist Connor Ball and drummer Tristan Evans via social media. Just like *5SOS*, they quickly started uploading covers to YouTube, and just as quickly they had signed a contract with *Mercury Records*.

> [The group has been quick to reject the term boy band](https://globalnews.ca/news/1508287/watch-the-vamps-talk-about-success-and-why-theyre-not-a-boy-band/), stating that they prefer to just be seen as a band and appreciated as songwriters, although based on [Brad’s styling](https://i.imgur.com/8YJ7wBn.png), crafted to make him look like Harry Styles’ younger brother, [the song choices for their covers](https://youtu.be/hz623mjFl_0), and them landing the gig of opening Taylor Swift’s *Red Tour*’s British dates, it was clear that their team was looking to benefit from the same audience that *One Direction* had gathered.

> When looking at this lineup, the first thought that comes to mind is that *The Vamps* are the odd one out, compared to *1D*’s success at their peak and the longevity *5SOS* have had, [but that’s not completely true](https://i.imgur.com/06a0Kmv.png). *The Vamps*’s first taste of real success came with the release of *Can We Dance*, which debuted at #2 in the UK, blocked from the top spot by *Radioactive* by fellow manly man band *Imagine Dragons*. After that, they gave the single treatment to their very first song, *Wild Heart*, pushing it to #3 in the same chart. *Last Night*, the last pre-release single from the album, would meet the same faith as their previous one and just shortly missed the #1 spot, peaking at #2.

> Their attempts to break into the American market began with the remixes of already released songs, *Somebody to You* and *Cecilia (Breaking My Heart)*, featuring teen idols that had already gotten more success in the US, Demi Lovato and Shawn Mendes. These singles didn’t take much traction in the States, except for *Somebody To You* getting #10 in the Bubbling Under charts, but at the very least their homeland kept on supporting them, with both remixes reaching the top 10 there. 

> *Meet The Vamps* is… an experience. The group knew to play to their strengths, that being their cheerfulness and energy, with most songs being bops made to be sung in unison with a crowd. While there are some… particular songwriting choices, this album has hooks and spirit to spare, and despite what you would assume based off their sound, their lyrics are cheekier than their British counterpart ever dared to be, example being the drunken, horny mess of [*Can We Dance*](https://youtu.be/UqSww10eeKw) and all of [*On The Floor*](https://youtu.be/YN5XQpL-Khs).

**Bonus Rate** by [*track_not_available*](https://i.imgur.com/MTvg898.png)

`5 Seconds Of Summer (Band)``The Vamps (Band)`

**No Archive Warning Apply**, 8 Tracks, `5 Seconds Of Summer`, [Heartache On The Big Screen](https://youtu.be/DUv5KUl6_PY), [The Only Reason](https://youtu.be/-Hbd9mV6VWg), [Disconnected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBFp_3NIoU), [Pizza Song](https://youtu.be/32yiqwvRRKA), `The Vamps`,[ Shout About It](https://youtu.be/edJroiKURxQ), [High Hopes](https://youtu.be/9pMV32Xc88s), [Lovestruck](https://youtu.be/aNdXxsRgtpo), [On The Floor](https://youtu.be/YN5XQpL-Khs), alternate ending, american centrism 

> This bonus rate is brought to you by 5 Seconds Of Summer and The Vamps having multiple versions of their albums with different tracklists!

> Usually, album rates are pretty straight forward when it comes to which songs are in, you just use the lineup of the album and that’s it, but because of what I assume is a case of different distributors per continent and legal issues I was too lazy to research,  both The Vamps and 5 Seconds Of Summer had multiple editions of their albums and the tracklist would change depending on your location. The former group had 7 tracks that were fully unavailable on streaming platforms in the US, while the latter had over 20 songs that were either added to one of their multiple versions of their album, or were released in one of the EPs they would release for each single.

>Taking in consideration Spotify and Youtube streams, previous tour setlists, and my own personal taste, I choose what I considered to be the most relevant songs that couldn’t be in the main rate.

>[Here’s the Youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzF4G7Kbnn40lJWpYWB98u7cQOcvsAdsr) that you Americans will have to use to listen to The Vamps songs in the bonus rate, and [here’s a link to a song](https://youtu.be/GP6U58rnLws) I wanted to force into this rate but couldn’t justify doing so.

>None of the bonus tracks can be given an 11 or 0, only scores from 1 to 10. If it wasn't for that I'm sure everyone would give *Pizza Song* their 11.

#The rules

* You must listen to every single song and assign them a score from 1 to 10, 10 being the most positive score you can give. **Ballots with scores missing won’t be accepted**.

* You may use up to one decimal spot in your scores, meaning that you can give a song a **7.8** or a **6.9**, but not a **8.472** or a **6.66**. If you do use decimals, remember to use a dot ( . ) and not a comma ( , ).

* You have the option to give one song a zero (0) and one song an eleven (11) **across the entire rate**. These should be reserved for your least favorite and favorite track. Songs in the bonus rate can't be given these scores.

* Use the prepared format found [**HERE**](https://tinyurl.com/YN2014) to fill in and send your scores. If for some reason, that link isn’t working, [**HERE’S A PASTEBIN WITH THE FORM**](https://pastebin.com/qgDJ79XK)  and you can send it to /u/2014BoyBands.

* Leaving comments for each song is encouraged but not required. To do so, leave a space after your score and write your comment, like this:
 
 > Fireproof: 10 mitski outsold x
 
    That is the only correct format when leaving comments. Anything else is incorrect and won’t be accepted.
 
* If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon ( : ) after the album name and put your comment there.
 
 > Album: 5 Seconds Of Summer: why is it 5 seconds of summer if there are only 4 members
 
* If at any point you’d like to change one of your scores or comments, just message u/2014BoyBands explaining what changes you’d like to make.
 
* Keep in mind that your ballot isn’t confidential! Every single score and comment will be revealed to the public and attached to your name, so be careful out there…
 
* **Sabotage will not be tolerated**, and I’ll reserve the right to ask you to change scores, write more comments, or straight up reject your ballot if I’m suspicious you’re trying to mess up the results. Don’t be an ass, this is supposed to be fun for everyone.
