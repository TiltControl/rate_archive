Y/N's Favorite 2014 Boy Bands Reveal, Day 3: I talk a lot of shhh when I'm rating, baby
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/tpt8ur/yns_favorite_2014_boy_bands_reveal_day_3_i_talk_a/

Hey!


Yesterday we took majority of 5SOS' songs out, and mostly forgot about 1D, leaving them with 9 songs still in today. Will they be able to take the top spot, or did directioners split the vote [\(same way One Direction split itself\)](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a068c510cc5ed7131b8a0c5e0f503ce3/tumblr_inline_nnz661D7JP1r6ys8t_640.png). We'll find out as we reveal the songs placing **#15** to **#1**. We'll also reveal some of the bonus songs depending on their average, as if they were in the main rate. 

**Important information.** The reveal will be taking place in [**queup.net**](https://www.queup.net/join/ripplugdj), because if there's one thing I like my reveals to be in guinea pigs to test new platforms. If that fails, the new platform will be revealed shortly after.



Make sure to keep this thread open, as I will be unveiling your comments and scores for each of the songs as they go out, featuring all scores, comments, rank graphs and banners.

**mary (ricki‚Äôs sister)** (10): I want this to play at the background when I finally lose my shit and runaway

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): THIS TIME I‚ÄôM READY TO RUN! ESCAPE THE CITY AND FOLLOW THE SUN! omfg remembering when they made us do cross country runs in PE and me and my friends would belt out this song while walking + then get shouted at by the teachers for not running‚Ä¶ah <3

**Roxieloxie** (10): This was the 3rd song I heard from this era, I have a habbit of not listening to pre releases before an album comes out but someone described this song as like a warm cozy sweater and i could not resist. I loved it then i love it now, its so good

**runaway3212** (10): not me my condition is trash

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): damn this makes me nostalgic for 2014 me driving around at night singing my lungs out

**TiltControls** (10): [iguanas when they hatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3OjfK0t1XM)

**wavingwolves** (10): i find this song to be genuinely so gay lmfao the idea of being ready to run and wanting to be free being tied up with the idea of belonging to someone and having them as yours... i truly don't know how else could this be read as! anyway major banger and one of my fave songs by them

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): y‚Äôall better not sleep on this banger

**frogaranaman** (9): crazy how sexism stopped people from listening to this bop

**GamblesWithDesire** (9): They looked at Through The Dark off Midnight Memories and said "yeah let's do that again." To be clear, I'm not at all mad about it because I love this song.

**twat\_brained** (9): that time when Niall played this riff and then he teased the crowd about it. But I'm running right beside these lads

**bigbigbee** (8.5): Unlike some other songs on this record, this one is BETTER than the one it reminds me of (Phillip Phillips - Home)‚Ä¶by a big margin, actually

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): me when I am at the start line for a race

**akanewasright** (8.3): SO WAKE ME UP WHEN ITS ALL O- oh

**throwaway-7650** (8.2): it's giving phillip phillips (aka american idol winner energy)

**Alumineous** (8): Backing band is great. Verses are really great. But that chorus drags it down.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): this sounds like something but I can‚Äôt pin down what

**ImADudeDuh** (8): not the tweet they sent out for fans to unlock this track on social media before the album drops also mentioning tumblr https://twitter.com/onedirection/status/530375990556786688

**skargardin** (8): it's the guitars for me

**starlitsuns** (8): great road trip music, thumbs up for musical effect

**teenwitches** (8): big horse girl energy

**Verdantshade** (8): even though four is in my top 5 most listened to albums of all time I am convinced this song is one of the deluxe tracks? anyway love louis my baby 'I know yes I know we'll be alright' ü•∫

**1998tweety** (7.5): summer bop

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): dashi run run run

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): himbo Bruce Springsteen song

**plastichaxan** (7): being ready??? fr something???? running out of all things??? couldn‚Äôt be me

**timothy444** (7): This is something I would hear in the middle of a B-tier live action kids movie, or somewhere buried in its soundtrack

**welcome2thejam** (7): Love that little strum in the chorus

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (7): when i‚Äôm smarter when i‚Äôm older

**Bordersz** (6.8): Liam‚Äôs voice really shined on this song. It is smooth as butter on it.

**seanderlust** (6.5): 1d: writes a fairly generic love song with fairly generic language about escaping and freedom; larry stans in the genius.com comments: this is so larry omg

**thedoctordances1940** (6.3): it's like avicii but then it's like ed sheeran

**apatel27** (6): This is just their take on Wake Me Up

**fadedblue09** (6): Serving OneRepublic

**waluigiest** (6): so wake me up when it‚Äôs all over

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): A decent bop but this is does have some Lumineers energy.

**martian\_pet** (5.5): you were good, i'm waiting for you to be great

**IIIHenryIII** (5): ok, it's ok to just make bad music, but why choose to make generic bad music???

**pig-serpent** (5): Story of My Life but not terrible.

**rotating3Dtext** (5): so wake me up when it‚Äôs all over, when I‚Äôm wiser and I‚Äôm older

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Like ‚ÄúWake Me Up‚Äù but so much worse

**you2009** (5): a song that only sounds good cos they're singing it. would've been an easy 2-3 if it weren't

**roboticpandora** (4.5): It's fine? But forgettable. Also those little guitar arpeggios were so overused in this era I've kind of soured on them.

**bulforster** (3.7): this chorus is begging to go bigger

**Shelly\_AO29** (3): Too similar to Story of My Life, which is superior in every way. Also super boring.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (2): oh god the millennial whoop

this was winning at one point and everyone that tanked it is my enemy

---

#fine

**PretentiousPegasus** (11): If y'all do this work of art dirty‚Ä¶

**2dina3dworld** (10): I could rag on this for being cheesy and over dramatic‚Ä¶ but I AM that cheesy and overdramatic

**Alumineous** (10): I like the vulnerability. Hilariously, this says more than Everything I Didn‚Äôt Say and this song is titled Amnesia.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): Amnesia is one of those songs that could very well be like "ugh, they're STILL playing this?" at this point in their career, but they manage to keep changing it up just a little bit in terms of arrangement to keep it fresh and that's what saves it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): this made me tear up and it almost snatched my 11 but at the last second I decided there was another song that I enjoyed more

**mary (ricki‚Äôs sister)** (10): this song had me crying on my 6th grade classroom as if I had just gone through my second divorce and lost custody of the children

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): god i do love an emotional boyband song...they just don't do them like this anymore. also this is so sapphic-coded thank you 1d for the legacy of sapphic-coded boyband songs

**Roxieloxie** (10): IM REALLY NOT FINE AT ALL, TELL ME THIS WAS JUST A DREAM, CAUSE IM REALLY NOT FINE AT ALL

**runaway3212** (10): This being randomly so beautiful what

**starlitsuns** (10): watch this go out day 1 my response is that "IT'S CAMP" like you all did trying to defend every bad kpop song in the boy groups showdown rate

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this song is amazing and we love a song with lots of callum vocals

**wannabemusiccritic** (10): I debated giving this song an 11, this song and ‚ÄúShe Looks So Perfect‚Äù are the songs that hold up the best on this album imo x

**wavingwolves** (10): this is also sapphic coded btw

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): this song better be rated high, it‚Äôs the song that made me first love 5sos

**1998tweety** (9): Y'all need to listen to Britney Spears - Amnesia. It's a bonus track from Circus but whew it's so good. This is nice too.

**akanewasright** (9): oh‚Ä¶ oh no‚Ä¶

**emmaelf** (9): like a knock off hey there delilah but a knock off of an amazing song is still good

**IIIHenryIII** (9): back then I used to hate this song cuz the line "I wish that I could wake up with amnesia" just sounded so wrong, well, it still does, but let me forget about it for a second

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): Still to this day one of their best songs. Luke's voice breaking in the chorus? Calum's vocals? Wonderful.

**Verdantshade** (9): budget atl but it's perfect for that lighters in the air song

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): i loved this when it was new so i‚Äôm being kind but the vocal processing on that chorus causes me pain now

**apatel27** (8): Cute Acoustic song

**jasannn** (8): it would fit perfectly on SOUR

**TiltControls** (8): Why is this so dramatic [2] but it also kinda works

**throwaway-7650** (7.9): the verses are so naur but the chorus is so yass... amne8ia it is

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): they were in their angst bag there

**pig-serpent** (7.5): This is just the Hey There Delilah we have at HOLY COW THIS CHORUS IS GREAT

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): when this first came out my friends were like "this is the most romantic song ever!!!" needless to say this was in middle school

**twat\_brained** (7.2): I like to think of this as being the prequel to Closer, solely because of the "doing fine" lyric. And tbh I wish I had amnesia for Meet The Vamps. Also great intro plucking from Michael.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): There‚Äôs a lot of things I would like to forget about too. Not relationships because I don‚Äôt participate in romance but like the time I called a coworker the wrong name twice in one week.

**frogaranaman** (7): what in the douchey Hey There Delilah

**martian\_pet** (7): the fact that I amnesiad this song's existence, it's one of their best tho

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Oh shit why does this make me feel things

**bluetriangles04** (6.5): I'm blaming 5SOS for the sudden influx of amnesia AUs written post 2014

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): y'all will stan this midtempo guitar pop song with heavily processed Australian vocals but won't give The Kid Laroi a chance :rolling_eyes:

**ImADudeDuh** (6): does anyone remember the late 00s/early 10s game show amnesia where they ask you questions about your own life? I remember it flopped because it was literally impossible to play along at home

**poemforsmallthings** (6): I remember not liking this song that much when I was younger. To me it was just their Little Things but better

#not fine at all

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5.5): this suffers from reverse single bias for me

**roboticpandora** (5): A good ballad but a full minute too long.

**Novuspyra** (4): I had fond memories of this song but listening to it now, I can't imagine why.

**timothy444** (4): I stand by my comments that I said when I first heard this played on the radio in 2014. It's still boring.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): ballad a snooze, maybe balladphobia can be good

**waluigiest** (3): the joke about this being forgettable is right there

**Stryxen** (2): this is like happier than ever by billie eilish but if it was actually hey there delilah instead

**bulforster** (1.9): the songwriting ability needed for this to work just is not there

**thedoctordances1940** (1): this is so fucking bad omg

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (0): when did this trend of ‚Äòhow dare YOU be fine when I‚ÄôM not fine‚Äô in music begin? Because it‚Äôs not very healthy! People process emotions differently, why are you linking someone‚Äôs emotions only to yours

**Bordersz** (10): Underrated sad emo song. Lord I played the MESS out of this growing up. Gorgeous vocals, production, and the closest score to a 11 w/o giving it away. I wish they made more songs like this.

**poemforsmallthings** (10): REAL RATE WINNER

**Verdantshade** (10): this is actually my favourite 5sos song and fully deserves my 11 if not for me being obliged to give it to 1d and it being on the bonus rate.. I can't believe they brought it back after years of paying it dust but it's probably the most emo they've ever gotten on a song (and I, a very angsty teenager, lapped it up)

**roboticpandora** (9.5): I‚Äôm an emo bitch at heart so I love a Jimmy Eat World vibe. The vocal choices in the verses really worked for me, too.

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): Not gonna lie I hated this in 2014 and didn't listen to it for years but I've recently come around to it

**wannabemusiccritic** (8.5): i actually never really appreciated this song until the live album for the Meet You There tour came out. x

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): Michael songs are always so good and while this isn't the same as Wrapped Around Your Finger or Jet Black Heart, it's still a banger.

**throwaway-7650** (8): it doesn't really stand out in the album at all but it's nice

**welcome2thejam** (8): Hoo boy, kinda wished you could've swapped in these EP songs, solid pop punk that would've given 5S0S a better average

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): Decent song.

**TiltControls** (6.5): The only reason I accept is The Reason by American rock band Hoobastank formed in 1994 in Agoura Hills, California, by lead vocalist Doug Robb, guitarist Dan Estrin, drummer Chris Hesse, and original bassist Markku Lappalainen. They were signed to Island Records from 2001 to 2012 and have released six albums and one extended play to date. Their most recent album, Push Pull, was released on May 25, 2018. They have sold 10 million albums worldwide.

**wavingwolves** (6.2): certainly a song!

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): [found this gem in the YouTube comments](https://i.imgur.com/xUgAEy9.png)

**IIIHenryIII** (3.5): for a moment, I thought it was at least a 4

Perhaps the *Ed Sheeran*est song to have ever *Ed Sheeran*ed.

If there's one thing that little ginger man knows how to do, is reminisce. Some of his best songs are just that, him fondly recalling the past, and you can see aspects of songs like *Thinking Out Loud* and *Castle On The Hill* here. Probably one of the stronger ballads in 1D's catalogue, and I'll forever be angry that I broke up with my boyfriend from when I was 18 because that means I can't play this at my wedding.

---

**moonagenightmares** (11): this and right now are the two 1d songs that make me experience catharsis each time not even joking whenever i listen to this album i always skip this song and then listen to it last because i need a moment to recover

**1998tweety** (10): this sounds like a ed sheeran song (not derogatory)

**2dina3dworld** (10): manifesting ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

**Alumineous** (10): I can‚Äôt deny it, this song plucks my heartstrings‚Ä¶ just like the instruments. Seriously, give it up to the backing band. The instruments sound so beautiful and just got better as the song progressed.

**Bordersz** (10): IT IS CRIMINAL THIS WASN‚ÄôT A SINGLE. Wasted Ed‚Äôs pen.

**emmaelf** (10): this was THE song for the relationship i was in at the time. hadn't listened to it in years but still slaps! just a shame the guy was a twat.

**frogaranaman** (10): the fact that this is one of two 18s sends

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i swear this sounds like those tiktok ballads by lewis capaldi but much better

**mary (ricki‚Äôs sister)** (10): I am 18 this is my last chance to fall in love so I can relate to this song. So if anyone is secretly in love with me please confess sometime soon

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): when harry sang i have loved you since i was 16 at the otra london stop...if you know you know.

**Novuspyra** (10): Teenage me ate this up for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 25 year old me enjoys it as a snack every now and then.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): i definitely used to have my own y/n daydreams to this song

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): The one good song E* Sh*eran has ever made

**Roxieloxie** (10): balladphobia is no fucking match for nostalgia dear god. Mad as fuck I cant play this at my wedding because i was not in love with anyone when i was 18

**wavingwolves** (10): who else remembers that one tumblr post that said "so kiss me where i lay down / my hands pressed to your cheeks" was a reference to - yeah, you guessed ‚Äì rimming

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Ed put his full pooshy in this song

**emayzee** (9): they really had a 20 year harry sing about wanting to feel 18 again

**GamblesWithDesire** (9): As an Ed Sheeran fan, this is the ONLY good song Ed ever gave them.  Oh, also, WE TOOK A CHONCE

**Verdantshade** (9): thanks ed for this larry fanfic yes yes

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): I am bracing for the physical damage I will take when someone comments "omg I hope I feel a love like this when I turn 18!"

**twat\_brained** (8.1): https://youtu.be/aTRTs2WCUSI but nobody ever talks about Zayn singing chonce on Stand Up

**bulforster** (8): Ed put his whole sheerussy into this one

**hhiggy** (8): i used to get so emo to this LMAO

**plastichaxan** (8): this sounds better than the other 18 but it‚Äôs not as fun

**runaway3212** (8): me stanning an ed sheeran song what else is new.

**Stryxen** (8): this has #3 energy

**teenwitches** (8): the fanfic girlies went nuts over this one

**throwaway-7650** (8): more like **eight**teen... haha I'm so creative am I right

**welcome2thejam** (8): Aw this is sweet, unlike the other 18, its problematic and hornier younger cousin

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (8): twitter directioners really ruined the ‚Äòchonce‚Äô part by not shutting up about it and for that this song goes from a 9.5 to an 8

**you2009** (8): I'm kinda mad he doesn't say chonce in this recording

**thedoctordances1940** (7.7): I didn't realise ed sheeran wrote castle on the hill twice

**akanewasright** (7.5): WHAT THE FUCK IS A CHONCE

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): chonce (doing the bare minimum to be under this header)

**TiltControls** (7.5): 18 > 18

**celladonn** (7): I love how they're acting like 18 was such a long time ago when they were all like 20 here

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): ‚Äúchonce‚Äù is SO iconic, I had literally listened to like three One Direction songs in my life before this rate but I still instantly recognized it‚Ä¶ anyways this song has a weird tone when you think about how Liam‚Äôs wife was ten years older than him and met him when he was 14 on The X Factor

**hikk** (7): there's a good chonce that the vast majority of this song's comments are about a certain pronunciation of a word

**ignitethephoenix** (7): too bad all the guys I knew at 18 sucked then

**starlitsuns** (7): this would have been a better Ed #1 on the Hot 100 for 10 weeks than Photograph and Perfect were, no I do not take comments on this matter

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): she's cute

**timothy444** (7): It's almost a ballad but I'll let it pass since the other song titled "18" in this rate is absolute hot garbage

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (7): there are two wolves inside of you: one asks what the fuck a chonce is, the other says this song is about eating ass

**poemforsmallthings** (6.8): some joke about chonce

**seanderlust** (6.5): I love songs about taking a chonce

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): this song would‚Äôve been better if they took more chonces sonically

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): it starts off really feeble and schlocky, but it picks up in the second half

**roboticpandora** (6): I like the vocal phrasing on the bridge but I don't really get the playgrounds lyric??

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): This stranglehold this song had on dramatic tik tok POVs

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Sound like the kind of ballad you write just cause your album needs a ballad

**martian\_pet** (5): a bit derivative

**Shelly\_AO29** (5): A middling ballad. This song has Ed Sheeran‚Äôs fingerprints all over it, and unfortunately suffers as a result as it feels super derivative.

**waluigiest** (5): the fact that are multiple 18s in this rate HAHAHHAHA

**babadork** (4): My first comment is that this is an Ed Sheeran reject, which I guess is still accurate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Being 18 is really nothing special, like this song.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4): this is an Ed Sheeran song (derogatory)

**apatel27** (3): Why are they singing about playgrounds? If it's love like at 18 they were in college or uni, those places don't have playgrounds.

**pig-serpent** (3): I hate the faux-large majestic climax of this song.  It's unearned, the chord progression is obvious and boring, and the production isn't anywhere close to good enough to pull off actual majesty.

**fadedblue09** (2): Nope. This song doesn't work well on being sung by a group. Ed should've kept this for himself.

**IIIHenryIII** (2): this is torture

**pig-serpent** (11): Honestly this song still holds up.  It's cute, not annoying, and Demi features always slay. And if I don't give this song an 11, I don't expect anyone else to.

**bigbigbee** (10): So 2013 I could cry, but like, tears of joy

**fadedblue09** (10): Why is the Demi version only on the "Christmas Edition"

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I feel like this is gonna get tanked but I don‚Äôt care, this is super cute and it has a great chorus. Demi is a bit disposable but they don‚Äôt detract so it‚Äôs w/e

**hhiggy** (10): YEAH YOU

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I used to hate this, but it's actually pretty good

**mary (ricki‚Äôs sister)** (10): a bop

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): why did i think ally from austin and ally was the feat? oh i just searched it up and it's because she was the love interest in the mv...good on laura marano for having a second job in 2014 i guess

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): i really thought i'd fall in love with someone to this song when i was in junior high huh

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): Fantastic song, deserved more chart success in America

**Roxieloxie** (10): I actually didnt know this one prior to the rate but its cute enough I cant hate it

**seanderlust** (10): this is fun! they work really well with demi here

**throwaway-7650** (10): this is a taylor song (demi disliked)

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): simply pop perfection

**1998tweety** (9.5): We need this Demi back

**2dina3dworld** (9.5): Demi outshines them so hard that it‚Äôs barely even fair

**emayzee** (9.2): very 2014 but very cute. demi and tom holland kinda served with this

**akanewasright** (9): hmm I think this might be bad but it‚Äôs making my brain feel nice so it can stay

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): I had a lot of fun screaming along to the chorus lol.

**skargardin** (9): ok maybe they snapped with this one

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I thought the hey yous would be annoying, but they are endearing actually, this is a bop

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): while this is a bit mumford-lite, it's fun and should've been the opener for the album imo.

**runaway3212** (8): Demi really slays so much here. I miss them making listenable songs

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): Demi is underutilized but werk

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): it is super catchy

**TiltControls** (7.5): It's cute, but also giving big 'stomp-clap' indie energy 2 years too late

**ImADudeDuh** (7): omg the way they don‚Äôt misgender demi, we love progessive icons

**timothy444** (7): Oh god I hate how I have to admit that the best part of the song is Demi Lovato.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): i‚Äôm not crazy right?? the version on spotify barely has any demi, but the mv version has her doing a verse.

**wavingwolves** (6.6): anti-capitalist anthem if you squint

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): on one hand removing the ‚ÄúYeah YOU‚Äù would make this song less interesting (when they already lack personality) but it would also make this song significantly better

**bulforster** (6.2): this is kinda cute in a children's art on the wall kind of way

**emmaelf** (6): it's like a really crap version of the lumineers.

**starlitsuns** (6): I do not know how many of you have watched the teen book to movie adaptation The D.U.F.F., but this plays during the end credits and Demi is definitely not on this track in my memory? but alas I'm glad they were able to give the band some good exposure even if this song is very average

**synchronisedchaos** (6): it is better without the feature

**twat\_brained** (6): capital FM summer ball core

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Commercial-core

**roboticpandora** (5): Oh hey Demi Lovato welcome to the rate.

**cremeebrulee** (4.7): lumineers ho hey‚Äôs impact on music is really immeasurable

**apatel27** (4): banjos suck

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Lol they knew this song wasn‚Äôt worth actually flying Demi in for the music video.

**hikk** (4): get a job stay away from demi

**jasannn** (4): i swear ive heard this ‚Äúyeahhhhh you‚Äù bit in five other songs

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (4): is this the best you could come up with? Kings of Leon SWEETIES

**you2009** (4): demi is on this?

**thedoctordances1940** (3.8): üßõ

**Stryxen** (1.5): the stomp clap pandemic must be stopped lives are being ruined

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): i love this arena rock cuz i am a boomer

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): HERE! WE! GO AGAIN! ANOTHER GO ROUND FOR ALL OF MY FRIENDS! ANOTHER NON-STOP WILL IT EVER END! *guitar riff* we're never coming back down...YEAH WE'RE LOOKING DOWN ON THE CLOUDS. idk it bangs y'all.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): okay ladies my lighter is IN THE AIR right now

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): they truly just devoured like honestly this entire album is just 1d going yeah you thought we couldn‚Äôt make good music? yeah? yeah? well FUCK YOU. and they were so right

**Novuspyra** (10): This song isn't a 10, but the first and only One Direction concert I want to, they opened with this song, and it's probably the best singular moment of my entire life.

**Roxieloxie** (10): I listen to this song everytime im on a plane I have too listen to this song. its so GOOD

**starlitsuns** (10): this hurts not giving this my 11, very much as good as No Control, also why couldn't 1D sound like this their entire length as a group?

**twat\_brained** (10): fun fact I took this video https://twitter.com/DailyOT5report/status/640326557811118081?s=20&t=qL9zzJqbMWk7rhhf8Sn82A

**wavingwolves** (10): i always think this being the closing song is so weird because i will always associate this with being the otra tour opener and i just think it would work a lot better as an opener than a closing song anyway! just infectious, really

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): you know what, this used to be a skip for me, but it‚Äôs actually quite good

**skargardin** (9): this would go off live i can tell

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): love

**teenwitches** (9): HERE! WE! GO AGAIN!

**TiltControls** (9): The progression on this song is fantastic

**timothy444** (9): Great way to end your (standard edition) album.

**you2009** (9): flow flow flowing clouds

**throwaway-7650** (8.4): can't believe I'm saying this but slayyyter outsold (just a little bit)

**emmaelf** (8): that opening HITS and the rest of the song promptly doesn't and then the chorus HITS again. why so variable, boys?

**frogaranaman** (8): what kind of cloud do you think they're talking about? my bet is cumulus

**Verdantshade** (8): I love rock 1d but tbh this is a budget hey angel

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (8): oxygen!

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**ImADudeDuh** (7): sadly not a weed anthem

**jasannn** (7): This song is as crowded as an aespa chorus.

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): A fun song to sing at the top of your lungs.

**welcome2thejam** (7): I'm a sucker for some nice bouncy tracks, and this has maybe the best moment of it in this rate

**apatel27** (6.5): It was a nice anthem song until it got stuck on repeat for a minute

**roboticpandora** (6.5): This feels like it should be playing over a graduation montage in a high-budget teen dramedy and I don't know how I feel about that.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Another song that sounds like this on the album.

**bulforster** (5.9): I can't really justify this but the way they shout the beginning of the chorus somehow reminded me so much of how wolf alice starts the chorus of don't delete the kisses that I was too distracted to score my first couple listens.

**runaway3212** (5): this kinda bores me

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Great instrumental, but could they try maybe not singing?

**thedoctordances1940** (4.8): ok i was genuinely hating it at first but i did quite like the outro and i like when an album has a closer where you can just tell it's a closer by listening to it

**2dina3dworld** (4.5): the guitar goes off

**pig-serpent** (4): A fine song that exists as the worst version of itself, like a toddler tried to product Panic at the Disco's "Ready To Go."  The guitar licks are neat though.

**martian\_pet** (3): another skip

**Stryxen** (3): realising slayyyter is not that bad

**celladonn** (2.5): This is so boring and feels like it just keeps going

**IIIHenryIII** (1): Slayyyter outsold smoothly

 I think it's time I come clean... Regardless of all the Tumblr imagery I've been using to promote and distinguish this rate, I wouldn't consider One Direction to be Tumblr artists. Don't get me wrong, 1D was incredibly huge on Tumblr, but that was just because of how insanely big they were as a group, it was their world and we were living in it, but they didn't get adopted by the site and had their entire fanbase concentrated there like artists like Marina & The Diamonds or Lana Del Rey. That said, I know there's an alternate universe out there, where a less-universally-successful One Direction released this song, and went to occupy the same spot that The 1975 did. 

Perhaps the The 1975 comparison is a little tired at this point, but let's say it how it is, this song is their attempt at creating their very own [*Girls*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkubQCI4Fxo), and you know what? They nailed it. From the near identical guitar riff, to the borderline fuckboy lyrics, they took the Matty Healy hat and wore it with pride ([he even claims that the boys admitted to The 1975 being an inspiration](https://www.mtv.com/news/2737946/matt-healy-one-direction-rip-off-1975/)), to the point that this doesn't even feel like a One Direction song. Yes, it does have the *singing directly to you*-type lyrics that most of their tracks do, but the lines that suggest that this is about secret affairs in hotels around the globe reminds more of the classic Rockstar Casanova persona that was so romanticized in Tumblr than the lovey-dovey, only slightly horny image that 1D had crafted to that point. Either way, this is a slay and I would love to make harry have to go through the pain in the ass that is having to change a ticket with any airline.

---

**fadedblue09** (10): Wow did not expect to love this as much.

**followingfreeways** (10): BOPPPPP

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): As someone who thinks Matty Healy sounds like a dying cat trapped in a metal bucket, this was a great way for me to have the fun little riffs of a 1975 song with vocals I could enjoyo. 99% of the time, 1D's at their best when they're sad, horny, or a bit of both, and this song is proof of that.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the 1975 if they slayed

**Roxieloxie** (10): This is actually the best song written ever. I cant think about this song and not think of the tumblr post that pointed out how this song is iconic for making the boys have to deal with all the costumer service shit that would come from trying to change your airline ticket

**seanderlust** (10): this is going to be robbed, I can feel it. if this were an EMOTION B-side it would be day 3 and there would be an outcry in the reveal when it missed the top ten!

**wavingwolves** (10): used the 1975 formula and made a better song with it?? ooooh matty healy was HEATED about it

**hhiggy** (9): most underrated deluxe song of theirs

**Bordersz** (8.8): It is a very carefree song.

**bulforster** (8.8): Makes me wonder how y/n feels about the 1975...

**throwaway-7650** (8.6): [HBO MAX] The Flight Attendant Wholesome Version

**akanewasright** (8.5): this guitar riff could end lives and marriages

**TiltControls** (8.5): probably the best of the FOUR bonuses

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): this could be a summer bop

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): why is this a bonus track challenge

**Verdantshade** (8): I was going to take away a point for being a girls ripoff but it also gets a point for nailing that sound.. I still remember the matty healy collab rumours

**babadork** (7.5): This might be the most vocally consistent song on the album. They all sound good.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Baby It‚Äôs Cold Outside if it was a cute bop.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This is just ‚ÄúWork For Home‚Äù for people who haven‚Äôt been yassified

**pig-serpent** (7.5): This sounds like a light 80s alt song with most of the edge stripped off, and it's still a solid song.  If this was actually made in the 80s, it would slay though.

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.5): This could've been a The 1975 song if they upped the self-loathing a notch or two

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (7.5): a reminder to use the ‚Äòthe 1975 have been trying to make this song their entire career‚Äô comment here

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): I see why this is a bonus track, since sonically it isn‚Äôt a perfect fit with the rest of the album (though its energy goes nicely with Stockholm Syndrome for me), but I really like it

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): I‚Äôm trying to get ready and leave for work

**rotating3Dtext** (7): what in the 1975

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): It slaps, what more can I say.

**twat\_brained** (7): "oh it's just Girls!" - Harry, probably, when Julian asked if this was an impending copyright suit

**Stryxen** (6.5): the 1975 song (neutral)

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): this is a 1975 song

**roboticpandora** (6): The little guitar riffs are my favorite part, but they feel weirdly out of place.

**timothy444** (6): Alright, could be better

**emmaelf** (5.5): the fact it was still going 4 minutes in killed me.

**Alumineous** (5): This is as British as ‚Äúthe showers that are British‚Äù because I literally live in the city with the worst public transit system on the continent so I cannot relate.

**apatel27** (5): It's a cute song but damn does it capitalise on the predatory I can be your bf stuff

**IIIHenryIII** (5): whatever

**poemforsmallthings** (5): don't GOOOOO

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): This lyricism is‚Ä¶ not good

**martian\_pet** (4): I would've left too

**celladonn** (10): omg I was obsessed with this song back in the day

**cremeebrulee** (10): people were doing so much on the album in #rates i did not expect it to open with an actually good song

**emayzee** (10): 16 year old me wanted so badly to be known as an indie tumblr girl who listened to vampire weekend meanwhile the other vampire group secretly had me in a chokehold with this one

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Funny how the lead singer has the more immature voice out of all the kids in this rate, but he's the one singing about drinking. Also, this is a banger, holy crap

**mary (ricki‚Äôs sister)** (10): I‚Äôve been a bad bad boy. It makes me irrationally mad that they don‚Äôt say shit

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): The minute I heard this song on TV (remember when we used to discover new songs on TV?) I loved it! It's so catchy and fun, and the brass instruments make it so much better. Also love the music video.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i was so obsessed with this song at one stage. easily their best imo

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): why does the start of this sound SO much like something to dance for by zendeya

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): The Vamps more like The Camps (if only they showed this much personality for the whole album)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This dude does not sound old enough to be drinking. This bops tho.

**fadedblue09** (9): I love the dance beats

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): Anything Bruno writes is guaranteed to be Fire and this is no exception

**runaway3212** (9): nope

**skargardin** (9): I can't deny that this is catchy af

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Wish they let him say ‚Äúshit‚Äù

**waluigiest** (9): woah‚Ä¶ this actually feels like a complete song

**wavingwolves** (8.8): this is actually really good OMFGG slayed that

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This sounds good but in an annoying way

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): this is a mega serve actually

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**emmaelf** (8): JUST SWEAR NEXT TIME otherwise no way you're old enough for alcohol. Anyway catchier than it deserves. Point knocked off for 'i'm a bad bad boy whispering rude things in her ear' like that's called a creep and bars are already full of creeps.

**jasannn** (8): Why does this have the same chorus melody as Zendaya‚Äôs Something To Dance For?

**Novuspyra** (8): Great but that bridge is on thin ice.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): never listened to the vamps before but this is kinda cute?

**starlitsuns** (8): so for some important context I'm doing this rate the last day because procrastination LMAO. and I remember this track and it's not terrible and I've heard a lot of bad things about this album so take this comment that's probably going to be very out of context until late day 2 or day 3 idk

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): I only drink to talk shit

**Verdantshade** (8): this song definitely capitalised on the market for a harry styles lookalike (and dare I say soundalike) doing a slightly edgy song but who am I to complain when I'm part of that market..

**you2009** (8): didn't expect this to be GOOD

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be the bad bad boy‚Äù I knew Jesy was inspired by the Vamps

**moonagenightmares** (7.5): these lyrics sound just a bit funny from a dude that sounds like he hasnt finished going through puberty yet

**akanewasright** (7): I‚Äôd say something about the members being children and singing about drinking but I was on the verge of alcoholism when I was their age so I can‚Äôt really talk. ~~also this is the viva la vida melody please~~

**frogaranaman** (7): SHHHHHH

**pig-serpent** (7): I have a lot of nostalgia for this song but the studio version's instrumental is all over the place, ripping off the 50 ways to say goodbye horns from Train???  I'd still listen to this song if it wasn't proto-monogenre mush.

**twat\_brained** (7): decent opener but this could've been done by Rixton and I wouldn't know the difference

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (7): akane i blame you

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): this is most definitely a rip off of Zendaya‚Äôs ‚ÄúSomething to Dance For‚Äù

**bigbigbee** (6.5): Two Door Cinema Club type beat

**timothy444** (6.5): This song sounds incredibly douchey and I don't care how old this band was when they first wrote it, it sounds bad. Though, the song sounds somewhat decent other than me getting distracted from the vamps lead singer (forgot his name and i'm too lazy to google it lol) way to avoid saying the bad s-word.

**GamblesWithDesire** (6): Not the strongest start to the album. The vocals seem extra scratchy.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): i see the vamps as children so hearing them talk about drinking feels very wrong, i get why Kidz Bop changes the lyrics so much now

**TiltControls** (6): Fun for the most part, but there are some godawful lyrics in here (though that's true for the album as a whole)

**welcome2thejam** (5): Had to look up if they were of drinking age at the time, cause as much as I want to like them aiming for a slightly older crowd, they sound like they hadn't taken a shot in their life. Appreciate the horn use though.

**bulforster** (4.6): he's a bad bad boy? omg is this who jesy wrote boyz about??

**apatel27** (3): Olly Murs reject

**roboticpandora** (3): Hmmmm. Synthetic vanilla.

**thedoctordances1940** (2.3): please go üßõ

**Stryxen** (2): what on earth


#two different people made the same mashup

**throwaway-7650** (10): need to create a mashup of this with paparika... I swear I'm onto something here (edit: [I made it](https://rave.dj/7rlakL6PeLojSw))

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.5): this is indie pop https://rave.dj/fVUOCplmDjKQ0w

**mary (ricki‚Äôs sister)** (8.817): y‚Äôall better not be in a silly goofy mood and let the vamps win <3

**Verdantshade** (8.417): has a band ever fallen off as hard after their debut album as the vamps? I couldn't get into a single other song that came after but for one album, they made a masterpiece to rival every other guitar boyband in the world. also whatever tracklist this is is horrible, it doesn't even have my two favourite songs?

**hhiggy** (7.583): never listened to this before besides the singles but it was kinda better than i thought it would be

**PretentiousPegasus** (7.333): Underrated album. They were played on radio non stop and I listened a lot to their singles in 2014 but never really looked too much into this album. I was pleasantly surprised.

**bigbigbee** (7.000): almost every song on this feels vaguely derivative of some other song I heard on the radio circa 2013/14, but you know what, I quite liked that music, so I enjoyed this

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (6.958): rip in advance to the vamps

**fadedblue09** (6.750): Honestly these guys should pull a JoJo and rerecord this album because the only thing that holds this album back were the vocals, which can get really grating. Otherwise it's a decent teen pop-rock effort.

**GamblesWithDesire** (6.750): (Pre-listen) So this is the only album I've never listened to. To be frank, I've only listened to their latest album, Cherry Blossom, which I loved but never felt the need to dig further into that discography. This should be interesting. (Post-Listen) Oof. Going off Cherry Blossom, which I thought was so well-rounded and versatile, listening to an album that felt EXCEPTIONALLY one-note from top to bottom was a rough time. However, I don't really knock them for it as time and experience changes everything (look at the other two bands in the rate after all).

**throwaway-7650** (6.667): the camps tbh... the fact that they performed can we dance on jessie (disney channel), truly ahead of their time. there's a lot of good songs on this album (I gave 5 10s) but there's also plenty of sub-5 too

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.583): this was fun y‚Äôall are just haters

**frogaranaman** (6.333): this album is funny because they all sound 12

**jackisboredtoday** (5.883): fun fact: the second Vamps album has features from Silento and Omi, officially giving it the title of the most 2015 album of all-time

**IIIHenryIII** (5.750): Guess I misjudged them back then. I mean, who came up with the horrible name for the band? Anyway, they're actually ok. The beginning of this album was such a nice surprise.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.667): they had some bops but i‚Äôm thankful that by the time they came onto the scene i had basically aged out of their demographic + all my focus was on 1d lmfao

**cremeebrulee** (5.517): omg i love playboi carti

**skargardin** (5.500): There were some cute bops, but honestly I didn't find much enjoyment in this album, wheter it be the lyrics, production, vocals etc. It all just blended together into a big pile of "meh" for me.

**Alumineous** (5.417): I‚Äôll admit that it‚Äôs very good muzak. This album is very monotonous and just feels the same. Literally, I cannot tell you any of the titles from the music alone, and I played each song like 10 times. There isn‚Äôt this weird overwhelming hate where I skip all the songs, it‚Äôs just very, very mid-tier and average. I am however willing to give any of their albums another shot. They sound like they have a lot of potential ruined by very generic instrumentals, production, and lyrics.

**wannabemusiccritic** (5.333): not gonna lie, these scores are a little low because I didn‚Äôt listen to the vamps back in 2014, so my first impression of it is right now, in 2022 as an adult with much different taste in music. But honestly, all the songs on this album blend together, which doesn‚Äôt happen to the same extent in 5 Seconds of Summer and definitely not on Four.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.250): This album was way more‚Ä¶ folksy? than I expected. As a whole I don‚Äôt this album is *terrible* per se, but it‚Äôs definitely not my taste, and WOW there are some stinkers on here. I don‚Äôt think Brad Simpson‚Äôs *very* smarmy-sounding accent helps here either.

**TiltControls** (5.208): I'm sorry this is just not working for me. Even the songs I liked I still disliked to some regard. I don't even think it's pre-listening bias as She's So Perfect was the only song on the 5SOS album I heard before listening. This is just... not great.

**welcome2thejam** (5.167): Got better by the end, but there is just nothing to write home about this album. Even when it gets fun, it just can't hit that next level and give me something interesting or at least well-executed sounds to chew on.

**TheQueenofVultures** (5.083): I just learned the wanted and the vamps are different things

**akanewasright** (5.042): ‚Äúthe vamps are overhated‚Äù, he says giving them a 5 average and no 10s

**letsallpoo** (4.917): this album gave me a headache

**roboticpandora** (4.542): Like every other song on this album ends with a hand-clap-singalong chorus. I was happy to leave that trend behind in 2014.

**twat\_brained** (4.467): this album makes me appreciate music elitists' perspective when they call boy bands "not real musicians"

**bulforster** (4.308): honestly, this album's biggest sin is just being extremely unoriginal, it's not particularly unlistenable or anything

**plastichaxan** (4.083): okay, this is what I was scared my reaction would be to the whole album, but I‚Äôm glad it was just them, their voices are kind of annoying and while I had a bit of fun, the fun being laughing at some of these songs is not quite the same is it

**pig-serpent** (3.917): It's obvious this band wanted to be more like 5SoS or All Time Low, and were forced into sounding like this.  Their concert that I went to was actually really enjoyable, and it's a shame that their studio recordings are terribad.

**timothy444** (3.875): From the very start, The Vamps were destined to fail this rate and I wouldn't be surprised at all if they have no songs in the top 10 of this very rate. It's their debut album so it's easy to talk about the flaws and shortcomings here but oh god this is one of the worst pieces of garbage albums I've ever rated here. Outside of the singles, every song just sounds the same as if they just wrote something and gave it to AI Dungeon for it to regurgitate out. It's not even surprising that they had to get two artists featured on their last two singles because they know how boring the songs are without them. Overall, I hope I never have to listen to this album ever again.

**hikk** (3.542): i was originally going to make my album comment "the camps" but it's not camp. i can't say that in good conscience. i was so miserable listening to this, it's just not good and the other two albums cleared so bad... it's definitely a case of "we're gonna need a third"

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3.208): this is marginally better than 5sos but every song sounds like it's trying to sell me a car

**apatel27** (3.208): The album definition of "Can I copy your homework?"

**thedoctordances1940** (3.050): üòÇüòÇüòÇwhen the album title oh that doesn't work here üßõ

**Stryxen** (2.850): beautiful gowns (lemme defend my average from sabotage accusations: i went into this hoping this would be my highest average because the only Vamps song i‚Äôd heard (hurricane) was my favourite of the songs i already knew (and it‚Äôs still a good song). I wanted to cry by the end of this album, this is one of the worst albums I‚Äôve ever heard.) I hate this album, but promise i tried to like it. lord knows they need the help - it‚Äôs just not coming from me x

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): Another 11 contender for me (if bonus songs counted in the first place) and one of my top 5ish 5SOS songs in general. The fact that this is relegated to an EP and therefore a lot of casual fans might not know it when 5SOS performs it live (which they should be contractually obligated to do) is a crime against myself and humanity.

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): If I could give this my 11 I would

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): One of my favourite songs from 5SOS. Thank the Lorde they explored this kind of sound later in their career.

**Verdantshade** (10): another addition to the alex gaskarth songs are the best songs list but I've consistently blasted this song every summer despite not following the band after sgfg.. they only hopped on the 1975 trend for 3 short minutes but those 3 minutes have given me more life than anything they've recently released

**wavingwolves** (10): seeing this live changed my life

**TiltControls** (9.5): Oh wait this is a bop

**throwaway-7650** (9): the best "full" 5SOS song in the bonus rate imo (but pizza >)

**Novuspyra** (8): Two extra points for being in a writing playlist for a WIP story.

**skargardin** (8): wait these B sides slap!

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): for a song with a ‚Äúcause you be on that phone tho‚Äù message this at least bops pretty hard

**seanderlust** (7): this is the most boomer boy band song i've ever heard

**welcome2thejam** (7): Getting the poor man's The 1975's boppier tracks from this

**roboticpandora** (6.5): Needs a bit more teeth.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): the title refers to the disconnect between the end of the chorus and the rest of the song

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I like what's happening in the background

**Bordersz** (4): It has no energy and is a mess.

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): a bold move to write and record a song about smashing the sister of someone you're touring with, but 5SOS made it anyway. Shout out to the better Styles sibling.

**GamblesWithDesire** (11): This is One Direction's best song. The lyrics are amazing, the vocals and harmonies are on point, the music is so well-balanced.  It's also the best song Harry's ever written, and I don't know if he'll be able to top it. The fact that this wasn't a single, especially after the X Factor performance (which was their best TV performance period), will forever haunt me right along with that whole "18-month hiatus" thing.

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): still bangs

**CarlieScion** (10): niall < 3

**emayzee** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): they ate

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the fiji theory saying that harry wrote this after he cheated on [redacted] with [redacted] so [redacted] went to fiji alone for like 2 weeks‚Ä¶if you know you know. god 1d fandom was so insane, TAKE ME BACK!!!

**plastichaxan** (10): hello?? this kinda reminded me of heaven is a place on earth

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): Their best song anyone who disagrees is lying to themselves

**Roxieloxie** (10): EVERY CORNER CALLING OUT Y/N. Vividly remember how this **shook** me to my core hearing it, the part in the back where zouis sing 'c'mon baby cause i need you now' BUS 1 SUPREMACY

**runaway3212** (10): I dont know im somehow stuck with mine

**skargardin** (10): now this is one MASSIVE anthem

**starlitsuns** (10): almost all of the upbeat songs on this album are absolute bangers to this day, hard to beat tbh

**teenwitches** (10): HOW TO FIX UP A HEART THAT I LET DOWN

**twat\_brained** (10): with all due respect to Whitney Houston's estate I prefer this song

**wavingwolves** (10): i always liked this song but as the years passed this grew so much and i still catch myself relistening to it a lot. such a vibrant song and so full of yearning for someone you don't know you can be with, which is one of the main characteristics of a lot of their music! so interesting!

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): this deserved to be a single

**akanewasright** (9): this chorus is about half a scream away from ‚ÄúLiving on a Prayer‚Äù. Like not in any real way just‚Ä¶ vibes

**ImADudeDuh** (9): ‚Äúand iiii will always love you‚Äù - Lorde

**TiltControls** (9): if even whitney couldn't figure it out y'all might be out of luck

**throwaway-7650** (8.7): it's giving reading rainbow [non-derogatory]

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): This became more of a slay with each passing second.

**celladonn** (8.5): This chorus is fun to shout along to

**seanderlust** (8.5): I don't think I can explain this one very well, but I feel like this is the song that teenage girls in 2014 and their springsteen-stanning dads could agree upon

**1998tweety** (8): I would like to know as well

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): wait why is this going so hard

**frogaranaman** (8): mentally I'm assigning this song to Ireland

**jasannn** (8): Hazardous Waste?

**Shelly\_AO29** (8): A song clearly tailored for stadium belting, which is no surprise since the tour for this album was in stadiums. Banger!

**synchronisedchaos** (8): underrated bop

**timothy444** (8): nice catchy bop

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I‚Äôm finding that a lot of these songs would be classics if they just toned down the really cheesy synths

**Verdantshade** (8): where were you when you first heard harry sing 'are you giving it to someone else?' I was in the car listening to the leak with my mum and you just know I audibly gasped

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (8): home

**bigbigbee** (7.5): Wow, three songs in a row that remind me heavily of a different song‚Ä¶this one‚Äôs not as enjoyable as what it reminds me of (Journey - Don‚Äôt Stop Believing) but not many songs are, and this is still pretty fun and great!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): this killed Whitney Houston

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): i don't mind this? the bridge kinda sucks but idk it's like a 1975 song if the 1975 were actually good

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): curious to see how this performs compared to the Whitney song

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): very solid

**martian\_pet** (7): i'm hearing sum

**pig-serpent** (7): This song is well written but the product feels like it's holding everything back, and if the instrumental was allowed to be a little more unhinged this would be great.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): she's a banger

**welcome2thejam** (7): Solid power ballad

**you2009** (7): whitney outsold x

**Bordersz** (6.9): I love the throwback feel on the song.

**bulforster** (6.9): one of the only a big choruses on this album that actually hits for me

**apatel27** (6): God this sounds so familiar but I can't place it. Sounds like an early Bon Jovi song.

**cremeebrulee** (6): they stay in bed

**roboticpandora** (5.5): This also sounds like a Journey song, but a mediocre one.

**fadedblue09** (5): Chorus sounds painfully dated

**IIIHenryIII** (4.5): to the studio to make a break-up album, isn't that the reason why people end relationships?

**Alumineous** (3): An ehhh chorus. But the verses are really nice, beautifully sung.

**Stryxen** (3): IN THE BIN!!!! THROW THIS AWAY!!!!

Gucci's writeup is making have to post this in two parts. I'm posting the more important one first, of course.

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this song is gay, in this essay i will - oh no wait i'm actually gonna write it. sorry everyone for being insane. firstly, it's important to note that 1d, for what they were, have an incredible amount of gay songs (or songs you can Interpret TM as being gay, for the pedants). whether that's because the songs were intended to be like that or just because 1d had a VERY sizable queer fanbase (look at 2014-15 1d tumblr if you don't believe me lel (also shoutout to my time in the 1d fandom for making me realise i was a lesbian)) is no matter - the fact is, the songs are Gay. such gay songs include i wish, they don't know about us (i mean hello look at that song title), you and i, strong, happily, something great, alive (wow they really had their gay awakening during the midnight memories era huh), end of the day, what a feeling (if you get it you get it), and home ("told myself i kinda liked her but there was something missing in her eyes"...okay and what do you want me to do about that?). and yet i never see stockholm syndrome mentioned in queer directioner circles. WHY? i'll tell you why - it's because people go with the infantile bdsm theory. i‚Äôm gonna ignore that harry himself said this song is about a ‚Äúnympho‚Äù because coming up with gay theories for songs is very fun regardless of what the actual songwriter said. anyway, the commonly-accepted explanation for this song is harry being with a woman who‚Äôs really into bdsm hence all the ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got me tied down‚Äùs present in the lyrics. another interpretation of the song is that this is about their management restricting their freedom, although from my own experiences this interpretation was basically only popular for a year at most. i can see you scratching your chin and thinking, ‚Äúbut wait, u/MoonlightByWindow, both of these theories have merit‚Äù. funnily enough, i agree! but bear with me here - let‚Äôs look at the other material. the song opens with ‚Äúwho‚Äôs that shadow holding me hostage? / i‚Äôve been here for days‚Äù - we get the information that harry doesn‚Äôt know who he‚Äôs being held hostage by, despite being ‚Äòtrapped‚Äô there for days. of course, the shadow could easily be another person but let‚Äôs go with the interpretation that it‚Äôs actually harry himself. a shadow is, obviously, a reflection of yourself - i believe this song shares lyrical themes with bts‚Äô singularity, another song which talks about [reflections and being closeted](https://genius.com/Genius-english-translations-bts-intro-singularity-english-translation-lyrics) (only it‚Äôs much more obviously gay). if we assume that this shadow in the room is harry‚Äôs reflection, we can also assume that he feels some kind of disconnect to this part of himself, considering he describes it as a shadow and holding him hostage. perhaps it‚Äôs his public image, the face he has to present to the world in order to be accepted. perhaps it‚Äôs the exact opposite, his true self forced to live his days sheltered in darkness. next is ‚Äúwho‚Äôs this whisper telling me that i‚Äôm never gonna get away?‚Äù - once again, we‚Äôre unclear on who the whisper is. i took this to be a commentary on the ‚Äòtrappings of fame‚Äô, so to speak, where once you reach a certain level of fame it‚Äôs difficult to ever lose all of that fame. essentially, harry will always be put under a microscope and he‚Äôll never be free. ‚Äúi know they‚Äôll be coming to find me soon / but i fear i‚Äôm getting used to being held by you‚Äù - who is You here? the song seems to imply that it‚Äôs the same entity as the shadow/whisper, but i feel like there‚Äôs some kind of separation between the two as it appears that harry knows who You is. i think You is, drum roll please, A MAN!! whoever They are, they are presented as outsiders to the relationship between harry and You, with harry treasuring the time he has with this mysterious You before he‚Äôs inevitably found by Them. this also seems like the start of a moment where harry‚Äôs realised he‚Äôs unfortunately fallen in love with You (‚Äúi fear i‚Äôm getting used‚Ä¶‚Äù). i don‚Äôt have a whole lot to say about the chorus apart from the ‚Äúbaby i‚Äôll never leave if you keep holding me this way‚Äù line - obviously this is where the song‚Äôs central theme of ‚Äòstockholm syndrome‚Äô comes from, but i also believe this is about the relationship harry has with You (a man). harry remains closeted so he can stay with You in secret - and he starts to enjoy it! ‚Äúwho's this man that's holding your hand and talking 'bout your eyes? / used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind‚Äù - this further supports what i just said, especially the second line. i also think it‚Äôs possible to say that these lines actually come from the perspective of You, or at least a second perspective - up till now this song has entirely been about/coming from ‚Äúme‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äù. i especially believe the second line is about harry in a third-person perspective - he no longer wants to be ‚Äúfree‚Äù, either because of You or a different reason. although this song is, obviously, about enjoying his lack of freedom, how happy would one be with constrained freedom in reality? this theme of a rocky relationship seems to come up a lot in harry‚Äôs songwriting (see kiwi and fine line title track). the rest of the song is fairly nondescript, apart from this line in the bridge - ‚Äúbut now together we‚Äôre alone / and there‚Äôs no other place i‚Äôd ever wanna go‚Äù. i find the juxtaposition of ‚Äútogether‚Äù and ‚Äúalone'' fascinating - the most likely interpretation is that the relationship isn‚Äôt entirely happy (after all, it‚Äôs basically established to be a rocky relationship in the song) but i like the interpretation that due to their relationship, they are truly Alone with a capital A. they only have each other in the world because they are shunned by everybody else. anyway gay rights and thanks for coming to my ted talk, it‚Äôs just for fun!

2014BoyBands: 
**emmaelf** (11): ask me to rate back in 2014 and this would never have got my 11. it's not the best written song, it hasn't got the best melody and it's not the most interesting dynamically. yet here we are. it is what it is.

**followingfreeways** (11): i want this tattooed on the inside of my vaginal walls

**hhiggy** (11): this is just quite literally the greatest song ever made

**RandomHypnotica** (11): this will be the 2nd time i'm giving my 11 to a song with Stockholm Syndrome in the title, hopefully this is also a win

**Shelly\_AO29** (11): I knew this would be my pick for 11 the minute this rate was announced. My favourite One Direction song, it is just perfection in every way.

**1998tweety** (10): one of if not their best b-side

**akanewasright** (10): me when I make myself like a new Charli single

**Alumineous** (10): I‚Äôm Stockholm syndromed to like this song because Spaces and Clouds sucked ass.

**bigbigbee** (10): makes me do Martha Graham contractions in public when listening to this

**frogaranaman** (10): popheads should be familiar with this concept!

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): god what a fucking bop. again that I think Harry's songwriting might've peaked in 1D.

**Roxieloxie** (10): *harry styles voice* Its a song about a nympho

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): me when Ricki and Roxie turn me into a Directioner for a rate

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this song is soooo good!! another 11 contender. whenever the next popheads post talks about missed single opportunities - IT'S THIS SONG

**timothy444** (10): I've come this far into a 1D relisten of FOUR and I'm noticing how influenced this is by easy listening music in the 80s and "Stockholm Syndrome" is the most 80s sounding track especially giving me "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" vibes here.

**twat\_brained** (10): no surprise one of the best songs on this album is in 12/8 where do you think Carly got the idea

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Who‚Ä¶ who came up with the idea to name the best song on this album‚Ä¶ *that*

**Verdantshade** (10): harry's solo version is cool and all but the version from the leaked weed video is still the best idc, also 'used to sing bout being free but now he's changed his mind' has to be one of the best lines on the album

**wavingwolves** (10): i agree with everything gucci has to say about this song being gay and whatnot

**you2009** (10): what does sweden have to do with any of this

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): The bass and drums in this >>>

**waluigiest** (9): the melodies are so crisp

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): i am so touch starved bye

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): kings of educating the masses on what Stockholm syndrome is and then having people questioning this song‚Äôs concept

**TiltControls** (8.5): that beat is hypnotic

**Bordersz** (8.2): Another potential single.

**roboticpandora** (8): bah-di-di-dah OH!

**throwaway-7650** (8): it's giving thrill ride (aka annoying but it's still a bop)

**welcome2thejam** (8): Oh, this some real fanfic shit

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (8): what gucci said

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): That ‚Äúwoah‚Äù noise thing in the chorus really elevates this for me.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): A little dated but bop

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): me when I rack up dozens of plays on Solar Power convincing myself no its actually good

**rotating3Dtext** (7): kinda creepy

**apatel27** (6.5): It has potential but squanders it with a muted instrumental

**Novuspyra** (6.5): I think this is a good song. But a lot of people in the fandom treat this as if it's the best song in the album and I just don't think that's true.

**babadork** (6.4): I would probably like this a bit more if they didn‚Äôt give Louis and Niall any lines.

**bulforster** (6.3): this is competent, but missing a little punch, just like the rest of Harry's solo music!

**starlitsuns** (6): we do not like appropriating crime mental illness things <3

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I cannot imagine having a fanbase that hacks airport security cameras to watch me and then knowingly releasing a song romanticizing kidnapping

**moonagenightmares** (4.5): that chorus is so annoying

**IIIHenryIII** (4): this is one out of the 5 songs I had previously heard, and I don't remember it being so boring. Guess it aged like milk

**martian\_pet** (4): did John Ryan produce this while asleep?

**pig-serpent** (4): The Latch we have at home, stream Muse.

**2dina3dworld** (1): how many ‚Äúmy parents sold me to One Direction‚Äù fanfics did this inspire?

**Stryxen** (1): this hook is a disease are you ready to die one direction

**thedoctordances1940** (1): don't see how anybody could like this song without stockholm syndrome

**timothy444** (11): Really should have been the lead single instead of She Looks So Perfect. Just everything about this screams pure 2014 pop punk energy with a little bit of catchiness bubblegum pop thrown onto it.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): i think is their most *fun* song and probably the epitome of a teen pop/punk sound

**Alumineous** (10): Lol this had a 2 initially but I couldn‚Äôt deny it anymore, I knew all the words and can sing to this song. I can‚Äôt hate this song.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I love rock music.

**fadedblue09** (10): nostalgic

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): the fact that 5SOS made the Don't Stop Tier in their tier list is deserved. it's a fucking bop and a half but it's a very weird song that's just sort of there for them at the same time.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): why do i have feeling like this will be a surprise runnerup

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): KNOW IT! KNOW IT! KNOW IT! i just got the most intense flashbacks to when this song was inescapable on uk radio

**poemforsmallthings** (10): yeah

**Roxieloxie** (10): The video for this is far more vivid in my head for some reason than the song is

**throwaway-7650** (10): this song is ~~the reason I'm~~ gay (she/her pronouns #OUT)

**wavingwolves** (10): NO WAY! NO WAY! NO WAY!

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (10): i‚Äôm choosing to ignore lyrics for one song look the other way

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): this song is great y‚Äôall are just haters

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): ‚Äúi ask you for your number / said you dont have a phone‚Äù damn she‚Äôs just like me fr

**akanewasright** (9.5): pop that cat, mm mm just like that, mm mm shake that shit, mm mm work it bitch

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): don‚Äôt stop more like Do Bop!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): why do songs called don't stop always go off

**celladonn** (9): It's fun!

**emmaelf** (9): i feel like i should prefer a deepcut but no i prefer this

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): This song is good stop pretending it's not

**runaway3212** (9): beyond basic, just like me

**bulforster** (8.7): This feels like 5sos' only shot at winning and I hope it does well bc 1D doesn't actually deserve to Paramore this thing. I wish I could score it higher but the bridge is just a bit of a letdown, the rest is great.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Why is every song called Don't Stop a massive bop.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): when I think about this era of pop punk it sounds exactly like this

**roboticpandora** (8): I love a statement-making drum open.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): Foster the People are shaking

**Shelly\_AO29** (8): Cute bop. Love the chorus buildup.

**TiltControls** (8): I think they could've done more here, but it's fun

**Verdantshade** (8): basic bitch song but bops

**welcome2thejam** (8): I am begging my brain to remember where I know this song from (edit: oh god was it the rate trailer and I'm just making up memories???)

**twat\_brained** (7.6): hasn't aged the best for numerous reasons but this is still very riveting

**seanderlust** (7.5): she told you she doesn't have a phone and is pushing you off...i'm sorry to tell you bestie i don't think she likes you

**wannabemusiccritic** (7.5): I loved this song so much back then, I remember I thought it was better than ‚ÄúShe Looks So Perfect‚Äù. I now definitely think that ‚ÄúShe Looks So Perfect‚Äù is better x

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): it was a disappointing single after she looks so perfect ngl

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): noWEH noWEH noWEH

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Perfectly serviceable instrumental for a pop rock song but the chorus is just fine, but also I kind of groove to it.

**apatel27** (6): A neat pop punk track

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): this is indie pop rock @ hypno and creme

**skargardin** (6): Oh.. it's this song

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): "everytime you move to the beat / it gets harder" üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è

**moonagenightmares** (3): i cant stand this song im pretty sure ive heard it in some fanvid before

The redemption arc this got, Mitski would be proud.

Another fan favorite that has gotten mass support from fans and the participants of this rate, and rightfully so. This is just lovely to listen to. The harmonies, the lyrics, the guitar... it's all like a comforting hug from your favorite 5 boys<3

This might not be a winner, but I genuinely think the jump in average and placement from its past rate is memorable enough.

---

**akanewasright** (11): This was the first 1D song I ever *really* fell in love with. I think I love everything about it, from the guitar to the vocal choices to the way I could float on the melody for the rest of my life. I feel lucky I wasn‚Äôt into this stuff when I was young, bc I could have fallen for all the culty boyband stuff off this song alone

**Alumineous** (11): This is the only song that deserves the 11. Not just in this album. The entire RATE. Where was this throughout the album?

**ignitethephoenix** (11): classic, one of their best songs!!!

**letsallpoo** (11): this is the greatest song of all time

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): like possibly my favourite song ever #lol i really have nothing else to say, it‚Äôs just perfect

**Roxieloxie** (11): I dont know why im acting like any of the other songs had a chance for my 11 this song is my literal fucking baby it broke my heart not to 11 in it in charity so im so happy I get to do it now. I dont know how to condense down 7 yeears of love into this one comment, Its so wonderful and just feels like coming home in more ways than one. This is the sonic equivalent of being hugged by music i love love love this so much.

**runaway3212** (11): it yassed, it slayed, it proofed them fires

**wavingwolves** (11): this is the second time i'm 11ing this and if this ever gets to another rate i'm instantly 11ing it again

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (11): this song is straight up perfection and i will not have anyone argue with me on that

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): one direction could make yellow submarine but the beatles couldn't make fireproof.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this going out at #40 at the charity rate to going out at #4 in this rate, ugh thats character development luv

**seanderlust** (10): i know this has a lot of campaigning for rate winner. while it's not my 11, i will not stand in its way because this is quite nice.

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): A fantastic song, one of their best. Their voices blend so well together and it‚Äôs one of the song‚Äôs strengths, along with its production.

**starlitsuns** (10): this three track stretch between Night Changes and Fireproof is some of the best music out there, holy heck. Fireproof was a cultural reset waiting to happen before the concept of cultural resets was a thing

**throwaway-7650** (10): the 2nd half of the chorus is actually the pinnacle of all music*

**TiltControls** (10): Fan fave for a reason. Either this or Night Changes winning would be perfect

**timothy444** (10): OMG I remember downloading this for free on their website when they released it on their website as a promotional single. That beside, I gave this a 9 in the charity rate but honestly it deserves a 10 because it's such a cute slow jam that feels really good in the ears

**twat\_brained** (10): that meme of Stockholm being a trojan horse for Harry's career is funny but I propose that we attribute this song to Niall's solo career

**Verdantshade** (10): the sheer panic of being on twitter one day and seeing people say that they've dropped a song.. on their website.. for free.. and it's not a pop song.. this has to be in the discussion for their most iconic songs, it's so cosy and warm and mum loves it

**wannabemusiccritic** (10): So criminally underrated, one of my favorite 1D songs x

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (10): i cant fucking believe the strongest three song run in this entire rate cycle is in a fucking one direction album

**Bordersz** (9.5): This will age like wine too and get retrospective acclaim. It is the perfect Fall song. Liam sang on that bridge had rent due 2 weeks ago.

**emmaelf** (9.5): if someone wanted a song that best showed late-stage one direction i'd probably give them this one.

**jasannn** (9.5): It‚Äôs giving Golden Hour.

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): this kinda sounds like the style of songs harry styles would go on to make as a soloist

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): definitely grew on me since the charity rate this was in

**cremeebrulee** (9.4): ‚Äúi think i‚Äôm gonna lose my mind‚Äù me when this comes in 40th again in winners 3

**mary (ricki‚Äôs sister)** (9): good but what did it do for the economy?

**skargardin** (9): the harmonies are chefskiss

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): This kinda sounds like a Coldplay song to me but like one of the slay ones.

**frogaranaman** (8): now why does this guitar sound like "Holocene" by Bon Iver

**bulforster** (7.7): I gave this a 6 in the charity rate and I can't really tell if I'm just grading on a different curve here or if it's actually grown on me

**roboticpandora** (7.5): The electric guitar interludes are cool and I really like the bridge and the chorus but the verses just aren't hitting for me.

**1998tweety** (7): cute

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): not fully on board with the love for this but it is definitely good

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): I don't get the hype with this one

**babadork** (6.2): The last chorus slaps, but it takes too long to build up to it.

**pig-serpent** (6): This song wasn't made for me but it's respectable enough.

**moonagenightmares** (5.3): i dont get the hype for this

**apatel27** (5): Repetition can be good but this ain't it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): like it's fine

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Bland-ish

**thedoctordances1940** (4.3): a song so mid the only thing i can comment about it is how ridiculously mid it is

**2dina3dworld** (4): someone congratulate me for raising my score two points since Charity Rate

**Novuspyra** (4): I know a lot of people like this one, but it just sounds flat and one-note to me.

**fadedblue09** (2): My second time rating this and frankly, I still don't get it? Apologies to the fans but this is just standard acoustic pop filler track to me. Nothing stood out at all, other than maybe Zayn's annoying adlibs.

**IIIHenryIII** (0): one of my friends told me that was one of their favorite songs ever a while ago, I gave it a try and... well, let's just say that it didn't go well when I stated my opinion. I hate this!

*This blurb contains sponsored content*

Given how much shit I saw this song get over the "product placement" and the general disdain towards The Vamps and 5SOS, i didn't think this would be their highest song, even less so high in the ranking. For a lot of the period when I was taking ballots, this was the winner,,,, and in all honesty I wanted it to stay like that, I mean, another rate where One Direction absolutely dominated Day 3 just to loss once again? I'm sorry that's just hilarious, but the universe didn't support my comedic aspirations, but this is still a very decent showing.


Thank you so much to this rate's sponsor, American Apparel ‚Ñ¢. Don't forget to use my promo code in the description to get 15% off in your next purchase.

---

**astrologicalangel** (11): I used to pretend I didn't like this song but life is too short for that, one of the best songs of 2014

**IIIHenryIII** (11): I don't care what anyone says, this song is so perfect

**mary (ricki‚Äôs sister)** (11): this was the moment

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): as an aussie it's my due diligence to give this my 11. appreciate some might find the lyrics corny but you can't deny it's an absolute banger, amazing vocals and SUPER CATCHY

**wannabemusiccritic** (11): I‚Äôm a little biased bc of the nostalgia and it‚Äôs probably not the ‚Äúbest‚Äù song in this rate but whatever it‚Äôs an 11 in my heart lol it never fails to uplift my mood and get me to sing along, to this day x

**1998tweety** (10): absolute classic, whew that chorus

**2dina3dworld** (10): throwback to the ‚Äúwearing your boyfriends underwear‚Äù discourse we had

**akanewasright** (10): sometimes stupid things are good!

**Alumineous** (10): But someone has to tell me why this band is obsessed with American things.

**Bordersz** (10): Perfect single, they really came out swinging on this song. It aged a lot better than expected. The melodies are insanely catchy.

**celladonn** (10): Cringe

**emayzee** (10): a band in 2014 trying to make a song that sounds like 2004 while singing about a mixtape straight out of '94......and it works on every level

**frogaranaman** (10): this song is gay male coded

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): this song is insanely catchy, single-handedly gave American Apparel one last gasp of life, and goes OFF live.

**hhiggy** (10): something shifted.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): that hook is just mammoth

**jasannn** (10): Were they sponsored?

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): what a banger omfg i remember when i used to watch mtv hits where they would play the uk top 40 every week and when this music video came on i saw luke and literally started hyperventilating bc i thought he was so hot...anyways now i'm a lesbian. try harder next time luke

**Novuspyra** (10): This song perfectly encapsulates the theme of this whole rate, and this era of pop music.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): i almost wanna lower my score for the embarrassing memories i have tied to this song

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): No song will ever come close to the serotonin i felt when i heard this song for the first time

**runaway3212** (10): this mv is pg everyday - ariana mv

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): just like that lipstick stain, sometimes product placement is art!!

**starlitsuns** (10): okay this is much more of a banger than all of Meet The Vamps was, also this song I remember although this will not be the case for most of five sauce lmao

**teenwitches** (10): on first listen i really wanted to hate this because i thought it was very ‚Äú14 year old discovers pop punk‚Äù but it‚Äôs honestly just so much fun it grew on me almost immediately

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): the end of this music video‚Ä¶don‚Äôt tease us like that wtf

**wavingwolves** (9.9): this song is a time capsule in itself

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): its fun what can i say

**bluetriangles04** (9): the pop punk revitalization is actually due to this song releasing in 2014... in this essay I will...

**hikk** (9): no bc it's a bop... i can't excuse that one line though

**roboticpandora** (9): This song is so much fun!! If I didn't know better I would have thought these dudes were straight out of the Central Valley, and I mean that as a compliment.

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): Super catchy and fun song. It would have been a 10 if not for the insanely dated lyrics.

**you2009** (9): this classic

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): the clutch American Apparel had on people this era ‚Ä¶ rip to the overpriced basic clothing store

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): i still don't understand the random american apparel shoutout

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): rip american apparel the grasp you had on my classmates was unbearable

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): Gonna be honest this would be an easy 10 if it weren‚Äôt for the product placement.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this aged well surprisingly

**twat\_brained** (8.5): fuck you Todd one bad lyric doesn't make this song one of the worst of 2014

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): this one's dumb fun. american apparel line sucks of course but other than that it's good

**fadedblue09** (8): I can't stand product placement in songs but BOP

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I can‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs wearing his underwear, that‚Äôs nasty. 5SOS did NOT look like they showered during this era

**ImADudeDuh** (8): why were people so offended at the ‚ÄúAmeriacn Apparel underwear‚Äù line tbh

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): ‚ÄúAmerican Apparel underwear‚Äù is rightfully slandered but can we talk about how ‚ÄúYour lipstick stain is a work of art‚Äù is a legit amazing line??? Now *that* is poetry

**Verdantshade** (8): single handedly made american apparel cool again, your fav could never

**welcome2thejam** (8): Can't believe they sold out to Big Underwear smdh

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): god this sucks so much

**poemforsmallthings** (7.7): you're in class. PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON

**apatel27** (7): good first single to set up they're the fuckboy versions of 1D

**bigbigbee** (7): This was the song I‚Äôd heard before this album, and I definitely wasn‚Äôt inclined to check 5SOS out based on that alone, so I‚Äôm so glad this rate gave me the opportunity to learn more, because I really liked a lot of stuff here!

**pig-serpent** (7): I'm fairly amazed this charted.  This type of rock was popular in 2009, not 2014.  In fact, 2014 was a terrible year for rock music.  I'm not complaining, just...

**synchronisedchaos** (7): i can still remember the first time I heard this song

**waluigiest** (7): I get the appeal but it‚Äôs not for me

**throwaway-7650** (6.9): this song is (a part of) the reason I'm gay (no ?s)

**babadork** (6.6): I tried, but I can‚Äôt get over their American Apparel underwear.

**bulforster** (6.5): product placement can sure buy some shiny production!

**plastichaxan** (6): the ‚Äúhey‚Äùs were kinda annoying but kinda shook im not disliking this wow

**rotating3Dtext** (6): american apparel underwear

**skargardin** (6): I've always been pretty indifferent on this idk

**timothy444** (6): Looking back, this song was a bit cringey to listen to especially in the chorus where they started singing about American Apparel which give me dead banana energy

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (6): main line aside, never tattoo someone‚Äôs name! Especially if you‚Äôre in a boyband and there‚Äôs probably a song about how she breaks up with you later down the line of this album!

**Stryxen** (5.2): https://tenor.com/view/white-gay-gay-lgbtq-squad-squad-goals-gif-19878144

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): I don‚Äôt do rates to hear lyrics about underwear

**TiltControls** (5): Something something product placement

**seanderlust** (4): I put my hands on the keys of my keyboard. I begin to type out a comment: "who? the girl reading th" I stop to pause. I glance over at a yellow post-it note stuck to my screen that reads in heavy handwriting: "WRITERS NOTE: STOP making early 2010s tumblr jokes in your writing!!!!" groaning, I hit the backspace until the field is clear, type in "flop", and hit the skip button.

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): This chorus is so dumb and this song is like 80% chorus

IIIHenryIII: I was never a big fan of their albums if I'm being honest, but I do find their first three albums somewhat enjoyable. I think Midnight Memories is my favorite. 

Yeah, I find the sound of FOUR very generic. I feel like they tried to sound more mature to be taken more seriously but the final product was not up for my taste. MITAM is a little bit better than this one, but I just feel like they went downhill. Perfect is the only song I truly like from their 2 last albums.

don't think you guys will understand the pain and horror of hosting 5 rates, and each time see your 11 get SO CLOSE, but always so far away from that win.

I really wanted this to win, it just felt correct. The fan favorite, the single that never was. Imagine the cries and complains Cruel Summer got, but add to it the fact that regardless of how much campaign fans did, and even recognition from the group themselves, it just would not become a single because of 1D's missing limb. No Control never got the mass recognition it deserved, but at the very least it got tons from the fandom, and surprisingly, this rate. At one point the winner of this rate had an average of like 8.3, so for the runner up to cross the 9 average was a dream come true. After all the disrespect almost every song here got, I felt some vindication seeing the raters reciprocate the respect the clear frontrunners of the rate got.

---

**bigbigbee** (11): I don‚Äôt know why this song is so good, it just gets lodged inside your brain and never leaves and makes you want to dance around like a fool

**bulforster** (11): The 1D stans probably have more specific reasons for 11ing this, I just think it's easily the best song in the rate.

**celladonn** (11): Legitimately their best song, I cannot believe this wasn't a single. So much energy and the bridge is immaculate. Louis has never sounded better.

**cremeebrulee** (11): this song could have just be the ‚Äúin the heat where you lay / i could stay right here and burn in it all day‚Äù line and i would still 11 it. idk what it says about me as a person that my two favorite one direction songs are basically their two horniest ones, but they‚Äôre just TOO good at penning them

**emayzee** (11): louis's rent was DUE and he delivered

**hikk** (11): they put their cocks into this so much that it's literally about them

**rotating3Dtext** (11): this song being on just dance made me think this was some big single but no, it doesn‚Äôt even have a video. it‚Äôs so fun tho

**skargardin** (11): This is SUCH a fun song

**starlitsuns** (11): okay. first and foremost the choice for Modest to only give this album 2 singles whereas all the previous albums had at least 3 singles is horrendous. yes, Zayn left the band before the campaign to make this a single happened, but IT'S SO GOOD. this not being a single is a crime like Taylor Swift not sending Cruel Summer and Lorde not sending Supercut to radio. this singlehandedly would have been #1 on the Hot 100, and I just have to say fuck you Modest Management. you have no control over my love for this song.

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): Is this song a metaphor???

**throwaway-7650** (11): the chorus is actually the pinnacle of ALL music ever recorded

**twat\_brained** (11): the quintessential One Direction song. Godney bless Directioners for doing Modest's job for them I miss y'all

**akanewasright** (10): Why wasn‚Äôt this a single? Like actually why the fuck wasn‚Äôt this a single?

**Alumineous** (10): This was a grower‚Ä¶ pun intended. I love a good song about sex. Louis and his morning wood. Morning sex. Zayn tasting the vagina. One Direction, you nasty‚Ä¶ but in a family friendly way lol.

**babadork** (10): I seriously contemplated giving this my 11, even though I‚Äôm not sure that I actually think it‚Äôs that good. Louis should always kind of shout his parts. It strikes the perfect balance between horny and stupid.

**bluetriangles04** (10): a fun poppy anthem that yes, as mentioned in the description, SHOULD have been a single, and basically became an unofficial due to the rapid spread of the campaign for it to be one LOL

**emmaelf** (10): i always think i can resist and then... WAAAAAKING UP half a mark knocked off for them doing this on the national embarrassment that is carpool karaoke and then reinstated because the dance was amusing.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): There's an incredible fan-animated storyboard video for this on youtube that I like to pretend was the legitimate video because I want a 1D heist video damnit.

**hhiggy** (10): CLASSICCCC

**ignitethephoenix** (10): horny anthem

**jasannn** (10): I feel blessed to have seen the most stadium-ready song in concert and I still have a snapchat video saved.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE!! FUCK YOU ~~HYBE~~ SYCO

**Novuspyra** (10): This would've probably gotten my 11 if I didn't overplay it so much. In fact, I'd bet a good amount of money that this is my most played One Direction song of all time by a large margin.

**poemforsmallthings** (10): if Liam's nasty ass doesn't go and take a SHOWER?

**Roxieloxie** (10): BUY NO CONTROL ON ITUNES #PROJECTNOCONTROL WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE YOUTH OF BRAZIL LEAKED FOUR STANDARD EDITION EARLY AND SANG OVER THIS CLASSIC.

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): An amazing song. At first I didn‚Äôt really get this song, but when it clicked, man did I regret not liking it earlier. Why wasn‚Äôt this a single???!! Sigh, what could have been.

**teenwitches** (10): * still can‚Äôt believe the fandom had to push this song onto the charts bc the label wouldn‚Äôt make it a single

**timothy444** (10): A nice and underrated pop song

**Verdantshade** (10): kinda mad he didn't play this when I saw him solo but it's great that he has a signature song.. I also just want to take this opportunity to remind everyone why louis is the GOAT, he held the band together with his songwriting talent (his solo stuff is literally 1d but make it oasis) and has come out of the massive amount of shit thrown his way by people and life itself even stronger than ever, to me louis is the soul of 1d, and if you took out the songs he wrote and the harmonies he provided in all the songs there would be nothing left - he deserves all the love in the world and I will also blast this song from every rooftop till the day I die

**wavingwolves** (10): forever thinking about how we tried to make this a single and i actually let my laptop looping it on both spotify and youtube for days on end just for it to be completely ignored OMFGG but we were right, this should've been a single!!!!!

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (10): this did not have the right to go this hard

**roboticpandora** (9.5): This reminds me of the Kooks, in a very good way! Also love a chorus built around a dick joke.

**1998tweety** (9): No cause that chorus is euphoric

**fadedblue09** (9): The only fan favorite deepcut that lived up to the hype for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I feel like fans ‚Äúself-releasing this as a single‚Äù was a moment that did irreversible damage to online fan culture but like, at the same time, they had a point

**runaway3212** (9): this is worse than fireproof and night changes

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): banger

**TiltControls** (8.5): keyboards missing their bottom left key

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): I like it! nice change of pace that was definitely needed

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Finally another slapper on this tracklist!

**Bordersz** (8): Once again Zayn slid on the bridge‚Ä¶elevating the song.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): https://i.imgur.com/CeC6kjV.png what‚Äôs better than that? Just guys being dudes

**jackisboredtoday** (8): this dance routine is the best thing j@mes c0rden has ever done

**seanderlust** (7.9): I would say it's horny on main but it feels just a touch too subtle for that...maybe like, horny on an alt account that everyone knows is your alt? anyways it does kind of bop

**apatel27** (7.5): Didn't expect them to make a song this obvious about fucking

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (7.5): we get it y‚Äôall have sex‚Ä¶also lowkey overrated

**IIIHenryIII** (7): this is kinda nice actually

**pig-serpent** (7): The extra energy of this song goes a long way but it's hard to feel like a lot of other bands don't do this type of song better.

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): It's a catchy song but very much giving r/ihavesex and y'all only hype it up as much as you do bc it's Louis like only solo song lol

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): the chorus is super good but the verses kinda flop

**Stryxen** (5.9): i kinda like this‚Ä¶ in a 5.9 way

**thedoctordances1940** (5.7): so catchy yet so midaf

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Ew

Here we have it folks, our rate winner.

In all honesty, I might have the only person that thought One Direction wimning this rate wasn't guaranteed, especially after seeing 2 different 5SOS songs take the top spot briefly (or not so briefly, given that for the first few weeks every ballot I got had multiple days in between them), but once this and No Control cemented themselves in the top 2, it was clear that 1D wouldn't meet the same embarrassing fate they suffered last time we rated one of their albums.

This feels like a correct winner, yes, not very shocking, but no one can be too mad at this winning. Night Changes is one of the 1D songs I know I can call modern classics with no shame. It has stood the test of time, resourfacing on TikTok for various trends and proving that even years after the group's "hiatus" lacking the chokehold they had in the general public, this is still a hit. 

Smooth, intimate, romantic. This is the perfect boy band jam. A song with such delicate caress that you can't help but get inmersed in the words they sing, pondering about the passing of time. This song does sting harder the older it gets; I can't help but remembered when I first heard this song at 13, and just compared how different my life is now at 21, how much the boys' careers have differed from their One Direction days, it makes it sting a little thinking about the old days where my biggest worry was hitting the Tumblr reblog limit, so I guess they were right, it does drive me crazy just how fast the night changes, but if there's one one thing time will never change is my love for this song.

2014BoyBands: 
**1998tweety** (11): The "POV: You're on a date with One Direction" MV is such a classic, they really knew how to get the girls and gays going. Besides that the song is so good.

**fadedblue09** (11): very heavenly instrumentation, and the vocals remind me of 90s boygroups with R&B-ish harmonies, and all of their vocals work well here individually

**frogaranaman** (11): STOP I DON'T NEED TO CRY TONIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (11): oh my god

**jackisboredtoday** (11): no deep comment but this is just a stunner. Easily top 3 in their catalog and maybe #1

**jasannn** (11): I know the chorus melody is so overused but I love it so much.

**Novuspyra** (11): It was close between Night Changes and No Control, but whenever Night Changes plays, I am once again a 17 year old laying down on my bed with headphones in and smiling at the ceiling, counting down the days until the next bit of One Direction content, and it's a time I look back on with fondness.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): this sounds like a classic song because it is

**seanderlust** (11): this is gorgeous. idk if this is a reach but the production kind of gives me SOPHIE's it's okay to cry teas - at least on the intro. all the boys sound good here

**TiltControls** (11): I've got over 1000 plays of this. There was no way it was ever not going to be my 11

**welcome2thejam** (11): Prior to this rate, I only knew a handful of 1D songs: singles mainly. A few I hated, a few I liked, most left me indifferent. But I remember this hearing for the first time long after their breakup on some year-end hit ranking list, and I loved it immediately, it left me floored. Just the perfect amount of wistfulness, the bittersweet, and nostalgia. I don't know if I'll ever gain that much of a connection to this scene, but I'll always have Night Changes.

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (11): what do you want from me

**you2009** (11): having [wayne's world tattoo] no ragrets is all that she really wants

**2dina3dworld** (10): Niall I am free tonight if you need company

**akanewasright** (10): this song feels like a hug and the music video is vile for making anyone think otherwise

**Alumineous** (10): Beautiful song, beautiful backing vocals in the chorus. Innocence she lost, presumably THAT night? Zayn, you nasty.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Even the most irony-poisoned hipsters had to admit this one was good.

**celladonn** (10): One of their best singles for sure

**emayzee** (10): the key change and just the whole last minute of this song destroys me every time

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): sometimes I think that "does it ever drive you crazy just how fast the night changes?" has become a meme lyric of the 2010s rather like simple plan's "how could this happen to me? i've made my mistakes" line and I love that.

**mary (ricki‚Äôs sister)** (10): the dream smp has committed many sins but ruining this song for me is something I‚Äôll never forgive them

**moonagenightmares** (10): an 11 contender but i always go with my heart than what has a bigger chance of winning sawry

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): one of their few great singles like why were so many of their singles lowkey the worst song(s) on their respective album. anyway zayn looked so hot this era

**pig-serpent** (10): Many other songs on this album feel suffocated, but this one is wide open and with the added energy from the drums it's very easy to get into.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): one of their best songs?

**poemforsmallthings** (10): Niall's face when he sings while looking at the camera is the funniest part of the video

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): Fantastic song gets better with every listen

**rotating3Dtext** (10): THIS is where that phrase comes from?

**runaway3212** (10): this was literally almost my 11, but in the end fireproof deserved it more

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): One of the best One Direction songs. The background vocals in the chorus and sparse production truly add to the beauty of this song, it is so well crafted. The lyrics are also beautiful. The video is amazing as well, even covered in pasta Zayn is still insanely beautiful!

**skargardin** (10): this song is like a warm hug ugh I LOVE it

**starlitsuns** (10): this is just so perfect as a love song, I really hope this doesn't get fucked over by balladphobia <3

**timothy444** (10): A solid pop track with emotionally mature instrumentation and lyricism on it. The fact that it's a single is even more incredible and the song just sounds incredibly authentic.

**twat\_brained** (10): one of the greatest boyband songs of all time argue with the wall

**Verdantshade** (10): my vote for the band's best single is probably this or perfect.. but probably this - really lovely storytelling while making you long to be that cool girl, and now the nostalgia just hits different in your 20s :((

**wavingwolves** (10): honestly i've cried to this countless times and every single time i listen to it i think about the passage of time and how afraid i'm of having my life pass through me without me noticing... which i think is happening and i become aware of it every time i listen to this witch brings me such overwhelming feelings and then i instantly forget about it by the time no control starts playing because that song is a banger and it clears my mind of sad thoughts

**Bordersz** (9.9): This song aged like WINE.

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): .1 point off for the video [2]. This was one of my least favorites for a while but as the years have gone on its grown on me HARD, like,,, damn,,,,their right, we ARE only getting older baby,,,,,

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): this song is already pretty somber on its own, but i can't listen to it without thinking about my last semester at uni when my best friend and i would just spend nights just driving around our small college town, blasting this with the windows down and promising each other that we'll stay close even after graduation (we didn't) (i miss her a lot)

**apatel27** (9.5): Loses half a point for the MV

**throwaway-7650** (9.1): love these lyrics being used as every twitter caption EVER

**bluetriangles04** (9): does it ever drive you crazy... just how fast a boygroup lineup changes...

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): is this gonna win? alright

**hhiggy** (9): zayn looked too good in this mv

**teenwitches** (9): https://youtu.be/9380gVyp-Gw

**wannabemusiccritic** (9): Easily their best single x

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): not my favorite by them but still a classic

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): the music video made this. also idk why it was a single when there's much better choices but anyway

**martian\_pet** (8): Zayn's the sultriest vocalist of the group iktr!

**roboticpandora** (8): a solid soft-rock ballad.

**waluigiest** (8): from tiktok???

**bulforster** (7.8): 1D are definitely the only band here with the range to actually make a slow song like this work for them

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): finally a somewhat not so bad song

**babadork** (7): I can‚Äôt figure out how to interpret ‚Äúeverything she never had, she‚Äôs showing off‚Äù that isn‚Äôt insulting her mom‚Äôs body.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): this is the nicest score I can give this song, which is cute, but the music video makes me deeply uncomfortable. The music video is what gave us this rate, tbh! The chorus is great, the verses are still giving me ‚Äúi‚Äôm such a great boyfriend :)‚Äù stuff that I feel too ancient for as this was not my era lol

**Stryxen** (7): the music video is a 0 but ZAYN in the video is an 11

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It‚Äôs kinda boring? But at least it‚Äôs not bad

**thedoctordances1940** (4.6): <:midaf:918597087510286386>

**emmaelf** (4.5): just a bit.. dare i say it.. boring. would choose perfect off next album any day. HUGELY overrated.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (2): sorry about it‚Ä¶but this song is heavily overrated, everyone gives it far too much

**Verdantshade** (8.824): this one's a pop punk classic of the 2010s and there is no denying it, early 5sos remains one of my favourite ever eras of any artist, I remember listening to shitty recordings of bops like superhero, everything I want, and voodoo doll. those were the most iconic times

**hhiggy** (8.382): this is pure nostalgia for me

**PretentiousPegasus** (8.235): This album defined my teenage years and high school experience so if y'all let it flop in this rate I'll be very upset

**GamblesWithDesire** (8.059): I discovered 5SOS through the split sources of them touring with 1D and working with one of my other favorite bands, and that was a sign of why I was doomed to love them. While the album is cheesy for sure, and gets really clunky by the end, it's also good catchy pop-punk at its poppiest and shows that 5SOS always had an insane ear for melodies from the start.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (7.676): this album is amazing and really shaped a good chunk of my high school years. i just know y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt gonna give it exactly what it deserves in this rate because FOUR exists

**throwaway-7650** (7.624): in kpop terms this would be a slay mini album

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.412): i had a lot of close friends into 5sos at the time and i just never really paid attention to them (which i was vindicated by when that rolling stones interview came out lmfao), but this album does indeed have some bops

**bigbigbee** (7.353): That run of whiny pop-punk inspired songs in the middle of the album is gooooooood shit man

**Bordersz** (7.347): I‚Äôm curious if they will re-record it w/o the autotune mess on their vocals.

**fadedblue09** (7.000): As a huge fan of pop-punk, it was no brainer that I'd like this album. They have the most consistent energy even if they don't reach the heights that pop punk can reach. That being said, the constant fetish-y/problematic lyrics ruined this for me.

**roboticpandora** (6.941): At their best, 5SOS can keep up with blink-182, Fall Out Boy, and Jimmy Eat World. But the less successful tracks can sound like b sides from a group that plays a daylight set at the Warped Tour circa 2008.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.765): Since this is the most pop punk-ish album in the whole rate it‚Äôs pretty obvious that it would end up being my favorite. But uh, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean I love it‚Ä¶ the boyband-ness of it all is very apparent.

**Alumineous** (6.588): Gonna admit that I actually listened to this album back in the day. And I remember some, but definitely forgot a lot. Which makes sense. The tracks I remembered were good, the tracks I forgot...

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.559): This album is weird because I like half of it and the other half makes me really uncomfortable

**wannabemusiccritic** (6.529): I was too young to fully pay attention to 1D when they first debuted. Also I liked 5SOS‚Äôs pop-punk sound back in 2014, so I definitely have more of an attachment to 5SOS‚Äôs music than I do to 1D. This album‚Äôs super nostalgic for me.

**skargardin** (6.412): I don't necessarily hate this but I enjoy their later work by leaps.

**plastichaxan** (6.382): I came into the rate ready to dislike it all, and while I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of a lot, there are many slays, I think this album surprised me in a way that I did not expect to have so much fun with it, even if my average isn‚Äôt the highest I quite enjoyed it, including the songs with low scores

**IIIHenryIII** (6.294): am I the only one that has a love and hate kinda thing going on with this album cover? It looks so wrong, but somehow it fits the vibe. Anyway, it's not a great album, but it has its moments. Each song, except for the ones at the end of the tracklist, has a special moment even if it's just for a second and they end up not being actually bad. Most of them have some really good melodies too.

**babadork** (6.229): I was too old for 5 Second

**Shelly\_AO29** (6.176): Revisiting this album without my judgement influenced by hardcore stanning made me realise this...wasn't that good. The singles were by far the best songs, as well as the songs they had already released before. The album could have done with some trimming, and it was clear they wrote this when they were teenagers because the immaturity on some of these songs, whew.

**welcome2thejam** (6.000): Decent power pop/pop punk, fun but thin in places. Could see them improving with more time (for what it's worth I liked Youngblood), and the aforementioned genres are heavily in my wheelhouse, so I suppose I should check out their last album eventually to see if they hit that trajectory.

**pig-serpent** (5.765): I though combining a boy band with pop punk might be interesting but I'm half convinced they robbed Boys Like Girls and took the masters to an album they had just completed writing and hadn't had time to release.  This album's mid hooks are just outclassed by what came before it.  Also why is this album so long, there's only one song on it.

**timothy444** (5.706): I really really wanted to like this album more especially since I'm starting to get more into modern pop punk music but the quality of the tracks here are just all over the place. There are some truly incredible tracks here but also some absolute awful ones.

**apatel27** (5.676): The journey from this to youngblood is pretty impressive

**bulforster** (5.565): the best album in the rate, according to me (I'm just as surprised as you are!)

**moonagenightmares** (5.441): it should be criminal to make someone listen to this much 5sos

**thedoctordances1940** (5.000): üòÇüòÇüòÇwhen the album title also contains its scoreüòÇüòÇüòÇ

**Stryxen** (4.094): great gowns

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3.206): I had... well, not high hopes, but a small amount of hope that this rate would actually be fun, and was slightly optimistic. this album completely crushed all of that optimism and laughed at me while I suffered. it is possibly the worst thing I have ever heard. the music is dollar store pop punk, the lyrics are embarrassing bad boy cosplay that sounds incredibly pathetic and juvenile, and the singing makes me wanna vomit. these songs will forever haunt me

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.969): one of the best albums ever made i really dgaf‚Ä¶this album actually had such a formative effect on me as a person it‚Äôs kinda insane lol </3 anyway 1d have the best discography ever, all their albums are at least good (four > mitam > mm > uan > tmh btw) with something for everyone so long as you‚Äôre OPEN-MINDED! i hope people grow out of 2012 and realise it‚Äôs not cool to hate on 1d anymore just because they made music for teen girls and young women‚Ä¶queer men aren‚Äôt excluded from this btw <3 they legitimately have some of the best pop songs + pop ballads ever made. i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll ever ‚Äúescape‚Äù them, i had such a fun time in fandom and i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll still be blasting their music when i‚Äôm 80. although i don‚Äôt really entirely keep up with the boys anymore i‚Äôll still have some kind of interest in them and i hope they do well with whatever they choose to do

**wavingwolves** (9.837): if i had to choose one album to define myself or my life i would choose four. music is transformative and this album was more than so for me. my time as a huge fan of one direction was very important to me and my identity, even if this might sound very far-fetched to any person who has never experienced being a fangirl. being in that community made me feel connected and like i belonged, and that was such a hard feeling to come by when i was a teenager and struggling a lot by how different i felt from my peers for lots of reasons, including the fact i saw myself as painfully queer from a very young age, and there was never a community more full of other sapphics as the one direction fandom at that time. most of the people i connected with were young women who loved other women and saw their experiences somehow reflected in one direction and their music and i don't think it's a coincidence a lot of us felt so enchanted by them and put so much of our own experiences in the meanings of their songs, even if we logically knew they weren't written with that point of view in mind and that just didn't matter. a lot of critics saw one direction's music to be insincere and a way for their main public to self insert themselves as a possible love interest, and i don't think they are wrong considering the way boy bands are marketed to young female audiences, but there were countless of us who put ourselves into the narratives of the songs as a girl who sings it to another girl and i find that to be really special. to this day, when i hear songs like i wish, home, end of the day, what a feeling, stockholm syndrome, ready to run, happily, strong, something great, alive etc i still feel amazed at how much i feel like they're a perfect expression of how i've experienced attraction towards women and i know so many of us felt the same way, all that genuine yearning for an experience you don't know if you're going to be able to have with someone you know you're attracted to. i've lived with these songs in different periods of my life to the point where i feel like listening to them just brings me back to specific moments i feel a lot of fondness for: when i hear night changes i remember crying in the bathroom floor on my 18th birthday, when i listen to change your ticket i think about singing it to my then girlfriend and now best friend (whom i met because she was also a fan of the group) while she packed her bags, when i put spaces on i think about when zayn left the group in that torturous march day and i looped it endlessly with friends at school, when ready to run starts it immediately takes me back to the first trip i took by myself with my childhood best friend to one of the most beautiful places i've ever been to, when i tune in to fireproof i think back on many times i felt comforted by that song throughout the years. it's like a scrapbook of my memories and how i've felt and how i've thought of things, and for that i think this is probably one of the most special albums i know.

**mary (ricki‚Äôs sister)** (9.556): One Direction the joke was funny let‚Äôs comeback now

**GamblesWithDesire** (9.438): Here's the deal. The pandemic kicked me headfirst back into my 1D phase and, for the last two years, 1D has been my most listened to artist. FOUR and Made in the A.M. are right up there in some of my top albums of all time now. I fucking love this album, the breadth of sounds it has, the perfect balance between bangers and ballads, the peak of OT5. There's gonna be a lot of fucking 10s here, a lot of OTT comments, and they're all ENTIRELY DESERVED.

**hhiggy** (8.813): i'm overrating the hell out of this album idgaf its 1d's best one and if you disagree you need to GROW UP

**twat\_brained** (8.794): years no calls

**Verdantshade** (8.625): four's always occupied this weird liminal space where it doesn't have the nostalgia of tmh and mm but also doesn't foreshadow their growth into solo artists the way mitam does. it's just this strange indie album in their discography that I never connected with in the same way as the rest of their albums, but there are still some days I wake up to listen to that run from girl almighty to fireproof and think to myself that this is actually their best album..

**throwaway-7650** (8.619): wow y'all weren't lying about how good this album is... y'all know who you are. also we love the character development of me going from saying I couldn't tell their voices apart at like age 12 to becoming a kpoppie and stanning for FOUR. [redacted] I'm sorry for ever making fun of 1D to you

**skargardin** (8.500): I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this album as much as I did, but there really is a surprising amount of depth to be found here. The production is varied enough and FOUR has some of their best songs imo.

**frogaranaman** (8.438): I should start a grunge blog again

**timothy444** (8.375): Continuing to show growth in their music, One Direction's fourth album appropriately named FOUR moves away from their more bubblegum boy group pop roots into something that has many 80s synthpop influences. It's here where the album as a whole feels so much more mature in such a way that it highlights just how far they've come musically. Unironically, this is One Direction's best album in their discography

**akanewasright** (8.269): I‚Äôm honestly surprised by how much I liked this album, but it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ really lovely and well made

**Bordersz** (7.587): Their BEST album before it turned to 4 white men yelling. Zayn‚Äôs vocals elevated their songs a lot esp. his gorgeous high range. Also this is their 1st album where I mixed up vocals, Zayn/Liam/Harry sound alike on some notes/singing styles.

**plastichaxan** (7.519): now this really took me by surprise, I knew this would be the album I would like most but I didn‚Äôt expect to have this average on it, that being said I‚Äôm kinda glad my fear that it would be too late for me to get into them but it really wasn‚Äôt, I may not come back a lot to the album after this, but I‚Äôll definitely enjoy when I do and be more open minded to them

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.469): way more depressing than I thought it would be? like from a quality perspective it‚Äôs probably the best of the three but it was so heavy to listen to that I don‚Äôt see myself revisiting it too much

**jasannn** (7.281): Their tour for this album was actually my first concert ever and I wasn‚Äôt even a big fan. My cousin had a spare ticket after her friends bailed on her so she invited me. I don‚Äôt remember most of it but it was a really fun time and I lowkey became a directioner for a while. Onto the album itself, this was great evolution of their sound with the addition of more guitars and more mature melodies.

**Novuspyra** (7.250): FOUR is One Direction's best album, and Up All Night is second. I said what I said.

**Shelly\_AO29** (7.125): By far my favourite 1D album. FOUR took their music in a much more mature direction (heh!), and showed immense artistic growth from their previous projects, as well as showcasing the boys‚Äô budding songwriting talent. The filler tracks (looking at you, Spaces) bog it down somewhat, however some of the best songs of their career are on this album.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (7.125): this is no doubt 1D‚Äôs best album but tbh i think rating Take Me Home would‚Äôve been fairer to the other two albums lol they‚Äôre gonna get slaughtered in this rate

=====

2014BoyBands: **darjeelingdarkroast** (6.906): they had the best budget and vision out of all these lads in the rate and it shows. As a Mixer, I can see why I‚Äôm into 1D (a sad comparison tho, see Shout Out To My Ex lol) and I kinda get that the two groups highkey serving in the pop lane in the 2010s

**welcome2thejam** (6.813): Understandably, the production and writing on this runs laps around the competition. Despite a few stumbles holding it back, this is the one truly quality album in this rate. And no, I am NOT saying that because my mom sold my rate scores to One Direction.

**PretentiousPegasus** (6.813): I was obsessed with 1D in 2011-13 but by 2014 I'd kinda got bored of them so probably paid the least attention to FOUR out of these 3 albums. Although I can acknowledge Four is their best quality album, it has like zero nostalgia for me which is why I'll always say Take Me Home is superior.

**roboticpandora** (6.750): Feel like this title was some unfortunate foreshadowing lol. This album lives and dies on the quality of its references. There's some heavy influence from Journey, Blur, and the Kooks in particular, with little sprinklings of Bruce Springsteen for flavor. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's a good sound to emulate when you're trying to transition from a boy band into a man band.

**poemforsmallthings** (6.744): Take Me Home is their best album omg who said that

**Alumineous** (6.625): A song is either decent or so boring or poorly executed it drags down the rest of the album. Backing band is incredible. Now, the vocalists‚Ä¶ First, Liam has never sounded blander in this album. No wonder his solo career flopped. But Niall. He is my BOO. He impressed me, and Louis finally decided to step up in the group assignment. Harry just did his thing, never misses. Zayn was professional, he is definitely spicing up the songs with that falsetto. Taking a girl's innocence‚Ä¶ This album has a lot more sexual euphemisms than I expected. The boys are GROWN.

**wannabemusiccritic** (6.219): I used to love this album when I was like 13 but now that I‚Äôm older and listening to it again I‚Äôm wondering why I liked it so much lol. On the contrary, there‚Äôs a few really good songs, and this album is definitely the best of the three.

**bulforster** (5.550): it's v funny to me that their album "four" is the last album they made with five members

**apatel27** (5.500): They were all in on the parasocial relationship part for this album huh. All these songs bit something off other big songs but they get credit for the rock vibes

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.438): Wow this album was a snoozefest. I was at least expecting it to be more obnoxious‚Ä¶ but honestly I was surprised by how lowkey it was? At this point in time 1D was an institution and yet I think they were pretty easily outclassed by the newcomers here.

**pig-serpent** (5.406): I never really liked 1D at the time owing to what I considered predatory marketing and their large number of suspiciously similar songs, but I never hated them because they were at least fun most of the time.  This album had no rip offs but also most of the songs were overly sappy ballads that were completely draining to sit through.

**fadedblue09** (5.250): Despite giving them my 11, this album felt really underwhelming to me. Not super awful but there was too much midtempo filler that felt more suitable for solo artists than a vocal boygroup, (Night Changes gets it right, however). Also Zayn and Harry really upstage the lesser three here, for better or for worse.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.031): there's some alright tracks on here, but most of this album is just a boring, generic slog. and yet, it's still much better than the other two atrocities in this rate

**thedoctordances1940** (4.569): üòÇüòÇüòÇwhen the album title is also its scoreüòÇüòÇüòÇ

**Stryxen** (4.169): uh

**IIIHenryIII** (3.563): the best thing that happened to them was breaking up. This album is insufferable. They have some good songs, but none of them belong here.

IIIHenryIII: I still don't get these results, but it's ok. It's not the first time that popheads display their awful taste in music. I had a lot of fun though and am very glad I decided to give this rate a chance. I ended up discovering one of the best songs ever: Can We Dance. Not kidding, I've been addicted to that song ever since I heard it for the first time.

Thank you hosts! I didn't have time to follow the live reveal to show my support but I leave here my appreciation!

GamblesWithDesire: Night Changes winning is going to haunt my dreams. Fantastic rate, fantastic hosts, tasteless results.

Anyway, now rooting for a rate that includes Niall's Heartbreak Weather, one of the most underappreciated recent pop albums. Give Sma11 Talk her crown.

Edited to add that this rate result might have hurt me, but nobody has hurt me more than British-Irish boy band One Direction, who owe me for the pain and suffering. I have not known peace since they were formed.

2014BoyBands: Thank you to everyone that did the rate and followed the reveal both of queup and the thread. This rate was straight up my passion project, it included two albums that were fundamental for me in my teenage years and a third project that ~~partially~~ sound tracked multiple of my road trips with my family. I'm so glad you decided to give them a chonce and in the participated the rate<3

TiltControls: I'm so glad this rate got picked. Sure it had a low average, but I don't think that equates to how much fun it was to do (even with the Vamps there). Also Ricki slayed hosting as usual! idk where you even find some of the shitposts you use

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates are up! 

##**Songs**

* Congrats to Night Changes for giving 1D the rate win!! [I really wasn't kidding with my comment](https://i.imgur.com/p9jklkD.png). **Night Changes** places in a 3 way tie for **210th** highest average rating across all songs. It's got the same score as R√≥is√≠n Murphy - Jealousy and Marvin Gaye's Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler). For nearby songs it's lower than Queen's Somebody to Love by 0.004 points and higher than Taylor Swift's Enchanted by 0.001 point

* Also super glad that **No Control** managed to pull off a 9+ rating too! It places **264th** across all songs. It's 0.001 point lower than a trio of Panic! At the Disco's I Write Sins Not Tragedies, Kanye West's Stronger, and Ariana Grande and The Weeknd's Love Me Harder. It is also 0.001 point ahead of 2020 EP Rate's Damn Daniel by Bree Runway (feat. Yung Baby Tate).

* On the other side of the board - The Vamps' **Girls On TV** becomes the sub's **22nd lowest rated song** ever. It scored slightly higher than Tyga's Rack City and slightly lower than MAGIC!'s RUDE.

* **500 Years Of Winter - Pizza Song** takes the place as the **most controversial bonus rate song** we've rated, and would be 7th if included alongside all the main rate songs (it'd be right ahead of Dopesmoker). Pretty impressive considering we couldn't use 11s or 0s! [Here's the controversy list for just bonus songs](https://i.imgur.com/bNoR2dP.png)

##**Artists**

Let's start with the raw placements (out of 297 artists)


* 162nd: Sky Ferreira (+0.004 points)
* **163rd: One Direction** (Previously 158th)
* 164th: Young Thug (-0.002 points)

-

* 252nd: Rebecca Black (+0.002 points)
* **253rd: 5 Seconds of Summer** (New)
* 254th: Linkin Park (+0.002 points

-

* 293rd: Wiz Khalifa (+0.025 points)
* **294th: The Vamps** (New)
* 295th: LMFAO (-0.052 points)

-

So yeah. Not the best rate for The Vamps

* The Vamps are now the **4th worst rated artist** across all rates

* They are the lowest rated artist that we've done rate around (previously this was Kiiara in 292nd if counting EPs or Justin Bieber in 291st if only counting albums)

* Though they managed to avoid breaking the record everyone thought they would, they didn't escape the **3 album earliest exits** board. They tie for 3rd along Charli XCX (for True Romance) by both going out in 9th. D'Angelo and Kylie still have the record locked down for leaving right at the start of the top 10.


##**Albums**

[...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrWdyWCYlUo)

Anyways I need to figure out exactly how to calculate The Vamps' mess of an album tracklist on streaming so for now this is just based on what's in the main rate.

* **Meet The Vamps** is the **lowest rated album we've ever rated** actually it's the **lowest project we've ever rated** I don't even have to exclude the flop EPs like I usually do. They fell short of Kiiara' EP by 0.173 points and the next lowest album (Miley Cyrus - Bangerz) by nearly half a point! (0.499 points)

 * **5 Seconds of Summer** just barely misses the lowest average leaderboard as they've got the 27th lowest rated album (need to be bottom 25)

* **FOUR** takes the new record for **highest percentage of 11s given to in a rate!!** 65.8% of the participants gave their 11 to One Direction in the rate. Previously the record was held by Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill with 64.3%

* For every action there is an equal and opposite rateaction. **Meet The Vamps** lands on the board for **lowest percentage of 11s given to in a rate**. They end up with the 4th lowest percentage with a measly 3.8% (they got 3 11s all rate). Lower than them are Views, All Your Faults Pts. 1 & 2, and (sorry Darj) There's A Riot Goin' On

* **The Vamps** continue their 'winning' streak and also place on the **highest percentage of 0s given in a rate** in 6th place with 35.4% of participants giving them a 0. This places them snugly between Views/Future Nostalgia (4th) and 1989 [Rerate] (7th) on this leaderboard

* Back to the good news - **FOUR** lands in a tie for 8th for **highest 11 split in an album** with 87.5%. Only Change Your Ticket and Illusions didn't pick one up. The other album in the number 8 spot is Lady Gaga's ARTPOP which missed 11s for Dope & Mary Jane Holland

##**Rates**
Well as Ricki pointed out this is the 135th highest average across all rates! If you want a more understandable comparison, this is the **5th lowest average rate** ever. Across album rates it's second last - only ahead of Bangerz vs. Revival vs. Confident
