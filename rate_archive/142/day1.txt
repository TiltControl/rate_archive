Y/N's Favorite 2014 Boy Bands Reveal, Day 1: In loving memory of Zayn Malik
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/tnxq0m/yns_favorite_2014_boy_bands_reveal_day_1_in/

Hello popheads!

In honor of the [7th anniversary of the worst tragedy mankind has gone through in recent memory](https://i.imgur.com/yyieqf1.jpg), today we'll start revealing the songs placing **#45** to **#31**. We'll also reveal some of the bonus songs depending on their average, as if they were in the main rate. 

**Important information.** The reveal will be taking place in [**queup.net**](https://www.queup.net/join/ripplugdj), because if there's one thing I like my reveals to be in guinea pigs to test new platforms. If that fails, the new platform will be revealed shortly after (likely being beatsense).



Make sure to keep this thread open, as I will be unveiling your comments and scores for each of the songs as they go out, feautring all scores, comments, rank graphs and banners.

And we start with a big one.

This was consistently first out pretty much the entire time, and it's easy to see why. The song is simply a little... annoying, the melody is repetitive to the point of exhaustion, the lyrics are confusing (What does "Having all the girls on TV" even mean?) and Bradley's voice is perhaps the most irrating here than in any other song, these issues accompanied by this little ukelele driven, watered-down ska inspired beat just create for an unpleasant experience for most listeners.


And here I am, listing all of the song's issues, fully understanding why people came in droves to bash it, and still I can't help but to feel like this got a lot worse than it deserved.  I'm not going to go down fighting for this song (God knows there are worse robberies coming soon), but I do want to argue that perhaps this is suffering because of the recording we rated.

I was fully on the Girls On TV hate train when the rate began, in fact, I was sure it was certainely going to be my 0, but as I was getting the playlist ready and stumbled on the live performances and saw Bradley jumping around on stage, like the humanification of a squirrel he seems to be,  the aspects of the song stopped being obnoxious and started being more endearing to me, the melody got stuck in my head and I couldn't help but giggle at the name-drops that  out of nowhere and the fact that the narration device used is the singer reading a diary entry out loud. This is a very The Vamps song, youthful, fun, cheesy, and it 100% depends on delivery, which I fear in the studio version falls flat, causing most people that participated to end up despising it.

# Comments about Beyonce and Rihanna

**Roxieloxie** (10): BEYONCE???? I YELLED so hard when I heard that I had to go restart the song. I cant believe the two most camp songs on this album are back to back. Much like Oh Cecilia, this is terrible but the sheer joy it has brought me has made me loop it since this rate has gotten picked, im obsessed with how this is litterally a y/n fic

**Verdantshade** (10): the 'dear diary' always makes me cringe but once I make it past that you can bet I'm yelling SHE GOT LEGS LIKE BEYONCE

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (7.2): they’re comparing this girl to Rihanna and Beyoncé as if we didn’t know damn well she’s a white girl named Maddie

**emayzee** (6.6): those beyonce and rihanna references gave me whiplash

**wavingwolves** (6.1): why did they rhyme beyoncé with vietnam???

**1998tweety** (6): Something about the Rihanna/camera rhyme feels off..

**IIIHenryIII** (6): boom boom, she walks like Rihanna

**hhiggy** (5): why does he say rihanna like that

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (5): is beyonce known for her legs?

**teenwitches** (4): (tiffany pollard voice) BEYONCE?!

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Lmaoooo I did not expect him to go straight to Beyonce and Rihanna. Based on that information alone I think this girl is waaaay out of your leagues gentlemen. And I doubt the banjo is gonna win her over

**jackisboredtoday** (3.3): this is just mixing “Walks Like Rihanna” with “Brave Honest Beautiful” but somehow far worse than both of them

**emmaelf** (2): a list of musicians far more talented than the vamps appears in this. entirely to their detriment.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): is rihanna known for her eye?

**2dina3dworld** (1): now what did Rihanna and Beyoncé do to be brought into this

**PretentiousPegasus** (1): This song is so annoying I hate the way Brad pronounces Beyonce, Rihanna, Camera, Mysterious and Serious. If I had another 0 it would belong to girls on tv

**apatel27** (1): Why is he singing with a slight patois accent

**hikk** (0): can beyonce and rihanna sue?

**thedoctordances1940** (0): she may have legs like beyoncé but you sound like the guy she gave a restraining order 🧛

**timothy444** (0): this is "Walks Like Rihanna" by The Wanted but somehow even worse that even Jason Derulo himself wouldn't touch. Also because I'm banking on this being in last place I just want to rant about the latter half of *Meet the Vamps* because holy crap it's soooooooooo boring and they don't even deserve the comments I usually put in every song whenever I participate in a rate. Maroon 5 wasn't even this bad bak in 2014 and despite this being a debut, it shouldn't this bland considering you had a blueprint in the form of *Up All Night* back in 2011. At least that album had enjoyable filler, but Meet the Vamps just proves to be bad. Just bad.


# Comments that don't mention Beyonce or Rihanna

**runaway3212** (10): idk what's worse, his faux raggae accent or me yassing

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): The word “camp” is thrown around a lot these days…

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Okay so when this started I was sure I was gonna hate it but the longer it went on the more I was charmed by it, their age shows here but in a sweet way.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.5): we should be rating this with that Rita Ora song vs Girls the TV show for endless discourse

**starlitsuns** (5.5): the ukelele sounding sample or whatever is a decent touch but Duran Duran outsold the girls on film concept by a country mile

**plastichaxan** (5): this is not worse than the cecilia song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4.5): it’s reminding me of that one Fifth Harmony song featuring Meghan Trainor and that made me laugh. anyways, who remembers Lyte Funky Ones?

**seanderlust** (4.5): now....what is this hey soul sister instrumental. these boys are too young to be speaking like a man in his 50s who's very supportive of his wife

**throwaway-7650** (4.5): this song makes me laugh just as much as [ZE:A - mazeltov](https://open.spotify.com/track/1J7MT5Z2dYXhlI1dTsydg0?si=325e0502034f4987) (I gave that the same score before [5] for reference)

**akanewasright** (4): British people with this accent should not be allowed to say the word “party”

**followingfreeways** (4): it's a no from me

**GamblesWithDesire** (4): Hard no for me.

**twat\_brained** (4): Duran Duran deserves better

**welcome2thejam** (4): Third of the way through the album and I'm now officially worried that this will be mostly an album of bleh pop rock that gives me nothing

**roboticpandora** (3.5): Why are they saying “camera” like Jenna from 30 Rock??

**bigbigbee** (3): This is objectively hilarious but my face puckers up involuntarily when I hear it, so, three.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): i'm bored

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (2.5): ???????

**poemforsmallthings** (2.4): ok

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): it got worse the longer it went on omfg

**pig-serpent** (1.5): Oh, this sounds like fun, I want to try.  She drives cars like she's Charli!  Ran away from me like Carly!

**bulforster** (1): Now who had the thought "what if Peter Andre - Mysterious Girl but more sanitised?"

**letsallpoo** (1): what the fuck

**RandomHypnotica** (1): no

**Shelly\_AO29** (1): The score is this low purely because of that awful Caribbean island accent impersonation. Yuck.

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): is it flattering to be flirted with like this?

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1): nah wtf this song is just bad

**babadork** (0): Are they trying to do a Jamaican accent? Why do they sound so weird?

**bluetriangles04** (0): idk what to say about this other than I hate this so much pls... the lyrics are just painful imo, the pop culture references are tacky and for a billion other reasons... this is my 0

**CarlieScion** (0): kill me now

**ignitethephoenix** (0): choices were certainly made here

**jasannn** (0): Happy Women’s History Month I guess.

**Stryxen** (0): it got WORSE??? Than the JIG????

**TiltControls** (0): Okay this is actually one of the worst things I've ever heard

**TragicKingdom1** (0): not sure if this or 5SOS's 18 is more cringe but this one also sounds like shit. pick a struggle!!

**waluigiest** (0): this nasty ass song over a YouTube vlogger royalty free beat.. no thanks

**you2009** (0): they got tvs in england?

Yeah..... fuck this song. Even as someone that has gotten used and over the stuff about The Vamps most people can't stand, even this was too much for me. Brad's voice sounds miserable here and the whole thing just comes off a whiney, even with that tho, it has its defenders! Most notably the first 11 out of the rate, given by Ghost\_Quartet, so at the very least they're guaranteed to miss the "No 11s" list!

---

# We love the earth, it is our planet<3

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): I had to immediately replay this after listening to it and I’ve revisited it quite a bit since, it really connects with me on an emotional level like the best pop music is supposed to. It’s one of the most mature tracks on this album but it still has that twinkle of innocence to it that heightens the tragedy of the story it’s telling.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): maybe it's just because it's generic sweet ballad rather than generic annoying upbeat music, but this is beautiful

**Bordersz** (8.5): Gorgeous vocals. Bradley was singing like rent was due 2 yesterday.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (7.8): boring af

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): 1D outsold, their another world is underrated af, stream it

**wavingwolves** (7.3): the camp's vocalist sounds exactly how he looks! crazy! impressive!

**fadedblue09** (7): The intro was rough but surprisingly cute

**ignitethephoenix** (6.9): I am picturing this song as their one less lonely girl moment

**1998tweety** (6.5): Poor man's The One That Got Away

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): Those are some nice millennial whoops.

#doesn't recycle, leaves the tap open when brushing their teeth, supports nft's

**followingfreeways** (6): yawn. alexa play Another World by One Direction

**GamblesWithDesire** (6): It was at this point that I realized that most of this album feels like one song with different filters on it.

**moonagenightmares** (5.7): stream another world by nct

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): it was great up until the chorus! once again 1d’s another world outsold

**hhiggy** (5): they really just can't sell the slower songs the way that 1d and 5sos did

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i don't have balladphobia i wear

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): This is too much cheese for me to take seriously

**bulforster** (4.7): balladphobia will deservedly tank this one but while listening i was fondly reminded of what a slay that gay rights ballad jolin had in eapr was

**seanderlust** (4.5): wh-who is they? who threw you to the wolves? i'm sorry i hate his voice on this one

**apatel27** (4): The Script cosplay

**poemforsmallthings** (4): done better by One Direction in 2011

**Roxieloxie** (4): Alright I think i've figured it out, the vamps cant do ballads, and thats okay! Its their first album, but as a boyband you need that one solid ballad that can really hook the listeners in to sing out, and they just /dont/ have that.

**runaway3212** (4): this is like a chipmunks ballad

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (4): MOVE ON!

**thedoctordances1940** (3.7): i'm sorry but what is this 🧛

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3.5): I know it’s weird to say in this whole rate but this is very cheesy

**Alumineous** (3): Oh no, not another song that has the same plot as another song on this rate.

**emmaelf** (3): singing in a whine doesn't make it emotional, it makes it disgusting to listen to.

**roboticpandora** (3): Something about the percussion sounds really tinny and thin to me, and some of the production choices are just bizarre.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (2.5): i hate how whiny he sounds

**CarlieScion** (2): this is the most uneven album of all time

**pig-serpent** (2): Does this song have a reason to exist?  No, didn't think so.

**welcome2thejam** (2): Oh brother, this is corny

**akanewasright** (1): oh my god he sounds like he’s in pain, like I’m gonna find out first verse guy recorded these vocals with a knife in him

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): the amount of low scores I've given out in this rate make me fear that my ballot will be rejected

**cremeebrulee** (1): oh some of these vocals are rough

**IIIHenryIII** (1): how on Earth did this shit end up on this album?

**Saison\_Marguerite** (1): go boys give us nothing

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): its like hearing paint dry

**TiltControls** (1): Oh wow and I thought the last song's vocals were rough

**2dina3dworld** (0): they wish they could be SOPHIE

**celladonn** (0): The vocals are sounding especially whiny here, and the mixing feels really off. The mixing might be intentional, to try and sound spacey or something, but it just sounds really bad. Awful song.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): the vocals in the opening of this song made me legitimately laugh out loud

**Shelly\_AO29** (0): This song gets the 0. Every element of the production sounds awful (why does it sound like he's singing in a bathroom?). It's also super dated and generic. So bad.

**twat\_brained** (0): I'm not taking any excuses One Direction had the courtesy to keep their Another World off the main tracklist and it still slaps I want to meet another band now

I doubt the last thing anyone wanted after listening to their debut was to get told by The Vamps to smile, perhaps they'd smile more if you gave them reasons to!

This is far from their worst, but also compared to the singles, it just fades into the background and gets forgotten pretty easily, plus a good amount pointed out how for almost all women being told to smile will just cause a negative reaction in them.

This also will sadly join the list of songs that didn't receive a single 10, tough crowd i guess.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8): as our feminist queen Simone Biles said: “smiling doesn’t win you gold medals”

**TiltControls** (8): Good ending for the album, especially after some of the other songs in the back half

**emmaelf** (7): thank goodness the album ends on a tolerable note

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): wait this is kinda boppy

**welcome2thejam** (7): :D No

**wavingwolves** (6.9): this is so jonas brothers on the soundtrack of their tv show JONAS (complimentary)


#:(
**GamblesWithDesire** (6): Not super into this one unfortunately.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I’ve heard a lot of songs called “Smile” at this point and this is not at the front of the pack

**ImADudeDuh** (6): omfg not the vamps in their smile era 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😆😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

**PretentiousPegasus** (6): Avril outsold

**roboticpandora** (6): I might have given this song a higher score if it were placed earlier on the album, but at this point I was getting pretty tired of all of those song-ending singalongs.

**starlitsuns** (6): I finally finished this album, the evil has been defeated (until the rate reveal happens)

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): You can stop now

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.5): i’m giving a neutral emote kinda smile rn

**1998tweety** (5): Something about the line "Smile for me girl", feels off...

**fadedblue09** (5): passable but the vocals get really annoying

**Roxieloxie** (5): 4

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): this is kind of empty(??) sounding

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (5): how many people were scared

**thedoctordances1940** (4.7): 🧛

**Bordersz** (4.5): Did not like the song at all, it was a bit cheesy.

**akanewasright** (4): well! At least the album’s over!

**CarlieScion** (4): who is this man they keep letting sing lead vocals and why can he not sing. Instrumental goeth awf tho

**IIIHenryIII** (4): Katy outsold, and that is a horrible song

**martian\_pet** (4): ummm asking a girl to Smile is not very is not very girlboss of them, it's giving gaslight, gatekeep, mansplain.

**pig-serpent** (4): Yeah this is tolerable I guess.

**seanderlust** (4): besides being about a guy telling a girl she should smile more, i think the most interesting things that are happening are in the instrumentals and are so muted that you have to focus to hear them

**twat\_brained** (4): "smile, it looks good on you!😉" I'm smiling because I don't have to listen to this album ever again

**Alumineous** (3): The closer in an album is like prime real estate, and they used it to talk about… smiling.

**cremeebrulee** (3): https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/828101102041432104.webp?size=240&quality=lossless

**ignitethephoenix** (3): not men telling a woman to smile smh such a dated concept!

**jasannn** (3): I’m only smiling because the album is finally over.

**Shelly\_AO29** (3): Meh in every sense of the word.

**throwaway-7650** (3): smile's not *that* bad (it's no she was the one) but it's still pretty bad

**apatel27** (2): 🙂🔫📷

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): No.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (2): I’m not offended that men are telling me to smile, just bored

**runaway3212** (1): the dentist be like

**bulforster** (0): That group chant telling y/n to smile is honestly a bit unsettling

**skargardin** (0): I'm sorry but this was a painful listen

She was the one? More like,,, she was the 4.965! 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 \*ba dmm tssss*


I think The Vamps just aren't a band made for ballads, which was a problem for them, because as much as they don't want to admit it, they got marketed as a boy band, and boy bands NEED ballads, how else will you make teenage girls fall in love with you and promise to spend their parent's savings on merch?!

This is just as whiny and boring as the previous ballads, and on top of that the lyrics are a bunch of nothing, why did they have Brad singing about the one that got away? He wasn't even 18! Give him a tambourine again or something, their music is much better when they're having unsupervised, white fun.

---

#she was the YASS


**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8.5): it’s giving straight men country songs

**wavingwolves** (8.1): this is sapphic coded too... we truly need to thank boy bands for their service to the sapphic community, it's a lot! truly allies!

**fadedblue09** (8): Oh this was decent

**Bordersz** (7.5): They really shine on these ballads.

**emayzee** (7.2): i've spent the entirety of my listening to this just singing the jonas brothers and miley cyrus's "before the storm" in my head over the chorus

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): Back to a slightly higher note! We've got a chorus that's a little bit repetitive, but there's more of a melody on this one.

**Verdantshade** (7): it's not a bad song but brad just sounds SO whiny in the chorus

**celladonn** (6.5): This was kind of rescued by the bridge

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): their enunciation is strange on this song in the chorus, it’s kind of distracting (along with some vocal choices here that don’t get disguised as nicely here)

**roboticpandora** (6.5): More substantial than some of the other tracks, but I want to take a red pen to the lyrics of the chorus.

**TiltControls** (6.5): It exists and is inoffensive which easily puts it in the top half for this album

**cremeebrulee** (6): run katy her check [2]

**frogaranaman** (6): somehow this song is still gay

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it’s decent

**runaway3212** (6): these two tracks blend together for me

**welcome2thejam** (6): Waaay better than the Katy Perry One That Got Away, I'll give it that

#she was the NAUR

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): i mean its a ballad…. that’s all there really is to say about it

**apatel27** (5): Why are they singing about the one that got away at 18

**emmaelf** (5): look the longer the album goes on, the worse his voice sounds, and this is just highlighting that.

**Roxieloxie** (5): 3

**skargardin** (5): These slower songs are just not convincing at all

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): The way he sings physically hurts me

**you2009** (5): decent composition

**seanderlust** (4.3): i really really don't like the vocals here and the instrumental is not enough to make up for them

**thedoctordances1940** (4.3): 😂😂😂when the ~~album~~ song title also contains its score😂😂😂 actually this one isn't even that bad🧛

**akanewasright** (4): for some reason I keep expecting the song to turn into Jump Then Fall, and I keep getting disappointed

**Shelly\_AO29** (4): Generic ballad. What this album has shown me is that ballads are not The Vamps strength at all.

**starlitsuns** (4): this instrumental sounds like every evangelical worship band song ever, Hillsong would be ashamed to hear a boy band use this instrumental

**Stryxen** (4): there is nothing good here, but there’s nothing bad really. Very much A Song - i was a bit bored i guess

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i think the vocals are missing for this to have the desired effect

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (4): the first three seconds of the song are the best part of it

**IIIHenryIII** (3.5): ew

**bulforster** (3.3): this whiny ass chorus is not it

**Alumineous** (3): Proof that legs like Beyonce and eyes like Rihanna does not lead to a loving relationship.

**CarlieScion** (3): whiny vocals but in a non-sexy way

**pig-serpent** (2.5): This album has a lot more terrible ballads on it than I remember.  That's probably because I never listened past Girls on TV.

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): okay the vocals on this are REALLY bad

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (1): Time to listen to Katy to cleanse my ears.

**throwaway-7650** (1): she surely was the ***1***, he sounds worse than shawn

**twat\_brained** (1): this song is a one because it sounds like the rough draft of When You Look Me In The Eyes and Nick Jonas wrote that song when he was like 10 do you know how much of a hack you have to be to achieve that

**Saison\_Marguerite** (0): she was the zero

You guys are on The Vamps' necks, damn.


This is pretty middle of the road, I guess, which gets reflected on their average (this is also the first song to break the 5 range in averages, we go up!). This is the type of cutesy filler that you would find in 1D's first albums, nice enough for you to leave it as it played in the car, but nowhere near good enough for a label to even consider releasing it as a single. I feel like maybe the reception to this would be more positive had it been on an album that got received better overall,,,,,, but I guess we'll never know if that's true.

---

#moved their way

**Verdantshade** (10): for a song written in like 2010 by a kid this has aged ridiculously well, it's without a doubt a mid album highlight

**celladonn** (9): This is a pretty delightful little track

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Rapidly improves as it continues

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): Love the strings. Cute song.

**welcome2thejam** (7): The Jason Mraz ass intro was not a promising start

**apatel27** (6.5): Best song on the album which is saying something

**emmaelf** (6.5): genuinely thought we were about to burst into some mcfly. it was a small let down.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): do-do-dodo

**roboticpandora** (6): A decent tune with too many doo-doo-dos. Also I don’t really get what the strings are doing there.

**Roxieloxie** (6): my another wold comment 2

**runaway3212** (6): these two tracks blend together for me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): v indie~~~ inspired

#🧍‍♂️

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): why did I give this song a second chance and dislike it more 💀

**bulforster** (5.4): I think I would actually really like this one if a different voice was singing it

**frogaranaman** (5): this entire album has sounded "trying to mimic early Bieber" esque but especially this song

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): This song came and went without leaving any sort of mark behind.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): this is like lovebug by the Jonas Brothers and love is easy by McFly had an ugly baby

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): how many yg entertainment chant-and-clap breakdowns are they gonna do on this album

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): nobody moved

**wavingwolves** (4.8): certainly a song that exists... it actually reminds me of something from one direction's take me home album but idk what

**Alumineous** (4): All I know is that it is one of many hookup songs on this rate.

**throwaway-7650** (4): CIX outsold (theirs is called move my body but we... move.)

**poemforsmallthings** (3.6): I was typing "it's a bit boring" right before the prechorus then backtracked because I thought the chorus was gonna save it but it's just as bad 🙏

**akanewasright** (3.5): this is boring but lemme clown that he stretched “refreshment” to like six syllables. Early Halsey would be impressed

**pig-serpent** (3): *Executive voice* So I know you want to be a punk rock band, but have you considered ripping off Jason Maraz instead?

**Stryxen** (3): jason mraz meets scouting for girls in the worst way possible

**TiltControls** (3): The repeating syllables in the chorus is bothering me to no end

**twat\_brained** (3): your way does not have Luke Hemmings or Niall Horan I think the fuck not

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Oh no not the doo-doo-doos

**waluigiest** (3): god this chorus makes mad

**thedoctordances1940** (2.6): the instrumental god why 🧛

**2dina3dworld** (2.5): Frank Sinatra outsold

**jasannn** (2): not the do do do do’s

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (1): No.

**hikk** (1): PUT AWAY THE UKELELE

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (1): this’d be a disney kids song about not wanting to change out of your pajamas

You know there are other 2 groups in this rate that you can also eliminate, right?

Who am I kidding, this was destined to do awfully regardless of anything, matter fact, I'm shocked it wasn't out right after Girls On TV. This had the girlies angry on the #rates channel on Discord, and I get why, the use of interpolation from a well respected song or group in a pretty mid song is always going to make some people mad >!just check Beg For You's jukebox score as proof!<, on top of that having r/popheads' enemy #7 Shawn Mendes (who isn't on any of the versions on streaming, not that it made much difference lol) was always going to hinder it.

I guess this is as good as it would ever do, even if I think that this is already tolerable enough that it should have done better.

Side note: Both times we've rated Shawn Mendes has been in a rate of mine, and both times I made the decision to include him. Both times the songs did miserably, and as part of the... 8 people that want to rate Shawn's debut, I don't think I'm making a good case for that to happen.

---

#It's giving cher

**Alumineous** (10): This is literally the only good song on this album, and they didn’t even write the hook. Sigh.

**hhiggy** (10): the why ey ey ey ey ey me part makes this a ten for me

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM9NVmEXBpw

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): Love the song. For some reason Shawn's version has been deleted from Spotify even though he's still credited though :(

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is the worst thing ive heard and I've been obsessed with this since the first day ricki pitched this rate to me and we went through the track listing. The faux patios they're trying to go for, the way shawn just absolutely slides on this song, like if you dont know he's on here he blends in with the rest of the band so much. Every time i hear this song I have to loop it at least 3 times on a private session it brings me so much joy I cant not give it a ten

**TiltControls** (10): This is one of the worst things I've ever heard

**runaway3212** (9): Shawn sounding undifferentiable from the vamps

**synchronisedchaos** (9): I DIED WHEN THIS VIDEO DROPPED

**Verdantshade** (9): haven't heard the shawn version but I can verify that my dad approved of the simon & garfunkel cover, and honestly the verses aren't too shabby either

**followingfreeways** (8): how can a song annoy me so much and be such a banger at the same time

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8): What could Cecilia have done to the white boy squad to have them heartbroken like that

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (8): i love how spotify says shawn is featured in this song but i don’t hear him at all

**1998tweety** (7.5): Sixteen-year-old me was obsessed with this but it's not nearly as good as I remember...oh well.

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I know this is a disgrace to the original but here’s the thing: the original is really good, so it’s hard for this off-brand cover to be bad

**celladonn** (7): The whole love thing, I clowned it

**ignitethephoenix** (7): can’t believe 1D tried to copy this with Olivia

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): Louie in We’re Back! A Dinosaur’s Story be like:

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): Modernizes the Cecilia sample from Simon and Garfunkel well.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): this really plagured aussie radio at one stage

**you2009** (7): didn't know shawn was on this either

**emayzee** (6.8): thinking about the days when shawn mendes was like the 5th most popular member of magcon

#https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-9282-png-1637262525.png?crop=1.00xw:0.883xh;0,0.0661xh&resize=480:

**poemforsmallthings** (6.8): Shawn sounds so bad here omg

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.5): the GALL to do this cover bumps the score for me honestly (it’s also my favorite S&G song)

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): can’t tell if it’s the same situation as the demi song or shawn just blends in with the other guys too well.

**timothy444** (6.5): I wrote down small notes on a notebook while listening to this album and all I wrote when I listened to this that it sounded white and I'm not going back to listen to this again to elaborate on that. Side-note: I find it hilarious how the shawn mendes version is so hard to find on Spotify

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): Points for being energetic, which usually helps with these bands, but the sample here just feels so awkward

**twat\_brained** (6.1): better this than Why Don't We's Smashing Pumpkins sample but that's really not saying much

**Bordersz** (6): where the hell was this version 10 years ago I didn’t know this existed

**GamblesWithDesire** (6): I wish it was fuller in terms of instruments? It feels oddly empty.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): this kinda sounds like something big by Shawn

**teenwitches** (6): simon and garfunkel don’t deserve this

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): IPR but make it Radio Disney friendly

**martian\_pet** (5.5): if i had a nickel for every song by a band named after a girl...

**wavingwolves** (5.2): this is so john green coded

**starlitsuns** (5): not to break popheadscirclejerk rules but instead subverting them: Shawn Mendes bland

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I am too much of a city boy to ever vibe with this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4.5): I don’t mind the melody to this at all but it feels too…loud.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): I can't tell Shawn apart from the other guy singing

**frogaranaman** (4): wasn't this magcon era Shawn

**welcome2thejam** (4): Oh Cecilia, what did they do to you

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (4): shawn mendes youth pastor

**bulforster** (3.8): If Demi wasn't also a feature on this album there's absolutely no way anyone would've noticed Shawn missing from this on the Spotify playlist.

**babadork** (3.5): The song makes more sense when Cecilia is also having sex with other people, but I guess that might be a little edgy for a boy band.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): um…the singles had me thinking this would be an actually good album but i guess not </3

**fadedblue09** (2): Back when I first saw this MV, I couldn't distinguish Shawn from the other guys (Is that racist? Idk)

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Cute usage of a sample, I love it when a song references the song it’s pulling from, but unfortunately I hate that song lol

**RandomHypnotica** (2): up until now I was thinking "why does everyone hate the vamps so aggressively???" but now I get it

**throwaway-7650** (2): shawn's vocals... oof

**hikk** (1): this is so annoying

**Stryxen** (1): i thought i didn’t mind shawn mendes but it was worse than i could have ever expected

**thedoctordances1940** (1): who the fuck let them cover simon & garfunkel 🧛

**waluigiest** (1): amazing how every part of this sounds terrible

**akanewasright** (0): …

**apatel27** (0): what how can you ruin a Simon & Garfunkel song this badly

**emmaelf** (0): i'm forcing art garfunkel and paul simon into a room together to demand WHY ON EARTH THEY LET THIS GET MADE. it's turned one of the best songs of the 20th century into a sample for atrocious sugar-pop with a full on terrible production, terrible, generic lyrics and less soul than the devil. you don't deserve cecilia, not even the original cheating girlfriend version if this is your best attempt at keeping a woman. this is one of the few songs my mum couldn't keep on without crying and that really is an achievement. she sat through screamo and circa 2008 nicki minaj but not this... i had to listen to the real thing on repeat for a bit before i could continue on with the rankings.

**pig-serpent** (0): He claims to be the joker, yet he's stranded on an island, not living in a soceity. Curious

**plastichaxan** (0): i can see why the gays hate her

**roboticpandora** (0): Ok look if you’re going to cover “Cecilia” you have to bring your best and this is no one’s best. The Train-ification of Paul Simon.

I wish I could back in time to find my reaction to when I first heard this song and got to the "reveal" of the chorus. I was gagged, gooped, genuinely surprised. I couldn't believe that I would get a straight forward sex song, barely any innuendo, just an invitation to get naked.

This is perhaps the unsexiest sex song I've ever heard and honestly I admire the nerve it must take to decide to add an ukulele to one. 

---

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): I enjoyed the white boy core (a 10 for the Vamps isn’t the same as a 10 for 1D and 5SOS)

**Verdantshade** (10): it's honestly shocking that a song this catchy didn't make the cut.. I do love the chorus a bit too much for my own good though

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): I'm giving this a 7 for the potential that it has because if these lyrics/melody weren't being pasted over a campfire instrumental, I think I would love this song. Alas, this song feels like such a missed opportunity because of it.

**wavingwolves** (6.2): WASHED PERFUME FADNIUS!!!!!!!!

**frogaranaman** (6): Perfume Genius??????????

**IIIHenryIII** (6): saying that the dress would look better on the floor sounds like a backhanded compliment

**PretentiousPegasus** (6): Forgettable. JLo outsold, Mr worldwide owns this song title

**throwaway-7650** (6): it bops a bit but let me go stream J.Lo and perfume genius

**CarlieScion** (5): jlo who

**emmaelf** (5): heard the uke and immediately dropped it like 2 whole points

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I feel like they just got kinda trapped in their sunny pop sound, this needed to be dirtier. Even Meghan Trainor has more heat than this

**plastichaxan** (5): did not outsell perfume genius or jennifer lopez unfortunately

**Shelly\_AO29** (5): Meh song.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (5): J-Lo outsold

**roboticpandora** (4.5): This is way too much ukulele for a song about fucking.

**apatel27** (4): Can't take a pick up line song seriously when the singer sounds 13

**bluetriangles04** (4): Past the awful cringe lyrics that I assume many fans of them were singing without understanding the meaning really (or understanding the meaning a little TOO well...) its a semi-passible song by them.

**TiltControls** (4): I wanted a Pitbull/J Lo cover

**welcome2thejam** (4): Twice now where they sing about more "mature" topics but musically they sound like they're absolutely not ready for either

**seanderlust** (3.9): we just heard lovestruck I don't know if now's the time to throw stones about getting too attached or whatever. overall a meh song about a pickup line that was cringey in the first place.

**fadedblue09** (3.5): had to double check their ages after realizing what this was

And The Vamps' streak has finally been broken.

I guess I'm fine with this cut. Even a 5SOS stan has to admit that not everything they released during their debut era was a hit, and well, I don't know if this was one. It's just a little generic and dull, and only gets hurt by the fact that this is sandwiched between two bangers in the tracklist. That said "Let's cease the day, let's run away, don't let the colors fade to gray" was my motto through all of 9th grade and likely kept me alive through the mess I was during my high school days.

---

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): that whole “we’ll never be as young as we are todya” while I’m not living my dream life it’s actually making me feel like shit tbh

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i'm nostalgic i'm crying

**twat\_brained** (7.3): in the nicest way possible this sounds like an Avril Lavigne self-titled leftover

**1998tweety** (7): she's alright

**timothy444** (7): Sounds like something you'd probably hear from the Midnight Memories album by 1D

**Verdantshade** (7): kinda boring tbh like one of those forgettable green day songs

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (7): the benjamin button erasure

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): yep, that's how time works

**throwaway-7650** (6.6): it's giving fight song/[insert other generic "inspirational" song]

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): kind of boring but not bad

**moonagenightmares** (6.5): this made me depressed wtf

**emmaelf** (6): forgettable but there's worse crimes

**hhiggy** (6): there's just a few too many songs on here that are like we're young and free and crazy and rebellious

**TiltControls** (6): yeah that's how time works

**welcome2thejam** (6): Lyrics about being young and wanting to leave this town? Now you guys are true pop punkers.

**wavingwolves** (5.8): young people being obsessed with their youthfulness yadda yadda

**roboticpandora** (5.5): It is true that we will never be as young as we are now I guess??

**bulforster** (5.1): a bit bland and starts super boring but picks up by the end and you can at least see the vision they had for the closer, even if it did come out sounding a bit like off brand imagine dragons

**apatel27** (5): Stadium song [derogatory]

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): I always forget that this song exists and listening to it again, there's a reason for it.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): the definition of album filler but i still don't dislike it

**PretentiousPegasus** (5): Boring

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (5): snooze

**fadedblue09** (4): the shouty chorus is really annoying

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Slow, boring, devoid of meaning

**you2009** (4): that ukulele girl

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Let’s here it for grasping the basic concept of time!

**celladonn** (3): *bangs gavel* BORING!

**frogaranaman** (3): god they can sound like jackasses in some of these songs lol

**IIIHenryIII** (3): their FOUR era

**pig-serpent** (3): I've listened to enough mid 2000s pop rock ballads to have higher standards than this.

**Shelly\_AO29** (3): I can see why this was left off the standard edition of this album. Very trite.

**Stryxen** (1): sick, twisted, horrifying, contagious, downright scary

STOP, HE'S ALREADY DEAD!!!

I dragged this song as I wrote my comment, and started liking it a lot more. Sometimes you get it too late, I guess.

Uhm,,, I guess I have no justification for my feelings. Maybe it sounds so much like We Are Young that I started liking this too idk.

---

**throwaway-7650** (10): at times this reminds me of rihanna - firebomb (stream rated R)

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I like the lyrics and composition of this one, if they’d just found a way to ratchet up the intensity of the final chorus a bit it would be one of the best songs in the rate

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): I'm pretty sure that this is the like, big crescendo song for a Disney Original Movie that never got made and I love that energy.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): if 1D did this it would be a classic deep cut from them

**IIIHenryIII** (8): it's kinda catchy, what can I do?

**poemforsmallthings** (7.8): this is nice

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**RandomHypnotica** (7): it's diet grenade but I gotta really praise whatever good comes out of the dry dry rock that is Meet The Vamps

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): the chorus and bridge are v enjoyable

**TiltControls** (7): I have nothing to say about this song, which given the rest of my comments for this album is probably a point in its favour

**bigbigbee** (6.5): you wish you were Tonight by fun, you wish you were Tonight by fun so bad

**roboticpandora** (6.5): The best use of the ho-hey style chorus on the album.

**wavingwolves** (6.1): did you say CRASH? just like the fifth studio album by English singer-songwriter Charli XCX, released on 18 March 2022. It is her last album to be released under her current record contract with Atlantic Records. Charli announced the album title, release date, and artwork on 4 November 2021. Her website was also updated with information about the album's 2022 tour. The album was preceded by the four singles "Good Ones", "New Shapes" featuring Christine and the Queens and Caroline Polachek, "Beg for You" featuring Rina Sawayama, "Baby" and two promotional singles, "Every Rule" and "Used to Know Me". The sound consists of 1980s, 1990s and 2000s-inspired synth-pop, dance-pop and

**akanewasright** (6): the bridge is like the only part of the song with much flavor at all

**emmaelf** (6): oooooooh i'd rather listen to an actual folk band rather than this manufactured effort

**runaway3212** (6): boring not bad

**seanderlust** (6): wow i love We Are Young

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Please stop with the annoying mouth sounds…. I’m begging….

**welcome2thejam** (6): Picked up in the second half

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (6): she doesn’t look that interested my dude

**twat\_brained** (4.2): is a day 1 slaughter worth the risk though?

**Alumineous** (4): I literally have nothing else to say because all these songs sound exactly the same.

**bluetriangles04** (4): the 2014 pop folk revolution was an actual travesty against humanity

**ImADudeDuh** (4): https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Risk_it_All

**Roxieloxie** (4): well they cant all be winners

**Saison\_Marguerite** (3.5): the mildest stomp clap flavouring

**thedoctordances1940** (3.2): this is just so fucking nothing, it just sounds like we are young if it were written by people who had the most boring childhood ever 🧛

**apatel27** (3): I see that We Are Young plagarism

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): He’s certainly not risking anything musically.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): honestly this could be great with some editing

**timothy444** (3): offensively boring

**pig-serpent** (2): I like the guitar here but that chorus makes my skin crawl.

**Shelly\_AO29** (2): Didn't know it was possible to forget how a song goes before it even finishes playing.

**bulforster** (1.9): I feel like at least 5 other artists have made this exact song and they're all better so there's just no reason for this to exist.

**2dina3dworld** (1): would you risk trying to make a good song?

**you2009** (1): question mark

At least it's not worse than PATD's lol

**Verdantshade** (10): the real mcfly song on an album of mcfly imitations

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.2): this song makes me feel as if I was on a christian vacation camp bit I was suprisingly happy

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): You could tell me that this was an early Shawn outtake and I'd believe you without question.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): ended Brendon Urie

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): Cute song. Love the guitar riffs.

**throwaway-7650** (7): P!ATD WHO? anyway this is a song about meeting someone, falling in love instantly, and having very ambitious ideas... it’s really about meeting someone you want to settle down and spend every day with. usually when they perform this live they mash it up with on the floor, which is funny because this is about wanting to have a long-term committed relationship while on the floor is about wanting to fool around without getting attached

**TiltControls** (7): is this the high hopes **Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco** was singing about

**seanderlust** (6.9): this one's pretty fun! the chorus feels very charming. the "woo-hoo-hoo"s border on grating but just barely manage to not be

**emmaelf** (6.5): it's not their fault a better high hopes came out in the years since to make me sad i'm listening to this one but yeah

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): “everything I say might sound a little rehearsed” I appreciate that this song is meta about how pandering it is

**wannabemusiccritic** (6): similar to “Shout About It” but I like “Shout About It” better x

**roboticpandora** (5): I like the little “woo-hoo-ooohs”, those are fun.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): Brendon Urie outsold easily

**plastichaxan** (4): outsold p!atd omg

**wavingwolves** (3.9): docked points for the marriage mention

**apatel27** (3): Mumford and Sons shouldn't have been an inspiration

You know what? Fuck you, this isn't the 7th plague you guys like to pretend like it is! Am I surprised the reaction to a song about horny teens wanting to fuck an older lady? No, but y'all did absolutely too much to it.

This is a banger, and personally I find it hilarious, because I relate a little too much. There's nothing gayer than being a teen that wants to get absolutely destroyed by a guy that by all means is way too old for him. This song doesn't even imply that the older girl is into them, it's literally just a horny yearning song, they just like me fr!!!!



---

**apatel27** (11): lmao this is the funniest song in the whole rate. Just pure earnest teenage horniness & frustration, can't help but respect it

**CarlieScion** (10): jess from the veronicas: ur pedophile ass WILL be dealt with in due time

**hhiggy** (10): i still listen to this regularly like the BRIDGE cmon now

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.5): me being 12 at the time 

**starlitsuns** (9.5): I remember listening to this with my older cousin in her car, it was a bop then and is a bop now

**Bordersz** (9): That bridge is everything.

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): if i can listen to kpop songs with cringey english lyrics then i can listen to this too

**Verdantshade** (9): an absolutely iconic riff paired with a song that made me long to be 18.. funnily enough I've loved the song even more since turning 18

**seanderlust** (8.8): problematic and uncomfortable but i can't make it not bop

**bigbigbee** (8.5): This song sounds like it’s from a Sonic game soundtrack and I think that more music should be like that

**throwaway-7650** (8.1): the MV version of this 8.1 I mean 18 is MFAL

**celladonn** (8): The superior 18 in this rate I fear

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): I know the band talked about how they think this song didn't age well and that's fair (and applies to every song written about being a teenager), but this song is a hell of a lot of fun.

**wannabemusiccritic** (8): I just really like this song and idk why x

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): the pandering to the noona crowd on their debut oh shinee you're over

**pig-serpent** (7.5): I like the stacattoness of this hook.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): there’s so much to unpack here and I know other people will write some essays so I’ll just say this does bop

**babadork** (7.1): I would still like to never hear about their “private folder” ever again.

**2dina3dworld** (7): if they were American this song would be called “21”

**IIIHenryIII** (7): yeah, we've all been there, I guess? Except the cougar of my dreams just thought I was cute

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): me listening at 26 after losing 2 years to a pandemic trying to wish myself back to high school again lmao

**1998tweety** (6.5): absolute different energy than the 1D song

**thedoctordances1940** (6.3): any song called 18 immediately gives off some off vibes why are there two of them in this rate

**astrologicalangel** (6): I love that 2 out of 3 of these albums have a song called 18

**fadedblue09** (6): Serving early Fall Out Boy energy, and that's never a bad thing. I'll just pretend I can't understand the lyrics

**ImADudeDuh** (6): literally all of you but one were 18 by the time this released

**Roxieloxie** (6): I have no idea how I feel about this song now that Im older than 15.

**twat\_brained** (6): I can imagine the Aria Montgomery fancam and I've never seen a full PLL episode

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Cringe but I guess that makes it believable

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): oh god the charlie sheen reference was dated even when this song was new

**roboticpandora** (5.5): 1D wins the battle of "songs called 18 released that year" by a hair. The breakdown here is cool but it's not quite enough to make up for the lackluster chorus.

**akanewasright** (5): y’all are gonna talk about this song in therapy one day

**emmaelf** (5): i'm just too old for this song now.

**frogaranaman** (5): this being so wildly different from the 1D "18" is so funny

**martian\_pet** (5): how is this not written by harry styles

**plastichaxan** (5): straight people go through that too???

**poemforsmallthings** (5): I don't even know what to say about these lyrics

**PretentiousPegasus** (5): Lyrics are very questionable

**runaway3212** (5): one direction is not quacking at all

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4.5): rhyming magazine with Charlie Sheen, their Jewel serve!!! this is more problematic than 18 (One Direction) but it’s also slightly more musically passable

**wavingwolves** (4.5): this is just the western noona neomu yeppeo but much worse

**Alumineous** (4): My dude, if you can’t afford the bus fare, you most CERTAINLY cannot buy drinks at the bar with your dumbass fake ID. So why you waiting in line for this girl? She is playing you, dude, and it’s really sad.

**moonagenightmares** (4): these lyrics..

**Shelly\_AO29** (4): Why does this song feel kinda derivative? Like where have I heard it before? Anyway, I'm bored.

**TiltControls** (4): 18 < 18

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): I’m glad you don’t want to be Charlie Sheen.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Hope they stopped performing this one lol

**hikk** (3): we love grooming 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (3): this is the y/niest song on the y/n rate

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (3): i heavily despise the lyrics on this song, especially the line “she’s got a naughty tattoo in a place that i wanna get to, but my mum still drives me to school”

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): I don’t like the vibes here.

**timothy444** (2): This was a contender for my 0 in this rate and it probably would've if we didn't have to rate Meet the Vamps. Sure, it sounds great melodically but the lyrics just scream immature even for the target audience. Basically, it's just "What I Go to School For" and "Stacy's Mom" with all the charm sucked out of it

**you2009** (2): girl...

**bulforster** (1.4): I feel gross listening to this

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): NO NO NO THIS IS NOT OKAY I AM CALLING THE POLICE

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): Do your math homework, she sounds too old for you

**cremeebrulee** (0): the lyrics of this make me viscerally uncomfortable, like the absolute whiplash of them talking about her ass tattoo to them mentioning that their MOM still drives them around??? something something freud rolling in his grave

**seanderlust** (8.8): my favorite of the bonus Vamps tracks

**Bordersz** (8): Another ballad Bradley did what he had to DO. Sounds like something I would hear in a JCPenney’s.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Glad it escapes its sappy acoustic love ballad potential by having a well paced instrumental, builds and swells nicely

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this doesn’t give Vamps vibes at all

**wannabemusiccritic** (7.5): it’s a cute song I think 13-year-old me would have liked this x

**GamblesWithDesire** (6): Somehow this song reminds me about the early 2000s boy band BBMak? It's not a bad song, but it makes me want to go listen to BBMak.

**TiltControls** (6): it's cute

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): what in the ed sheeran (edit: this is christian radio fodder)

THIS ISNT MY BEAUTIFUL PERFECT AVERAGE FOR ONE DIRECTION!!!!!

I didn't expect this to be the first 1D song out tbh, but given that I never saw this ever doing too well,,,, not that big of a shock. This is a lovely bop, tho everytime I hear it it reminds me of [RBD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoayB0pLRC0), which I don't think is a very universal experience, but I think it has made me enjoy it more.

---

**Verdantshade** (11): rogue choice for an 11 I'll admit but it's such a simple song that has the sound of a classic - the harmonies are gorgeous and drop dead romantic and the little shoutouts to fleetwood mac and vance joy just make it

**Alumineous** (10): Goddamn, this is beautiful. Niall sounds beautiful. Everyone else is good too when they make that harmonious mix. Please, just take it back to the basics, it’s boring but at least it works.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): ahh so cute this has always been one of my faves on this album <3 trademark 1d ballad but amaze as usual

**Roxieloxie** (10): on the day of 1D's 10th anniversary I remember I stayed up at 4am to hear liam on capital one talk about the anniversary and stuff and he brought up how this song makes him feel calm and honestly he's right this song is the definition of just pure vibes

**throwaway-7650** (9.3): need this song to get all too well'd please and thanks

**wavingwolves** (9.2): it gives charity single a bit but in a good way

**akanewasright** (9): :floating:

**runaway3212** (9): talking heads outsold

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): Love acoustic 1D! Their voices sound heavenly.

**timothy444** (9): I love Talking Heads and 80s art pop

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): dreamy, ethereal, and sweet. another example of how amazing 1D's harmonies always were.

**teenwitches** (8): probably the best group harmony they ever did

**you2009** (8): lovely singing :)

**roboticpandora** (7): Solid acoustic ballad. Should have had a different title because I can't help but be reminded of the Talking Heads song of the same name.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): Talking Heads remain unbothered in light

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): their harmonies are super nice in the song I wish more was happening though

**twat\_brained** (6.8): I like it but I get why it's not on the main tracklist

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.5): we should do the New Wave Giants rate (I’m gonna be the annoying rave.dj person with my ballot idc) https://rave.dj/5hmWsxfUbJlCWg

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): so melancholy

**1998tweety** (6): snooze a bit, I feel like you either love this or find it meh.

**jackisboredtoday** (6): ended the talking heads

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Blandy bland bland… Did I already say bland?

**welcome2thejam** (6): Y/N fanfic idea: You hit your head at a One Direction concert, and when you wake up, you find yourself living in a shotgun shack. It's in another part of the world. You find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile, with a beautiful house, and five beautiful boys. And then you ask Harry, "Well, how did I get here?"

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (6): letting the days go by

**apatel27** (5): Sounds like the RCT3 loading music

**babadork** (5): I’m not really a fan of this era of Coldplay.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I like the idea of a softer moment on the album but unfortunately this could have been much better

**ImADudeDuh** (5): title reminds me of a NEW WAVE song that was GIANT that we haven’t yet RATEd in an album rate.

**TiltControls** (5): A bit forgettable tbh

**emmaelf** (4.5): thank god it's not longer.

**waluigiest** (4): ballads require good lyrics and good vocals

**IIIHenryIII** (3.5): now they're just putting me to sleep

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (3.5): snooze

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): I feel a little offended on behalf of the Talking Heads tbh.

**bulforster** (2.6): Now why am I disappointed this isn't a talking heads cover..

**2dina3dworld** (2): THIS IS NOT MY BEAUTIFUL TALKING HEADS

**Novuspyra** (2): I feel like this is a song meant to be sung by just one person, if that makes sense. There's something about it being divided between five people that drags it down for me.

**pig-serpent** (2): This is not my beautiful house! This is not my beautiful song!

**fadedblue09** (1): considering how we all roast The Vamps for doing this kind of music, I expect an early exit for this

This song is queercoded and taking it out so early is homophobic

---

**Bordersz** (11): since close as strangers isn’t in the rate ☹ , this song was my jam as a “misunderstood teen”

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (9): just me or the intro sounds like Sugar We’re Going Down by Fall Out Boy

**wavingwolves** (8.8): if you think about it... this is gay

**twat\_brained** (8.6): this came on autoplay after Meet The Vamps ended and it's already way fucking better, sounds like prime Fall Out Boy or Sum 41

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): it's nice for 5sos to not leave the burden of gay songs in this rate entirely to 1d

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): this song is about me ❤️

**apatel27** (7.5): Pre chorus sucks but rest is decent

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): we live in a society amirite, they really took notes from 00s pop punk on this one

**TiltControls** (7.5): Yassified Green Day

**bigbigbee** (7): Listen if you’re gonna hit me with the Sugar We’re Going Down guitar riff, you’re gonna have to be at least HALF as good as that song. It’s still fun though

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): This sounds more like a sum 41 song than a 5SOS song

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): Banger. This song would fit right in as the background song in an angsty teen movie.

**teenwitches** (7): good charlotte called and they want royalties

**emayzee** (6.8): we're going down down in an earlier round

**roboticpandora** (6.5): Okay so this song is a good time but it bites from “Sugar We’re Goin Down” too much

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): look, this whole album is various flavours of already done pop punk (in a good way), but this song feels a bit too on the nose

**1998tweety** (6): "I'll always be a part of the minority", says the cishet white men.

**celladonn** (6): Pretty sure they listened to Prisoner Of Society by The Living End and Minority by Green Day and thought "hmm let's make a really watered down version of that"

**moonagenightmares** (6): billie joe armstrong impersonation

**seanderlust** (6): you're all minorities...you're 5SOS members.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): why does this kind of sound like green day's minority song

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Me when people talk about how plagiarism lawsuits are ruining the industry: 😊 Me when someone copies a riff from my favorite band and gives zero credit: 😠

**Verdantshade** (6): try-hard edgy was definitely their entire identity but this just doesn't feel tongue-in-cheek at all like their other songs so it just falls flat?

**welcome2thejam** (6): Doesn't live up to it but I suppose I appreciate the Sum 41 reference

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (6): do it yourself!

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): WHAT THE F IS A CH~~O~~ANCE ~~NIALL~~ CALUM?

**fadedblue09** (5): Is this ripping off "Sugar We're Goin Down"?

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): 5SOS spent their first two album eras (plus all those eps) dropping in these Green Day rip-off songs and they're the weakest songs in the discography 90% of the time.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): kinda wanna punch this song in the face

**plastichaxan** (5): omg when they were part of the glee club

**bulforster** (4.8): good on them for breaking out the rhyming dictionary!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4.5): Fat Lip had a baby with Sugar We’re Going Down but it grew up uglier than both of them.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): ok, I can keep my promise, I swear. I won't comment on the lyrics... I'm no longer the target audience

**pig-serpent** (4): This song lifts the guitar riff from Sugar We're Goin Down and has lyrics that resemble Minority by Green Day.  The references to good bands are cute but at a certain point you have to learn to write your own songs.

**poemforsmallthings** (4): I like the part in the chorus where Michael sings and you can't understand a word he says

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): tbh my 9-5 is the best job i've had

**babadork** (3): I do not appreciate being reminded that I could be listening to something better.

**timothy444** (3): Luke Hemmings vocals sound particularly awful here?

**thedoctordances1940** (2.2): no features no swedish songwriters no trap beats 100% pure uncut rock

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): i’m a weirdo i don’t fit in etc

**Stryxen** (2): when a song opens like …that… oh it’s gonna be a horrible time

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): you're a part of the MINORITY? FUCK OFF!

**jackisboredtoday** (0): answers the pressing question: what if Sugar We’re Goin Down was bad??

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): i love this song GOODBYE ROXIE.

**wavingwolves** (10): underrated<3 it's a cute moment and liam shines in this in a way he will never be able to do so with his solo music

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): Cute, but also just a little bit *there* too. The lyrics are clunky, oddly so for this point in 1D's career.

**skargardin** (8): It's simply impossible for songs titled Illusion to be bad

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): another why is this a bonus track challenge

**TiltControls** (8): Took a bit to grow on me, but it's a fun ride

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.7): I love VNV Nation omg

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**twat\_brained** (7.2): love the reverb tail to introduce the song but there's not much going for it after. Pretty fun though

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): Austin Moon outsold

**throwaway-7650** (7): idk what to say about the song so fuck spotify for not having lyrics!

**timothy444** (7): Can I just say how much I love the way they sing the word "illusion"? Besides, this is pretty decent

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (7): it was a perfect illusion

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I actually had to look up the line distribution for this one because one of the guys sounds really bad and it turns out it’s Liam, which is a shame because he’s hot

**apatel27** (6): The way Zayn sings "It's not an illusion to me" sounds so familiar

**Roxieloxie** (6): this is the 3rd worst song in 1D's discography but i cant bring myself to 0 it

**seanderlust** (6): thank you for not turning my heart into broken farts

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Struggling to think of more synonyms for “bland”

**bulforster** (5.2): they definitely have the range for a better chorus than this

**roboticpandora** (4.5): I guess I just generally don't vibe with 1D's takes on anthemic choruses? I loved "Story of My Life" though!

**akanewasright** (4): …huh

**pig-serpent** (4): Wow, another 1D song with a well written melody and a boring as white paint instrumental, color me shocked.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3.5): This is so nondescript wait how did it go again.

**martian\_pet** (3): were John Ryan & Julian Bunetta held hostage in the studio until they filled out their songs quota?

**Shelly\_AO29** (3): Least favourite of FOUR’s bonus tracks.

**Verdantshade** (3): right this song is pure garbage and easily my least favourite song by 1d (and yes that includes everything from uan), the melody and lyrics do absolutely nothing for me and it's a rehash of the banger that is magic so SKIP

**Alumineous** (2): The first half of this album was so good, what happened. I blame Liam.

**emmaelf** (2): it sounds like jls and that is not a compliment.

**IIIHenryIII** (1): I wish but the suffering is real

**twat\_brained** (8.6): I may be feeling generous after MTV (I'm so sorry MTV the network) but I'm loving this album!

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8.5): they really had a thing for foreign girls ig

**wavingwolves** (8.4): who was in the studio wiping some glasses and let the noise in the mixing omfg fuck you.. um.. MICHAEL! gonna blame you for that one

**2dina3dworld** (8): kings of appreciating women of all nationalities

**followingfreeways** (8): i drive a minivan. lol

**pig-serpent** (8): Has cheesey 2008 pop rock vibes, where it's a song I'd stick on a playlist and get excited every time it comes on but never go out of my way to listen to or show anyone.

**1998tweety** (7.5): racist /s

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this sounds like some other song but idk what it is supposed to be.

**roboticpandora** (7.5): I’m from New York and I feel like I say ‘hello’ normal??? Like that is not one of the words I have a noticeable accent for.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): for an australian band they sure are obssessed with america

**bulforster** (7.3): exoticising Americans is anti-imperialist praxis

**cremeebrulee** (7): 🧍🏽‍♀️

**emmaelf** (7): this song is better than it has any right to be

**plastichaxan** (7): that sound in the back omg their hyperpop era

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): The pre-chorus and instrumentation are the best parts of this song. Michael's "aaaahhh" in the bridge though, lol.

**Verdantshade** (7): I CANNOT stand that sound that plays in the instrumental breaks and verses

**fadedblue09** (6): They sure have a certain type huh

**GamblesWithDesire** (6): Fun, but not fun enough to overcome the cheese unfortunately.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): english love affair outsold

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The bridge made me give this a lower score than it should have gotten

**welcome2thejam** (6): Mrs.? Is this MILF the woman from 18?

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): If Mitski covered Fireproof I can say this title is making me think about Your Best American Girl

**apatel27** (5): They really do be milf hunting a lot

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I like the drums

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): ok why isn't greenlight on this list and this is

**throwaway-7650** (5): 5SOS finally living up to their name... 1D would NEVER

**timothy444** (5): For a bunch of Australians, they sure are obsessed with talking about an inferior country.

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (5): london boy

**Alumineous** (4): My god, why are they obsessed with American things.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Not a fan of that muted “doot doot doot” noise in the background.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Maybe she likes “na na na na na na” but I don’t

**seanderlust** (3.7): " Basically this is the 5SOS version of “Stacy’s Mom.”" okay yeah but stacy's mom has charisma and personality. the bit about the boy overdramatizing her telling him that he missed a spot while mowing the lawn? comedy gold. this just...comes and goes. also that screechy synth (?) in the bg of the chorus is not it

**Stryxen** (3.7): what on earth

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (2.5): this is kinda irritating to listen to

**starlitsuns** (2): this sounds like an up all night era 1D song... needless to say it doesn't sound very good at all

**TiltControls** (2): something about this song just feels wrong

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): No thank youuuuu. These lyrics make me wince :(

**emayzee** (10): crazy how a song you've never heard before can nevertheless transport you to the summers when you stayed home all day and regularly hit post limit on tumblr

**fadedblue09** (10): Really catchy, one of my favorite discoveries in the rate. A major 11 contender too.

**frogaranaman** (10): how many members of The Vamps have hurricanes named after them

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): I’m gonna give this song a 10 just because the date at the beginning of the video is my birthday

**seanderlust** (9.5): okay! we can have a lil optimism, as a treat

**bigbigbee** (8.5): wow I didn’t realize it at the time but 2014 really had a sound, didn’t it

**bulforster** (8.5): Stomp-clappified ridin solo aka the best vamps song here

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): It’s cute and catchy and sometimes that’s enough.

**followingfreeways** (8): if i look over the old navy advertisement energy of the song it kind of bops

**hhiggy** (8): this is cute i laugh at the tapping my shoes part

**PretentiousPegasus** (8): I'm pretty sure this was the top song in my Spotify wrapped in 2016 lmao

**Roxieloxie** (8): This is not as bad as I originally thought it was tbh, its not amazing but I can have fun with it

**runaway3212** (8): bridget mendler or w/e her name was wishes she could do this

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): again, why isn't this on the australian version of this album on AM lol anyway its a bop

**throwaway-7650** (8): bridgit mendler outsold. [stream](https://tinyurl.com/36ana6z3)!

**twat\_brained** (8): okay this is cool but tell me they ran Bridgit her check

**akanewasright** (7.5): this fucking video… the flashbacks…

**Stryxen** (7.5): okayyy boys serve

**1998tweety** (7): Bridget Mendler washed

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): Simple, straightforward, catchy. The instruments feel fuller here than they have on most of the songs so far.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this is a tad more generic for me than the other songs, but it’s not bad

**rotating3Dtext** (7): high? grass? mmh

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): Decent song.

**Verdantshade** (7): I've never seen a version of the album with this song on it and I've honestly only heard it a couple of times so there's no nostalgia points but it's alright ig

**wavingwolves** (6.8): the movie that has this in its soundtrack has the worst name i've ever seen.... i guess we could say it's a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad name

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): this is from the soundtrack to a movie with Donald Glover in it and they asked the Vamps to record a song instead… this sure was 2014

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): checking spotify and seeing this was on the soundtrack to a b-tier kids movie was the closest thing to the complete opposite of surprise I've ever experienced

**starlitsuns** (6): the pop countryish sound almost helps differentiate this in some way? like this sounds like a pre-bro-country track and it doesn't bother me, probably because my parents used to listen to country music before 2014ish

**teenwitches** (6): sounds like a freeform show theme song

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (6): forgettable ngl

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5.5): they wanna be Bridgit Mendler so bad

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i’m BOARDING UP THE WINDOW!

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (5): how often does a crocodile get inside your house

**thedoctordances1940** (4.6): the fucking stomp clap STOP IT I HATE IT 🧛

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): The Vamps and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Song

**IIIHenryIII** (4): Bridgit did it better

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): crickets

**pig-serpent** (4): I know the Vamps don't want to sound like this, and yet executives thought people would want them to sound like this, and why?  Who wants music to sound like this?  Why would anyone think people want music to sound like this?  There's a good song buried somewhere in here but instead it's part of a race to the bottom of stomp clap indie crossover.

**roboticpandora** (4): Not sure about these lyrical choices gents, that metaphor is getting stretched pretty thin.

**TiltControls** (4): what disney tv show was this the intro song to

**timothy444** (4): so turns out that this song is from the Alexander Bad Day disney movie but also not on the UK tracklist which I used to rate this album. I'm just going to flatly say how I'm refusing to listen to this because I know exactly from listening to the whole album how bad and boring this is gonna be. Giving it a 4 is really generous as well because it's probably closer to a 2.

**apatel27** (3): Why can't they be original with their melodies

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): this would play at like a hockey game, idk

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): The “I’m so fucking happy holy shit” genre of songs have the potential to really hit you in the gut when you’re in the right mood… but for the 95% of your life you’re NOT, listening to this shit makes you want to hurt something

**you2009** (3): had to queue up the bridgit mendler song after this to cleanse my ears

**2dina3dworld** (2.5): this was in “Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY” which is a roast in itself

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): “spaces between us hold all our secrets” this is actually a coming out statement. Harry told me himself

**Roxieloxie** (10): no because they were so fucking EVIL for writing this song and hinting at all of 2015 i will never forgive them. They did this live twice and the harmony was so beautiful.

**akanewasright** (9): wow what a nice song! good thing it’s completely fictional and wasn’t a sign of the group getting ready to break up!

**followingfreeways** (9): i cried to this when zayn left :)

**GamblesWithDesire** (9): I frequently forget that this song is on the album tbh but I do really enjoy the angst of it, especially when you look at it in the context of the looming Zexit.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): girl i wonder how zayn felt when they recorded this in the studio like they really just subtweeted his ass in a song he had to record aksdfkdfsddf it’s so funny when you think about it

**teenwitches** (9): really looking forward to the 7-year anniversary of me crying while listening to this song after finding out zayn quit the band 😭

**timothy444** (9): Powerful ballad

**wavingwolves** (9): this just hits but it has never hit more than when zayn left the group after we joked for months he would and that this song was about that

**throwaway-7650** (8.3): the chorus is actually the pinnacle of all music** but the verses...

**seanderlust** (8): "oh when will we learn" - the world after viewing The SammyClassicSonicFan's videos

**starlitsuns** (8): this hurt after Zayn left the group and it still hurts now, just for different reasons

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): Zayn: Is this fucking play about us

**waluigiest** (6): they kind of sound like troye sivan, no?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): A cute little song I will never come back to.

**Bordersz** (5.5): Meh. Couldn’t care about the song. It’s OK.

**babadork** (5.2): The whole album has an 80s vibe, but this is weirdly charity song-esque.

**apatel27** (5): Coldplay cosplay

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Wow more blandness

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Pretty okay until that annoying “bye^eye^^eye^^^eye” hook happens

**roboticpandora** (4): Unfortunately, this is giving late U2.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): this song is just a waste of time while i get to stockholm syndrome

**emmaelf** (3.5): i mean i completely forgot this existed and i listened to this album on repeat for a whole year, it suffers the 1d ballad fate of boredom.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): and we're back to boring ballads

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): this drags.

**martian\_pet** (3): It's a skip sorry

**welcome2thejam** (3): Thought the first lyric was "who's gonna be the first one to start the fire" and thought wow, what was a nice transition & synergy after Fireproof. Nope, just misheard an accent.

**bulforster** (2.3): Fittingly for the title this song does have a big hollow chorus

**Alumineous** (2): They followed up Fireproof with this?

**pig-serpent** (2): I like the lyrical themes and... nothing else.

**Shelly\_AO29** (2): Whoever decided to place this on the album in the middle of such an amazing run of songs needs to go to jail. This song is clearly a Coldplay ripoff, and lacks all of the qualities that make Coldplay songs work (Chris Martin’s amazing piano playing being an example). On top of that it’s super boring. Also, the beatboxing?! Whose idea was that?

**2dina3dworld** (1): Turns out Zayn was the first one to say goodbye

**IIIHenryIII** (1): just when I thought I had heard the worst song off the album, they manage to impress me once again

Bordersz: 😂 I’m glad it’s out and today is Zexit day! The song never did anything for me and I never understood Directioners who get emotional to this song.
