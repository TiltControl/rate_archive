Y/N's Favorite 2014 Boy Bands Reveal, Day 2: I'm not fine at all:///
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/tp3i9p/yns_favorite_2014_boy_bands_reveal_day_2_im_not/

[Hi guys, it's ricki here:\)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EErozSyXkAIlLWR.jpg)

After getting rid of most of The Vamps' songs yesterday, we come back to either get rid of them completely, or picking a new victim to slaughter. We'll reveal the songs placing **#30** to **#16**. We'll also reveal some of the bonus songs depending on their average, as if they were in the main rate. 

**Important information.** The reveal will be taking place in [**queup.net**](https://www.queup.net/join/ripplugdj), because if there's one thing I like my reveals to be in guinea pigs to test new platforms. If that fails, the new platform will be revealed shortly after (likely being beatsense).



Make sure to keep this thread open, as I will be unveiling your comments and scores for each of the songs as they go out, featuring all scores, comments, rank graphs and banners.

Back on our bullshit.

I'll be honest, I'm surprised by this. When I first pitched this idea I was only aware of The Vamps' singles, which I considered to at the very least be fun and I genuinely thought this was one of their songs that had a good chance of doing well, and I honestly believe it deserves a lot better than this. It's just a bop and I can't help but feel that it would have been received better had it come from a group more universally liked in the sub >!I even argue that there are similar songs to this still in the rate!<.

---

#last night we were dancing singing all our favorite songs!

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): oh I loved this! Very catchy, very well constructed, and I'm a sucker for party songs like this.

**throwaway-7650** (10): I thought this song was big in the states - ~~charli XCX~~ MK

**Roxieloxie** (9.3): They really do a good job on the first half of this album just being really fun pure bops! and i really appreciate them for that.

**celladonn** (9): That "by the end of the NOIGHT" is so powerful

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): The way I was OBSESSED with this song in high school

**runaway3212** (9): me relating to this song despite it being like not good at all and thus giving it a high score

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): and we danced all night to the best song ever, we knew every line, now I can’t remember

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I thought this group was supposed to be bad??

**Shelly\_AO29** (8): Such a fun song without being cheesy.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Bright and fun with a solid as hell hook

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (8): oh i forgot about this song i guess it was nice

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This chorus is sooo good but everything surrounding it lets it down, especially that bridge

**1998tweety** (7): filler but decent

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Very much a poor man’s last Friday Night but it’s cute!

**bluetriangles04** (7): past this song, this album is so painful to get through for me, that it hurts. the album is so topheavy with the first 3 tracks being inoffensive and catchy enough to be enjoyable at the very least

**emmaelf** (7): there's nothing amazing about any of this but there's also nothing terrible. it's just generic advert music that won't offend midwestern housewives.

**followingfreeways** (7): this is killing me ive never listened to this band before but they look all of 14 years old on the cover of this talking about "what the hell did i do last night" idk what did you do? go skateboard at the park?

**frogaranaman** (7): why do they sound prepubescent in this song

**poemforsmallthings** (7): this chorus is so fun let's pretend the entire song sounds like that

**timothy444** (7): Alright and fun song; gotta say love the weird melodic choices in the chorus

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The kind of song that listening to makes me feel stupid but in a good way… does that make sense?

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): the weakest out of the singles on this album imo but it’s still good!

**TiltControls** (6.5): is this not an american authors song

**wavingwolves** (6.4): why so many songs in the early 00s were so expressive of the fear of having no tomorrow... like... you guys aren't even living in a pandemic or anything...

**twat\_brained** (6.3): this sounds like what "Up All Night" would be like if it was edited for TV which is lowkey impressive

**akanewasright** (6): This is the one vamps song I have nothing to say about LMAO. Like it’s fine, it exists, I don’t dislike it, which means it’s one of the better songs

**cremeebrulee** (6): they need to be crediting katy for this, like olivia rodrigo style

**fadedblue09** (6): Sounds more G-rated than a lot of Hollywood Records songs

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): nothing noteworthy but not unenjoyable

#my head dont feel so bright

**Verdantshade** (6): this goes in the bin with lwwy and other shitty boyband singles about parties

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): this is highkey a MattyBRaps song

**bulforster** (5.4): everyone wants their familiar tonight tonight moment or whatever

**Alumineous** (5): Someone make a count of all the hookup songs that literally have the same plot.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): go grow a mustache, kid

**skargardin** (5): the chants are a bit much

**starlitsuns** (5): okay this was definitely what I was expecting for this album to sound like according to you all, very middle of the road and definitely not my taste for sure

**thedoctordances1940** (4.7): 🧛

**roboticpandora** (4): A bit bland. The sound and the lyrics could have been cobbled together from any random 2010s adult contemporary radio hit.

**jasannn** (3): these harmonies annoy me for some reason

**pig-serpent** (3): I think I'm having an allergic reaction to this song.

**you2009** (3): I wish I liked their voices more. a catchy pop hook can only do so much when I hate the sonics. bridge also pissed me off a bit

**apatel27** (2): The worst of 00s brit pop rock distilled

If you just hate irish people just say that pussy_eyeroll

This song had it rough from the beginning, and I'm baffled at how controversial it ended up being. I understand that an irish jig mixed with EDM is going to be a little poolarizing, but the hatred this got was undeserved. LET YOURSELF LOOSE! ENJOY LIFE FOR THE SILLY THINGS IT BRINGS YOU! DO THE IRISH JIG WITH NIALL!!!

---

#fit and young

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): I admit this is a very strange pick for my 11 but it's probably the most entertaining song in the rate and is pretty funny. it makes me smile, so why not?

**2dina3dworld** (10): bit Blink-182 innit?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): single-handedly ended the Irish Potato Famine

**frogaranaman** (10): this song trended on Tiktok and I legit thought it was a formal rendition of a traditional Irish tap dancing song

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): this song is straight laced with SOMETHING. and it's not just the pain that comes from 1D playing the outro like 5 times at their final concert, or the pain that comes from those isolated vocals that just have them laughing in the background. it's something else, something stronger, something dumber. something only 1D could ever make you feel.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): youth anthem

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this is literally their aju nice if you think about it...also who remembers that tumblr post that was like "every 1d album needs 3 ballads about love, 2 queer-coded songs, and 1 irish-sounding song to keep niall happy". actually i think i just made that up but the point still stands

**Novuspyra** (10): Look. I know it's not actually a 10. But Niall takes the lead on this song, and until we discover the dark and dirty secrets he's hiding behind his squeaky clean image, I will continue to be a ride or die Niall stan. Plus, I genuinely believe it's one of One Direction's most fun songs.

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is the best song ever of the rate. A song that will mean nothing to you all but to those of you who remember shefield ocotober 31st 2015 ,,,, yeah ,,, britney crying gif

**runaway3212** (10): slay closer

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): Is this song bad? Yes. Do I still love it with all my heart and soul? Also yes.

**starlitsuns** (10): everyone please stand for the Irish national anthem

**twat\_brained** (10): the song's writer when asked what inspired it: https://twitter.com/julianbulian/status/533115599862648832?s=20&t=g3zpucPIk81tTUQch8YSvQ

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): the first time I heard this was also the first time I streamed the beg for you remix with A.G. cook/vernon. that was... quite the experience!

**wavingwolves** (9.1): if post-good music exists now then this is like pre-post-good music and just a little trait for nail and irish people

**waluigiest** (9): this is corny! And i like it

**you2009** (9): age regressors anthem

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): B*Witched took all the running so there was nothing left for this song to do but walk

**roboticpandora** (8.5): Ok Blur lets go!!!

**teenwitches** (8.5): piratecore

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): this shanty ass song

**1998tweety** (8): I feel like I shouldn't like this but I do

**followingfreeways** (8): honestly this song isn't objectively good at all but over time ive grown to love it as a banger and as a friendship anthem

**pig-serpent** (8): The verses have a great piratey swing to them and it's amazingly fun!  It was setting up to be the best song on the album but then the chorus is the same mushy, sappy, washed out drivel as 70% of the rest of the album and like!  WTF!  Why'd you ruin your best song like this!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): St. Patrick’s Day banger

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): tell me why this sounds like the pirates of the caribbean soundtrack

**Verdantshade** (8): I'm gonna be honest I don't like this song much but these bastards have made it part of their legend after their final gig, it does never fail to cheer me up at least and I hope to god we get a reunion before they turn like 70

**ignitethephoenix** (7.6): Niall said let me sprinkle some Irish on this album!

**moonagenightmares** (7.5): insert leprechaun joke

**celladonn** (7): I don't precisely think this is good but at least it wakes you up after the string of boring tracks preceding it

**emmaelf** (7): i'd rather listen to when i'm 64 by the beatles but i'll take this too

**plastichaxan** (7): oh it’s THAT song

**TiltControls** (7): It's no Katy Perry, but it's fun enough

**timothy444** (7): This walks a dangerous line between decent and damn right annoying especially considering the subject matter of this song. Thankfully, this song doesn't reach 'The Vamps' levels of bad

**bigbigbee** (6.5): British accent with a southern American twang wasn’t what I expected from this album

#fat and old

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): better Irish sounding song than Galway Girl, but these lyrics…. they could have spent more time on those

**babadork** (6): This is fun, but my swollen joints strongly object.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.4): what is this mess sweetie…

**CarlieScion** (5): this is too camp to rate in any way that expresses my actual opinion

**akanewasright** (4.5): Irish folk… dubstep? The fuck is this 😭

**martian\_pet** (4.5): the verses and bridge are a 6.5 (good, funny, catchy) and the chorus is like not good, except the last one i wish they all were like that

**apatel27** (4): turns out wub wub irish folk isn't a good genre

**bulforster** (3.5): Well at least it's something different!

**seanderlust** (3.5): I don't think you all understand how hard it will be to stay up all night when you're old. even at like 30...you learn to value sleep.

**Alumineous** (3): I’ll admit, it does make sense as a closer, it’s very anthemic. But it's so childish, which I guess is the point but still.

**IIIHenryIII** (3): why should I? Being an adult sucks

**wannabemusiccritic** (3): worst on this album

**poemforsmallthings** (2.5): top 5 worst 1D songs?

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (2.5): on some days, this song is even more annoying than girl almighty

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Well maybe you should.

**PretentiousPegasus** (2): I'm embarassed to say this was my favourite song from FOUR in 2014. The song itself that bad but the lyrics..

**Stryxen** (1): not the jig

**thedoctordances1940** (1): ...

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (1): i’m so sorry but this is awful, like lost boys from peter pan but the type of lost boys that would put gum in your hair and call you fruity patootie

**fadedblue09** (0): Galway Girl is unironically a better tribute to Irish music than this

**hhiggy** (0): does anyone remember that video on twitter that kept going viral of those people dancing and the beginning of this song was playing over it

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): Holy jesus fuck please stop. Did they have a meeting to brainstorm the most annoying things they could put into a single song? Whistling, na-na-nas, EDM synths, a fucking JIG??? Even worse is that they’re practically begging a comparison to the Beatles’ When I’m Sixty-Four, which does everything in this song a million times better, with the bonus of NOT HAVING A LOUD ANNOYING-ASS JIG!

And just like that, The Vamps are fully out of the bonus rate.

Honestly, this is the only bonus track from them that I thought was worthwhile. It is very dramatic, but I think it works here, I don't immediately roll my eyes to melodrama of it all. I'm not sure why this wasn't just in the album, especially given some of the songs that DID make the cut. 

---

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): imma give it a ten cuz it's the first the vamp's song I've really enjoyed in a while

**Verdantshade** (10): so this is probably my favourite vamps song (along with dangerous which ISN'T EVEN ON THIS RATE) but there's something just so right about that fanfic setting of falling in love with a girl in a cafe listening to fucking wonderwall of all songs and I honestly want that to happen for me

**bluetriangles04** (9): I really enjoyed this one, probably would have to be my favorite song from them this rate

**GamblesWithDesire** (9): heyyyyy another song that I really fuck with. Maybe because it feels more like Cherry Blossom? I'm not gonna question it.

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): I don't know how to describe it but this song just embodies the early 2010s for me, I loved it when it came out.

**TiltControls** (8.5): still some shaky vocals, but this is probably the strongest lyricism I've heard from The Vamps. Edit: oh wait nevermind I just got to the wonderwall part. Still it's a fun bop!

**wavingwolves** (8.1): this is almost a the wanted song (complimentary)

**CarlieScion** (7): ahead of its time

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): what in the shawn mendes (does he play piano? [edit: yes!])

**frogaranaman** (6): is this their first time having sex

**roboticpandora** (5.5): You shouldn’t reference another, more famous song in your song unless you’re sure that your song is better. Because now I just wanna go listen to (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (5.5): sounds like an Up All Night reject

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I feel like it had potential, but they wasted it all

**seanderlust** (5): boy we just rocked our way right across the line between cute and creepy huh

**welcome2thejam** (5): Is his big move really correcting her singing of Wonderwall

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (5): needy dog

**apatel27** (2): Don't correct other peoples lipsyncing k ty

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): How are they gonna make being lovestruck sound so boring??? Actually this is really creepy, don’t interrupt a woman who’s wearing headphones (she clearly doesn’t want to be bothered) and why are they threatening to sleep in her stairwell?

The location exclusive trick 5SOS was straight up hilarious. Mrs All American and English Love Affair in the US and UK version, while the international copies got this song, a banger about being lost and traveling the entire world to find you, THEIR MINDS! I have to respect the hustle.

There's also multiple comments about Ruth B,,,, why are so many of yall thinking about her?


---

**bulforster** (10): Now why tf is this smasha relegated to the b-sides???

**CarlieScion** (10): the best of the localized pander-songs < 3

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): Almost gave this my 11, fantastic song

**Verdantshade** (10): one of the hidden gems of their discography, and I literally held off buying the cd for the album until I went to australia just to have this song.. it is my (slowly fading) dream to experience the 'come find me's live.. sonically I love it for the same reasons as end up here but I'm honestly just a huge sucker for peter pan metaphors (peter pan syndrome anyone????)

**seanderlust** (9.7): i'm a sucker for a peter pan reference/metaphor. this would be a 10 were it not for the vocal effects at the end of the chorus

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I see they saved the best song for their homeland

**throwaway-7650** (8.9): a lost boy (8.9) asks "where do broken hearts go (8.7)?" ... '8:8'

**roboticpandora** (8.5): mmmm I love a chunky power chord

**fadedblue09** (8): ooh I love the unusual sound

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): The chorus could be less repetitive, but this is another song that feels more indicative of where 5SOS was gonna go.

**moonagenightmares** (7.7): ……camp?

**twat\_brained** (7.6): i forgot how it sounds but it definitely slaps

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): remember Ruth B?

**1998tweety** (7): she's cute

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): wait why is this bridge so good??

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): Decent bop.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): It’s better than that awful Ruth B song at least.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): the come find me part saved it for me

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): their Ruth B moment

**wavingwolves** (6.2): "you left me without direction" me when one direction entered their """hiatus"""" ://////

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): i love the verse melody! if the rest of the song was as good this would be a 10 probably

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): this is soooo nostalgic sounding wow

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (6): ruth b STAYS losing

**ignitethephoenix** (5.8): Ruth B and Peter Pan outsold

**emmaelf** (5.5): would have been better without the come and find me section but it's fine

**Roxieloxie** (5): they dont do simping well they gotta go full misogyny

**runaway3212** (5): Ruth B queen

**TiltControls** (5): I kind of hate the 'Lost Boy' section here. But the rest of the song is really fun. Let's put it right in the middle then

**timothy444** (5): The Peter Pan allegory in this song has been done to death by the time 2014 came and this adds absolutely nothing new to that. It's uninspired

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I’m a lost boy… yeah I’m a lost boy… oh no I’m a lost boy… have I told you I’m a lost boy…

**apatel27** (4): Please go somewhere please

**ImADudeDuh** (4): The Midnight washed

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (4): there’s so many good songs from that era (Wherever You Are, Daylight, Close As Strangers, Independence Day, Greenlight) and yet y’all chose to include this snooze-fest…aight

**akanewasright** (3): why do I hate the chorus?

**TheQueenofVultures** (2): how many times did they make this song?

**plastichaxan** (11): not sure why this is what stuck with me but i’ll take it

**CarlieScion** (10): men apologising is so sexy

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): A masterpiece

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this sounds like a boys like girls song which is why i love it so much

**GamblesWithDesire** (9): I don't frequently go "hunting" to listen to this song specifically when I'm on a 5SOS kick, but every time it comes on shuffle, I'm reminded of how good it is.

**roboticpandora** (9): A headbanger of a chorus with a bit of a Jimmy Eat World vibe. Would have been my 11 if it stopped at 2:31.

**Verdantshade** (9): the budget 1d song made for stadium singalongs but my god if it doesn't hit every single spot right

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): but you just said it… so you didn't not say it anymore… this is too confusing

**runaway3212** (8): this song encourages roleplaying and fanfic writing

**akanewasright** (7.5): relatable kings, I also think of the right thing to say after I’ve already been cut out!

**throwaway-7650** (7.1): [see the song title for my comment for this song]

**Bordersz** (7): the bridge bumped that song up by a full point

**twat\_brained** (7): usually men shouldn't say anything but you can be exceptions in this instance

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I’ll give props to this song, I think it’s the most spot-on track on this album when it comes to evoking that 90s-00s pop punk vibe

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (7): another song that just exists to me, nothing special about it

**Stryxen** (6.7): why does every song here have a part that sounds exactly like this outro god i’m sick of this - this song was good until that part too skull emoji

**pig-serpent** (6.5): The ohs are annoying but the chorus is good.

**1998tweety** (6): the song is kind of meh but the bridge elevated it

**apatel27** (6): Not too bad for a boyband ballad

**IIIHenryIII** (6): it feels like a grower

**Novuspyra** (6): It's good but I feel like the end part of the chorus weighs it down.

**TiltControls** (6): This sounds like it could be a Simple Plan song

**timothy444** (6): very forgettable

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (6): just let her go!

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): one of the tags on last.fm for this is “not bad” and I agree tbh. It’s aggressively average

**bulforster** (5.2): there's like a tiny glimmer of a feeling that isn't teenage horniness on this one that I can appreciate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): It’s kind of hard to get past the millennial whooping in intro and outdo.

**hhiggy** (5): i've never liked this

**jasannn** (5): this sounds like a The Vamps Song in a bad way.

**moonagenightmares** (5): ive got a strong desire to tank any song with such bland ohohohs as a chorus

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): got kinda annoying by the end methinks

**Shelly\_AO29** (5): The post chorus "woahh" and good melody is the saving grace of this otherwise tepid song about a breakup.

**you2009** (5): veers too much into ho hey territory for my tastes

**Alumineous** (4): The instrumentals are all very similar so far, so that’s impacting the score. Ironically, this song didn’t tell us what he didn’t get to say. Like, it seems like this guy did the wrong actions, like not putting her first. If so, a long ass letter isn’t gonna fix shit. This dude is just bad at relationships lol

**welcome2thejam** (4): The bridge with the strings is pretty nice, but overall I'm just left indifferent

**wavingwolves** (3.1): i can't pinpoint exactly what it is but there's one element of this instrumental that i *really* hate

**hikk** (3): mixing of instrumental is so shit

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): possibly the least genuine sounding song in the rate

The single that made them snowball into the group they are now. Without *Heartbreak Girl* I don't know 5SOS would have blown up like they did, and I will forever look back on this song with love and fondness, but I understand why not everyone is willing to offer the same kindness to this as I do. 

This song is not... outrageously *nice guy*-y, but it does have hints of that, especially with mentions of the friendzone and just the whole concept of a dude being like "i should be the one you should pay attention to>:(", but I think it's charming still, especially when you cut them some slack given that they were literal teenagers when they released this.

I get why this was on the album, but their age shows here more than any track ever, and in hindsight, knowing that this debut would end up getting bigger hits than this song, it should have just been left out.


---


# what you're looking for has been here the whole time 

**hhiggy** (10): who listened to this on youtube for months before they officially released it

**you2009** (10): breaking heart emoje forreal

**Alumineous** (9): That’s weirdly common. A guy and girl are best friends, but the girl gets another man as a bf, and the guy best friend is like secretly in love with her. So, in other words, Zoey 101 with Chase and Zoey.

**followingfreeways** (9): classic

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9): heartbreak girl was actually a girlboss who didn’t need no cure but the song still slaps

**poemforsmallthings** (9): we love you You Belong With Me

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): Love love love that guitar riff. Realised this is one of the songs they made before they were signed to a major label, no wonder it's so good. 5SOS have NO taste because how was this song in the lowest tier in their ranking?

**throwaway-7650** (9): this song has a bit too much treat you better energy I fear

**TiltControls** (9): oooh I love that guitar. This is a full bop

**emayzee** (8.6): did you learn this song from troye sivan covering it on his youtube channel in 2013 or were you normal

**celladonn** (8.5): The lyrics make me roll my eyes a bit but this is a bop otherwise

**akanewasright** (8): this keeps reminding me of “Ghost” by Halsey but this is lowkey a better song so I’ll look the other way

**CarlieScion** (8): You Belong With Me (5SOS version)

**cremeebrulee** (8): this is a taylor swift song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i think this would fit well on the angus, thongs and perfect snogging soundtrack

**twat\_brained** (8): remember in 2013 when the album wasn't announced so this was their closer for their opening set on the TMH tour? Reminds me of Boys Like Girls opening for Avril Lavigne. Not loving the reggaeish pattern on the verses though.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (8): whoever said this was the male version of You Belong With Me, you are so correct

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): Taio Cruz singer of the SMASH break your heart found dead in a ditch

**1998tweety** (7.5): I wish they put the same crack from the verses into the chorus

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): the friendzone mention omfg this really is 2014

**moonagenightmares** (7): #friendzone

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): The first 5SOS song I ever heard. Nice Guy ™ anthem

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): if this were by a woman I think it would be better… like I’m sorry but I just don’t believe these guys are gonna be better for her than being single, I read the Rolling Stone profile

**IIIHenryIII** (6): it's giving "badda dan he can"


#stuck in the friendzone again and again 

**Novuspyra** (6): Point docked for saying "friendzone."

**teenwitches** (6): little too much nice guy energy

**timothy444** (6): So apparently the band hates this now which I understand since you can't exactly love all your discography as an artist... but why this song in particular? The biggest sin this track has committed is that it's painfully average. They should've just chosen 18 instead which (predicting this comes out higher than 18 btw) if you see my comments, you'd know exactly why I find it baffling

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Anyways um

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (6): see my ‘she looks so perfect’ comment

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): It's a song. It would be a 7 but automatic 2-point deduction for non-ironic reference to the friendzone.

**roboticpandora** (5): Feels a bit low-energy. I think even 15 year old roboticpandora would have wanted a bit more verve.

**runaway3212** (5): this is cute but also boring

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): a friendzone anthem zzzzz

**welcome2thejam** (5): An excruciating matchup between being an incredibly fun, propulsive track vs. 5 Seconds of Summer throwing Nice Guy warning flags all over the place

**bulforster** (4.7): I did not need another treat you better on my radar, at least this one is a bit more of a bop

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): this was very non-descript

**apatel27** (1): A nice guy anthem from this group???

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): you know, this and treat you better make me wonder, how the fuck did Taylor manage to pull off you belong with me decently well and not come off like... this? like on that song Taylor sounds decently charming and sweet, while these guys sound pathetic. who knows, maybe she actually didn't pull it off that well and I'm just a dumb swiftie

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): She’s. Just. Not. That. Into. You.

**seanderlust** (0): you belong with me but make it boring. this isn't worth turning off the feminist brain for sorry

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): I cannot stand this genre of nice guy pop rock, leave it in the last decade please

WHY DO YOU GUYS HATE ROCK SO MUCH?!

THIS SHOULD HAVE WON THE ENTIRE RATE WITH A PERFECT AVERAGE. IT HAS EVERYTHING! ASHTON SINGING, BADASS GUITAR, MENTIONS OF PIZZA, WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU EVER WANT.

This was always going to be included in this rate in some way or another, because in multiple ways, it has stood the test of time. Fans still beg for them to sing it in concerts, and [they even did a rendition of it last year to celebrate their 10 year anniversary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHssx5LgOk). This deserved better in every way and you guys suck for not appreciating it for the genius it is.

**akanewasright** (10): help

**apatel27** (10): 👿🍕

**CarlieScion** (10): high camp

**frogaranaman** (10): camp

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): Simultaneously in S Tier and Everybody Makes Mistakes. Like 5SOS themselves, I must put this song where it belongs.

**roboticpandora** (10): Okay look I listened to a bunch of Hawthorne Heights and Alexisonfire back in the day so I un-ironically love this sound.

**Roxieloxie** (10): i love heavy metal

**seanderlust** (10): this legitimately reminds me of early green day but they're singing about pizza instead of like crystal meth and jerking off

#😘

**plastichaxan** (10): wow what a moment

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): if this had more time to grow on me it could be a 10 tbh

**IIIHenryIII** (9): they were just there outselling OneD

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): So underrated, anything Alex Gasgarth works on you just know is gonna be good

**Verdantshade** (9): dumb ass lyrics but do the verses remind anyone else of mcr's s/c/a/r/e/c/r/o/w or is it just me

**akanewasright** (8): I feel like there’s a decent synchronized swimming routine to be set to this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): the switch on the bridge takes this to the next level, but maybe that’s just my Pavlovian popheads response to hearing a synth

**hhiggy** (8): i despise the "heres to teenage memories" part but the rest is too good

**pig-serpent** (8): I love that the guitars are heavier on this song but that chorus could be better.

**Roxieloxie** (8): ~~this breaking the bop streak of this album~~ nvm i like this now

**twat\_brained** (8): heard this a couple times but never the whole thing. I already mentioned blink-182 but this legit reminds me of Bored to Death and that's a sincere compliment

**you2009** (8): their pleasant voices elevate a lot of these songs. love the production in the bridge

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**TiltControls** (7.5): One more in the title and then we'd have a Cure album

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): one direction did it better

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): it's good, but not great, especially not in comparison to the highs of the album.

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (7): cheers i guess

**wavingwolves** (6.7): kiss you by one direction outsold #sorry

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): kiss you by 1d outsold

**roboticpandora** (6): Wikipedia says this song was co-written by Alex Gaskarth of All Time Low, which makes sense, because it does remind me of the mid tier of 2000s pop punk.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): it's catchy


#😶

**timothy444** (6): very average pop rock song

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): CAN EVERYONE IN THIS RATE STOP FUCKING MILLENIAL WHOOPING

**bulforster** (5.4): on the one hand teenage whininess, on the other a bop

**apatel27** (5): Half sounds like a Taylor song

**ImADudeDuh** (5): kiss you by 1D ended this

**emmaelf** (4.5): very first two 1d albums and i'd rather listen to anything off those

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): the cure outsold

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Teenage memories? Crying and eating shredded cheese watching YouTube alone?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): sixpence none the richer outsold

**Shelly\_AO29** (4): The lyrics are really immature-and not in a charming way-which I don't really vibe with (16 year old me loved it though). The heavy guitar breakdown instead of a bridge is an interesting choice but kind of out of place on a syrupy song about teen love lol.

**runaway3212** (2): maybe this album is bad

This is actually a feminist anthem, let me explain.

The story focuses on a girl that is doing very well for herself by all means necessary, she's doing great at school and seems to excel in multiple activities, seems to be a perfectly "good girl" in the eyes of society, but as the song progresses we find out she isn't only those things, but she's extremely confident and refuses to be pushed inside a label.

The song never actually implies that anything the "bad girl" does is bad, matter fact, those are the words used the girl to describe herself, she's a strong woman that takes the label of "good" and "bad" girl and owns it, wears it with pride. Does having fun and being in a relationship make her a "bad girl", then so be it! She's a well rounded character with more depth than many songs. A perfect tale of the strength of women and how they can be much more than just "good" or "bad". 


---

#good girls

**celladonn** (10): The misogyny really slapped here

**cremeebrulee** (10): maybe it's good i'm hearing this song for the first time now and not at 16 when i would've internalized it too much

**fadedblue09** (10): Another nostalgic bop

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): me a top student from a catholic school: ah yes a song for me >:)

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is the 11 from this album honestly. I heard 5sos for the first time opening for my 1D show and I remember this song live absolutely f u c k e d in a way that shook me to my core, its so delicious

**Shelly\_AO29** (10): Banger. Those lyrics though...5SOS clearly knew their target audience, that's all I'll say.

**twat\_brained** (10): that guitar after the second chorus is KILLER. Also I love that the music video is reminiscent of blink's "Feeling This"

**Verdantshade** (10): I just want to say that the live version slaps so much harder than this abomination of a studio recording but this had me craving for more ashton solos back then

**waluigiest** (10): I didn’t know they still made music like this on 2014 hahahahaha

**GamblesWithDesire** (9): Very fun but also one of the most "pop-punk by the numbers" songs to me.

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): this unlocked memories i forgot i had

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): The way they sing this is kinda… um… flirty 😳

**seanderlust** (8.6): she really said "if you saw me in the library sucking dick no you didn't :heart:" we have no choice but to stan

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): this is the step in between Good Girls Gone Bad and Emo Girl

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): At first I hated the shouty chorus but it really grew on me.

**starlitsuns** (8.5): so this is where the quote that popped up on every ninth grader's instagram page in 2015 came from

**TiltControls** (8.5): This reads like a bad made up reddit post circa 2014. But it's also a bop sooo

**emayzee** (8.4): i kinda hate this trope but i can't make it not bop

**wavingwolves** (8.3): i think if i hadn't seen them performing this live right in front of me i would never like it but since i did see it...

**akanewasright** (8): this girl sounds cool… she deserves a better chorus than this

**PretentiousPegasus** (8): Lyrics aren't as edgy as I thought they were when I was in high school but still a fun upbeat bop

**skargardin** (8): the chorus does slap

**welcome2thejam** (8): Imagine catching your teenage neighbor sneaking out on their roof and she immediately starts philosophizing to you about the duality of man

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**emmaelf** (7.5): this is trash but it's trash i bellow unironically

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): they just called this girl a freak

**bigbigbee** (7): “Truant” is a $100 word in this $5 song

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the anthem for 5SOS to convince themselves to sleep with all the fans

**teenwitches** (7): this is what mgk thinks he sounds like

**timothy444** (7): This is a walking cliché of a song, but hey at least its not a song from "The Vamps"

**wannabemusiccritic** (7): I vividly remember using “good girls are bad girls who haven’t been caught” as an ig caption in middle school and thinking it was sooo clever lmao so embarrassing x

**followingfreeways** (6): honestly this is so sad because i was an OG and the live version was so much better and this never quite grew for me

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I mean, aren't we all good until we get caught doing smth we "shouldn't"

#bad girls

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): this chorus sounds like the new tiktok trend where girls show pictures of them with their diplomas and then it switches to them whipping their bf or sth

**roboticpandora** (6): Never been a fan of those distorted spoken asides that were in every pop punk song from the late 2000s.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.7): god these lyrics

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.5): this is a weezer song (why are the do-do-dos so violent)

**martian\_pet** (5): this is like wattpad, the song

**pig-serpent** (5): There are a lot of good ideas on this song, but little in the way of synergy.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i'm usually not one to hate lyrics bc idc but the whole premise of this song is embarrassing. the WOAHHHH OHHH's save it for me - especially at the end

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I don’t think this was their intention but these lyrics sound like something a creepy uncle would say to you

**you2009** (4): I thought I couldn't get more lesbian and yet

**apatel27** (3): https://imgur.com/kv3iRYl

**bulforster** (3): It's true that you learn best through repetition so I'm not going to forget that good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught... doesn't make for a very good song though

**runaway3212** (3): actually this does nothing for me

**plastichaxan** (2.5): they’re kinda dumb fun but this one is just dumb

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): CHVRCHES outsold. do 2021 electronic pop, coming in may!

**Stryxen** (1): i hate this guy omfg

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (1): this song is about cucking

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (0): oh god no. what the fuck. what the actual fuck are they thinking here. this is garbage! like, complete, unsalvageable garbage. do these guys think they sound cool? because they don't! they sound like massive douchebags who I wanna punch in the face!

DID THE VAMPS PEE ON YOUR TEA OR SOMETHING?!

This is their very first single, written by the guys themselves, and while I do think it sounds very... of its time, I think this is pretty inoffensive and fun. The hook is actually insanely catchy, after this was used in the rate trailer I had it stuck for weeks.

The Vamps are currently in their last straws...... will they even make Day 3? 

---

#she has a wild heart

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): I did this rate to listen to cute, catchy, nostalgic bops! The Vamps might have the worst album here but they got the cutest song!

**bigbigbee** (10): Avicii - Wake Me Up was already a great song and this song basically took that riff and put a different melody on top, and it’s a really good melody, so I like this!!!

**CarlieScion** (10): I 100% thought this was by One Direction back in 2014

**Roxieloxie** (10): THIS IS MY VAMPS 11 I LOVE THIS SONG!!!! This is the only vamps song I knew in 2014 probably, It makes me so happy I just wanna dance around with somebody in a field of flowers while listening. I hope this at least makes top 10 because it absolutely deserves.

**runaway3212** (10): omg lana is that you

**throwaway-7650** (10): in *another world* carly was the ft. here instead of good time

**fadedblue09** (9): I like how the vocalist utters "mine" into like 5 syllables

**ignitethephoenix** (9): okay this is actually pretty good they put their whole Vampussy in this

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9): this whole “she has a wild heart I have a wild heart” it’s giving “when she asked for a banana I was shaking throwing up on the floor. Now I’m like give me a banana too”

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): TONIIGHT WE'LL DAAANCEEE. This song is so fun, I love the campfire vibes it has. The chorus is so explosive in a good way.

**akanewasright** (8.5): SO WAKE ME UP WHEN IT- oh

**cremeebrulee** (8): i got a wild heart too (chronic heartburn)

**emmaelf** (8): this was so overplayed at the time but it's fine on reflection.

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): Very fun.

**PretentiousPegasus** (8): Banger

**seanderlust** (8): this kind of feels like if mumford and sons and train collaborated but I do like it

**skargardin** (8): oh this is cute

**timothy444** (8): Why is this so deep down in the US tracklist when this sounds like a great opener in the UK tracklist? It's literally the best song on this album and despite how cliché the breakdown is in the final chorus (y'know when the instruments all die down for the first half of the final chorus)

**Verdantshade** (8): ho hey it's the obligatory basic bitch song

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): chorus does a lot of hard-carrying here imo but idc, boppy song

**starlitsuns** (7.5): this is getting an extra point from me because the intro sounds a lot like the intro to Avicii's Wake Me Up for some reason, enjoy the extra point The Vamps

**1998tweety** (7): Bleachers washed

**Alumineous** (7): This sounds like this could belong on Four. At this point, I wish this band had more singers because this guy’s voice gets grating after a while.

**bluetriangles04** (7): this one is very tame and inoffensive, and enjoyable without being too forgettable for me

**emayzee** (7): this isn't even the best song called "wild heart" from the year 2014 (that honor goes to bleachers)

**pig-serpent** (7): This one is actually a lot of fun, and I don't even like Mumford or his Sons.

**roboticpandora** (7): “Riptide” vibes

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (7): so wake me up when it’s all over

**bulforster** (6.9): can we dance is entirely pointless when they've already got this in their discog

**hikk** (6.5): this one has a nice chorus ig

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): not that awful

**jasannn** (6.5): why do they do that thing where they cut off the all the production except for some hand claps and percussion and sing in unison in every song?

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): oh hey, it’s a decent song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): cute

**welcome2thejam** (6): Odd case where I hate the chorus except in the climax, where it worked just well enough to move it up a few points. Think its that build-up, flowed better and made it feel earned enough for me to just enjoy the ride, whereas the previous choruses were just dropped upon me after the more minimal verses

#how could you be so heartless

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): this video is…… um…….. i regret watching it

**wavingwolves** (5.8): girl you don't even know her name and you are acting this attached already... mommy issues?

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): they went full yeehaw omg

**apatel27** (5): mid

**twat\_brained** (4): I have never heard another song with Wild in the title so unwild since Wild Horses but that's a classic for a reason

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Moo Moo Farms-ass production

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): “She needs a wild heart / she needs a wild heart / I got a wild heart” okay that’s just lazy

**TiltControls** (3): I'm not a huge fan of the vocals here. Also the song just... isn't all that interesting

**thedoctordances1940** (1.7): please stop this album is torture 🧛😭😭🧛

**ImADudeDuh** (1): Bleachers CLEARED

#beside me<3

**Bordersz** (10): despite the autotune mess, the song is so catchy and well-written.

**CarlieScion** (10): the guitar lead up to the the bridge is HEAVEN

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): while it still feels a bit "young" in term of the band's lifecycle, it feels like a solid indicator of what they were already capable of back then.

**hhiggy** (10): another classic

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): wait this is actually great

**Verdantshade** (10): THE song that made me fall in love with the band - the synths and effects on the album version instantly make it worse than the superior original but the bridge gives me the same kind of energy as heroes in perks of being a wallflower and that's the highest compliment I could ever give a song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): the vocals are amazing

**TiltControls** (9): now this is just a full bop

**wavingwolves** (8.9): this is so sapphic coded wait a second... i see the vision

**poemforsmallthings** (8.2): BESIDEEE CHEWWWW

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is nice

**emmaelf** (7.5): sounds very glee original song but i actually like?

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I enjoyed the guitar solo

**1998tweety** (7): pensive emoji

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): the mellower songs are much better

**emayzee** (7): this is basically thunder by boys like girls but less good

**frogaranaman** (7): this is so me when I'm besides someone

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This has strong *Grey’s Anatomy* commercial energy

**Novuspyra** (7): I'll give it an extra point for being included in one of my writing playlists for an old story.

**roboticpandora** (7): I love the classic emo wail at the end of the chorus, but as a whole the song feels a bit disjointed.

**seanderlust** (7): i am having trouble rating this because so much of this album blurs together and just reminds me of a brief seasonal stint i worked at an american eagle in 2014.

**Shelly\_AO29** (7): Decent ballad, though I always preferred the original version. The production on this version is a little too busy and cluttered.

**twat\_brained** (7): could've been on the b sides but still keeping up the cadence of the album really well

**welcome2thejam** (7): Nice little pop rock ballad

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (7): oh wow

**you2009** (7): something something the girl reading this

**moonagenightmares** (6.6): i appreciate this song being more lowkey because i was starting to get a headache with the way it felt i was listening to one annoying very long song until this point

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): the vocals on the chorus sound like a bad Patrick Stump impression

**akanewasright** (6): why is this giving me “Come Back…Be Here”

**bulforster** (6): decent snow patrol imitation, I'm appreciating something different from them

**throwaway-7650** (6): I was wondering why this song sounded so amateur and... well

**TragicKingdom1** (6): beside yewr >> chonge

#sleeps alone

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I’m bored

**Alumineous** (5): Boring instrumental. But the premise is nice. Talking about a physical distance, like they’re on work travel. Or emotionally. They’re sleeping in the same bed, but there’s like this rift between both of them.

**apatel27** (5): Ed Sheeran vibes

**IIIHenryIII** (5): the thing is, their bad songs aren't essentially bad, they're just there, which doesn't make'em intolerable

**timothy444** (5): you know that South Park episode where Cartman forms a Christian Rock Band except he just grabs other songs and replaces the words girl with God or Jesus? Yeah, apply that here and you get generic Christian rock song #92 lol

**waluigiest** (5): really poor vocals here

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): This sounds like a mediocre to bad early 2000s alternative rock radio hit.

**pig-serpent** (3): Generic bad mid-2000s rock ballad released 10 years too late.

No you know what? Eat shit, this is one of the best songs from their discography and it's not even in the #20? Tasteless, you wouldn't know what a bop is if it hit you in the head. 

For multiple years, this was my answer for "what's your favorite song", alongside Greenlight by them. I almost gave this my 11. This is an integral part of my development and seeing it so low genuinely pains me. Seeing this perish in the 20s while No Control thrives (speculatively) ... I should have just rigged this rate.

#barbie

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Okay this is the kind of silliness that I love, more than any of the other songs in this rate it feels like the nostalgic ‘00s jams these guys are drawing from

**hhiggy** (10): another classic

**Verdantshade** (10): probably aged the best out of all their early songs

**throwaway-7650** (9.7): VIXX barely outsold [stream](https://tinyurl.com/5ex4m77u)

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.5): simp

**bluetriangles04** (9): this one is so boppy and pretty contagious, a solid track that definitely should have had an accompanying music video.

**runaway3212** (9): this metaphor is so funny lowkey, anyway we need the host to play taeyeon to play can't control myself after this.

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (9): maybe this is where we could have seen youngblood coming

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): this is kinda a smasha

**poemforsmallthings** (8): no I get it... it hurts in my head and my heart and my chest and I am having trouble catching my breath

**TiltControls** (8): with a different vibe, this could make a pretty good horror song

**twat\_brained** (8): what a closer! Maybe these guys have always been good and I never gave them much of a chance

**wavingwolves** (7.6): if whoever has my voodoo doll is reading this pls pat their head a little bit i think i deserve that much at least

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the guitar ate here

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): "we have no control at home"

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): Cheeky enough to work, though the verses are really carrying a lot of the weight for me.

**roboticpandora** (7): I really like the drums but everything else is just okay for me.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): Ngl this sounds like a very unpleasant relationship.

**bulforster** (6.5): there's something to be said for forced metaphors like this being p fun substitutes for actual emotional range in songwriting

**1998tweety** (6): VIXX ended them, you can't call your song voodoo doll and then not give me horror vibes.

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): Vixx did it better etc etc

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): not amazing but not bad

#rag doll

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The chorus isn’t as catchy as some of their other songs

**Shelly\_AO29** (5): Catchy but a bit boring.

**timothy444** (5): Not even surprised it's from the B-Side Album because it's very boring and generic despite how cool the title sounds.

**IIIHenryIII** (4.5): another filler, c'mon

**apatel27** (4): Very Disney Original Song vibes

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3.5): I’m not in the camp mood for this song, take me back to that Irish jig music from 1D

**moonagenightmares** (3): i keep checking to see if the song is near the end when its not even halfway over

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (2): I want to kick these guys in the balls

**Stryxen** (2): there’s a note in here that made me literally gag, my body is rejecting this album

#she flies through the room like a big balloon

**babadork** (11): I keep thinking this should have more sexual innuendo.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is literally y/n essence distilled into one song

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): this one is for the girls whose light is as loud as as many ambulances as it takes to save a savior. the bad bitches that float through the room like a big balloon.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): 1D really just shoved the word girl on their songs so we would believe they were straight

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): in year 10 english class my teacher made us do this exercise where we were stranded on a desert island forever and could only pick 5 songs to listen to forever + i had this on my list and when i was reading it out loud the popular girl said "oh i love that song!" and god truly smiled upon me that day

**Roxieloxie** (10): SHEFLOATSTRHOUGHTHEROOMLIKEABIGBALLOONSOMESAYSHESSUCHAFAKETHATHERLOVEISMADEUP SONG WRITERS OF THE GENERATION. THE BEATLES WISH THEY HAD SHIT THIS GOOD. INVENTED FEMINISM ARE YOU KIDDING ME

**starlitsuns** (10): there's something about this that makes me want to dance as if I'm not the girl almighty in this song

**Verdantshade** (10): what does this song even mean? is girl almighty a person? is girl almighty an emotion? is girl almighty a place???? idk but I'd definitely get down on my knees for the boys

**wavingwolves** (10): "i just think women" posts in music form

**Bordersz** (9.5): HEY HEY! This could have been a single too. It is so happy.

**roboticpandora** (9.5): a britpop bop!

**celladonn** (9): So true, her light IS as loud as as many ambulances as it takes to save a savior

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): is this some of the best power pop of the 2010s? Indieheads in shambles

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): I’D GET DOWN ON MY KNEES FOR YOUUUU. Also the thought of 1D getting down on their knees was too much for my teen mind to comprehend.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Great production on this. If you told me blind beforehand that this was an underrated indie pop rock gem from that era I'd prob believe you

**throwaway-7650** (8.8): the way this isn't the only song in the rate about giving head

**moonagenightmares** (8.2): #yasss #feminism

**twat\_brained** (8): it's only fair, how many times have you boys made me drop to my own knees in hysterics?

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (8): being a fob fan prepared me for this

**you2009** (8): my brothers in christ...

**akanewasright** (7.5): this one feels a bit less… complete than a lot of the other songs

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): good but it kinda stalls and starts repeating itself

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**emmaelf** (7): please do get down on your knees for me and then go to a better 1d song.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): oh genius says they mean get down on their knees as in prayer and/or proposal... yeah thats where my mind went...

**runaway3212** (7): this isn't that interesting

**poemforsmallthings** (6.8): "her light is as loud as as many ambulances as it takes to save a savior" makes sense don't worry about it

**TiltControls** (6.5): is this in the same universe as bruce and evan almighty

**Alumineous** (6): Definitely peppier. I like the clapping sounds, the guitar, and the drums. Good job backing band for saving the song!

#she's such a fake, her love's made up

**seanderlust** (6): "shit we still have two more minutes of song to fill??? uhhh idk just like...have someone else sing the first verse ig"

**timothy444** (6): Alright, but a bit boring

**martian\_pet** (5.5): beliebers rise up

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Some more Lumineers energy on this song.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): pretty forgettable

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Something feels… off. There’s a good song in here buried amongst the obnoxiousness

**IIIHenryIII** (4): sounds just like any other track from the album

**thedoctordances1940** (2.3): 😭😭😭

**apatel27** (2): Thought the song built to the final chorus but that was only 1:30 in, then the song just repeated

**Stryxen** (2): idk its a bad song! It’s a mess!

**bulforster** (1.5): This could really use an actual chorus

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): I know boy band lyrics are supposed to be little silly but like this is nonsense

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1): annoying af, also i deducted at least 3 points for that ambulances line alone

**PretentiousPegasus** (0): This song is so annoying I'm sorry

**cremeebrulee** (10): BOP!!!!!!

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): this song, Long Way Home, and She Looks So Perfect are in a 3-way tie for my favorite on the album. This song should've been a live staple for them.

**hhiggy** (10): underrated

**throwaway-7650** (10): "I'm a 6/she's a 10" beside you to end up here in the tracklist

**TiltControls** (10): The way my favourite 5sos and Vamps songs reference much better songs yet are still 10s

**Verdantshade** (10): I am of the opinion that the alex gaskarth collabs were the very best songs 5sos ever wrote. it's such a fucking dumb cheesy song but the energy and tension is unparalleled and honestly how many other songs capture that feeling of being an awkward 14 year old and having a girlfriend?

**waluigiest** (10): oh? You like my Coldplay shirt?

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): almost gave this my 11 but i know everyone will sleep on this song

**1998tweety** (9): absolute bop

**twat\_brained** (8.6): how did Luke keep his vocal cords intact after recording this? Also nice Bon Jovi reference

**roboticpandora** (8.5): The chorus sounds so earnest I can't help but love it, even though they're saying "Cobain" kinda weird.

**skargardin** (8): finally some good food

**timothy444** (8): Someone is definitely going to be commenting about the vocals in the chorus, more likely in a negative way but personally I love it and I think it adds personality to the song.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): My favorite songs in this rate are the ones that make me forget, if just for a moment, that I’m listening to boy bands

**bulforster** (7.6): the album really just needed to be a bunch of upbeat pop punk songs with drive like this one

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Sounds like the kind of song I imagine Machine Gun Kelly is writing about Megan Fox, but it gets good once the bridge hits.

**Alumineous** (7): Finally, y’all SPICED up the instrumental. Premise is simple… bar hookups which is a very common theme in this rate LOL. It’s stupid how this even needs to be said, but I like how the girl made the first move.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): the lyrics to this one are very teenager-in-2014 but that's what they were going for so good job 5sos

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): the energy is fun but the vocals don’t really match it for me, and the Livin On a Prayer reference draws an eyeroll

**apatel27** (6): Imagine getting with someone that mixes up Bon Jovi and Kurt Cobain. Disgusting

**IIIHenryIII** (6): oh yeah, Livin' on a Prayer, my favorite Nirvana song

**ImADudeDuh** (6): me asking how clicking a 1950s style ad for pop led me here

**wannabemusiccritic** (6): I used to like this song but after listening to it today, I’m like “it’s really not that good” lol x

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (6): LIVING ON A PRAYER???

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): the Coldplay shirt is a warning for something else average and boring that’s gonna happen if you go with him

**thedoctordances1940** (5.2): it's just so mid

**akanewasright** (5): “you love that song about living on a prayer” girl it’s called living on a prayer it’s not that hard

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This sounds like an AI generated pop punk song.

**emmaelf** (5): i'd rather just listen to that song about living on a prayer

**Stryxen** (5): the way this song would be good with even just like… okay vocals

**welcome2thejam** (5): The love interest mistaking a Nirvana shirt for Bon Jovi is a super fun detail but I don't know if it makes for a good chorus that repeats like three to four times

**fadedblue09** (4): Would like this more if the chorus was less shouty

**pig-serpent** (4): I've been thinking this whole album sounds like Boys like Girls but this song is literally just The Great Escape.

**seanderlust** (4): "my name? oh it's Trouble" is she out of your league? because she sounds so cringey sdklfj

**you2009** (4): ok feminism

**Shelly\_AO29** (3): Not a fan of Michael's shouty vocals in the chorus. Also, the song is just mind-numbingly boring.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): this just sounds... bad

#gold

**bluetriangles04** (11): this song brings me straight to my tumblr days and all of the fanfics that are buried deep down in the crevices of my mind begin to bleed out... but beyond that it's also a beautiful song in general and I can relate to the feelings of being wrapped around someone else's finger no matter what they do. It's also one of the frequent additions to my playlist whenever I'm upset and I decide to make a playlist to wallow in my feelings just a little longer.

**akanewasright** (10): this kinda sounds like it would fit on that aly & aj album with the obscenely long acronym… except better???

**CarlieScion** (10): when I was like 16?? I read a 5sos fanfic centered around this song and then when I tried to find it again a year or so later it was completely wiped from ao3 and the rest of the internet. Rip fools gold 5sos fanfic u were too good for this world

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): Truly a stunning song that I legit use to show people that 1D wasn't just a cheesy boy band, but a group capable of writing and performing truly incredible, heartfelt songs. However, I think Fool's Gold (Niall's Version) might edge it out a bit for me now.

**hhiggy** (10): cant believe 2014 me used to not like this

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): oh my gawd....the emotion in their voices ughhh i died

**Roxieloxie** (10): they put everything they fucking had into this god, nialls spotify session of this >>>>

**runaway3212** (10): fool's gold is still pretty idc

**skargardin** (10): Oh wow this really is an 11 contender

**Verdantshade** (10): this is the boys at their very best, the songwriting is just soppy enough to break every teenage girl's heart without being cliched, all five actually get their moments to shine, and it's just one of those ballads that they do best

**wavingwolves** (10): UNDERRATED! including by me! i'm so sorry niall but you ate in this and i see it now that i'm older & can appreciate the quietness of the feelings this expresses

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): i may be ballad-phobic but not with this song

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): one of their best deep cuts!

**synchronisedchaos** (9): now wonder niall still plays this

**timothy444** (9): One of the more complex 1D songs on here, and the lyrics are really good.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**frogaranaman** (8): this hits so much harder now that I've actually been in love once before

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I can’t believe they had the audacity to release this just a scant year after Victoria Justice dropped “Gold”

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): someone tell me why this song wasn't in a big coming of age movie in the dramatic breakup scene

**twat\_brained** (8): this, Golden, Harry seems to like gold.

**throwaway-7650** (7.7): I'd love a cover of this song sung by aly & AJ (pre11y places!)

**seanderlust** (7.5): I know it's a boy band album so it's not that deep but still these metaphors...(jay-z voice) what do these things all have in common?

**Novuspyra** (7): Honestly, this song's a 5, maybe a 6, but Niall covered it in his solo tour so it gets a plus one for me lmao

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): It's a good song but extremely overrated

**roboticpandora** (7): I feel like there's a really good, interesting song buried in here, it's just gotten drowned out by the kind of generic chorus.

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (7): popheads rate heartbreak weather challenge! impossible!

#fools

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): the vocals on this just feel a bit too understated for the production

**apatel27** (6): It's a nice melody, if only it wasn't another uwu i want to be your bf song

**emmaelf** (6): i want to love 1d ballads but i just can't. it's not me, it's absolutely them.

**Shelly\_AO29** (6): A nice ballad but not their best, as it feels quite uninspired. Their vocals sound really nice, though.

**TiltControls** (6): A little forgettable stuck in the middle of the album like this

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Looking desperately for a hook in this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I wish this was either more gold or more foolish.

**jasannn** (5): I was going crazy for 5 minutes trying to find out what the first verse sounded like. It was Safe & Sound by Taylor. Thanks Twitter

**pig-serpent** (5): Very sappy for my tastes but it's not a bad song, especially compared a lot of the competition.

**Bordersz** (4.5): Meh.

**bulforster** (3.6): These lyrics are so non-specific... I'd like to say the girl is the personification of global capitalism or something but the song is too boring for that.

**Alumineous** (3): Could have been a beautiful song. Had so much potential. But the chorus wasn’t hitting, and the chorus is like the majority of the song. The backing band did their thing. Oh, and Niall sounds beautiful.

**IIIHenryIII** (3): "I can't sleep", play your own song… that might help

**thedoctordances1940** (2.8): George Ezra but bad. So George Ezra.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): one of the most boring ballads in the rate

**Stryxen** (1): snooze gold

**CarlieScion** (11): I can’t give disconnected my 11 but this is basically disconnected 2.0 so its fine < 3

**Alumineous** (10): I actually love the premise. Wasting time with someone else and just doing random shit is really fun. Holy shit, this is the plot of Starstruck, my favourite DCOM movie.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): I love this song top to bottom and there's not much more I want to say about it tbh.

**Verdantshade** (10): random tangent but when I was 14 I had this 8 song playlist of run by snow patrol, last night on earth by green day, passenger seat by dcfc, just watch the fireworks by jew, this song, vegas skies by the cab, hnscc by the 1975, and a sky full of stars by coldplay and it was such a VIBE just thinking about running away and driving around all night looking at the stars.. but yeah this song encapsulates that feeling for me and I know it's super cliche but there really isn't anything more romantic than taking the long way home just to spend time with someone you love

**akanewasright** (9): Every now and then I hear a song and think “the writers were on autopilot, they wanted to go home early and just did the first thing that came to mind” and within 3 plays I adore that song. What I’m saying is this song is a deliciously clichéd

**cremeebrulee** (9): let's get lost?!?!

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): Ultimate summer road trip song

**Roxieloxie** (9): its cute i cant be mad at it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): obsessed w this chorus

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Would make a good summer throwback track

**TiltControls** (8.5): 400 Lux (pop remix)

**2dina3dworld** (8): me after I accidentally get on the wrong bus and end up at the airport again

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (8): see this is a normal love song! Was it hard!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.7): idk why I like this in particular, it must have familiar chords or something

**bulforster** (7.5): we want let's get lost as the interlude for this bop!

**moonagenightmares** (7.3): when i heard the green day mention suddenly a lot of things made sense

**poemforsmallthings** (7.2): me when I want to ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright

**1998tweety** (7): Me when I get off the bus a stop early so I can walk a little bit.

**apatel27** (7): Is this teenage dirtbag

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Baby, let’s go get lost!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): they’re so much better when they’re not shouting the entire song (I am currently hosting a punk rock rate, don’t @ me)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): It’s not “Let’s Get Lost” by Carly Rae Jepsen but it’s cute, wish they didn’t SCREAM half the WORDS in the CHORUS like that though

**IIIHenryIII** (7): the chorus melody is kinda neat

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): what teen movie is this from

**twat\_brained** (7): that's a weird snare. Also "kyaraseen"? ha. Nice Melbourne accent Calum. What's damning to me is this is such a filler track yet it's still better than like ¾ of the Vamps album

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): A pretty average pop punk song… Of course, to me an “average” pop punk song is still pretty good!

**wavingwolves** (6.9): pleasant

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): this is a watered-down version of empire state of mind

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): the beat is kinda a worse version of OneRepublic’s Good Life but the chorus is nice until the millennial whoops come in

**frogaranaman** (6): google maps options like

**roboticpandora** (6): Hmmm a little too OneRepublic.

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): Carly did it better, but we already knew that

**timothy444** (6): 2average4me

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): it's there but they've made this song like 4 times already

**pig-serpent** (3): I'm fairly sure I've heard a different song that sounds exactly like this before then forgot what it was because it wasn't a great song to begin with.

**Shelly\_AO29** (1): Everything about this song is so generic. Some of these songs seriously needed to be left out of the album. Second time on this album a lyric about "owning this town" has shown up.

**Roxieloxie** (10): Ricki i owe you my life for putting this in

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): top 5 in their discography no arguments allowed

**bigbigbee** (9): Ugh this is so good! I was disappointed to learn that this was only a bonus track!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I’m a sucker for songs about comparing life to traditional dramatic structures

**Shelly\_AO29** (9): Why are these bonus songs better than some of the songs on their debut album.

**CarlieScion** (8): now why did they not edit out the breaths between each line??? Where did the budget go sdfknjdsfknsdf

**skargardin** (8): this chorus reminds me so much of justin bieber's baby for some reason

**roboticpandora** (7.5): I’ve never really liked the “our life’s a movie” concept, but this song is saved for me by the bass line in the bridge and the driving chorus.

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): girl... what in the P!ATD album/song title

**wavingwolves** (7.1): i think i've seen this film before / and i didn't like the ending + the script was written and i could not change a thing / i want to rip it all to shreds and start again = the chorus for this song

**GamblesWithDesire** (6): I like the chorus well enough and the guitar riff too, but the verses don't stand out at all for me.

**synchronisedchaos** (6): the way I had an entire movie planned for this

**bluetriangles04** (5): kind of sounds like a song in a 2000s coming of age film during a montage

**TiltControls** (5): this is the songification of the point in every disney show when they do a 'Let's go to Hollywood' episode

**IIIHenryIII** (2): actually, it's suffering on my headset

Well, there goes the lead single off this album lol.

I mean, I guess I get why people are more underwhelmed by it in hindsight, given that the true fan favorites lie on the album tracks, but I really thought the fact that this was a big release would help it,,, and perhaps it did and this would have gone at like #32 if it wasn't one, but whatever, this song gave us the Danny Devito music video and I can't be too angry at anything that gives us something like that.



---

#the stealers

**waluigiest** (11): suddenly I understand the appeal of y/n

**Alumineous** (10): A great intro track. But it only goes downhill from here.

**cremeebrulee** (10): the slight misogyny gives it flavor

**emayzee** (10): this is making me miss the days where the one guarantee in life was that every year we'd get a 1D lead single in the late summer and an album every november :////

**emmaelf** (10): the music video! (am I dreaming the monkey and the sumo wrestlers?) and an absolute bop to open an album

**frogaranaman** (10): can't believe this rate starts with one of the songs of all time

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of the best songs in the rate, haven’t been able to stop listening to this

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i don’t cause im gay

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): my elementary school self really thought this song was about her

**runaway3212** (10): danny devito was the director im blaming him for the cultural appropriation

**skargardin** (10): but oh wow what a throwback

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): god the absolute GRIP this song had on me when it came out. v strong 11 contender

**TiltControls** (10): why are they worried about the other couple billion in the world stealing their girl when they've each got to compete with the other 4 international superstars right there?!?! (unless this is a poly thing in which case good for them)

**timothy444** (10): I love how cute this opening track is and its still an amazing bop after all these years.

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): .1 point off for the music video another .1 point off for feminism, now that thats out of the way I bully this song but it fucks my god

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): EVERYBODY WANNA STEAL MY GIRL! EVERYONE WANNA TAKE HER HEART AWAY! i maintain this is bottom 2 on the album but idk why i always skipped it when listening to this, it’s a banger

**wavingwolves** (9.1): thinking back on how much i hated this song and even thought it to be somehow sexist just to come around it and start loving it as i grew older and just let it be the silly pop song it's trying to be. also the synths are so nice!!! and it has a painfully corny music video that feels like a fever dream to top it off

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): himbo Billy Joel song

**ignitethephoenix** (9): haters back off from their girl!!

**starlitsuns** (9): I don't think any of you know about the 7TV carJAM emote but needless to say I was doing my best impersonation of that emote listening to this

**jasannn** (8.3): Why does this feel like a kpop disbandment song?

**2dina3dworld** (8): can’t relate, they can’t steal what I don’t have <3

**akanewasright** (8): you’re telling me this was the lead single when no control was there? Like… okay this is good too but come on

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): That piano line in the verses is giving me some life ngl.

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): Down a point because Niall gets one line and its filler

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (8): the tags for this song on lastfm are wild…

**babadork** (7.7): In their defense, I don’t know that I would rate “Faithfully” much higher than this.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): who let Frank Reynolds in a One Direction video

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): I remember EXACTLY where I was when this came out CTFU

**Bordersz** (7.5): Zayn’s high notes during the bridge/post-bridge saved the song from being a mid-song. He slid on the first verse.

**throwaway-7650** (7.3): not the MV being their anime girl moment (edit: ?? me ????)

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): This song was the worst choice for a first single and the video is a choice but damn if it ain't catchy as shit whenever it comes on.

**PretentiousPegasus** (7): Faithfully and It's Not Your Fault with worse lyrics. Good job Zayn's high note saves it

**Verdantshade** (7): basic ass lead single with godawful mixing (still bops tho)

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): a lil bit possessive innit?

**martian\_pet** (6.5): cute bop, straight tiktok would've ate this up had it come out today

**1998tweety** (6): bops a bit, I personally don't really care for the overly possessive lyrics but I get why teenage girls in particular would like them

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): fine arena rock sound, not crazy about the lyrics

**pig-serpent** (6): The chorus comes together nicely but they clearly didn't have an idea with what to do for the verses or the bridge.

**roboticpandora** (6): I added a point because Danny Devito is indeed the greatest artist of his generation. But that piano riff is just as cheesy here as it was on "Faithfully."

**seanderlust** (6): this is fine, but i do have to admit that the white panda mashup of this and anna sun washes it a bit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blvKBu2WHKU

#the girl that got stolen

**jackisboredtoday** (5.7): I actually like the piano/drums combo on this a lot but the chorus here is just not very good

**bigbigbee** (5.5): “whole wide world” might be one of my most hated cliché space-filling lyrics ever. This reminds me of songs I like (mostly ones that my parents played a lot when I was a kid) but this doesn’t reach the level of A Song I Like

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): Ray Romano outsold

**apatel27** (5): Got to give them credit for making the melody for the dads

**xX\_CrimsonROSET\_Xx** (5): i was gonna have a comment about the lyrics but i actually am going to defend the video for this because I find that a bunch of different people coming together to appreciate each others’ artistry in its many forms is such a feel good thing and the scenes that take the most advantage of this are some of the best in this rate but like the song is garbage so idk why they did it

**thedoctordances1940** (4.2): it's just so

**bulforster** (4): Why is this production so lumbering and soulless??

**Shelly\_AO29** (4): Worst 1D single imo. Also the ‘na na na na’ trend was very played out by the time they released this and I was SICK of it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): It sounds so promising in the first few measures… and then they dial the annoying knob WAAAAY up

**fadedblue09** (3): Ugh this song gives me nightmares

**Novuspyra** (3): IIRC this song made it into the 1D Top Ten Pop Ten and I can't for the life of me figure out why. In an album full of bops and jams, this is just bland.

**poemforsmallthings** (3): this might be one of the worst lead single choices ever made

**moonagenightmares** (2): the soundtrack to a het love, simon
