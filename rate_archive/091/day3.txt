MrSwearword: King Princess needs to withstand 2 chops to make it into the top 10...

PLACE YOUR BETS NOW. Does King Princess sneak her way into the Top 10 or nah?

cubascastrodistrict: Honestly I think she probably does. Hit The Back is a good song even as someone who doesn‚Äôt like King Princess, and usually there‚Äôs one song from each album that gets a bunch of 11s and HTB is probably that song.

This song was robbed from the album. The Raw EP was a great project, and it feels like her team payed it dust. This is definitely one of her best songs.

---

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i wish this was on the album instead of level up

**ManofOranges** (10): This one is such a banger I wish it were on the album.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): justice for high five, it should‚Äôve been in the album

**Stryxen** (10): probably Sigrid's best, deserved to be her breakout hit over str\*ngers

**turtle-thief** (10): How is that chorus humanly possible? idk but it sounds divine.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Big bop

**ReallyCreative** (9): A fun one for sure

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Listening to this somehow brought back the painful memory of when I was a freshman in high school and gave a high five to a random person I didn‚Äôt know who was actually trying to get one from someone behind me and then I was laughed at

**skargardin** (9): Major bop alert!

**bespectacIed** (8): To the rate hosts, y'all couldn't have included Schedules from the Raw EP, like damn??? This song is also cute but Schedules is so much better

**nooodisaster** (8): Catchy and reflective.

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): Sigrid really is the queen of great pre-choruses

**vayyiqra** (8): I taste some avocadies in this but also I like this a lot, even if it's kind of like a rough draft to "Don't Kill My Vibe". [edit: She did the "hey!" thing again, dammit now I have to increase the score.]

**nick1372** (7): lights on, they all go hoom

**WeastofEden44** (7): This is cute if a little generic. It sounds like that song from every inspirational commercial for the first half and then pops off during the second half

**wavingwolves** (4): sigrid is very cute, i'll give you that, but this does nothing for me

Lyrically this is pretty good, and fairly complex. It's also one of the most detailed choruses in the rate, with a great instrumental too.

---

**letsallpoo** (11): one time a boy took too long to text me back and when i listened to this song i instantly went into a depressive spiral

**therokinrolla** (11): this song kinda changed my life "people change overnight" has haunted me for over a year tbh

**1998tweety** (10): Fuck me this chorus is so good I feel it in my whole body.

**bespectacIed** (10): Holy moses this is an amazing song, makes me cry a lil. I fall in love with the  harmonies on the second chorus, every single time

**CarlieScion** (10): BUT IF U LIE TO ME!!!! IM GONE

**DaHumanTorch** (10): one of my favorites on the album. i love maggie‚Äôs lyricism so much

**flutemytoot** (10): And I wooonderifistilllivedinthecitywouldiseeyouatapartytakeabigsipofmywhiskeyandthenleave quickly üò´üò´

**ManofOranges** (10): Didn't like this song at first but it's really come to grow on me.

**mudkip1** (10): jesus i love maggie

**nick1372** (10): Best white girl sing-rapping since Ed Sheeran

**redgold51** (10): Best song on the album

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I absolutely love the verses in this

**WeastofEden44** (10): This hits too much, especially with everything going on right now. Like she really described my life huh

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): this production is soooo good I love the backing vocals too much for words

**Arybeck67** (9): the fucking bridge on this track, with the frog noise samples...this is a queen of nature üå≤

**nooodisaster** (9): You literally DONT fuck w Greg Kurstin, he is one of the greatest living pop producers & the gp sleeps on that. Combine that with Maggie's production & this is an infectious bop. P.S. "I'm still here... and I must still be high",  what a line.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): i love the theme of the song

**Awkward\_King** (8): why does it sound like a weird purring shrilling every few seconds of the chorus tho

**kappyko** (7): overrated by my fellow maggie maggots but hey what can you do

**Roxieloxie** (7): being at home has made me see so many commercials so im very sorry when i say that this song sounds alot like underdog by alicia keys

**Stryxen** (7): I love the little "aaa"s after each line in the chorus

**vayyiqra** (7): It's kind of a bop, but also more importantly i love the lyrics to this so much. People do change, which is such a simple thing yet we have so much trouble understanding it.

**cubascastrodistrict** (6): I feel like the melody on this one is a little clunky. I like parts of the song, but when she gets to the ‚Äúlie to me‚Äù hook it loses me a bit. Still a nice tune, but could‚Äôve used some more polish.

**JulioGrandeur** (5): sandwiched between two really great songs

The first of the four Mag songs that mean a lot to me personally. The album HIIAPL came out at a firly pivotal time for me, between my college graduation and first post-education full-time job. The stress I was under at that time was, to put it lightly, a lot. So this whole album means a lot to me. Burning is speacial because it's just a fast paced, cathatic release of a track, and the refrain "I'm in love, I'm alive, oh I'm burning" I might eventually get a tattoo of I love so much.

---

**kappyko** (11): i cried to this song lol

**untutorable** (11): she's a bop your honor

**CarlieScion** (10): this just feels so DAMN freeing !!!!

**flutemytoot** (10): such good vibes üò≠ need me a man to wake and break and open me up

**ManofOranges** (10): Something about this song really just does it for me, it's certainly a standout out in my eyes.

**mudkip1** (10): a surprise bop

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i would not mind being set on fire to this song

**TinosCallingMeOver** (10): Hot damn this is such a good song. My favourite part is the 'you-ou-ou-ou's in the pre-chorus. Play it in the car on loud.

**turtle-thief** (10): Being in love has never sounded better.

**walkedoffanoldme** (10): my go-to song to convert my friends to maggie stans

**1998tweety** (9.5): Mega bop chorus, I applaud her ability to make different sounding songs that all fit cohesively on the same album.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): ugh i want to experience this feeling :/ this song is so good though, wish i could relate to it

**nick1372** (9): My fav production of hers but also what the fuck is she saying in the chorus

**nooodisaster** (9): The "you ooh ooh ohh"s, the "ah-\_-uh\_-\_ah"s, the beat, bro. This song is STACKED with hooks. And the emotion is strong too, just simply being in love.

**shesdoingyoga** (8): Another overall good song with a chorus that falls slightly flat, she starts the chorus with power but the rest of the chorus doesn‚Äôt match that power

**Arybeck67** (7): tbh, it‚Äôs a great song, but I‚Äôm honestly bored by it in comparison with more inventive tracks

**vayyiqra** (7): Also kind of mid-tier but mid on this album means above average so it kind of bops.

**Stryxen** (6.5): makes me want to burn things

**bespectacIed** (3): I know that metal percussions are such a Maggie signature production but ughh I really don't care for it :/ This is a song that I felt like I've heard already .... in this same album ... and also in Chvrches - Clearest Blue

TragicKingdom1: i'm gonna double check but i BELIEVE that King Princess only needs to make it to #8 to avoid setting the record for earliest elimination of an artist in a 3-album rate

I THINK the previous record holder was Charli XCX in *Night Time, My Time* vs. *Days Are Gone* vs. *True Romance* with "You (Ha Ha Ha)" out at #9 but i will verify now

edit: i have verified. my instincts were correct

This feels like the most "standard" Adult Contemporary song Magggie has released. She's pretty decent at it too. If she wants to go more in this direction in another album, I'd be okay with that.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh I love this

**ManofOranges** (10): Very catchy and just really nice to listen to.

**redgold51** (10): Sweet, folky fun

**TinosCallingMeOver** (10): Warm, glowy, like a mug of hot chocolate at the beginning of autumn. I'm gonna love this for a long time.

**xaviersi** (10): This song is the epitome of love at first sight. That eagerness to please them, attract them to you, and essentially make them your partner forever. Before you see the faults, before you know how they are as an actual partner. All you have is this yearning and naive optimism. Possibilities endless. Definitely encapsulates the raw energy of love that often ends up being bogged down by realities and societal pressure. Perfect.

**skargardin** (9): I like this way more than some of her album cuts!

**wavingwolves** (9): weirdly this song makes me think of taylor and i would love to see her take on it

**rickikardashian** (8.5): this feels like a song that would be played in a romcom

**bespectacIed** (8): cute but mariah - i'll be loving you long time outsold

**DaHumanTorch** (8): i love this song, i hope her next album continues in this direction

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This is good but sounds like she‚Äôs trying for a more mainstream sound?  Which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing in general but I would prefer the sound of the album over this

**waluigiest** (8): feels like a romantic august

**WeastofEden44** (8): A springtime bop

**nooodisaster** (7): I was legit surprised this wasn't a cover of some 70s song. Can kinda tell why they prioritized other songs for the album than this tho.

**Stryxen** (7): cute <3 and catchy

**vayyiqra** (5): Kind of mom-pop, but it's not awful.

It's only fair that this goes out right after Burning. If Burning is the climactic release of the album, Back In My Body is the comedown from that high. As I moved hlalfway across the country with this song album as my biggest comfort, this song was a release. I succeeded at my current short term goals, and despite the stress, I was better than ever. This song served as a huge reminder for that, and is a fitting conclusion to one of my favorite albums of 2019.

---

**1998tweety** (11): Good Lorde now THIS is how you end an album. The lyrics on this song are incredible, the slow build-up, every little detail adds so much. My fav part is the very ending, I feel like I was trapped under ice and I'm suddenly feeling a surge towards the surface as life and air rushes back into my body. Truly an out of body experience.

**nick1372** (11): when the guitars come in after the second chorus, that's when you know you've transcended

**WeastofEden44** (11): I connect with this song so deeply. I have a history of depression and do actually tend to dissociate, so the times I do feel "in" my body are so valuable to me. This song describes the feeling so well and I just needed to say that.

**Arybeck67** (10): a great closer goddammit about fighting for yourself and her the add-one she adds to the chorus each time, just perfect

**bespectacIed** (10): So, fucking, anthemic. One of the best songs in the album and this rate. It feels like a taylor swift/florence and the machine/phil collins song in a good way. The drums, the harmonies, that thundering chorus, the guitar bridge, the fucking lyrics??? The line "This time I know I'm back in my body" kinda makes me ascend to a higher plane of existence ... i love this song goddamn it, what a perfect album closer. This is an 11, this should win.

**CarlieScion** (10): I LOVE!!!!! dramatic swelling SONGS!!!!!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The verses on this are the best part of the album.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): she snapped

**kappyko** (10): i'll cry to this song in the future lol

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): an 11

**turtle-thief** (10): A power ballad done right.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): Love this track as a closer, powerful shit

**nooodisaster** (9): Probably my favorite lyrics of the album. Also one of the only entirely self-written songs on the album. Hmmm....

**shesdoingyoga** (9): A strong ending to the album

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): such a good closer!!

**mrmeepz** (8.5): Pretty epic way to end the album. Also, yes guitar solo please

**ManofOranges** (8): This song very much describes how my soul had left my body and I had dissociated into the third person while listening to this album it was very ethereal but now with this song my soul reenters my body and much like with this song I'm a little disappointed but whatever.

**vayyiqra** (8): I love this kind of atmospheric mid-tempo synthpop ballad and the backing vocals remind me of Lights song "Muscle Memory" which is one of my favourite songs ever so this is really hitting for me. A very good closing track that ties together all the themes of the album and gives them a solid grounding.

**Stryxen** (7): I'm literally in a film thanks Maggie

**TinosCallingMeOver** (7): Still a good track but just do as much for me as most of the rest of the album.

**DaHumanTorch** (6): i didn‚Äôt love the first few choruses but the final chorus was great. overall though, while i liked it a lot lyrically it sonically wasn‚Äôt there for me compared to the rest of the album

I can see why this is KP's most well know hit. It seems like it has the most radio-friendly production, and can unfortunately be misinterpreted as a stright song.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Ha best song

**CarlieScion** (10): if this doesnt win the bonus rate then popheads have no taste and also hate lesbians

**DaHumanTorch** (10): better than anything on the album, whoops

**flutemytoot** (10): this has been her no. 1 song on spotify for 14 years and honestly I can't be mad because it's amazing.......I just wish Cheap Queen got more credit

**nick1372** (10): the metaphors... the creativity... all years other than 1950 have been cancelled

**nooodisaster** (10): Her best. The first verse alone makes me feel warm and cuddly but also sad and gay like?? her power.

**skargardin** (10): This is THE tea, what a debut single and it remains her best song yet.

**Stryxen** (10): well this is obviously gonna do well on popheads

**wavingwolves** (10): this would be my 11 in the rate if it was featured on kp's album. i love the concept of it

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): It's a little reserved but I really dig the way this song is constructed, a classic

**Arybeck67** (9.3): the one good King Princess song.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Even though I had some issues with her album being slower and lower energy, this song is actually executed well

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9): A classic!

**waluigiest** (9): her best tracks are in the bonus rate tbh

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): I still love this song

**Awkward\_King** (8): all of kp's bonus songs are getting mega high scores from me they all mean a lot to me ahaha

**bespectacIed** (8): She wants to role-play segregation and LGBT persecution, she's cancelled

**Roxieloxie** (7): like yes gay rights its cute but I still dont get the "i like it when we play 1950" dose she mean the year??? the decade?? Like all those post that are like "I miss the 50's" with like pics of greaser boys and dinners and milkshakes. Like that heteronormativity aesthetic??? the longer and the wishing that sapphic love would be norrmalised like that??? Which i mean i guess its cute but im not white so "playing" 1950 would be alot less fun

**vayyiqra** (3): The title is fitting given how hard she tries to sound retro on this, but also that doesn't mean I like it. It's bland af.

**ManofOranges** (2): I can't do it! I just can't! I just do not like this song!

This is the second of two Sigrid songs I think sounds like Christmas music. Most of Sigrid energetic bops made it to day 3, and for good reason. I also love it when songs like this are upbeat, even when the contents are sad. It can really heighten the meaning.

---

**cremeebrulee** (11): cured my depression!!! ugh idk who to give my 11 so i just gave it to one of sigrd's 10s lol

**rickikardashian** (11): that "it hasn't hit me yet, and I know if I get home I'm gonna get upset" hook might be one of the most effective parts of any songs I've ever heard.

**CarlieScion** (10): no more sad songs by litte mix 2.0 but it bops harder

**DaBigBoi** (10): Ended rapping careers perry yacht.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i love this song so so much. one of my go to songs to lift my spirits and put me in a good mood. the talking bit goes off. i always thought it was ‚Äúi know i fuck around when i get upset‚Äù but i looked up the lyrics and apparently it isn‚Äôt??? i‚Äôm a tad shook

**kappyko** (10): GREATEST SONG EVER RECORDED

**ReallyCreative** (10): Yes ma'am I'll take another bop if you got it

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I forget that this song is under 3 minutes because unlike a lot of other short songs, this one doesn‚Äôt feel like it is missing anything.  The pre-chorus is objectively the best part

**skargardin** (10): Another strong contender for my 11 but alas. It still absolutely deserves top five and NOTHING less.

**TinosCallingMeOver** (10): 'It hasn't hit me yet, but I know if I go home I'm going to get upset' so relatable. Also a great track.

**turtle-thief** (10): Those strings...

**vayyiqra** (10): I forget just how much I love this song until I hear that white-girl-spoken-word "it hasn't hit me yet" part and I am powerless before that vocal style. Also, [2] to these lyrics.

**WeastofEden44** (10): I wish that I was this emotionally intelligent but alas I'm just a stupid needy bottom lmao

**therokinrolla** (9): with a different vocal topline this would be a GFRIEND song

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is a bigger bop than I remember it being...

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Resilient queen. Also, the bridge makes me drop and twerk.

**Roxieloxie** (8): i'l give this credit for being sorta uptempo with a title like this

**Stryxen** (8): I'm so thankful for ms sigrid she just makes me happy

**waluigiest** (8): reminds me of the Jess Glynne rate

**Arybeck67** (7.3): I like the positive message of this song, but again, it‚Äôs really forgettable

**Awkward\_King** (7): sis i canNOT relate hayfever season *has* hit me yet

**nick1372** (7): wow congrats you're not depressed

**bespectacIed** (6): Cute, sounds very 2012

**mrmeepz** (6): Cool vocal melody, but I dislike the usage of strings here

**ManofOranges** (5): First song that doesn't really do it for me on this album. It just feels off.

Another sad bop, though this one kind of has a happy undertone in the short term. There's just something so great and tight about Sigrid's poppiest songs, and it takes some interesting lyrical turns.

---

**plantp0wer** (11): this song is so euphoric, it genuinely makes me feel better about worries about the future because we‚Äôre living right now! Such a catchy and explosive chorus

**1998tweety** (10): Ok this is actually a massive serve, that chorus is so good.

**CarlieScion** (10): queen of overthinking

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is just a pure bop, so damn good. Also I'm gonna be honest the music video really gave me a good laugh, it's getting funny.

**redgold51** (10): The most fun song to belt out in the car

**Stryxen** (10): first time I heard HEY I flinched and started giving her the attention she deserves also queen invented harbours

**turtle-thief** (10): If you're not screaming along when that chorus hits, your mom's a hoe. Sorry, i don't make the rules.

**vayyiqra** (10): Shuffle beats¬†+ synthpop also big good. This could be just as well be as from 1983 as 2019 and I am very for that sound. Also this is random but I love when pop girls have little adlibs like *"hey!*" in the background. Why? idk.

**waluigiest** (10): this song is masterful in how precisely it communicates my anxieties

**rickikardashian** (9.9): this song kind of.hits me way too close home

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): Ugh the curation of these bass synths... artistry

**DaHumanTorch** (9): the production on this is stellar. the chorus absolutely slaps

**flutemytoot** (9): I cannot tell what time signature this song is in.......12/8??

**JulioGrandeur** (9): the progression of the chorus has been done to death; for good reason though. Feels very familiar

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Love the use of compound meter, plus relatable lyrics

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): this song expresses a good sentiment

**Roxieloxie** (8.7): this gets alot better when the chorus kicks in

**Arybeck67** (8.5): the throwback vibe of this, yes lets live in the present

**kappyko** (8): donks!

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): I love the 80s vibes on the chorus here.

**wavingwolves** (8): this so fun to listen to

**Awkward\_King** (7): i'm in the uk so a lot of sigrid songs got a lot of radioplay and feel slightly overplayed to me, so while this is a cute song i just get a bit annoyed by it

**bespectacIed** (7): That's a Carly Rae Jepsen chorus if I've ever heard of one. Meh verses but that chorus is bomb

**nick1372** (7): it's fine but sigrid sweetie stop speak singing the verses of every song I'm only on the second song and it's already annoying

**nooodisaster** (7): Honestly sis is being a lil too relatable w these lyrics... I feel attacked.

**WeastofEden44** (7): Def not bad, but it's missing something. The chorus could be better.

Alaska has some of the most simple production in this rate. Which should make sense, since Maggie wrote it as a student. Even so, it's effective, and showcases her early lyrical power. You can really imagine the hike through Alaska ahe took, and the person she's trying to forget.

---

**bbfan132** (11): i love how maggie had a clear vision of what she wanted to create when making this song and then executed her vision perfectly. if there was a dance club in the middle of the woods, they would surely be playing this track, and i‚Äôm totally here for that.

**DaHumanTorch** (11): i already knew this was my 11 going into this rate. it‚Äôs honestly one of my favorite songs ever i just love everything about it. the lyrics and the higher vocals on the chorus and how she just glides over the production effortlessly....i could go on about this song forever. it never fails to put me in a great mood and calm me down.Ôøº. a masterpiece and i hope it does well

**mudkip1** (11): just an absolute iconic banger

**Arybeck67** (10): the song that put Maggie on the map. I will say it sounds a little out of place on this album but judging by song quality alone, like Pharrell, this song leaves me speechless each time.

**cubascastrodistrict** (10): the rare song that is no worse than its hyped up to be. Really fantastic and it‚Äôs obvious why this is the song that started Maggie‚Äôs career, and why it made it on this album 4 years later.

**redgold51** (10): Hey girls, my name's Alaska

**rotating3Dtext** (10): do i cry like pharrell? no, but it‚Äôs still a pretty good song

**skargardin** (10): Godtier

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this winter forest nymph log cabin music is FIRE

**turtle-thief** (10): This song inspired the first time i shaved my head (i was ahead of my time).

**vayyiqra** (10): we all know this is going to be a contender for the winner and we know it deserves it because it's one of the most beautiful pop songs of the last decade. Popheads can hate Pharrell all they want but he knows what a good song is.

**waluigiest** (10): this folk dance is so so so well done

**1998tweety** (9.5): So good, wish it was a bit longer though.

**JulioGrandeur** (9.5): a Maggie staple. acoustic version is a 10 but this is so close

**ReallyCreative** (9.4): it's a lower key track but Maggie's going all the way in on these vocals and it's absolutely angellic

**flutemytoot** (9): This song always feels like a skip when it starts, but then it builds and builds and I remember how fantastic it is by the end

**ManofOranges** (9): The instrumental like at the beginning of this song just sounds like it would play over a commercial for a nature documentary when the animals are all playing n shit I can't really explain it but yes.

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9): No surprise that Pharrell was speechless after hearing this.

**walkedoffanoldme** (9): maggie rogers is so much smarter and talented than i will ever be i‚Äôve accepted it

**nooodisaster** (8): The first time I heard this album I didn't know Maggie's backstory and this song.. was completely forgettable for me lmaaao. I mean the chorus is gorgeous but even now I find it on the average end of this album. Also idgaf if Pharrel cried to this song, he produced 'the light is coming'.

**shesdoingyoga** (8): I did not like this song the first time I listened to the album but it grew on my after a few listens

**Stryxen** (8): Queen of going on a journey!

**wavingwolves** (8): this song feels so peaceful

**WeastofEden44** (8): Alaska Thunderfuck outsold but this still bops

**Roxieloxie** (7.6): this is kinda cute

**CarlieScion** (7): still kinda a jam, but it's not as good compared to some of the other songs on this album

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): I'm Maggie Roggers and I'm here to make it clear; I know you love me, baby, that's why you brought me here; Was a bitch on Season 5, I'm gonna make it right; Give me a sewing challenge and I'll give you what you like; I'm full of tricks, baby, just like on Halloween; A room full of monsters and it makes me wanna scream; I have to get this right so you don't waste your time; Not like my comedy, I'm killing on this rhyme; I'm gonna show you what I can do; You're going crazy and seeing two; It's not my fault, you can't blame my game; All these other hoes, but they're all the same.

**nick1372** (7): A classic but something about the plink plonky instrumental plus the falsetto wears out real fast. Every once in a while it really hits the spot, though.

**xosam** (6): I did not hear of this artist prior to seeing this rate, but apparently this is supposed to be one of the more popular ones, but I just didnt get it at all, I guess it's just not my type of pop

**bespectacIed** (3): I don't feel anything for this song, I don't get how this song blew Maggie up. Not a fan of the whisper pop chorus

Bottoms really showed up for miss King, huh? The top 20 was honestly in flux the whole time, and KP's top songs veered wildly between places. Cheap Queen, Prophet, and this were all her top song at some point. Hit The Back was anywhere between #3 and #15. But it put up a fight and ended up in a respectable place among some very strong singles.

---

**Awkward\_King** (11): this is it. doesn't this song just make u wanna FUCK tho. "well i'm a star but you're an icon, dirty girl with lots of passion, staring at my fingers while i talk to you"

**ReallyCreative** (11): Bottoms RISE UP

**wavingwolves** (11): the "staring at my fingers while i talk to you" really hits. there's something so sexy about it, since us sapphics really love staring at some girls fingers and call it flirting

**xaviersi** (11): Pop perfection, tbh. Subtleties from so many genres and overall fun!

**cremeebrulee** (10): the best song off this album for sure

**ImADudeDuh** (10): anal queen

**kappyko** (10): not great but everybody loves sex you know so to the top ten it goes EDIT: jk i really like this

**ManofOranges** (10): Without a doubt the best song on this album. I don't love love it but it's more than serviceable and actually is catchy and memorable and warrants several listens.

**nick1372** (10): bottom anthem!!

**nooodisaster** (10): Strong "twerking in the club while there's tears streaming down your face" vibes.

**skargardin** (10): Banger! One of the highlights on the album

**turtle-thief** (10): This is the "nobody" (mitski) of the album.

**untutorable** (10): banger alert!!!

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): I don‚Äôt even know if I would call this my favorite song on the album on an individual basis, but it gets a score boost for grabbing my attention back and sounding noticeably different from the rest of the songs while still fitting in with the overall sound of the album.

**DaBigBoi** (9): An amazing hook without having to disrupt the chill, more lowkey sound of this album. There is definitely flavor.

**WeastofEden44** (9): This is SUCH A JAM

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): bottoming anthem

**Stryxen** (8.5): a well deserved upbeat moment in the album and it feels like finally thinking clearly- i just love it

**1998tweety** (8): The chorus on this is *almost* amazing, really could've been a 10.

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): I like how this builds into a nice groove.

**Arybeck67** (7): I‚Äôm bored

**mrmeepz** (7): I like the way it progresses

**plantp0wer** (7): It‚Äôs catchy and I like the beat but.. I just hate the lyric ‚ÄúI need you to be my motor‚Äù. Stop trying to be rihanna‚Äôs shut up and drive

**CarlieScion** (6): can kp please try to hit the notes when recording music, thanks

**vayyiqra** (6): This is kind of a bop, aside from the kind of meandering intro. It's musically kind of odd for the lyrically most horny song on the album, but she tried, even if "G.U.Y." did this same concept way better six years before this came out.

**bespectacIed** (5): bops a lil

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4.5): if someone played this before sex i would leave

# Cheap Queen

---

**Overall Average**: 7.035 **// Average Controversy:** 1.701

---

**flutemytoot** (8.692): I had this album on REPEAT for all of February/March and the only conclusion I can come to is that its haters are STUPID IDIOTS who can't recognise good music when it hits them in the face.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7.692): Why do I feel like my favorite tracks on this are the interludes? This album is... okay, but I feel like I would've enjoyed it more in a different context (not in a rate where the other two records are way more high-energy). Not sure if the highs on this album are that high or... they're just good enough to stand out from the one note that it generally is. B for effort.

**Stryxen** (7.538): this is the better album as a whole out of all three but idk if that's gonna come across in my scored

**shesdoingyoga** (7.423): I wanted to like this more, but this is my least favorite album from the rate.  I listened to it a few times and had the same reaction each time, which was that I got so bored by the middle of the album that I had a hard time appreciating it as a whole.  I don‚Äôt mind most of the songs individually, but when they‚Äôre all generally slower and lower energy it became hard for me to really pay attention.  I would finish a song and then immediately forget what it sounded like because they all sounded too similar.  There were a few shorter tracks on the album that had potential to keep me more engaged but ended up dragging my opinion down even further because I found myself disappointed that there wasn‚Äôt more to the song.

**wavingwolves** (7.423): it's okay overall but it sounds unfinished. the short songs could be worked a little more, since they don't sound like interludes or songs, just something in the middle and it's weird. there's some gems and a lot of potential but it fell short.

**walkedoffanoldme** (7.077): Mikaela Straus is extremely talented and I really hope she starts to take off more with the gp bc she deserves it !

**nooodisaster** (6.654): Probably my least favorite of the 3, but still quality.

**mrmeepz** (6.462): I needed the most time with this album. But it was worth it, there‚Äôs some great songs on here

**skargardin** (6.308): I wanted to like this album way more than I did. Her debut EP was absolutely stellar and I liked some of the pre-release singles but it all fizzled out into a largely forgettable album.

**bespectacIed** (6.154): I don't actively listen to King Princess, this is my first time to really take time on her, but I'm always happy for a good queer artist flourishing. It's hard to be objective because emotional attachment is probably my biggest criterion in rating songs. BUT there are a few gems in here, so there's that.

**vayyiqra** (5.615): I wanted to like King Princess, because my best friend is a stan of hers, and in fact it was through her that she realized she was genderqueer, so it's important to her (and I imagine many other fans too). I just didn't vibe much with the songs she had out before this (which are in the bonus tracks here) and the album itself left no impression on me. I only listened to it once and going back to it hasn't improved it for me. It's not an actively bad album, but neither do I enjoy it much. I find the retro vibe on album every track isn't to my taste and the lyrics are mostly boring. Sorry to any KP stans but I gave it a fair chance, I just didn't vibe with it. (Also this is a bit shallow so it doesn't affect my opinion of the album itself, but I really don't like the cover.) Overall rating: 5.6

**plantp0wer** (5.154): This album bores me I‚Äôm sorry, it‚Äôs just quite one-note

This is on my workout playlist. An incredible, high tempo, empowering song that makes you feel like nobody can stop you. The breakdown in the bridge is awesome too.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): Kendrick outsol but damn if this song is a giant BOP. I kid y'all not, one of my earliest memories of r/popheads is seeing this song and this tiny up and coming pop girlie being posted and talked about, and me having this strange feeling (and hope) that she will become the new indie pop darling. This should win.

**CarlieScion** (10): @everyone who came for halsey including without me on manic - this song was first released in FEBRUARY 2017 and this album came out in MARCH 2019!!!! anyways this was my 11 in the 2017 ep rate and IT SHOULD HAVE won and yall suck

**DaHumanTorch** (10): bad bitch anthem. anytime i listen to this i feel so powerful and confident

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i can not believe she would steal this song title from a successful black man and make it all about hersel- jk but i would not be surprised if someone unironically comments that.

**kappyko** (10): yas

**ManofOranges** (10): Fuckkkk now this is a hit right here. I believe this was the first Sigrid song I heard and instantly I was hooked. It still holds up so well, even compared to many of her new songs. This is the definition of starting off with a bang.

**mudkip1** (10): used to be obsessed with this song

**nick1372** (10): Sara Bareilles's Love Song for generation z

**skargardin** (10): The song that made me fall in love with ha voice. Just lovely.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): a massive bop

**turtle-thief** (10): She's got a point, she's an icon, she's a legend and she is the moment.

**vayyiqra** (10): The only other serious contender for my 11 in this rate (yes I know "Alaska" is right there but it hardly needs my help) because it's a whole jam and there is a reason it's her signature song. It clearly resonates with a lot of listeners and the chorus is massive. :kimbryell:

**1998tweety** (9.5): Big bop, recycle your goods songs is a great idea.

=====

nick1372: I think I was specifically talking about the story behind both songs. Don‚Äôt Kill My Vibe and Love Song are both very clearly about record executives pressuring an up and coming star. I don‚Äôt remember if King of Anything is explicitly about that? (I lowkey think Sara was just trying to create Love Song pt. 2 with that one so maybe). But I do agree that tonally and lyrically it is much more similar to King of Anything!

rikkirikkiparmparm: > I don‚Äôt remember if King of Anything is explicitly about that? (I lowkey think Sara was just trying to create Love Song pt. 2 with that one so maybe)

AFAIK Sara has never confirmed what specifically inspired the song (she usually keeps it pretty general, saying it's about people who should mind their own fucking business), but the rumors suggest it basically is "Love Song" pt. 2., and that she was frustrated with someone at her label.

Meanwhile, I know "Don't Kill My Vibe" was inspired by a writing session where Sigrid felt disrespected by the other writers in the room, but I feel like it works as a more general "fuck you/fuck off" song. So I guess to me KoA and DKMV are a little more relatable than LS, but ultimately all 3 are quite similar (I was probably just being an obnoxious Sara Bareilles stan trying to show off).

With the surprise upset, Talia beats 1950 in the bonus rate. I think it probably helps in this subreddit that it is more outwardly queer. Overall, I think it's about the same quality, but a good victory nonetheless.

---

**DaHumanTorch** (10): yet again, better than anything on the album

**JulioGrandeur** (10): i was so close to giving this score to split stones. This was edged ahead because i can't find a flaw. The lyrics and music give this one such a special feel for me. My favorite track from King Princess

**ManofOranges** (10): I do like this one.

**ReallyCreative** (10): this is ART mawma

**Stryxen** (10): i literally wrote this song this is literally me in the song, how did she steal my thoughts

**TinosCallingMeOver** (10): The way Mikaela sings the name 'Talia' is just so full of emotion and perfect.

**turtle-thief** (10): That first line was enough. i'm gay now, thanks KP.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Ha 2nd best song

**shesdoingyoga** (9): I love this sound from her

**nooodisaster** (8): Super catchy yet super emotional as well. A great follow-up single.

**WeastofEden44** (8): This was such a pleasant surprise for me

**bespectacIed** (7): bop

**vayyiqra** (7): This is probably her best song and it's not even on her debut album, which is a big L.

Third song I really adore from this album. I remember going on long, slow runs along to this song. It's fairly calming, and also represents the constant change that was happening in my life around the time it was released.

---

**agentofscranton** (11): that closing minute is what you hear when you ascend into heaven

**Arybeck67** (11): this song omfgggggg it feels like such a release, Maggie finally letting herself be free and I love it

**bespectacIed** (11): These last few rates, my 11s have all fallen off early and this won't be any different, but fuck it, this is my 11. From the Lorde - Loveless-ish intro (I almost always say "that's my favorite tape" before this song starts lmao), to the outstanding Rostam production, the slowed down bridge leading up to the beautiful vocals at the end, and most importantly, the imagery of likening falling in love with wading through falling water ... this song just ticks all the boxes to me for a love song. It's so painfully, fundamentally true: the idea that "love" creeps at you slowly and gradually, instead of all at once. I'm so captivated by this song, this is the best song in the rate (tied with Light On), and one of my favorite songs ever.

**cubascastrodistrict** (11): I like this album a lot, but I still feel like Maggie is not living up to her potential on most of it. The big exception is this song. It‚Äôs one of my favorite songs in years, it‚Äôs legitimately incredible. The production is gorgeous, I‚Äôm a big folk fan but this sounds fresh and classic at the same time. The slow down in the bridge is incredible and the lyrics are some of the best Maggie‚Äôs ever done.

**Sfbby** (11): Water is falling down my cheeks because this song is too goooood, especially the way the production slowly builds up like a river stream to the outburst of feelings she experiences through this lost relationship

**suffocatedbears** (11): MASTERPIECE

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): ok so this was hard between Alaska, Back In My Body, On + Off, etc... but I will choose to go with this angelic hymn

**1998tweety** (10): Immaculate, her choruses are always so damn good.

**CarlieScion** (10): this song is just gorgeous

**kappyko** (10): this song is so good it makes me want to cry lol

**nick1372** (10): Queen of forgetting spaces between words

**ReallyCreative** (10): A classic

**rotating3Dtext** (10): i LIVE for that last part

**skargardin** (10): The song that was my gateway drug into her music, love love love it.

**TinosCallingMeOver** (10): This is the song that introduced me to Maggie ‚Äì I love how the track slows into the final minute of the song.

**turtle-thief** (10): All i can think about is that first belt in the SNL performance.

**waluigiest** (10): tens out for Rostam

**mrmeepz** (9.5): I live for the weird percussion throughout the track and the tempo change at the end. I really want Maggie to work with Rostam again

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): A mild, bittersweet tear-jerker.

**nooodisaster** (9): The breakdown... *chefs kiss*

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): i keep hearing ‚Äúi fought the current‚Äù as ‚Äúi fucked a girl and‚Äù and it catches me off guard literally every time

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): I think the middle of the album is the weakest part but this song is where it picks back up again

**Stryxen** (8): every time she goes waaaterrr my heart goes :)

**ManofOranges** (7): Yessssss come on Frank Lloyd Wright serving architectural genius

**vayyiqra** (6): More pop songs need piano chords in them but this song is just okay.

Another song from Mags that is just incredibly personal to me. I left a lot of people behind when I graduated from university to better things. It left me vulnerable, and missing a lot of people, but with all those people excited and happy for me. This song really does reflect those emotions of going on to bigger things, unsure of what will happen. I'm definitely glad to still have those connections though, and will continue to leave the Light On for those people.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (11): When she did this on SNL yas a serve

**TinosCallingMeOver** (11): The chorus is anthemic, the whole song is perfectly bittersweet in a way that just sums up your 20s, play it in the car with the windows open singing along with everything you've got!

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh this is so good. Good verses, good chorus, good everything.

**Arybeck67** (10): IF YOU KEEP REACHING OUT ILL KEEP COMING BACK BUT IF YOURE GONE FOR GOOD, IM OKAY WITH THAT! Fuck...relatable.

**bespectacIed** (10): An absolutely amazing depiction of tiptoeing the line between wanting to hold on and wanting to start over. I just feel such an vulnerable and flawed human while listening to lyrics and feeling the synths coursing through my veins. It's so stunning, refreshing, makes me cry every time. I fucking love it, it's one of my favorite songs ever. I hope this wins.

**CarlieScion** (10): this song!!!!! would so be my 11 if this album wasnt up against sigrid

**ManofOranges** (10): I considered giving my 11 to this. It kind of just speaks to me in a way that a lot of songs don't? I don't really know but for some reason I really love it.

**nick1372** (10): It feels like every singer-songwriter pop adjacent girl has made this song but Maggie makes it feel so fresh and new.

**nooodisaster** (10): The way this chorus explodes makes me throw my arms up like spaghetti and vibe HARD. I love how the lyrics are simultaneously heart-wrenching and hopeful. "If you leave the light on, I'll leave the light on", Queen of wasting electricity.

**wavingwolves** (10): there's something very vulnerable about this song and i really love it

**cubascastrodistrict** (9): the best new song so far in the album. Great pop banger that includes elements of Alaska and some of Maggie‚Äôs folk roots with a booming pop chorus. Feels really genuine.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): this is just such a feel good song, i love it so much

**mrmeepz** (9): I love the reverb in the anthemic chorus. Also, lyrically one of Maggie's best

**Stryxen** (9): kind of an instant classic

**turtle-thief** (9): This is an honest to heart anthem that one day will be so overplayed thanks to some movie soundtrack.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): while it was great on first listen, a few more listens in this track is still good but isn't particularly distinctive

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): When we‚Äôre all allowed to leave the house and travel again, this would be a good driving song

**DaBigBoi** (8): The slightly grander production rlly helped light this song up.

**Roxieloxie** (8): where have i heard this before, its driving me crazy omg. OH IT WAS TALL GIRL, fuck that movie

**vayyiqra** (8): I used to be cynical and think this was a bland alt-pop FM radio kind of song but it's really grown on me. It's so soothing.

**waluigiest** (7): chorus smacks

**WeastofEden44** (7): Cute but never connected with it as much as everyone else

**Overall Average**: 8.156 **// Average Controversy:** 1.541

---

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.583): a very good album that gets unfairly shaded! one of my favorite releases in recent years üòî <3

**sailormunelune** (9.000): Absolutely one of my favorite albums of 2019. The dreamy production and honest lyrics make listening to this album so damn therapeutic.

**flutemytoot** (8.833): I've never racked up so many scrobbles in a short amount of time, this leapt right to my no. 3 overall album on Last.fm for good reason. Maggie's voice is amazing, her lyrics are great, her songwriting is great. I'm so excited to see what she comes out with next üíñ

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.667): Going into the rate as a Sigrid stan, I wasn't expecting Maggie to come out of it with the highest average. Well guess what, Niki, she did. I really like how all the ephemeral, mellow and bombastic sounds elegantly fuse together into something this idillic. I should have discovered this album earlier.

**shesdoingyoga** (8.542): Out of the 3 albums in the rate, I would rank this one in the middle.  I enjoyed each song as I heard it, but the album as a whole sort of blends together to me.  It isn‚Äôt quite boring, but it ends up largely unmemorable despite being good.  The first 3 songs are the only ones I find myself consistently revisiting.  Her vocals and the melodies were the best part of the album for me.

**skargardin** (8.333): Maggie's voice is like a warm hug and this album encapsulates that. This is the most well-written album of the rate by far.

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8.333): This album was the soundtrack to summer 2018/2019 to me so I don't know how objective I can actually be in my ratings here

**nooodisaster** (8.167): What a treat to discover this album! Thank you to the rate hosts. I'd never heard of Maggie Rogers before this, and now this'd be in the top 5 favorite 2019 albums for me. Sooo good.

**mrmeepz** (8.083): I really like this album. I first listened to it in January, and I've had a lot of these songs on repeat

**walkedoffanoldme** (8.083): I want to be maggie rogers when I grow up

**wavingwolves** (8.042): pretty solid album with some nice production, but it feels a little hesitant and safe a lot of the times and i wish it went a little further. still, it makes for a very nice listening experience and it has its wistful and vulnerable moments.

**bespectacIed** (7.500): An album that grew on me so much after dismissing it as yet another white folk-pop girlie doing a singer-songwriter album.  There are a handful of duds in this album but holy shit, the majority of this are some of the most inspiring, vulnerable songs, and heck, one of my favorite songs ever. I'm a proud semi-Maggie Rogersinator.

**vayyiqra** (7.333): This is a really good and cute alternative album with a lot of a memorable tracks on it. I wouldn't say I loved it or that it was one of my favourites of last year, but I did enjoy it thoroughly and have listened to it many times. Maggie is a talented songwriter with a beautiful voice. Overall rating: 7.3

**Stryxen** (6.958): fantano said it was bad so i have to hate this sorry

This song! Another bop! and the music video for this is honestly iconic! if this rate was only about the video, Sucker Punch would be #1 hands down. It has so many ideas, and is slightly absurdist, but it pulls it off *well*.

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): i'm not the biggest sigrid fan for some reason? i think i don't like the stripped back visual aesthetic too much, but she seems very sweet and this is such a good song.

**bespectacIed** (10): Pop perfection. Can I just emphasize how PERFECT this is as an album opener??? "I'm freaking out 'cause I'm scared this might end bad // But I'll still come back for that sucker punch" --- what an innocent but prophetic line that predicted this album's replay value

**CarlieScion** (10): this song is an EXPLOSION of happiness

**cremeebrulee** (10): this opening hit me like a sucker punch

**DaHumanTorch** (10): such a bop. if this isn‚Äôt top 10 i‚Äôm gonna be fuming

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This made me fall in love with Sigrid's music. Point blank.

**mudkip1** (10): love this

**ReallyCreative** (10): Bombastic and fun, this is some amazing pop right here

**turtle-thief** (10): From this rate, THIS is the superior opening track.

**vayyiqra** (10): *That [voice goes falsetto] SUCKA punch*:kimbryell: Synthpop with trap beats is big good. This is a bop!

**DaBigBoi** (9.5): She really packed a punch with the pure personality this title and opener exuded! I remember defending this song incessantly.

**Arybeck67** (9): IM FREAKING OUT OVER THIS SONG üí•üí•üí•

**flutemytoot** (9): love huh accent when she says "cup of coffee by the sters" üòç

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this started rocky but that chorus yas

**kappyko** (9): harry styles.

**ManofOranges** (9): I remember listening to the don't kill my vibe ep so many times as well as a few songs off of raw and just desperately awaiting Sigrid to release the damn album or sumn and then this song came out as a prelude to the album's release and I remember being disappointed. That anticipation probably made me think the song was worse than it really is, it's certainly pretty good although it's still not the best in my opinion.

**Roxieloxie** (9): You know what, it's simple, but that dose not mean its bad

**Stryxen** (9): I just like how she goes sokaponch

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9): A great opener for the album, full of energy. Another anthemic banger.

**nick1372** (8.5): Is this just a discount kesha song? yes. But does that chorus slap? also yes.

**1998tweety** (8): This is promising, I like the chorus, but the weird voice she puts on in the pre-chorus takes me out.

**mrmeepz** (8): I really like the chorus and the drums

**shesdoingyoga** (8): The verses don‚Äôt really match the vibe of the rest of the album but they still somehow work?  And then the chorus comes in like a sucker punch

**waluigiest** (8): fun!! Writing is strange (both our hoodies red????) but it‚Äôs nice. The vocoder bridge is tasty

**wavingwolves** (8): better than sucker punch (2011) the movie

**WeastofEden44** (8): This pops THE FUCK off

The decisive victor, all the way through the month. Light On was in first once or twice, and Sucker Punch never got here. You could probably say this was her breakout hit in Europe, and it's easy to see why. The beat is somewhat simple but driving, and the lyrics are cute and throughtful. A good choice for a #1.

---

**CarlieScion** (11): this song is the PERFECT pop song. like i didnt think sigrid could ever top DKMV but this is Emotion-levels of perfect.

**DaBigBoi** (11): Impeccably produced and written. With each listen, I find new elements to love about the song. From the paper clip drop to the blaring synths layered on each other, it‚Äôs the perfect pop song. It pulls and adds back in instruments that really make the song feel like it‚Äôs progressing.

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): We're no strangers to love; You know the rules and so do I; A full commitment's what I'm thinking of; You wouldn't get this from any other guy; I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling; Gotta make you understand; Never gonna give you up; Never gonna let you down; Never gonna run around and desert you; Never gonna make you cry; Never gonna say goodbye; Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

**hikkaru** (11): WINNER!

**ManofOranges** (11): I was torn for a long time about what song I would give my 11 and so here I am deciding to give it to this song. The method to my madness is essentially that this song is it. It is the moment. I wish the best for it. I have no idea where it's gonna place but if it doesn't place in the top 1 then something is really and truly wrong with the world.

**shesdoingyoga** (11): This is a perfect pop song.  The vocal performance, the lyrics, the production, the way the song swells right in the points where it should, everything about it adds together to make my favorite song from this rate

**skargardin** (11): Honestly she snapped hard with this. I hope that she's able to capture the same kind of pop magic with her next album.

**vayyiqra** (11): This is a total bop, everything I want to hear in an electropop song from an alternative Scandinavian pop girl (of which I listen to *many*, believe me) and an incredible chorus. If this doesn't make day 3 you are all estranged to me.

**waluigiest** (11): she say ‚Äúwoop!‚Äù This song is emblematic of what is so great about this album. It mixes textures and dynamics in a sophisticated, exciting way - see how the chorus is a dynamic shift from the verse, but she gets downright EXPLOSIVE halfway through. it‚Äôs a stunning piece of pop music

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop, ugh that chorus is so good.

**bespectacIed** (10): I remember this being Sigrid's first major single release that catapulted her to the attention of pop fans. This is the video where I kinda thought that Sigrid is gonna be the real deal. That dancepop beat will make Robyn proud. Pop perfection, the video is so kitschy and cute. This should win.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): POP PERFECTIONNN...i would not be shocked if this wins the whole rate

**flutemytoot** (10): I meannnnnnnnn truly iconic

**JulioGrandeur** (10): sums up her sound, imo

**kappyko** (10): GREATEST SONG EVER RECORDED

**rickikardashian** (10): you know what, when the song is this amazing you get to put it in your album, even if it's already a good 2 years old

**rotating3Dtext** (10): first song by her I heard, what a good introduction

**Stryxen** (10): when she goes woOp... wow, what a moment

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): halsey and lauren jaguari WHO

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): Some phenomenal energy in this track, love the closing minute or so

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9): Clever lyrics, a great build from quiet verses to a pumping chorus. This is the kind of song that would get robbed in Eurovision and place second due to political considerations in the countries' voting.

**WeastofEden44** (9): The production on this track is unbelievable.

**mrmeepz** (8): I love how it starts, and how the first chorus comes in. Really cool and powerful song in general

**mudkip1** (8): this didn't connect with me but i still like it

**Roxieloxie** (7.3): better than some songs titled strangers but not as good as some

**Arybeck67** (7): I like the lyrics, but then again I really don‚Äôt like the production on it oof

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Halsey and Lauren Jaguarundi outpeaked tbh

**nick1372** (7): honestly what is this song about? are they together? friends? exes? it's catchy but just too vague

**nooodisaster** (6): I keep waiting for the listen where I'm like "yasss!!! this is a BOP!", but it just ain't happening. It's ain't tho.

static_int_husp: # Sucker Punch

---

**Overall Average**: 7.905 **// Average Controversy:** 1.677

---

**CarlieScion** (9.833): I'm Norwegian. It would be TREASON for me to not love this album!!! This is literally the best pop album to come out of Norway since like. Ten Love Songs.

**waluigiest** (9.083): I got through this album and realized I didn‚Äôt give anything lower than an 8. I listened to it again and found that it is just that good - well written, fun, good production, exciting vocal performance. It‚Äôs consistent and excellent.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.000): This is my favorite of the three albums in this rate.  The lyrics, production, and vocals are fantastic across all tracks, and I still enjoy the songs that I don‚Äôt like as much.  This is the only album in the rate where all the songs are actually memorable and don‚Äôt blend together in my mind.

**vayyiqra** (8.833): This was one of my favourite albums of last year and further convinces me that Scandinavian pop can do no wrong. It was the most to my taste out of the three in this rate, being the most electropop, and I like Sigrid's voice the most (though Maggie's is nice too). There is some really good songwriting here as well, which is of course the most important thing. While I don't remember every track on it, whenever I do listen to it I find myself enjoying the whole thing quite a bit. Sigrid remains a highly underrated artist. I think I'm in love. Overall rating: 8.8 (wow that's high)

**Stryxen** (8.633): no offence but you guys are really sleeping on ms sigrid here

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.500): This album is probably one of the most hitting-too-close-to-home records I've ever had to listen to. Call me delusional, but I'd place it on the PH/Melodrama shelf of "teenager / young adult struggling with newfound emotional adulthood" relatability. It's that good to me.

**flutemytoot** (8.075): I liked a few songs from this album but never gave it a proper chance until this rate, and I'm glad I did

**nooodisaster** (8.042): A hyper consistent album that's almost TOO consistent with its sonic landscape.

**skargardin** (7.750): I played Sucker Punch a WHOLE lot when it released last year but I haven't really gone back to it in a loong time. This is a strong debut even if it's a little bit uneven and some track has grown off of me.

**bespectacIed** (7.500): I'm a proud longtime sigridinator. One of my earliest memories of being in popheads is seeing posts about this new, unknown Scandinavian white girl who released a string of pop gems, and whom I believed will be the next big thing. I dunno if that last one came true (yet), but I am still extremely proud of how far Sigrid has come. This debut, though super inconsistent and boring in some parts, is still a solid debut for a solid pop girl. P.S. Still angry that Schedules didn't make into her debut

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.875): this album is desperately missing Plot Twist and i will never forgive her for it

**ImADudeDuh** (6.875): this might be one of the most wildly inconsistent albums i‚Äôve heard

**mrmeepz** (6.833): I actually enjoyed this album overall. Some songs don‚Äôt speak to me that much, but it‚Äôs a pretty solid debut

**walkedoffanoldme** (6.333): This is my least played album of the three but after playing everything once through to score, I did find myself wanting to go back and listen again. Also I really like this album cover if that counts for anything

**wavingwolves** (5.417): this is so incredibly basic that it features a song called basic. it feels uncharismatic and samey, very spotifycore - the kind of music that serves to fill up algorithm made playlists.

rikkirikkiparmparm: > this is so incredibly basic that it features a song called basic. it feels uncharismatic and samey, very spotifycore

Well, I guess Sigrid did tell say "if you feel it, don't cage it", but frankly I think it would've been better to keep this opinion locked up.
