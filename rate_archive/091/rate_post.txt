## Maggie Rogers - Heard It In A Past Life

Maggie Rogers first popped onto the pulic scene in 2016 with her song Alaska, which took off after a video of [Pharrel praising it](https://youtu.be/FAM1N1APk80) went viral. Since then, Rogers has slowly but surely gained momentum as one of the most promising young singer-songwriters in popular music. Her blend of pop and folk songs with introspective and relatable lyrics has earned her a decent following, a #2 album, and consistent spots on the Billboard Alternative charts. Maggie capped of her last year with a nomination for Best New Artist at the 2020 Grammys, and it is clear the ["witchy feminist rock star"](https://twitter.com/maggierogers/status/1087419319569518592) is going to stick around for a long time.

## Sigrid - Sucker Punch

Sigrid Solbakk Raabe is a Norweigan singer and songwriter whose biggest success so far has been in the UK. Her Debut EP *Don't Kill My Vibe* won her the [BBC Sound of 2018](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1cV3lC483qtKJq7SXWdr1qL/the-longlist), which she followed up by releasing her most well know track, "Strangers", which peaked at #10 in the UK. While less well known than some pop acts, especially in America, Sigrid's success among pop music fans has still been notable, and her European synthpop styling is well polished, and she is an ever growing voice in her niche.

## King Princess - Cheap Queen

Mikaela Mullaney Straus, also known as King Princess, had her first single with 1950, a song about queer love and difficulties faced by the LGBTQ+ community. A [tweet from Harry Styles](https://twitter.com/Harry_Styles/status/971175408207937536) helped the song go viral, and she quickly followed up with her debut EP *Make My Bed*. King Princess quickly gained a large following in the LGBTQ+ community, especially among women. KP identifies and gay and genderqueer, and these experiences are reflected very honestly in her music.

## The Rules

Now this is the most important part so make sure to read these carefully!

Listen to every song listed and give it a score between one (1) and ten (10). You can use up to one decimal place (5.5, 5.3 etc.). Ballots with songs who are missing scores won't be counted!

You may give one song a zero (0) and one song an eleven (11) across the main rate (NOT the bonus rate). These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track. You are NOT required to leave a comment for these songs, but it is encouraged.

To make it easier for both me, the host, and yall, PLEASE USE THE PROVIDED LINK TO FILL IN YOUR SCORES

Feel free to PM me on Reddit or Discord if you'd like to change any of your scores.

If I suspect that you are willfully sabotaging with your ballot, I reserve the right to discard it or ask you to clarify your scores with extra comments.

You can also add comments to any song! Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space! Same if you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!

The following format is the only acceptable format for song comments:

> Alaska: 11 The best state in the US

Any of the following formats are INCORRECT:

> Sucker Punch: I'm going to Sucker punch this song with a 1

> In Vain: 11: I am giving this score in vain

> Fallingwater: (11) It's scores are not falling
