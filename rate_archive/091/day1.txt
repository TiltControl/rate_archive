MrSwearword: Here's your weird fact for this rate: "Light On" by Maggie Rogers peaked at #26 on the Dance Club Play songs chart back in the spring of 2019. Meaning that for some reason, there was some poppers o'clock remix of a Maggie Rogers song that some gays were getting their life to last year.

I wouldn't consider any song on KP's album to be an interlude, but this is certainly the most inderlude-y. So it makes sense that this goes out first since popheads obviously hates interludes. The lyrics are basicly a single chrorus, and I think it's cute.

---

**JulioGrandeur** (9): why are the best songs the shortest?

**Roxieloxie** (8): I like the titles more than than i like the songs tbt

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): short but sweet

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): WHY WASN’T THIS LONGER UGH, could’ve been an album highlight

**nooodisaster** (7): Yo if this was like a minute or two longer, it'd be a CONTENDER.

**suffocatedbears** (7): it's a shame this isn't a full song

**walkedoffanoldme** (7): I love the sample-y chopped up sounds that tie this album together idk it just works so well imo

**ReallyCreative** (6.4): Not really a fan

**1998tweety** (6): Yes

**Stryxen** (6): I like it but I wish it started doing something before I formed my opinion

**Arybeck67** (5): another weird interlude ahhh choose what you want to be song!!!

**kappyko** (5): man i sure wish the songs on this album were real

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): dont feel like crying: who are you | this song: im you but weaker

**vayyiqra** (5): ~~DO YOU WANNA SEE ME NAKED LOVER~~ Why are so many songs on this album so short? A song this repetitive doesn't really work when it's not even two minutes long. I can barely rate it.

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): it's a song, it is certainly a song

**ImADudeDuh** (4): emotional queen

**shesdoingyoga** (4): This feels unnecessary

**ManofOranges** (3): Let's just say that I'm glad this song is short.

**turtle-thief** (3): That robot voice and the loud af drum that accompanies it, ruin what could be a decent interlude.

**bespectacIed** (2): so boring

If there's one *other* thing popheads hates, it's ballads. So this song going out next shouldn't be too surprising either. While it is the lowest score I gave on Maggies album, I'm surprised it went out this early. I think it's perfectly servicable, but that doesn't cut it when the scores are as high as they are here.

---

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this was both written and produced by maggie alone...the talent this exudes. this song is gorgeous in every way, my eyes got a little watery listening to it this time even though i’ve heard it so many times before

**waluigiest** (9): I always think this is a slow cover of Dreams by Fleetwood Mac

**1998tweety** (8.5): We're crying ladies. I actually like how her voice sounds a little unpolished at points.

**Arybeck67** (8.5): I’m not ashamed to say I unabashedly cry to this song every time. I’m haunted...but maybe it’s just a past life coming out of me 💔

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): This sounds like something I could hear Stevie Nicks singing, am I the only person who thinks this?

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): there's a really dramatic shift in production here that just comes across as jarring to me in the context of the album. It's pretty but it just doesn't feel like it fits in

**CarlieScion** (6.5): u/violentovernightrush has destroyed me and my love off ballads

**mrmeepz** (6.5): I like how you can hear that she was singing and playing the piano with passion, but something about the way her voice sounds on here bothers me

**cremeebrulee** (6): sorry again i am not a ballad person!!

**WeastofEden44** (6): I go between really liking this song and thinking it's the one potential skip on the album

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): This kind of fell flat for me, I really wanted to enjoy it but I couldn't.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): https://i.redd.it/pdb0x1s6tsh01.jpg

**nick1372** (5): Doesn't fit her strengths as a vocalist

**vayyiqra** (5): I don't really like piano ballads but I do like the strong Fleetwood Mac vibe in this song.

**wavingwolves** (5): sweet but a bit too safe

**nooodisaster** (4): Her past life must've been a mattress because I am falling asleep.

**Stryxen** (4): it just doesn't land well for me :/

**TinosCallingMeOver** (3): Okay so this is the one song I almost always skip on this album. It's dirge-like and I find Maggie's voice a bit annoying on this one.

**bespectacIed** (2): This song is so uneventful and bare and flat. Something about the recording of the vocals is so flat. Also the piano crescendo led to nothing?? I hate this.

**ManofOranges** (2): This is one the dud of the album. I wouldn't say it's because of an aversion to ballads or something like that but I would call it an aversion to boringness.

**mudkip1** (1): i skip this every time

Another fine song. I think lyrically the song is fairly relatable from a queer perspective. The background vocals feel a little off, though, and it could serve to be a little more fleshed out.

---

**CarlieScion** (10): short and sweet

**bespectacIed** (9): GORGEOUS

**JulioGrandeur** (9): the music in this is so solid.

**Arybeck67** (8): ok this is solid finally, I finally feel a soul in you King Princess lol

**kappyko** (8): this was cute!

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): Ooh I like the glowy echo-y chorus vocals, and the slightly jangly piano. Seems sort of ethereal.

**DaBigBoi** (7.5): The piano and the background sounds add layers to this song that I rlly enjoy.

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): It's a ballad but it sounds kinda pretty so ill give it some rights

**walkedoffanoldme** (7): The backing vocal around 1:23 almost sounds kevin parker-esque but maybe that's just me

**1998tweety** (6.5): Meh

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): isabelle when tom nook hired her for resident services

**ImADudeDuh** (6): curious queen

**nooodisaster** (6): sad :(

**ReallyCreative** (6): Animal Crossing outsold

**shesdoingyoga** (6): The first half of the song starts with potential but the second half kills what momentum it had, so I end up wishing the song was both longer and shorter.  Another short song that ends up feeling unnecessary, but this one also has an unnecessary collaboration.  At least it sounds a bit different than the past few.

**ManofOranges** (5): I honestly don't remember a thing about this song.

**Stryxen** (5): ...nothing to say sorry

**vayyiqra** (4): I am getting tired of these short filler songs that add nothing to the album by now.

**wavingwolves** (4): this is the most baffling song on the album. i have no idea what this accomplishes since it just sounds unfinished

**DaHumanTorch** (3.5): glad isabel only had a moment cause any longer would have put me into hibernation

**Awkward\_King** (2): mikaela i love you but i do not care

This is okay, I yhink. Definitely could have gotten a different person to sing this though. Also: something I learned as I write up these comments a day before the rate happens: This is a cover of a Leonard Cohen song. And there are like six different covers of this song, all made for different movies.

---

**ReallyCreative** (10): This is a really interesting song that I could see not getting treated well because it's a bit slower and darker, but Sigrid's voice is COMMANDING here and I'm about it

**DaHumanTorch** (9): TIL sigrid has a song for justice league. the production on this was incredible though, sis had a budget

**waluigiest** (9): this is crazy it sounds like it belongs on the mockingjay part 1 soundtrack

**nick1372** (8.5): wait this slaps she should make more music like this

**1998tweety** (7.5): Snooze

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): Well this is definitely a song from a superhero movie soundtrack

**flutemytoot** (7): I'm surprised how much her voice suits this song

**rickikardashian** (6.8): this was leading to a bigger and better climax that never arrived

**WeastofEden44** (6): This feels so unimportant tbh

**nooodisaster** (5): Imagine if your second most popular song was from the Justice League soundtrack of all things... I'd sue.

**Stryxen** (5): I Forgot That This Existed and I will never listen to this again

**skargardin** (4): So like, I can't get over that this is for the Justice League soundtrack. Everything about this track is just.. weird. Granted I haven't actually watched Justice League but like how does it relate to the movie dsfhjsd. The repetitive everybody knows... hook gets really repetitive after the first two minutes. And the orchestral sound that it's going for is just too much.

**turtle-thief** (4): Another weird decision in the history of that movie.

**vayyiqra** (4): Kimbra's "Everybody Knows" >>> this aggressively mid and rather un-Sigrid-like track. It was written for a movie soundtrack and it shows, since she wouldn't write anything this dark-sounding otherwise. Also, fuck this heavily distorted production; I thought we agreed to leave that behind in 2013.

**ManofOranges** (3): Omg I completely forgot this song existed but I distinctly remember my sister was watching justice league and I heard this song and I was like "wait is that Sigrid????" and that was the end of it and I forgot the song after that but it was fun to discover it again

**bespectacIed** (2): sigrid's voice doesn't fit the typical ominous power ballad soundtrack song. We should've rated Schedules

Ciara, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Sigrid, somehow, doesn't seem to do as well on simple or stripped down songs. I actually feel like this entire song is off key. Either way, Sigrid is much better served by faster boppier sounds rather than the slow ballads she has, which all seem to be misses.

---

**Stryxen** (11): eleven up. please can this not come last

**CarlieScion** (10): this song really showcases how GOOD sigrids vocals are!!!! like the control!!! the head voice!!! the raspiness!! i love!!! and also the songs theme is so cute :pleading_face:

**kappyko** (10): oh i fucking love this

**turtle-thief** (10): i lowkey want to throw it back to this.

**waluigiest** (9): and THIS is like Ingrid Michaelson wow

**Arybeck67** (8): I really love Sigrid’s voice on this track, makes a very intimate song

**DaBigBoi** (8): A nice breather from the nonstop bops.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): A very cute and quirky interlude moment.

**ManofOranges** (8): This song is kind of charming in some really weird way? It really just put a smile on my face.

**nooodisaster** (8): The wholesomeness, wow. Who told her she could make me feel?? Also a short song that feels like it's the perfect length.

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): i wish it was longer

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): worst song in the rate but still not at all bad

**mrmeepz** (7): This was a nice moment of calm. The metaphor of leveling up is cute

**shesdoingyoga** (7): It’s cute but after the first five songs it feels lacking

**vayyiqra** (7): Cute but a little too much of a "cute quirky indie girl making a song for a TV commercial" vibe for me.

**Roxieloxie** (6.6): we love targetcore

**1998tweety** (6.5): Ciara massively outsold it ain't even a contest

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): ciara is shaking

**DaHumanTorch** (6): this song is cute but could’ve been a lot better. i get the whole simplistic vibe she was going for but it just wasn’t the most exciting. definitely my least favorite on the album but still good

**ReallyCreative** (6): I like that she's trying something different here but it pales compared to the rest of the album

**skargardin** (6): It's fine

**TinosCallingMeOver** (6): I zoned out while listening to this one.

**untutorable** (6): she's cute but not gorgeous

**flutemytoot** (5): ironically, the most basic song of the rate

**nick1372** (5): forgot about it right after I listened

**WeastofEden44** (5): This sounds like a Steven Universe song and that triggers me

**bespectacIed** (3): Kinda boring, i'm slow song-phobic and proud

The first KP song out that feels like it was completly fleshed out. The instrumental is interesting and the vibe is a decent, chill bop. It maybe goes on one chrous to long. I also realized while putting these comments together that she uses the word f\*g in the lyrics, and as a queeer man myself, I'm not entirely sure how comfortable I feel about it in general.

---

**turtle-thief** (10): Gives me strong The Turtles vibes and i would love her to go more into this direction in the future.

**ReallyCreative** (9): Getting Zero 7 vibes which is never a bad thing

**Stryxen** (9): damn this sold me on the whole album

**WeastofEden44** (9): Ngl, I like to bussy pop to this

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this has grown on me so much

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): This one is showing more variety, which I like

**nick1372** (8): ok you just gonna make me cry like that huh

**1998tweety** (7.5): Feels the most retro of any of the songs here, it's decent.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): faggy queen

**bespectacIed** (5): cute

**CarlieScion** (5): WHAT was that intro dsfnjkfds

**ManofOranges** (5): For a song about getting your heart destroyed you would think there would be more emotion or feelings or something in this song, but I'm just getting absolutely nothing.

**skargardin** (5): She really drowns in the production here

**vayyiqra** (5): From the title I expected something edgier, but the lyrics have a little bite to them I guess. Musically it's one of the most interesting tracks on the album, but that's not saying much (oop).

**cubascastrodistrict** (2): this song really drags. There’s nothing engaging or interesting about it for me, and it just goes on and on. Longest 3 minute song I’ve ever heard.

This is an intro for Cheap Queen. It's fine byself, but lacking context, it doesn't really stand on it's own super well.

**Awkward\_King** (10): yes im giving this one minute transition song a ten. you wanna know why? you wanna fucking know why? she samples a MINECRAFT DISC in this. that is genius. that was the moment i chose to stan immediately. tens tens tens

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): basically an interlude but a fucking BOP!!

**nick1372** (9): where is the full song

**rotating3Dtext** (9): WHY is this not a full song?? mikaela?? give me minecraft sample bops

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): this is so good but why isn't it a full fledged song??? the ending is so sharp and abrupt come on girl

**ManofOranges** (8): I understand that this is an interlude but I actually kinda like it more than some of the songs in this rate so it will get a high score.

**walkedoffanoldme** (8): I feel like I as a person always wish interludes were longer and this song is no exception

**therokinrolla** (7.5): i was like "oh this song is good" and then it ended so

**wavingwolves** (7.5): god i wish this was a full and finished thing because it sounds so nice

**1998tweety** (7): Uhhhh.. it's King Princess so her shorter songs are lowkey better.

**Arybeck67** (7): the production is sick, but the lyrics are not my thing an dits far too short

**CarlieScion** (7): i lowkey didnt even notice the playlist changing into this song

**flutemytoot** (7): cute little interlude but compared to the rest of this album/rate i can't justify it getting a high rating

**hikkaru** (7): minecraft snapped

**ImADudeDuh** (7): useless queen

**rickikardashian** (7): this was edging at its worst

**shesdoingyoga** (7): Why couldn’t this have been longer?

**TinosCallingMeOver** (7): Lovely little segue

**DaBigBoi** (6.5): For how short it is, I think this continues that vintage vibe she’s going for well.

**Stryxen** (6.5): dont be shy put a longer version

**bespectacIed** (6): cute

**mrmeepz** (6): Pretty cool interlude

**skargardin** (6): This track is one of the most promising ones on the album and then it just ends.. criminal

**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): uh the title is pretty apt cause this was kinda useless...it could’ve been a good track if it was fleshed out into an actual song instead of this attempt at an interlude

**kappyko** (5): oh what

**cubascastrodistrict** (4): not really sure what purpose this serves as an interlude.

**vayyiqra** (4): It's alright but does a song this short and undeveloped need to exist? It's more of an interlude.

**waluigiest** (4): is this what sleep paralysis feels like

**nooodisaster** (0): I mean, she didn't lie.

Another mostly acoustic ballad from Miss King. As I right these comments, I am going from the bottom to top of the rankings for the rate. And all of the KP songs down here in day three do really feel like they're the same thing done slightly differently. I'm not one to call many song "filler", but that does describe a few of these songs down here.

---

**CarlieScion** (10): this is really pretty

**turtle-thief** (10): The fact that Rue from hunger games broke up with KP and we almost didn't get this song is so funny.

**waluigiest** (10): this is so lovely it burns. She really wrote the hell out of this

**walkedoffanoldme** (9): simple melody but this gets stuck in my head all the time

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): I’m still bored because this is yet another slow song, but the lyrics save the song for me

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): I like the Amy Winehouse-esque backing music with the chime-like synth? Wistful and moody.

**WeastofEden44** (8): This is so beautiful omg

**1998tweety** (7.5): It's decent but it's missing something

**DaBigBoi** (7.5): The gentle strumming of the guitar is good.

**mrmeepz** (7.5): It's a really sweet song

**Stryxen** (7.5): homegirl's such a tease that builds and builds up. but the build up is unmatched

**Awkward\_King** (7): probably my favorite of the lowkey kinda bad ones. it's sweet

**ImADudeDuh** (7): secret queen

**ManofOranges** (7): I don't mind this. Pretty inoffensive in my eyes but it beats bad.

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): it's ok but it doesn't really grab my attention

**vayyiqra** (6): On this song KP writes some more explicitly lesbian lyrics, which is kind of cool I guess, and the melody is sort of cute. But also it is an acoustic guitar ballad and therefore it's hard for me to like it *that* much.

**Arybeck67** (5): I like the vibe again of this song, but it’s missing something...like a soul

**DaHumanTorch** (5): i’m kinda neutral on this song. it was nice but also it didn’t really go anywhere interesting, it just kinda fell flat

**nooodisaster** (4): Slow as all hell. Does have some groove but I would never willingly listen to this.

**bespectacIed** (3): i don't register anything

**cubascastrodistrict** (1): ma’am, this is a wendy’s

Lyrics feel fairly repetitive but I like the production on this one. Fairly minimalist, but still does something somehwat interesting with the synths.

---

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the production and instrumentation was gorgeous on this song, especially the violins. easily my favorite on this album

**ImADudeDuh** (10): waiting queen

**nooodisaster** (8.5): ;____________;

**waluigiest** (8): really picks up at the bridge

**Roxieloxie** (7.9): a mood tbt

**1998tweety** (7.5): The production near the end lowkey saves it.

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): I want to like this more but it’s dragged down by still being too similar to the rest of the album

**Arybeck67** (7.3): the production is great but girllllllllll give me something more with these lyrics

**Stryxen** (7): pakige

**TinosCallingMeOver** (7): The bass during the chorus gives me Reputation vibes

**CarlieScion** (6): the vocal layering isnt as annoying here, but this is just a very average ballad

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Gets interesting in the second half, I guess?

**ManofOranges** (6): Pretty middle of the road.

**vayyiqra** (6): This song does vibe a bit but it's nothing great until the end when the synths come in and it ramps up a bit. It's also rather repetitive.

**skargardin** (5): This album needs some real oomph by now to get me interested but sadly i dont think its coming

**bespectacIed** (3): zzz

Listen, I love Hyperpop bullshit. PC Music is cool. I've seen SOPHIE DJ. But you still gotta do it right. Whatever knock off pots and pans producer worked on this song doesn't cut it imo. Lyrically, this could have been a good song. But the production during the chorus is hectic and cluttered, and the latter is not what I want in an instrumental like this.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): Ridiculously catchy, literal crack. The lyric "You just want me to be pictures, numbers, figures" gives me so much buzz, feminist queen. This should win.

**cremeebrulee** (10): why do i love this song sm its so fun and infectious

**Roxieloxie** (10): this lowkey sounds like an indie kitchen version of a song off of thank u, next. For some reason im feeling it though

**CarlieScion** (9): i see what she was trying to do here but it ended up being not as good as most other songs on the album :pensive: but still great

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): More quirkiness! More bops!

**kappyko** (9): not enough noise was made about this

**nick1372** (9): love the off color production

**waluigiest** (9): I am BLOWN away

**cubascastrodistrict** (8): SOPHIE vibes? This is a weird song and not something I expected from Sigrid.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): i have a feeling lots of people aren’t gonna like this since it’s a lot quirkier than the rest of the album but it’s a banger and i hope i’m proved wrong

**skargardin** (8): You tell them queen

**WeastofEden44** (8): I vibe with this

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): fun!

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): This used to be my least favorite song on the album but it grew on me while listening for this rate and I have more appreciation for how it’s different than the rest of the album

**Stryxen** (7.5): just a tune

**ReallyCreative** (7): Quirky, but not really my thing. It's well done for what it is, I just can't imagine I'll go back to it

**vayyiqra** (7): Aside from the very odd title and the lyrics I've never fully understood (it's somehow inspired by *Spirited Away*??? I guess I kind of see it???) it's kind of a bop, albeit a weird one.

**mrmeepz** (6): I appreciate the quirky production but it’s just not my type of song

**nooodisaster** (6): "You just want me to be deeper, smarter, and I'm just tryna be me". Um, SIS.....

**TinosCallingMeOver** (6): A little random?

**Arybeck67** (3): uhhhhh this song, to put it lightly, is a mess

**ManofOranges** (3): Oh god I really don't like this song. It sounds awkward and confused and I don't think it knows what it's doing. Whoever Sigrid is singing to wants her to be x, y, and z, and she just wants to be herself, but if this is herself then it's best that she choose something else.

**JulioGrandeur** (2): vocals were on point but the musicality and backing vocals really did not do it for me. Felt very melanie martinez

**1998tweety** (0): I'm sorry but this is so bad

Not her best song, but it fits sonically with the rest of the album as a good closer. The first half is sparse in production with pretty good lyrics. The added production on the extra chorues at the end sells it pretty nicely, I think.

---

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I'm disappointed I had to listen through the entire album to get to this, but at least it redeems the record somewhat.

**turtle-thief** (10): God, her deep vocals are so hot.

**nooodisaster** (9.5): we CRYING

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This is a pretty track to end the album with

**ReallyCreative** (8.4): It drags just a little bit for me, but it's a pretty solid closing track.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): finale queen

**WeastofEden44** (8): This is a very nice closer to the album. It just fits very nicely.

**1998tweety** (7): Snooze

**DaHumanTorch** (7): this was a nice closer to the album. i loved the production

**Stryxen** (7): crying in the taxi tease

**ManofOranges** (6): I don't think.

**skargardin** (6): A whimper of an end to the album.

**Arybeck67** (5.5): just ends the album on such a doozy and sad note, just no thanks. I’m really disappointed in this whole album, I was really looking forward to it but it’s so mediocre it’s sad.

**mrmeepz** (5.5): It gets a little too repetitive for me

**vayyiqra** (5): It's okay, but I am just bored by this point. Maybe putting the lowest-energy album third in the rate was a mistake in hindsight.

Fun fact: This was used in a scene of the ill-fated NBC sitcom Sunnyside, which I happened to like. It, bielieve it or not, does not actually work too well over a scene where Kal Penn is brooding while on a bridge overlooking a train in Queens. Maybe I have poor taste, and should have expected that show to get cancelled, and this to go out on day 1.

---

**flutemytoot** (10): this song really clicked for me when i was stoned out of my mind, walking home from trade's house and feeling sad over a boy. ok thanks for coming to my ted talk.

**ReallyCreative** (9): I love the production on this track, there's a richness to this song that is just delicious

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): this was a great intro. i especially loved the lyrical content, it hit me pretty hard and i’m sure lots of us could relate to it. the addition of the almost spoken word part in the final two choruses was a nice, enhancing touch

**1998tweety** (8): Ready for this slog...this song is pretty decent but I just know she's gonna fuck it up though.

**cubascastrodistrict** (8): pretty great production, not much in the lyrics but they’re not bad.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): relatable queen

**mrmeepz** (8): I like the atmosphere a lot. The synths and guitars are great

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): not as strong as an opener like the other two albums but still a decent song

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): I enjoyed this but found it dragged on a bit too long at the end

**Arybeck67** (7): just an “eh” opener

**bespectacIed** (7): if you order "literally the most stereotypical altpop song" in a restaurant, this is the dish and I will eat it up

**CarlieScion** (7): i really like the production and the guitar

**JulioGrandeur** (7): solid opener

**nooodisaster** (7): A good intro. Very relatable in how we're mean to ourselves and can take the joke of self-deprecation too far.

**Roxieloxie** (7): Kinda sad I didn't enjoy this one as much as I did the other album openers

**Stryxen** (7): anthem

**TinosCallingMeOver** (7): Something about this gives me The Beatles vibes?

**WeastofEden44** (7): It's good but I got bored at some point listening to this ngl

**DaBigBoi** (6): The vibe is great but leaves me wanting more.

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): A very disappointing intro. It left no impression on me whatsoever and kind of killed my mood about this album right from the start.

**vayyiqra** (6): I like the synths in this but it's odd to begin an album with a slower track and one of my biggest problems is that I don't really like her voice. The lyrics are good though and relatable.

**ManofOranges** (5): She gets a little tough on herself and in this song she also gets a little bit repetitive so that's cool.

This is the one song to go out on Day 1 I will consider an absolute robbery. The first half, by itself, would deserve this. Because as I've already said, Sigrid should not do ballads. The second half however, POPS OFF. I love the building up of tension, and the release of it in those punchy synths.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): The combo of the soft guitar strumming and sigrid's raspy voice sounds is so good. And holy shit the build up to the extreme future bass instrumental and thundering final chorus is literally insane??? I love it, gives me that buzz

**CarlieScion** (10): THE BUILD UP IN THIS IS FANTASTIC!!!! love the breakdown. queen of experimenting with song structure

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i won’t be surprise if this song is hated on but this song is a MASTERPIECE. this is my personal favorite on the album and is my second choice for an 11. the raspiness of her voice in the chorus really hits me and the breakdown midway through...the first time i heard that i was absolutely bald. definitely my favorite sigrid song

**kappyko** (10): period

**turtle-thief** (10): There is so much going on but in a good way.

**waluigiest** (10): I was really vibing and then the climax hit and I fell more in love. This song is a gorgeous slow burn I love it so much

**flutemytoot** (9): this song is ok UNTIL THE SYNTHS AT THE END AND I GET MY LOIFE

**nick1372** (9): I like how raw this feels. Uses her voice in a really unique way.

**nooodisaster** (9): This is the definition of a snap. He REALLY thought she would give her heart in vain, smdh....

**shesdoingyoga** (9): The emotion in her voice elevates the song.  I feel like some people don’t like how the production changes at the end, but I like it and think it works with the story the song is telling.  I just wish there was more going on with vocals at the drop in the bridge

**rickikardashian** (8.5): it took it a second to get there, but once it arrived, **IT ARRIVED**

**Arybeck67** (8): Sigrid’s vocals earn this score

**vayyiqra** (8): Yes I know we're balladophobic and the avocadies really jump out on this track, but the album needs it as a breather after all the electro bangers in the first half. Also the bridge is kind of cute and when the drums and synth finally come in, it makes the first half of the song worth it.

**1998tweety** (7.5): I'm bored, I don't care enough about her voice for a ballad, thankfully the production came through at the end.

**ManofOranges** (7.5): Was a 5 at the beginning but by the end it picks up and gets good so it gets some bonus points for that.

**mrmeepz** (7.5): I like the passionate singing. I think it’s my favorite lyrically. I wish they would have used live drums, though

**DaBigBoi** (7): The raw delivery in her voice is brimming with emotion that is also presented in the lyrics. The drop later on is a bit questionable but by no means ruins the song.

**skargardin** (7): Cute

**walkedoffanoldme** (7): this song gets progressively better as time goes on

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): okay the first half of this is bad i don't like no no but that little "give it give it up give it give it up baby" into the outro is so cute i like it a lot

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): While I like the intensity of her vocals, I just don't think the song works until the very end and by then, I've lost interest

**untutorable** (6): more like "in pain" because it sounds like she's hurting her throat here

**WeastofEden44** (6): *Rupaul voice* meh

**Stryxen** (5.1): ...anyway did anyone listen to her cover of go your own way? talent

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): While I usually like Sigrid's vocals, here she sounds awfully grating.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): sigrid PLEASE you’re making me want to clear my throat

**vayyiqra** (7): KP should probably rebrand as an R&B act since that's what she does best, but that would never work because she's way too white.

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Pretty one-note and middle of the road.

**nooodisaster** (5): I really can't take this midtempo shit for much longer.

**skargardin** (5): I feel like this song has already been on the album.

MrSwearword: ONE MORE CHOP for today...as it stands, King Princess has now tied with Bionic and Prism [if that one serves memory right] at having 4 songs left by the end of Day 1.

If the next chop is KP again, she'll become the worst performing Day 1 artist of recent memory

Tim McGraw is not my favorite Taylor Swift song. And I think this cover probably isn't as good as Taylor's version.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): queen of choosing one of taylor's best songs to cover. I will be upset if this wins though

**nooodisaster** (10): Yo this is actually sooooo good and beats the original. Maggie's voice makes anything sparkle, but her production is the actual genius here, adding climaxes and valleys the original only hinted at.

**redgold51** (10): My favorite cover of any song ever

**wavingwolves** (10): ended taylor's career!

**cubascastrodistrict** (9): great spin on an amazing song.

**waluigiest** (9): it’s almost like.... Jack Antonoff produced the original? I like it

**suffocatedbears** (8.5): the 1989 remix we deserve

**1998tweety** (8): A queen covering a queen

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): I didn't think a Taylor Swift song would necessarily fit Maggie's vibe but she really makes the song her own.

**walkedoffanoldme** (8): make some noise swifties

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): I like that she managed to put her own spin on the song while still keeping some elements reminiscent of the original

**ReallyCreative** (7): a good cover of a bad song

**WeastofEden44** (7): This is good. Nothing unbelievable, but it's a very nice interpretation of the original

**Stryxen** (6.5): I like it

**bespectacIed** (6): taylor swift comment

**ManofOranges** (6): Charming but not thrilling.

**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): cute attempt but taylor did it better

**CarlieScion** (5): this cover is NOT that good

**skargardin** (4): Something about the faster tempo of this cover really isn't appealing to me. I'll just go listen to the original..

**vayyiqra** (4): Given this isn't her song and I don't care for the original, I would not miss this if it had been left out. It's just okay.

I am a basic white girl at the center of my little queer heart so this song sings to me. The hook is simple and charming with the multiple layers of "nah-nah-nah"s and the short acoutisc bridge is cute too. Buckle up tomrrow, because it's mostly hits and robberies from here on out.

---

**CarlieScion** (10): this song is so CUTE and also relatable!!! the 'acoustic' bridge makes me go uwu

**DaBigBoi** (10): Anything but basic! Idk about the rest of you, but the lyrical content here was not something I expected.

**nick1372** (10): god I want a boyfriend

**nooodisaster** (10): The little choir of Toads in the background of the chorus brings this to 11. Holy SHIT this is an earworm. The lyrics are wonderfully awkward yet honest, and so specific yet universal.

**waluigiest** (10): excellent, I love how the highs and lows of the orchestration and dynamics match the lyrical content. A serve.

**ReallyCreative** (9): Sigrid just loves these powerhouse choruses where she can kinda wail or make some kind of bizarre noise and I'm living

**rickikardashian** (9): that "nananananana" in the background has been stuck in my head for MONTHS and I couldn't remember where it was from. thank God for this rate because I was going crazy

**shesdoingyoga** (9): I really like this one but the vocal effect on the chorus after the bridge feels unnecessary

**vayyiqra** (9): Sometimes being a little basic is a good thing. Imagine if we were all acidic, all the time. We need both to achieve the nearly-neutral pH of the human body.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Big bop

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): i usually don’t like “na na na na” parts in songs but i loved it in this

**ManofOranges** (8): A bit basic, but still good.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): i wish i didn't hate the word basic so much because this song is a banger but the word rly drives me nuts

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): I'm very ambivalent towards this depending on my mood.

**kappyko** (7): kinda stupid but w/e and i like the acoustic part serves a star is born teas

**skargardin** (7): basic

**Stryxen** (7): she made many points with the voice filter? on the final pre-chorus idk what to call it

**Arybeck67** (6.5): this song is tbh kind of bland and cliches and the chorus doesn’t really flow like it should

**bespectacIed** (5): Meh song but the beat and hook are good. When you name your song "basic" you're practically setting yourself up

**JulioGrandeur** (4): song title checks out

**wavingwolves** (4): she made it way too easy to drag this song so i'm not even gonna bother

**Awkward\_King** (3): the title fits.
