I can see why this wasn't on the album. But honestly, it's still an okay dance track.

---

**JulioGrandeur** (10): This was such great transition between her EP and her debut. The musicality, the vocals, the taste.

**xaviersi** (10): Pacing of this song is perfection. I feel like relaxed but accomplished and being driven somewhere.

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): The tempo and drive to this one is great, it's missing something but it's still really good

**1998tweety** (8.5): Bops a fair bit

**nooodisaster** (8.5): A serve wow.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): I don’t know where this song came from, but I have it on my playlist and it’s good.

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This feels noticeably different than everything else I’ve heard from her but I still like it

**ManofOranges** (7): The weird kind of breathing element that's going during the song scares me just a little bit

**TinosCallingMeOver** (7): Good. The breathing as part of the percussion is cool.

**vayyiqra** (7): It's not amazing but I like this a lot more than her other bonus tracks in this rate.

**WeastofEden44** (7): This bops, like everything else she does

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): coming for selena’s bag with that asmr breathing on the verses

**Stryxen** (6): a fairly decent song released by Maggie Rogers

**cubascastrodistrict** (5): I’m glad Maggie didn’t stick with this direction.

**bespectacIed** (3): boringttt

Another ballad out, I think they're all gone by now. This is fairly workable for Sigrid, but it feels like it kept other, better songs from the Raw EP from being included on the album.

---

**CarlieScion** (10): once again, her vocals!!!! the emotions!!! this is such a gorgeous ballad and i will COME at anyone who tells me differently

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): DON'T YOU DARE ROB THIS! It's an exceptional ballad that speaks to me on countless levels.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): when spectrumpulse said this was the 4th best song of 2019, he kinda snapped

**Stryxen** (10): in vain WISHES it had this

**JulioGrandeur** (9): love that the closer really shows off her voice. great choice

**ReallyCreative** (9): I'm not usually a fan of these slower piano tracks being the closing song, but at the same time it's hard not to love this track's tenderness.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This ballad as a closer after an album of bops proves that Sigrid does, in fact, have the range

**waluigiest** (9): halsey could absolutely never

**1998tweety** (8): It's cute, a decent closer to a decent album.

**ManofOranges** (8): I like this song but I don't love it. Is it because it's just a piano ballad? I think so!

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): For a song called 'Dynamite', this is a very gentle track. Jokes aside, the acoustic live performance of this on Youtube is really beautiful. 'You see my red as blue' is so simple but so evocative.

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): a cute closer. her voice is gorgeous on this

**bespectacIed** (7): For a song called Dynamite. imagine how frustrated I am that it's a ballad. It's actually beautiful, the emotions are believable and heartfelt, but ughhh ballad closers are so cliche

**cremeebrulee** (7): sorry i am just not a ballad person but this is still pretty ig!

**mrmeepz** (7): Nice way to end the album

**nooodisaster** (7): why does this song make me think of the Sonic the Hedgehog movie.

**vayyiqra** (7): I bet nobody expected a song with this title to be a gentle ballad but it's a good one and ballads are often most effective as closing tracks. I said earlier I don't tend to like piano ballads but I like this one.

**WeastofEden44** (7): It's a cute song, but I don't think it was a fitting closer. It's just such a sonic departure from the rest of the album imo.

**nick1372** (6): kinda boring

**redgold51** (3): She has so many other songs that were more deserving to go on the album

I feel like this is an interesting song. The rolling organ in the instrumental should be irritating, but it somehow isn't. Overall, it feels very soothing, and the verses feel like a good showcase of Mag's songwriting.

---

**kappyko** (10): a former 11 that gives me goosebumps and tears lol

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): when fantano said this was the worst song on the album i died a little

**turtle-thief** (10): The falling trees, birds, insects and wind sounds used in here, ugh her mind.

**WeastofEden44** (10): Queen of dichotomy

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): I can vibe to it

**1998tweety** (8): This is still a good song but it's def my least fav so far.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): i could’ve done without the piano in the background, but otherwise this song was amazing. the chorus is so good and catchy

**flutemytoot** (8): this song is very fun to belt in the shower

**nooodisaster** (8): Onff

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): The way the disorienting syncopation of the percussion in the verses switches into the rhythm of the choruses perfectly matches the lyrical themes of feeling disoriented and lost, but then grounded when you're with the other person.

**waluigiest** (8): really juicy ideas, if not a bit clumsy

**Arybeck67** (7.5): tbh the only Maggie song I don’t really vibe with. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a great song, I’ve just never had a real connection to it like I’ve had with her other songs.

**rotating3Dtext** (7): tbh I didn’t expect this song to be in the album, but I’m glad it is

**shesdoingyoga** (7): This one is definitely the least memorable from the album for me but not a bad song

**vayyiqra** (7): A kind of mid-tier cut on this album but it has a catchy chorus.

**bespectacIed** (6): forgettable but cute

**ManofOranges** (6): I honestly don't even remember this song that well I just remember that it happens in the album but I don't even remember the hook.

**Stryxen** (5): Had to listen to this a few times

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): the quality of the other two albums in this rate

**CarlieScion** (4): i still fucking hate the noises during the chorus, sorry not sorry

I swear if I don't hear this song in a commercial for OkayCupid or something by the end of the year, I don't know why it was written. I think it is very good, but it also feels very consumer friendly (sans the "cut off all these hoes")

---

**nick1372** (10): gay pining always fucking gets me huh

**turtle-thief** (10): Those verses are so magical and smooth.

**bespectacIed** (9): A gem in this album, this is actually so good

**1998tweety** (8.5): I think I like this tbh, oop

**CarlieScion** (8): cuuuuute

**Stryxen** (8): hits different

**plantp0wer** (7.5): Probably my fave song on the album, the simple guitar works so well

**Arybeck67** (7): boringgggggg

**ManofOranges** (7): This is pleasant enough.

**shesdoingyoga** (7): This isn’t bad but this is the point in the album where I start to get bored of every song being slower and a similar energy

**WeastofEden44** (7): This is good, I'll listen to it here and there

**DaHumanTorch** (6): it was cute...but also pretty boring

**ImADudeDuh** (6): separate queen

**nooodisaster** (6): all humans rn bc of coronavirus

**vayyiqra** (6): Apparently this is meant to be a sad lesbian love song but I am not getting that vibe from it. Instead I'm getting a sort of enjoyable but very mid pop song.

This is cute, and also the first of two songs on Sigrid's album I think sound like Christmas music. The strings in this are really nice, too.

---

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I wish I could relate to this piece of poptimism.

**kappyko** (10): FUCK

**Stryxen** (10): flawless, strings sound like they're ripped straight from the sims

**turtle-thief** (10): My new favorite song.

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): i know i called all of sigrids songs bangers but this is also a banger

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): The strings in this song are fantastic, and I’m a sucker for lyrics about touring and performing

**DaHumanTorch** (9): this has major disney movie vibes, i love it

**nick1372** (9): best production on the album!!

**rickikardashian** (9): homegirl truly made a full on symphonic song about how grateful she is to be able to get on stage and do her music, I love her

**xosam** (9): another catchy & cute song, for sure the top song for me across the 3 albums

**Arybeck67** (8.5): ok the production on this slaps, I really like this

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): this is Lady Gaga - Applause but not self centered

**1998tweety** (8): The instrumentals on this is great but everything else is doing a poor job keeping up.

**CarlieScion** (8): someone told me this sounded like a disney song and now i cant stop imagining this in some shitty cartoon musical. this song was a 10 but it got overplayed to HELL on the radio @ work

**nooodisaster** (8): I keep wanting to like this song MORE, bc the hooks and production feels like a 10. But I think I just can't relate or something basic af. "The airline lost my luggage; still got all this weight" is hilarious tho and unironically what Katy Perry wishes her songwriting was.

**vayyiqra** (8): Energetic pop songs with strings also big good.

**waluigiest** (8): most of the strings work but some are corny

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): the details in some of the harmonies/backing vocals save this track from being straight filler

**ManofOranges** (7): Cute if not a teensy bit forgettable.

**WeastofEden44** (7): The strings on this are just *chef's kiss*

**mrmeepz** (6): The strings and beat don’t do much for me, but I like the additional drums at the end

**skargardin** (6): also fine

**bespectacIed** (4): Those strings are cute, very Viva La Vida, but song's kinda filler

**JulioGrandeur** (4): not this

**walkedoffanoldme** (4): this song sounds like the soundtrack to a coming of age movie that does alright in select theaters

This is certainly not where I thought this would go out. It might be kind of basic, but I like the production (which samples and flips an anti-lesbian PSA) and the lyrics feel fiarly relatable and queer.

---

**flutemytoot** (11): FANTASTIC. the anti-lez psa used as a sample? GENIUS. the weird organ (??) riff used throughout the song? SO SMOOOOOTH. mikky's voice? ORGASMIC. I'll probably change my mind about my choice of 11 literally a minute after submitting this rate, but I gotta give the title track of the most underrated album ever some respect.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this was one of my most played songs for a long long while. i don't love it as much as i used to but i think i just played it so much it lost some of that spark but it's still one of my favorites. i love the video a lot though still

**bespectacIed** (10): This mv's aesthetic and the "i look innocent but I'm a bad girl" theme, i hate it so much, damn billie for popularizing it. But this song slaps, the chorus is brilliant, THE PRODUCTION IS FLAWLESS, holy hell. I'm not mad if this wins.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The only song of hers along with PIG (lmao, what a silly acronym) I've heard before doing the rate. I really like this and I've been using it as the standard for a King Princess 10 in this rate. Spoiler alert: only one other song has reached that mark.

**mudkip1** (10): my favorite song of hers

**JulioGrandeur** (9.5): this is what i like. Wish it was longer though (if i had a dime for every time i ~~heard~~ said that)

**DaHumanTorch** (9): the chorus of this was so good and catchy, and i loved the way it came in kind of suddenly without a prechorus, it didn’t really need it. i could’ve done with the talking bit at the end but it was only a few seconds so whatever

**nooodisaster** (9): A grower, but ended strong. "I can make grown men cry" is just bad bitch energy, I'm sorry. Also someone tell Pharrell this is how you use a repeating sample.

**waluigiest** (9): subtle bop

**WeastofEden44** (9): Unlike her, I can actually relate to this song

**Stryxen** (8.5): lofi/hip hop beats to whore/throw it back to

**ImADudeDuh** (8): cheap queen

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's vibey but I don't have a lot else to say about it

**rotating3Dtext** (8): I wish it was more memorable

**shesdoingyoga** (8): Another song in this rate that I didn’t realize was under three minutes because it works well as the length it is.  Unfortunately, this is one of the only songs on this album that works at under three minutes

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): Interesting use of samples, unpredictable backing chords with a catchy chorus.

**Roxieloxie** (7.3): Kinda mad that this rate is full of songs i feel like i've heard in a publix supermarket but cant place

**1998tweety** (7): I'm so bored

**mrmeepz** (6.5): The usage of samples is pretty nice

**Arybeck67** (6): goddammit I really like the production again, but the lyrics just take me out of it oof

**nick1372** (6): honestly it's a great album title but a mediocre song. "I can be good sometimes, I can be bad sometimes" isn't a great song thesis

**vayyiqra** (6): It's kind of a vibe but all this reverb sounds like it's coming from underwater and the retro sounds on this album are not doing it for me.

**CarlieScion** (5): the layering in the chorus annoys me a lot, but the verses are cute ig

**ManofOranges** (4): I'm kinda bored by this it just doesn't go anyway. Also the majority of the times there are like recording soundbytes in a song I immediately tend to be dissuaded from liking it and this is no exception.

This might be Sigrid's first purely synthpop song to go out. The verses leave a little room for improvement, but the chorus is what makes this song a straight up bop.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This was very close to getting my 11.  I love the pulsing production and the “crying in the club” vibe

**flutemytoot** (9.9): i haven't listened to this enough to give it a 10...but it's probably getting robbed, that 80's-esque synth is sexyyy

**Arybeck67** (9.3): relatable shit, I had a relationship just like this with my former male best friend so...oof

**1998tweety** (9): I really don't care for her voice but good lorde the production on her songs is immaculate, this is giving me Style vibes. I'm so angry this stupid bitch wastes it on a 2-word chorus.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): i love the groovy, 80s sounding bass-line in the production. a bop

**Stryxen** (9): and that's kinda on periodt

**vayyiqra** (9): Another 80s LARP but a good one. In fact this is a hidden gem, I'd even argue. I love pulsating synths and the beat is hypnotic.

**bespectacIed** (8): Reminds me of Style/Getaway Car so much with the production. Cute chorus.

**ManofOranges** (8): This song is fairly good but it's not as good as the other song with the word "mine" in the title.

**nooodisaster** (8): "Between me and you, I'd watch your back". Is she gonna assassinate this man??

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): Subtle bass in the verses is great. I like the 80s-late-night-feeling from this song – faint shades of 'Into You' and HAIM in this?

**nick1372** (7): she put a song called "never mine" after a song called "mine right now"... her mind

**kappyko** (6): this is really basic

**mrmeepz** (6): I kinda dislike the chorus, but the instrumental and the outro is cool

**skargardin** (5): A bit irritating ngl

This feels kinda darker and more sultry than the other tracks on this album. The production is cool with the cash register noises and prominent bass. The guitar could maybe be a little more prominent, but I like how it comes in in the outro.

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): SHE SERVED, the change up halfway through the song came for my throat and the video is a serve this is why i love her

**flutemytoot** (10): also a close contender for my 11, there's so many little details in this song I love, like the cash register noise in the chorus, the percussion is so good all the way through, i just really like this song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): focused queen

**kappyko** (10): probably the best usage of KP's powers but if this wins im gonna scream.

**nick1372** (10): that chorus...

**TinosCallingMeOver** (10): Such a good groove. I feel very sophisticated listening to this for some reason.

**turtle-thief** (10): idk where i am when this song ends.

**wavingwolves** (10): i'm sorry but why this sounds like sex to me

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): I love the blend of influences going on here, the raspy vocals are really well supported, and the blossoming of sounds at the end just wraps everything else up so well

**1998tweety** (9): This is lowkey giving my Ultraviolence vibes and I love it for that

**CarlieScion** (9): a vibe

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Enjoyable enough to stand out.

**ManofOranges** (9): Finally a full length song that I actually really like on this album. It doesn't quite merit a 10 from me but it comes pretty close.

**WeastofEden44** (9): Outsold Jesus

**bespectacIed** (8): bop

**nooodisaster** (8): YES!.chadmichaels   So funky; drags a little in the middle but overall a snap.

**Stryxen** (8): these vibes are impeccable

**mrmeepz** (7.5): Smooth and cool song, just wish it had longer verses

**Arybeck67** (7): this is getting annoying now. Great production, but the rest of it is soooooo boring

**Roxieloxie** (7): I dont think im enough of an indie wuh luh wuh to enjoy this album

**vayyiqra** (7): I kind of like the R&B-ish feel to this song. In fact I vibe with it more than anything else on the album so far.

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): that last minute with the guitar saved the song

**shesdoingyoga** (6.5): I can tell it should be a good song but by this point in the album I would say I’m officially bored of every song being slower and a similar energy, which makes the song harder to enjoy.  I shouldn’t be this bored by the halfway point of the album.  I like the guitar use at least.

I saw King Princess perform live earlier this year, in the pre-lockdown times. It was an interesting situation, mainly because I seemed to be one of only 5% of men in the audience, with the rest made up of an adoring army of lesbian stans. Anyways, even the album tracks had a lot more hard driving guitar like this track when she did them live. And she finished her encore with this song, and it is a hell of a way to end the night.

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): if we were doing the deluxe version and this was in the main rate this would be my 11 no question

**CritneySpearz** (10): ohio gays being fed, you love to see it

**ManofOranges** (10): Ok now this is just a straight up serve. Shame this isn't in the actual rate I would actually consider giving this my 11. Also in the music video she is serving.

**nick1372** (10): WHERE IS THE FULL ROCK ALBUM MISS KING

**skargardin** (10): Where was this type of energy on the standard edition of the album?! I LOVE THIS

**turtle-thief** (10): Her next album better go as hard as this cause i need more gay garage rock in my life.

**wavingwolves** (10): i love rock! i have no idea why this is just a bonus track on her album when it's better than most of the songs featured in the regular version

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): I was not expecting this from her and I am not mad about it

**bespectacIed** (9): "that was a good one" tea

**cubascastrodistrict** (9): where was this energy on the album?

**waluigiest** (9): the worst state tbh but WOW this went OFF a few minutes in

**bbfan132** (8.5): king princess going psych rock is something i never knew i needed but am eternally grateful for

**1998tweety** (8): The guitar on this is nice.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): that switch up to the loud guitar caught me off guard. i liked this a lot, i wish it made it onto the standard edition

**ReallyCreative** (8): It's a jam but it's not really a song I'd go back to super often

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): Love the rock vibes.

**Stryxen** (6.9): you have to watch the video

**nooodisaster** (5): Having lived in Ohio, it's way less dramatic than this.

**vayyiqra** (4): I'm being generous here because this is a boring song and I am feeling very done with this rate, so luckily it's over.

I think this song is very good lyrically and vocally. It's really what reminds me of older singer / songwriter queens like Janice Joplin or Carloe King. Their influence shows and I think Maggie is a good heir to them.

---

**shhhneak** (11): that high note scream gives me chills every time.

**Arybeck67** (10): the Stevie Nicks lyric feature bumped this song up a point

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Perfection. My loyalty to Sigrid prevents me from giving this the 11, but I would be just as happy if Retrograde wins this rate. It's absolutely incredible from the first beat until the end.

**flutemytoot** (10): The first Maggie song I ever heard! For months I was like *"hm Retrograde is really good maybe I should listen to the rest"* and then didn't and tbh I hate myself for it

**kappyko** (10): i cried to this song lol

**ManofOranges** (10): Really just love the way she sings here, it's takes me beyond.

**nick1372** (10): the way she wails "AIIIIII" is amazing

**nooodisaster** (10): From the first moment of this song you know... it's a BOP.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): im a virgo leo cusp i think i's why im depressed

**1998tweety** (9): She just keeps serving huh...wish the chorus punched a little more but it's cute.

**bespectacIed** (9): Great instrumentation, great vocals, cute lyrics, we only like it because it's an astrology buzzword title but that's ok

**Roxieloxie** (9): mercury is shaking

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): I love the production and her vocals on the second verse, but I think the chorus doesn’t fit with the verses as well as it could

**DaBigBoi** (8): Her voice sounds crisp and nice here. The beats added on the guitar also add some sense of urgency much needed in this album.

**JulioGrandeur** (8): she's really showing off her voice in this track and its much appreciated.

**mrmeepz** (8): I love the guitar in the chorus and the overall production of the song. Her vocal reach in the second verse is amazing

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): A bop

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this was on track to be a 10 but those guitars on the chorus sound AWFUL

**Stryxen** (7): there's just something about that song...

**vayyiqra** (7): ~~haha my mercury is totally in gatorade~~ Another *aggressively* radio-friendly-alt-pop song but also it's good.

**waluigiest** (7): this reminds me of Misterwives in a weird way

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): this is one of the times in the album where the quality dips a bit for me. the production in the chorus is just too busy for me. i don’t dislike it though, it’s still a cute enjoyable bop

A very soothing early track from Maggie. Not top tier, but was definitely a good showcase from her EP.

---

**Arybeck67** (10): here’s my 11 guys. This song to me is the peak of Maggie being able to combine folk and pop into one song. It’s such a gorgeous song, with nature samples and electronica becoming one. Just perfection!

**cubascastrodistrict** (10): this really should’ve been on the album.

**letsallpoo** (10): i will NEVER forgive her for leaving this off the album

**turtle-thief** (10): My 11 if it was in the main rate. Hot take but this song should replace "Graduation (friends forever)".

**1998tweety** (9.5): Florence outsold but this is still cute.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Maggie really could have picked any songs from this EP to put on her album and chose Alaska and On + Off over this?

**DaHumanTorch** (8): this should’ve been on the album. period.

**nick1372** (8): something really calming about this one

**TinosCallingMeOver** (8): I love the lightness of the track as a whole and the sampling of natural sounds as part of the mix. It's wistful and warm in a way that is comforting in a similar feeling to that which The Paper Kites and The Japanese House invoke.

**wavingwolves** (8): i love her voice in this ugh!! so good

**WeastofEden44** (8): This is gonna be all too relatable fairly soon for me lol

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): It's good, but it doesn't really match the level some of Maggie's similar songs put out.

**nooodisaster** (7): Dogs are my 11.

**Stryxen** (6.5): a decent song released by Maggie Rogers

**bespectacIed** (6): sounds like 75% of maggie's discography

**vayyiqra** (5): I've never heard this before and it's okay, but sounds very much like it could be any other Maggie Rogers song.

**ManofOranges** (4): It kinda bored me I'm not lying.

you can just feel the emotion coming out of these lyrics. I also really like the production, whith maggies layered chanting, the piano, and the other various random seeming instruments scattered throughout.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): DAE think the songwriting here is mindblowingly good? The song is groovy but it's actually sad/helpless when you really listen to it. Brilliant song, this should win.

**cremeebrulee** (10): ok three songs in and she hasn't missed once

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the way she referenced “give a little” and sang it the same way as the song...her mind

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): AFTER DARK, AFTER LIGHT (x24).

**flutemytoot** (10): bassline turns me on

**ManofOranges** (10): A while back a friend of mine recommended that I listen to Maggie Rogers and this was the song she suggested that I heard first and.... if I'm being perfectly honest I wasn't in love with. It was only after coming back after all that time to do this rate that I really appreciate this song.

**mudkip1** (10): bop

**turtle-thief** (10): Friendship songs are the best songs, and that's how sue Cs it.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): She does a lot with her voice on this track that I enjoy

**Arybeck67** (9): oh maybe I’m crazy, maybe you know...but this song is great 🥳

**TinosCallingMeOver** (9): I looooove how the lyrics bounce their way across the backing production in this track, like in the lines 'And I know and I know and I know/ That maybe we should take some time/ Get this out, make this right'.

**xaviersi** (9): These lyrics make me feel like I wouldn't be judged for anything I told her

**1998tweety** (8.5): A little forgettable among the rest of the tracks, but it's still a big bop.

**vayyiqra** (8): One of the musically interesting tracks on this album, a real bop. Listen closely to the instrumental track and notice how well it's put together.

**waluigiest** (8): so slick!

**mrmeepz** (7.5): Really nice bassline at the start. The pre-chorus is so good

**nooodisaster** (7): "The knife of insight" sounds kinda kinky..

The hand claps are cute. Lyrically it feels very happy, and I really like the more dancable songs on Mag's album like this too.

**walkedoffanoldme** (11): early use of my 11 but I can't express how much I love this song other than saying I feel it in my veins

**DaHumanTorch** (10): so good...that outro ugh

**flutemytoot** (10): VERY close contender for my 11, that synth riff is a super catchy start to the album

**kappyko** (10): god bless maggie rogers

**ReallyCreative** (10): Amazing opening track and strong consideration for my 11

**TinosCallingMeOver** (10): Spring vibes, great to strut to, and a cracker of a music video to match! And the sibillance in the line 'Soak in all the sweetness on our skin' is just delicious.

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): a great opener! had this on repeat for a while

**mrmeepz** (9.5): This song just makes me happy. Love the production and lyrics, just great

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): There are so many little details in the song that I like, a perfect opener

**Roxieloxie** (9.3): This is a cute opener, I can grove to it

**1998tweety** (9): Big bop, the chorus could be a bit better, but the rest of the song is solid.

**bespectacIed** (9): I know it's been said before but this is very Haim - Something to Tell You (an album I enjoy). I love it, especially the jingly jangly chorus.

**waluigiest** (9): excellent introduction to this album full of medium bops to dance to in your kitchen

**Arybeck67** (8.9): hella relevant to what’s going on right now. JUST GIVE A LITTLE!

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): the song that got me into maggie

**CarlieScion** (8): this song makes me feel COZY af

**ImADudeDuh** (8): i appreciate the sentiment more than i like the song

**vayyiqra** (8): So wholesome and such a good message behind it :pensive: What a good opener.

**WeastofEden44** (8): Really cute bop. I wish the lyrics were a little more substantial, but it's soooo great sonically

**DaBigBoi** (7.5): Wish she gave a little more, but this is still nice!

**cubascastrodistrict** (7): good opener for the album. A really good song but I honestly wish she hadn’t used Greg Kurstin, to me it makes this song feel less unique even though I think Maggie is a really unique artist.

**ManofOranges** (7): Cute opener but it's one of the weaker songs on the album.

**nick1372** (7): A solid tune but it comes across a bit like a generic "we all need to love each other" anthem

**nooodisaster** (6): I'm not gagged, okay? It's cute and works as an intro to her amazing voice and her musical POV, but it's just cute.

**Stryxen** (6): don't be shy give a little

I thought this was going to be a lot closer to Past Life in terms of score. But to see them go out start of Day 1 and end of Day 2 surprised me. If I had to guess, this one seems to have more elaborate production, and the vocals maybe slay a little better.

---

**FreebieFresh** (11): one of the best songs ever written imo

**JulioGrandeur** (11): my wig is labeled "property of Maggie"

**turtle-thief** (11): This is the type of song artists look for their entire careers, and Maggie not only found it but she wrote it and produced it. Also, this is the fisrt time i hear the rain in the outro and i can't believe i could love this song even more.

**1998tweety** (10): Fuck me up, the way that chorus kicks in UGH, comes in perfectly.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i lose it everytime that chorus comes in after the electronic-ish production in the prechorus. something about her voice just hits me

**kappyko** (10): i almost cried to this song lol

**ManofOranges** (10): Holy FUCKKK this song is soooooo god damn good I nearly gave this my 11 too it's such a great banger. I probably appreciate it's quality even more seeing as how it comes after past life.

**mudkip1** (10): this chorus ugh yes

**Stryxen** (10): damn I gotta get a boyfriend

**walkedoffanoldme** (10): this song makes me want to lay in an open field in the middle of the night and have an existential crisis

**Arybeck67** (9.5): I cannot fall in love with you...once again, Maggie being relatable asf

**cubascastrodistrict** (9): Love this song. Really beautiful production, great lyrics, another one of the songs on this album that makes me really excited for Maggie’s next project.

**nooodisaster** (9): Yeah, we love a rate winner. The chorus is just popheads crack, and honestly makes me think this shoulda been bigger. My only problem are the verses that feel like they just sort of happen.

**ReallyCreative** (9): A spiritual twin to Alaska but a little more uptempo

**mrmeepz** (8.5): Production-wise a great standout. Her voice sounds heavenly

**xosam** (8.5): Very cute & catchy, my personal favourite from the album

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): It’s good but almost feels a bit out of place on the album to me

**bespectacIed** (7): What is an jorja smith song doing here??? Can't comprehend this song's popularity, it's kinda basique. Amazing final chorus, i admit.

**CarlieScion** (7): cuuuute

**vayyiqra** (7): I did not expect Maggie Rogers the bananies-and-avocadies indie-pop girl to make a track that sounds almost like 90s R&B and yet it exists and it's good.

**flutemytoot** (6): This is the only song I don't really fw from the album!! I won't skip it if I'm listening to the full album but it's the only song I don't listen to in other contexts

**TinosCallingMeOver** (6): I do sometimes skip this one, but the chorus is great.

Overall I think this is a very good song, bar one thing. The *SHOTS FIRED* in the chorus is kinda grating to me. but otherwise, it's a good complement to Don't Kill My Vibe.

---

**CarlieScion** (10): a fucking 11

**DaHumanTorch** (10): SHOTS FIRED !!!

**ManofOranges** (10): SHOTS FIRED

**nick1372** (10): this should have made the album!!

**nooodisaster** (10): YESSS!! Her voice is at its career peak here, burning anything in its path with its raw husk. My personal favorite, such a shame it didn't make the album.

**skargardin** (10): Deserved to be a proper single and to be on the album tbh. I loved it from the instant it released, ugh one of my favorite Sigrid songs. SHOTS FIRED!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): absolutely robbed from being on the album

**1998tweety** (9.5): Bop, robbed of being on the album

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): S H O T S F I R E D

**bespectacIed** (9): One of my first Sigrid songs ... yeah this song shows how young Sigrid started because the lyrics are so fucking cringey and so 2016 ... but i genuinely love this lmaooo i have bopped to this so much. We should have rated Schedules

**vayyiqra** (8): It's not anything standout from anything on *Sucker Punch*, but then that's my favourite album in this rate, so that's a good thing. As well, I said earlier that I have a weakness for pop girls who yell random adlibs. :kimbryell:

**TinosCallingMeOver** (7): Feels like a Halsey or Kesha track?

**wavingwolves** (5): this is just like every other sigrid song: extremely okay and only that

**Stryxen** (2): if she released this in 2020 I would unstan but she do be lookin kinda cute in the music video tho

This track is just super interesting musically. It's kind of a dance track, does interesting things with it's production, and is unabashedly queer and open about sex. It does what the other girls aren't.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): Her absolute best song, it's insane how smooth and pristine the production of this song is. And the sample is galaxy brained. King Princess loves black pussy, she's a queen.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): for a third time now better than anything on the album. sis really dropped the ball with the album didn't she. hopefully she goes back to this quality on her sophomore effort

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): My favorite song of hers in the overall rate. I'm a Sigrid stan through and through, but KP kind of deserves to eat this methinks.

**flutemytoot** (10): haha pussy

**nick1372** (10): I'm a lesbian now

**rotating3Dtext** (10): greatest bop that I can’t listen to in public

**skargardin** (10): God I wish this song had been on the album. It fits thematically and would've added some much-needed spunk to the album.

**walkedoffanoldme** (10): this song is objectively incredible

**waluigiest** (10): the chorus is so groovy

**wavingwolves** (10): this is me about my own pussy

**Awkward\_King** (9): gay rites

**redgold51** (9): KP said Lesbian Rights

**shesdoingyoga** (9): If Cheap Queen had sounded more like the songs in the bonus rate I would have enjoyed it so much more, this is great

**ManofOranges** (8): I understand her opinion but I do not share her opinion.

**vayyiqra** (8): Never mind, this is probably her best song. KP is best when she's explicitly lesbian, since everyone knows that is the most interesting thing about her.

**1998tweety** (7.5): Misandristic, at least it bops a bit

**nooodisaster** (7): skkdskkksksksk

**Stryxen** (7): she just doesn't care lol I love her

**JulioGrandeur** (2): i'm all for singers talking about their no-no squares but i was *not* feeling this one
