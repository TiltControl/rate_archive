The last song on the Four Pink Walls EP and one of the more funky and overtly R&B inspired songs on this album which I think she pulls off really well. Like Seventeen this is a huge jam about growing up and her leaving her bedroom and realizing the world isn’t what she thought but this time it has much more of a positive effect on her

---
**awryj** (11): This track seems more ambitious than the others. It's cool that she experimented with this Janet Jackson-esque sound.

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): I actually love what a swingy bop this is! The chorus is such a unique earworm and overall this has a classic, fancy atmosphere that makes me want to skip through the lamp-lit streets of a large city at night. I wasn't expecting such a track to fit perfectly on an album about being a teenager, but here we are. This is probably one of the biggest pieces of evidence on Know-It-All that proves that Alessia has more potential past being a premature, Canadian Lorde clone.

**theNealCutter** (11): this is everything that makes Alessia Cara good. she has the charisma, the personality, that goddamned amazing eloquence that creates a very clear image, the authenticity that just sets her apart of her Post-Lorde peers. Everything here is so subtle, the guitar licks, the crooning backing vocals, that disc scratch, that smooth pad synth that sets the chill atmosphere, and that lo-fi hiphop beat that carries the song altogether. It's like everything was built just to fit each other. I hope her next album goes more on this sound.

---

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): eerie

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is such a smooth, slick track. I’m just in awe of how effortless she sounds on this song, she glides through it with no effort. This is swagger, people.

**SkyBlade79** (10): this sounds like a tori kelly song, nothing wrong with that. It’s very smooth and cute, and she actually has a lot of inflection in her voice this time. This is probably my favorite Alessia song

**twat\_brained** (10): This is a strong throwback to '00s r&b/soul artists and works incredibly well for Alessia here!

**mokitsu** (9.5): much like Here, this gives me 90's trip hop vibes, and i love it! so smooth.

**PossumAloysuis** (9.5): I remember when she dropped the EP before the album and the first thing that came to mind was what I wouldn't do to get inside those pink walls. Yeah I'm ashamed of myself too. Love the production and scratches tho

**Elitefourbrad** (9): I see this as a coming of age song and it’s a really great one! Alessia is queen of 4 pink walls.

**fifthchevron** (9): OK this coming after I'm Yours is freaking me out. It's scary how much I relate to both songs.

**gannade** (9): This song is pretty ambitious but ends up falling flat. I love the beat though as well as her attempt at recreating the magic of Here. It falls short, but it's a decent song in itself.

**lunasaflowers** (9): Alessia sounds so smooth in this hip-hop/R&B-style production! I love it.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (8.5): oo i love urban music x)

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): Reminds me of early Alicia Keys but without the overbearing piano.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.2): Love the use of the horns, and her delivery has a certain coolness and confidence to it. Her instincts when it comes to phrasing are great, especially compared to other singers her age. Honestly if the album consisted of songs like this, Outlaws, and Here it would be perfect.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (8): cool song

**dropthehammer11** (8): This is highkey hard as fuck

**ImADudeDuh** (8): This is way more R&B then I ever expected from Alessia.

**MashLuke** (8): this is old school-ish, I love this song's theme. She worked hard for being where she is now

**spaghettibread** (8): pretty good

**tooshorttoofast** (8): I love how confident she is in herself

**zamomattel** (8): These Corinne Bailey Rae teas

**banananaise** (7.5): I love the funk (or whatever you would call it) in the chorus

**blue\_charles** (7.5): The clearest example of Alessia's R&B influences and a complete bop because of it

**bwc222** (7.5): i like the sneaker screech @ 2:43

**jamesfog** (7.5): Kinda sounds like it came from 2004, not 2015.

**Mrachnie** (7.5): It's not very memorable but the instrumental sounds smooth af and she sounds very good.

**blueheart** (7): I expected more going into this song by the way people talked about it. Her fast singing in the verses is cool, but the chorus is nothing special.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (7): I’m amazed at how she wrote this all by herself. And the overall message is nice. However, the production could’ve used a little re-mixing for the album version.

**MrSwearword** (7): the beat does better work than expected but I can’t stand Alessia acting like she’s been through so much when I ask myself, “really? Do you have an idea what you’re singing?”

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): I don't know if I'm thinking of a specific song or not, but it really sounds like a Lily Allen song to me. Not good enough to be the title track though.

**strawberryswing1** (6.5): trying too hard to be an actual soul singer here

**OxfordSemicolon** (6): Alessia's better when she's doing the fast talk-sing thing, I think. It definitely sounds better than "waaa-aa-a-a-aa-aa-aals."

**shineflyer** (6): It's got a nice beat to it, but it kinda feels better as background music than as anything else.

**timothy444** (6): Somehow the intro is more memorable than the entire song.

**nooodisaster** (5.5): Too much midtempo. Don't make me listen to this again.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): the AATB sax is back nty

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): dear bing.com how do i make a song sound like here by alessia cara

**dirdbub** (4): love is four walls 너로 채운 mirror mirror love is four walls 신비로운 미로 미로 눈앞에 펴낸 문을 열어 조심스럽게 빛을 향해 발을 딛혀 and I had the answers but now they mean nothing 'cause these walls cau

**therokinrolla** (4): this is disgosting i thought this would be a masterbation bop but it isnt!

**cyborglilith** (1): Ok this is actually trash. I want to be able to give 2 zeros. But seriously, this doesn't even sound like Alessia! It's even worse than normal!!!

This song is the definition of an anthem. This is the song that made me stan Alessia. She exudes such confidence and reassurance in this song and it’s infectious. Idk if I can even call myself an outsider but when I hear this song I definitely am. It’s an anthem for everyone who was never perfect enough to be in the in crowd and I respect her for that.

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): major B O P

**cyborglilith** (10): I'm still cringing from hearing Four Trash Walls. Suddenly, this B O P that I forgot even existed appears to save me from Satan (who apparently isn't even the worst in this rate). Thanks, Alessia!

**Elitefourbrad** (10): This is that song! For the most part, I’m wild for sure. You’ll always find me at the wild clubs or the wild dinner parties. I feel like just dancing around naked to this song as I walk through the jungle.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): a bop

**mokitsu** (10): this song is so anthemic!

**Mrachnie** (10): This is probably the best song on the album. The lyrics flow together really well and it's SO catchy.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): I heard a Spotify ad of this once, and I really liked it. Listening to it in full, I'm even more impressed. A song like this could be so overdone at this point, but the melody and Alessia's carefree tone make this a more convincing teenage rebellion anthem than New Americana. And it's not even really edgy.

**theNealCutter** (10): this song was meant to be listened on earphones, I swear. That beat is just eargasmic. Anyway, I really love how it plays the "we're different" schtick. It's like that verse on SZA's Go Gina that goes "I belong to nobody/Hope it don't bother you/You could mind your business/I belong to nobody/Try not to disturb/And mind my business." It's like hey, we alright? we're just here if you need us. It goes to the feeling of all the older people trying to help us and guide us, and most of the time we don't want it because we're trying to be an adult now.

**therokinrolla** (10): still my fav from her, her lyricism in this song is on point and it flows smoothly from verse to verse. perfection

**tooshorttoofast** (10): first song I've heard from her and it still bops

**twat\_brained** (10): This actually makes me mad nostalgic for when I'd first hear it on the radio back in winter 2016. Due to Canadian laws I still hear it on the reg, but it's a Canadian song I can bop to and enjoy. And the video just makes the message resonate even further with me.

**dropthehammer11** (9): This song is so great. Should've been way bigger

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Those fun fluctuating “ayayayaaahhhs” on the chorus are a good touch because they evoke the sounds of children playing in the distance a la Peter Pan and it’s very effective. Alessia gets flack from haters for “being derivative of Lorde” or whatever, but honestly? Lorde ripped her off on this song, this came out two years before “Perfect Places” did and there are some very marked similarities. I’m not going to say which one is “better” (because for what it’s worth I like both of them for different reasons) but it bears mentioning. The music video makes me cringe though… Alessia the song is fire, but you clearly don’t know what you’re talking about in that “monologue.”

**Kaylaboe** (9): i love this campfire anthem

**OxfordSemicolon** (9): This is the best song on Know-It-All. It's like a version of "Here" that sounds better

**PossumAloysuis** (9): I don't know how this didn't do better on the radio. It's catchy as fuck.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): More angst, but it somehow works. The hook is very catchy.

**jamesfog** (8.5): Not as good as I remember from hearing it on the radio

**MashLuke** (8): I cried to this once, I don't know why.

**mustangs16** (8): i subtracted an entire point due to how hard i cringed at the intro to the video ngl

**nooodisaster** (8): The rhymes in this are actually pretty fire, and it's cute and catchy.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): www.askjeeves.com what is an 808

**spaghettibread** (7.9): alright

**ComeOnAndSlang** (7.5): beggars can’t be cHoosers bitcH tHis aint CHIPOTLE

**zamomattel** (7.5): his is alright but that Where The Wild Things Are film was absolutely shit, like the book should have been left as it was

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): there's nothing wrong with this song, it's just kinda there

**bwc222** (7): it's an ok song, but the "i'm a woke hipster teen" theme gets tiring

**blue\_charles** (6): I used to really like this track but honestly it's kinda stale and not Alessia's best writing

**blueheart** (6): I love [generic rebellious lyrics]

**shineflyer** (6): Maurice Sendak is shook.

**awryj** (5): BUT WE'RE DIFFERENT DAAAAD

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5): This is where the album starts to turn into...a generic pop album. I gave it an extra point because the background vocals are interesting and well done. Also, the nonconformist lyrical theme was already done better on "Here."

**strawberryswing1** (5): trying too hard to be deep here tbh

**dirdbub** (4.5): minus half a point for that line about 808s & Heartbreak TRACKLIST: 1. Say You Will 2. Welcome To Heartbreak 3. Heartless 4. Amazing 5. Love Lockdown 6. Paranoid 7. RoboCop 8. Street Lights 9. Bad News 10. See You In My Nightmares 11. Coldest Winter 12. Pinocchio Story Standard Edition Cov

**MrSwearword** (3): I think by this point in the album, the thing I can’t stomach is Alessia acting more badass than she is. Avril did “rebel” better and she was poser mall punk.

**SkyBlade79** (3): something seems so totally empty about this song. The production just isn’t satisfying… I can’t really point out what it is, but it feels like there is something just fundamentally missing from this song

**VeganSquash** (2): New Americana but worse

Jason Mraz who? I think this is a love song that is pretty unique. It’s all about her reluctance to falling in love again after being hurt so many times and eventually just giving in to this person. It’s not like she invented this new theme but it’s a breath of fresh air and I like her take on it

---
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): a bippity bopity bop

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): P E R F E C T First Alessia song I got addicted to.

**bluehxrizon** (10): should've been a single! i love the production on this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This one is cute, and I always laugh in the video for it when she throws her hat at her brother. The lyrics to this one are really fun, I love how passive aggressive and resentful she is of falling in love. She’s, like, pissed about it and she wants you to know, but it makes it more special when she finally gives in to it. The song is built around a very strong central image of her giving herself to someone, and so the bitter verses make a great contrast to the earnest chorus.

**Kaylaboe** (10): i can get over that she sounds like 2010-biebz here, because this is an anthem

**mustangs16** (10): this song is adorable

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): I was so surprised when I heard this song, because I wasn't expecting it to be so heartwarming. I'm Yours has so much emotion and love behind it, which is helped in no small part by Alessia's terrific delivery. A song like this can be associated with any kind of wonderful relationship, whether it's familial, platonic or romantic. It's the kind of song that makes me feel all fuzzy inside.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): One of the best pop songs I've heard in the last years.

**twat\_brained** (10): The music works really well and so does Alessia's voice! Probably not gonna be top 10 but I'd expect to see this at least go top 20

**spaghettibread** (9.8): near perfection

**fifthchevron** (9): This is me in relationships lol im shook. This song is actually beautiful, though.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): A nice song about being mad that someone made you fall in love with them.

**MashLuke** (9): This is so cute it's screaming: teenage drama film that ends with the 2 main characters kissing while it's raining, all happening in the high school parking lot with the main characters' best friends smiling and clapping around

**SkyBlade79** (9): really good production and nice heartfelt lyrics. Jason Mraz could never

**theNealCutter** (9): Imagine Outlaws, but better. google meaning for the word Kilig, because that's everything this song is. I love the incorporation of guitars in this song, making a more organic feeling of being in love after a long of being so afraid to fall in love. It's just so pink and blues and hearts and everything so sweet and metallic at the same time. Like eating a Hershey's Kisses but there's a bit of foil left. You kinda want to spit out the entire thing, but you don't want to waste all the sweetness. A perfect teenager love song.

**therokinrolla** (9): a BOP. and a cute one! Alessia’s specialty is cute bops and when she serves she SERVES

**jamesfog** (8.5): The video is cute lmao

**Mrachnie** (8.5): This probably has the best lyrics on the album yet. The instrumental on the verses is very good too, but then for some reason acoustic guitars come in and ruin the party.

**timothy444** (8.5): Wow, that chorus is orgasmic!

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): The instrumental is just really...compelling? Especially the pre, it exciting and just keeps pushing the song forward. I also loved the long as "falling again" around like the second chorus

**dropthehammer11** (8): Super cool song, love the use of guitars mixed with a very modern pop drop

**MrSwearword** (8): it can read as either “eww gross, feelings” or “Alanis songwriting for kids” but this is pretty good.

**lunasaflowers** (7.8): Aww, this is cute.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): The lyrics in both verses are a little too edgy for me, but the pre-chorus is fantastic. Overall an enjoyable song.

**VeganSquash** (7.5): I'm getting acoustic EDM vibes

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.3): The electric guitars in the pre-chorus feel out of place, but the acoustic works in the first part of the chorus, and the pseudo-drop in the second half of the chorus where she repeats "I'm yours" is great.

**awryj** (7.2): It sounds like an EMOTION Side B reject

**banananaise** (7): this especially reminds me of the basic pop-with-light-traces-of-country-and-rock songs that would get played constantly on australian pop radio in the early 2010s

**blue\_charles** (7): honestly being angry about falling for a guy is a big mood and I'm glad someone finally understands this.

**mokitsu** (7): chorus is a bit underwhelming. i feel this is overproduced

**nooodisaster** (7): Okay how tf does this antisocial child get a perfect boyfriend yet I'm here being a cute slut and still am single? Rude.

**OxfordSemicolon** (7): I like the guitar.

**tooshorttoofast** (7): chorus is a bit lacking

**cyborglilith** (6): meh just filler

**dirdbub** (6): solidly boring

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): hey alexa how do i make a song

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (5.5): Sounds like a lesser version of a Lorde song.

**zamomattel** (4.5): Jason Mraz did it better

**Elitefourbrad** (3): Jason Mraz did this better.

Seventeen sits as the perfect intro song and really the thesis to the rest of the album. It’s that moment when you realize you don’t have the world figured out as much as you thought and you aren’t the Know it All you thought you were because now you’re lost and it’s time to grow up.

---
**ImADudeDuh** (11): Honestly, this song is amazing.

**jamesfog** (11): I love Alessia's best song

**spaghettibread** (11): a m a z I n g

---

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): my personal favorite by her

**agentofscranton** (10): I’m turning 20 next year and I’m freaking out so I guess I can relate?

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): Being 17, this song is horrifyingly accurate and relatable. God getting old sucks.

**gannade** (10): This song is a little too in your face with the teenage nostalgia but damn if it isn't true.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I really like this song. Growing up is pretty tough but when you look back on it, sometimes you wish you could do it all over again. I always say that at any given moment I want to punch the person I was a month ago in the face, and I stand by that, but there’s a certain element of mystique and nostalgia to the past. I’m always shocked and annoyed yb the person that I was, because I’ve grown since then, but then I’m also aware that the person I am right now I’m going to grow out of and hate too. I hate the person that I was in the past, but I also envy him because he doesn’t know enough to hate himself yet. It’s a weird feeling and that’s what I get from the song. Super underrated music video too. “I’m a know-it-all, I don’t know enough” is my favorite lyric in the entire rate. I will say though, I’m confused by the incredibly long list of co-writers listed on this track.

**poppinmmolly** (10): fun fact, when I was listening on Spotify, for some reason in between every other song it would default back to this one, so I must have heard the "ohs" at the beginning like 20 times which honestly just made me like it more, cuz it sounded familiar.

**therokinrolla** (10): i wish i could give this 17 points. Its really beautiful and even though its a bit exaggerated its relatable

**VeganSquash** (10): this is me but 19 instead of 17

**mokitsu** (9.5): a great opener! as a 17 year old i definitely want to freeze time

**nooodisaster** (9.5): THIS IS HOW YOU START AN ALBUM! I'm 17 again, bitch. She took me back to being in high school and being at once blissfully naive, and on the other hand thinking I was so world weary. Plus it's wholesome without sacrificing the bop-ness.

**zamomattel** (9.5): this is so earnest and cute, I'm so into it. Really sums up what it's like being a teenager

**twat\_brained** (9.4): This feels like a cleaner, more polished/crowd-friendly "Stressed Out" and it's such a cute introduction to the album.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9): ok a bop and a Half! :reba:

**Mrachnie** (9): I really like this song. While the lyrics are just a bit too literal for me, but the instrumental is very nice and i find myself humming the chorus all the time.

**PossumAloysuis** (9): Good intro. It's growing on me

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Alright so I'm gonna start this rate with a mini-assay. 17 was the best year of my life so far. I was in love, I was surrounded by a small circle of great friends, I was doing great in school, and everything just seemed to be working out perfectly fine. In Tyler the Creator's words, 17 was "my November". So even if the song isn't particularly special (it is a good song though), it still holds a special place in my heart because it brings back good memories. "I wish I could freeze the time at 17" is definitely relatable to a whole new level. Well done Alessia.

**timothy444** (9): A great opening track! I wonder why this never had an impact on the charts? A bit confused.

**tooshorttoofast** (9): taylor's impact

**strawberryswing1** (8.7): That grass line caught me off guard, I bet she thinks she's so fucking clever for that

**blue\_charles** (8): This makes me want to redo being 17 because I think I did it wrong.

**blueheart** (8): This song peaks in the first two lines, but I like her fast singing.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Hmm, I'll be sixteen when this rate's results are revealed and this song sounds pretty ominous to me. Haha. I'm starting to understand feelings of sentimentality towards being younger and more carefree, but at the same time, I find growing up exciting since I'm ambitious at heart. This sets the 'teen' part of this album really well and Alessia does a good job with singing.

**SkyBlade79** (8): I’m not a fan of this song sonically but I do really like the lyrics. I totally relate to them, as a seventeen year old myself. She does evoke a really nice feeling of nostalgia for my life that I’m so familiar with.

**theNealCutter** (8): reminds me a lot Lorde's Team sonically. I love the lyrics. the vocals are nice too. but the beat's too repetitive and there's not really a burst of energy unlike Team.

**mustangs16** (7.5): i would like this more, i think, if i was still close enough to 17 myself to really relate to it

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): Production is pretty reminiscient of "Team" which is a good thing, but I feel like the lyrics are trying to cram too much in there which is awkward.

**chipsi1** (7): it's such a cute song!

**dirdbub** (7): not to be rude, but if offered the opportunity to black out my entire life at the age of 17 I would take the money and run, go on take the money and run, go on take the money and run, go on take the money and run, Billy Mack is a detective down in Texa

**dropthehammer11** (7): Good intro, showcases her sound. Also miles better than the XXXTENTACION album of the same name

**enecks** (7): This sounds nice and snappy and I'm not going to lie some of it resonates. It has passion to it.

**lunasaflowers** (7): I'm 17 rn and I definitely feel parts of this. Alessia's vocals are a bit pitchy on the chorus.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): google.com that one drum fill from we are young

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.3): It's pretty good...it feels like it's supposed to be anthemic, but doesn't quite get there. The production works and she sounds good.

**awryj** (6): It's pleasant and the lyrics are nice and, uh, correct I guess?

**Raykel** (6): I didn't know she had fake deep tendencies..oh boy

**fifthchevron** (5): Okay I see the Lorde comparisons now...this is almost plagiarism lol

**MrSwearword** (5): a pet peeve of mine is when a young singer tries to act like they’ve learned so much in their short time on Earth. The second I heard “I was too young” from Alessia, she lost me. Her singing here is pretty good though.

**Elitefourbrad** (4): Alessia, girl why do you want to be Seventeen? Being 18 is so much more fun, you can do whatever and whoever you want.

**cyborglilith** (1): I feel like she's trying too hard. The yelling at the beginning makes me hate this even more.

**shineflyer** (1): This was a scary song to start the rate with, because I was afraid the whole rate would sound this immature and faux-anthemic.

The production is great on this song but honestly I’m not too impressed with anything else. The chorus can be a bti annoying and repetitive but overall I like the meaning of the song

---
**bluehxrizon** (11): the atmosphere is so perfect on this song and the instrumental is fantastic

**dirdbub** (11): "I don't give a fuck, I'm not giving up / I still want it all" oh god /u/troye_sivan just fucking put my life out on the line like that ilu

**fifthchevron** (11): As an Aussie, I'm pretty jaded towards our pop music. For the most part, it's embarrassingly out of date. There's only two Australian songs recently that really floored me and took my breath away. One is Battle Scars by Guy Sebastian with Lupe Fiasco. The other one is Fools. Having one of the most beautiful modern pop ballads sung by an openly gay male pop star is just the cherry on top.

**Mrachnie** (11): This song is probably the most beautiful from all of these albums. The lyrics paint an image really well and the production is the best in this rate easily and while the chorus IS one phrase repeated over and over, the instrumental on the chorus is very complex and keeps it from feeling stale. I feel like the feeling of this song is what Troye has tried so hard to achieve with the other songs on BN, but none of them do it THIS effortlessly.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): Easy 11 for me. This was the song that made me absolutely believe Troye Sivan would be the next big thing. When the Wild EP came out and I checked it out, this was the huge standout, a synth-laden track with an absolutely beautiful drop that crashes back and forth, pushing and pulling and building upon the already fantastic instrumental during the verses. Troye delivers a great vocal performance here, and his soft singing is a great foil to the explosive and lush instrumental, especially when it just unleashes in the outro, bursting into this beautiful release that you end up waiting for each time you relisten to the song.

**cyborglilith** (0): lol wtf is this trash bye Troye sorry not sorry

---

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): first song i heard by troye. i thoroughly enjoy

**agentofscranton** (10): this is probably a really niche recommendation but there’s an a cappella group called The Nor’easters who did an a cappella cover of this song which is a fucking weave snatcher if ever there was one

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): Just like 99% of this album, this song had such a huge influence on me. The EP came out around the time I had my first real person crush realized, and this song made me relate so hard because at the time I was 100% sure he was straight. This is the song that made the album go from gay to G A Y

**blue\_charles** (10): i FUCK with this song. like I don't think y'all understand how much i FUCK with this song. It comes on and I slide down onto the floor and cry like there's no hope for me just let me go.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): The production on this is almost dream-like. I love the way the synths feel like they're bending and snap back like a rubber band in the chorus. Something I thought was cool was how he balanced such descriptive verses with a chorus that uses one phrase repeatedly.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’ll overlook the painful and somewhat random use of the word “aerosol” and give this one a 10. Probably the most emotionally impactful song on the album for me, I like how this song is an attack on multiple levels. He’s complaining that falling for this guy is stupid and that he’s a fool for doing so. But he also says that only a fool would fall for this guy, which implies that he’s part of the problem too. It’s unclear whether he hates this guy or himself, or both, and it’s all twisted up quite nicely. Troye’s vocals are great here and that drop or instrumental or whatever is fantastic.

**tooshorttoofast** (10): the music video for this is heartbreaking :(

**blueheart** (9.5): Prechorus perfection.

**PossumAloysuis** (9.5): Everything meshes well here. Love the synths

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): Really good! The only thing that bothers me a little is the transition from the hook to the second verse, but that's it.

**twat\_brained** (9.2): Another great single but I feel like it's somewhat held back by the synths here. Essentially, it's like a 2015 "Happy Little Pill", and that's what I like about it. Also, it provides an excellent 2nd chapter in the BN trilogy of music videos.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): The first truly great track on Blue Neighbourhood. The lyrics are descriptive to a pinch and the album's 'angsty gay theme' aesthetic solidifies completely right around the chorus. Some parts of this are a little too awkwardly paced for me, which, upon reflection, is my only complaint with it.

**theNealCutter** (9): future bass is amazing. that disjointed beat and his awkwardly offbeat vocals makes it weird and messy and emotive. although I do get the feel that it's the producers that do the heavy-lifting on this one.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (9): Another winner. Troye starts out the deluxe version so strongly! The song is slow and syrupy but still manages to pop, especially during the chorus. And that chorus? “Only fools fall for you” is such a great line that captures the teenage angst and romance of the album so well.

**dropthehammer11** (8.5): This song is dope as shit. I love the chorus and buildup to it

**enecks** (8): "can someone please explain the concept of homophobia? like literally- look at troye. look at tyler. look at connor. and everyone else who is part of the lgbtq+ community. they're so cute damnit 😍"

**nooodisaster** (8): Damn this is a bop. "And my hopes, they are high/I must keep them small" is A+. Also, gay domestic fantasies set to killer drops are my aesthetic.

**strawberryswing1** (8): I love the mood the beginning of this song has. The production with his voice is so nice, but then the production picks up and becomes too overpowering. And the song goes on a little too long.

**awryj** (7): BUY HP HYBRID LAPTOPS

**letsallpoo** (7): glory days outsold

**NapsAndNetflix** (7): 7/10 without rice - 10/10 with rice

**SkyBlade79** (7): great production yet again, those synths

**spaghettibread** (7): cool but a lil forgettable

**zamomattel** (6.5): "Boo, I am not the fool" Shangela Laquifa Wadley, Untucked 2011

**MashLuke** (6): I don't like this that much

**Elitefourbrad** (5): Again, I thought we were still in the same song for the second straight song. Troye’s voice is so melodramatic, showing no emotion as he goes between the same 5 notes for 3 straight songs. Even mumble rappers have more variety than this. I will give points for the clever lyricism in this song though, and no I’m not talking about the chorus.

**mokitsu** (4.5): sounds like a chainsmokers song, SKIP!

**MrSwearword** (4): that “Grindin” drumbeat on the chorus is bad. Fucks with the mood set by the verses.

**shineflyer** (4): doesn't bring anything new to the table imo. it's alright I guess?

Really cute and emotive love song. I love the production and even the kids in the background. But let’s be honest here. Alessia makes this song 10x better and Troye by himself just doesn’t do it for me like the collab does

---
**blue\_charles** (11): literally invented gay romance

**TragicKingdom1** (11): Great melody, plus the child vocal chants exacerbate the catchiness.

---

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): Perfect song. It was the first ever Troye song I listened too, and I must admit ashamed that it was because of a Buzzfeed quiz(which WILD EP song are you), but nonetheless, it was worth it. God I can't decide between YOUTH, WILD, for him. and FOOLS for my 11.

**fifthchevron** (10): I love the echoing background vocals, the drums and that subtle guitar. Then of course Troye's towering vocal. I also really like songs that are undeniably sexual but don't come across sleazy either. (Alessia's verse is actually great too)

**gannade** (10): I'm just imaging all these teen movies when the main character has a flashback of their childhood, and it would be like a little boy playing in the sand with his father and everyone is smiling and all happy, and this is the type of song that would be playing in the background. (then, usually in these movies, theyll play a flashback of his parents getting killed in a car crash right after, but that's irrelevant rn)

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I was going to make some kind of comment about how the version with Alessia Cara is better, but honestly it’s not. It’s not bad or anything, I like hearing Alessia’s voice and she certainly doesn’t take away from the song, but she doesn’t really add anything because this track is pretty perfect. (Though the video for that version is better.) This is a fantastic opener for the album. It’s one of the catchiest songs on the record and it neatly sets up the themes that follow throughout the album. Special props go to that distant sounding “wi-i-i-ild” hook, it sounds like it’s literally calling to us to come into the world of the album.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Idk what to write here, this is just a good song

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): anyone who gives this a low score is homophobic

**PossumAloysuis** (10): Probably the best intro on this list

**spaghettibread** (10): perfect

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Love the “woah ah oh ohs”, the wonderful production, the soft, bridge, and basically everything about this track. It was the track I expected to explode from the album, being so summery and catchy, and while it didn’t do as well to blow him up as I thought, it was still pretty big. The chorus is just so fun and it’s a perfect intro to the album.

**theNealCutter** (10): perfect pop song if you ask me. escapist, simple, but emotive and sexy song.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Pop perfection honestly. The production is great, his voice sounds good, the hook is catchy and memorable. Can't think of any way this could be better.

**tooshorttoofast** (10): queen of inventing gay people. God who?

**twat\_brained** (10): This was the perfect choice for a lead single and has a fantastic music video that ties in with it.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (10): Honestly iconic. WILD perfectly opens up the album, making references to the “blue neighborhood” that the album is named after. Relatable lyrics, perfect production, and a killer bridge. Troye really did THAT.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.5): Idk if this is supposed to be a concept album, but either way he sets the scene for the rest of the songs really well with this as the opening track. His vocal delivery is low key yet impassioned at the same time and his tone is so rich and ughhh I'm swooning.

**VeganSquash** (9.5): THE REMIX IS BETTER

**blueheart** (9): WILD ft. Alessia was robbed

**enecks** (9): Yeah Troye's a special artist

**nooodisaster** (9): "'Cause there's still too long to the weekend/Too long till I drown in your hands/Too long since I've been a fool". Relatable bop with elegant lyrics and yet is still a slut anthem. I stan.

**OxfordSemicolon** (9): I read a book called Wild for class recently and heard "Wi-i-i-ild" in my head every time someone mentioned it. It got annoying, but I still like the song.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): I like it but the backing choir pisses me off a bit idk

**dirdbub** (8): my gay ass is shaking already

**MashLuke** (8): This is cute but that's about it

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I got annoyed listening to this on our car radio, because hearing kids sing inside a cramped space is not good for my mental heath. As a opening track, it's much better, in my book. It still loses two points for the parts of the chorus that aren't sung by Troye, but name dropping your album right during your first song is a nice decision.

**zamomattel** (8): I'm not obsessed with this but it's a nice little opener

**AbnormalPopPunk** (6): i enjoy the chorus. the rest is mediocre

**cyborglilith** (6): chorus: good. gang vocals: no.

**awryj** (5): This is my first Troye Sivan song ever and wow is his voice underwhelming

**Mrachnie** (5): Boring.

**MrSwearword** (5): boring verses, decent hook, twinkly beat

**Elitefourbrad** (3): I mean this is a really basic thing about love and being wild and stuff. Also what the fuck are those background vocals, like what? It sounds like children are singing the whole song, and yes that’s a Troye drag.

**mokitsu** (2): this is so cringy...i hate the kids voices

**shineflyer** (2): I hate the backup vocals so much. This song could get a way better score than I'm giving it if the backup vocals were good.

**SkyBlade79** (2): I don’t like the children singing in the song, totally ruins the song :/

The verses in this song are amazing and the chorus is really good and the drop is pretty uniue man for somereason they all just don’t mesh well for me.

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (11): I have to give this song my 11. It's one of my faves from the album, but it's also my most listened Troye song ever, and in my top 5 most listened songs of all time. It's just the perfect gay alter teen song ever made.

**mokitsu** (0): cringy lyrics, cringy drop

**theNealCutter** (0): redundant. why have this when you have WILD? also, how did Troye came from singing this so mature, self-aware Heaven, to this dumbed-down song? the lyrics are cliched, the beat is a direct ripoff of Royals, and the drop is like Young and Menace but at least manages to be less annoying.

---

**dirdbub** (10): /u/troye_sivan just so you know, this video made me buy a "Make America Gay Again" hat and I plan on using it for my coming out picture on Instagram :)

**dropthehammer11** (10): bangs in my asshole

**fifthchevron** (10): The prettiest lyrical imagery of all time perhaps??

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Apparently the lyrics of this song were inspired by a message that someone sent to Allie X on tumblr, so that’s fun. The central image of this song is so wonderful to me, the idea of commiting your youth to someone and just giving them part of your life, it’s a very romantic notion, and there’s a lot of great imagery in this song to support it. (“Mortal body; timeless soul”)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): You should've see how happy I was in 2016 to find out that this was a top 40 hit, even if it was just for a week

**Mrachnie** (10): Yess Allie get that promo. I like it because he actually sounds half-alive in this song, which is already an achievement. The drop makes it seem like Some Dj - Youth ft. Troye Sivan tho.

**MrSwearword** (10): on its own, it’s a mediocre song with an annoying children’s choir added for no fucking reason. However, I saw its impact when it was paired with a KPOP song [“Galaxy” by Ladies Code]; yes, I’m saying the score is because of a mashup showing that it can be used in a better way.

**nooodisaster** (10): They say youth is the most precious gift we're ever given. I just think there's something so beautiful about declaring "my youth is yours," and deciding to give someone that gift. The production is smart, it's catchy as all hell, the lyrics are interesting, and the explosion into the chorus is incredible. Almost got my 11.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Prior to this album, this is the only Troye song I really liked and I still maintain that stance of mine. It's subtle enough to be played at social events and whenever I hear it in public I feel a little less anxious about the homophobia in my country's society. It might be how gay I am but in terms of this rate I think that this barely beats out Wild Things in personifying what it's like to be young.

**spaghettibread** (10): also perfection

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): It’s THAT song. It’s an absolutely stellar and huge single, and every part of the hook lives up to that brilliant opening. The background vocals in the chorus are just divine, and the kid knows how to do a hook. The drop is great, and it’s like the closest to the Wild EP out of any of the new songs, which is a plus in my book. I’m glad this is the one that got him attention, because it’s a sprawling, glorious track.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Once again, Troye serving fun, catchy, pop perfection.

**timothy444** (10): even is this was the official song edit (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZzFlvo5X_Y), I would still give this a 10!

**tooshorttoofast** (10): uplifting BOP

**twat\_brained** (10): Literally within the top 5 on this album at least, just may go top 5 in the rate.

**zamomattel** (10): THOSE DAMNED YOUTHS

**jamesfog** (9.5): Production carries this, hard

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.3): Everything about this song is celebratory and joyful and I am here for it. Also the lyrics in the chorus are kind of nonsensical which I like because that's what the sheer ecstasy of falling in love is like.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): My first introduction to Troye and many others' :")

**PossumAloysuis** (9): I don't know what else to say. Good song

**chipsi1** (8.5): his biggest hit in the us for a good reason.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (8.5): The big single that catapulted Troye onto the Hot 100, and it’s not hard to see why. The song has a bouncy and upbeat vibe that gets stuck in your head really easily. The chorus is one of the best on the album and the drop afterward is electro-pop goodness!

**blue\_charles** (8): I like this, but I don't go crazy for it as a lot of other people do. Still would drunken sing/cry to it tho.

**cyborglilith** (8): verses r gud but dubstep production is trash

**MashLuke** (7): This is considered one of his best songs but it's too similar to Wild imo

**Raykel** (7): I know he means that he wants to waste his time as a youth with this person but "my youth is yours" just sounds really creepy. Also why was the lead single when FOOLS exists?

**shineflyer** (7): still a bit faux-anthemic, but I feel like this is what STYB could have sounded like if it had better production.

**banananaise** (6): this is a disappointingly generic shouty-chorus electro-pop-lite track, this is not what i would have guessed to be his 'big song'

**Elitefourbrad** (6): This is Troye’s highest peaking song on the charts. I can see why because this drop is the best thing on this album because Troye isn’t singing on it.

**enecks** (6): This song is one long what if - What if Troye was a more basic artist

**awryj** (5): I'm trying to make a comment on every song and I just can't come up with this one. It sounds like a 2016 radio hit I guess?

**Overall average**: 7.344 // [User Averages](https://pastebin.com/vjWgXmMG)

---

Before I suggested this rate I had maybe listened to half of this album one time and decided it was too gay for me but when I sat down to really listen It honestly surprised me. There’s some songs that are really good and some songs that just fall flat for me. He’s not exactly trying to be as pretentious or edgy as the others and he isn’t exactly serving vocals and it can make the album real boring and hard to come back to but what I love about this album is how emotive it is. 



---
**Mrachnie**: This album feels like an album the most out of these. The songs are pieced together by electronica- and trap-inspired instrumentals (although the trap ones almost never work) but it has one problem: More than a half of it is filler. Like, really, so much songs could be removed and the album wouldn't suffer one bit.

**mokitsu**: troye sivan is basically just mumbling and whispering to lorde/chainsmokers rejects in this album, it gets tired quick and it's not really enjoyable

**chipsi1**: It's a decent album. it honestly gets a lil samey at the second half but it's still decent.

**mustangs16**: what's the point of all the song titles being capitalized???!!!!?!??!

**gannade**: His best song is Happy Little Pill and it isn't even on the album. Troye please.

**dropthehammer11**: twink

**fifthchevron**: Australian pop is usually so far behind, most of our stuff sounds 10 years old. Troye is a breath of fresh air and I hope his next album slays everyone.

**TragicKingdom1**: I try to stay relatively unbiased when I rate or assess albums but sorry, Troye aiming for my exact demographic as "sad male gay teenager" means I'm going to have a naturally easier time connecting to the songs and thus my scores are inflated a bit. The lyrics are really the centerpiece of the album, as the production and Troye's vocals aren't anything special. I do, however, give this album a great deal of credit for managing to convey a great range of emotions and moods while using the same production techniques throughout. Overall, I think that there's a lot of good pop music for everyone in here but you're probably not going to fall in love with every aspect of it unless you fall into the target demographic (which I do).

**tooshorttoofast**: I'm not ashamed to admit that I broke down when I saw the Wild-Fools-Talk me Down music video trilogy. This album holds such a close place to my heart. Pretty much every song is crafted superbly and they all have their own purpose. I'm so proud of Troye.

**jamesfog**: We love background music

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: I honestly cannot believe that a YouTuber made an album this good. It's full of emotion, and full of exciting and interesting beats. Definitely looking forward to his next release. Average: 8.53

**dirdbub**: it's not even funny how leagues above this album is in comparison to the other two

**Damoojo**: I got bored listening to this but it had some good bops in it.

**shineflyer**: Troye's voice is definitely the worst of the three in this rate, but that's not to say it's bad - it's got a nice tone to it. Plus, he makes one of the rare times when I can take a Youtuber-gone-musician seriously, so there's that.

**enecks**: A promising though imperfect debut. It's thematically resonant. Troye should get some better producers, because he could make a Melodrama-tier album.

**theNealCutter**: safe synthpop-alt-pop album. i like the gayness. enjoyable at most. it's like PG-gay Born To Die.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Too sleepy to calculate shit right now, but I think this got around the same average as Know-It-All. This is a good album, but after listening to it I'm beginning to understand that the songs happen to be much easier to enjoy side by side than on their own. That's a little underwhelming, but I'm not complaining. Troye does succeed in creating a good aesthetic, and he touches important issues on this record, so I'm perfectly fine with it being a little too cohesive to a fault.

**timothy444**: 7.1

**SkyBlade79**: Surprisingly good. Kind of reminds me of Lady Wood by a male singer. Average: 6.27

**andreszmtz**: 9

**mirandacrocsgrove**: Troye is not a vocal powerhouse. At times, there are points in the album where it’s obvious that he lacks the natural ability of a singer, but that isn’t to say this is necessarily a criticism. Just an observation. Blue Neighborhood is a very production-driven record and that’s fine, I guess. It shows that Troye himself knows his limitations and I honestly love the production on this album for the most part. It also shows how Troye can work well with his producers and it barely feels like he’s pushing himself to boundaries he can’t reach. With all his limitations said, he greatly makes up for it with his amazing lyricism. This alone makes me confident that he’s going to deliver nothing but a masterpiece as a follow-up album. I will also be forever thankful for him for speaking my feelings with “Heaven”. Such a perfect song that beautifully encapsulates my feelings not just two years ago, but for the entirety of my lifetime.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: A bit inconsistent at times but this is a good debut album for Troye.

**AFlyingWhale\_**: It's a good album, but I feel almost like I'm underrating it? Idk, I still like it but I feel like there's something I'm missing. The production is all over the place but it's not a bad thing, it shows lots of diversity. Some of which I like and some of which is just....eh.

**cyborglilith**: WHY ARE THE SONG TITILES IN ALL CAPS? THAT’S ANNOYING. ANYWAY I LIKE THE OVERALL AESTHETIC OF THE ALBUM; MOST OF THE SONGS ARE JUST BORING THOUGH.

**InfiniteFireTV**: 9

**ComeOnAndSlang**: ANOTHER forgettable album. If we were judging tHese albums by tHeir cover tHough, tHis would be tHe winner

**banananaise**: AGAIN so long, so much filler. demand better from your alt-pop idols

**MashLuke**: I feel homophobic for hating this but it's not that good imo

**Kaylaboe**: The most consistent album of the rate. Maybe a little too consistent, as the tracks ending the album all kind of blend into one. This one has some great collad, solid production throughout and of course the moody atmosphere.

**frankiefrankiefrank**: Going in, I knew I was probably going to rate everything on this album pretty high, and--surprise!--I did, but it's honestly because Blue Neighborhood is a piece of art.

**strawberryswing1**: Man, this album's production is so heavily electronic.

**amumumyspiritanimal**: I don't know if anyone will be shocked about my high scores but BN is one of my top 5 favorite albums of all time, and the 3rd if you count one album per artist. It had a huge influence on my life in the past 2 years, mainly helped me accept my sexuality and overcome a lot of my fears. The album also set me on the path of coming out, and embrace my femininity and flaws. The songs were the perfect crying songs on the worst nights, and the songs that brought me closer with some of my old friends. I will be forever thankful for Troye to making my teenage years a tad less shitty, and based on how much it affected me positively, this album is #1. I don't know how high the songs will go, based on the past the sub will somehow manage to surprise me both positively and negatively, but honestly, I'm glad that this album is recognized and loved, no matter it's performance in the rate. But if any of the songs get into the bottom 10 I'll cut a bitch.

**Elitefourbrad**: A boring, overrated, emotionless drag of an album. Troye stays in the same octave the whole album and the highlights are features, which is never a good sign. There For You is a MASSIVE improvement over this pile of my aunt’s leftover meatloaf that their dog is eating.

**nooodisaster**: I frickin fell in love this album, and I wanna thank the rate hosts for including it. True gay representation in pop music = my new fetish.

**Ghost-Quartet**: Troye had, without question, the strongest album in the rate. It’s the most sonically cohesive with the tightest production and the best songwriting. It’s not my favorite of the three, but it’s clearly the best. It’s funny, Badlands was self-described as a concept album but I feel like Troye did it much better with far less fanfare. There’s not a story to Blue Neighbourhood, but there are consistent themes running throughout that put me in mind of a concept album. Throughout my comments on this album I found myself bringing up many times the concept of “duality,” the songs often paint a topic in two different lights or songs seem to be written in direct response to one another. We see fiery passion depicted as sweet in “WILD,” but this is immediately followed by it being depicted as dangerous on “BITE.” I talked about it a bit on my comments on the individual tracks, but “YOUTH” and “LOST BOY” are polar opposites of each other in exploring concepts of youth and love. Blue Neighbourhood is an album exploring the complexity of growing up as a queer youth in our modern era. Love is exciting, but also dangerous. Being yourself is liberating, but the world doesn’t make it easy. The more I listened to this album the more I came to appreciate the nuance of it all, it’s a very well written album that benefits from being given a bit of thought. Also I’d like to point out for those of you who didn’t notice that Allie X was a cowriter for several tracks.

**WhenYouHaveArrived**: My average score for this album was juuuust under 8, which seems like a fair assessment. It’s a solid debut album with some good, sometimes moody electro-pop production, good vocals from Troye, and relatable lyrics (especially to young queer people). This was the one album of the 3 that I listened to extensively before the rate, so it was fun revisiting it cuz it’s one of my favorite pop albums!

**PossumAloysuis**: An enjoyable alternative pop album. Definitely better than I expected it to be.

**OxfordSemicolon**: Moodiest of moody teen pop.

The perfect driving music continues. This song is the peak of Halseys career as far as I’m concerned. It just hits every single aspect of her aesthetic. This song feels like sleeping in a skeevy motel with bright pink and blue neon and driving down a highway in an old muscle car with your lover in the middle of the desert and this is just the song where she gets everything right.

---
**AbnormalPopPunk** (11): i had to. i couldn't stop myself. i love this song so much. something about this feels... nostalgic. or euphoric. this song feels first love and being young and being rebellious and just living life as best as you can. and im still young. and i havent been very rebellious nor have i felt love yet but this song makes me feel like i have. it's almost like this song is indirectly breaking the fourth wall. it's looking you in the eye and saying "this is my story, if you've experienced this than hell yeah, i hope this makes you feel better about it. if you haven't, that's ok, we'll pretend like you have. this song is just really special to me. i've never written this much about a song in a rate but it just felt necessary. really hoping popheads pulls thru with this one lol

**Damoojo** (11): A bop! Ever since I heard the mashup of this and Coldplay's paradise, I've been in love with this song.

**Elitefourbrad** (11): I’m literally shaking as I listen to this for the first time in years. I want a Roman Holiday with Halsey. Everything is just perfect here, with the best production on the album by far and amazing lyrics. Also I love the lyrics about looking for the sunlight through the darkness and the taste of each other’s lips, just little things like that completely make a song for me and that’s what Halsey did here.

---

**agentofscranton** (10): in a rate filled with anthems about celebrating youthfulness and revelling in nostalgia, this is the only one that really affects me and gives me that youthful nostalgia

**blueheart** (10): Another example of Halsey's great touches of production, the little camera flashing sound in the bridge.

**bluehxrizon** (10): I wish there were more synthpop bops like this on the album

**enecks** (10): This is probably the peak of this album irony aside.

**MashLuke** (10): One of her best songs

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): a standout track that honestly should’ve been a single. this is one of those few times in the album where Halsey shows off her range and it’s sad that moments like this are quite limited in the album.

**Mrachnie** (10): I love this. The lyrics reming me of a Taylor Swift song from the RED era, and the instrumental doesen't distract from them.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): For some reason, I've never seen anybody mention this as a highlight of Badlands until recently, but I can see why it's catching on in popularity. Halsey sounds genuinely happy here, and it's reflected in this song's composition and lyricism, which is a rarity in Badlands. It's strange that one of the best songs on this album is an example of pure, unadulterated joyous pop, but when Halsey shows us sides of her artistry that we don't usually see, most of the time, it works.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): Hey now hey now, This is what dreams are made of!

**SkyBlade79** (10): this song is amazing, one of Halsey’s best. I love the intonation on her voice in the chorus. The production is really nice, especially that breakdown at the end. The It’s just such a nice song to listen to with your eyes closed, just thinking about life.

**tooshorttoofast** (10): YES HALSEY I need more songs like this from her

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): Would've been an 11 but halsey's voice on the first verse bothered me more than I remembered

**mokitsu** (9.5): this song is pop perfection!

**twat\_brained** (9.3): I remember listening to this and sharing this with my classmates and being so excited for her to play this at her concert.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): She sounds happy for once!

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): The instrumental is amazing, but the lyrics could use some improvement.

**blue\_charles** (9): honestly, I'm just here for that moment in the bridge where the music cuts out for a second before slamming back. you know what I'm talking about, let's be real.

**cyborglilith** (9): Unpopular opinion: I like this song. Let the downvotes commence. /s

**letsallpoo** (9): nicki outsold

**nooodisaster** (9): I think it's impossible to dislike this song. Like, it's seriously just damn good. The only other song on this album I want to keep coming back to.

**spaghettibread** (9): this one's lit

**theNealCutter** (9): nice sound and has emotion. but there are a lot of filler lyrics to be honest. and the Roman Holiday part is kinda weird and uninclusive for people who won't get the reference.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (9): The verses and the chorus really pop on this song! Bridge is cool as well. Something about this song reminds me of the pop-punk/emo of the 200s a la Paramore or Anberlin (WHO ARE SEVERELY UNDERRATED)

**strawberryswing1** (8.5): I had to look up the lyrics because the production drowns out her voice in the chorus.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): Best song on the album melodically.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.2): Her voice sounds great on this, and I like that she uses more of her upper range and ditches the indie-singer accent for most of it! Also the lyrics are simple but effective, and show that she has the ability to be a good storyteller.

**awryj** (8): It's a strong 8 and I probably would score it higher, but I can't help but feel like there's some unused potential here

**dirdbub** (8): Halsey and co. finally get it right and move to something more uptempo, but the song is slightly lacking lyrically like the rest of the album has been. it's insatiably catchy though, so it's one of the standouts of the album

**fifthchevron** (8): Songwriting probably had Taylor shook.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I was ready to slap this with a 6 then the beautiful synth orgy came on, and I was living. I just feel like every Halsey song would be improved with her not on it, but the second half of the song is pretty great.

**timothy444** (8): Nicki Minaj who?

**chipsi1** (7): I actually don't hate this. It's catchy and I like the production.

**dropthehammer11** (7): Solid song for sure, but not as gripping as the other songs so far

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is absolutely one of the most iconic songs in the rate, I was watching Younger on TVLand starring Sutton Foster, Hilary Duff, Miriam Shor, and Debi Mazar, and there was one of those interludes that was just a shot of the city with the sun going down and according to the subtitles THIS song was playing in the background. Legendary.

**lunasaflowers** (6.8): Not gonna lie, I remember listening to this before and not being huge on it, but I like it a loooot more than I did before. Halsey's vocals sound kind of wonky on parts, though.

**MrSwearword** (6): dark lyrics over a near cheesy 80s beat done wrong results in this but at least this is more anthemic as opposed to defeatist.

**shineflyer** (6): there's really nothing to hate here, but nothing to particularly love either.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): It's ok, but nothing really stands out to make it a memorable song.

**zamomattel** (6): This is an acceptable pop song, but Nicki's is so much better

And we ask ourselves what is this doing here? This song and Here battles for the top spot for what seemed like forever. Every score I got pretty much changed which song was gonna win and maybe one would pull ahead by like half a point but it would only be  for a day at most. Honestly this is a deserving spot for this song. It’s angsty and beautifully produced and it’s just a perfect song. If I was Matt Healy I would be so honored someone made a song like this just for me. It's a perfect song but man I just can't get past the talking part sometimes. It goes from 0-tumblr real quick

---

**AFlyingWhale\_** (11): I absolutely love the metaphors in this song, especially using colors to symbolize her relationship (in the bridge too). I recently found out that it's written about The 1975's Matty Healy, which kinda adds quite some context. Colors is just...tells such a sweet, yet heartwrenching story about unrequited love. And it's dressed up in so much beautiful language, the saturated sunrise, the ripped at every edge, and all the things Halsey associates the colors with. This song is fucking poetry. Oh, and Halsey did the whole colors thing better than Taylor.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (11): her best

**gannade** (11): assay time :deadbanananaananna: Can't help it, I love this song too much.*Halsey just LOVES to write really basic, grade-school level rhymes for her choruses, but she finally gets it right here. She stepped up her lyrical game for this song. "Colors" is a perfect celebration for teenage nostalgia, or maybe just teenage life in general, delivered as a metaphor with one of the earliest wonders a person experiences: color. In that context, lines such as "you were a vision in the morning when the light came through" don't seem all that overly embellished at all; in fact, they beautifully capture the type of poetry you might find in a high schooler's diary. Likewise, the line that follows it - "I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you" - takes one of history's most controversial topics and simplifies it into a simple testament of love. The religion metaphor is a bit hackneyed, but it's the type of bombastic statement that we make in our perfect Teenage Dream.*Elsewhere, the song hints that not all is love in the badlands, but the problems are only fleeting. "Your little brother never told you but he loves you so/ Your mother only smiles when she's on her TV show" is a catchy opening couplet with a surprising amount of depth. It paints a cautiously tragic home life, but juxtaposes it with a jubilant electropop beat. "You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope" might sound like foreshadowing to a grave problem, but Halsey brushes it off with the very next line: "I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old." I always rolled my eyes when Halsey said her albums were concept albums. Like where is the concept? But on Colors, I believed it. She's painting a fantasy world of nostalgic bliss, where problems are only nominal, and I want in.*And that bridge, god that bridge. Halsey sells the shit out of it. I love the way she sounds more amused than anything when she comes to the conclusion that "purple just wasn't for you." I love the way she sings so nonchalantly how she "wakes up every morning but it's not with you" after just declaring that her lover is her religion two lines ago. I love her similes in the prechorus when she says someone is spilling like an overflowing sink. It's a strange simile, but the imagery works along with the saturated sunrise, his blue jeans, his grey hair. I love how he's simultaneously blue and devoid of color. I love how Halsey takes the single syllable in "ink" and transforms it into "inkkkkkkkk" with the same diction as all the stereotypical indie girls. I love how Halsey sounds like she doesn't have a single care in the world, making "Colors" the perfect song to listen to when you just want to escape from the real world.

**MashLuke** (11): Last year I had this song on repeat, I was so fucking obsessed with it that I started listening to all the remixed versions too. While some lyrics might not be that good, the song absolutely works as a whole. The references about pills, the 27 club and etc. make this a realistic love song. She could pretend that everything is okay but her lover is slowly getting grayer each day and she can't act like everything is colourful. The love they have is bound to end in a pond of faded paint. I love this.

**MrSwearword** (11): even with “saturated sunrise”, this is what Halsey does right.

**nooodisaster** (11): Here it is. For every other rate I've given my 11 to a song that I feel really emotionally connected to and inspired by. But this gets it for just being an amazing song. This was the song that made me know Halsey, and until hfk, it was the only song I could listen to by her. Everything from the stomping beat to the infectious chorus to the layered lyrics to the plot-twist music video is just so fucking good y'all.

**VeganSquash** (11): pop perfection. I wrote a paragraph on some old thread about how amazing this song is.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): one of my faves off the album. just a great, straight up pop song

**agentofscranton** (10): i can't believe halsey invented poetry

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): My fave Badlands song. I've seen people hate on it for no reason but it's actually a MAJOR, MAJOR bop. If the straights(tm) rig the rate towards Troye I really hope Colours snatch that #1.

**bluehxrizon** (10): the bridge is kind of cheesy but its so iconic now that i love it lol

**Damoojo** (10): Having Tyler Posey in the music video was a wise choice because that's how I found out about Halsey. The end still makes me chuckle lol.

**dirdbub** (10): quite literally Halsey's magnum opus. the lyrical work is impeccable on this song, painting the picture of a dysfunctional family life perfectly while intertwining it with her disastrous love life in the song. it also gave us the daddy kink interpretation with the music video! and even with the random poem at the end, it fits well into the vibe of who she's playing in this song: a pretentious, upper-class, suburban, white teen with a terrible home life and possibly a drug addiction, although that quite isn't known yet. lovely song worthy of its praise

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I used to think this song was super pretentious but I love this song now. It's so good.

**Dracyoshi** (10): And he's blueeeuuuuuueeeeeuuuuueeeeeeeee

**dropthehammer11** (10): God what a bop. This is the song even Halsey haters have to love

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Halsey is a lyrical genius. It really shows here, as everything is blue, literally and figuratively. The colour that everyone is defines who we are as a person and differentiates ourselves from the rest of the crowd. Meanwhile, Halsey is exploring her daddy fetish in this song, Demi Lovato is shook.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CPpaBkRUsAAofCf.jpg:large

**letsallpoo** (10): succeeds in spite of being a Halsey song. also why is the title spelled with a u wtf /u/NapsAndNetflix that's not how it's supposed to be spelled. i'm not even being racist that's just not how it's spelled on the tracklist

**mustangs16** (10): STORY TIME when i saw her in concert last summer the guy behind us was drunk before the show started and at one point about halfway through the show she implied she was gonna play this song next but didn't and he nearly had a fucking meltdown and for the rest of the show he would scream angrily whenever she played a different song, and kept asking his friends (and eventually my bff and i) when we thought colors would come on and anyways when she finally closed the show with it he screamed so loud my ears were ringing and now i think of that every time i hear this song

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): The only Halsey song that my sheltered-ass high school ever played during a public event, since New Americana was out of the question for obvious reasons. That being said, Halsey deserves huge praise for this; she could have made Colours sound overwrought and melodramatic, but despite having a interlude that alternates between being pretentious and melancholy, she sings with genuine anxiety and compassion towards the song's subject. This actually makes the fact that Matty Healy ended up surviving to his 28th birthday really heartwarming in hindsight.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): There is no such thing as black and white. It's all just shades of grey

**shineflyer** (10): everything is snatched, my wig, my heart, my score.

**SkyBlade79** (10): iconic, top halsey song. She’s great in this and I actually love part 2! (where is it)

**twat\_brained** (10): "Tyler's dad, is gonna be my cad, his mustache is sexy and it drives me so mad". Idk about y'all but I was NOT expecting that plot twist when I first saw that video! Nor did I ever imagine this was a love letter to Matty Healy :P This holds up really well after not only repeated listens, but 2 years! Definitely one of Halsey's highlights in her discography. Also, "you were red and you liked me because I was blue" fucking destroys your fave's existence.

**cyborglilith** (9): My baby lives in shades of blue. Blue eyes and jazz, and attitude

**enecks** (9): BAM

**mokitsu** (9): i love the production but the chorus could be better lyric-wise

**tooshorttoofast** (9): I was eyeing the dad the entire time during the music video so I relate to her on a spiritual level. It gets one less point because of that spoken word part tho

**zamomattel** (9): Now ladies THIS is a chorus, but is it spelt with or without a u?

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): This song should be called Daddy Issues (I Got Em). -1 for that little talking bridge thingy, which Taylor also stole. (I'm seeing a pattern here: Taylor Swift stole elements from Badlands for her new album, and I'm predicting her next step is to go bald.) +1 for Pt. II though cause that shit slaps!

**Mrachnie** (8): I like this! It always makes me feel like i have a Tumblr when i listen to it. The spoken word part tho https://media.giphy.com/media/NIYbDsR0aDVeg/giphy.gif

**NapsAndNetflix** (8): Taylor does colours better


**awryj** (7.5): YO LISTEN UP HERES A STORY ABOUT A LITTLE HALSEY THAT LIVES IN A BLUE WORLD AND AAALL DAY AND AAALL NIGHT AND EVERYTHING SHE SEES IS JUST BLUE LIKE HER IN-SIIIDE AND OUT-SIIIDE BLUE HER HOUSE WITH A BLUE LITTLE WINDOW AND A BLUE CORVETTE AND EVERYTHING IS BLUE FOR HER AND HERSELF AND EVERYBODY AROUND CUZ SHE AINT GOT NOBODY TO LISTEEEN

**fifthchevron** (7): Major Taylor vibes, this is definitely something she'd write, and the "oooooh ooooh" even sounds like her. I don't really like Halsey's dramatic tone, it sounds so put on and rehearsed. I wish she'd just sing songs in a more straightforward manner. It always feels like she's playing a character and I think this is why people accuse her of being fake.

**lunasaflowers** (7): Does it get more #tumblrcore? And I mean that in a good way, honestly. This is mad catchy in the weirdest way.

**theNealCutter** (7): so nice song, except the bridge ruins it. Only Lorde can do the talk-bits in a song well. It's so faux-deep. Oh, you are this colour, and I am this colour, and we mixed, but I knew weren't for me, and you don't want me anymore, and I'm sad because I totally, like, didn't see that coming even though it was very obvious." Like fuck off, you knew this was coming Halsey, don't be a baby. AND THE PRE-CHORUS IS SO FUCKING IRRELEVANT. *You're dripping like a saturated sunrise? Spilling like an overflowing sink? I THOUGHT HE WAS HEARTLESS. WHAT'S ABOUT THIS SPILLING DRIPPING SHIT? IS HE CRYING? IS HE SAD? IS HE OVERSHARING? MY GOODNESS TAKE WRITING LESSONS HALSEY. AND OH MY GOD THAT TEARING THROUGH THE FUCKING PAGES LINE DOESN'T HAVE ANY RELEVANCE TO THE SONG. Like where did you mention a notebook? When was he writing? Was he writing at all? ARE YOU EVEN WRITING AT ALL? sound like Summer from Rick and Morty when you sing that bridge halsey. Also for a song titled colours, you only sing like 2 or 3 colours.

**blue\_charles** (6): Honestly, despite being one of her more popular tracks, I don't really care for this one. It's full of the generic Halsey's tropes and stumbles and not in a good way. Also, that bridge. We don't even have to talk about that bridge.

**chipsi1** (6): I don't really hate this. It has a catchy melody and i like the production, but I still think she has absolutely no personality.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Yet another song where I hate the lyrics and dig the instrumentation. Colours is a track that feels so shallow and annoying in its execution. It feels so much more Hot-Topicy than the rest of the album, which is already primetime Hot Topic status. I really do like the instrumental though, it’s just everything else that is awful.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5): Ughhhh Halsey you were starting to win me over! This sounds like a reject from 1989. Lyrics are cringey, and the super poppy production on this throws off the vibe of the album. Part of it might just be that her voice doesn't work on this? Omg I can't with the spoken word bridge. I feel like the reprise would've been cooler to put later in the album (like Liability on Melodrama).

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Why is there a “u” in the track name? Please use the Americanized spelling. “New Americana” didn’t die for this. For a serious comment though, this is the poem based off of Halsey’s famous “lilac sky” poem, and really it felt like a waste. Even if it’s not the deepest thing ever that’s a nice little short poem, and she didn’t seem to know what to do with it? She turned out a painfully generic pop song, squandering an interesting idea and just awkwardly shoving a spoken version of the song into the middle of the track. That long “blue” she sings is the sound of her copping out. I’m also confused by the “Pt. II” because it doesn’t really add or take anything away.

**spaghettibread** (5): this makes me uncomfortable

**strawberryswing1** (5): Taylor Swift wishes Red was this good. Ok on a serious note even though the lyrics are jeuvnile it's pop-py and catchy enough to be like an 8/10, but that talking in the bridge is so cringey that it knocks the score down 3 whole points.

deleted: # Badlands

---

**Overall average**: 7.119 // [User Averages](https://pastebin.com/Gmpmf5ce)

---

All around this is a really good album. I don’t think I give this album enough credit as how much I love it. For one it’s probably the best produced album I’ve ever heard. She captures the mood and emotions perfectly and it’s just amazing. The lyrics however can be really pretentious and edgy and sometimes just really bad but honestly the fact that she commits so hard to it kinda negates that for me and Its just an all around great project

---
**Mrachnie**: While i do enjoy this way more than i will ever admit, it still isn't very good. The production is GREAT on all of the tracks and is the only thing that makes most of these songs tolerable. The lyrics, however, sound like they were written by a 13 y/o.

**mokitsu**: i LOVE this album! the production is great, the choruses are catchy and i absolutely love halsey's lyrics.

**chipsi1**: One of my biggest problems with this is exactly the problem I had with some the songs from Know-It-All, it just doesn't feel geniune. Halsey sounds like she's trying really hard to be as much of a QOTC era Tove Lo clone as possible with the amount of edge in here But the thing is Tove Lo is believable, her personality and struggle is showing and it's easy to believe her every time she does something edgy. Halsey just feels like she completely lacks a personality and tries to make up for it with sounding as edgy as possible.

**mustangs16**: this album often gets a bad rap around here for some reason but i LOVE IT

**gannade**: This album is the best thing Tumblr has given us, but I'm still mixed on it. I'm a huge Lana stan so when Halsey came and started incorporating some of Lana's ethereal sounds into a more radio friendly context, I was all for it. There are plenty of times on the album when Halsey pulls off her youthful edgy schtick successfully, but there are just as many failures. Halsey remains the most frustrating artist I follow, but I'm still a fan.

**dropthehammer11**: This was the album that cemented Halsey as one of the most interesting figures in pop.

**fifthchevron**: I still can't decide if I like Halsey's work or not. It's not terrible but there's something hollow about it too.

**TragicKingdom1**: To me, Badlands is a big bundle of wasted potential. There are good melodies on a lot of songs, and I think Halsey's voice is unique enough to work with this kind of music. However, I think the production on this album is the absolute worst of any pop album of the past few years. Every song is filled to the brim with soulless, bland synths that seem hard-hitting for the sake of being hard-hitting. The instrumentation is so devoid of personality that I'm unable to tell what kind of mood most of the songs are going for, and the tonelessness and just lack of variation makes listening to the album exhausting. I'm really glad Halsey fixed these problems on HFK because now I am able to appreciate her personality through her music whereas I couldn't before.

**jamesfog**: If you can say one thing about this album, it's that it's consistent... maybe to a fault. I kind of wish she switched it up a little bit, but overall it's a good album.

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: I really cannot stand Halsey. This album is not bad at all though. Drive and Gasoline are both very good, and judge me all you want, but New Americana is a bop too. I don't particularly care about the themes of the album, but the production is nice and consistent. Average: 7.33

**whatyourheartdesires**: I thought it would be worse, some songs are really great.

**dirdbub**: when I read the title the first time a few years back I thought "oh, did someone make an album inspired by the video game?" and the answer is absolutely not and also I got the name of the video game wrong, it's Borderlands not Badlands

**Damoojo**: Some songs sounded the same but overall it was good album.

**shineflyer**: I've been trying so hard not to overrate this, but damn, there's not a single song on here I can honestly say is bad.

**enecks**: An inconsistent beautiful dark twisted millennial fantasy. I like Halsey a lot, but Hopeless Fountain Kingdom is definitely better.

**theNealCutter**: It's like Halsey listened to Pure Heroine and Born to Die and said "I want to make an album like this... but shitty and pandering."

**patronsaintofaspies**: I was still on Tumblr when Halsey started to become a thing, so Badlands already has a 'nostalgic' feel for me and a few other people, in a sense. Looking back two years later, maybe Halsey isn't the radical queer saviour most people on that site thought she was, but Badlands isn't honestly that bad. There's no denying that it's a premature album, but you also can't deny that there's a ton of potential in here, especially with songs like Hold Me Down and Roman Holiday. Is it any better than a light 7? Probably not, but Badlands isn't without merit. At any rate, I'm still happy Halsey managed to get her shit together and improve her lyricism for Hopeless Fountain Kingdom. Maybe her third album will be even better. She's an artist that needs time to grow and change, which certainly isn't a bad thing.

**timothy444**: 6.633333333

**SkyBlade79**: I actually love this album. I didn’t really realize it until I rated it, but it’s just so good. There are really no bad songs and I could listen to it nonstop for days. It gets too much hate because it’s “edgy” or whatever. Average : 8.57, which is my highest by far in any popheads rate.

**andreszmtz**: 5.4

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: The first half of Badlands is so much better than the second half tbh. I wish Halsey made the concept of the album a little more clearer in this record because it has potential. I am just glad she was able to fix that issue with her next album tho.

**AFlyingWhale\_**: Not gonna lie I only relistened to this album because of this rate, and I'm so glad I did. Tbh Halsey's always been an artist I'm almost...embarrassed to admit that I like? Badlands is a very very good album though, there's this constant mood going but all the songs sound distinct. I love her super versatile & emotive voice, and the production is A++.

**cyborglilith**: It is time to be scalped again. This is in my top 5 favorite albums.

**InfiniteFireTV**: 7

**Raykel**: Halsey's music constantly has a few seconds of greatness whether it's the instrumentation (that trap-like whistle in Drive) or the melodies (the first 2 lines of Strange Love's chorus) but then she never capitalizes on it. She never takes it to a more interesting place. I hope she improves but this same argument can be applied to hopeless fountain kingdom.

**ComeOnAndSlang**: like every song sounds da same, tf. It’s just all so…. forgettable

**banananaise**: this album is too bloody long. who are all these teenagers who have time for this.

**MashLuke**: this is a hell of a debut album

**Kaylaboe**: Halsey is a very polarizing figure, and this album does reflect that. The highest highs are as tall as the Himalayas, but the lowest of lows are deep in the ocean.

**frankiefrankiefrank**: Never really listened to Halsey before, but I know opinions about her are polarizing (to put it mildly). That being said, I tried my best to go into without preconceived notions and was surprised! Some songs did not click with me, but there were more than a few that really struck me and I'll be listening to for a while.

**amumumyspiritanimal**: Badlands would've been a great album if there was someone to double-check and remove the songs that pull it down. Like, Hold Me Down is a huge major bop but it's between Castle and New Americana which makes it hard to enjoy. This is why HFK is my #2 album of the year. It's not only an actually amazing album but also a huge, HUGE improvement from Badlands afterwork-wise. The songs fit, the mastering is perfect, and everything makes sense. Badlands...it's messy. So many great songs between awful songs make the album a weak work of art. Still, I can't agree with Pitchfork's critics. This is not a bad album. It's decent. It could've been amazing if those few songs were canceled(my average of 6,93 jumps up to 9 without Castle, New Americana, Haunting, and Coming Down). But, again, she proved herself with HFK. I'm looking forward to her future works.

**blueheart**: Badlands is an album that this subreddit liked to drag for a long, long time, but I actually kind of liked it! Turns out people also didn't think it was terrible when actually listening to it. Personally I think she has the strongest production is the best in this rate.

**Elitefourbrad**: This album honestly gets too much hate. It’s clearly the best and most cohesive album in this rate. I think Halsey gets a lot more hate than she’s warranted in getting, especially on the sub. I hope people can look at this album with fresh eyes and not just rate it bad because “tumblr lyrics”.

**blue\_charles**: 6.5

**therokinrolla**: there are the obvious drawbacks of her somewhat forced cringey lyricism, but something demonstrated very well here is her ability to write fantastic hooks and great melodies. A really fun album of bops.

**twat\_brained**: I would bump this every week during my first semester at college and I think it's really shaped the person I've become two years later.

**AbnormalPopPunk**: wheeeee so excited to write paragraphs 4 these i love my girl

**MrsFeatherbottom97**: 8.9

**nooodisaster**: Fun fact: I fucking hated this album the first time I listened to this for the rate. By the end, it's still overwhelmingly meh. Like it kinda grew on me (bc otherwise my average would be around a 5), but still might just be a rash.

**Ghost-Quartet**: I had heard bad things about Badlands and so I wasn’t relishing listening to it for this rate, but after I ended up liking hopeless fountain kingdom I figured I’d give it a shot and try to be unbiased. And it surprised me! I didn’t hate it. I didn’t particularly like it either though. I actually didn’t really have any strong feelings towards it, it’s probably my least favorite album in the rate due to indifference more than distaste. I don’t really buy into the whole “post-apocalyptic future” narrative that Halsey tried to slap onto this album, but I can’t deny that it’s a cool concept with some great visuals.

**WhenYouHaveArrived**: My album average is basically a 6, which feels about right. The best way I could describe this album is “inconsistent.” Every once in a while, everything comes together – music, lyrics, and vocals (See Colors and Roman Holiday). Unfortunately, too often one of these elements is off in most of the songs: the instrumentals are bland and reverby, the vocals are oversung, or the lyrics are cringey and self-serious. Halsey as got some bops, but I totally get the criticisms leveled at her.

**PossumAloysuis**: A solid debut. It has some weak points but it's surprisingly consistent.

**OxfordSemicolon**: There's much more variation between these albums than I expected. Know-it-all is bright, Blue Neighbourhood is #sadgay, and Badlands sounds like someone sandblasted it.

I mean is anyone surprised this won? This is peak moody teenage antisocial angst and it’s rightfully earned its place as an anthem for us moody teens. She combines the angst in her voice with the right drugged up and hazy samples and production to make a beautiful relatable experience. Sure it’s pretentious but honestly you’re a liar if you’re saying you haven’t been somewhere you didn’t want to be.

---
**chipsi1** (11): now THIS is a bop. I love the whole introvert theme and this its her very well. one of the major problems i've had with Alessia in the past is that she doesn't really know what to focus on, but I think this style fits her really well.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): I may be an extrovert but I relate to this song when things go too far.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (11): Everything about this song works, and also exemplifies what makes Alessia unique as an artist. The songwriting feels personal, everything in the production feels like it belongs in the song, and the mix of jazzy-soul and pop is the direction she needs to go with on her next project.

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): Usually I try not to go into a rate already knowing what my 11 is going to be, but I kinda figured that this would be my 11, and after giving everything a listen it still is. I adore this song, but also hate it because it sends me into a panic attack every time I listen to it. It gives me a really visceral reaction, and as someone attending college, this is what parties are like for me. Every party I go to I always think “this will be the one that I finally have fun at” and then it always ends sadly. I’ve spent quite a few nights wandering unfamiliar neighborhoods as I escape from a party where all of my friends are having a good time but I’m just kind of… not, but I don’t want to leave for real because then I’m just a stick in the mud so I stick around in this sort of party limbo waiting for everyone else to clue in to the fact that something’s wrong with me. This song captures that experience very well. I remember I mentioned this song to my friend once, a real party girl, and she said she hated the song. I asked her why and she said, and this is a direct quote, “Bitch, leave!” First of all, in the song she states that she carpooled to the party with her friends so she can’t leave without them, but second of all, it’s not that simple. People who enjoy parties don’t understand the stress and pressure that they can put introverted people under. We’re constantly told that we should be having a good time at these social gatherings, but I find they’re just loud and obnoxious if you aren’t drunk or high or on molly or cocaine or whatever these people are popping. And you kind of feel like there’s something wrong with you for not having fun, because you came to the party to hang out with your friends because you love them but quickly you find that they’re drunk and distracted and you’re alone with a bunch of strangers and it’s just not what you envisioned at all. But parties are a big part of social life for a lot of people, so you end up being an outsider and miss out on sharing the experience with everybody else and it’s just depressing. I hate parties, I’ve stopped going to them, but I still adore this song because it puts that idea into words perfectly. It’s also just a really great song, it’s kind of out of place on the album because none of the other songs really sound like it but Alessia really sells the song and she has a great flow. I like that thing she does with her voice when she sings “o-o-oh here” because it really makes her sound like she’s panicking or on the verge of tears, which is very appropriate.

**letsallpoo** (11): There's really no other option for my 11 in this rate. By far my favorite song in this rate and one of my favorites from these past years. Alessia showed such promise with this song as a debut and I still have high hopes for her even though her output since this hasn't been up to par.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): itll be realllllllyyyy hard for her to top this song... it was so abstract lyrically and production wise when it hit the scene. even if it kinda sounded like some stuff, it had something special about it

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): I feel this is her classic song, and one I really like. She did the party narrative thing two years before Lorde! I love the lyrics and the way she delivers them, it's almost rap-like. And the constant here/hear refrain just works.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): Alessia proving again that she is the relatable queen we know she is. Here is the party bop of a generation, were everyone feels anxious yet no one is changing the things they feel bad about.

**blue\_charles** (10): there's a reason this was Alessia's break out single

**ComeOnAndSlang** (10): queen of relatable lyrics

**Damoojo** (10): My loner ass loves this song.

**dirdbub** (10): those are some long ass verses

**dropthehammer11** (10): Absolutely incredible song, and it's her DEBUT SINGLE.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Okay I can relate to this so much. It’s about just being “here” at a party but not knowing anyone or just not caring. Sometimes I’m just at a party and want to go because I don’t know what I’m doing there.

**enecks** (10): OK so I was going to drag this but I had a really bad party recently so it is now relatable to me. It just sounds sleek and bombastic, which contrasts with the detail-heavy lyrics. Some criticize this for Alessia being petty and self-indulgent but nah this works and is relatable af.

deleted: **gannade** (10): I was so shook when Alessia came out of nowhere with this song!! This is the most ambitious debut on mainstream radio since Alicia's "Fallin'" I LOVE the sample, the lyrics, and above all, Alessia's attitude. Usually these anti-party anthems have darker or depressing lyrics, but Alessia exudes confidence and self-assurance in her own introverted inclinations. Truly #relatable. The music industry has become saturated with these moody #relatable teenage singers, but this song still has the truest illustration of a teenage party: "Hours later congregratin' next to the refrigerator/Some girl talking about her haters ... she ain't got none."

**jamesfog** (10): Love the message of this song, even if people think it's too /r/lewronggeneration

**MashLuke** (10): I used to relate to this a lot, I would annoy Alessia 100% now

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): the male backing vocals are the only thing annoying in this song

**mokitsu** (10): this is a great song, and it's obvious why it's her breakout hit. the production is amazing, the portishead sample and the spoken word bits really create an eerie and nocturnal atmosphere, and the lyrics tell a story and are relatable to everyone.

**Mrachnie** (10): This is one of the times gets close to actual R&B and this sound fits her really well. The lyrics are #relatable and it's very catchy for a slow song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Do extroverts find this song annoying? As much as I relate to it, I can see how the stereotypical party behaviour that Alessia describes would be too cliche for other people. Well, maybe social interaction involves a lot more nuance compared to Here's lyrics, but it's still an anthem if you happen to be an introvert like me. As you can guess from my username, parties make me feel extremely uncomfortable to the point of experiencing mental anguish. A lot of neurotypical people, even introverted ones, don't understand the social awkwardness I experience, and Here is the closest song I have that lines up with my experiences when it comes to social gatherings. It's nice to see that songs like this can hit the top five; finally, us shy people have a non-romantic song to relate to.

**spaghettibread** (10): invented parties

**strawberryswing1** (10): I don't understand people's problem with this song...do people really not relate to this in some way? Like, it's so on point. If you can't relate you probably don't go to many parties tbh.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Probably the best and only really good song on the entire album. It set the bar real high for her career, at least for me, because it was a really sophisticated, smart, and well-crafted track. I love the rapid fire flow and the lyricism in general, because it’s really strong and seamless. It perfectly describes parties for me and I think it’s a pretty damn great track.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Uh oh time for another assay, this time slightly more depressing. In retrospect, this song is a little too "I'm better than all these people around me", but at the time this song came out, it was the most relatable thing ever. There were times when I experienced literally what she's describing in the song, people smoking incredible amounts of weed, parties that seemed so pointless, etc. My best friend was one of those people that partied so hard, so every weekend I had to choose between going out and regretting it, or staying in and wondered what it'd be like if I did go out. 2 years later, I'm a little less anxious and have a better group of friends, but I still find myself relating to this song now and then. Truly an anthem for people like me (and I'm not gonna label this "type of person" as anything cause I know introverts, shy people, anxious people, depressed people, etc. all come in different forms and deal with it in different ways, so yeah.) Great song though.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): Sample makes the song. I don't hate the lyrics as much as other people.

**cyborglilith** (9.5): This is relatable ans is also a bop. Thanks, Alessia!

**Dracyoshi** (9.5): These lyrics are brilliant and Alessia sounds fantastic. You can feel the tension and atmosphere; through both the lyrics, vocals and production. If I just liked the "Oh-Oh-Oh Here" hook a bit more this would be a perfect song imo, but I find it a bit annoying. :(

**ExtraEater** (9.5): i love the ike's rap sample and the iconic songs it's been used in (portishead's glory box, tricky's hell is round the corner), and alessia carries the torch pretty well

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): Ok, imagine being me, a lonely high school senior who hates going to parties and always has headphones on in class. Most of the songs I'm hearing on the radio are about parties and I'm just barely starting to embrace pop music as my favorite genre, and then this song about being an introvert at a party comes on. I instantly fall in love with it. The lyrics are so true to me. The lyric "some girl's talking bout her haters, she ain't got none," instantly becomes one of my favorite lyrics ever because of how goddamn true it is. This would easily become my 11 back then, now it's a 9.5 cause it can be a bit pretentious and cause All My Friends from Snakehips is a better anti-party song, but damn if this song didn't have a big impact on me senior year.

**fifthchevron** (9): I somehow missed this song when it was big but I see why it was successful. Love the old school R&B vibe. I don't really get the point of the song though? Was she really forcibly dragged to so many parties? Just...say no?

**mustangs16** (9): i actually went back and gave this a higher score after listening to the rest of the album; it's definitely one of the (few, imo) standout tracks

**shineflyer** (9): the most #Relatable song. parties aren't my thing either. but really, this is a cool throwback style. Meghan wishes

**theNealCutter** (9): she should've been a fully fledged RnB artist. seriously, the stark piano paired with the jazzy (or so I think) going over her verbose, frantic, anxious delivery works so well. the only flaw I can honestly think is the r/iamverysmart lyric (we can kick it and listen to some music with the message like we usually do.)

**tooshorttoofast** (9): im the girl in the kitchen gossiping about her friends oops

**VeganSquash** (9): why didnt she leave the party?

**therokinrolla** (8.8): if “here” isnt the top 10 then the sub is canceled

**twat\_brained** (8.8): I definitely think this song is most resonant with the introvert crowd, and the video's got an interesting concept too: being the only sober one at a party where you haven't delved into your id-driven subconscious that's only driven by alcohol. That being said, there is a sense of pretentiousness within this song that somewhat drags it back, but not too much. Also, if you're at a party, just come up with an excuse to leave, such as "I have to collaborate with an EDM artist!" or "I have to perform at the VMAs!". Standard stuff, you know?

**nooodisaster** (8): At once relatable yet cringey. "Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator /Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters; she ain't got none" bumps this song up at least half a point.

**Raykel** (8): Some lines have ~le wrong generation ~ vibes, but it's catchy.

**banananaise** (7.5): i've been trying for the last hour to find what the instrumental around the chorus reminds me of and i JUST found it - Midnight Garden by Bond which is the weirdest childhood music memory for me

**lunasaflowers** (7.5): The production and Alessia's singing is really pleasant, but the subject matter is one of those things where, while it definitely comes from a real place a lot of people feel, when you've grown past that better-than-the-cool-kids kinda attitude, it feels a bit cringy. I do respect the song, though. (Also, I love the 2:00 A.M. version.)

**awryj** (6.8): Portishead who? This sample works great here, but I'm not a fan of the lyrics. I'm a self-proclaimed introvert and I think they're really klutzy, or maybe just unfortunate. I mean, why did she even choose to be at this party? Did someone force her to go there? The lyrics go too far into /r/lewronggeneration territory.

**harmonyunoxx** (6): I remember the first time I heard this song. It was when Taylor was doing her final American date for the 1989 world tour and she brought Alessia out as a special guest and that's how I found her music.

**timothy444** (5.5): ADoseOfBuckley explains why I'm not really fond of this song. Also, I always confuse this song with "Hideaway" by Daya, which is also a song I don't like.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (3): I didn’t like this song when it was popular, and I don’t care for it much upon relistening. The instrumental has this weird tension that never resolves and gets annoying really fast. I could see teenagers relating to these lyrics, but as a 24 year old man, they really aren’t striking a chord with me.

**zamomattel** (2.5): Party Pooper - The Song

**MrSwearword** (1): petulant as fuck but the thing that sets me off the most is when she sings “But honestly I'd rather be/Somewhere with my people/We can kick it and just listen to/Some music with a message, like we usually do” NO. SHOVE THIS PRETENTIOUS SENTIMENT. JUST. SHOVE IT.

**SkyBlade79** (1): The whole concept of this song annoys me to no end. Wow! Alessia Cara stars in the feature film “Here”, about a super unique and individualistic teenager with a superiority complex at a TOTALLY lame party! She is there just to make the party bad for everyone else, but she has a victim complex, and tries to make herself look cool by talking about “music with a message” and “her beanie”. She’s just so monotone throughout the whole thing. That sample with the deep voice is also horrible, and you can’t really pay attention to anything other than it.

**Overall average**: 7.111 // [User Averages](https://pastebin.com/69w7NHRN)

All in all I think this is a really good album. I flip flop all the time whether I really love it or it’s just ok. It can be really pretentious, it can have really basic lyrics that don’t feel genuine, and it can be just plain generic at points. However I discovered this album at a time when I really needed it and it’s so deeply personal to me and for that I look past all its faults and for that I may over rate it but I genuinely do love this thing.

---
**Mrachnie**: This album is different from the other two because it takes a lot of inspiration from R&B and Soul music, and, for the most part, the instrumentals here are great. While the lyrics are sometimes lacking, some of them show a lot of potential. Overall, this was a good album which would have worked much better as a 6-track EP.

**mokitsu**: serving PRISM realness....first half full of bops, generic, boring ballads for the second half.

**mustangs16**: a LOT of this album sounded the same to me :/

**dropthehammer11**: She's gonna be a superstar. This album proved it.

**fifthchevron**: Started really strong, first six songs flow really well together. Then it becomes very monotonous. Some more inventive production and vocal performances would've been a good idea. I like that she sings about many different topics.

**TragicKingdom1**: Know-It-All is not an album that inspires a lot of emotion or criticism from me. It has some good songs. It has some really boring and underdeveloped songs. It is trying to be Pure Heroine, and although it never reaches the lyrical highs of that album, it matches it at points in production and overall vibe. It's worth a listen I guess if you know you're into this kind of music, but I wouldn't bat an eye if someone said they've decided to skip it.

**jamesfog**: This is a pretty solid first album! It has hits and hardly any filler. A nice effort from Alessia.

**letsallpoo**: The best songs are the ones that were on the EP. Everything else is pretty bad imo.

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: Here is definitely the stand-out, and there are plenty of good songs. There is also filler though, which there really shouldn't be in a 12-song album. Overall, it's solid, but I think she has the potential to release a better album soon. Average: 7.29

**whatyourheartdesires**: Really good, I am sorry I wasn't a big fan before. Alessia will be a superstar for sure

**dirdbub**: /u/ffourthofjulyAlien why is your album very average

**Damoojo**: A good album.

**shineflyer**: Alessia seems similar to Ariana - great voice, muddy enunciation.

**enecks**: It's actually not trash? It is consistently at the 7/10 level with a few standouts and a couple of lowlights and a messy bad song in the form of Scars to Your Beautiful.

**theNealCutter**: a good collection of songs. but not a good cohesive project. i honestly play this album in a different order so the songs follow a story. but it shows so much potential that she has. her direct and vivid lyricism paired with an emotive delivery makes her one of the more promising of all the Post-Lorde artists.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Alessia definitely looked like the most generic artist here, and I heard some people express their disappointment with the second half of the album, so I was prepared for an experience that would be little more than decent. Obviously, I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, maybe what Alessia brings to the table isn't anything super radical, but she does her shtick better than a lot of other teenage artists, and I don't think anything on here really seems that manufactured or carried out. The jazzy elements in here are pretty mild, but they give me hope that the poppy side of the genre didn't completely die out with Amy Winehouse. Some of the ballads here were unnecessary, but overall? Know-It-All is pretty good. Though, I am pretty curious about how Alessia's going to mature as an artist since a substantial part of her current image is about being an adolescent. Lorde managed to leave behind that era with grace; will Alessia? We'll see.

**timothy444**: 7.416666667

**SkyBlade79**: Not an amazing album, with a lot of highs and lows and not much in the middle. Average: 5.455

**andreszmtz**: 7

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: This is such a great debut album for Alessia. There's nothing really special about this album but Alessia delievers the relatable bops here.

**AFlyingWhale\_**: I really want to like Alessia. Sometimes she has really well-written and relatable lyrics, and we could always use another Lorde. I just find the production awfully on and off, like sometimes its great and complements her vocals perfectly, then other times it's just boring. I don't know :x

**cyborglilith**: lol this is mostly filler bye alessia

**InfiniteFireTV**: 6.5

**Raykel**: How is she self aware enough to call herself a know-it-all but unself-aware enough to then perfectly encapsulate that stereotype? Hopefully her next album will be less fake feel good. I can see her going a bit darker and pulling it off.

**ComeOnAndSlang**: love some African American representation in today’s pop industry x)

**MashLuke**: I wish she knew how to write an album

**Kaylaboe**: Overall a pretty solid album! Having a few tracks fewer than the other two in this rate, it doesn't really have much filler in it, and the best songs are really good.

**frankiefrankiefrank**: I think this album shows a lot of the potential Alessia has, even if it also shows some missteps. When her voice and songwriting shine through, you get a sense that she has the capability of becoming a great artist.

**amumumyspiritanimal**: Alessia is honestly an amazing artist. This album is perfect. I have no idea why people call her a Lorde copycat when her style is completely different.

**blueheart**: Alessia is the artist that grew on me most thanks to this rate, mostly because I already loved Troye and Halsey. However, Know It All has it's high points, and it has low points, and it has a lot of boring points.

**Elitefourbrad**: Honestly, I was impressed at the good on this album and disappointed in the bad.

**blue\_charles**: 6.8

**therokinrolla**: this is a cute album. Its a really nice show of adolescence and unlike many albums that try for it this feels natural, and not-forced, if at sometimes it gets a little cheesy.

**twat\_brained**: Well, I don't know it **all**, but I **DO** know that Alessia's Canadian, just like myself!🇨🇦 I also know she [stans Lorde as hard as I do.](https://imgur.com/SAYj3tJ)

**MrsFeatherbottom97**: 6.1

**nooodisaster**: I'm really glad I discovered this album through this rate. She's so wholesome, I stan.

**Ghost-Quartet**: I always say that Know-It-All is the album that I would write if I wrote an album. It’s not perfect, but it’s got heart. It’s corny and a little over the top, but it comes from a place of love and enthusiasm. Everything about this album is relatable to me. Being a “know-it-all” is something that I’ve struggled with my entire life, and I like the context in which she frames it. She feels like she knows everything and she tries to, but at the same time she’s clouded by flaws and uncertainty. This is my favorite album in the rate, I actually had to go back in and restore most of these because after I gave the album scores the first time I gave over half of the album 10s, which is odd because I will be the first to admit that this album isn’t super great. I just really like it. Whatever Alessia’s selling, I’m buying.

**WhenYouHaveArrived**: My average score for this album was a bit above a 5, but I don’t think this is a bad album. It’s just an album not made for me, a 24 year old man. Alessia is a good vocalist and I enjoy her most on any song that is R&B flavored. I would love to see her go more in that direction instead of the Lorde-esque sounds she toyed with on this album.

**PossumAloysuis**: An almost perfect album that is way too underrated.

**OxfordSemicolon**: I wish the second half was as good as the first.

twat_brained: No the worst Tumblr album is *Title* by Meghan Trainor and to an extent *Thank You* since she tries to validate and give a voice to "SJW's" who really just preach misandry while at the same time expressing ideologies and values which are incredibly backwards and regressive while having intolerable filler.

Being fake deep is better than being a fake feminist

I just hate how mature Heaven was, just to place it next to a immature, subpar escapist pop song. It's Wild but the lyrics are pointless.

amumumyspiritanimal: well shit i missed day 3 but tbh i dont even care, no troye in the top 3, but at least YOUTH was his highest song, i gave him the best score, and BLUE NEIGHBORHOODS IS THE BEST ALBUM OUT OF THE 3 ACCORDING TO POPHEADS HAHA YOU HOES YOU OUTPLAYED YALLSELVES
