https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/73qkn9/rate_the_moody_teen_pop_rate_knowitall_vs/

[Welcome to the Moody Teen Pop rate!](https://i.imgur.com/FcI0FOo.png)

Grab a latte, your favorite sweater, and let me take you back. It’s 2015 and everything sucks. The world sucks, love sucks, parents suck, and growing up just sucks in general. How do you grow up in a world that feels so bleak? Well hopefully these three artists work will give you some kind of idea. This will be the second time [r/popheads](https://www.reddit.com/r/geekheads/comments/620p3r/netflix_original_series_rate/) will be dealing with “tumblrcore” artists in rates but this time with a twist. This time we are focusing on the existential dread and growing pains of teens. Alessia, Troye, and Halsey have all made it big on being teens and speaking for the millennial generation. Love, heartbreak, learning who you really are, learning who everyone else really are all apart of the stories these three have to tell. 


But who are these losers you ask? Why should I care about these angsty, pretentious, know it all  teenages? Well I can’t answer that question but they have made some pretty cool songs so maybe just give it a chance!

Here went on to become a smash hit reaching a peak of number 5 in the US on the billboard charts and number 19 in her home country. Shortly after came her debut album Know-It-All released November 13, 2015. The album reached number 9 in the US and number 8 in Canada.

The album explores themes of growing up, love, and heartbreak. In this album Alessia wears her true colors of being the wallflower confused teenager just trying to find her way in the world and trying to figure out if she really knows it all or not. Sonically this album explores many R&B and pop influences.

[Halsey](https://i.imgur.com/SssVOtN.jpg) - [Badlands](https://i.imgur.com/lsESNxy.png)
Ashley Frangipane an American pop star born in Clark, New Jersey. Her stage name is a reference to the Halsey Street station of the New York City Subway in Brooklyn, and an anagram of her first name. She made her start by posting her debut single “Ghost” to soundcloud February 3, 2014. The song gained in popularity and allowed her to sign with her label Astralwerks. Shortly after she released her debut EP “Room 93” on October 27, 2014. Nearly a year later she released her debut album “Badlands” August 28, 2015 and it reached #2 in the US on the billboard chart. Since the release of this album Halsey has also been featured in huge songs and become a pop tar herself. Most notably she was featured in The Chainsmokers song [Closer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT2_F-1esPk) which was number 1 for 12 weeks. 

According to Halsey Badlands is a concept album that focuses on the fictional dystopian society known as The Badlands. The city is surrounded by a desert wasteland, keeping the inhabitants of The Badlands captive. The album was inspired by post-apocalyptic movies such as The Fifth Element. After writing the first few songs, Halsey came to the realization that the entire concept was a metaphor for her mental state. She explores themes of love and trying to fit in with society. Sonically this album explores many electro-pop and dark pop influences.

**The Rules**

- Listen to **each song** and assign each a score between **1 and 10**. Decimals are fine, but please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two decimal spots: giving a **7.2 is okay, but giving a 7.25 will give me a headache**. This is because I'm using letsallpoos program to parse the votes and print everything out. 

- **ATTENTION EUROPE AND THE REST OF THE WORLD: IF YOU WANT TO USE A DECIMAL DO NOT USE A COMMA THIS IS MERICAN RULES**


- Yes, you have to listen to every song. I will not accept your ballot if you have a score missing. That's because it will crash the program.


- Your scores should **NOT** be considered confidential.


- You may give **ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11.** This is ONE song total, NOT ONE SONG PER ALBUM. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; **excessive sabotage ruins rate results**. And don't forget it's not required to use these! Please don't give out 0's and 11's just because!


- You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again afterwards.


- To make things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on my part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. **The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to use the pre-prepared link that I have put all over this post**, such as right [here](https://goo.gl/ThfZpY). PLEASE USE THAT. You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores.


- If you don't follow the format, I'll still accept your ballot, but **I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions.**


- If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. **Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!**


- **If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!**

- **I can't believe I even have to say this but don't change the submission ballot it just messes everything up** 

- If, after submitting your scores, you change your mind about a certain song please feel free to message me about changing scores and I will be happy to oblige

**This is the ONE AND ONLY correct format:**
>New Americana: 10 wow an iconic relatable song!

**These are INCORRECT, in fact, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:**
>New Americana: 1: New Ameritrash!

>New Americana: New Ameritrash! 1

>New Americana: I'm giving this a 1 because it’s trash like America!

>New Americana: 1-New Ameritrash!

>New Americana: 1 (New Ameritrash!)

___
If you read all of that thank you so much! I know that these albums may have a bit of a reputation to them but I hope that everyone can put down their preconceptions and maybe try to experience something new!
