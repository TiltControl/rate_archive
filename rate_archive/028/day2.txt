**Lowest Scores:** (0 x2) bluehxrizon, Damoojo (1 x2) letsallpoo, MrSwearword 

---
Man this song is so fun and the chorus melody is great and then the rap ruins it. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs bad but it‚Äôs just unnecessary and throws off the flow

---

**bluehxrizon** (0): i dont know who allday is but his verse totally ruins this for me!

**Damoojo** (0): Is there a reason why this isn't in uppercase?

---
**agentofscranton** (10): I‚Äôm choosing to ignore that cringe af rap verse

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): Gahw this is the cutest song ever. Seriously I can't listen to for him. without feeling kinda bad that I don't have a boyfriend. It's gay, chill, and cute. Perfect song.

**cyborglilith** (10): omg this is a bop. OMG THIS IS A BOP. OMG THIS IS A BOPPPPPPPP

**dirdbub** (10): wow, a gay song? on a gay song? shocker,

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This song is what being young and in love is like. Not the honeymoon phase, but the feeling of being comfortable with someone. It feels conversational and the production rolls along in a way that's natural.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): This is my only non-adjusted 10 on the album and I'm sure you're thinking 'WTF Patron why' but I'm going to confess that I love the swingy elements here. It's an 11 contender along with Four Pink Walls for that reason. It's gay, it's a bop, it's jazzy and it's perfect. Pretty much one of my theme songs.

**SkyBlade79** (10): very cute! The chorus is also super nice

**zamomattel** (9.5): dis cute i vibe

**Elitefourbrad** (9): Connor Franta is shook.

**lunasaflowers** (9): Troye blessing the people with the happy gay boy bop the world needed! AllDay's verse isn't great, but the rest of the song compensates for any points it might've knocked off TBH.

**PossumAloysuis** (9): Another enjoyable song but again with the random verses

**blue\_charles** (8): aside from the god-awful (and I do mean GOD AWFUL) rap, this is one of the best songs on the album. It's just that verse... that fucking verse...

**chipsi1** (8): I actually love this.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (8): corny but good

**harmonyunoxx** (8): it's already gay but the panic ref makes it even gayer in my book

**shineflyer** (8): this is so smooth and chill. it's what I want on the soundtrack to my life

**strawberryswing1** (8): this was a 8.5 before the feature came on

**theNealCutter** (8): i like this song. the hiphop beat, his cool and fun delivery, the endearing lyrics is just infectious... until the rap comes along. there's a cheesy panic! at the disco reference. there's a bruno mars reference. there's ass kneading stuff, and to top it all off, the voice just doesn't fit the production. I like the live one where Troye sings an new bridge verse instead.

**tooshorttoofast** (8): this song is SO CUTE and the whistles are addictive

**TragicKingdom1** (8): Allday's verse is kind of weak but pretty charming otherwise.

**twat\_brained** (8): I guess this song is okay. It's no TMD or Quiet but it's good. Also from what I can tell Allday just seems likes another G-Eazy/Mac Miller type but they sound good here too. Not sure what else to say.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): It‚Äôs funny, he used a Blue+Red=Purple metaphor way better than Halsey did and Halsey almost literally got famous off the concept. Other than that though this is a really cute track, and AllDay provides the best guest feature on the album. He fits the flow of the song and he keeps it brief.

**awryj** (7): Don't vape, kids.

**Kaylaboe** (7): not gonna lie the sudden lower-cap-capitalisation bothers me

**nooodisaster** (7): He went lowercase for this?? :/

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Not the biggest fan of the lyrics here. Everything feels a little awkward, and the chorus isn‚Äôt as strong as some of the other songs. It‚Äôs impossible to deny the instrumental bops, but I don‚Äôt find the switchup during the hook as interesting as it could be, frankly. Still a nice cute track though.

**spaghettibread** (6.5): because theres a period in the title

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6): "You don't have to say I love you to say I love you"?? He's talking about nonverbal communication/hints but that was one of my WTF lines in the album.

**fifthchevron** (6): The rap ruins it entirely.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): This song is so cute but holy fuck that rap verse is so out of place its damn offensive.

**MashLuke** (6): The rap is bad, the rest is bland.

**VeganSquash** (6): the money honey part gives me halsey's 'the prologue' vibes

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (6): Not a bad song, but nothing really grabs me about it. The rapper has a cute accent tho.

**gannade** (5): omg im so tired i want to sleep but im so close to finishing this rate but so far away. all these troye songs sound the same and its really boring. also why is this song lower case and ends with a period when the rest of the album is all upper case. is this song supposed to be special? why doesnt it sound better then? troye please

**mokitsu** (5): cute

**OxfordSemicolon** (5): I want to like this song, and most of it is good, but that rap verse is SO BAD.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): I like "you don't have to say I love you to say I love you", but that's a high point on an otherwise forgettable song.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (3): this song is incredibly underwhelming

**Mrachnie** (3): This had the potential to be so much better than it was. I love the drum-heavy instrumental, but the rest... "You don't have to say I love you to say I love you" wow king invented lyrics could you believe. Also he's back to collaborating with nonames! The rap verse is painfully corny, the wordplay is forced and the backing... xylophone? only makes it worse. I want Walmart Azealia back.

**MrSwearword** (1): that rap section is bullshit and essentially fucked up a perky take on most of the recycled beatwork on this album. Ugh, I really hate that rap.

A nice sweet song about growing up. I really relate to this song because I‚Äôm sentimental as heck about the places and the people and the things I did growing up. That said the song is a bit boring if I‚Äôm being honest.

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): This is like a perfect fusion of a Troye and Lorde song. Bit depressing, bit broody, and very much relatable.

**tooshorttoofast** (10): makes me reminisce of the suburbs ive never lived in

**PossumAloysuis** (9.5): The strings in the back are nice. Well arranged

**fifthchevron** (9): HAVE YOU HEARD ME ON THE RADIO? DID YOU TURN IT UP? yes i did troye.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9): This song makes you sit and think about how your life has gone so far and where it's gonna go next. I'm too young for this level of nostalgia!

**lunasaflowers** (9): I really like this, wow! This is a good slice of melancholy nostalgia.

**theNealCutter** (9): that production is amazing. that subtle strings, that rumbling hihats at the backs, that beat and synth fit so well. the lyrics are nice and juvenile too. also that Oh Wonder reference is so cute.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): This reminds me of the show The Wonder Years.

**spaghettibread** (8.3): another alright I guess

**nooodisaster** (8): This song just makes me feel some sort of way. It's like if peak Lana was a gay teenage boy.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I'm still not sure what the exact definition of a suburb is but I'm lower middle class and I live in a poor neighbourhood, so I guess I relate to this? Am I misunderstanding the meaning? Good song regardless.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (7.5): Good song, but sort of a mild way to end the standard edition of the album.

**twat\_brained** (7.1): I don't hate it but it's not all that memorable to me. In other words‚Ä¶ FILLER.

**enecks** (7): Jesus of Suburbia outsold outwigged

**gannade** (7): I love the suburbs so much. It's just so beautiful.

**strawberryswing1** (6.5): bit boring

**zamomattel** (6.5): as i am from the suburbs, this is genuinely relatable

**awryj** (6): Sounds like a Pure Heroine reject (inb4 the whole rate is Pure Heroine rejects)

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I appreciate that Troye doesn‚Äôt just diss suburbia, which is all too common. There‚Äôs nothing necessarily wrong with a slow, easygoing lifestyle, despite it so often being demonized these days. Even if you want to get out, it‚Äôs still home, a place full of people, and people are important.

**MashLuke** (6): I don't even remember how this sounds like tbh

**shineflyer** (6): those strings feel so warm, but I feel like there should be a better melody to go with it.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Pretty forgettable track, unfortunately. The lyrics are kinda nice, but this one kinda bores me. Instrumental is less developed than the other ones, and the piano doesn‚Äôt feel right.

**Mrachnie** (5): This is rough. The trap-inspired beats are back. He also namedrops Oh Wonder for some fucking reason. It's also pure filler.

**mustangs16** (5): is this album ever going to end

**Elitefourbrad** (4): Troye trying to trick me into clicking on this instead of Disturbia, wow. I hate you even more Troye.

**mokitsu** (4): boring

**SkyBlade79** (4): this is literally Troye‚Äôs New Americana

**cyborglilith** (3): Suburbia is trash but it fits the album aesthetic. What else can I say? ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**MrSwearword** (3): if it‚Äôs going for dramatics like any kid feels if they‚Äôre miserable in Suburban America/anywhere, then mission accomplished. If it tried for anything original or meaningful, mission failed.

**Average:** 7.133 **// Total Points:** 520.7 **// Controversy:** 1.684

---
**Highest scores:** (11 x3) agentofscranton, blueheart, tooshorttoofast (10 x2) AFlyingWhale\_, amumumyspiritanimal (9.5 x1) andreszmtz (9.3 x1) 1998tweety (9 x6) ExtraEater, InfiniteFireTV, Kaylaboe, mirandacrocsgrove, MrsFeatherbottom97, PossumAloysuis (8.5 x3) bwc222, thenshecamelikeaaah, TragicKingdom1 

**Lowest Scores:** (2 x1) Elitefourbrad 

---
This is a really cute and chill song. I definitely gets early morning vibes from this. The harmonies are kinda annoying being so high pitched but otherwise Broods is great in this song.

---
**agentofscranton** (11): god this song just hits so close to home for me being at a point in my life where everything is just so complicated with university and my personal life, and knowing that it only gets harder from here

**blueheart** (11): It's comforting. It's calling someone on the telephone in the middle of the night to hear their voice. It's one of the good features on this album.

**tooshorttoofast** (11): the lyrics and production are incredible and everything about the song is perfect, especially when you're feeling alone or down

---

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): I'm giving it a 10 purely on account of Broods. I miss Georgia Nott's older wispier vocals :( and I really like the line "and all this drivin' is drivin' me crazy"

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): Broods are such a perfect addition to this song. The 3 voices work amazingly well together, creating this great aesthetic and ghostly mood.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (9): i honestly wish Georgia‚Äôs part was longer, but i love the duet parts in the song. This leaves me wanting for more collaboration between these two artists. Hopefully, Broods can get a hold of my bb Troye for Broods 3.

**PossumAloysuis** (9): Reminds me of a warm summer day. Love the background vocals

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): I looove the hook (again)! And Broods did her (their?) thing.

**blue\_charles** (8): this kinda makes me wanna cry but that's this whole album really.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8): Omg I just noticed the marimba in the chorus and I am loving the attention to detail in this production. The song doesn't hit you the way some of the best tracks do but it's still beautiful.

**lunasaflowers** (8): This song feels really gentle and comforting...Broods's backing vocals contribute to the soft aura really well.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Love the marching band-like intro in the beginning, the pre-chorus (I sing it a lot in the car), and the subtle feature here. It‚Äôs a really soft and beautiful little song, and I hope it doesn‚Äôt get fucked by all the more bombastic tracks.

**twat\_brained** (7.9): A lovely tune albeit nothing too memorable.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): It's no "Chinese", but I'll tolerate it.

**dirdbub** (7): god this album's production is just completely on point

**enecks** (7): "Troye, Melanie, Halsey, twentyonepilots, Panic! At the disco and the neighbourhood saved our music generation ( just looked back on these comments and you guys all are completing this actual comment since I forgot so many great artists/ bands! Thank you guys!)"

**MashLuke** (7): This is cute. His vocal style is a bit monotone but this track is nice

**mokitsu** (7): cool production, broods saved this song.

**Mrachnie** (7): Taking vocal inspiration from Selena Gomez i see. I still think that the song is pretty, but the instrumental doesen't really match the feeling that the lyrics of the song give off. If i just read the lyrics i would imagine this being a ballad. Also i have no idea who Broods is but she sounds better than Troye on this song.

**OxfordSemicolon** (7): This is the only on the album that really helps the song.

**theNealCutter** (7): too much drums to let the melody shine.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (7): A solid track, but definitely not one of my faves. I enjoy the chorus and Broods is a nice touch on the bridge, but it doesn‚Äôt quite stack up to the quality of the previous 3 songs. Still good!

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): It's not very different from BITE, but it manages to be just a touch more forgettable save for the chorus. Title indicates everything-it's decent, and it's perfect for easy listening, but it's not something I would bop to on its own.

**fifthchevron** (6): The drum beat doesn't quite match with the vibe of the song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): No matter how many times I listen to this track I can‚Äôt really remember anything about it, it‚Äôs pure filler but for what it‚Äôs worth when I‚Äôm actually listening to it it‚Äôs kinda nice? Despite listening to this album many times I did not realize that it featured someone until I was looking at the lyrics to write this comment, so that means that these ‚ÄúBroods‚Äù person(s?) are forgettable.

**shineflyer** (6): the chorus is very sweet and romantic, but I feel like the verses could have used work. Broods sounds angelic as usual, though <3

**spaghettibread** (6): more meh

**zamomattel** (6): omg Troye u r so easy

**awryj** (5.5): I would probably like it better if Broods sang it by herself (is it a band? EDIT: yes it is) tbh... Troye is not a vocalist.

**cyborglilith** (5): forgettable

**ImADudeDuh** (5): I'd expect a song called EASE to be a little more calming

**SkyBlade79** (5): this mixing is horrible lol. I like the synths but that‚Äôs it.

**MrSwearword** (4): the [recycled] drum pattern/beat is wearing thin but he isn‚Äôt doing much of anything with it.

**Elitefourbrad** (2): yawn, snoozzzzzzzzzzzeeeeeeeeeeee

This is the point in the album where you realize this is all perfect driving music. There‚Äôs something about this song that‚Äôs so sensual and chill and it‚Äôs just a perfect follow up to drive and even better as an intro to Roman Holiday

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): bop

**blueheart** (10): I would still give this song a 10 if it was just that prechorus.

**cyborglilith** (10): üëåüëÄüëåüëÄüëåüëÄüëåüëÄüëåüëÄ good shit go‡±¶‘Å sHitüëå thats ‚úî some goodüëåüëåshit rightüëåüëåthereüëåüëåüëå right‚úîthere ‚úî‚úîif i do ∆Ωa“Ø so my self üíØ i say so üíØ thats what im talking about right there right there (chorus:  ≥·∂¶·µç ∞·µó ·µó ∞·µâ ≥·µâ) mMMMM·é∑–úüíØ üëåüëå üëå–ùO0–û‡¨†OOOOO–û‡¨†‡¨†Oooo·µí·µí·µí·µí·µí·µí·µí·µí·µíüëå üëåüëå üëå üíØ üëå üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëåüëåGood shit

**fifthchevron** (10): The first Halsey song I liked, I remember randomly finding in on Youtube about a year before this album dropped. I love the rhyme scheme and the storytelling.

**mokitsu** (10): the first halsey song i listened to, so good!

**mustangs16** (10): had we been rating the remix, this would have gotten my 11. LOVE IT

**PossumAloysuis** (10): Go UM!

**twat\_brained** (9.2): Again, the production is solid and I don't know if this is or isn't a strength but it's hard to tell whether this is a Room 93 or Badlands track. Also, the video confused the hell out of me when I first saw it and didn't see Halsey, but if it taught me anything it's that men really ain't shit lol.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (9): some of my favorite lyrical content on the album tbh

**Elitefourbrad** (9): This chorus is everything and it‚Äôs currently the closer for the HPK tour. A great choice btw. It‚Äôs just about how all the messiness is all over the place, like a hurricane, great song!

**MashLuke** (9): I love this

**SkyBlade79** (9): great chorus!

**strawberryswing1** (9): lyrics a little cringey but I love the mood of this song

**Mrachnie** (8.5): In this song Halsey keeps trying to push her "badass" image. Shockingly, it actually works this time.

**VeganSquash** (8.5): this is like a Lana song but not slow and actually interesting

**blue\_charles** (8): Not a favorite, but Halsey's haunting vocals combined with that downtrodden productions will almost always work for me.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Hurricane is a Flying-type move introduced in Generation V. Hurricane does damage and has a 30% chance to confuse the target. During heavy rain, Hurricane will never miss, but in clear skies, its accuracy is reduced to 50%. In a Double Battle and in a Triple Battle, Hurricane can target any Pok√©mon around the user.

**theNealCutter** (8): one of the (few) better songs on the album. Lyrically basically glorifying pedophiles. But the atmosphere is good I guess. I dunno, I like the chorus.

**tooshorttoofast** (8): queen of one night stands

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): Irma

**mirandacrocsgrove** (7.5): I‚Äôll never not complain about how spontaneous this song‚Äôs intro is which makes it sound very out of place in the tracklist whether on this album or in Halsey‚Äôs Room 69 EP.

**letsallpoo** (7): bridgit outsold

**nooodisaster** (7): I like the part where she goes "I'm your hurrricccaaaannne....." all spooky like.

**omni\_nomni** (7): this was the first song i heard from halsey. as time has gone on i've fallen very out of love with it but it's still good.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): The beat is pretty intriguing, but the song fails to keep me captivated throughout.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.7): I can imagine this playing while racing through the desert. This makes me think Badlands would've worked better as a visual album, not necessarily because the songs are great (they're okay so far), but because the videos would've enhanced the songs and also enforced the concept-album type idea she was going for.

**shineflyer** (6.5): as in love as I am with Halsey's usual instrumentation, there's not too much else that's unique here.

**enecks** (6): Like a hurricane in the middle of Bad Dragon's storage here's a lot of good components here not being used as intended, and some of them are harmed by the chaos of the production.

**lunasaflowers** (6): Is it just me, or does this song sound too loud to anyone else? Also, Halsey's vocals throughout this song sound weird, especially on the pre-chorus. I feel like I should like this more than I do.

**timothy444** (6): So confused right now? Is this a continuation of Drive or is she just that lazy in making new music? Probably explains why Closer and All We Know are all so similar :meghan

**andreszmtz** (5.4): Bridgit Mendler did it better

**dirdbub** (5): this song has such interesting lyrical work in comparison to the rest of the album, but the production paired with the song is just not what should have been paired with. it's a huge issue with this album; the slow songs felt forced lyrically, as if she wrote an entire album of uptempo sad songs and the label was like "oh no, the album's gotta have some slow songs or else it won't sell"

**spaghettibread** (5): meh

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (5): Putting this song right after Drive was a bad choice. They‚Äôre both slow and roughly the same tempo. The instrumental is boring and washed out electropop, but the song is not actively bad.

**zamomattel** (4.5): This isn't bad but countless people could write and record this song, it doesn't feel very special

**awryj** (4): Lana does it better than Halsey

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I think there was a reason that this was left off of the standard edition of the album.

**MrSwearword** (3): I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fine but I got bored by her vocals being drowned out and the chorus feeling deflated from the jump.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): I literally hate every single word spoken in this song. Every single one. And the chorus is so laughably faux-dark and deep it hurts me. I was getting scared I was gonna like this album and then this shit came on, thank god.

I love this song but you guys highikey ruined this for me by making me realize how similar it is to Bad Day

---
**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): deserved single status tbh

**lunasaflowers** (9.5): Alex Hope absolutely kills it as a guest vocalist on this track. (Also is it bad that I think the way Troye and Alex sing the chorus sounds a bit like Bad Day by Daniel Powter?)

**nooodisaster** (9.5): This song is soooooooo sad, Jesus fucking Christ. "Only seeing myself when I'm looking up at you" hits like a fucking ton of bricks.

**cyborglilith** (9): good sleep music

**enecks** (9): DAB

**fifthchevron** (9): The best feature vocalist and the only one that really matches Troye's tone.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Adorable

**MrSwearword** (9): at least this collaboration does something for both performers involved.

**PossumAloysuis** (9): Good piano ballad to end the album on.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): A piano ballad done SO RIGHT! And Alex's vocals complement Troye's so beautifully, and it works excellently.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (8.5): tHe cHorus is literally ‚Äúyou Had a bad day, you‚Äôre taking one down‚Äù

**dirdbub** (8): http://25.media.tumblr.com/ae3d490b1ffc2241d08ab4024d0a7d4e/tumblr_mxw6maaBeB1s1pw5so5_1280.png

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8): The melody in the chorus sounds a bit like a nursery rhyme, but the lyrics are really good and I like the production.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I have nothing to say about this one.

**SkyBlade79** (8): That female singer totally overpowers Troye. She‚Äôs great.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Very nice outro.

**tooshorttoofast** (8): excellent closer for the album

**banananaise** (7.5): it took me a while but i've gotten into the country-ish rhythm of the 'I want you / to colour me blue' chorus

**Dracyoshi** (7.5): It reminds me of Bad Day.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (7.5): A nice duet! Not one of my favorites but definitely a solid track.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): Marina did Blue better tbh

**blue\_charles** (7): It's cute I guess Idk.

**MashLuke** (7): Neat

**theNealCutter** (7): eh. kinda generic imho. enjoyable, but I wouldn't listen to it intentionally.

**shineflyer** (6.5): no offense, but Alex Hope's voice is SO much better than Troye's.

**zamomattel** (6.5): can any UK people remember on CBB when that guy from Blue two timed those two girls out of his league. Whatever happened to Blue like they worked with Stevie & Elton they were a big deal. Oh yeah they were on Eurovision and came like 11th, dads

**gannade** (6): ... is this a sample? lmao. Also Halsey outsold the color metaphor with Colors.

**Mrachnie** (6): It's very repetitive. BUT it's a piano ballad and the *noname Troye collaborated with ‚Ññ1234566) sounds good.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Unfortunately, a pretty uneventful closer. I don‚Äôt have a problem with these slower tracks, but Troye‚Äôs lyrics aren‚Äôt enough to hold them afloat, and the unfeeling piano doesn‚Äôt really do much for me either.

**Elitefourbrad** (5): Halsey sang about blue better on this rate.

**spaghettibread** (5): another forgettable and boring

**mokitsu** (4.5): alex hope serving what this album needs: a VOCAL RANGE. thank YOU!

**awryj** (3.5): YO LISTEN UP HERES A STORY ABOUT A LITTLE TROYE THAT LIVES IN A BLUE WORLD AND AAALL DAY AND AAALL NIGHT AND EVERYTHING HE SEES IS JUST BLUE LIKE HIM IN-SIIIDE AND OUT-SIIIDE BLUE HIS HOUSE WITH A BLUE LITTLE WINDOW AND A BLUE CORVETTE AND EVERYTHING IS BLUE FOR HIM AND HIMSELF AND EVERYBODY AROUND CUZ HE AINT GOT NOBODY TO LISTEEEN

**patronsaintofaspies** (1): Oh...no, is that...the melody from....Bad Day! Oh no, oh no, oh no...why Troye, why? This is going to end up lowering down my average for this album so much, but I truly hate this melody. At least both Beyonce and Troye could claim to end otherwise iconic albums with a meh song named Blue?

**VeganSquash** (1): THIS IS THE MOST PRETENTIOUS BULLSHIT SONG BEHIND COMING DOWN. AT LEAST NEW AMERICANA IS CATCHY.

This is one heck of a debut song. It‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs emotive and varied and it feels like a sugar high and cotton candy

---

**twat\_brained** (11): Ever since I first heard this song, I fell in love with Halsey; her artistry, her image, her vision, and it only escalated when I saw the music video.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): Most halsey songs have at least one of the following: interesting lyrics, a unique vocal performance, good production. This has none.

---

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): anecdote time!! this was one of the first halsey songs i heard, and definitely the first i learned on guitar/started covering. i saw her play it live at Madison Square Garden and before she played it she told this story about how she saw ed sheeran at MSG and she looked and said "i'll do that one day". and that day she did. but i was there and i was looking at HER and saying that i'll do that one day. it was really special. i started crying during that song and i'm not even sure why, it was just really beautiful.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): coming for Alessia's relatable title.

**theNealCutter** (10): don't make me hate it.

**spaghettibread** (9.9): near perfection needs to be longer

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): The chorus is so understated and so good. And she can spit.

**blueheart** (9): This song has the kind of fast singing I liked in Alessia's songs which makes me love the verses. The chorus could be stronger, though.

**PossumAloysuis** (9): Who ya gonna call?

**SkyBlade79** (9): the pre-chorus is so good and the production is super satisfying. My wig is ghost

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This was my favorite Halsey song until HFK, when Alone easily took that spot. Ghost is a really solid pop song which takes her moody style and contrasts it with some really nice bells (?) or whatever the instruments are in the chorus. It‚Äôs a really soft track and it‚Äôs a highlight on this lopsided album.

**cyborglilith** (8): Too short.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8): I can totally see why this was the song that put her on the map. I actually wish the album had more stuff like this, especially after having so many mid-tempo tracks. The guitars in the pre-chorus are the best thing I've heard on the album so far.

**MashLuke** (8): Many people seem to hate this but it's relaxing and I don't mind it

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): The production in this one kinda reminds me of Ready For It, but I like it more. Also, she actually keeps it short in this one, and the song ends before it gets annoying and repetitive. Nice.

**tooshorttoofast** (8): if halsey's a ghost, then I can be a phantom

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): it's sp00ky month my dudes

**Elitefourbrad** (7): A cute little bop about how she likes being ghosted and loves it secretly. PRISM is shaking.

**enecks** (7): Why was 6 scared of 7? Because I only gave this song a 7. hahaha I put my initial 6 score out of a job

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Something feels weird about this track. We've been exposed to songs heavily reliant on production so far on Badlands (not that that's a bad thing) but Ghost could easily be sung without any additional sonics effects or instruments. The diversion made me dislike this track a little at first, but maybe it's grown on me a bit.

**shineflyer** (7): when the beat drops I drop everything and give Halsey my damn attention

**Mrachnie** (6.2): The verses hype up for a great chorus, and then it just never happens. The lyrics are good and not THAT try-hard.

**lunasaflowers** (6): I really don't like the weird buzzing on the chorus...I like the lyrics, though.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (6): Kinda catchy, but not much really grabs my attention. The verses are somewhat distinct, but in a ‚Äúgirl what is u doing‚Äù way.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Just one? Hm.

**VeganSquash** (5): this is a meh song, kinda like Vroom Vroom. Parts I love, others I dont

**dirdbub** (4): this song is weird. it's placed at #7 in the deluxe, but placed at the end of the standard average. either way that doesn't matter; it's boring, with weird vocal vibe shifts that don't exactly work and some slightly off-sounding delivery on her part

**letsallpoo** (4): katy outsold

**mokitsu** (4): this song feels too disjointed and underwhelming, i can't enjoy it even though its a fan favorite

**awryj** (3): This song feels very unpolished

**Kaylaboe** (3): i adore the chorus in this, but i can't get over how horrid the verses are

**MrSwearword** (2): personally, it feels so uneven and creepy.

**zamomattel** (2): This is so damn ploddy and dull I'm so sick of her by this point and this particular type of song

Heck yeah now this is how you protest against the bourgeoisie. Never once in my life have I been oppressed  by men in a three piece suit but that doesn‚Äôt stop me from raging every time this song comes on.

---
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): a serious contender for my 11. dude. i remember when this came out as a promo single and i thought it was the most badass shit. i listened to it at least 30 times that day, its the definition of an angry bop.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): I have no idea why Castle had to be on the album. Hold Me Down would have been the perfect album opener. It's sooo right.

**MashLuke** (10): I love this song because she talks about her mental health and the drop makes it sound like she's having a mental breakdown. I love that the instrumental matches the way she feels.

**twat\_brained** (10): Holy fuck you guys have no idea how nostalgic I am for when this would come onto shuffle on the bus or subway and I'd tightly grip my Jones bottle in delightful angst upon hearing these lyrics. Good times, bro. Good fuckin times.

**cyborglilith** (9): /u/Nfranklin50

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I like how the sound effects in this song sound like someone being hit.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Honestly, a huge bop. That sample works so well.

**mokitsu** (8.5): sampling son lux is one of her edgiest moves, this is good but could've been better

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): A major advantage this has against Halsey's other tracks in this rate is that it's so damn catchy. The chorus is such an earworm to the point where you forget about any lyrical flaws in it. It also feels more 'young adult' than a lot of other songs on Badlands. You'd be lying if you'd claim that this wouldn't work well on the soundtrack of a movie like the Hunger Games or Divergent. Hold ,e down, hold me down...

**lunasaflowers** (8.3): I like the flow of Halsey's singing on this song a lot! I've always loved themes of inner demons in my music TBH, so this works for me.

**Damoojo** (8): The lyrics to this are interesting......

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Halsey basically talking about our her inner demons are holding her down from achieving the greater things in life. I really love the production on this song, my wig is gone.

**MrSwearword** (8): if the chorus didn‚Äôt sound deflated, it‚Äôd get full marks.

**PossumAloysuis** (8): When a real man hold you down, you supposed to drown - Our Lord and Savior Yeezus

**tooshorttoofast** (8): verses are really good but I wish the chorus went off a little more

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): Songwriting is a little odd on this one, but it's still dope

**shineflyer** (7.5): Halsey's so melodramatic, Lorde who? I'm here for it though

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): The hook is soooo fucking good, but I don't care much about the rest of the song.

**SkyBlade79** (7): that pre- chorus is so damn good but the rest isn‚Äôt quite as great

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (7): One of the few times that Halsey‚Äôs oversinging works! The instrumental is also pretty punchy, which compliments her voice. Pretty good!

**awryj** (6.5): [theory] is helsey a iluminati

**nooodisaster** (6.5): I feel like I'm gonna kinkshame Halsey by the end of this album.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6): Two songs in and I'm noticing her melodies don't use much range and depend more on the attitude of her delivery. I'm gonna be real...lyrics are not her strong suit.

**spaghettibread** (6): alright but pretty creepy

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Like the little cool background moments in the instrumental, but her lyrics are once again just really annoying. The chorus just feels like the most generic thing possible, and ‚ÄúI sold my soul to a three-piece, and he told me I was holy‚Äù is pretty damn infuriating.

**theNealCutter** (6): okay she samples one of my favorite Son Lux songs of all time, Easy. Too bad, Lorde already had her own version of Easy, and guess what? and it's way darker and scarier. This is just a bland. Talking about her haters and critics (again). That doesn't make your music any better. She's just hiding in a "unique" aesthetic that just sounds unique to teenagers who haven't heard a lot of music.

**dirdbub** (5): I find the lyrical references between songs ("Throw me in the deep end, watch me drown", Hold Me Down // "And I've been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool / For a while now, drowning my thoughts out with the sounds", Young God) interesting, but my god I just wish the lyrics were better and the song didn't sound so god-awfully boring

**Mrachnie** (5): The sample is good (Lorde did it better tho). As with a lot of songs here the lyrics are just her throwing loud and edgy buzzwords around without any real meaning.

**Raykel** (4): I can't believe she made a Son Lux sample so drab. What a talent.

**VeganSquash** (3): hold me DAWhunn, knock me OWwww

Another glimpse at peak Halsey edge and another glimpse into her mental state. This song is so sinister and drippy and it‚Äôs such an experience and adventure into her mind. Does she go over the top with the edginess? Maybe. But honestly it‚Äôs never bothered me and doesn‚Äôt seem impersonal

---
**Dracyoshi** (11): Calling it now, some people are going to disregard Control because "omg dark and edgy halsey ew". The production is fantastic and it supports the lyrics about her bipolar disorder so well; I love the dark, sparkly synths during the second verse, the creepy synths and whispering voices representing her demons in the bridge and the powerful chorus. There's so much emotion packed into this.

**dropthehammer11** (11): This is one of the best pop songs of the decade. The incredible maximalist beat, Halsey's vocal performance, her gripping lyrics...all combine for such a haunting atmosphere. What a fucking track

**lunasaflowers** (11): I. Fucking. Love. This. Song. Badlands's greatest strength is its dark, brooding, echoing intensity, when it's conjuring up the image of being in a desert wasteland or a sinister, shimmering lake or a dusty, haunted room or maybe the darkest place of your own mind with something you can't see-- the Devil, maybe, or your own demons, just as wicked. This song builds up in intensity and paints a superb picture of someone struggling with the most hideous, wicked parts of themself...and yet, there's something ADDICTING about it, too, wielding your own icy rage as a weapon to keep away others who may hurt you...and, regrettably, even those who'd never bring you harm. It's edgy, yeah, and very tumblr, but goddamn if I don't think it's an amazing song.

**mustangs16** (11): this is my angry, fuck the world, i might be down today but i'm still going to do great things song and i love, love, love it

**dirdbub** (0): I literally sat at my computer, staring at the screen, doing this for a solid six minutes because I couldn't fucking decide if I should give this a 0 for being absolutely intolerable lyrically or a 3 for at least having a decent instrumental. but no. I relistened to it, and what the fuck. this is just beyond me, I'm.. like, she's trying to talk about her bipolar disorder which is great but holy fuck, how much more contrived can this song's aura get? I'm just.. I'm at a loss for words on this song

**Mrachnie** (0): Oh my god this is so unintentionally funny. She sounds like someone who owns a "normal people scare me" tshirt in this song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (0): I always come across songs that sound cinematic and/or theatrical, but don't quite get there. Look What You Made Me Do is an example of one, and so is New Americana. Control follows suit. The way she sings the chorus is supposed to sound cool and intimidating, which works sometimes, but most of the time it sounds like she's singing a shitty Halloween commercial. Some people are obviously going to like this track for the reasons I mentioned, and while I can see why, I'm not quite convinced. Heck, having lyrics like 'I can't help this awful energy/damn right' you should be scared of me' is...actually terrible. Fuck it, this is a 0. Sorry not sorry.

---

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): undoubtably the most passionate song on the album. there's anger, resentment, remorse, and power. when i saw this live i really felt it push through the entire audience, it was really cool. the production is insane, but not shocking because lido is a genius.

**blueheart** (10): This is, no doubt, the song that grew on me the most. The melodramatic production, like the violins in the chorus, the atmosphere, they all paint this picture which I feel totally redeems the "edgy" lyrics.

**bluehxrizon** (10): truly a spooky song

**MashLuke** (10): This sounds like something Pennywise would sing if it was a singer. A hit.

**mokitsu** (10): sooo intense. a great depiction of mental illness/bipolar disorder. she did that

**MrSwearword** (10): now this is when creepy as fuck can work so well.

**shineflyer** (10): this is so dramatic and I fucking adore it. It feels emotionally out of control and very horror-themed.

**SkyBlade79** (10): GOD DAMN RIGHT, YOU SHOULD BE SCARED OF ME! THAT OUTRO OMG, THAT GOT SO POWERFUL

**twat\_brained** (10): I know I talk about the dark production a lot here, but this is literally the first song that comes to mind when I think of "dark songs"; it's equally the right parts creepy and intriguing, giving listeners plenty to be frightened about.

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): sza who

**Raykel** (9.5): It's edgy as all hell but goddammit it sounds great.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): Kill Bill vibes. I feel really bad about Halsey's bipolar disorder and hate the fact how quickly people will joke about that just because she called herself tri-bi like 2 times. How people deal with Halsey, especially on popheads, is kinda shitty. I don't say she should be protected like a precious egg, but joking about her disorder is awful.

**cyborglilith** (9): slay quen

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Janet Jackson found with a full head of hair, her hair actually got stronger after this song was released. Jk, I actually quite like this one? Objectively it falls into that sort of ‚Äútrying too hard to be edgy‚Äù trap that Halsey is so often accused of being in, but something about this track is kind of different. It‚Äôs a fairly tight track and the overwhelming instrumental actually paints an effective scene for the story, I love how it cuts out at the end to leave her peeping out that little ‚Äúoh.‚Äù

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): I like the epic beat. Her vocals sound pretty good too. Surely a highlight in the album.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8.5): Lowkey Melanie vibes anyone?

**agentofscranton** (8): until those last 30 seconds this is a pretty dull song honestly

**Elitefourbrad** (8): What the hell? These vocals, SLAY ME WOMAN!

**letsallpoo** (8): janet outsold

**PossumAloysuis** (8): Control is just an illusion

**awryj** (7.5): Even though the subject matter is the same as in Gasoline, I think that this song describes her mental illness better than the previous song. It's pretty heartbreaking.

**nooodisaster** (7): she's so angsty, man. The chorus is awesome tho.

**VeganSquash** (7): wtf are the lyrics about?

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (7): Basically a better version of Gasoline lol.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (6.7): sounds like an unpolished demo. One of my online friends sang this for me and honestly she did better. Also, V√âRIT√â did it best.

**timothy444** (5.5): Halsey tries way too hard and it comes off and being way too edgy!

**zamomattel** (5.5): Janet Jackson sweetie I'm so sorry

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I can‚Äôt find anything to say about this song that wasn‚Äôt said about other tracks here. Everything is middling and melding into a single song, help.

**theNealCutter** (5): eh.

**tooshorttoofast** (5): the lyrics in this song are so fucking extra like chill out girl

**frankiefrankiefrank** (4.3): This sounds like something that'd be in a Halloween-themed episode of a CW teen drama.

**spaghettibread** (4): also scary

The production and vocal layering on this track is insanely good. I love how this song feels like something out of a fairy tale movie like Hoodwinked or something

---
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): loooveee this song. so atmospheric

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): G-A-Y seriously this is the most innocent-sexy song I've ever heard and I'm not sure if that category exists. If you don't like BITE your gay card is R E V O K E D

**blue\_charles** (10): if I ever make a sex playlist, it's literally just going to be this song on loop and like GUY once maybe.

**blueheart** (10): I have two things I wanna say about this song. First, it was my first introduction to "alternative pop"; it was weird, it was unlike anything I'd heard, and it was enchanting. Second, this song avtually exemplifies how much easier it is for gay teens to relate to Troye than it is to a straight musician. Troye puts himself in a passive role. He is the one crushing on someone, he is hesitant; he is a bit scared. Because he's a bottom.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I adore this track, it‚Äôs definitely a grower. It‚Äôs probably the most sexual track on the album and it takes a very dark approach to the subject. That cold, twisted production is downright chilling and contrasts nicely with Troye‚Äôs innocent (but seductive) vocals. There‚Äôs a trepidation to this track that I like, highlighting the duality of being attracted to men. Yes there‚Äôs pleasure and excitement in it, but it opens you up to a lot of danger. To love a dude you put yourself at risk of both physical and emotional harm, there‚Äôs a lot of subtext wrapped up in the line ‚Äúkiss me on the mouth and set me free, but please don‚Äôt bite.‚Äù Yet at the same time, something about Troye‚Äôs laid back vocals is almost‚Ä¶ sinister. After all, he is a man too.

**MashLuke** (10): He's not really a singer I love but this song is really good. I can't relate to this at all because I've never been to a gay club but like, its vibe and everything is slightly terrifying and sensual in a way. It's pretty cool

**SkyBlade79** (10): this production is amazing, sounds like Banks mixed with Billie Eilish

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (8.5): I like how the song opens very quietly and then gives way to a subtle but potent drop. The whole song has a sultry and cool vibe that Troye pulls off very well. Those kissing noises during the bridge stick out like a sore thumb tho.

**zamomattel** (8.5): I love this damn hook

**ImADudeDuh** (8): This sounds like what happens if you mix halsey production and Troye.

**lunasaflowers** (8): I like how there's something both gentle and eerie about the production on this song.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Gets a little repetitive towards the end, and I'm not fully sold on the clapping thing near the end, but it's still an enjoyable song.

**twat\_brained** (7.9): Evident filler but pretty decent and listenable otherwise.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.8): The layered vocals along with the a cappella opening into the beat drop leave me shook each time. It is a bit repetitive though.

**dirdbub** (7.5): the distorted kicks on this song are killer

**nooodisaster** (7.5): I kinda hate the lyrics, and yet it bops..... thinking. (the breakdown is undeniably great tho)

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): This falls into the category of 'It's nice on the album, but I would seldom listen to it by myself'. It goes a little too slow for me and without the album's atmosphere it gets a lot more boring.

**PossumAloysuis** (7.5): Just okay. Nothing memorable

**shineflyer** (7.5): it felt generic at first listen, but the electronic harmonies are pretty cool, and the song has a certain bounce to it.

**awryj** (7.2): Imogen Heap is shook

**chipsi1** (7): this is very chill. i like it.

**enecks** (7): starting after this I am posting youtube comments only

**MrSwearword** (7): the idea is there in the verses but the hook is delivered so half-hearted.

**OxfordSemicolon** (7): I didn't like this until I heard the context from the Interwebs - the lyrics don't make much sense without it.

**theNealCutter** (7): i never really got the appeal of this one. I dunno, it's a nice song about the dangers of hookups and the willingness to face it, but sonically, it's not interesting enougn.

**tooshorttoofast** (7): first half is kinda slow but it picks up later on; lyrics are neat tho

**mokitsu** (6.5): i dont hate this - it has nice production, but it needs something else vocally and lyrically.

**Mrachnie** (6): Lol apparently he described this song as "raunchy" well too bad it's anything BUT raunchy, Troye. At least it's not boring like the last one. Also, Frank Ocean did the first verse of this song better.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Probably one of my least favorite tracks on the record, it kinda just meanders with a pretty decent beat, but it‚Äôs too spacey for its own good, and when Troye is singing, it‚Äôs not much special. It feels so long at 3 minutes and doesn‚Äôt really have anything for you to latch onto.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): Maybe Troye doing dubstep is not my thing

**fifthchevron** (5): Interesting production and vocal choices, but doesn't hold my attention.

**VeganSquash** (5): BORING TBH

**timothy444** (4): Yeah we get it, you want someone to kiss you on the mouth!

**Elitefourbrad** (3): Wait what we‚Äôre in a new song? I thought this was the bridge to WILD, oh wait all these songs sound exactly the same.

**spaghettibread** (3): um

**cyborglilith** (2): should have been an interlude

This was one of the first Halsey song I ever found and it instantly had me hooked. My emo self was so enthralled with this like dark sorcerer vibe it had going and I felt like such a BA walking down the halls to this. Man high school was fun

---

**amumumyspiritanimal** (0): hot mess. I just really dislike this version, especially considering that the Huntsman version is my favorite non-HFK Halsey song. It's just a bad album opener and a bad song overall.

---
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): what a good album opener. im not gonna lie, i totally overplayed this, but i can still get down to it sometimes. it's really saying that shes here and shes mf ready. also the lido four notes at the beginning <3

**blue\_charles** (10): ngl, this makes me feel like a total don't fuck with me kinda bitch every time I listen to it.

**cyborglilith** (10): This is a good album opener!!!

**MashLuke** (10): Listen, Lido fucking killed this production. She sounds like a barbed wire queen and I love it

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): Such a great can opener from Ms. Frangipane. I don‚Äôt understand the criticism where some people say that the production in this track is a mess and that the remix was better. It really isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve never heard her prior EP or any of her other songs so this was the first Halsey song I ever heard and I think the production is phenomenal and that the remix is actually superfluous. This song is a 10 so suck it up fat bitches.

**mokitsu** (10): i love that the production has some medieval vibes to it - the choir, the swords, the strings. (side note: the huntsman version is an 11)

**omni\_nomni** (10): love this so damn much oh my god

**twat\_brained** (10): Everything about this song is a perfect introduction to "Badlands". The creaky gate, the dark production, Halsey's delivery‚Ä¶ I am in love.

**SkyBlade79** (9.5): this song has such a large scale and is so epic! It‚Äôs the perfect soundtrack to any action sequence.

**dropthehammer11** (9): What an opener. Sets the atmosphere very well

**PossumAloysuis** (9): Very moody intro. Sets the tone well

**spaghettibread** (9): pretty litty

**gannade** (8.5): This beat is FIRE but then the rest of the song doesn't really go anywhere. It tries to be epic and grandiose with that beat and the chanting choir, but then the melody just dies. Like most of Halsey's music, it's ambitious but flawed just a little much.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I actually really like this song, it‚Äôs a cool opener for the album. My cripe with it is that it kind of loses its direction towards the middle, it could have been much shorter, but on the whole it‚Äôs really cool.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): This is still a great song, it‚Äôs not a 10 because the single version is much better. But Halsey being the queen of a castle sounds like fun, I‚Äôd worship her and her blue wig.

**enecks** (8): This builds up atmosphere incredibly. The chorus kinda kills it a little but the start is good.

**lunasaflowers** (8): I like the dark, echoing intensity of this song. It definitely brings to mind the kind of deserted wasteland Halsey wants us to picture for me.

**strawberryswing1** (8): omg help I'm liking this I was hoping to trash her a little

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): It goes for a whole minute longer than it needs to, but the beat slaps.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): great gritty opener

**ImADudeDuh** (7): If you listen to this song at like 1.25 speed it gets ten times better.

**Mrachnie** (7): The production on this track, as with a lot of songs on Badlands, is excellent. The lyrics sound like they're trying way too hard (well, it's a Halsey album afterall) but it's nice to actually hear a nicely written chorus after Know-It-All.

**nooodisaster** (7): I actually like the lyrics and basic sound of this sound, but it goes on too long.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Castle is the perfect opening song to Badlands. To be good opening songs, opening songs have to sum up the themes of their respective albums as a whole, and Castle is just like that; it sounds cool and manages to capture a listener's interest, but on the other hand, it also sounds kinda pretentious and intermediate. It's also one of the only songs on the album to completely fall in line with Halsey's concept of a dystopian wasteland, which is good for lyrical consistency.

**shineflyer** (7): the best opening track in the rate

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.2): It's a solid opener. Not something I'd put on repeat, but it has me intrigued as to what's going to happen next. The church choir vocals are...interesting?

**banananaise** (6): this is very Look What You Made Me Do

**dirdbub** (6): the "Agnus dei" part of the song is so horribly placed, disjointed, and forced into the song that it knocked down my rating by 2 points

**tooshorttoofast** (6): that weird choir thingy before the chorus threw me off so hard; song is ok tho

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (6): Decent opening track. That choir in the pre-chorus is neat.

**MrSwearword** (5): ah, the soundtrack song but this just does nothing outside of opens the album on a mediocre note.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): This sounds like it was solely derived for a Once Upon A Time commercial. The chorus is catchy but the lyrics are really not good, and hearing her try to menacingly say ‚Äúmean‚Äù is super funny.

**theNealCutter** (5): She talks about being "The queen" being targeted with all of the criticisms, she's so hurt and she's gonna hurt us... like sure janet. Halsey's stripped of emotion, all she can do is be inappropriately angry or be inappropriately bored. This one's the latter.

**VeganSquash** (5): way too repetitive tbh, there needed to be a third verse or new bridge.

**zamomattel** (4.5): On the Hill

**awryj** (4): Fun fact: over 50% of this song is the chorus being repeated over and over

Man this song is just amazing it every way. Honestly this might be my favorite produced song ever. The Car noises, the talking in the background, the backing vocals from lido. This song is exactly what I imagine driving down an empty road in Arizona around dusk would be like and I want to experience that so bad and this song just takes me there.

Then the real question appeared: which song deserves it more: Strange Love or Drive? On one hand, Strange Love is a bop. On the other hand. Drive actually has meaning. So, like a true pophead, I chose the song that I could slut drop to Jk it wasn't that hard to decide that Drive is a masterpiece. <3

**mokitsu** (11): this song is stunning: the production is atmospheric and moody and the car noises are such a nice addition. again, i love the lyrics, they're super relatable to me

---

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): woooo we got our first ballad of the album. really beautiful. i love this track

**blue\_charles** (10): I love so many aspects of this song, but it's detailed ambiance that it builds around the song that really pushes it to be great

**blueheart** (10): A masterpiece of production. The car in the background is so immersive. It's so relaxing to listen to, plus her pronunciation is awesome and the background vocals really add something.

**MashLuke** (10): This is one of the best songs she has written. The references about roads, places like California and the whole metaphor about driving make this song pretty and eventful. Really, this track has no flaws.

**shineflyer** (10): there's so much I love here: the vocal runs in the verses, the filtered guitar before the second chorus, how the synth hook works with the chord progression, the car sounds weaved into the beginning... I'm just living, idk what else to say here.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): This is, by far, Halsey's best song, as far as I'm concerned. Perfect for a Late Afternoon Drive TM

**twat\_brained** (9.8): The synesthetic in me listens to this song makes me think of late-night drives (imaginative, I know) along a damp road while driving along neon-lit streets and smoking a pack of Marlboros with someone cute in the passenger seat slouched in their seat, their bomber jacket half-off around their shoulders, staring at their reflection in the window/the pretty lights in the shops we pass. I spend way too much time on Tumblr.

**SkyBlade79** (9.5): it‚Äôs so chill, and I love the male accompaniment that comes in. The bass is also amazing.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): again. a VERY strong song coming after fucking New Americana... I really recommend people to listen to Drive after Hold Me Down, the transition between the two songs is amazing. If only some songs would've been left out, I would've stanned Halsey after this album.

**lunasaflowers** (9): I lowkey really love this song oops. I can imagine myself biting my lip and quietly staring out the window into the night, words unsaid...

**mirandacrocsgrove** (9): the male backing vocals is a nice addition and lifted the score by 2 points for this tbh

**mustangs16** (9): the first time this song came on while i was driving, i nearly had a heart attack thinking it was my car making those sounds lol yikes

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Something about the way Halsey says 'And California never felt like home to me' kind of gives me goosebumps. This definitely has a warmth that the songs before it either lacked or tried to hide.

**PossumAloysuis** (9): Where's Ryan Gosling when you need him?

**dropthehammer11** (8): This beat omg. I forgot how great this album's production is

**enecks** (8): For the start this seems like an atmosphere without a song. Yet, it kicks in and it slowly becomes all-enveloping in a way few songs can be.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I listened to this for the first time in my car and I freaked out because I thought something was up with my car. What‚Äôs the unnecessarily long outro supposed to be?

**tooshorttoofast** (8): very chill although she pronounces her 'ah's weird‚Ä¶

**VeganSquash** (8): this is my sister's favorite song (I know nobody cares)

**awryj** (7.7): It's good, but Carly did it better

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7.5): this song made me sentimental about a place I've never been to & something I've never done

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): i love the harmonies at the end

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.1): I really like the production on this song; her voice works with more cinematic stuff, where she's part of sonic landscape as opposed to the main attraction.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): lyrics are ok but the production is amazing

**Mrachnie** (7): Halsey sounds better with acoustic guitars than Alessia Cara does. The song's lyrics are LACKINGGGG tho.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I actually don‚Äôt hate this at all. The chorus is a little stilted but I like the instrumental a lot and while the lyrics are grating as usual, they do little to detract from the nice, dark atmosphere provided here.

**theNealCutter** (7): Oh Wonder did it better with All We Do. Sonically sounds good, but the lyrics ruin it so much. It's like you got a seventh grader to write lyrics for her. AND WHAT THE FUCK DOES CALIFORNIA HAS TO DO ANYTHING WITH WHAT YOU'RE SINGING ABOUT? I THOUGHT YOU WERE SINGING ABOUT HOW "WE DON'T TELL EACH OTHER HOW FEEL ANYMORE"? FOR FUCK'S SAKE, STAY ON TOPIC.

**nooodisaster** (6.5): It's pretty slow and meh. I kinda like the duet thing at the end

**zamomattel** (6.5): As much as I enjoy this song, I do not drive so Halsey is being somewhat of an unrelatable queen. Plus I don't know I just struggle to believe that she didn't feel like a Californian before she had a whip in her car.

**spaghettibread** (6): not very catchy but not bad

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (6): Those dings at the beginning always mess me up when I listen to this song in the car lol. Some cool stuff going on in the instrumental, but the song is a bit slow and sludgey.

**Raykel** (5.5): Why didn't she use more of that weird trap-like whistle? That would've kept my attention.

**letsallpoo** (5): carly outsold

**dirdbub** (4.5): I'm sure this is trying to tell a story, but it doesn't exactly keep my focus at all during the song so the story is kind of lost on me. I do like the harmonizing at the end, as boring and phoned in as it sounds. it's a nice curve ball in a fairly boring song

**MrSwearword** (3): the idea is there but the beatwork is shoddy, the song loses momentum almost instantaneously‚Ä¶it‚Äôs bad.

**Elitefourbrad** (2): California is great kids! I suggest driving there, maybe not listening to this song though, it kind of blows.

This was the first Halsey song I ever heard and honestly I‚Äôm glad I got right to peak edginess. This is another gorgeously produced song and the Asian like strings are just such a great addition to the song and I want to personally thank the person who added them. As for the lyrics this is Halsey at her most edgy. This was one of my favorite songs when I thought I was a special snowflake and I could relate and be an edge lord but that was when I didn‚Äôt really understand mental illnesses. Now that I understand I realize just how amazing this song is and how well she does speaks on her own illness and it just makes an amazing song

---
**omni\_nomni** (11): the song i latched onto most when i first listened to badlands and i still absolutely adore it

---

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): eight of these points came from the "do you call yourself a fucking hurricane like me" line

**blueheart** (10): This is so emotional and personal. Plus, Halsey has this great kind of little touches in production, which is really evident in the callback to Hurricane.

**cyborglilith** (10): You have to turn the volume up dangerously high in the beginning to hear anything. Halsey can't get good producers. :( SAD!

**dropthehammer11** (10): Holy fucking shit

**Elitefourbrad** (10): You just have to keep running on Gasoline, which in my case is coffee. I can relate to this song so much.

**enecks** (10): Relatable

**Kaylaboe** (10): queen of petroleum

**MashLuke** (10): This is fucking good. Facts

**mokitsu** (10): so intense. an experience, i love it!

**SkyBlade79** (10): The sparse but interesting production, relatable lyrics, and powerful inflection make this one of my favorite Halsey songs. Every line is very quotable.

**twat\_brained** (10): http://bit.ly/2xGMjeU I am in love with the Hurricane shout-out on this.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): ...and the album comes back to life. Too late?

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): Again, shows how Lido can do great work with production. Also the songs makes me feel bad about Halsey. People like us are quick to hold singers to a high standard and inspect them with magnifying glasses, expecting them to be perfect while every single one of us can make mistakes just like them. We are quick to tell people they are over, like with Taylor, even though we do shit like them daily. I

**Mrachnie** (9): Ok i know this makes me look like a hypocrite because this is proably the edgiest song on the album but i can't help how much i love this. Sure, the lyrics are very try-hard but the instrumental is the best one on the album and she just sounds... cool? on it.

**PossumAloysuis** (9): Daddy Yankee wishes he could

**blue\_charles** (8): I still haven't decided if I hate or live the line "low on self-esteem so you run on gasoline" yet. The production saves it from some questionable lyrical choices.

**gannade** (7.5): One of her most overrated songs. It has a nice beat but the entire machine metaphor is eye-rolling cringe that makes Halsey such a prime target for criticism, and with this song - deservedly so.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Cringy lyrics but it bops.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I'll admit that I don't get all of the hype behind this one, but when I listened closer to Gasoline's lyrics, I was able to appreciate a lot of things about it that I hadn't for. Despite the fact that the way she expresses her message could use some improvement, Halsey is right; society as a whole is quick to judge people who have issues with their mental health or other aspects of their lives, and even well-intentioned acquaintances can easily fall into the stereotyping she hints at in this song. No, I've never bought an a bottle of hundred-dollar champagne, but I can relate to this one.

**shineflyer** (7): the most #edgy song on the album. but I love that shit, man

**mirandacrocsgrove** (6.7): ‚Äúi think there‚Äôs a flaw in my code‚Äù relatable as a programmer

**chipsi1** (6): I like the instrumental a lot and I would be bumping this if it wasn't as edgy as it is.

**lunasaflowers** (6): There is WAY too much going on in the production/instrumentation of the song. Lots of distracting noises. Also, Halsey swearing always feels kind of awkward and unnecessary.

**MrSwearword** (6): it‚Äôs fine and catchy but not that much of a highlight on the album.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Every time Halsey opens up her mouth I just want to rip my headphones out. The beat is cool here, but these edgy callbacks to her other songs as well as dark metaphors and self-loathing is just shallow it feels like an YA movie adaptation.

**tooshorttoofast** (6): the electronic lay over on her voice during the chorus kinda blows

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (6): I have some mixed feelings about this song. The instrumental during the verses is really tense and cool, but the explosive chorus sounds like it should be used in commercials for superhero shows on the CW, but not in a good way. And I don‚Äôt want to invalidate Halsey‚Äôs experience with mental illness, but some of these lyrics are not good and seem melodramatic.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): I'm not feeling this one honestly :/ Something about the vocal production just isn't my thing

**awryj** (5): I'm still trying to figure out if she's trying to say that she feels sorry for behaving like a robot or that she's a special snowflake and the world is so-heartless-and-don't-you-dare-judge-me. Knowing it's Halsey it's probably the latter.

**theNealCutter** (5): ARE YOU DEPRESSED? DID YOU DO THESE THINGS? I used to be depressed, I didn't talk about it like this. She sounds like she's bragging it. Like she's proud of it... it just feels like she's taking mental diseases like something to write songs about, not seriously. Because personally, I would want to get out of that place as soon as I could because that shit's crazy horrible.

**zamomattel** (5): On one hand, I appreciate this, it stilll feels so formulaic and she just makes me quite bored

**frankiefrankiefrank** (4.6): Songs like this kinda fuel the whole "Halsey's so contrived" train of thought.

**fifthchevron** (4): The little Hurricane cameo was awesome. The lyrics are still kinda cringey though.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): why are you yelling at me

**letsallpoo** (3): britney outsold

**spaghettibread** (3): this song makes me reaaaaallly uncomfortable

**dirdbub** (2.5): this is such a bad rebellion song. where did this random robot code come from? why are you being one of those Tumblr blogs with the title "welcome to my twisted mind"? what is this discourse? like.. is this subliminal messaging from Halsey telling me to drink gasoline? because I was going to do that after this album anyways but thanks for the encouragement with this song. what the fuck

This is about the point in the album where I start losing interest. This song is just really boring and I forget what I heard the minute it ends

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): Iconic sad boy song. I listened the shit out of it last summer when there was a windy week and I was on vacation around a lake. I would go out every morning to the lake, and listen to this song while brooding in the wind.

**cyborglilith** (10): ok wig

**fifthchevron** (10): NOT READY TO BE FOUND. He has a real knack for singular lines of empowerment/self realisation that really stick.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): the only trop-pop song r/popheads should worship

**tooshorttoofast** (10): im just a lost boy not ready to be found :(

**twat\_brained** (10): I was not expecting a song THIS good at THIS point in the album! A definitive hit which DESERVED a single release and should be the first song that comes to mind when someone hears "Lost Boy" instead of **** *.

**blueheart** (9.5): This song hurts because I'm guilty of it. The first line of the chorus is basically what I did and it felt so bad to hurt someone I care about.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.5): The juxtaposition of it sounding so anthemic but actually being about a breakup is an interesting choice. Also I really like the instrumental parts, especially the melody in the marimba line (I'm mainly a fan of the repeated use of marimba in this album).

**PossumAloysuis** (9.5): Peter Pan's theme song

**blue\_charles** (9): hi i RELATE to this and that's TeRrIBLe but it's GREAT

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I like how this song comes after ‚ÄúYOUTH,‚Äù because it creates an interesting theme. The songs are kind of polar opposites to one another, ‚ÄúYOUTH‚Äù is specifically about embracing your youth and sharing it with another person, with the implied caveat that the reason youth is special is because it‚Äôs finite and running out, therefore giving your youth to someone is an act of sacrifice and devotion. With this track, we see him invoking Peter Pan, the boy who refused to grow up. If love involves giving your youth to someone, he‚Äôs metaphorically trying to not grow up by keeping love at an arm‚Äôs length. This highlights a consistent theme throughout Blue Neighborhood, the juxtaposition of wanting to love someone but being too afraid of the consequences, which is especially powerful given the queer context of the album.

**shineflyer** (9): this song is really cute, okay? like this makes me wanna cuddle up to my boyfriend. (I don't have a boyfriend, but if I DID...)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This isn‚Äôt a track I think about often, which is kinda sad, because that beat is just insanely good. It‚Äôs super haunting and chilling, and gentle enough to really make the song. It‚Äôs not Troye‚Äôs best lyrical work but it‚Äôs not that much of a distraction here.

**enecks** (8): ITS SUCH A LONG WAY DOWN https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWNdjEafof8

**nooodisaster** (8): "Build your hopes up like a tower" = :D | "I'm just a lost boy, lost boy" x infinity = D:

**spaghettibread** (8): nice

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Kygo's impact!!

**VeganSquash** (8): THE POP DROP IS SOOO GOOD, I LOVE THE XYLOPHONE

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (8): I think my favorite part is the little plunky synth melody following the chorus. It‚Äôs so catchy! The chorus is good too. Don‚Äôt have much else to say, it‚Äôs a good song!

**dirdbub** (7.5): this is cute. this album is cute. Troye's cute. I'm gay

**awryj** (7): Ooh, Allie X cowrote this one too. Explains the rather high bop factor.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Having trouble remembering stuff about this, though I can at least recall the chorus. It's good, but do we really need anymore Peter Pan references? It's an overrated mess of a movie. Sue me.

**SkyBlade79** (7): a bit reptitive but a minor bop

**theNealCutter** (7): verses sounds like Hurricane by Halsey and Clean Bandit's Rather Be. i like this song, sonically. but lyrically, kinda uncool. "It's not your fault, i'm just not ready" schtick is so fucking bitchy.

**lunasaflowers** (6.8): Can't decide if I like the drippy synth/sound or not. Still, it's a cute enough song.

**NapsAndNetflix** (6): Ruth B did it better and Kelsea Ballerina did Peter Pan bops better than her so

**zamomattel** (5.5): relatable bc I have a bad sense of direction

**MrSwearword** (5): it‚Äôs very middling and bores me

**Elitefourbrad** (4): I was lost after this song because I wanted to go to sleep after listening to this boring masterpiece.

**Mrachnie** (4): I like the ending of the first verse. The rest sounds generic and it would have been better off as just a piano ballad. FILLER.

**mokitsu** (3): honesly im fucking tired of this album, i thought he was some lorde wannabe like alessia (which isnt a bad thing because at LEAST the production is good), but all im getting is whispered lyrics over chainsmokers rejects. this album sucks and troye sivan needs vocal lessons. im really getting the impression that he's praised because he's gay and doesnt make boring music like sam smith, because if it was anyone else i doubt it would have fans.

I‚Äôm not gay but this had me questioning if I‚Äôm gonna make it to heaven myself. Really great emotion and passion coming though in this song. And huge shout out to Betty Who she steals the show for me

---

**agentofscranton** (10): god dammit who's chopping onions in here

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): This was my 2017 Pride Anthem. Such an amazing and inspiring song. Betty Who works amazingly well on the song, and their harmony with Troye is astounding.

**andreszmtz** (10): straight people can't relate

**blueheart** (10): Jack Antonoff and Grimes wrote on this song. When will your fave? On a serious note, this song is a soothing reassurance that it'll all be okay. Counting to fifteen (Troye came out of the closet at 15 - so did I) is something that I tell myself sometimes when I'm stressed.

**dirdbub** (10): https://twitter.com/sivakleysugglee/status/504220573837574144

**fifthchevron** (10): Ended homophobia. Takes a lot of bravery to write a song as honest as this.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Brb crying.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): It may have been ‚ÄúYouth‚Äù that was the big hit of the album, but this is arguably the album‚Äôs crown jewel. It‚Äôs the most mature and ‚Äúimportant‚Äù track on the album. The complicated relationship that queer people have with their faith is very tricky to navigate and he does it beautifully on this track. He never outright denounces his faith because it‚Äôs clearly still important to him, but at the same time he has to make his peace with the fact that he must continue to be who he really is even if it‚Äôs opposed to his faith. But at the same time he still points out that it‚Äôs a long, hard road to acceptance, but he can‚Äôt force himself to live any other way. Mentioning this in case no one else does, the ‚Äúcounting to 15‚Äù part is a reference to a) a coping mechanism Troye uses and b) the age that he came out to his family. I will say though, I‚Äôm unclear what Betty Who is doing there, she doesn‚Äôt really add or take anything away she‚Äôs just kind of there. At least she breaks the track up a bit, which helps prevent it from becoming monotonous.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Honestly, this song and video are both so fucking depressing in the best possible way.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Really hits me hard in the gut, since I'm queer and Episcopalian. I had to struggle with similar issues when I discovered I was trans and I still understand why some other queer people end up abandoning religion as a whole. Sonically, I think parts of this could be more well constructed to make this a better ballad than it already is, but the lyrics alone are more than enough to make this a great song. It's an 8, but I'll be bumping the score because of how much I relate to this.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): One of the best, if not the best chorus in the album, imo. Betty Who is the perfect collaboration here, and it‚Äôs an angelic track that lifts you up really high, never really bringing you down. It‚Äôs the perfect lead into the juggernaut Youth, and it‚Äôs definitely an album standout that blew me away on the first listen.

**theNealCutter** (10): my hart.

**tooshorttoofast** (10): as someone that has super religious parents, I can relate to this so much. My life is just one living lie to my parents and im scared ill never come out to them

**PossumAloysuis** (9.5): It's no Bad Religion but it comes kinda close

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): I feel really bad not giving this a 10 because it's easily the best attempt at making an introspective LGBT anthem I've seen from a (somewhat) mainstream pop artist but they should've gotten a better female vocalist. I actually think Halsey would've slayed this x_x

**Kaylaboe** (9): heavenly haunting

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): So sad :( and so good. Not sure why he's counting to 15 though, hope someone explains that in the comments.

**spaghettibread** (8.7): coolio fam

**nooodisaster** (8.5): I'm kinda over the whole "gays go to hell" angst, but beyond that this is just a great song. It's wild to think Betty Who is the unknown artist in this pairing.

**twat\_brained** (8.1): Good production on this and I really like the message it conveys. I just wish the video made more sense and actually featured Betty in it.

**Mrachnie** (8): Oh look, it's a "gayz r cool lel" song. Well, at least he's gay, so it doesen't sound as awkward as "Same Love" does. Also he finally collaborated with an artist i know, that's cool. I almost wish this was a Betty Who song because she fits is SO much better. His verse is SO hard to get through. Also random trap snairs are back with a vengeance.

**VeganSquash** (8): BETTY AND HER FAKE ASS HALSEY VOICE NEEDS TO LEAVE THIS MASTERPIECE OF A SONG

**awryj** (7): Good lyrics. Nice production.

**blue\_charles** (7): gay rights but like a song

**ComeOnAndSlang** (7): a decent song, tHe OOOO OoOOfgoosegjselfj take a lot out of it tHo

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6): It's ok but I feel like it doesn't go anywhere, like the chorus feels like just another verse.

**MashLuke** (6): I get the message but I don't like this

**zamomattel** (5): Troye is an Evangelical Christian CONFIRMED. NOT CLICKBAIT. Also Betty Who sounds like Dido. Troye's Stan????

**mokitsu** (3.5): so boring

**cyborglilith** (3): sooooooooooo boring

**shineflyer** (3): I guess I just listened to a song? But it's hard to remember anything I just heard.

**SkyBlade79** (2): god this song is boring. I don‚Äôt really get why people like it at all‚Ä¶ the production is bad too

**Elitefourbrad** (1): Betty Who ruined this already horrible song even more than I ever possibly thought.

deleted: **mirandacrocsgrove** (11): Does this even need an explanation for my eleven? Fuck it. I‚Äôll provide an assay. I know this is simply a forum game, but I tend to rarely give 11‚Äôs in a rate myself, but when I do they‚Äôre mostly sad bops and this one gets it. As somebody who had a rough time coming into terms with my own sexuality, this song speaks to me. I love how it begins with basically talking about how you HAVE to put on a cover to maintain your pride and to avoid getting hurt, most especially, avoiding to hurt the ones you love. Where I am from is an extremely unfriendly place if you aren‚Äôt heterosexual (I identify as pansexual for reference). You can hear slurs casually thrown around where I live and that‚Äôs just heartbreaking. To make matters worse for me, I was raised in an extremely religious household. It wasn‚Äôt until I started getting older when this assertive way of religious living has come to a halt. I mean I‚Äôm 21 and my family still sometimes can be forceful for me to join them in church on Sundays, but to keep this assay short, I won‚Äôt expound on this matter anymore. There‚Äôs always been a voice that‚Äôs inside of me. Sometimes it‚Äôs out wild without my consent and I just have to bottle up my emotions when I get teased with degrading comments regarding the way I look, the way I act ‚Äì the way other people see me. The hardest person to ever come out to was myself. I‚Äôve always known I wasn‚Äôt exclusively attracted to the opposite gender. And just like Troye, I had to ask myself if I‚Äôm ever capable of being loved, if I‚Äôm ever going to be able to have a child of my own, if there is a Heaven where I belong, and how could I possibly get to Heaven if I‚Äôm not exactly what the religious teachings have taught me? These questions have been in my head and they just don‚Äôt sit with me well. One, there‚Äôs the aforementioned phobia against people who‚Äôs also attracted to their own gender; Two, I‚Äôve always wanted to have kids, but the fact that I‚Äôm also attracted to someone from my own gender meant that I might not be able to have my own and this was beyond heartbreaking (I love how the song also imagines a child looking up to Troye, which is something I tend to imagine myself, too); Three, the idea that I was already a sinner by being myself threw me off greatly and I still get sad at how I have to choose to either be religious or be true to myself to be accepted by people or just to be able to accept my own self fully. This song was beyond therapeutic for me. I had chills the first time I heard it and kept it playing on repeat. I was on a train when I first listened to this and I had to keep myself together to prevent myself from weeping. Not gonna lie, I still get emotional at times listening to this song. At times, I cry myself to sleep with this one playing in the background. Also, I have never been really close to a homosexual who went through a coming out stage who could have possibly served as an ideal role model. This is one of the reasons why I‚Äôm quite thankful for the community of r/popheads which kind of like felt more than just a community. I‚Äôve never come to fully acknowledge my own sexuality until the past year, and popheads felt like a safe place for me. So how do I get to Heaven without losing a piece of me? Without losing a part of me? ‚Äì Maybe I don‚Äôt want Heaven; I‚Äôve always wanted to be able to talk freely about my desires, dreams, and just talk about my future, but it sucks how I can‚Äôt even openly talk to it about people I would love to due to the aforementioned degradation once you come out. I can‚Äôt even talk to my own best friend/closest people regarding both boys, girls, and any gender in between due to their previous homophobic remarks and that‚Äôs just bothersome. This is why I‚Äôm also thankful for my online friends who I can freely talk about these things with. Maybe one day I‚Äôll feel liberated. ‚Äì Maybe I‚Äôll find Heaven. PS I also adore the bridge where Troye sings he‚Äôs counting to fifteen. If anyone doesn‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs what he does whenever he‚Äôs feeling nervous: count to fifteen until he can feel himself calm down. Coincidentally, 15 is also the age when he came out to everyone he knew, so 15 an ode to both of these things.

**timothy444** (11): Even though I'm a straight man, this song made me feel the struggles of being gay for some reason. That's how amazing of an impact this song has!

**OxfordSemicolon** (11): I love this song. I don't think it's close to being the best here musically, but I don't really care because this speaks to me. The first time I heard it I had to stop what I was doing to make sure I heard it right, because it's almost exactly how I felt about religion for a while. I've only rarely heard anyone talk about this this way, so it was surreal (but great) to hear it in a song.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (11): Many of your faves have written songs with Jack Antinoff and had those songs produced by him, but when will your fave do that PLUS have fuckin‚Äô GRIMES as a cowriter?? An absolutely beautiful song instrumentally and lyrically. As someone who has struggled to reconcile queerness with religion/spirituality, this song had me SHOOK the first time I heard it (I am good now!). Betty Who sounds great on the track as well. I can‚Äôt sing the praises of this song enough. If this doesn‚Äôt make the top 5 of the rate, I‚Äôm shutting this sub DOWN.


**MrSwearword** (0): sure the video is moving, but this song got on my nerves with how haphazard and chaotic it all is & Betty Who does nothing for me on this.

This is really nice and moody. His voice and the production blend together just right to set the atmosphere but honestly this song still doesn't do anything for me

---
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): Where to start? This is one of my favorite songs ever, straight up. Troye's delivery is just full of pain, and the lyrics are simple, yet gorgeous. The hook gives me chills. Every. Single. Time. The bridge is godly. The production, out of this world. The video? Almost turned me gay. If previous experience in rates is anything to go by, this won't make it to day 3, but to me, this is the best song in this rate by a long fucking mile. I feel like I'm not even doing justice to how much I love this song with what I'm writing down, but I just really love this song, and I can't wait until I have someone in my life that will make this song sound even better and more meaningful.

---

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): toot

**blue\_charles** (10): whenever I hear this, I think of the music video and that's an emotional pain I'd like to leave in the past.

**cyborglilith** (10): another Halsey copycat, I see‚Ä¶ /s

**dirdbub** (10): this is upper-class, suburban, white teen core and I fucken live for it

**enecks** (10): This is the track that hits me personally. Please, if you are struggling with mental health issues, or suicidal thoughts, seek help.

**fifthchevron** (10): If someone ever asks you to play them a song that perfectly encapsulates what "atmosphere" or "mood" is/feels like, play this song.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Troye does such a good job at capturing emotions I think we all feel but aren't sure how to express. I love this song.

**MrSwearword** (10): OK so I largely don‚Äôt see it for Troye, but admittedly this is done rather well especially considering this is an artist I don‚Äôt like.

**omni\_nomni** (10): makes me sad every time i love it

**theNealCutter** (10): Y U MAKIN ME CRIE

**tooshorttoofast** (10): the ending never fails to make me teary-eyed

**twat\_brained** (10): While the song is immensely beautiful and the video reveals a heartbreaking yet captivating end to the BN trilogy, I have to ask: what is it Troye needs talking down from? A roof he's about to jump off? From a high he got on using drugs? I still love the song but I'd appreciate some closure.

**PossumAloysuis** (9.5): The production is immaculate.

**lunasaflowers** (9): Troye's vocals and the strings really make this track hit.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Alright, all the previous songs were pretty sad but this is the first guaranteed tearjerker on Blue Neighbourhood. It's apparently supposed to be really relatable, which I actually totally get, even if I'm not interested in having a romantic relationship with any gender. The feels here are too real.

**Mrachnie** (8.5): I like this. It's a ballad, but it offers something unique by putting this really harsh electronic beat in the background during the chorus which doesent feels like it's shoehorned in, unlike in some other songs (hi DKLA). Also the caps lock titles gimmick is getting old really fast.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Gurl the bridge is unreal.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (8.5): Crying emoji damn, Troye bringing on the emotions! The instrumental is a little bland, but Troye really sells the vocals and the lyrics. If you haven‚Äôt watched the Blue Neighbourhood trilogy of music videos, this is the last one and it is v good and emotional and you should definitely watch it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Literally just @me next time Troye, yes I used to sleep with a pillow touching my back to mimic the feeling of my ex-boyfriend. You didn‚Äôt need to expose me like this.

**OxfordSemicolon** (8): I like how big the production is.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I love how ethereal this track is, it just gives me chills. Unfortunately, it never truly reaches the heights it should, but it‚Äôs still a seriously beautiful song. I like the lyrics here a lot, and as repetitive as they are, they feel really comforting.

**zamomattel** (7.5): I wish chris pratt would talk me down. Anyway this sounds like if Sam Smith did good songs

**MashLuke** (7): This is just a song really

**spaghettibread** (6.5): its alright I guess

**awryj** (5.5): All of these songs start to sound the same. I guess it's a sign of... cohesiveness?

**mokitsu** (5.5): cute, but not interesting.

**shineflyer** (5): feels like it's trying to be bigger than it is

**Elitefourbrad** (4): Payola

**SkyBlade79** (3): boring and vanilla

amumumyspiritanimal: Okay the past two days were torture for my poor gay heart and I'll never forgive yall for this, but tbh all the remaining songs are bops, and besides Roman Holiday(9) and Four Pink Walls(8,5), these are all 10's and 11's from me. Also, Blue Neighborhood's most song has a 7+ avg which indicates it's a decent album according to y'all.

Yet you people are still homophobic with that for him. placements I can't even

1) The best singer out of these three by a mile
2) Has the album with the most filler, but also the greatest high points (someone please switch Outlaws and Wild Things though)
