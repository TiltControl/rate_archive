I think we can all agree nothing will ever top the original of this and I want to apologize to Johnny that this even exists because it feels so unnecessary but honestly I don’t mind it I even kind of like it. I would in no way would listen to this over the original but this has it’s own appeal and it’s cool.

---

**frankiefrankiefrank** (0): I hate when people try to cover iconic songs and their interpretations just don't work. Please put this in the same graveyard as Fallout Boy's version of "Beat It."

**OxfordSemicolon** (0): Why would Halsey think a shitty Johnny Cash cover (and it is so, so shitty) would be a good idea? This song shouldn't exist.

---
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): i know this is gonna get out soon but i wanna defend it. i love this cover so much. it was a pretty, happyish guitar song by johnny cash and she turned it into this hauntingly beautiful track. the effects in the first few seconds provide such a good precursor to the track and such a good "beginning to the end". i get chills when the strings come in everytime.... damn. super rare to hear this much passion in a studio version of a cover, but she finessed this.

**gannade** (10): This will probably be eliminated really early and it will be a shame. Love this cover and how she turned it into a dark little bop.

**mokitsu** (10): ever since i joined countryheads i love johnny cash!

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): This is the good version of Young God. I really get that 40's feeling from this song. I can actually believe that Halsey is a badass gangster in love.

**PossumAloysuis** (9): Johnny Cash's influence

**Elitefourbrad** (8): A great album closer, I love the distinctive beat to this.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Honestly? I gotta give Halsey props for this one, this is a cool cover.

**lunasaflowers** (8): The instrumentals are gorgeous on this track, but I'm not sure if I really like how fractured Halsey's vocals sound.

**MashLuke** (8): I didn't know this was a cover but it's a nice way to end the album

**poppinmmolly** (8): I know this is a joke format but Johnny actually did it better.

**SkyBlade79** (8): weird for a closer and seems SUPER short for some reason

**twat\_brained** (8): I don't think this cover is necessary but dammit this album is my muse and I love any and every song on it.

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): Chilling closer

**enecks** (7): This song walks the line between being bad and good. It is good barely.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): This is gonna be interesting to see the scores for

**MrSwearword** (7): in terms of covers, this is of Halsey’s style but it doesn’t totally work.

**nooodisaster** (6.5): It's done.

**Raykel** (6.5): I see what she was trying to do here but she didn't quite get that view she was going for. But props to her for making the production of the song different from the original.

**shineflyer** (6.5): using Johnny Cash lyrics was a strange choice, but the song's a mood, and it's cool as a closing track.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): Not bad. I could see it being used in a TV show.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6): Not bad but quite weak for a closer IMO

**tooshorttoofast** (6): another filler-like song; not a strong closer

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (6): I gotta give Halsey credit, it takes a lot of guts to cover a song THIS famous and iconic. And to be fair, it’s not bad! But the whole time I’m listening to it, I can’t help thinking that I should just be listening to Johnny Cash’s version.

**blue\_charles** (5): A decent cover, and one that's in Halsey's wheelhouse, but also kinda really bland.

**cyborglilith** (5): this is good but boring

**omni\_nomni** (5): this song isn't awful but i personally don't like it so meh

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Johnny Cash, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Is Halsey going to cover Hurt before she dies? Is she going to fill her cover of it with unnecessary production elements, as well? The thought makes me ill.

**theNealCutter** (5): eh. at this point, i'm glad the album's over.

**spaghettibread** (4.9): boring

**awryj** (4): I'm exhausted

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): I’m just glad this is over thank god.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (3): took a blassic 10 and made it a 5 smh. Minus 2 points for desecrating tHe original

**mustangs16** (3): this was an unnecessary cover, imo

**dirdbub** (2.5): no shade but literally how much more boring can you make this song's thesis than how this song is

**VeganSquash** (2.5): meh

**Mrachnie** (2): Oh my fucking god. Slowing this song down just makes no fucking sense. The tongue-in-cheek sound of the original is the only thing that made it good, and turning it into... this just makes it sound like it was written by Halsey (that's not a compliment).

**NapsAndNetflix** (2): this is embarrassing

**zamomattel** (1.5): Her vocals are just so grating in their laziness

This song was done so wrong by yall. In my opinion this song is such a nice sweet piano ballad. Its serves its purpose well by just being cute and longing. It’s a nice little song to listen to in the middle of the night when you’re lonely and I think Alessia hit that feeling perfectly in this song.

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): major bop 2.0

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): A cute little piano ballad with a nice message.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): A sweet piano ballad :)

**PossumAloysuis** (9): I would make a Airplanes reference here but nah. Gorgeous piano

**ComeOnAndSlang** (8): mmm i love piano

**shineflyer** (8): I mean, it's not as if a piano ballad is anything new, but it's really sweet and romantic. I can't hate anything that sounds this earnest.

**theNealCutter** (8): the lyrics are nice. this is just a sweet song. her vibratto on the bridge just adds emotion.

**therokinrolla** (8): a cute bop /u/ForretressArtillery, hi bill!

**timothy444** (8): A ballad? Borrriiinnnngggg! https://pre00.deviantart.net/98cb/th/pre/f/2012/035/3/e/rainbow_dash_bored_to_death_by_alsatianvdk-d4on2kj.png. Jokes aside, what seperates for a typical ballad like 95% of the first tumblrcore rate is that the lyrics speak out to me. Also, Daya's tone in voice in this track performs more than expression of an idea, it's a heartfelt one and I really felt that Alessia Cara spoke to me. This is probably like the first time I have such a 'boring' song a high score!"

**jamesfog** (7.5): I appreciate piano ballads, but this isn't too unique.

**spaghettibread** (7.5): cute

**blue\_charles** (7): Another weaker ballad, but one that wins me over with honest and earnest lyrics.

**Mrachnie** (7): Ooh a piano ballad! Piano fits her much better than guitar and the lyrics on this song are pretty, even though her just repeating one line over and over for the chorus is getting old.

**twat\_brained** (6.8): I mean… it's very cute but it feels very bland.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): It's better than Stone, but still underwhelming. I don't think piano ballads are her thing.

**dropthehammer11** (6): Again, kinda boring. Her ballads don't have that punch that others do.

**MrSwearword** (6): the piano is nice but it wore a little…thin for my liking.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): This one is fine as it is, but it's a classic Janet problem of ballads sounding too alike; it's pretty hard to ignore the similarities with Stone. I like We'll be the Stars by Sabrina Carpenter better, to be honest.

**tooshorttoofast** (6): kinda boring

**mokitsu** (5.5): this album is serving PRISM teas, first half are good bops, second half are boring ballads!

**nooodisaster** (5.5): Oh my god it's so boring.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (5): as someone who LOVES ballads, i really really dont think ballads are her thing. i love her. but i really find her ballads boring.

**cyborglilith** (5): literally filler

**frankiefrankiefrank** (4.6): Now she's being saddled with some Ruth B. singer-songwriter stuff? This sounds like something your friend would write for an open mic night in high school ughhhhhhhhh.

**awryj** (4): Upon multiple listens, I have concluded that this song definitely exists.

**banananaise** (4): every song with 'stars' in the name automatically becomes boring as hell

**MashLuke** (4): Mac'n'Stars recipe - 1) cook macaroni according to the package direction. Drain; 2) in a saucepan, melt butter or margarine over medium heat. Stir in enough flour to make a roux. Add milk to roux slowly, stirring constantly. Stir in Stars, and cook over low heat until Stars is melted and the sauce is a little thick. Put macaroni in large casserole dish, and pour sauce over macaroni. Stir well; 3) Melt butter or margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs and brown. Spread over the macaroni and some Stars to cover. Sprinkle with a little paprika; 4) Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Serve. Bon Appetit.

**strawberryswing1** (4): wow this is so basic

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): aol.com most ballady ballad you got

**zamomattel** (4): This is almost as beige as Alessia herself

**dirdbub** (3): well that was bland and forgettable I need to get you alone now you wanna choose just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi it's not good enough for me since I've bee

**SkyBlade79** (3): a snooze, boring

**blueheart** (2): I don't like this song by itself but the beginning of the verses reminds me of this song for some reason and like, I can't unhear that now. It's a better song anyway.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (1): it's just awful uninteresting from the instrumental to her trite, tired lyricism

**Elitefourbrad** (1): I fell asleep to this song sadly.

I realize this song is pretty controversial because these self-empowerment songs are so done and tired in pop music but man this song bangs I don’t care what anyone says. The verses do feel like they were written by a bunch of executives just trying to make some money by pandering but the chorus is so anathematic and it’s the part of the song that sounds the most natural and so for that I can forgive everything else in the song.

---

**Elitefourbrad** (0): This song suffered greatly from overplay. But honestly, I don’t really understand what Alessia is going for here. I know it’s supposed to be an empowerment anthem, but I just think it’s pretty meh. It’s good to be accepting some criticism in your life and not everything you can do is perfect, that’s a message that’s seemed to be lost in this generation. The video is even worse, objectifying people with diseases and conditions as props for her message.

**enecks** (0): If you're going to approach issues like self-harm or plastic surgery or whatever this is about you need to either be empowering or have a good perspective. This has neither and is a mix of trite cliches and trite production.

**mustangs16** (0): it turns out that i hate this song more than i hate new americana, wow

**strawberryswing1** (0): I can't stand this type of empowerment shit, I'm sure she comes from a good place and all I just can't stand it and find it so disingenuous and annoying. however the production on the album version seems a lot better and nuanced than the radio version, i'll give her that.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (0): I REALLY do not like this song. I STILL don’t know what “scars to your beautiful” actually means. The instrumental is boring, which is a bad thing to be when you’re a self-empowerment anthem. Again, this could resonate more with teenagers, especially women, but it’s just not for me. Sorry.

---
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Singing a song about beauty standards is a bit difficult because it can sometimes go towards the "Surgery is bad for you" route and I think Alessia did a fine job not crossing that line, backed with a beautiful synth-pop production.

**jamesfog** (10): We love a major anthem.

**cyborglilith** (9.5): The last high note at the end is always jarring. It would be perfect otherwise!

**zamomattel** (9.5): sounds like a Kelly Clarkson reject but the chorus is cute

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9): i like everytHing about tHis song EXCEPT tHe part wHere sHe says scars to your beautiful. I just don’t like tHe way it’s delivered. So everyone wHo complains about “scars to your beautiful” not making sense, SHUT THE FUCK UP, it gets tHe point across stop being so pedantic

**SkyBlade79** (9): I feel like a hipster because I knew this song WAY before it was famous and I loved it back then

**tooshorttoofast** (9): idc what anyone says but I love it, uplifting bop

**dropthehammer11** (8.5): Great song with such a beautiful message, and that note she hits towards the end is everything

**mokitsu** (8.5): i love the production but i'm not sure about some of these lyrics

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): I guess I'm in the mood for assays today. I know popheads doesn't think highly of this song, and I can see why. I still like it though, despite its obvious corniness. I'll appreciate any song with a positive message, even if they're not musically appealing to me (see: Logic's song about suicide). However, I don't mind the sound of this song anyway, and I think the hook is really strong and catchy. At one point this got overplayed to the point of being annoying, but I think it's a decent song with a nice message that just happened to get out of the rate in day 1.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): actually a good body image/"inspirational" track tbh

**gannade** (8): yeah yeah it's generic but it's a bop.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Remember when this song peaked in the Top 10? Yeah, I can see why people didn't like it as much as Here. But it's a great song; this is much more genuine than the usual self-empowerment album, and it deals with the tricky topic of eating disorders very well. I don't know what having anorexia or any similar problem is like, but you can be that Alessia cares a lot for people who suffer from said kinds of sicknesses. Seeing a teenage girl encourage her young peers is very nice.

**PossumAloysuis** (8): A little heavy handed but still a good track.

**therokinrolla** (8): also a cute bop. Will be very robbed, i can see it now!

**twat\_brained** (7.6): I can appreciate where Alessia's coming from with this single, and her heart is in the right place with the video, especially knowing JoJo even has self-esteem struggles, but I feel like it could've been executed better.

**chipsi1** (7.5): I actually never got the hate behind this song. Yes, she's trying to sound more mature than she actually is and it is noticeable but this isn't bad. it's really cute and I don't see the problem tbh.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.5): This song works better for her than the other straight-up pop songs on the album. I like the way the background vocals are layered so she's not belting up high on the lead line, because her mid to low range is where she really shines vocally. Also, the lyrics are uplifting in ways songs like "Wild Things" and "Seventeen" try to be but don't quite achieve.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): I still don't know what "scars to your beautiful" means, but this is a wholesome bop.

**timothy444** (7.5): I feel filthy after giving this an 8. Honestly, I wanted to give it a lower score but it flows well into the album. When taken out of context, it's just 'Fight Song' and 'Roar' but with more power.

**VeganSquash** (7.5): I have heard this on the radio at least 25 times

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): She chose to build this song around a really clunky phrase (“Beautiful” as a noun?) but on the whole I think she did a good job with this song. It is an uplifting piece. I know there are a lot of people who say stuff like “women don’t have to be beautiful” and they’re absolutely right, society needs to stop putting pressure on women to be pretty, but at the same time there’s nothing necessarily wrong with wanting to feel beautiful even just for yourself. Self-love is important, and this is a song that tells people that, and I think that’s admirable. However, not the most memorable song on the album.

**MashLuke** (7): the beat is underwhelming and the chorus doesn't really work but verses are well written. I think we lowkey hate anything that's too wholesome, we're petty bitches who like drama.

**spaghettibread** (7): meh

**theNealCutter** (7): bland.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Jesus christ this song gets dark.

**OxfordSemicolon** (5): I appreciate what she was trying to do here, and I hope she succeeded and the song connected with someone. That said, I don't think it's good.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): yahoo.com how do i make a song for an abc tv show trailer

**amumumyspiritanimal** (4): shitty fight song

**awryj** (4): Every time this song comes on, I think of an anti-aging facial cream commercial

**blue\_charles** (4): Civilization will end and we still won't understand exactly what "Scars to Your Beautiful" means

**fifthchevron** (3): Please music industry, stop telling women what to do.

**Mrachnie** (3): Oh god i hate this song. It just sounds so annoying and preachy while trying to be "self-empowering". ALSO BEAUTIFUL IS NOT A NOUN ALESSIA.

**NapsAndNetflix** (3): I'm sorry I just never liked this song I changed the radio station every time it came on

**bwc222** (2.5): songs that are meant to be empowering for teen girls always come off as trying too hard for me

**dirdbub** (2.5): I get that this is an empowerment anthem and kudos for that, but holy fuck this felt so forced. also, what does the title even mean oh oh when you nod your head yes but you wanna say no what do you mean hey-ey when you don't want me to move but you tell me to go what do you mea

**shineflyer** (2): I hope this song inspires someone, it's got a good message. but that on synth on the chorus sounds like it's from an old sci-fi movie.

**MrSwearword** (1): “All About that Bass” did this better by being peppy and upbeat; that feel-good sentiment without the drippy, “relatable” attempts at emotional connection.

This song is such a mess and highkey Troye should just make a swift exit and give the song to Tkay

---

**gannade** (0): you can thank the rap for this 0. the production and the rap just does NOT mix. she comes in like a blaring siren banshee compared to the rest of the track.

**twat\_brained** (0): Uh… was this a Banks reject? Also I like Tkay but her verse was really unnecessary here and she's going so fast that it's kinda hard to keep up with her. it should've never made the final cut


---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): This song has the most perfect production on the whole album. Also, Tkay Maidza is a gem. This song is my go-to "walking home at night after sundown in the rain and being depressed generally", even though it's about relationships. God I fear the day I will completely understand the lyrics.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): This is a 10 just because of Tkay Maidza’s verse because holy shit I live.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Man, his hooks are just so fucking good!!! Tkay Maidza's part is pretty cool too. She needs a better stage name though cause wtf is that?

**dirdbub** (8.5): that beat is fucken menacing, my god

**nooodisaster** (8.5): There's a slow intensity to this song that's hypnotizing. Then the rap verse bursts it down in the best way possible.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): A white gay guy with a rapper on his album? Colour me shook. Well, the chick featured here may actually be white. I don't know, I liked her verse. This is a much better use of electronic elements than The Quiet, helped by the lack of a grating instrument.

**PossumAloysuis** (8.5): A short, kinda unnecessary rap verse awkwardly put on a song? Some things just don't die

**cyborglilith** (8): why is this good I should be hating this album

**mokitsu** (8): atmospheric and interesting, i like this!

**tooshorttoofast** (8): amazing production

**zamomattel** (8): wow a mood

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.5): Pretty good, although I am noticing all the bonus tracks are a bit darker and sparser than the stuff on the standard album.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (7.5): Definitely one of the moodiest cuts on the album. The beat sounds like it would work really well for an artist like BANKS, but Troye sounds pretty good on it, if a little distant. “Absence makes the heart grow fonder said by someone stronger than me” is a great line too!

**banananaise** (7): REAL AUSSIE ICON TKAY, TAYLOR COULD NEVER

**dropthehammer11** (7): Guest verse is cool

**MrSwearword** (7): Tkay mostly makes the track but even then, her flow doesn’t work for the song because it’s slightly faster than what the song calls for but at least something’s there.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I’ve always wanted to talk about this song because there’s something about me that always has bugged me. In the beginning, around 0:31, there’s a really insanely industrial screech that happens. It’s like my favorite sound in the whole world, and when I first listened, I was excited to hear it again, but unfortunately, we never do. It’s such a missed opportunity, something that reminds me of something like Hold My Liquor by Kanye West, and the rest of the song doesn’t live up to that little segment. It’s a dark, solid track, and I like the rap feature, but it’s missing something like that and feels too empty without some harsh contrast.

**shineflyer** (6.5): the best way I can describe this song is artistically robotic.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): Kind of too heavy to work as a full song...I would appreciate this more as an interlude.

**Raykel** (6): Interesting at first, but the song got boring really quick. The rap gave it the spice it needed, but honestly not enough to the point where I'd listen to this willingly on a random day.

**theNealCutter** (6): droning.

**Mrachnie** (5.6): This song sounds like it would be in a trailer for a very hyped-up movie which then would flop. The electropop instrumental on this is nice but the trap snares in the background don't serve any purpose rather than just being annoying and a verse from a Walmart Azealia Banks is just as useless. It's filler, and not the good kind.

**lunasaflowers** (5.5): Tkay Maidza's part feels kinda out of place here.

**VeganSquash** (5.5): RAP FEATURE WAS TOO SHORT

**awryj** (5): At first I thought it was Nicki

**blue\_charles** (5): Arguably the weakest track on the album, weak and repetitive lyrics and a real disappointment from someone like Troye who's lyrics are usually so on point.

**SkyBlade79** (5): the feature is rather pointless

**AFlyingWhale\_** (4): Niall Horan ft. Nicki Minaj

**OxfordSemicolon** (4): This was left off the non-deluxe album for a reason, i.e. it's bad.

**twat\_brained** (4): Uh… was this a Banks reject? Also I like Tkay but her verse was really unnecessary here and she's going so fast that it's kinda hard to keep up with her.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): A real dud, probably the worst track on the album. I think the major flaw with this track is that it lacks energy, it doesn’t build, it doesn’t go anywhere. It just sits in this kind of dreary place that isn’t particularly interesting. Also the rap verse is kind of weird? Like, it happens and I can’t catch any of the words that they’re saying, and then it just kind of ends and the song continues like it didn’t happen. It could have been the shot of energy that the song needed but ultimately it ended up being inconsequential. It’s relatable, but that’s not enough to carry the song.

**letsallpoo** (3): tkay deserved better than this. stream "u-huh" on tidal

**NapsAndNetflix** (2): boring until the random rap break but that can’t save it

**spaghettibread** (1): no

Yall did this song so wrong. When I listen to this song it feels like peace. In my opinion she hits that perfect vibe of being so calm and assured in this person she loves and just letting the wind take her where she needs to go and letting her lover hold her down when it gets rough. Lowkey Sebastion isn’t necessary but they sound nice together and together they make the song flow really well.

---
**shineflyer** (11): This song gave me a cozy blanket and a warm cup of cocoa, and told me that everything will be okay.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Lowkey one of the best songs on the album, this is such a chill bop. Normally I don’t like songs that are like “never change” because change is an important part of life, but I really like the way she goes about it here. She’s asking for consistency, the world is a scary, tumultuous place and it’s nice to have someone to turn to who will always be there. It’s… it’s a nice thought. And Alessia is really on fire here, acoustic covers are how she rose to prominence so she’s really in her element here and she delivers a flawless vocal performance. Sebastian Kole is also there (he’s a producer for most of the tracks on the album but he’s featured on this one) and while he isn’t super noticeable, his background vocals really add to the song.

**MrSwearword** (10): I’m actually not mad at this. Quite pleasant.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): A beautiful folk ballad. Sufjan who? Bon Iver who?

**theNealCutter** (9): this song just grew on me more and more as I listen to it. it's just calming. i dunno if i'm glad or disappointed that the guy was less prominent on the track.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): So wholesome.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): Not really one for ballads but it's pleasant to listen to. I gave up on paying attention to the lyrics halfway through bc I couldn't understand Alessia lol

**ComeOnAndSlang** (7.5): ok ok ok ok ok OK

**mokitsu** (7.5): a nice ballad!

**spaghettibread** (7.5): a lil forgettable

**therokinrolla** (7.3): i do not support marijuana of any kind

**agentofscranton** (7): this sounds like it’s from the soundtrack to the film adaptation of some young adult novel

**jamesfog** (7): Sorry, it's just a little boring...

**lunasaflowers** (7): Very smooth and melodic!

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Unless this is some sort of clever reference I'm not really feeling the comparison. Saying a loved one's a stone? IDK. People usually call each other stones when they're pissed off at them not hurrying up with what they're doing. That being said, this is a perfectly decent ballad. It could have been filler, but I don't think it quite matches that description.

**tooshorttoofast** (7): nice ballad

**amumumyspiritanimal** (6): first alessia song im not really feeling at all...

**dropthehammer11** (6): Cute ballad, but kinda boring

**strawberryswing1** (6): i don't want to be a cliche pophead giving a ballad a mediocre score but this didn't make me feel anything really. it's pretty, but that's it. // post listen edit: omg wtf this song had a feature??? when??

**andreszmtz** (5.6): a walmart version of a taylor swift song

**Raykel** (5.5): This song isn't bad per se I'm just so bored I might sleep.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (5): pretty underwhelming..... super filler

**blue\_charles** (5): A harmless ballad, but unfortunately a little dull and ultimately unmemorable.

**Mrachnie** (5): Yay more filler. I have no idea who Sebastian Kole is and even less of an idea why he is cited as a feature even though he just does backing vocals. Also, can Alessia please stop trying to make acoustic guitars happen? They're not happening.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): hi operator how do i make a song boring and long

**timothy444** (5): Forgettable

**awryj** (4.5): This is basically a bland Taylor Swift ballad. The metaphor is nice I guess. I will never listen to this song again anyway. EDIT: I listened to it again to review my scores

**cyborglilith** (4): this is like a song on red but without the good singer

**Elitefourbrad** (4): Boring ballad.

There’s really not a lot to say about this song. It’s the middle of the stretch of songs that have different production and are just not as good as the others. I bet if I was in the mood for it it would be a lot better but most of the time I find myself pretty bored with this song

---

**VeganSquash** (0): Her fake ass indie voice really comes out on this song. SO annoying

**zamomattel** (0): This song is what I imagine coming down from heroin feels like

---
**mokitsu** (10): i love how this feels like a sequel to Drive. i absolutely love the lyrics, they're my favorite in the record

**MrSwearword** (10): the lyrical misses are few and far between here and at least it’s consistent in what it tries to do and how it’s executed.

**twat\_brained** (10): Another strong point on "Badlands", showcasing how well Halsey can work with minimalistic instrumentals.

**twerklovr23** (10): I forgot how amazing this song was

**shineflyer** (9): contains the best, most memorable chorus lyrics on the album. i want to make out to this, on the off-chance I date someone

**lunasaflowers** (8): Love the acoustic guitar in the mix on this track!

**MashLuke** (8): Cute

**Mrachnie** (8): This is kinda nice. I still stand by my saying that acoustic guitars fit Halsey better than they do Alessia, and the minimalism of the lyrics doesen't feel out of place.

**PossumAloysuis** (8): There's only one Coming Down I know and it's by Mr. Tesfaye

**theNealCutter** (8): I really like the verses here. It's kinda clever.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7.8): In general, I feel like the songs with guitar fit her better than the electronic production. Also, the lyrics fit the mood of the song really well.

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): Simple little track. Like the guitars here.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (7.5): One of the more lyrically strong songs on the album! Halsey’s more restrained vocals also go over well. The instrumental is fine, so I can’t give it a super high score, but definitely solid!

**Elitefourbrad** (7): These lyrics are painfully tumblry but I still love it.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): The chorus is too lowkey for me, to be honest. I'm not saying this isn't a good song, because it is, but I wouldn't expect a song where Halsey mentions somebody eating out her vagina to be so monotonous?! IDK.

**blue\_charles** (6): Kinda bland, and though it builds an atmosphere I can't shake the feeling that this is album filler.

**nooodisaster** (6): Why is so much of this album so average? Like it's not bad, it's just... there.

**SkyBlade79** (6): bit repetitive

**awryj** (5): The lyrics are pretty imaginative, but the song itself feels too fillery

**chipsi1** (5): I'm indifferent on this. it's chill and easy to listen to, but I also forgot I was listening to something while listening to it, so.

**cyborglilith** (5): idk what this is

**mirandacrocsgrove** (5): pretty filler tbh

**strawberryswing1** (5): forgettable album track

**spaghettibread** (4.8): meh

**dirdbub** (4): is it too much to ask for more than one song in a row that's good

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): See, this is what people complain about Halsey. The lyrics to this song sound cool, but when you really look at them you realize they’re just a string of aesthetic nonsense words and concepts that don’t make any sense together.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): This one is really annoying. It’s kinda boring and I just don’t like the chorus at all. Sorry Halsey, but this is super repetitive and I can’t deal with it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): Yeah this one's pretty boring.

**tooshorttoofast** (4): kinda boring

**amumumyspiritanimal** (2): the only thing that coming down is the quality of the album with this song. sad, Drive-Strange Love was great.

**fifthchevron** (1): Nothing remarkable happening here.

Yikes this song gets way too much hate. This is like hardly the most pretentious song in this rate even. I don’t care what anyone says the chorus is good maybe even amazing. The legal weed line and the Biggie and Nirvana lines just work. It’s overly pretentious because this is an anthem for the pretentious teens and for that reason I can excuse it.

---
**enecks** (11): OK so what the fuck is this score I gave? An 11? For a song I have dissed a lot in the past? Yes, it is. I called this the song that 2016's election deserved association with. I called this a failed version of Closer. Yet there's a weird vibe to it - it's a strawman of millenials - lawful rebellions, claiming other generation's cultural achievements as their own. It's a song that has a atmospheric thrust to it thanks to some thumping theatrical production. It's a grand irony. If there's anything to summarise this generation, it's a grand irony that unites. Halsey unintentionally captured this collective subconscious in the same way that The Chainsmokers captured the collective consciousness with Closer. It's a miracle of a mistake. It is the New Americana.

**zamomattel** (11): Am I ashamed of giving this my 11? Yeah a little. But didn't we all get raised on Biggie & Nirvana? I do actually feel like this song sums up a certain generation and it's by far my favourite Halsey song.

---

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): Oh boy this is going to have a crazy controversy score but I'll throw my hat in anyway. I think it's just awfully neat commentary on society in general (inb4 how hard did I have to try to make this stretch?) and everything between her writing and the instrumental work super well to achieve this. Production wise, I'm not sure how to describe it - just like the rest of Badlands it's super atmospheric and climactic, and I love all the subtle synth flourishes. She covers money, capitalism, weed, pop culture, and being non-straight. People are definitely gonna drag this song for the lyrics, stuff like "biggie & nirvana"/"legal marijuana"/"what kind of dough have you been spending?", but frankly I don't see anything wrong with them. They're somewhat contrived yes (which is also what people say about Halsey in general) but they're there for a reason. I'm not exactly the target audience for New Americana but it is just beautiful.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): The millennial anthem for the ages. Halsey is the quintessential millennial queen. Stay safe with your legal weed kids!

**jamesfog** (10): I get the hate, but... issa bop.

**mokitsu** (10): halsey chose a great lana song to rip off. the production is great and i actually love the lyrics, they tell a cute story. it was fun to hate this...in 2015. move on and accept this is good!

**cyborglilith** (9): And on that day, Halsey's role as a r/popheads meme was decided, once and for all. However, her baldness would be back to strike again...soon. SOON.

**Raykel** (9): I know. It seems dumb that her worst written song is the one of the highest scores I've given out of the songs from Badlands. But to be fair it's not like the other songs are well written anyway.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Another song popheads seems to hate. Again, I get it, but I'm not gonna participate in it. Despite some cringeworthy lyrics, I think the song sounds pretty good, and it's very very catchy. I remember rooting for this to do well in the Hot 100, before I realized I can't fucking stand Halsey.

**dropthehammer11** (8.5): The hook aside, this is a bop fr and people need to look past Biggie and Nirvana

**agentofscranton** (8): as cringe as the lyrics are, they don’t bother me as much as they do most people

**blueheart** (8): This song is way underrated. Yeah, the lyrics have a few odd.. choices, but the instrumental and her vocals more than make up for that.

**MashLuke** (8): Cringey? Yes. But it bops.

**PossumAloysuis** (7.5): Tumblr - the song

**shineflyer** (7.5): musically speaking this kicks ass, but I think you already know why I lowered the score.

**VeganSquash** (7.5): the verses are lit dont @ me

**awryj** (7.2): I like the "legal marijuana" part. It suits the new civilization theme and makes for a memorable line. fite me

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): EDGY

**fifthchevron** (7): All the comments are going to be "BIGGIE AND NIRVANA/LEGAL MARIJUANA!". It really does sound like a 90s mad libs activity that a kid born in 1999 took, thinking "This is MY generation!". Shame because everything aside from the lyrics is pretty awesome.

**nooodisaster** (7): me: okay this song is a bop, maybe i can get over the cringe lyrics. halsey: "what bubble gum have you been blowing lately?" me: nevermind.

**OxfordSemicolon** (7): BIG ON LEGAL HIGH NIRVANA

**timothy444** (7): I view this as a comedy song.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (6.5): aside from the cringe-inducing “legal marijuana” and the “raised on biggie and Nirvana” line, i think this song is just fine, nothing quite special aside from that admittedly catchy hook

**omni\_nomni** (6): i dont have the heart to give this anything lower than that

**SkyBlade79** (6): it’s not THAT bad, but it’s not good either. The outro is really nice

**TragicKingdom1** (6): This song is fairly controversial so the only thing I feel the need to weigh in on is the line "raised on Biggie and Nirvana." I actually think it works! It's somewhat cringy but it does represent the diversity of her own identity and by extension that of the millennial generation. Nearly every other lyric is embarrassing though.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Meme

**MrSwearword** (5): the lyrics fucking suck out loud, but the beat and song title “New Americana” actually fit Halsey very well.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): “People of Panem, we fight, we dare, we end our hunger for justice!” There‘s dead silence on the set. It goes on. And on. Finally, the intercom crackles and Haymitch‘s acerbic laugh fills the studio. He contains himself just long enough to say, “And that, my friends, is how a revolution dies.”

**lunasaflowers** (4.5): The production on the verses are really nice, but it kind of falls apart on the chorus, where both the instrumentals and vocals just sound...OFF. And yeah, the lyrics do reach kinda cringe territory on the chorus. "High on legal marijuana"? ...Edgy?

**spaghettibread** (4): bad but not as bad as advertised

**tooshorttoofast** (4): lyrics are very questionable but she mentions bad romance so +2 points

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (4): Ooooh boy. Probably Halsey’s most polarizing song, and it’s plain to see why. That chorus is NOT GOOD. It’s supposed to sound super anthemic and epic, and all she can come up with is legal drug use and listening to 90s music? Please girl. I like the queer representation in the second verse, but overall the song tries way too hard to be a rallying cry for millennials and it comes up woefully short.

**whatyourheartdesires** (3): it wasn't bad until that chorus

**frankiefrankiefrank** (2.5): I don't get why this is the hit from the album? It's like a parody song someone would use in a mockumentary about millennials.

**Mrachnie** (2): TFW you're raised on Biggie and Nirvana https://i.imgur.com/7ucST5w.jpg

**amumumyspiritanimal** (1): no. why is this a song even. ew.

**dirdbub** (1): this song is written and sounds like a 40 year old's think-piece on why the millennial generation is horrible

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): I’m not gonna give this song a zero, because honestly it doesn’t deserve that. This isn’t the worst song ever. I didn’t like this song or Halsey when it came out. I came around on Halsey. This song is still bad. This is the song people are referring to when people talk about Halsey trying too hard, she’s obnoxious on this track and pandering to a really gross crowd. There are some cool instrumental elements to it that Halsey would refine on her next album far more effectively. It has a gorgeous video that it didn’t really deserve, the production design and cinematography are wasted on a song that has nothing to do with the visuals.

**mustangs16** (1): wow an iconic relatable song!

**twat\_brained** (8.9): Okay, this hasn't aged too well and the "Juicy" interpolation somewhat takes away from the song's vibe, and the video is this weird mix of Lorde's "Team" video, the Apocalypse Now ending, as well as some The 100 thrown in there but overall I'm lost. I still love it though. UPDATE: I was initially gonna give this 7.3 but I couldn't find a song that I hated enough to give my 0 so I just picked this one bc everyone and I mean [EVERYONE]( https://twitter.com/halsey/status/876506700244824069) hates it and it's not gonna do well anyway. This isn't because I hate the song when it's quite the contrary I just simply don't wanna waste my 0 like I did in the 2016 EP rate. UPDATE #2: u/nfranklin50 convinced me that I don't need to give this a 0 so thanks boo. When I heard this I knew I was gonna stan Halsey after this; it was truly the push I needed after "Ghost" to really give her a special place in my heart. I know I'm in the minority but this song is too precious to me to slag off but hopefully it'll do something like bump it into the top 40 or maybe even 30.

**letsallpoo** (0): ["Halsey has a few prosaic turns of phrase...but it turns out everyone was right, and the chorus is dreadful. Not for the words, nor for Halsey’s snotty delivery, nor because Rihanna got there first, nor even because of the theory that it’s legal marijuana to appease radio censors; but because it’s the melodic equivalent of Impact type: impassive, there to make a statement, suitable for memes, and grating if it’s used for more than a few words."](http://www.thesinglesjukebox.com/?p=18384)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (0): I went back and forth between giving this a 0 or not, because as far as the song actually goes, it’s catchy. Halsey is good at writing something really catchy, even if it’s painfully generic, shallow, and pretentious. And god, does New Americana fit all those aspects. There’s a reason why this album is front and center at all vinyl displays at Urban Outfitters - it’s because the fucking song is literally the musical version of corporate distillation of thrift shops. There’s just so much to unpack here. For example, the lyrics are horrible. “Just what you’d expect inside her new Balenciaga/Viral mess, turned dreams into an empire” What the fuck is this? And I don’t even need to bring up the mess that is the chorus: “Raised on Biggie and Nirvana?” Arguably two of the most popular musicians of all time? Excuse me? The whole song has the same smugness that boardwalk t shirt stores have. Look how edgy and cool and alternative we are! NO ONE else is doing this. And that’s what New Americana is, and despite me finding the song catchy and the instrumental decent, if unfeeling, the message is so against everything I care about and executed in such a pretentious and righteous way I can’t deal with this fucking song. Fuck you bald bitch.

This song feels like such a outlier to the album. Up until this point every song has followed such a distinct vibe and then this song comes in with the most different production on the album and some of the worst and edgiest lyrics. This kinda makes my skin crawl but the pre chorus melody is so good.

**harmonyunoxx** (11): if she would have used she/her pronouns in this song this would have been the OG Halsey bisexual anthem (though I still see it as such) and I'm forever pissed that she kept he/him pronouns in it.

**awryj** (0): Yeah everybody wants to know how edgy you and your lover are Halsey

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): Wow so this lost me in the first two lines and it just kept plummeting from there. Basic af when it’s not unpleasant. She’s throwing in f-bombs trying to spice up an otherwise bland track. She goes for obvious, cheap non-rhymes, it’s not catchy, the production is a mess, her vocal performance is strained, and the lyrics are horrendous! “New Americana” at least has redeeming factors as a song, I can’t find anything to really like about this one.

---

**cyborglilith** (10): This is very good. VERY GOOD, Ashley. VERY GOOD.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): giving me major rocker Lana vibes. I love how Lido's production is either awful or amazing.

**dropthehammer11** (9): what kind of sink do they fuck on I need to know

**gannade** (9): catchy but these lyrics lmao. Oh halsey. oh well still a bop.

**blueheart** (8.5): Good chorus, bad verses.

**PossumAloysuis** (8.5): Pretty good. Hook is nice

**twat\_brained** (8.3): Okay, I'll admit, this song has problems, mostly the repetitive lyrics and Halsey abusing the f-bomb here but it went hard as hell live.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): it was one of least favorites at first, i thought the verses seemed kinda lazy but now i can get through them to enjoy the pre-chorus and chorus, even if its a complete rip of born to die lol

**MashLuke** (8): "Everybody wants to know; If we fucked on the bathroom sink" well, I do

**mirandacrocsgrove** (8): surprisingly, i don’t have any problem with how “edgy” she sounds when cursing in here

**shineflyer** (8): a lot of this song's appeal comes from strategic F-bombs, and Kanye fucked on the sink first, but I'm still loving this track.

**spaghettibread** (7.9): pretty good weak chorus

**lunasaflowers** (7.8): I...like this much more than I remember, wow. I love that low guitar(?) on the verses, and the lower voice Halsey's using here is pleasant to listen to. There's some cringy lines here and there, though, and the swearing is...kinda gratuitous.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Pretty edgy, but also pretty enjoyable.

**timothy444** (7.5): "I said the f word am i cool yet? I said it again am i cool now? how about now?

**zamomattel** (7.5): This is a highlight but the whole theme is still so unoriginal

**blue\_charles** (7): personally, I ike the dirty, gritty edge of this, but it does wear thin rather quickly. And Halsey talking about how "everyone wants to know if we fucked on the bathroom sink" is a little... much.

**MrSwearword** (7): the singing is great for Halsey, but after the first verse, the beat changes from sex-ridden guitars to the twinkly ambience that is mainly hit or miss as hell.

**SkyBlade79** (7): Bad start, but the rest is good. I love the instrumentation during the chorus, and she sounds so fierce!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This one is pretty catchy, but I can’t get over how badass Halsey thinks she is by dropping F bombs for days. We get it Halsey. You want that parental advisory sticker. Whatever.

**theNealCutter** (7): SHOW DON'T TELL. DON'T EXPLAIN SHIT HALSEY. I LIKE THE SONG BUT YOU REALLY HAD TO ADD THE "THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THE SECRET" HOOK RIGHT? I FUCKING UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. NOT TO MENTION HOW IS SOUNDS LIKE LANA DEL REY'S BORN TO DIE.

**nooodisaster** (6): Yep, I'm gonna kinkshame Halsey.

**Raykel** (6): The chorus sounded like it was going somewhere amazing but then it tripped on its own ass.

**tooshorttoofast** (6): ok girl keep ur secrets we don’t wanna know them anyway

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5.5): I like the chorus, but the verses bring the song down a lot.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (5.5): The instrumental has a nice amount of grit during the verses, but gives way to more blandness during the chorus. And some of these lyrics… Yikes.

**mokitsu** (5): filler, i never listened in full.

**strawberryswing1** (5): that opening verse...throwaway hit the nail on the head

**Elitefourbrad** (4): Halsey what were you thinking with this song girl? I still sort of bop to it, but eh.

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): What awful lyrics. Out of all the mediocre songwriting on this album this probably takes the cake. The first verse alone makes me feel genuinely embarrassed for her. The fact that the person who wrote this eventually wrote queer anthems like Bad at Love and Strangers makes me scratch my head, because the line about fucking in the bathroom sink and chainsmoking until three is...WAIT! HOLY SHIT! CHAINSMOKING?! HALSEY IS A PROPHET. OH MY GOD. OH MY FUCKING GOD

**Mrachnie** (3.5): Oh for fuck's sake Halsey. This is one of my favourite instrumentals, but the lyrics are... ...well... "Everybody wants to know if we fucked on the bathroom sink" NO HALSEY WE DON'T!!!

**dirdbub** (3): is this supposed to be the lesbian song? I think it's supposed to be the lesbian song. too bad it sucks

**ImADudeDuh** (2): Alternate title: Halsey learns how to curse

**chipsi1** (1): this is awful. possibly one of the edgiest tracks in an album that already has way too much edge.

**fifthchevron** (1): I don't think anyone cares that much about your love life, Halsey. She's not famous enough for this to be convincing.

**VeganSquash** (1): i actually dont want to know if you fucked on the bathroom sink

**Mrachnie** (9): This song is like a better version of 'Stars'. It sounds very dramatic without sounding fake and the chorus is actually good, which seems to be a rarity on this album.

**theNealCutter** (9): that multitracking works so well to make a smooth atmosphere. although, a little too smooth that I wish it was a little more raw and flawed. i wish they swapped Stars and Overdose with this one. It does the raw and broken aspect of Overdose, and Stone does the appreciation ballad better than Stars.

**timothy444** (9): What an emotional rollercoaster!

**jamesfog** (8): Kinda reminds me of "Apologize". The backing vocals definitely add to the song.

**spaghettibread** (8): alright

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): A good piano ballad! She's done it!

**twat\_brained** (7.8): This sounds nice but I don't feel like Alessia's delivering the necessary emotion required to carry the song.

**zamomattel** (7.5): the piano is pretty but the metaphor of a river of tears is..... reductive

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): Jar Of Hearts tho 🤔

**awryj** (7): The best ballad on the record. The lyrics aren't clunky and the melody is pretty.

**blue\_charles** (7): I'm 100% here for the bitter as fuck combo of regret, anger, and sadness that Alessia serves here.

**MashLuke** (7): if this had a faster instrumental it'd be better. It's a nice song anyway

**nooodisaster** (7): Justin Timberlake found dead.

**SkyBlade79** (7): too long. That being said, it’s not too bad. The lyrics are either really good (love sinks and hope floats) or really bad (I’ll cry myself a wishing well)

**dropthehammer11** (6.5): An improvement from the other ballads, still a tad dry

**strawberryswing1** (6.5): i love the piano here but "river of tears" is so cliche.

**therokinrolla** (6.3): boring

**AbnormalPopPunk** (6): i mean... of the ballads on this album, its the best, but its still not that good.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Shockingly, this is a breakup song I find too melodramatic. I get that that’s the point, she's intentionally dabbling in over the top metaphors because that's what you do in a grief stricken situation like a breakup, but it’s almost cartoonishly over the top. It’s a caricature, and not a particularly good one.

**harmonyunoxx** (6): I never listen to Know-It-All's bonus tracks so that's why they have the lowest songs, but since I have seen videos of her play this song live before I like this bonus track more.

**mokitsu** (5.5): boring ballad, zzzzz....

**ComeOnAndSlang** (5): forgettable

**dirdbub** (5): cry me a river cry me a river cry me a river cry me a river you know that they say some things are better left unsaid it wasn't like you only talk

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): I think this is the most forgettable song on this album. I don't really remember how it goes. From what I can recall, it wasn't bad, but it didn't do anything the ballads on this album didn't do already.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (4.7): Bonus track time! This song's not amazing, but I'd rather have it be the piano-only ballad on the standard album over "Stars." Took away a point because the over-produced backup vocals sound weird and distract from the song.

**chipsi1** (4.5): Meh, Alessia really doesn't pull this off well, the fact that she doesn't have experience with the situation she's singing about is a pretty noticeable flaw and it makes the song feel much less genuine than it's supposed to feel.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): Facebook .com person who can make a song this fucking boring

**cyborglilith** (3): has meaning but I can't bop to it so it deserves a low score

**Elitefourbrad** (3): She’s crying a river after hearing Justin Timberlake's hit song.

**MrSwearword** (3): wait a minute, didn’t she JUST do a piano ballad with limited pleasantness on “Stars”?

**mustangs16** (3): this is...quite cringe-y, wow

This is probably my favorite song on the album. I love the glitch effects and just how sinister it sounds. If you can even say it about a Halsey song this is the song just feels so and I respect it a lot for that. It perfectly combines the quiet and the sinister themes on this album to make a great song. 

---

**spaghettibread** (0): more like young GARBAGE

**TragicKingdom1** (0): halsey complains about being taken seriously but has a song called "young god" unironically

---
**lunasaflowers** (10): NGL, I love this for very similar reasons as I do Control. I think it's one of the songs that best epitomises what Badlands is going for, and it feels concise, which works in its favour.

**VeganSquash** (10): gives me chills.

**twat\_brained** (9.7): I love how raw this sound is and how dark the sound gets, Halsey sounds excellent on here. I don't claim the strange distortion at the start of the song though.

**PossumAloysuis** (9.5): Hurry up with my damn croissants

**blue\_charles** (9): I just really like the question of "do you feel like a young god?"

**Elitefourbrad** (9): “You want to go to heaven, but you’re a human tonight”. I picture myself running down the street, wind through the hair on a crisp fall morning. Shots were fired down by that church where we used to meet, I can’t go back there no more. I can help you go to heaven though, all you have to do is fuck me.

**SkyBlade79** (9): I love that glitchy production, and the lyrics are really hard hitting.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): Another good song. Not sure why three of the best songs in the album are hidden behind the filler.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): If you wanna go to heaven you should fuck me tonight

**MashLuke** (8): She's a young goddess

**Mrachnie** (8): I really like it when Halsey actually tries to tell the story in her songs instead of talking about how special she is.

**mokitsu** (7.5): filler-ish!

**awryj** (7): Not very exceptional lyrically, but I like the ambient vibe. I think I'd like it more without the vocals (no shade....?)

**patronsaintofaspies** (7):  [MUSES] Bless my soul, Herc was on a roll/Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll/What a pro!

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.7): The production is a lot more understated on the song which I think fits the melody. The second half of the album was starting to go down hill, so at least this is interesting if nothing else. Still trying to figure out how I feel about the second verse haha.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This is kind of a nice track, but the verses are terrible and the chorus is not strong enough to carry it through. She’s trying way too hard here, and the cold, industrial production feels more like it’s an obligation rather than a good choice.

**Raykel** (6): "He says, 'Oh baby girl, don't get cut on my edges' / 'my tongue is a weapon' / 'if you wanna go to heaven you should fuck me tonight.'" Was she dating the lead singer of Blood on the Dance Floor?

**tooshorttoofast** (6): a lot of her choruses just sound like extensions of the verses… also I don’t really like when artists drop f-bombs unless there's a good reason for it

**mirandacrocsgrove** (5.7): wtf is a yung god

**shineflyer** (5.5): it's still good shit, but it feels a little bit more generic than other tracks.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (5): I don't like this song. It tries to be edgy and use the same aesthetic as Lana, but it lacks Lana's delivery. You can't believe that she is really meaning the things she sings about in this song, even if they are true.

**chipsi1** (5): this was honestly very cool and fun to listen until she decided to add a ton of edge into the song in the middle of it and then it got really bad

**nooodisaster** (5): It's so weird to listen to this album after hopeless fountain kingdom. Like girl, this boy is not good for you.

**theNealCutter** (5): eh.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): “There's a light in the crack that's separating your thighs. And if you wanna go to heaven you should fuck me tonight.” I literally have no words.

**dirdbub** (3): sure, cool, whatever. this song is just there. not good but it's there I'm still pissed at Control for existing

**cyborglilith** (1): lmao this is trash

**MrSwearword** (1): I didn’t like it with Lana on “Gods and Monsters” and I don’t like it here.

It’s a cute little piano ballad but this is so very much not for me. It’s sad and seductive but man does his voice hold him back from making this really great

---

**MashLuke** (0): "So I take a sip, wait 'til it hits; That liquid guilt is on my lips; I'm wasted on you". Sorry but... no

---
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): This goes hard while being depressing as fuck. My favorite combo.

**dirdbub** (9): such killer production on this album

**PossumAloysuis** (9): Another nice track. The guitar at the end is great

**theNealCutter** (9): LOST BOY but actually not bitchy and the melodrama fits the narrative well. although I do understand why this is left out as it's too sad and doesn't fit the sonics the rest of the songs.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): I heard the piano at the start and thought it was "Praying"🤣🤣Also I don't know what the guitar is doing there at the end, it's not like he's Prince or anything.

**awryj** (8): It's a really good track (the only one I genuinely liked tbh), but it won't win because it's a ballad

**blue\_charles** (8): this is like a getting drunk at 2 AM after a messy hookup you regret type song and that's a vibe I can get behind.

**cyborglilith** (8): wow this is actually good

**enecks** (8): I regret rating the drake song of the same name so low. Did I really give that bop my 0?

**fifthchevron** (8): The production is unreal. It's like an EDM symphony??

**SkyBlade79** (8): a bit repetitive, but the production is too good

**frankiefrankiefrank** (7): Standard piano ballad that turns into a Lana reject. It's good, but also the closest thing to filler on a great album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I can’t believe it, Troye made electric guitar solos gay. He did that, for us.

**MrSwearword** (7): only because it builds up to something with production and that’s a good thing considering most of this album is just…so unrealized.

**nooodisaster** (7): It's filler.

**Mrachnie** (6): Why does this album have so many trap instrumentals? I would giive this an 8 if the snares weren't there because it's a dramatic piano ballad and i love me a dramatic piano ballad.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Ugh, I can't remember this one either. Putting two ballads next to each other doesn't always work and it really doesn't in this case. See my comment for Blue.

**Raykel** (6): He has a nice voice, but it's not interesting enough to carry a ballad. Thank god the production carries the second half.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I forgot how meh the last part of the album gets. This track is pretty slow and ballady and I don’t really find it all that compelling.

**shineflyer** (5.5): not THAT good

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (5.5): Pretty mediocre ballad tbh. There are some cool instrumental ideas, but nothing really coheres into a memorable beat.

**spaghettibread** (5): forgettable and boring but not awful

**tooshorttoofast** (5): only filler-like song on the album

**VeganSquash** (5): LOWKEY UNDERWHELMING SONG. IM WHELMED

**Elitefourbrad** (3): This album is anything from too good.

**zamomattel** (3): Drake & Rihanna outsold

**mokitsu** (2): troye sivan doesnt have the vocals to pull a piano ballad.

BADLANDS: Probably the most inconsistent/messy in quality, and yet this is probably gonna be the album out of these I'll actually return to the most. Also this rate is gonna kill me because the songs I was less favourable to on this album are the popheads faves, I think.

Know-It-All: Pleasant, Alessia has a lovely voice, but not a whole lot of huge standouts. Not half bad though.

Blue Neighbourhood: Good mood album, some really crisp production, but I'm not sure how much I'll return to the whole thing. I liked it though.

I’m gonna be honest I never noticed how pretentious this song was until I read everyone’s comments. Yeah this is peak pretention but I don’t think it’s on purpose. Just like with Here I think this song is meant to be self-empowering without putting down anyone else and it’s kinda ambiguous if it does that or not. Either way I still really like it and at least for me the message is really powerful.

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): STYB but its actually good

**spaghettibread** (9.5): cool

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9): ok ok ok ok ok OK a BOP

**cyborglilith** (9): actually a bop

**PossumAloysuis** (9): This sounds like the song that plays during a montage a middle schooler makes when a friend is moving or theie class is graduating.

**mirandacrocsgrove** (8.2): sounds a little like an unpolished demo at times but it’s ok I guess

**twat\_brained** (8.2): I'll be honest, this one I'm listening to but I find it hard to follow along because her songs are starting to sound really similar.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This song contradicts itself and this ends up exemplifying many of the issues that plagued the album as a whole: Alessia is selling herself as this sort of hipster counterculturist bucking against the norms of society and fighting against a world trying to put her in a box, but musically the song doesn’t reflect that. It’s about her not wanting to write just a typical song, but it’s honestly kind of basic. She specifically says that she wants her lyrics to speak for her and then the next line is that apocryphal “good girls don’t make history” quote you see plastered on people’s Facebooks. There’s nothing particularly daring or experimental or revolutionary about it, (even just compared to other songs on the album) she’s not living up to the standards she’s setting up for herself. However the song also exemplifies the strengths of the album too: despite the negative it’s still a lovely little song that’s very easy to listen to. The highlights of the song are the liberal usage of ad libs and counterpoint, which can be a little messy at times, but in her own words all contribute to a “harmonious design.” And, for all of her bluster she shows vulnerability that feels earnest and meaningful (and to her literal credit she does have the lead writing credit on every song on the album, meaning that these really are her songs) and the message is very touching in its own way. A lot of people complain that her music can be loud and obnoxious, but in this song she’s saying that she doesn’t care if people feel that way because her songs are real to her and she’s not going to tone that down for everyone else, and there’s something that I admire about that. Whether you like it or not, she is an artist who has put out an album, and this is her way of commemorating the mark she’s left on the world, for better or for worse.

**theNealCutter** (8): It sounds kinda old tbh. like it came from 2010 or something.

**tooshorttoofast** (8): great way to end the album

**therokinrolla** (7.5): cute

**blue\_charles** (7): A good, pure, hopeful bop.

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Okay good this album is over.

**MrSwearword** (7): at least the album ends better than I thought it would.

**nooodisaster** (7): I like this. "Good girls don't make history."

**OxfordSemicolon** (7): The best of the slower songs on the album, but still disappointing as a closer.

**dropthehammer11** (6): Decent little tune, nothing special tho

**MashLuke** (6): "Don't want your hooks or auto-tune" how dare you talk shit about king Quavo?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I’m not even gonna do the meme format for this last song I’m just so goddamn sick of this album this song is okay and it sounds nice and I like the instrumental but it was a pain to get through

**zamomattel** (6): Man in the mirror and I Was Here are shook

**awryj** (5): The production here is kind of messy

**mokitsu** (5): this song is messy, and it's an underwhelming closer.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): This is also kind of boring. It's a shame that the bonus ballads on Know-It-All aren't very memorable. Also, My Song 5 was robbed last April (?).

**frankiefrankiefrank** (4.3): Boring and anyone could have sung it. I'm starting to notice that she uses the same rhythmic flow in a lot of her melodies.

**fifthchevron** (4): I'll be interested to see how she carries her opinions on through her music as she gets older.

**shineflyer** (4): there were a lot of better tracks on the album they could have used as a closing track

**dirdbub** (2.5): I can't connect this to any other songs, I'm just bored with this album. can someone please end this

**Mrachnie** (2): Oh god. The preachy Alessia is back. The verses actually have okay lyrics but the chorus makes her seem like such a pretentious asshole.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (2): This sounds like she took all the bad elements from every song in the album and put them together and it's just really fucking bad.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): Ice cold baby I told ya i'm ice cold

**zamomattel** (10): I think this is pretty relatable because I'm pretty cool. Jk but this does actually remind me of my relationship with someone so i love it

**tooshorttoofast** (9): another excellent song

**VeganSquash** (9): TROPICAL BOP, BUT IT WAS A BIT EMPTY

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I'd love to be as cool as this song is.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.6): Troye's voice has an inherently sensual quality to it, and he plays it up the most on this song, which really helps sell it. This song kinda veers off from the story of the album, and I should care about that, but I don't because it's a good song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): There’s a lot of subtlety in this track. Troye sounds almost excited at the start and his explanation of what being cool is is very straightforward, but as he actually delves into it as the song progresses he realizes how hollow it is. However he never outright denounces it, if anything he sounds upset that he’s not satisfied by it. He’s not saying these people aren’t cool, or that he’s cooler than them, he’s basically rejecting the label of coolness and dealing with the consequences of that. Yes he’s being himself and not falling into the pit of emptiness, but as a result he can’t fit in anymore.

**MrSwearword** (8): could use a little more pizzazz or something in its favor, but I can live with this.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I think people underrate this song a bit. I've been to fancy resorts places a few times to watch musicals, and I get what Troye's trying to say here. I can try to get people's attention and impress them with my wicked taste or the fact that I watched Sound of Music live or something (I kid, please don't do that) but whenever I go to see theatre I end up being intimidated by the things this song describes. The culture shock is too much for me, speaking as a lower middle-class queer teenager.

**SkyBlade79** (8): interesting lyrics

**theNealCutter** (8): better than Cool Kids by Echosmith. the understated vocals plays the shy and coy boy, perfectly suiting the theme of the song.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (8): This song is called “COOL” and that is a very fitting title. The instrumental is very sleek and sexy and Troye’s delivery on the track oozes cool as well. Not much else to say about this song except it’s great!

**MashLuke** (7): Troye Sivan sounds like Marlboro Lights

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Not really the most interesting track here. I like the guitar work, and it is really fun, but it’s not really something I come back to often when I replay this record.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): One of the weaker songs on the album for me, it kind of half-goes for an R&B vibe but doesn't flesh it out at all. Also I think the xylophone or whatever at the bridge is too weak. Good melody props it up.

**Mrachnie** (6.1): Oh look, it's a "materialism is BAAAD" song. I just can't help but wonder why everyone seems to make these ever since "Royals" became a hit. It's also boring.

**dirdbub** (6): not much to say here so another tweet: http://40.media.tumblr.com/90459ce50d485842d64d9933f84f3d43/tumblr_ng9d2wWfpV1to0d59o9_500.png

**fifthchevron** (6): Funky but doesn't really go anywhere.

**nooodisaster** (6): Zzzz

**shineflyer** (6): there's cool elements here, but it feels too muddy to wow me.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): This just feels significantly less emotional/meaningful than the rest of the album. Maybe it's the upbeat tempo that doesn't really fit with the message of it. Or maybe it just doesn't sound good enough when you listen to if after the masterpiece that is TALK ME DOWN.

**awryj** (5.8): This could've been a cool funky song, but it's only an okay funky-ish song. It's alright I guess.

**cyborglilith** (5): meh

**spaghettibread** (5): daya is better

**Elitefourbrad** (4): I want to be cool, but listening to this song is not cool.

Troye delivering again with more great production and more edm flavored this time around. It’s a nice song but honestly if Troye himself wasn’t on the song I wouldn’t mind one bit

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): My moody teen self still relates to this song hard, and I put on this song whenever any little inconvenience happens between me and a person. Never had a romantic relationship but it makes me feel things. Can't hate this song.

**cyborglilith** (10): wig has been found in orbit

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Ooooooh I'm loving the keyboard on this track, and the drop in the chorus! The production on this whole album is immaculate tbh, and his lyrics have a sense of urgency that capture the drama of being young.

**MashLuke** (10): This is really good. The vibe this song has it's incredible and I love his voice in this song a lot

**shineflyer** (10): this song is heartbreaking. I'm feeling teary writing this on my first proper listen.

**twat\_brained** (10): I remember listening to this and it being one of my favorites from the album back when I first heard it.

**blueheart** (9.5): This song is good. I have bad memories associated with this song, so it's somewhat hard to listen to.

**dirdbub** (9.5): I have nothing to say for this song, here's an old tweet: http://assets.pop-buzz.com/2016/35/troye-sivan-tweets-1472551561.png

**gannade** (9): this pseudo dub step moody atmospheric production is FIRE

**PossumAloysuis** (9): Getting serious Neon Indian vibes from this, which means it's great

**SkyBlade79** (9): like most troye tracks, it is production carried, but damn, that production is good

**tooshorttoofast** (9): perfectly captures the moment when you’re drifting apart from someone dear to you

**nooodisaster** (8): I'm such a sucker for the production on this album, like it can seriously do no wrong.

**theNealCutter** (8): i love how he still sings after the drop.

**banananaise** (7.5): this is cool but in an 'H&M background music' kind of cool

**chipsi1** (7.5): the production is really good on this.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): There’s a lot of potential in this track. The lyrics are good and hard hitting, the instrumental is really cool, but there’s just something off about this track. It feels repetitive despite actually featuring a lot of shifts and variation? I think it’s that drop, it’s not bad but it consumes the rest of the song somehow.

**Mrachnie** (7.5): Ok i'm not a huge fan of the sing-talking over this glitch-soul (?) instrumental he does on the verses, but he actually sings for once on the chorus and that giant synth is just so satisfying.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): Nice pre-chorus-drop but not a fan of the sing-talking.

**dropthehammer11** (7): The production on this is very slick

**enecks** (7): weird beat "everyone subscribed to troye's main channel like: anything hurts less than the quiet"

**mirandacrocsgrove** (7): this is where the heavily production driven album starts to sound a bit tired

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I'm not sure if I like what they're doing with the bass here. The melody is interesting, and it's a nice diversion from the previous songs, but I'm pretty sure almost all of us can agree that it's a tad too much obnoxious. A bit of a disappointment-we switched from easy listening to something that's hard on the ears. I still like this more than some people do, though.

**Raykel** (7): It sounds nice but it's confusing. Like it starts off sounding like a lullaby then it gets intense out of nowhere and then has a crazy drop. These could've been 2 separate songs.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Another EP track, although this one isn’t my favorites. I like the buildup here a lot more than I like the payoff, but it’s hard to deny it’s a good track. I just feel like it hypes up something a little more massive than what we get, but the verses are really solid.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): Doesn't quite hold up with the previous songs, but it also doesn't really lower the quality of the album.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (7): Another good one! Nothing special, but Troye conveys the frustration from a romantic partner very well. Troye does the electro-pop sound very well!

**awryj** (6): Good background music. Like, I would expect it to be played in a fancy shop.

**lunasaflowers** (6): I like the subject matter, but the production feels a bit scattershot, for lack of a better word.

**OxfordSemicolon** (6): The verses are OK; the chorus isn't.

**fifthchevron** (5): If only the verses were as lively as the chorus.

**spaghettibread** (5): what is this

**zamomattel** (5): the intro reminds me of Roses by Kanye & the 'chorus' reminds me of like The Chainsmokers or some other shit

**mokitsu** (3.5): generic edm song, not my thing, sorry!

**ImADudeDuh** (3): Jesus this is a disjointed mess of a song

**MrSwearword** (3): yeah, sure expression is better than repression but when the beat does more work than the artist, it pisses me off greatly.

**VeganSquash** (1.5): THE POP DROP WAS ANNOYING AF

**Elitefourbrad** (1): Taylor Swift’s 8 seconds of quiet white noise had more success than Troye ever will in his entire career.

Just a really fun doo woppy song. It’s dreamy and frankly I think the horns are gorgeous. I don’t really get the Meghan Trainor comparisons but more power to you guys I guess

---
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): this song is cute. i enjoy it. it is cute.

**blueheart** (10): This reminds me of Amy Winehouse in the verses and I'm so here for it.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): Better than Bonnie & Clyde

**spaghettibread** (10): also I c o n I c

**strawberryswing1** (9): Damn this is so jazzy.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Lost points because I’m tired of Bonnie and Clyde references, there’s nothing romantic about getting shot up. Other than that, the lyrics to this one are pretty cute, if a little bit twee. She stretches the metaphor a bit too thin, even for my taste, but the bouncy throwback melody of this song is irresistible.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (8): Nice bop. Nothing big though, based on the title, I thought this would be more exciting.

**dirdbub** (8): @futurebf please rob a bank with me

**Elitefourbrad** (8): HOLY SHIT THAT SAXOPHONE! This makes me want to be rebellious and go rob stores and banks. I wish I was a cool outlaw with Alessia.

**lunasaflowers** (8): The piano and horns and Alessia all sound great here! This song is just really cute and warm.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Really nice jazzy song from Alessia here, and I'm pretty sure it's the first song about a specific relationship on the album. Queen of outlaws. Jean Valjean who? Han Solo who? Team Rocket who?

**theNealCutter** (8): i love how this is a best friend song. the stark piano, the horns, and the fragmented beats works so much with Alessia's vocals. that doo wop inspired backing vocals are amazing too.

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): I like the old school V I B E given here. A cute song for sure

**mokitsu** (7.5): a cute bop!

**nooodisaster** (7.5): This is just filler, but I'm such a sucker for her voice.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (7.5): A cute bop!

**zamomattel** (7.5): I just don't believe that Alessia Cara is doing all these bad things, I just can't get into it

**blue\_charles** (7): invented crime and saxophones

**OxfordSemicolon** (7): I'm not usually a fan of retraux music, but this one isn't too tacky.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): It's a decent song. The message feels similar to Here, but without the effect of it.

**therokinrolla** (7): its a basic bop. Its fine, and i enjoy the sound of it, but there really isnt much to say

**tooshorttoofast** (7): cute song

**twat\_brained** (6.3): Interesting use of 3/4 time here, you don't see that much in pop. It doesn't do a great deal to redeem an otherwise filler song, though.

**Mrachnie** (6): First filler track? This song feels very underwritten and it's not memorable at all. It's not UNPLEASANT to listen to tho, unlike some of the filler on the other two albums.

**awryj** (4): This song is about being partners in crime and yet it sounds like insurance commercial music

**cyborglilith** (3): Shouldn't she put her actually good songs first and leave the filler for last?

**shineflyer** (2): these are the most well mannered criminals i've ever heard

**SkyBlade79** (2): mediocre production, boring lyrics…

**VeganSquash** (2): generic

---

**bwc222** (8): this sounds like a meghan trainor outtake tbh

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8): It does the doo-wop thing in a way that feels fresh/modern and avoids pastiche. Meghan Trainor, please take notes!

**jamesfog** (8): Cue the Meghan Trainor comparisons.

**timothy444** (7): This would be a great Meghan Trainor song!

**MashLuke** (6): Dear Future Husband make me... oops wrong lyrics, pardon my manners

**MrSwearword** (6): Meghan Trainor called, she wants her 50s doo-wop back.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): hey siri how do i make a meghan trainor track

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): Production is too close to Meghan Trainor's for comfort.

**banananaise** (5): this is some meghan trainor level instrumental

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): This track is like the 400 Lux of this record, just much less poetic, more sappy-and-in-love plus it almost sounds TOO happy, idk. And the sax is prominent but not in a good way, it's more AATB than RAWM (sorry ghost quartet)

The last of the three song run of songs that aren’t 10’s on badlands. This one is fine and it’s fun and moody but It doesn’t necessarily do anything for me

---
**cyborglilith** (10): 👻👻Beyonce is shook 👻👻

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Halsey is queen of Halloween. The dreary production goes hand in hand with the amazing vocals from Halsey.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): For me, the best track on the album. Halsey’s lyrics are pretty on point here, and I like how she romanticizes the idea of wanting to be tortured by memories of your ex, in some sort of weird twisted way. Even if they can’t be together, she can’t bear the thought of her life without them in some capacity so she’s willing to deal with even the torture of a ghost. The song plays well to her harsh yet weak vocals and the production is very tight.

**MrSwearword** (10): this does read as ambition that Halsey can actually tackle which took me by surprise.

**VeganSquash** (10): underrated bop

**zamomattel** (10): The best non-single but I'm not sure how much of that is the hauorrr bit in the chorus

**mokitsu** (9.5): this is one of my recent faves, i wrote it off for so long. the pre-chorus and the chorus are excellent.

**SkyBlade79** (9.5): I love how it’s pretty chill, and the production is totally amazing.

**twat\_brained** (9.4): The progression and overall flow of the song does wonders for it, and it allows Halsey to sound really good! One of Halsey's more underrated tunes imo

**Kaylaboe** (9): hauntingly heaven

**mirandacrocsgrove** (9): a standout on the latter part of the album

**PossumAloysuis** (9): I don't have a corny joke for this one. I'm fucking with it tho. Love the spacy production

**shineflyer** (8.5): this is THE coolest vocal slicing

**awryj** (8.2): So far this is my favorite song on Badlands. The intro is a bit too long I guess but other than that it's very cohesive, the lyrics are very poetic and it's simply a good song.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): the "haaaaauuuun-ting" echo makes it for me

**dropthehammer11** (8): Crazy ass beat. Whoever exec produced this is my father

**lunasaflowers** (8): In a weird way, there's something almost...southern gothic about the pace and tone of this song! Really like its sound, although I hate the weird noises at the beginning.

**MashLuke** (8): This is more like a filler but it's still nice

**nooodisaster** (8): It has good momentum, and I actually feel emotion in this??

**timothy444** (8): Keyboards have nothing to do with a haunting. Wtf halsey. The instrumental tone of this is fitting though so I'll give credit to that

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I have no idea what to give this, because every time I try to remember what this song consists of I remember that it's good but I can't remember how it goes past the chorus. So, how about a decent 7? I guess?

**tooshorttoofast** (7): dark and chill bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): A solid, if forgettable track. Like, really forgettable. I had to listen to this a few times just so I could figure out what to type about it as I kept zoning out. I like the spacey atmosphere but again, Halsey’s presence is pretty middling here.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5.3): Eh it's kinda boring and sounds like a mishmash of a bunch of other songs I've heard in this vein.

**OxfordSemicolon** (5): She pronounces "haunting" so unclearly at first I thought the line in the chorus was just "I'm begging you to keep on."

**theNealCutter** (5): I FUCKING HATE HALSEY.

**WhenYouHaveArrived** (5): The intro sounds promising, but once again, the song gives way to more bland, washed out electro pop fluff.

**Mrachnie** (4): The edgines is back as i almost expected the album to get better. My hatred for one-phrase choruses doesen't help me in appreciating the song either.

**chipsi1** (3): I really hate her voice on this.

**dirdbub** (2.5): I'm trying to make interesting and constructive comments with this album, but goddamn this song is testing me because I literally cannot believe that this entire album is like this even after my fourth listen. I just keep on coming back to it in disbelief, like "wow, an album is that boring!"

**amumumyspiritanimal** (2): I'm surprised that this wasn't produced by Lido, because it's just as bad as Castle and New Americana production-wise.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (1.5): I don't even know how this made the album.

**spaghettibread** (1): ew

Drug and love references are so over done in pop music but for some reason this song has never bothered me. It’s loud and sweet song that in my opinion does its job well. It works in the drug references without having them be bad or exhausting.

---
**enecks** (10): Trying to get a bop The bops are taking control Stuck in the bopping zone I'm just bopping alone My bopping game is strong way too bop to be wrong caught up in your bop yeah at least I bop it was a bop it was a bop it was a boppy boplusion

**jamesfog** (10): Now here's what I needed! The non-conventional beat makes the song for me, and her vocals in the chorus are a highlight!

**omni\_nomni** (10): first alessia cara song i ever heard and i still love it

**spaghettibread** (10): PERFECTION

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): A certified bop, with one of her best vocal performances in this album.

**twat\_brained** (9.5): I never really caught onto this song when I first heard it but after hearing it all the way through for the first time I can see its appeal.

**timothy444** (9): "I find myself constantly surprised that the album fillers are better than the actual singles that were released from it! For example, this song just speaks volumes!"

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Finally, a good slut drop.

**PossumAloysuis** (8.5): Love the crashing percussion.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): i forgot how much i love this song wow i havent listened to it since the album came out

**awryj** (8): I guess this kind of sound compliments Alessia's voice the most. The production is a bit messy at times but I like it anyway.

**dropthehammer11** (8): This production, wow

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Not sure how I feel about drug metaphors in pop; I feel uneasy for similar reasons with Clean, but Clean is such a good song. This is still a catchy track, and it's pretty good, but I just want to put that there. Other than that, I really enjoy it, just like the other jazzy songs on this album.

**therokinrolla** (8): my biggest problem here is that in a cute album of adolescence, innocence, and youth there is a random song thrown in here called overdose. Man that quick change of pace gave me whiplash. I mean she obviously isnt singing about drugs but somehow it really doesnt fit

**Raykel** (7.5): Ok I was ready to go to sleep but I gotta admit the chorus punched me awake.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7): its a good song but not really on par with the rest of the album

**MashLuke** (7): this song sounds like a bodybuilder dancing ballet. I do get that roller coaster feeling though, cool instrumental

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): good day ask.com strong emotional motivational teen pop song

**theNealCutter** (7): BEAT OVERDOSE. not that it's bad... it just feels so filler. Emphasizes too much on the beat to highlight the melody. too bad because she was singing her heart out on this one. also weird placement. I'M NOT GONNA ACCEPT THAT THE I'M YOURS BOO THAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT BEFORE HURT HER BECAUSE I WILL HUNT DOWN THAT TRIFLING ASS BITCH AND WILL NAIL HIS HEAD ON TO THE WALL BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONLY THAT MADE HER LOVE AGAIN BUT HE BROKE HER HEART AND SHE DESERVES LOVE AND NOBODY EVER HAS THE RIGHT TO HURT ANYONE

**tooshorttoofast** (7): chorus gets a bit grating

**banananaise** (6.5): the percussion-only chorus part is lame and kills all the song's momentum

**zamomattel** (6.5): This is quite boring. You know what is a bop though, Overdose by Ciara like wow listen to it right now.

**blue\_charles** (6): A likable, if a little unoriginal bop

**mokitsu** (6): generic ballad, could do without it!

**Mrachnie** (6): I have seen many Alessia fans say this is their fav from Know-It-All and i just don't get it. The vocal melody on the line "oh and i overdose" is just annoying and the lyrics are lacking.

**shineflyer** (6): It's nice - lots of cool harmonies, and it's in 6/8 time, which is always a nice change of pace.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (5.8): The beat on this song is cool in the first verse until they crank it up for the chorus. Soaring pop anthems are not her forte as a writer or artist in general.

**Elitefourbrad** (5): Katy Perry did the random drums in a song better with power.

**OxfordSemicolon** (5): "Hallucino - gen" is bad.

**VeganSquash** (5): generic, but much better then Outlaws

**ComeOnAndSlang** (4): no tHanks

**dirdbub** (4): there's nothing special about this song besides the complete ass fuckery that is the chorus' instrumental. this song does NOT work with a melody/harmony mute, it makes the whole thing uncomfortable in a bad way

**MrSwearword** (4): I don’t think I can “overdose” on anything this monotonous.

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Unquestionably the worst song on the album. I don’t usually get annoyed too much by cliches, but this is such a painfully on the nose take on “love=drug” songs. The production on this track is all over this place, it’s super messy, I have no clue what the drums are doing half of the time and there are a lot of unnecessary background vocals that contribute to this this salad of sounds that’s really unpleasant. The lyrics are pretty bad too. I do like the actual melody of the chorus, but they should have kept the synth running throughout more of the song more prominently and reduced the drums, this song somehow blends minimalism and maximalism to create a mess. Disappointing.

scoutfincher: *gets mad that Haunting was out on the first day even though I didn't participate in the rate*

Can't complain about the rest of the results, the weaker tracks on Badlands definitely went out first (though I don't hate New Americana as much as others). Didn't get the chance to listen to Blue Neighborhood or Know-it-All in but I'm rooting for Youth, Wild, and Here!
