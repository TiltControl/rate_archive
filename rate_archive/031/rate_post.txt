**My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy**

In 2010, Kanye West was at his creative peak. His last album, *808s & Heartbreak* was regarded as one of the best records of 2008, and spawned many popular and iconic singles that permeated both pop and hip-hop radio, leaving lasting effects that would shape the music landscape to come. He was known and regarded as one of the world’s biggest rappers. Outside of music however, Kanye was fighting multiple battles. The infamous Taylor Swift incident was the year prior, and his public image was destroyed; his mental state was also in shambles, due to overwork.

After retreating to Hawaii in late 2009, West enlisted dozens of artists to collaborate with him on his ensuing magnum opus: *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy*. Wikipedia says: "The music was described as maximalist by Jon Caramanica of The New York Times, who also took note of East Coast hip hop elements, and Ryan Dombal from Pitchfork, who deemed it a "culmination" of West's past work: "Musically, [the album] largely continues where 2007's Graduation left off in its maximalist hip-hop bent, with flashes of The College Dropout's comfort-food sampling and Late Registration's baroque instrumentation weaved in seamlessly” and, in terms of lyrics: "The album's themes deal primarily with excess and celebrity, and also touch on decadence, grandiosity, escapism, sex, wealth, romance, self-aggrandizement, and self-doubt.”. It’s a concept album on fame in modern society, especially one of a black man examining himself and his scrutinized image.

MBDTF was preceded by teaser singles, dubbed “GOOD Fridays”, and after release, became a symbol for Kanye West’s public redemption arc. It debuted at number one, and at the 54th Grammy Awards, received the accolade of Best Rap Album. The singles of “Power”, “Runaway”, and “All of the Lights” all received platinum status, helping to bring Kanye West back in favor in the public consciousness. The album features artists like Kid Cudi, John Legend, and Bon Iver, while also featuring intricate and layered samples from the likes of Aphex Twin and King Crimson. The album is heavily regarded as Kanye’s best work, and one of the best albums of all time. - /u/ffourthofjuly

**good kid, m.A.A.d city**

After gaining notoriety in the hip-hop world with his debut album, *Section.80*, rapper Kendrick Lamar signed a major label record deal with Interscope Records and Dr. Dre’s Aftermath Entertainment, and immediately began work on recording his sophomore album, *good kid, m.A.A.d city* Lamar wanted to go back to his roots and showcase his hometown of Compton, California, examining every aspect from gang violence and drug dealing to former loves and maturity. According to Wikipedia:

> Good Kid, M.A.A.D City has a low-key, downbeat production, with atmospheric beats and subtle, indistinct hooks. It eschews contemporary hip hop tastes and generally features tight bass measures, subtle background vocals, and light piano. Writers draw comparisons of the music to Outkast's 1998 album Aquemini. Andrew Nosnitsky of Spin cites the music's "closest point of reference" as "the cold spaciousness of ATLiens-era Outkast, but as the record progresses, that sound sinks slowly into the fusionist mud of those sprawling and solemn mid-2000s Roots albums."

*good kid, m.A.A.d city* is a concept album, following Lamar’s teenage experiences throughout Compton and the adverse effects the hostile environment had on his growth and development. Billed as “a short film by Kendrick Lamar”, the unconventional album is full of iconic songs that continue to influence the rap and hip-hop world to this day. Songs like *Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe* and *Poetic Justice* give a moody, atmospheric feeling to the album that examine the inner workings of Lamar’s lyrical prowess, while others, such as *Backseat Freestyle* and *m.A.A.d city* showcase the braggadocio and violent, explosive characteristics that permeate throughout thug life in Compton. On release, *good kid, m.A.A.d city* received overwhelming critical acclaim from music publications, receiving a 9.5 from Pitchfork, 4/5 stars from Rolling Stone, an 8/10 from Spin, 5 stars from Allmusic, and a 91 overall score on Metacritic. The album is certified platinum, and has sold over 1.6 million copies. - /u/awesometuck1559

**channel ORANGE**

Following the release of his 2011 mixtape *nostalgia, ULTRA*, channel ORANGE is the debut album of singer/songwriter/rapper Frank Ocean. He had come to prominence with his work with Los Angeles-based hip-hop collective Odd Future, led by Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Most of the album is co-produced by Frank Ocean and Malay, a producer who worked on Frank’s second official album, *Blonde*, and has also worked with Zayn, Lorde, and Aminé. According to Wikipedia:

> Channel Orange has an unconventional musical style, film-inspired segue tracks, and songs that draw on electro-funk, pop-soul, jazz-funk, and psychedelic music. Ocean's songwriting touches on themes such as unrequited love, decadence, class, and drugs through the use of surrealistic imagery, conversational devices, and descriptive narratives depicting dark characters. His singing on the album exhibits free-form flow and alternating falsetto and tenor registers.

On channel ORANGE, Frank interpolates scenes from films, bounces between singing and rapping effortlessly, and links up with Odd Future member Earl Sweatshirt and legendary rapper André 3000 of OutKast. The title refers to the overall vision Frank had when creating the songs, as he has visual synesthesia. The opening song, Thinkin Bout You, is his highest charting song on the Hot 100 at 32. Pyramids, an ambitious song with two parts at nearly 10 minutes, features a guitar solo from John Mayer and was performed on Saturday Night Live. Sweet Life features trademark production from Pharrell. channel ORANGE was extremely critically acclaimed, earning a 9.5 from Pitchfork, 4/5 stars from Rolling Stone, 5/5 stars AllMusic, The Daily Telegraph, and The Guardian; and an overall 92 on Metacritic. The album is certified gold and has sold over 620,000 copies.

#RULES AND IMPORTANT INFO
 
**PLEASE READ ALL THE RULES. IF YOU HAVE PARTICIPATED IN ANY RATE POST- “2016 ULTIMATE ALBUM RATE, ” THEN THEY ARE MOSTLY THE SAME. I AM USING A PROGRAM MADE BY /U/LETSALLPOO (thank btw!), AND IF THESE RULES AREN’T FOLLOWED PRECISELY, THE PROGRAM WILL MESS UP. EVEN IF YOU HAVE SEEN THESE RULES BEFORE, GO OVER THEM AGAIN PLEASE, BECAUSE IF YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG I WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU!**
 
**SERIOUSLY GUYS**
 
* Listen to each song and **assign each a score between 1 and 10**. Decimals are fine, but **please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two demical spots: giving a 7.2 is okay, but giving a 7.25 will give me a headache**. This is because I'm using a computer program to parse the votes and print everything out (more on that later).
 
* **Yes, you have to listen to every song**.  I will not accept your ballot if you have a score missing. That's because it will crash the program (more on that later).
 
* Your scores should **NOT** be considered confidential.
 
* You may give **ONE** song a 0 and **ONE** song an 11. **This is ONE song total, NOT ONE SONG PER ALBUM**. Please reserve these for your least favourite and most favourite tracks; **excessive sabotage ruins rate results**.
 
* You **can** change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again afterwards.
 
* make things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on my part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to **use the pre-prepared link that I have put all over this post, such as [right here](http://tinyurl.com/ycfouxou). PLEASE USE THAT**. You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but **PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores**.
 
* If you don't follow the format, I'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions.

* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!

* If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!
 
* If, after sumbitting your scores, you change your mind about a certain song, I WILL change it up until i stop accepting scores.

**This is the ONE AND ONLY correct format:**
 
> Lost In The World: 10 This is amazing!
 
**These are INCORRECT, in fact, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:**
 
> Lost In The World: 10: This is amazing!
 
> Lost In The World: This is amazing! 10
 
> Lost In The World: I'm giving this a 10 because it's amazing!
 
> Lost In The World: 10-This is amazing!
 
> Lost In The World: 10 (This is amazing!)
