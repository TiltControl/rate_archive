kanye west, in a legendary conglomerate of both aphex twin and chris rock, creates an intimate and sympathetic portrayal of a man in a relationship that went sour. it encapsulates the irony of kanye’s life: hilarious yet incredibly sad. also introduced the phrase “yeezy taught me” into my vocabulary so thanks for that!

---
# THE MEANING OF L.O.V.E.

**dropthehammer11** (11): This song is perfection. The beautiful, wonderfully worked beat and sample use, Kanye’s tender vocals, Legend’s hook, the songwriting, the hilarious skit. Perfection.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): A snarky, sharp, and dark track, perhaps the darkest on the album. Featuring John Legend and Chris Rock, it’s probably the wildest Kanye collab yet, or that is, until Chief Keef and Bon Iver collabed with him. Another long outro this time, but it’s absolutely an essential skit that is super iconic.

**themobiler99** (10): My favorite verse on the whole album is his second verse here. The lyrics are great obviously, but how he uses voice modulation, panning and sonic manipulations really reinforces the lyrical themes of mania/jealousy/anxiety/mental instabilty/hatred/contradicitons. This way of the music intrinsicly supporting what is being said in the raps is amazingly coherent all over MBDTF. Also obligatory Chris Rock reference. Iconic spoken word.

**vapourlomo** (10): That Chris Rock monologue might be the only instance where something is both heartbreaking and absolutely hilarious. Yeezy taught me

**NFZHunter** (9.5): I really like this song, Kanye brings the feelings on this one and John Legend's vocals are awesome.

**rhetoric\_supreme** (9): Yeezy reupholstered my pussy, but that was the least he could do after all the popping he caused

**Waywatcher09** (9.5): love how the song plays with the direction the sound is coming from (shifting between left, middle and right)

**eklxtreme** (9): the piano sample and the production are just timeless and beautiful. those strings! kanye's singing!

---
# HATRED AND ATTITUDE TEAR US ENTIRELY

**kappyko** (5.5): iconic but in kind of a bad way

**atlastata** (5): John Legend has almost zero charisma, and he kills this song.

**stansymash** (0): end my life end my life end my life end my life end my life

a true glimpse into kanye’s life: a big ass crib, pussy, religion, and a mf porn star. i fuck with that kanye you doin well for yourself keep it goin hun, also there’s only one (1) negative comment for this song leave a comment in the box below as to what your conclusions may be for that

# HONEYMOON ON THE DANCE FLOOR

**enecks** (10): What a weird, yet inspired choice this song is. As a followup to the tragic emotional weight of Runaway, this seems weird- from strings and pianos to a grotesque rock sound that forshadowed Yeezus' direction. Even stranger is the subject matter change - from remorseful apologies over a lack of meaningful relationships to a one-night stand with a prostitute that is treated as having as much worth as a marriage in Kanye's mind. It's a wickedly comedic song - yet it somehow manages to get in a surprising hit of emotional impact - this is the low Kanye has stooped to. He needs to take the blame and move on. Does he do that? Not quite...

**MrSwearword** (10): this beat is like River City Ransom if you fought demons 'n shit. I love it.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): "I think I just fell in love with a porn star" has to be the best intro to a song ever. Definitely the most underrated song here. It's so ridiculous and hedonistic I can't help but laugh.

**themobiler99** (10): A grossly underrated track. Kanye really brings the energy with his verses. And while it seems shallow on the surface, what he's spitting about actually is really interesting. Why do we treat porn stars the way we do? They're good enough to help us get our nut off, but not good enough to rent a dress out to and let on our red carpets? The "fuck with the lights on" part is a fav of mine.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): I feel like my comments aren't doing justice to these songs but basically the bottom line is that they are all perfect and this album is perfect.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This song is basically Kanye going 'fuck it' after the emotional climax of Runaway. A very explicit song about sex in the same vein as I'm In It off Yeezus, Kanye sings about the problems of fame and falling in love with a porn star. Kanye has always shown to be very interested by sex and nudity as shown by his lyrics, fashion shows, performances, and music videos. This song gets that across, but also makes it clear that this isn't any glamorous occasion. This is back room at a club sex, fucking in a bathroom stall sex. The song feels dirty, like a broken Kanye going on an Eyes Wide Shut style sex journey to cope with his life. The Black Sabbath sample and grimy production help give it an almost 1970s Deep Throat era feel to it. It's desperate, real, and a really messy type of beautiful.

**strawberryswing1** (9): Yeezy is a prophet "one day I'm gonna marry a pornstar" congrats bro you did it

--
# HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

**NFZHunter** (6.5): My least favorite song on the album, kinda boring if I have to be honest

--
# ONE HELL OF A LIFE

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Fun fact: I used this song for a project in middle school where we had to analyze an explicit rap song (which I now realize is probably a pretty racist assignment lol). I chose this song and my teacher was absolutely horrified. Guess she wasn’t feeling blessed by the Yeezy.

---
# AT THE TOP OF MOUNT OLYMPUS

**dropthehammer11** (10): The gritty guitar line is fucking genius, the overall lo-fi sound of this track is a great juxtaposition of Dark Fantasy.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This is Kanye’s rockstar moment and it’s awesome.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): A fierce guitar beat outlines one of Kanye’s best songs, period. A deceptively catchy chorus, some of Kanye’s most biting commentary, and great performances from Raekwon and Cudi. There’s too many classic lines here to count, but my personal favorite is the 30 rocks line.

**themobiler99** (10): Absolutely the best rapping Kanye has done since his Late Registration days, and probably nothing since has topped this song as far as pure BARS are concerned. "I don't believe in Yesterday, and what's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?" is an iconic line (along with that whole verse). The production is absolutely top notch. The guitar playing by Mike Dean literally impregnates 5 women a year. Don't ask me how I know this statistic.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Iconic guitar riff, iconic verses, iconic Cudi.

**stansymash** (8): talk about black balls more

# GET UP OFF OF THIS DICK

**frazzledazzle55** (6): guitar loop gets a tad grating.

**robbiec\_** (6): this just feels like such a non-event in an album which was and still is such an EVENT

**shineflyer** (4): feels like a generic Kanye track. Probably because it kinda is one.

**SkyBlade79** (3): Definitely my least favorite song on the album. The lyrics are pretty lame (like the south park line and the black balls), and the vocal effects make Kanye’s words feel shallow.

# OBLIGATORY TAYLOR SWIFT REFERENCES

**PossumAloysuis** (10): Another incredible track. That guitar is everything. Taylor can only dream about making something this goddamn great

**sletrab07** (8.5): Taylor found dead in a ditch with her basic bitch album.

**zamomattel** (8.5): I like this, but as someone who definitely likes Kanye more than Taylor Swift... I prefer Taylor's Gorgeous

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): “Imma let you finish Taylor but Kanye had one of the best written ‘Gorgeous’ songs of all time. Of all time!” **this is only applicable to the actual song and not the too long outro/skit

---
# MY GOD, SHE’S GIVING ME PLEASURE

**NFZHunter** (10): LOVE the lyrics on this one, Frank's metaphors are very clever, and I will never not love 3 stacks.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): What can I say? I'm a sucker for songs that are a metaphor for some pum-pum. Majin Buu is a personal favorite. Anyways this is pure raw, sensual sex in audio form.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This song is beautiful, sensual, and even kind of thought provoking. The spacey, faraway guitars and low strings bring the song to a vibe that works perfectly with Frank's trippy lyrics about sex and extraterrestrial life. Frank hits some gorgeous notes and uses clever wordplay relating back to the song's title, but the one who brings it all together is notable feature-killer Andre 3000. Andre's verse is fantastic and fits perfectly with the mood of the song. It's all incredible.

**Verdantshade** (10): incredible lyrics, a perfect guitar riff and andre 3000. im sure if the aliens were watching us they'd be trying to recreate this song on mars

**VodkaInsipido** (10): André has one of the best verses in the album.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.5): This is the most chill song about existential angst and inner turmoil I have ever heard.

**zamomattel** (9.5): king of psychology

**d4b3ss** (8): 3 stacks could fuck my bitch

---
# PINK MATTER MORE LIKE DOESN’T MATTER

**Raykel** (7.8): Why does it sound like my dad is sneezing in the background? Oh my goood lmfakdjflhdkolj

**vapourlomo** (6.5): A little on the boring side, but at least the Andre 3000 verse is great!

**ignitethephoenix** (6): Maybe because I’m listening to this on the bus, but the sound quality is pretty poor and quiet so it kind of makes the song forgettable. André 3000 sounds good though.

**Leixander** (6): The only song that I skip in the album and probably the only time his crooning(PLEEASSAAHHHR) is annoying.

the greatest example of kanye’s ability to create lush and inventive production, this song has an ethereal quality that’s hard to define. if this song was a fabric it’d be gold velvet

---
# I LOVE IT THOUGH, YOU KNOW?

**matthewsalinsky2** (11): My favorite song ever

**PossumAloysuis** (11): If this beat was a women, I'd marry it in a heartbeat. That Smokey Robinson sample is downright euphoric. These strings and guitar my god. This shit belongs in a museum

**enecks** (10): A lot of this album operates on a whore/madonna dynamic but this track takes that dynamic down a relgious path - demon/angel. Backed up with this album's typically great pun game, a surprisingly good Rick Ross verse, and one of the most beautiful beats in Kanye's history, this track is one of the album's many peaks.

**ExtraEater** (10): like a melting candle on red velvet

**themobiler99** (10): Rick's verse always gets singled out here. Imo his delivery and swagger and *where* he's placed in the song really sell it and people just feed off his energy...but really what he's saying is nothing special and Kanye's verses are MUCH better if you ask me. Spitting about love and relationships in that self conscious and self aware place we know he handles so well. The beat is absolutely legendary, with that amazing Smokey Robinson sample being the backbone of the beat. Then that backbone is taken away and we're just left with piano. Then the rest of the drums an instruments come back in and build the beat up more organically, then it breaks into a pants wetting guitar solo. Then the sample comes back in finally, along with a (at the time) shocking and powerful final verse from the Teflon Don. What more could you ask for in a hip hop song honestly?

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.9): Reminiscent of his early stuff, Kanye is still the king of Chipmunk Soul.

**robbiec\_** (9): HAAAHAAANAANYAAAA

---
# I THOUGHT I WAS THE ASSHOLE, I GUESS IT’S RUBBIN OFF

**shineflyer** (2): This is the side of Kanye's material I'm not so into. It's where his full-of-himself personality shies through and doesn't work.

**xxiaverage** (7): beat like watching a weird boomerang 100 times on insta

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): This song just did nothing for me. It was well made, but just kind of boring.

**atlastata** (8): I want to clarify - this is an 8 for that beat, not for Rick Ross.

**MrSwearword** (8): Rick Ross was not needed and he fucks up the mood of the song

# LIFE IS LIKE A BOX OF CHOCOLATES

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): king of expressing his sexuality at the Grammys and then not submitting his better album for consideration even though he probably would have been nominated for AOTY

**Waywatcher09** (9.5): I love the chorus and the outro.

**LuckyKidA** (10): me and jenny was like peas and carrots

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A damn good closer here, with Frank opting for some simple lyrics and a really nice instrumental, and some goddamn beautiful whistling at the end. I always think of his Grammy performance while listening to it, and the visuals he had there were simple but nice.

**zamomattel** (10): tom hanks is shook

**NFZHunter** (9.8): just an awesome love song, the vocals are so sweet

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): This track uses a lot of the themes and narratives that exist throughout Frank's work, such as unrequited love and nostalgia (going down to basing the song after Forrest Gump) and it uses them so well. It's a perfect, kind of innocent way to end Channel Orange.

this song feels like summer and it’s amazing. the lush, warm tones of the song bathe over u like literal sunlight. some say sweet life by frank ocean is better than sex but i doubt popheads will get that comparison ayyy thank you folks i’m here all week

---
# BEST SONG WASN’T THE SINGLE

**dirdbub** (10): 🍑🍑🍑

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Pharrell’s production on this is immaculate, and it also has Frank’s most charismatic vocal performance on the album.

**kappyko** (10): sunlight through the windows as sound

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Another very chill, nice track. This one separates itself with some orchestration, giving it a more cinematic quality to contrast the simple instrumental that starts off the song. It reminds me a bit of Suit & Tie in that it feels very throwback to a specific time, very kind of 1970s vibe. Of course, Frank sounds great on the track too, really selling the sound and style he was going for.


**MrSwearword** (10): a song with concrete effort from Frank Ocean. I LIVE

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): The best song wasn’t the single. This is close to the best song on here, I will say that. It’s one of the happier tracks (I guess, considering it’s about how the sweet life keeps you isolated from the outside world) here, and goddamn does it feel elegant. The piano here is amazing, and Frank just murders every part of this track.

**themobiler99** (10): One of my favorites off the album. Frank really really SANG in this era and you can feel it in the chorus here, pumping every word full of passion. “The best song wasn’t the single, but you weren’t either,” is an amazing line, grade A wordplay that he still hasn’t topped.

---
# SWEET LIFE MORE LIKE BLAND LIFE

**vapourlomo** (7): I'm probably going against common wisdom here, but this song's production just makes me think of a cruise line. But the lyrics are nice and cheeky, so I can't get too angry at this.

**zamomattel** (6.5): feels kind of like a intro to super rich kids instead of its own song

**shineflyer** (5): it's got cool jazzy stuff going on. I wish the melody didn't feel quite as improv-jazz, though.

TOO MANY URKELS ON YOUR TEAM THAT’S WHY YA WINS-LOWWWW

on the real though i wish i could express to yall how this song changed my life. my beautiful dark twisted fantasy is my favorite album of all time and i wish i could put into words the emotions i felt the first time i heard this track and knew that i was listening to a work of art. it thoroughly encapsulates the sounds of the album from the layers upon layers of vocals to the effect laden guitar riffs. the beginning of a masterpiece

---
# CAN WE GET MUCH HIGHER?

**dropthehammer11** (10): Such a great opener to this wonderful album. The production is grand, bougie and sets the mood of the album so incredibly well.

**Leixander** (10): CAN WE GET MUCH HIGHER, *so high*, UH OH OH, UH OH OH. Was a serious 11 contender, my favorite Kanye song ever.

**LuckyKidA** (10): i'm glad the muppets choir was included

**PossumAloysuis** (10): One of the best intros to any album you'll ever hear. It sounds like you're floating to heaven

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): An absolute classic intro, perhaps his best. Nicki Minaj gives a flawless monologue that leads into soulful and anthemic singing that drops into one of the sickest opening lines from Kanye yet. It’s brimming with iconic Yeezy lines, rapid fire quips that feel so essential Kanye, then giving you some breathing room for a quick moment before a barrage of assonance. The second verse is one of Kanye’s best, and the whole song is a sleeper classic that could silently dart to the top track and I wouldn’t be surprised.

**eklxtreme** (9.5): so pure and warm. I always picture a sunny leafy scene in the countryside.

**vapourlomo** (9.5): Having Nicki open an album with a fake British accent was the biggest baller move in 2010, trust me. The rest of the song delivers, too.

---
# YOU AINT GOT NO YEEZY IN YOUR SERATO

**DraculaWeekend** (7): That Nicki intro was wack. Also, did he try to rhyme séance with parents??

**NFZHunter** (7): This is good, but compared to the rest of the album, and the other 2 albums, it's kinda subpar

**xxiaverage** (6): A meh opener to one of the greatest albums ever

**shineflyer** (4.5): it's not a bad intro, it feels like a bit of a throwback to 90's hip hop. But it's not something I'm gonna care to go back to much

honestly it’s so weird to see this so low because it’s a song that i thought would definitely make top 5, not to mention that it is my 11. everything comes together perfectly on the song: the spacey beach house sample, the delivery of the verses, jay rock’s feature. its one of kendrick’s best samples in my opinion and indicative of some of his best work

my comment for this song was “it is 1:17 am, i am studying for a philosophy final, and relistening to this is creating tear stains on my study guide #relatable” and i think that’s indicative of the power this song, about unrequited love and impromptu emotion spilling to a cab driver, has. both of those things are extremely relatable by the way so maybe that’s why i love it

---
# GOOD RELIGION

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): The lyrics and the delivery of the line “If it brings me to my knees/It’s a bad religion” might be the most powerful moment on the whole album.

**kappyko** (10): i don't know if God will ever love me or another person but this song makes me feel shit okay

**Leixander** (10): This resonates with me in a personal level. Eh this is a pop sub, let's not go too far. I LOVE THIS SONG

**PossumAloysuis** (10): The organ sounds like catharsis. Pure raw emotion. Another masterpiece

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is the one. It’s a painfully, painfully real track, one that very much is the best on the album. It’s quite easy to explain why this track is so good, but it’s really hard to explain why it hits so hard. Is it the beautiful organs? Is it Frank’s divine voice? Is it the gushing lyrics (if it brings you to your knees, it’s a bad religion)? It’s probably all those things. His story of him going through all of this in a taxi cab while talking to the taxi driver feels infinitely genuine. And when the final chorus kicks in with those drums, it’s just bliss as Frank hits that high note. His best song up until Blonde.

**Verdantshade** (10): more beautiful than thinkin bout you imo. while thinkin bout you is about heartbreak, bad religion is unrequited love, which is just as painful. when the drums come in and he screams love is my favourite moment on the album, possibly my favourite moment on all the albums in this rate.

---
# BAD RELIGION

**sletrab07** (8): This isn't amazing, but it's a gay anthem and I respect that.

**stansymash** (8): gunk

**vapourlomo** (8): It's a bit too Broadway ballad-y for my taste (he pulled off this style of minimalist gospel better with White Ferrari), but it's anchored by a powerful performance and heartbreaking lyrics.

**shineflyer** (7.5): Accordion? In my R&B album?

**MrSwearword** (7): it's cute but it drags on despite being so short

# HERE ARE THE GOOD COMMENTS I’M SORRY I CAN’T THINK OF A POSITIVE TITLE FOR THIS ONE

**NFZHunter** (11): One of my favorite songs of all time, this song gives me chills.

**stansymash** (11): yeah whatever its my 11 because of courses it is

**dropthehammer11** (10): Twelve minutes of fucking *hip-hop*.

**eklxtreme** (10): beautiful. inspiring. touching. poetic. genius. masterpiece.

**ExtraEater** (10): like a jazz concert after a funeral

**PossumAloysuis** (10): Another song that deserves another 11 from me. A towering masterclass in concept, storytelling and execution. This is still one of his absolute best songs to date. When I heard the gunshots for the first time it gave me chills. The second half is also awe inspiring and left me speechless with how good it was. A perfect song

**themobiler99** (10): This isn’t an easy song to listen to all the time, because of its length and subject matter. I can’t stand the corny spoken word jesus ending but I concede that it has to be there for the story, and really this track is so so so so perfect otherwise (legit breathtaking) that I can’t dock any points for it.

---
# DYING OF THIRST

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): The first half I think is too long and sounds a bit too unpolished for me. But I really like the second half of the song.

**shineflyer** (6.5): a cool track, but honestly probably longer than it needs to be. really nice for chilling out though.

**Raykel** (6): It's good but it's so long I don't see myself going back to it.

**SkyBlade79** (6): so sad for the first 8 minutes

**vapourlomo** (6): It's good storytelling and all...but...I'm sorry, it's 12 minutes long. That's just too much. I know, I know, I'm basic, but it's a song, not a podcast.

---
# BIG MOOD

**dirdbub** (8.5): I believe in God, the father almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth and of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only God, our son, who was born of the father before all ages. God from God, light from light, True God from True God. Begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father. Through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from Heaven, and by the power of the Holy Spirit was born of the Virgin Mary and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontious Pilot, suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day. He ascended into Heaven and is seated at the right hand of the father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and His kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of light, who proceeds with the Father and the Son. Who with the Father and the Son is glorified and has spoken through the profets. I believe in one holy, Catholic, and apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins. And I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.

highkey though can we take this from a logical perspective: whomst the fuck would want their dick to be as big as the eiffel tower? what’s the logic behind that? would you become a giant with a normal sized dick or will the dick overtake you? like and leave a comment in the box below what you think and as always thanks for watching

# GODDAMN I FEEL AMAZING

**d4b3ss** (10): there are two types of people, people who have shouted along with the hook to this song in a public place unashamed, and fucking liars

**enecks** (10): Within the narrative this is so damn effective - an intentionally immature embrace of hedonism. The third verse casting Kendrick's most hedonistic impulses as Eminem through his rapping style is genius.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): This shit goes so fucking hard. Please play this in ya car at absurd volumes. A Certified Banger^TM

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): An ABSOLUTE slapper. Everything from the shakey loose beat to Kendrick just going in is everything I ever wanted from this formidable followup to Rigamortis. The chorus is absolutely massive (I pray my dick get as big as the eiffel tower so I can fuck the world for 72 hours!) and it just bangs. That’s all.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEWYv9WI7Pg

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): A banger with an incredible Hit-Boy beat where Kendrick gets his ego on. It's a good transition into the next stretch of tracks and honestly the song on GKMC that reminds me the most of DAMN.

**stansymash** (8.8): Holy Bazinga! A Dick the Size of the Eiffel Tower (France). That's One Enormous Penis! His Underpants Must Be Massive! Wowee Zowee!

---
# DIE FROM LEAD SHOWERS

**SkyBlade79** (8): some of these lines are horrible but the rest is amazing

**MrSwearword** (6): that Eifel Tower lyric is fucking stupid

**NFZHunter** (8): Def a banger and fits into the narrative of the album but doesn't have a whole lot to offer other than that.
