Rely and trust upon your own decisions. On your own beliefs. You understand the things that I've taught you. Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs. Don't use that cocaine or marijuana because that stuff is highly addictive. When people become weed-heads they become sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned. Sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned. That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom. Unless you're taking it under doctor's - umm- control. Then it's regulated. Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol, do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated. This is mom, call me, bye"

**eklxtreme**: "nice iphone notification what an incredible way to start an album. I get that the video game blips are part of the whole lo-fi nostalgia aesthetic which was seen in his SNL performance too, but they're very miniscule and don't have much presence throughout the album at all. bye!"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Pretty much just an outro interlude, but a nice way to exit the album. My score would have been higher had we included Golden Girl with Tyler."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is in fact a closing track."

**PossumAloysuis**: "This is a 9 by itself but add Golden Girl (which you should hear if you haven't, cause you're doing yourself a disservice) and it's a full 11"

**vapourlomo**: "It's pretty, and then it just turns into noise"

**eklxtreme**: "haha why couldn't this just be cut down to the last 20 seconds"

**themobiler99**: "The long silence here is so stupid, and having Tyler only get a half a verse sucks, but it’s forgiven by the fact that the Golden Girl melody is soothing and catchy"

**Leixander**: "This beat and sample is making me *weak*"

**PossumAloysuis**: "This is laying at the beach music"

# YOU’RE MY HEAVEN

**d4b3ss** (11): greatest song of all time on the greatest album of all time. we've reached peak music we can all go home now. The production on this song kicks so much ass. It's so close to sounding like just noise, it's almost like it's being held together by string. It's very chaotic, but that's what makes the resolutions in this song (like right after Kanye's verse, or like at 3:25) so amazing. I could gush on this song for a while, Kanye's basic lyrics and flow playing off the production that goes everywhere, 2:22 being the climax of the second half of the album where it was all pushing toward. This song is everything.

**dirdbub** (11): RUN FROM THE LIGHTS. RUN FROM THE NIGHT. **RUN FOR YOUR LIFE.**

**LuckyKidA** (11): AAAAHHHHHMMMMUUUPPPPIIIINNNNNTHAAAAWOOOOOOODSSSSSS

**Raykel** (11): When I played this in the car and the beat dropped even my \#TeamTaylor friend who was driving snapped his whole body to the right which made him do an unexpected last minute left turn and yelled "ALRIGHT KANYE!"

**DraculaWeekend** (10): The intro gives me chills every time. Who knew the combination of Kanye and Bonnie Bear could be so good?

**dropthehammer11** (10): I’M LOST IN THE WOOOOORLD. Proof the Kanye can do pop music damn well.

**eklxtreme** (10): instant goosebumps, god DAMN. bon iver crafted one really great tune and kanye fucking frankensteined that and made a grand triumphant anthem. this shit makes you feel on top of the world.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): Now this is how you end a fucking album, especially one as ridiculously over the top as this one. The Bon Iver sample is pure euphoria and when the drums drops, it's like your spirit leaving your body. A masterpiece of a song. It's absolutely flawless

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): A goddamn beautiful brilliant closer. It’s really sad and honest, this admission of being completely lost. He samples Justin Vernon’s Woods’, which is about being lost in the world and moving to the woods and being lost there too. This track parallels that as West finds no solace in his stardom. It’s pure escapism and it’s quite possibly the best Kanye and Justin collab yet.

**themobiler99** (10): Kanye has a technique where he sonically twists the words of the song he’s sampling into a new phrase to fit the theme of his song. And then he layers these new words on to the original words to create this delicious juxtaposition. Never has it been more effective as with Lost in the World. The Bon Iver sample is allowed to play unmolested at first, and then is built upon exponentially as the song progresses, until the whole thing explodes into joy and exuberance. The lush happiness in the production doesn’t downplay the darker themes in the lyrics, no. It lets you know that you may feel lost but there’s something (or someone) better around the corner for you.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): This is what happens when two of the top 5 artists in the universe get together.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): The beautiful final act of the album. The sample from Bon Iver's "Woods" feels made for Kanye. I've listened to the original song, and it feels incomplete without Kanye's layered production and added backing vocals. Kanye is only on the song for a brief verse, but in only twelve bars he is able to say so much. The verse began as a poem to Kim Kardashian, and you can tell it comes from a real place. The song would feel incomplete without the verse, but what really shines for Kanye on the song is the production. Lost in the World is a huge finale for the album, with soaring vocals and instruments that make everything feel so epic. The part right after the Gil Scott-Heron sample where all of the vocals and instrumentation hits the absolute peak might be my favorite musical moment on any album. MBDTF's maximalism lead to many great things, but the sheer, titanic sounds and moods that are created by these songs have yet to be matched for me.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): If it weren't for another song in another album, this would get my 11. It's everything: the beat, the voices, the buildup, the poem, the choruses, Bon Iver. Kanye's best song, and there is a lot to choose from.

**shineflyer** (9): I knew the Bon Iver track beforehand, but not this. So when the beat kicked in? I don't have the words to explain how mind blowing that was

# YOU’RE MY HELL

**zamomattel** (7): Beautiful but Bon Iver isn't reaally my thing

**Leixander** (5): Skipping this one everyime, don't @ me :eyes: The aututune is just too much and I don't like Bon Iver's work much other than Skinny Love.

**MrSwearword** (3): put this on *Yeezus* or *The Life of Pablo* and it'd fit in better there.

**strawberryswing1** (0): After being so used to the original verison of the Bon Iver song this samples ([Woods](https://open.spotify.com/track/35zX9FPuA6qg9bqx79eskS)), this just hurts my ears.

# YOU CAN FIND GOLD AND MAYBE GET RICH

**kappyko** (11): there's really no other song to give my 11 in this. this song means so much to me. in late 2013, i had never listened to music before, i was just a socially awkward 6th grader with no musical experience or social experience. i was surrounded by teenagers that were so much older and mature than i was, and my middle school was generally full of people of different backgrounds that i had never had experience with. on bus rides home kendrick singles would play on the radio as i struggled to find my own identity. i learned how to hate myself in 6th grade, i learned how i felt about the people i loved, and this song kind of brings me back to the wash of heat and sweat that my middle school brought me. this song is legitimately beautiful to hear. i could write more but i can't right now but this song means so much to me

**enecks** (10): This is one of those tracks that is in my mind as a modern classic. The beat is just so indescribably perfect - its one of the best rap beats of all time. The lyrics are just so good in flow and are honestly a better diss to contemporary rappers than Kendrick's clumsily blunt Control verse.

**Kaylaboe** (10): sigrid who? such a chill vibe to this

**PossumAloysuis** (10): This is the sound of a man who is so above his peers they're not even in the same stratosphere. Don't kill the vibe

**stansymash** (10): we are all bitches on this fine day

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): While it doesn't fit in to the overall concept story of the album, this is a great single. Kendrick critiques and analyzes the state of modern hip hop over a chill, guitar-based beat. This isn't unique for Kendrick, as he's covered the territory in other notable songs (Control, Hood Politics, etc.) but I think this is his most thought provoking coverage of the subject. The outro with the strings is a really beautiful moment.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.6): Love the guitar on this and the chorus is hypnotic.

**Doomulos** (9): One of the best songs to walk to late at night

**SkyBlade79** (9): so smooth, and the female accompaniment is great

**themobiler99** (9): Great single, and very necessary to kickstart his career on the radio. I don’t think it’s as good as the other singles and the verses don’t necessarily continue what we hear in ‘Sherane’, which has always low key disappointed me.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Lyrics not quite as good as Sherane but it slaps harder.

**Verdantshade** (9): such a chill song

**jamesfog** (8.5): This bumps. I like the guitar and violins.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I know this is one of the songs that made him famous, but it’s alright. Love the vibe of these song and how smooth it is, but I wouldn’t put it at the top of his best songs list.

**shineflyer** (8): chill. This feels like laying back in the summer sun.

# WITH ALL DISRESPECT, LET ME SAY THIS

**eklxtreme** (7.5): smooth and sunny vibes, though I think it's the weakest on the album and it's too long

**chipsi1** (6.5): I really dislike his voice on the verses for some reason, still good though.

Frank gets an assist from fellow Odd Future member Earl Sweatshirt for an insane assonance-filled verse.

# IT’S GOOD TIMES, YEAAAAAH

**xxiaverage** (11): The cough syrup of this rate

**dirdbub** (10): this is way too real

**dropthehammer11** (10): I love the consistent piano chords that drive the track forward.

**eklxtreme** (10): he paints a beautiful narrative through the lyrics and effectively creates that nostalgic vibe.

**NFZHunter** (10): I really really like this song, Earl fits the theme so well

**PossumAloysuis** (10): I've never heard a song so brilliantly encapsulate the mindset of wealthy kids with no responsibility as well as this one. Except for some Vampire Weekend

**sletrab07** (10): Oh, an Elton John sample? Automatic 10. Earl Sweatshirt's verse? Automatic 10.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): SUPER RICH KIDS WITH NOTHING BUT LOOSE ENDS. SUPER RICH KIDS WITH FAKE FRIENDS. This is very close to being the best track on the album. The story here is palpably visual, and Frank’s storytelling is truly divine. And Earl, man. This is one of the greatest verses of his career, a disinterested assonance affair that not only fits but absolutely makes the song. And the beat is this punching step up a staircase that eventually collapses, and makes the final chorus this much more impactful.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Kind of nostalgic and almost cynical. The slow, almost kind of waltzy piano beat gives the track a unique vibe from what came before it and definitely sets a mood and time and place for the song. However, Earl is the highlight for me. He's one of my favorite rappers, and I love his use of assonance and wordplay. Earl's verse sounds so smooth and cohesive, I love it.

**Verdantshade** (10): channel orange is a very personal album but super rich kids has frank playing a character nothing like him and he tells the story amazingly well. the search for a real love is a theme that runs throughout the album and it's glaringly obvious in this track. you can hear the desperation in frank's voice. and earl's verse has mad flow

**themobiler99** (9): I love the Bennie and the Jets style piano, I love the themes of alienation and depression, but although the word play is clever here I think he lays it on a bit thick at times. Earl is golden here.

**Waywatcher09** (9): Perfect follow-up to Sweet life and earl deep voice is a nice contrast.

# CADDY SMASHING, BRATTY ASS

**Raykel** (7.8): Am I the only person who thinks Earl has never had a good flow? It's always really grating when compared to the beat.

**Mudkip1** (3): i don't like the way he sings in this one

# LOST IN THE HEAT OF IT ALL

**chipsi1** (11): Super catchy, was pretty much the only song I listened to for like 2 weeks when I first heard it and I'm still not sick of it. so good.

**Leixander** (11): THE PERFECT R&B SONG AND YOU KNOW IT

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Those opening lyrics are iconic tbh

**frazzledazzle55** (10): just makes me feel so happy!

**Mudkip1** (10): oh this is funky!! i like this a lot

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): the second Frank song I got exposed to. It's almost too uptempo - I think Frank excels at more emotional ballads - but fuck me it's still so good.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of my favorite beats on the album. It's super simple with just a drum beat and a keyboard, but it's super infectious and goes really well with Frank's lyrics. Once again, a bit of strings and extra instrumentation gives the song an almost cinematic quality that works to its advantage.

**atlastata** (9): This song is fantastic and I don't remember ever thinking it was before.

**dropthehammer11** (9): Love the groove of this track, juxtaposes Pyramids very well.

**shineflyer** (9): I don't know what to say about why this track works. It's just the combination of all it's little aspects. I think the guitar plays an important part, though.

**themobiler99** (9): I wish Frank enunciated more in this song, but that’s my only complaint. It’s jaunty, catchy, interesting and he talks about big titties. Boom.

**xxiaverage** (9): the Mexican Coke of this rate

**MrSwearword** (7): kind of weak but great production

**vapourlomo** (5.5): I'll never be a huge fan of the super-spaced out, tropical songs on this album. He pulled off this musical style better five years later with Slide.

# LEAD YOU TO VICTORY, KENDRICK

**DraculaWeekend** (11): Classic

**atlastata** (10): This is probably my favorite Kendrick song. Kendrick's a great rapper, but some of his songs tend to blend together to me - they're just well done songs. This is one of those songs that stands out - how he uses the alter-ego, basing it in his own life and his own memories - it's just a great song.

**chipsi1** (10): This is such an obvious 10, great single choice and I love his lyricism.

**d4b3ss** (10): People bitching about Caramel Cabana not reaching number 1 when this barely cracked the top 20 shaking my head.

**dirdbub** (10): this was the first rap song I memorized :honk:

**dropthehammer11** (10): A breathtaking track about alcohol abuse. Still sounds amazing 5 years later.

**enecks** (10): I love songs that criticise certain formats of songs while also being effective at that - case in point this song, which is a song about how peer pressure and drinking lead to bad decisions in a very drinking-friendly musical format. I have seen people doing shots to this. It's a beautiful irony.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This song perfectly balances catchiness with quality verses. Kendrick really captures the state of mind that drives different people to drink.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is the song that got me into Kendrick. I think everything about this song is perfection, from the ‘drank’ parts, to the chorus. It’s also one of the more accessible songs on the album, and it’s a great blend of storytelling and musicality.

**Leixander** (10): The only song I knew before I listened to this album, an amazing song.

**MrSwearword** (10): battling alcoholism to a commercially friendly beat? Sia who?

**Mudkip1** (10): ooooh mawma this is a bop and a half oooh lawd baby jesus i have been resurrected and my ailments are cured and my spirits been purified and my crops are plentiful

**PossumAloysuis** (10): The level of depth on here is a thing of genius, especially since this became a radio hit. It's always funny to see people get absolutely shitfaced to a song denouncing alcoholism.

**shineflyer** (10): I love how this track defies expectations - instead of another rap glorifying drinking, this warns of the dangers that can come with holding that ideal. The lyrics themselves are captivating, and the beat only reflects and reinforces that, particularly the watery synths that you hear throughout the song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): His most popular single off the album, Swimming Pools is this generation’s Hey Ya, a track that is as catchy as it is critical, and it seems monotonous and gashing in its self-loathing. The chorus is great, feeling more biting with each “DRANK” and the verses don’t slouch either. The extended version on the album includes a damn great verse at the end too with a switched up beat that is one of my favorite moments on the album.

**themobiler99** (10): Yes the GP really missed the point of this song but I’m actually kind of glad they did, or else a great song wouldn’t have been played as much! This song is amazing social commentary, it’s beat is awesome and Kendrick spits like a god.

**Verdantshade** (10): ironically the soundtrack to many a drinking game

**Waywatcher09** (10): The ultimate drinking song about alcohol addiction? Genius. Also love the production so much.

**zamomattel** (10): a serious contender for 11, funny that it has become a party song tho

**NFZHunter** (9.7): A party song that is catchy but subversive, overall great


**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Kendrick's first real pop hit, but not one that came at the expense of his integrity. Swimming Pools has great production and a killer hook, but the use of irony to get across the anti-alcoholism themes of the song was executed really well. You can sing along to the ear-worm hook, but it comes with the sobering reality of the verses.

**vapourlomo** (9): It's funny to think this was Kendrick's first hit, when now it's sort of forgotten compared to GKMC's more flashy tracks. Still, there's a good reason why Drank was successful: The masking of a song about alcoholism as a turn-up anthem was a genius Trojan horse.

**ffourthofjuly** (8): one time i got an A+ on a visual analysis project because i analyzed the entirety of the swimming pools video thanks to kendrick lamar for saving my junior year ap language grade

One of the posse cuts on MBDTF gets upstaged by a young Nicki Minaj’s best verse of her career.
---

# WATCH THE QUEEN CONQUER

**atlastata** (10): Nicki gets a pass forever just because of this verse. Also, does anybody else love that Jay decided to just start listing monsters at the start of his verse.

**dirdbub** (10): was this Nicki's peak? the answer is yes but discuss

**dropthehammer11** (10): One of the posse cuts of the decade. Kanye rips his shit, Jay does his thing, NICKI OHMANGOTDAM.

**ffourthofjuly** (10): i can now only think of that one tweet thats like KANYE IN STUDIO: ight this track is called monster / JAY Z: bet

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): *insert Nicki verse here*

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of the best rap songs of all time with some iconic lines. Kanye and Nicki especially both killed it.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): This is so creepy and eerie and quotable and I love it. Nicki's best verse ever too. With that said, call me if you want your pussy in a sarcophagus or a swallowship. Not responsible for your esophagus though.

**sletrab07** (10): Nicki Minaj will never top this verse, it is THAT good. Side note: PUT THE PUSSY IN A SARCOPHEGUS, NOW SHE CLAIMING THAT I BRUISED HER OSOEPHAGUS is "iconic" defined.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): What a star studded cast. Monster is one of the tracks on MBDTF that features Justin Vernon, and he is the icing on this multilayered and many-tiered cake. It’s simply perfection, from JAY Z’s hilarious monster verse to Nicki’s career-making verse, to Justin Vernon giving his all. Another classic.

**themobiler99** (10): The song that made me a Kanye stan forever. I had been hearing and enjoying his singles for years but when my friend showed me this song after school a few days after it came out I rushed home and found the GOOD Friday download link and haven't stopped stanning since. Every verse is quality (YES EVEN JAY'S VERSE). Nicki's verse is obviously get a lot of comments on this rate, and deservedly so, it's one of the best ever. It's a shame she hasn't done anything truly great since.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of the tracks from G.O.O.D. Fridays so good that it couldn't just stay a G.O.O.D. Fridays song. Everyone sounds hungry on the menacing beat, and every piece of this song feels essential. Rick Ross may vanish after the first twenty seconds and also refer to one of the only songs on the album that doesn't have any samples as a "Kanye West sample" but it wouldn't be the same song without his intro for me. I know Jay's verse is divisive as well, but I still love it. Kanye kills it, Bon Iver brings it all home with the outro, and I don't know what else has to be said about the best verse of Nicki Minaj's career other then that it's amazing.

**vapourlomo** (10): If this song was the Nicki verse alone, I would give it a 12.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): Nicki's best verse, Kanye's bragging lines, Bon Iver's beautiful voice and a punchy, monstruous beat. One of the best songs in MBDTF.

**zamomattel** (10): Monster, Runaway, Power, Blame Game, Dark Fantasy, Hell of A Life, question what do all of these songs have in common? THEY ARE ALL MOTHERFUCKING BOPS

**d4b3ss** (9): Nicki and the production carry this song, but holy shit does Nicki carry this song.

# QUESTION: WHAT DO THESE THINGS ALL HAVE IN COMMON?

**DraculaWeekend** (9.5): Jay's terrible verse keeps this song from being a 10

**shineflyer** (9.5): The only reason this isn't a full ten is Jay's verse. But even then, that's just because it doesn't live up to Kanye's verse or Nicki's iconic verse. And, as usual, Kanye makes insanely good drum beats.

**strawberryswing1** (9.5): I wanna give this a 10 so bad, but Jay-Z's feature makes the score drop. Tbh I wouldn't mind if Rick's feature was cut either.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): A beautiful, aggressive masterpiece, elevated by Bon Iver's angelic voice and Nicki's best ever verse and slightly ruined by Jay-Z's verse. Would be a 10 without Jay.

**Waywatcher09** (9.5): Best nicki verse ever, i like the rick ross intro, bon iver & kanye were amazing. Jay-z wasnt his best and because of that no 10.

**chipsi1** (8): God, I want to give this a 10 so bad but like what was Jay thinking with that verse?

**MrSwearword** (6): Kanye at his most B+ flow and the fluke instance of Nicki being good carries everyone else fucking up royally

# POO COMES IN WITH A HOT TAKE

**letsallpoo** (5): nicki's verse is the best part but she's done better since. nothing else is really worth it

Piccprincess: [Intro: Bon Iver]  
I shoot the lights out  
Hide 'til it's bright out  
Oh just another lonely night  
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?  

[Intro Verse: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker  
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble  
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles  
Kanye West samples, here's one for example  

[Hook: Kanye West]  
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it  
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster  
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert  
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert  
Profit, profit, nigga I got it  
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster  
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert  
I'ma need to see your fucking hands  

[Verse 1: Kanye West]  
The best living or dead hands down, huh  
Less talk, more head right now, huh  
And my eyes more red than the devil is  
And I'm about to take it to another level, bitch  
No matter who you go and get  
Ain't nobody cold as this  
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assists  
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit  
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit  
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain  
Bought the chain that always give me back pain  
Fucking up my money so yeah I had to act sane  
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent  
Chick came up to me and said  
"This the number to dial  
If you wanna make your #1 your #2 now"  
Mix that Goose and Malibu I call it "Malibooyah"  
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?  
Know that motherfucker well: "What you gonna do now?"  
Whatever I want to do. Gosh! It's cool now  
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now  
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out  
Cause you'll never get on top of this  
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this  
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?  
Put the pussy in a sarcophagus  
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus  
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship  
I'm living in the future so the present is my past  
My presence is a present, kiss my ass  

[Hook: Kanye West]  
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it  
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster  
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert  
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert  
Profit, profit, nigga I got it  
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster  
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert  
I'ma need to see your fucking hands  

[Verse 2: Jay Z]  
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness  
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience  
Question: What do these things all have in common?  
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster  
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense  
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is  
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen  
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams  
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I  
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I  
Rape and pillage your village, women and children  
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is  
Love, I don't get enough of it  
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers  
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires  
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air  
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs  
Trying to draw blood from my ice-cold veins  
I smell a massacre  
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up  

[Hook: Kanye West]  
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it  
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster  
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert  
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert  
Profit, profit, nigga I got it  
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster  
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert  
I'ma need to see your fucking hands  

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]  
Pull up in the monster automobile, gangsta  
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka  
Yeah I'm in that Tonka color of Willy Wonka  
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer  
OK, first things first I'll eat your brains  
Then I'm a start rocking gold teeth and fangs  
Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do  
Hair dresser from Milan that's the monster 'do  
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe  
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew  
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face  
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice cause my money ain't  
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?  
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?  
50K for a verse, no album out  
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbiez got to climb it  
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent  
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wylin'  
Nicki on them titties when I sign it  
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded  
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K  
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki cause she's fake  
She on a diet but her pockets eating cheesecake  
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play  
Just killed another career, it's a mild day  
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me  
I think me, you and Am should ménage Friday  
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash  
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast  
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for  
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster  

[Outro: Bon Iver]  
I crossed the limelight  
And I'll let God decide  
And I wouldn't last these shows  
So I am headed home  
I crossed the limelight  
And I'll let God decide  
And I wouldn't last these shows  
So I am headed home  
I crossed the limelight  
And I'll let God decide  
And I wouldn't last these shows  
So I am headed home

# COOL ENOUGH TO KICK IT

**robbiec\_** (11): I guess I'll give it to this beautiful song that I can actually sing

**chipsi1** (10): Ugh, I love this song so goddamn much, his vocals on this are so great.

**enecks** (10): A beautiful track - a smooth and bittersweet ode to unrequited love that resonated with me on a deep personal level.

**ExtraEater** (10): like fluorescent lights in your bedroom

**ffourthofjuly** (10): i am giving this song a 10 but let the record show that the single version with the synth opening instead of the violins is so so SO much better. but on a different note this song changed my life for the better and i now divide my life into pre-CO and post-CO

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This is a perfect melody. I wouldn’t even care if the lyrics actually were “a potato flew around my room” because the melody is that good.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is one of the only Frank Ocean songs I’ve heard (so far) but it’s a great one. I love the simplicity of it, and Frank sounds great on it. The lyrics are cute too.

**kappyko** (10): my first frank ocean song ever. heard from the playlists of my sister circa 2012 and 2013, frank ocean spoke something to me i didn't realize until later in my life. something so longing and melancholic about this track tugged at me in 6th grade and still does. i vividly remember the lyric video to this, containing the original mix with no strings, that i personally enjoy more over the album version. love this.

**Leixander** (10): The song that made almost everyone a fan of Frank. A heart wrenching ballad.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): The leaked version was great but this one is even better. The strings are a great touch.

**shineflyer** (10): such a romantic track, his falsetto just grips your attention

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): The sTRINGS (that we waited nearly a full year to be added). This is perhaps Frank’s most iconic song, and with good reason. His lyrics are fine tuned here, and it’s just playful enough to be painful. Frank’s chorus is ethereal and the instrumental is lifted. The wait for Channel Orange was a struggle (which we would later find to be usurped by Blonde), but ultimately worth it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): My introduction to Frank. I loved this song before I loved Frank, but since I wasn't really into music back then I didn't even look up the rest of Channel ORANGE until like 2015? But yeah I've had this song on my rotation for 5 years now and it never gets old.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of my absolute favorite love songs. The warm production, Frank's beautiful lyrics, and his amazing falsetto make this song a classic. I really love the verses on this track, full of really interesting metaphors and wordplay on love.

**Verdantshade** (10): oh my god his vocals and the lyrics. it breaks my heart to listen to every time

**VodkaInsipido** (10): strings make me wet

**zamomattel** (10): oh honey that falsetto can stay forever

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.8): hearing this live changed my life

**Waywatcher09** (9.5): That falsetto is amazing. One of Frank’s best vocal performance of the album.

**stansymash** (8.5): smeat! (smart and neat)

# NOT THINKING SO FAR AHEAD

**NFZHunter** (8.3): Frank shows off his pipes on this one but I wouldn't say this is one of the better songs on the album

**DraculaWeekend** (8): I know this song is really great and everyone loves it but for me personally it is just not a 10 song (which is how I think most people would rate it). Maybe it's too slow or something idk

**eklxtreme** (8): a great song to get anyone into frank ocean. kinda got old for me though cus it's pretty basic compared to the rest of the album.

kappyko: A tornado flew around my room before you came

Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain

In Southern California, much like Arizona

My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they bawl

When I'm thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)

I've been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)

I've been thinkin' 'bout you

Do you think about me still?

Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?

'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?

'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool

Enough to kick it

Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho

Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute

That's why I kissed you

Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it, though

I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)

I've been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)

I've been thinkin' 'bout you

Do you think about me still?

Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?

'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?

'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Yes, of course

I remember, how could I forget (how could I forget)?

How you feel (how you feel)?

You know you were my first time (time).

A new feel

It won't ever get old, not in my soul,

Not in my spirit, keep it alive (spirit, keep it alive)

We'll go down this road

'Til it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?

'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?

# YAWK YAWK YAWK YAWK

**strawberryswing1** (11): this beat is fucking fire.

**vapourlomo** (11): Hands down, the best Kendrick song. Honestly, that two-minute opening verse might be the greatest verse of the decade, if not the century. It's pure, raw, unfiltered fire. And then MC Eiht comes to increase Kendrick's stress even more, and things get even more paranoid and crazy. Intense Kendrick = best Kendrick.

**d4b3ss** (10): This is the best song Kendrick has ever done. And although I've probably given half of this album 10s it's not even close. This song is unbelievably good. The instrumentation, the production (the panning in the second half, and the way they distort his voice in the run up to the climax at the end), the best feature on the album, the way Kendrick works with every beat on the song flawlessly. Masterpiece of a song.

**dirdbub** (10): **YAWK YAWK YAWK YAWK**

**DraculaWeekend** (10): YAWK YAWK YAWK

**dropthehammer11** (10): Just…holy fuck.

**eklxtreme** (10): I cant put into words all the praise I have for this track. It's truly the shining moment of the album and one of the most ambitious hip-hop songs of our time. All those different flows and voices, incredible.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): I know the album is supposed to be experienced like a movie, so this works really well as the climactic point in Kendrick’s journey.

**themobiler99** (10): Here’s another song where his passionate flow and vivid lyrics transport me right into Kendrick’s story. The beat is terrifying in the best way. YAWK YAWK YAWK YAWK. The change up is amazing too with the robbery story and I love the We Major quotation. Aaaand the ending just bangs with the scratches and that high synth.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): B A N G E R. A 11 worth song. Both halves are amazing and really different, Kendrick does fantastic verses, MC Eiht offers a great part and overall it's just such a hype song.

**Leixander** (9.5): Got way better in the latter half, awesome production

**Waywatcher09** (9.5): YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!

**stansymash** (9.2): this beat makes me feel nothing but so does everything else. this may be a serious mental issue. dope track

**frazzledazzle55** (8): YAHYAHYAHYAH

raicicle: [Hook: Rita Ora]

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me

And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy

You should've known better than to mess with me harder

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya

Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 1]

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same


First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray

We went from nothing to something, liking to loving

It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?

It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you

Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you

I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between

Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean

Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long


If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song

You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored

And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer

Now sing

[Pre-hook: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]

You used to be thirsty for me

But now you wanna be set free

This is the web, web that you weave

So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
 
[Hook: Rita Ora]

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me

And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy

You should've known better than to mess with me harder

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya

Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 2]

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts

Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works

You ain't never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya

That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah

I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it

'Til you feel like you breathe for it

'Til you'll do any and everything for it

I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it

'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward

'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind

And it's nothing but me, on it (on it, on it)

Now it's me time, believe that

If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that

'Till I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit

Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh

[Pre-hook: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]

You used to be thirsty for me

But now you wanna be set free

This is the web, web that you weave

So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
 

[Hook: Rita Ora]

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me

And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy

You should've known better than to mess with me harder

Like a black widow, baby

# FAST CARS, SHOOTING STARS

**Doomulos** (11): My favorite song of all time

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Very few songs you can describe as epic and a spectacle, and this would be one of them. From the production, to the features, to the lyrics everything about this song is perfect. One of Kanye’s best songs easily

**PuggleMaster** (11): Queen Rihanna slay the chorus, everyone else did ok too.

**atlastata** (10): A perfect pop song. Not my favorite from this rate, but I absolutely would not be surprised if this wins.

**dropthehammer11** (10): Absolutely breath-taking track. Every part of this song is incredible.

**eklxtreme** (10): scholars will continue exploring the meaning of life centuries from now and they'll just come back to this song. this is the ideally produced song and it completely transcends the standards of art.




**enecks** (10): And so, after three tracks of buildup, allusions, and fantasy smokescreens - the true theme of the album reveals itself in a blunt anthemic form - Kanye's relationships with the women in his life. Make no mistake, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is a response to Taylor that is more apologetic than Kanye's past and future actions suggest. Yet how this song tackles the theme is what makes it interesting - an epic about an abusive ex-husband trying to redeem for the sins of the past. It's a song that is both richly visual and beautifully sonic in a synaesthetic way that makes it stand out even in this album of masterpieces.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): A serious 11 contender here. All of the Lights is a classic case of too many cooks in the kitchen, except the cooks actually somehow churned out a motherfucking masterpiece that burned your fucking tastebuds off. It’s the busiest, most loud track on the entire album, and it flows like a Birdman scene, constantly pushing and pulling from feature to feature, somehow weaving together this narrative that not only works, but works damn well. Clocking in at nearly 5 minutes, it gets through that runtime rather fast. The instrumental is hip hop excellence, building upon that tease in the interlude and somehow making sense despite all the clutter. I even love Fergie’s part. A perfect song.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Kanye and Lights. Name a more iconic duo. You can't.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): The beat, the horns, and the level of extra required to put this many celebrity on a single song. It’s all amazing.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): This is without a doubt one of the most perfect pop songs ever made. The arrangements and orchestration alone are enough to send me to tears. Absolutely superb

**strawberryswing1** (10): perfection

**shineflyer** (10): This is such a densely packed beat. Warm brass and tons of guest vocals, Rihanna certainly not the least of them. Those drums on the chorus are crazy.

**stansymash** (8.4): cop lights, flash lights, strobe lights, fleshlights

**sletrab07** (10): Oh, Elton John is in this? Automatic 10.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): amaaaaaaaaazing

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): One of Kanye's very best pop tracks. The production is incredible, with all sorts of drums, horns, and synths all surrounding you with sound and a huge guest list of vocalists used all in their own way to build the sound even further. The song has a few individual sections, usually broken up by the various vocalists, keeping the song constantly interesting. Kanye's verses at the beginning telling the story of a convict trying to get his life together and see his daughter paint a vivid picture of the life of someone different from himself, showing Kanye's underrated strength as a storyteller. The outro with the soaring vocals of Alicia Keys and Elton John is truly beautiful. One of his best ever singles.

**vapourlomo** (10): This is easily one of Kanye's greatest production jobs. The triumphant horns, the drumline percussion, even the gorgeous piano intro. Also, I love how he got all of these legends like Alicia Keys and Elton John on the song, and he gives a separate verse to Fergie, who raps about snorting coke. Never change, Kanye. Never change.

# CREDIT CARD DECLINED

**a.k.a “all the negative comments for this song are still positive”**

**kappyko** (10): ouch my ears it is too loud!!!

**d4b3ss** (10): Kanye making the greatest song of all time and then deciding to put Fergie on it gives me life because it shows that even gods can make unforced errors.

**xxiaverage** (9): Negative for that Fergie verse

**chipsi1** (8): Rih's feature is awesome but I felt like Fergie was unnecessary? anyway it's still really good.

**Waywatcher09** (8): Great production, but dont like all the features, definitely not a fan of fergie on here.

Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I’m heading home, I’m almost there

To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

Restraining order, can’t see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I’ll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby please
Can’t let her grow up in that ghetto university

# THE JEWEL OF AFRICA

**ffourthofjuly** (10): Five Times The Beat Drop On Pyramids Addressed Me By Name And Told Me It Was Going To Ruin My Life

**atlastata** (11): MBDTF is phenomenal and Kendrick's the best rapper alive, but the first time I heard Frank Ocean sing "Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds", I audibly gasped. Honestly? I still do. I can't explain it - there's something about that line, that verse that breaks something inside of me. I'm not even all that much of a Frank Ocean fan, but this song has stuck in my Top 6 songs ever list on Spotify and I don't know if it'll ever come out.

**frazzledazzle55** (11): even at 10 minutes long I still do not tire listening to this sprawling masterpiece.

**Kaylaboe** (11): ten minutes of perfection

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (11): magic

**themobiler99** (11): I struggled with which song to give my 11 to but it ultimately went to Pyramids. I’ll save you the assay, but this song dares to go full on progressive rock in story and structure and it couldn’t have been done better. It’s story has so many layers: character study, allegory, time travel, pimping, history, sex etc. And it goes without saying that the vocals, melodies and both halves of the beat are absolute perfection.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): THIS SONG IS LITERALLY FUCKING PERFECTION OMG. 11/10 INTRO, 11/10 STORYTELLING, 11/10 BEAT, 11/10 BEAT SWITCH, 11/10 OUTRO, EVERYTHING ABOUT THE SONG IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT ISN'T MENTIONED AS ONE OF THE GREATEST SONGS OF ALL TIME BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

**VodkaInsipido** (11): A 10 minute song with a beat switch made of an electric guitar comparing a pimp to Cleopatra could easily be a rock song made in the second half of the past century. But this time it’s not. It’s a slow, love making R&B odyssey that marks the half-point between the first and the second part of **channel ORANGE**. Frank has the magic touch to show both a story in the first part (Cleopatra becoming a figure of dishonor in Egypt for being Marc Anthony’s mistress, all told from his view) and describing perfectly an ambient of love in the second part. Both stories feedback each other, being the clearest example how the cheetahs in the first part might also refer to Cheetahs, a chain of striptease clubs in the US. But it’s also a tour de force in production and composition. Although at first the song it’s a slow R&B jam it later evolves in a song that has been compared to almost everything: Michael Jackson’s pop, Prince’s Purple Rain, european EDM… and that John Mayer guitar solo. Everything works to make a masterpiece.

**chipsi1** (10): UGH, this song makes me so mad because it's just straight perfection, even as I'm typing this I'm still debating whether I should give my 11 to this or *Lost*, but this is still really great.

**dirdbub** (10): this song does not feel 10 minutes long

**DraculaWeekend** (10): What an epic song. It's so good that I don’t even mind that it's 10 minutes long

**dropthehammer11** (10): Nearly 10 minutes of a masterpiece. The climax and peak of this album.

**eklxtreme** (10): an ANTHEM. the production is so amazing and I love the narrative that he tells.

**enecks** (10): And here we have this album at its most awe-inspiringly magnificent. A near 10 minute epic that spans thousands of years, many forms of music, and yet remains focused and one of the most sensual, sexy songs ever written. Just as the lyrics are broad enough to go from Cleopatra to a modern day stripper the song is broad enough to both do throwback R+B, a trippy transition, modern R+B, and one of the best guitar solos of the 2010s. In a rate without MBDTF in it, this would get my 11.

**ExtraEater** (10): like a glamorous broadway production about vegas and history

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This is one of those songs you can lose yourself in, and I still think it’s the best thing Frank’s ever released. The sheer scope of this track is a testament to his artistry.

**kappyko** (10): a mind-blowing experience.

**Mudkip1** (10): wow this was incredible from start to finish. so far this album hasn't been all that for me but this song was WOW

**NFZHunter** (10): my fave song on the album, the production, lyrics, and vocals on this are so so so good

**PossumAloysuis** (10): The fact that he dropped a 9 minute 2 part suite as his first single for his debut really tells you everything you need to know about him. I don't have enough 11s to give out.

**robbiec\_** (10): iconic synths oh my weakness, I used to dislike the second half of this song but it's really grown on me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I didn’t even have to listen to this to know my score. Pyramids is a masterpiece, a long and winding track that feels like a cinematic experience, spanning nearly 10 minutes and two parts. Part one features a brilliant and beautiful synth that provides great contrast to the groove that Frank oozes throughout all his verses. The song transforms into Part Two, which is where the metaphor behind Cleopatra becomes more evident. This juxtaposition of ancient matriarchy and modern prostitution and the dynamic of control and relationships with these themes is just divine. And when the second part’s synths come in, they’re a transformation of those from the first, and it’s easy to see comparisons to The Weeknd’s earlier work in structure, bearing some similarities to something like House of Balloons/Glass Table Girls or Kiss Land/John Carpenter. And the outro is long but necessary, a gorgeous guitar solo that just puts the finishing touches on this brilliant piece of music.

**vapourlomo** (10): Anyone who's favorite Frank Ocean song isn't Pyramids is just trying to be contradictory. This production is early-'10s electro at its finest, and the dual-story of the two Cleopatras is incredibly clever. If only Frank knocked out more bangers like this.

# HE HAS KILLED CLEOPATRA

**MrSwearword** (7): chop five minutes off and we're good

**xxiaverage** (7): Really only bearable when you're in the mood for that B-side

**shineflyer** (6): it's cool that this uses electronic influence and all. I just wish it had more recognizable melody to the vocals, though.

Kanye dominates the top 2 of the rate. Power, featuring an iconic King Crimson sample, is a sprawling maximalist song with great lyricism from Kanye and a hook that made it the go-to song for every other video game and movie trailer you’ve seen in the last 7 years.

---

# HE KNOWS HE’S SO FUCKING GIFTED

**SkyBlade79** (11): This, is in my opinion, Kanye’s peak, or at the very least one of his best songs. It combines flair, sass, pride, and deep meaning into one masterpiece. The sample fits perfectly, and the vocalizations are never mentioned enough. The end has made me tear up on so many occasions. The thought of the narrator of the song reaching his peak, only to die because there’s nothing else to strive towards… it really paints a depressing image about how dangerous power can truly be. A lot of my opinion is due to the sharp nostalgia to younger, better years, playing Saint’s Row 3 with my best friend with this song blasting.

**sletrab07** (11): THIS MAKES ME WANT TO SET MY HOUSE ON FIRE AND WALK AWAY WITHOUT LOOKING BACK, FUCK EVERYTHING

**chipsi1** (10): Ugh, I love everything about this song. especially the samples.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Get hype. Relistening made me realize just how much is going on here and how everything works so well together. Also, this song gave us one of Kanye's best music videos.

**dropthehammer11** (10): One of the ultimate pump-up songs ever. Not to mention, this was Kanye’s comeback after the Taylor incident. Incredible return to form.

**jamesfog** (10): Iconic

**PossumAloysuis** (10): The fact that this was a single is still crazy. The King Crimson sample is fucking amazing

**Raykel** (10): The "At the end of day goddammit I'm killing this shit. I know damn well yall feelin this shit," line alone gave me the confidence to clear my skin, find a job, get honor roll in college, and get rid of toxic friends.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I don’t know if I need to explain why this is greatness. POWER has MBDTF’s most impressive instrumental, a movie trailer-scoring meticulous and maximalist song that bursts with energy, leading to this batshit crazy outro (“now this will be a beautiful death, jumping out the window!”). It’s just absolute perfection, with Kanye firing on all cylinders here.

**themobiler99** (10): What an epic track. This kicked off the MBDTF era with class and style and (ha) POWER. Kanye absolutely goes in with his verses and the beat is incredibly hype and creative. The way Kanye infuses such disparate samples into a cohesive whole will never cease to amaze me. This song also has some of my favorite drums in a hip hop beat ever.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): so many fucking perfect lines and so much anger and power and I just cannot. (Will I give everything a 10? Tune in at the 8:00 edition to find out)

**stansymash** (10): hot dooooog

Piccprincess: ###WAS GONNA POST THIS IF RUNAWAY LOST BUT HERE WE ARE

[Verse 1]  
It was so nice throwing big parties  
Jump into the pool from the balcony  
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea  
And there are no rules when you show up here  
Bass beat rattling the chandelier  
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year  

[Pre-Chorus]  
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?  
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates  

[Chorus]  
This is why we can't have nice things, darling  
Because you break them  
I had to take them away  
This is why we can't have nice things, honey  
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?  
This is why we can't have nice things  

[Verse 2]  
It was so nice being friends again  
There I was, giving you a second chance  
But then you stabbed in the back while shaking my hand  
And therein lies the issue  
Friends don't try to trick you  
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you  
And so I took an axe to a mended fence  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately  
If only you weren't so shady  

[Chorus]  
This is why we can't have nice things, darling  
Because you break them  
I had to take them away  
This is why we can't have nice things, honey  
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?  
This is why we can't have-  

[Bridge]  
Here's a toast to my real friends  
They don't care about the he-said-she-said  
And here's to my baby  
He ain't reading what they call me lately  
And here's to my momma  
Had to listen to all this drama  
And here's to you  
‘Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do  
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face  

[Chorus]  
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (darling)  
Because you break them  
I had to take them away  
This is why we can't have nice things, honey  
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?  
This is why we can't have nice things, darling  
(And here's to my real friends)  
Because you break them  
I had to take them away  
(And here's to my baby)  
This is why we can't have nice things, darling  
(He didn't care about that he-said-she-said)  
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?  
This is why we can't have nice things

**Lowest Scores:** (1.5 x1) mokitsu 

This song is often considered Kanye’s magnum opus and the emotional peak of MBDTF. Featuring a slow build-up of piano and a long outro of inaudible autotuned singing, it’s pretty much the goat tbh

---
# PUTTING UP WITH HIS SHIT FOR WAY TOO LONG

**frankiefrankiefrank** (11): The fact that this song is 9 minutes long and doesn’t feel excessive is a testament to how good it is. Runaway encapsulates everything that makes Kanye who he is.

**MrSwearword** (11): easily one of Kanye's best songs in existence

**Verdantshade** (11): definitely kanye's best song - ultralight beam is the closest he's come to this imo. everything about this from the single note playing in the intro to the vocoder outro is perfect. there's so much emotion and self-awareness within it

**Waywatcher09** (11): Everything about this song SCREAMS Kanye. The description of himself, the lines of sending a dick pic, the foul pusha feature, the 4 min outro. And its Perfect

**zamomattel** (11): (inaudible autotune noises)

**atlastata** (10): The all-time greatest Kanye song now and forever. If I could give a second 11, this would be it. The piano, the guitar/synth/whatever else is on this track, everything works. Even Pusha T's rediculous verse is perfect.

**chipsi1** (10): an obvious 10. perfect song IMO.

**d4b3ss** (10): I cried to this song once. The outro started and it sounded like Kanye was trying so so so so so hard to be understood but it was still coming out muddled and even though I knew what he was saying that made it even more tragic because he's really trying to communicate but there's a barrier (in this case a vocoder) that makes it so hard to say something so simple and god i'm tearing up again rn. Also Pusha T is incredible here.

**Doomulos** (10): Art with a capital A

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Such a memorable chorus

**dropthehammer11** (10): I mean, self-explanatory.

**shineflyer** (11): This song feels like it's got emotion put into it. Like, a sense of "I know I'm a terrible person, and you deserve better than me." It's a bit heartbreaking. And often I mention songs not needing to be as long as they are, but this one earns its length.

**eklxtreme** (10): it's a perfectly crafted song that's impossible not to love. I'm not one of the people that adores the ending, but this song is still a masterpiece.

**ExtraEater** (10): like a mirage of deserted hollywood, a glorious mess of a celebrity in formal clothes running around looking for answers

**jamesfog** (10): Masterpiece

**NFZHunter** (10): Also one of my fave Kanye songs, the piano on this song is iconic and Pusha's guest verse fits surprisingly well.

# ALWAYS FINDING SOMETHING WRONG

**SkyBlade79** (6): It loses like 3 points for the outro, but it’s pretty great besides that.

editor’s note: the only person i have ever seen with this opinion.

# TOASTS FOR THE DOUCHEBAGS (THE ESSAYS)

**enecks** (11): And here we have the magnum opus - of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, of Kanye West's Discography, of 2010, of the 2010s, of hip hop history. This is a towering, magnificent achievement - a celebration of the grand and epic power of music in a painfully intimate and personal perspective. It begins with one note repeated for twenty seconds - a call for attention, a zen focusing moment. Then a miracle happens - a different key plays. Here is the joy of music encapsulated in its most fundamental form - the joy of one sound turning into another. The melody builds up until it explodes in a traditional beat, yet remains the driving force of the song. A layer of samples offer support - "We've got you" and prepare for the imminent masterpiece - "ladies and gentlemen". The song's hook is a profound mix of the personal and the public - a toast for the douchebags, assholes, and scumbags of the world. Yet this is far from self-congratulatory - Kanye begs the person depicted in the song (which could be a metaphor for Amber Rose, the media, the public, any women in his life, Taylor Swift, or Kanye himself depending on who you ask) to run away as fast as they can. As the hook fades into verses, painful and embarrassing details come to light - dick pics, addiction to "hoodrats" and an inability to properly connect come up. Pusha T's verse strips the glamour of the dark fantasy away and reveals it to be a hollow cover for deep personal failings with brands being more valued and detailed than whomever he supposedly loves. Kanye follows this off with a tragic gut punch of a verse that recalls 808s and Heartbreaks at its most emotionally raw, with delivery good enough to make every word a tear-jerker. This is the verse that a lot of people describe as Kanye's informal apology to Taylor - yet within the context of the album it is the reveal of his Achilles Heel - his lack of romantic and intimacy is damaging his connections with whomever the subject of the song is. It is an admission of defeat and failure that makes the return to that iconic hook all the more bittersweet. After this last hook comes the defining musical moment of the 21st century - a vocoder guitar solo that takes the metaphor of "autotune as a metaphor for repressed emotions" from 808s + Heartbreaks and inverts it - here the emotions are too profoundly intense to express through mere words, rather they must be expressed through the universal complexities of music. It's a wail of agony that comes with birth, death, and the life in between those moments. Whatever Kanye's saying behind it can be barely made out - "I'ma be honest" and snippets of the hook are the only bits that can be clearly identified. It's indicative of this song's great paradox - though it is deeply personal to Kanye West, it is also powerfully universal in its emotional weight. To make a song this good takes talent, time (this must have taken more than the 5000 hours that Power required), and genius. This is one of the best songs of all time - in a few decade's time it will be remembered up there with the songs that people wished they made these days.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. Rarely do you get a track that feels like a lifetime between its opening and closing. Runaway not only feels like this, but also a storied one. It starts off simple enough, before exploding into perhaps the most somber and emotional instrumental on the entire album. When Kanye makes his entrance, it’s shockingly honest. Not that Kanye isn’t honest - he’s obviously built a whole career out of sincerity, but on Runaway, he’s glass house vulnerable. He offers a toast to the douchebags, leading into the end of the chorus: “runaway as fast as you can.” And it’s a long chorus, but it doesn’t overstay its welcome, building upon itself, crashing with vocal samples and leading into one of Pusha T’s strongest verses. And Kanye comes back in at the end, and he’s sadder than ever, and everything just coalesces into this perfect outro. A great track, you say. But then, the song doesn’t end. You check the runtime and see you’re only slightly halfway done. Kanye performs the rest of the song through a vocoder, a muffled release that somehow just is executed with nothing less than perfection, with some words barely being able to be made out, and most being lost to the ether. It’s somehow more impactful than the battering that happens before it, and it ends abruptly and leaves you uneasy, bursting right into the next track.

deleted: **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (11): My favorite Kanye song, and my favorite song of all time. From the very beginning and its instantly recognizable piano key, the song is just a perfect climax and peak for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. While the whole album to this point was telling a thematic narrative, this song is like its own contained beautiful tragedy. It's melancholic, mournful, egotistic, and just incredible. The song is over nine minutes long, but I feel like removing even a single second would be disingenuous. Every element of the layered production works to the absolute advantage of the song, from the constantly present piano riff to the buzzing background synth to the subtle drumbeat to the mourning strings. The lyrics just bring across so well the heartbreak and sadness and anger and regret of the emotional cultural rollercoaster that was Kanye's life at the time, with Pusha T's intentionally brash and obnoxious verse serving as a perfect counterpoint to Kanye's quiet regret, which Kanye's perfect delivery brings across so well. Just when the song would end for many other artists, Runaway is only halfway over. The outro, with Kanye's voice blasted and processed through a vocoder to the point where he ranges from being almost able to be heard to completely incomprehensible. It's like he's crying out to the listener, but the song is so distorted that we can't even hear him. It's a really sobering and interesting musical moment in itself, but the length of the outro just makes it so tragic. It feels like I'm hearing Kanye break down in music, it's just incredible. For me, this song really is Kanye's magnum opus, like its own little miniature perfect project in the middle of a larger perfect album. It's no surprise to me that Kanye chose it as the centerpiece for the short film or even MBDTF in general. Runaway really deserves every bit of its praise, because it is genuinely that perfect. It shows the layers to Kanye's psyche that you can't get from a meme or interview or even most other Kanye songs. If someone asked me why I'm a big fan of Kanye in the wake of his Tweets or rants or whatever, I'd probably point to Runaway. Because as complicated or divisive a person as Kanye is, he still was able to make this beautiful, fantastic, sobering, mournful piece of music.

**vapourlomo**: The GOAT album. Period. Regardless of genre or era.

**eklxtreme**: a perfectly crafted masterpiece. every single track is so intricately produced and some of these are the most beautiful melodies I've heard. I find myself falling in love with this album over and over.

**DraculaWeekend**: I didn't realize how many great songs were on this album. If only the album cover was better…

**Verdantshade**: this is my least favourite kendrick album out of his big 3 but that's because to pimp a butterfly got me into rap music and damn has been a huge part of my year

**frankiefrankiefrank**: Kendrick's abilities as a storyteller are unparalleled.

**stansymash**: good album, m.a.a.d max fury road

**shineflyer**: This is one of the only albums I've heard that truly feels more like a storyline than just an album - the recordings probably have a lot to do with that.

**dirdbub**: oh sorry, a Christian album :/

**Leixander**: Listened to this in full for the first time and I love it! Kendrick is really talented, it is no surprise he is this successful.

**PossumAloysuis**: A sprawling, engrossing masterpiece of an album.

**vapourlomo**: Still Kendrick's best album.

**eklxtreme**: it's unbelievable how perfect and cohesive kendrick made this. not only do these songs slap, they also blow my mind, especially due to his intense poetic lyricism.

**DraculaWeekend**: After relistening to this album for the rate, it is clear that this is Kendrick's best. So many solid songs.

deleted: # channel ORANGE

---

**Overall average**: 8.547

---

**Verdantshade**: zayn wishes he could make an album half as good as this. when blonde came out i thought frank couldn't beat channel orange but he managed to - goes to show how good this album is and he's somehow even better now

**frankiefrankiefrank**: It doesn't have as many catchy moments as the other albums, but Frank makes each track feel incredibly personal through his lyrics and voice, and the music is beautifully produced.

**stansymash**: frank is a top man!

**shineflyer**: This album is warm and chill and all that, but I do feel like often Frank's vocals are a bit directionless - without a strong melody to them. There certainly are tracks where that isn't true, though.

**dirdbub**: I always hear this album as more of a maroon than an orange but whatever

**Leixander**: Also one of my favorite albums. I wish Blonde was as good as this too.

**strawberryswing1**: I'm surprised my average is so high honestly, these tracks are above average by themselves but this album dragged on and on and I didn't love it. Not repeatable really for me.

**PossumAloysuis**: One of the best R&B albums of the decade. An eclectic masterpiece

**vapourlomo**: It's okay but Blonde blew it out of the water (also, if we needed a third album here, I would've picked Run The Jewels 2 or Acid Rap or even Kaleidoscope Dream if we're expanding what counts as "hip-hop," but I'm probably in the minority with that opinion)

**eklxtreme**: frank's vocals are just captivating and he has writes songs really well. this album flows really cohesively and it's pretty great for a summer night. some tracks really don't need to be on the album but overall it's really great.

**Sunny\_Waterloo**: heaven

**DraculaWeekend**: I don't think I've ever listened to this album fully, but it was alright. I just feel like this album will be destroyed on Day 1 tbh.
