Out first is Frank’s tale of his first love, a drug-dealing stoner. One of the most divisive tracks of the rate, Frank’s narrative resonated with some, but clearly not enough. /r/popheads is clearly a proud supporter of D.A.R.E.

---
# FLYING HIGH

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): I legit believe that Frank's "you're always smoking in the house..." is the greatest vocal introduction in any song ever. I mean it's so fucking smooth and perfect. SO GOOD

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.5): Frank's falsetto at the beginning is like an angel tbh, and the way each verse is different keeps the song interesting. This is one of the more subtle tracks on the album, and has more of a Blonde feeling than any of the other songs.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9.5): Another smooth, chill track. I love the synths that come in on this one, it's another cinematic touch production-wise that really makes Channel Orange a special album.

**NFZHunter** (9.5): I get this song stuck in my head so much, and the storytelling on this one is great

**zamomattel** (8.5): one of the most interesting beats on the album

**vapourlomo** (8): Production-wise, Blonde is far better than Channel Orange, but Pilot Jones is definitely an exception. The minimalist, bleary-eyed production matches Frank's vocals so well.

---
# ICE COLD

**frazzledazzle55** (5): least favourite song on an otherwise amazing album

**ignitethephoenix** (5): Just forgettable sounding, though once again Frank sounds great.

**MrSwearword** (4): a love letter to a pot dealer...gurl

**shineflyer** (3): One hundred percent atmosphere. a nice atmosphere, but that's it

**eklxtreme** (0): the lyrics and the song in general are kinda bland

awesometuck1559: # #35: Real feat. Anna Wise

**Average:** 7.556 **// Total Points:** 589.4 **// Controversy:** 1.658

**Highest scores:** (11 x1) eklxtreme (10 x7) d4b3ss, MrSwearword, PossumAloysuis, robbiec\_, strawberryswing1, VodkaInsipido, Waywatcher09 (9.8 x2) frankiefrankiefrank, Sunny\_Waterloo (9.1 x1) ZachArch18 (9 x3) -dolantello-, packfan567, therokinrolla (8.9 x1) TightBlackJeans (8.5 x5) BearlyEvenAPun, jamesfog, rhetoric\_supreme, sletrab07, ThereIsNoSantaClaus 

**Lowest Scores:** (2 x1) whatyourheartdesires (3 x1) xxiaverage 

Arguably the realest song in this rate, this track off the back half of *good kid, m.A.A.d city*  sees frequent collaborator Anna Wise tell us how real she is. Clearly, some people didn’t care.

---
# REAL

**eklxtreme** (11): if sing about me was the ultimate climax of the movie, real is the sweet, touching closing family scene where life gets better and inspires the artist of our generation. I know it's not the best chorus but it's still all-around beautifully crafted.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): I know this song is gonna be ridiculously disrespected but I want you all to know that it's a incredible song and deserves better. It's been one of my favorites since the album dropped and I love it everytime I listen to it. Very underrated

**robbiec\_** (10): oH ANOTHER banger

**Waywatcher09** (10): I love the hook, I love the reversed third verse, I love how I can relate to this, but what love got to do with it when I don’t love myself???

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I know a lot of people hate the “really really real” in this track, but I don’t mind it at all. Anna Wise being on background vocals the entire project makes for this track to be the culmination of all that, and it works well.

---
# FAKE

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): not a big fan of the hook, but I do like Kendrick's verses quite a bit. Still though, it feels like a level below most songs in the album.

**themobiler99** (8): This is a good track, but after Sing About Me, it just has no impact.

**Raykel** (6.5): Why is he dragging out the end of this album?

**vapourlomo** (5): Undoubtably the weak point of GKMC. Kinda boring, too long, and very skippable.

**SkyBlade79** (4): the voice in the hook is annoying

---
# PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK OF HEARING THE WORD ‘REAL’ 

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Nice sounding but a bit to repetitive for me.

**Verdantshade** (7): this could have been a really good song if the hook was less annoying

**Leixander** (6): Kinda repetitive after a while

**shineflyer** (5.5): the lyrics are cool, and the beat is ok. I was hoping for something more from the chorus, though.

**Lowest Scores:** (2 x2) shineflyer, xxiaverage 

The second song out from Kendrick’s sophomore album is a love letter to his city of birth featuring one of his primary mentors, Dr. Dre. Unfortunately, some popheads didn’t enjoy hearing about Kendrick’s favorite city.

---
# NEW FAITH OF KENDRICK LAMAR

**PossumAloysuis** (10): I gotta give this a 10 for the Just Blaze beat alone. Great outro

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Super underrated. Amazing AMAZING Just Blaze production here. This isn’t the first Kendrick & Dre collab (The Recipe), and it surely wasn’t the last. Dre gives a damn great verse here, and I don’t really care if he wrote it or not, it’s perfect for this track. Compton is a damn perfect finale to this epic, and I find that this track is underrated as a whole.

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): Underrated track on this album, killer feature by Dre.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.2): Really great conclusion to the album both musically and thematically.

**robbiec\_** (9): student becomes the master

**vapourlomo** (9): I've been told a lot of people don't like this song, as it's a bit too triumphant of an ending to a profoundly sad and dark story. It's a bit too easy. But...it bangs.

**NFZHunter** (8.2): Not a whole lot to say about this one, good lyrics and production but not super remarkable compared to the absolute genius on this album.

---
# DRE HATERS

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): not good enough for an outro

**Waywatcher09** (7.5): a good song, but fails to be the celebratory and ending song it’s supposed to be. Also not a big fan of dr. Dre.

**MrSwearword** (6): Kendrick good, Dre unnecessary

**Verdantshade** (6): feels celebratory but purposeless

**zamomattel** (4.5): most uninventive song in the rate tbh

**shineflyer** (2): I really don't care for Dre most of the time. This is no exception. I appreciate what it represents on the album, at least.

**xxiaverage** (2): The oatmeal of this album

# SHIT FEELING TOO GOOD

**ffourthofjuly** (10): panty dropper, pussy popper

**PossumAloysuis** (10): Any song that equates a woman's vagina to a gorgeous sunset is a 10 in my book. Pullout game weak as fuck

**Waywatcher09** (8.5): Love the spoken lines and then frank repeating them.

**dropthehammer11** (9): A very moody, layered track. Very suiting follow up to the intro.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): yes dad fuck me up

---
# ABANDON MISSION

**zamomattel** (6): one of those kind of directionless seeming Frank songs

**shineflyer** (4): boring to be honest

# DON’T NO ONE DISRUPT NIRVANA

**themobiler99** (10): Frank here kills it again with making such a foreign topic for me few so relatable through music. “You used to hit it raw, cuz she was and you are madly involved,” is a very relatable line for me, so getting me to feel that opens me up to understanding the “shucking and jiving, stealing and robbing, to get the fixin that you’re itchin for”....While I otherwise might hear that and be like “ugh crack addicts bleh.” Also the drums on this track are legendary.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I love the instrumental here. It’s so lush and has a ton of depth, and I think it’s really all those drums, crashing and crashing. When you’re given respite, it’s shortly and for the chorus, and then it comes back crashing again. I’m not as much of a fan of Frank’s delivery of CRACK ROCK CRACK ROCK, but the verses are great.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Frank stays in a lane he knows he can do on this one. Smooth beat with some chilly keys mixed in and really great vocals and wordplay. He knows what's up.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.2): The jazzy chord progression on this is awesome, but I wish the production did more. Frank does a good job at storytelling in the lyrics and then relating it to wider social commentary.

**Verdantshade** (7): one of the darkest songs on the album. love the drums, they're quite bluesy

# NINJA TURTLES

**PossumAloysuis** (10): You know when an album starts with a prayer, it's on some other shit. The atmosphere created here is without equal. Y'all watch out for them hood rats

**themobiler99** (10): Amazing. Incredibly vivid and relatable storytelling, and you really feel like you’re right there in the car with him as he’s narrating what’s going on. Just the perfect introduction to Kendrick’s narrative style on this album.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): king of S T O R Y T E L L I N G

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.3): This song’s production has a very cinematic quality to it that gives off a trippy, Twilight Zone feel.

**rhetoric\_supreme** (9.1): Such an underrated track, perfect start to them album

**chipsi1** (9): Great opener.

**dropthehammer11** (9): What a chilling, haunting beat. Sets the tone of the album so well and establishes the narrative.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): what an opening scene...so eerie, intense, and ambitious

---
# HOOD RATS

**MrSwearword** (7): trying to mix "Jesus Saves" with getting pussy is jarring to me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I know people love this, but it’s probably my least favorite Kendrick intro ever.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Love how Kendrick tells a story, but i would never come back to this.

**Verdantshade** (6): it sets up the story of the album well but i find it awfully boring

**shineflyer** (5): sets the tone of the album, but not a standout track on its own

# BUT YOU’RE BEAUTIFUL TO ME

**eklxtreme** (9): really chill funky production that still feels nocturnal. interesting lyrics here.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Monks is one of the most underrated tracks on the album. It’s a super vibey track with some amazing instrumentation and Frank just doing his thing. Again, the drums here are amazing, and it’s just a really lush and beautiful song.

**NFZHunter** (8.3): Not going to lie I always think this one is just part of Bad Religion bc it fits thematically and it's also not super memorable

**vapourlomo** (8): Mmmm that groove is HOT. Love some slap-bass and jazz drums.

**xxiaverage** (8): RIDE ME WITHOUT THE HAAANDS

# THERE’S A MONSOON THAT NEVER ENDS

**Waywatcher09** (7.5): weakest song of the album, but still decent.

---
# MILK AND HONEY

**DraculaWeekend** (10): What a way to close the album. Chills

**enecks** (10): The personal is political in this conclusion - which I find to be a fascinating foreshadowing of Yeezus' more political and explicit tones. Also ending any magnum opus album with a tiny bit of applause is my favourite "only you can get away with this" cliche.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): A lot of times artists sample speeches to underscore the message of their work and it comes off as pretentious/redundant, but this speech is perfect for the song. Also, a lot of tracks where they slowly deconstruct the production to bring it to a close it can sap the music of its energy, so I’m glad Kanye found a way to do it without losing any of the song’s drive.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): R.I.P. to Gil Scott Heron. Love how he ties up the overall themes of the album very well. A stellar ending to a stellar album

**rhetoric\_supreme** (9.5): giving this such a high score not because it's fantastic as a standalone track but going off of the build of Lost In The World this tracks wraps this masterpiece up perfectly

**shineflyer** (5): This is really just an outro from LiTW to end the album with. But it's a good one.

**Verdantshade** (5): why is this a separate track? it's a great way to end the album but it shouldn't be a standalone track

# GOOD KIDS

**DraculaWeekend** (10): The production on this song is just amazing

**enecks** (10): When I listened to this track for the first time when I did my first cover-to-cover listen of this album I was shocked at how good this was in particular - HOW HADN'T I HEARD THIS BEFORE? It's just so stunning!

**PossumAloysuis** (10): One of the more underrated songs definitely. It's so well structured and composed it's breathtaking. It needs more love

**themobiler99** (10): I feel like I’m saying this a lot about all these GKMC tracks, but it’s constantly true: Amazing beat, god level flow, extremely vivid lyrics.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.6): The layered vocals on the pre-chorus and Pharrell’s production take this song to the next level.

**eklxtreme** (9.5): impeccable production from Pharrell and a really great narrative

**NFZHunter** (9.5): v underrated track, the way Kendrick uses the verses to compare gang violence and police violence is really clever.

---
# BAD KIDS

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): I see people complaining about m.A.A.d city 'overshadowing' good kid, and it's like well yeah, I mean one of them is clearly the superior song.

**zamomattel** (6.5): the beat reminds me of video game music, and im not not into it

**Verdantshade** (6): maybe it's just the placement of the song in the album but i can't get into it - the entire sequence from bitch don't kill my vibe to sing about me is perfect but i always find myself skipping this track

**shineflyer** (3): not very interesting musically, that woodwind is the most interesting part

---
# WHERE’S PHARRELL?

**ffourthofjuly** (10): underrated but am i the only one who didn't know pharrell was featured on this song until now

**stansymash** (8.8): woah pharell is on this?

**Waywatcher09** (8.5): wait this was Pharrell? Anyway, weak hook, good verses.

# THIS SHIT IS FUCKIN RIDICULOUS

**d4b3ss** (10): how is jay z so much better on this than on Monster wtf was he thinking.

**dropthehammer11** (10): The beat on this thing is absolutely spectacular. EVERY VERSE IS WILD. Such a great fucking song.

**enecks** (10): This song makes decadence, money, and fame sound bleak and isolated. Relationships don't deliver valuable connections, the attention just delivers slander and pain - it is fucking ridiculous. An impressive variety of good verses from both established acts (JAY Z more than makes up for his Monster verse here) and acts that I have never heard of until I looked up the credits for this song. One of the more minor tracks in this album, but also a magnificent masterpiece in its own right.

**Leixander** (10): THIS SONG IS SO UNDERAPPRECIATED BECAUSE OF ITS LENGTH, the beat, the verses, the hook ahhh I love this song

**PossumAloysuis** (10): One of the best posse cuts of the decade. Everyone here fucking killed it especially Jay. Straight vintage Wu-Tang grimy shit

**robbiec\_** (10): iconic synth and is like a warning shot for the ones to come in Runaway

# THE HOMIES

**chipsi1** (10): was a contender for 11. it's a really detailed song and Kendrick absolutely did his thing here.

**eklxtreme** (10): Kendrick is able to paint a vivid scene with an intense flow and production

**enecks** (10): Kendrick has that special ability to tell a story with his lyrics that only the greatest rappers have. An incredible beat too.

**PossumAloysuis** (10): An absolute gem. The creepy, eerie sample sets the tone so well. If I could give this another 11 I really would.

**themobiler99** (10): One of the best self contained stories on the album. As a middle class nerdy white guy, this more than most other songs in hip hop really puts me in the “action of the hood.” So many songs talk about life in the ghetto and “being a gangster” but here I actually feel like I can see and feel everything Kendrick did.

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): The message of this song is so gripping. The beat change is awesome.

**NFZHunter** (9.5): A super vivid storytelling track, Kendrick really demonstrates his mastery of rap in this song.

---
# YA BISH

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): the storytelling is again really good, but it's not very impressively musically (to me, at least). Also that part at the end goes on for a little too long.

**Waywatcher09** (8): Again great storytelling, but the production is little bit boring.

**shineflyer** (7): I wouldn't listen to this casually, but in the context of the album storyline, it's extremely effective.

**kappyko** (6): intriguing lyrically but i've never been one for lyrics i'm sorry and that skit
