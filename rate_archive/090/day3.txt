deleted: Considering Poet and Sleepsong are both still in and all, I really recommend listening to Disc 2 of All This Bad Blood if you haven't already. Personally it's the disc of ATBB I like the most, it's where most of my favorites are concentrated.

(I'm not complaining about it not being in the rate though lol, it would be unreasonable to require everyone to rate an album twice as long as the other 2)

an 11 contender for sure. I vividly remember hearing this song for the first time on radio disney, it was apart of this feature where they'd have a certian song every week and you had to go online and vote on wether it should be added into their rotation or dropped and i just instantly fell in love with it. Something about it is just so calming to me and It just works really well for me.
 
---
 
#Self Care Legends
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): This is, in my opinion, a great pump-up anthem.
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): the first 3 tracks of this album are so top tier.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): WE FOUND LOVE IN A HOPELESS PLACE | no but seriously oh my goodness i forgot about how amazing this song is. it almost stole my 11 from Bastille. this should've been the Counting Stars leftover hit instead of Love Runs Out. actually, no, it should've been bigger than Counting Stars. just wonderful.
 
**napsandnetflix** (10): i will never lose ryan tedder
 
**skargardin** (10): HOW havent I heard this before??
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): goes so hard. ryan tedder is a god
 
**radiofan15** (9.2): "ugh yes bring me those 80s synths kings, i need serotonin... wait, are those guitars and a edm drop? ewww why do straight white males have do ruin everything?" - typical r/popheads moment if the sub had existed in 2013.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): This honestly sounds like a ripoff of Wake Me Up by Avicii but it still kinda slaps
 
**vhqv1997** (9): This is a Coldplay track. And I'm a filthy Coldplay stan.
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): Cute
 
**modulum83** (8.5): This makes me feel like I'm flying above the city at night.
 
**fishingfor8** (8): it's very relaxed
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): generic but it bops
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): Idk why but I remembered this being better than it was. I was waiting for it to kick in and it kinda just stayed at 9 level energy for the whole song
 
**ManofOranges** (8): I don't mind this song, but I don't love love it.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): bad songwriting good production
 
**waluigiest** (8): he said “awoo”
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Love the drop during the chorus
 
#EDM? Is that a drug?
 
**duhchappers** (6): Sounds like a pretty good Marshmallow song from last year
 
**vayyiqra** (6): Kind of weak lyrics but musically I really like this
 
**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): the verses were fine but that chorus and drop...no ma’am
 
**axestogrind** (3): Sounds like a R3hab remix of a normal OneRepublic song, the EDM drop is certainly a choice esp after having already established the folksy-pop soundscape of the album.
 
**fadedblue09** (0): I don’t like how the song sounds so deliberately half-assed (that dancepop breakdown? ugh) that it sounds desperately begging for a remix (and unsurprisingly, it did).

Popheads said deep cut rights! and they were right! This song is an absolute banger in every since and im glad that we all collectively realize it
 
---
 
**axestogrind** (10): Used to listen to this on repeat while reading Percy Jackson I miss being 13 :(
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): This is a headbanger.
 
**duhchappers** (10): I love this song. The synths, the vocals, the triumphant chorus, everything just puts me in a better mood. I wish Imagine Dragons still made music this well put together.
 
**fadedblue09** (10): Love the new wave vibes on this. How was this not a single while It’s Time gets to be one?
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): I remember when I knew of this song in 2013 despite it not being a single and I felt like someone who was super knowledgeable about the whole music scene just cause I knew of a song that wasn’t a single sksksk
 
**ManofOranges** (10): This is a hit this is a hit. I wasn't expecting to be immediately so engaged in this album but this song immediately grabbed my attention.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): the best Imagine Dragons song, and one of my favorite songs of all time
 
**Stryxen** (10): this was my favourite song in 2013. And I was so right.
 
**1998tweety** (9.5): Bop, love the 80s vibes.
 
**radiofan15** (8.9): Love the (actual) 80s influence on the sound...
 
**modulum83** (8.7): cool 80s synth sounds in this, what a bop
 
**wavingwolves** (8.5): a lot of interesting choices in the production of this song. sounds good, feels good
 
**DaHumanTorch** (8): the electronic-tinged production on this near the bridge really surprised me. i liked this a lot
 
**vhqv1997** (8): I love the futuristic sound, i just wish the chorus was stronger
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This feels kinda ’80s? Or maybe I just hear a synth and think that.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): hey yeah
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): haven't heard this song in what must be years but it still sounded so familiar
 
**vayyiqra** (7): Okay nobody told me that this band made synth-rock bangers like this. This is like U2 before they sold out and got wimpy, or Coldplay when they were still good and without the crooning.
 
**TCHALLA1966** (4): well she’s cute I guess

Every time I hear this song I remember my 8th grade english teacher and how we spent a day in class reading icarus and comparing it to the jurrasic park books talking about how the moral of the stories are about men being punished when they try and play god, but when im not listening to it I kinda forget that it exsist.

#PJO Stans
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): hate to waste my 11 once again but i gotta go with my heart. this was my most played song for like over a year and i still love it very much.
 
**axestogrind** (10): I didn't realise I liked this song that much but the moment it started playing Dan Smith kicked down my door and plucked out every single hair I had to leave me permanently scalped, he left after I said thank you
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I don’t have much to say about it but I really like this one, I think this is the only time on the album Bastille really nailed the potential of this sound/aesthetic. It sounds big, chaotic, and adventurous but it’s still controlled and not just a bunch of obnoxious yelling.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): PERIODT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): For a long I found this song overrated. But relistening now, no, it's not. It's perfect. It is indeed one of the best songs of the album. Bastille referencing Greek mythology is always great. So it really deserves all the praise it gets. Also shoutout to the iconic part from Tuning In/Previously on Other People's Heartche... where HUMS Contemporary Choir sing the chorus of this song, and to this day I still want a full version.
 
**Stryxen** (10): easily the only song ever.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Invented Greek mythology
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): Zayn who?
 
**duhchappers** (9): I love this chorus and intro and bassline so damn much, thank god for this rate making me listen to it again and recognize its greatness.
 
**fadedblue09** (9): I love Greek mythology allegories.
 
**modulum83** (9): Returning to this song, it turns out I like it a bit less than I remembered, but it's still a hell of a banger with really powerful lyrics.
 
**wavingwolves** (9): "you put up your defences when you leave you leave because you're certain of who you want to be" but am i???
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): Oh wow I actually kind of like this one
 
**DaHumanTorch** (8): i love anything that lyrically referenced greek mythology but even leaving that aside, this was a bop
 
**fishingfor8** (7): alot of their songs have classic Greek references and idk I like it
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): another song that has grown on me, great chorus
 
#Pompeii Outsold
 
**ManofOranges** (6): This song is nice but kinda middle of the road.
 
**vayyiqra** (6): I feel guilty because this is a bop and even though I think the myth of Icarus is an overused metaphor, I come from a family of addicts and narrowly avoided that fate too, so these lyrics still kind of hit hard for me. : /
 
**radiofan15** (5.1): Forgot about this one as soon as it ended
 
**waluigiest** (5): this is the same melody as Pompeii and it’s not very good

On the doom days tour pt 2 I remember how everyone tried to bully bastille to play this song because they hadn't played it live in a really long time and never outside of the US, Unfortunately they did not play it at my show but it's okay because i dont think i could've taken it. This is another i regret not being able to put in the main rate because I could see it being a 11 contender cause its so good
 
---
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): eh i wasn't gonna write anything but fuck it. Sleepsong terrified me when i first listened to it because of how scarily relatable it was, and the lyrics being in second person made it feel like it was directed at me personally. after i got passed being terrified of it, i ended up becoming emotionally attached to it, and it was very important for me for a certain period of my life. listening to it now is not exactly the same, but i still love this song and i'm very thankful that it exists.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): If this was in the main rate it could easily rival Things We Lost In The Fire for my 11
 
**axestogrind** (9): Thank you @ rate creator for saying All This Bad Blood disc 2 rights
 
**fadedblue09** (7.5): Eh, not as memorable as the other one. Added a .5 for the final chorus going off.
 
**ManofOranges** (7.5): This is fine.
 
**modulum83** (7.5): A bit plodding and overdramatic, until the chorus finally explodes
 
**vayyiqra** (5): Maybe it's because this has been a long rate, or maybe it's because I didn't sleep last night, or maybe it's because I need to pee, but those triplets are grating on me and keeping me from liking this. Petty, I know, but it feels like a song that had potential but was rightfully cut because it was unfinished. Or maybe I'm just uncomfortable thinking about being that alone myself.
 
**radiofan15** (4.5): Appropiately this one put me to sleep...
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (3): apt title because this is putting me to sleep

#Comments about T * ylor Sw * ft
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): fantastic song. i just wonder how many comments will be about Taylor (guess i'm guilty of it too now)
 
**vhqv1997** (9): This is the good Bad Blood song.
 
**fadedblue09** (8): I’ll refrain from making references to a certain female pop star. That aside, this sounds like a war movie soundtrack.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6): me talking about the Kimye/Swift feud
 
**vayyiqra** (6): And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): SHUT UP ABOUT TAYLOR SWIFT. SHUT UP ABOUT TAYLOR SWIFT.
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): The superior song with such a name.
 
**1998tweety** (6): Songs called Bad Blood don't seem to be good huh
 
**wavingwolves** (8): imagine if this was feat kendrick, how would that be?
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): taylor swift finished
 
#The good songs on 1989
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (11): lol i forgot this song was a thing and it fucking slaps
 
**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): the start of this sounds like the soundtrack to a videogame… just bear with me
 
**Stryxen** (8.5): This song sounds like a remix of itself, but at least a good remix
 
**CarlieScion** (8): they really love doing oooooohOoooohOoooh-vocal runs, huh
 
**duhchappers** (8): The super-bass backing vocals are such a cool touch but nothing else about the song really stands out to me.
**Tedyonce** (10): i love the hook
 
**modulum83** (7.8): That whispery sound accompanying the percussion throughout the song is SO satisfying
 
#Shake it off
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): as a title track I feel like this should be a bit stronger
 
**fishingfor8** (7): weakest of the opening 5 tracks
 
**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): definitely a step down from the previous two tracks but still enjoyable
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): this was the title track? A choice.
 
**ManofOranges** (6): This one doesn't quite do it for me! I saw people hyping this song up and I guess that kind of got my hopes so now I'm disappointed by it.
 
**radiofan15** (4.6): SKIP it is...

I cant give this a full 10 because in 2015 when one direction announced their hiatus everyone made really sad edits to this song and it still makes me :emofish: but other than that, it's a sweet song that i can get behind

**ManofOranges** (10): This song just makes me feel good.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): is every song in this album from now on gonna start out weak just to blast in the chorus
 
**napsandnetflix** (10): i live when i hear ryan tedders voice idk
 
**TCHALLA1966** (10): I loved this song so much when it released ugh the memories
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I discovered this song cause of the glee finale and it was definitely the perfect song to end the show on. It’s a great song, but I wish there were more vocals at some parts
**modulum83** (9.5): a spiritual experience
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): this and on top of the world are perfectly "mid 2010's fanmade tumblr video of youtubers having just having a fun set to this song and it makes you weirdly emotional by the end of it" and if you don’t understand that, I do not know how I could possibly explain it to you.
 
**vhqv1997** (9): I played this song for my high school class for our graduation. It was lit, many people cried, one girl fell from the second floor, teachers called an ambulance.
 
**waluigiest** (9): I lived bitch
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): Wtf this is such a serve...what a bop
 
**fadedblue09** (8.5): A bit cheesy, but the prodcution on this is solid, and one of the few songs where Ryan Tedder’s vocal felt genuinely soulful.
 
**duhchappers** (8): Finally a chorus that lives up to the build-up! I really like this one, excellent production and one of Ryan's best vocal performances
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): kinda cringe but also kinda inspiring
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.8): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/248/274/a0f.jpg I was gonna complain this was generic but honestly I quite liked it by the end.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i lived bitch
 
#Hmmmm
 
**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): extreme car commercial vibes
 
**DaHumanTorch** (4.5): this sounds like a song you’d play over a photo slideshow from an overnight church retreat
 
**vayyiqra** (4): I feel bad because this song was written for his baby son but also it's so bland and mid and minivancore : / my apologies to little Copeland
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): fuck this song and ryan tedder’s moaning but more importantly for being my class graduation song that narrowly beat out funkytown by lipps inc

#No thoughts Head empty
 
**wavingwolves** (11): twin peaks nation, rise up!!
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): Laura Dern >>>
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): this was the biggest competition for my 11. like Pompeii, this song is just pop perfection, it just feels so huge and powerful. this should've been a hit as big as Pompeii, since it's just as pop-friendly (at least it made the top 20 in a few European countries). and no i still haven't watched Twin Peaks. hopefully one day i will.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): screams while wiping away my tears of joy THIS! IS YOUR HEART!!! CAN YOU FEEL IT??? CAN YOU FEEL IT???
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): stream Twin Peaks on Netflix now
 
**1998tweety** (9): Wtf this is actually kind of a serve..chorus bops, the outro is good too.
 
**axestogrind** (9): This song singlehandedly ushered me into a Twin Peaks phase where I pretended to understand the show for 3 months
 
**fadedblue09** (9): I love the chorus! And the inspiration of the song's lyrics is pretty intriguing.
 
**modulum83** (8.7): this also sounds like a soundtrack song, but in a really great way
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): As someone who has never watched Twin Peaks, I can’t say I understand, but I vibe.
 
**duhchappers** (8): Almost all the elements of this song are super good. The melody is engaging, the lyrics are good, Dan is as powerful as ever, and the production is full of great stuff. Not everything is working together at all times though, and the bridge is actually not that good surprisingly, so not quite a top song.
 
**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): i’m literally watching twin peaks right now omg so I loved this reference
 
**ManofOranges** (7.5): This song is okay. Now if nobody minds, I'm going to take this moment to rant about Twin Peaks. I don't get how people can really enjoy that show. I understand that David Lynch has very unique style but I guess that style is being as confusing as possible just for the sake of it. The show to me feels like the television equivalent of music that's incredibly abrasive, annoying, and weird and calls itself experimental when it's really just bad. The show has so many moments of bad or confusing acting, plot points, etc. that at some point to me it feels less like a pastiche or whatever it's trying to be and becomes more of just something that people sit through and like because liking it seems like something that someone who is smart would do. I would also like to talk about how there's literally SO MUCH damn screaming at some points like damn I'm already losing iq points from the show and now you're gonna make me lose my hearing too??? Thanks a lot! I hope the girl who played Laura Palmer had a clause about them giving her vocal cord surgery if she needed it or something because damn you would think she stepped on like 10,000 with how much she screams. Also, everything about the red room in general like just doesn't make any sense at all and I don't think it will ever make sense because it wasn't designed to make sense it was designed to be confusing because why not. And then in the latest season why Cooper is literally just essentially comatose except he's not but he basically is! Some of the most infuriating television I've watched in my lifetime they could've cut that shit out like many episodes earlier. The only, ONLY complement I will give the show is that some of its music is nice, particularly the main theme, but that is the ONLY nice thing I will say. If the show were just the theme song on a 1 hour loop with shots of nature or something, I would be infinitely happier.
 
**radiofan15** (7.2): I kinda like the theatricallity of this one... but having said that, IT DOES SOUNDS A LOT LIKE POMPEII
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): i never understood why it’s called laura palmer but i don’t think i care enough to find out
 
**vayyiqra** (6): Ngl, despite being something of a hipster myself, I have never liked Twin Peaks - it just felt mostly boring and a little creepy to me. Without that context, I feel like I can't fully dig this song, so it comes across as a [g-word] indie-rock song that's trying to be anthemic. Luckily I am into those, though.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (4): is that like an alcoholic beverage or something

When I analyzed the All this Bad Blood tracklist to see what disk 2 songs i'd include, i knew i had to have this song in there. Also this song goes so fucking hard live
 
---
 
#Points were made!!
 
**axestogrind** (11): Yes the best song of the whole rate is a Corona cover, it's what God intended.
 
**radiofan15** (11): You rarely heard remixes as inspired as this one... it's just a stroke of genius mixing these two and doing it on such a flawless way!
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Queens Of knowing when to reference.
 
**DaHumanTorch** (10): wow this was incredible. definitely one of the album highlights and also one of the rate highlights
 
**fishingfor8** (10): bastille did it better
 
**ManofOranges** (10): The first feeling that came to mind upon hearing the sample was that of terror. This could either go really good or really bad. Thankfully I think it went really well.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): if you are capable of mashing up two iconic Eurodance bangers into something dark and weird like Of the Night, and still make it good somehow, you are truly iconic. Bastille's covers are amazing, check out Other People's Heartache parts 1 and 2 for more.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this song is creepy and chilling and perfect and i used to have nightmares about it because of the music video
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Honestly the idea of mashing up Rhythm of the Night and Rhythm is a Dancer together is such a ingenious idea that works so well but watch this sub drag it bc its a man singing a song originally sung by a girl
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): what a blessing.
 
**wavingwolves** (10): majestic
 
**1998tweety** (9): Oh wow the chorus on this actually bops huh
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): This would be better if the chorus was a bit more explosive. But it’s a bop omg
 
**modulum83** (9): after an entire album of baroque indie I am SO thankful I get to listen to an electro disco banger
 
**rotating3Dtext** (8): this is WEIRD but I’m into it
 
**skargardin** (8): I nearly gave this my 11 due to nostalgia and thank god I didn't
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This sounds like an outtake from the *Tarzan* soundtrack.
 
**vayyiqra** (7): Wow, this is a song I haven't heard in a long time. I remember it from my childhood in the 90s. It's a weird choice of a song to cover, but I have a thing for melancholy covers of upbeat pop songs, so this hits just right.
 
#I sleep
 
**duhchappers** (6): I appreciate the effort put in to make this different from the average song on this album but it doesn't come out to anything better than average for me
 
**vhqv1997** (6): This vocal production needs to die.
 
**fadedblue09** (4): Horribly pitched voices are a trend that I gladly wouldn't revisit.
 
**waluigiest** (4): the only good part of this song is the sample and they didn’t even do that!!!!
 
#The irony of dude fighting for this rate just for them to have the worst taste ever

The first Imagine Dragon song I heard way back at the very end of 2012, a simpler time
 
---
 
#I just wanna go back, back to 2012
 
**hikkaru** (11): classic
 
**TCHALLA1966** (11): well this is everything god I love this band idc idc
 
**CarlieScion** (10): BIG BOP. one of my 11 options
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): In my opinion, this should have had Radioactive's success. It's Time I'm so sorry sweetie.
 
**duhchappers** (10): The first Imagine Dragons hit, and probably still Dan's best vocal performance. He just has this ability to make me invested in his emotional journey even with super vague lyrics, and I will never get tired of it. Especially this bridge, despite me having no idea what it means, I am totally invested.
 
**fishingfor8** (10): dark horse candidate for top 3
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): I think this is my favourite song from them. It’s been so long since I’ve heard it but it’s still really good
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH A FUCKING MOMENT
 
**ManofOranges** (10): Fuckkkkkkkkkkk part of me wishes I could give to 11s because I love this song so damn much. Maybe i's just the time I associate it with but this song gives me incredible feelings of nostalgia and euphoria. It came at just the right moment in my life and now I'm listening to it again at just the right moment and it's all just clicking. As soon as I heard the instrumental when the track started I got chills, and I was instantly taken back to the memories I have associated with this song and no song has quite done that like this one has. This song really just fills me with joy.
 
**modulum83** (10): "The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell" - just perfect
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): the first Imagine Dragons song i ever heard, which i found drifting around at the bottom of the iTunes top 200 in early 2012. after hearing it for the first time and having it in my head a few days later i thought i had dreamed of this song and that it didn't actually exist but i was so happy to find out it did exist indeed. little did i know it would eventually become a hit and Imagine Dragons would become such a big name. maybe that was just my teenage self being easily impressed but idc, this song is still perfect and will always be one of my favorites
 
**radiofan15** (10): As a Glee stan i'm forced to give to this one the highest score possible...
 
**vhqv1997** (10): Those opening chords are iconic
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): after all these years, i still don't know what this song is about if it's not about some very awkward sex
 
**1998tweety** (9): I did not know this was ID at first, it bops though.
 
**skargardin** (9): This was such a good (second ? follow up single?) to Radioactive, I was fully stanning by the time this hit radio.
 
**axestogrind** (8): The day my music teacher showed us Imagine Dragons using this song no one paid attention cause a tampon rolled out of her bag, my class then went on to perform this song at our school's talent show and won so yeah I have a lot of memories attached to this song
 
**Stryxen** (8): I like this song so much I don't care most of the lyrics mean absolutely nothing
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): this song is just one long sexual innuendo
 
#What did the mandolin every do to you?!?!?
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): ok so like if i were to objectively rate this id give it a 10 bc i can acknowledge that this song bops but. i overplayed this song so much over the years that i can barely stand it anymore and i think im being generous giving it a 6 based on that merit
 
**waluigiest** (5): this is just On Top of the World
 
**fadedblue09** (4): Despite being a popular single and all, why does this feel very so-so?
 
**wavingwolves** (4): sorry but turn the fucking madolin off man!!!! the chorus is so much better than the rest of it!!! i'm so mad
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (2): There’s something about *this* specific kind of commercial friendly indie pop rock that annoys the hell out of me. The way most of the words are meaningless mush meant to blend into the background except for one or two prominent lines that give you a vague idea of what kind of feeling the song is supposed to be conveying, it feels very… [corporate music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxY_Y9TGWI) I’ve heard this song many, many times since it came out (never by choice) and I still can’t tell you more than one or two lines or even what it’s about.
 
**DaHumanTorch** (0): i hate hate HATE this song. i know it’s popular, i know it’s gonna go far, and i know this is a hot ass take but i just can’t stand it. the production in it, including the heavy guitar in the last chorus that just completely drowns out their voices? awful. i just hate the instrumentation so much. i could go on and on about this song but i’ve just always hated it sorry
 
**vayyiqra** (0): I thought we were going to have a problem when I heard a mandolin in the intro - one of my hated music genres is the early-2010s folk-rock fad that was mercifully brief. It's not as awful though once the rest of the band kicks in. (Hey, a Popheads rate featuring a band? Wild concept.)

I am  the lowest score for this and im so sorry but hearing this song reminded me of my middle school crush who was very toxic. I had this as his text tone and my mind left my body when the chorus hit. However I went back and listened to some of the tour recordings of this and I liked that one more but emotionally i cannot give this above a 5. Song Good, Memories Bad

#This song Fucks
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): THIS SONG! THIS FUCKING SONG! This may honestly be my favorite song of the entire decade it blows me away every time I listen to it. There’s no amount of words I could use that properly describe my feelings for this song so I’m just gonna put it like this : what Ribs by Lorde does for all the depressed music twitter stans this song does for me
 
**Tomtom1109** (11): yes i stan bastille shut up
 
**CarlieScion** (10): big bop
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): That second to last chorus, the sing along? Fuck yes.
 
**ManofOranges** (10): Good song. The title reminds of that video of the like flying fairy toy a kid had flying into the family's fireplace.
 
**modulum83** (10): Possibly even better than Pompeii for sheer energy. The choral vocals and strings give it the ancient feel that this album really sets itself apart with.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): 🔥🔥🔥
 
**rotating3Dtext** (10): ...I always liked this one more than Pompeii
 
**Tedyonce** (10): this goes OFF
 
**vhqv1997** (10): The superior Bad Blood single. Pompeii can get fucked.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): song is fire
 
**fishingfor8** (9): FIRE FIRE FIYAAAAH
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): a number one hit in Slovakia!
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): Californians be like
 
**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): i loved the production on this so much, especially the buildup in the bridge with the violin
 
**duhchappers** (8): The production is engaging (especially the strings on the bridge) and Dan Smith has such a great voice he elevates every song he sings. With a stronger chorus this would be a top tier song for sure, but it's still really good.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): My community was heavily impacted by those Northern California fires a year back so I feel weird listening to this but it’s a nice song.
 
#Men don't deserve rights
 
**radiofan15** (7.3): This sounds like 2013...
 
**vayyiqra** (7): Never mind, I take back my comment about "Pompeii" making me feel like I wouldn't enjoy this album. This song sounds exactly like a Ceremonials-era Florence + the Machine song but sung by Chris Martin and I fuck with that.
 
**fadedblue09** (6.5): Decent bop, but the chorus is a little limp.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): i think i’ve warmed up to this song in the last 6 years but it’s still too dramatic for me

This pained me to not put in the main rate because its one of my favorite songs on the album and would've fought flaws for my 11. This is one of my top 10 bastille songs, it's so rare for one fo their songs to take their bittersweet elements and make it sound and feel more sweet than bitter and i love it
 
---
 
**axestogrind** (10): One of the best songs ever made getting pushed into a bonus rate...
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): one of the most simple Bastille songs and it's fantastic. adorable with a pinch of creepiness. i love it.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Shoutout to my friend named Poet. Im not saying Dan Smith wrote this song about you but he wrote this song about you
 
**modulum83** (9.5): The lyrics to this are so beautiful.
 
**fadedblue09** (8): Hmm, it's cute. I can see it worthy of a spot on the standard edition.
 
**Stryxen** (8): just incredible so why isn't this in the main rate?
 
**fishingfor8** (7.5): Haunt? The Draw? Durban Skies? All 11s, all of them. And they dont even have a chance because poet decided to stick its fat ass into the rate.
 
**radiofan15** (6.1): Not this being better than most of the songs on the main album :skull:
 
**ManofOranges** (6): Kind of like the more positive version of Writer in the Dark.
 
**vayyiqra** (6): "The Shape of You" but make it more highbrow and less cringe
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (3): he’s making poetry sound douchey, this is very “grad student who’s super misogynystic but hides it behind an air of academia then cheats on you and writes a play about it where he’s the tragic protagonist and you’re the villain”

I didn't hear this song until doing the rate and I though it was gonna be a ballad but it's kinda a banger
 
---
 
#Forgotten Banger
 
**ImADudeDuh** (11): Honestly, the vocals on this are SO underrated. I love this song so much and always thought it was better than Counting Stars tbh.
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Bombastic is the best way to describe this song. If Counting Stars is the song the crowd sings, Love Runs Out is what plays when the guillotine comes down.
 
**DaHumanTorch** (10): i totally forgot this existed omg this SLAPS
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): another classic from them!
 
**ManofOranges** (10): Ok this is a hit.
 
**napsandnetflix** (10): my love for ryan tedder will never run out
 
**PointlessBibliophage** (10): yes daddy ryan give that love to me
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): damn i forgot how much this goes off
 
**vhqv1997** (10): I'm glad that the band decided to shelf this song until they came up with a better chorus because shit slaps
 
**wavingwolves** (10): good shit!
 
**radiofan15** (9.5): The energy on this one is just so contagious!
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (9.5): whew this kinda slaps
 
**fadedblue09** (9): Solid bop, and I think I liked his voice here for once.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): banger and a slapper
 
**Stryxen** (8.9): sir calm down this is only track 2
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): Ok this is groovy, we stan
 
**duhchappers** (8): Very catchy and well constructed, but the lyrics are lacking just a little bit of the heart and energy that makes Counting Stars so good
 
**skargardin** (8): Banger!
 
**modulum83** (7.8): Feels a bit repetitive, but the chorus is just divine
 
#Ran out of love
 
**waluigiest** (7): I thought this was rumor has it
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I’ll avoid making too many comments like this but this is a little too masc for me.
 
**vayyiqra** (5): "Got an angel on my shoulder, and Mephistopheles" "Recorded At Faust Records (Prague, CZE)" you have got to be shitting me
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (0): i hate this. i hate this song so much. this is so disappointing. this almost sounds like an X Ambassadors song (ok maybe that was too harsh). it's less than 4 minutes long but it drags itself forever. i don't understand what happened here at all. sorry, OneRepublic, but my love really ran out here.

This song got destroyed billboard right, and i told you all to do it justice in my rate, and i'd say that most of you all did it well
---
 
# This IS it
 
**rotating3Dtext** (11): this album was mY LIFE in 2013, no I don’t know why I was like that. this is a dramatic bop
 
**vayyiqra** (11): When this song came out, I thought it was kind of dumb, mainly because I couldn't understand the lyrics ("ready to act here? what?" I love being hearing impaired and a music fan!). But, true story, it grew on me because it's a meme at the college radio station I worked at - someone made a station ID that used it. Then I realized I'm dumb and the lyrics are kind of cool because there aren't a whole lot of post-apocalyptic pop-rock songs, and I love pop with sci-fi themes, so they got me. Seriously, look up the analysis of the lyrics on Genius - it's really cool and in-depth. I was even able to get over the distorted production and my hatred of "whoa-oh-oh" shouty vocals. tl;dr this is a banger.
 
**1998tweety** (10): An event, this song got all the success it deserved.
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): this shit was on repeat for me all of 2013. it is such a banger and for some reason i would never get tired of it. the kendrick lamar remix is also amazing kind of wish we were rating that too
 
**DaHumanTorch** (10): i know people are gonna be hating on this, but this song is incredible and truly a classic idc idc
 
**hikkaru** (10): classic
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): this was probably one of the first songs I heard from them, and I definitely still like it. Go check out the pentatonix cover with Lindsey Stirling it’s even better than this
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): Why has there been a backlash to this song recently? It’s honestly one of the best rock hits of the 2010s and was such a fucking moment in 2013. This song never fails to get me shook.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): tbh i had been mildly conflicted about this since i first heard it in 2012. but eh it's great.
 
**radiofan15** (10): We love an organic hit!
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): wtf i don’t remember this going off so hard
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): I dont think we, as a society, were ready for this song
 
**TCHALLA1966** (10): idc y’all can’t hate this but it’s a strong song
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): ok the song is a little cringe in retrospect but i still know every single word to it and what can i say, it bangs
 
**waluigiest** (10): SO dated but I’d be lying if I didn’t say I kind of love it
 
**fadedblue09** (9.5): I swear, I’m surprised this is hated? Maybe cause I somehow escaped the overplay, but I don’t think it’s that bad at all, and it's pretty anthemic.
 
**duhchappers** (9): I've never really thought of this as one of Imagine Dragon's best songs, but the atmosphere they create is impressive and it is still really hard to skip, even after 500 or more listens.
 
**fishingfor8** (9): I'm convinced that when the world ends this is the song that's played from the sky
 
**Stryxen** (9): I literally don't know anyone who doesn't know all the lyrics
 
**\_wailordfan** (8): I hate to say it, but it's pretty overrated.
 
**axestogrind** (8): The way the 30-year-old men of music band Imagine Dragons perfectly captured teenage angst in a time where everyone was obsessed with dystopian fiction... yeah this is it
 
**vhqv1997** (8): Making this my ringtone when this corona virus pandemic up and wiped out half the Earth
 
**modulum83** (7.8): I do really like the very desolate, moody guitar part at the beginning and how it transitions into the drop
 
**ManofOranges** (7.5): Ok this song is maybe growing on me a little after doing this rate, but I still think it's one of the weaker songs on this album. I just don't get it!
 
#*Cough * * Cough *
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Oh dear this song didn’t age well? Number one it suffers massively from overplay (and I have a personal vendetta against it because I was in a high school dance program at the time it was big and like four people insisted on choreographing dances for it) but also it feels very entrenched in the maximalist vibe of the early 2010s in a bad way. And I hate the way he sings “aPOCalypse.” There’s still plenty of good parts of it and it’s miles better than a lot of songs we’ve rated but I wouldn’t feel right given it a higher score.
 
**CarlieScion** (6): the 'stop and take a big breath-pause in song'-thing really is just that obnoxious
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): I used to vibe with this a lot when it came out. Nowadays, not as much. But we do love an anarchist anthem.
 
**wavingwolves** (4): i appreciate that the songwriting of this because it's pretty complex and interesting but the actual music sounds... bad
 
#You know what maybe i should'nt have done the womens rate
 
**static\_int\_husp** (0): The "breathing in the chemicals" part is almost the entire reason for this score.

#Emo Kids WON
 
**1998tweety** (11): Yes I'm an emo bitch, I love this. The lyrics, the emotion, the vocals... it all comes together so well.
 
**DaHumanTorch** (10): my favorite imagine dragons song by far. i know the whole i have demons inside of me i’m so edgy trope is a little overdone but i just love this song and hope it makes top 5 at least (tho i doubt it will ugh)
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I think Todd in the Shadows put this on one of his “Worst” lists so I’m not optimistic at its chances of survival because I’ve seen many users just kind of parrot what he says (that’s right, I’m calling it out) but also the people doing this rate probably don’t care so who knows? Anyways this is a whole bop, really brings out my inner emo.
 
**ManofOranges** (10): I remember some people I knew giving this song shit, but now that I listen to it I don't understand why! I love this song I think it sounds fantastic. Also, insert something here about Matt Damon or whatever.
 
**radiofan15** (10): Overplayed and slighty exhausting? OF COURSE... but that doesn't mean it slaps!
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): sorry toddintheshadows but there’s literally no fucking way this was one of the worst hit songs of 2013
 
**CarlieScion** (9): the amount of teen wolf edits i watched that had this song overlayed...
 
**hikkaru** (9): classic
 
**TCHALLA1966** (9): people hate this but honestly why
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): definitely hard to believe that these guys made EVOLVE
 
**vhqv1997** (9): Honestly I've never liked it when Imagine Dragons does angsty songs like this because it always sounds so cringe but Demons is a legit fun song that makes you want to scream out in frustration. Too bad they decided to duplicate this formula 12 times and make Evolve.
 
**waluigiest** (9): they really had a moment when this album came out I recognize like all of these
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (8.5): one of the many songs i can't form a consistent opinion on. but today i like it so
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): does anyone else never understand what dan reynolds is singing
 
**modulum83** (8.3): oh man what a nostalgia trip
 
**duhchappers** (8): Yes, it's a Coldplay ripoff. Yes, the lyrics are basic as all hell. Yes, the production is almost manipulative (I unironically love the drums though). Yes, I still get carried away by emotion, cause Dan just sounds like he cares so much and the melody is very well made. I wouldn't call it high art, but I like it a lot anyway.
 
**fadedblue09** (8): Love Dan’s vocals on this and...that’s about it.
 
**skargardin** (8): Yeah it's incredibly tropey but what the hell, I'm easily entertained and I'm a sucker for Imagine Dragons
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): this does not hit as hard as it did in 2014 but it’s still a bop.
 
**Stryxen** (7.5): I really thought I was edgy and deep for listening to imagine dragons all of 2012-2015
 
**vayyiqra** (7): I was this many years old when I learned this song I've heard on the radio tons of times was by Imagine Dragons. It may be kind of [g-word] alt-rock but it has quite a strong hook.
 
**wavingwolves** (7): sounds way better than radioactive but isn't as interesting lyrically and both of these songs suffer from being overplayed
 
#I have nothing to say
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (0): Oh boy, this one. This one is a dousey, so settle down comfortably. Demons, in my opinion, is disgusting. Let's break it down: it is a song (from what I understand) about the singer, Dan Reynolds, trying to push away those that love him (it is never specified if it is a romantic interest, a close friend or even a family member) because of his 'beast', the ghosts of his past that haunt him. That those memories make him hellbound. That those make him not worthy of love. That is something safe to assume, right? WRONG. Because apparently, the track is about 'acknowledging and battling your insecurities and flaws'. The only thing close to coming to what he says is the single line 'I can't escape this now/unless you show me how'. For me, that does not make up for the literal chorus of the song being 'don't get too close, it's dark inside/it's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide'. Not only is it a terrible message to make the main force of your song, it is especially worse if you THINK your message is actually empowering. Lines like 'they say it's what you make/I say it's up to fate' and 'it's woven in my soul/I need to let you go' come across as the singer saying that there is nothing he can do to make my situation better, once more, a terrible message to pass on as 'battling your flaws'. In conclusion, fuck you, Imagine Dragons.

Roxieloxie: # Night Visions
 
---
 
**Overall Average**: 7.527 **// Average Controversy:** 1.983
 
---
 
Roxieloxie: (8.479): Night Visions is a really good album, the nostalgia re listening to it brought me so much happiness and joy.
---
 
**duhchappers** (8.714): My second favorite era from my favorite band. I don't know if it's nostalgia or just some deep compatibility but everything about this album just works for me so well. Imagine Dragons didn't release a song I didn't like until 2017, and this album is fantastic.
 
**modulum83** (8.707): People like to call Imagine Dragons generic, but when this came out there really was nothing like it. Night Visions fused 2000s pop rock with dubstep and hip-hop influences and created an entirely new beast - one made out of rolling drums, soaring arena melodies, electronic beats, and 80s new wave tendencies - and essentially created a whole new genre. Night Visions is the blueprint for that sound, and just like ID it's an album of paradoxes: a scrappy Vegas band making it big, a combination of ragged desert-rock and gleaming, wide-eyed, exuberant pop.
 
**cremeebrulee** (8.571): wow another album also full of bangers. i don't think there's a song here that i actively dislike (but there are a few skips) but damn i really love the sound of this album
 
**radiofan15** (8.479): Generic? Sure... completely expected and rarely adventurous? of course... but that doesn't truly mean nothing when you have music that happens to be both engaging and memorable, as it is most of this record... expect for some very occasional deep cuts. [Score: A-]
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.464): Slightly better than I expected. Not by much.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.321): new imagine dragons isn’t that bad there i said it
 
**fadedblue09** (7.157): Not bad as I expected. Dan Reynolds is probably my favourite vocalist in this rate, and his vocals give their songs an anthemic feel. Unfortunately, this is offset by the songs having either subpar production or bland, uninteresting melodies. At times, his voice remains the saving grace, even if the songs are beyond terrible. When they do get it right, they are able to churn out a lot of solid pop-rock gems. Since people keep saying this is their best effort, I'm not sure if I should be exploring their discography anytime soon.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.400): I’ve always felt that Imagine Dragons unfairly get a bad reputation, they aren’t exactly what I listen to in my spare time I’ve enjoyed their music in the right context. This was an intensely commercial album, which gave me a bit of trouble because these songs would surely play well in a lot of situations like on the radio or in a dance class but when I’m just listening to them with my headphones they don’t do that much. This album was a bit all over the place in terms of scores for me, I gave it some of my lowest scores in the rate but also some of my highest. It’s not an affront to humanity or anything like their detractors make it out to be but I won’t be stanning any time soon.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.264): wow this album fell off HARD after hear me. i wish i liked this album (and ID as a whole) more bc dan reynolds is such a good lgbt+ ally but they're just overall very uninteresting outside of a few standouts
 
**wavingwolves** (6.107): such a cool band name and a cool album name, but the actual music is really not for me... the songwritting is often interesting, very honest and upfront, but the songs are overproduced. dan reynolds voice is too abrasive and it does go really that well with how clean the songs sound
 
**vayyiqra** (5.893): After all the hate that Imagine Dragons got on Popheads a while back (IMO deserved in the case of "Thunder" at least, a truly awful song) I was surprised to see this album was overall pretty good. There was some solid synth-rock on it and a minimum of acoustic indie folksy songs as I feared, and I liked that it took some risks and was more bold and creative than the other two albums in a lot of ways. It didn't always work, but they are a band with talent and I could see this album growing on me more. Also, they just seem like cool guys who really love their fans and mean well. The bonus tracks were all mediocre, though.
 
**CreepyMannequin** (4.321): I'm sorry to give this album such low scores because Dan Reynolds seems like a nice guy and ID has some absolute bops, but I really did not enjoy this album.

Oh poor counting stars, You had a good run, but ultimately their were two many singles that split the 11's and you lost.
This personally isn't my favorite single from this era but i cant deny it was one of the biggest
 
---
 
#MAKE THAT MONEY WATCH IT BURN
 
**cremeebrulee** (11): not to be too corny, there's something about this song that will always bring a smile to my face.
 
**DaHumanTorch** (11): a fucking classic, one of my favorite songs of the decade honestly. an easy 11 for me. too bad the rest of native doesn’t match this quality
 
**ignitethephoenix** (11): proof that men can write and sing bops! This is probably my favourite song by them as well.
 
**xosam** (11): There wasn't even a debate on what song would get my 11, it did everything it needed to
 
**1998tweety** (10): Good Lorde what a bop this is...it's so damn catchy and has a lot of energy.
 
**axestogrind** (10): UHH basically a perfect song? Solid lyricism, catchy melodies, fun twangy instrumentation, hooks on hooks on hooks, strong vocal delivery -- no flaws found here
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): It's a timeless classic. I'm fucking pissed at myself that this is the second rate in a row we rate this song, and both times I didn't give it my 11. Tough competition, sweeties I'm so sorry.
 
**hikkaru** (10): classic
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): What a perfect pop song. I feel like people underrate how iconic and just everywhere this was.
 
**modulum83** (10): An instant classic. It brings together all of the best elements of pop rock with perfect songwriting.
 
**napsandnetflix** (10): there is countless reasons to fall in love with ryan tedder
 
**radiofan15** (10): In the world of the immortal Mariah Carey THAT WAS A CLASSIC, THAT WAS A CLASSIC!
 
**rotating3Dtext** (10): ok so I didn’t listen to the full album on it’s day but of course I knew this bop
 
**skargardin** (10): They snapped with this song and then some, it's got hooks for DAYS!
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): For one glorious moment in 2013, the whole world united in their love for this song and we will never know peace like that again
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): honestly one of my favorite pop songs of the whole decade. summer 2013 did not stand a chance against this song.
 
**waluigiest** (10): okay I loved this song so much when it came out. It’s a little cheesy but I still think it’s v well done
 
**Stryxen** (9.5): The cool kids in 2013 used to listen to this so I feel wrong giving it a rlly good score. but it IS rlly good so :/
 
**duhchappers** (9): Definitely the best song on the album and the best One Republic song I've ever heard. Infectious energy and catchy as hell
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (9): it's not OneRepublic's best hit, but it's a really great song nonetheless, and i'm really glad OneRepublic managed to get a hit as huge as this.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): i used to like this song but it’s such a snooze now, but i mean really liked it so i’m gonna rate it high anyway
 
**vhqv1997** (9): I'm a sucker for songs where they sing the chorus twice in one go but the second time is higher pitched
 
**wavingwolves** (9): "old, but i'm not that old" me when someone asks my age
 
**ManofOranges** (8): Don't get me wrong I think this song is wonderful, but I think it lacks some of the impact that I remember it once having. The chorus, for instance, just doesn't really hit me as hard as I'd like it to. Also I'm not really a fan of ryan tedder's vocals on this song, particularly whenever he's singing in a higher register. It just doesn't click for me like it used to, but that doesn't mean this song is bad, it's quite the opposite.
 
**TCHALLA1966** (8): What a opener for the album
 
**vayyiqra** (8): Maybe the indie folk-ish revival thing made a few points. I did not realize the lyrics to this song were so relatable (I too am losing sleep to do this fucking rate on time) and that little melody in the chorus will haunt me until my dying day. If I'm willing to overlook one of my most hated music tropes (i.e., randomly yelling "hey!" a lot for no reason) then it must be good.
 
#Broke
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I find this song obnoxious, the lyrics and vocals are so annoying, but unfortunately it’s not incompetent so I can’t in any good conscience tank its score.
 
**fadedblue09** (3): I gave this a 7 in the Billboard rate cause there was a lot of crap there that made this look good, but I'm gonna be honest this time: I don’t like this at all, and I fucking hated this when it was overplayed. The lyrics are drowned in too much oxymorons and faux-preachy lyrics it doesn’t get the message across and Tedder's soulless vocals cannot carry the song to full efficiency. The song is carried solely by its catchy melody. Basically the pop-rock version of Cheap Thrills.

Roxieloxie: #Native 
---
 
**Overall Average**: 7.264 **// Average Controversy:** 1.807
 
---
 
Roxieloxie: (8.107): This was the only album coming in that I didn't know in full, But the half I did know I also have alot of nostalgia for and it and even though this album was slower in some points It was still overall pretty well
 
---
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (9.500): Yes they all sound kinda the same, but they all sound great, so I'm not complaining.
 
**radiofan15** (8.207): Ryan is a talented pop writer with such an array of hits that expecting anything less from his own group it's basically the norm. Fortunately the album reaches some really high points and, despite losing some steam in its second half, it never truly and fully slows down... [Score: B+]
 
**cremeebrulee** (7.964): lots of bangers in this album it was a pretty enjoyable listen
 
**modulum83** (7.893): Probably one of the easiest albums to sing along to ever. This album really defined 2014 for me - it felt with almost every song, I heard it on the radio or outside a mall or on TV. It's an album filled with nothing but single material, and the blend of folky indie rock and ethereal electro production encapsulates the sound of pop music at the time.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.200): I guess my favorite album in the rate despite what my scores imply, I didn’t like the first half that much but it picks up steam partway through and the back half is great. Each of these albums has a “sound” that they’re kind of washed out with and these guys had my favorite sound.
 
**wavingwolves** (7.143): it starts strong but i feel like it loses it gets lost in itself by the end. it's enjoyable, but it feels a bit long and even tiring. still a pretty good album of its genre, i guess
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.714): I’ll admit I liked this album more than I thought I would but it still sounds like they phoned it in for the non-singles. Honestly, most of these songs are so generic could’ve been written by anyone, and I have no idea who OneRepublic is or what they stand for by listening to these songs. Actually, is anyone even in OneRepublic besides Ryan Tedder?
 
**duhchappers** (6.429): OneRepublic are what I always thought they were, consistently good but rarely great. I'm glad I finally listened to this all the way through but can't say it will be on replay anytime soon
 
**vayyiqra** (5.786): This album was for the most part kind of mid, but enjoyable. I'm not saying it's bad, just not my cup of tea maybe. I can see it growing on me though, and there is some good songwriting here. The best track is definitely "Counting Stars" and they were right to make it the opener, but there are a few other gems as well. I think I would've vibed to this album in middle school.
 
**fadedblue09** (5.664): Ryan Tedder is a respectable and gifted producer, and this album demonstrates that well. Too bad the same can’t be said for his vocal skills. His falsettos are painful to hear, and his voice is generic and devoid of character they end up sounding like C-tier Coldplay. He suffers from demo singer syndrome where I can totally imagine other vocalists (including the other 2 bands) pulling these tracks better. The production is definitely the highlight of the tracks, and we might as well be listening to the instrumentals only if we want the best listening experience. Also, at this point, I felt like OneRepublic is more of a side project for Tedder to flex his production skills, rather than a legitimate band. Still love some of their early singles tho.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (5.071): no offense or anything but ryan tedder has such a punchable voice

so I ran an owl city "stan" blog back in 2013 and one of the girls i followed become really into bastille end of 2013/2014 around the time that they were starting to cross over here with this song. I have been obsessed with this song since i first heard it on pandora and i dont think i'll ever not be. I wouldn't even be mad if this ended up winning the rate, yes its a predictable winner but damn if it isnt deserved
 
 
This song wasn't always wining but the 11's started pouring in and it was evident that this was gonna take the lead. It was honestly a hard race and in the end what better song to win a rate durring this time
 
---
 
**agentofscranton** (11): best song made by a man ever? maybe so
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (11): The only correct choice. I wrote an essay for my 0, but I hope I don’t have to justify this choice. It’s an epic anthem like no other. One of my favorite songs of all time.
 
**fishingfor8** (11): I'm glad this won the rate
 
**legslegslegslegslegs** (11): excellent alt pop
 
**ManofOranges** (11): I laughed, I cried a number of times, I sweat, I danced, I got shot, I ate, and I had many epiphanies.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (11): some stormers (that's Bastille stans for those who don't know) hate this song because it was for a long time Bastille's only huge mainstream hit, and therefore the only song the GP knew about, and there is/was (idk) some hipsterish mentality in them. i don't give a fuck about any of that. not only is this the song that took Bastille places, but it was also the song that introduced me to this band that has been my favorite since 2013. the blessed day i decided to download this song for free when it was the single of the week on iTunes. it soon became my most listened song there and remains one of my favorite songs of all time. i slowly introduced myself to Bastille's other songs and ended up stanning, and this is still one of their best. the lyrics are perfect. the production is perfect. the vocals are perfect. the video is perfect. this is the best hit of the 2010s. many other Bastille songs deserved 11s (and a few OR/ID songs too), and i was especially conflicted on whether to choose this or Laura Palmer but i ultimately decided that this iconic banger is what deserves it. (there are songs on ATBB that would've stolen the 11 if they were in the main rate though, but since they're not i gladly give it to this masterpiece)
 
**skargardin** (11): This songs is one massive hook and i absolutely love every second of it.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (11): a classic really. Lke the chanting, and the overall structure of the song
 
**waluigiest** (11): huge banger - well written and performed
 
**1998tweety** (10): I find it very interesting that all 3 albums start off with their big singles, all of which are 10s btw.
 
**axestogrind** (10): This is the song that got me into ""alternative"" pop no I will not elaborate
 
**CarlieScion** (10): HOW AM I GONNA BE AN OPTIMIST ABOUT THIS!!!! also this is lowkey the song i listen to every time i go back home to my hometown fsdjkndfs
 
**DaHumanTorch** (10): such a classic, this used to be one of my absolute favorite songs and it still goes off to this day. my second choice for an 11
 
**duhchappers** (10): Imagine Dragons may be my favorite band but this was one song away from getting an 11. Everything works here works so well, from the pulsing production to the backing chorus to my favorite, the massive drums pushing everything forward. This deserves to be Bastille's big hit, despite their many other good songs.
 
**fadedblue09** (10): Major bop! I love it when songwriters write about unusual stuff, and this feels like a cinematic snapshot in song form.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): this definitely deserves to be their biggest hit (if you don’t include Happier)
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): Literally a fucking classic. Can you imagine just sitting in junior high school english, a class where you have no friends in, and the teacher has finished the lesson early and has 15 minutes of free time so you just get your phone out and put in your headphones and listen to Bastille - Pompeii and feel like you are in the middle of the most dramatic movie of all time and imagine the world crumbling around you while you stay sitting in your desk, quiet, yet knowing full well of the damage destroying everything about your world, and feeling an odd sensation of peace and hopefullness that the destruction could bring you happiness you haven’t had since 2012? Cause i can.
 
**modulum83** (10): Absolutely iconic in every detail. Everything about this song feels massive and triumphant and apocalyptic.
 
**radiofan15** (10): As a Glee stan i'm forced to give to this one the highest score possible...
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): iconic song
 
**Stryxen** (10): there's a reason i still listen to Pompeii by Bastille in 2020
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNFoOHI9iJw
 
**TCHALLA1966** (10): I’ve really gotten back into this song cause it was all over the U.K. recently.. it’s truly amazing
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): classic. iconic. legendary. generation defining. etc etc etc
 
**wavingwolves** (10): how am i going to be an octopus about this????
 
**hikkaru** (9): classic
 
**cremeebrulee** (8): i don't love love this song like everyone else, but it still an objectively great song.
 
#Reason Counting Stars peaked in this rate
 
**vayyiqra** (5): I wanted to like this because the story of Pompeii is really cool, but ngl I'm not vibing with it. There is a concept here but it feels pretentious and not that well-executed? It sounds too much like any other shouty early 2010s indie-rock song. I also feel like I don't like Dan Smith's voice and this is going to be a problem with this album.
 
**vhqv1997** (4): This song hit too close to home during this pandemic
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (2): One of the most annoying hits of the decade. The pretentious lyrics, his ostentatious overly-involved delivery with those annoying swallowed vocals, it’s all so. damn. irritating, I can see why it was a hit, and I mean that in the shadiest, most withering way possible.

Roxieloxie: # Bad Blood
 
---
 
**Overall Average**: 7.796 **// Average Controversy:** 1.692
 
---
 
Roxieloxie: (8.843): First and foremost I would kill for dan smith so jot that down. This is such a good album!!!! I know i keep saying that theres not a bad song in this rate but theres really not. Im still sad we couldn't rate **All This Bad Blood** but man,,, this is a good album
 
---
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.643): Even though I only listened to this album in full for the first time less than a year ago, it quickly became one of my favorite albums of all time, not just because every song on it is a major bop, but because my best friend who means so much to me recommended it since Bastille is his favorite band, and I was so blown away by the band I previously dismissed as one(or two if you count happier?) hit wonders. So Henry, I know you don’t even use reddit, let alone browse this sub, but I literally owe you my life for introducing me to one of the best albums of all time and yes I am saying that as a fact not as an opinion.
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (9.571): Any of these are a reasonable 11. What an amazing album.
 
**axestogrind** (8.357): This album getting a 58 on Metacritic is a crime against humanity and every person involved needs to be on trial for war crimes I'm not joking
 
**modulum83** (7.936): This is a very cool album. It's not quite pop, not quite rock - there's a really atmospheric mixture of plinky pianos, huge cinematic strings, acapella arrangements, and dark electronica that really sets their sound apart. When the songs are groovy and anthemic, I love it, but I'm not sold on the weirder slower songs. Regardless, many songs here are absolute juggernauts that fully deserve to dominate this rate. Stream Wild World.
 
**cremeebrulee** (7.929): i think out of the three, this album sticks out the most. the sound is different and its a little more consistent in quality.
 
**wavingwolves** (7.893): this is the only album that i really knew before this rate and i think it shows... still, it's so fun, nostalgic and heartwarming. it really doesn't sound like nothing we have now and for that reason it may feel a little dated but it's one of the best of its time. also, i fucking love bastille's album covers
 
**fadedblue09** (7.886): Probably the album I enjoyed the most in this rate, but I wouldn't necessarily say it converted me to a stan. While the production of the songs are consistently interesting for the most part, there are times that Dan Smith’s vocals sound tired and drag some of the songs. Despite that, they have the most intriguing lyricism of the bands here and the production never feels dull. Perhaps their biggest drawback that prevents me from fully liking them is the lack of a cohesive sound, but then again, none of the other bands here seem to have that either.
 
**duhchappers** (7.143): Bastille is a really good band, and I think this is probably their best album. Wild World is really good though, make sure to check that out. Also, half of the bonus tracks on the second disk are 9's or up so make sure to check that out too. Basically, give Dan Smith a chance to get his butter smooth voice into your life if you haven't yet.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.750): My knee jerk reaction while first listening to it was that this would be my favorite album in the rate because of the quirky subject matter and thrilling sound but mores than the other albums all of the songs just start to blend together. I could only handle so many huge foot stompers with heavy percussion and choral background vocals, as fun as they are individually. I’d label it as the most consistent, but also the least likely to surprise and delight.
 
**radiofan15** (5.507): Bastille is obviously a very talented group of musicians with a very interesting style and some really inspired moments. Of course I wish them all the best and everything but if this album proved me is that not every style of music is for me and just because the artist in question created the occasional masterpiece (Of The Night, Pompeii) doesn't mean I'll enjoy most of whatever else they created... and that's completely fine!

Leixander: I was also wondering but i think i got it : its versions are a mess, there is not really a standard version of it (different for AUS/NZ/USA) see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vows_(album)#Track_listing

Withdraw/Wandering Limbs, which are on standard version in NZ, are not on streaming on most countries as far as I know. It was kind of a problem in the rate which I hosted.
