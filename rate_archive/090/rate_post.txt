#Bonus Rate

One thing all these bands have in common is that they constantly are collaborating in some way with other artists so to celebrate that we’re gonna rank some of their live lounges as well as bonus tracks. You can only give these songs a score between 1-10, meaning they can get your **0** or **11**

#The Rules

First time doing a rate? Don’t exactly know how this works? It’s okay Here are the rules

Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine so long as it is only 1 decimal place. Ex) 9.2 and 4.9 are good, 3.33 and 7.75 are not.

You have to rate EVERY SONG in the MAIN RATE. For the bonus rate feel free to rate as many or as little songs as you want.

Your scores should NOT be considered confidential, feel free to share them, campaign for your favorite song to win. 

You may give ONE (1) song a 0 and ONE (1) song an 11. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks.You must leave a comment for these.

You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me afterwards.

Don’t Sabotage. You’re entitled to your own opinion on these albums but dont give an album a significantly lower average without any justification

Speaking of formatting, this is the correct way of formatting your comments

>Oblivion: 10 The only time a Ballad has ever been valid 

This is the only way your comments should be formatted, any other way is incorrect and will crash the system

The Final due date is still TBD but try and have it done by the end of March.
