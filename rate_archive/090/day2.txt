my favorite genere of bastille songs is "idk whats going on here but dans voice sounds pretty so ill accept it"
 
---
 
#Goes to church
 
**fishingfor8** (10): underrated af but I know you all are going to do it dirty
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): THEY WILL COME FOR YOOOOOOOU
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The strong piano line really helps this one stand out from the rest of the album and that synth that comes in on the bridge is a nice touch too.
 
**Stryxen** (9): does not get enough attention
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): idk why that between the lions show always comes to my mind when i listen to this song
 
**vhqv1997** (9): Not gonna lie this sounds like a track that a reboot of Supernatural 5 years from now would have
 
**wavingwolves** (9): the bible was never so good
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): The way the song slowly builds up to that last chorus, I wish it exploded, but it never did.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): an iconic bible story
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): this is perfectly dramatic lmao i love that
 
**duhchappers** (7): I can't really tell if this is fake deep or way deeper than I understand but either way it's an enjoyable listen.
 
**ManofOranges** (7): This song is also fine enough. I can't help but pay attention to the line about lions trying to kill
his brother.
 
#Christian Smishtian
 
**modulum83** (6.8): ngl this sounds like a soundtrack song from a kids movie
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): sorry, I don’t speak christian
 
**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): this was pretty boring whoops
 
**1998tweety** (5): I'm bored
 
**fadedblue09** (5): Oops. Just when I thought this album was fine we get this weak spot.
 
**vayyiqra** (5): *Lions make you brave / Giants give you faith / Death is a charade / You don't have to feel safe to feel unafraid This song is okay and the book of Daniel is kind of wild, but stream Lights - "Lions!" for a much better song about lions.
 
**radiofan15** (0): Can you punch a song? asking for a friend

I've always liked this song but i think now i really appreciate it. I love the way that it really captures the feeling of being in a place that reminds you so much of someone you used to know, that you no longer really do, to quote fall out boy "the torture of small talk with somebody you used to know" This song is so incredible robbed, yall did this so dirty
 
---
 
#City Travelers
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): You know, I said all of OneRepublic’s songs sounded the same, but they all sounded great. These songs, on the contrary, all don’t really sound the same, but work the same six elements in different ways. I think this is the best example of it.
 
**fadedblue09** (10): We love a good upbeat synthy production! My main gripe is that the chorus sounds pretty incomplete. Edit: Ok wait I think this is a grower.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Any song that has marimba in it gets a 10 from me
 
**modulum83** (9.5): a bop, what more is there to say
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (9.5): the rhythmic dissonance is fuckin crazy
 
**axestogrind** (8): Bastille's ability to build narratively interesting, vivid imagery on top of solid hooks remains unmatched
 
**fishingfor8** (8): little elves
 
**rotating3Dtext** (8): huh I never paid attention to this song but I like it
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): omg I thought he was singing “think of little elves” and I was like [these guys?????](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m52JIA4J4U8)
 
**1998tweety** (7): It's kinda cute
 
**duhchappers** (7): It's not everyday you hear a marimba based rock song. This one also has a really good bass-line.
 
#Only likes mario coin sounds in charlie xcx songs
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): weakest song in the album imo
 
**DaHumanTorch** (6): i didn’t like the xylophone sounding thing in the background the whole song. would’ve been a solid 8 or so if it wasn’t there. really dragged it down
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): donkey kong country snapped
 
**ManofOranges** (6): This song exists!
 
**Stryxen** (6): it ends before it can get annoying :* so I guess I like it
 
**vayyiqra** (5): Where the streets have no name / We're still building and burning down love / Burning down love / And when I go there / I go there with you / It's all I can do
 
**wavingwolves** (5): is this cornelia street?
 
**radiofan15** (4.6): That voice crack would haunt my nightmares for years to come...

This almost got regulated to the bonus rate, but I felt like it would impact pt.2 too much if i didn't give yall both. also i feel like this might be an 11 contender for some
 
---
 
#A New Hope
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): A great build up, but in my opinion, inferior to Pt. 2. But do listen to those back to back.
 
**Stryxen** (10): I do be struggling to shake the weight of living sometimes
 
**ManofOranges** (9.5): This is nice I like this better than part 2 it feels more digestible.
 
**axestogrind** (8): I thought he said "you're out of choice" for the longest time I hate British people
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): Dan Smith got his ass kicked in golf once and wrote this song.
 
**modulum83** (7.8): it's cute
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): Bops a little bit
 
**fadedblue09** (7.5): Even though this doesn't bop as hard as Part 1, I slightly prefer this more stripped and soulful approach.
 
**fishingfor8** (7.5): this album was the first album I bought and it soundtracked pretty much all of my life. No band was more influential than bastille on my early life and I still love them.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): bastilles discography confuses me and i don’t understand why part 1 is after part 2 but whatever this slaps regardless
 
#The Phantom Menance
 
**DaHumanTorch** (7): i definitely liked pt 2 better, but this was still pretty good
 
**rotating3Dtext** (7): wait part I comes after part II lol
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Eh, I like the sequel better.
 
**vayyiqra** (6): You're gonna carry that weight ... :pensive:
 
**radiofan15** (5.3): Living is hard, WBK sis...
 
**vhqv1997** (5): I much prefer Pt. II. This album gets weaker as it goes, urgh. This is a really bad way to end an album to be honest.
 
#Listen you know damn well The Silence would have gone out day one
 
**duhchappers** (5): Maybe I'm just salty that The Silence isn't in this rate, maybe the falsetto in the chorus is annoying, but either way I can't get into this.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): ok obviously this song bops but of all the deluxe tracks on the album this is the weakest one? laughter lines and the silence were RIGHT THERE

This album is really forcing me to remember alot of how mad i was in 7th grade oh god
 
---
 
#Teen Angst
 
**ManofOranges** (10): I really love this one. Something about it just really clicks with me. I guess something about Dan Reynolds yelling "can nobody hear me I got a lot that's on my mind" speaks to me in ways I didn't know it could.
 
**radiofan15** (10): Underrated deep cut... the melody is just delicious
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): This is clearly a Killers-wannabe track but who cares? This bangs
 
**Stryxen** (9): I hear you Daniel, Daniel, and Daniel.
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.5): This guitar makes me almost unable to, but sure!
 
**DaHumanTorch** (8): that horrendous intro had me worried but this ended up being a total bop much to my surprise
 
**duhchappers** (8): I struggle a little rating this one. It can be hard for me to enjoy. The lyrics are really dark, and I can't really relate. But the melody is really strong. The Bridge is great. And Dan kills the vocals. So I do still really like it, I just can't listen to it too often.
 
**fishingfor8** (8): it's a rough transition from On Top Of The World to this two songs later
 
**modulum83** (8): "yeah I guess you could say I listen to emo music"
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): this was kinda cute
 
**vayyiqra** (8): Why wasn't this a single??? This is a really good throwback to the 2000s indie-rock boom like the Killers and has a great chorus. This should've been a big hit smh.
 
#Just drink some water and go outside for a walk
 
**1998tweety** (7): Bop but the lyrics... :sis:
 
**skargardin** (7): Banger!
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): the start reminds me a bit of sweater weather but of course this doesn't touch that absolute classic
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6): There’s a joke about radio overplay in here somewhere but I’m not clever enough to find it.
 
**fadedblue09** (5): Kelly remains unbothered. Sounds like filler from The Fray (whether that's a double insult is up to you).

if theres 1 Taylor swift song that i like, its blank space. This cover should not work but i think it succedes by giving it almost a barbershop quartet vibe, also the bridge including stand by me was a nice touch. Im verry interesed to see where this places.
 
---
 
**radiofan15** (10): Gay ally and potential holewrecker Dan Reynolds did that and left that snek shook #KimDidNothingWrong
 
**wavingwolves** (10): oh god why there's a guy playing keys and drums at the same time... this is some galaxy brain shit
 
**modulum83** (9.7): honestly if Imagine Dragons announced they were shifting to becoming entirely a lounge jazz act I would be so on board
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): gay rights
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): This is really cute
 
**cremeebrulee** (8.5): ok the score was lower but when it goes into stand by me???? damn
 
**fadedblue09** (8.3): Cute cover. I was caught off guard by the mashup though.
 
**axestogrind** (8): Why did I gasp when they started singing Stand By Me
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7): [Dan Reynolds not changing the pronouns of this song](https://static.billboard.com/files/media/dan-reynolds-imagine-dragons-june-21-2018-live-billboard-1548-768x433.jpg) vs. [Dan Reynolds dodging doing the “boys only love if it’s torture” bridge](https://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/2018/11/15/nogays50x422.jpg) vs. [Dan Reynolds choosing to cover this song in the first place but then using that country-lite style with a weak vocal arrangement](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EFgGIlOU0AAq4E1.jpg)
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (7): this is decent somehow
 
**ManofOranges** (5): I have conflicting feelings on this. I think it's kind of cute but I also think this version is kind of lacking all the things that made the original version a really good song. It just feels a bit neutered to me. And then they bring in stand by me????? What's that about??? I feel like blank space and stand by me don't go together at all theme-wise. So that was just weird.
 
**vayyiqra** (4): I hated this cover at first because a) I have never been a big fan of the original song, much as I love 1989 (yes, really) and b) it felt very much like the "ridiculous parody YouTube covers* genre that was big in the early 2010s. However I lolled when they randomly interpolated "Stand By Me" into it, so I am bumping it up just for that.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): why why WHY did they turn this into a yacht rock song

I already know yall are gonna hate this song, i do. to be honest, the reason my score is so high is because of how much I love Rocks
 
---
 
#Rocks Stans
 
**modulum83** (8.3): If these were separate tracks Rocks would get a 10.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.7): NLTS is a 6.5 but Rocks is a 10 so I’m averaging my scores for both
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): ...
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I like “Rocks” a lot more than the first part, “Rocks” is honestly 10 but the first part tanks the score. For as loud and as long as “Nothing Left To Say” is it’s kinda empty.
 
**fadedblue09** (7.5): The first part (‘Nothing Left to Say’) was a boring dreck that did not deserve to take more than half of the track. Rocks is the redeeming part here and is a cute folk-bop. And I don’t see why this needed to be a two-part track? Hard Feelings/Loveless teas.
 
**fishingfor8** (5): rocks saved this song
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): “The final song was split up into two because the label limited the band to eleven songs on the album due to licensing budgets.” well that really fucking sucks! Wow I wish Rocks was a lot longer.
 
**waluigiest** (7): I actually really like Rocks but WHY did I have to wait 7 minutes for it???
 
#NLTS Stans
 
**TCHALLA1966** (10): tbh I edited out rocks on iTunes nothing left to say is great on its own
 
**1998tweety** (5.5): A 9 minute long song..chile we ain't doing this. This would've been so much better without Rocks at the end.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): nothing left to say good, rocks bad. also why are they together?
 
#The Rest
 
**radiofan15** (9.1): We love experimental kings...
 
**DaHumanTorch** (9): this would’ve been a 10 if it wasn’t for that awkward 8 or so seconds of silence in between the two songs

**ManofOranges** (9): Damn this song is good. I find myself to be one of the first people to scoff at 6+ minute songs because they usually long overstay their welcome and don't justify their own existence past the 4 minute mark usually, but I was actually engaged with this one. Nothing Left to Say never ever left me bored and the outro to it was especially beautiful I think. My only issue is that Rocks literally has no reason to be there at the end. The song goes completely silent and then suddenly Rocks starts and every time that happens I have to look at which song is playing because I don't recall any song like that and then I remember like "oh that's right it's rocks." The songs really just don't meld as well as I'd like and while I think they both work on their own, together is not where they belong, which is ultimately why this is a 9 and not a 10 for me.
 
**vhqv1997** (9): Both songs are good but what is the point of combining them?
 
**Stryxen** (8): this section of the album is consistently good and both parts are just quality

**vayyiqra** (7.5): I'm really impressed with this and didn't know the band had it in them to write a long multi-part epic like this. I almost want to give it my 11, but I'm not that naive and know well of Popheads' hatred for long tracks and their short attention spans, so it would be wasted. I don't like the coda part as much, but still, it shows a lot of depth that I didn't know they had.

**duhchappers** (7): Nothing left to say is really nice, if somewhat forgettable and a little too long. Rocks has really good production, but some other weaknesses. I find the lyrics kinda weird, and the vocals are some of the weakest on the album. Overall, i wish the two songs were more different if they were to be paired together, or at least have more thematic cohesion. The closest I come to a skip on the album, but even then I still like it.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7): the first half I like a lot better than the rocks half
 
**rotating3Dtext** (7): I kinda get whiplash between these moods
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): Why is this one song?
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): yee haw
 
**wavingwolves** (4): so it seems like their label limited them to 11 songs so the last song on the album ended up being a two part song... yeah, i understand why it happened but i don't get what they really tried to do... it doesn't tie up well
 
**CarlieScion** (3): i have decided i hate imagine dragons.

It's October 2019, the scene, Midterms week. I was an absolute mess, the only thing keeping me going was the bastille concert happening at the end of the month. I had missed them twice before and I didn't want to again. As i got closer and closer to the date stuff kept going wrong and it was looking like i wasn't gonna be able to go. Down to the day of the show my day had just been a mess. Somehow we made it to the show and i managed to get a decent view from the stage despite being surrounded by a bunch of 6'5 dudes who wouldn't budge. I was so anxious in the pit i thought i was gonna have to leave but i forced myself to stay. The show went on and a few songs in, this song came on. This was already one of my favorite songs and i was so caught up in the euphoria of it all that i didn't notice the lead singer dan had jumped into the pit. he made his way around singing until he was literally 10 feet from me. the euphoria in that moment as he passed by me as he was singign one of my favorite songs is one of my favorite memories of just feeling a wave of happiness and i just love this song.
 
This song was doing really well staying at day 3 but then it fell, towards the end it came back up but not enough to save it

#People i will spare
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): What Demons thought it was doing.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): this song is flawless. also Dan can come fill my hole any day.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): gonna be sad if this doesn’t make day 3
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): I’ve never heard sexier chiptune music in my life
 
**duhchappers** (9): Some of the best lyrics in the rate for my money, reflects some really interesting human conflicts around trying to live with our problems and how we deal with them. If there was better melody it would be one of my all time faves.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): when they play this live dan walks around the crowd and says hi to people. i made physical contact with him and it cured my depression for FIVE WHOLE MINUTES
 
**axestogrind** (8): Anyone else remember that time Dan stepped on a huge shard of glass that cut through his shoe into his feet while he was performing this so he tweeted 'there's a hole in my sole'
 
**fadedblue09** (7.9): I love the instrumentation here but I wished his voice went off harder.
 
**modulum83** (7.5): I like the bleepity bloopity throughout the song
 
**Stryxen** (7.5): these synths make me HAPPY
 
**1998tweety** (7): I mean at least it sounds different from the rest of the songs here
 
**DaHumanTorch** (7): aww this was cute lyrically, not one of my favorites on the album though
 
#People on my hit list
 
**vayyiqra** (5): The song is :meh: but the lyrics are :pensive:
 
**radiofan15** (4.9): We can tell there's a lot of flaws in here
 
**ManofOranges** (4): I've always found songs about flaws kind of boring. Like the message is always the same and to me it's just sappy but the sound doesn't back it up so it's just a boring sounding song with a boring message.

 This song is so cute, i cant be mad at it, it makes sense to me that it survived this long

#r/indieheads
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (11): This is my favorite kind of indie rock! I think that different genres have different strong points and I think one of the things that indie rock is best at is capturing a sense of adventure by creating bright textures with guitars and the faded yet present vocals. It can really fill a room and reach right for the sky, when you hear stuff like this it just sucks you in and connects with some primal part of you that you thought you lost during adolescence but the song brought back. When this goes wrong we end up with empty noise, but when it goes right you end up with bops like this. Glad this album ended on such a strong note!
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): This sounds like it could be used as a TV show opening. I love it.
 
**wavingwolves** (10): shouldn't be just a bonus track
 
**CarlieScion** (9): FINALLY something different
 
**napsandnetflix** (9): ryan tedder woke af says life is better with all colours ugh not caring about the colour of peoples skin you love to see it trump shaking
 
**vhqv1997** (9): Bops bop
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): Bop, good end to the album.
 
**modulum83** (8.5): does it sound like it's pre-made for feelgood commercials? yes. is this song still a fucking banger? hell yes
 
**radiofan15** (8.5): A strong closer with a killer bass and a kick-ass chorus... why can't the midportion of the album being like this
 
**DaHumanTorch** (8): this was a bop...a great album closer!
 
**duhchappers** (8): This definitely has better power behind it than most songs here. The guitars are great.
 
**Stryxen** (8): it's a nice ending and this is the only place it could show up on the album
 
**waluigiest** (8): I love the rugrats theme
 
**ManofOranges** (7): I feel like I should like this song, like this hook is very big and grandiose which I normally like but it feels like there's too much going on for me to enjoy it to its fullest extent.
 
**TCHALLA1966** (7): this cute but shouldn’t be a closer at all
 
**vayyiqra** (7): I love this! It has positive lyrics, a shuffle beat and chess metaphors, all things I like. Life is such a downer lately that I need more cheerful bops like this. Even though it's a bonus track I think it also works well as a closer.
 
#Probably would give closer their 0
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this song and dont call me angel have the same exact opening
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): okay this is a little too cheesy i'm afraid
 
**fadedblue09** (4.5): Okay, a bop, but damn, Tedder is singing out of his range here it drags the song here. Just like most of their songs tbh.
 
**axestogrind** (4): muffy sis... the noise... the wailing vocals...

I have extremely intense memories associated to this song, alot of them are really bad but despite that i don't hate this song somehow
 
---
 
#Fuck it, an outlet for my anger
 
**Stryxen** (11): HATE the fact that I'm giving my 11 to an Imagine Dragons song but I can't ignore perfection
 
**axestogrind** (10): fuck me up Dan
 
**DaHumanTorch** (10): best song on the album besides demons. the production on this was chefs kiss
 
**radiofan15** (9.6): We love melodramatic straight people...
 
**1998tweety** (9): Big bop
 
**fishingfor8** (9): I'm glad Amsterdam was never a hit so it remains that good deep cut but I kinda wish this had become a big hit
 
**Tedyonce** (9): how was this not a single?!?
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): wtf why is this good
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): It took me a solid 15 seconds to realize it was a new song.
 
**duhchappers** (8): If this song would decide whether it is slow and atmospheric or fast and powerful, rather than trying to be all of them at once, I would like it more, but it falls a little short of being great. Also, my girlfriend uses this as her period anthem, so that's a fun fact.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): the only way to properly experience this song is in a youtube AMV for an anime that you thought was the best show ever for like 2.3 weeks and so you binged whatever fan content you could find.
 
**TCHALLA1966** (8): there’s nothing left to say but I love it
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): ok a lot of what's going on in the background is bothering me, but i still like the song overall
 
**modulum83** (6.5): who put this blown-out dubstep song in my pop rock album
 
**ManofOranges** (6): Of all the songs on this album, this is probably my least favorite, which I think says something if the lowest score is only a 6. It just didn't connect with me like the rest of the songs did, but I don't think that makes this a bad song by any stretch of the imagination.
 
**vayyiqra** (6): Imagine Dragons should lean into this more creative and slightly edgier side more often. It makes them a lot less bland.
 
#Hates self expresion
 
**wavingwolves** (4): there's a lot going on in this song and i feel like i can't digest it
 
**fadedblue09** (2): Sorry but the production here is one hot mess.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): i really really hate the way this sounds but i can’t figure out what it is exactly that i hate so much for the life of me

another 11 contender ngl, the idea of songs that are "anchor points" for me. songs that no matter what im going through will just instantly calm me down, has always been a thing. and this is one of the earliest examples of a song like that. Just like IILM i have no idea but something about this song just really resonates with me. Im so sad this lost out on the top 20 but at least its not too far

**modulum83** (8.3): 1R is so fucking good at bridges/outros holy fuck
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): ryan tedder really said whine
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): OH MY GOD ITS THIS SONG??? I LOVED THIS SONG WHEN I WAS YOUNGER BUT I HAVENT HEARD IT IN LIKE FIVE YEARS????
 
**TragicKingdom1** (8): extreme dog days are over vibes
 
**1998tweety** (7): Bop but kinda fades into the background
 
**skargardin** (7): I wish i could feel something again
 
**vhqv1997** (7): It's not country but it veers dangerously close. Give this one to Carrie Underwood and she would have another Christian hit on her hands.
 
**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): another generic and predictable beat drop like if i lose myself, but this one was actually a bit interesting and i was bopping ngl
 
#Only likes moody lorde music
 
**duhchappers** (6): Well done build-up but I think Ryan Tedder is not the singer for this type of song
 
**ManofOranges** (6): I do like this song at least somewhat, but I think the hook is kind of lame.
 
**vayyiqra** (6): "It's like a million-dollar phone that you just can't ring" "It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing" IT'S LIKE RAAAAAIN ON YOUR WEDDING DAAAAAAY
 
**fadedblue09** (5.5): Similar to If I Lose Myself but it’s somehow more decent.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (5): mm, it’s nice but it left zero impact

I love both parts of WOL due to the fact they express the same sort of feeling and emotion but in two different vibes. The concept shouldn't work as well as it dose but it really works
 
---
 
#We do be under the weight of living doe
 
**CarlieScion** (10): the intro lowkey made med think this was a song from the undertale OST
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): That little dudududu sells the song.
 
**Stryxen** (10): you can trace all mental illness back to the first time someone listened to Weight of Living Pt. II by Bastille
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): If Weight of Living Pt. II is so good why isn’t there a Weight of Living Pt. II 2?
 
**wavingwolves** (10): this hit different now that i'm a full grown ass adult
 
**DaHumanTorch** (9): i loved this, the lyrics really hit hard since i’m especially feeling the weight of living more than usual right now
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Songs about youth/aging/maturity always click with me so Ms. Bastille is gonna get some points~
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): Bastille really said “Are you really proud of who you are after you had to deal with tons of stress since growing old? Huh? Are you? Little bitcH? (Ba-da, boo ba-da, ba-da, boo ba-da)” huh
 
**waluigiest** (9): ummm wet!
 
**modulum83** (8.5): This song is utter chaos but also really catchy
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): FIFA13 vibes :)
 
**axestogrind** (8): I do be under the weight of living doe
 
**ManofOranges** (8): The song is nice but for some reason something about it just sounds slightly off for me during the chorus I cannot put my finger on it.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): the better weight of living
 
#Because why not
 
**vhqv1997** (8): Repetitive chorus done right. Although I don't really understand what is this gimmick of placing Pt. II before Pt. I, and also what is the purpose of that Bon Iver-esque breakdown in the middle of the song?
 
**fadedblue09** (7): Cute upbeat bop (wished the vocals were better) but why does part 2 come before Part 1?
 
**1998tweety** (6.5): Why does Pt. II come first....
 
**duhchappers** (6): Thus one never really clicked for me. Not really sure why, I guess it just doesn't fill any need that other songs from this album don't do better.
 
**fishingfor8** (6): it almost sounds like a beach boy track with those ba ba ba da das lol
 
**vayyiqra** (6): All that you desired when you were a child / Was to be old, was to be old / Now that you are here, suddenly you fear / You've lost control, you've lost control Existentialist kings! I can confirm this is what adulthood feels like. Bet you can't wait, kids!

Best day of my life wishes

#F- is for friends who do stuff together
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): That oooh bridge is great, honestly. My favorite song in the album.
 
**duhchappers** (10): Nearly the perfect pop-rock song. Just enough power to keep it moving, an extremely catchy melody, and a dose of spirit-lifting happiness, and I am totally in.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): this kinda got the Juice treatment where it flopped on the charts, but because it was used in so many tv shows and commercials, it feels like everyone knows this song
 
**ManofOranges** (10): I think I love this song in spite of all the memories I have of it being in commercials. While I don't think I'll ever be able to separate this song from images of Disney nature documentaries or the images of lemurs, I don't really care. If I just ignore that aspect of the song, then I can confidently say that this is a really fun song and I love it for that.
 
**radiofan15** (10): Is this the kind of happiness that the bottoms who visits r/Popheads feels when listening to Emotion all-day everyday?
 
**skargardin** (10): This is such a goddamn classic, it makes me feel so happy and joyous. ah, simpler times when this was on the radio.
 
**Stryxen** (10): I haven't listened to this for too long why did this bring back so many memories :')
 
**TCHALLA1966** (10): IM ON TOP OF THE WORLD HEY!
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): Such a good summery bop
 
**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): it just makes me smile
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): While I don’t absolutely adore this song it’s an example of how to do this somewhat generic type of song right.
 
**modulum83** (8.5): This is the kind of song you make fun of when you're with your friends but then it comes on and you can't help but GET UP NOW GET UP GET UP NOW
 
**1998tweety** (8): Another song that I didn't initially recognize as ID. This is a bop, but to play it right after Demons is a choice. This sounds like commercial music...
 
**CarlieScion** (8): chorus big good, verses kinda boring
 
**vhqv1997** (8): The Carpenters outsold but this is nice too
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): FIFA13 vibes
 
**fadedblue09** (7): A bit too cheesy, but it’s a cute bop. I used to confuse this with the American Authors song.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (7): decent. i used to like it more though.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): this is kind of corny to me and there’s too much clapping
 
**axestogrind** (6): This album jumping from Demons to this really resonated with me as a 13 year old with hormonal mood swings and unstable self esteem
 
#This  comment specfically,,,, i hate it
 
**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): listen to the instrumental of the verses in this and then go listen to the Liv and Maddie theme song (the refrain) and tell me they aren’t the exact same. anyways another song i’ve just never liked very much, though i don’t hate it. also the clapping can go
 
# U- is for Uraniun BOMBS
 
**wavingwolves** (5): uplifting but annoying
 
**vayyiqra** (4): Sorry, it's impossible for me to rate this objectively since all I can think about during this song is how it's so much worse than the Kimbra song "Top of the World" which is a huge banger (worth at least three kimbryells) while this is a kind of corny trop-pop song. It's not bad, it's just ... aggressively okay.

I included this song for many reasons, 1. It was my ode to Bastilles' various VS remixes. 2. its a collab between two of the artist in this rate theres no way i couldn't have. 3. Im not usually a fan of remixes but this one jus works for me
 
---
 
**radiofan15** (9.2): I have no idea what were they thinking but I lov nearly every second of this crossover
 
**fadedblue09** (8): Interesting take on the song, but whose victory is it really if this wins?
 
**ManofOranges** (7): I feel like I shouldn't like this. There's just so much confusing stuff going on here. But I like it anyway.
 
**vayyiqra** (7): I'm surprised Bastille can do production this creative and interesting, and now I'm wondering why it wasn't on their album.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I legitimately couldn’t tell whose song this was until I looked it up and I guess that’s because it’s two of them.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (6): It's Time (Bastille Remix) outsold. the original "I Bet My Life" is complete trash but this is ok
 
**rotating3Dtext** (6): what is this a crossover episode
 
**modulum83** (5): I'M SORRY THAT BRIDGE IS SO CURSED IT IS AGONIZING LISTENING TO IT. Also I'd like to note that the Alex Adair, Lost Kings, and Riot Games remixes are all better and also better than the actual song
 
**fishingfor8** (4): i like the original but the mixing is not it
 
**napsandnetflix** (4): ya this aint it chief we prefer the original but also can we talk about how underrated i bet my life is like wow what a perfect song a top tier ID single like that shit fucking slaps
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): bastille hunnie what is this?? i know you can do so much better. at least dan’s vocals sound good as always
 
**ImADudeDuh** (2): why tho

#Waiting for it
 
**duhchappers** (11): I struggled with my 11, but this song is just everything I love about this album. It has fantastic production, a marriage of pop and rock that works perfectly (the guitar on the post-bridge is my favorite riff in the rate). The lyrics bounce between depressed and relatable, exactly what Dan can write compellingly. It has a melody the keeps me engaged for the entire song without any effort. And, tying it all together, Dan Reynolds sounds like he is pouring out his soul to me personally. While on the whole I prefer Smoke and Mirrors as my Imagine Dragons listening of choice, I love this song and firmly back it as the best one of the album and one of my favorites of the whole decade.
 
**modulum83** (11): There's something about this song that gets me every time. The 2000s indie rock influences do help give it that really reflective, traveling vibe, but it's the lyrics too. They perfectly encapsulate those feelings of self-doubt, of living life on your own for the first time, of struggling to find when things start to get better. As someone heading off to college this year, this song's taken on a lot of new meaning for me, and the feeling of pure hope left behind as the song concludes is indescribably powerful.
 
**fishingfor8** (10): this is probably the best song imagine dragons has ever made
 
**Stryxen** (10): I instantly gave this a 10
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): songs called Amsterdam always are good to me (stream Coldplay’s Amsterdam)
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (9): i never cared much about this song but it aged oddly well
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): nooo dont kill yourself your so sexy aha
 
**vhqv1997** (9): Coldplay outsold but this is nice too
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): A bop, I kinda like his screamy vocals ngl
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): Eh.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I couldn’t really understand the lyrics so I looked them up and I still have no clue what they have to do with Amsterdam but this sounds pretty. Dan really starts screaming towards the end and it’s honestly not unpleasant.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): why does he sound like a dan reynolds impersonator here tbh
 
**ManofOranges** (8): This song really begins to pick up for me by the end. While it's not as strong as the previous 4 tracks on the album I still really enjoy it.
 
**skargardin** (8): The instumentals snapped
 
**fadedblue09** (7.5): All the points are for those guitar riffs and nothing else. Solid for a road trip song tho.
 
#Europeans
 
**radiofan15** (7.3): What's wrong with Dan's voice in this song?
 
**DaHumanTorch** (7): aside from the fact that something sounds really...odd about dan in this song, i liked it a lot
 
**wavingwolves** (7): i like it but there's some kind of wet sound going on sometimes... like someone clapping hands using wet plastic gloves... makes me feel weird
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): fine but a tad boring
 
**CarlieScion** (6): the city is much better than this song
 
**TCHALLA1966** (6): this cute
 
**vayyiqra** (6): Putting aside the somewhat inaccurate description of the brain hemispheres on Genius (left brain doesn't = master logician), which isn't the band's fault, this is kind of a good song and also I appreciate they wrote a song about Amsterdam without mentioning drugs once.

I am not the biggest ballad fan, however theres something so captivating about this song, the amount of times this song has gotten me in a trance for its entire durriation is too many for me to track.
 
---
 
#Bastille can have little a ballad rights, as a treat
 
**fadedblue09** (11): I know this sounds cliché but simple, stripped-down ballads like this really hit the soul. It's somehow soothing and haunting at the same time. I know it won't win but nothing else in the rate makes me emotionally moved.
 
**DaHumanTorch** (10): this was gorgeous, one of the album standouts for sure
 
**fishingfor8** (10): a 10 for a top 10 finisher
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): why am i crying in the club right now
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): One of the best ballads ever made
 
**Stryxen** (10): the most 10 of all 10s
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Dan Smith originally wrote this song for Mozart but he passed it on to Bastille because it was too emotional to perform
 
**Tedyonce** (10): this is a crying anthem
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): ANGELIC
 
**vhqv1997** (10): Sophie Turner sounds a bit different here than on Game of Thrones. Her vocals rock though.
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): When we all fall asleep, where DO we go? Also, that violin solo just pulled on some heartstrings.
 
**vayyiqra** (8): I was going to leave a throwaway comment that was a reference to the Grimes song of the same name, but the lyrics caught me with their references to depression and suicide which is something I am all too familiar with so I am not going to do that now out of respect. :frowning: I don't love this song but I am giving it a high score because it made me feel deeper emotions than anything else in the rate. If you've ever felt the pull of the abyss then you know what I mean. :worried: :cry:
 
**radiofan15** (7.9): A ballad finally made a point...
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): This is inoffensive, which is a big step up from everything else on the album
 
**ManofOranges** (7): Oh lorde I sure hope that I age with grace.
 
**modulum83** (7): very pretty, I suppose
 
**waluigiest** (7): if you call a song oblivion.... I’m gonna compare it to Grimes
 
#Sleepsong Outsold
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Is this about falling asleep? Because it’s working.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I want to like it more but it’s kind of a snooze fest
 
**duhchappers** (5): Some interesting production but a total snoozefest otherwise. I can imagine this song being made by Lewis Capaldi and that is not the direction Bastille should be going in.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): dan’s falsetto has always been a little annoying especially when he gets whiny
