#Lights on
 
**1998tweety** (8): This is kind of weird but it also bops a lot
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): That rift is snazzy, but I think that's about it. Nothing else above average.
 
**napsandnetflix** (8): ryan tedder lights up my life
 
**Stryxen** (7.5): this is good commercial pop rock you didn't lie
 
**radiofan15** (7.3): ugh rock kings, Black Sabbath found unemployed
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I normally like songs that sound kinda grainy and faded out like this but this is missing some special spice.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): honestly pretty cool too; doesn't quite hit like the previous tracks though
 
#Lights Off
 
**modulum83** (6.8): Too much of 1R trying to act like a rock band just to get to that really good guitar solo
 
**duhchappers** (6): Sounds like a Walk the Moon song but more generic
 
**TCHALLA1966** (6): she’s cute
 
**CarlieScion** (5): this really drags on
 
**DaHumanTorch** (5): i literally have no opinion on this, it just...exists. so i guess i’ll give it a 5? i can’t even remember what it sounds like but i also didn’t dislike it so
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this sounds like onerepublic tried to write a muse song without knowing who muse is
 
**wavingwolves** (5): is this what onerepublic thinks led zeppelin sounds like
 
**ImADudeDuh** (4): whatever he thinks he did, he didn’t do it
 
**axestogrind** (3): This early 2010s grimey rock sound is so ugly I'm so glad we left it behind. The guitar solo slaps though.
 
**fadedblue09** (3): Should’ve just been an interlude tbh.
 
**ManofOranges** (3): I'm bored!
 
**vayyiqra** (3): Led Zeppelin LARP is in full swing here .Haha DAE drugs are cool? OneRepublic more like UnitedKingdom lol get it
 
**waluigiest** (3): I think this is noise
 
**vhqv1997** (2): This song sucks, it's so fucking boring, except for that instrumental break, which sounds straight out of a Coldplay song during Viva la Vida era.

the ordering on this album is kinda hilarious cause it goes calm/angry/chill/mad/happy/mad asf This wasnt the first song out but it was always pretty low  I personally thought it was cute but oh well
 
---
 
#Beep Boop
 
**fadedblue09** (10): Ok wow I’m digging the electronic production on this, definitely adds some color and energy to balance out the occasionally monotonous rock tracks.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this fuckin slaps
 
**Stryxen** (10): it's not fair that this song is so cute
 
**TCHALLA1966** (10): a potential 11 for me, fell in love with this way back and yes it’s not perfect but something in me just always came back to it
 
**waluigiest** (10): this fits neatly into the early 10s indie pop aesthetic that defined my taste in music
 
**duhchappers** (9): Probably the most straight pop song on the album, but still very distinct and cool. This is one of the songs I would tell people who say Imagine Dragons just makes one song over and over again to listen to. Still, the snyths can be a little grating depending on my mood, though the melody and lyrics are fantastic. This is another one that I probably like more just cause it makesme feel happy, andI am totally fine with that.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): this little electro bridge was a serve yas!
 
**ManofOranges** (9): Kind of a departure from the rock sound of the rest of the album, but I don't mind. I think it's a welcome change. It's really nice sounding and above all, who doesn't love an underdog?
 
**modulum83** (8.5): I...love this? Somehow?
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): I swear some of the synths are a bit too loud. This is a worse Top Of The World.
 
#For One Dollar Name A Women
 
**vayyiqra** (6): I like the quirky little synth riff, although as a veteran of alternative/indie music from the 2000s and 2010s I have had quite enough of bands shouting "hey!" a lot.
 
**1998tweety** (5): This is giving off PC music vibes...no thanks
 
**axestogrind** (5): this album's one AND ONLY dud
 
**vhqv1997** (5): This is the same song as On Top of the World but with a blue screen sound effect
 
**wavingwolves** (5): this sounds like a mashup where the instrumental and the vocals are from different songs
 
**CarlieScion** (1): i hate this i hate this i hate this i hate this
 
**DaHumanTorch** (1): what WAS this omg i have a migraine now thanks dan. i was soooo close to making this my 0 and i thought my 0 coming into this rate was easily set in stone
 
**radiofan15** (1): I'm sorry but this is the worst thing Imagine Dragons has ever done... and i'm including
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (0): this is literally just annoying
 
**ignitethephoenix** (0): too childish for me
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): This is such an ugly mess of a song
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (0): buddy COME ON

#Take me to church
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Kings of religious imagery, fka twigs who?
 
**napsandnetflix** (10): i thank God for ryan tedder every day
 
**TCHALLA1966** (10): but oh wow they truly did that a masterpiss
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): The lyrics are a little preachy (heh) but I like the sound of this with the strings and heavy percussion.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): solid chance this is one of the worst song ever made but i quite like it
 
**axestogrind** (7): I KNOW Y'ALL HATE THIS '7 YEARS' GENRE OF POP BUT THIS IS KIND OF GOOD
 
**duhchappers** (7): I was gonna say "just another generic OR song" but the backing vocals on the chorus take it up a point on their own.
 
#Burned by holy water
 
**radiofan15** (6.7): Good God, this album lost steam WAY too fast...
 
**ManofOranges** (6.5): The only man who could ever reach me was the son of a preacher man.
 
**1998tweety** (6): This is awkward
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): his daddy was a preacher y’all
 
**vayyiqra** (6): I was ready to hate this but once Catholic, always Catholic and churchy-themed pop songs get me every time. I miss my grandpa now. : (
 
**modulum83** (5): aight this shit is too straight for me i'm out
 
**Stryxen** (5): I forgot I was listening to this but I more or less enjoyed it
 
**vhqv1997** (5): This is the first time I've seen a choir used badly in a song. Kudos to that.
 
**fadedblue09** (4.5): Okay, I’m not sure what the message of the song is, but preacher/teacher is such a lame rhyme lmao. Also, the song drags a bit.
 
**CarlieScion** (4): this is lowkey terrible, mostly bc of the flat vocals in the verses
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): (grand)papa don’t preach
 
**waluigiest** (3): a few seconds in and I know this is not for me
 
**DaHumanTorch** (2.5): no. just no. plsss these lyrics were so bad and the other elements of the songs weren’t there either

#Cant stop wont stop
 
**napsandnetflix** (10): can't stop loving ryan tedder
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): finally, the truth come out. this is one of my favorite songs ever lol
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): Why do so many places show the song 'won't stop' when I google this? Weird.
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): Huge bop, his falsetto is good too
 
**DaHumanTorch** (8): wait i actually liked this a lot, the higher vocals on the chorus was nice and i loved the production
 
**ManofOranges** (7.5): Fine song but once again I'm not entirely liking Ryan Tedder's vocals here.
 
**modulum83** (7.5): The production on this is so weird and cool - the staticy almost trap-like drums, the chopped backing vocals, the massive reverb. It makes for a song that feels almost dystopian.
 
**axestogrind** (7): Ryan Tedder's head voice... yes
 
**vayyiqra** (7): I was going to put a shitposty comment like "we caaaan't stop we woooon't stop" but then this unexpectedly turned out to be a good, well-produced and even kind of moving song so : /
 
#Im calling the police
 
**radiofan15** (6.5): It's cute but I've seen cuter...
 
**vhqv1997** (6): That glitchy instrumental in the background gives me PTSD for all the times my computer crashed and destroyed my hours worth of work
 
**duhchappers** (5): The lyrics are not good and the reverb is annoying. Good bridge though
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (4): boring. gives me Trampoline vibes.
 
**waluigiest** (4): I think I want you to stop
 
**wavingwolves** (4): uh ryan tedder's falsetto here... that's a no for me
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (3): This is boring and it might have slipped by my ire but the tracks surrounding it are so strong it just sounds worse in comparison.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i didn’t like it
 
**fadedblue09** (1.5): Another unnecessarily long track. Also, Tedder's falsettos are like nails on a chalkboard ugh.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (0): wow this song is ass lol

#Mr.Worldwide
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Popheads stop hating ballads challenge.
 
**Stryxen** (8.5): wow I love french music
 
**fadedblue09** (8): Surprisingly, Ryan Tedder’s vocals doesn’t sound that bad on a ballad but damn, this could’ve used less production to be more soulful.
 
**napsandnetflix** (8): ugh international bilingual legend ryan tedder treating fans of all nationalities you LOVE to see it au revoir to the charts until you see them again with your next banger
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This kind of “medical drama commercial fodder” music is something I’m never quite sure about. On the one hand I do enjoy the sound of it, the commitment to drama and heavy orchestrations is nice, but at the same time it feels a little emotionally manipulative, as if the music is pushing me to feel more emotional about something that’s actually not that deep. This falls more on the good side of that than the bad side though.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (7): decent
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): nothing wrong with a sad bop
 
**vayyiqra** (7): Ballads are not bad, lads! This comment was made by chess gang
 
#Wants to oppress the french
 
**1998tweety** (6.5): I like parts of this but it's not really hitting the way I feel it should, sorry!
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): :-) i hate the french tho
 
**modulum83** (6.5): Instrumental is utterly gorgeous, but the vocal melody on top of it is really weak.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): It’s pretty sounding but overall very uninteresting
 
**vhqv1997** (6): I like the backing instrumental. That's all.
 
**wavingwolves** (6): i would like this a lot more if this was a instrumental track
 
**DaHumanTorch** (5): a cute lullaby moment
 
**waluigiest** (5): not to be balladphobic but I’m yawning. Ya know scratch that it’s not even a ballad it’s just slow
 
**radiofan15** (4.9): This is... nearly five minutes long, but why?
 
**duhchappers** (4): I think this is trying to be emotional but all i'm feeling is bored. The long instrumental breaks kill this one, it should not be 5 minutes long
 
**ManofOranges** (4): Au revoir to this song I could do without.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): this song was bad

#Beauty in the silence
 
**letsallpoo** (10): sure why not
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): short but fantastic
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): why is this minute and a half long outro better than almost every other song on this album
 
**vhqv1997** (10): I love this M83 song
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): Short and sweet.
 
**fadedblue09** (9): Well at least it does a good job of being an interlude.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is very pretty! I love the ethereal vibes to it, I was gonna say that I wish it was longer but then I realized I could just listen to [“Sea Of Voices” by Porter Robinson.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSooYPG-5Rg) Still, we love an interlude.
 
**radiofan15** (8.6): Oh, an interlude... I was actually getting into this but it just ends TOO SOON; why would you do that?
 
**ManofOranges** (8): Yes this is only like 1 and a half minutes long and it only has like 4 words but I actually like it more than some full length songs on this album so I'm going to give it a score that reflects that.
 
**waluigiest** (8): short and pleasant not gonna lie
 
**modulum83** (7.8): I'm a sucker for autotune
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): is this an interlude? I suppose. It’s vibey
 
**1998tweety** (7): Why isn't this the last track on the album? I like it but it should be swapped.
 
**DaHumanTorch** (6): this was a pretty interlude and tbh was better than a lot of these other album cuts
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): barely a song!
 
**vayyiqra** (6): It's hard to rate tracks this short but I love when albums have a coda like this. It just makes them feel complete.
 
#I am (respectfully) looking away
 
**Stryxen** (5.5): no thanks, but I fwu for trying <3
 
**cremeebrulee** (5): guessing this is an interlude
 
**TCHALLA1966** (5): well okay
 
**wavingwolves** (5): cute but then it just ends

I hadn't heard this remix until doing this rate and let me just tell you, i hate it. I cant believe the acoustic version is 10 times better,
 
---
 
#Clarity Stans
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): yes this is better than the original
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (8): cool but the original is better
 
**ManofOranges** (7): I feel like this is just a longer version of If I Lose Myself but with an incredibly drawn-out build-up to the drop and I think that's kind of annoying.
 
**PointlessBibliophage** (7): it's fine but it's worse imo
 
**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): ah so this is the version that became popular right
 
**vayyiqra** (6): This doesn't add much to the original song, being much the same only with a [the dreaded g-word] kind of EDM instrumental and drop, but it kind of bops, so I am rating it the same as before.
 
**fadedblue09** (5.5): Obviously the complete and superior version of the song. Too bad I still don't like it.
 
#Rather Be Stans
 
**skargardin** (5): Typical Alesso fair
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (4): The original was much better, I don’t know why they watered down the verses and made the drop gaudy.
 
**modulum83** (4): The arrangement is not as good, and the drop is not as good. Not sure why this exists.

**axestogrind** (3): Not inherently bad, but squeezed between Blank Space and Send My Love this is sort of gutter trash

In one of the reveals last month I mentioned how there was one artist that hadn't had any songs go out on day 1, bastille was really close to ot having anything go out but that last batch of yall who turned in scores really didnt vibe with this
 
---
 
#Designated Driver
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Again, swear I had heard this before. Kings of unnoticed bops, I guess?
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): gorgeous stuff innit
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): https://media.tenor.com/images/3e206565294f73b08e8b56eae235ff1b/tenor.png
 
**wavingwolves** (8): sounds like a conversation i would have with myself looking at the bathroom mirror at some party where i got too fucked up
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This starts off really promising and I really appreciate that he (they? is this a band?) went for something different. The song itself isn’t mind-blowing but points for experimentalism.
 
#Hasnt left their house in months
 
**1998tweety** (7): It's alright
 
**ManofOranges** (6): The "how am I gonna get" part of the hook just reminds me of Pompeii so basically all this song does is remind me of a better song.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (6): ok time to take off my stan goggles for a second. this is one of the many pesky songs i keep changing my mind on all the time. as of right now, it might have some charm to it but overall it's sluggish and boring, especially the chorus. some stans love this but no matter how much i try to force myself to like it i can't lie to myself. this is a very mediocre song at best. though i can't wait for it to grow on me again and i feel bad for giving it a 6 here lol
 
**fadedblue09** (5.5): Decent vocal performance but the song structure and production is pretty banal.
 
**DaHumanTorch** (5): the breathing in the background was quite uncomfortable
 
**duhchappers** (5): Another example of Dan's voice being failed by a sub-par melody, a problem that I think is the number one reason Bastille is one of my top ten favorite bands and not top 5.
 
**vayyiqra** (5): I thought this had potential but it was serving "bland indie ballad that's suitable mainly as background music for drinking in someone's attic bedroom as a teenager in the 2000s" so I can't say I loved it.
 
**modulum83** (3): I'm sorry, this is just so abrasive and unpleasant to listen to
 
**radiofan15** (1): Walking, taking a cab or an Uber, asking for a ride, crawling, having someone else carry you home... there are many ways sweetie...

#Respects social distancing and curfew laws
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Fucking bop. Was this pushed as a single? I hope so.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): this was so cute, i loved it. the lyrics were sweet (albeit a tad corny) and the hook was quite catchy
 
**fadedblue09** (8): I’m here for this mellow number, and it's a good display of his voice tbh.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): [Dan Reynolds when someone asks if he’s coming home to you](https://media1.tenor.com/images/835a88fecb85280b476612b3ec8ac34e/tenor.gif?itemid=10965027)
 
**ManofOranges** (8): I really like the hook and foremost about the song. It's just really soothing. Actually wait maybe I think that just applies to the whole of the song. It's very relaxing and very nice.
 
**modulum83** (8): For sure the black sheep of Night Visions, but the melody here is so sweet, a great summer jam
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): unpopular opinion imagine dragons is STILL good
 
**duhchappers** (7): This song is still good, but bleeds into generic too often for it too really resonate with me.
 
**Stryxen** (7): evrynyde evrynyde evrynyde
 
#Im just going to the store to the store
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): kind of lazy
 
**1998tweety** (6): This ain't doing it for me at all..
 
**vayyiqra** (5): This is a very fine and okay rock ballad, but it's too [g-word] to make an impact.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4.5): i think they just recorded the hook and then tried to make a whole song around it. not very good
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): I’d Rather Be Listening To People’s Choice-Award Winning 2007 Hit Home By Daughtry
 
**fishingfor8** (3): this is so generic
 
**ImADudeDuh** (3): wow i hate this chorus and also it sounds like there’s literally no reason to stay together??? So like why do you have to stay with her ???????

I wasn't a spotify user when this album came out (shout out itunes gang) so i have no emotional attachment to this song.
---
---
 
#If it bops it bops
 
**duhchappers** (10): This song is great. I have no idea what half of it means, nor do I care. It makes me happy. Especially the second verse just works on some deep level for me, satisfies some need that little else can. I expect few others to share this opinion but I would hate to live without this song.
 
**ManofOranges** (10): Another really feel good song for me. Is it just me or does Imagine Dragons have a tendency to involve like a chorus of voices that accompany the lead vocals? I don't really mind it though. I find it really endearing, fun, and often times impactful.
 
**modulum83** (10): Maybe the most musically complex song ID's ever written. And also the most bittersweet.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): an anti capitalist mood also why does “cha ching cha ching cha ching a ling a ling” sound kinda racist even though i know its just cash register sounds 💀
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (8.5): cute
 
**fadedblue09** (8): Love this cute catchy bop! This should’ve replaced some of those stale try-hard rock tracks on the standard edition.
 
**Stryxen** (8): it's UNFAIR how fun this is, but the chorus is ANNOYING
 
**wavingwolves** (8): okay, is this a socialist anthem? we stan
 
**fishingfor8** (7): I didnt hear this song until I got spotify like 3 years after this album came out cause it want on the version i got or something?? Idk it's pretty good though
 
#It's utter nonsense luv
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I couldn’t decide if this was a mega bop or just a lot of empty noise so I settled somewhere in the middle.
 
**1998tweety** (6.5): Meh
 
**radiofan15** (6): Dan sweetie what is this?
 
**rotating3Dtext** (6): chingling
 
**CarlieScion** (5): this album really starts to go downhill in the second half
 
**vayyiqra** (5): I am really confused why we are rating these three bonus tracks when there are tons more, but also I'm confused why this is a bonus track at all because it's kind of good, aside from the bad and cringy title.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): isn’t this a christmas song
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): yeah this just annoys me
 
**DaHumanTorch** (1): that “cha ching cha ching aling aling” part was one of the most atrocious things i’ve ever heard oh my god. slayyyter outsold
 
#Listen I didnt run an owl city stan blog in 2013 just for this comment to make a wild statement like this

For some reason??? This isn't on Spotify anymore??? I moved this to the main rate from the bonus cause I thought the rest of yall might've liked it as well but apparently not oh well

#Im falling so im taking my time
 
**modulum83** (10): A travesty how obscure this track is, should have been on the main album
 
**radiofan15** (10): This is giving me Antidotes/Total Live Forever-era Foals and I love ever second of it!... Also, this deserves better than being an iTunes bonus track!
 
**wavingwolves** (9): this is so good!!! why this isn't on spotify??????? literally their best song
 
**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): why was this a bonus track, it’s much better than a lot of the main album
 
**ManofOranges** (7.5): This one kinda just fell by the wayside for me. I don't think it's bad I just don't love it like the other songs.
 
**1998tweety** (7): Decent bop
 
**duhchappers** (7): This song is good, but I can't say it's much better than that. Nothing about it grabs me as much as some of the other bonus tracks, like Selene or Round and Round.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): “Favorite band ever- all there songs have stories to them, not just ‘I fell in love, we broke up’ like most of the music today” spoken like a true youtube comment
 
#Would've liked any of the other 5 ID songs user roxieloxie rejected for this rate
 
**fadedblue09** (5): Not bad, but not essential either. Also the chorus was awful.
 
**rotating3Dtext** (5): It’d have a better score without the “woaah” type chorus
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): why are all these bonus tracks so forgettable
 
**vayyiqra** (5): One of my least favourite things about this band is that they tend to write lyrics that are super vague, which is meant to be so they're up for interpretation, but sometimes there's just nothing there. This is one such song that sounds fine but it's frustrating that it has nothing to say.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): at this point i'm fully annoyed.
 
**Tedyonce** (0): he says the words "brother/sister/father" a lot throughout this whole album huh...this isn't particularly bad, its just the most faceless song (to me) on this record

#Knows what they want
 
**fadedblue09** (10): I love the production on this. The instrumental in the chorus is an excellent blend of electronic, pop, rock and folk. Best track on the album by far.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): this sounds just okay at first. then that synth comes in the chorus and sends my ears into absolute exhilaration.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): this is everything i needed in my life in 2014
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): ooo oo oooo oo ooooo oo
 
**napsandnetflix** (9): ryan tedder is what i wanted
 
**radiofan15** (8.6): I really like the low-key vibe of the verses... also, the production on the chorus is just * chef's kiss *
 
**wavingwolves** (8.5): is this just sweet but psycho pop rock version
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): A lot of noise but it’s good noise so I’ll allow it.
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): This got me feeling some type of way and I'm here for it. Does get a little repetitive though.
 
**duhchappers** (7): Some really good production but the chorus is kinda flat
 
#Indicisive
 
**modulum83** (7): This sounds like an EDM remix of itself
 
**ImADudeDuh** (5): i do not recall anything from this song and i am currently listening to it right now
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): i can’t imagine a one republic filler track to sound any different from this
 
**vayyiqra** (5): I'll put your poison in my veins / They say the best love is insane, yeah / I'll light your fire 'til my last day / I'll let your fields burn around me, around me were these lyrics written by Josef Stalin
 
**axestogrind** (4): This is SOOO middling I've never heard a song so empirically mid
 
**ManofOranges** (4): I think this one is boring. There's too much repetition, and while I don't think that means it's bad, I don't think it musically has the ability to make that repetition at all interesting.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this is...really boring
 
**DaHumanTorch** (3): pls this was so boring, literally went NOWHERE

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): horny on main
 
**Stryxen** (10): kinda beautiful but the way it feels like he's going to rhyme with once and then goes with "youuu" almost made me put this at 0
 
**1998tweety** (9): Cute lyrics and the song bops
 
**TCHALLA1966** (9): A great song I only knew about it because it was a X factor winner song but the original much better...obviously
 
**axestogrind** (8): Honestly THE perfect encapsulation of this period of pop. The folksy production, the anthemic chorus designed for a car ride singalong, the random 'HEY!' chants... I am suddenly 14 years old downloading Flappy Bird on my iPod Touch getting ready to watch an episode of How I Met Your Mother
 
**modulum83** (8): what if Ho Hey, but actually good
 
**vhqv1997** (8): This song is as standard boy poprock as it comes. At least it does the trope well.
 
**radiofan15** (7.8): OneRepublic song #3596739 kinda made some points
 
**wavingwolves** (7.5): [zoe deschanel voice] to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (7): It’s cute but I feel like it goes on a bit too long without getting more interesting, despite the shifts it makes it stays flat (though not unpleasantly so).
 
#Not cute enough to be good tho
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): im forever alone so i can’t relate to these lyrics
 
**duhchappers** (6): I liked it more at first but it has such a repetitive structure it wore out quickly
 
**fadedblue09** (6): Sounds like a fun. reject.
 
**vayyiqra** (6): This is a really [g-word] radio-friendly pop-rock song that's painfully 2013 and sounds like off-brand fun., yet I kind of like it. Stream All I Need by Foxes, a very underrated pop album
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (5.5): this one ain’t that bad ig
 
**ImADudeDuh** (5): Mom, can we have If I Lose Myself? We have If I Lose Myself at home. If I Lose Myself at home:
 
**DaHumanTorch** (3): the only thing i need is to unhear this. i thought the chorus was gonna slap on the first few bits but then after like three seconds of it, it got unbearably annoying
 
**ManofOranges** (2): I really just don't like this song. For me it is easily the worst in the rate. It's boring, the lyrics are stupid, I don't like it. And how about the lyric, "if we only die once" There's no ifs about it we only die once and that's a fact, what a stupid lyric. At least he takes that thing, flips, and reverses it by the end of the song but by that point the damage has already been done.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (2): the song is annoying from the start but the bridge ruins is completely. also YOLO is a timestamp that makes any song age like milk.

**ManofOranges** (8): Out of all the bonus tracks I guess this is the one I like the most but it is an Adele song so I guess that makes sense.
 
**modulum83** (8): what you know about adele? NOTHING
 
**fadedblue09** (7.8): Not bad as I was dreading, considering how I am not a fan of Tedder’s voice. Maybe they just need better production that would compliment Tedder's vocals.
 
#Hates men
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (4): honestly I didn’t even like it when Adele sang it, and she’s *Adele*
 
**radiofan15** (3.1): The sudden materialization of the sunglasses was the most interesting part of his performance...
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): Men keep thinking they can cover Adele songs just because Linkin Park did once. You’re not Linkin Park though
 
**vayyiqra** (3): I like Adele and I like the original song, but this also feels like a "hilarious joke cover by some random YouTuber" kind of thing where the comedy is supposed to come from how unfitting his voice is, and that is not a compliment. On the whole this is a pointless cover

**vhqv1997** (9): r/antiwork is shook
 
**fadedblue09** (8.7): The superior bonus track. I love the energy this exudes! Why wasn’t this on the main album?
 
**modulum83** (8.3): "Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Workers of the world, unite!"
 
**DaHumanTorch** (8): this was insanely catchy, i don’t think this will be out of my head for a while. another song that didn’t deserve the bonus track treatment
 
**duhchappers** (8): A really good bass-line, and a really good melody. The lyrics go from cliche to really good and back with every other line. I wish this was on Spotify, I would definitely listen to it consistently if I could easily.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): This song is 80% chorus but it bops
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): i can’t tell if this is pro or anti capitalism
 
**Stryxen** (8): they said Shake It almost a decade before charli, and she had the audacity to not feature them on Shake It
 
**wavingwolves** (8): straightfoward songs work so much better for them. this is really nice!
 
**radiofan15** (7.6): This is the kind of generic I can get behind... but also I can see this is a bonus track...
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): Bops a bit
 
**axestogrind** (7): 'Caught up in the middle of a headache and a heartbreak' is such a cute lyric
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (6.6): this is nice but it’s so hard to care by the end of this album
 
#Landlords
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): when the money is high that is indeed when we start to spend
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): stream shake it by metro station
 
**vayyiqra** (5): [I really hope nobody makes a cringey joke about Marxism in the comments on this] This is alright even if the lyrics really could've used more effort put into them. It's rather underwhelming as a closing track though. I wish we'd ended the album on Nothing Left to Say / Rocks.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (3): pretty sure there was a better version of this somewhere earlier in this album
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (1): annoying
 
**fishingfor8** (0): this song is obnoxious

#Somebody call 9-1-1
 
**1998tweety** (9.5): Oh wow this is a massive bop.
 
**modulum83** (9.3): Those fucking DRUMS sound absolutely amazing. Song's beautiful and emotional too.
 
**Stryxen** (9): I shouldn't be getting chills from OneRepublic in 2020
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I was reading a romantic slow burn 100k+ word fan fiction for a show I’ve never watched while listening to this and it really enhanced the experience.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): set me on fiiiiiiiiiire
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): This boy is on fire.
 
**ManofOranges** (8): I'm kind of confused by him singing about how he wants whoever he's singing to to burn his bridges down. Does that means he wants them to like delete his LinkedIn account or sumn??? I'm not entirely sure but the song is fine.
 
**napsandnetflix** (8): ryan tedder will never burn this bridge
 
#Arson is illegal wtf
 
**vhqv1997** (7.5): This song started out fine but somehow never reached a big enough climax to be memorable
 
**radiofan15** (7.3): His falsetto is just something else, not everyone can compare to that...
 
**CarlieScion** (7): at this point im realizing that every song on this album sounds exactly the same
 
**DaHumanTorch** (7): i loved the “set me on fiiiiiire” high note part
 
**wavingwolves** (7): sometimes it sounds like shawn mendes is singing...
 
**fadedblue09** (6.8): Again, there are a lot of good elements here but I feel like they were mishmashed together and in the end, we got something...banal.
 
**TCHALLA1966** (6.8): tho a little boring I kinda I still enjoy it and them high notes Ryan hitting
 
**axestogrind** (6): Why is the fadeout so weak if you're going to do a fadeout commit to it please
 
**duhchappers** (6): This is pretty much the exact middle of the road for One Republic. I kinda like it, but I can find better versions of it all over the place.
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): idk what i expected from one republic
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): wow this is generic
 
**vayyiqra** (5): Tonight we are young / So let's set the world on fire / We could burn brighter / Than the sun

One of my least listened too songs on the album, I predicted this as a day one for Bastille and i'm not surprised
 
---
 
#AND I HEAR YOU CALLING IN THE DEAD OF NIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT
 
**fadedblue09** (10): Love the sparse electronic vibes on this one.
 
**fishingfor8** (10): bastille ballads > normal ballads
 
**ManofOranges** (10): A very lowkey type song but I think that plays to its strengths here. The previous 3 songs were more loud and in-your-face so it's nice to have a more laidback song that's still enticing. Although I have to say that it doesn't quite make overjoyed like you would think a song with this name would.
 
**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): AND I HEAR YOU CALLING IN THE DEAD OF NIIIIIIIIGHT
 
**Tedyonce** (10): AND I HEAR YOU CALLING IN THE DEAD OF NIIIIIIIIIIIGHT
 
**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): I swear I’ve heard all these songs before, but never knew they were by Bastille.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): god there’s so many little details in this song that are so good but maybe the best one is the choir that plays for a split second right before the last chorus..beauty
 
**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): i wasn’t sold on this one at first but by the end, i really ended up liking it. the production was gorgeous
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): this instrumental is literally car radio by twenty one pilots and i can not get over it.
 
**duhchappers** (7): Bastille is such a good band that I can call this one of their weaker cuts. It is still quite good, but suffers a little from a weak melody and repetitive chorus
 
**vayyiqra** (7): Life is a mystery / Everyone must stand alone / I hear you call my name / And it feels like home ... :pensive:
 
#Im trying to sleep shut up
 
**1998tweety** (6.5): Wasn't expecting a ballad with a title like that, it's alright.
 
**modulum83** (6.5): This does something cool with the mixture of piano ballad and electronica. It's pretty spooky but I'm not sure if it works for me.
 
**CarlieScion** (6): this chorus is lowkey annoying
 
**wavingwolves** (6): it's true we be talking
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (5.5): this is just a cute lil emotional song
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This starts and then it just continues until it ends.
 
**radiofan15** (2.4): NOPPITY NOPE
