---  

**shineflyer (4): those gunshots are great for those of us who have fallen asleep by this point**
---

---


**God Bless the Gays**
--- 

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): def my fave from lust for life... super slept on and a perfect mix of cute and bop

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): I cry

**chipsi1** (10): God Bless Coachella - And All the Beautiful Children's Children in it

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Where were you when Lana invented feminism and equality?

**jimmy345960** (10): ok so this song completely changed my outlook for the album. I thought I would like only the singles and that's it. Honestly this song is just a beautiful statement and I love every second of it. This opened my eyes to Lana. I actually like the second half of this album better than the first.

**lady\_sable** (10): feminist anthem, makes me think of how gay i am, beautiful instrumental, overall bop

**m4ttycool** (10): This could've been my 11

**theNealCutter** (10): probably one of her best songs to date. She may suck at caring, but there's something about this naivete delivery that makes me think she means well, she's just not aware of what's really happening.

**whatareblackhole** (10): YES YES YES rally song, fuck my shit up!

**didney-worl** (9.5): pow pow

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): being gay but can understand still

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): i am not American but I like to believe I am a beautiful woman and this song was beautiful, too

**nickl00** (9): this needs more respect, it's a little slow at time though

**skargardin** (9): Patriotism done right.

**kappyko** (8.5): why didn't she just make the title "God Bless America"

**melodyllic\_** (8.5): that chorus is everything!! the gun-shots are misplaced and the production is a bit soupy, but folk ballads like these are what lana does best

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.3): do u ever remember MetroBoomin produced this lmao. anyway this almost starts to drag and then the heavenly bridge comes in WHEW!

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): this makes me emotional and i'm not even american

**twat\_brained** (8.2): I just hope she's not saying God should bless right-wingers/Drumpf supporters. Minus 0.5 for the gunshot noises

**awryj** (8): The last chorus is really beautiful, especially the arpeggiating background vocals, and I love how it's combined with gunshot samples

**cyborglilith** (8): this is SO nostalgic-sounding and makes me want to cry

**MrSwearword** (8): I admit to being a smidge bored by this but I softened to it I'm not acting like this is bad [National Anthem and Art Deco will always be worse than this]

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Friendly reminder that Milo Yiannopoulos quoted Lana's previous statement about not being interested in feminism in his trashy cancelled book, which is why we should all stream this as much as we can. Also, I just noticed that these are fireworks, not gunshots. Wig.

**stansymash** (8): ooh i am BACK on BOARD baby, hell yeahhh

**technoprayers** (8): , a beautiful track

**VodkaInsipido** (8): who would have thought Metro Boomin could collab with Lana del Rey

**RandomRocketKat** (7.5): feminist witch queen

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Nice chorus but verses need work.

**nooodisaster** (7): This is the most 2017 title ever and I LIIIIIVE.

**survivorjdmarina** (7): I like the message behind it, and I think that Lana going through a more pollitical stance is great.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I can't believe Lana invented the United States

**vayyiqra** (7): that's it, we've reached peak Lana folks, time to go home

**Verdantshade** (7): love the vintage new york sound of this

**cucumberanti** (6.5): The prechorus is the best part of the song.

**robbiec\_** (6.5): I didn't think this would work but it totally did GONE SHOOT ME BOOMBOOM
 
**God Bless Those Who Have to Sit Through This**
---

**dropthehammer11** (6): god this is boring

**Solovrinne** (6): The message is nice but the gunshots throw everything off.

**static\_int\_husp** (6): This feels like it's way to repetitive.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): decent. underwhelming. could be a lot better. could be a lot worse.

**fourchip** (5.5): Lana Please Stop With These Long Song Titles

**Marshynarsh** (5): as a non-american these sort of songs fall pretty flat for me. I do like the gunshots in the chorus though

**natsby** (5): the melodies are good and again, I love Lana's singing, but I don't like the song otherwise. I feel like nationalism played straight suits her much less than the campy outrageousness of songs like American (for instance). also, I get the feeling this is very much a very genuine political(tm) song, and the shallowness really gets to me.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): i feel very republican after this. like have some male country singer cover this and all the gays will scream for the hills

**Elitefourbrad** (4): I mean I'm all for feminism but can we do it with a song that doesn't actually suck?

**gannade** (2): The first verse had me shook and then the rest was a mistake

**enecks** (1): The gunshots made me giggle. But lol America is not worth blessing it's fundamentally flawed as a nation. This is just not a good song

**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): i just don't understand this at all like why does she sing patriotic shit like this it just doesn't make sense to me also why do you people enjoy this

**SkyBlade79 (5): I only know who stevie nicks is because of AHS but her voice isn't good**
--- 
  
--- 

My take is similar to this: 

**twat\_brained** (7.6): I feel deceived because the intro and verses reminds me of "Sign Of The Times" and every time i listen to this I'm just reminded of how good that song is and how much I'd rather listen to that one.

**Beautiful People, Beautiful Problems, Beautiful Songs, Beautiful Ass, Beautiful Everything**
--- 


**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): THORGY WAS ROBBED

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): me when my friend has a problem

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): [This is basically the classy redition of this song.](https://youtu.be/vlCWI80hFZ0)

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Steve Nicks is a legend

**gannade** (10): The collab no one thought of but everyone needed

**m4ttycool** (10): WORK STEVIE YOU BETTER FUCKING WORK

**Mudkip1** (10): YAAAAAASS QUEEN MOTHER STEVIE SAVE ME FROM MY PAST SINS AND BLESS MY SOUL INTO A NEW STATE OF LOVE AND PEACE AND PROSPERITY WITH YOUR HEAVENLY VOICE BITCH COME THROUGH AND SERVE BOPS

**technoprayers** (10): , One of the highlights on the album

**therokinrolla** (10): Fucking. Gorgeous. The melody, the lyrics, the hope. This is an incredible ballad, one of Lana's best. The harmonization between Lana and Stevie leaves me shook every time.

**Verdantshade** (10): holy shit can a song be any more beautiful? I fucking love stevie nicks

**wtucker4** (10): Thorgy Thor did so well in this!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): wig? did you just say wig?

**lady\_sable** (9.5): i still can't believe that this collab like...happened. our mortal ears were not meant to hear it.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): Speechless. Vintage beauty. How can it sound so modern and so retro at the same time?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Reminded Fleetwood Mac has the highest rated song ever

**cyborglilith** (8.5): God Bless America and Stevie's verse

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): a welcome change in sound

**skargardin** (8.5): When Stevie Nicks started singing the first time I listened to this I got major chills, this song is so fucking beautiful.

**CarlieScion** (8): I love that Lana got to sing with Stevie Nicks

**melodyllic\_** (8): cute, but it floats by without making any impact

**nooodisaster** (8): YAAAASSSSS, FUCKING WORK STEVIE NICKS!!!!!!!!

**whatareblackhole** (8): I never would have guessed their voices would blend this well, they're so distinct. I love this.

**Marshynarsh** (7.5): I really like who Lana picks for her collaborations, they always mesh well with her voice and aesthetic

**enecks** (7): This song's lyrics start out so cool and witchy, could you commit to that?

**kappyko** (7): i love stevie nicks but what

**MrSwearword** (7): just for managing to snag Stevie Nicks at all.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I want to say 'highest rated song of all time, legend' but, wow, Stevie's voice has gone down a lot. It's still awesome to see two female artists make an otherwise satisfying song, though. Very nice lyrics here as well.

**rickikardashian** (7): YAAAASS STEEVIE YOU BETTER FUCKING WORKKK YAAAAASSS

**robbiec\_** (7): flex and I feel Lana enjoyed every second of working with the white witch

**stansymash** (7): Perfectly Passable! Thanks Stevie!

**survivorjdmarina** (7): Overall, I don't have a lot to say about this album besides the fact that Stevie's feature on this sounds good enough, but a little unfitting.


**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): so nice of Lana to give an up and coming artist a chance like Kanye did with Paulo McCourtney

**natsby** (6): I love Stevie Nicks and I love Lana but this would be so boring it anyone else were singing it.

**RandomRocketKat** (6): "Blue is the color of the planet from up above" oh wow science

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): speaking of problems

**vayyiqra** (6): how did this even happen

**VodkaInsipido** (6): okay but just okay

**Stevie sweetie, I'm so sorry…**
---

**dropthehammer11** (5): this drags hard

**nickl00** (5): I like Stevie, but the lyrics are bad

**Raykel** (5): Ugh I love Stevie Nicks but they really could've done something interesting. Nicks can write fucking hooks so why didn't she?

**shineflyer** (5): Despite her voice having gone downhill, Stevie Nicks stills knows harmony.

**Solovrinne** (5): I don't see the appeal, I hate the chorus, it doesn't sound right.

**strawberryswing1** (5): what a stupid chorus....lana i can't believe you're making me give a bad score to the queen

**theNealCutter** (5): calling it "beautiful problems" is invalidating and shows that they show no recognition of other people's struggles.

**dirdbub** (2.5): https://i.imgur.com/awb5LBQ.png

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): was stevie nicks even in this 

**Twins**

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD (5): is she recording this from inside a washing machine**
--- 

Is it cute? Yes. Does it lack a little? Yes. It is a nice opener, and the transition into Pills is amazing. However, I am not surprised to see this little bop leave us in the 30s.

--- 

**Hang with Me, Annie, You're so Cool**
--- 

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (10): Love her voice here.

**CarlieScion** (10): I was expecting something very different, but this is actually really good?

**cyborglilith** (10): WE'RE NOT MEANT FOR THIS WORLD

**fourchip** (10): you and me, we weren't meant for this world

**kappyko** (10): slay

**Mudkip1** (10): literally the best run in any album ever and its 6 songs long like whew what a ride i love annie

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): some absolutely gorgeous (if slightly macabre) imagery here. it's actually really interesting to hear her be this vulnerable at the beginning of an album; it's a hint for the emotional rollercoaster the rest of it is

**enecks** (9): This song hangs well in my scoreboard

**melodyllic\_** (9): really subdued and muted, almost as if annie's voice was put through a filter. the lyrics talk about the disintegration of a relationship, and her voice sounds fragile and distant, like she's been lost already.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): kind of a really weak opener, to be honest. I feel like the only reason this exists is because nothing else on the tracklist has a good beginning to be the opener.

**specfagular** (9): LOVE this opener eyes Halsey

**nooodisaster** (8.5): A simple and emotional start to the album. Fucked up outcasts is a role we can all relate to, and St. Vincent plays it perfectly. And Jack's slow build up is gorgeous to listen to.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Very beautiful opening-gives me Running Up That Hill vibes, except more subtle and less grandiose. The production is a little too subdued for my taste, though-I think the effect it's aiming for would have been much clearer if Annie's voice wasn't hidden under a veil of sound.

**stansymash** (8.5): annie don't spook me by opening up your album with a lowkey cut. i need to know if this is your 5th perfect album in a row (it turns out it is), hit me with the good juice first.

**1998tweety** (8.3): A great opener, gives you a good feel for the rest of the album. As always I love Annie's interesting choice in lyrics.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (8): its not really a big song, but still kind of nice. Also, she performed with Sufjan at the Oscars so I can't give her a bad score out of principle, Mystery of Love is SOTY even if it was technically released last year.

**skargardin** (8): Nice little opener, love the synths.

**survivorjdmarina** (8): The voice effects were snatchedt and I love.

**whatareblackhole** (8): I really like this song, especially how she's, like, singing it on someone's voicemail.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): Kinda drony but not too bad. A middler.

**m4ttycool** (7.5): I'm not meant for this world

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): yeah

**MrSwearword** (7): weird as shit for an opener but potential is there

**natsby** (7): I like how it's a slow, quiet but tense opener. the production is also so deliberate and really creates this sense of anticipation.

**nickl00** (7): First time listening to this album, oh man I like this

**RandomRocketKat** (7): phone call goals

**technoprayers** (7): , a cute and fuzzy opener to the album

**Hang this up, don't touch it**

**theNealCutter** (7): interesting opener. I'm not really sure what to say? I like it though.

**vayyiqra** (7): cool production but not that memorable

**mokitsu** (6.5): Good I guess? There's not a lot going on.

**dropthehammer11** (6): Cool sound but kinda went nowhere at all

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This is the only song on this record that isn't great honestly. It's a weak intro and doesn't accurately prepare you for how damn good the album is.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): This song is like that tired 'was this recorded on a potato' joke but like, it really sounds like it was recorded on a 2004 ipod nano and I have no idea why

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): It's sounds like a buildup to a good song. IDK it's just too lowkey. It really needs an extra something to make it feel more alive.

**Solovrinne** (5): it already sounds dated

**WilsonJason** (5): yawn

**awryj** (4.5): "but we're different, daaaaad" 20 years later

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3.5): not a great opener

**SkyBlade79** (3): can't dig the low audio quality and boredom

**kappyko (6): i hold u like a weapon**
---

TBH I keep forgetting that this exists. I always think of Sober II when I think Meldorama interludes, and this just gets glazed over. 

Eh. The lyric 'cause you're not what, you thought you were' is poetic and fun, but a lot of it is essentially a remix of Liability, and an unneeded one at that. 

--- 

**[IM A LIABILITY]( https://giphy.com/gifs/1BXa2alBjrCXC)**

**RandomHypnotica** (11): This is my 11 because it is honestly one of the most powerful tracks on Melodrama, and it's a really optimistic, moving and beautiful track that is totally going to get underrated by all you twinks. But it should hopefully make it to Day 2...

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): wholesomeness on a kind of sad album, wig gone

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I don't know why we are rating this song but I'll give it a 10 anyway.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Jack Antonoff is my daddy

**nooodisaster** (10): Lorde's two minute reprises are better than some of y'all's fav's whole career. IJS. This song is a 10 not only for being an emotional, pitch-black bop, but also perfectly tying the album together. So far, there's been two main motifs: the party and the relationship. "Green Light" opens with Lorde heartbroken at a party, and then Sober flashes back to the beginning of that relationship. But the party theme and the relationship can seem separate. The line "And maybe all this is the party/Maybe the tears and the highs we breathe" connects those two motifs in the first of two revelations. The other comes right after. In Liability, Lorde laments the fact that she'll always be a liability to other people. We hear that again, echoes of "I'm a liability" playing in the back. But here she whispers over and over to herself, "But you're not what you thought you were." Fav line: "Maybe all this is the party."

**Raykel** (10): I already know this gonna be one of the firsts on Melodrama to go out but it's so underrated. This is the song that finalizes her moving on and realizing how well off she is on her own. Even outside the context of the album that message is still felt. But yall just hate to see women thrive huh??? Sexism: found alive smh

**specfagular** (10): if liability makes you feel sad this bitch just comes up and kicks you while you're crying. Love it

**Tedyonce** (10): It drives me insane how under-appreciated this song is ugh

**theburningundead** (10): Easily the most underrated song on the album, maybe it's just because the standard of songs on Melodrama is so high but I really don't think this song gets the love it deserves. It's a follow-up thematically to Liability and really an essential companion piece to it, "but you're not what you thought you were" is such a relatable sentiment for anyone growing up and it highlights one of the album's greatest strengths and most important messages, its emphasis on self-reflection and personal growth.

**jimmy345960** (9.3): This is my lowest on Melodrama, it is pretty damn high tho.

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (9): Beautiful way to end the storyline of the album.

**stansymash** (9): the worst song on the album. unforgivable

**InfernalSolstice** (8.5): kinda doesn't work separate from the album but works really well in the album

**Leixander** (8.5): This feels like a flashback in a new episode of a series and I like it.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8.5): Within the album it's a prefect thematic closer. But this doesn't work outside the context of the album.

**swadadu** (8.5): Without this song, the album would feel incomplete.

**whatareblackhole** (8.5): I appreciate this one because I think it ties in the loose party theme she talked about really well. But the line with "all the kids in the choir" irks me for some reason.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Getting Imogene Heap vibes from this. Reprises are usually the signs of pretention on an album but honestly I don't care because this is great

**enecks** (8): This is the moment of the album when the arc completes, even if it's basically a buildup to Perfect Places.

**lady\_sable** (8): i didn't like this the first few times i listened to it but now i think i see what she was going for. it's still my least favorite off the album but i like it more now.

**melodyllic\_** (8): a nice track, but more transition-like than anything

**natsby** (8): I don't know how fair it is to have this song rated by itself. I would rate it lower as a song, but I feel like this tightly wound concept album which would feel incomplete without this little refrain.

**skargardin** (8): It's a sweet reprise but imo it could've been left out of the album.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeoH3FbAX-Y

**theNealCutter** (8): queen of growth. "Maybe all this is the party, maybe we just do it violently" is a lyric that struck me unexpectedly. The realization that maybe I was in the relationship too much, that maybe I wasn't thinking straight when I was with him. It's cool, to feel it, to understand through your time alone, you find out that you both had mistakes in the relationship.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): the lowest ranked song is a 2 minute interlude and it's an 8. that's how good this album is.

**vayyiqra** (8): nice if superfluous

**The 7s for this song were really on the nose**
---

**fourchip** (7.5): ugh

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): It's good, I like it, but it just seems a bit out of place. I don't know.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): I can't imagine ever listening to this outside of the context of the album but it works really well within those parameters!

**cucumberanti** (7): Liability reprise @ Liability - I am you but (emotionally) stronger

**dropthehammer11** (7): LiAbIlItY

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Most forgettable song here, but it's not as bad as you'd think it'd be. I actually like it a little, now that I think about it, though I'm not sure it actually had a place on this album.

**RandomRocketKat** (7): this is nice wow

**Solovrinne** (7): Reminds me of SZA. I have to say this song did not need a reprise. I would have put this at the end of Liability, which is already a short song.

**twat\_brained** (7): I'm not sure how this is supposed to tie back to "Liability". Something which would've helped was writing it in the same key just like she did with "Sober" and "Sober II".

**Verdantshade** (7): the only filler on the album. it serves a purpose in the narrative but it's the only song I wouldn't go back to if I was listening to the tracks individually

**ooph**

**CarlieScion** (5): Kinda unnecessary, could've just been the outro on Liability

**MrSwearword** (5): the Imogen Heap moment doesn't work for a song that had something going RIGHT for Lorde.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): okay you made us all sad we get it

**SkyBlade79** (3): sober reprise outpeaked

**Elitefourbrad** (1): Unneeded tbh, reprises are never my cup of tea.

**gannade** (1): 100% unnecessary

--- 

Ok this is a bop and I'm disappointed in you guys for not giving this more love. 

I say that, but this got 17 10s, 9 9s, and an 11, and isn't controversial. 

This is an amazing song, and features no cringy or out of place lyrics. Straight up bop. 

--- 

**Heaven is Right Here** 
--- 

**SkyBlade79** (11): A modern epic, for sure. The scale is so large and great to listen to. Nothing in this rate is quite as good as the crescendo to this song. Not really an 11, but something on this album deserved it

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): this was my mid-summer jam when i walked down a street looking like a drowned harassed rat

**CarlieScion** (10): This was nearly my 11 bc it's such a bop

**cyborglilith** (10): mwah

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): That fucking chorus is 20/10. It's so theatrical I love it.

**dropthehammer11** (10): WHY WAS THIS A BONUS TRACK FOR FUCKS SAKE

**lady\_sable** (10): what a banger!!

**Leixander** (10): I CAN PUT ON A SHOW

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): single-worthy tbh

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): i got goosebumps this song is neat

**twat\_brained** (9.4): The drums in the verses are really what make the song but the chorus is also killer. This is what a deluxe track SHOULD be!

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): An immediate standout on Hopeless Fountain Kingdom; it still draws on the sounds from Badlands, but instead of making this sound cringeworthy, Halsey manages to make the most out of her previous moody sounds, turning this into an epic thrill that reminds you of a young adult novel that you have a strong urge to read, even if it sounds a little too campy.

**shineflyer** (9): kinda unoriginal verses, but an explosive chorus makes up for that.

**skargardin** (9): One of my favorite tracks on the album.

**1998tweety** (8.9): I love this song because it feels so much like Badlands and I'm glad there was at least one song that resembled it, but still sounded different in its own way. It's got the things that originally made me a fan of Halsey, but still sets itself apart from her older work and belongs on this album.

**melodyllic\_** (8.5): the chorus has the perfect amount of drama and movement, which makes it more boppy than 'eyes closed' but allows her to retain the moody, sadboi feel

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): i like how dramatic this is

**enecks** (8): Another BOP served by our tribi queen. Bridge is a bit of wasted time, but otherwise yaaassss queen.

**MrSwearword** (8): only because the production fucking knocks

**technoprayers** (8): , one of the highlights on the album

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Another damn good track, a lot of energy here from Halsey. Cringy lyrics but what do you expect :shrug:

**vayyiqra** (8): atmospheric

**Verdantshade** (8): gets an 8 just for that chorus

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): This track is good... by Halsey's standards.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): i have to be in ~a mood~ for this one

**chipsi1** (7): this sounds like blow your mind and i think i'm the only one who actually thinks it sounds like blow your mind and it's killing me

**gannade** (7): dear lord what are these lyrics lmao omg halsey PLEASE i cant. i will admit the binding/hiding rhyme is really catchy despite being really forced. and halsey sings her heart out (the best she can)

**kappyko** (7): kinda personality-less and not really as grabbing as previous songs

**natsby** (7): what a hook.

**nickl00** (7): this is my fucking hype song.

**theNealCutter** (7): this is basically a sex song. I don't like how it's just a series of build-up. Whatever ya'll guys say about Lorde's Sober and how it never explodes to anything, I feel the same with this song.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): this entire song is a buildup to a slut drop that never comes

**robbiec\_** (6.8): how she sings heaven in hiding is hot but there is something off putting about the pre-chorus

**cucumberanti** (6.5): The thumping production is so good, the prechorus really builds up but doesn't pay off in the end.

**dirdbub** (6.5): the chorus melody reminds me of "Stole The Show" by Kygo

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Her vocals sound like she needs a cough drop, but beyond that it's not bad.

**Heaven is Hiding**
---

**RandomRocketKat** (6.5): people said this was supposed to be a bop, where?

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): let me put on a show for you daddy let me put on a shoooooow

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): The chorus is a big letdown after the energetic verses. I expected it to explode and it just fizzled.

**whatareblackhole** (6): I'm not entirely sure what this song is about? Lol the vocalizations are also kind of weird for me

**Raykel** (5): The melody is so clunky. I feel like she goes everywhere. Like the "I can put on a show" part sounds like she didn't know where to go there.

**Solovrinne** (5): Lyrics are too on the nose, I can't get into it.

**stansymash** (5): im interested in hearing how incoherent these comments get as i lose my sanity

**specfagular** (4): I really don't like this. Kween of emo high school poetry projects

**awryj** (11): an instant 10 that eventually became an 11. gj lana

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): I thought of this as boring, at first, but the more I gave the album full listens the more I started to cry by the time this track came on. It's a pretty depressing song, but the fact that Lana still brings up a spark of hope at the end just goes to show how much she's changed. The 'it's hot!' parts are honestly iconic.

**Solovrinne** (11): This is the song, her magnum opus, up there with Shades of Cool and Ride as her masterpieces. I wish it would last forever. The pre-chorus and chorus are ENRAPTURING, and the bridge takes it from a 10 to an 11. Perfection in every sense of the word. I doubt she could ever top this song.

**natsby** (10): this is an unrelenting, excruciating, but somehow very listenable and beautiful song. there's so much going on here, but the melodic and rhythmic cadences coming together in 'it's fucking hot, hot!' is particularly euphoric.

**swadadu** (10): IT'S FUCKING HOT

**Verdantshade** (10): HONEYMOON VIBES!!! the bridge is chill inducing

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): why did she snap on so many of the bridges on this album?

**enecks** (9): YASS BRING BACK THE MOODINESS

**kappyko** (9): jesus christ

**lady\_sable** (9): i never would've thought that a song called heroin would be so beautiful and yet here we are

**Leixander** (9): IT'S FUCKING HOT! HOT! LIVING IN THE CITY!

**nickl00** (9): It's amazing, duh

**nooodisaster** (9): At once feels like the ultimate Lana song, while also pushing away from that stereotype. It's a dark drugged-out 6 minute epic on doomed romance, and a self-critique on melancholy and self-destruction. Also: ITS FUCKING HOT, HOT

**skargardin** (9): It progressively gets better and then the heavenly bridge kicks in and it becomes a godly song.

**survivorjdmarina** (9): The production on this track is gorgeous and haunting. If any tracks give me nostalgia feelings to the max, it's definitely this track. The way that Lana delivers the first line of the chorus is extremely beautiful and heavenly.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): god damn it now i really wanna try heroin

**whatareblackhole** (9): In the progression of Lana's storyline as a character, the last three songs on this album are crucial. I was so shocked by the honesty of this one. Truly stunning.

**melodyllic\_** (8.5): remind me to never listen to this song in front of my mother, nothing could convince her that it's a bop

**banananaise** (8): i was afraid the album would suffer from a second-half slump, but this bangs

**dirdbub** (8): giving me "anguish of an upper-class, white, suburban teen with a popular grunge blog on Tumblr who just had their first amicable break-up and wants the world to know how sad they truly are right now" vibes

**dropthehammer11** (8): now this is that good shit

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Queen of heroin! This is in my workout playlist and I love listening to it on the final push.

**InfernalSolstice** (8): a good song but WAY too long

**MrSwearword** (8): a touch taciturn as fuck but not mad at it

**robbiec\_** (8): HOT HOT

**SkyBlade79** (8): dang, that's actually pretty strong. Good lyrics, doesn't drag too much, and she pronounces heroin properly

**technoprayers** (8): , another gorgeous.mp3 track

**Raykel** (7.5): I always forget that bridge oh my god. I'm so serious when listening to this but then "It's hawt! Hawt!" has me dying.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): IT'S FUCKING HOT
 
**I must've taken Nyquil, not Heroin**
--- 

**vayyiqra** (7): we get it Lana you like drugs

**stansymash** (6.9): a fine ol' ditty

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): It's similar to the three preceding songs on the album but this one's not quite doing it for me, not sure why

**theNealCutter** (6): as much as I'd love to appreciate the song, it's just too formulaic.

**VodkaInsipido** (6): could be cut, the second half saves it

**RandomRocketKat** (5): filler filler filler filler padding padding padding padding

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (4): at this point Lana's boredom into the album resonates through me as well

**serried** (4): boring and slow, like i know thats most of her work but this one is too far

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): wow she's annoying

**twat\_brained** (0): I hear artists get criticized for oversinging, but I think Lana is actually UNDERsinging here. I forget why people stan her.

---

--- 

THIS. DESERVED. SO. MUCH. MORE.

It was used in an album trailer and I just up got scalped from those 20 seconds, when I heard the last minute 20 seconds of it parts of my brain were dragged out too. This is a bop and anyone who gave this under a 7 honestly just doesn't have any ears. 

Facts. 

--- 

**THEY BE LIKE**
---

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): now THIS! IS! A! BOP!

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): oh my god this song is the reason why i found dream daddy. I was searching for it on youtube when a fanmade Dream Daddy animation came up about Craig(THE BEST ENDING BECAUSE THEY ARE FRIENDS AND LOVERS FIGHT ME ITS BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN WITH A GOOD ENDING), and I just lost it.

**CarlieScion** (10): Should've been longer so it could've been a singe

**dropthehammer11** (10): this bop sounds like a throwback but lit

**HalfAlienRobot** (10): this is one of the best songs on this album and we all know it needs to be longer. Also the line, "told my new roommate not to let you in, but she so damn good with a bobby pin" idk something about the flow of it, I just love it. UGH, Halsey, extend this and make it a single.

**InfernalSolstice** (10): can this be tripled in length k thanks

**jimmy345960** (10): this needs to be longer, pls halsey

**lady\_sable** (10): a banger!!

**luckyboot** (10): oooh this goes hard

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I want this to be a full song 😩

**MrSwearword** (10): considering the mostly shitshow this album is, I'm calling this a fucking breath of fresh air. Lovely.

**Mudkip1** (10): unironically enjoyed this it's the perfect length for a halsey song

**SkyBlade79** (10): jfc this song is amazing, the production to the lyrics to the tone of her voice… if it wasn't so short, instant 11

**technoprayers** (10): , fuck it up Ashley! Deserved to be a single

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): more of this ashley

**Verdantshade** (10): wow so I hated this song initially but a couple of live videos later, and I've realised it's actually a banger and could really benefit from being a full song

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): Halsey's dramatics are at an all-time high but for the best. Remix with The Weeknd/Bieber/etc please

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (9): should be longer tbh

**chipsi1** (9): okay this was a snap

**dirdbub** (9): why isn't this longer

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Wow, this transition tho. This makes me wish Lie and Walls Could Talk are the same song, considering both of these songs are pretty short.

**followingfreeways** (9): Halsey had no problem making the mess that is called Don't Play 3:31 but made this bop of a song only 1:42. wtf

**Leixander** (9): a good interlude? it is possible y'all.

**melodyllic\_** (9): another fascinating, possibly-boppy song stopped short!!!

**Raykel** (9): A risk! And it paid off!

**serried** (9): id give my eleven to an extended version

**strawberryswing1** (9): the production is really nice here

**theNealCutter** (9): "Two years and we in between" and "We both here since we seventeen," when paired with 100 Letters' lyrics "Now I'm constantly reminded of the time I was 19" clarifies that the guy on Lies is the King. I love Britney Spears' inspiration. Just kinda sad it's too short.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): really love the 90s r&b vibe this has. it gives this album some much needed energy and general decency

**twat\_brained** (8.6): Wow I'm actually wasting my Saturday listening to this instead of doing my assignments I can't believe Halsey's calling me out like this. Musical.ly overplayed this song for me but thankfully it didn't ruin it.

**1998tweety** (8.5): At first I thought this should've been longer but I feel like it would've brought it down. No forget that I want a 3 minute version.

**fourchip** (8.5): i wish it was longer but at the same time the hook gets a little tired and samey? so i think it would lack the replay value. solid song though

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): bess less than 2 minute song on the album

**awryj** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgWDNKIassY

**banananaise** (8): who could have guessed discount sky ferreira had a good song in her

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): This is what Good Mourning should have been. Kinda creepy but in an intriguing way. Great energy too.

**enecks** (8): Yass serve those Britney teas, queen.

**natsby** (8): WHAT IS IT THAT THE 'WOAAH OH OH' BITS SOUND LIKE?? someone with 2000s pop music (i think) knowledge pls help

**nooodisaster** (8): Really fast and cool and then ends

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Finally starting to understand why everybody likes this so much. Halsey may have claimed to be raised on Biggie and Nirvana, but this is the type of music she actually remembers and she does a good job recalling it. I think some people are going to start freaking out over the fact that 00s throwbacks already exist, though.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): why so short tho

**skargardin** (8): A great song cut too short.

**robbiec\_** (7.1): short

**nickl00** (7): I also wish this was longer

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): is this a sample it sounds kinda familiar but i'm too lazy to google it

**specfagular** (7): this sounds so good why is it less than 2 minutes? It'd be an 8 if it were longer. Delete lie for this.

**survivorjdmarina** (7): I honesty wish it was longer. The violins go well with the overall production.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Wow I love NSYNC

**vayyiqra** (7): idk

**Fist-Fighting in /r/popheads**
---

**kappyko** (6.5): I liked this on first listen but something about looking deeper into this song makes me realize it's not THAT good. the chorus is a bit of a disaster

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): if this was just a little better, it could be good enough to be filler in Talk That Talk

**WilsonJason** (6): make longer

**Piccprincess** (5): I didn't know Beyonce actually wrote a song

**stansymash** (5): this is kinda dumb but listenable

**RandomRocketKat** (4.5): Shit is crazy right when people think this is a bop

**Solovrinne** (3): maybe I just fucking hate short songs

**whatareblackhole** (3): WHY ARE THERE THREE INTERLUDES IN A ROW? Good Mourning, Lie, and Walls Could Talk should have been one song, that would've been cool.

This is probably one of my least favorite songs on the album. Something about the first verse and a half just seem *there*. Nothing much to them, they have some fun lyrics, but it feels safe for Annie, especially after Los Ageless and Sugarboy.

---

**whatareblackhole** (11): ~~Oh my god, I wish I could give this my 11, this song is so fucking great. Definitely my fave from this album.~~ Oh my god, this song is so fucking great and perfect. Definitely my fave from this album.

**CarlieScion** (10): This is so sexy omg

**cyborglilith** (10): pleeEaEeeEaaaeeeeaEeaeEEasseeeeeeaEEEe

**enecks** (10): We stan this animal crossing stripper music

**Mudkip1** (10): i love iggy and quavo

**robbiec\_** (10): i love how gay this is. also reminds me of Prince Johnny how the guitar creeps in as the song goes on

**specfagular** (10): this is the best song off this album and that's a FACT

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): y'all know how sometimes you have to experience a song live to really appreciate it? this was one of those

**stansymash** (9.1): Annie will Not have kinky sex with you if you dont show any manners

**melodyllic\_** (9): restrained and funky. this is some 2014 self-titled era goodness

**skargardin** (9): Queen of roleplaying, this song is both sexy and then it turns thought-provoking with the outro.

**technoprayers** (9): , an underrated track in my opinion

**theNealCutter** (9): this is an interesting take on Idolitry and stan culture. Fans put up their idols waaaay to high in the pedestal. LIKE GURL, THEY'RE HUMAN TOO.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): that melody in the hook cleared my depression, cured my skin, etc.

**1998tweety** (8.7): There are some really cool things being done with the vocals on this track. I was a bit lukewarm on this track and then the Refrain came around and I was sold. We have another long spoken word outro on this track, but I feel like this one fits a bit better. It flows really well into the next song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): It sounds almost like a regular pop rock track, but I'd be damned if it isn't a catchy one. I've always been interested in the religious imagery where St Vincent uses, and after hearing the songs on this album that do I'm pretty sure she uses symbolism for more profound reasons than simple shock value.

**mokitsu** (8): I love the buildup of this song. Production is excellent as always.

**RandomRocketKat** (8): we LOVE a dominatrix at the mental institution

**survivorjdmarina** (8): I like how lowkey this is compared to most of the tracks here. It compliments well.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Not one of the more memorable tracks on the album, but it's really solid.

**vayyiqra** (8): okay this is giving me a weird boner and that makes me uncomfortable

**Verdantshade** (8): points for being kinky

**VodkaInsipido** (8): i love iggy azalea

**OriginalKappa** (7.5): makes me uncomfortable

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7): bop

deleted: Hey guys, I know Halsey's rankings aren't doing great, but her scores are actually really good individually, her issue isn't people doing her dirty, it's how much people like the other songs in the rate. 

Walls Could Talk with a 7.5 would've been 15th in the Ultimate 2017 rate. That is really good, especially for an album cut. 

Further research, Walls Could Talk's score would've put it at 14th in the Tumblrcore rate, higher than every other Halsey song we've ever rated except Roman Holiday and Colors. 

I know it's disappointing, but remember a ranking out of a select group doesn't dictate how much we actually like the song.

jimmy345960: This is actually very interesting. I will say for me specifically both Lust for Life and Hopeless gave me a new outlook on both their respective artists. I like them a lot more especially because of Alone and God Bless America. 

I don't know about anyone else but I definitely going to check out Halsey and Lana's back catalog! :)

**Number3rdInTheVoting (10): The high note… coming for Mariah's gig.**
--- 

MY FUCKING 11 DID NOT GO FOR PEOPLE TO SAY THIS IS A MEH SONG OR TOO REPETITIVE. 

This is perfect St. Vincent. Loud, guitar laden, rash, and to the point. The bridge did not come to play, and scalped me harder than anything in this entire rate. I hope you are happy that you made your rate host sad :( 

--- 

**Good Taste** 
--- 

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): serving kate bush realness, wig gone

**cyborglilith** (10): her voice is HYSTERICAL on this track

**didney-worl** (10): we love a sad banger

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): bitch my wig went flying when she hit that high note. 👏 Annie 👏 did 👏 not 👏 come 👏 to 👏 play 👏

**MrSwearword** (10): THERE'S bombastic weird St. Vincent again.

**technoprayers** (10): , one of the more upbeat tracks that I enjoy.

**Tedyonce** (10): Second fave on this LP. The note she hits at the end is fucking crazy

**1998tweety** (9.8): Wow the interlude into that last chorus. This is the best her vocals have sounded on the entire album, especially the high note. That high note takes me THERE! I love how the lyrics on this track tell a story again, something that's become common on this album. The long repetitive outro doesn't feel boring on this track either, its a mix of the song only clocking in at 3 and a half minutes, as well as us needing some time to get off of the high the high note set us on.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): mariah is shook

**kappyko** (9.5): woah

**Raykel** (9.5): That high note has so emotion. Sometimes I play just that part for awhile.

**skargardin** (9.5): Damn, this is heavy and once again such a masterful outro.

**twat\_brained** (9.3): Girlie's coming in with that high note thinking she's Ariana or something. It actually works pretty well in the context of the song, though. I can see this one sneaking in on day 3.

**m4ttycool** (9): loving this

**melodyllic\_** (9): probably the most 'pop' song on this album, which plays even closer to my tastes tbh. the falsetto/screaming thing at the end is weird, over-the-top and very st vincent

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This is probably the scariest and most visceral track on the record - the lyrics are just insane.

**theNealCutter** (9): I'm living for the outro omg.

**dirdbub** (8.5): I knew every song in this concert and the people right next to me were staring at me for knowing every single song at this point

**stansymash** (8.5): cara delevigne did not die

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): I'm an absolute sucker for a pitch change, and that high note at the end is YUM

**enecks** (8): I love how guitar heavy this album is.

**fourchip** (8): serving messy vocals but good song?

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Another track where I see some influence from older rock and pop musicians like Prince, this is a welcome closer to the more upbeat songs on this album.

**survivorjdmarina** (8): wow this song is meta

**vayyiqra** (8): good but not a standout track to me idk

**whatareblackhole** (8): Queen of dark lyrics! The vocals in this are so stunning, I questioned if Annie sang this whole album herself. She's got the range, gals.

**nickl00** (7): The albums starting to pick up

**RandomRocketKat** (7): that range in voice we love

**robbiec\_** (7): took me a while to grow to this song but to me it's in some cannon with Lorde's young lover songs like Supercut

**Solovrinne** (7): charlie's impact

**Verdantshade** (7): I honestly think the song is really weak but the bridge saves it - it's one of the highest points of the album

**The Rest of these can go :shrug:**
--- 

**mokitsu** (7): It's a good song, but I can definitely sense a drop in quality from the previous songs.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): hmmmm not great but not bad

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Good verses. Not so good chorus.

**specfagular** (6): not bad. Not good. But I mean I wouldn't mind if I couldn't skip it

**nooodisaster** (5.5): Damn, she called out Cara like that???! I don't know what to feel. (also glam rock is rly not my genre lmao)

**CarlieScion** (5): Kinda forgettable

**followingfreeways** (5): it sounds like she is saying "your mother" every time she says "your lover"

**Mudkip1** (5): song's not bad but i always skip it

**natsby** (5): I like the bridge but find the rest really unpleasant, especially with the costant key changes (I think that's what they are??)

**SkyBlade79** (3): this is horrible, so repetitive
