#Introductions
---

[Welcome to the 2017 Alt-Pop Rate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jWUriOpcJg) /u/piccprincess and I are so excited to introduce and rate four of the most interesting and [experimental](https://imgur.com/a/4BNu1) albums of 2017 in the modern pop scene. These albums range from a psychiatric display of emotions, from anger to sadness, within *Melodrama*, or a violent and sexual Romeo & Juliet inspired *Hopeless Fountain Kingdom*. These albums all hold special places in several users’ hearts, and based on the results we have received so far, (12 as of this post), all of these albums have the potential of making /r/popheads history. 

Now, with this small cheesy introduction out of the way, let’s meet our contestants!

#Lana Del Rey - Lust For Life

Two years after her 2015 album *Honeymoon*, Lana Del Rey returned to the scene serving witchcraft, happiness, and a needed positive vibe after the intense and depressing political scene we experienced the year before. *Lust for Life* was lead by ‘Love’, a hopeful, retrospective and accepting song, and in stark contrast compared to the rest of Rey’s discography. ‘Love’, like the rest of the album, is written and produced by Del Rey, with the assistance of other writers and producers, like Benny Blanco, Max Martin, Metro Boomin, and many more. 

Lust for Life, like 3 of the other albums in this rate, debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 Albums Chart, in a time where women were truly underappreciated on both charts. In 2017, a woman reigned on top of the Billboard 200 for 10 weeks, 3 of those weeks came from *Reputation*’s reign, and the other 7 coming from solo weeks on the top, including Lorde, Halsey, and Lana Del Rey, her second time topping that chart. 

Featuring artists like The Weeknd, A$AP Rocky, Playboi Carti, Sean Ono Lennon, and Stevie Nicks, *Lust for Life* borrows and molds several sounds into a clean and smooth album, a soothing and melodramatic ride audibly, and a thoroughly worthwhile journey from beginning to end.

#Halsey - Hopeless Fountain Kingdom

The only album in this rate to truly breach stan-Twitter levels of “flopping”, *Hopeless Fountain Kingdom* was the first number 1 album of 2017 headed by a woman, and produced two top 20 hits, one of which scraping the top 5. With high profile interviews and coverage from her LGBT influenced lyrics, controversial opinions, and mainstream-pop-sounding-yet-alternative music, Halsey doesn’t avoid the drama of a pop star despite being such an outspoken alternative musician. 

Despite being the least acclaimed album of the group, Halsey was able to mix influences of Romeo & Juliet (despite the claims of being a failed concept album, untrue #fakenews), experimental production, and finding a way to mix Quavo into an alternative album, *Hopeless Fountain Kingdom* is a journey, a modern, new, and fresh sound.

#St. Vincent - MASSEDUCTION/ASSEDUCTION/MASSEDUCATION/MASSEDUCKTON

A twist and change from the unexpected, Annie Clark (St. Vincent), returns with a new LP, *MASSEDUCTION* in 2017. The album, like all her others before, takes her to a new and exciting place lyrically and sonically. Partnered with Jack Antonoff, akin to Lorde, *MASSEDUCTION* takes Annie to a more pop sound, but never quite makes it all the way there. She is interrupted with jarring breaks in production for her signature guitar, or lyrically spins the song to a new place in a split second. 

*MASSEDUCTION* proved to be her most successful commercial work, debuting at #10 on the Billboard top 200 chart, her highest charting work to date. The album, like her albums before her, received great critical acclaim, being one of the best received albums of the year. Leading the album was her single ‘New York’, a piano ballad explicitly recounting her lost love, and then followed by ‘Los Ageless’, another love lorn song, but this time accompanied by more visible Jack Antonoff touches. 

We will be rating the 13 tracks on the standard edition of the album, including ‘Dancing with a Ghost’. You can find the songs below:

###RULES

I'm legit just stealing this from everyone else, and if you break any of these rules I will permaban you from the sub.

- Listen to **each song** and assign each a score between **1 and 10**. Decimals are fine (please make sure they are decimal, not comma), but please don't give scores that have two or decimal spots: giving a **6.2 is okay, but a 6.21 isn't**. /u/letsallpoo has created this program, this is the way it is. If you don't put a score in, you break the program, and you ruin everything for everyone. Words to think about.

- Feel free to talk about your scores, we don't mind!

- You may give **ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11.** Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; **excessive sabotage ruins rate results**. 

- It's not required to use these! Please don't give out 0's and 11's just because!

- You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again afterwards.

- To make things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on my part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. **The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to use the pre-prepared link that I have put all over this post**, such as right [here](http://bit.ly/2o3b8OD). PLEASE USE THAT. You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores.

- If you don't follow the format, I'll still accept your ballot, but **I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions.**

- If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. **Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!**

- **If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!**

- **I can't believe I even have to say this but don't change the submission ballot it just messes everything up** 

- If, after submitting your scores, you change your mind about a certain song please feel free to message me about changing scores and I will be happy to oblige

**This is the ONE AND ONLY correct format:**
>piccprincess: 11 Red deserved a grammy!

**These are INCORRECT, in fact, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:**

>tubbs: 11:  is literally a gift from heaven

>tubbs: is literally a gift from heaven11

>buckets: I'm giving a 1 because he's trash, unlike tubbs

>tubbs: 11-literally a gift from heaven

>tubbs: 11 (tubbs for president!)
