7) Homemade Dynamite

**twat\_brained (8.2): :emofish: Equal parts beautiful and heartbreaking**

I mentioned before on the Popheads discord that this song really surprised me. 

When I said that, this song was number 7 in the rate.

The song is slow, sad, and I am genuinely surprised it made it day 3 like this. 

--- 

**HAAAAPPY BIRTHDAY :)**
--- 

**1998tweety** (10): It's weird to see St. Vincent without her signature guitars, but I still like this song. It's a ballad, but her vocals are probably my favourite here, especially because she knows her limitations. The lyrics can easily be heard on this track, which I thing is good because I really like Annie's lyrics; they're poetic. The one I really like about this track is that its short and sweet, just like how I feel a letter to Johnny would be. There's no long outro, and I really like that the chorus doesn't repeat itself.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): so prettyyyy

**banananaise** (10): beautiful! stunning! incredible! a masterpiece! i forgot this meme format

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): wig

**cyborglilith** (10): Johnny seems pretty cool

**dirdbub** (10): when she said "I hope you find peace" in concert the entire room got chills

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Beautiful and heartbreaking all at once.

**fourchip** (10): yes i just finished crying to this, and what about it

**gannade** (10): heartbreaking

**InfernalSolstice** (10): why is this rate making me so emo

**jimmy345960** (10): this song gave me a lot of feelings. I put this, Liability and New Year's Day in the same category of "sad sounding bops"

**m4ttycool** (10): Happy Birthday, my friend

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this makes me feel so sad. The "Annie how could you do this to me?" Line is just pure, raw eomootion.

**MrSwearword** (10): tasteful ballads are hard to come by and St. Vincent gets it right.

**Mudkip1** (10): literally the best run in any album ever and its 6 songs long like whew what a ride i love annie

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): A stunning and heartbreaking track. Johnny is low key my favorite thing about Annie's discography.

**Raykel** (10): I know she doesn't talk about who Johnny is or what he means to her but omg can she at least tell us if he's ok? Please someone save him.

**technoprayers** (10): , a highlight on the album, so lush and pretty to me

**Tedyonce** (10): How can you not cry to this song. Heart destroying lyrics ugh

**theNealCutter** (10): it's a gorgeous song. I can't really say anything. The storytelling is topnotch, the production is amazing. There's the sad effect of fame and living a completely new life, that under the prestige and distance from other people, comes with disbelief of authenticity from people you try to be close to.

**whatareblackhole** (10): Wow, wanna hate yourself quick? Take a quick 3 minute spin with Happy Birthday, Johnny!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): of course i blame me

**mokitsu** (9.5): It's just a simple piano ballad but it's really affecting. I can definitely sense her emotions through her vocals.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): I'm a sucker for ballads sue me

**rotating3Dtext** (9.2): this makes me emotional and i don't even know these people

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (9): Really sweet, a nice break from the aggressive production.

**enecks** (9): This song is seriously depressing. I can't finish it tbh, so no 10

**natsby** (9): this could be in a jonathan larson musical, which is to say I like it a lot. st vincent the musical??

**OriginalKappa** (9): I like it but find it kind of musically stranded in this album - not to be that guy that 'improves art' but I think it would feel better at the last bit of the album when it becomes slower and more vulnerable

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Definitely the most heartbreaking episode in St Vincent's Johnny saga. The pain here is so raw and fresh despite the fairly downtempo composition, and it leaves you hoping for Annie's sake that Johnny is just a metaphor or something and not a real person she knows. Because if it's the latter...ouch.

**skargardin** (9): "Annie, how could you do this to me" is one of my favourite moments on the album.

**specfagular** (9): beautiful and tragic

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I love the different Johnny songs in all the St. Vincent albums, and this one may be one of the best. It's super emotional and the lyrics are just so powerful. This song is also really heartbreaking live, she kills it.

**VodkaInsipido** (9): my birthday is April 4th hopefully this rate happens after that

**awryj** (8.8): Johnny song = good song

**stansymash** (8.7): i agree, happy birthday to johnny

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Aw damn, this is really sad. :(

**kappyko** (8.5): :(

**nooodisaster** (8.5): damn, this song is too sad, im watching spongebob.

**RandomRocketKat** (8.5): wherever you are... :genericsad:

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): ok but this ballad makes me emotional over the "Johnny" I never had

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Pretty brutal. I can feel the hurt in St. Vincent's voice on here.

**melodyllic\_** (8): stop pulling on my heart strings!! made me cry at 1am

**Verdantshade** (8): the beautiful ending to the story of marry me. it's outshined as a ballad by marry me, but it's still very beautiful and imo much better than prince johnny

**These People Don't Feel Sadness Confirmed**
---

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): A tad overrated tbh, it takes a long time to build to the climax. I get why this is so loved by the Annie stans though.

**vayyiqra** (6): weird song

**Solovrinne** (5.9): it's sweet, i guess

**robbiec\_** (5): when Marry Me and Prince Johnny are some of her best songs this Johnny installment feels a bit flat

**SkyBlade79** (5): it's really sad, even though it's boring as al hell

**nickl00** (4): Boring

**amumumyspiritanimal** (3): imo the lowest point of the album

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): today is my birthday while i'm listening to it except my names not johnny. anyway this sucks

**MASSEDUCTION**
--- 

**kappyko** (11): omg

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): I CAN'T TURN OFF WHAT TURNS ME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! absolutely murdered me with the guitar solo at the end at her show

**cyborglilith** (10): Quirky production is quirky. Also, I CAN'T TURN OFF WHAT TURNS ME ON

**m4ttycool** (10): a s s d e s t r u c t i o n

**melodyllic\_** (10): this was my second choice for 11 haha. masseduction is like melodrama's fierce older sister, who's gone through the same shit at 20 and is stronger than ever. giving me real unmarried dominatrix CEO vibes

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the guitars are orgasmic oh my my my

**MrSwearword** (10): yes GAWD I love a tastefully robotic chorus

**Mudkip1** (10): POWER CORRUPTS

**shineflyer** (10): featuring Annie's crazy head voice

**specfagular** (10): this bops off the fucking walls

**stansymash** (10): i feel massively seducted

**survivorjdmarina** (10): I cAn'T tUrN oFF wHAt tUrNS mE oN

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Literally a fucking bop, and it's the title of the album too omg

**twat\_brained** (10): +1 for the Marlboro shoutout. I'm an F1 fan so I feel that. No wait, I just remembered "A-YO". If you still can't turn off what turns you on, I'd recommend r/pornfree before things get out of hand. If "Lust For Life" wasn't in this rate, this'd be my favorite title track.

**Verdantshade** (10): I CAN'T TURN OFF wHAT TURNS ME ON

**MASS-SEDUCTION**
---

**OriginalKappa** (9.5): thot anthem

**CarlieScion** (9): Idk this kinda turned me on??

**enecks** (9): B O P

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): This is, funnily enough, the song that stuck with me the most after listening to this album for the first time. I liked the rock-influenced songs on her previous record more than the ones that weren't, so that's not much of a surprise in hindsight. It honestly reminds me of Prince-it's so refined, yet so dirty.

**RandomRocketKat** (9): Annie likes vore

**Raykel** (9): I hear a little of her self titled sound here. It mixes both albums really well. It's pop but has that crazy sporadic feeling.

**theNealCutter** (9): I like how sultry the production and vocal performance is. It's a song deconstructing the ins and outs of fame. It's boring, but also addictive. It's glamorous, but also painful to deal with. Honestly, I think this captures the entire essence of Taylor Swift's reputation more with just a single song.

**vayyiqra** (9): this bops

**whatareblackhole** (9): I love all the stupid lyrics in this bop, I love the guitar riffs and screams and everything.

**dirdbub** (8.5): one time I misread the title as "massincarceration" and I'm still not sure how that happened

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): "I can't turn off what turns me on" is too relatable. I have too many daddies that I thrist on.

**followingfreeways** (8.5): this sounds like it should be in a gossip girl episode but in a good way?

**skargardin** (8.5): Yep, I still read it as mass education. Queen of illusions.

**awryj** (8): I like to hear Annie Clark moan and I don't turn off what turns me on

**banananaise** (8): my favourite part is when it goes 'mass seduction (bweew bweew bweew bweew)'

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Great guitar work and the best chorus of the first three songs

**natsby** (8): to be honest, I initially thought this was 'masseducation' and was very confused at the lyrics. anyway, this reminds me of the weird shit idina menzel put out in her debut album in a good way. LOLITA IS WEEPIN'

**Solovrinne** (8): don't turn off what turns me on

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): heck yes

**ASSEDUCATION**
---

**1998tweety** (7.6): The song did not start off on the best note with whatever that random background yelling was. There are so many small things I love in this track though: the guitars as always, the weird moaning like sound, the talking in the last chorus.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): I like the theme of sexual liberation, and the kinda creepy way she does it.

**ulikejazz** (7.5): The instrumentation <33 But the whole "I can't turn off what turns me on"-line just does nothing for me

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7): ,5 masseducation sounds like supermassive black hole

**dropthehammer11** (7): mass so fat need a lap dance

**fourchip** (7): was this supposed to turn me on? It failed miserably

**mokitsu** (7): More enjoyable than the previous songs but I still feel like there's something off.

**nickl00** (7): I'm really liking this production

**SkyBlade79** (7): oh, so it's NOT mass education

**technoprayers** (7): , Static and bouncy title track

**WilsonJason** (4): no

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3.5): this is too weird for me sorry this is like tove lo but not good

Hm…

**natsby** (11): hot take: this is the real spiritual predecessor to all too well. hear me out - like all too well, this song conveys in excruciating detail the strands of a love gone wrong. the lyrics interweave specific, concrete detail with metaphor and universality so well, and 'three years loved you every single day made me weak it was real for me yeah real for me' feels like an alternate universe version of 'time won't fly, it's like i'm paralysed by it/i'd like to be my old self again, but i'm still tryin' to find it'. ATW comparisons aside, the unrestrained industrial screeching that pops up is, somehow, the most satisfying musical moment in the entire recording, despite how objectively unpleasant it is. AND all this isn't even getting onto loveless. Loveless is amazing, and yes, could have been its own song, but I believe so much that it works better as a short reflection of hard feelings - I feel like it's simultaneously the subconscious of the song, but also its parody within a wider, jaded societal context. basically this song is amazing and I will take it as a personal offence if anyone gives it a 0. (note: I was going to give summer bummer my 11 but after writing this up I feel like I can't oops) 

--- 

**L O V E GENERATION**
---

**Raykel** (11): Everything is perfect here. Hard Feelings gets my attention with "go back and tell it" then halts me with "please could be tender..." and the rest is a ride until it becomes a rollercoaster in that instrumental part with all those portal and gate sounds. Then it closes with this beautiful verse and right when you think it's over BAM Loveless slaps you with an 18-wheeler. It's just that THIS IS MY FAVORITE TAPE!

**rotating3Dtext** (11): i struggle not to cry when i listen to it. i love the restrained emotion in her voice, and the images/scenes she brings up.

**specfagular** (11): God I wish Loveless was a full song on its own

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): i recently added this song to my main playlist because im kind of at this part in my life. such an amazing song. also, there is that one youtube vid with Hard Feelings edited over The End Of The Fucking World and it's everything.

**didney-worl** (10): a masterpiece

**enecks** (10): In this track, Lorde embraces the weirder uncanny side of pop that lurks below the surface, while making the best damn homage to In The Air Tonight.

**followingfreeways** (10): hard feelings should have had it's own full-length track

**fourchip** (10): this is my favourite tape

**HalfAlienRobot** (10): yeah okay I know i've been giving out too many 10s but have you EVER heard anything like this. what IS this tape, THIS IS MY FAVOURITE TAPE.

**kappyko** (10): both parts of this are flawless fuck off. this is my favorite tape DUHDUHDUDHDUHDUDHDUHDUDHDUDHD

**m4ttycool** (10): this is so good ugh

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I have a feeling that "Hard Feelings" could have been a better lead single as it could have helped the GP to warmup to the pop sound that Lorde was going for Melodrama. I also wish "Loveless" was a separate song as it's definitely interesting what this song could have been.

**Mudkip1** (10): the metallic scratching weird ass experimental noises in this song are EVERYTHING i live for this and loveless is such a bop too. just wish it was its own song

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): My favorite tape

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Only our Lorde and saviour could somehow manage to give us 1 and a half masterpieces in one song. (but for real though, I wish they were separated, it's kind of annoying because the songs are so different tonally and I don't always wanna listen to them together)

**stansymash** (10): you know the bit with the squeaky sounds. GOD do i love the bit with the squeaky sounds

**swadadu** (10): This song is so great because of how it goes through the entire break up so quickly and so vividly. If Melodrama was an essay, this song would be the thesis statement. The instrumental section is the ultimate mood and the last verse before Loveless might be the most painful moment on the album.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7ku2bx3HhM

**theburningundead** (10): I love the juxtaposition of the two parts to this song, and I can also relate to it because that is definitely what I would sound like playing the flute

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Hard Feelings (10); Loveless (10); Average (10)

**Verdantshade** (10): this song fully deserves my 11. it's a masterpiece. it just so happens it's on an album full of masterpieces. this was the only song on melodrama that took me a while to 'get'. initially I couldn't stand the song - it was a mix of dolphin noises that faded into a trap beat. come the end of last year, I finally understood the song for its explosion of heartbreak. hard feelings is as crushing as liability, and the transition of "this is my favourite tape" is my favourite moment on melodrama

**whatareblackhole** (10): This is my favorite song on the album. Hard Feelings has some of her best lyrics to date and Loveless is the perfect amount of tongue-in-cheek that I expect from Lorde's brilliant mind.

deleted: **nooodisaster** (9.9): "Please could you be tender? And I will sit close to you." If Loveless wasn't attached, this might've gotten my 11. Parts of this song feel so sad, it's unfair. "Three years, loved you every single day", "I remember the rush, when forever was us", "God I wish I believed you when you told me this was my home." There's too many to list, but all paint a picture of Ella loving so strongly that when that love dies, the world ending seems easier than getting over it. In concert, she talks about the moment when you've broken up, you've both decided it, but you're still in the room or car. And you have to leave that room eventually, but there's a time, right there, where you can pretend one last time it's not over. The infamous chair-dragging bridge is wordless, but portrays that screeching pain perfectly. It seems impossible to get over him. But she's starting to, and witnessing that is fucking heartbreaking y'all. Oh yeah and Loveless is okay too I guess. Fav line: "When you've outgrown a lover/The whole world knows but you."

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): needs an extended version with more of the distorted part

**InfernalSolstice** (9.5): !demand loveless to be separated and extended

**Leixander** (9.5): an experimental bop, i must say I love Loveless more and wish it was a separate song

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (9): My favorite lyrics on the entire thing show up here, at the end of Hard Feelings.

**cucumberanti** (9): Those rusty gate sound effects is a pretty accurate representation of how I feel listening to Liability and Hard Feelings back to back.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): What are these hard feelings? These are my favorite hard feelings.

**melodyllic\_** (9): another excursion into the expansive depths of synth. the weird atonal metal screeching is a choice, but I warmed up to it eventually

**RandomRocketKat** (9): Loveless is such a ugh i cant i love it

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Hard feelings would have been my 11 if it was by itself. It's so raw with experimental noise that pays off emotionally. However, Loveless is probably an 8 by itself. I feel like the album would be better served if the two tracks were split and loveless was fleshed out a bit more.

**theNealCutter** (9): it's a straightforward song. We are over and I'm still bitter but that's okay, I'm gonna get over you. I know that. I love the industrial pop influences in the bridge. It certainly makes the song more memorable. I'm also in love with the weird switch of "hopeful moving on" of Hard Feelings to the "I'm gonna be thorn on your side" feeling of Loveless. Because honestly, it's a mess to be in a breakup. One day you're okay for him living his own life, the next you're like "Yeah fuck all men."

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): What a glorious set of tracks! Hard Feelings reminds me of a Homogenic-era Bjork with the big beats in the introduction, and again at the end of the first half with the electronic tempo. Loveless is a nice chant, preaching towards millenials being a "loveless" generation.

**cyborglilith** (8): WELL GUESS WHAT I LIKE THAT

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I wish Loveless was a seperate track tbh.

**Marshynarsh** (8): two really good songs I love the industrial production that's featured on hard feelings and her experimenting with vocals on loveless, I only wish that loveless was longer

**nickl00** (8): HF is good, but Loveless makes the song great

**ScottishWhore** (8): would be better as two different tracks

**Solovrinne** (7.9): I like it, but I think it is too long. You never think a song is too long until it starts to lose your attention

**twat\_brained** (7.9): HF's instrumental takes away from the song for me but "Loveless" makes up for it. Not necessarily in droves, but it does well to aid its score.


**This Part is Good, This Part is Bad, etc.**

**CarlieScion** (7): Hard Feelings issa 10, but Loveless drags it down

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Hard Feelings by itself is an absolutely song that deserves at least an 8, and Loveless is a cute second half, but I'm conflicted about the production on both of the songs. Sometimes they sound good to me and other times they sound very abrasive.

**skargardin** (7): The best part about this two-part song is undoubtedly the production. The transition makes it feel like her world is just falling apart from the breakup, it's so perfect.

**technoprayers** (7): , Its good but it's just there

**vayyiqra** (7): this is not my favourite take

**robbiec\_** (6.8): Loveless is cute but I don't see the point of it being slapped on at the end. At this point in the album it starts to feel needlessly fragmented with this and the interludes/reprises and he pointlessly long outros to most songs, especially after the absolutely stellar run from GL to Liability

**awryj** (6.5): Loveless > Hard Feelings tbh

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): i wish these were separate :emofish:

**banananaise** (6): legit forgot this existed

**shineflyer** (5.5): I really want to make a rap verse over Loveless.
**No Love For This Song**
---

**Elitefourbrad** (5): Loveless deserved her own song, Hard Feelings is meh.

**gannade** (5): The Hard feelings part is a 10 and then loveless is a 0.

**SkyBlade79** (5): hard feelings sucks but loveless is great. Why are they one song? No one knows

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): I like the first half of this song, but the second just has never gotten better and while I appreciate the effort to do something different, it was just an experiment that didn't work for me.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): this is too mellow but loveless is the better song here

**MrSwearword** (2): Hard Feelings is slightly better but Loveless can go fuck itself

**therokinrolla** (0): Assay time. I rarely give 0s, and to give it to a Melodrama track I feel like I absolutely must explain myself. This track is a fucking mess. Hard Feelings is not very good, a slow-brewing track that doesn't build up to much. It is also very demo-y, and it feels incomplete. Not too offensive, and not what give this my 0. However, Lorde, dis not what you gon' do. You don't take a 4 of a track and combine it with a -100 of a track. L.O.V.E.L.E.S.S. is yet another half of a track. Actually its more of a quarter of a track because the song fades out during the second chorus. What results is a 6 minute chore of a song to get through. The middle part of the song, the "transition" between the two halves, sounds like Lorde was moving around furniture in the studio. Awful and hurts my ears. LOVELESS is a screeching, crashing, tumbling mess of a song. I think Lorde attempted to create the least catchy pop song of all time with LOVELESS. Thank God LOVELESS is barely a passing moment. A mess. A 0. Please don't hold it against me(which I hope you gave 10s in the other rate this month)

**WilsonJason (7): Drink seltzer, smoke weed. When you can't sleep. Think about shooting birds. Everyone has got a violent streak.**
--- 

--- 

One one hand, this song is amazing, this deserved better, but then I realize what else has died for this to make it this far, and honestly, it deserved to go out a bit earlier. 

--- 

**I BEEN DRINKING, WATERMELON**
--- 

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): yes.

**cyborglilith** (10): This is the song that defines the album. First of all, it's titled Melodrama, but aside from that, Lorde's lyricism represents the general mood of the album. I didn't think I would hear her singing with a trap beat AND mournful strings, but this album is full of production much different from the minimalist/dreamy production of Pure Heroine. I love the gunshots that happen before she says "and the terror, and the horror" and the muffled screaming/wailing (not sure how they did that; I don't know what else to call it).

**enecks** (10): TRAP POP DONE WELL? NANI?

**gannade** (10): Now this is melodrama. The strings, the dramatics, her swagger. I wish she had just titled this Melodrama instead of Sober 2. Now its gonna go out early because anything named "part 2" isnt as good in popheads eyes.

**InfernalSolstice** (10): love the drop

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): tRaP lOrDe Is ThE bEsT lOrDe

**nickl00** (10): oh man this is good

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Invented trap

**serried** (10): not even sure what instrument is playing at the start but i m HERE for it

**skargardin** (10): Has there ever been any song that captures that blue feeling after the party's over better than this song? I love it so much.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): As the title track, I really think this serves as an apt thesis for the concept of this album. Also, the beat on the back half of the song is lowkey one of the hardest beats of 2017.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): when I said Good Mourning was the best interlude of 2017 I was right because this is not a interlude this is a whole song

**stansymash** (9.7): i get really intense 'oh my god she's so talented' vibes from this song. anyone else feel that? am i totally off base here?

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): it has kind of a "cinematic" feel

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): hey look finally a good dramatic interlude in this rate

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (9): new year's day long lost cousin

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): That random hip-hop beat is so fucking cool.

**melodyllic\_** (9): born to die who? strings and hip hop beats galore

**natsby** (9): the fittingly quiet climax of the album. all the eclectic instrumentation works so well together.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Definitely one of the more memorable intros I've ever came across, and its impressive that it managed to produce some of the most quotable lines from the album. I loved the snarling section in Sober, so I'm really glad she expanded it here.

**SkyBlade79** (9): that hip hop beat with the violins is actually heavenly. She should've got travis scott to feature on this??? I'm shaking just thinking of that possibility

**survivorjdmarina** (9): Aaaaaaah. A great sequel to one of the greatest ballads of the whole record. The tempo change in the latter half changed me for the best, honestly.

**twat\_brained** (9): Surprisingly good for what feels like an interlude.

**vayyiqra** (9): the fucking melodrama

**Verdantshade** (9): queen of using 2 minute tracks to define an album. this is the comedown - a brilliant sarcastic comment on the life of young adults

**I Been Drinking, Seltzer water**
---

**dirdbub** (8.5): the trap section is white but good anyways

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): it's sweet and cute and better than anything on Halsey's album

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (8): That beat drop.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I wasn't expecting all these piano ballads on such a previously synth-heavy artist. This is not a bad thing whatsoever.

**dropthehammer11** (8): i love TRAP MUSIC (jk this isnt trap like at all)

**nooodisaster** (8): Another glorified interlude, but it's a HOT one. Fav line: "You asked if I was feeling it, I'm psycho high"

**RandomHypnotica** (8): This is my least favourite track on Melodrama, just cause I find it kind of repetitive, and I'm not too big on the trap beat.

**technoprayers** (8): , I like the trap beats that were added to the song

**theNealCutter** (8): probably my least favorite song of Melodrama. It's not bad, it just doesn't shine as much as the other songs. I love how aware she is in this song. She knows all of this pain comes with the breakup. That she she's expecting this. That her stories will be told, there will be different sides, and that all in all, it's over and there's nothing she can do. The weird and unexpected progression of the song from a soul inspired song then to a trap beat makes the song more interesting with repeated listens.

**whatareblackhole** (8): OOF, that breakdown though! I love this bitch.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51KbL2i8QYY

**RandomRocketKat** (6.5): the trap holds this back a bit imo

**robbiec\_** (6): mission statement

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): we told you this was mediocre

**MrSwearword** (5): is she using "melodrama" in the way youth culture uses "irony" without having an iota as to what it actually means against Sober's beat? She is; generous scoring for truth in advertising

**Solovrinne** (5): Doesn't appeal to me very much, though I honestly couldn't put my finger on as to why.

**Elitefourbrad** (4): Lorde and trap don't really go together all that well.

**kappyko** (4): ok i actually kinda didnt like this which was a surprise

I'm so sorry. 

The point difference between this and number 10 is huge. .2 average, 23 points total. 

What's sad is that this song was at one point on the edge of going out day 1. It dropped into the 30s halfway through the rate, and had to climb back up here. Halsey was a for sure day 2 exiter until the last week of scoring. 

I know there is going to be a lot of anger because of this, but know that this would've been second place in the ultimate album rate. 

Sorry again.

**I'm gay for good music like this**
---

**CarlieScion** (11): A BISEXUAL ANTHEM

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): When this song dropped, I was super emotional. I never heard a synthpop song with mainstream appeal to have a song about two female lovers falling apart. We are on our way to normalize LGBT realationships with this song. This is also the song where I fell in love with Lauren's voice and makes me a fan. I really hope Halsey releases this as a main single and give it a music video.

**dropthehammer11** (11): one of the best pop songs i've legit ever heard. perfect production, perfect lyrics, perfect chorus, this song is perfect. no flaws detected.

**lady\_sable** (11): so the reason why this is my 11 (as opposed to something from an album that i gave a higher score) is bc this song is so important to me personally. as a bi girl myself, i honestly can't describe how it feels having a song where two openly bisexual women sing about loving women. also it's a fucking bop.

**PuggleMaster** (11): wig

**rickikardashian** (11): I WONT REST EASY UNTIL THIS IS A SINGLE AND HITS NUMBER 1

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): saved the gays

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): gay anthem of 2017

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): bisexual anthem

**chipsi1** (10): her best song!

**cyborglilith** (10): fits right on MASSEDUCTION with the nutty production

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Biseuxals and lesbians truly won.

**enecks** (10): MY WIG ENTERED THE GOD DAMN COSMOS WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS BEAUTIFUL BOP. IT IS UNASHAMED TO BE BI. IT IS SYNTHPOP MAJESTY. SLAY QUEEN YASS. HALSEY NEW MAIN POP GIRL. LAUREN THE ONLY GOOD MEMBER OF FIFTH HARMONY.

**fourchip** (10): this is THAT same sex pronoun bop

**gannade** (10): Lauren slayed this

**InfernalSolstice** (10): kinda overrated but still a 10

**kappyko** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okCBsnVBXao

**m4ttycool** (10): best song here (almost)

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): release the music video fats this is guaranteed to smash

**nickl00** (10): no explanation needed

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): My only 11 contender on this album, though I'm probably not going to give it that honour. This sounds quite simplistic at first, but the melody eventually grows on you, in no part thanks to Lauren's voice-which is pretty damaged by now, unfortunately, though her raspiness gives her performance a unique quality. Enjoying the fact that a lesbian song can be included in a popular album now is just so, so refreshing, and if Halsey dropped off the face of the earth right now I'm honestly pretty sure this is the song she'll be remembered for.

**serried** (10): i made a dance routine to this song its really gay

**skargardin** (10): What's there to say that hasn't already been said about this godly bisexual anthem?

**specfagular** (10): this bops to the top. If this isn't the highest Halsey song I'm unstanning popheads.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): but we need the audience to RELEASE the video

**theNealCutter** (10): So she misses her girl lover. Wait, they're not lovers. But girl, just be honest, ask her one more time. Based on what I've heard from this song, it seems like she loves you too. GIRL TIME TO CHASE THE RIGHT LOVE!! As much as it still makes no sense in the context of the album, I love the fact that this song is an actual duet. Both of their vocal performances are amazing. The production is snappy and has its tight groove. Halsey needs to be paired with better writers to get songs just as amazing as this one.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): Greg Kurstin is a gem, hopefully this slays just like Higher did the EP rate

**twat\_brained** (10): The production on this song is EVERYTHING, not to mention the chemistry between Lauren and Halsey here is very palpable and elevates the song to perfection for me.

**Verdantshade** (10): a fucking standout track, perhaps halsey's best since is there somewhere. it fully deserves to be a single wyd halsey???

**HalfAlienRobot** (9.9): bisexuality is real and it's such a bop.

**melodyllic\_** (9.5): sophisticated synth-bop!!! should be the next single!

**vayyiqra** (9): my lesbian synthpop jam

**1998tweety** (8.8): If there's one thing I like about Halsey, its how unapologetic she is about being bi. At first I was not feeling this song at all, and tbh I feel like you guys overrate it because its a lesbian bop, but if we're being fair that's a valid reason for liking a song. I still don't think its a 10, but it has grown on me since my first listen.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8.5): B O P

**awryj** (8): overrated but still good

**cucumberanti** (8): Still mad she never made this a single. We need a wlw bop on the radio!!!!!!!!!

**MrSwearword** (8): I still can't tell who's singing what but someone's slaying on this...I think

**nooodisaster** (8): It's cool that the last song ended with "Women don't play no games" and then this song is about women playing games.

**robbiec\_** (8): halsey "i'm going to give the bi's everything they want" probably

**Solovrinne** (8): a cute bi anthem

**survivorjdmarina** (8): Also a highlight on this album, and the bisexual anthem that could have been a hit if Halsey's team had tried to push it as a single.

**technoprayers** (8): , great pop song… didn't expect it

**whatareblackhole** (8): YES BOP, OKAY BOP. Lauren sounds so good!

**We don't talk about these**
---

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.8): really overrated but still better than most of this album

**dirdbub** (7.5): reminder that when asked about working with a known homophobe (Quavo) even though the album has tons of LGBT themes Halsey deflected and tried to place the blame on some irrelevant pop girl from 2013. anywho, song's aight

**RandomRocketKat** (7): its not baaaaad, its does it job fairly well

**shineflyer** (7): this kind of pulsing beat is kinda overdone, but still, bisexuals unite.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Kinda over this? Idk, it's a bit bland for me but it is a good song.

**Raykel** (6.5): The production is good but the melody is lackluster. It takes the excitement of the production away.

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (6): Don't totally get all the love for this one, its decent, but I actually think Sorry was a better single choice.

**didney-worl** (6): perfect preteeeeenders - oh wait

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Everyone seems to like this one a lot, but it's just okay for me. Not bad by any means but just kinda...there.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): gey

**RandomHypnotica** (5.1): Don't know why popheads loves this song so much, sounds super generic and boring to me

**natsby** (5): I'm enjoying the she pronouns

**stansymash** (5): It's Passable!

**Tedyonce** (5): i just can't get into this one...? idk.

Another Lorde song that I don't really get the hype for. It feels a bit clunky and out of place in the album, and an attempt at making a pop hit again, but seems to lack some depth. 

The intro and verse is nice, but the chorus just lacks for me.

---  

**BLOWIN SHIT UP**
---

**didney-worl** (11): this is my 11 and I love it and listen to it everyday like a good follower of the Lorde

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): now you know its really gonna blow. pphugh

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (10): Pretty much the anti-Sober. It it's about just having fun with friends, getting a little drunk and crazy. Really catchy and fun, and the quirky little "phoo" makes it all the more amazing.

**dirdbub** (10): I'm about 90% certain Jai Paul ghost produced this

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): My eardrums exploded with the sheer overdose of pure perfection coming out of my headphones.

**dropthehammer11** (10): lorde's best song dont @ me

**enecks** (10): And here the hedonism of Melodrama is at its most violent and explosive - yet the explosions are weakening. Reality is setting in.

**HalfAlienRobot** (10): Last year, for Coachella, I went with my best friend and her two coworkers and we flew (from NYC) into LA and rented a car there and drove the several hours to Coachella. I can't drive and my best friend can't either, but one of her coworkers is decent at it and the other sorta can too. So the better driver drove us there, but she had to leave on an earlier flight Sunday night, so the other driver drove us back. So Monday morning, we're all exhausted, I'm in the back and I basicaly slept through the whole ride, but apparently the girl who was driving had something wrong with her eyes and was slowly losing vision over the weekend. We didn't find out until after we got back. She ended up having to go to a hospital and get surgery and spend several weeks recovering, it was really bad. But anyway, now every time I hear these lyrics, "I get your friend to drive but he can hardly see / We'll end up painted on the road, red and chrome, all the broken glass sparkling / I guess we're partying," I think of Coachella 2017.

**jimmy345960** (10): a bop for the ages

**lady\_sable** (10): i almost gave this my 11. i ended up not going for it bc this one doesn't have as much personal value to me, but it's still my second favorite song from lorde and one of my favorite songs overall.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I love Tove Lo

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Back when Green Light and Liability hadn't achieved my stamp of approval yet, this was the first song that gave me hope for Lorde's new music. Unlike some other people, I genuinely enjoy Lorde's vocals here-it's a continuation of the sardonic tone from Sober, and it prevents the song from sounding too edgy,

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I love all the little details in this track, like "d-d-d-dynamite" sounding like a ticking bomb, and the beautiful flow from the Chorus in to the second verse "blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dyna- MIGHT get your friend to drive..."

**RandomRocketKat** (10): Lorde pls stop too much bang

**Raykel** (10): I like those car-horn-like sounds in the chorus coupled with the car crash in the second verse.

**robbiec\_** (10): bang slapper slap bang I love this. As an fyi, I was listening to this on the train as I was going to a field to watch The 1975

**rotating3Dtext** (10): how is this not an official single, WHERE IS ITS MUSIC VIDEO

**skargardin** (10): Perfect lyricism and stellar production. "We'll end up painted on the road, red and chrome, all the broken glass sparkling, I guess we're partying" is a GOAT line.

**stansymash** (10): hook of the year, hook of the decade, hook of my entire life

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This song probably has my facorite lyric on the album. "We'll end up painted on the road/red and chrome/all the broken glass sparkling" is so dark, yet somehow beautiful at the same time. That dichotomy shows up quite a few times on the album, and I feel that it shows the best here.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): more like blowing my WIG up

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): a fucking legendary bop (but not the best song in the album) ((but it's probably gonna win))

**Verdantshade** (10): this is THE party tune. it's slightly unconventional but it's a lyrical masterpiece and the chorus bangs hard af. I live for lorde's whispered "boom" before the last chorus

**twat\_brained** (9.7): If you sing along to this song but don't do the explosion noise at the end of the second chorus you're not doing it right

**melodyllic\_** (9.5): probably the most on-trend song in the album, which doesn't take away from its quality, but shows how chameleon-like and adaptable lorde can be

**m4ttycool** (9): dydydydynamite

**OriginalKappa** (9): I really like this song but it doesn't really feel complete. It was perfect to be remixed but the remix has its own problems. Whatever, they're both getting the same score.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): best production on melodrama

**specfagular** (9): comment about her flop performance at the VMAs

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dq8QfM_hKA

**vayyiqra** (9): undeniably catchy

**VodkaInsipido** (9): look a bop

**awryj** (8.5): /u/BrokenGlassSparkling

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): This song is fun! The imagery is spectacular, especially the description of Lorde's drunk friend driving.

**cyborglilith** (8): It's a nice bop that used to be a favorite, but I realized how not unique it is.

**nickl00** (8): the writing on all these songs are so great

**SkyBlade79** (8): tove lo written bop. It is kind of weird to hear it without the features tho. Does get kind of samey

**Solovrinne** (8): should have been a smash

**technoprayers** (8): , The better of the two versions

**theNealCutter** (8): I'm at the weird stage of my breakup where I just keep trying on new people. I give all my best self, I try to look good, pretend I'm not as broken as I am. This is what this song captures. The pretense of a new hookup, it's fun to show all your good sides. I love the stuttering hook, the overall chill atmosphere, and that goddamn imagery. "We'll end up painted on the road, red and chrome, all the broken glass sparkling" is a forever underrated lyric for me.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.9): honestly this one goes on a little too long but it's still a bop

**Blown out of proportion mess**
---

**ScottishWhore** (7.5): feels unfinished, if it included some of the remix verses (sza + post malone) it would be better

**gannade** (7): the remix is much better but the verses and pre chorus go hard

**MrSwearword** (7): progress for Lorde where only the chorus is poorly written and everything is par

**natsby** (7): don't get me wrong, I love this song (especially 'I think you might be the same as me' and 'tell you all my best lies') but somehow this feels like one of the lesser tracks on melodrama. it's slightly generic compared to the rest of the songs and doesn't seem to push as many pop boundaries. still a great song for what it is though.

**whatareblackhole** (7): Okay, but imagine if this had been a Tove Lo song. I like this as a Lorde song, but this could have saved Blue Lips and kind of brought down Melodrama for me. I LOVE IT but…I'm conflicted lol

**fourchip** (6.5): a d.i.y queen

**nooodisaster** (6): Not bad, just feels like the only song here that someone other than Lorde could have made. A lil generic, if you will. Still, the second verse, and the "...BOOM!" save this song from being in the same league as say, Khalid's discography. Fav line: "We'll end up painted on the road, red and chrome, all the broken glass sparkling / I guess we're partying :)"

**Leixander** (5): confession time - I tried really hard to not say "meh" every single time this appeared on popheads charts

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (1): no drinking and driving references please sis don't do that hoe, thank god industry plant number one fixed that on the remix

**Mudkip1** (1): this song was EVERYTHING TO ME when she performed it live at Coachella for the first time. i don't think the studio version captured that magical feeling at all. feels very robotic and lifeless to me

Maybe Lana comes close with 8mil+ albums sold worldwide but Halsey's achievements besides Bad At Love, Now Or Never, and Closer aren't that big tbh. She's still talent though.

Yes, besides all her hits Halsey is not that big. And I needn't remind anyone just how big Closer was.

A previous top 5 hit, New York barely hit top 10, and literally only made it in the second to last day of scoring. 

The piano ballad, like many other ballads in rates, falls early on in the top 10, despite being a fan favorite, serving All Too Well teas

--- 

**Without you, Love**
---

**dirdbub** (11): @crush

**Leixander** (11): "You are the only motherfucker in the city who can handle me." still makes me shiver everytime.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (11): a highlight. a true standout. This is one of my favorite songs to listen to when I'm sad to make me more sad.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): It was a tough rate to give an 11 in. All 3 of the albums have 11-worthy songs, and also there's a Halsey album. But, at the end of the day, I had to give it to this. With a colorful and stunning video, 2017's best music video not called Humble, New York is just a triumph. Jack Antonoff and St. Vincent work literal magic to create a song that just feels so much like the city, and as someone who lives here, it's everything I've ever felt encapsulated in two minutes and thirty-five seconds. It's an anthem for a city that already has so many, but rarely are they ever this honest.

**cyborglilith** (10): I feel bad for disrespecting this song based on the simple fact that there were better lead single choices because it's actually really good. It's very tsundere and therefore appeals to me.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This reminds me of the friends I left behind when I left for the Philippines. I miss them so much. :(

**fourchip** (10): one of my favourite ballads ever

**m4ttycool** (10): only motherfucker... ouch

**melodyllic\_** (10): one of the most potent ballads ive heard in a while, mainly due to its sense of urgency. the 'we lost a hero' part is breathtakingly beautiful

**natsby** (10): totally musical theatre material, this is sweeping and gorgeous. no matter how interesting jack's production can be, I feel like these tracks where she relies less on it shine brighter.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Beautiful.

**serried** (10): my fav ballad from the album

**skargardin** (10): This immediately clicked with me. It has one of the most beautiful choruses in recent memory.

**SkyBlade79** (10): best song on the album, might dedicate this to my friend.

**technoprayers** (10): , best ballad of 2017

**Tedyonce** (10): One of my favorite ever songs. I love it so much. "I have lost a hero" breaks me every time.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): this is peak St. Vincent and it's an easy 10.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Easily my favorite on this album. The vocals, the lyrics, the production, everything just fits together so well. It's been a song that I've really related to in the last few months especially, and I honestly get a little choked up now.

**twat\_brained** (10): Why did she spend all this time with Cara frolicking about New York? Why not London? Then again does London have anything like Jungle City? It'd probably be the location where One Direction recorded their music. Beautiful song, though.

**Verdantshade** (10): I know this song was controversial as hell when it came out for being too 'pop' and 'antonoff'ed but it's incredibly short and sweet and works because of that

**whatareblackhole** (10): Ahhh I wish I'd never found out that this song is about David Bowie because now it makes me cry harder!

**1998tweety** (9.7): The "only motherfucker" line is easily the standout line on this track and one of the most memorable lines on the whole album. I'm not a huge fan of the chorus though so the song loses a few points for it. The verses remind me a lot of the ones from Happy Birthday, Johnny, which isn't a bad thing since I like them and I feel like they are still different enough.

**stansymash** (9.7): i thought this song was so underwhelming at first but my GOD has it grown on me

**nooodisaster** (9.5): Bitch, here we are: the highlight of the album, and THAT song. There's just so much emotion here and listening to this fucks me up every time. She captures how places can be inseparable from the people we know in them, the sacrifices we make for people we love, and the feeling of real support. And can I just say, Jack does not let up this whole album!!! I have an emotional connection to New York, so I'm sure that helps, but still. Annie and Jack did THAT.

**banananaise** (9): some of my old friend group have moved overseas and some have got full time jobs and some are just weird so the line 'so few of our old crew left on Astor' makes me Feel

**enecks** (9): I don't care how oversaturated songs about New York are, I can't get enough.

**followingfreeways** (9): this song in particular makes me regret not listening to st. Vincent sooner.

**mokitsu** (9): A disappointing lead single, but a great song. It's chill and pleasant, but not super impacting.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): A contrast to the epic sounds of Los Ageless, it surprisingly manages to hit almost as hard in terms of being bittersweet. It serves as an excellent foil to the former.

**robbiec\_** (9): I wish there was a version of this like the one she performed on TV with sucker instead of motherfucker but it's fine. this video is great and the Kelly Lee Owens remix is good too

**survivorjdmarina** (9): ugh queen of new york, taylor can't compare

**theNealCutter** (9): is this about Johnny? Did he die? omg. But srsly, I love the gorgeous vocals on the chorus. It adds a lot on the emotion of the song.

**swadadu** (8.5): Songs like these is where St. Vincent shines. Her voice has a certain quality that just works really well this type of production.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): this would be a cute album cut but such a bland choice as a lead single

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Taylor is shook!

**vayyiqra** (8): TS is shook, welcome to New York bih

**They don't understand talent**
---

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Digging the strings. But I wish the heavier instrumentation would carry into the verses.

**RandomRocketKat** (7): I can hear the jack so clearly here

**Solovrinne** (7): it's cute, more emotional than her usually stuff.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): I'm not sure why this was the lead single. It lacks a certain intensity that I feel would be more representative of the album. It's still well-written, but I don't find myself coming back to it.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (6): not my favorite tbh

**dropthehammer11** (6): im forgetting about these songs quickly tbh

**nickl00** (6): I like the production

**awryj** (5.5): is it just me or is this song really just... kinda... boring?

**specfagular** (5.5): this is just kind of there.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3.5): underwhelming

**I spent the whole rate trying to figure out this comment, but nothing about it makes sense, especially since New York was performed a year before It was even released**
---

**MrSwearword** (1): wait a fucking minute, is this Happy Birthday, Johnny with a different beat and slightly different sentiments? GET. THE. FUCK. OUT

The lyrics hit home, and I know it could be an age thing, but Liability is so well crafted to feel written for you, it puts Lorde up as one of the greatest writers at her age.

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (11): This track is simply stunning. The lyrics really cut like a knife, and the simple piano (in contrast to the bigger production of previous tracks) just really makes it a flawless song.

I heard this song and felt something that I have been feeling for years but have always struggled putting into words. liability is so beautiful and heartbreaking and relevant and im so glad she released this before Melodrama came out because if it wasn't for this song I wouldn't be a fan of Lorde and that would be tragic

**m4ttycool** (11): The first time I paid attention to the lyrics I cried so much, I love this song.

**WilsonJason** (11): u know i had to do it to em

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): me_irl

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i love crying

**cucumberanti** (10): Every time I feel insecure and "a little too much for everyone" I come back to this song and it makes me feel less alone.

**dirdbub** (10): I dunno why Lorde changed the lyrics so it isn't gay, we all know gays can't drive and Lorde wasn't driving in "Green Light" so

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): This really reminds me of "After All..." by The Cardigans, and they're one of my favorite bands plus this is honestly heartbreaking a fucking rock would cry hearing this masterpiece.

**enecks** (10): ;-; This is a legitimately painfully sad track. The lyrics are so amazing - legitimately well-written.

**HalfAlienRobot** (10): The songwriting on this is SO good.

**InfernalSolstice** (10): excuse me I'm gonna go cry

**jimmy345960** (10): this almost was my eleven. I have cried twice to this song. One of my mom's friends died last year, I've known her since I was a baby. I never really got to say goodbye. The last time I saw her was a funeral. It was sad. The whole thing is sad. This song reminded me of her. I also cried thinking about myself, but that was drunk so its not as meaningful.

**kappyko** (10): fuck lmfao

**Leixander** (10): "they are gonna watch me disappear into the sun" is such a satisfying ending, adding a happy ending to a really moody/relatable song is unusual and I love how Lorde/Jack did this

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): honestly theres so many 11 candidates for this album alone and this is one of them. This is too relatable. I'm a liability. I'll go home to the arms of the girl that I love, hopefully it's a love I haven't screwed up. Yet.

**Mudkip1** (10): we love a ballad

**OriginalKappa** (10): Why is this song so good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Without a doubt, one of the most powerful tracks on Melodrama. It's infinitely heartwrenching, breathtaking and simply beautiful.

**robbiec\_** (10): in the feelings

**skargardin** (10): One of the best ballads in recent years, holy shit her lyrics are just out of this world.

**specfagular** (10): GOD I love this song so much. So relatable.

**stansymash** (10): a song so beautiful and emotional it could crack fantano's cold icy heart

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj_aNaNg1vc

**theburningundead** (10): Catch me being sad listening to this in the dark on a Friday night, or any other night for that matter

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): why am i so fucking sad

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Heartbreaking and very relatable. The stripped down production fits the open nature of the song really well, and the lyrics are some of Lorde's best.

**twat\_brained** (10): "I am a toy that people enjoy 'till all of the tricks don't work anymore" :emofish: I'm not much of a ballad guy but this is such a beautiful song"

**Verdantshade** (10): THE best ballad of 2017. it's honest and crushing and relatable. it shows the immense development lorde has had between pure heroine and now - on most albums the mid-album acoustic track would be filler but this is a centrepiece of melodrama

**Solovrinne** (9.9): Every breakup album needs the sad anthem. This delivers.

**cyborglilith** (9.5): relatable except I don't go to parties

**fourchip** (9.5): this made me cry and made my mum think lorde was a lesbian

**lady\_sable** (9.5): one day i'll be able to listen to this in full without crying

**melodyllic\_** (9.5): had a good ol cry to this, who can relate? (woo!!!)

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I definitely felt like I was taken advantage by some of my so-called friends so this song hits home hard.

**MrSwearword** (9): she sounds fabulous on the chorus and the piano work is lovely. The first verse on the other hand, sucks.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Absolutely heartbreaking, though I'm not able to escape the accidental lesbian subtexts in one of the lines (y'all know the one). This is the best use of piano on Melodrama, that's for sure.

**technoprayers** (9): , Invented feeling like you're the cause of everything wrong in life

**theNealCutter** (9): this is a song I don't listen to often. Partly because it's too sad to keep your headspace in. It's a little heartbreaking that this comes right after The Louvre, making it seem like the relationship was ended before it settled down. But mostly, because I don't like to be reminded that I used to think like this. Because as much as you'd believe that it's true, it's not. People care, it's just the wrong timing, and the broken headspace.

**whatareblackhole** (9): I thought this song was kinda queer the first time I heard it and I still think that because Lorde being kinda queer is a dream

**RandomRocketKat** (8.5): oh wow my heart is moving now instead of my body

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): A fantastic ballad that also sets the mood for the rest of the album. The piano is a really glorious addition to the track.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): This song is the definition of :genericsad:

**CarlieScion** (8): This used to make me cry, but I think I've just become an emotionless shell so I don't like it as much anymore

**dropthehammer11** (8): touching, v real ballad

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Again, the same problem as Green Light, this left me wanting so much more.

**nooodisaster** (8): It's a little scary how literally EVERYONE relates to this song. Like, humans are fucked up yall. Beyond that, there's not much else to say. It barely feels like a full song, and honestly I would've liked a lil more. But the first verse is one of the best examples of lyrical storytelling in awhile. Serving "Guess Who I Saw Today" teas. Fav line: "But all that a stranger would see/Is one girl swaying alone, stroking her cheek"

**vayyiqra** (8): mood

**The Ballad Curse Lives**
---

**natsby** (7): I appreciate this song for its quality, unique themes and general brilliance, but I just don't personally love it. in all honesty, it might be a bit too painful and raw for me.

**nickl00** (7): not a fan of piano ballads, but this is still great

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): i think the instrumental is cute but this song is a bit depressing

**VodkaInsipido** (7): the second worst song of the album but still a cute ballad

**awryj** (6.5): I would like this song more if she actually sang the verses

**SkyBlade79** (5): this is just an emo song for gay people

**gannade** (0): Lorde is a nice vocalist, but she doesn't exactly have a voice for ballads, and Liability exposes all those weaknesses. The real reason this gets my 0, however, is because of the pretentious lyrics. It basically sounds like a facebook status. "I'm too much, i'm just so chaotic, people can't handle me, i'm just so abnormal and too different for people to get." Like okay, it's cool that you got baggage and problems, Lorde. So does everybody else, but I guess we're all just better adjusted and know how to cope with it. Lorde (and apparently a lot of popheads :eyes:) isnt really any different than everyone else, no matter how much she thinks she is.

The Jack and Jill line gets me fucked up every time. No regrets, it is a stellar song, and deserved top 5 over the remaining songs left tbh.

---

**JACK AND JILL GET FUCKED UP WHEN IT GETS DARK**
--- 


**HalfAlienRobot** (11): I can't believe I'm not giving my 11 to Halsey, I am so sorry, I'm such a fake Halsey stan. Sober is so good though aaahhhh I'm gonna go hide now. /whispers from the back, 'jack and jill get fucked up and possesive when it get daaark'

**vayyiqra** (11): love this song

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): perfect party bop, literally flawless.

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (10): The tension in this song is palpable. Once again, incredible songwriting. It perfectly captures the unsure feeling in your gut that often appears at big parties.

**cyborglilith** (10): slightly overrated but still good

**dirdbub** (10): the first time I heard "Jack and Jill get fucked up and possessive" my depression was cured

**dropthehammer11** (10): now THIS is a song. the vocal samples and the horns are a great touch

**enecks** (10): This track is a sobering experience after the synaesthetic spectacle of Green Light - pun intended. There is anxiety about the future - the question of "what will we do when we're sober" is a direct embodiment of this album's undercurrent of fear. Yet, there's triumph in this tragedy - bold trumpets, a rush, the promise of the morning.

**InfernalSolstice** (10): the outro oh my god

**jimmy345960** (10): I remember listening to this song before it was released because she performed it live. It only got better being released!

**Marshynarsh** (10): one of the bests off the album, it's dark and fun and has the best line "Jack and Jill got fucked up and possessive When they get dark"

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I love the Song Exploder episode on this one and it's cute when they talked about the bridge when they interpolated a Lion's roar

**Mudkip1** (10): buT whaT wilL wE dO wheN we'rE sobeR

**nickl00** (10): oml this is so amazing

**RandomHypnotica** (10): "Jack and Jill get fucked up and possessive when it gets dark" is such a POWERFUL moment

**RandomRocketKat** (10): :weray: This is too much for me all at once

**SkyBlade79** (10): what a bop, amazing production and lyrics. The jack and jill part… wew. Christina augileria is a little bit shook tho

**theburningundead** (10): I love the ending to this song so much and it's a great change of pace after Green Light that really shows off the variation in what the album has to offer

**theNealCutter** (10): in a deep trance of being drunk because of a breakup, everything is weird. you'll talk to guys, flirt, maybe even hook up. But deep inside, you just know that this is for the night only, nothing will last. For me, I'm trying to recapture the feeling again. That endless rush of being in love, but the awareness that you're just doing this because you're broken makes yearn to keep trying until you find the rush that lasts. I love the constant beat and the ominous horn blasts on the chorus. It's a constant tense feeling that just rises even more and more up to the beat switch. It's a song about the doubts and rush of partying, but ironically, not a song you'll play on parties.

**twat\_brained** (10): Selena WHOmez am I right lmao but seriously when I heard this live in August and when she opened with this on the Melodrama Tour I felt that so hard

**Verdantshade** (10): HORNS!! I think it's the weakest of the singles but it's still amazing. I'm not too big a fan of the "jack and jill got fucked up" line but it's still a 10 in my book

**rotating3Dtext** (9.8): every time i listen to it i discover new things

**m4ttycool** (9.5): but we care

**Raykel** (9.5): Almost perfect but it's missing something, I don't know what exactly. But I wonder if it would've been better if it was more bombastic.

**stansymash** (9.2): i love this song. if only there were some way to see this song exploded. in a podcast.

**CarlieScion** (9): Good, but Sober II is better

**cucumberanti** (9): The synths! The trumpets! Jake and Jill get fucked up and possessive when it get dark! The tiger roar at the beginning of the bridge!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): That Jack and Jill lyric is so iconic. It could have cringey as fuck but the way Lorde nailed it on the delivery.

**melodyllic\_** (9): minimalist bangers? whos complaining? definitely not me

**nooodisaster** (9): "You'll be dancing with us." First of all, this song is plain cool, and continues the tradition of songs called "Sober" absolutely fucking slaying. The mix of horns, pitched samples, and trop-hop drums is something both unique and quintessentially 2017. This song, more than any other, feels like the evolution of Pure Heroine: it's still partying and wistful, but it's darker, more dangerous, and honed. Fav line: "I'm acting like I don't see/Every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me."

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): This is one of my favorite songs from this album. It does a really good job at setting up the darker themes present in Melodrama and the bridge where Lorde basically snarls at the microphone is awesome. I just wish it ended with a final chorus without any production instead of that mildly disappointing outro.

**skargardin** (9): This makes me want to dance in the streets at 3AM.

**specfagular** (9): "what will we do when we're sober" bitch idk probably drink some water and take an ibuprofen then let the regret sink in like a normal person

**survivorjdmarina** (9): The beat and production are flawless, and the lyrics really encapsulate the emotions of Lorde. Also, that tiger roar from the start of the bridge was a very innovative addition!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx96Twg-Aew

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): it never really explodes like you'd expect it to. great song still.

**whatareblackhole** (9): This song captivated me from the first time I heard it. I always get ROWDY during that clap beat moment in the final moment/verse thing.

**awryj** (8.8): a bop but that jack & jill line is really bad

**robbiec\_** (8.7): I cackled so hard at the Song Exploder for this track when she says really broad and enthusiastically "I WAS GOING TO LOTS OF PAAAHRDYS"

**Not as Good When You are Sober tbh**
---

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Not as good as the previous track but still really great

**kappyko** (8): This used to be my favorite for the horns, but it blended so hard into Homemade Dynamite that i forgot to rate it

**natsby** (8): this is so catchy and unexpected and intense. the moment I started realising how special this album could be was the first time I heard lorde hiss 'jack and jill get fucked up and possessive when they get dark'

**VodkaInsipido** (8): the horns or whatever they're can fuck me up

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.5): "queen of the wEeEkend" and the trumpet shit get me hyped af but the rest falls kind of flat idk

**Leixander** (6): I don't think the pacing of this song works. The chorus just feels flat to me but Lorde's lyricism saves the day.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): doesn't really stand out

**gannade** (5.5): the first minute had me thoroughly shook but then the rest of the song was just the first minute repeated over and over????

**Solovrinne** (5): I don't like it. I think it sounds bizarre.

**MrSwearword** (3): P!nk did a song called "Sober" WAY better than this schlock

**Tedyonce** (0): I don't know why i hate this song when i ADORE the rest of the album. it doesn't go anyway, it feels boring, and it is not a bop. i LOVE the production, but I was expecting to have it explode at the end. one note the whole way through

This almost stole my 11 from Annie. This song is top 10 of 2017 for me. It is bright, happy, but also somber enough to feel like trademark Lana. Everything about this works so well, the melody, vocals, and aesthetics work so well. 

And FYI. 

This song was at number 2 for awhile, and top 5 for literally almost the entire rate, but the last week saw Love dip low and just fell.

--- 

**I'm in love with LDR**
--- 

**gannade** (11): i am in love with this song

**letsallpoo** (11): the first sign i received in 2017 that good music was on its way

**nickl00** (11): Amazing first single and Lana is truly on top of her game here. I feel like it's a little underappreciated so I'm giving it my 11

**survivorjdmarina** (11): wow she really invented love with THAT

**therokinrolla** (11): my favorite song of 2017 came at a GREAT moment. For the first time ever i took a big vacation with friends to california, really really enjoying everything in my life, and i checked popheads for the first time that day and I saw that it was leaked. I desperately looked for a leak, needing it so badly, but couldnt find it . I checked popheads for lead but instead of seeing that I saw "[FRESH] Lana Del Rey - Lust For Life." It was only out on the play store at that, and, being the young whippersnapper that I am, bought my first ever digital copy of a song (I usually stream). I forgot my headphones that day, so while I was freaking out in the car I was shoving the phone up against my ear. The first time I heard the prechorus, and the transition into the chorus was something else. It was oddly surreal, my favorite artist of all time releasing an incredible lead single during one of my happiest moments. An absolute 11.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): bop

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): soft ethereal aesthetic

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (10): I think some Lana fans may find it cheesy or something, but I think it's a beautiful song with a great message. It was the song that finally got me to listen to Lana's discography. Without it I wouldn't have discovered one of my favorite artists.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): don't worry baby

**cucumberanti** (10): She sounds so happy and satisfied I cried.

**didney-worl** (10): Buy Lust for Life on iTunes

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is classic Lana with a more optimistic message. I stan.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Lana at her best on this album.

**enecks** (10): This is a track from an alternate world in which Lana lived up to her potential. It's haunting, atmospheric, moody - yet intimate and relatable. A powerful anthem that promises a better album then what we get.

**followingfreeways** (10): what a great opener!! I dislike this entire album but I am really thankful this rate made me listen to it because I got to be introduced to this song

**InfernalSolstice** (10): probably my favorite lana song

**lady\_sable** (10): listening to this in your room in the middle of the night is a mythical experience

**m4ttycool** (10): This is a magical experience

**melodyllic\_** (10): such a beautifully nostalgic and uplifting track! despite still retaining the slow lana-esque feel, the song has an anthemic vibe which allows her to deliver one of her most pure messages. probably her best single to date.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is what heaven sounds like

**MrSwearword** (10): YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS

**natsby** (10): this song sounds like the inevitable conclusion of 'a lana del rey song, but surprisingly positive' - given this, it's amazing how Love manages to feel so perfect and well-formed even as it threatens to become generic.

**nooodisaster** (10): The opener, and the best song of the album. If Lorde can't win, this is my pick. Reasons this is a 10: 1. The booming opening to the chorus. 2. "Young and in loOoOooOoOooOOoove" 3. Singing to the kids, then turning the lyrics to herself. 4. Feels like a lost Vietnam-era hit. 5. With all the stress of trying to make it in life and in my career-field and feeling like I have to do something AMAZING with my life, Lana telling me "it's enough to be young, and in love". 6 "You get all dressed up/To go nowhere in particular" is so romantic and cute. 7. Feels like she's trying to calm all the scared and disenchanted millennial fans she has. "Don't worry baby."

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): This song never gets brought up when talking about the album which is a shame because it's one of Lana's most beautiful tracks.

**RandomRocketKat** (10): honestly such a good song yet the rest of this, :yikes:

**specfagular** (10): the lead single is easily one of the best songs on the album.

**Tedyonce** (10): one of 2017's most beautiful songs.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Honestly? Her best song. It's the perfect summation of what Lana Del Rey is all about. Vintage instrumentation, wistful lyrics, and an overbearing sense of bittersweet love. Love is her thesis statement, an unkept promise that Lana was going to become our retrofuturist queen. Bioshock was ended when this dropped and Ken Levine retired because he could never top this song's visuals. One of the best songs of 2017.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): lowkey could have just stopped the album here with Cherry as a deluxe track

**theNealCutter** (10): honestly, I can't say anything bad about this song. It's gorgeously produced, lush and atmospheric. the lyrics best represent the good sides of this album. Honestly, one of the best songs of the album, maybe even of the year.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): her best song since Young and Beautiful

**VodkaInsipido** (10): tbh one of her best singles

**cyborglilith** (9.5): dat VIDEO is lit

**kappyko** (9.5): :(

**awryj** (9): What I love about this song is that it's so simple that it could be included on that 4 Chord Song Compilation and yet it sounds so rich

**chipsi1** (9): I dedicate this song to charli xcx

**robbiec\_** (9): the bridge is so transcendent

**twat\_brained** (9): This is a very charming tune and I remember really looking forward to the album when it came out.

**Verdantshade** (9): an excellent comeback single for lana, showing her return to her roots

**WilsonJason** (9): Brittin Lane's cover is better and you can't deny it

**Leixander** (8): i felt really sad for lana when the photo ad for this was leaked. a bad way to start her "happy" era :(

**Marshynarsh** (8): A solid first single and so nice to see Lana happy in a music video

**skargardin** (8): As much a Lana song as there ever was, it's pretty solid.

**Solovrinne** (8): I think this track was trying too hard to appeal to emotionally unstable misfit teenagers. That aside, I love how it sounds.

**technoprayers** (8): , an amazing lead single that was a highlight of 2017

**vayyiqra** (8): I want to be in outer space with Lana <3

**stansymash** (7.8): interesting topic

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): this song is super cute, super lana

**CarlieScion** (7): The production is mesmerizing, but it's slightly too long

**whatareblackhole** (7): I like this for an opener, but it's not my favorite on the album.

**Heartbroken**
---

**dirdbub** (6.5): do you ever hear a line in a song that makes you pause the song for a solid five minutes before you continue the song? yeah, that happened with "you're part of the past, but now you're the future" but not because it's poignant or deep or anything. it's purely because of how fucking stupid that line is

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): lana is boring but this song is decent

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): I should find this song's slowness beautiful but I think it's a little boring.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): Overrated! People say "wow this is really a turn to the positive side for Lana" but there's nothing musically that indicates that. I'm not surprised this did nothing on the charts.

**SkyBlade79** (2): boooooring and overrated

**I see the Light, I want it**

**amumumyspiritanimal** (11): Oh boy I'm not gonna do it. I'm already at 6652 characters from the limited 10000(that is also less than the amount of times I listened to this song, its at 10k+ atm lol send me help). Just know that because of this song I'd commit murder for Lorde. Not even hesitating. I think I'm slowly going mad with obsession??

**enecks** (11): Every first track of an album is a thesis - whether the artist want to admit or not. And Green Light is a bold statement alright - of glittery punchy pop, of bringing ENERGY and PASSION to pop, of establishing a narrative of heartbreak. Make no mistake - this should have been as big and as influential as Royals. This is a gem of modern pop - god damn it it's a masterpiece - intensely visual in a synaesthetic way.

**jimmy345960** (11): So. This song. I remember laying on the floor of an apartment that I used to live in when I first listened to it. It was spectacular then, and its spectacular now. I remember listening to this for hours and hours. It never gets old. On my walks to class and my drives home. This must've been played 1000 times last year. Actually it was my most listened to song of 2017, right ahead of Gorgeous. On May 10, 2017, I remember that this kid that I was obsessed with went home for the semester. I got drunk by myself and went on a walk. In the pitch black. My college town is relatively safe but it was pretty reckless. Anyway, I was a track runner, so naturally I decided to walk all the way to my college's track. I just remember being trashed and running. I ran to 1989, by our snek queen, and this song. I ended when this song ended. I just thought about myself and what I wanted to do. No crying, just thinking. I'm still in contact with this guy (still haven't adopted Dua's rules) but its gotten easier. I am moving on, and every time I think about this song it just gives me the amazing feeling of acceptance. I scream at the top of my lungs this song. I never skip it. Liability and Writer in the Dark were my other options, but they will never make me feel the same way Green Light makes me feel.

**swadadu** (11): This is one of the few songs that I liked on the first listen that continued to grow on me. It wasn't until November of last year that this song became my favorite on Melodrama. There is nothing more freeing than yelling and dancing along to this song.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): This song takes me places. I've had an eventful year since this came out, and every time I feel like I don't know what I'm doing and I need to just let go I find myself shouting "I'M WAITING FOR IT! THAT GREEN LIGHT! I WANT IT!" (it's very emotional for me)

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (10): Okay, my ratings for Melodrama are going to seem like I'm standing too hard, but I genuinely think it is an incredible album, deserving of great scores. I'll leave reviews on all songs to explain. Green Light is a big, energetic opener, and a perfect way to start the album. Really clever songwriting, should've been a bigger hit.

**dirdbub** (10): mood: the driver vaping while Lorde is having a mental breakdown on top of his car

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): I would give this an eleven but I know it's going to place first so I'm giving it to something else. I didn't think it was possible for a song to compound greatness with every listen like this one does. It's hard to believe it's been a year since its release but it just keeps getting better and better.

**dropthehammer11** (10): A great opener. Love the pianos on this track and the general energy.

**fourchip** (10): a club smasher

**kappyko** (10): I trashedd this on its release im sorry everyone

**lady\_sable** (10): the first time i listened to this song, it was about 11pm at night and i was on the bus ride back from a day-long trip to philadelphia with my school orchestra. i wish i could experience green light in that way again.

**m4ttycool** (10): yes traffic lights

**melodyllic\_** (10): transcendent, subtly innovative and a prime example of the fluidity that modern pop can have across genres

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I'm honestly just anxious to see the controversy score for this one.

**Mudkip1** (10): i love dancing the way Lorde does to this song. very fun and carefree

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): AN ALBUM OPENER. An incredible song that feels so different from everything else (maybe it's the "incorrect songwriting"). One of my favorites.

**OriginalKappa** (10): Best hit song of last year

**RandomHypnotica** (10): wow I can't believe Lorde invented traffic lights.

**stansymash** (10): i remember hearing this when it first came out and finding it kind of underwhelming. and now its a 10/10 opener to the best album of the decade. MAN did i see the light. the green light which i am waiting for

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Come through lead single! A bop through-in and throughout, I'm sad that it didn't get the attention it should have gotten in the US. Also, lyrics; they're amazing, not that I woud have expected less.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuiY7up8UM0

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): y'all hate on this too much, like imagine sprinting down the fucking street when that piano starts to kick in... whew

**theburningundead** (10): I have loved this song since it was first released but if I felt even the slightest amount of doubt towards it that disappeared completely when I experienced it live last year. It's hard to put into words the feelings that this song evokes but it just acts as such an emotional release, belting out the chorus in a room with 2000 other people is a memory I'll cherish forever. I wish I could go back and listen to it again for the first time, it's so wonderfully unpredictable and it immediately throws you in the deep end of the album, overall just a stellar opening track.

**theNealCutter** (10): when this song was first released, I was a little disappointed on how it turned out. It sounded too pop for Lorde, but as I listened to it more, I realized that her sound is so copied by so many people, that she honestly stood out more. I'm in love with how bitingly angry the song is. From the chords, the beat, the catharsis of the chorus, the lyrics, even to Lorde's vocal performance. It's a song for the minute after the breakup. Everything is so intense. You don't know how you feel, are you angry? are you sad? are you disappointed? At best, you're just hoping for the feeling to be over soon. As Spectrum Pulse said, this is a breakup song that Beyonce would've made, a breakup song with no regret, no sadness, just pure fury.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): I didn't like this song at all when it came out, but it really grew on me hard. The pounding piano, weary feel of it all, and soaring hook all just work really well. I'm indifferent on most of the rest of the album, but this one really speaks to me.

**twat\_brained** (10): I don't care what Max Martin says, I don't care what my close Brazilian friend says, I fucking loved this song when it first came out and I remember playing it like 10 times the day it came out. Hearing this live was euphoric and I'm excited to hear it live again a few days after my birthday.

**Verdantshade** (10): lorde's comeback single!!! it had me so hyped for new lorde - it's a banging tune and even though it was far more maximalist than anything lorde had ever done before I was extremely excited for her new direction

**WilsonJason** (10): The fact that this song wasn't a smash hit makes me hate everyone

--- 

--- 

Personally, not really a fan, but I can totally see why everyone loves this. The beat and production is still top notch, the issue for me comes in the melody, and seems to lack in that department. 

--- 

**Belongs in the Louvre**
--- 

**cucumberanti** (11): It captures that dizzying and all consuming feeling of falling in love so well, it takes my breathe away every single time. BUT WE'RE THE GREATEST/THEY'LL HANG US IN THE LOUVRE/DOWN THE BACK BUT WHO CARES/ STILL THE LOUVRE (!!!!!!!!!!!)

**nooodisaster** (11): "Can you hear the violence?" Oh god. This song. THIS SONG. First, every verse in this song is a stunning mix of insanely personal and unbelievably relatable. Lorde has a once-in-a-generation talent for this, for finding details that one could only know from first-hand experience, but that echo beyond. We're then lead out of the verse, building to an explosive chorus.. only to have all the momentum diffuse into a sonic cloud. It's unexpected, but so fucking powerful. She's taking her love for this boy, the way he makes her heart beat, and says she'll make the whole world dance to it. It's bizarre and beautiful and something anyone in love would understand. And we haven't even gotten to the best part. I waffled so much about which song to give my 11 to. But I think I've settled on this. Simply because, where I am in my life, I can relate to The Louvre the most strongly. Life update: I finally, after 22 years of gayness and loneliness, have my first boyfriend, and he's pretty awesome. I can't describe the way this song makes me feel starting from "Okay, I know that you are not my type." All I can say is that by the chorus, I'm usually screaming out the lyrics, sometimes with a tear in my eye, feelings closer to a feeling I've waited my whole life to grasp. Fav line: https://genius.com/Lorde-the-louvre-lyrics

**technoprayers** (11): , I really enjoyed this track as a whole

**theburningundead** (11): I love every song on Melodrama but I just keep coming back to this track. It may only be four and a half minutes long but it feels so immersive and cinematic, I get such vivid imagery in my head listening to it. I love the anticipation that builds throughout and the unconventional structure which really fits the atmosphere of the song, it soars to great heights but never lets you get too comfortable before changing things up. I know that some people were disappointed by the chorus when the album was released but I honestly wouldn't have it any other way, it fits so perfectly with the song and I can just close my eyes and be transported away for a moment in time. On a similar note, the outro is a necessary time for reflection before continuing on to the rest of the album and it again confronts your expectations like the credits of a movie rolling before you're quite ready for it to end. The song covers some familiar ground in terms of lyrical themes but with a unique spin that really sets it apart, and the touches of humour and poetic commentary on otherwise ordinary moments are so wonderful and typically Lorde. A standout on an already fantastic album with excellent production and instrumentation to top it all off, what's not to love?

**Verdantshade** (11): as with most albums in 2017, the first time I heard melodrama in full was after a party. melodrama came out at a time when I had just gotten a girlfriend and went partying quite a bit. no song in 2017, bar dreams tonite, captured the feeling of falling in love so perfectly - everything from the anti-chorus to the witty lyrics encapsulated everything I felt , and though it soundtracked the summer of last year, it still remains my favourite lorde song outside of the context I first heard it in

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): this was my everything last summer alongside with the whole album.

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (10): I was divided on whether I should give this my 11, give Supercut my 11 or Liability. Totally captures the feeling of a crush, the songwriting is so hyperbolic and perfect. The chorus is iconic, and the guitar at the end is A+++. Probably my favorite production on the whole album.

**CarlieScion** (10): A cute bop

**cyborglilith** (10): Her vivid lyricism is similar Taylor Swift's, and she deserves praise for it.

**dirdbub** (10): the beat drop sounds like my head is being shoved into a pool of water by my crush but like. in the best and most loving way possible

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): TBH this is more of a 7-8 but I don't want Popheads to hunt me down and kill me plus those BOOM BOOMs kill me every time so there.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): It took a while for the song's anti-chorus to grow on me but this is easily one of my favorite songs on the album.

**HalfAlienRobot** (10): "I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush." This reminds me of when one of my ex's called me a "sociopathic manic pixie dream girl" when I broke up with him, tbh I'm pretty proud of that.

**InfernalSolstice** (10): down the back, but who cares, still the louvre

**jimmy345960** (10): goddamn I'm just giving Melodrama a shit ton of 10's. Anyway, this is the most Taylor song that Taylor hasn't written. it used to be one of my fav's but it sank in ranking to just amazing song lol.

**kappyko** (10): it's like i'm submerged in the saliva she was spitting into my ears on "Homemade Dynamite" and i am falling into the crevices of lorde's wrinkled cosmic brain

**m4ttycool** (10): still the Louvre

**melodyllic\_** (10): the effortlessly warm and liberating yet subdued nature of this track sorta blew me away on first listen, and demonstrates the real purpose of the anti-chorus: to take away suspense and build it up, while also releasing the tension

**MrSwearword** (10): despite the fucking stupid lyrics "I overthink your p-punctuation use" & "Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom, And make 'em all dance to it", I can actually like this based on production and Lorde sounding like she doesn't have her head lodged up her ass.

**natsby** (10): even though I'm rationally convinced I'm sick of the 'broadcast the boomboomboomboom and makethemalldancetoit' bits, I am completely infatuated with this song. I would list my favourite parts, but then this comment would be way too long. let me just say that 'down the back, but who cares? still the lourve' somehow made me laugh whilst still feeling bitterly nostalgic and full of longing. the fluid beat adds so much to an already-brilliant song, as does the languishing outtro. amazing.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): A triumph in every single way. The drop. The outdo. The lyrics. No one but Lorde could've made this and it's utter perfection.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): "Down the back, but who cares, still the Louvre" is so ICONIC

**skargardin** (10): It took a while for The Louvre to click with me but once it did, it was glorious. It's so masterfully well done.

**Solovrinne** (10): Competes with Ribs for being her best song. This is the Lorde I know and love. The outro takes it from a 9 to a 10.

**specfagular** (10): if not for hard feelings/loveless this would be my 11

**stansymash** (10): that outro is so beautiful it tears me apart in a big way. jesus mary this song is wonderful

**survivorjdmarina** (10): One of my favorites, and a fan favorite also. The rustic underwater-esque guitars really set the mood for the whole album.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): broadcast my WIG

**theNealCutter** (10): This is exactly how it feels to have a crush. The subtle rumbling of the guitar, paired with her cooing vocals, and her vividly written lyrics. It feels like you're dumped underwater. It's overwhelming, it's suffocating, it's everything you want to feel all the time. But as overwhelming as it is, there's some comfort and peace you can find in it. Just like the guitar outro, it's bright and sunny, but also spacious and distant.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): it's just so beautiful and different and lovely. very close to being my 11. and since my 11 isn't gonna win I hope this does.

**twat\_brained** (10): I loved this when I first heard it, I loved it live at Osheaga, I'm gonna love it live in Toronto, I love it when it comes onto shuffle; there's nothing about this song I don't love. This song just radiates so much joy when it comes on. I'm literally getting goosebumps as I type this because of how fantastic this song is.

**whatareblackhole** (10): I love this song so much, especially that moment that all us gays are obsessed with, so I'm not even going to bother mentioning it

**rotating3Dtext** (9): works best in the context of the album, i feel the song's a great closer for it
**awryj** (8): For some reason I like this song much more when listening to the whole album, but on its own, it's kinda meh

Oddly enough, Lorde's closer is her closer for her run in the rate, and holy shit what a run it was. I'm not sure what the record is for most dominated top 10, but having 7 songs, and 4 of which in the top 5, that is fucking insane. 

However. 

Lorde fell apart in the way a few pointed out, Lorde's huge strength of tracks is amazing for an album, but for a rate, it splits up her 11s. Sure, she gets a giant ass amount of 10s, but she had 5+ 11s on multiple songs in this rate, and because of that, Perfect Places, Supercut, The Louvre, and Green Light were all in the number 2 spot, but one would get a low score, and another Lorde song would take over, but none of them got close enough to grasp the crown. 

--- 

**CH CH**
--- 

**InfernalSolstice** (11): my favorite non-kesha song of 2017, a masterpiece, one of lorde's very best

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): ugh just fuck me right up

**twat\_brained** (11): # CH CH Every single time I hear this I get goosebumps. Hearing it live just enhanced this effect for me and it makes me incredibly eager to hear it live again before the end of the month. I wanted to give my 11 to the song I thought would win the most and this one just feels so poignant and encapsulating in a way that no other song in this rate does.

**VodkaInsipido** (11): still the best song of 2017, the best Lorde song and easily one of my favourite songs because everything works and woo i FUCKING RELATE TO IT

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): why isnt this a Diamond RIAA song??? Also, this is literally the perfect album finisher song. Green Light picked up right where A World Alone left off, and this song gives us a "we will continue" kind of finish. You feel finished with some parts of the album, but there is still the craving for more, and a whole lot of unfinished business. What the fuck are perfect places anyways?

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (10): Perfect big finale to a fantastic album, big pop production, and... you guessed it, amazing songwriting.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i know. wig. i feel that already.

**cucumberanti** (10): I keep seeing people call Supercut the Ribs of this album and while that's 100% valid, imo if we're just looking at the lyrics/themes Perfect Places is the natural successor. A perfect conclusion to the album.

**dirdbub** (10): cannot stop thinking about that post that says "Lorde may not know what perfect places are, but I know it's the alleyway behind the 7/11 at 2:35AM after chugging a big gulp of Five Hour Energy to fight my shadow demons"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Goddamn, a perfect way to end this album. A anthem for millenials anywhere. Baby boomers are shook.

**dropthehammer11** (10): im picking this to win tbh and while i stan halsey hard, this song is deserving

**Elitefourbrad** (10): From the moment I first listened to this album, I knew this would be the song with the most replay quality. I know everyone loves Lorde being all sad and everything, but I think she's at her best while happy. She just wants to go to perfect places, me and you both Lorde.

**enecks** (10): YASS QUEEN EMBRACE THE FACT THAT LIFE IS MEANINGLESS AND BEAUTIFUL. WE STAN.

**Leixander** (10): obligatory CH CH

**m4ttycool** (10): you can't just "tch tch" and not expect a 10

**Marshynarsh** (10): My favourite of the album and second favourite of her discography. Even though I don't party anymore it encapsulates the feeling that I had back in university days. Also the little chi chi boom part before the first chorus is the best part of the entire album

**melodyllic\_** (10): this should have received so much more promo (same could be said for any other "single" she released this era) because it's the perfect pop song! euphoric, free and celebratory: lorde like she's never been before

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): if St. Vincent wasn't in this rate, this would have been my 11. "What the fuck are perfect places anyway?" It's a simple, yet captivating line that truly makes you think, do perfect places even actually exist? All the while "perfect places" also being a metaphor for a perfect mental state of mind. Fuck it. Maybe this should have been my 11? 🤔

**nooodisaster** (10): "Are you lost enough?" This is how you do it!! When this single first dropped I finally thought Lorde had dropped a smash, and in the context of the album it's even better. At first brush, it seems like this is a simple party anthem for jilted millennials. But at the end of Melodrama, it becomes much more bittersweet. After we've seen the journey of Lorde's breakup and loneliness, lines like "Now I can't stand to be alone" hit like a fucking truck. The world is on fire, she's lost the love of my life, and alcohol can only create an illusionary escape. Let's give into it. Fav line: "I hate the headlines and the weather/I'm 19 and I'm on fire"

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): TCHK TCHK

**OriginalKappa** (10): why was this not a worldwide smash hit i hate humanity

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): I think this is most people's favorite song on the album, and I can't blame them-this returns to the jaded optimism (or is it positive cynicism? Take your pick) of Green Light, except in more poignant flourishes. One thing Penguin pointed out in his analysis of Melodrama was the fact that Lorde most likely wrote this soon after the death of David Bowie, which gives the 'all of our heroes fading' line so much more sentimentality. My only problem with this is that the bridge at the end of the first chorus should have been recycled at least once, since it sounds amazing, but that's fairly trivival.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): that chk chk is what i LIVE for

**robbiec\_** (10): this is just pure magic in a song

**skargardin** (10): There are so many things about Perfect Places that I love. The "tch-tch", the chorus, the impeccable production, Lorde's husky vocals and of course the final line: "what the fuck are Perfect Places anyway".

**SkyBlade79** (10): great song lorde. You done good. The synths are amazing and the final bridge is an 11

**specfagular** (10): WHAT THE FUCK ARE PERFECT PLACES ANYWAY?

**stansymash** (10): am i lame because i pretend to cock a shotgun every time that bit before the chorus comes on. i mean, i'll stop everything im doing to cock that shotgun, whether people are around me or not. its important.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): This song is a phenomenal way to end the album! It recaps everything from heartbreak to reminiscence, and mentions that we're not all perfect.

**Tedyonce** (10): one of lorde's best ever

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3gxwIqqzB4

**theNealCutter** (10): it's probably the few album closers that makes me cry everytime. it's the feeling of being so fucking broken, you just give up and try to have fun because you already know that you'll never have what you want any time soon. I'm honestly at a loss of words right now tbh.

**Verdantshade** (10): this is THE song that got me so hyped for melodrama. it shows how much she's changed since a world alone, and it fully embraces the teen lifestyle that lorde has spent so long ripping apart. we're young, why not enjoy ourselves? now that i listen to it a year later, it's a bit cheesy in how anthemic it is, but as cheesy as the lyrics are, they're still honest and relevant

**whatareblackhole** (10): Perfect album closer. Thank you, goddess, for this mood.

**WilsonJason** (10): WHAT THE FUCK ARE PERFECT SONGS ANYWAY

**Comments:**

**Leixander**: I overplayed this album in the first week and I just can't really enjoy it anymore. Still, one of the best albums of 2017.

**TragicKingdom1**: This album is a massive triumph for Lorde. It is not a small feat to perfectly craft a story while also serving bops and no filler. My favorite part is that there are just so many moments that stick with you-- this album is endlessly memed for a reason. Anyways, I really couldn't ask for more because this is just checks all of my boxes: variety (especially in tone), tells a story, lots of personality, catchy songwriting, Jack Antonoff production...I could go on. I currently like Pure Heroine a tad more but that could change in the future as I develop an even stronger emotional connection to this material. [Grade: A+]

**stansymash**: i'm supposed to be the white bread indie boy helping annie win, but we are popheads today (this is the best album of the decade, i literally have one of those signed prints of the album cover she did framed right next to me)

**Mudkip1**: once again these are my honest scores i've listened to these songs enough to be positive on this

**cloudbustingmp3**: this is probably gonna pull an Art Angels and sweep because people are just gonna dump a ton of 10s without giving the other albums a fair chance and i'm already at peace with it. absolutely love this album tho

**dirdbub**: white but like. the good kind of white

**amumumyspiritanimal**: Oh wow where do I start. I have waay too many things to say about Melodrama. First of all, it's my favorite album of all time so a perfect score is obvious lol, but besides that, I don't even have the English vocabulary to praise this album enough. Melodrama is not just an album, it's a study of human emotions basically, in the form of a vocal diary. Lorde went full autobiographical and wrote her honest feelings and thoughts into lyrical masterpieces. I literally can't comprehend how anyone can dislike this album, it's out of my limits and I'm not even over exaggerating. The album has no flaws. It's not too short nor too long, the tracks are in perfect order creating basically a perfect storyline, the production is Antonoff's finest so far, the lyrics hit every right spot, and the album is just so rich with emotions and diverse in sounds. It feels like a whole journey. Sometimes I have to restrain myself from listening to it because I know that I will have to go through the whole album at least two times and than each song at least like 3 times individually. I'm proud to say that I listened to this album over a thousand times in full length. I know it sounds weird and stupid but it's just musical perfection. I connected to it on a deeper level, and not only because it's perfect, but because it feels like I'm going through this current part of my life as the tracklist goes down(it sounds like something out of a sci-fi but it's kinda true). So anyways, I already overdid this comment and I'm sorry for it, but I just had to write this down somewhere because this album means so much to me I might go full crazy stalker on Lorde if her next album is at least half this good.

**Verdantshade**: this was my second favourite album of 2017. I came really late to the lorde hype train - I didn't get round to pure heroine until 2016 (thanks to a popheads rate), but I quickly fell in love with her, and I didn't have long to wait for melodrama. I think it's a step up from pure heroine in every way and I've fully accepted her as the lorde and saviour of my life.

**whatareblackhole**: When Lorde released Pure Heroine, I was a senior in high school. I was the same age as Lorde and was experiencing everything she sang about; and now, as a senior in college, I find myself intertwined in Lorde's world again with Melodrama. We all adore this album and we have reason to. It is a rare case to come across an artist that can write without condescension, writing to the feelings of her audience without crossing a boundary. It's a bittersweet feeling to be so close in age with such a talent, but I'm glad to know that someone out there psychically shares a journal with me.

**RandomHypnotica**: I tried my absolute best to not score all these tracks with a 10 I promise.

**shineflyer**: it's called melodrama because that's what all the reviews of the album are.

**Marshynarsh**: My second favourite album of 2017 and a solid follow up to Pure Heroine. I love the themes and industrial production throughout the album

**specfagular**: my favorite album in the rate and possibly my favorite album of 2017. This album from front to back is beautiful. We truly don't deserve it.

**OriginalKappa**: Melodrama was the best album of 2017. I rarely encounter an album that after only 2 listens I knew and had opinions on pretty much every song. So many good moments!!!

**banananaise**: tbh i was totally on the melodrama hype train at first, but i nostalgically listened to Pure Heroine a few weeks ago and realised how much better it is compared to Melorama

**RandomRocketKat**: We're here for this, time for a bop of an album

**cyborglilith**: it's soooo moody in general but you can listen to it at any time because it's half bops and half mood

**enecks**: FUCK YES. A modern pop classic

**Elitefourbrad**: The most overrated album of the year from 2017.

**HalfAlienRobot**: This rate is really hard for me as a Halsey stan because I think Lorde had the better album last year. :(

**theburningundead**: I could say so much about this album but I think it really speaks for itself. While the songs themselves are hard to fault, they really come together perfectly as an album which is constructed so beautifully and feels, in the best way I can describe it, like a cinematic journey. Pure Heroine will forever hold a special place in my heart but Melodrama just feels so cohesive and impactful as a complete work. I'm so proud of how far she's come since releasing The Love Club down here in New Zealand, I have no doubt I'll be coming back to this album for years and I can't wait to see what she does next.

**nooodisaster**: Ok first of all I'm gonna write an essay for every song on this album and if that's a problem let me know and I will shorten it and send it back to you because I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY. Second this album is the best album of 2017 and arguably this decade so far, and top 3 in my favorite albums of all time. So it's 11/10, full stop, and nothing will change that. Third I saw Lorde in concert a week ago so that will affect my scores on songs slightly. Fourth and final, even though I'm a Lorde stan, I will try my hardest to rate each song honestly and provide explanation for every one. Thank you. (Fifth its highkey fucked up i cant give all of these songs an 11 lmao)

deleted: **patronsaintofaspies**: Definitely the biggest release of 2017 until Reputation, with the possible exception of Rainbow. I respected Pure Heroine a lot, but this is just that much of a good album for me compared to Lorde's previous style of minimalism. I'm very interested to see where Lorde will go next and I'm glad I got on her hype train because of this album. I'm also looking forward to seeing how it will influence alternative pop in the coming years. Everything about this is just very good, from the cover to the end of Perfect Places. And, one last note: I'm disappointed Needle Drop didn't give this album a low score, because I wanted to call that fiasco Melondrama.

**swadadu**: On my first listen this album was a 7.5, but now it is an 11. It makes me miss a relationship I wasn't a part of.

**melodyllic\_**: what can i say about melodrama that's not been said before? we've had powerful pieces of literature from popheads members and critics, and witty comments that surpass anything i could ever write. but to me, the most inspiring thing about melodrama is its ability to tell a complete, cohesive story. from the rebellion of 'green light' to the celebration of 'perfect places' we get a full, unadulterated spectrum of lorde's emotions, that is rarely found in literature, yet alone a pop album. if i had to paint melodrama (not including the brilliant album artwork), it would be a slowly changing shade of one colour, encompassing lights and darks, swirls and stripes, dots and lines to great effect.

**theNealCutter**: I probably listened to this album more than I should have. I've had my first breakup a few months after this album was released, and although I love this album then, it's quite surreal to witness yourself revelling in pain and listening to an album who talks about the same shit you've been through recently.

**robbiec\_**: (8.5) technically my average works out at seven point two but it's much better than that, it has some of the best songs of the year but as a project it's better has a while (and minus HMD Remix)

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: i don't really want this to have the absolute domination it's going to have but it's not like i'm not helping it dominate either lol

**natsby**: I have so many feelings about this album. I liked Lorde a lot after Pure Heroine, but I wasn't obsessed with her. When this album came out, I downloaded it without really expecting anything. I had a listen and this is, somehow, now my all-time most favourite album. I love how precise it is. It feels like an actual concept album that manages to take its time whilst being so compact and perfectly formed. This new Lorde sound is such a fantastic blend of unique and interesting musical choices with trendy pop elements. It feels so daring and fresh, yet so comfortable in its skin and inviting. I love this album so much, it took a concentrated effort not to just give every track 10. Melordedrama forever <33333

**twat\_brained**: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/375739961376505857/421731535335456773/unknown.png

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: I wasn't impressed by this album when it came out. After hearing this again for the rate, I came to apperciate the album a lot more. I remember someone said that Pure Heroine was an album made for high schoolers and Melodrama is an album made for college students and I could not agree more with that. I still prefer PH because it's more cohesive but Melodrama definitely deserves the love it gets.

**rickikardashian**: Rating this was hell, not because i dont like the album, but because i didnt want to seem the living embodiment of r/popheadscirclejerk. Realistically, I would have given more tracks 10's, but i think the scores I gave are fair enough

**WELL**

**WELL**

**WELL**

Your bitch did it. In classic Slumber Party fashion, Los Ageless started in first place with the first set of scores, and it never left the top. I thought this would just be an early on peak, but Los Ageless kept a fucking perfect score for three weeks. Literally a 10.0+ into the second week of March. 

How did this happen? It's 11s/10s aren't even extraordinarily huge. 

Well, other than a lone 3, the next lowest scores were a couple of 5s. The song was extraordinarily uncontroversial. 

--- 

**AND NOT LOSE YOUR MIIIIIIIINDDDD**
---

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): from the whooping intro to the menacing bridge, this song is peak Annie. the way the chorus builds up lyrically is absolutely sublime, and the way the production grows with little flourishes until exploding in raw power during the bridge is amazing. the outro is probably gonna turn people off, but it's absolutely essential. "i try to write you a love song but it comes out a lament" is devastating and incredibly effective

**Mudkip1** (11): hello Hello Are you in sunny California jes Did you sleep jes How's it going? eh were in the restaurant You're in Los Ageless See what I did there I made a St Vincent reference

**serried** (11): ok this is just FLAWLESS. the chorus is so strong i don't evenknow what the lyrics mean but she totally snapped

**shineflyer** (11): This song is honestly on another plane of existance. It was basically always going to be my eleven. That guitar breakdown is in my bloodstream, I swear.

**skargardin** (11): This was the track that introduced me to St. Vincent and I was honestly instantly blown away. Los Ageless is fantastic in every sense of the word and one of my favorite songs from last year.

**1998tweety** (10): After a bit of a lukewarm start, its nice to get to a song that captures me off the first note. The beat is loud and driving but doesnt drown out Annie's vocals. I've noticed a thing with Annie that here chorus' are almost always the weakest parts of her songs. In the verses shes allowed to spend her time creating this beautiful metaphors, but she has to resort to repetition in her chorus. This song does it a bit better than her others though. The lyrics change slightly and the meaning is easy for the listener to pick up on. The highlight is easily the bridge, the guitars are perfect here and Annie's scream singing layers on top really well. The final chorus builds up well, something you'd expect from a song your wanted to market as a single. I don't know exactly how to feel about the spoken word outro. The single version of this track stands well on its own, but I don't feel as though this outro takes much away from the track. Imo its a bit too long, but it being there flows well into the next song. My favourite line from this track is, "In Los Ageless, the mothers milk their young", and the reason for that is because it has multiple meanings packed into it. The first is the obvious one, mothers are milking their kids for all the money they can get out of them; it's a twist because mothers are supposed to milk themselves and provide milk for their children. Stop me if I'm reading into this a bit too much, but it also sounds like it can be taken in a sexual way. I'm sure we all know of the abuse some children and teenagers suffer in Hollywood, so this line could be referring to that.

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (10): Probably my favorite from the album.

**cucumberanti** (10): The production is god tier, the beat is so sexy omg. I love the bridge and the slow, long, sad outro.

**cyborglilith** (10): The beat is generic but makes me feel like a bad bitch. The chorus's production slays. The spoken outro is a good cool-down after hearing such deep lyrics, in which you can hear even more deep lyrics that make you contemplate whether or not you deserve happiness.

**dirdbub** (10): honestly this is an extreme mood

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): If there is a song in this album that perfectly summarizes how crazy the record is, Los Ageless is that song.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): I haven't listened to any other albums from Annie, but I'm convinced this is her best song of all time.

**enecks** (10): What a great song - using glossy pop and disturbing imagery to create a Lynchian cross section of Hollywood vapidity that still has killer groove and a lot of swagger.

**gannade** (10): A bop and a half

**InfernalSolstice** (10): slams hard

**kappyko** (10): werk

**Leixander** (10): HOW CAN ANYBODY HAVE YOU? HOW CAN ANYBODY HAVE YOU LOSE YOU? HOW CAN ANYBODY HAVE YOU LOSE YOU NOT LOSE THEIR MINDS TOO? Just amazing.

**m4ttycool** (10): lmao "How can anybody have you and lose you?"

**mokitsu** (10): By far my favorite song in this record. It's fun, agressive, and smart.

**MrSwearword** (10): I wasn't kind to the music video when I reviewed it in Jukebox, but this song on its own fucking slays

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): ┴pƎԀԀ∀NS ƎINN∀

**RandomRocketKat** (10): idk what to say here this song is playing im just so overwhelmed :wig:

**rotating3Dtext** (10): this is overwhelming in a good way

**SkyBlade79** (10): amazing chorus that balances out the bad verses almost completely except "mothers milk their young". She gotta turn up her vocals at the end tho… still, the chorus is good enough to really erase the negatives

**specfagular** (10): HOW CAN ANYBODY HAVE YOU AND LOSE YOU AND NOT LOSE THEIR MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIND

**stansymash** (10): that chorus makes me tingle with glee

**strawberryswing1** (10): this song is a 10 by itself but that outro is godly. if my lorde wasn't in this rate this would be my 11.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is the chorus of the year for real, the way it changes throughout the entire song is just magic.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): whew... the chorus of this is the best thing of hers here

**theNealCutter** (10): The addicting feeling of a place where everything is free, but also bad for you makes you run in circles wondering what is happening to you. The realization of loving something who hides a dark side one of the most haunting hooks I've heard this year.

**therokinrolla** (10): i hope this song slumber party's

**TragicKingdom1** (10): Simple yet mesmerizing. I've had this on loops for hours at a time.

**twat\_brained** (10): This is easily the best song on the album and I can see it sneaking its way into the top 5.

**Verdantshade** (10): the live versions of this song are fantastic. the sterile imagery and sound and the manufactured feel of what is a very raw song on heartbreak fit together perfectly

**VodkaInsipido** (10): invented being lesbian

**whatareblackhole** (10): This is DRAMA, this is ART, this is the end of Act I of the next big pop opera!

deleted: **melodyllic\_** (9.5): a prime example of annie's slightly bonkers alt-pop, and something i hope she continues for a long time. i love the use of motifs that are repeated throughout the album

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): Pretty amazing track. I'm a mystery writer and I can easily see this being the theme song of a crime series that happens in the middle of a city. While the entire song is awesome, the 'how can anybody have you and lose you?' section elevates it from being great to being outstanding.

**robbiec\_** (9.5): this would be a perfect 10 if it wasn't for the long outro which gets in the way of my shower time

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): that hook is just the stickiest fucking thing ever

**ulikejazz** (9.5): The outro <333

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): queen of major american cities

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): Who let Goldfrapp and King Crimson into the studio? St. Vincent obviously did because this is electronic rock at its finest.

**technoprayers** (9): , very upbeat track

**vayyiqra** (9): funky bop

**nooodisaster** (8.5): As someone who lives in LA, the verses honestly are spilling tea, and before it gets too satirical, the chorus comes in with much needed humanism.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): The hook on this song would be at least an 8 on its own. It's that good.

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: If you have to ask, I prefer Perfect Places over Los Ageless but I gave both songs a 10. It was satisfying to see that St. Vincent won over Lorde for the dirty she did to Lana and Halsey lmao.

Anyway, I already closed my plug.dj tab but i just wanna say thank you /u/wailordfan_ and /u/Piccprincess for hosing an entertaining rate!
