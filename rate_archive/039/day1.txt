[Rate] The 2017 Alt-Pop Rate Reveal - Day 1: "I watched her career dissolve and it fascinated me"
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/8c1aaw/rate_the_2017_altpop_rate_reveal_day_1_i_watched/

2017 saw some of the most interesting and critically acclaimed alternative pop albums of recent times, with albums like Melodrama, Masseduction, Hopeless Fountain Kingdom, and Lust for Life achieving positive and well received criticisms from critics alike. 

(Only one of them has spawned a top 10 hit though, but I won't go [there](https://giphy.com/gifs/jenner-twitter-DSOh0Wgvhzkn6))

BrokenGlassSparkling: Honestly, I’m happy with Masseduction, Melodrama or Lust For Life being the big winners. Sadly, I think Day 1 is going to be a Masseduction listening party, even though another album deserves to be largely gotten rid of today. I hope there weren’t of people who tried to sabotage Melodrama, but even if there were I’ll be happy if that leads to victory for LFL.

**WilsonJason** (5): dont worry quavos up next to completely ruin the entire album 
--- 

--- 

Sitting in the middle of the album, Halsey's second interlude in Hopeless Fountain Kingdom is our first victim in the Alt-Pop rate. 

A mixed bag, mainly taken up by a slightly distorted monologue of a child, with the haunting and repetitive lines from Halsey, the interlude forces the idea of a concept in the album, while mostly serving as a production interlude into Lie. It's cute, and the transition into Lie is top notch, but the content of the interlude doesn't really deserve to go any futher than the bottom. 

Do notice that the average is sitting above a 5.0. This is a major recovery, hitting a slump around a 4.6 at one point. 

**Literally gave it a 10 out of sarcasm**
--- 

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I don't know why interludes are included but I am going to give it a 10 anyway.

**Mudkip1** (10): wow just beautiful i love halsey she should make more music like this
 
**stansymash** (10): ohmy god this is funny she actually named a song 'good mourning'. good mourning. and that spoken word bit? brilliant. this is so tone deaf its genius. easy 10
 
**Literally loved this song/interlude**
--- 

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): soft aesthetic as well
 
**CarlieScion** (10): I got a tattoo based off of this song
 
**cyborglilith** (10): shooketh
  
**dropthehammer11** (10): SUN IS COMING UP OWHYOWHYOWHY

**Forced Concept**
--- 

**RandomRocketKat** (4): does the concept start here?

**skargardin** (4): I'm sure of that this ties into the concept in some way, but if you're not invested in the story it just kind of loses its point much like the intro.
 
**Verdantshade** (5): yikes why does halsey have to add these interludes to force the idea of a concept album
 
**natsby** (5): the first half is interesting, the second half is as well but also really unpleasant. i appreciate how it actually follows the fucking concept of this so-called concept album but it's not very nuanced or well done?
 
**Raykel** (6): She's reeeaaally trying to glue this concept together.


**WOW Interlude of the year/cute interlude, nice interlude**
---

**HalfAlienRobot** (9.9): underated interlude.
 
**VodkaInsipido** (9): best interlude of 2017
 
**melodyllic\_** (8): a really interesting little interlude! i wish they had included a full version of this track instead of 'don't play' or 'lie'
 
**lady\_sable** (7.5): ngl this is a pretty cool interlude
 
**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): A nice little interlude! It's only 1:08 so it's nice for what it is.
 
**jimmy345960** (7): i like this better than prologue and its kinda cool
 
**Holy Shit WTF Mess Yikes :sis:**
---

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): what
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6): that certainly was an interlude
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): what is this Melanie Martinez bullshit
 
**vayyiqra** (6): wtf is this creepy shit
 
**1998tweety** (5): Okay the worst thing about this album is that you can go from an amazing run like Alone-Now or Never-Sorry to this. The monologue is a bit better than the first one, but again I really don't like the sung part afterward.
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (5): again lmfao WHY
 
**banananaise** (5): i hate this song name
 
**followingfreeways** (5): this song stresses me out
 
**kappyko** (5): why oh why oh why oh why oh why oh why the rest of this album betteeeer be good..... uh did I just hear quavo
 
**nickl00** (5): I think I'm just gonna give these interludes 5s from now on
 
**serried** (5): quirky i guess, why is this on the rate?
 
**technoprayers** (5): , another interlude but I prefer this one
 
**theNealCutter** (5): so we see a change of pace. Halsey starts again, now it's with a new lover, new place. Iirc, there are two factions in the story (which ffs, she forgot to include in the album and only explained in her socials). One for the Moon, and another for the Sun. It's pretty much filler.
 
**cucumberanti** (4): I really can't take any of the spoken word interludes on this album seriously lol.
 
**didney-worl** (4): oh dear
 
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (4): Really creepy, but not in a good way. Instead of being inexplicably drawn to it I just want to turn it off.
 
**nooodisaster** (4): The brother's monologue is unintentionally hilarious.

**SkyBlade79** (4): a bit creepy but go off 

**These Drags Go Harder**
--- 
 
**dirdbub** (3.5): the clock ticking is Zedd's thing @Lido
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (3): eh this can go
 
**BrokenGlassSparkling** (3): I don't like these Interlude things, especially with Halsey because it seems like she's trying hard to be "artistic" while not succeeding.
 
**enecks** (3): Lol this is some twee nonsense fucc off go back to Shakespeare
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (3): Yes, Halsey, I, too, sometimes struggle to reach my daily word count. The solution to that is to take a one-day break each week to refresh yourself, not to write terribly just to meet it.
 
**Piccprincess** (3): M83 did this better
 
**Solovrinne** (3): These short songs do not belong on the album
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): This is literally Great Value Raconte-Moi Histoire
 
**whatareblackhole** (3): ThErE's a pLaCe WhEre LoVe ConQuErs aLL!
 
**twat\_brained** (2.4): This just seemed unnecessary and cringy to me the first time I heard it.
 
**chipsi1** (2): this is even worse than the first interlude what is she doing? how does this even connect to the rest of the album or to the first interlude? why did she think we needed to hear this?
 
**specfagular** (2): no. I like the transition into lie. That's it.
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (2): literally ashley stop it
 
**ulikejazz** (2): ugh no
 
**awryj** (1): oh my god is this thing REALLY called "good mourning"??
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (1): lmao
 
**MrSwearword** (1): is it dedicated to those live vocals of hers? BYE
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (1): The concept does not work on any level stop trying
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): haha good mourning how halseyish
 
**theburningundead** (1): let's just say I wouldn't mourn this if it wasn't on the album
 
**fourchip** (0): this is the most irritating interlude i have ever seen

I'm also part of the minority that thinks parts of this song worked REALLY well. Halsey's verse and delivery worked really well for me and I enjoy the production a lot, but like a few of you, a certain feature tanked the song for me. 

Quavo's part was just a mess. The inconsistent production, shitty lyrics, and terrible transition into his verse, this is a huge example of PR within an album, and the expectance of a hit due to star power. 

Unfortunately, a song needs to be remotely listenable to work. 

--- 

**Goes off, regardless of bad lyrics/production/features**
--- 

**dropthehammer11** (10): OKAY IM TIRED OF YOU GUYS DISRESPECTING THIS SONG JUST BC IT HAS QUAVO ITS REALLY GOOD AND DOESNT OVERSTAY ITS WELCOME. DO YOU PEONS EVEN HEAR HALSEY'S PART ON THIS? SEX TO EARS
 
**fuckupsomecommasyeah** (10): this song is the best mess
 
**MashLuke** (10): why isn't this longer, Ashley!? I need answers
 
**HalfAlienRobot** (9.9): Whenever I hear this song I think back to Halsey talking about it in a video clip on twitter, saying how she wrote this in this large room on a grand piano with her ex, and she was singing "If you don't love me, then lie" and hearing the words echo back to her. It always makes me want to cry. Honestly if it weren't for the Quavo feature, this would be a 10. Also, this line: "I give you the messiest head. You give me the messiest head." am I the only one who thinks that's an incredible line.
 
**cyborglilith** (9): actually good
 
**InfernalSolstice** (9): a solo halsey version would be a 10
 
**nooodisaster** (9): Yes it has some cringe-y lyrics, yes it has Quavo, yes it's a glorified intro, but SHE SAYS "LIE" SO AWESOME. Also, "All I'm saying is if you don't love me no more/Lie" is killer.
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (8): the transition is nice but quavo ruins it for me
 

**fourchip** (8): quavo's verse goes off stay pressedT
 
**rickikardashian** (7.8): this sampled the opening music from untucked
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): there is one popstar in this song and his name is not halsey
 
**nickl00** (7): I wish it was longer
 
**technoprayers** (7): , underwhelming at the least
 
**twat\_brained** (7): ighevyouthamhessiastheaa Halsey needs to improve her enunciation on the first verse. Also does this song even need Quavo? They could've kept the rap verse and at least got a better rapper on it. It's not even that the song is that bad, either. It just feels like it could be executed so much better.
 
**1998tweety** (6.8): I remember really not liking this song at first. I'm still not a huge fan of it, but I don't hate it as much. Halsey does a weird spoken word/rapping thing and I don't know how to feel about it. On one hand I think its cool that shes trying different things, but on the other I don't know if this sounds good or not. Unlike most, I actually don't mind the Quavo feature, he mimics the lines the same way Halsey does and it doesn't sound awful.
 

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): honestly i like the vibe but i prefer this version https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSSWDg6eZ1c
 
**Leixander** (6): good transition but the rest of the song doesn't hold up
 
**SkyBlade79** (6): I like it other than all of the head talk
 
**theNealCutter** (6): so... who's the new guy? Is it still the King? wtf Halsey? I am confusion. Anywho. It's the kind of song where it just builds and then end before it gets interesting. Quavo's here for no reason except repeat just what Halsey said in the first verse.
 
**Wow, Trash was Served**
---

**survivorjdmarina** (5.5): Besides the choice of a feature, Halsey's delivery of the song is so obscure lmao.
 
**Solovrinne** (5): Obnoxious

**robbiec\_** (4): i would give both of them the messiest head
 
**stansymash** (4): wow
 
**VodkaInsipido** (4): still bad
 

**RandomRocketKat** (3.5): no thanks
 
 
**cucumberanti** (3): Putting this in between 2 interludes is definitely… a choice. The really grand airy production when she sings lieeeeeeeeeeeeeeee over and over again is the best part of the song imo.
 

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): What on earth is this Halsey. These vocals effects, the Quavo feature, and instrumental just… I am the rare pophead that likes Migos but Quaco just does not deserve to be here. Like, what is this? Literally what is this
 
**ulikejazz** (3): I watch you devour/Mistake me for bread/Well boy, is you fed? is just so incredibly off-putting and cringey sorry Halsey
 

**cloudbustingmp3** (1.7): this song made me go back to Alone and raise my score because it keeps getting better in comparison to the rest of this album the further i go
 

**m4ttycool** (1): no

**RandomHypnotica** (1): This song is genuinely revolting. YUCK
 

**Verdantshade** (1): jesus christ what was she even trying to do
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (0): yes im giving my 11 and 0 to the same album. why. why. why. is this song a thing. it is literally so lifeless and awful and unlistenable. nothing happens. i don't think ive ever heard a more underwhelming song in my life
 
**awryj** (0): I wish I could unhear that
 
**dirdbub** (0): atrocious is a light word for this
 

**kappyko** (0): what the hell this album was so good for a while
 

**WilsonJason** (0): my ears are now in pain. 

**Quavo is Trash Gang**
--- 

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): The song loses one point for that unnecessary Quavo verse.
 
**CarlieScion** (7): A trash feature, but I love the transition from Good Mourning into this
 
**enecks** (7): This is solid but why is most of this a Quavo verse?
 
**MrSwearword** (7): only because for the crass but poignant line about her songwriting process, "I GAVE YOU THE MESSIEST HEAD". Also, Quavo can go to hell

**vayyiqra** (7): good except for Quavo's part

**serried** (5): homophobe
 
**melodyllic\_** (6.5): quavo whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
 
**skargardin** (6.5): Quavo!
 

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): This sounds like five different songs mushed together. Plus, Qauvo.
 
**FranklyTheTurtle** (5): this could have been amazing but Quavo ruins this

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): i mean ignoring the pointless and pretty annoying quavo feature what the fuck was that first verse about breakfast and bread lgsdfjhldfsg
 
**chipsi1** (4): okay this is awful but can i just say that the Quavo appearance had me in tears? like, Halsey's basically about to break down and then Quavo comes in with this: I heard what you said (what she say?) / You talk about your head game (oh) / I know that it's fire flame (fire) / Your mouth make a hurricane (splash). Like... did she even listen to the verse before putting it in the song? anyways, it's probably the most interesting part about this song, which does say something about the song itself :eyes:
 
**OriginalKappa** (4): Why is quavo on this? Is it because they had too many interludes and needed to make one an actual song
 
**Piccprincess** (4): I hate Quavo
 
**whatareblackhole** (4): I hate Quavo, and this song is so weirdly short, and talks so much about giving head? Like this weirdly cinematic orchestral arrangement was just stuffed into a song that doesn't even hit two and a half minutes…


**BrokenGlassSparkling** (3): Ehh... no. Why is Quavo here?

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): quavo was boring but also so is halsey

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (1): what is Quavo even doing there, just a terrible song all around
 
**natsby** (2): this would be better without quavo

**specfagular** (1): Quavo sounds terrible as always. Nah but I really hate this

**Elitefourbrad** (0): Quavo is disgusting

**patronsaintofaspies** (0): Why is Quavo on an alternative album? I'm not going to comment on how ethical putting him on a song is, but Halsey markets herself as some woke, progressive LGBT icon, which she is in some aspects, to be fair. She isn't even friends with Quavo or anything, so I have no idea why he's here. It seems so hypocritical! If you carry a set of beliefs that have a clear stance on an action, then you should follow them, even if it's just for PR. The song itself isn't very memorable at all. There's really no reason for this to exist.

**Leixander (7): what is this /u/infernalsolstice**
--- 

---

Had the album followed a trend/mild concept, this would've worked really well, and it at least sets a tone, but it doesn't really add anything to the album in the long run. Sonically it isn't *bad*, and could've been a great opener, but it was directionless out of the gun.

--- 

**Is This Promo for A Different Rate????**
--- 

**VodkaInsipido** (5): In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth For what it's worth, I think that he might've created you first Just my opinion Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to Every day and every night

---  

**Hm…** 
---

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I don't know why this is included in the rate but I'll give it a 10.

**Actual Praise for the Song**
---

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): has all the potential to be a cheesy mess but it's not
 
**InfernalSolstice** (10): is she pretentious reading shakespeare? maybe. does it make me instantly orgasm? yes
 
**Tedyonce** (10): I actually love this. The vocal editing is GORGEOUS, and the lyrics are solid.
 
**HalfAlienRobot** (9.6): i can't believe Halsey invented Shakespeare
 
**ulikejazz** (9.5): The monologue is bit melodramatic, but those vocoder harmonies thooo
 
**enecks** (9): Dang this intro is powerful. I don't care if quoting Shakespeare is a basic way to seem more important then you are, this is effective mood setting
 
**RandomHypnotica** (9): I'm a massive sucker for Vocoder so I enjoy this song way more than I should lol
 
**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): honestly that was very cool. i mean it's pretty fake deep but still cool every album should open like this
 
**fourchip** (8.5): william shakespeare found powdered wigless
 
**CarlieScion** (8): A concept album™ intro 🍵
 
**MashLuke** (8): I mean it's cool but how high can this be rated?
 
**Mudkip1** (8): was gonna give this a 1 since it's just spoken word at the beginning but the vocal processing at the end was cool and reminded me of Imogen Heap
 
**shineflyer** (8): The monologue-ing's obnoxious, but those Imogen Heap-style electronic chords go IN.
 
**lady\_sable** (7): this is so extra lmao but i was shook when i first heard it so. and the little song at the end is nice.
 
**natsby** (7): it's cheesy but I like spoken-word/artsy concept bits in albums.
 
**poppinmmolly** (7): a nice prologue for Romeo and Juliet but this album really does not fit the Romeo and Juliet theme at all.
 
**robbiec\_** (7): I love Medulla by Björk also Halsey has a great reading voice I could listen to her talk about avocadees for hours
 
**serried** (7): i bop my ass to this before work every morning!
 
**At least it has *insert topic here* in it**
---

**Raykel** (6.5): I mean like the reading is a little extra for an album that failed its concept but at least the production is ok.
 
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): The lady doth use a bit too much vocoder, me thinks
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): me when my 9th grade english class starts romeo and juliet and the teacher asks me to read from the textbook
 
**vayyiqra** (6): mildly cringey
 
**whatareblackhole** (6): I thought the reading of the beginning of Romeo and Juliet was kind of lame, but I liked the Imogen Heap ending
 
**RandomRocketKat** (5.5): omg why is the start so bad then the second bit so good.
 
**1998tweety** (5): So I guess this is the intro, I like the orchestral music during her monologue, but I do not care at all for the singing bit after. It just sounds very sharp and hurts my ears a bit.
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (5): lmfao WHY
 
**awryj** (5): I wonder if it's a vocoder or is it just Halsey's avocadosis
 
**banananaise** (5): boooo (but i'm kinda into the basic ass shakespeare quote)
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (5): lemme keep it cute
 
**kappyko** (5): this is music to pull hair out of your buttcrack to.
 
**letsallpoo** (5): mmm whatcha saaaaayyyyyy
 
**melodyllic\_** (5): ehhh, spoken word stuff just makes her seem more pretentious
 
**nickl00** (5): It's nice but not much there
 
**Now Kiss**
---

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): At least the vocoder part is cool
 
**static\_int\_husp** (5): I actually like the monologue, but the auto-tuned chanting is a bit of a turn off
 
**A Halsey Song? That Means We Have Some Roasts**
--- 

**survivorjdmarina** (5): This reeks of Tumblrcore, and I'm not living for it. That's all I have to say.
 
**theNealCutter** (5): why do we have to rate this? it's not bad it's just really unnecessary.
 
**twat\_brained** (5): I get the feeling the whole Romeo and Juliet concept is gonna have as much to with the play as "Witness" does with being "woke".

**nooodisaster** (4): gurl no matter how monologues you make us listen to this still isnt gonna be a concept album.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Romeo and Juliet is the most overrated Shakespeare play TBH. Also, this is supposed to set up the theme of HFK, but Halsey never follows up on it on this album at all. I actually think this album works better with a prologue, which is why I don't completely hate this, but I wish it was better.
 
**technoprayers** (4): , cute… I don't really do intros but I liked the Shakespeare recital
 
**chipsi1** (3): lol
 
**cucumberanti** (3): Halsey's already infamous for being fake edgy and this certainly doesn't help lol. I really like it past the 0:50 mark tho, wish she'd cut out everything before that.
 
**Elitefourbrad** (3): This is a little too edgy for me.
 
**jimmy345960** (3): what we are actually rating this? like i skip it and its unnecessary.
 
**m4ttycool** (3): what is this
 
**skargardin** (3): It paints a nice picture but it's basically useless since the concept gets completely lost somewhere throughout the album, at least for me. I wish that the concept had been much clearer.
 
**SkyBlade79** (2): such a disappointment that this is barely a concept album at all
 
**specfagular** (2): I hate fake deep spoken parts. Albums don't need prologues that are barely songs henny!!!
 
**stansymash** (2): oh my god even her speaking voice sounds like that????
 
**WilsonJason** (2): who let a 10 year old produce the vocals
 
**amumumyspiritanimal** (1): remember when we thought this would be a concept album?
 
**dirdbub** (1): welcome to my twisted mind
 
**followingfreeways** (1): we get it, you had to read Romeo and Juliet in your freshman year english class (I do not like when she starts singing)
 
**gannade** (1): Halsey please what is this
 
**MrSwearword** (1): gurl, get the fuck with this Romeo + Juliet wannabe shit
 
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (1): literally plagiarism
 
**Verdantshade** (1): holy shit I hate how pretentious this track is
 
**Marshynarsh** (0): Honestly I really dislike monologues on albums
 
**Solovrinne** (0): I hate it, this is not a movie, I never want to hear it again. This is how you completely throw off the rest of your album.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (0): To find, to find the exact words, to find the perfect words, to say less, but to say more, was ideal with this project, and till my energy and mind be felt, in a less aggressive way, but a more passive and genius way was ideal with this album, to show the versatility and to show th- to open minds in itself was the goal of this album, and to acquire a large amount of passion, and love and appreciation for myself was the goal of this album; loyalty to myself was the goal of this album. So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions; if you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. If you don't listen to the alternative sound and you've never been into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things; open your mind before you listen to this album. You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere. This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last. It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting, but discomforting at the same time. So, with this project, again, you're entering my mind, feeling my insanity, feeling my genius, my energy. Enjoy

**BECAUSE I SAID SO**
--- 

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I don't know why this is included but I'll give it a 10 anyways.

**Mudkip1** (10): idk why you're counting this as a song and not lumping it together with slow disco

**1998tweety** (8.9): It feels weird to rate this song since its less than a minute of instrumental. I like it though and I recognize that its just meant to be a transition between Young Lover and the rest of the album.

**OriginalKappa** (8.6): lol why is this in the rate. I've given it the average score of the tracks on this album for me to boost annie's chances of doing well

**dropthehammer11** (6): its cool but why are we rating this

**specfagular** (3): why?

**skargardin** (4): Listen, how am I supposed to rate this fairly? It's a beautiful instrumental piece that's a nice transition to the next track but does it warrant a score on par with the rest of the songs on the album? Absolutely not.

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (3): Not really sure how to rate it, it's a nice instrumental, I guess.

**nooodisaster** (1): Wait, are we seriously rating this as an individual track?? It's.. forty six seconds.

**theNealCutter** (1): why the fuck do we have to rate this?

--- 

Anyways. 

/u/piccprincess and I decided that all interludes will be rated. Sorry Annie, but this includes you too. Should've added an interesting element if you wanted to Intro the rate, but unfortunately Dancing with a Ghost departs to the afterlife four songs in. 

--- 

**Nice Try**
--- 

**twat\_brained** (10): What was the point of that? Actually, you know what? I'll give this a 10 to see if it Intros the rate lmao.

**awryj** (9): lets intro this shit

**I don't think anyone really gave this a serious positive score**
--- 

**chipsi1** (10): i wanted to give this my 11

**cyborglilith** (10): boo

**jimmy345960** (10): I love this. Absolutely

**kappyko** (10): did that


**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I love the lyrics in this song


**stansymash** (9.9): wow this song really holds the album together


**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): better than any halsey interlude anyway

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Where do I get a Lofi hip hop beats to relax/study remix of this track

**followingfreeways** (8): this is pretty

**swadadu** (7.5): Short, but pleasing.

**fourchip** (7): the only song on this album where i can't complain about annie's vocals so that's +5 points

**melodyllic\_** (7): did she just give me a track of nothing but sound? artpop queen sorry gags

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): WOW. That part in 2:11 is my SLUT drop anthem.

**survivorjdmarina** (6.5): wig

**serried** (6): honestly this song saved me from my depression. st vincent's vocals are so raw and powerful


**And here is the confusion**
---

**m4ttycool** (7): ok?


**nickl00** (7): I like it a little less

**static\_int\_husp** (7): erie

**vayyiqra** (7): nice atmosphere but too short to rate it higher

**whatareblackhole** (7): I think this is a nice transition after the pulsing anxiety of Young Lover

**RandomRocketKat** (6.5): I was SERIOUSLY tempted to give this my 11 just bc yknow

**rickikardashian** (6.5): yeah thats just like 40 seconds of violin


**enecks** (6): OK? I don't even know why this is in the album.

**Leixander** (6): a cute interlude but not really needed

**natsby** (6): it just sounds nice idk


**SkyBlade79** (6): I'm using this for my mixtape but okay

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): better than some songs in hopeless fountain kingdom

**VodkaInsipido** (5): u/bluehxrizon dance with me

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): The orchestral elements are really beautiful, but not enough to warrant one whole space on the tracklist. I can't see why this wasn't combined with Slow Disco. There's no need for this to be its own song-heck, the title is even in Slow Disco!

**technoprayers** (4): , an interlude that's just there

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): ok

**WilsonJason** (4): wow

**robbiec\_** (2): ??? this is a song like I came across this for the rate and didn't even realise this was on the tracklist and thought she had added it after release

**RandomHypnotica** (1.4): It may be a 40 second, barely there instrumental, but at least it didn't make me sick like other songs in this rate

**amumumyspiritanimal** (1): still better than the song Lust For Life sorry not sorry

**CarlieScion** (1): what was that?

**dirdbub** (1): I blame Jack Antonoff for this useless song

**MrSwearword** (1): OK this is quite literally pointless

**Solovrinne** (1): what the flying fuck is with interludes, they never leave me "wanting for more" or whatever the fuck their purpose is. They only make me thing "fuck this shit". Why not just put this at the front of Slow Disco.

**Verdantshade** (1): entirely unnecessary

**InfernalSolstice** (0): literally so uninteresting and pointless, why does this exist

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): depsite the hate for this song (we love a legend who compares her cocaine to cheese) it still goes off if ur drunk enough

**rickikardashian** (8.3): i just ignore the parmesan lyrics and it's an amazing song

**Verdantshade** (8): apart from being extremely cringey and the parmesan line, its pretty lit ngl. it could do without the outro though

**1998tweety** (7.2): This song suffers from having some of Halsey's worst lyrics (the iconic Parmesan line). I don't really like the outro at all.

**didney-worl** (7): PARMESAN


**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): w h i t e l i k e p a r m e s a n

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): i just can't get over the lyrics lmao

**enecks** (6): A messy bop? Parmesan, and that chorus hold it back from a 8.

**nooodisaster** (6): Literally ruined by ONE line. It'd be an 8 to 9, if not for "Got it all white like parmesan."

**theNealCutter** (6): she's moving on. I think. What happened? WTF HALSEY Y U NO COHESION? Overall, the song is weird. I'm not sure what she's trying to do with the weird 2000's-esque production. Apparently, it's a woman-empowerment anthem based on the outro. Also, "Got it all white like parmesan" is the Chinese Water Torture of this rate.
**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Some cool stuff happening here, but it alternates between being interesting and being hard to listen to. Funny story: I thought the 'white like Parmesan' line was just a cheesy (haha? get it) reference to being pale with fear, but somebody (hi, Luke) told me it was a reference to drugs. I facepalmed so hard.

**RandomHypnotica** (0): oh my god this song is SO bad, I think I actually shortened my life expectancy by listening to this. Y'all give Katy Perry shit for some pretty bad lyrics, but why is "Runnin' lines like a marathon, got it all white like parmesan" never ever brought up. That line was so hilariously bad I had to google the lyrics just to verify I heard it right and spent a good 5 minutes holding back laughter.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Under the Sea's hotter, sexier cousin. She's so vicious here, I love it.

**dropthehammer11** (10): holy fuck this song is literally so fucking lit like the production is incredible? if you dont like this you probably eat plain lettuce

**HalfAlienRobot** (10): production on this track is like, just. fuck. me. up.

**InfernalSolstice** (10): a huge bop don't @ me

**MashLuke** (10): the outro is so fucking good

**kappyko** (9.5): i like the instrumental OH FUCK THE DON'T PLAY WITH ME. that wheezing (?) sound serves PC Music

**SkyBlade79** (9.5): god, I hope this isn't robbed! It's fun, it makes you feel badass, has quotable lyrics…

**twat\_brained** (9.2): I wasn't looking forward to relistening to this because of Halsey's comparison of cocaine to cheese but aside from perhaps the production on the hook this is actually a fantastic deluxe cut! I'd love to hear this live if I see her on tour this summer.

**shineflyer** (5.5): the pre-chorus is SO nice, but the chorus it leads into is lacking.

**survivorjdmarina** (5.5): The lyrics wouldn't win a poetry contest, or come close to it, but the tropical beat is very good. Also, Halsey shouldn't really stick to rapping as her gig...

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (5): don't hurt yourself with that edge, sis

**Solovrinne** (5): Beat doesn't match the song IMO

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4.5): not gonna lie, the drop is pretty good, but this is so fucking cringeworthy. i could see rihanna or beyoncé make something similar work, but halsey doing this is a mistake.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): ew

**whatareblackhole** (3): WOOF. Is she Tybalt or Benvolio in this song? Are we still following the Romeo and Juliet storyline? Is this whole album a masturbatory attempt at #aesthetic?

**dirdbub** (2.5): cannot stop thinking about that post that says "Halsey sounds like she's inspired by white women whipping on Twitter"

**MrSwearword** (1): don't play what besides "this bullshit again"? "rapper braggin about St. Tropez"? Gurl...

**followingfreeways** (0): it's confirmed, Halsey's label wants her to flop considering they let her release this album with this embarrassment of a song on it. I'm seriously embarrassed for her

**stansymash** (0): oh no. ohhhhhhh noooo. don't do thaaaat 


**Bi-racial, but is very light-skinned, so idk???**

**robbiec\_** (8.3): in the history of wonky white girls saying motherfucker on a thin line between cringey and fun this is a good example of that. fun song though and the video game-like pling pling gets me going

The back half of HFK is so heavily dragged down by so many sub-par tracks, and Sia's lyricism here certainly didn't help. It was a drag, and a mess, beginning to end. The slight lyric change and *symbolism* sprinkled inside the last part of the song was interesting, but not enough to put it above some of the amazing content in the rate. 

--- 

**Weird Category of Good Score, but not really positive comment?**
--- 

**dropthehammer11** (10): Explosive, passionate track

**1998tweety** (9.6): I guess there was another Badlands reject. Well its a good thing that I loved Badlands and I especially love this song. This song is edgy, but IDGAF. I love it.

**CarlieScion** (8): Angel on fire/devil in me shouldve been a double feature

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): When I first heard the song when it came out, I thought this was the weakest song on the album. Listening to this now, I liked it a lot better. There were some obvious fingerprints from Sia but Halsey owned this song.

**theNealCutter** (8): it's nice. It shows a little bit of vulnerability.

**VodkaInsipido** (8): the powerful Halsey is the best Halsey

**kappyko** (7.5): For every time somebody comments "filler" on this song is another hour that i will have /u/letsallpoo banned

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Definitely the best bonus track, the rhythm here is as good as it is in Halsey's best songs and the bad production only brings it down slightly.

**cyborglilith** (7): boring filler

**enecks** (7): GOTTA WAKE UP GOTTA WAKE UP GOTTA WAKE UP

**MrSwearword** (7): I swear she did this better on Badlands, but at least she's consistent...maybe

**Solovrinne** (7): chorus is the only good part

**technoprayers** (7): , an upgrade from Angel On Fire

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): @what does it mean 

**Guess Who.**
--- 

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): sia lyrics

**Verdantshade** (8): a sia bop

**SkyBlade79** (7): sounds like a sia song which makes sense

**specfagular** (7): omg she didn't even try to hide that this was a Sia song. Sia should have kept it but Halsey does it some justice.

**didney-worl** (6.8): I immediately heard Sia all over this

**awryj** (6): obviously a sia song

**skargardin** (6): Another middle-of-the-road Sia song released in the couple of years.

**whatareblackhole** (5): This is also okay. I can tell it's a Sia song. Sounds like a deluxe track to me, but whatever.

**For a Song 'Devil in Me' I'd expect to feel something**
--- 

**melodyllic\_** (6.5): after so many trap-influenced songs, i cant listen to this without getting bored

**natsby** (6): i do like the rhythm of 'shine too bright/i burnt the candle'

**twat\_brained** (5.7): Never really been big on this one when I'd listen to it.

**RandomRocketKat** (5.5): hey padding how are u today sis?

**survivorjdmarina** (5): Eh... I have no comment.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): This sounds like every other Halsey song tbh

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): is this an imagine dragons reject

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (4): This one's made me doze off. Just thinking about it makes me snooze

**nooodisaster** (4): Badlands B-side, and we REALLY don't need that.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): this is now or never but even more halsey

**robbiec\_** (3): MORE FILLER

And just like that, another back half track is cut out. Admittedly, I preferred Devil in Me to this, mostly for production reasons, but the lyrics here are at least a bit less-Sia-y. 

It feels bad, but a 6.39 is probably the kind of score I'd give it, so, she got what she deserved? Maybe?

--- 

**Weave on Fire**
--- 

**dropthehammer11** (10): so fucking underrated

**lady\_sable** (10): big mood tbh

**m4ttycool** (10): best song here

**MrSwearword** (10): OK this slays in its own right

**1998tweety** (9.2): Okay this is definitely THE Badlands song. I would not be surprised at all if this was a reject from it. Her vocals even sound similar to the ones on Badlands. This track reminds me a lot of Control which happened to be one of my favourites from Badlands. Despite feeling a bit out of place on the album, I still like it and its probably one of my favourites on it.

**InfernalSolstice** (9): great on the album but this live is an EXPERIENCE

**cyborglilith** (8): wow

**Solovrinne** (8): goes hard. give me more halsey.


**Same, TBH**
--- 

**chipsi1** (7): okay i'm going to be honest I actually can't distinguish between Devil In Me and Angel On Fire, not even sonically, my mind just keeps confusing these two and every time I want to say something about one of them i just say angel on fire and hope i'm talking about the correct song

**Mediocrity on Fire**
--- 

**skargardin** (7): Pretty typical as far as Halsey songs go.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): one of those songs that you listen to once and you're like 'oh that was pretty good' and then you never feel like listening to again. the hook is pretty catchy though.

**Verdantshade** (7): it's alright but it doesn't bang like the rest of the album does

**WilsonJason** (7): I can't tell you no wrong. You know all my lies. You know just where it hurts. You see me in my eyes

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.4): honestly don't remember what this sounds like the second it's over but it's not a cringy mess so

**didney-worl** (6.2): wow angel and devil haha I get it. symbolism!

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): This should be more energetic. Right now it's just dragging the energy of the preceding tracks away.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): Hmmm...not feeling it. The chorus is good tho.

**enecks** (6): A lowkey track that when listening to the album mostly gives me Strangers aftershocks.

**melodyllic\_** (6): halsey reverts back to her angsty 'badlands' persona :((

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (6): This is the most Halsey song title ever

**survivorjdmarina** (6): The beat is promising. Overall, I have nothing else to say.

**technoprayers** (6): , mellow track

**theNealCutter** (6): so she's changed... because of what? Halsey you need to work on your storytelling here, I've been having problems in following your story since Alone. I'm not fond of the pitch manipulation of the chorus. I should like this, this is totally up my alley, but it's just not evoking any emotional response to me.

**whatareblackhole** (6): This is okay. I can tell it's a Greg Kurstin song. It's fine. This should have taken Devil In Me's place on the standard, but whatever.

**nickl00** (5): These Last Three are just meh and kinda forgettable

**nooodisaster** (5): gurl you've had ONE album, calm down about being over.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Don't like Halsey's vocal performance in here, and the chorus sounds more like a pout than anything else. The production in this is also disappointing.

**specfagular** (5): mediocre at best

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Wow I love James Patterson's Maximum Ride

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): angel on fire angel on fire but the world just stood aroundire 

**Angry and on Fire**

**dirdbub** (4.5): this is just annoying

**RandomRocketKat** (4.5): When you come to terms with the fact youre irrelevant

**robbiec\_** (4): more filler

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3.5): hahaha

**stansymash** (3.5): i am so bored of halsey's voice. it is bad and i also dont enjoy the things she says with this voice. they are bad.

**natsby** (3): it's not unpleasant but it's just another generic halsey song idk

**twat\_brained** (2.3): I would've preferred to have "Lie" as a deluxe track if it meant this didn't need to be on the tracklist.

**awryj** (2): is it just me or is badlands way better lyrically

**cucumberanti** (2): Halsey made this after listening to one (1) Evanescence song. Reminds me of Gasoline/Control except nowhere as good.

**Political Goddess**
--- 

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): hippie queen

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I really apperciate Lana shared her concerns for our generation right now when we are living in a divisive political climate. We definitley need a song like this right now.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): This song has drugs and smoking all over it, I love this song! The "stairway to heaven" is so beautifully constructed and sung.

**MrSwearword** (10): LIFE

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): I adore this song, FIGHT ME

**HalfAlienRobot** (9.9): I cried so hard the first time I listened to this song. I will always defend this song and its title. Because there's something really honest and vulnerable in making a song and a title like this. I can absolutely relate to romanticizing the shit out of Woodstock-- I mean that kind of thing is Lana Del Rey's whole image isn't it. This song really reminds me of being at Desert Trip, I remember wanting to go to a festival with all these old bands to maybe get a glimmer of what something like Woodstock would've been like. And I remember when Roger Waters was playing that last night and it was right before the election of '16, and in the midst of all the dancing and singing, there was imagery across the screens of apartheid, protests, and our presidential elect's racist and sexist quotes. Like so many years have passed, and the same political music that was relevant then is still relevant now. And just thinking, like, what can we do, trying to have hope for the first time in a while, and wanting to make an difference, thinking, at least we ought to try. Yeah, faux-deep, faux-woke, title it whatever, this is real life. And in this song, I just really feel what she feels.

**natsby** (9): I actually like this song. I've always been in the camp of 'Lana Del Rey is a postmodern persona' and just the very title of this fits so much. I like how it's unpolished, how the verses have shitty production and sound rushed, how the entire chorus is a lyrical rip-off. It all comes together and somehow feels so right and fitting, especially when she gets to the soaring/whistling notes of 'got a million ways...'

**Tedyonce** (9): Amazing. Perfect combo of old & new sound.

**kappyko** (8.5): title is sooooooo dumb but i actually love the sound of this outro is gorgeous. if the title was "Woodstock" people would like it more

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.1): does NOT deserve to be called Roachella!

**didney-worl** (8): very underrated

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): This one gets extra points for having variety in tone

**RandomRocketKat** (8): STAIRWAaAaY

**robbiec\_** (8): what I love most about this song is how tongue in cheek she is being and how she's fucking earned that after all the blog bashing she got at the start of her career. Like they WANT her to name a song Coachella or Woodstock so they can eat her and then she went and put both in the same song title

**rotating3Dtext** (8): the title and lyrics can seem kind of silly at first glance but i think she's coming from a genuine place here. i like the chorus and appreciate it doesn't contain the title

**skargardin** (8): I really, really don't get the hate for this song. It's so honest and showcases a different side of Lana that we haven't really heard of before.

**specfagular** (8): i was scared when she first previewed this song but it actually came out really nice!

**swadadu** (8): I do not understand the hate this song gets.

**whatareblackhole** (8): She really had that fever dream that made her a politician, huh

**twat\_brained** (7.8): I mean this one's a step above the previous ones but we need to cancel Coachella because its owner donates to anti-LGBT organizations

**lady\_sable** (7.5): everyone hates this song but...i like it...

**cucumberanti** (7): She'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven!!

**It's Fun Reading the Comments in Order, This Song suuuuper gradually becomes more and more negative**

**Marshynarsh** (7): while the title kind of sucks I always liked this one

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): This is a little clumsily put together compared to the rest of Lust For Life, and I can understand why some people would think it obnoxious, but I've grown used to hearing this in the middle of this record. One part I especially enjoy is the Stairway to Heaven reference.

**Solovrinne** (7): Not as bad as people say it is.

**survivorjdmarina** (7): Wow we love a woke queen, Katy can't compare. No but seriously, I think her vocals sound great on here, but the lyrics are, at times, almost obscure to be taken seriously as a political track.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The drums are a choice here, it just seems like a stock FL Studio drumkit and distracts me a lot

**vayyiqra** (7): not terrible

**VodkaInsipido** (7): hated at release, much better now

**melodyllic\_** (6.5): admirable how she's making a parody of herself as the pretentious, flower-in-hair Coachella girl, but the music isn't as self-aware

**SkyBlade79** (6.5): really not as bad as people say, it's woke partially

**stansymash** (6.5): you are the light, reader

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): sounds like it was made by a Lana del Rey Song Generator

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): what about all these chickens

**Verdantshade** (6): I distinctly remember lana saying this wouldn't be on the album... it's not the worst song on the album but the album would benefit from not having this tbh

**nooodisaster** (5.5): I remember the first time I listened to this I really liked it, but I feel like that was a dream because this song really is a mess lmao.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.5): out of all the lana del rey songs i have heard this is definitely one of them

**And Here we Hit a Corner, and the Tone Change hits Again**

**jimmy345960** (4.5): i really didn't like this one, it was too boring :/


**Leixander** (3): i just like to pretend this song doesn't exist thank you

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (3): this is sucha weird title and I'm confused why this is in the album since Lana said this was supposed to be a standalone single. Queen of misleading her fans.

**technoprayers** (3): , why is this on the album….

**dirdbub** (2.5): cannot think of a whiter song title

**therokinrolla** (2): This song is a mess and disgusting and I do not enjoy it I am sorry Lana.

**enecks** (1): Not only is this trap-influenced production not a good look (with some annoying children thrown in) but its politics are embarrassingly basic and trite. With Lana's fetishisation of the past, her attempted statement just does not work.

**ThatParanoidPenguin (4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dql8gOxv3Uw**
--- 


Wew lad, this has the highest controversy score of the rate. 

This song at one point was in the bottom 5, and tbh? It deserved. 

The song is kind of a great example of what procrastination results in. Everything is a mess, the vocal mixing, production, and the choices in features, the song is a jumbled up mess without a direction, and somehow made Post Malone the most enjoyable out of the 4 artists. 

--- 

**~~Delusional~~ Fans**
--- 

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (11): If I could give this one thousand points I would. Grades are up, face is clear, social life is amazing, and it's all thanks to this song. The original is good but put SZA on anything and it turns to gold. Khalid does great and Post turns in a rare decent performance.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): party bop, it shouldve gotten a music video with the whole song reenacted with the singers

**dropthehammer11** (10): OG is lorde's best song but this is better

**gannade** (10): The remix is an upgrade tbh

**MashLuke** (10): Post Malone stole the scene, sorry Ella

**nickl00** (10): SZA=automatic 10

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): what do you get when you put 4 main pop girls together? a fucking 10. duh. (low-key they should re-release this now that everything Posty touches turns to gold)

**cyborglilith** (9.5): Khalid's verse is horrible and never should have existed.

**jimmy345960** (9.4): This is nice, Post adds something amazing to this. I wish it was just Lorde, Post and Tove Lo. It would be fire then.

**OriginalKappa** (9.1): Too many people on one 3 minute song. Surprisingly Post has my favourite bit but the individual parts don't get much of a chance to gel well together. It's still the version I choose to listen to over the other though so I gave it .1 higher than the original

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I know the remix isn't very popular but I thought this one was very good and I definitely like the other perspectives being held in the same party Lorde was in, especially with SZA flirting with a guy who has a girlfriend subplot.

**ScottishWhore** (9): drop the khalid verse and add in the red and chrome verse and we got a cocktail

**SkyBlade79** (9): post Malone is lowkey sexy on this. But ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm where the fuck is tove

**theNealCutter** (9): i like this better. it's more dynamic and captures the fun more than the original.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): I don't get the hate! Obviously the loss of the "broken glass sparkling" verse is unfortunate but I feel like the addition of SZA and Post more than cancels that out.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): more than a remix this is a "song getting hijacked by other artists", but it's not bad!

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): I hate how, despite having the three biggest names in music right now, this never blew up. The possibilities...

**enecks** (8): A kinda messy remix, but we like anyway.

**Solovrinne** (8): Will be a smash hit in my heart.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): This song is... messy. It gets rid of some of my favorite parts of the original, and adds three different features. Switching between all of these voices makes it fell like way to much is going on. It still has the core of a great song, but It's eatered down enough to make it worse than anything on the album proper.

**stansymash** (7.9): I like the Lorde bits

**awryj** (7.8): why was this not successful

**Homemade Sparklers**
---

**dirdbub** (7.5): it ok

**CarlieScion** (7): Not as good as the original

**Marshynarsh** (7): I like it but I really miss the All the broken glass sparkling verse. I think that was a highlight of the original song

**melodyllic\_** (7): very conflicted about this track, bc i LOVE sza but dislike khalid's voice and hate post malone

**strawberryswing1** (7): This doesn't deserve to be rated with the perfection that is Melodrama! :triumph:

**swadadu** (7): Why is Post Malone the best part of the remix? They should have combined SZA and Khalid's verses into one verse and kept the broken glass verse.

**VodkaInsipido** (7): /u/fuckupsomecommasyeah would you

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): Really not a fan of this remix, just takes away from the original imo, and feels just like a desperate attempt to chart with everyone popular atm.

**cucumberanti** (6): It's not bad, but listening to it just makes me want to go back to the og Homemade Dynamite.

**skargardin** (6): This remix is not the tea. Too many cooks that don't mesh together that well. SZA's guest part is the best one but both Khalid and Post are forgettable. Also, one of the best lines on Melodrama gets robbed.

**technoprayers** (6): , A huge letdown

**vayyiqra** (6): why would you do this

**Verdantshade** (6): it doesn't even have the "painted on the road" verse, which is the best part of the song.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5.5): how the 3 hottest artists in music come together to make a pile of garbage is beyond me

**Literal Terrorism**
---

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (5): oh hey industry plant number one, industry plant number 2, washed out one hit wonder and xxxWidowMakerReaperTalonDidNothingWrongxxx

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (5): This was just meant to get a hit out of the era, and it failed because it's kinda messy. Not terrible, but not amazing.

**chipsi1** (5): i mean... okay

**fourchip** (5): no one asked for industry plant and his shitty beard to be on this

**MrSwearword** (5): this could've been worse than what it is.

**nooodisaster** (5): This song unfortunately feels less than the sum of it's parts. The lineup is insane, but the execution is 4 subpar verses and losing the best part of the song.

**RandomRocketKat** (5): Leaaaavvveeeeee youre messing up a good thing

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): i was sitting here bopping like normal until khalid came along and sounded like ass nnn; post and sza can stay i guess but like.... can i just listen to the original

**therokinrolla** (5): This is offensive because it takes my favorite song on Melodrama, one of my favorite songs of the year, and adds not 1, not 2, but 3 unnecessary features, two of which are not even close to being good.

**whatareblackhole** (5): Stop trying to make Khalid happen! He's not going to happen!

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Khalid is as bland as always, and I don't know if SZA's verse is bad or just not my thing. Strangely enough, I consider Post to be the best guest star here, but he's not very memorable in this remix, either. I'm sad this is a stain on one of Melodrama's best songs, NGL.

**Tedyonce** (4): disappointed. Post was great, but Khalid & SZA's slow delivery throw the song off SOOO much.

**twat\_brained** (4): I don't know who it was, but I saw someone say this song was akin to having too many cooks in the kitchen and that's all I can think of when I hear this. I think Khalid has the best guest verse here but that isn't saying much, honestly. It could have been salvaged if Lorde only featured Tove Lo like their Osheaga performance (you can read about that in Popheads Magazine) but this is little more than a cash grab.

**kappyko** (3.5): this is a disaster

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (3): a mess

**Raykel** (3): I just find it so funny that Post Malone is a better singer than Khalid.

**WilsonJason** (3): why was this a thing

**natsby** (2): I'm sorry but this is so unnecessary.

**specfagular** (2): this adds nothing and all the features just kinda make it sound way too messy. Hate Khalid's part and while SZA and Post aren't bad they add absolutely nothing to the song. There's no reason this remix should exist. Also fuck this remix for bringing down my album average for melodrama

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): this blows

**Elitefourbrad** (1): Khalid ruined this so badly that I can't even praise SZA and Post Malone.

**m4ttycool** (0): I really hate this

**robbiec\_** (0): right this song just does not sit right with me at all and it's not Lorde's fault. HD is a ten when it's just Lorde because I love the imagery of her being alone or with her friends just letting shit blow but in order to try and wring out a hit someone decided to go the remix route, probably the most desperate chartbait attempt of last year (some gems were created this way though e.g. Finesse) so they added the buzziest artists about and sadly one had to be Post, the biggest offender of chart tactics last year. SZA is wasted. Their harmonies are disappointing as well and a lot of my frustration comes from how good this could have been but it's just... eh

**NNNEEEEEEEEE-EEEE-EEEEE-EEE-EEEE-EEEDED ME**
--- 

**gannade** (10): It kinda is Needed Me redux but Needed Me is sooo good.

**Verdantshade** (8): apart from ripping off needed me, it's definitely grown on me since it came out - it's catchy af

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): It does sound too similar to Needed Me, but those two songs share a writer, so at least this is self-plagiarism? Definitely a grower, even if I'm not a huge fan of the music video at all. I like how chill this sounds, honestly.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Needed Me remains unbothered

**twat\_brained** (7): I never saw the "Needed Me" comparisons at first but since a year has passed it's starting to make more sense to me. Never would've went with this as the lead single when "Strangers" exists, though.

**cucumberanti** (6): Lyric wise reminds me a lot of Room 93. I get what kind of vibe she's going for but kind of wish the production doesn't sound so much like Needed Me.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): a second-rate "Needed Me" ripoff goodnight

**shineflyer** (6): needed me rip-off, yeah, wbk. but not a bad song to rip-off.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): We love rihanna

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfN4PVaOU5Q

**chipsi1** (5): what a unique way to state you stan Rihanna

**dirdbub** (4.5): the white version of "Needed Me"

**enecks** (4): Needed Me is the worst single from Anti, why would you rip it off and do it worse?

**jimmy345960** (2.5): this is a horrible knock-off of needed me. I hate every second of this boring mess of a song

**Elitefourbrad** (2): Needed Me rip off, seriously Halsey?

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): i still hate Needed Me

**Mudkip1** (0): rihanna

--- 

The song that shares a writer/producer with another song is dragged for being too similar. I'm just confused with dragging the song when it is the writer who decided to be lowkey lazy. 

The song has its faults, but it is a lot better than you guys rated it, and I will stick to that. 

--- 

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): i love this album because it really captured the feelings of change in me last year. each song represents a different time period from last year for me (this being spring), and it just really shows how much happened in the past 12 months. This song is amazing, and even though I know people will vote it out fast because "its a copy of Needed Me because the production is similar even though both songs had the same producer hurr durr" but this was really a big step forward for Halsey, and I stan this album hard(i just need to buy it finally lol)

**CarlieScion** (10): Deserved better

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I was good on my own / That's the way it was....

**dropthehammer11** (10): idc what anyone says, this was a fucking GREAT lead single

**kappyko** (10): this >>>>> bad at love. not sorry bout it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): people say this is generic or a rip off of needed me but IDGAF (from the album Dua Lipa, now available for purchase on iTunes) I think it's a fucking bop

**1998tweety** (9.7): You guys like to call this a Needed Me clone, but its different enough that I don't confuse the two. I was actually going through some weird times when this song came out. I whenever walking around my town to it, I remember listening to it to help me fall asleep (no shade), and it got me really hyped for the album.

**melodyllic\_** (9): again, another dark bop! what can i say, it's what she does best.

**nooodisaster** (9): I never got the comparison to "Work" besides that both songs were growers for me. That "Keep you arRrRrOooOunD forever" is heavenly.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): This song is such a vibe and I don't really know why. One of my biggest hot takes is that this is WAY better than Needed Me. It's strangely atmospheric and the stuttering vocals work much better to sell hopeless love than being a bad bitch.

**awryj** (8.5): im lowkey bopping to this

**luckyboot** (8): i don't even like halsey but this is catchy

**robbiec\_** (8): people say that her delivery doesn't match the lyrics but I like how it conveys that idea that this isn't the first time she has given someone an ultimatum to try and grasp the relationship but it's not working

**SkyBlade79** (8): Sounds nothing like Needed Me, especially because it's far better. Those ad libs give me life.

**RandomRocketKat** (7.5): decent bop

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): it kind of gets tiring

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): the weakest but still a bop nonetheless

**technoprayers** (7): , a cute song but overall sounds reductive

**vayyiqra** (7): alright

**skargardin** (6.5): I don't see the "Needed Me" comparisons tbh but even so it's pretty uneven.

**cyborglilith** (6): Starrah > Max Martin

**Raykel** (6): She can not do those runs. Yikes.

**serried** (6): who thought this was an okay lead...

**theNealCutter** (6): wait? is this a new person? Is Halsey talking about the King or did she meet a new person? I'm losing track of the story and I'm not even halfway. Anyway, another example of misplaced mood. Eyes Closed sounded angry when it should've been sad, Now Or Never on the other hand sounded bored when it should've been insisting, a little anxious. It feels underwritten, undeveloped.


**A Rich Queen**

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): i got new earbuds today this sounds cool



**Never Ever Ever or Never**
--- 

**VodkaInsipido** (6): tbh a boring first single, unimpressive overall

**survivorjdmarina** (4): Shouldn't have been the lead single when songs like Bad at Love and Strangers exist.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (2): Everytime they play this one the radio I skip it. Terrible single choice when there were so many better songs. Forgettable

**Solovrinne** (2): Sounds like the beat/melody and the lyrics have been awkwardly smooshed together. Moments where she tries to say 10 words a second just make me think why? slow it the fuck down.

**stansymash** (2): oh lord. oh dear.

**MrSwearword** (1): Simply put, NO

**nickl00** (1): Why was this the lead single and not Strangers???


**natsby** (0): generic chart-ish nonsense

**specfagular** (0): does this really deserve anything higher? This is terrible. Boring and the production is awful

**whatareblackhole** (0): Ugh, this song is so boring, I hate that it was a single.

I actually enjoyed this song. A super solid 8, and finally a track in this rate where the features actually work really well together. 

The song sometimes drags, and sometimes it just feels like it lacks the extra punch to really hit home. 

--- 

**Summer Bumper**
---

**cyborglilith** (10): The background wailing just makes this track

**natsby** (10): say what you want about her rap features, but this is my favourite song off the entire record. I love hip-hop Lana, I love moody Lana, I love lascivious summery Lana. This song is all that - it's like a musical translation of rich molten dark chocolate. It's like a sticky hot summer's day when you're drenched in someone else's sweat, but seen through sunglasses. love. (this would have gotten my 11 if not for hard feelings/loveless jsyk)

**robbiec\_** (10): god the day this dropped it was mid summer and it was fucking pouring but it was like really warm and it was the perfect weather for this to fuck me up

**SkyBlade79** (10): I LOVE hip hop lana and the ad-libs throughout the song make it so much better

**VodkaInsipido** (10): YUH

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): it's like a born to die song but actually good. the bridge is amazing and what Halsey & her stans thinks she does

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9.5): bop

**therokinrolla** (9.5): this song was awful first listen. I hated it. I said it was Lana del Rey's worst song ever. I lied. This song makes me wanna sway in the pale moonlight. It's effortless.

**Marshynarsh** (9): This one grew on my like crazy. I hated it the first couple of listens but I like how weird the production is and it has my favourite lyric off the album in it "Wrap you up in my daisy chain"

**nooodisaster** (9): This song is a masterpiece DON'T @ me.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Playboi Carti does what he does best, in a corner saying what over and over, A$AP Rocky delivers a great verse, and Lana goes in. I've been waiting for this since Ridin' which just never came out sadly

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): A simple banger that switches up the sound for once on the album. Rocky drops a great verse, Boi-1da kills the beat, and Carti adds some hype with his adlibs. The only thing that drags it down is being about a minute longer than it needs to be.

**whatareblackhole** (9): I love how dark this song is and the line "wrap you up in my daisy chains" is fantastic.

**dropthehammer11** (8.5): i hate playboi carti so fucking much but this song lit asf

**Elitefourbrad** (8): I liked the adlibs and the contrast of the trap beat compared to Lana.

**skargardin** (8): Dancable

**static\_int\_husp** (8): I don't know why this alblum suddenly got trap, but I enjoy it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Carti saved this

**Verdantshade** (8): love the vibes on this

**chipsi1** (7.5): I feel like Carti also questions his own feature on this with the what ad-libs

**cucumberanti** (7.5): This song is so sexy, it makes me want to get myself a sugar daddy so we can go yachting in the Hamptons and sip on margaritas on the rocks.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): Playboi Carti doesn't really have a verse but adds so much to the song. Magnolia is a bop btw

**twat\_brained** (7.3): Decent beat but you'd think after filming a music video together Lana and Rocky would have more chemistry 😕

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): Lana doing trap should be a thing

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): When I first heard this song, my original reaction was 'what the heck?'. Now, though, I see it as a pretty quirky and moody song that's a lot of fun to listen to, which is an improvement from my original lack of emotion towards it. I also like the features enough, for some reason.

**survivorjdmarina** (7): It's weird to see Lana feature on a trap/hip hop-esque track, but it somehow works... lowkey.

**Summer Mehher**

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): I like the beat and the vibe but A$AP makes me sleep and Playboi although cute is boring.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): if only we could get rid of playboi carti

**melodyllic\_** (6): tbh i respect her choice to have rappers, doesn't make it any less jarring

**MrSwearword** (6): Playboi Carti is useless and the song doesn't go anywhere save for one cute lyric set

**OriginalKappa** (6): Probably the worst highly trap influenced song on the album

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): lana does nothing for this

**Solovrinne** (6): I feel like this song did not do enough of what it was trying to do.

**technoprayers** (6): , very underwhelming but still knocks

**vayyiqra** (6): feels like an excuse for rhyming words

**stansymash** (5.5): i think there's irony somewhere here but i'm not smart enough to tell you where

**nickl00** (5): It's a bop, but it's not good

**shineflyer** (5): There's a lot of cool things in this, ruined by a generic trap beat.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): kind of a mixture between boring and annoying which is like wow how was that achieved

**theNealCutter** (5): I don't understand the hype for this song. It's like Groupie Love but it's boring. For a song that begs you not to be bummer, it sounds like Lana is.

**Summer THIS SUCKS Bummer**
---

**amumumyspiritanimal** (4): god this song takes away so much from the album. I hated it when it came out, and I still hate it.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (4): Rappers and Lana don't mix. Especially if it's Playboi Carti! Gross.

**letsallpoo** (4): i would really prefer it if lana didnt collaborate with people with a history of domestic violence

**RandomRocketKat** (3.5): fuck off rappers lana has to keep it cute

**followingfreeways** (3): this was so bad

**kappyko** (3): this is going to sound horribly dated in like 3 years. it already is. the last minute and a half kinda saves it but not really

**Leixander** (3): really clunky and just messy overall. one of my least favorite lana songs.

**m4ttycool** (3): hahahaha no

**specfagular** (3): Lana!!! This song isn't good!!! What is u doin!!!!

**dirdbub** (2.5): I swear to god commas is just gunna give this song a 10 because it has a rapper on it

**RandomHypnotica** (2.3): At least the song title is accurate

**Mudkip1** (2): dontbeeabummuhbayb beemahunduhcuhvuhluhvuhbayb

**WilsonJason** (2): CAN RAPPERS STOP FUCKING GETTING FEATURES ON POP SONGS. also whatever the fuck he is saying throughout the rest of the song needs to stop.

**enecks** (1): Ew it's trash. Like really trash. Like a bad Lana feature on an A$AP Rocky song.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD (7): did i misclick and accidentally start streaming pop 2 halfway through the song**
--- 

I love this song. The production, and somehow emotion she provokes through the heavy vocoder and harmonizers is really great. I'd like to think this would work even better had it been a part of a better concept, but just sonically it feels like a great bow on top of the album. 

--- 

**Squeaks in Cashmere**
--- 

**fourchip** (11): she kinda low-key channeled shakira in the ooohs

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): idc what anyone says this song is SO PRETTY

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): okay so this song was everything for me in december. i had this fling with a guy i crushed on fast and hard, and when i found out that things would never work between us and that a relationship is not possible i was kinda down for a good few weeks. it wasnt really my first heartbreak, thats still something to come, but it was my first time ever being in a mutual liking thing, and this song represented my feelings so much during that time. i knew nothing is possible, but i still hoped deep inside that some miracle would happen. things changed a LOT in the past 3 months though, so now im glad the way things happened but me sitting in a tub full of lukewarm water while this song went on on repeat alongside with Drew Barrymore was my main setting that few weeks.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): this is a good song and y'all know it

**CarlieScion** (10): This song is such a good closer

**dropthehammer11** (10): INCREDIBLE closer. wew

**Elitefourbrad** (10): This is such a good ending to the best album in the rate.

**InfernalSolstice** (10): underrated af

**Mudkip1** (10): lol cashmere cat has such a signature sound i like this one

**Tedyonce** (10): SO GREAT. Im a sucker for vocal editing like this

**theburningundead** (10): pop 2 who??? It really was a pleasant surprise to get to the end of the album and find this song, I love the use of vocoder here and it's definitely one of my favourite tracks. I would love to hear her try out some more experimental arrangements for songs in the future and even though I had mixed reactions to a lot of the album this is definitely a high note to finish on.

**HalfAlienRobot** (9.8): "Cause you know the good die young, but so did this. So it must be better than I think it is." Sometimes I forget how good her songwriting is and then I hear lines like this and I'm just like wow, yeah, I love her.

**nooodisaster** (9.5): Cashmere Cat did THAT. Turning a wordless chorus into one of the albums most memorable is a feat and he makes it look easy. Halsey also brings her A game. Lyrics like "'Promise I'm gonna call you back in five/Sorry baby girl but I can't tonight'" feel an impossible mix of personal and relatable.

**kappyko** (9): OOHhhoOOOOOoooOOooooOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHOohoooooooOHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOhoooooooooooooohhhhhhhhoOOOOOoooOOooooOoooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhoOOOOOoooOOooooOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHOOoooooooooooooHHHHoooooooooOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOoooooooooooHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHOOOHHoooooooooOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): can we rate 9 at some point please :)

**1998tweety** (8.2): I really don't like the chorus on this song, I think it goes on for just a little too song, which is a shame since I really really like the verses and pre-chorus on this song.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): A fitting closer to this excellent album.

**melodyllic\_** (8): ooh interesting experimental electronics!! (thx cashmere cat)

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): This reminds me a bit too much of Kanye but I like it a lot

**rickikardashian** (8): very "hide and seek", and i love it

**technoprayers** (8): , Cashmere Cat's production is great on this track, ugh his mind

**twat\_brained** (8): This one underwhelms me as a closer. The biggest parallel I see to R&J from this song is the lyric "the good die young but so did this". I'd be interested in seeing Halsey develop an album without there being a "concept" behind it following HFK.

**awryj** (7): I wonder if it's a vocoder or is it just Halsey's avocadosis [2]

**skargardin** (7): The album ends on a whimper, it's okay but nothing to gawk at.

**SkyBlade79** (7): I like this more than I remembered, but the production still seems bad to me.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): an outro

**OOOOoooOoOOoOOOhhhhhhhh that was eh**
---

**RandomRocketKat** (6.5): if there a vocodor I like it sorta

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Who let the robotic wolves into the studio?

**enecks** (6): What a weird track to end the album on? Autotune?

**MrSwearword** (6): boring but semi-decent production

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Definitely the bonus track that sounds the least messy, but it's just not very interesting aside from Cashmere's insertion of weird vocals in the background, like always. Halsey should have just inserted Devil In Me somewhere in the original tracklist and abandoned the other two songs, NGL.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I love Cashmere Cat but this is just really mediocre

**theNealCutter** (6): I feel like this should've have some beat or something. I doesn't really progress to anything.

**Verdantshade** (6): a hopeless ending

**VodkaInsipido** (6): i still don't know who cashmere cat is

**cloudbustingmp3** (5.5): did that really need to be a whole song

**survivorjdmarina** (5.5): I'm not a fan of the harmonizers used during the chorus. You're not Imogen Heap.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3.5): the pauses made me uncomfortable lol it sounded like my spotify was buffering

**stansymash** (3): well at least it brought itself home at the end

**natsby** (2): this is just a desperate attempt to make the whole thing a concept album again after going completely off track halfway through the record

**specfagular** (2): there's really nothing special about this. it's boring and doesn't fit in the album

**whatareblackhole** (2): Cashmere Cat's production doesn't fit with the rest of this album? I'm so confused by the artistic choices at play.

**dirdbub** (1): the most self-indulgent Cashy song yet

**cyborglilith** (0): wtf

**Raykel** (0): Oh my god was that her belting why did it sound like that what was this it was like a dollar store brand of Kanye's Lost In The World I'm shaking I literally feel attacked did she try to attack him with that I feel like she did I'm hurt what the fuck cashmere cat has done better like I don't know his music that well but I listened to all his collaborations with Ariana and those were good so what in the hell did he do here this is some boneless Bon Iver attempt I'm suing

Ooph, you'd expect this to be controversial, a fairly fan favorite song out already? The controversy is actually one of the lowest so far in the rate. Sitting at 1.778, the song truly just stuck in this spot for the majority of the rate. 

It is cute, and is a "vibe" but it just never strikes me the same way other songs in her discography did. 

--- 

**VROOM VROOM**

**gannade** (10): i LOVE this song and the whistles in it!

**MrSwearword** (10): A VIDEO FOR A SONG THAT'S NOT A SINGLE THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD? JOHN WAYNE WHO

**whatareblackhole** (10): Whiiite Muustaaaang

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): i almost got rear ended by a white mustang once while this was playing and that was pretty wild

**InfernalSolstice** (9.5): lana? making a reasonably lengthed ballad? :snatched:

**natsby** (9): this song really grew on me. I love how it embodies the lazy, hazy sound of summer moodiness and complements summer bummer really well. also that whistling is delicious.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): ENDED G-Eazy's career

**OriginalKappa** (9): Probably the best highly trap influenced song on the album

**technoprayers** (9): , I love the smooth transition and the beat brings me back to Born To Die

**kappyko** (8.5): this sounds familiar

**amumumyspiritanimal** (8): deserved to be bigger, but that music video is a choice

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8): lowkey boring

**skargardin** (8): The vibes in this song OH MY GOD I LOVE IT

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Charli XCX's Porsche and Lambo can't compare

**twat\_brained** (8): "..I couldn't stop the way I was feeling the day your record dropped AND IT WASN'T EVEN THAT GOOD". She's right; TB&D leaves a lot to be desired. Lana's falsetto here isn't much better, in all honesty. I think it's good, but far from the best on the album.

**:eyes:**
--- 

**cyborglilith** (7.5): I don't want to give every song in the rate higher than 8 so this has to be marked down

**150k Miles, but Runs Well**
--- 

**melodyllic\_** (7.5): after the quiet intensity of cherry, this song doesn't really hold up, but it still is a pleasant tune, reminiscent of the 'born to die' era with the use of her high register

**jimmy345960** (7.2): forgettable

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): The one song on this album that'd fit the best on one of her old ones. It's actually a song I like a lot, but a Lana track under three minutes just unnerves me. It goes pretty well with the rest of the project, but the lyrical dissonance from every other song brings the score down a little as well.

**rotating3Dtext** (7): is not a bad song if you listen to it on its own, but it feels like a repeat of all the same sounds in the album so far. And the lyrics came out of a Lana del Rey song generator.

**survivorjdmarina** (7): Like the song before it, it's good, but it's not the most amazing deep cut on the album.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlz_XHeUUis

WTF u guys. Where is your taste? Did it leave when you guys decided to rate out Closer on day 1? When you let Kesha's poor album tracks slaughter most of Katy's good stuff? Huh? Huh? What do you have to say for yourselves. 

Anyways. 

This is pretty, and there are a couple of questionable flow issues during parts, but she actually kinda put her heart into this and y'all need to respect that.


**SO BABY**
--- 

**PULL ME CLOSER** 
--- 

**MashLuke** (11): this deserves my 11

**1998tweety** (10): Wow I've never been in a relationship but this song gets me emotional. Maybe its because she says "unknown lover".

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): im a sucker for ballads

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): Her Liability. This N E E D S to be top 10.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): sadly can relate

**CarlieScion** (10): This made me cry the first time I listened to it - all these emotions she had because of the break up

**dropthehammer11** (10): What a fucking ballad, its so honest, emotional, personal, incredible.

**followingfreeways** (10): truly stands out on this album and makes me feel guilty for things that I've never even done

**gannade** (10): Halsey is surprisingly good at these type of songs, but this isnt "Is there somewhere"

**InfernalSolstice** (10): :cry:

**Verdantshade** (10): this is for anyone that says halsey is manufactured or can't sing

**twat\_brained** (9.4): This is such a heartbreaking yet beautiful song. I'd be on board with Halsey doing more ballads if they sounded like this!

**m4ttycool** (9): cool, but I don't really like her voice (?

**swadadu** (8.7): This song feels very honest and is a nice change from the slightly monotonous sound of the rest of the album

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Never thought I'd see the day Halsey did a simple piano ballad, but this is pretty and when you're in the right mood it's kind of heartbreaking.

**cucumberanti** (8): As a person who constantly fucks up relationships because of their insecurities and doubts I RELATE TO THIS SONG SO MUCH 🤧

**nickl00** (8): It's nice that's she's actually admitting it's her fault

**Solovrinne** (8): I said slow it down, and she did. A sweet song.

**technoprayers** (8): , her voice kind of sounds bearable on this

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Beyoncé, Justin, Nothing but Thieves, Future, Rick Ross, Ciara sweatie i'm so sorry that an ugly ass bitch would even say that..... jk nice little ballad.

**whatareblackhole** (7.5): The beginning of the verse sounds like 100 Letters. I think this song is good, but the lyrics in the chorus are a little terse in comparison to the lyrics of the verses.

**Cause it Wasn't**
--- 

**Leixander** (7): why was this made a single again

**Cute lil Filler**
---

**skargardin** (7.5): This album is already starting to drag and I'm not even halfway through.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): A pretty but slightly underwhelming ballad.

**SkyBlade79** (7): bieber is shaken

**specfagular** (7): a nice little ballad but it's missing something. I don't really think her voice is the best for this song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): wow i love justin bieber and beyonce

**vayyiqra** (7): nice

**melodyllic\_** (6): ah, now this is where halsey falters a bit. her voice is a bit too weak for simple, stripped down ballads.

**nooodisaster** (6): Look, I'm not saying the lyrics aren't heartfelt and emotional, I'm just really bored.

**Raykel** (6): This is so surface level. She could've really opened up here, but since she held back it makes it sound melodramatic instead of sad and honestly, Lorde did it betta!

**survivorjdmarina** (6): A ballad that seems somewhat filler in my opinion.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): this is a bargain brand Back to December

**RandomRocketKat** (5): Insert sad pity ballad here

**robbiec\_** (5): this Is Filler but I like the piano ballad amongst all the electro pop


**Maybe, Just Maybe, They Aren't About the Same Person**
--- 

**theNealCutter** (6): she was begging to the guy on Now Or Never to love her, but now she's apologizing for not realizing that she was loved? I like the sentiment, but it's just disjointed from the story. And not to mention, I hate that she's not rhyming at the second verse.

**Sorry Sweetie, I'm So Sorry that a Bitch like this would even…**
--- 

**natsby** (4): it's a nice change of pace but drags on

**kappyko** (3.5): I rated words to this. My 0 was "floof" for not being a real word, while my 11 was "number" for its evocation of mathematics. This song was that boring. I would rate "sorry" as a word to be a 9.

**stansymash** (3.5): oh gosh she just keeps singing

**awryj** (3): My ignorinse has struck agin

**cloudbustingmp3** (2.2): props to her for trying a ballad i guess

**MrSwearword** (2): does she want a fucking medal for remembering her love interest's birthday and for remembering the mom's favorite song? GET. THE. FUCK

**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): don't care

A bop, but a bit mellow and reserved. There doesn't seem to be a build up and pay-off despite having a tense feeling to it. 

The Weeknd's influences are super notable, but Halsey did a great job making it her own while recording, her vocals are super unique and really make the song what it is. 

--- 

**Eyes, Ears, and Legs Open for this**
--- 

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (10): Really catchy and interesting. Great pop song. Probably my faves.

**SkyBlade79** (10): this song is sooooo good, I adore it. Strong vocals with stronger lyrics.

**twat\_brained** (9.3): I think one of the main reasons why I resonated with this is because it reminds me loads of "Hold Me Down", which was always a favorite of mine off "Badlands".

**CarlieScion** (9): I remember listening to this when it came about and hearing the lyrics as "fuck it, my eyes closed he looks just like you"

**nooodisaster** (9): The chorus on this is SUCH a bop. Lyrically this song is Poker Face but str8, and honestly I'm not complaining. The whisps of vocals in the background really add mystery and weight as well. Good job Halsey!

**vayyiqra** (9): one of her best songs

**1998tweety** (8.5): My least favourite part about this song is that it sounds like shes saying "oink" at the very beginning. This is also one of the few times where I prefer the stripped down version of the boppier version. Honestly this version sounds like Halsey is being unreasonable when shes kinda the one at fault. The stripped version however feels a lot more intimate and I sympathize with Halsey. Nonetheless, I still like this version. It bops.

**kappyko** (8.5): I like the title I really could just close my eyes to this

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): The echoes alone bump this up a good 2 points

**fourchip** (8): my lover, my liar

**robbiec\_** (8): this feels like it should have been released a few years ago (like most of Reputation) but it's still a good song and the first Halsey song that convinced me she was worth my time

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): is this the bisexual Lips Of An Angel

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): should probably be a single tbh

**VodkaInsipido** (8): bop

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): the acoustic version DEF outsold but i guess its good
**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): this song is so halsey

**skargardin** (7): Eh, it's okay.

**survivorjdmarina** (7): Meh... it's tolerable.

**technoprayers** (7): , alright Ashley you got me there

**whatareblackhole** (7): This one got a little repetitive for me, but overall, I enjoy the sound

**WilsonJason** (7): :(

**Keeping My Eyes AND Ears Closed**
---

**enecks** (6): If you got an average of all the trap-influenced pop, this'd be it. It's OK, but deeply forgettable, and kinda vapid.

**Solovrinne** (6): meh

**specfagular** (6): eh is really all I can say about this. It's really nothing special but it's not bad

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): And if I keep my ears closed I won't have to listen to this track which would be nice

**theNealCutter** (6): so Halsey hooks up with another person, but she's not over the King yet. The production is very drone-y and cliched. I feel off with the non-melody of the chorus. The atmosphere feels so wrong. The song sounds angry and dark, but the lyrics doesn't fit the mood. And for the love god, just stop with the pitch-shifted vocals.

**MrSwearword** (5): standard Halsey but she's done better...I think


**RandomRocketKat** (5): forgettable

**dirdbub** (4): this is if angst was masqueraded as pop

**therokinrolla** (3): I have an irrational dislike of this song and I don't know why. It's probably because its so generic, and incredibly uninteresting. When i heard this song the first time I hated it so much. It's just… nothing. It has very few good qualities. A mess.

**Mudkip1** (2): generic production

**natsby** (2): I forget what this sounds like the moment I stop listening to it

**stansymash** (2): my goodness. this is bad

**cucumberanti (1): It sounds like she's covering a The Weeknd song and not in the good way. Forgettable from start to finish.** 
--- 

**melodyllic\_** (7.5): ah now this is the sad, horny abel-lite halsey I expected. the chorus still bangs tho!

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): although i dislike his voice, but the weeknds writing is awesome

**dropthehammer11** (10): the weeknd influence is strong but i love abel so yes this is a 10 and a strong one

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I wished Weeknd did a feature verse here. I feel like he could play Luna's ex in this song. But other than that, it's a bop.

**gannade** (9): i love the weeknd but this is second rate from his best work, halseys voice kinda saves it though

**MashLuke** (9): This is clearly a Starboy reject but boy, is this not a bop?

**Verdantshade** (9): sounds quite a bit like a weeknd song (understandable since he wrote it) but she pulls it off incredibly well

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Abel really is all over this track and it's amazing.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I never got the Weeknd comparisons until people started noticing the similarities, and now I can't unhear them. Aside from that, this is a pretty decent song, even if it is the least alternative song in this rate by a longshot. The bridge is pretty dope.

**nickl00** (5): I think the Weeknd co-wrote it, but it feels so much like one of his songs I can't get over it

**whatareblackhole** (10): I cried the first time I heard this song…god it's so good. Just the message being conveyed, we needed Lana to make this album.

**SkyBlade79** (9.5): this is actually really good… super memorable, production is good, and top notch vocals and lyrics

**jimmy345960** (9.4): bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): dizzy from loving this song

**robbiec\_** (9.1): the girls pearls is lazy but I love her melodies on this and it should get a follow up video after White Mustang after the middles

**melodyllic\_** (9): the title is a mouthful, but the post-chorus thing is heavenly!

**natsby** (9): This is definitely a politicaltm song as well, but somehow it's vague and fictional enough to work for Lana. not to mention it feels like there are 3 different choruses in it, and all are amazing in their own right and keep building and building to the closest lana has ever come to sounding dystopic before suddenly releasing into hope ('it's only the beginning...'/'when the world was at war')

**kappyko** (8): i think my infatuation with the Lana aesthetic is what keeps me from rating songs i would normally dislike lower because she does what she does really well when she's doing it

**nickl00** (8): Better than Coachella in every way

**skargardin** (8): Yaas Lana drag America!

**survivorjdmarina** (8): This song is extremely underrated! This brings a nostalgic factor to me on a cold, windy day.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I can't believe Lana invented World War II

**theburningundead** (7.5): get woke katy perry

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): nice hopeful song but i swear sometimes her lyrics really do sound like she just picks words out of a hat and hopes for the best

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7): fall out boy realness

**awryj** (7): when I go out I wanna go out dancing

**enecks** (7): This is where Lana's invoking of the 60's as an analogue for contemporary politics actually pays off, and works. The swearing feels gratuitous.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): very tumblr-ish title

**MrSwearword** (7): I actually haven't softened up to this yet, but something is there...I think.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Very pretty and poignant song, but it's the track I listen to the least, and I honestly can't remember any of the verses.

**Solovrinne** (7): I like it, want to hear more songs that have her at such a high pitch sometimes.

**technoprayers** (7): , Again, I like the song but it's just there for me, I love the socially conscious lyrics

**theNealCutter** (7): ehhh now she's back at pretending she cares. at least it has better melodies.

**vayyiqra** (7): okay now she is just blatantly trolling

**nooodisaster (6): why is summer bummer replaying but now it's bad??**
--- 

--- 

This is like Summer Bummer but without the good parts. Like a lot of the album I constantly forget what everything sounds like, and unfortunately this is no exception. Nothing really clicked for me, and despite being on the controversial side, this never really got out of the mid-high 40s range. 

--- 

**I Wanna Be in Their Group Love**
--- 

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): all of lanas cuteness, except A$AP gets in on it too <3

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Queen of orgies!

**MrSwearword** (10): SLAY

**theNealCutter** (10): Probably her best melodies are mashed into this song. It captures the Born To Die's soul, but with the "Lust for Life." The slow trap beat paired with her lush multi-tracked vocals and the subtle strings create this suspended feeling for the chorus. I love it.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): one of the songs of the summer tbh

**cyborglilith** (9.5): Lana really likes A$AP Rocky, apparently. At least his verse actually fits the song.

**cucumberanti** (9): Such a dreamy song. Immediately makes me think of summer.

**Raykel** (9): This song effortlessly makes beautiful visuals in my head. I always like attaching made up videos in my head for songs and this one just writes itself.

**robbiec\_** (9): I played this to my fwb and they said "is this 50 Cent?" In other news I understand that the whole concept of groupies is gross but I feel Lana singing it makes more sense. A lot of other songs about groupies it's just assumed that the woman is there for a hook up rather than actually being a music fan like the men in attendance whereas here firstly she is the one saying she is DTF and secondly Rocky is the groupie which is switching the gender roles of this contrived concept

**Solovrinne** (9): The catchiest song on the album, could remember it perfectly even if you haven't listen to it in months. Lyrics might be a little... simple?

**kappyko** (8.5): this is like the warmer version of the previous song and way prettier

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): One of the most underrated songs on Lust For Life, IMO. I like songs like this that focus on friendship and companionship and Lana and Rocky sound super tight here. Her voice on the chorus is also divine. I will admit Rocky's feature here is slightly less memorable than on the previous song.

**theburningundead** (8.5): I love everything about this song except the chorus and I feel like it had so much more potential

**fourchip** (8): interesting collab but it works

**m4ttycool** (8): much better than Summer Bummer

**skargardin** (8): The trap Born to Die vibes are real!

**survivorjdmarina** (8): On this track, Lana sounds very dreamy when she is placed over a trap-inspired beat. It also seems to work for her. The lyrics are also reminiscent of Honeymoon to an extent.

**swadadu** (8): Very nice song to sway to.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): The lesser of the Rocky collabs, but still a good song.

**whatareblackhole** (8): This song makes me feel like I'm high lol

**melodyllic\_** (7.5): love the way the phrase 'groupie love' is layered, but everything else is a bit shallow

**Piccprincess** (7.5): Fuck G-Eazy

**RandomRocketKat** (7.5): I like the wavey synth they throw in during the verses, the trap beats in the back of the chorus is a nice touch, and the rapper doesnt ruin it for once.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): I love A$AP in these type of tracks but Lana's part doesn't do much for me

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): the verses are its best parts, the chorus is yet again lana just repeating the title of the song

**SkyBlade79** (7): I like the old lana roleplay aspect

**Groupie, more like Confusie Love**
---

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.8): eh

**twat\_brained** (6.8): Is she singing or moaning here? Or is it called moan-singing? I'm a Britney stan, I should know this. Also it's a good thing I had a coffee earlier today or I might not be awake to finish the album. Rocky's verse here sure isn't helping either.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): her voice is like a synth

**CarlieScion** (6): The superior ASAP feature

**Marshynarsh** (6): This was an anti grower for me. I liked it a lot when it was released but I find it kind of boring now tbh

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): i wanna be in an orgy

**nickl00** (6): Her voice just melts with the production, other than that it's meh


**technoprayers** (6): , same as Summer Bummer but somewhat better

**vayyiqra** (6): boring

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): More of the same. Nothing really stands out here.

**Caught an STD**
---

**Verdantshade** (5): if this was a ballad with a more stripped back production and without the asap verse this would be a good song

**stansymash** (4.5): i really wish i was feeling this but instead i am feeling nothing. i am sorry friends

**natsby** (4): if I didn't just love Lana's voice and therefore everything she sings so much, I would have rated this lower. It's somewhat boring, completely expected, and way way worse than most of her unreleased gems (even completely unpolished ones like You Can Be the Boss!!!) WHY.

**WilsonJason** (4): Damn he ruined another song but this one probably woulda been an 8

**amumumyspiritanimal** (3): the wailing ruins it combined with the rap

**Leixander** (3): i really lost my faith on lana for a few days after she released this and summer bummer. hopefully rest of the album was not like this... songs.

**Tedyonce** (1): no thanks

**enecks** (0): Don't fucking glorify groupie relationships you piece of shit. They're toxic abuse, and frequently pedophilic.

---

Boring and a highkey useless feature and I don't mind saying that out-loud

--- 

**Certified Fresh** 
--- 

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): one of my fave lana ballads for sure

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this song has been a journey for me! originally hated it the first time i heard it, but now it's probably my 3rd favorite on the album. the harmonies are G O R G E O U S

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): The sun is going down. The sky is red and purple. Sitting on a porch, watching the moon rise over a field. That is this song. Also, has John risen from the grave?

**jimmy345960** (10): a bop that taylor put on her playlist. It was a bop then and its a bop now.

**m4ttycool** (10): I can't believe I love a song with a male feature omg

**therokinrolla** (10): the yin to BP,BP's yang, this song is also incredibly gorgeous, but it is sad as fuck. Sadcore Lana is back.

**Verdantshade** (10): sean's voice gives me chills, it's like his father's still alive in some way. his guitar playing is fantastic too

**whatareblackhole** (10): This ballad is probably one of Lana's strongest. (But do you think Sean actually sounds like that or do you think he sings like that to sound like his dad?)

**gannade** (9.5): beautiful

**nickl00** (9): sometimes you just need a wholesome Lana song

**nooodisaster** (9): This is a reference literally no one else will get, but this song always conjures strong "The Book of Salt" imagery from me, idk why.

**skargardin** (9): Absolutely stunning.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This is the closest Lana has ever gone to time traveling tbh

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): This song is absolutely wonderful, and the chorus does an amazing job painting the scene.

**awryj** (8.8): I had no idea Sean Lennon sounded just like his father

**kappyko** (8.5): i get the beatles vibe she's going for and this really is pretty

**OriginalKappa** (8.5): I really like this song but I will never not find its meta-ness kind of weird. Like Sean being on the track is not a character, but he dumps her? Or is his bit of the song unrelated? Also poor Sean Lennon, never being able to escape his dad's legacy even in his own songs

**enecks** (8): wa wa wa wa wa wa wa. Jokes aside, this is good.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Wow, Lana has three PoC on this album! Wig! Okay, okay, all jokes aside Sean is a dead ringer for John. It's awesome to see one of the Beatle kids make a song with a modern artist, because it demolishes the idea that old music is better than modern music.

**shineflyer** (8): Sean's singing and writing adds a LOT to this track.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Wow, John Lennon's son sounds uncannily similar to him.

**technoprayers** (8): , another amazing collaboration

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): This song hits all my Beatles nostalgia and I love it for that. I honestly wish this album had more songs like this. It's a vibe that works for Lana.

**melodyllic\_** (7.5): could send me to sleep tbh (that's not an insult!)

**stansymash** (7.5): this is lovely

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): good god this is the epitome of hipster, but it still sounds pretty nice. John Lennon snapped too.

**cyborglilith** (7.2): wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wine

**robbiec\_** (7): I was very apprehensive about the Sean feature but he is a good foil to Lana here and this song is another romantic one

**survivorjdmarina** (6.5): It's alright, I guess. Sean's vocals seem ill-fitting though.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (6): yoko ono's screaming would've been better

**MrSwearword** (6): again, something's there but he's inconsequential and this is kind of boring as shit.

**RandomRocketKat** (6): His voice got me off guard, i dont listen to the Beatles

**theNealCutter** (6): I'm just bored. they have this weird focus on this little details on the lyrics but as I listen more and more, it just seems more rushed and pointless.

**dropthehammer11** (5): boring and its a shame bc its a lennon but ugh

**natsby** (5): I'm only rating this higher than groupie love because of how amused I was when she name-dropped Sean. postmodernism wins again!

**Solovrinne** (5): Not as emotional as it tried to be.

**twat\_brained** (5): Before I heard this I had no idea John Lennon even HAD a son, much less how he doesn't match up to his father in the slightest. This is cute but doesn't need to be on the album.

**vayyiqra** (5): enough gimmicky collabs

**VodkaInsipido** (5): too long and too boring

**Elitefourbrad** (4): I feel like this could be so much better, but it's really not.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): yikes this is boring

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): dark bop, I hoed out a lot last summer to this song.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I like how Groupie Love is about Lana falling out for this unnamed aritst and then it transitions to this song lol.

**HalfAlienRobot** (9): "I'm crying while I'm coming" - me listening to Lana Del Rey

**lady\_sable** (9): so underrated tbh

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): i still dont know what the fuck she sings in the bridge but wig

**melodyllic\_** (8.5): lana is 100% committed to the trip-hop at this stage, and it actually makes this song catchier and more noticeable than the three before it. i actually thought she would break into a rap verse tbh!

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Honestly, the prechorus sounds like a Lana-ified yodel (no, seriously, why does it seem so familiar? I hope the rest of the comments will enlighten me) but I have such a guilty pleasure for the 'who's doper than this bitch?/who's freer than mick?' lines. I don't know why Lana manages to make annoying hippie quotes so enjoyable.

**therokinrolla** (8.5): This song is a G-Eazy diss track. That should say enough as to why it should win the rate.

**cucumberanti** (8): Smoking while running on the treadmill? Your faves' respiratory system could never.

**whatareblackhole** (6.5): You know, I like this one, but it's never been the super standout for me that everyone thinks it is? I do like "I'm cryin' while I'm cummin'" though, that's iconic.

**awryj** (6): beyonce is shaking

**chipsi1** (6): i feel like she wanted to hiccup every time she got to the chorus while recording this song

**nooodisaster** (6): At the end of part 1, Lana realizes Daddy ain't shit, dumps him, and instead decides to become a social advocate.

**Solovrinne** (6): I wanted it to grow on me but I'm not a fan of the chorus.

**survivorjdmarina** (6): This is probably one of my least favorite tracks on the album. It's not terrible, but it doesn't do anything for me.

**twat\_brained** (6): "I'm crying while I'm cumming"🤣🤣🤣 I can't even type that with a straight face let alone listen to it. Also, since you asked, straight white cis men are freer than you, Lana.

**stansymash** (5.8): i have forgotten this song

**robbiec\_** (5.5): I just never really clicked with this song but it gave us "crying while I'm cumming" so

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): She has a better flow than Eminem, how many words can she fit into one line? Too bad this song's not that interesting

**InfernalSolstice (9): the guitar > your fave**
--- 

Something about this song and the timing of the album/tour release really hinted at a politically leaning/themed release and era, and the promos leading into it sure did as well, but when the songs started coming and the album dropped, it was clear that any meanings and ideas really 'promo-d' didn't reflect what we got. 

In that case, and because it was never the focal point, the meaning behind 'Fear the Future' is close to genius. She gave us an aesthetic, and loudness, and she ran with it. It moved, and had direction, but unfortunately wasn't able to strike up enough power to make it into day 2.

**LOUD ERA RIHANNA IS SHAKING**

**cyborglilith** (10): this is a YUGE song, and I can see why she named her tour after it

**vayyiqra** (10): this is what the future sounds like

**melodyllic\_** (9.5): a brilliant mixture of electronics and rock guitars!! the 'fear the future' phrase uses such a great chord progression I CANT

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): There's so much tension here, it really makes the song. This deserves to be more discussed!

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): synthpop bop

**technoprayers** (9): , a really invigorating track, always picks up my mood

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): A brash and brutal track for St. Vincent, it's a truly hectic and wild track in an album full of hectic and wild tracks.

**1998tweety** (8.8): The song sounds like the perfect one to end the album on so its weird to see it over here. One thing I love on this track is how you can hear Annie gasp for breathes after a few of her lines, on a track like this I feel like it adds more than it takes away.

**twat\_brained** (8.6): I already fear the present so I dread to think what the future holds in store.

**kappyko** (8.5): aaaa

**awryj** (8): the production is really cool here

**CarlieScion** (8): The guitar is so good

**nickl00** (8): I really like her voice and the production.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Not sure what to give this. I love the harder production here but I can't remember much else about it aside from the 'Please tell me, sir' hook. If you're going to make songs that sound heavy, make them more memorable.

**skargardin** (8): This song is so wild and chaotic that it's almost exhausting!

**specfagular** (8): I fear the future too Annie it's ok

**Verdantshade** (8): oh boy that production

**stansymash** (7.9): this is the weakest song in the album, truly

**Elitefourbrad** (7.5): I fear the future too, Annie is #relatable.

**mokitsu** (7.5): Eclectic but too short to make a lasting impression I think.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): whew

**enecks** (7): This is a chaotic, unwieldy, but energising rush of a song

**I Prefer to be Stirred, not Shaken like this**
---

**survivorjdmarina** (7): lol this is like a low-budget version of Sugarboy tbh

**theNealCutter** (7): it's a little too gritty for my taste, but it's still enjoyable. I like the duality of the lyrics, on one hand it's about the loss of a friend, on the other hand, it's the fear of the uncertainty of fame. Are you gonna end up fine? Or will you be devoured by everything you love?

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Harder rock but it's just kinda...there. Like it's not the best but it's certainly not the worst.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): Okay?

**MrSwearword** (6): decent/subpar

**nooodisaster** (6): My str8 soulmate read this song for basically having no variety in intensity, and I'm not about to argue with a music theory fuck like him, lmao. So it's a 6.

**Solovrinne** (6): I only like it because the beat reminds me of a certain video game soundtrack I like it. Could not care less about the rest of the song.

**whatareblackhole** (6): Here she is with her complex about technology again…is this a reject from her self-titled?

**WilsonJason** (6): Spitting static right back at it. It don't matter that you got me frantic. So supreme, oh it's electric. Like a dream yeah, it's prophetic. Like a dream yeah, it's prophetic. It's a scream when you least expect it! sorry but I have to listen to good music so my ears dont die

**natsby** (5): apart from the outtro, this feels a bit too samey to stand out amongst the rest of the noisy tracks in this album.

**BrokenGlassSparkling** (3): Not my thing.

**Not Forgiven**

**RandomRocketKat** (6): the only one I don't REALLY like, sorry wailord :emofish:

gannade: Lorde stans are delusional and we need to have a minimum age limit for these rates. Imagine thinking a reprise is better than all these songs minus Halsey's interludes. Imagine thinking moving metal furniture around constitutes as a song these days. Imagine stanning an artist who doesnt sing live and has an ego so big she thinks she can sell out stadiums and then has 30% occupancy. Also I'm kinda over this since she apologized but imagine stanning an artist who insensitively jokes about someone's death.

Not when the average age of Halsey stans are the same, if not younger than Lorde's.

> Imagine stanning an artist who doesnt sing live

Has Miranda Cosgrove even ***performed*** live? That is the question.

> Also I'm kinda over this since she apologized but imagine stanning an artist who insensitively jokes about someone's death.

Then don't attempt to make it a dig, and Lorde didn't mean it like that and you know it. Going for low blows like it in a rate is beyond stupid.

Can people stop with the “Melodrama is trash” hottakes, you’re not special or unique, you just have bad taste in music. Imagine thinking Good Song-Less Fountain Kingdom is better...

Bikerjacket: Lol i was so confused why In My Feelings and some good Lana songs were out this early. I forgot Melodrama was on this lol I love Melodrama but honestly, Melodrama should be banned from a rate or at least pit it against other popheads beloved albums. The resentment this is causing is insane.

wanderingimpromptu3: The St. Vincent songs are also doing much better than Lana's. I think higher profile artists have more built in controversy / lowkey sabotage, which brings down the scores.
