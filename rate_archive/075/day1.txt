And the first song out is from Panic! I was actually somewhat surprised to see this song sink to the bottom like it did, as our next song was dead last for the majority of the rate before this one took its place. I think Too Weird To Live... is one of Panic!'s weaker albums, mostly due to some of its more electronic songs that don't go anywhere interesting, and while Girl That You Love has grown on me a lot, it's by far the weak link in the incredibly strong first half of this album.

---

# HOW YOU GET THE GIRL

**radiofan15** (10): Damn this is fantastic... why wasn't this a single tho? It truly slaps all the way through...

**modulum83** (7.5): I like this song a lot actually

**waluigiest** (7): THROBBING beat but I think the lyrics are dumb

# NO GIRLS ALLOWED

**Raykel** (6.5): If this was done by a synthpop artist it would've been better cause they wouldn't be scared to go full throttle with this

**CarlieScion** (5): a very mediocre song on an otherwise great album

**1998tweety** (3): The production on this is great, but wow his voice is so bad on it and the lyrics are good.

**ignitethephoenix** (3): This song is just not that good and is very fillery after such a strong set of songs before

**ImADudeDuh** (3): the worst song on the album arrived

**/u/alwayswords** (2.5): the instrumental sounds like a dentist’s drill

**Verdantshade** (2): panic (and fall out boy) have made some truly awful songs in recent years but girl that you love has to be one of the worst. an actual mess of autotune and hugely lacking in lyrical depth. I ended up not giving a zero in this rate but I contemplated giving it to this song - fortunately the instrumental is its sole saving grace

r/popheads says fuck slower songs and fuck the institution of marriage! Brendon's wedding vows to his wife Sarah did not prove popular with raters, dropping like a stone early on and only barely rising above dead last. The lyrics are cute, but the sound is mildly dirge-y and doesn't drum up a whole lot of interest.

# LAY US DOWN, WE'RE IN LOVE

**waluigiest** (10): this out of tune piano is going to kill me immediately

**radiofan15** (8.5): I kinda like this song, it works amazingly as an album closer... but as an individual song tho... not so sure.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this vocoder ended Enya

# FUCK CULTURAL MONOGAMY LIVES

**hikkaru** (6.5): i can't hear what he's saying with that filter on his voice but it's pretty

**ignitethephoenix** (6): snooze

**/u/alwayswords** (4.5): someone PLEASE take autotune away from brendon

**modulum83** (4): if only the album ended with Collar Full

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (4): I kinda hate the sound of this?

**Roxieloxie** (1): So remember what i said about modern panic having good intro songs well they also have terrible last songs

**Verdantshade** (1): the end of the hoe life. the song is as boring as commitment

Perhaps unsurprisingly, showing up in the bottom 3 as FOB's lowest song is the one that features Big Sean. Fall Out Boy has had some interesting collabs with rappers over the years, and while Sean's voice adds character here, Lil Wayne on Tiffany Blews this most certainly is not. That said, I think it kinda adds a certain charm to the song. The grind really don't stop, y'all.

---

# BIG SEAN IS THE GOAT

**realboxwood** (10): "I'm either fucking or working, so the grind don't stop" >>> everything Shakespeare ever wrote

**waluigiest** (10): I’M EITHER FUCKING OR WORKING SO THE GRIND DON’T STOP

**Gwemm** (9.2): I do like the Big Sean feature but it does kinda break up the cohesion of the song.

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): Hell yeah im a dick girl addicted to you

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (8): centuries outsold, but this is still a good little thing

**radiofan15** (7.4): Big Sean came for blood like a vampire in a sorority during the girls' period.

**/u/alwayswords** (7): “And hell yeah I'm a dick, girl, ad-dick-ted to you” the peak of songwriting

# PEOPLE GLAD THAT BIG SEAN DIES IN THIS SONG'S VIDEO


**1998tweety** (5): Umm

**ignitethephoenix** (5): why is big Sean here tf

**Verdantshade** (5): this is one of those questionable features that surprisingly works. unfortunately it's a very mediocre song

**modulum83** (2): "and hell yeah I'm a dick, girl, addicted to you"

**vhqv1997** (2): The epitome of unnecessary shitty rap verse

**ImADudeDuh** (1): OOF i forgot about this verse.

This was a potential 11 for me, so naturally this is MCR's first song out of the rate. Tragic. Admittedly, the appeal of this one depends strongly on your tolerance for Gerard's very interesting moaning all over this song, but TBH it kinda works for me...if not for the rest of you. :'(

---

# DESTROYING THE COMPETITION

**fifteensunflwrs** (9): twelve year old me hated it but I love it now and the moans are highkey iconic

**radiofan15** (8.5): Phil Collins snapped in the intro

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (8.4): Vestroya (ヴェストロイア, Vestroya?) is a planet in an alternate dimension where Bakugan initially lived.

**Saucymac** (8): wow this song is so dramatic

**Verdantshade** (8): those moans though.. also it's heavier than like half the songs on bullets which is always a good thing

**vhqv1997** (8): This song has next to no melody, but at the very least it has a lot of angst and Gerard delivers it incredibly, and the post-chorus really goes off

**CarlieScion** (7): the moans really. take me out of the song

**ignitethephoenix** (7): 🤘😓

**Gwemm** (6.4): Honestly, this song is refreshing after the last six snoozefests.

# GERARD WAY MOANING IN YOUR EAR

**1998tweety** (6): A bit too screamy for me

**waluigiest** (6): picks up some cool energy towards the end but takes a while to get there

**hikkaru** (3): the mixing omfg....

**modulum83** (1): discount metal with bonus moaning noises

**/u/alwayswords** (0): the moaning in this song makes me feel violated

**ImADudeDuh** (0): its a no from me dawg, oh i just got to the moaning, yeah this is a 0

Finally, the interludes come to their inevitable demise! Honestly, some may critique the stylings of these interludes as too YouTube girl-esque, but I think they work in their intention of tying the albums themes together. To each their own?

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (10): really I should get myself checked the minute-long interludes shouldn’t be my favorite part of the album

**Roxieloxie** (9): this is a mood except i didnt graduated with honors

Yeah, this is pretty much the epitome of rent-a-rapper culture. Not surprising to see this exit, though the revised instrumentation is sorta interesting, even if 2Chainz's verse is...not particularly inspired.

---

**TragicKingdom1** (8): honestly much better than the original lol mostly bc of the production changes

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): I thought maybe 2 Chainz could be good on this but then I remembered that this came from the era where rap features were tacked on to songs with no thought into if they fit. So unfortunately, no.

**radiofan15** (5.5): There was like a lot of potential but the instrumental clashing with the hip-hop drums sounds ugly as fuck, it robs the song of all of its energy... At least 2 Chainz sounds decent here, his whole segment is amazing, so this ain't another 7 Rings situation

**waluigiest** (5): this kinda sounds like someone just discovered GarageBand and had fun playing around with the song for 20 minutes

**modulum83** (4): "she like when I buy her stuff" my god why do all the rappers FOB collaborate with have such lazy verses

# HAPPY NOW

**\_wailordfan** (10): This is my favorite of the three interludes, and I love it so much I've considered giving it my 11

**vhqv1997** (9): A punkrock band not being angry? Blasphemy!

**waluigiest** (9): say it with your chest!!!

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (7.8): same

**modulum83** (6.5): I love that these interludes are like little snapshots into Hayley's life

# STILL ANGRY 

**1998tweety** (6): Marina outsold

**ignitethephoenix** (4): good for you?

**radiofan15** (0): What is this Lilo & Stitch 3: Snitches get Stitches outtake? P.S.: all of the interludes deserves a ZERO, however the rules prevents me for doin' so, and I have to give one of them the dreaded score, nothing against this particular Interlude.

r/popheads is coming for my throat by knocking out the host's 11 early on day 1! Where is the love, y'all! But seriously, I ADORE this song, like as much as I adore FOB's best pre-hiatus work. The raw, frenetic energy of this song gets me going instantly and Courtney rambling over the "RAT A TAT TAT AY!"s gives it extra punch. This song deserved better but I am not particularly surprised it lost out here.

---

# GETTING ON ST. PETER'S LIST

**vhqv1997** (10): Courtney Love is extremely problematic but I can't deny she did have the exact spark needed to make this song pop off

**waluigiest** (10): this song makes me want to furiously dance

**ImADudeDuh** (9): ARE YOU READY FOR ANOTHER BAD POEM!

**1998tweety** (8.5): Bop

**radiofan15** (8.1): I can't believe i'm gonna say this (specially as someone who loves Patrick's voice and energy) but this song needs way more Courtney Love.

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (8): it’s Courtney bitch/the chorus is a bit wonky for me because I always expect it to go a smidge faster and it never does

**fifteensunflwrs** (7): courtney is bae

# PLEASE KEEP YOUR BAD POEMS TO YOURSELF, PATRICK

**Raykel** (4.5): Of all people??? Huh????

**Gwemm** (3): What the hell is that Courtney Love feature?

**modulum83** (3): please god can someone tell courtney love to stop

**Verdantshade** (2): it's courtney bitch.. there's a decent song in there but this is the band that gave us mania

**static\_int\_husp** (0): God, I don't know why but Courtney Love for some reason makes this song the worst part of this rate

And out goes the rate's by far most controversial song-- and its longest! This song was contested as hell by raters, but I personally love it a lot. It's a beautiful and haunting and experimental closer to the Self-Titled record's sound and themes and it really, really resonates with me, even if it's not everyone's cup of tea.

---

# LOOKING FORWARD

**radiofan15** (10): Damn this is great...Really unique and experimental for Paramore... I would have loved if the rest of the album was like this but alas it wasn't mean to be

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The instrumental on this is so raw and cool and it gets a 10 for that alone.

**vhqv1997** (10): Considering most of this song doesn't even have lyrics, I'm shocked that you guys kept this to be rated, but good, because the guitar was crazy and it deserved to be fully appreciated. I know this seems like a weird statement to say but Taylor York is actually my favorite member from Paramore, because the guitar work he does sometimes tends to outshine Hayley's vocals for me, and I know this song is a collaborative efforts but traditionally I have always liked Paramore's instrumentals and this song had a great showcase for it.

**Verdantshade** (9): I remember being obsessed with this song and finding an article on long emo songs and discovering goodbye sky harbour by jimmy eat world, which remains my favourite song longer than 10 minutes. future is no goodbye sky harbour but it's still great, and it's a sound I wish paramore explored further

**1998tweety** (8.5): The artist and the time outsold. Sis u ain't Lana, I'm not gonna listen to this 8 min long song. It was inch resting though so I gave it a high score.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (8): Maybe 4 minutes too long

**hikkaru** (8): this is the exact opposite of the kind of music i like listening to lmao - i'm not going to listen to it if i'm not listening to the album in full, but within that context as a closer? WHEW

# SHIT LET'S GO BACK

**modulum83** (6.5): i don't really like post rock

**fifteensunflwrs** (6): the live version they did on the last parahoy>>>>the studio version

**ignitethephoenix** (5): This is more of a mood than a song. Also did not need to be this long.

**TragicKingdom1** (4): wayyy too long

**realboxwood** (3.5): It sounds like they did this song in one take, realized they didn't actually have nearly enough ideas to fill 7 minutes of song, and then just put it on the album anyways

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (0): seven minutes. Five of which were just a solo.

**waluigiest** (0): long and not in an interesting or iconic way. It overstays its welcome and doesn’t finish the album out at all really. I'm quite disappointed honestly

The first interlude, but the last to exit! Yeah, not surprising these all left swiftly, but I'm still fond of 'em.

# MOVING ON

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (10): I feel like this shouldn’t be my favorite thing so far right? I just really love the angry ukulele aesthetic

**vhqv1997** (10): One big reason why I don't like Paramore as I could is because their songs always end up either lacking a big enough climax or being just a bit heavier, instrumental-wise, than it should to foster an emotional connection. This song, while an interlude, is the first one in this album to make neither mistakes, it just hits all the notes it has to, and that's it, that's all it takes

**\_wailordfan** (9): all of these interludes are so cute

**CarlieScion** (9): these r cute

**waluigiest** (9): the filtered, positive ukulele interlude worked on Panic’s pretty odd, and it works here too. My heart is full.

**Roxieloxie** (8): we love white girl youtubercore

**ignitethephoenix** (7): ukulele once again is giving me YouTube vlog vibes

# NEVER REALLY OVER IT

**modulum83** (6.5): yes girl you are moving on go get it

Danger Days is a good album and there's no true bad songs on it, but this is definitely one of the most forgettable and middle-of-the-road. Not much of note to say about it, IMO.

---

# HOPE IS A DANGEROUS THING FOR POPHEADS LIKE THEM TO HAVE - BUT THEY HAVE IT 

**Verdantshade** (10): mcr does synth rock!!! lyrically one of the stronger songs on danger days, and the way the song builds up makes it one of the most memorable tracks on the album

**radiofan15** (8.7): I feel 17 again listening to this...

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (7.5): today’s lesson is self love

# HOPELESS

**CarlieScion** (7): the verses once again bring the song down

**vhqv1997** (7): Too bad that this song has good instrumentals, but the lyrics feel very clunky and don't flow together as well as they could be, and Gerard's vocals just sound kinda strained instead of emotional

**waluigiest** (7): sweet but wish the songwriting were a bit more interesting

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): A little forgettable

**modulum83** (4.5): this just seems painfully cliche

**ImADudeDuh** (4): pretty basic tbh

And there goes MCR's ode to not doing the Twilight soundtrack! This is, admittedly, a bit of an inconsequential post-credits roll to the album, but it's a blast so it works.

# CAME TO FUCK

**realboxwood** (11): This song makes me feel the way I assume ROTC kids feel when they listen to Eminem

**radiofan15** (10): Punk rock classic and a fantastic closer... I really missed them

**waluigiest** (10): a twilight diss track good enough to be on the twilight soundtrack

**Roxieloxie** (9): fuck capitalism

**vhqv1997** (9): I love this song but I also NEED a Twilight Soundtrack Rate NOW!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): that intro was p iconic

**Verdantshade** (8): SASSY GERARD IS BACK. it's my favourite of the less serious tracks on the album but I'm not sure if its presence makes the album any better

**modulum83** (7): I liked this song much more than I expected to

# MO' VAMPIRE MONEY, MO' VAMPIRE PROBLEMS

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (6): eh, too many ideas but that’s also the aesthetic isn’t it

**Gwemm** (5.6): I like the energy, sounds similar to Na Na Na so I'll give it points for that.

**CarlieScion** (5): this doesn't sound like a closer (besides the awkward intro)

Hey, it's my personal lowest ranking song in the rate! Casual Affair is an odd number that people seem to either love or hate, meanwhile I just...don't really know what to do with this song. I don't hate it but I'd listen to nearly any other P!ATD song over this most of the time.

**Gwemm** (11): This song is THAT good, why do so few people see that? Incredibly underrated.

**Verdantshade** (10): I love the dark sound of the song and I wish brendon had more songs like this. my headcanon is this is about a secret gay relationship

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): Okay I really like the chorus of this song and how warped it sounds. Lyrically it’s kind of empty though.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is weird (which I like), and it kind of works, but I also feel like it could've been pulled off better (with better vocals oop).

**modulum83** (7.5): too edgy

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (7.4): no really what kind of parties do y’all go to

**waluigiest** (7): is this song gay content?

# AN AFFAIR TO FORGET

**radiofan15** (6.5): More than halfway through this album and there's literally only one song that's more than decent.

**Roxieloxie** (6): its kinda empty but i really like the bridge

**/u/alwayswords** (5): im revoking brendon’s autotune permissions

**TragicKingdom1** (0): i cannot point out a single good choice that went into the making of this track

I love the anthemic urgency of this song so so much. Unfortunately, popheads disagrees. :(

# SAVING THE WORLD

**realboxwood** (10): This song blew 11 year old me's mind and tbh it's kind of blowing 21 year old me's mind too

**Verdantshade** (10): this is just such a COOL song. the idgaf attitude and sound make this an essential in their discography - how can you not shout along to 'who gives a damn if we lose the war' and 'you motherfucker'? the chorus is also one of gerard's best vocal performances on the album

**CarlieScion** (9): i really like the beat in this

**fifteensunflwrs** (9): a super underrated bop

**radiofan15** (8.3): I don't know why I never listened to this album outside of 2010 until today, it slaps harder than than Chris Brown to Rihanna's face.

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (8): I understood a fifth of the words, but all the feeling.

**waluigiest** (8): big teen vibes

**modulum83** (6.5): awesome chorus

**Gwemm** (6): Gave it a 6 because I can't give out another 5.

deleted: To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand My Chemical Romance. The writing is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of music theory most of the songs will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Gerard Way's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation-

This song has a dubstep breakdown, which dates it so screamingly and instantly that it threw me off a bit when I first heard it. It's a perfectly serviceable song though, so.

---

# REBORN

**vhqv1997** (10): That dubstep breakdown is iconic

**waluigiest** (10): good writing, fun beats, a dated but effective dubstep bridge? This song is confusing but I really like it. Also note: the way he says baby

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (9): I swear this album doesn’t have a single bad song. This drum line just forces my feet to go along with it.

**Verdantshade** (9): 'so put the d in dirt now baby' haha hahahaha patrick why

**realboxwood** (8): This song is good, except for all the parts of it that are bad

**hikkaru** (7.5): those random wubs ugh wig

**modulum83** (7): token angry let's-blow-shit-up song, and it turns out good

# YEAH, LET'S GO WITH DEATH

**radiofan15** (6.6): I've heard worse songs... but also way way better than this one.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): “put the D in dirt baby” that doesn’t sound healthy.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): filler

This is one of my favourite songs off of Self-Titled; the melody packs a punch and I like any song about being alone with somebody, TBH. It deserves better.
---

# I THINK WE'RE ALONE NOW

**radiofan15** (8.6): I'm quite a sucker for traditional Paramore so I liked this one.

**modulum83** (7.5): big fan of the guitar in this song

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (7): make up your mind do you or do you know want to be alone

# LEAVE YOU LONELY

**Verdantshade** (7): I'm sorry but the only thing I can ever remember from this song is its guitar riff. a good but not great song that the album could have done without

**fifteensunflwrs** (5): this song is known in the paramore fandom for being the worst song in their discography and honestly?? they are kinda right

**waluigiest** (5): I was expecting something stunning after the trend of the last few interlude follow-ups. This is just tired.

A jam! A bop! A blast! Y'all aren't fond of when MCR have fun apparently. Sad to see this head out on Day 1, but I liked it to begin with and it's only grown on me more and more since I decided to host this rate.

---

# GO GO GO!

**radiofan15** (10): Serving disco rock realness with this bop.

**skargardin** (10): I haven't heard this in at least five years and it's still an absolute slapper

**vhqv1997** (10): AN ABSOLUTE BANGER, POINT BLANKT!! GET UP AND GO!! GO WIN THIS RATE!!

**fifteensunflwrs** (8): fun fact my dad onec walked on me jamming to this song and I had to pretend it was kpop so he wouldn't thought of me as an emo little shit

**modulum83** (8): damn I did not expect MCR to write something this dancy

**Raykel** (8): Cyber emo for when emos didn't want to admit to liking pop music yet

# STAYING ON EARTH

**CarlieScion** (6): this album really is. this album.

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (6): I like the energy, i guess. The rest is kinda bleh.

**Verdantshade** (6): I liked this song a LOT when I was 13 and thought it was the coolest thing ever but it has not aged well.. tbf it's impressive that mcr pulled off a dance song, but now I find the chorus really grating and I nearly always skip it

**Gwemm** (5.1): Meh.. I did like the first 25 seconds??

**waluigiest** (5): sounds like a Disney channel B-side

This is...a  perfectly cromulent Elton John cover. It's fun, albeit not exactly life changing.
---
# FIGHT FIGHT

**radiofan15** (10): I didn't knew how much I needed this in my life.

**waluigiest** (9): an ambitious crossover that somehow works! This punky spin is really cool

**modulum83** (5): it's not bad but (1) why are we even rating this and (2) this is not my style of music

# TELL US HOW YOU REALLY FEEL, /U/SAUCYMAC

**Saucymac** (1): Elton John enters the room, excited to chat to the boys and appeal to the youth once again. Taron Egerton is only just finding his fame in Kingsman, so Elton being liked by the young'uns again is still a few years away. Elton slides down his star shaped sunglasses and says "boys, I'm giving you Saturday night". At that, FoB leave without saying a word, their words have not mattered to me since Pete and Ashlee broke up. They stand in the studio, ready to record a straight up banger, but the mood is grim. Patrick has lost his favourite fedora and Pete accidentally dyed his hair this weird white blonde and just isn't fitting the vibe anymore. The other ones are sad because I can't remember their names. Time is money, and they already spent hours looking for his Fedora, so Patrick settles for an old tie he used to wear (and silently says his prayers to the patron saint of useless ties, Avril Lavigne) and they begin to plan this song. "I'm not feeling too cheery today guys," says patrick, looking like a sad emoji, "I'm just not feeling like making this song good without my lucky fedora!". The other ones agree, and so, they try to make this song sound just like a fall out boy song. Elton has a listen, and doesn't quite understand it, but people like Fall out boy so who is he to judge? He releases the song. Many say that Nickelback's version is better. This is how Chad won Avril. This shit fanfic is the only good thing that has come of this absolute garbage cover. If i could give it a 0 I would.

Our last exit of day 1 is Self-Titled's lead single! A shocking blow for r/singlesheads.

---

# NOW!

**hikkaru** (10): THIS AIN'T IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-IIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHISIHSDJLKSFJ

**Raykel** (9): Omg I forgot about this bop! It's the first song from them I got heavily into and introduced me to their rest of their discog. The gut renching 2nd verse, Hayley's out of this world vocals in the bridge omg how did I forget?!

**skargardin** (9): angry banger

**Roxieloxie** (8): I could see this being some sort of opening in a teen movie

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (8): queen of the revolution

**radiofan15** (7.6): Love the lyrics... but I wish the song overall was as strong as the chorus is catchy.

# NEVER 

**1998tweety** (7.5): A flop lead single, I have to laugh

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this reminds me of a PVRIS song in the sense that it doesn't really go anywhere

**modulum83** (5.5): sounds like a generic but nice pop punk song from a 2000s teen movie

**waluigiest** (5): this song waffles around a lot and I don’t think it really takes off. However, the bit where the drums match the vocal run on “no-o-o-ow” is super well done (1:34)

**Verdantshade** (4): this might be the only paramore song I don't enjoy? the verses and bridge are great but the chorus is just annoying. it was a pretty uninspiring first single too

**vhqv1997** (4): The chorus is weak as hell, shame too because the verses are great
