Paramore, Paramore, everything is Paramore and all is nothing. This is a perfectly solid bonus track, but all of Pmore's other bonus tracks from this era are superior.

**radiofan15** (7.8): Why wasn't this on the main album?

**modulum83** (7.5): anthem for leaving it all behind and living your best life

**waluigiest** (7): This is fine. I do love when she wails ‚Äúslowly‚Äù in the bridge tho that‚Äôs very nice

Our first song out on the last day belongs to FOB! I like this song a lot and it's very fun to sing along to. Happy to see it show up this high.

---

# LONERS UNITED

**rotating3Dtext** (10): this corny, catchy shit gets me

**Roxieloxie** (10): I can tell you the first time i ever heard this song in my 10am english class, 7th grade while we were reading romeo and juliet and had to make a class mixtape and my best friend added this song and so we analyzed it one day. I was shook the first time i heard it and 6 years later i can confirm i am still shook with how fucking amazing this is. Its honestly 11 material

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): romance is weird with emo, because it‚Äôs usually either very bitter or too utopic. This one isn‚Äôt, and unlike other emo love songs, it‚Äôs actually good!

**ImADudeDuh** (9): a tepid hit

**ignitethephoenix** (8): ‚Äúmy heart is like a Stallion‚Äù Megan Thee Stallion x FOB confirmed in the future ?

**waluigiest** (8): love the sentiment and the chorus, but the stallion line is not for me

**radiofan15** (7.2): A downgrade but this is cute nonetheless.

# ALONE. NOT WITH ANYBODY JUST ACTUALLY ALONE THANKS

**modulum83** (5): the song is very loud and repetitive and the "yeah!"s get on my nerves but i mean it's not bad per se

**Raykel** (3): Imagine naming an album Save Rock And Roll and making this

**realboxwood** (1): Somebody get those children out of that well!

So glad this song made it this far-- honestly wish I gave it a stronger score! The way Brendon says "your love's a fucking drag" is iconic TBH.

# CHAINSMOKERS

**\_wailordfan** (10): I don't care how unsubtle this is, I love it and is fun to sing along to

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the little warble when he goes NICOTIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE

**modulum83** (10): pure awesomeness. pure fucking awesomeness.

**waluigiest** (10): Almost my 11. ‚Äúyour love‚Äôs a fuckin drag / but I need it so bad‚Äù this song is funky and has strong writing from start to finish.

**alwayswords** (9.5): brendon urie is my vape god

**CarlieScion** (9): BIG BOP

**Verdantshade** (9): this was one of my favourite songs when I was 13 because it was edgy as fuck, so now this song just reminds me of my edgy early teens

**vhqv1997** (7): I'm pretty sure Brendon wrote this song drunk and scrambled to finish it the next morning because the label was questioning him on the full tracklist

# YOUR LOVE'S (THIS SONG) A FUCKIN' DRAG
**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): I‚Äôm using all my willpower to not make a NBTS joke here

**radiofan15** (5.1): This is less subtle than an anti-smoking ad.

**realboxwood** (2): There's a lot of bad songs out there that could be drastically improved by changing only a few elements of it. This is not one of those songs.

IMO, this is the weakest song on Self-Titled, so I'm kinda surprised that it got THIS high. It's not bad though so I suspect it'll grow on me overtime.

---

# THE ONLY PROOF THEY NEED IS THIS SONG

**CarlieScion** (10): this and pool r sister songs

**waluigiest** (10): this is Still Into You‚Äôs pounding, violent love song sibling. While Still Into You is tender and literal, Proof turns it up a notch in both affection and energy. It‚Äôs simultaneously subtle and abrasive. Truly a stunning work of writing and performance.

**Verdantshade** (9): we stan a feminist queen

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): she‚Äôs great at painting a picture. The only issue is that I think she heavily favors abstract pieces

# NEEDS MORE EVIDENCE

**radiofan15** (5.6): This album makes me miss Mistki's music.

**modulum83** (5): ehhhhhhh

If you're wondering "hey, Luna, why didn't you include Tell Me It's Okay in this bonus ranking?", the answer is that I'm a dummy and I forgot! RIP! But here's this HTSYHB remix, which is snazzy for all the same reasons the original is, except with some Joy Williams harmonies! Which adds a bit to it, if nothing else.

---

**moooo566** (10): i love joy williams' voice so much, everyone go stream her solo work

**waluigiest** (9): their voices blend really well, to the point where the differences here are subtle. Both versions of the song are quite nice

**modulum83** (8): the vocal harmonies on this are just gorgeous

**Verdantshade** (8): not something I asked for but I did use to listen to the civil wars quite a lot. more importantly, why aren't we rating tell me I'm okay

**radiofan15** (6.9): So this is Paramore aiming for that CMA trophy...

**fifteensunflwrs** (4): where is tell me it's okay tho :(((

# THE PARTY PEOPLE

**Verdantshade** (9): one of the most fun fall out boy songs? the bassline is to die for

**vhqv1997** (9): The closest thing we get to disco music in this rate

**waluigiest** (9): woah this is pretty funky I‚Äôm impressed

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (8.6): the nananas make a comeback

**radiofan15** (8.1): This is the kind of trashy, white bread commercial pop rock that I like... and that's a compliment.

JUST missing the top 10 is Anklebiters, a self-love tune! I absolutely adore this song and its message really really resonates with me. Fall in love with yourself, popheads!

# SELF LOVE QUEENS

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is my favorite song i've discovered from this rate

**sailormunelune** (10): damn this hits home

**Verdantshade** (10): I LOVE the music video for this and the song never fails to get me dancing. I love after laughter paramore but it makes me sad to think we'll never get songs like these again

**ImADudeDuh** (9): oh she sped it up

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): the sequel to ain‚Äôt it fun

**vhqv1997** (8): Bruh where is the rest of this song

# BITERS OF ANKLES

**radiofan15** (7.7): Cheap and bland but it's quite reminiscent of old good Paramore so I can't hate it that much...

**modulum83** (7.5): catchy but a bit too goofy for me

**Raykel** (7.2): The verses are better than the chorus and I don't know how to feel about that

**1998tweety** (7): A song about midgets

**waluigiest** (7): With a bit more tooth this would be really fuckin good

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): tell me if I‚Äôm wrong, is this song against children? I mean, I can get behind it, but also ???

**waluigiest** (8): Love the instrumentation here. It‚Äôs another band history song and not as great as others on the album, but it‚Äôs still fun.

**radiofan15** (7.7): Seriously, these bonus tracks are better than 2/3 of the songs from the album

**modulum83** (7.5): fun bop

Sitting at the end of our top 10 is Grow Up, one of many odes on Paramore's self-titled about getting your shit together and growing the fuck up! This is a beat-stomper of a song and definitely plays its part in making the front half of this album as strong as it is.

---

# ADULTHEADS

**realboxwood** (9.5): That second verse was always a bad look but my brain is hardwired to stan anything with a long, ruminative, instrumental outro, so it appears we are at an impasse.

**Verdantshade** (9): the mashup with 20 something though.. iconic

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.7): hailey said FUCK PETER PAN

**vhqv1997** (8): The outro is the best part of this song, but the rest of this song has a beautiful instrumentation too

**waluigiest** (8): her melody on the chorus is soooo beautiful

**1998tweety** (7.5): Meh, the outro was nice tho

**modulum83** (7): amazing drums

# STAYING YOUNG

**radiofan15** (6): I have heard this Paramore song like 25 times before.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): so its just Aint It Fun without the awesome hook?

This was very almost my 11, and it deserved it, because this is the best song on the album! It is just so fun and energetic and pulsing, and 100% deserving of a top 10 place.

---

# JOYRIDERS

**Roxieloxie** (10): all of these opening tracks are killer omg

**waluigiest** (10): Stunning. This is what a glow up sounds like. This is a genuine, emotional song about getting through a musical breakup that doesn‚Äôt dwell in bitterness, and it works. Perfect track to open the album.

**fifteensunflwrs** (9): your exemple saying "I want Hayley Williams to run me over with her car" perfectly represents my feelings

**hikkaru** (9): hayley run me over mommy

**Verdantshade** (9): underrated as hell. the guitar and bass are so sexy

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (8.7): would be a solid 9 without that weird spoken word segment out of nowhere

**CarlieScion** (8): this song keeps reminding me of divergent

**ImADudeDuh** (8): ok but be safe

**vhqv1997** (8): I mistyped the title as Fart In My Car on Discord once and I still haven't forgotten it everytime I listen

**modulum83** (7.5): this song makes me want to go fast in my car

**radiofan15** (7.2): Energetic and cute opener...

And we have! Another! Tie! I like Bulletproof Heart but the fact that it's in the top 10 over Party Poison, SCARECROW, DESTROYA, etc., is criminal. Y'all robbed MCR blind, I swear to God.

---

# BULLETPROOF

**hikkaru** (10): this fucking SLAPS, the best song on the album definitely, and while I desperately want a paramore win I would be very satisfied if this pulled through

**Verdantshade** (10): the line 'coming ready or not when the motor gets hot / we can do it again' makes no sense but this is classic mcr updated with their new sound

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This is one of the only songs on this album I really like for some reason. Everything works really well together.

**1998tweety** (9): This is a cute lil bop I think

**fifteensunflwrs** (9): underrated bop

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): stream run away with me (I like last chorus the best, don‚Äôt @ me)

**radiofan15** (8.5): DAE misses them everyday of their miserable and homosexual life?

**waluigiest** (8): unf when the beat comes in it‚Äôs nice. And then the second half slaps

**\_wailordfan** (7.5): it runs on the long side to me, but has a REALLY strong melody. I still run into the issue of not loving the Gerard's voice.

**modulum83** (7.5): has that classic rock/U2 feel, it's mainly in the guitar tones which are gorgeous

**CarlieScion** (7): the intro to this is so bad but the rest of the song bops

# RIDDLED WITH HOLES

**Gwemm** (5): I like part of the chorus but that's about it. It's not a bad song, just not to my taste.

I'M ON FIYAHHHHH! Our other half of the tie with Bulletproof Heart! This song is a pure hype song, but you know what? It serves that purpose to a T. Well played, FOB.

---

# LIGHTING IT UP

**ComeOnPupperfish** (11): I don‚Äôt care this song will probably be one of the first with 11s to go out because popheads can‚Äôt recognize taste. I don‚Äôt care if people call me a slut for singes. My 11 was never leaving this album, and this is my favorite, so why not? MSKWYDITD(LEU) is an amazing example of a song that‚Äôs just fucking pissed. They‚Äôre upset and they‚Äôre not going to sugar coat it. They were gone, and came back to burn bridges, not build them back. And that‚Äôs a style of song there are not enough of, especially one this... complete. The booming drums, the screaming vocals, even the music video is great in my opinion. It‚Äôs just all I want when I want to scream and shout at nothing and everything.

**1998tweety** (10): ugh what a big bop, iconic

**poppinmmolly** (10): The performance they did of this with Taylor Swift in 2013 is really good!

**radiofan15** (10): If MCR wasn't in this rate this would be my 11.

**sailormunelune** (10): never gets old

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I love the theatricality of this. It‚Äôs super fun although in kind of dumbest way.

**modulum83** (9): DARK DARK

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This song goes hard in the gym

**waluigiest** (9): I remember when this song came out the world was truly not ready

**ImADudeDuh** (8): a HIT! most of these other albums can't relate

**Roxieloxie** (8): Im on FIYAHHHHHHHHH

**fifteensunflwrs** (6): fun fact I used to hate this song on my (shortlived) christian phase because I thought it was satanic

# IN THE DARK

**vhqv1997** (3): What does this song really have going for it aside from the fact it is catchy?

**realboxwood** (2): It's almost impressive how not a single thing about this song works.

# WAVING THE WHITE FLAG

**1998tweety** (10): The lyrics on this are kind of chessy but WOW it bops

**hikkaru** (10): BANGER

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Oh my fucking GOD what a good fucking song.

**modulum83** (10): heEEEEEEEY YOUNGBLOOD

**Roxieloxie** (10): So i associate half of this album with second semester 7th grade and the other half with the week i spent in New york for the first time and this song just brought me back in the best possible way.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): this is such a strong opener, and a great hype up song in general

**vhqv1997** (10): You guys need to stop paying this song dust and also stop supporting its inferior version, which is the one that plays immediately after this.

**Verdantshade** (9): this is a contender for best opening track along with disloyal order - disloyal order may be the better song but nothing gets you more hyped than the phoenix

**waluigiest** (9): the energy and momentum that this has was truly iconic in 2013

**alwayswords** (8.5): novocaine outsold

**agentofscranton** (8.5): this came out around the same time as the song Ill Manors by Plan B and both had basically the same intro, so it was always a fun guessing game whenever it came on as to which song you'd get

**radiofan15** (7.7): Damn I'm not sure if i like this song but the energy and the symphonic elements are really enticing.

**Gwemm** (7.5): Like the song, but the remix/phoenix rhyme is a bit cringe.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Kind of bops, kind of tries to be too hard

# Save Rock And Roll

---

**Overall Average**: 7.452 **// Average Controversy:** 1.766

---

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9.318): this is gonna be my highest average and it honestly deserves it, this album is a fucking experience and a masterpiece.

**CarlieScion** (8.455): Did nobody sit these guys down and tell them that making a visual album where a group of hot young girls are trying to destroy ROCK music, led by COURTNEY fucking LOVE, was a bad idea???

**waluigiest** (8.091): I had never listened to a Fallout Boy album before, but I‚Äôd already heard most of these songs because of how culturally important their comeback was. Very solid album.

**vhqv1997** (8.091): This album was how I was introduced to Fall Out Boy. The Young Blood Chronicles was very cringey at times but I couldn't deny that my deprived young self was very into screaming aloud about the world's minor inconveniences. I don't believe this was their strongest efforts, since Folie a Deux and American Beauty/American Psycho kinda blows this one out of the water, but it's a very concrete and admirable effort to regroup and I have to applaud them for still keeping this kind of energy after all those years.

**radiofan15** (8.000): Even if I didn't loved most of it, I was surprised of how engaging and entertaining was the whole album overall... also, Patrick can Stump on me and spit on my face and call me a f*ggot and I will be happy begging for more. [Score: B]

**Verdantshade** (7.545): in light of mania, this album has aged very well. it's filled with pop bangers front to back and would definitely have been better received if people were prepared for the change in music

**Gwemm** (7.118): Starts off strong, but definitely falls off at the last 3 songs.

**modulum83** (6.773): Gonna give a hot take here and say that this is my least favorite post-hiatus FOB album. AB/AP has brighter and catchier pop hooks, and MANIA is great out of sheer wackiness. It feels like all this album wants to be is huge and loud. They went straight for hip-hop influenced stadium rock, and it's...just not really doing it for me. Some great songs and some great moments, but they'd get better at working with pop rock on the later records.

**realboxwood** (6.500): This album is pretty peak Fall Out Boy, in that it's incredibly inconsistent and kind of obnoxious but still an enjoyable listen. Although having their older stuff come on after this album was done made their severe downslide into Imagine Dragons levels of awful production more apparent, which soured the listening experience a bit.

**TragicKingdom1** (5.773): I remember this being a big comeback for Fall Out Boy and even the flop singles doing sort of well in the pop music community, but this does not hold up in the face of recent pop/rock with much more polished production. Everything just feels so muddy and textureless, and it causes every song to blend together into a mush of Patrick yelling "OH!!". There are a few mild bops though so it's not the worst thing we've ever rated. [Grade: C+]

Coming in at #5 is Last Hope, the last non-single! This song is really beautiful and lovely and was actually winning the rate for a surprising amount of time, so it definitely really earned its place here.

---

# STILL HOPING

**CarlieScion** (11): This probably isn‚Äôt going to win, but this song makes me feel things I didn‚Äôt think I could feel. I‚Äôm very salty I didn‚Äôt get to see Paramore live when they still did this song.

**skargardin** (11): Going into this rate I thought that my 11 would go to one of the obvious singles but this one hits very hard. Well-deserving of an 11, yall better not let it flop.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): this shit makes me cry

**Verdantshade** (10): the official live video of this song has got to be one of hayley's best performances. the album is filled with emotions and last hope has to be the centrepiece of it all

**hikkaru** (9): i'm crying in the club

**Raykel** (9): This was my damn anthem sophomore year omg

**waluigiest** (9): I am going to wake up and work on improving myself.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Sad gurl hours here

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): this song is really beautiful lyrically. It sounds lovely. It‚Äôs also two minutes too long.

**radiofan15** (7.6): Cuter than the previous songs... but I know it's not gonna last...

**Roxieloxie** (7): go off emotionally haley

# HOPELESS 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO

**modulum83** (6.5): sad acoustic beginning was really good then it turned into pop punk.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): eh

Th√≠s song is just so much riotous fucking FUN, it's absolutely infectious. It's the perfect representative for the Danger Days era of MCR and IMO well-deserving of being the highest-ranking MCR song in this rate. Shut up and lemme see your jazz hands!

---

# KILLJOYS, MAKE SOME NOISE!

**Raykel** (11): This kick started my lol random xD phase

**vhqv1997** (11): Is there any better song to go psycho to? God, this song is exactly why I love My Chemical Romance, they just infuse their songs with so much energy and punk that you can't help but scream along to and go crazy with it. While some people may have a problem with the production, I feel like for this one song it actually improves the nostalgic quality of the song, reminding everyone of your edgy teenage years, when everything was just you vs the world.

**waluigiest** (11): this song is near and dear to my heart. The title riff is a nice constant, the way it flows is beautiful, I LOVE the bridge with the guitars and all. It‚Äôs just so well constructed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ shut up and lemme see your jazz hands :‚Äô)

**1998tweety** (10): I remember hearing this in a Homestuck AMV which I bopped to a lot, so I'm giving it a 10 solely based on that nostalgia.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): these lyrics are highkey nothing but i still stan nevertheless

**moooo566** (10): look alive sunshine is iconic and i'm really goddamn disappointed in you for not letting me rate it separately, but this song is excellent on its own too i guess

**sailormunelune** (10): such a strong opening song

**radiofan15** (9.5): Thanks to u/vhqv1997 now I know Gerard says NA 180 times in this song.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.7): Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): This song is hella dumb but I kinda like it.

**Roxieloxie** (8.3): Oh a concept album you say, the Green day fan in me is intrigued

**Gwemm** (8): It's a bop, and that transition from Look Alive, Sunshine is so good.

**Verdantshade** (8): it's a banger and a half but my god this is a lyrical mess. also when I was 11 and trying to find na na na by one direction on youtube this song kept popping up (little did I know that in 2 years mcr would be one of my favourite bands)

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Batman?

**modulum83** (7): campy as all hell, but I respect that

**CarlieScion** (6): insert spider-pig joke

lunasaflowers: # Danger Days

---

**Overall Average**: 7.290 **// Average Controversy:** 1.722

---

**realboxwood** (9.333): It's no The Black Parade, but neither is any other album in this rate, so. While it might be a little corny sometimes, I think the heart MCR possessed has and will continue to age a lot better than Pete Wentz' and Brendan Urie's galaxy sized egos and enduring commitments to trying to prove they're the smartest person in the room. You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself make shittily compressed pop-rock, I guess.

**radiofan15** (8.883): The Black Parade outsold but this is nice too... specially as a last chapter of their somewhat short-lived career; the production in this album could be cleaner but this rawness gives it certain edge that fits quite well with the concept of the album... [Score: A-]

**vhqv1997** (8.542): To be honest I was a huge advocate of this album when this rate was announced. I remembered all the classic hits that this piece of record spawned when it came out and I thought that I would love the full album too, but it turns out that this was an uneven record that was marred by the production. A few songs blend together easily and not all of them were memorable. The ones that were did stand out a lot, but I doubt that MCR would dominate this rate like they did in their previous appearance. Nevertheless, I would still consider this album a triumph and a good note for this part of their career to end on.

**Verdantshade** (8.333): it's probably my least favourite mcr album, but it's not a bad one. it's just very different - gerard's passionate, manic vocal performances aren't as present, and the heavy guitar riffs and solos have been replaced by simple power chords. it's not a bad thing, as danger days is a fun album with a cool concept, but I can't help thinking it would be a better album if some of the less serious songs were replaced by songs from conventional weapons.

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (7.942): come through concept album

**fifteensunflwrs** (7.917): a underrated gem

**waluigiest** (7.500): I think this album is the weakest of the rate, but it‚Äôs still got some major highlights.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.875): This doesn't feel like it's in the same sonic category as the other albums in this rate because it defintely leans more on the rock side of things rather than pop. That makes it less of my cup of tea but this is still a much more polished experience than the other albums here. The middle blends together to me but I can appreciate the power from the other songs. [Grade: B]

**modulum83** (6.333): The highlight of this album for me is the guitar work, which is superb and creative and really makes all the songs soar. Danger Days is a fun album that revels in its action-movie anime-styled campiness with fast-paced punk rock that evokes the desert on its cover with its dryness and widescreen scale. The album as a whole is decent - there's good songwriting, but in the end their melodrama and more punky sound from the rest of the albums here would never be for me.

**Gwemm** (5.633): Third listen through... just can't get into it man. Maybe I missed my time to listen to and appreciate MCR?

It fought the good fight, but ultimately Panic! At The Disco could not hold against the sheer power of Paramore and this sub's love for women. This song, inspired by now former band member Spencer Smith's struggle with drug addiction, is popular with good reason, and it's no surprise it made it this far. But if you love me, let me go, and so...

# GOSPEL

**Far2Young2Die** (11): Easily the prettiest and best sounding song on this list. Very good lyrics in my opinion.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): It's iconic, what else can I say?

**alwayswords** (10): made me christian

**agentofscranton** (10): this is such a phenomenal song and brendon's talents really shine. it sucks though cause this would be such an easy 11 in any other rate

**CarlieScion** (10): the piano version of this is an 11 but this is great too

**Roxieloxie** (10): Say what you want about modern panic but they always have really good opening tracks.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): if you love me let me GOOOOOOOOOOOO

**vhqv1997** (10): The piano version of this song would have gotten an 11 from me

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): ‚Äúif you love me let me GOOOOOOOOO‚Äù I just love that part and the chorus so much it makes the song a lot better than it is.

**fifteensunflwrs** (9): pretty much the only "post-everyone-leaving" panic track I can stand

**modulum83** (9): iconic

**waluigiest** (9): god his voice!!! I like when he yell :V

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): the chorus is the best part

**radiofan15** (7.5): Vine teas with this song.

# ALL MY FRIENDS ARE HEATHENS THO

**Gwemm** (6): It's alright; never was a sucker for this one.

**Verdantshade** (6): this is a crime to admit but I don't like this song. I don't not like it either, which sums up my feelings towards the album as a whole. the lyrics are pretentious nonsense but this was one of brendon's better vocal performances at the time. it's just another pop song, I guess?

# Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To Die!

---

**Overall Average**: 7.349 **// Average Controversy:** 1.857

---

**waluigiest** (8.200): Somehow, this album has grown on me. It came out while I was in high school and I remember being very underwhelmed. Now, I have such an appreciation for the writing on a lot of the album cuts. It doesn‚Äôt have the absolute highs like some of their older albums but it is honestly a solid project.

**modulum83** (8.150): I am an absolute sucker for any dark dancy synth-drenched 80s pop and this album is one of my favorites. It perfectly encapsulates the feeling of partying hard and being young in the seedy blinding lights of Vegas. My only wish is that the songs were longer.

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (7.530): maybe I just don‚Äôt like to party! at the disco

**Gwemm** (7.510): Their best album tbh.

**Verdantshade** (7.200): this is the only panic album I'm indifferent towards (and imo their last decent one, as I didn't like death of a bachelor much). it has some good songs and bad songs, but really foreshadows the rise of brendon! at the disco

**radiofan15** (6.320): Maybe they're not just for me... [Score: C]

**TragicKingdom1** (5.100): I'm very confused by this album. I feel like it's simultaneously too poppy and not poppy enough. A lot of it just feels like autotuned droning over generic pop/rock, which isn't inherently bad, but it doesn't ever come remotely close of reaching a deeper meaning of a band like The 1975. I'm not surprised it took them a few more albums to make their comeback. [Grade: C]

**realboxwood** (4.200): After how amazing the first three songs were, I started to worry that this album had secretly been fantastic the entire time and I just hadn't recognized it's greatness. Then Girl That You Love started and I remembered no lol this album is boring as shit. There's some really compelling instrumentation on here, but it's buried in songs that go nowhere and only serve to highlight Brendan Urie's complete inability to write lyrics that have any sense of urgency or impact. At least it was only 30 minutes, if this was as long as Paramore or Danger Days I'd have snapped.

Don't go crying to your mama, popheads, because this song is only #2! Our top 2 battled it out for most of the rate's duration, but in the end...

---

**agentofscranton** (11): this is - hands down - my favourite song of all time. no other song can inspire such a whirlwind of emotions in me like ain't it fun. I remember hearing it for the first time and being just absolutely gripped by how fun the song was but at the same time it spoke to me on a deeply personal level. so yeah, no contest, this was always going to be my 11 and I really really hope it wins

**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): Oddly enough, this is probably the least emo-sounding song in the rate

**effervescentemu** (11): A timeless bop that simultaneously captures both the exhilaration and anxiety that accompanies growing up.

**hikkaru** (11): The xylophone riff? Absolutely infectious. The synth production that proves Paramore works amazingly in the realm of pop? Brilliant. The gospel choir? Took me to church and simultaneously took my wig clean off my head. What an ANTHEM, one of their best songs, by far the best song in this rate, and one of the best hits of the decade as far as I'm concerned!

**JunkyGS** (11): The song has such a beautiful dissonance between the up beat production & the lyrics that hit you in the gut. I love just about everything about this song and consider it timeless. The don‚Äôt go crying to your mama bridge and the overall attitude of ‚ÄúBitch you thought?‚Äù.

**Lightyearsaway** (11): Barely edged out Still Into You

**rosecoloreds** (11): invented funk

**rosesmp3** (11): it is not indeed fun living in the real world but this song really is so i guess it's ok

**rotating3Dtext** (11): amazing, relatable song (also this is proto after laughter)

**static\_int\_husp** (11): This is just pure, fun pop rock.

**1998tweety** (10): Excellence, this is great but please put your 11s on Stil Into You since its better.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): obv 10

**sailormunelune** (10): this was an instant classic

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (10): fucking classic, the video is also really fun

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This song is definitely deserving of a (their only) Grammy. Such a good blend of music genres. They deserve more than 1 Grammy though smh

**modulum83** (9): the greatest go-fuck-yourself bop in history

**waluigiest** (9): unfortunately, it is not. After releasing their sophomore record Some Nights, fun. went on an indefinite hiatus. Nate Ruess released a flop album full of yelling, Jack Antonoff became a main pop girl, and Andrew Dost.

**radiofan15** (8.6): Overrated but kinda cute... also, that gospel choir is everything.

**Roxieloxie** (8): This would be a ten but it looses 2 points for bringing back memories of playing this in band for our 8th grade graduation, or rather i didnt get to play because when they brought our stuff over they left my guitar

**Verdantshade** (8): I'm gonna be honest, I don't like the choir and the clapping. I do think the song is good and I do enjoy soul music but I feel it lacks the 'oomph' of a paramore song. but if the song is playing you can bet I'll be singing along to every word

**vhqv1997** (8): It's weird to use a choir in a rock song like this, but they made it work, they really did. I just wish they had put more efforts into the repetitive chorus.

**Far2Young2Die** (3): Cool music video, but the song is just so... bland, in my opinion.

OUR RATE WINNER! But is it a surprise, really? There's probably nothing more popheads than a good euphoric silly love song, and Still Into You is the epitome of that. This song is adorable, a great single, and after six years since Self-Titled, it seems that after all this time, popheads are still into Still Into You. Some things just make sense, and one of them is us and this song! <3

---

**/u/alwayswords** (11): i loved this song when the album first came out and i still love it now :despair:

**1998tweety** (11): Wow what a tune, this bops so so hard. The chorus is super catchy, but the verses aren't bad either.

**\_wailordfan** (11): Please play the studio recording of it during the reveal.

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): One of the first Paramore songs I heard in full, Still Into You never gets old to me! I really like the drums in the chorus, Hayley's vocals are great, and I pretty much just like everything about this song! My favorite part has to be the bridge, especially the instrumental that leads up to Hayley's vocals.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): The song is just pure joy and holds up so well still. A perfect blend of pop and rock.

**jlim201** (11): this is one of my favourite choruses in any song ever, and after all this time, I'm still into this song

**letsallpoo** (11): some things just make sense

**moooo566** (11): still my fave, sorry hard times

**sailormunelune** (11): It never gets old

**Saucymac** (11): I love how perfectly this song represents that honeymoon phase of love. The abrupt start is a really cute representation of how love can hit you, the giddiness of the verse gives you that silly happy feeling when things are going well. idk its a presh song!

**TragicKingdom1** (11): my 11 by a wide margin, truly a flawless pop song. one day a few weeks ago my local radio station played this twice in a row for some reason and that was a GOOD day

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (11): This song is the definition of perfect pop. Best song in the album, and the rate, for sure.

**CarlieScion** (10): this is the biggest most cutest song of all time

**hikkaru** (10): :comfy:

**ImADudeDuh** (10): probably the winner since we're on POPheads

**modulum83** (10): that chorus SOARS

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (10): I‚Äôm still into you, I can barely breathe

**Verdantshade** (10): we don't get enough happy hayley and it's all she deserves! it's a top tier pop song and I really feel this song doesn't get the love it should get from fans. also fuck chad

**waluigiest** (10): this song made me believe in love

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): me at my current ex bf :eyes:

**Raykel** (8.5): This walked so After Laughter could run

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): good, not relatable song

**vhqv1997** (7): I prefer the kind of pop on After Laughter but this one is okay nonetheless

**Far2Young2Die** (6.5): Probably the best on the album, also the most pop-sounding one in my opinion.

**radiofan15** (5.3): This would never fail to sound like a Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam reject for me...

# Paramore

---

**Overall Average**: 7.679 **// Average Controversy:** 1.797

---

**Verdantshade** (8.471): easily paramore's most underrated album, but there's not really a bad song on it (though I don't like now). it's fantastic as a post-farros record (experimenting with their sound was inevitable anyway) and even the bonus tracks are fucking good

**realboxwood** (8.147): I think it makes sense that Paramore are the only band in this rate who have been able to properly age out of their emo label and continue making great work, and this album is definitely the starting point for that. Unfortunately this relative classiness on their part also means they sometimes make stuff that's just... kinda boring. If you trimmed the fat off of this album you could probably get an incredibly tight, Rumours-esque piece, one that more effectively utilizes their coming-of-age themes and public band drama than this. But as it is, it's a decidedly mixed and slightly overstuffed bag.

**waluigiest** (7.941): There are some AMAZING cuts on this album. I love the way they blend punky sounds with baroque pop-esque elements. That being said, the album is really long and its brought down a bit by the filler. If they cut like 5 tracks and had a better conclusion, it would be an outstanding album. Still a fantastic project.

**vhqv1997** (7.588): Going into this album, my biggest problem with it is that it is long as heck and hell. Very few albums with this kind of length can justify it since most of the times we can erase at least one or two songs. But I was surprised honestly, because most of these songs sound the same so how could you leave out any. I am clearly not the target audience for this album, despite the fact that I love Brand New Eyes and After Laughter, so I know my scores are harsh, but that's how I feel about it: an uneven lengthy collection of songs that tend to blend together with oftentimes weak lyrics and structures but nevertheless strong energy and vocal performance.

**fifteensunflwrs** (7.529): one of their weakest albuns but I still love it

**u/ComeOnPupperfish** (7.476): maybe I didn‚Äôt give this album much of a chance because it was late but GOD did I keep checking the time because these songs are super long

**modulum83** (7.235): This album definitely exceeded my expectations. There's just the right mix of new wave elements and colorful accents in the music combined with hard guitars and rock sensibilities, and it's definitely fun to listen to. Adding to the fun is the overarching theme of the album about moving on from hardship and finding your own identity which makes for ups and downs in emotion throughout. There's a lot of ideas to take in with Paramore, but it's all executed with a sense of confidence and energy that I admire.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.382): This album has conclusively given me the hot take that Paramore is one of the most overrated artists on this subreddit. Hayley's voice just can't make up for the fact that their music often combines a lack of depth with putting way too much reliance on their monotonous production. When they snap they snap, but on the majority of their tracks they feel like they're phoning it in. [Grade: B-]

**radiofan15** (5.865): This album is Paramore trying to reinvent themselves and reintroducing themselves to a changing musical landscape that changed a lot since they became popular... and I admire them for that, but this album is way too disjointed and tiring and underdeveloped that at the end it doesn't matter what they did right because it gets overshadowed with all of those throwaway songs that populates this album. [Score: C-]

**Gwemm** (5.353): Never listened to the album before this rate.
