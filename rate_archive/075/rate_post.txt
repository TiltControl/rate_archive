Emo Rate II: The Re-Up
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/cl7lir/emo_rate_ii_the_reup/

*My Chemical Romance. Panic! At The Disco. Fall Out Boy. Paramore.*

*Long ago, the four pop punk bands who all broke out into the mainstream in the mid-2000s with big hits and Hot Topic emo-friendly images lived in harmony.*

*Then, everything changed when the 2010s attacked.*

WELCOME, one and all, to the **Emo Rate II: The Re-Up**! Back in the not-so-ye-olde days of r/popheads, /u/ffourthofjuly hosted the original [Emo Rate](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5lg43f/rate_the_emo_rate_the_black_parade_v_a_fever_you/), which rated the aforementioned holy quartet of bands at their commercial breakthroughs. Here, we're bringing back the gang to have a look into their differing dabblings into poppier tones and sounds at the onset of the decade now coming to a close. I, /u/lunasaflowers, spent many a day in the early-to-mid 2010s scrolling through my Tumblr dashboard listening to playlists featuring songs from these albums, so I am incredibly excited to invite you all in ranking the cream of the crop of these tunes and finding our collective favourites! There will be blood, and I can't wait!

Let's have a look at our contestants!

# Danger Days: The True Lives Of The Fabulous Killjoys - My Chemical Romance

The fourth and final :( full-length album from New Jersey rockers My Chemical Romance, this album is the odd duck of this rate, being the only album here that wasn't released in 2013, instead arriving in late November 2010. Coming four years after their previous and most well-known album, The Black Parade, Danger Days also adopts a conceptual bent, with its storyline following a a group of outsiders known as the Fabulous Killjoys fight against a people-controlling corporation in a city in post-apocalyptic California set in the year...2019. (Gerard and the gang weren't far off, TBF.) While very much still a rock album, Danger Days takes on a rather different sonic palette to the previous three MCR records, taking its inspiration from protopunk and psychedelic rock bands of the 60s and 70s to create something with a more dance-y, power pop, upbeat sound and more colourful style.

The album charted at number 8 on the Billboard 200 and produced 6 singles in total, the most successful being "Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)" and "SING", which garnered popularity thanks to it being covered in an episode of Glee.

**NOTE:** For presumably obvious reasons, the spoken Steve Montano interludes "Look Alive, Sunshine", "Jet-Star and the Kobra Kid/Traffic Report", and "Goodnite, Dr. Death" will not be rated.

1. Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)
2. Bulletproof Heart
3. SING
4. Planetary (Go!)
5. The Only Hope For Me Is You
6. Party Poison
7. Save Yourself, I'll Hold Them Back
8. S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W
9. Summertime
10. DESTROYA
11. The Kids From Yesterday
12. Vampire Money

# Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To Die! - Panic! At The Disco

Another fourth album, this Hunter S. Thompson quote-named LP would not be the final album released by Panic! At The Disco, but this album *is* the final foray of Panic! At The Disco as a band in the studio and not just the solo work of Brendon Urie, as this is the last album to feature Spencer Smith on drums and the only album to feature Dallon Weekes as a not-just-touring member on bass. Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To Die! is another moment of eclectic variance in the discography of Panic!, with a sound inspired by the electronic music of Depeche Mode and Kraftwerk and an ethos influenced by hip-hop and dance. The lyrics on this album are influenced by multiple aspects of frontman Brendon Urie's life: his changing relationship with his hometown of Las Vegas, experiences with clubbing and old hookups, and his recent marriage to his wife, Sarah. It's described as Panic!'s "party record", and that's certainly an accurate summation of its sound.

Hitting #2 on the Billboard 200, Too Weird To Live produced some of P!ATD's most well-known singles, including "Miss Jackson", "This Is Gospel", and "Girls/Girls/Boys".

1. This Is Gospel
2. Miss Jackson (feat. LOLO)
3. Vegas Lights
4. Girl That You Love
5. Nicotine
6. Girls/Girls/Boys
7. Casual Affair
8. Far Too Young To Die
9. Collar Full
10. The End Of All Things

# Save Rock And Roll - Fall Out Boy

February 2nd, 2013: Pete Wentz essentially tells Fall Out Boy fans to not hold their breath for an upcoming, very-soon reunion. February 4th, 2013: Fall Out Boy releases "My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark (Light 'Em Up)", a big and brash single that serves as the first prelude to their triumphant return from a hiatus that began in 2009, resulting in their fifth album in April, the braggadociously-named Save Rock And Roll. The sessions for Save Rock And Roll involved contributions from every member of the band, with an intention to revamp their sound to something more modern and massive. Much like its pre-hiatus predecessor, Folie √Å Deux, Fall Out Boy recruits a host of wildly varying features on this album, from Big Sean to Courtney Love to Foxes to Elton John on the closer.

Fall Out Boy's intention to come back with a bang succeeded, as Save Rock And Roll scored them their 2nd Billboard 200 #1. While FOB technically only released 4 singles for this album, music videos were made for all 11 songs on the album with a continuous storyline running through each of them, all together forming "The Youngblood Chronicles".

1. The Phoenix
2. My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark (Light 'Em Up)
3. Alone Together
4. Where Did The Party Go
5. Just One Yesterday (feat. Foxes)
6. The Mighty Fall (feat. Big Sean)
7. Miss Missing You
8. Death Valley
9. Young Volcanoes
10. Rat A Tat (feat. Courtney Love)
11. Save Rock And Roll (feat. Elton John)

# Paramore - Paramore

Another fourth album, and another April 2013 release, this self-titled album followed a time of hardship in a band which has had many of them, with the chilly departure of founding members Josh and Zac Farro in 2010 influencing the album's lyrics. The recording process of this album, drawing on power pop and 1980s new wave, was something of a cleansing process for the now three piece of Hayley Williams, Taylor York, and Jeremy Davis, with the band claiming the decision to self-title this album stemming from a desire to reintroduce the band to the world and themselves. Critics praised the experimentation Paramore undertakes on this album, leading to it being placed on numerous year-end lists and paving the way for further exploration of new wave on the band's next album, After Laughter.

Self-Titled proved a huge success for Paramore commercially, with fourth single Ain't It Fun peaking at #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 (Paramore's highest-ever ranking single) and winning a Grammy for Best Rock Song, making frontwoman Hayley Williams the first woman to score said award since Alanis Morissette in 1999. Ain't It Fun and other single Still Into You were both certified double platinum by the RIAA, making Self-Titled Paramore's first album to have more than one double platinum single.

1. Fast In My Car
2. Now
3. Grow Up
4. Daydreaming
5. Interlude: Moving On
6. Ain't It Fun
7. Part II
8. Last Hope
9. Still Into You
10. Anklebiters
11. Interlude: Holiday
12. Proof
13. Hate To See Your Heart Break
14. (One Of Those) Crazy Girls
15. Interlude: I'm Not Angry Anymore
16. Be Alone
17. Future
