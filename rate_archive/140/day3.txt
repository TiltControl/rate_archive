All Stars 5 Reveal Day 3: Are We Gonna Be Alright?
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/t2twzk/all_stars_5_reveal_day_3_are_we_gonna_be_alright/

# Good morning to all who are feeling good about the results today!

Welcome to The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Popheads History, also known as the **last day of the All Stars 5 reveal**! It has been nothing but a pleasure, and I hope this last day is as fun as the other two! Today, we'll be closing out the rate, revealing #26 - #1, starting officially at 2PM EST (that's in an hour)! Join us in the [beatsense room](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj#/) where a bunch of shenanigans are about to go down, including hints, the songs themselves, as well as some interludes when I find right! But- now, for some statistics!

* All Stars 5 had a total of [116](https://pastebin.com/cE5P9DMA) participants- (that’s one more than yesterday!), claps for all of you and you are now my favorites.
* The average score was 7.988, and the average controversy was 1.954! Anything over this can be considered controversial!

the fact they made it to day 3 is a surprise on itself, was anyone expecting this?

---

#cowrote their success

**TiltControls** (11): maybe I'm setting myself up for misandry and this leaving day 1, but of all the 11 potential songs in the rate (and there were many!) this is the winner. There's such a relaxing vibe to this song I've always loved and I'm excited that if I submit fast enough it'll hold a day 3 spot for 3 ballots before dropping back down again

**2dina3dworld** (10): On Melancholy Hill is one of those songs that just has a huge emotional impact on me. The romantic “let’s be alone together” lyrics, combined with the synths, is a recipe for a song that makes you feel like you’re lucid dreaming, and plus if you relate to it it hits really hard. The thing about love is that sometimes it’s full of yearning for what could be, for what you want to show someone, or experience with someone. That’s where On Melancholy Hill gets me in the jugular, and I suppose it also gets me when the bell hits, and there’s a feeling of finality and loss that hangs in the air. But the thing about life is that sometimes, it may feel like the book has ended, that it’s over and this is it, but it hasn’t. They could come back, or you could learn how to be a happier person without them. Whatever you want.

**akanewasright** (10): I associate this song with a point in time where I really, really missed someone, and this song felt like a hug to me when I needed one

**Awkward\_King** (10): im coming out as british

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I fear for what the Swifties are going to do to this.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): never forget what Gorillaz went through in this rate

**bridgemoney** (10): Such a close candidate for my 11.

**camerinian** (10): for the love of god the Damon Albarn discourse better not sink this absolute dreamy gem

**emayzee** (10): the tension of me giving 10s to both taylor swift and gorillaz songs

**frogaranaman** (10): pretty beautiful despite its heterosexuality

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is so good, this would have been on the *Warioware* soundtrack

**homestarguy** (10): The synths sound like a haze designed to put you into a trance. That hook is so delightfully simple yet hypnotic. And Damon's vocals are so comforting. Perfect synthpop.

**IdiotBox01** (10): Damon Albarn sends his regards

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I really don’t get why people who don’t make pop music tend to create some of the best pop songs ever

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I remember I listened to this in middle school

**jman457** (10): I'm honestly just terrified how the swifties will tank this

**ReallyCreative** (10): it makes me feel like dying but in the like, giving yourself up for humanity/turning in to the moon trope kind of way

**runaway3212** (10): like a perfect symphony of sound, almost made me forgive the NFT stuff

**SinfulAnarchy** (10): one of the most uniquely beautiful songs in the rate

**skargardin** (10): Kind of one of my favourite songs of all time if im honest

**Stryxen** (10): it’s a banger really

**thedoctordances1940** (10): just amazing luv

**UselessTacooo** (10): one of my favorite Gorillaz tracks, and I think for good reason

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I didn’t do this rate but I listened to it after the fact and I actually thought Plastic Beach was pretty good. Also this song is beautiful

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): biggest grower of any song in the rate

**bbfan132** (9): very good song!!

**CarlieScion** (9): i think u will be able to tell which ballots came in pre/post january 24th based on the comments

**throwaway-7650** (9): I overrated this a tad in HCP tbh but still a bop

**seanderlust** (8.7): nobody tell the swifties who is behind this band i really want it to do well

**jsonphile** (8.5): okay swifties please be nice

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Don't tell the swifties this is Damon Albarn

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Taylor Swift

**ignitethephoenix** (8): will anyone tank this for Taylor? I just want to know

**majid** (8): slay

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): time for another picky producer moment: kinda wish the autotuned warbling in the background was properly in key but whatever, still a good song

**ricki** (8): gorillaz doesnt write their own songs

**Roxieloxie** (8): [that guy] sure picked a melancholy hill to die on

#swifties

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): dreamy

**trixiematthell** (7.2): this song helped me make friends once??? lmao

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.1): It sounds nice but also I kinda don’t feel anything from it…

**jasannn** (7): why does the intro sound like Last Christmas

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I've literally only ever heard that one Gorillaz song so this was a pleasant surprise

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): lowkey im haunted by the fact that if i had raised my score for on melancholy hill by just a single point this song would have beat impossible soul in the hcp rate. so im giving it the score that would’ve helped it beat impossible soul this time around

**vayyiqra** (7): These poor guys can't win in our rates but then they were (and are) up against some stiff competition.

**waluigiest** (7): swifties about to tank this song

**sweetnsaursauce11** (6.5): this makes me wish summer could start over again

**BasedButta** (6): accurate song title of the rate

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it’s cute

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.5): the melody is nice but not for the full 4 minutes

**jaztinax** (5): boring

**anothertown** (4): ??

**wavingwolves** (2.5): every time i listen to any gorillaz song it just makes me... not want to do it ever agan

**NotWith10000Men** (1.2): sounds bad in my earholes sorry

And now, for them! MagBay is already probably going to get an undeserved rate win later this year, so I'm fine with them finishing at top25. This song was one of my favorites from that EP, but I found it a bit underwhelming as a whole.

---

#is this song about love

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I get their hype, this is so good

**akanewasright** (10): This is lowkey attached to one of the best moments in a piss poor year for me. It was my first mag bay song, and I heard it at the ph club rose event. It slapped and was like… the closest thing I’d come to being at a really fun party in so long.

**bbfan132** (10): LOVED hearing this live the other night!!!!!!!! such a great song

**bo\_g\_o** (10): mercurial world AOTY

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I really enjoy songs that toy with the weird interplay of violence (the lyrical content) and innocence (the sweet but somewhat dead-in-the-eyes vocals) and sexuality (the way it’s about cum), and the production on this track really is to die for.

**hikkaru** (10): magdalena SLAY. smart of the hosts to send this after their album increased their stock on the subreddit so much

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorite Mag bay songs

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Jessie and Róisín don't stand a chance against this banger

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Sexy anime edits won

**iniekcja\_** (10): Alexis P Bevels CUM! haha

**jman457** (10): They were truly in their creative bag this whole time, huh

**just\_thonking** (10): My insurance should go up every time I play this in the car

**MrMoodle** (10): everyone on the original rate was saying this was about cum which i absolutely did not pick up on but knowing that bumps this to a 10

**mudkip1** (10): it was fun hosting this rate!!! Love you /u/kappyko

**nicolas<3** (10): aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

**plastichaxan** (10): i wondered if they were ever gonna top this and then they released Chaeri

**qazz23** (10): love this dark synthpop sound

**RandomHypnotica** (10): cum

**ReallyCreative** (10): some people say this song is about cum but what the LIBERAL MEDIA don't want you to know is that it's ACTUALLY the vaccine!!

**Roxieloxie** (10): :tittygif:

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I love indiestry plants Magdalena Bay

**throwaway-7650** (10): give chaeri your 11s in [the mercurial world rate]

**TiltControls** (10): The first of my many 11s here that I have to drop to a 10 cause of the competition :sob:

**welcome2thejam** (10): The combo of these synths and her voice here is really doing something for me and I will not say more

**cremeebrulee** (9.7): this song is for when you're on demonic levels of horniness

**bigbigbee** (9.5): One of the best AMV songs I've heard in years....if this came out 10 years ago there would be like nine hundred gunslinger girl AMVs to this

**homestarguy** (9.5): Immaculate, infectious mid-tempo synth groove. MagBay doesn't miss.

**nt96** (9.5): It's like a 2000s pop classic that never was.

**jasannn** (9): Everytime I listen to this song, I still think about the comment that said this was about cum.

**jaztinax** (9): oooh this is sexy

**Stryxen** (9): girl is this about sex

**vayyiqra** (9): Sadly not quite feeling all the Magbay hype of late, this is still a good song, they are a good band and they had a solid EP in this rate.

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): not my favorite on this EP but still very groovy

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): not even top 20 Magbay

**anothertown** (8): famously this is the only song i like from them from before mercurial world

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I really like this but at least 75% of the songs on Mercurial World are better.

**camerinian** (8): i think this is just missing a bit of the spark from the album, but like there is heaps of clear potential on this track. The bassline and harmonies are tight

**skargardin** (8): :flushed:

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I can certainly see why Popheads likes it!

**waluigiest** (8): a highlight from a project I was honestly disappointed by

#is this song about cum

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): yeah tbh this song is really overrated, airplane outsold massively!

**seanderlust** (7.5): very good but the slowed and reverbed version outsold I fear

**trixiematthell** (7.2): this had no effect on me

**Awkward\_King** (7): is this a bop? yes. did i start convulsing and pissing and shitting and crying when they played this live? yes. but is this overrated and not near their best song? also yes.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): this sounds like a song a minecraft youtuber would use in their epilepsy inducing intro

**BasedButta** (6): weak verses and beat. should have used all that synth power they showcased at the end more

**fadedblue09** (6): I like the strings

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): the chorus is cute but eh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): This synth pop does nothing for me, sadly

**sweetnsaursauce11** (5): i wouldn't skip it if it came on but wouldn't go out of my way to listen to it u feel

**NotWith10000Men** (4): very boring

**runaway3212** (3): wish his cum would straight up deactivate my active hearing tbh

**wavingwolves** (3): is this about cum

**flavasavavandal** (1): see the problem with this song is that her vocals are bad and she has no personality and she actively aggravates me, but this production isn’t doing any favours since it feels like generic indie pop aesthetic that’s sort of catchy but without much of anything else. Also apparently this song is about cum, the writing on here is bad enough to be a Positions reject

the way blinding lights was so good it made every other song on that album seem like it underperformed

---

#blinded by the light

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Why’s he murdering the WOC version of Electra Heart in the video?

**akanewasright** (10): ironic that the song is about eyes when we’re all throwing ass to it

**anothertown** (10): im ready! frigging large popcorn! hot dog! damn slurpy dammit! don't talk to me when i sit down to watch this!

**bbfan132** (10): love the sound, the original version >>

**bo\_g\_o** (10): doja cat remix is also a 10

**cremeebrulee** (10): the fact that this never got to be a massive hit will NEVER sit right with me

**emayzee** (10): this deserved to be a smash but in my alternate universe it went #1 on the hot 100 for 50 weeks. the term "pop perfection" seems to be used pretty loosely but to me this is as close as you can get (the doja remix in particular.) also can the 2020s pls be the decade where we repopularize sax solos in pop music?

**frogaranaman** (10): this entire album is so good

**GapeCod** (10): It feels incomplete without Doja now, but it's still amazing.

**hikkaru** (10): this is one of my faves from after hours while save your tears is like my least fave so i'm still slightly annoyed at syt being the smash while this song flopped

**ignitethephoenix** (10): RIP to the hits we lost due to Blinding Lights

**jasannn** (10): should’ve been a bigger hit

**jman457** (10): Is this city pop?

**joeeswift** (10): I got so used to the doja version but this is excellence also

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): This honestly sounds like it needs a fadeout so bad.

**Roxieloxie** (10): this song is so fucking good

**runaway3212** (10): know this is what I call a ‘in your eyes’ type of song

**skargardin** (10): im but a simp of the kenny g remix

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i mean come on. it even has a sax solo.

**throwaway-7650** (10): stream the doja + kenny G remixes :noitstrue:

**vayyiqra** (10): Unironic "this is city pop" comment and on that note the city he is from is the same as me hey neat

**ReallyCreative** (9.8): every song with this title is incredible what the fuck

**1998tweety** (9.5): doja remix washes but this is still good

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): kylie outsold but if any weakend song deserved to smash like Blinding Blights it's this one

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Still mad this flopped.

**camerinian** (9): nothing like a good sax line to tickle the taint of this sub. Keep carressing my undercarriage Abel

**homestarguy** (9): Amazingly not the best single on After Hours, but it's still so dang slick.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): the saxophone sold me on this

**jaztinax** (9): i would be okay with this vibe from the weeknd for the rest of my life

**MrMoodle** (9): i’ve really tried to buy into the hype surrounding dawn FM because i want to join in on celebrating an overlooked minority on popheads (men) but tbh nothing from that album matches this, and i can STILL name at least 3 songs from AH that i like more than this specific song, faith, save your tears, after hours, fuck even scared to live probably, all bangers that feel incredibly distinct from one another. maybe less than zero is competition? but that’s about it tbh. maybe i should give it a relisten.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): that fucking saxxxxxx

**sweetnsaursauce11** (9): fantastic song that unfortunately got overshadowed by the other After Hours singles

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): I still haven't seen the mv for this because it's been blocked in all the rate reveals and I haven't bothered to look it up outside of it

**thedoctordances1940** (8.7): saur good

**jsonphile** (8.5): Peter Gabriel outsold

**just\_thonking** (8.5): ok hear me out this sounds like Plastic Love and I have a mashup to prove it: https://rave.dj/Q4JM8CGRndiPDA

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): the better After Hours album single

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): this would be an easy 10 if it were the Doja remix

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.3): Well it’s no Blinding Lights

**BasedButta** (8): is this the uncut gems guy? anyway this is pretty good, could get going at bit faster though, its great after the half mark

**TiltControls** (8): When I first heard it, it was a 10 - but unfortunately I know the Doja Cat feature version exists in the world and this feels weirdly empty now in comparison (aka the Finesse effect)

**trixiematthell** (8): i want to go out and DANCE

**Uberpigeon** (8): this would be a ten if it was the doja one!

#sax sux

**wavingwolves** (7.9): sax emoji

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (7.5): I think I like the idea of this song more than I like the actual song

**SinfulAnarchy** (7.5): honestly i find this kinda dull and listless… it needs more momentum

**sufjancaesar** (7.5): Ngl, not the hugest fan of Abel’s vocals here and in general but the production and melody does some carrying

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): carried by saxophone

**flavasavavandal** (7): this is like absolutely fine to listen to but there isn’t a moment where I think it absolutely blasts off, the sax outro almost gets there

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This isn’t bad but it also just sounds like something I’d hear as background music on an ‘80s hits Pandora station

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): but when i say ateez - take me home is better then i’m the bad guy

**steelstepladder** (7): Ariana remix outsold tbh

**waluigiest** (7): banger but the lyrics are not that good

**Awkward\_King** (6): he sure can make synthpop

**bridgemoney** (5.5): There's really nothing about After Hours/Dawn FM era The Weeknd that interests me. Just sounds like basic 80s synthpop nostalgia that M83 does way better.

**IdiotBox01** (5): the weeknd (uses retro 80s aesthetics) popheads: wow this man is a genius, he is changing the game

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this has grown off me

**fadedblue09** (3): i sleep.

**moonagenightmares** (3): i cant stand this whiny mans voice its on the same level of justin biebers for me

**nicolas<3** (1): so what should i name my animal crossing island

**slimboyfriend** (0): The cheesy sax is one throwback that can stay in the 80s (and also 2011)

#you can fly away with  me tonight

**ignitethephoenix** (11): I knew this would be a hit the first time I heard it and I feel validated. One of my favorite songs ever (the other also being in this rate but I gave it an 11 last time so I will spread the wealth).

**jasannn** (11): I would like to thank the locals for making this a hit it deserved to be.

**jaztinax** (11): dua lipa’s best song obv. manifested this as a single the second i heard it and LOOK HOW IT WENT

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH!!!

**rslashpoopheads** (11): if this doesn't win the rate idk

**terrencelovescum** (11): i genuinely believe that i have listened to this song more times than anyone on planet earth. at one point, i listened to this song for a week straight non stop. ITS TOO GOOD

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): everyone will be annoyed if this wins so let me bump it up a bit for the laughs

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): …Shit man. I don’t know what else to say. There are many songs on this list that fill me with emotions of pride, joy, melancholy, wistfulness, awe, and I could go on. But ultimately what I want most out of a song is to have fun, and god is listening to the song fun. I know that it’s fun because it was probably the most overplayed song of 2021, and I STILL wanna get up and dance every time I hear it. It’s the best song on Future Nostalgia, the best song of 2021, and the best song in this rate! At least in my opinion, of course :)

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This song haunts me the way the fans were obsessed with it and it became an essential Dua song

**bbfan132** (10): dancing in my bedroom rn

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is a perfect pop song but I need to not hear it again for like two years so I can really enjoy it again.

**camerinian** (10): I'm very happy to let this song die now. It's ok, it had a good run, I'm sure it'll still pop off in the club but God damn just let it have some rest

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): robbed of a #1 on the charts and in its rate

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This sounds like something from Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century. I can see this getting backlash if it wins but honestly, if it’s right, it’s right.

**hikkaru** (10): if this was the dababy version pre-homophobia it would be my 11

**homestarguy** (10): I think I've heard this like 300 times and I'm still not tired of it. Dua's accent charming as hell on the bridge.

**hunnybee12** (10): IDC ONE OF THE BEST SONGS OF THE DECADE !

**iniekcja\_** (10): me and who

**mudkip1** (10): it really is a flawless pop song huh

**nootnoot781** (10): this is my favourite song in this rate but i won’t be phased if this goes out day 2 so hence the lack of an 11 💀

**qazz23** (10): love the disco revival (11 candidate)

**skargardin** (10): instant serotonin noitstrue

**static\_int\_husp** (10): DaBaby who

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): this song is still like crack to me

**TiltControls** (10): The best on FN and we love popheads for validating that fact!!!

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i know the rate community has turned against twink pop but this still lives up to the hype!!! the remixes are better though to be fair

**Uberpigeon** (10): im sorry.... i have to... its so catchy

**vayyiqra** (10): I don't want to be doing this, but I guess we are rating this again and making me admit that yes, it's a very good song; I don't want it to win, but it is still a good song by Dula Peep.

**waluigiest** (10): somehow after this song’s meteoric overexposure, i love it even more. It’s just so fun, and she captured the essence of outer space.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.9): this song slaps as much today as it did in summer 2020

**jsonphile** (9.5): physical better but yeah this slaps

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): If I'm butter if IIIIIII'M butter, if I'm butter then he's a hot knife

**bigbigbee** (9): I like the remix with DaBaby more ...what I'm NOT gonna do is pretend I never liked that version even though I found out he sucks. it's called integrity sweaty

**bridgemoney** (9): A flop that bops.

**cremeebrulee** (9): some of yall will call this a rate villain but idc this is a massive bop still

**IIIHenryIII** (9): ok, I have to admit something: I prefer the other version, I'll see myself out

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this has grown on me

**just\_thonking** (9): You and me with our long hair on the gold wall/After midnight we could feel it all/I'd go anywhere you want to/You should see there's a place I want to take you/When the train comes I will hold you (When the train comes I will hold you)/'Cause you blow my mind/On the bridge levitating cause we want to/When the unknown will surround you (When the unknown will surround you)/There is no right time/There is no right time The branches of the trees/They will hang lower now/You will grow too quick/Then you will get over it/The branches of the trees/They will hang lower now/There's a place I want to take you/When the unknown will surround you

**ReallyCreative** (9): music to commit moving violations to

**seanderlust** (8.8): shoutout to the people in the zumba class I took with my stepmom while I was visiting my parents. thank you all for ignoring me while I was lip syncing this in the full length mirror while we were box stepping during the chorus

**slimboyfriend** (8.6): Literally any female pop star could sing this song and not mess it up but Ms. Peep was the one to actually DO it

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): now that the overplay has worn off can we admit that this absolutely bops even if it isn’t top 3 on FN

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): dua lipa's rate villain era... can this song miss the top 10/15/day 3 like I just missed it at a listening party... **pretty please**?

**trixiematthell** (8.4): please be number 2

**musical\_pyn** (8): song has worn on me a bit but that bridge is still insanely catchy

**ricki** (8): making peace with the idea of this winning

**SinfulAnarchy** (8): ruined by overplay

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): my dad loves this so it’s cute

**UselessTacooo** (8): An incredible bop that loses points from me getting sick of it when it was overplayed

**veryanniev** (8): that post-chorus deserves at least an 8 although I was never into this song that much

**welcome2thejam** (8): Still recovering from the Dua Lipa overplay of 20-21, but I can still recognize how damn good this is

CrimsonROSET: #used Gravity!

**anothertown** (7.5): I always think this has way more talkbox in it than it does, which really just means the talkbox should usually be 'less is more' (daft punk dni this is not about you)

**BasedButta** (7.5): pretty good but i feel like this would make me saturated after some listens like how a macaroon is tasty as fuck but after eating one you have a 10h cooldown until the next one is available to be tackled

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): if this were either remix I would like it a lot more but the original just feels one-note after awhile

**akanewasright** (7): This song’s production? Incredible. Best beat of the year. But I kinda think Dua took the easiest way out in terms of writing a topline over it. Like it’s incredibly basic and pulls from what’s pretty much already there in the beat. Which is cool, just… it needs a bit of variety ~~which is why the remixes are better sorry, fuck dababy but the song needed someone like him~~

**apatel27** (7): why this became the breakout of Future Nostalgia is beyond me

**bo\_g\_o** (7): if this wins y'all are lame

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): err bop i guess

**shhhneak** (7): Minus 2 points for not choosing Cool.

**wavingwolves** (6.9): i kinda miss the left foot right foot levitaging guy where has he gone i wonder

**Alumineous** (6): I still think this is one of the weaker songs on the album.

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (6): I’m surprised this was the song on the album with the most longevity. It’s fun and good but wears thin for me over time

**GapeCod** (6): Rate villain alert, I'll end up regretting not tanking it.

**jman457** (6): I really don't see what yall see in this. Its just a fine pop song. Boys will be Boys is better than this!!

**plastichaxan** (6): yeah this 6 is gonna haunt me when this wins isn’t it

**Roxieloxie** (5.8): Since this has come out I've heard so many versions of it that add on something new, the dababy version ( which is unfortunately better), the hot knife version, the one that had meg on it, the one mixed with stronger, and its made me realize while I still do like the song, the song itself feels so empty

**MrMoodle** (5): don’t cancel me popheads but this unfortunately now sounds painfully incomplete without the dababy verse

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i wanted to give this a 0 just to spite the fans of this song but i decided not to. anyway this isn’t necessarily a bad song, but good god is it overrated. nearly every other song on future nostalgia is better than this and as much as i hate to say it, the dababy remix is also superior to the original. physical deserved the popularity that this song has

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): this is going to sound like a joke, i know that, but i genuinely mean it when i say whenever this starts i get upset that it is not levitating knife

**buddhacharm** (3): your honor she's levitating

**fadedblue09** (2): Apparently this is my first time scrobbling this but why I am so tired of hearing this

**nicolas<3** (2): nobody moved i fear

**runaway3212** (2): that said I cannot believe we have to rate this basic song again

**frogaranaman** (0): the song's bad plus I don't like seeing white gays happy 🙏🏼

**OliviaGodrigo** (0): this song sounds like it was made for old white people sorry

**AHSWeeknd** (10.000): Not y’all keeping Gaga out of this 😭

**hikkaru** (10.000): hosting this was fun but i honestly forget that i did all the time

**throwaway-7650** (9.500): sour candy would've been a slay but august isn't bad tbh

**RandomHypnotica** (9.433): ok i know nothing for gaga kinda serves but like... rain on me here kinda would've felt right too

**cremeebrulee** (9.333): one of the most iconic reveals EVER!!! "you so motherfucking dangerous", yetti's poor internet connection, the 911 fakeouts ... not to mention one of the best winners of all time. yup that was history in the making

**vayyiqra** (9.000): This rate was the villain origin story of Sweetenermore.

**TiltControls** (9.000): I know the albums weren't the most cohesive but this was a really stacked rate that also had Chromatica in it. In a year with the previous all-stars format I could easily see 3-4 songs making it from this rate. And despite the mess of Kosmi flopping Akane, Yetti, and Hikk killed the reveal. I'll never look at replay the same way again

**Alumineous** (8.667): This was my first rate I ever did! Kinda a weird rate to start because it was CHAOTIC. I mean, Kosmi was breaking down, we had to go on Discord, and seeing The Weeknd getting destroyed broke me. Also, this was the first time I was exposed to “misandry” as a word and I always laugh in rate reveals when it is used as a shitpost lol!

**GapeCod** (8.333): The Discord reveal was so iconic...

**runaway3212** (7.333): 2020 fucking sucked donkey dick but at least the music was good and this rate was amazing

**plastichaxan** (4.667): i love how ultimates just keep getting more and more uninteresting to me compared to other albums and yes this is all shade to 2021 ultimate

#i just think that women

**jackisboredtoday** (11): I had to eleven this. I thought about it but pushing for Rihanna to have multiple entries in winners is just too appealing for me to pick anything else

**1998tweety** (10): literal pop perfect, one of her best songs periodt

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Deserved to win but at least another Rihanna song won

**akanewasright** (10): I used to think the music video was on a set with pink grass and shit, and wasn’t just basically a shitty Instagram filter

**apatel27** (10): Riri giving the vocals we don't deserve

**bbfan132** (10): 2010s classic

**fadedblue09** (10): should’ve won its rate

**ignitethephoenix** (10): red hair rihanna a cultural reset

**IIIHenryIII** (10): only pop girl (in the world) not making music, you meant

**jaztinax** (10): rihanna’s best era tbh

**jman457** (10): This whole era was just pop perfection, and this song set the stage for it

**moooo566** (10): this is one of the best pop songs ever in my completely objective and correct opinion, and it would have got my 11 if not for rina's presence

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the very very VERY slightly inferior rihanna song in this rate

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I remember when I first heard this on the bus ride to a sports meet and the background noise was so loud and my headphones were so shit but I still felt the power this song holds.

**runaway3212** (10): me thinking she was saying ‘like im a hot guy’ the bi representation was through the roof

**skargardin** (10): pop perfection!!!

**throwaway-7650** (10): this is equally as good of a winner as

**TiltControls** (10): wow I can't believe rate manifestation magic failed when Rih didn't immediately drop R9 after S&M won. now I don't know what to believe in

**vayyiqra** (10): A song that makes me understand the "EDM trash come back" mindset because it is a banger

**waluigiest** (10): she put the red wig on and started SANGING

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): I love the lore of BattleTanx for the N64!

**trixiematthell** (9.4): we have to dance, we have to scream

**wavingwolves** (9.1): when she sings "i want you to love me like i'm a hot guy'' omfg her pen in that moment.. changed lives...

**BasedButta** (9): fucking jam

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): One of those pop songs that just hits you over the head with itself and you love it. My only complaint is that the other parts of the song don’t really match the chorus.

**camerinian** (9): it's the shit you don't notice when you were 13 that makes this track slap so hard. This production is so TIGHT and Rihanna really steps up to sell it

**jasannn** (9): This was playing at work one time and i was bouncing my ass while ringing up a customer.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8.8): ugh i listened to this song so much it's soured on me slightly but still amazing

**homestarguy** (8.5): Driving dance groove on this one, and it ascends on the anthemic chorus.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.1): I’m still salty this lost to a song where half of the lyrics are “come on” or “s s s s m m m m”

**bridgemoney** (8): The most unnecessary use of parentheses ever.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): fuck i forgot how cool the chorus is

**welcome2thejam** (8): Enjoy this song more now than I did back during Rihanna's rule over the airwaves. Packs a lot more power than I remember.

#world war XY chromosome

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): this has #7 energy

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): aged terribly but still fun

**cremeebrulee** (7): you will never be S&M.

**hunnybee12** (7): hot pie

**jsonphile** (7): I feel like all the Rihanna songs that this sub loves are all the ones I just find okay, and the ones I love this sub doesn’t care about.

**ricki** (7): slay verses, meh chorus

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I still believe that this song opens with “want you to love me, like I’m a hot guy” and I don’t want to be corrected.

**CarlieScion** (6): i loved this as a teenager but god is it grating now

**SinfulAnarchy** (6): i’m sorry rih this aged like milk

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): I like Rihanna and EDM but I don’t really want them combined

**Awkward\_King** (4): i will dance to this if it comes on in the club and i do think its kind of iconic but i would place many many songs in this rate above it and i find it kind of grating after a while. yk what maybe i should start doing rates drunk bc id probably give this an 11 if i was drunk

**moonagenightmares** (1): always hated this song

**flavasavavandal** (0): When S&M won 2010 ult, I cried, not because I have some strong affection towards it but because the runner-up, it’s competition, horrible! One of the most personalityless pop songs of the century, truly anyone could have sung this song and it would. Literally the only thing that was saving this song from my 0 is one of the opening lines “Want you to love me / Like I’m a hot guy” (upon reading the lyrics and finding out she doesn’t sing this I’m changing this to a 0) which makes no sense but at least gave me a chuckle. Dated on arrival synths, with a beat that just repeats and repeats until the chorus where wet fart synths start and something happens while Rihanna gets blown out of the water. Where is the flair, the personality, the edge, the charisma (and no the red hair isn’t a replacement for any of these).

**IdiotBox01** (0): early 10s edm pop was one of the worst things to ever happen to music

**throwaway-7650** (10.000): man down would've been so good but TOTGA still slays

**AHSWeeknd** (9.333): This rate was also tiring, specifically due to the artist that isn’t here

**TiltControls** (9.333): So great to revisit these classics (and for Katy and Kesha the scores and placements were MUCH better this time around). Also Bee/Sean/RC KILLED this rate, despite it being all their first times hosting!

**runaway3212** (8.333): me when im gay and obsessed with this era of pop

**ReallyCreative** (7.767): I hosted this! I hope everyone had a good time!

**vayyiqra** (7.667): I maintain a lot of the songs in this rate are not that good but it was a fun rate and they are all important albums ... just uh, rather uneven.

**bigbigbee** (7.500): I thank TK every day for giving me the chance to host this, and I thank Hikk every day for coming up with the rate idea - what a wonderful idea it was! I had so much fun! So this little rate comment is me saying thanks raters for being an awesome little community <3

**plastichaxan** (6.833): this rate was a lot of fun to do cause of nostalgia and all, but maybe in comparison i did outgrow a lot of these songs, still, a bunch of classics here

**Awkward\_King** (3.667): bee, sean and rc might literally be the most powerful trio of users on the subreddit not even lying like we weren't worthy

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this and Hung Up are the cream of the crop when it comes to sampling in a modern pop song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is Rihanna’s best song.

**jaztinax** (10): that light green top/outfit lives in my head rent free and has for 16 years

**mudkip1** (10): the way we all slut dropped to this as 12 year olds

**qazz23** (10): The sample just works

**RandomHypnotica** (10): ok rihanna has had a rate win now but she could win again with this tbh it's allowed

**Roxieloxie** (10): :rihdance:

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): this started 10 year old me's obsession with rihanna, the body glitter in the music video wew

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i dont trust everyone eliminating this at SIX after i 11ed it last time so i fully expect it to unceremoniously exit at an undeserved number again

**throwaway-7650** (10): love this video game OST, vote for VGI next cycle! pew pew

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i picked this because it's rihanna's best song.

**UselessTacooo** (10): the biggest bop of the rate. The nostalgia I get is unrivalled.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): Hilary Duff voice: Saugh Out Soud

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): tbh this just makes me want to listen to Tained Love

**terrencelovescum** (9.5): the producers had way TOO MUCH fun with the lasers sound. like was rihanna an injured alien in the middle of an intergalactic war?

**akanewasright** (9): Rihanna served so hard [she glitched the simulation](https://c.tenor.com/9269jF36KBcAAAAC/rihanna-dance.gif)

**Awkward\_King** (9): PUSSY

**bo\_g\_o** (9): this sample works way too fucking well in this song it's crazy

**homestarguy** (9): What a perfect choice to sample Soft Cell. Iconic and the creation of a pop legend.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): stopped originating songs

**shhhneak** (9): I think this was the song that made me get an MP3 player.

**skargardin** (9): classic

**vayyiqra** (9): This is really carried by the sample being from an amazing song but still quite the "bop".

**waluigiest** (9): I’ve been obsessed with song since its release (I was in elementary school) but i just for the first time clocked that it’s a rework of Tainted Love

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): twirl double cartwheel into a split

**plastichaxan** (8.5): i hate how much i like this i wanted to tank it to be a contrarian

**TiltControls** (8.5): It's cute, but a little outshined by Rihanna's later hits (one of which is also in the rate)

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.4): A classic indeed!

**slimboyfriend** (8.2): I think I said this in the original rate but this was THE most requested song at the roller skating rink in middle school

**wavingwolves** (8.2): fuck you u/hikkaru

**jman457** (8): sample carries it a bit too much, but still a classic for Rihanna

**MrMoodle** (8): this has aged weirdly well. like on paper this sounds maybe slightly boppy with nostalgia goggles on but it’s still bizarrely fresh.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): probably one of her worst singles

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): the first rihanna song ive ever heard and still one of her bests!

#you see, nurses they help people

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): tainted love outsold

**bigbigbee** (7.5): What I've come to realize from listening to a lot of Rihanna music this year is that I like Rihanna as a celebrity more than I like most of her singles. This is kind of “just fine” for me.

**trixiematthell** (7.1): it’s cute, not her best tho

**BasedButta** (7): groovy

**frogaranaman** (7): I don't think that's how you use sailor code

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): A very serviceable pop song but not much more

**jsonphile** (7): yeah it’s not Rihanna’s best song. It’s fun, but she has so many better songs

**nicolas<3** (7): upped this two numbers for the nostalgia factor

**NotWith10000Men** (7): this song is a lot better when i'm driving, not drinking wine in my bedroom on a monday night

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): the better Rihanna song in this rate

**Uberpigeon** (7): ive never really liked this one

**veryanniev** (7): suddenly I’m 12 again T_T

**fadedblue09** (6.5): I’m astounded that there are people who think this is her best song

**CarlieScion** (6): this still gives me flashbacks to zumba clases

**runaway3212** (6): y’all see rihanna’s name and just go wild huh

**just\_thonking** (5): now why would I listen to this when I could just listen to tainted love

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): er…she has better #lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): I hadn’t listened to this in forever and god this is low-key one of Rihanna’s worst hits. Just listen to Tainted Love instead.

**flavasavavandal** (3): aggravating song where you can tell that Rihanna is still finding her strengths because this type of yearning desperation isn’t a good fit for her with the horribly misplaced Tainted Cell sample

I'll be honest, Kelela was the only artist I did not know of before doing this rate- but what a pleasant surprise this was!

**mudkip1** (10): C'mon girly girl... Give us pussy, cvnt, estrogen, icon... Girly girl... Girlboss…

**NotWith10000Men** (10): holy jesus this is incredible?????? that's it i'm never skipping a rate again just bc "ehh idk anyone in the rate"

**plastichaxan** (10): okay im gonna need like 10 11s in this rate and this is one of them

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): holy shit this is gorgeous

**ReallyCreative** (10): bottoming to this song is transcendent

**Roxieloxie** (10): Ms.Kelela I am sorry i bullied your sim city music video, please drop more i will never do it again

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I didn't have time to do this rate but I was tempted to submit a ballot just to give this my 11

**seanderlust** (10): this kelela album is one of my favorite discoveries from this album rate cycle, and this song is a big reason why. she sounds gorgeous and focused against a sparkling instrumental track.

**shhhneak** (10): Chewed and devoured.

**skargardin** (10): incredible

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): when the beat hits at the beginning of the first chorus... i transcend

**terrencelovescum** (10): i need to swallow a beats pill to fully feel this song.

**throwaway-7650** (10): the front of the AS5 line is the easiest 10 I've ever given

**UselessTacooo** (10): The way she blends R&B with Electro-pop is so fun and mesmerizing

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): tank support anthem

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): kelela was making sims shitposts before us

**anothertown** (9): the way this builds while maintaining its mood is so good thank you not the hacker

**bo\_g\_o** (9): smooth

**fadedblue09** (9): If Kelela had to win it should’ve been this song

**homestarguy** (9): Seductive as hell.

**runaway3212** (9): people died

**slimboyfriend** (9): it’s very “We’re headed to the club and I know I’m hot but don’t fuck with me”

**Stryxen** (9): me on the frontline defending it’s bugsnax to the death

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): really chill and vibey. could’ve been a little bit shorter tho

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): grew on me a lot

**vayyiqra** (9): I find Kelela hard to get into despite her making the exact kind of ~~atmospheric R&B I love. She does make good music though.

**waluigiest** (9): the beat coming in…. yeah

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.8): Love songs that make me feel like a bad bitch

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.3): Didn’t know this PS5 saleswoman could make some excellent music

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**frogaranaman** (8): this is one of the songs of all time

**nicolas<3** (8): she was iconic for featuring sims on the music video for this banger

**qazz23** (8): I like the smooth R&B sound

**SinfulAnarchy** (8): what in the sims/imvu

#SecondLife

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): banger

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is pretty but the second half kind of drags on.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): could be summer but I'm frozen inside, me rating this song

**trixiematthell** (6.7): needed something more from this song

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): i was the hacker

**flavasavavandal** (6.5): how do i put this lightly, this song doesn’t have enough bounce to it

**TiltControls** (6.5): I really enjoyed the album, but if I'm honest I never got the love for this one track. At least I'll make up this score to Kelela with LMK in winners

**jman457** (6.4): Low key the reason I didn't do this rate is because I just couldn't get into her album at all.

**BasedButta** (5.5): Cool execution but doesn’t make me wanna listen to it

**AHSWeeknd** (10.000): Are we allowed to add comments beside these things? No? Okay.

**ReallyCreative** (9.667): Literally such an amazing rate, across the board just amazing songs

**throwaway-7650** (9.500): take me apart is just a magnificent album

**Awkward\_King** (8.833): this was one of my favourite rate lineups of the year and it was so nice to do just as i was getting into doing rates more regularly. isolation is one of my favourite albums of all time, and brenda was iconic

**vayyiqra** (8.667): The masses (me) want more R&B rates

**runaway3212** (8.500): such a slay rate tbh brenda we love you and you are so right for leaving rate culture after this wish I was you tbh

and with that, my 11 leaves. If anything, I'm happy it made day 3- and it beat the Perfume Genius song that placed above it in the actual rate! That's all I wanted at the end of the day.

---

#gospel

**CaptainDaisyG** (11): I thought about who I’d be disgusted to have not made the top ten, and the thought of this one barely missing out was the most offensive. So that’s how I picked my eleven.

**iniekcja\_** (11): the regret I would feel if i didn't eleven this song would hopefully be bigger than the regret I feel for not elevening Eso Que Tu Haces

**jman457** (11): A modern classic, I was floored the first time hearing this

**tkajilili** (11): what can I say this song is good. There were a lot of great songs I would have happily given my 11, but this one stands out for its classical sound and musical complexity

**AHSWeeknd** (10): thank you for including one of the only poc from the original rate on this one.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this song makes me wanna get fucked on like a halloween rollercoaster

**bbfan132** (10): this chorus is fucking amazing

**buddhacharm** (10): legit my 2020 SOTY, I had to UB3R-B0T !choose to pick between this and Cranes for my 11 😭

**camerinian** (10): I have destroyed my throat too many times belting that chorus in the car, it's sleazy and ugly but fuck it hits. Yves Tumor is genuinely like nobody else working right now. Drown me in your cacophony

**cremeebrulee** (10): THIS AIN'T BY DESIGN GIRL!!!! one of my most played songs ever at this point, i actually had planned on 11ing this but unfortunately another song edged it out ksksks but I HOPE THIS DOES WELL!!!!!

**frogaranaman** (10): they truly gave 110% here

**GapeCod** (10): Perfect.

**hikkaru** (10): YASS so glad this is in from indieheads

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this entire album is so amaze my lord

**mudkip1** (10): I DON’T REMEMBER WHAT SCORE I GAVE THIS LAST TIME BUT I’VE FULLY GROWN ON THIS ABSOLUTE BANGER AND NOW I LOVE YVES TUMOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS

**nicolas<3** (10): that was too good! lets get the bill... purrr

**plastichaxan** (10): this should’ve won indieheads rate wtf

**ReallyCreative** (10): Mitski more popular than church? Teens want Mitski not jesus!

**Roxieloxie** (10): the transition into this song is godly

**seanderlust** (10): this song, kerosene! and a couple other songs from HTATM zap the pleasure center of my brain with a cattle prod. shoutout to yves' EP that came out in early 2021 - also excellent

**SinfulAnarchy** (10): so sleek and sexy

**static\_int\_husp** (10): tbh this should have won the indie exchange

**UselessTacooo** (10): Mic The Snare rate promo so true!

**vayyiqra** (10): Psychedelic soul meets James Bond theme and it's awesome.

**wavingwolves** (10): if all gospel was half as good as this song i would believe in christianity

**welcome2thejam** (10): Hits like a hammer and dripping in swagger, you can just imagine him commanding a stage to this

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): this is maybe the most appropriately named song ever

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): kerosene is more gorgeous but ugh this hypes me tf up every time

**bigbigbee** (9.5): “yves naht a toomor” - /u/nyoom

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (9.5): I love the intro

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): literally the only thing keeping this from a 10 is the intro starting and stopping random which always fucks me up. a nearly perfect song otherwise that chorus is like crack

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): this played at my uni's gym omfg

**slimboyfriend** (9.3): invented sexuality.

**akanewasright** (9): titty shaker

**BasedButta** (9): ooh! oooooooh this is what a good instrumental can do oooh

**bo\_g\_o** (9): they did that

**skargardin** (9): bop

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): at times i feel it's slightly overrated but also it is just great

**bridgemoney** (8): Reminds me a lot of Dear Science era TV On The Radio

**homestarguy** (8): Trip-hoppy beat meets some Prince-esque vocals. I dig this one.

**runaway3212** (8): this sounds like a song indieheads would really vibe with

#shedevil by night

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Yves Tumor is so cool but their music is actually generally not my thing… this is good though

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): this is actually really good? i've never heard anything by this artist

**TiltControls** (7.5): Grown on me a ton since the rate. Now just need to actually check out the album at some point...

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): ok but when do we rate Kerosene!?

**anothertown** (7): it's kind of giving early 10's indie rock

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This song sounds really good my only issue is structurally I think it’s a little anticlimactic.

**waluigiest** (7): prince tea

**trixiematthell** (6.9): reminds me of low

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.8): Ehhhhhhh

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): idk why this was the big song from the album when there’s much better songs

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Yves Tumor songs always feel almost good but not quite

**sweetnsaursauce11** (6.3): ok i recognise it's a good song but it's just not my thing. the instrumentals are amazing however

**1998tweety** (6): i am not vibing with this

**flavasavavandal** (6): There is an excellent song here if Yves wasn’t singing

**jaztinax** (5): i don’t vibe with yves tumor’s vocal style, but it’s a decent song

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): maybe in 3 years I’ll relisten to this and love it (like I did with Eva) but for now I don’t like it

**IIIHenryIII** (4): just start the song already, goddamnit. Don't actually please!

**xearomis** (3): The instrumentals are nice but the vocals…not so much

**terrencelovescum** (1): their voice is on the same level of annoying as dance monkey.

**throwaway-7650** (9.500): not a perfect 10 but I wish I could do this rate [3]

**vayyiqra** (9.333): Now infamous for Popheads being forced to confront the awful truth that MGMT and Radiohead might've made some good music at some point, and spawning far too many indie rate ideas. Not mad that the results were based and a classic song won! Good times.

**ReallyCreative** (9.167): what a disaster this was

**TiltControls** (9.167): One of the most iconic and stacked rates we've other done. Some of the messiness was definitely unfortunately but I stand by that a lot of the regular IH raters are really fun and it was great rating each others' stuff! Also Steel a legend hosting this alone with the IH/PH animosity and Kosmi beginning to flop

**thedoctordances1940** (8.933): bmbmbm ROBBED

**cremeebrulee** (8.833): this is also up there as one of my favorite rates just because i knew so few of the songs going in and ended up loving so many of them!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.667): this rate was so popular we decided to do them once a cycle and just call them "indie rates"

**Awkward\_King** (8.667): my favourite rate of the year! the amount of songs i now adore that this rate introduced me to or got me further into is insane, and steel was a brilliant host even through.... indieheads adjacent issues

**plastichaxan** (8.667): ah yes the rate that created my trauma of a 6 winning over my 11 being #2, see Ratemas for the repeated occassion

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (8.500): The concept of this rate is so cute

**AHSWeeknd** (8.333): Fun fact- it took me 2 days to complete this rate because I couldn’t take too much indie music in a single day

**bridgemoney** (8.333): I'll never forgive popheads for robbing LCD Soundsystem.

**Alumineous** (8.000): Kosmi was sent TO THE GRAVE. And BeatSense became grown grown. That's all you needed to know.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.000): I gave All My Friends a 10 despite not even knowing who LCD Soundsystem was my indie cred is assured for life! Also this rate actually turned me into an indiehead so I'd say it was a rousing success all around.

**runaway3212** (7.667): Steelstepladder is the most perfect human being ever (I forgot if they hosted this rate but it’s true in any case)

**2dina3dworld** (6.667): my favourite rate of the year. The vibes were immaculate, the choices good, and the tension and results were incomparable. We should do it again

**GapeCod** (6.667): ALL MY LIFE I THOUGHT I'D CHANGE

**fadedblue09** (3.667): Most overrated rate of last year i think

vayyiqra: Would like to partly redact my comment and say that while I hold that the winner was Good In Fact, the results weren't that great because Idioteque and Neighbourhood #1 (Tunnels) were robbed

However also Indieheads sending us Tunnels was kind of a weird move anyway it's a great opener but there are so many other Arcade Fire songs that would make more sense to me

sad!

DilemmaOfAHedgehog: Why was it a weird exchange?
[/r/popheads/comments/t2twzk/all_stars_5_reveal_day_3_are_we_gonna_be_alright/hzn598d/]

=====

vayyiqra: Not that weird, but a little unexpected I guess. I grew up on Arcade Fire (I'm Canadian) and "Tunnels" is a good song, but it's not one of the first songs to come to mind for them. A song like "Wake Up" or "Laika" would seem like much more of an "iconic" indie song (and I think would also be better liked by Popheads, just as an aside). I saw a few Indieheads themselves wondering why they sent that Arcade Fire song in particular. I can't look at the streaming numbers on mobile right now but I would think it's not one of their biggest songs, is all.

Since you like Beyoncé an analogy might be if someone asked for a song to get into *Lemonade* and they got sent "Sorry". It's a perfectly good song, it's just a little puzzling why it'd be that one when "Formation" and "Hold Up" are right there, you know?

Again this is all subjective. I'm not against the songs that Indieheads sent and I thought they had a lot of great picks. But there were a few where I thought I would have rather sent a different song by the same artist. Just preference.

#the sawayama dynasty

**BasedButta** (11): wow! whoever wrote this song is… holy shit. surprised me on the quality, the sounds progression, how it flowed with the vocals. nice.

**moooo566** (11): its been a pretty long time since i genuinely fell in love with an artists work, as opposed to just enjoying the bits i heard, but rina really ~gets me~ you know? i got to see rina live in a brief interlude last year between covid waves and it was my #1 highlight of the year. aside from being a fun show, she just created an environment that felt so safe and welcoming, where i could feel good about myself, which was sorely needed in general terms and specifically in 2021, the worst year on record. i gave a lot of tens to songs that sound good but this is the only one that really properly makes me feel good.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): For the ladies in the back, this is how you do an opener.

**Alumineous** (10): Asian generational trauma. It's real. But we're the masters of our own destiny. And of course, vocals were served.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): the drama is everything

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i've hurt myself trying to do that bridge multiple times

**jsonphile** (10): this could be a villain entrance song damn Rina this slaps so hard

**NotWith10000Men** (10): question: tywin lannister went on and on about his DINasty. is that just an antiquated pronunciation, was he being extra, or do brits say it both ways?

**plastichaxan** (10): how can someone give this a 0 i’m looking at you sage

**ReallyCreative** (10): this is such a statement opener, jesus!!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): listen, I’m someone who was obsessed with Evanescence - Fallen in high school, of course I’m gonna eat this up and give it a 10

**seanderlust** (10): what a banger. quick prayer circle that her concert doesn't get canceled when I go see her live. covid do NOT interact!!!!

**shhhneak** (10): the pivot to hard rock and “I’m gonna take the throne this time” hits like a nuclear explosion.

**skargardin** (10): This is how you do an intro

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): one of my fave album openers

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): kappyko simply has bad opinions and should refrain from sharing them

**throwaway-7650** (10): my first ever 11, hope it can survive until day 3!

**TiltControls** (10): A 10, but was really hoping for STFU

**trixiematthell** (10): she was close to being my 11

**UselessTacooo** (10): This is a Rina discography highlight

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): This is still fucking godly

**xearomis** (10): Finally some good music

**thedoctordances1940** (9.8): so true

**homestarguy** (9.5): Rina is making some ascended pop music now, and this one is, dare I say, epic. I just slightly prefer some of the more lower key cuts on Sawayama.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.3): I used to not care about this song, but it has grown on me. It rocks!

**MrMoodle** (9): honestly this is corny as fuck but in a good way, i feel like this would fit perfectly in an actually good reboot of charlie’s angels

**wavingwolves** (8.7): that guitar solo yup yup

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): If I was around for the rate, this would've been one of my lowest scores. And still, it's over eight.

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is obviously good but damn y’all overrated tf out of it in the Sub Favorites rate.

**camerinian** (8): Sorry I was a Green Day kid so this really good Evanescence tribute doesn’t really smack me in the same way

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I like this but I’m kinda confused we voted it in? lol

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this isn’t comme de garçons

**iniekcja\_** (8): this album doesn't really do it for me anymore but some tracks still serve ig

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): i don’t revisit this album at all now outside from commes des garcons but this song is still good

**vayyiqra** (8): Shoutout to /u/throwaway-7650 for showing me the light on this song and that it's Good In Fact

**waluigiest** (8): the beginning sounds like blinding lights, no?

3joan of arc

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): amazing, but it's not even in my top half of SAWAYAMA songs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.3): idk it just feels like its missing something…doesnt have enough oomph to it

**akanewasright** (7): …I definitely overrated this the first time around because I saw that a friend of mine was tanking it. It vastly overperformed and I will not make that mistake again!

**bbfan132** (7): hmm i wish i liked this more

**nicolas<3** (7): bottom 3 in sawayama actually

**Stryxen** (7): a bit overrated and carried by the bridge but whew it was amazing live i saw rina live hey guys i saw rina live

**welcome2thejam** (7): Bit disappointed this got voted as the Rina rep tbh, it's very good but in a sea of great to outstanding tracks off that album

**jman457** (6.9): I always think this is Shake it Out and am always disappointed when its not.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): this is one of the worst songs on the album why is it here

**Awkward\_King** (4): jules was always right you all booeed him but he never once lied

**ImADudeDuh** (4): one of the 2 SAWAYAMA songs i dont like

**frogaranaman** (3): the beginning stretch of SAWAYAMA is always so boring.. album gets good once "Comme Des Garçons" hits

**GapeCod** (2): sage spilled in the original rate tbh. This is way too kitschy and non-essential compared to the solid album that follows it, it's mind-boggling to me how it came third in the rate.

**runaway3212** (1): this song is like a knife that lays bad in your hand. It doesn’t seem that bad at first but it is

#raters, keep on ratin'

**qazz23** (11): Everything about this is great, funky and infectious, it's a classic

**AHSWeeknd** (10): We need to get legend Wonder in more rates

**akanewasright** (10): Stevie Wonder my poor meow meow...my baby my little baby who hurt so much but treats people with nothing but kindness forgive me for not being able to do more..i tried my best i really did..

**bbfan132** (10): excellent

**cremeebrulee** (10): very cool how you've put the winner at the bottom of this ballot

**flavasavavandal** (10): I don’t know at what point Stevie became one of my go-to comfort artists but he became one of my go-to comfort artists

**homestarguy** (10): I don't know how Stevie came up with grooves this good, but this might be his most legendary one. And that's saying a lot!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): conscious bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): noah fence stevie but why do you have two songs in this rate when you could’ve sent a Marvin song (mercy mercy me)

**iniekcja\_** (10): til i had a really really wrong perception of Mr Wonder

**jaztinax** (10): this song is a vibe. innervisions is a vibe. stevie wonder is a vibe. both stevie songs BETTER be day 3 again or i will sue

**jsonphile** (10): okay please don’t let misandry win again I need at least one Stevie Wonder song in the top ten

**mudkip1** (10): well I made it to the very end and I truly truly hope we NEVER do another 70+ song rate ever again… regardless of whether these are songs we’re familiar with or not! 5 hours is unbelievably daunting and nobody who is new to rating is going to want to do this entire thing unless they have a whole afternoon off.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): fun fact, if you look up funky in the dictionary, god beams this song directly to your brain

**ReallyCreative** (10): what I'm looking for after I have one Grindr hookup too many on the day of the Lord

**Roxieloxie** (10): 8 years old.mp4 [2]

**runaway3212** (10): Anakin knew he couldn’t win once he heard this bop it was over for him

**skargardin** (10): god this bops

**TiltControls** (10): such great taste voting this in. Another one of Stevie's best tracks (and another that I fear will be robbed)

**vayyiqra** (10): If you tank this I will get Ye to DM you himself and tell you to go find God

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): they just dont make bass riffs like this anymore

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): he served

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): I actually like this one more in All-Stars than I did in the context its rate, which surprises me but maybe speaks to just how strong the best of this rate was

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): That’s some funky stuff right there.

**nt96** (8): Raters, keep on ratin'!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): God this groove is funky

**SinfulAnarchy** (8): the lyrics are too cheesy but the guitars smash

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8): snazzy but in a low key way

**waluigiest** (8): imagine an acapella group doing this and one person just doing the funky guitar riff over and over for 4 minutes

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.4): This instrumental SLAPS but the lyrics are… hmm…

**jman457** (7.2): Not my fav from this rate

**trixiematthell** (7.1): would like to get high to this

**Awkward\_King** (7): me climbing a hill

**BasedButta** (5): this song made me so bored i started to lay my head at my table and that kinda fucked up my earbuds im pissed

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Just because it’s a classic doesn’t mean I have to like it.

70s Soul was a really refreshing rate this cycle, even if it was, as the kids say it, 'brain on'. Innervisions was my favorite album of the four, so I'm happy both its songs made it to day 3!

---

#city pop

**jsonphile** (11): Absolutely perfect song. Couldn’t decide between this, Nina Simone, or Aretha Franklin for my 11, but figured I’d support the man knowing how popheads be

**kappyko** (11): probably peak music

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Haunting on every listen

**akanewasright** (10): Stevie Wonder my poor meow meow...my baby my little baby who hurt so much but treats people with nothing but kindness forgive me for not being able to do more..i tried my best i really did..

**Alumineous** (10): Ugh why didn't I do this rate.

**anothertown** (10): Low scorers on this are ugly

**bbfan132** (10): perfect song

**flavasavavandal** (10): we love soul destroying stories in soul bangers that still try to inspire optimism for change

**jaztinax** (10): i wrote a paper on this song once and got an A. iconic times. easy 11 contender though - the passion and the storytelling in this is unreal

**jman457** (10): My only 11 I gave in this rate, if this rate happened earlier this would be higher.

**qazz23** (10): vocal performance on the last verse is incredible

**ReallyCreative** (10): it's upsetting how relevant this song still is

**ricki** (10): sending this song for all stars was a micro-aggression

**Roxieloxie** (10): 8 years old.mp4

**runaway3212** (10): vore is like a big yass

**TiltControls** (10): wow I can't believe the hosts included a song that went out in 15th

**UselessTacooo** (10): I was not prepared for this to sound as good as it does. It’s so full and emotional. I have no complaints.

**vayyiqra** (10): Still one of the most based songs we've ever rated

**waluigiest** (10): he did what needed to be done

**SinfulAnarchy** (9.5): a cultural moment

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): my first exposure to this song was via Lindsay Lohan as Lola as Eliza in Eliza Rocks within Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen and I had no idea it was about racial injustice until like 5 years ago when I learned that it was an actual song and somehow even better than Ms. Lohan's rendition

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.1): But why does he sing like Cookie Monster at the end?? 😭

**Stryxen** (9): he said absolutely everything there is nothing else to say

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i actually think this is kinda aided by how long it is, at least in terms of my enjoyment of it, bc the spoken interlude like in the middle really adds to it

**camerinian** (8.5): man it has to be the exact moment you start to really sink into the groove of this thing that the dude has to go and get fucking arrested. Really makes u think

**homestarguy** (8.5): This is ascended soul music from Stevie. The synthwork is sublime. Just a bit lengthy.

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): "4 walls" so true stan f(x) + FUCK SM

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): 😂😂😂😂 IS THIS CITY POP 😂😂😂😂

**1998tweety** (8): bop but long

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This song is a whole ass journey lol.

**bridgemoney** (8): Blue collar jam.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): love the storytelling, but I'm not a big fan of the sound

#gentrification

**sweetnsaursauce11** (7.5): king

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): it couldve done without that skit in the middle tbh

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): very good song, but skit-phobia wins here

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.8): that skit in the outro should’ve been its own interlude imo

**trixiematthell** (6.5): feels weird to call this camp but it felt camp

**BasedButta** (6): cool lyrics though

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I appreciate the ambition and it’s not bad but I can’t really see a situation where I’d want to listen to this, I love musical theatre so I’m not a stranger to long tracks with a story but this is just too out there for me.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Living in the shitty

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): didn’t think I’d repeat a comment about TxT while talking about Stevie Wonder but here we are (this’ll make no sense if TxT goes out later). Also, clapping

**AHSWeeknd** (10.000): Why’d y’all keep Marvin off this?? 😭

**vayyiqra** (9.667): A good rate! You know it is when reading several pages of background information on the songs is one of the most interesting parts of it. now everyone do the Afropunk rate on Indieheads and wish Darj a great day

**TiltControls** (9.667): A rate I never thought would get in, but I'm so glad it did. Darj and Flava killed it with the writeups on this one and set an amazing standard for hosts that I will completely ignore next rate I have when I write 'bop!' for 50% of the comments

u/janellemonae I love you why didn't you do the rate

---

#whether you're a high

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): in hindsight i kinda regret giving this my 11 over cold war in the original hcp rate. but that doesn’t mean im not gonna 11 it again!! still one of the most fun songs i’ve ever heard in my life

**2dina3dworld** (10): what does it have to do with the rest of the album? Nothing! Is it still a bop and a half? Yes, of course

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Though I don’t agree with this being a single choice it was great

**Alumineous** (10): Okay, didn’t know she made bops. Definitely gonna check out the album.

**apatel27** (10): Funk and Big Boi = a good time

**bbfan132** (10): idk what else to say besides “great song!!!”

**ignitethephoenix** (10): bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ok so this is winning right

**iniekcja\_** (10): it took me way too many years to realize this was actually her song

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this won’t win but i wish it would

**ReallyCreative** (10): she just gets it, she's the moment

**Roxieloxie** (10): ITS THE ABSOLUTE SMASH. Im so happy this got in, I didnt do HCP ultimately but I hoped this would get in. I've been obssesed with this since i first heard it but this song live???? the break down in the middle??? are you kidding me. This is MUSIC

**skargardin** (10): one of Janelle's best no doubt

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I can’t believe this is almost 5 minutes long

**TiltControls** (10): this > cold war (though both are 10s)

**UselessTacooo** (10): Its grown on me immensely since the HCP rate

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes overrated yes still good

**camerinian** (9.5): Janelle has been effortlessly likeable and fully formed right from her debut. She is a rare talent and needs to be cherished. Also the same for Big Boi but y'all knew that

**homestarguy** (9.5): A song that demands you get out and shuffle your feet on the dancefloor. And come on, Big Boi brings the party on this one.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): this just brings me joy

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): how can you not love funky janelle

**1998tweety** (9): big bop

**waluigiest** (9): it’s honestly so much better in this rate than in the context of the album

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): great but kinda overrated

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): Almost too perfect, too precise before Big Boi shows up and just steals the show. Sorry Janelle you’re a legend but this is a Big Boi song now

**just\_thonking** (8.5): I love this but I am not afraid to admit this song sounds like an Old Navy ad

**bo\_g\_o** (8): it's good

**emayzee** (8): this song is canonically kmartcore considering i first learned of it from a kmart back to school commercial in 2011

**hikkaru** (8): old navy core but sometimes that's not a bad thing

**throwaway-7650** (8): the way I decrease its score each time I rate this

#or low score

**plastichaxan** (7.8): idk after the rate i’m convinced this isn’t close to the best of Janelle, it’s still a huge BOP

**sweetnsaursauce11** (7.6): so SNAZZY

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.5): When he rhymed NASDAQ with asscrack I felt my third eye open

**trixiematthell** (7.1): this could maybe be a sims song in a really good way

**Awkward\_King** (7): thinking abt this era of janelle monae only ever makes me think abt milan's runway on s4 of drag race inspired by her

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is fun but I don’t feel like revisiting it very often.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): why does this instrumental sound like Happy :fakesmile:

**jman457** (6.5): sorry Janelle but all I can think about is that Just dance song

**akanewasright** (6): this is like… hmm… it’s good, but something’s off. I think if Janelle wrote and recorded this song now, it would be better.

**runaway3212** (5): idg why this song is here but like… we have to make women win somehow

**BasedButta** (4.5): the longer i kept listening to it the more points i wanted to deduct

**wavingwolves** (4): mattress commercial core

**SinfulAnarchy** (3): sorry to janelle fans but i find this irritatingly derivative and corny… it sounds like something that would be played during a dance unit in high school gym class. and not fun corny like the pop rap songs

**Uberpigeon** (0): this song really gets on my nerves so im giving it a zero as punishment for having to hear it again

#this song is my pleasure

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): still the best song of the current decade and no one can change my mind just yet. it's sleek, it's chic, it's horny, it's... everything

**1998tweety** (10): big bop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Her voice, please, this entire album is just soooo good

**bbfan132** (10): used to feel underwhelmed by this but i get it now, excellent

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): That blaring synth on the post chorus. Oh my lord.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): anyways here's me going apeshit over a song with an 80s throwback sound

**frogaranaman** (10): to reiterate - gay bears

**ignitethephoenix** (10): queen shit

**ImADudeDuh** (10): my wig is in orbit

**iniekcja\_** (10): me seducing the customers by swinging my hips behind the tills at Zara while this is playing over my head

**jaztinax** (10): this whole album has my heart

**jman457** (10): One of the best pop songs ive ever heard. It just requires you to dance

**just\_thonking** (10): So close to getting my 11

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): better than spotlight noshade

**mudkip1** (10): maybe the best disco song EVER?!?!?!?

**plastichaxan** (10): anyone else get gender envy from the person in the video? :flushed:

**qazz23** (10): Her vocal delivery is the best (11 candidate)

**ReallyCreative** (10): a classier, sexier, more voluptuous way to ask "what are you on here for" on Grindr

**rslashpoopheads** (10): exactly queen

**runaway3212** (10): I love when a song sounds literally perfect

**shhhneak** (10): The way this album made my popheads AOTY list two years in a row.

**skargardin** (10): Honestly, I'm not at all surprised that this was a winner contender for the Nu-Disco rate

**throwaway-7650** (10): thought the beginning was hey tayo

**UselessTacooo** (10): I was absolutely obsessed with this song during summer 2021, and while my love has died down a bit I will admit it’s a perfect pop song.

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes I am being basic and 10-ing the bleepbloop dance-pop song and I think this is the right thing to do.

**welcome2thejam** (10): The most infectious beat and unreal production

**akanewasright** (9): deserved over spotlight

**homestarguy** (9): That 15-note synth hook absolutely makes this one. Love Jessie's wispy vocals too.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

**Stryxen** (9): amazing song but lemme stan roisin a bit more

**TiltControls** (8.5): There are quite a few tracks I prefer over this one on the album, but it's still such a powerhouse that it easily gets a good score

**Roxieloxie** (8): its kinda a bop but kinda not

**waluigiest** (8): this smells like quarantine

**wavingwolves** (8): it's just a slay

#stop.

**trixiematthell** (7.9): she deserves so much better

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): as much as I love this album, this always felt like one of the more skippable tracks to me,

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.2): Soft bop!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Fantastic album but this has never been my favorite, it feels too mechanical

**ricki** (7): CEO, entrepreneur, born in 1964, Jefffrey, Jeffrey Bezos

**sweetnsaursauce11** (6.5): this makes me want to fall asleep but in a nice way

**nicolas<3** (6): i get why gay people love this song but its just not hitting for me 😭

**Awkward\_King** (5): ik this song is horny but damn jessie why do u sound like youre taking breaths in between pumps

**NotWith10000Men** (5): this what y'all've been going on about?

**moonagenightmares** (4): goldfrapp did it better 2 decades ago

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): the world has had enough white women trying to make disco

**flavasavavandal** (1): There is such a thing as too perfect. If I don’t think I could easily sink into it, but I do think and this comes across as too clean. Disco to me is about escapism, but there’s that edge to it that the escapism is going to end at some point and Jessie Ware and her team manage the first part with flying colours, but don’t even attempt the second part. I also don’t like how Jessie tries to sell disco as “so cool”, disco isn’t cool, in fact the uncoolness is part of the appeal for me. So yeah this is just the antithesis of everything I want from disco and I kinda despise it. I’d rather just listen to the albums where the songs from the disco grab bag rate came from than listen to this pastiche again

**fadedblue09** (0): Calling this "disco" is generous considering how lifeless this is

**ReallyCreative** (10.000): one of the most iconic rates ever I fear

**AHSWeeknd** (10.000): Why’d y’all keep Kylie off this?? 😭

**Alumineous** (10.000): Clearly I was excited to do this rate because I really loved the Jessie Ware record. I think the highlight of this rate for me was AHSWeeknd's comment on Celebrate You.

**GapeCod** (10.000): I'm never hosting another rate again ~~until an idea with Angel Olsen gets picked, pretty please~~...

**plastichaxan** (8.167): Kylie sweetie im so sorry for how robbed you were, that said this was the second best 2020 rate exactly

**vayyiqra** (8.000): A good rate! So sorry to Róisín and Kylie for what I did to their albums. But it's still always good when we get to rate actual disco music.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.733): i will forever be sad that i was sick and had to miss the day 3 reveal

**TiltControls** (7.500): I wish I gave myself a little more time with this rate, especially Jessie's album. It's grown on me a ton even though I already scored it well that time. Also poor Kylie - at least you've got company with D'Angelo in 'early exits that didn't make it to All Stars'. Also some of Niki's and Skar's shitposts in the reveal were legitemately works of art

**Awkward\_King** (5.500): iconic rate host duo never been topped

**fadedblue09** (2.833): Never got the hype towards this trend, and I hope it dies soon. None of these songs hold a candle to soulfulness of true disco, so why would I even listen to these

**Awkward\_King** (10): this song is just perfection to me it is so gorgeous

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Tik Tok powered both this song and Fancy Like into being 2021 hits. It giveth and it taketh away.

**camerinian** (10): I'm melting

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): la luna 'sta llena mi peluca vacia

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’ve come around on this one a LOT since the original rate, it’s so beautiful and definitely an addictive piece of ear candy. I still wish it was longer though!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I think this will go sooner than people expected

**jman457** (10): This becoming an actual hit for Kali. A moment that was most pleasing in my career

**plastichaxan** (10): quien lo diría… this song was such a hit and i never felt it was overplayed or got tired of it… the power that that has

**rslashpoopheads** (10): soty

**skargardin** (10): :slowflabster:

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): this was deserving of being her "mainstream" hit

**throwaway-7650** (10): voting this for songeniality if it doesn't survive day 2

**UselessTacooo** (10): honestly one of the best songs I’ve heard. It’s so soothing and complex. 11 contender for sure

**waluigiest** (10): i know all about the Spanglish…… tele-tapia

**wavingwolves** (10): angelical

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): absolutely iconic

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.3): “La luna está llena, mi cama vacía” yo 😢

**runaway3212** (9): still shoock this didnt wint

**Stryxen** (9): sex and pussy

**welcome2thejam** (9): If that Tame Impala song is the ~Vibes~ champion then this is the no. 1 contender

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): wow who could've seen this be picked

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): trying SO hard not to repeat the pants comment

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): ate [3]

**trixiematthell** (8.4): lofi tiktok queen

**frogaranaman** (8): why were gringos so afraid to lipsync this song on tiktok it's literally like four Spanish lines max in the audio

**NotWith10000Men** (8): so glad this blew up

#tinfoil hat

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): this is what dreams sound like

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): thankfully the clapping stopped

**TiltControls** (7.5): Still surprised this didn't win, but Lido really was the perfect winner. At least this got to slay in the voting

**IIIHenryIII** (7): make love ew, hacer el amor por telepatía sí

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): I don't get the hype, it sounds like filler music

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): this is so boring im sorry

**MrMoodle** (10): i wanna hire fatman scoop as my personal trainer

**qazz23** (10): Love the beat and xylophone(?) throughout this

**RandomHypnotica** (10): carly rae jepsen really placed above this with a song that was so rejected it had to be revived to be used for a d-list animated movie…

**ReallyCreative** (10): can't wait for this song to go out at like 24 or something absolutely criminal

**Roxieloxie** (10): thank you to whoever sent this in, I forgot this was rated

**rslashpoopheads** (10): MUSIC MAKE YOU LOSE CONTROL

**runaway3212** (10): My head lost control of my wig and it got snatched

**seanderlust** (10): one of my all time favorite music videos. I remember seeing this on VH1 before school and it fully changed my life

**skargardin** (10): BOPPPP

**Stryxen** (10): a cartoon chase scene taking place on a xylophone type beat

**terrencelovescum** (10): the anthesis to janet. if this doesn't make u move, nothing else will.

**throwaway-7650** (10): a rate(s) winner!

**TiltControls** (10): One of the few score bumps I've got this time around. It's grown on me a ton (even though I still gave it like a 9 last time lmao)

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i picked this because we're never rating this missy album so it has no other chances of redemption

**UselessTacooo** (10): This is such a good song to get energized. It’s so bouncy and the production is stellar

**thedoctordances1940** (9.7): the fucking beat though

**jsonphile** (9.5): insane production and Missy Elliott is an absolute boss

**plastichaxan** (9.5): the way this is better than most of Missy’s songs in the 00s Female MCs rate i’m sorry kingstie :sob:

**shhhneak** (9.2): Collabs these days could never.

**1998tweety** (9): iconic

**NotWith10000Men** (9): missy has some dope backing tracks

**sweetnsaursauce11** (9): missy snapped and fatman scoop deserves more respect

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): the opening 10 seconds are so absolutely iconic that its hard to follow up on it and not be disappointing, but this song somehow manages to not disappoint afterwards!

**waluigiest** (9): maybe the ideal hip hop/pop/dance crossover?

**welcome2thejam** (9): It does peak at the first minute and fades a bit after that, but goddamn what a first minute it is

**homestarguy** (8.5): The instrumental is scientifically created to make you look stupid on a dance floor.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): popheads on the reveal day

**jman457** (8.5): certified bop

**slimboyfriend** (8.4): This song would even make Bella Swan throw some ass

**wavingwolves** (8.1): a tiktok hit for a reason

**nicolas<3** (8): A CLASSIC

#did NOT do 00s MCs

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I both love and hate that looping instrumental (synth?)

**bo\_g\_o** (7): I'd like it better if i didn't have to hear fatman scoop just yelling for an entire minute

**CarlieScion** (7): this would be a 10 if there wasnt a persistent voice of a man going HUH HUH HUH HUH in the background

**vayyiqra** (7): Must be a fake Pophead because this is a sample I knew first from LMFAO's "Get Crazy" but still a great sample to build a song around.

**just\_thonking** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6soDHGUWwBg

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Y’all are gonna say triangle but I am gonna say https://twitter.com/yakkocmn/status/1249514298788827136

**trixiematthell** (5.3): cool

**mudkip1** (5): the latter half of this aged like milk

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I still can’t get over the fact that we as a pop sub have collectively decided to dedicate two rates to Kelis before Ciara

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): what’s with the growling man

**BasedButta** (3): The only thing making me lose control is that up and down keyboard sound that assaults my ears during 70% of the song it fucks everything up and im not being hyperbolic. esp since they seem allergic to adding more layers to the instrumental. This would make me sober in 30 seconds if it played at a party. +3 points for the MUSIC MAKE YOU LOSE CONTROL part they should remove everything else and keep only that

**AHSWeeknd** (10.000): What an interesting rate name

**cremeebrulee** (10.000): unironically TK did snap with these picks

**runaway3212** (8.667): TK ur perfect don’t look at my I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man comment

**TiltControls** (8.667): While I was hoping for Shelter to make fan vote, it was a really hard rate to pick a rep for. There was so much great stuff sent in - both well known and new discoveries. Plus some amazing shitposts (seriously I still think about that one for Always Be My Baby) and a tk-reveal sealed the deal

**vayyiqra** (8.333): I barely remember this rate. It must have been in the Before Time.

**throwaway-7650** (8.000): TK snapped, us voters... :grinny:

**plastichaxan** (7.667): idk it’s hard to have thoughts on a rate this free and open-for-all (with money) other than “I wish Mon Laferte’s song was here”

**fadedblue09** (5.667): Still my favorite rate this year. A 2000s acoustic pop song winning against a synthpop song from a popheads fave? We are in a new era truly

this :handshake: plastic love winning

ruining the odds of a citypop rate

---

#STAY WITH MEEEEE

**bo\_g\_o** (11): the city pop takeover is real and y'all aren't prepared for it

**DefaultPophead** (11): I just went with my gut when picking my 11. まだ忘れず 大事にしていた。

**1998tweety** (10): love city pop

**2dina3dworld** (10): I love citypop!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a bop

**akanewasright** (10): I think I prefer this to plastic love? Either way, it’s fucking wonderful

**bbfan132** (10): still dancing to this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Not the TikTok rate being the only one to get a perfect 30/30 rating from me. Deserved - y’all submitted three impeccable bops.

**camerinian** (10): not giving this a 10 the first time around was the biggest mistake I think I’ve ever made while rating, and I still gave it a 9. This is just perfection from head to toe in a pretty fucking obvious way

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): GOD i wish i had another 11 to give this is SUBLIME

**hikkaru** (10): citypopheads come through after plastic love's win yass

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I would always stay with you queen

**jman457** (10): ok but this transitioned from the 60’s pop so smoothly

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): <3

**qazz23** (10): Great vocals and sax solo

**ReallyCreative** (10): the collapse

**rslashpoopheads** (10): how many rates can she keep winning

**skargardin** (10): Hold on i LOVE this

**Stryxen** (10): iconic classic banger

**throwaway-7650** (10): can't believe I didn't give this a 10 in tiktok.

**TiltControls** (10): the smasha. WAP was the obvious favourite but I'm glad this made top 2!

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): It still bops

**welcome2thejam** (10): As if I'm gonna shaft a city pop classic

**xearomis** (10): City pop

**homestarguy** (9.5): Pure City Pop bliss. The groove is immaculate: the melodic bass, the shimmering keyboards, groovy guitars, muted brass. And Miki's voice...so wonderful.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.2): i absolutely love this. injected straight into my coffee shop playlist

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Part of the reason I was so against the inclusion of “WAP” in this rate is because I just knew it would end up steamrolling and robbing a song that was more representative of what the TikTok Grab Bag was about… this should be in Winners, not here.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): TikTok has taste?

**waluigiest** (9): take me back

**wavingwolves** (8.5): oh i know citypopheads will show up in a way they didn't do for korean smash FAIRY OF SHAMPOO last month

**seanderlust** (8.3): i still don't entirely know what city pop is other than music that makes me feel like a cute 20-something girl going shopping in the higher-end shops in my city's financial district. she's wearing a skirt that ends just above the knee, the sun is beaming, and she's spending her hard earned money on fashionable and surprisingly affordable finds from the boutiques. and idk i guess there are some funky synths too.

**BasedButta** (8): once you get past the underwhelming first-half verses, everything in it sounds great, i love the way she sings. and everyone loves sax solos don’t they

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the verses don’t hit as hard as the chorus but it’s still excellent and there’s no bad songs with a sax solo

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): yeah its good

**vayyiqra** (8): I am once again calling a pop song with saxophone "city pop"

#vine compilations

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): you will never be plastic love.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): still a little overrated tbh

**bigbigbee** (7.5): someday I too will be an old asian woman, and I regret that the songs that I'll be nostalgic for will be nowhere near as classy as this one

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): Not my cup of tea, but it’s grown on me

**plastichaxan** (7): this score was absolutely tanked-ish by the win of plastic love

**trixiematthell** (6.9): she looks so happy on the cover :)

**iniekcja\_** (6.5): I have no idea if this is the song i was supposed to be listening to

**jaztinax** (6.5): it’s cute

**Alumineous** (6): Usually city pop songs with average verses is saved by the instrumentation and production, but this one is not. Those instruments sound like they’re wilting and in need of water. Except the bass guitar at the end, that was kinda dope.

**runaway3212** (6): no thanks im gonna move to new york

**Awkward\_King** (5): is this citypop

**sweetnsaursauce11** (2): this is boring

this is fairly accurate; it is music that sounds like it should be playing while in department stores, riding elevators in building, driving downtown or taking a taxicab. the time period is vague; it could be any time from the mid-70s to the late 80s

now make that genre of shoppingcore downtown music be japanese and add horns and yeah that's it that's the vibe

#faster pussycat

**1998tweety** (10): spill

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THE SUPREMES (with Diana Ross) WERE EVERYTHING

**akanewasright** (10): I think this is my favorite of the mildly codependent songs in this rate

**Awkward\_King** (10): heavenly

**bbfan132** (10): a classic

**bridgemoney** (10): I absolutely love the message of this song.

**camerinian** (10): just literally everything I love about Motown rolled into one perfect package. Perfectly played instrumentation produced with just a hint of a ramshackle groove, and an all time legendary chorus backed by incredible performances by Diana and the backing vocalists in perfect unison. The Motown machine as its height was unparalleled

**emayzee** (10): who else was doing it like the motown girlies?

**frogaranaman** (10): didn't realize the clothing brand made such good music

**ImADudeDuh** (10): invented waiting for marriage

**just\_thonking** (10): That won't stop me from trying

**mudkip1** (10): what a gorgeous, happy pop song

**qazz23** (10): One of the greatest melodies ever (11 candidate)

**Roxieloxie** (10): Congrats to rate winner The Supremes, Happy Black History Month we did it popheads

**runaway3212** (10): @venus hi bestie please hurry love for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the harmonies!!! such an all time classic

**thedoctordances1940** (10): an all time classic

**TiltControls** (10): This was winning 60s for the first month or so and it would've been a smash. Still you know you've got a good song on your hands if Phil Collins can make a hit out of it (please don't hurt me Phil stans I actually love a lot of his songs dsksdk)

**vayyiqra** (10): classic

**welcome2thejam** (10): Unstoppable, undeniable bop

**xearomis** (10): A classic for a reason

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): the supremes really had smash after smash after smash huh

**homestarguy** (9.5): Such a sugary sweet pop song that has stood the test of time.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): I wish I could go back in time and change some of my scores in the 60s Pop/soul Rate. I committed some really irredeemable crimes, like giving this a 7??? WTF

**jsonphile** (9.5): if this was You Keep Me Hangin On it would’ve been a 10

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): ladies some of us are impatient we need solutions

**bo\_g\_o** (9): this bops

**rslashpoopheads** (9): timeless classic

**skargardin** (9): Words to live by honestly, it's oddly comforting

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.7): “Ya can’t hurry love” huh? I think a lot of singers in the 60s rate needed to learn that

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): ….The Phil Collins version is a 10 tho.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): :daisybop:

**wavingwolves** (8.1): :cookiesing:

**iniekcja\_** (8): well I'd be glad if i could!!

#vote for traditional pop

**sweetnsaursauce11** (7.8): this is how u do catchy

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): The Ronettes were better

**cherryices** (7): my least favourite supremes option i fear

**NotWith10000Men** (7): cute and sunny

**trixiematthell** (7): legends

**shhhneak** (6.9): Way way way way way too short.

**jman457** (6.7): The og Britney spears, it this sounds kind of manufactured

**waluigiest** (6): ooh watch me watch me

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): I love Diana Ross and her work with the Supremes but this song has never done anything for me, it’s got a nice groove but I feel like it lacks the sonic depth that their best work has.

**nicolas<3** (5): overrated

**Stryxen** (5): nothing really happens and it’s not really fun. it’s a pleasant listen but i would probably always skip it

**AHSWeeknd** (11): away away away away #away

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): This is one of the most effective songs about emotional pain that I’ve ever heard.

**buddhacharm** (11): this song genuinely saved my life I think — literally wanted to burst into tears the other day for the first time in like 7 years listening to it (not necessarily because of the feelings that I associate with the song but solely because of how much I just...love Solange lmao)

**camerinian** (11): I regret not getting my ballot in on time for this one, because I missed the chance to just fawn over this. One of the most effortlessly gorgeous songs I've ever had the pleasure of hearing. Solange's delivery is poised and brittle at the same time, the harmonisations are beautiful, and the production is note perfect in its spaciousness but its concurrent commitment to the incredible melodies. Just gorgeous, heartbreaking, devastating and awe-inspiring all in equal measure.

**fadedblue09** (11): Worth giving an 11 again and again

**nootnoot781** (11): i’m so serious i will have a breakdown if this goes out before day 3. like i genuinely don’t think i could stomach seeing “#23 Cranes In The Sky I 7.995 I 995.3”.

**ReallyCreative** (11): one of the best songs ever made; timeless, gorgeous, incredible. Let's make one thing very clear, your fave could not do this!

**Roxieloxie** (11): I've known this song since it came out, Its probably solanges' most mainstream song, which is why I was so against it winning bcc, having the most well known song in a rate composed of some of the most amazing black art the 2014-2016 period gave us just felt like such a cop out knowing popheads demographics. Which is why it may be shocking to see my 11 this. I've known this song since it came out but something about hearing it this year, it felt like something in me broke. I turned 20 in my childhood bedroom, while virtual in a pandemic 2021. I've been in one of the worst mental headspaces ive been in years. A lot of personal and family things happen that have absolutely shattered me. So much around me keeps changing despite how much I try and ignore it or beg for it not to and i have to just keep going with it, and like solange lamenting about the growing gentrification going on around her , another thing we have in common lol, sometimes I dont wanna face those metal clouds. and this song just captures that grief and emotion that I cant express to most, so yeah its my 11

**SinfulAnarchy** (11): sweeping, gorgeous, intimate

**akanewasright** (10): This is one of those songs that is OBVIOUSLY beautiful and amazing and good… but at some point I went from appreciating it and liking it to *really* loving it. This was a late addition to my anxiety playlist, and a really lovely one

**Awkward\_King** (10): there arent many songs that i feel like you could actually call one of the best songs of all time but like... i really feel like this has to be up there, its literally godly

**bbfan132** (10): ugh this is sublime

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): honestly one of the most gorgeous and devastating songs ever recorded

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song just keeps getting better (even if the problems it’s addressing don’t)

**homestarguy** (10): Absolutely blown away by this one. Her high vocals at the end pushed me over the tear threshold.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i reddit away….

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): catcry x30

**mudkip1** (10): just beautiful gorgeous iconic revolutionary

**runaway3212** (10): what if as a prank this won the rate instead of leaving day 2 for some stupid reason

**skargardin** (10): insanely gorgeous

**terrencelovescum** (10): so happy yet depressing. peaceful yet tumultuous. light and freeing yet heavy.

**throwaway-7650** (10): this would slay as the BCC rate winner tbh...

**TiltControls** (10): This is gonna get robbed and I'm going to be pissed

**UselessTacooo** (10): Solange is such a beautiful singer and I need more

**vayyiqra** (10): :poohascending: One of the most unique songs I've ever heard. It's hard to describe why. It's just the feeling it evokes.

**waluigiest** (10): one thing about me is I’m gonna love a beautiful song about depression

**wavingwolves** (10): just solange doo doo doo doo'ing her way into a 10

**welcome2thejam** (10): Stunning, just gotta sit here and bask in it. Really have to get around to this album sooner rather than later

**apatel27** (9.5): Beautiful Song

**1998tweety** (9): good song

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (9): listen to the song explorer podcast thing about this song if you haven’t already

**qazz23** (9): great vocals and bass

**shhhneak** (8.6): Met Gala behaviour

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnnKmbOCdEI

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Pretty calming to listen to

**trixiematthell** (7.5): yes

**jman457** (7.4): Cute but not my fav from Solange

**sweetnsaursauce11** (7.2): the way she sings cranes in the sky gives me goosebumps

**IIIHenryIII** (7): she sounds like an angel, but the track lacks something to keep me entertained

**nicolas<3** (7): liked the chill vibe

**rslashpoopheads** (5): boring

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i dont really get the hype around this one. i like the way she sings i guess

**MrMoodle** (4): this song drives me a bit crazy. the string section just kind of continuously whines without ever resolving, it’s so unsatisfying. it reminds me of this really delicate silky curtain i used to have, i’d be sitting there and a gentle breeze would pass through the window and the curtain would lightly brush my leg, and it was SO gentle and SO unassertive that one day after being trapped there for hours with this stupid piece of fabric taunting me like a little bitch i just snapped and impulsively yanked it down, which was a mistake bc the whole pole it was hanging off came down with it and i almost concussed myself. anyway that’s how i feel about this song

**xearomis** (2): Idk it just feels very monotonous and doesn’t go anywhere?

#all that we could do with this emotion

**CritneySpearz** (11): this song literally makes me want to dance, cry, shit myself, etc all at the same time

**1998tweety** (10): IN YOUR FANTASY

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Underrated

**BasedButta** (10): this song is something else, i cant comprehend how it can always get me going, i don’t even think it’s that good logically but fuck it EMOTION TIME oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh :woeis:

**bbfan132** (10): brings me back to 2015 and i love the time machine!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Simply one of the best title tracks of all time.

**camerinian** (10): hope that person who posted "whatever happened to Carly Rae Jepsen" a few weeks ago sees this

**fadedblue09** (10): Best song on the album finally gets its chance to shine

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I have to sing along with this song, that “be tormented by me babe” just bursts out of me the second that synth hits

**hikkaru** (10): everyone's gonna complain when this gets into the top 10 despite giving it good scores

**homestarguy** (10): :) (A perfect song, and gotta give it a 10 out of principal since the co-writer of it went to my high school.)

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I hope this wins so we can achieve popheads peace

**jasannn** (10): Hey universe, find me someone to like so I can feel this way.

**letsallpoo** (10): haha wouldnt it be funny if this won haha oh god

**moooo566** (10): this is so good, someone should make a subreddit where we can properly appreciate the pop music stylings of carly rae jepsen

**ReallyCreative** (10): a classic

**Roxieloxie** (10): very yass and slay

**runaway3212** (10): I wish I could feel emotion sadly im just a self aware robot

**skargardin** (10): it's the serve

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): is this the rate villain :(

**TiltControls** (10): there's no going wrong with this album

**vayyiqra** (10): Slightly warm take: this song is just as much Pop Perfection tm as the opening track is.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Better than Run Away With Me…. yeah I said it

**welcome2thejam** (10): Favorite thing to do is sing along to that little synthline in the chorus

**IIIHenryIII** (9.7): what’s this bridge? Carly, you're not allowed to do that

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): a perfect title track

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): a thesis statement!

**waluigiest** (9): just hearing this song makes me remember how magical the whole album is

**slimboyfriend** (8.7): make no mistake……. This album is a 10

**akanewasright** (8.5): I will never understand why this is a *favorite* on an album with so many gray highlights… but it’s still a very good song

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): gay people everywhere cheered

**jman457** (8.4): This is just too good. Im just worried it will do better than a lot of amazing songs

**nicolas<3** (8): at the bottom of top emotion tracks but still really good

**plastichaxan** (8): please don’t win and make me regret this score please don’t win and make me regret this score please don’t win and make me regret this score

**rslashpoopheads** (8): indie queen

**SinfulAnarchy** (8): this is good but i’m going to be annoyed when it survives day 3

**Stryxen** (8): this is gonna last way too long and everyone is gonna be mad about it

#only anger

**trixiematthell** (7.8): justice for emotion

**wavingwolves** (7.5): seething over the fact this isn't GIMMIE LOVE or MAKING THE MOST OF THE NIGHT

**sweetnsaursauce11** (7.3): this is just such a fun song

**bo\_g\_o** (6): I admit there weren't many great picks from this rate but still you guys could've voted in something better than this

**NotWith10000Men** (6): i'm a bad pophead

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i feel like im committing popheads sacrilege everytime i leave a mediocre score on a carly song but no amount of praise will ever make me understand the hype or what makes her better than any other generic white pop girl

**UselessTacooo** (4.5): I’m sorry but I can’t get behind CRJ like you all do. Nothing she does sounds original, and that’s a huge dealbreaker for me. Emotion is one of her better songs, but I’m not going to sit here and say it’s incredible.

**seanderlust** (3): i was pretty meh on this song in its rate. of all the songs on EMOTION this is the one that i'm not entirely clear why it clicks so well for people. it is fun but it feels pretty unremarkable and I literally forget what it sounds like the second it ends

**vayyiqra** (10.000): An idea I was once against, years ago, but ended up liking a lot. Some wack results, but what did we expect. The right song won at least.

**AHSWeeknd** (10.000): Is rerate a word?

**runaway3212** (9.667): we love ricki forcing this in

**throwaway-7650** (9.500): we wanted making the most of the night instead

**RandomHypnotica** (8.233): this rate blocked sweetenermore 2. interpret that how you will.

**TiltControls** (7.667): So glad we got to do this, especially since these were 3 massive albums and most raters weren't around for the OG rate (plus there were so many bad placements that needed to be fixed - thank god for the Clean jump). Plus you know any rate with Poo, Ricki, and Dude is going to be amazing

**plastichaxan** (5.333): this being here is odd but i’ll take it, i just hope neither of these get far

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.000): the whiplash going through these three omg

#the it factor

**MrMoodle** (11): yeah when i realised this song was in the rate i went back and adjusted the scores for everything else because it’s just so fucking good it threw off the accuracy of the ratios between song scores. the way she delivers “this is crazy” makes me clutch my heart ugh

**shhhneak** (11): It’s hard to find a song to represent how masterful The Miseducation Of is but this is a damn good choice.

**sufjancaesar** (11): Genuinely perfect, evocative and one of the most atmospheric and nostalgic tracks ever for me

**AHSWeeknd** (10): How did this not win it’s original rate???

**akanewasright** (10): Let me not talk about why this song clicked with me so hard and just say “ooh fun drake sample”

**anothertown** (10): CARE FOR ME CARE FOR ME

**bbfan132** (10): this was such a close finish lmao

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): One of the best bridges ever I know that’s right.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): I should really listen to more neo soul

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I talked Sam (my wonderful co-host for this rate) out of sending this as one of our All Stars picks because I reasoned it would get voted in anyways AND because I figured it would perform about the same in All Stars as it did in the original Neo-Soul Rate: makes it far but loses and all of the rate comments mention “Nice For What.” This is too good of a song to just be reduced to a sample though, the lyrics are so raw and desperate and you can *hear* the pain in Lauryn’s voice. This is the artistry that makes people willing to buy tickets to her shows even though she hasn’t shown up to one on time in twenty years.

**homestarguy** (10): Absolutely heavenly. The last two minutes with the call and response vocals some of the best recorded music in the 90s.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A perfect song that should have won! Not that Doo Wop isn’t also a 10 but this is another level

**IIIHenryIII** (10): 5 minutes and 26 seconds of pure perfection

**jman457** (10): This is just iconic. As much as I love Doo Woop, this should have won the original rate.

**just\_thonking** (10): Ex Factor?! I hardly even know her!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): YASSS so close to being my 11 here

**mudkip1** (10): iconic

**ReallyCreative** (10): deserved to win omg still upset about this one

**ricki** (10): no one @ me

**Roxieloxie** (10): I hate the fact that this song got in over some of the others but I cant be /that/ mad because its one of my favorite songs from this cycle.

**runaway3212** (10): Drake is like kah the face stealer but instead he steals good songs

**Stryxen** (10): i’ve come to realise this is better than doo wop oops

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): omg the Drake song but good

**throwaway-7650** (10): just found that camila covered this on the X factor

**TragicKingdom1** (10): nice for what is better but still a classic obvi

**vayyiqra** (10): A song so incredible even Drake couldn't make it worse

**welcome2thejam** (10): Song just adds on more and more incredible moments, from the "No one loves you more than me/No one's hurt me more than you" switch-up to the "Care for me care for me" bit that gets everyone

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): the reason this lost its rate should be on the rates iceberg

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): the song just kinda slays, especially the last minute where everything just coalesces and then the guitar outro is just ugh

**jsonphile** (9.5): I mean it helped give Drake one of his best songs of his career. Also possibly the last time I really enjoyed a Drake song but I suppose I should stop talking about a mediocre man when rating a song by one of the most talented women in hip hop

**TiltControls** (9.5): To think this spot almost was going to be Doo Wop

**wavingwolves** (9.5): made me release a breath i didn't know i was holding just like a fanfic character

**1998tweety** (9): ended fadrake

**nicolas<3** (9): girl i was gagging

**plastichaxan** (9): lauryn never missed… in her one album

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): How many times does she say "yo" in this song again? I don't think she says it enough.

**skargardin** (9): the breakdown is so good

**static\_int\_husp** (9): wow, so glad that Drake decided to sample this small, unkown artist on Nice For What, it really put her on the map \s

**sweetnsaursauce11** (9): omg this was amazing

**waluigiest** (9): this song has it all. The harmonies, the drums, the guitar solo. Tons of special moments.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.2): I’m so proud to say that I’ve never actually listened to Nice for What in its entirety 😌

**rslashpoopheads** (8): did this just get put in because popheads might actually recognize it from the sample lol

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): im so used to hearing the sample of this song in nice for what that it almost sounds out of place when i listen to it in the actual context of the song lol

**thedoctordances1940** (8): this really picks up towards the end, otherwise it's just like good

#drake

**trixiematthell** (7.5): simon cowell’s impact 🤩

**Awkward\_King** (7): i want to listen to this in a park in summertime

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (7): I can’t read the title without thinking about the show Natalia Kills killed her career on

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): Doo Wop winning was right

**moonagenightmares** (5.5): im sorry but this is so boring. doo wop and everyhing is everything outsold

**BasedButta** (5): mostly boring but has nice polyphony and a good guitar solo

**terrencelovescum** (4): probably one of the hottest takes i have...but this is the most overrated song on the album.

**runaway3212** (9.333): I feel so sad people who only did all stars will never know who jill scott is

**welcome2thejam** (9.000): Maybe I gave Jill the slightly worse score, but hey, in her song she's still in a relationship so who's the real winner

**fadedblue09** (8.667): One of my top rates last year. Vote for 2000s Women of Neo Soul next time

**vayyiqra** (8.667): A great rate I had fun going back to last year and listening to the albums in it again. Timeless music.

**plastichaxan** (8.333): this is a very underrated and powerful rate, i loved doing it so much and it got me an 11 win which ill always love

**bigbigbee** (8.167): A rate that feels like a warm, aromatic, cup of coffee and cinnamon!

**Awkward\_King** (8.167): so so so grateful for this rate for getting me into baduizm more, what a brilliant album

**TiltControls** (7.833): The energy of this rate was so great to listen through. Unfortunately my scores won't be amazing cause I had other favourites that didn't make it - but I'd seriously recommend listening to these 3 albums (especially Lauryn's) for anyone who missed the rate. Also a rate that set the standards for rate promo - glad it ended up getting a decent turn out cause Ghost and Sam really worked for those ballots!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Glad he performed this masterpiece at the Super Bowl. Some people may say this is overrated but those people are Bill Clinton.

**akanewasright** (10): Imo this isn’t one of the best songs on the album, but like… it symbolically means a lot and is still a solid 10. So I’m imagining people who are tanking it for that reason explaining to a BLM rally that they should play a different Kendrick song because there are better ones on TPAB djhdhdb

**anothertown** (10): mark mothersbaugh on the track

**apatel27** (10): A goddamn anthem

**bbfan132** (10): yes

**bo\_g\_o** (10): oh boy do I doubt that Kendrick

**camerinian** (10): how do you even reduce a song like this to a numerical score? It's such a key piece of the interweaving of art into the fabric of the collective political consciousness in the modern era and it will outlive every single one of us. It's like seeing a fairy tale written for the first time. Even if the specific moment fades, which it really shouldn't be soon, this song is so intricately tied to forces bigger than any individual including Kendrick himself. It's an anthem pure and simple

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Such an uplifting anthem

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (10): Kendrick is so talented and like I’m drunk but I’m so happy he has a Pulitzer

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The SNL performance of this one is still one of the best of all time

**homestarguy** (10): A song that transcends the actual recording.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the way Pharrell says “alright” I feels leans very close to sounding like alt right and it’s such a cursed though that enters my brain when I hear this. Amazing song though!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): pitchfork made points

**jaztinax** (10): forever one of the best black conscious songs in history tbh

**jsonphile** (10): maybe like fifth best on the album but still a 10/10 this album is just that good

**MrMoodle** (10): why did kendrick get two songs from this rate when d’angelo got ZERO i personally am very much not alright. this song is still great but i’m still mad

**mudkip1** (10): smasha

**nicolas<3** (10): kentucky fried chicken

**plastichaxan** (10): this should be D’Angelo but god this song slaps too hard to give it anything less

**RandomHypnotica** (10): what can I say, it's... more than alright it's amazing!

**Roxieloxie** (10): fuck yall for voting this in. Anyway its black history month so whatever spot this places is how much I expect you all to venmo me

**runaway3212** (10): I really respect this song as a single and I will ignore that it doesnt really fit on the album that much

**skargardin** (10): perfection

**throwaway-7650** (10): the beginning of the MV sounds like a dying deer

**TiltControls** (10): It's a 10 but I wish this was D'Angelo or like 3 other Kendrick tracks (These Walls deserved!!!)

**UselessTacooo** (10): Kendrick is on a whole different level.

**vayyiqra** (10): I hope Kendrick is having a great day

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I mean it’s a perfect song. Also flashbacks to when I first heard it and I thought he said “We’ve been up and down before” and he just pronounced “up” like “urp” for some reason

**waluigiest** (10): if this rate is All Stars 5, this song is Shea Coulee. It’s an easy contender for best song of the 2010’s.

**welcome2thejam** (10): The most immaculate flows around, I honestly don't even know what else to say about Kendrick that hasn't already

**seanderlust** (9.5): i'm not going to look any of you in the eye and tell you that this song is less than a 9.5, even in the elevated setting of All Stars, even if I lowkey want Wesley's Theory to go further. it's uplifting and defiant, especially in the narrative of the album

**jman457** (9.3): A modern protest classic

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.9): I love the saxophone ad-libbing in the background, shoutout to Terrace Martin

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): better out of the context of the album, but still nowhere near the best on TPAB

**NotWith10000Men** (8.3): not to be a straight american on popheads but this was dope in the halftime show

**1998tweety** (8): its alright

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Maybe one of my least favorite songs on To Pimp a Butterfly which is to say it’s still really good.

**SinfulAnarchy** (8): out of all the TPAB songs to get voted in, why’d it have to be this one

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8): i needed this to be released during the pandemic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): that title did not lie. this sure is alright

#thoughts and prayers

**ricki** (7.8): works a lot better in the context of the album but it’s still fun

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I was never a fan of this one, the da-da-da just gets me on my nerves, it's kinda annoying

**trixiematthell** (7.4): we gone be alright

**ReallyCreative** (7): I am weaker on this song than most people but I wouldn't be upset if it did well

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.8): appropriately titled but at least there's an idea behind it

**rslashpoopheads** (5): alright

**wavingwolves** (5): repeating my score from the first hhh rate and i have to admit i inflated this one a lot during bcc and i regret it but i just came to actively dislike the hook as time passed

**BasedButta** (4): i think i like this guy’s style now (didnt know him) but i reallllllly wanted to skip the song, didnt like it

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): tpab is literally one of my favourite albums of all time but i just find the hook to this song so annoying. if it was any other song from this album a 10 would be here instead but…

#donate to roxie's venmo

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This album will never get old

**akanewasright** (10): maybe I should’ve 11d this in BCC

**anothertown** (10): i can't believe donald glover listened to this and still was like "sure i'll make p-funk too" and thought it would be good.

**Awkward\_King** (10): kendrick's writing is anything but underrated but like..,,. it would be a disservice to rate this song and NOT mention how fucking brilliantly interwoven all the lyrics on this song are, and then across the whole album,,. he's just a genius

**bbfan132** (10): production <3 a++++ tier features

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I mean what is there to say? This is one of those songs that’s just obviously great. If you don’t like it - that’s a you problem.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): 🥜

**camerinian** (10): Literally no elaboration is needed here

**cremeebrulee** (10): this being the most relatable song here because i also did not pass economics in school

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (10): I love the features on this

**flavasavavandal** (10): I should’ve done this rate, even if just to see how high my average for TPAB would’ve been

**frogaranaman** (10): did he ever get his nut

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorites from the album, it’s such a good intro

**IIIHenryIII** (10): at first, I did love it, but now I just love it even more

**iniekcja\_** (10): one of my favorite things to do is pretending that I know enough about Kendrick Lamar to hold a conversation

**jman457** (10): Fantastic start to a fantastic album

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): kinda one of the best album intros ever

**MrMoodle** (10): i absolutely adore the instrumental on this track, it’s so frantic and disorienting (while still being pretty accessible, somehow?) that it DEMANDS you give the song and the album your full attention, killer opening track

**ReallyCreative** (10): shoutouts to my lowest grade in college being a theory course, I'm a praxis girl ONLY

**Roxieloxie** (10): My mind sending in a song to this rate over 90% of the raterbase has to just 🧍🏾 for most of the chorus

**rslashpoopheads** (10): a real funker

**runaway3212** (10): Personally I would like to fuck capitalism in the ass

**seanderlust** (10): incredible production, thundercat and george clinton are both legends, and densely packed lyrically. what more could you want, honestly? this track and the next one where a girl just talks shit for two minutes over free jazz are the ultimate two opening tracks of any album ever

**skargardin** (10): pretty much the perfect intro isn't it

**Stryxen** (10): this has a habit of dark horsing like top 5 in every rate its in :waiting2:

**sufjancaesar** (10): One of my all-time favourite album openers

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this may be the best album opener of all time

**throwaway-7650** (10): I don't remember this from maths class

**wavingwolves** (10): i can never get tired of the voice effect on "look both ways before you cross my mind" part ugh what a classic!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Oh funk yeah

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I love this song, I think it’s so perfect for the opening of this incredible album. It sounds like you’re falling, spiraling downward into the world of this album. God it’s so good

**homestarguy** (9.5): P-Funk plus Kendrick's playful bars equals jam.

**jaztinax** (9.5): i keep forgetting how good this song is

**jsonphile** (9.5): a killer opening track for one of the best albums of all time

**TiltControls** (9.5): Not one of the track's I'll typically revisit for TPAB, but it's still better than half of this rate

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Mr. Wesley is making some points with this one!

**nicolas<3** (9): finally some good fucking food

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): god this groove is funky

**vayyiqra** (9): A fascinating bizarre psychedelic song.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.9): this is so groovy

**sweetnsaursauce11** (8.6): the groove in this is infectious

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): wibble wobble space music 👽

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.5): The verses are very well-written and I get the message he’s going for… but what does him getting his nut have to do with it 🤔

**waluigiest** (8): I loved doing this rate but I need to spend 100 more hours with this album to absorb it

#matpat

**1998tweety** (7.5): alright

**trixiematthell** (6.1): i need to read the lyrics bc i'm too dumb to get songs on first listen

**BasedButta** (6): good beat

**shhhneak** (5.8): “Until I get my nut” is such an awful lyric.

**fadedblue09** (5.5): surprised how this placed cuz to me this is just an intro

**throwaway-7650** (10.000): perfect 10 average and wish I could do it [2]

**TiltControls** (9.833): Probably one of my highest overall rate averages I've ever sent in (if you ignore the biased scores I send in from my own rates). Hoping these tracks make it far (even if I worry they won't). Roxie and PB did too good with this rate to have it flop in all stars

**vayyiqra** (9.667): The time we ended Roxiephobia, thinkpieces were shared, a great rate. (Other than for poor D'angelo :cry:)

**Awkward\_King** (9.500): its been a year and i literally still feel bad for roxie like... when will it end

**Alumineous** (9.333): Kosmi was literally breaking down. And I don’t know how, but we heard Roxie’s voice on Kosmi? That’s all I remember. Plus, INTERLUDES! On a serious note, this was a difficult rate. The scores didn’t really matter, though. It was an educational rate. I wish we had more of those.

**plastichaxan** (9.167): the way this rate was overshadowed by a rate with taylor swift and chromatica of all gaga albums is criminal

#feel good

**apatel27** (11): This better not land anywhere below top 10. A masterpiece in every sense of the word.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): Nina has meant the world to me for so many years. Hearing her music in high school hugely shaped my worldview and I found solace in her voice that could convey so many emotions at once. This is one of my all-time favorites, her defiant joy through all of this is exhilerating!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This song should be in the library of congress.

**akanewasright** (10): Icon, fucking brilliant icon

**anothertown** (10): how this song didnt win its rate i dont know.

**bbfan132** (10): excellent, robbed in its original rate!

**bigbigbee** (10): I only regret that the first time I heard this song was Michael Bublé...not even his cover, it was a video like "TEN TIMES FANS SURPRISED CELEBS!!!" and it was some teenage white boy in the audience singing this at a Michael concert

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (10): almost my eleven so good

**GapeCod** (10): The most deserving winner among the 78 songs.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): We love a song from a musical (*The Roar Of The Greasepaint, The Smell Of The Crowd*)

**iniekcja\_** (10): and it's fuck Michael Bubble!!

**jman457** (10): Nina Simone really paved the way for everyone

**jsonphile** (10): it is physically impossible to not feel like the baddest bitch while listening to this song

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): nina never missed

**NotWith10000Men** (10): such a powerful voice. opening the song acapella was the perfect choice. second perfect choice was the way the music comes in

**plastichaxan** (10): i love you nina simone

**RandomHypnotica** (10): certainly not me after seeing rate results

**ReallyCreative** (10): iconic, timeless, absolutely legendary, but I can't relate bestie!

**Roxieloxie** (10): Congrats to rate winner Nina Simone Happy black history month we did it popheads

**rslashpoopheads** (10): this will be playing in the background when I seize the means of production

**runaway3212** (10): nina’s voice is like so enticing and entrancing and also perfect

**shhhneak** (10): This song is ancient but that intro with the horns kicking in gives me chills every time.

**skargardin** (10): an 11 contender if there ever was one

**Stryxen** (10): just a flawless song i would 11 it again, but actually i wouldn’t

**throwaway-7650** (10): rate winner (get it right this time r/popheads)

**TiltControls** (10): While the entire top 10 was 10s, I was pulling a little for the Nina win. Hopefully she can make it far here

**UselessTacooo** (10): This song is iconic and deserves all the 10’s in the world. It feels so grand

**waluigiest** (10): the note at the end?? hello??

**welcome2thejam** (10): Nina I'm so sorry for giving you a nine last time let me make it up to you

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): I don’t have much to say about this song because it’s excellent so please enjoy this meme Akane made about me and ddr during a watch party for Summer of Soul that caused me pain to host

**wavingwolves** (9.5): it's just a slay

**bo\_g\_o** (9): I am indeed feeling good listening to this

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): americans are we all thinking of the same commercial

**hikkaru** (9): another song that like one person tanked and knocked it down from a deserved win omfg

**homestarguy** (9): The ultimate swagger standard, and Nina brings it here.

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): invented feeling good

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Me when I'm feeling good

**MrMoodle** (8.5): this is a better bond theme song than literally any bond theme song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Oh those horns are NASTY.

**nicolas<3** (8): this was loudly playing in the background as i cried while trying to kill a massive cockroach it was quite dramatic

**SinfulAnarchy** (8): the way this was covered in every singing show ever

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): im about to make the whitest comment of all time when i say this. but i prefer the muse version
#feel bad

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I really like these instruments

**trixiematthell** (6.6): good but unfortunately reminds me of xfactor

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): i hate that this just makes me think of like cheap christmas ads and trashy x factor live show performances

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.3): …is this a safe place to say I don’t like her voice 😬

**BasedButta** (6): incredible brass instrument usage, but it does not need the 40 second podcast at the start. sorry i feel really bad for saying this but if im going to listen to a song, i would like to see some instruments! otherwise i just feel like you’re wasting my time, its just not good to listen to 95% of the time, and its not the artists fault (her voice is cool). maybe i just dont like the genre idk

**camerinian** (6): Really wish this song wasn't so driven into the ground by the X Factor/jewelry commercial mill. If this score is an issue for you, take it up with the CEO of capitalism

**sweetnsaursauce11** (6): it's good but not my taste

**Uberpigeon** (6): this song is everywhere and i have never really liked it i am sorry

**vayyiqra** (5): wish I liked this more because it's Nina Simone

And so, Aretha falls just short! This is a lovely song, but and while it was winning at first, at least it has overcome Nina Simone, as it couldn't in the original rate!

#respect women

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Invented feminism

**kellyrabbit1105** (11): We had to sing this during 6th grade assembly and yet I still think its great. If that isn't 11 criteria I don't know what is.

**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (11): Lots of great songs in this rate, but this is such a timeless anthem

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Spelling is in fact fun

**akanewasright** (10): I mean… this is probably top 3 most iconic songs of all time

**bbfan132** (10): insert the video of me singing this at madame tussauds at age 6 or 7

**CarlieScion** (10): close to my 11

**fadedblue09** (10): I want this to pull a Dancing Queen

**homestarguy** (10): I mean come on, it's freakin' "Respect" by The Queen of Soul.

**jaztinax** (10): this is how you cover a song

**jman457** (10): Rolling Stone snapped with this pic

**jsonphile** (10): y’all better put some respect on Aretha and give her your 10s

**ReallyCreative** (10): I can't physically imagine giving this below a 10

**Roxieloxie** (10): Congrats to rate winner Aretha Franklin, Happy Black History Month we did it popheads

**rslashpoopheads** (10): the power that Aretha has

**runaway3212** (10): I keep thinking “this is an obvious winner” about like 10 different songs

**skargardin** (10): this reminds me of that i need to watch RESPECT

**TiltControls** (10): Will Popheads affirm Rolling Stone's claims that this is the best song of all time? If they have taste they might! (so probably won't happen)

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): popheads be like “Give me my poppers when you get home!”

**wavingwolves** (9.8): yes this makes me think of glee and yes mercedes put her whole mussy when she sang that but yes so did aretha

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): Not to be a Rolling Stones apologist but they made points when they declared this as the greatest song of all time even if it isn’t even top 10 in this rate

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): those who give this song a slow score, she literally asking to give a little respect smh

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): weirdly feel like it ends too soon

**shhhneak** (9.1): Ririririri

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): A classic for a reason.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): she has better but this is so legendary

**emayzee** (9): ok i love this song but i can't disassociate it with my memories of going to johnny rockets as a kid in the 2000s and this playing on the speakers every hour where the teenage minimum waged workers would have to drop what they were doing to perform a choreographed dance. so every time i hear this my mind just thinks of johnny rockets onion rings but in the best way

**MrMoodle** (9): if this released now these bitches on popheads would be like “mmm less than 2:30? so sick of tiktok bait”

**sweetnsaursauce11** (9): classic

**waluigiest** (9): it’s just correct

**Awkward\_King** (8): misha b outsold

**bigbigbee** (8): I’m so sorry, this song is objectively incredible, it is just one of the songs from this rate that the Overplay Machine got to, for me

**bo\_g\_o** (8): I'm not head over heels in love with this song but I do respect it a lot

**mudkip1** (8): I’m shocked that this is just barely 2 mins long. Miss Aretha was doing short bops before all of our faves

**Stryxen** (8): it’s a shame the streaming era means artists make their songs so short. this deserves a (Ten Minute Version)

**UselessTacooo** (8): it’s so fun omg 😭

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): im giving this song the same score i'd give the aretha franklin movie that i watched with my mom last night

**trixiematthell** (7.3): we have to put some respect on her name now come on

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I’d be crazy to say that I think this is *bad* but I’ve never really enjoyed listening to ti

**IIIHenryIII** (7): Hey, popheads! Spelling is fun!

**SinfulAnarchy** (7): i admire her cultural impact and longevity but this song doesn’t do anything for me (this lineup is so chaotic bc the fact that i’m giving pitbull a higher score than aretha franklin lmao)

**welcome2thejam** (7): Once again, overplay means I respect Respect more than I actually like hearing it

**tkajilili** (6): yeah, this is a classic but it's never been a favorite

OUR WINNER!!! Ungodly Hour should have won its original rate, but that's what All Stars is all about, isn't it? A lovely end to this extremely chaotic rate, but when it's right, it's right.

---

**homestarguy** (11): My god...that chorus. The groove. The slinky keyboards. The lyrics also hit me painfully close as someone who wants love despite not fully loving himself. Perfect song.

**mudkip1** (11): amazing

**1998tweety** (10): im floating

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Hit me with your eyes. No literally take them out and hit me with them… I don’t know why I wrote that but I’m not deleting it.

**akanewasright** (10): Chloe and Halle deserve the actual fucking world

**anothertown** (10): but we need another cxh album

**bbfan132** (10): this production :daisybop:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Deserved to be a multi week number one smash hit but you know we don’t have that level of taste as a species.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): sleek banger

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): still just does something to me, the best Disclosure production since White Noise

**fadedblue09** (10): one of my other 11 choices

**frogaranaman** (10): this is definitely about 3am (the hour)

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song is just a work of art that I don’t even really know what to say about it; it’s perfect, which is actually something I could talk about a little bit I guess. When this album came out people were buzzing about it on popheads and at first I wrote it off because I thought Chloe X Halle were “too perfect” for me but then I stopped and thought about it and I was like wait… is that racist? Because that’s the same shit that people say about Beyoncé. It’s like, we demand that these women be “relatable” and feel “accessible” to us but then pounce on them for doing anything “messy,” but then when they push past all of this and focus solely on their craft they get labelled as stuck up or as robots. And I almost missed out on one of the best albums of the decade (it’s totally not too early for me to say that) because of my prejudices. Idk maybe it’s just me but think about how you interact with black artists is what I’m trying to say I guess. Anyways, this song is a stunning blend of pop/r&b/dance with a bridge that could span the Atlantic, long live Chloe X Halle and may your every hour be ungodly.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): perfect song from an amazing album

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Let me tell you, when I perform this alone in my room and pretend to have another person performing with me and we trade off the lyrics in our performance of this, it is a serve!

**iniekcja\_** (10): call out my name yassified

**jman457** (10): Disclosure snapped with this production

**NotWith10000Men** (10): ungodly prechorus and chorus

**qazz23** (10): Very strong and hook-filled chorus

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is literally what the clubs in heaven sound like

**ReallyCreative** (10): weird naming a song "Ungodly" and then making it absolutely heavenly

**Roxieloxie** (10): this deserved to win

**runaway3212** (10): Chloe x Halle is like Haim if they were trying to be ariana grande

**skargardin** (10): I mean VOCALS

**sweetnsaursauce11** (10): deserved more but at least it's well loved on popheads

**throwaway-7650** (10): stan halle bailey in the little mermaid (2023)!

**TiltControls** (10): So many 10s on this album!! This, Tipsy, Don't Make It Harder On Me, Wonder What She Thinks Of Me, ROYL - so glad we can get some justice for this!

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): As I said before, POP PERFECTION!

**wavingwolves** (10): the easiest 10 ever

**camerinian** (9.5): Disclosure stop being so inconsistent with your collabs challenge

**Awkward\_King** (9): they deserve their cxhussy ate for this one

**Stryxen** (9): banger bop

**vayyiqra** (9): Need to listen to this album more

**waluigiest** (9): yaasified Dire Dire Docks

**trixiematthell** (8.8): the girls did what they had to do

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I actually like this one, but the song just picks up after the bridge

**shhhneak** (8.4): Living in harmony harmONY HARMONY

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): good but overrated

**flavasavavandal** (7): This has grown on me a bit, but I still remember the time I called Forgive Me bad and the 3 CxH have on this sub came at me

**nicolas<3** (7): cute but underwhelming

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): where is Don't Make it Harder on Me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): i feel like this song doesn’t know what it wants to be and just combines a bunch of random elements together and im not sure if it works or not

**BasedButta** (5.5): does not need to be so long for something so mid

**thisusernameisntlong** (10.000): are these normie 10s, I have no idea

**AHSWeeknd** (10.000): Why’d y’all keep Carla Row Joplin off this?? 😭

**Alumineous** (10.000): That Dynasty shitpost was peak comedy.

**TiltControls** (10.000): The only rate that I'm giving all 10s to (other than the ones I hosted). Though I still think y'all were too harsh on Dedicated Side B. Though the real winner in this rate was the audience cause we got to watch King's shitposts. make a rate out of them and I'd probably give it a 10 average. (Though No Body No Cr11me is the true winner)

**throwaway-7650** (9.500): my first ever rate, carly still deserved better (day 3)

**plastichaxan** (9.500): i love this lineup so much this is probably my fa- oh wait there was a 4th album?

**ReallyCreative** (9.333): Carly deserved better, Charli deserved worse!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.300): hifn being one of my highest album averages and flopping so hard... a painful rate

**vayyiqra** (8.333): One of the weirder rates we've done lately, for me anyway. I fully thought Charli would do better and CRJ would flop more.

**Awkward\_King** (7.667): it might be kind of sad, but im not lying when i say hosting this rate (as successfully as i feel like i did) is one of my proudest achievements. it was my first time hosting, and it is still the biggest solo hosted rate on the sub (and third biggest overall) at 196 participants. it was a hell of a lot to handle but looking back on it im so happy it went as it did, and idk, i just think i did well and i dont feel like that often so it is nice

**runaway3212** (7.000): Rina is much better than Sawayama i dont even care

frogaranaman: ty rona for such a wonderful reveal!! these results were a mess but you made it fun to deal with, absolutely killed the reveal. as well.. here's what else I wanted to show y'all regarding some more rate lists

first list is the counterpart to the 11 Fails, the **0 Fails** list. this is when your 0 gets first place and it's pretty exclusive! only **25 raters** have ever had this happen and nobody has done it twice. you can [see the list here](https://pastebin.com/Jsr3HMVt)

&nbsp;

the next two are way more interesting to me, though: the **11 Misses** and the **0 Hits** lists. titles may be confusing so let me explain them

the 11 Misses list is when your 11 gets second place in a rate. and good god, it happens a lot. [you can take a look at the list here](https://pastebin.com/Ce6fuCL0) (I'm only caught up to VH1 for this list, it's that long) and see just how much this shit happens. if you spot anything about this list that needs updating, DM me and I'll get it fixed (mainly if there's a duplicate somewhere that I missed!)

and the 0 Hits list is the counterpart to the 11 Misses, where your 0 gets second place in a rate. you may or may not have caused it to go there, too. this list is much much smaller, with only **26 raters** having a zero go second and only **FOUR** raters have done it more than once. [you can see it here](https://pastebin.com/6de68G4R)

but yeah I think these are really interesting stats to look at overall! hopefully y'all think so too

(**edit:** also, if you were curious: I'm the only one on all four lists. don't know if I should be proud of that or not)

&nbsp;

anyways here's all the links to these lists:

CrimsonROSET: #THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!

Hosting a rate such as this one, I must admit I was terrified to start with, especially never hosting a rate before- but everyone, be it on discord, here on reddit, and others were so supportive and helped me out so much in this process, so thank you all, you know who you are!

A super special shoutouts to u/bigbigbee for being amazing and helping me figure out the graphs, as well as u/Awkward_King \- you know what you did.

TiltControls: RONA THAT WAS SUCH A GOOD REVEAL. MY BLOOD IS STILL RUNNING FAST. HERE ARE SOME STATS

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates! 

#**Songs**

While I still would've liked mine & Roxie's rate to have pulled through, congrats to **Ungodly Hour** for the stellar win!

- **Ungodly Hour** slots in as the 157th highest average song which places it between Eso Que Tu Haces (from HAP, not here) and Clarity (EDM Pop Girl Collabs, not winners)

- As the only other 9+, **Respect** places 285th overall. It ties with Frank Ocean's Lost and places just below The 1975's Somebody Else and above Maroon 5's This Love

Other songfacts

- **Biggest AS5 Flop**

 - George Michael - I Want Your Sex: -2.113 drop

- **Biggest AS5 Glow Up**
 - Missy Elliott - Lose Control: +0.173 gain

- Actually Lose Control was the only song to gain points from its original score (**Stay With Me** came close to breaking even)

- With the double crown of **The Box** and **One Last Kiss**, if you're including winner rate songenialities 100 different songs have now won songeniality!

- **The One That Got Away** joins the most rated songs list with its 4th rate! (Previously had Original TD rate, 2012 Billboard, TD rerate)

#**Artists**

Not going to bother with the adjacent placements since this list is already way too long. Also some of these artists have been rated enough where single songs won't shift them much

**Artist Shifts**

Note that there's two more artists on the list now (Nina Simone and Afrojack) so old rankings were out of 291, new ones are out of 293

NR = Not previously ranked (due to not having enough songs)

Artist Notes:

- With Nina's 5th song rated we have a new leader!! Her average was already a lot higher than most artists, but with not enough songs she had to wait until All Stars. Despite the loss today, she's got the crown for the leaderboards!

- Phoebe Bridgers and Tori Amos drop out of the top 10 artist averages to make way for Nina Simone and Stevie Wonder

 - For reference, the other members of the new top 10 that were not in this rate are Kate Bush, Donna Summer, and Fleetwood Mac

 - Also Bjork drops from the top 25 leaderboard, while Rina makes it back on. Nina being added also caused Megan Thee Stallion to shift one spot off the list

- Lauryn, Erykah, Curtis, Stevie, The Supremes, and Mag Bay all keep their no zeroes streak for a little longer. However, Tori loses hers thanks to a couple 0s on Crucify

 - ~~fwiw Tkay also keeps her 'solo no 0s streak' if that was actually a thing~~

- Rihanna and Taylor have both tied Nicki Minaj for most rate appearances with 19! Between these three artists' numerous rate appearances they have a combined 2 rate wins.

 - For the rest of the list, Ariana and Charli move up to tie with Beyonce right below at 18 and Kesha and The Weeknd are now both on the list with 16

- Solange (9) and Tori Amos (10) fall off the least controversial list (Solange to 11th, Tori to 20th). They are replaced with Marvin Gaye and Jill Scott respectively


#**Rate**

- Despite the usual messiness of redo rates, this ends up being the highest rated All Stars/Winner/Redemption etc. rate ever! It's also the 2nd highest rate grab bag rate after 60's Pop Soul and the 19th highest average rate overall! (Out of 137)

- All Stars 5 also becomes the 5th rate ever where everyone used their 11s! It follows Charity Rate 1, Pet Sounds vs. Abbey Road vs. Rumours, She's So Unusual vs. Madonna vs. Forever Your Girl vs. Whitney Houston, and Hopelessness vs. Kick I vs. Transphobic vs. Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides.

 - AS5 is the only one of the rates that did not have a song in the first charity rate (Here Comes the Sun, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, and It's Okay to Cry were the alumni for the other 3)
